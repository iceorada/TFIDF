<LD>The franchise lives. "Die Another Day," the 20th installment in MGM's
lucrative James Bond industry, saw the best opening ever for a Bond
film, raking in $47.1 million. The question now, heading into the
Thanksgiving holiday weekend, is whether Bond can hold on to the No.
1 spot, given that "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," which
grossed $42.2 million over the weekend, remains a powerful force.
Also, never rule out Disney during this period, especially Disney
animation. This Wednesday, the Mouse House releases "Treasure
Planet," which should be popular with families.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, in limited release, "The Quiet American" opened in six
theaters with $101,663 for a healthy $16,944 per screen average. The
small indie drama "Personal Velocity" debuted on two New York
screens, grossing $29,943 for an average of $14,972. It opens
Wednesday in L.A.</LD>

<KH>MUSIC REVIEW</KH>
<HD>A weighty program turns buoyant</HD>
<DH>The passionate pairing of Paris Piano Trio and Ysaye
Quartet gives zip to an outsized concert.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard S. Ginell</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Paris Piano Trio and Ysaye Quartet have appeared in the Southland
before separately, but never together, as they did at UCLA's
Schoenberg Hall on Sunday afternoon. It turned out to be a
collaboration of real distinction, easily justifying the program's
outsized length and content -- about two hours and 40 minutes,
including intermission, of weighty German music.</LD>
<LD>   In three configurations, the musicians produced near-ideal fusions
of passion, energy and control, with nary a moment when their
concentration seemed to flag, always serving the composers rather
than their individual egos. And technically, there were no weak links
among the seven players, hardly any passages that you wished might
have been more cleanly executed.</LD>
<LD>   There were no designated warmup pieces, either, for the Paris
threesome opened with a vigorous, tightly welded performance of
Beethoven's "Ghost" Trio, where distinction lay in details like
pianist Jean-Claude Pennetier's genuinely spooky piano tremolos in
the bass during the second movement.</LD>
<TE>   With Pennetier now through for the day, Paris violinist Regis
Pasquier and cellist Roland Pidoux joined Ysaye violinists Guillaume
Sutre and Luc-Marie Aguera, violist Miguel Da Silva and cellist
Francois Salque in the Brahms Sextet in G, catching fire in the
abruptly swift middle sections of the second and third movements.</TE>
<TE>   To close, Pidoux and the Ysayes tackled Schubert's always
awe-inspiring String Quintet in C, just a bit self-consciously ardent
in phrasing in spots, but with perfectly sprung tempos and
particularly furious yet contained drive in the Scherzo. They even
observed the huge first movement repeat -- which stretches an already
massive movement to 20 minutes -- and made it seem not a bar too
long.</TE>

<HD>Cole's presence is felt in Shearing-Pizzarelli pairing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Heckman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The capacity of jazz to reach easily across generations was on full
display Sunday at the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts.</LD>
<LD>   Working on the same bill, independently with their own groups and
together as a team, were pianist George Shearing, 83, and
guitarist-singer Johnny Pizzarelli, 42. Despite the difference in
age, they performed with the empathetic ease of players who share a
mutual, and timeless, musical perspective.</LD>
<LD>   The too-brief segment in which Pizzarelli joined the Shearing
quintet featured several songs from the pianist's just-released
album, "The Rare Delight of You." The album is packaged with a cover
obviously intended to resemble an earlier Shearing collaboration, the
1961 LP "Nat King Cole Sings, George Shearing Plays," and both the
newer recording and the Cerritos performance called up memories of
the now-legendary Cole-Shearing collaboration. Brightly rhythmic on
Bobby Troupe's "Lemon Twist," performed with the full Shearing
quintet, Pizzarelli shifted into a laid-back, Cole-like lyricism in a
mesmerizing version of the once-popular, now sadly neglected Emil
Newman-Edgar DeLange ballad, "Lost April."</LD>
<TE>   Like Cole, Pizzarelli is a singing instrumentalist whose vocals
are deeply invested with the facile phrasing and sophisticated
musicality of an artist who has spent many years mastering both the
complexities and the subtleties of his instrument. Fronting his own
trio (with brother Martin Pizzarelli on bass and Ray Kennedy on
piano) he performed buoyant renderings of standards such as
"Something to Remember You By," "They Can't Take That Away From Me"
and, especially, "Straighten Up and Fly Right," delivered the same
sort of jazz essentials wrapped in a package of swinging rhythms
present in Cole's best work. And, on a high speed,
catch-me-if-you-can romp through "I Got Rhythm, Pizzarelli's scat
singing, delivered in unison with his improvised guitar line, set an
incomparably high standard of entertaining inventiveness, a stunning
display of what good scatting is really all about.</TE>
<TE>   Shearing's recent outings echo the sound of his earliest ensemble
of the late '40s and '50s -- a velvety blend of piano, guitar and
vibes with bass and drum accompaniment. His brief set -- which
featured a pair of bop classics, "Donna Lee" and "Subconscious-Lee,"
as well as his own "Lullaby of Birdland" -- was an appealing musical
reminiscence of a classic bebop era.</TE>

<HD>Just going his own way</HD>
<DH>Dennis Haysbert has made waves with independent characters
-- '24's' president and 'Heaven's' gardener who does as he wants.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dennis Haysbert brought tears to the eyes of writer-director Todd
Haynes when the actor auditioned for the role of the gentle,
intelligent gardener Raymond in "Far From Heaven." And his delicate,
honest performance in the acclaimed drama has been causing many a
tear to well up ever since.</LD>
<LD>   "He ended up being the very first person who ever read a scene
from the film to me," Haynes says. "There was no one who completely
fit the role in so many aspects. He understood the character, but he
also understood the meter of this kind of [spare] writing and this
kind of acting -- without doing anything over big. He is very quiet
and contained."</LD>
<LD>   "Far From Heaven" is Haynes' homage to the "women's films" made by
director Douglas Sirk in the 1950s -- films such as "All That Heaven
Allows" and "Written on the Wind" that present a picture-postcard
world on the surface disguising the universe's ugly underbelly of
lies, deceit, gossip and hate.</LD>
<TE>   Haysbert also has attracted attention on the small screen, as
President-in-crisis David Palmer in the Fox network's serialized
thriller, "24."</TE>
<TE>   Relaxing in a hotel lounge on a recent rainy morning, the 6-foot-4
Haysbert, 48, is charming and friendly despite battling a bad cold.</TE>
<TE>   On his right hand he's wearing a brace: He recently broke his hand
doing an intense scene for "24." This season, Palmer is trying to
prevent a nuclear attack on Los Angeles, but Haysbert won't discuss
the particulars of the scene in which he injured himself,
"otherwise," Haysbert adds, smiling, "I'd have to kill you."</TE>
<TE>   Set in Connecticut in 1957, "Far From Heaven" finds Raymond, a
black widower with a young daughter, falling in love with white
housewife and mother Cathy (Julianne Moore), who has just discovered
that her emotionally distant husband (Dennis Quaid) is gay. As Cathy
and Raymond become closer, though, they find their budding
relationship the object of gossip and prejudice.</TE>
<TE>   Haysbert had seen only one Sirk film, the 1959 melodrama
"Imitation of Life," which deals with racial prejudice. "It's one of
my favorites," he says. But he didn't watch any of Sirk's other films
before production began because "everything I needed was in the
script. The film draws you in. You think you are in this kind of
'Donna Reed,' 'Father Knows Best,' 'Leave It to Beaver" world, and
then you see this terrible underbelly.</TE>
<TE>   "You start to see the world as it truly is rather than the one
that people want you to see. All Raymond wants to do is live his
life. He doesn't live it according to what he thinks he should be
entitled to, he just entitles himself. He does what he feels."</TE>
<TE>   Moore says that she felt safe in her scenes with Haysbert. "He has
such a beautiful voice, a very mellifluous, relaxing voice," the
actress says. "I used to say to Todd that he makes me so relaxed. He
had this very easy kind of masculine quality that is so wonderful in
the part. He is charming and warm, and you felt secure and safe with
him and cared for."</TE>
<TE>   In the lounge, Haysbert is interrupted by the appearance of Penny
Johnson Gerald, who plays President Palmer's Lady Macbeth of an
ex-wife, Sherry.</TE>
<TE>   "Here is my television wife," he says smiling</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, the man of my dreams," coos Johnson Gerald, who had just
completed international publicity for "24" that morning at the same
hotel. Haysbert gives her a big hug and asks, "How are you, sweetie?"</TE>
<TE>   The two chat briefly about Haysbert's plan to rip off the
wallpaper in his new house. ""It's the best wallpaper you could
possibly buy," Haysbert says. "But just not for him," Johnson Gerald
says.</TE>
<TE>   "The house was done in this Christmas green and red, and in the
kitchen, everything is done in flowers," Haysbert says. "I like that
dry look. I am a paint guy, and then give me artwork to put on the
wall."</TE>
<TE>   Haysbert shot "Far From Heaven" last fall in New Jersey while
simultaneously shooting the first season of "24" in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "The scary thing for a film production is to have an actor in a
lead series and shooting a movie at the same time," Haynes says. "It
created so many barriers. It was completely scary up until his first
day of shooting, that this may or may not work."</TE>
<TE>   "I look back now and I don't know how we worked that out,"
Haysbert says. "The real interesting thing about that it was the
month after 9/11. It was very interesting looking at people on the
airplanes because they would check out everybody and be very
tentative, very quiet."</TE>
<TE>   The flying back and forth was worth it for Haysbert, who when he
first read the script for "Far From Heaven" couldn't get over the
beauty of Haynes' dialogue. The one sequence that captured his heart
was when Raymond takes Cathy to an African American bar and grill to
illustrate to her what it is like to be the only one among many.</TE>
<TE>   "I have never read a scene that was written like that," Haysbert
says. "I have never seen where it actually turns the tables and said,
'Oh yeah. I am indeed alone, the only one, but there are places where
I am one of many and the situation is reversed.' I bring her in to
kind of teach her that."</TE>
<TE>   "He takes the lead in a very gentle way" in that scene, Haynes
says. "In a way Cathy and Raymond's biggest flaw is their hope, the
wish for a different way the world could be. But the world is much
less open than they are as people and they are burned by it."</TE>
<TE>   Although Cathy and Raymond's love remains unconsummated, Haysbert
believes the characters eventually find happiness. "In my mind, the
movie is 20 minutes longer and you can project about six months
ahead," he says. "I would have tried to find a way to call her and we
could go to California or Oregon or Washington -- a place where you
had the fewest people and where people didn't care. There could be a
place like that."</TE>

<HD>It's too much reading, says one book prize judge</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hillel Italie</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The job seems impossible from the start: As a nonfiction judge for
the National Book Awards, you get six months to read some 400 books
on everything from environmental science to backroom politics.</LD>
<LD>   At least one of this year's voters, columnist and television
commentator Michael Kinsley, says he didn't even try.</LD>
<LD>   In a column posted Thursday on the online magazine Slate, Kinsley
acknowledged he looked at only a fraction of the submissions. He
likened the awards to choosing "the best rhubarb pie at the state
fair" and hinted that he didn't complete Wednesday's winner: Robert
Caro's 1,000-page "Master of the Senate," the third volume of his
Lyndon Johnson biography.</LD>
<TE>   "Once every seven or eight years, Robert Caro wheels out another
gargantuan volume in his legendary biography of Lyndon Johnson, now
up to Vol. 6: The Kindergarten Era (Part 1)," Kinsley wrote. He said
he agreed to be a judge out of "mainly vanity and a desire for free
books."</TE>
<TE>   "[D]id I actually read every page? I'll never tell."</TE>
<TE>   Neil Baldwin, executive director of the National Book Foundation,
which sponsors the awards, said Friday that he knew Kinsley wasn't
keeping up. According to Baldwin, Kinsley felt "very contrite and
apologetic" over the summer and had to be talked out of quitting.</TE>
<TE>   Kinsley did not return messages Friday and has written nothing
further on the matter.</TE>

<HD>Get down, get funky: Disco gets its due</HD>
<DH>The polyester, the glitter, the lights. They're all there
in a museum exhibit on the sounds of the '70s.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Scott Martelle</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>It's flashback time here in the land of Hendrix. Pulsating colored
lights play over a parquet dance floor as disco's signature "four on
the floor" drum beat propels lyrics of unbearable lightness:</LD>
<LD>   "We're gonna boogie oogie oogie 'til you just can't boogie no
more."</LD>
<LD>   "That's the way -- uh huh, uh huh -- I like it."</LD>
<TE>   "Play that funky music, white boy."</TE>
<TE>   A thousand people mingle, cups of beer and wine in hand, as scores
more dance in swirls of spaghetti straps and glitter, polyester and
loud prints. Last dance, last chance, indeed.</TE>
<TE>   The good news for disco haters -- and there are many -- is that
this isn't a revival, some sort of hip retro embrace like the
rockabilly cats and their '50s bowling shirts. Rather, this is a
museum, and disco is getting its cultural due on the gala opening
night of what is believed to be the first serious exhibit of a
musical and social phenomenon that, for better or worse, largely
defined the '70s.</TE>
<TE>   "Disco: A Decade of Saturday Nights" runs through May 26 at
Experience Music Project, a Gehry-rigged rock 'n' roll museum complex
here in the thin shadow of Seattle's famous Space Needle. The
exhibit, just across the hall from a permanent display on native son
Jimi Hendrix, seeks to lend disco the dignity it failed to attain
during its heyday, when it shimmied its way out of New York City's
underground party scene and into the American mainstream.</TE>
<TE>   Then, as now, the music oozed idiosyncrasy. Based on exuberant
black funk, disco eventually reduced the rhythm section to an icily
predictable beat. Its most successful artists were such divas as
Donna Summer, with powerful voices that delivered lyrics of epic
banality. And while disco was born on the fringes of black and gay
urban culture, it quickly became as middle American as mayonnaise on
white bread. Even Donny Osmond got into the act.</TE>
<TE>   "Disco at its inception was an underground phenomenon, and it
became more mainstream than any pop style before or since," said San
Francisco music critic Barry Walter, an advisor to the exhibit, as
Barry Manilow's "Copacabana (At the Copa)" blasted from the speakers
at Saturday night's party. "At its peak, it was inescapable, and it
was a music about escapism."</TE>
<TE>   The exhibit attempts to offer an intelligent, rooted history of a
music form that was -- and still is -- widely dismissed by critics as
anti-intellectual drivel that existed solely to put feet on the dance
floor. Curated by former music critics rather than musicians or music
historians, the exhibit leaves disco's musical evolution largely
unexplored.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the exhibit focuses on social connections as it traces
disco from its prenatal stages in '60s "discotheques," with their
vague sense of internationalism, into the gay subculture of New York
City after the Stonewall Riot in 1969. After that, disco became a
global sensation even as it seemed to lose, like its '70s cousin
punk, its initial purpose.</TE>
<TE>   "Like anything else that starts out as avant-garde, it gets
assimilated and changes," said Brian Robinson, a Seattle photography
dealer who wandered through the exhibit on opening night. "Pure punk
lasted a shorter time than disco, and it was supposed to take over.
Everything gets assimilated."</TE>
<TE>   At its peak in the late '70s, more than 15,000 discos were open in
the U.S., according to the exhibit. If true, that means disco was
more pervasive than McDonalds, which to date has 13,000 domestic
restaurants. Disco did seem to be everywhere, from televised dance
shows to school lunchboxes and from mainstream magazines to movie
theaters, where "Saturday Night Fever" helped launch the career of
John Travolta (whose famous white suit is included in the exhibit).</TE>
<TE>   Disco came crashing down as cocaine proved not to be the wonder
drug many of its users believed it to be and fear of AIDS put the
shackles back on lust. Morality was in and the disco lights gave way
to another Travolta-related trend -- "Urban Cowboy"-inspired line
dancing.</TE>
<TE>   The hard-core went back underground and listened to house music
until the dance-oriented counterculture of the '80s found house,
hip-hop and techno music, giving rise to the rave as a new generation
embraced many of the impulses unleashed by disco.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibit touches on all the key aspects of disco, from its
early insider exclusiveness to its apex as a mass-marketing
phenomenon. Songs and oral histories on headsets dovetail with
displays of disco diva dresses, short bios of influential DJs and
even the "disco sucks" backlash -- including video footage of
hundreds of baseball fans rioting at Chicago's Comiskey Park when a
local rock DJ burned disco albums on the field in 1979.</TE>
<TE>   Before the marketers got hold of it, before disco became the
soundtrack in countless Holiday Inn lounges, the music was the
physical expression of emotional freedom, says Ann Powers, a former
music critic and one of three curators of the exhibit.</TE>
<TE>   Disco emerged in underground New York in the early '70s with a
series of small private clubs -- some took place in the hosts'
apartments -- where innovative DJs began playing obscure tracks of
hard-driving dance music that evolved from funk and soul. Those were
egalitarian events despite being private and grew into a heavily
mixed scene of gays and straights, whites, blacks and Latinos, kids
and adults. Powers and others believe the disco backlash was in large
part not against the music but against its listeners: Gays,
minorities and women.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the music of marginalized people who decided they were not
going to be marginalized," Powers said.</TE>
<TE>   The music was the message, and its freewheeling energy reflected
the growing freedoms that came with women's liberation and the sexual
revolution, gay liberation and the continuing crumbling of racial
barriers. Cocaine, its addictive properties and health dangers not
yet fully understood, was the drug of choice. Discos became meat
markets, the place to find a one-night stand and a few lines.</TE>
<TE>   "This was the era when women were starting to feel confident about
expressing their sexuality in ways they never had before," Powers
said. "For heterosexuals, this was the golden era of sensuality. It
was a place where you could explore your limits, and your body, to
negative effect eventually."</TE>
<TE>   The excesses of disco converged at New York's Studio 54, where
celebrity culture, hedonism and drugs merged, drawing the
high-profile -- Andy Warhol, Grace Jones -- and the wannabes, all
dancing beneath the legendary moon-and-spoon with the lighted path of
powdered cocaine going up that lunar nose.</TE>
<TE>   "That was when the aficionados went back underground and waited
for house music to emerge," Powers said. "But the idea that something
is ruined by going mainstream only applies to the elites."</TE>
<TE>   Frank Crapanzano was among the elites. He was there nearly at the
beginning, and he is here again now as disco moves formally into
history. Crapanzano and his roommate were the original "beanie boys"
for the crocheted hats they wore to early disco parties, an
affectation born in campiness that spawned countless imitators.</TE>
<TE>   Crapanzano, who still lives in New York, held court Saturday night
at a display that included period pictures of himself and a few of
the hundreds of beanies he wore back in the day. "It was
exhilarating," said Crapanzano, 68, a retired high school English
teacher who essentially gave up disco when his favorite club -- the
Flamingo -- closed in 1982. "It was all about dancing and having
fun."</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, Robinson, the photo dealer, eyed a display of Warhol
photos of such Studio 54 patrons as Arnold Schwarzenegger and Keith
Haring, Liza Minnelli and Bianca Jagger. There are images of the
non-famous, as well, including scantily clad, lithesome young men.</TE>
<TE>   "This is incredibly funny," said Robinson, 36, a Los Angeles
native who moved to Seattle seven years ago. "It seems so innocent.
As hedonistic as things got, it seems funny to see these people hand
in hand, twirling on the dance floor."</TE>
<TE>   Cheryl Johnson defends disco to this day. A professional dancer,
she used to help arrange theme events at Studio 54 and these days
runs a dance studio in Seattle. At Saturday's opening, she helped
keep the dance floor vibrant. Before the music began, she took a
twirl through the exhibit.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people have the general point of view that disco is
junk, just a lot of repetition," Johnson said as she stood before a
display on the underground party DJs who gave disco its start.
"There's a lot of different rhythms going on. It was a cross-cultural
sound."</TE>
<TE>   But like many things, disco -- the music and the scene -- had to
be experienced to be appreciated, she said. And the true scene died
as soon as it hit the mainstream. The nail in the coffin was MTV,
which did for New Wave what "Saturday Night Fever" did for disco --
made it common.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty years on, Johnson said, all that's left of the party is the
echo. And the pictures hanging on a museum wall, a display, she said,
that can never recapture the life and energy of the original thing.</TE>
<TE>   "This is giving me a kick, but I don't know if people can truly
get something by looking at pictures," said Johnson, wearing a
strapless dress that seemed to whisper, "dance with me." "They can
get a little taste. But you can only experience it if you were
there."</TE>

<LD>Last Monday night, the marquee of the Wiltern Theatre announced the
L.A. stop of a five-city Blondie tour. It might as well have read
"Welcome Back, Class of 1981."</LD>
<LD>   The line went around the block as early as 7 for a show that
started at 8 because the Wiltern now has general admission tickets,
which includes limited seating, and this was a crowd that appreciates
the importance of good seating. By 7:30, the doors were open and a
bunch of thirtysomethings nursed cocktails in plastic cups, no doubt
mentally calculating baby-sitting fees while waiting patiently for
the opening band.</LD>
<LD>   There was no rowdy behavior, no one actively looking to score.
There was no passing of bottles or bongs or bindles,  only business
cards.</LD>
<TE>   "Where is the steam-</TE>
<TE>   table buffet?" my brother asked as we quickly claimed seats.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't help much that the newly redone Wiltern, at least when
the lights are up, looks like a bar at an airport Hilton, a bar with
a name like "Whispers" or "Moonshadows." Several levels of soothingly
mauve carpet dotted with elevated cafe tables lead to "the Pit" -- a
dance area with a shining wood floor right out of Pottery Barn.</TE>
<TE>   On this evening, the crowd in the Pit smiled and chatted and
looked more like dutiful participants in an office holiday party than
the semi-glam rockers we all presumably aspired to be in our youth.
"And here come Fran and Elise from Human Resources," said my brother,
as two women with painfully sensible haircuts and nice leather
backpacks got their hands stamped and joined the polite murmur of the
Pit.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember at my first Blondie concert there were Frisbees flying
around with joints taped to them," he said wistfully, surveying the
dinner menu. "Now we can have salmon and tiramisu. Now we can have
rice and steamed veggies. Broc on."</TE>
<TE>   It is a slender demographic, Blondie fans, figuratively, if no
longer literally, made up mostly of those born at the tail end of the
baby boom and just before what became known as Gen X. Culturally, it
is the true Lost Generation -- we are neither Ken Kesey nor Douglas
Coup-</TE>
<TE>   land, we are certainly not Dave Eggers. "How '70s of you," said
one 50-ish friend on hearing of my Blondie plans. "No, no," I said,
"how '80s of me," and that is pretty much the problem in a nutshell.</TE>
<TE>   Boomers now control the retro world as well and they seem to have
forgotten that anyone other than Bruce Springsteen and Van Morrison
made music between 1975 and the emergence of Snoop Dogg. One rock
critic threw up his hands, threw up his hands, when I said I thought
Blondie's music was still great. But that's the trouble with
middle-aged men these days; they're so busy trying to convince the
world that they really do like Eminem that they have forgotten
several decades of their past.</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe they just blocked it -- all that Duran Duran and Stray
Cats, all that early Madonna -- because so much of it was pretty
awful and because, good or bad, it's the music of our youth that
makes the strongest imprint.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In-between generation</TE>
<TE>   So Bob Dylan still gets more ink than most contemporary artists
when he goes on tour, critics inevitably noting with sheepish
self-adoration the balding pates and spreading waistlines of the
audience. The Rolling Stones recently hit the road with a crepey,
creepy Keith Richards as their media front man. Even Paul McCartney
has been hoisted out of semi-retirement, looking ghastly and
surrounded by ghosts, despite his newly wedded bliss.</TE>
<TE>   For those of us too young for Botox, too old for a tongue stud,
this is the story of our lives. Not all of us were brave enough to
appreciate Patti Smith and most of us were too old to go clubbing by
the time Kurt Cobain had his way. So a Blondie concert is a rare and
wonderful refuge, a chance to spend time in the company of our own
kind -- people who read Interview instead of Rolling Stone, who
remember when the Pyramid Club was still cool and Amstel Light the
height of beer-swilling sophistication.</TE>
<TE>   Which explains why, by the time the band took the stage at 9:15,
the place was absolutely packed. Still polite, even subdued, but
packed. And, surprisingly, not everyone was over 30 and under 50.
Youngsters in wraparounds and flannel jackets, in seamed stockings
and bowling shoes mingled with their elders. A trio of young women
tricked out in East Village circa 1986 huddled near the front. Their
names were Heather, Cameron and Paige and they love Blondie.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been fans all our lives, since we were, like, 5," said
Heather, whose parents introduced her to the group.</TE>
<TE>   She wore a mini-kilt slung with studded black leather belts, black
fishnets and a tank top that exposed her spectacularly tattooed arms.
Her hair was aubergine, her lip pierced, her eyebrows plucked within
an inch of their lives and she looked just fabulous.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel so young," she said, surveying the crowd in its nice Gap
sweaters and jeans. They could have been at a parent-teacher
conference. They could have been at the mall. "I thought all Blondie
fans would be really young," said Heather. "I mean, I'm 28 -- but we
walked in here and, like ... " she pointedly scanned the room, "you
know."</TE>
<TE>   We know. In this room, 28 is young. I had that same belt, those
fishnets, that skirt and bracelets made out of Israeli bomber casings
up to my elbows. I had radical feminist political buttons and big
rhinestone crosses. What I didn't have was the pierced lip and the
heart to tell her that, in 10 years, she'll probably be wearing
pearls and pants with a little give in them too. (I have no idea what
she'll do with those tattoos.)</TE>
<TE>   "I have just seen my retro self," I told my brother, who is two
years younger than I.</TE>
<TE>   But when the lights go down and the music begins, we're all the
same again. The band comes out and they're old too. "My God," my
brother said when Debbie Harry made her appearance, "she looks like
Ellen Burstyn. Although a young Ellen Burstyn," he added quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Not really. At no age would Ellen Burstyn ever wear a silver lame
miniskirt and (where did Debbie find them?) silver glitter fold-over
boots. Like the rest of us, she's put on a few pounds -- kicking the
hard stuff will do that to you -- but you know, it's nice to see a
female performer who doesn't look like she spends 10 hours a day
being ironed and stretched flat in a Pilates studio somewhere.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The woman can sing</TE>
<TE>   After all these years, she still can't dance. But she can still
sing. And when Clem Burke started pounding the drums for "Dreaming,"
the crowd went wild, yelling and screaming and dancing, singing along
to lyrics that still mean something, that still jerk us out of our
seats and into the Pit. Suddenly, the Wiltern redesign made perfect
sense -- if you're going to host bands that make you dance, there
ought to be room to dance.</TE>
<TE>   It was a tight-run show that ended by 11:30 ("I think Debbie's
going to need a little soak now," my brother said as we left).</TE>
<TE>   But for a couple of hours on a Monday night we were transported to
an age ruled by expectation rather than responsibility, when we had
way more free time than money, when it was impossible to be
undignified because we were completely unfettered by gain.</TE>
<TE>   That's what made Dylan cool and that's what made Blondie cool, and
the rest is just a question of timing.</TE>

<HD>A presidential odds couple</HD>
<DH>Political junkies in Washington are fantasizing about a
Clinton-Rice contest in '08.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Johanna Neuman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>Washington</DL>
<LD>Washington</LD>
<LD>   It's the ultimate inside-the-Beltway fantasy, a political tease
too titillating to surrender, because it ends with the prospect of
two women running against one another for president of the United
States in 2008.</LD>
<LD>   Or, in some scripts, it ends with the clash of two dynasties, a
titanic grudge match that will determine the most powerful family in
the most powerful nation on the planet.</LD>
<TE>   Plot too tired, movie been done?</TE>
<TE>   Well maybe in Hollywood, but in Washington, fantasy politics is
all the buzz. Now that the midterm elections are history (except in
Louisiana, where campaign-o-holics have managed to drag out their
elections into the Christmas shopping season), politicos are only too
happy to salivate over the contests to come. Like rotisserie
baseball, presidential scenario-spinning requires a few leaps of
faith and the usual creative mind. After that, it's all delicious
speculation.</TE>
<TE>   Scenario One: Democrats rally around Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y.)
as their presidential candidate in 2008, after she is reelected in a
roar from New York in 2006.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush attempts to preempt Hillary's expected star-power
run with a trump card of his own, naming national security advisor
Condoleezza Rice as his vice presidential running mate in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Bush-Rice triumphs at the polls, making Rice the first woman and
the first African American to be vice president. Then in 2008, it's
Hillary vs. Condi.</TE>
<TE>   Never mind that Rice, a Soviet scholar from Stanford University
who is Bush's top advisor on foreign policy, has never held elective
office, has little policy portfolio on domestic issues and claims not
to be interested in the position. Or that the job she says she really
hungers for after life in the White House is commissioner of the
National Football League. Or that she is believed to be pro-choice on
abortion in a party where that is a hurdle to high office. Already, a
new Web site is urging her to run (seattlewebservices.com/rice), and
chat rooms regularly dissect the prospect. Scenario Two: Jeb Bush
leaves office triumphant after his second term as governor of Florida
in 2006 and decides to carry the family mantle into the 2008
presidential race, this time against Hillary Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   "The Shakespearean scenario," said Paul Maslin, a Democratic
pollster in California. "A former first lady running against the
first brother with two former presidents in the wings, neither
particularly old or disheveled. And then there'd be Barbara Bush off
in the corner somewhere with a voodoo doll."</TE>
<TE>   Groan if you must, but political junkies love this stuff. They
have already handicapped the odds, and, depending on who is talking,
Hillary's run is a sure bet and Condi's is a longshot.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush seemed to dash hopes for the first scenario.
"Should I decide to run," he intoned recently during a press
conference, "Vice President Cheney will be my running mate."</TE>
<TE>   But this being Washington no one believed him. Cheney's health
problems (he has had four heart attacks starting at age 37, a
quadruple heart bypass operation and now wears an implant), only fuel
the speculation.</TE>
<TE>   And Tony Blankley, editorial page editor of the conservative
Washington Times, is convinced that Republican Party elders will
force Cheney off the ticket.</TE>
<TE>   "Cheney will want to stay on and Bush will want him to stay," he
explained. "But national Republicans will implore Bush to put on the
ticket somebody who can be the standard bearer in 2008. To give up
that advantage would be painful."</TE>
<TE>   Blankley admits that Bush will resist the pressure. And Cheney
himself is perhaps the first vice president in history who actually
likes his job, which John Nance Garner, FDR's first veep, once
likened to a bucket of warm spit (actually he said something a bit
more graphic).</TE>
<TE>   Still, the scenario beckons.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm betting on a Bush-Rice ticket in 2004," said William Kristol,
editor of the conservative Weekly Standard, who has been pushing the
idea since March. "Bush is a bit of a gambler politically."</TE>
<TE>   To Kristol and other Republican cheerleaders, a Rice candidacy is
enticing because it offers promise of crossover appeal to black
voters who would otherwise vote Democratic. No one is really sure if
this will work -- it did not seem to help Democrats win more Jewish
votes than usual when Sen. Joe Lieberman (D-Conn.) was Al Gore's vice
presidential candidate in 2000 -- but pundits who play the fantasy
game love to toss this one around.</TE>
<TE>   "It depends on the issue mix," said Kristol.</TE>
<TE>   "Generally black conservatives in the past have not been able to
attract black Democratic votes. It suggests that ideology really is
more important than race identity."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe, but some Democrats worry that Hillary Clinton's high
negatives and a Condi Rice candidacy bathed in the aura of historic
destiny could combine to give Republicans the edge.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like that matchup," said Jennifer Laszlo Mizrahi, a
Democratic pollster. "We lose."</TE>
<TE>   Pollster John Zogby thinks the Condi-Hillary matchup is "a stroke
of genius" because it removes any voter unease about voting for a
woman as commander in chief.</TE>
<TE>   Hillary Clinton's negatives, he calculates, are irrelevant, since
she has mastered the art of winning even though one-third of voters
"hate her guts." And Rice could pull in enough blacks, Zogby thinks,
to embarrass the Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   "She doesn't have to bring too many," he said. "Now Republicans
have about 10%. She could probably build that into 18% to 20%, just
enough to embarrass the Democrats. The Democrats can't win without
90% of the black vote."</TE>
<TE>   Geraldine Ferraro, a former Democratic congresswoman from New
York, was the first woman tapped to be a vice presidential candidate.
Actually, so far she's the only woman nominated on a major party
ticket.</TE>
<TE>   She likes all the talk of an all-female contest. But she thinks a
more likely Republican opponent for Hillary Clinton is Sen. Kay
Bailey Hutchinson.</TE>
<TE>   "If Kay Bailey Hutchinson weren't from Texas [where Bush already
had an electoral lock], she would have been the vice presidential
nominee in 2000," said Ferraro, who heads a New York-based management
consulting firm. "I don't agree with her on the issues, but she's
done a credible job as senator, representing her party, precisely the
type of person who should run."</TE>
<TE>   Others mention newly elected Sen. Elizabeth Dole (R-N.C.) who ran
for president in 2000 and whose husband ran, in 1996, against Bill
Clinton. Another grudge match?</TE>
<TE>   If you poll the U.S. Senate on any given day, you will find 99
senators, give or take one, who thinks he or she is presidential
timber.</TE>
<TE>   But in the last 100 years, far more presidents have come from
governor's offices than the U.S. Senate. Voters may be more likely to
look to a governor for executive leadership and managerial muscle.</TE>
<TE>   But those who like to war-game presidential races think a woman
commander in chief can balance any voter unease by having a male vice
president.</TE>
<TE>   Asked what qualities Rice or Clinton should look for in a running
mate, Maslin, who polls for Gov. Gray Davis, said, "A man."</TE>
<TE>   Women's advocates are somewhat cheered by a new crop of female
governors now in the pipeline toward the presidency whose performance
could blunt voter resistance to women in high office. Several pointed
out there are now more female governors -- six (not counting Puerto
Rico's) -- than chief executives of Fortune 500 firms.</TE>
<TE>   Ann Lewis, a friend and supporter of Hillary Clinton's, likes the
chatter.</TE>
<TE>   "Anytime we start discussing scenarios, we're helping women," said
Lewis, who chairs the Democratic National Committee's
elect-women-to-office campaign. "Making it imaginable is a big step
to making it real."</TE>

dismiss 6-year-old traffic charges against R&amp;B singer Bobby Brown,
and ordered the entertainer to face a Jan. 21 jury trial. The 1996
charges resurfaced when Brown was arrested two weeks ago in Atlanta

<LD>Pianist Andre Watts was released Saturday from Hoag Memorial Hospital

Christopher Duma. Watts, 56, was operated on Nov. 14 for a subdural
hematoma, or bleeding between the brain and the skull. He missed a
scheduled performance with the Pacific Symphony.</LD>
<LD>   "The tests of finger dexterity and neurological function were all
normal," Duma said Monday. "We think that the culprit was relatively
poorly controlled high blood pressure, which is now under control. I
expect him to do marvelously.</LD>
<LD>   "For his age group, for this type of hemorrhage," Duma added, "the
mortality rate is about 50% to 60%. He's in the very lucky 40%. He
got surgical intervention in time."</LD>

<HD>'The Emperor's Club' riddle: Do uplifting movies matter at
all?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sean Mitchell</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Reviews of the new Kevin Kline film, "The Emperor's Club," have been
lukewarm, marking off points for its old-fashioned style and theme,
some wondering why anyone should care about its musty world of
privileged boys studying for their upcoming roles in the ruling
class. Based on a short story by Ethan Canin, "The Emperor's Club" is
a morality tale about a prep school history teacher whose mastery in
the classroom is challenged by one of his students, the callous,
ambitious son of a U.S. senator.</LD>
<LD>   The film makes a case for the enduring influence of a great
teacher like Kline's Mr. Hundert even as it contrasts his cloistered
idealism with the real-world success skills of the senator's son, who
slinks through a dismal and dishonorable academic career before
amassing a fortune in business as a prelude to running for office
himself.</LD>
<LD>   It's a story about the beauty of erudition and the exercise of
power, and how the two things are unrelated at schools and in the
world beyond. It's also about ethics and character and the value of
ancient history and maybe a few other things, and the fact that it's
about anything (besides good guys killing bad guys or trying to get a
date) raises its sights above the average Hollywood studio picture.</LD>
<TE>   Yet even as I noted its unfashionably quiet tone and serious
intentions, watching "The Emperor's Club" reminded me that Hollywood,
despite its low reputation among intellectuals, has over the years
produced, along with all the James Bond films, teen sex comedies,
sadistic thrillers and "Jackass," its share of thought-provoking and
truthful films about ethics and history, social issues and justice,
political corruption and war. Their lasting beneficial effect on
society has been close to zero. And I don't understand this.</TE>
<TE>   How is it that art, especially the most popular art, can be so
impotent? It may be naive to look for a link between art and social
improvement, but inside a theater I'm willing to give way to such
naivete, at least for two hours. Watching "The Emperor's Club," I
allowed myself the illusion that a story examining character and its
importance might change the way people think about the value of
teachers and how wrong it is when the good ones are passed over for
promotions in favor of brazen careerists and public relations types.</TE>
<TE>   It's all there in "The Emperor's Club," textbook case, the writing
on the wall, the sorry way the world works. And I want to believe
that after a few million people see this film, those in charge will
be shamed into changing the way they behave and it will only be a
matter of time before teachers' salaries across the nation are
doubled and deceitful politicians voted out of office, virtue
restored, and, you know, hooray for Hollywood, after all. Aren't
stories powerful and great!</TE>
<TE>   I know that none of this will happen. That's life in the real
world, especially a world where a story like this doesn't even
attract favorable attention from many critics, let alone the kids in
the mall.</TE>
<TE>   But still, I wonder, if a culture is measured to some degree by
the content of its stories and myths, do we conclude, then, that we
are living through a time when many of our best stories, even those
reaching the high visibility of a major studio film, are truly
marginal and disconnected from the culture at large? Or has it always
been thus?</TE>
<TE>   "It's like Mr. Hundert's position as a teacher," says Michael
Hoffman, who directed "The Emperor's Club." "You dedicate yourself to
something you think is important even though you know the world is a
cold, dark place. You know going in that it's not going to connect
with everyone."</TE>
<TE>   The people who made "The Emperor's Club" say they have been
heartened by testimonials provided by some middle-aged viewers who,
after seeing the film, have said they wanted to take up or go back to
teaching, while at the same time they were surprised to learn that
younger audience members were not so concerned by the pivotal moment
in the story when Sedgewick Bell, the senator's son (played by Emile
Hirsch), cheats. If true, that would seem to be evidence of a new
generation gap and suggest our society is seriously split over core
values informing films in the first place. Is it possible that Dustin
Hoffman's famous eye-glazing recoil at the word "plastics" in "The
Graduate" plays differently today to audiences in which the children
of Benjamin Braddock are searching in earnest for the next venture
capital idea rather than questioning the presumptions of affluence as
he did?</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the anti-establishment heroes of the '60s indeed are long
passe, along with the quaint notion of downsizing cars to help
economize on diminishing fossil fuels, but Hollywood has not led the
way with romantic portraits of corporate greed and monopoly, has it?
Instead we have had "Erin Brockovich," "The Insider," "Silkwood,"
"The China Syndrome," "Class Action," "The Truman Show," "Wall
Street" and many more depicting the corporation as a corrupting,
anti-social force. Yet the counter mythology supplied mainly by
advertising, I suppose, has maintained the benevolent images of
multinational brands and franchises.</TE>
<TE>   As the nation hurtles toward war in Iraq, with Congress backing a
U.S.-led military overthrow of Saddam Hussein, you could raise the
question, was "Born on the Fourth of July" that long ago? Oliver
Stone's Oscar-winning adaptation of paralyzed Vietnam vet Ron Kovic's
searing account of how the terrible reality of combat made cruel
mockery of his childlike view of war and patriotism provided all the
big screen evidence a young recruit would ever need to think twice
about rushing around the world to kick butt for the red, white and
blue. You can still rent it, along with "Platoon," "Full Metal
Jacket," "Saving Private Ryan," "Gallipoli," "Three Kings," "Paths of
Glory," and "All Quiet on the Western Front." How is it that so much
evidence of madness and brutality has not stuck to the public mind?</TE>
<TE>   "The Emperor's Club" is hardly the first good movie about a noble,
embattled teacher. "Stand and Deliver" in 1988 made a folk hero of
Garfield High's charismatic calculus instructor Jaime Escalante to
the extent we might have thought studio chiefs themselves would soon
be quitting their jobs to follow his example. But what lasting
reforms did the film inspire? The more recent "Mr. Holland's Opus"
and "Music of the Heart" argued dramatically for sustaining music
education in the public schools. Is that happening?</TE>
<TE>   I called a real teacher, a professor of American history at a
large, well-known university, and asked him if he had any idea why so
many popular stories about history and social issues seem to have so
little impact. He quoted Philip Caputo to me, from Caputo's Vietnam
memoir "A Rumor of War," something along the lines of: "We had read
our Wilfred Owen, but every generation is doomed to learn the lessons
of war on its own.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm in my 26th year of teaching, and I am struck by how little my
students pick up on the points I'm trying to make. I feel like
Charlie Brown trying to kick the football" in the comic strip
"Peanuts," recalling the image when Lucy always pulls the ball away
at the last second. "Every fall I trot back out there full of hope
and optimism and end up swinging at air."</TE>
<TE>   So perhaps the answer to my question, although it sounds too easy,
is that not enough people are really paying attention for movies to
matter. The good ones come and go just like the bad ones, ringing up
profits at the box office or not, but soon sinking back into the
ocean of sensation that washes the beach clean tomorrow.</TE>
<TE>   The producer of "The Emperor's Club," Mark Abraham, not
surprisingly believes the stories are worth telling nonetheless.
"Even if we don't know we're taking the beach, we still have to keep
fighting," he says. "There's a Don Quixote in all of us. And if just
a few people take the meaning of a movie to heart, that's the seed of
change."</TE>
<TE>   Percy Bysshe Shelley, a Romantic, once wrote: "Poets are the
unacknowledged legislators of the world," an idea that is said to
have originated with Plato. Mr. Hundert, I'm sure, knew the quotation
and may have even believed it. If I'd taken his class, maybe he could
have convinced me it was true.</TE>

<LD>L.A.'s theatrical spotlight shone on San Fernando Valley theaters at
the annual Ovation Awards ceremony Sunday night. Deaf West Theatre's
"Big River" and Road Theatre Company's "Napoli Milionaria," which
were produced at tiny venues next door to one another in North
Hollywood, won six Ovations each, more than any other single
productions.</LD>
<LD>   "I remember a time when people tried to discredit theater in the
Valley," Road Theatre artistic board member Marci Hill said after the
ceremony. "Now, it's wonderful." Hill won an Ovation for the "Napoli
Milionaria" costumes and was an Ovation voter.</LD>
<LD>   Burbank's Colony Theatre also took home six Ovations for three
productions. The only other theater that matched the three
pace-setting Valley companies in total number of Ovations was Center
Theatre Group, also with six.</LD>
<TE>   "The boring Valley has suddenly become hip and cool," said Barbara
Beckley, producing director of the Colony, at the party after the
ceremony at the Orpheum Theatre in downtown L.A.</TE>
<TE>   "Big River" and the Colony's "The Laramie Project" took two of the
top production honors, for best smaller musical and best larger play,
respectively.</TE>
<TE>   The others were won by Fountain Theatre's "After the Fall," for
best smaller play; the Civic Light Opera of South Bay Cities' revival
of "Crazy for You," for best larger musical; and the road company of
"The Full Monty" that launched its tour at Center Theatre Group's
Ahmanson Theatre, for best touring production.</TE>
<TE>   Ten of the 29 awards categories produced either two or three
winners this year because of changes in the Ovations rules that
allowed more than one winner in highly populated categories. Three of
the four lead actor categories yielded three winners apiece -- and
even though only one trophy emerged from the fourth category, lead
actress in a musical, it was shared by two actresses, Julie Dixon
Jackson and Misty Cotton, who played Siamese twins in the musical
"Side Show."</TE>
<TE>   The ceremony at the renovated 1926 Orpheum suggested a few echoes
of the building's vaudevillian past. Robert York played the theater's
Wurlitzer organ before and after the program. Actress Jane Johnston,
costumed in a clown outfit, periodically emerged from the wings with
a giant vaudeville-style hook in an attempt to curtail long-winded
acceptance speeches.</TE>
<TE>   In most cases, she simply brandished the hook, using it as a
visual incentive to the speakers to cut short their remarks. But on
several occasions, she snagged award winners with the hook and guided
them into the wings as they delivered their final few words.</TE>
<TE>   All three winners of best actor in a musical -- David Engel,
Michael A. Shepperd and R. Christofer Sands -- got the hook, which
prompted award presenter and Geffen Playhouse producing director
Gilbert Cates, who is producing the Oscar ceremony next spring, to
say, "I may try that out next year."</TE>
<TE>   This year's ceremony, emceed by Alfred Molina, eliminated the
musical production numbers that had lengthened previous Ovations
shows. After the ceremony, director Don Hill said his goal was "to
keep the train moving." In past years, he said, it was sometimes
difficult to reassemble casts from nominated musicals that had
already closed in order to do one number at the ceremony. Of this
year's nominated musicals, only "Big River" is still playing, and,
during part of the ceremony, it was being performed simultaneously at
the Mark Taper Forum, a few blocks away.</TE>
<TE>   Deaf West artistic director Ed Waterstreet, accepting the "Big
River" production prize, delivered some of his remarks through sign
language while an interpreter translated. Then, after directing the
interpreter to step aside, he reached out through gesture to a wide
swath of the audience and then brought his hands back inside his
jacket, close to his heart.</TE>
<TE>   Probably the biggest upset of the evening was the victory of South
Bay's "Crazy for You" over the Tony-winning revival of "Into the
Woods" and the premiere of the current Broadway hit "Flower Drum
Song." "Crazy for You" producer Steve Ullman noted that the
production opened eight days after Sept. 11, 2001, in the context of
many observations that "events had made what we do seem trivial." Yet
the show, he said, "gave people permission to laugh again ... to get
away from Fox News."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Ovation Awards are presented annually by Theatre LA, a service
organization for Los Angeles theaters. This year, nearly 350
productions were eligible for consideration.</LD>
<LD>   Any production from a producer or company that belongs to Theatre
LA is eligible but must pay a $45 registration fee on top of the
membership dues of between $295 and $1,800 a year (depending on a
company's annual gross) or $225 for a three-month membership (used by
temporary producers).</LD>
<LD>   This year's voting pool totaled 188; each voter was required to
attend at least 25 registered shows -- including at least 20 in
sub-100-seat theaters -- and rate components of the production on a
0.1-10.0 scale. Each contender's overall score is the mean score from
everyone who voted on it, so shows that attract more than the minimum
number of eight voters do not necessarily have an advantage. The use
of the mean instead of the average is designed to help prevent a
conspiracy of a few friends or enemies of a contender from skewing
the results by uniformly voting very high or very low scores.</LD>

<HD>Rescuing the classics: Computers do the nitty-gritty work</HD>
<DH>'Sunset Boulevard' and 'Roman Holiday' are stunning on DVD,
but the restorers came close to pulling the plug.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are horror stories surrounding the fate of the original film
negatives of some of cinema's best-loved classics. Orson Welles'
"Citizen Kane" and the Gene Kelly-Stanley Donen musical "Singin' in
the Rain" were both lost in a fire. Numerous other negatives shot on
unstable nitrate stock -- all films before 1950 were shot on nitrate
-- disintegrated, and others have just been lost over the years.</LD>
<LD>   Add "Sunset Boulevard," Billy Wilder's landmark 1950 drama about
Hollywood, and "Roman Holiday," William Wyler's delightful 1953
romantic comedy for which Audrey Hepburn won a best actress Oscar, to
the list of films whose original negatives are long gone.</LD>
<LD>   Phil Murphy, senior vice president of operations for Paramount
Television, doesn't know what happened to the negatives of those
films. But when the studio began its preservation program in the
mid-1980s, Murphy discovered that they were missing and that, with
the passage of time, any trails that might have led to them are cold.
"Remember, our industry didn't recognize the true deep value of the
library in the early days before television because, once something
opened theatrically then there was no after market. It was a
different industry."</LD>
<TE>   So when it came time to do the DVDs of "Sunset Boulevard" and
"Roman Holiday," which arrive in stores today, Paramount not only
wanted the films to be restored for the digital editions but also to
have new negatives created for both titles. (Since the inception of
the studio's protection program, original materials pertaining to
films Paramount owns have been preserved in stable conditions to
prevent further deterioration.)</TE>
<TE>   "We would really like to be able to say not only did we do the
absolute best we could do for a DVD release," Murphy says. "We would
also like to be able to say we have created the negative -- call it a
lab original negative -- that puts it back on film virtually in the
same condition it existed when the movies opened theatrically in the
early '50s. For all the hoopla about electronic restoration and
preservation that may be out there today, there still remains nothing
that gives us the same confidence levels as a 35-millimeter motion
picture film for preservation into the next 100 years."</TE>
<TE>   Though Paramount has no plans to re-release the films
theatrically, the new film prints of "Sunset Boulevard" and "Roman
Holiday" will be unveiled next week at the Museum of Modern Art in
New York.</TE>
<TE>   The best original materials Paramount had on both titles were
third-generation duplicate negatives, which meant they were three
generations away from the original camera negative and probably were
made some 30 years ago. Paramount worked with four digital vendors on
each movie, making tests for nearly a year, to see if the film could
be restored digitally and then scanned back into film.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to be honest with you: We came very close to abandoning
the project," Murphy says. "Sometimes it looked like video. The look
just wasn't correct, the whole texture of the image wasn't right.
Finally, at kind of the 11th hour, we seriously were contemplating
pulling the plug."</TE>
<TE>   Then Murphy saw a test by Lowry Digital Images that impressed him.</TE>
<TE>   "We focused on [Lowry]. It took another year to get to the point
of actually delivering the finished project. We are still getting the
last reels on film out the door."</TE>
<TE>   The result for both films is absolutely stunning on DVD: The
black-and-white images are crisp, the detail is amazing, and the
contrasts among blacks, grays and whites are beautifully rendered.
The films look as if they were made yesterday.</TE>
<TE>   John Lowry of Lowry Digital says the problem is that the more
popular the title, the more work is needed to fix it.</TE>
<TE>   "Successful movies tend to have too few protections made when they
made the movie," Lowry says. "They didn't made enough duplicates, and
they wore them out."</TE>
<TE>   "Roman Holiday" was a bigger challenge than "Sunset Boulevard."
"Frankly, a lot of shots are out of focus," Lowry says. There are a
lot of weird opticals. It wasn't well lit."</TE>
<TE>   Lowry's company used 270 computers to restore the movies. "We tell
the computers what the parameters are in this particular movie," he
says. "It is all a series of mathematical calculations. If you think
of it, we have more computer power working on these movies than
existed in the world 30 years ago."</TE>
<TE>   The first step was getting rid of the films' jitter and weave.
"Every film camera introduces a bit of jitter and weave just by the
nature of the sprocket holes," Lowry says. "If it has been printed
two or three [times], there is a little bit more movement introduced
with each printing stage. Flicker is more a function of age."</TE>
<TE>   Then the grain -- the sand-like or granular texture noticeable in
prints -- was reduced so Lowry's computers could clean the image and
get out the dirt, flaws and scratches from the prints.</TE>
<TE>   For the last several months, Lowry has been working with Paramount
to get the right tones of grays and blacks in each film. With old
black-and-white films, Lowry says, the black tones tend to become
crushed.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't see enough detail. The blacks are too black. We did
some software to stretch that out to help us see the black a little
bit better. We ended up using that software more on 'Roman Holiday'
than 'Sunset Boulevard,' " he says.</TE>
<TE>   "We tried our best to maintain what we believe the original
artistic intent was. We believe that is very, very important in any
restoration work."</TE>
<TE>   While Lowry was working on the images, John Polito at Audio
Mechanics restored the soundtrack, transferring an optical track
negative to a 24-bit digital tape. He eliminated pops, clicks and
crackles; certain sections were equalized to smooth anomalies created
in editing.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the restored film, the digital edition of "Sunset
Boulevard" ($25) includes commentary by Ed Sikov, author of "On
Sunset Boulevard: The Life and Times of Billy Wilder" (Hyperion,
1999); "The Making of Sunset Boulevard" documentary; a Hollywood
location map; photo galleries; "The Music of Sunset Boulevard";
script pages of Wilder's original morgue prologue, which was cut
after previews; and 3 1/2 minutes of surviving footage from the
original negative.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD of the restored "Roman Holiday" ($25) also features
"Remembering Roman Holiday" documentary, "Restoring Roman Holiday,"
photo galleries and three trailers.</TE>

<AU>Mark Swed</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Part of the intrigue of attending a new production of "Tales of
Hoffmann" is not knowing exactly what you will get. The opera was
left unfinished at Offenbach's death in 1880 -- or, more accurately,
there was a finished, compromised version that had spoken dialogue
instead of recitatives and a not-quite-finished grand-opera revision
that Offenbach wanted all along. Which means every performing version
is a patch job, including recitatives and numbers by other composers
as well as material taken from other Offenbach scores.</LD>
<LD>   Modern musicology has no intention of letting up on the process,
most recently with Fritz Oeser and Michael Kaye competing to see who
could get more bits from Offenbach sketches into their editions, and
creating a work of Wagnerian length, if not scope. Kaye's additions,
which were unveiled by Los Angeles Opera for its 1988 production,
seem to be the ones that have caught on for now.</LD>
<LD>   Even so, every director likes to pick and choose, which is what
Marta Domingo has done for a new L.A. Opera staging, a co-production
with the Kirov Opera and the Washington Opera that arrived at the
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion on Sunday night.</LD>
<TE>   "Tales of Hoffmann" relates a poet's mad quest for love. It is
nothing new in opera, but the way Offenbach set out to do it is. In
what now looks remarkably like proto-postmodernism, the composer and
his librettist, Jules Barbier, put E.T.A. Hoffmann, an extravagant
19th century German writer, into his own fantastical stories. Ever
more desperate for love, Hoffmann maniacally and ineptly pursues a
mechanical doll, a consumptive singer and a Venetian courtesan, his
steps everywhere dogged by the devil in different disguises. Sunk in
drunken, nihilistic despair, he finally returns to his poetic muse,
oddly refreshed by his quixotic quests.</TE>
<TE>   As Domingo has shown in previous productions for husband Placido's
company, she likes to add her own twists to stories. She doesn't
update, but she fiddles in other ways, especially when she can
exploit flamboyant melodrama. She gets a chance to do that here in
the tale of Antonia, the dying singer. Offenbach intended it to be
the middle act. But it wound up at the end until Oeser and Kaye found
enough material to make the Venetian act a substantial, cynical
conclusion. Domingo returns to the old, more sentimental ways.</TE>
<TE>   Mostly, though, what the director, a former singer, likes to do is
give singers plenty of leeway. Sometimes that's a favor to them, and
sometimes it isn't. Hoffmann has a large cast with several fine
performers, so she wins more than she loses this time around.</TE>
<TE>   Of the three soprano roles, Sumi Jo, as the mechanical doll,
Olympia, is the most spectacular. Although her slapstick routine
doesn't rise any further than silent-film hamming, her coloratura is
so amazingly spot-on that this sometimes mechanical-seeming singer
proved a virtuosic self-parodist, with only the cutesy curtain call
going too far.</TE>
<TE>   Milena Kitic, a mezzo-soprano pushing into soprano territory, is
voluptuously seductive Giulietta in the Venetian act, and it is a
pity that the full extent of the Kaye findings were not included in
this scene, although 3 1/2 hours in the theater is plenty long
already. In the Antonia tale, it starts to feel very long indeed, as
Domingo does away with irony by allowing (encouraging?) Andrea Rost
to squeeze the last bit of emotion from the dying singer.</TE>
<TE>   Provided with a bit more subtlety, Samuel Ramey's portrayal of the
four devil characters might have been just right. As it is, he
remains his usual commanding vocal and theatrical presence, even if
it takes him longer to fully warm up than it once did. And he shows
himself perfectly capable of wry humor when not asked to overdo it.
Marcus Haddock proves a reliable, if one-dimensional, Hoffmann, and
again he might have been more convincing if he were allowed a more
sophisticated sense of parody, particularly in the lunging tavern
scenes that frame the opera.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Fedderly, in small character roles, is very amusing as
Antonia's old, deaf servant, while Robert Tear is a delight as
Spalanzani, Olympia's inventor. Elizabeth Batton, Hoffmann's muse who
turns into his sidekick might be two different singers, awkward in
the former role, convincing in the latter.</TE>
<TE>   Scenically the production is unsettling. Giovanni Agostinucci has
a taste for the tasteless, which he indulges mostly happily in a
campy Venetian pavilion, but the surrealistic eyeball backdrop of
Spalanzani's laboratory looks forced, while the German scenes (the
tavern and Antonia's Munich apartment) are gloomy. A bit a of silly
Romanticism that actually works, however, is Hoffmann's final,
muse-inspired apotheosis in heaven.</TE>
<TE>   There is a lot musically to hold together, and Emmanuel Villaume,
the conductor, gets full credit for his firm control over the long
evening. The chorus copes.</TE>

<LD>'Botticelli Blue Skies'</LD>
<LD>   An American in Florence</LD>
<LD>   Merrill Joan Gerber</LD>
<TE>   University of Wisconsin Press: 288 pp., $26.95</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Merrill Joan Gerber, who teaches creative writing at Caltech in
Pasadena, is the quintessential reluctant traveler: one for whom the
prospect of roaming translates not into visions of adventure and
frolicking good times but into anxiety of the unknown and a longing
for life's daily rhythms. Yet, as she recounts in her delightful
travel memoir, "Botticelli Blue Skies," she is prepared to relinquish
her distaste of roving as she embarks on what turns out to be a
life-altering three-month sojourn accompanying her history-professor
husband and his group of 38 college students who have signed up for a
semester in Florence, Italy.</TE>
<TE>   The entourage arrives in Tuscany, sets up housekeeping, figures
out the bus system and does its best to see the important tourist
sites while learning to live as Italians do. For these transplanted
Americans, even the simplest tasks -- navigating the grocery store,
figuring out the money, lighting the stove -- become both precarious
and funny.</TE>
<TE>   Detailing the day-to-day happenings of their stay, Gerber
illustrates how she eventually makes peace with the exotic, learns to
see beauty in that which initially frightens and uncovers the dogged
resourcefulness all good travelers must have, enthusiastic at heart
or not.</TE>
<TE>   Most enjoyable are the scenes of quotidian Italian life, like the
chore of washing clothes: "Unlike my American washing machine, which
agitates in pit-bull furor, shaking the dirt out of the clothes, then
spinning them wildly as if wringing their necks in revenge, this
Italian version gives our clothes a gentle half-turn and then pauses
for what seems three minutes before it gently shimmies them about
again for a few seconds," she writes. "A cluster of soap bubbles
appears in the round glass window and then vanishes while the clothes
rest or gather strength for the next little jiggle." The predicaments
are never-ending: Once the clothes are washed, how to hang them out
on a clothesline that's five stories high? And then, what to do when
a piece of purple underwear flies free and lands on a lower line,
accessible only through another tenant's apartment? Depicted with
keen perception, the tale illustrates the way travel wakes us up from
our daily lives and compels us to see existence anew.</TE>
<TE>   Having failed to study her Italian diligently before the trip,
Gerber is hampered by her inability to communicate verbally, but is
ingenious in surmounting this obstacle.</TE>
<TE>   Trying to buy baking powder at the grocery store, she leads a
clerk to the packaged cake section and tries to indicate that she
wants something to make a cake rise. "To do this, I lift a cake over
my head. This is becoming a little like a game show. He cocks his
head as if trying to think of an answer. Then: the light bulb smile.
Does he have the answer?" (He does.)</TE>
<TE>   There are moments of human connection despite language and
cultural differences, as well as times when the emotional edge of
travel and discomfort have rubbed raw any sense of openness for new
experiences. In the Vatican Museum, for example, Gerber hears "the
thunderous hoof beats of thousands of tourists behind me" and after a
grueling day of museum madness, she declares she's suffering from
"Overload Art Syndrome," a condition that makes "the victim want to
hop on a plane and go home."</TE>
<TE>   When frustrated by the Florentine lack of efficiency, she indulges
in arrogant Americanisms, redesigning the laws of Italy: "Bus drivers
will be permitted to sell tickets on the bus to confused tourists
.... Banks and museums will never close their doors upon a whim ....
Flu shots will be made available in a logical manner so that a person
does not have to buy the vaccine and go in search of a needle.
Sidewalks shall be designed larger than ten inches wide." Yet she
retains her ability to be dazzled by the at-times contrary, often
resplendent and even mundane aspects of Italian life.</TE>
<TE>   Handled with subtle humor and disarming honesty, Gerber's
narrative ultimately uncovers a core truth about travel: To surrender
to a place, not the version from one's fantasies but as it really
exists, is the only way to experience it. (In Italy that means uneven
cobblestones, odd rhythms and quaint customs, frustrations and
breathtaking splendor.) And though the adventure may not always be a
comfortable one, even reluctant travelers are welcome to join in.</TE>

<HD>Oddly, opening for Tommy Chong's art show goes according to
script</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gina Piccalo;Ann Conway</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There was something suspiciously rehearsed about the Tommy Chong art
show at Ghettogloss, a new Silver Lake gallery, and it wasn't simply
the fact that nearly every piece could double as a bong. Even the
tattooed locals appeared well-cast.</LD>
<LD>   Actor Michael Perrick stood in the center of the low-ceilinged
gallery amid a modest crowd of neon-haired guests, studying what
appeared to be a glob of melted glass water pipes.</LD>
<LD>   "It's the metaphor that you smoke out of these to get melted,"
said the bald young man who boasted of 34 piercings, 26 of which "are
visible." His friend, actor Doug Savercool, noted, "It reminds me of
my days at the University of Oregon."</LD>
<TE>   Soon, the artist appeared, followed closely by a cameraman, a boom
mike and two hovering producers, filming (what else?) a pilot for
"The Tommy Chong Show," a spoof of the ubiquitous unscripted TV
format.</TE>
<TE>   The Thursday night opening marked Chong's first art exhibit after
years of working at home. Gallery owner Fiora (she goes by only one
name) bristled at the suggestion that Chong staged the exhibit. "This
is a legitimate art opening," she said later. "Having the circus here
is part of Tommy Chong."</TE>
<TE>   In the '70s and '80s, Chong performed as half of the
marijuana-obsessed Cheech and Chong comedy team, and more recently he
played hippie doper Leo on "That '70s Show."</TE>
<TE>   His exhibit, on display through January, features dozens of
hand-carved wooden pipes, colorful water pipes (courtesy of Chong
Glass, the actor's factory in Gardena), photographs of graffiti art
and sandy beaches, and a series of wooden sculptures.</TE>
<TE>   A "habitat" installation in one corner of the room included more
water pipes, a hand-painted guitar, a refrigerator with a sign asking
"Is America going to pot?" and a painting in which a younger Chong is
transforming into a giant koi as his former partner Cheech Marin
stands over him.</TE>
<TE>   As lyrics by the 1970s funk band Parliament filled the room ("Put
a glide in your stride, a dip in your hip and come on up to the
Mothership!"), Chong seemed to enjoy resurrecting elements of his
memorable character.</TE>
<TE>   When asked to explain the concept for his artwork, he said,
"That's the trouble with potheads. We have a short attention span."
Then he translated the "alien messages" in the graffiti he had
photographed. "They want peace and love and prosperity," he said.</TE>

<TE>   Three voices of justice</TE>
<TE>   In a darkened ballroom where flickering white tapers created a
vigil-like ambience, Human Rights Watch recognized three people for
their commitment to justice: Meena Seshu of India, an HIV/AIDs
activist who works to stem the epidemic in Maharashtra state;
Souleymane Guengueng of Chad, who has sought to bring former Chadian
dictator Hissene Habre to justice; and Sanar Yurdatapan of Turkey, an
outspoken opponent of his country's limits on freedom of expression.</TE>
<TE>   "In these very challenging times, it is important for us to
reaffirm our belief that every human being deserves a life without
fear of terror or persecution," Sid Sheinberg, co-chairman of Human
Rights' California Committee South, told guests at the Nov. 19
"Voices of Justice" dinner in the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel. The
honorees "have spoken out and acted boldly for victims of human
rights abuse in their countries."</TE>
<TE>   After receiving awards from celebrity presenters who included
Samuel L. Jackson, Julia Ormand, Ben Stiller and Noah Wyle -- the
honorees spoke of the crises in their countries.</TE>
<TE>   "What we face in India today is a growing wave of violence against
people who are affected by HIV/AIDS," Seeshu said. "The violence of
stigma, the violence of a judgmental attitude."</TE>
<TE>   Said Yurdatapan: "In my country, you can be persecuted for any
number of ridiculous things. If you criticize the army ... you will
be tried in military court. If you criticize the ban on head scarves
or sing a song in Kurdish, it will cause you a lot of trouble.
Republishing a banned article may send you to prison."</TE>
<TE>   And Guengueng -- who had been imprisoned for his activism -- told
the crowd, "Worst of all was the mental torture. We were forbidden to
pray to our God. And every night, the political police took away
prisoners who never returned." Eventually, he was released, and with
the help of Human Rights Watch, built the case against Habre.</TE>
<TE>   "Justice -- free and fair and uncorrupted -- is possible," he
said.</TE>

<HD>Japanese drum is a sight to see as well as hear</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>What comes to mind when you think of a drum? You probably think of a
musical instrument. But what about a drum as a work of art? The drum
shown here is both.</LD>
<LD>   This kotsuzumi (drum) is played during performances of a type of
Japanese theater called Noh. It has a hollow, hourglass-shaped body
of cherrywood and two drumheads. Cords tie the drumheads together.
Lacquer, produced from the resin of a sumac tree, is built up in
layers on the wood. The drum is decorated with gold in an overall
design of peony flowers.</LD>
<LD>   Playing an instrument like this is more difficult than it looks.
The drummer rests the instrument on his right shoulder, grips the
cords with the left hand and strikes the front drumhead with his
right. The drum makes different sounds depending on whether the
player tightens or loosens his grip on the cords and how he strikes
the drum.</LD>
<TE>   Find a musical instrument and look at how it is designed. In what
ways could you redesign it to be a work of art? What materials would
you use? What kinds of decorations would you put on it?</TE>
<TE>   You can see this drum and other decorated instruments, carved wood
masks and elegant costumes in the exhibition "Miracles and Mischief:
Noh and Kyogen Theater in Japan" through Feb. 2 at the Los Angeles
County Museum of Art. A family guide to the exhibition is also
available. For more information call (323) 857-6000 or visit

<DH>Chrome Hearts peddles a rocker-chic line -- for those who
can afford it.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Let's say you're the 18-year-old son of a head-banging, bat-eating
rocker, and you've become the star of a reality show on cable TV.
Your lifestyle is a seamless melding of luxury and profanity. Where,
exactly, would you go to find a $385 plush terry bathrobe with a
two-word obscenity embroidered on the sleeve?</LD>
<LD>   Chrome Hearts, naturally, a business that shuns publicity the way
some of its famous customers crave it.</LD>
<LD>   There isn't a sign or a doorknob outside the company headquarters
on leafy Mansfield Avenue in Hollywood. Founder Richard Stark likes
it that way; he says he doesn't want anyone to know the company is
there. This attitude has resulted in the kind of image -- part
nose-thumbing, part exclusivity -- that has helped make Chrome Hearts
the rock 'n' roll luxe lifestyle purveyor for rebel yellers such as
Cher, Steven Tyler and Elton John for the past 14 years.</LD>
<TE>   The company produces cashmere sweaters, Egyptian cotton bedsheets,
crystal vases, chunky platinum necklaces, sterling-silver ice cream
scoops and custom leather car interiors, all emblazoned with Gothic
crosses, daggers and fleur-de-lis symbols. Prices range from $50 for
a T-shirt to $695 for sunglasses; $3,300 for stretch leather pants to
$160,000 for a handmade ebony dining table.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea was to be like Hermes or Brooks Brothers -- a classic,
lifestyle company for the 21st century and beyond," says Stark, 42,
who is slouched on a curvaceous black leather couch embellished with
the same cross-shaped appliques he sports on his leather pants. A red
"Merle Haggard" baseball cap covers his long, curly brown hair and
shades his face, which has sideburns snaking down either side. Stark
oozes the kind of aloof cool of a kid who cuts classes and doesn't
care what the principal thinks.</TE>
<TE>   He and his wife, Laurie Stark, 39, who is also his business
partner, are the first to admit they don't engage in the kind of
behavior that is reflexive for most designers. They rarely advertise
or talk to the media. They don't have a press kit. And they can be
prickly and secretive, reluctant even to mention where they live
(Malibu) or how many people they employ (around 200).</TE>
<TE>   But after inking a licensing deal with the Rolling Stones earlier
this month to produce jewelry inspired by the band's Andy
Warhol-designed tongue-and-lips logo, the Starks agreed to be
interviewed in the airy upstairs room of their offices. Dressed in
creased blue jeans and a filmy black blouse with a camisole
underneath, Laurie drapes her legs over the arm of a chair. White
rays filter through the skylights and land on a plump leather chair
and a hefty ebony dining table. Like nearly all Chrome Hearts wares,
the furniture is handcrafted in a factory at the rear of the
block-long complex. Above the table hangs a large, somewhat
disturbing photo by a childhood friend of Richard Stark's of what
appears to be a pile of body parts.</TE>
<TE>   Chrome Hearts was conceived ("one sedated eve," as Stark is fond
of saying) as a leather apparel company in 1988 by Stark and his
housemates Leonard Kamhout, a silversmith, and John Bowman, who
manufactured and sold belts. At the time, Stark was representing
tanneries and selling hides to manufacturers. He also has a
background in carpentry.</TE>
<TE>   At first, the trio made leather pieces for Harley-riding friends.
They got their break when they were asked by a producer pal to make
leather outfits for "Chopper Chicks in Zombietown" (1989), a B-grade
comedy horror flick (and one of Billy Bob Thornton's first films)
about eight biker babes who save a town from zombies. One of the
actors in the film knew Sex Pistols lead guitarist Steve Jones and
introduced the band members to the guys at Chrome Hearts. "Steve
Jones introduced us to the Cult, the Cult introduced us to Heart,
Heart introduced us to Aerosmith and on and on," says Stark, who grew
up in Utica, N.Y., where, he says, perhaps for effect, he liked to
spend his time riding his motorcycle through cemeteries.</TE>
<TE>   But it was Tommy Perse, owner of the influential Maxfield
boutique, who gave Chrome Hearts a meaningful retail boost. In 1991,
Stark took a motorcycle jacket and a pair of leather chaps to Perse,
who introduced the Prada and Yohji Yamamoto to L.A., among others. He
bought the leather goods with baroque silver buttons on the spot.
Soon, Bergdorf Goodman and Browns London opened in-store boutiques,
and Vogue ran a spread of supermodels in couture gowns and Chrome
Hearts motorcycle jackets.</TE>
<TE>   "Things rapidly progressed and his name got out there very
quickly," Perse says. "It was good exposure for him and the perfect
product for Maxfield because it was a blend of quality and edgy rock
n' roll, which was pretty new at the time." In 1992, Chrome Hearts
was named Accessory Designer of the Year by the Council of Fashion
Designers of America. Stark and his partners were such unlikely
designers that they didn't even know what the council was and mistook
several calls from the organization for telemarketing calls.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after accepting the award in New York City, the partners
had a falling out. Stark bought out Kamhout and Bowman, and continued
to expand the Chrome Hearts label.</TE>
<TE>   Chrome Hearts clothing is a favorite of MTV's Osbournes and is
worn by Eddie Murphy in the film "I Spy." Cher, a friend of the
Starks, is rarely seen in public without a piece by Chrome Hearts--a
jacket, maybe, or a piece of jewelry -- and supermodels Gisele and
Travis are pictured on the cover of the October issue of W magazine
wearing armloads of the label's chunky jewelry.</TE>
<TE>   The Starks design the line together. Laurie is a graduate of the
Fashion Institute of Design &amp; Merchandising who in the 1980s designed
the swimwear line Beten Gav, which was carried by Fred Segal. The two
met at a fish market in Malibu. They have been together 14 years and
have an 11-year-old daughter whom Richard Stark calls "his most
perfect design."</TE>
<TE>   "She's made us grow up," Laurie Stark says, although Richard has
been known to fetch the child from school on a motorcycle and have
her change into her leathers for the ride home.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Maxfield's Perse opened a Chrome Hearts boutique in
a converted ironworks shop just across from his store on Robertson
Boulevard so he could showcase more of the merchandise, he says. Like
the factory, the store has no sign but is recognizable by its
imposing black iron gates. Inside, the cabinetry, designed by Stark,
is ebony with sterling silver hardware. There are also Chrome Hearts
stores in New York, Osaka and Tokyo, all owned by the Starks.</TE>
<TE>   Chrome Hearts has been popular in Japan since Comme des Garcons
designer Rei Kawakubo showcased pieces in the windows of her store in
Tokyo's Aoyama shopping district in the early 1990s. Last year, the
Starks launched a quarterly Chrome Hearts magazine there. Much of the
photography in the magazine is done by Laurie, who is also working on
a book called "White Wall" that's a compilation of photographs of
folks who visit the Chrome Hearts offices.</TE>
<TE>   Chrome Hearts continues to meet demands for custom objects: It
recently made a leather remote-control holder, a leather magazine
rack and a sterling silver stethoscope, and the Starks were recently
approached to design the interior of a Gulfstream plane.</TE>
<TE>   Now that the label has been around for 14 years, it appeals to
more than just a rocker crowd, Perse says. "The product really suits
a broad spectrum of people. We're selling to rock 'n' roll stars
sure, but also to lawyers, accountants and housewives."</TE>
<TE>   Not that the Starks haven't got plenty of rock 'n' roll left in
them. Earlier this month, they partied with the Stones at Trader
Vic's, where the Chrome Hearts for the Rolling Stones jewelry line
debuted. The next night, the Starks took in the Stones concert at the
Wiltern.</TE>
<TE>   Let's face it, said Richard Stark, "the best part of the job is
great concert tickets."</TE>

<LD>As if to underscore the malaise that has settled over the made-for-TV
movie, the most-watched film Sunday night -- when CBS' heavily
promoted "Martin and Lewis" faced ABC's fact-based "The Pennsylvania
Miners' Story" -- was a rerun of "The Santa Clause."</LD>
<LD>   The holiday film starring Tim Allen flew off with more than 17
million viewers on ABC, based on Nielsen Media Research estimates. It
was the biggest audience for a movie telecast this season.</LD>
<LD>   ABC's "Miners' Story," rushed into production in time for the
rating sweeps, averaged 13.9 million viewers versus 13.2 million for
the biographical "Martin and Lewis" -- CBS' highest-rated Sunday
movie this season. Both those numbers, however, are less than
spectacular. With movie ratings down, there has been speculation that
CBS may replace its long-running Sunday franchise with series. NBC
countered with the theatrical release "Runaway Bride," drawing nearly
12 million viewers.</LD>
<TE>   In addition to "The Santa Clause," Sunday's other standout was
"The Simpsons," which tallied 17.5 million viewers, its biggest
audience since March 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The WB also posted its highest Sunday ever with the perennial "The
Wizard of Oz," with an estimated 7.6 million viewers.</TE>

<LD>Maria and Alfonso were taking a nature walk with Uncle Ruben. They
were in a section of the San Bernardino Mountains that is heavily
wooded with many types of trees. Some of the trees had needle-like
leaves. Others were broad leaves, like oaks and dogwood and sycamore.</LD>
<LD>   "Today we're going to make a nature diary of the many leaves we
see," said Uncle Ruben. "Each of you will tape a leaf into your
notebook and write a few things about each tree. Then you'll have a
diary of every tree you see today."</LD>
<LD>   "Sounds great," said Alfonso.</LD>
<TE>   "What's that big tree, Uncle Ruben?" Maria pointed at a large
black oak tree, full of plump acorns.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a black oak," said Uncle Ruben.</TE>
<TE>   Each child taped the ornate leaf onto a page, and then wrote
"black oak" in bold letters. "Also write a few words about each tree.
What do you know about the oak tree?"</TE>
<TE>   "They have acorns," said Alfonso.</TE>
<TE>   "Right," said Uncle Ruben. "And what can you say about the
acorns?"</TE>
<TE>   Maria said, "The Indian people ate them, right?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," said Uncle Ruben. "So write that in your books."</TE>
<TE>   Alfonso wrote, "Indians ate acorns," next to the leaf in his book.</TE>
<TE>   Maria wrote, "Oaks have acorns, acorns can be edible."</TE>
<TE>   Uncle Ruben then pointed to another large tree, a sugar pine, and
each child taped a pine needle into their book. Alfonso wrote, "Sugar
pine, large cones, Indians ate pine nuts."</TE>
<TE>   By the end of the day, Maria and Alfonso had more than 20 leaves
taped in their books, with descriptions.</TE>
<TE>   "Wasn't this a great way to learn about nature?" asked Uncle
Ruben.</TE>
<TE>   Maria and Alfonso didn't respond -- they were too busy flipping
through the pages of their notebooks, comparing what they had
collected.</TE>

<HD>Success skews 'Osbournes' equation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Scott Sandell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Ozzman cometh bleeping back tonight, and in the words of his song
"Mama, I'm Coming Home": "Times have changed and times are strange /
Here I come, but I ain't the same."</LD>
<LD>   That's what happens when you have a hit as big as "The Osbournes,"
which drew record audiences on MTV and has begotten a wave of
merchandise ranging from a line of underwear to an upcoming DVD
package of the first season.</LD>
<LD>   It's also what makes the opening of the second season tonight at
10:30 a bit risky, for the Osbournes have moved from semi-obscurity
to overexposed celebrity, traveling in the circles of the president
of the United States, the queen of England and Greta Van Susteren.</LD>
<TE>   Make no mistake: "The Osbournes" still rocks. But, like Ozzy, it
doesn't rock quite as hard.</TE>
<TE>   Part of that is because (a) we already know the basics of what has
happened to the family, thanks to media saturation, and (b) the first
episode doesn't concentrate as much on relatively simple domestic
life as last season's escapades did.</TE>
<TE>   A major key to the show's success was how mundane problems were
reflected in the fun-house mirror of the Osbourne household. Ozzy,
wife Sharon, daughter Kelly and son Jack used to deal mainly with
cleaning up after the dogs, getting the neighbors to turn down their
music at 2 a.m. and other situations that tested the coping skills of
a guy who once bit a bat on stage and urinated on the Alamo.</TE>
<TE>   Now Ozzy and Sharon seem more preoccupied with what to wear to the
White House and how to deal with Kelly's singing career. It's still
weirdly funny to see the leader of the free world acknowledge the
Prince of Darkness, and Jack displays some wonderful sibling rivalry
when Kelly appears on the MTV Movie Awards. But such situations
aren't as grounded in viewers' lives as before, and they smack of the
shopworn formula of putting sitcom characters in new settings just to
spice things up.</TE>
<TE>   Next week's episode provides a different dilemma, when Sharon's
colon cancer hits home. Despite some bittersweet and outright
hilarious moments, there's a pronounced somberness as Sharon goes
through chemo, and Ozzy is stuck on tour and plunging into despair.</TE>
<TE>   Although MTV says that the second episode doesn't represent a
permanent shift in tone, you have to wonder how "The Osbournes," as a
series, will adapt. And maybe that, more than anything, will keep
viewers on this crazy train.</TE>

<LD>Carson investigation -- A story in Saturday's California section
erroneously stated that former Carson Councilman Manny Ontal had been
arrested in connection with a federal corruption probe. Ontal
approached federal authorities about corruption in Carson and agreed
to work undercover while they investigated. He agreed to plead guilty
to one count of accepting a $5,000 payoff from a city contractor and
of failing to report $33,000 in consultant's income on his tax
return.</LD>

<HD>State Says Wall St. Penalties Too Lax</HD>
<DH>Top securities regulator argues that firms should pay
higher fines to settle alleged conflicts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Walter Hamilton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>California's top securities regulator complained Monday that the
fines being sought from brokerages in a proposed settlement over
analyst conflicts are far too low -- the first time an official has
publicly broken ranks with his counterparts on how much Wall Street
should be penalized for its alleged bull-market sins.</LD>
<LD>   Demetrios Boutris, commissioner of the state's Department of
Corporations, said every firm should be forced to pay at least $100
million to resolve multiple investigations of whether stock analysts
dished out tainted advice in the late 1990s.</LD>
<LD>   State and federal regulators are demanding the fines in talks
aimed at reaching a "global" settlement with a dozen investment
banks. In sessions with individual firms Friday, Monday and today,
the bulk of the companies are being asked to pay $25 million to $100
million, sources said. Citigroup Inc. and Credit Suisse First Boston
would have to pay considerably larger fines.</LD>
<TE>   The proposed fines let the firms "think they can justify their bad
behavior as simply the cost of doing business," Boutris said. "Bad
behavior should be punished."</TE>
<TE>   In May, Merrill Lynch agreed to pay $100 million to resolve a
similar probe by New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer. That amount
should serve as a floor for future settlements, Boutris said.</TE>
<TE>   It is rare for an official to publicly question whether his
counterparts are going too lightly in settlement talks. The comments
by Boutris are noteworthy because California is co-chairing a task
force of states examining the analyst issue, and because California's
size forces other regulators to consider its position.</TE>
<TE>   California has lobbied other regulators to raise their demands in
a series of phone calls and e-mails in recent days.</TE>
<TE>   In an e-mail Saturday, obtained from a state regulator, a
California official warned other states that fining firms less than
$100 million risks "opening the regulators to the charge that some
banks are getting off easy." The e-mail was written by William
Kenefick, chief deputy commissioner of the California Department of
Corporations.</TE>
<TE>   Despite its protests, California is not considering withdrawing
from the coordinated settlement or taking steps to derail it, said
Andre Pineda, deputy commissioner of the department.</TE>
<TE>   Other regulators disagree with California, Pineda said.</TE>
<TE>   Some states believe California's actions are political posturing,
regulators said.</TE>
<TE>   "What's the point of this?" asked an official of another state.</TE>
<TE>   In a conference call Saturday, California officials told
regulators in other states that "the evidence doesn't matter" and
that the firms should be fined $100 million regardless of facts, one
participant said.</TE>
<TE>   In his e-mail, Kenefick wrote, "State of evidence/proof at this
time is irrelevant."</TE>
<TE>   "A number of regulators are flabbergasted by the notion that a law
enforcement official would say such a thing," said a regulator from
another state.</TE>
<TE>   California's point is that the Merrill settlement already has set
the floor and that any analyst conflicts warrant a $100-million fine,
Pineda said. If government officials ceased negotiations and finished
their probes, the firms would be forced to pay far greater sums, he
said.</TE>

<LD>Shares of Cendant Corp. sank as much as 9.5% in trading Monday on a
report -- denied by the company -- that the Securities and Exchange
Commission added the real-estate and travel firm to its investigation
of Homestore Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Cendant shares recovered to close down 44 cents, or 3.5%, at
$12.26 on the New York Stock Exchange.</LD>
<LD>   "There is no basis for, nor is there any indication of an
investigation by the [SEC] or other authorities into Cendant with
regard to the alleged activities at Homestore.com," Cendant said in
response to a story published in the New York Times.</LD>
<TE>   Homestore, an Internet real-estate firm in Westlake Village, has
been under investigation by the SEC and Justice Department for a year
on allegations that it inflated revenue, and an investor group headed
by CalPERS has filed suit.</TE>

<HD>SEC Disclosure Charges Settled</HD>
<DH>Agency targets three companies in the first enforcement of
its rule requiring equal access to key information.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Friedman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three companies Monday settled federal charges that they disclosed
key information to selected analysts or big investors, in the first
cases involving a 2-year-old rule that bans such practices.</LD>
<LD>   But the Securities and Exchange Commission, in announcing the
charges under its so-called Reg FD, fined just one of the companies
-- triggering criticism from some experts who said the settlements
may have little deterrent effect.</LD>
<LD>   The SEC said the cases against software maker Siebel Systems Inc.,
defense contractor Raytheon Co. and Internet security specialist
Secure Computing Corp. involved the disclosure of company information
to small groups of analysts and/or investors, without giving it to
the public at the same time.</LD>
<TE>   That practice was banned in 2000 when the SEC adopted Reg FD, or
"Fair Disclosure." Critics said the rule could stifle the flow of
information to the market.</TE>
<TE>   In the cases announced Monday, the three firms neither admitted
nor denied the allegations, but promised to adhere to Reg FD. San
Mateo, Calif.-based Siebel also agreed to pay a $250,000 civil
penalty.</TE>
<TE>   "Most companies have been trying hard to conform to the
regulation, but this combination of cases indicates that the
commission is quite serious about enforcement," said SEC Commissioner
Harvey Goldschmid, who helped craft the rule.</TE>
<TE>   However, some observers called the settlements little more than a
slap on the wrist. "In the scheme of things, penalties don't get much
lighter," said Henry Hu, a law professor at the University of Texas.
"Instead of enhancing enforcement this might actually inhibit it."</TE>
<TE>   Others disagreed. "The next time these companies violate Reg FD
the sanctions could be very significant," said Jonathan Macey, a law
professor at Cornell University. "They're on notice, and so are CEOs
and investor relations people elsewhere."</TE>
<TE>   Siebel, which reported operating income of $13.1 million in the
third quarter, said the fine won't affect its finances.</TE>
<TE>   Fines were a point of contention at the SEC. Commissioners Paul
Atkins and Cynthia Glassman dissented on the Siebel ruling, seeking a
smaller fine or none at all; Commissioner Roel Campos dissented in
the other cases, saying Raytheon and Secure should have been fined.</TE>
<TE>   In the Siebel case, CEO Tom Siebel gave an upbeat outlook for the
firm Nov. 5, 2001, at an invitation-only tech conference in Carlsbad,
Calif., hosted by Goldman Sachs &amp; Co., the SEC said. The remarks
contrasted with a bleak outlook in Siebel's earnings report three
weeks earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The day of the conference, Siebel's stock jumped 20% on heavy
volume. Scott W. Friestad, assistant director of the SEC's Washington
enforcement division, said the agency was "able to trace trading in
the stock to people who were sitting in the audience."</TE>
<TE>   Siebel said Monday that more than 200 people attended the
conference, including reporters, and that its CEO was unaware that
the event was not being Webcast. If it had been broadcast on the
Internet, the firm would not have run afoul of Reg FD because the
information would have been available to all.</TE>
<TE>   In the Raytheon case, Chief Financial Officer Franklyn Caine
allegedly gave earnings guidance to analysts in one-on-one phone
conversations in mid-February and early March 2001.</TE>
<TE>   According to the SEC, Caine helped guide Wall Street's consensus
estimate for the first quarter of 2001 down to 27 cents a share from
31 cents, without sharing that guidance with investors in general.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Lexington, Mass.-based Raytheon said it "remains
committed to full and fair disclosure to all investors."</TE>
<TE>   The Raytheon case has been long rumored. It took until now to
bring, in part, because the SEC wanted to bundle several Reg FD cases
to enhance the deterrent message, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Secure Computing's CEO John McNulty allegedly told two
portfolio managers about a contract with a large computer networking
company on March 6 and early March 7, before the news was disclosed
after the market's close March 7, the SEC said.</TE>
<TE>   "The matter is closed," the San Jose-based company said.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC also looked into Reg FD charges against Motorola Inc., but
said it decided against taking action because a company executive got
legal advice before starting one-on-one talks with analysts. Though
"wrong," the advice was "obtained in good faith," Friestad said.</TE>

<HD>Calif. Court Limits Piracy Suits</HD>
<DH>State Supreme Court ruling on jurisdiction may set a
precedent that could be followed by other states.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maura Dolan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Limiting the entertainment industry's ability to combat piracy, the
California Supreme Court ruled Monday that California companies
cannot bring lawsuits here against many out-of-state defendants
operating on the Internet.</LD>
<LD>   The state high court, in a case involving a trade secret dispute,
held 4 to 3 that a California trade association for the DVD and movie
industries cannot file suit in California against a Texas computer
engineer who organized a Web site containing software that could be
used for pirating copyrighted motion pictures on DVDs.</LD>
<LD>   The decision was hailed as a victory for Internet users and small
Internet businesses because it may spare them from being forced to
travel out of state to defend lawsuits based on their Web sites.</LD>
<TE>   When defendants do not show up in court, default judgments are
often handed down that force them to remove the disputed material
from the sites.</TE>
<TE>   "People who use the Internet as a source of information win in
this case," said Ann Brick, a staff attorney for the American Civil
Liberties Foundation of Northern California. "It means that courts
are not going to be issuing default judgments that make information
not available on the Internet simply because the defendants did not
have the resources to come to court and raise a valid defense."</TE>
<TE>   A lawyer for the corporate plaintiff in the case complained that
the ruling will force businesses to bring lawsuits in many different
states and countries to protect their trade secrets from being
dispersed on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   "It cuts back on the ability of states to protect their citizens
from harm over the Internet," said Jeffrey Kessler, who represented a
California-based trade group for movie and DVD companies.</TE>
<TE>   Matthew Pavlovich, the computer engineer in Texas, cannot be sued
in California because his move to post the software for unscrambling
DVD encryption technology was not targeted specifically at
California, the court majority decided.</TE>
<TE>   Knowledge that a misappropriation of trade secrets might harm
business in California is not enough to give California courts
jurisdiction over the matter, even though the Internet's reach has no
state borders, the court said.</TE>
<TE>   Pavlovich, who began operating the Web site while in college in
Indiana, can be sued only in Indiana or in Texas, where he now lives,
the court said.</TE>
<TE>   "The evidence in the record fails to show that Pavlovich expressly
aimed his tortious conduct at or intentionally targeted California,"
Justice Janice Rogers Brown wrote for the court. Justices Joyce L.
Kennard, Kathryn Mickle Werdegar and Carlos R. Moreno joined the
ruling.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit was brought by the DVD Copy Control Assn., a nonprofit
trade association created by the movie and DVD industries to
administer licensing of an encryption technology to protect DVDs
against unauthorized copying.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit, which named Pavlovich and 20 other people, alleged
that a resident of Norway posted a program for defeating the
encryption technology in 1999. About the same time, the suit said,
the same information appeared on the Web site operated by Pavlovich.
Finally, Web sites in at least 11 states and 11 countries posted the
program directly or provided links to where it appeared, according to
the suit.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Marvin R. Baxter, who wrote the court's dissent, said
California industries should be allowed to sue Pavlovich here because
he knew that his actions would hurt the California movie industry and
computer industry.</TE>
<TE>   Observing that the lawsuit was filed against people distributed
over a wide geographical area, Baxter said it is more efficient to
file one lawsuit in a single forum rather than many suits in each
defendant's home state.</TE>
<TE>   "California is a logical forum for convenient, efficient, and
effective relief," Baxter wrote. "The industries affected by
Pavlovich's conduct are centered or substantially present here."
Chief Justice Ronald M. George and Justice Ming W. Chin joined the
dissent in Pavlovich vs. Superior Court, S100809.</TE>
<TE>   Allonn Levy, whose San Jose law firm represented Pavlovich without
charge, said the ruling benefits consumers and small to mid-size
businesses that use the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   "There are so many smaller companies trying to have a presence
online and you are going to stifle that if they are susceptible to a
lawsuit anywhere in the world," he said. "They are not going to use
the Internet, and I as a lawyer can not advise them to use the
Internet if that is going to happen."</TE>
<TE>   He said the decision probably will have an effect nationally. "It
is going to shape the way the jurisdiction is decided in every single
intellectual property case that deals with the Internet," Levy said.
"This is such a cutting-edge issue that other jurisdictions are very
likely to look to this decision and follow it."</TE>
<TE>   Kessler, the DVD Copy Control Assn. lawyer, said the group might
ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review the decision.</TE>
<TE>   "Our feeling was that when you have this injury occurring to
citizens of California, you shouldn't have to go all over the world
and different states to find the perpetrators," he said. "You should
be able to sue in the home state of the victims."</TE>

<HD>Edison International Sees Lower Profit for 2003 on Trading
Unit Performance</HD>
<DH>Firm still hopes to resume common stock dividend. S&amp;P cuts
subsidiary's debt rating.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Edison International's 2003 earnings are expected to decline, the
company said Monday, because of poor performance at its
energy-trading subsidiary.</LD>
<LD>   Per-share earnings will range from $1.40 to $1.60, down from
projected 2002 operating earnings of $1.80 to $1.90, the company
said. Even so, executives still hope the Rosemead-based utility
holding company will resume paying a common stock dividend by the end
of 2003.</LD>
<LD>   The expected earnings slump at Edison International, parent of the
Southern California Edison utility, primarily reflects poor
performance by Edison Mission Energy, an unregulated subsidiary that
owns power plants and trades energy, Edison executives said in a
conference call with investors and analysts.</LD>
<TE>   Like other energy merchants, Edison Mission Energy has been
struggling for months with low power prices, high debt and tight
credit.</TE>
<TE>   Edison executives also said earnings probably would decline
because certain extraordinary gains from various regulatory
decisions, such as historic performance rewards received in 2002, are
not expected to repeat.</TE>
<TE>   Edison had warned investors this month that 2003 earnings would be
lower than the improved results expected for 2002. Nonetheless,
Edison shares slipped 57 cents to $11.23 on the New York Stock
Exchange on Monday, down 4.8%.</TE>
<TE>   Edison International Chief Executive John E. Bryson said the
company is working to return its main subsidiary, Southern California
Edison, to financial strength as the state of California gets out of
the power-buying business. Southern California Edison is required by
law to resume buying power Jan. 1.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the company said it may be able to pay off its energy
crisis power debts under a settlement with the California Public
Utilities Commission sooner than the expected 2003 year-end target.
Edison collects rates that are higher than the cost of electricity
and thus has paid $2.9 billion of its debt load, leaving $718 million
to be collected as of Oct. 31.</TE>
<TE>   Edison hopes to resume paying a dividend to shareholders by the
end of next year, Bryson said. In late 2000, as it began to run out
of cash because of record electricity prices, Edison suspended its
common stock dividend -- then paying at a quarterly rate of 28 cents
a share.</TE>
<TE>   "Restoring the dividend is as important to regaining access to
equity markets as an investment-grade credit rating is to access to
the debt markets," Bryson said.</TE>
<TE>   As part of its October 2001 settlement with the state, which is
being challenged in court by consumer advocates, Edison agreed to
refrain from paying a dividend on its common stock until its power
debts are paid.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California Edison next year is expected to earn $1.93 a
share compared with projected earnings of $2.20 a share for 2002,
according to Edison International's chief financial officer, Theodore
F. Craver Jr. Reflecting volatility in the energy merchant sector,
Edison Mission Energy could lose as much as 10 cents a share or earn
as much as 10 cents a share, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate action that underscored the earnings guidance,
Standard &amp; Poor's Ratings Services announced a three-notch downgrade
of Edison Mission Energy debt, pushing the credit ratings deeper into
junk territory and raising the company's borrowing costs.</TE>
<TE>   S&amp;P cut the ratings on EME-issued debt and senior unsecured debt
to BB-minus, and its preferred debt to B, all with a negative
outlook.</TE>
<TE>   The downgrade reflects an upcoming refinancing of $1.7 billion in
short-term bank debt combined with EME's inability to pull cash out
of its largest subsidiary because of other credit downgrades, S&amp;P
said.</TE>

<HD>Rancor Lingers Over Union Posters</HD>
<DH>Businesses that declined to display signs still are being
boycotted</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Louis Sahagun</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Given a choice, Tony Cuccio prefers not to have signs of any kind in
the windows of his cafe in the shadow of the Vincent Thomas Bridge.</LD>
<LD>   But Cuccio has learned the hard way that there's a price to pay
for having refused to display a poster supporting local dockworkers
during their just-ended contract talks with the shipping lines.</LD>
<LD>   "I've been blackballed," said Cuccio, who has watched his union
clientele abruptly vanish, along with 20% of his average daily sales.
"It feels like the last of the 1930s."</LD>
<TE>   His Fantastic Cafe on Gaffey Street is among four San Pedro
businesses hit by an informal boycott by union members and backers,
evidently peeved about what they see as a lack of respect.</TE>
<TE>   With the announcement Saturday of a tentative contract between
West Coast shipping companies and the International Longshore and
Warehouse Union, the signs bearing pro-union messages -- "An injury
to one is an injury to all" some declared -- have started coming down
from restaurant and shop windows throughout San Pedro and Wilmington.</TE>
<TE>   But the rancor lingers. Halfway up a hill from Cuccio's place, a
delicatessen owner who initially scoffed at hanging a pro-union sign
also is struggling. He eventually relented, putting up a sign near
his main entrance. But for some union members it was too late. They
still haven't returned.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Mann, a spokesman for ILWU Local 13, stressed that the
boycotts are not formal union actions and that it was strictly up to
the business owners whether to hang a sign. "The union supports all
local businesses," he said.</TE>
<TE>   For some, however, it's not so simple. Take, for instance, Yoshi
Toshiro, whose small sushi restaurant was a favorite ILWU hangout
until he ignored union members who suggested over the summer that he
hang up one of the posters.</TE>
<TE>   Toshiro said he had noticed a drop in business but hadn't tied it
to his refusal to hang up a sign. Finally, in mid-November, he too
gave in and put one up. But some union supporters say they continue
to shun his restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a piece of paper but a very strong one," said Toshiro,
a fixture in the community for 14 years and a longtime supporter of
local civic activities. "I can't believe this has happened."</TE>
<TE>   Toshiro said he has felt trapped between the union and other
customers who belong to the Pacific Maritime Assn., which represented
the shipping firms in the labor dispute and "doesn't like those
signs."</TE>
<TE>   Leslie Smith, executive director of the San Pedro Chamber of
Commerce, called the flap over the signs "disappointing."</TE>
<TE>   "I think it should be a matter of personal choice whether or not
to put up a sign in a window," he said. "But I also understand that
if you are a union member who feels you are not being supported, then
it's your choice not to patronize someone."</TE>
<TE>   Union supporters point out that the ILWU's work force, which
includes some of the highest-paid hourly employees in the country,
pumps hundreds of dollars each day into those and other local
businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Asking them to temporarily hang a sign, they argue, would seem a
small favor to ask.</TE>
<TE>   "When the union went on strike in 1948 and 1971, mom-and-pop
stores that depended on union incomes would donate to strike lines
and run tabs for union families," said Shannon Donato of the Harry
Bridges Community Labor Center, an ILWU support group. "That was
their way of saying, 'Hey, we know this is a temporary situation, and
we know you'll still be customers when it's over.'</TE>
<TE>   "Nowadays," she continued, "all the union asks is that businesses
hang a poster."</TE>
<TE>   Marta Valladolid, owner of Bringleson Jewelers on 6th Street,
would not argue with that.</TE>
<TE>   "We had two signs in front and one in back," she said. "After all,
30% of my clientele is ILWU. Of course, now that there's a contract,
the signs came down, and everyone is happy, as they should be."</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of the posters were distributed shortly after the
contract between the shipping lines and the 10,500 longshore workers
expired. The blue, gold and white posters, 18 by 24 inches, featured
a globe-shaped union logo. Across the logo appeared union phrases and
rallying cries, including, "We support the ILWU" and "Contract 2002."</TE>
<TE>   More often than not, the posters went up without a fuss. Even a
former Hanjin Shipping Co. manager who now owns a beauty supply store
not far from Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn's San Pedro home had one
hanging by the door.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that we have an ILWU sign up is not to suggest that we
have taken sides," said the store owner, who asked that his name not
be used. "It simply shows our support for a community in which there
are lots of ILWU members."</TE>
<TE>   But several businesses rejected the posters, sometimes because
their lease agreements prohibited such displays.</TE>
<TE>   "I just happen to have a thing against signs on my windows," said
one store owner, who added that he complained to ILWU officials.</TE>
<TE>   "I told them that it sounded like blackmail to me," recalled the
man, who asked to remain anonymous. "They said, 'We don't use those
terms. We put a lot of money into this community. We help our
friends.' "</TE>
<TE>   Cuccio, the owner of Fantastic Cafe, is a former Teamster and
could sympathize with the ILWU's position. He said he was hopeful
about the future. "It'll take some time," he said, "but everything is
going to be fine.... They need us, and we need them."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, an anonymous flier recently passed around town could
mean more bad news for Cuccio.</TE>
<TE>   Titled "Just Say No to Fantastic Cafe," it said in part: "People
and businesses who profit off us but won't do something as simple as
putting up a sign of support, should be 86'd for life.... Spread the
word to everyone and then take your appetite elsewhere!!!!!!!"</TE>

<HD>California Home Sales Jump 17%</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fueled by low mortgage rates and low inventories, the sales pace of
existing U.S. homes rose an unexpectedly strong 6.1% in October from
the previous month while the California sales rate jumped more than
17%, according to real estate reports released Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The housing market has remained strong throughout the downturn;
but even so, economists said they were encouraged by the numbers
because combined with recent good consumer confidence and jobless
claims numbers they paint a rosier picture of the economy.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a part of the economy that has been strong all along,"
said Mark Vitner, economist at Wachovia Securities in Charlotte, N.C.</LD>
<TE>   In California last month, 579,240 detached homes were sold on a
seasonally adjusted, annualized rate, according to the California
Assn. of Realtors. The October median sales price reached $322,730,
up only 0.1% from September but 22.7% higher than the same month last
year. The figures do not include new homes or condominiums.</TE>
<TE>   The inventory of unsold homes in California stood at a three-month
supply in October and is on track to be the lowest annual figure on
record, according to CAR chief economist Leslie Appleton-Young. A
seven- to 10-month supply is typical.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, sales of previously owned homes climbed to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.77 million units from an
upwardly revised 5.44 million unit pace in September, according to
the National Assn. of Realtors.</TE>

<LD>Computing pioneer Alan Kay, who was instrumental in the development
of modern programming languages and graphics-based computer
interfaces, has joined Hewlett-Packard Co. as a senior fellow at HP
Labs.</LD>
<LD>   Kay, 62, will research and develop new software platforms, the
company said Monday. Underlying code will be shared in the same
fashion as the open-source Linux operating system.</LD>
<LD>   In recent years, Kay has been working on Squeak, a set of
programming tools based on images rather than words. Children as
young as 5 have created programs using the system.</LD>
<TE>   Kay said he will continue to work on the Squeak project at HP Labs
and at Glendale-based Viewpoints Research Institute, which he
co-founded.</TE>
<TE>   "The work with children has always been the trigger for the
technological inventions I've done over the years," he said. "Most of
those are now in use by adults. This is something HP understands."</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1960s, Kay played a role in the development of
ARPAnet, a predecessor to the Internet. In 1972, he joined the Xerox
Palo Alto Research Center.</TE>
<TE>   Besides creating the forerunner of today's notebook computers, Kay
invented Smalltalk, widely considered to be the father of modern
object-oriented programming languages. He also played a role in
developing bitmap displays, which now are used in all computers that
show graphical windows and icons.</TE>
<TE>   Kay also was chief scientist at Atari from 1981 to 1984 and a
fellow at Apple Computer Inc. from 1984 to 1996. After leaving Apple,
he joined Walt Disney Imagineering. He left Disney last year.</TE>

<HD>ICN to Settle Suit Over Ribavirin</HD>
<DH>The drug maker, accused of misleading investors, agrees to
pay $1 million and allow federal review of its news releases.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Denise Gellene</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Costa Mesa on Monday agreed to pay $1
million and accepted an unusual federal review of its drug-related
news releases to settle a lawsuit by the Securities and Exchange
Commission charging that it misled investors about its hepatitis C
drug ribavirin.</LD>
<LD>   Company founder and ex-Chief Executive Milan Panic, a former prime
minister of Yugoslavia, also agreed to pay $500,000 to settle similar
charges against him.</LD>
<LD>   The settlements end a 1999 civil suit in which the SEC accused ICN
and Panic of withholding bad news about the drug in 1994 and 1995.</LD>
<TE>   ICN, Panic and two former executives who also settled with the SEC
on Monday neither admitted to nor denied any of the charges. The SEC
said that former ICN Vice President Nils O. Johannesson and former
General Counsel David C. Watt settled the changes against them by
agreeing not to violate securities laws in the future.</TE>
<TE>   As part of its agreement, ICN will submit news releases about its
drugs to the Food and Drug Administration for review before they are
distributed. The releases must be reviewed by three ICN board members
as well.</TE>
<TE>   SEC attorney Merri Jo Gillette said she was not aware of any other
case in which the commission required a pharmaceutical company to
submit its news releases to the FDA.</TE>
<TE>   In its suit, the SEC alleged that in November 1994 ICN learned
that the Food and Drug Administration would not approve ribavirin as
a stand-alone treatment for hepatitis C. Nonetheless, the SEC said,
ICN waited four months to disclose the news to investors. After ICN
revealed that the FDA had rejected ribavirin, the SEC said, the
company's share price plunged 34% in two days. Ribavirin later was
approved for use in combination with a drug from Schering-Plough
Corp.</TE>
<TE>   ICN said that it already had created reserves for the civil
penalties and was happy to put the case behind it. The company said
that the settlement allowed it to apply to the SEC to lift
restrictions on issuing its news releases after 18 months.</TE>
<TE>   The agency's case against ICN bears some similarities to the SEC's
investigation of ImClone Systems Inc., which is under government
scrutiny for allegedly misleading investors about its experimental
cancer drug Erbitux. Last December, the FDA rejected ImClone's
application to approve the drug for reasons that were not immediately
disclosed to investors.</TE>
<TE>   Gillette, a trial attorney in the SEC's Philadelphia office, said
the settlement reached with ICN was "specifically tailored to the
misconduct" alleged against it.</TE>
<TE>   ICN's stock closed Monday at $11.62, up 14 cents, on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Intel Corp. said Monday that it planned to raise the price of flash
memory chips as much as 40%, in a sign that demand may be growing for
the chips used in cellular phones and other devices.</LD>
<LD>   News of the price hike helped boost not only Intel's share price
but also that of rival flash makers Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and
Atmel Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Intel's move to increase prices starting Jan. 1 is driven by
strong demand by makers of next-generation cell phones that have
color screens and other high-end features, spokesman Tom Beermann
said.</LD>
<TE>   Flash memory makes up as much as 30% of AMD's revenue. It accounts
for about 10% of Intel's sales.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of AMD rose $1.09, or 15.9%, to $7.95 in Monday trading on
the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Atmel shares were up $1.24, or 44%, to $4.05 on the Nasdaq Stock
Market.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Santa Clara, Calif.-based Intel jumped 43 cents, to
$20.48, also in Nasdaq trading.</TE>

<HD>From Vanuatu to L.A.: a Court Test for Kazaa</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jon Healey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sharman Networks Ltd., operator of the popular Kazaa online
file-sharing network, is incorporated in the South Pacific tax haven
of Vanuatu and runs its business primarily through contractors in
Australia.</LD>
<LD>   But on Monday its lawyers were in U.S. District Court in Los
Angeles, fighting an effort by the major music and movie companies to
sue Sharman and one of those contractors on these shores.</LD>
<LD>   The question before Judge Stephen Wilson is whether Sharman has
established enough of a presence in the United States to be sued
here. Before hearing arguments from lawyers, Wilson opened Monday's
hearing by saying he was inclined to allow the lawsuit against
Sharman to proceed.</LD>
<TE>   It's a potentially critical issue for the labels and studios,
which are eager to use recent federal court rulings against the
Napster Inc. and Madster file-sharing services to combat the rampant
piracy by Kazaa users.</TE>
<TE>   Though U.S. courts have held file-sharing companies responsible
for their users' actions, it is unclear whether a judge overseas
would agree. An appeals court in the Netherlands, in fact, turned
aside a separate legal challenge to Kazaa, although it did so without
a full-blown trial.</TE>
<TE>   The copyright holders in the L.A. case argue that more than 20
million people in the United States -- including more than 2 million
in California -- use Kazaa software. Wilson said that argument was
"compelling."</TE>
<TE>   Kazaa is the most popular of the many online file-sharing
networks, which let users find and copy the music, movies and other
digital goodies stored on each other's computers. About 3.5 million
people are logged onto the network on a typical afternoon, with more
than 600 million files available for copying.</TE>
<TE>   But Kazaa also has been a moving target for the record companies,
movie studios and music publishers. In October 2001 they sued
Consumer Empowerment, a Dutch software company that was distributing
the Kazaa software and licensing the underlying technology to two
companies, Streamcast Networks Inc. and Grokster Ltd.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer Empowerment stopped contesting the lawsuit earlier this
year, saying it cannot afford the legal fees. Before doing so,
however, it licensed the technology to Sharman, which also took over
the Kazaa Web site and brand name.</TE>
<TE>   The labels, studios and music publishers moved in July to add
Sharman and LEF Interactive, an Australian management company that's
led by Sharman Chief Executive Nicola Hemming, to the lawsuit it had
brought against Consumer Empowerment, Streamcast Networks and
Grokster. But Sharman and LEF asked Wilson to dismiss them on the
grounds that U.S. courts lack jurisdiction over them.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the copyright holders told Wilson that Sharman has
entered into more than 20 contracts with U.S. advertising agencies,
law firms and other companies, and that several of those contracts
were negotiated by LEF. Moreover, they argued that LEF was merely
Sharman's alter ego, and that it engaged in the same activities that
infringed their copyrights.</TE>
<TE>   Roderick R. Dorman, an attorney for Sharman, countered that none
of the U.S. contracts were directly related to the file sharing that
allegedly violated copyrights. And David B. Casselman, an attorney
for LEF, argued that Sharman was legally responsible for all of his
client's activities, so there was no point in including LEF in the
case.</TE>

<HD>Stocks Post Modest Gains</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks shook off some midday weakness Monday to post modest gains,
extending the autumn rally. Technology issues again led the advance,
while health maintenance organization shares plunged on worries about
2003 earnings.</LD>
<LD>   The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index added 13.16 points, or 0.9%,
to 1,481.90, the highest close since June 19.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrials rose 44.56 points, or 0.5%, to 8,849.40,
the highest since Aug. 26.</LD>
<TE>   Most other broad market indexes also gained, as winners
outnumbered losers by 19 to 14 on the New York Stock Exchange and by
21 to 13 on Nasdaq. Trading was active.</TE>
<TE>   The market's resilience Monday, despite midday profit-taking,
suggested that many institutional investors remain eager to add to
their portfolios, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks have rebounded from five-year lows reached in early October
as more investors have bet on an improving economy in 2003, and as
concerns about financial scandals have waned.</TE>
<TE>   Still, many big investors are cautious with the threat of war
between the United States and Iraq still looming.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a reasonable time to put some money in stocks, but you don't
want to jump in with both feet," George Roche, chairman of mutual
fund giant T. Rowe Price Group, told Bloomberg News.</TE>
<TE>   Market bulls were cheered Monday by a report showing that sales of
existing homes continued at a brisk pace in October. Strong home
sales often ripple through the economy as consumers spend on
furnishings and other items.</TE>
<TE>   But the homes report didn't spook the Treasury bond market. Yields
have been rising lately as some investors bet that interest rates
have hit bottom. On Monday the 10-year Treasury note yield edged down
to 4.17% from 4.18% Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Among Monday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Tech shares mostly gained despite analyst downgrades of industry
leaders Intel and Cisco Systems. Intel rose 43 cents to $20.48 even
though research firm Sanford C. Bernstein cut the shares to "market
perform" from "outperform." The stock is up 55% since Oct. 8.</TE>
<TE>   Cisco was unchanged at $14.89 as brokerage UBS downgraded it to
"hold" from "buy," citing the stock's valuation. Cisco now is priced
at 27 times analysts' consensus earnings estimate for the current
fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the downgrades, the SOX chip-stock index rose 3.2%, helped
by Intel's announcement of price increases on certain chips. Tech
winners included KLA Tencor, up $1.29 to $44.14; National
Semiconductor, up 82 cents to $19.64; and Juniper Networks, up 87
cents to $9.60.</TE>
<TE>   * In the Internet sector, Expedia jumped $2.36 to $77.38, and
InfoSpace surged $1.55 to $11.34.</TE>
<TE>   * Optimism about the economy may have helped drive General Motors
shares up $1.12 to $38.70 and Ford Motor up 67 cents to $10.88. But
DaimlerChrysler lost 41 cents to $34.80.</TE>
<TE>   * Nike rose 82 cents to $44.57. The athletic apparel firm raised
its quarterly dividend 17%, to 14 cents a share from 12 cents.</TE>
<TE>   * HMO stocks were broadly lower. A survey of 400 employers by
research firm SG Cowen found that many are resisting health-care
premium increases, raising concerns about HMO earnings in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   UnitedHealth Group tumbled $8.17 to $76.45, Wellpoint Health
dropped $7.25 to $62.49 and Aetna slid $4.39 to $35.75.</TE>
<TE>   * Among Southland issues, Glacier Water soared $3.10 to $17.30.
The company Friday offered to exchange 1.15 million of its common
shares for shares of a preferred stock.</TE>

<KH>THE PORT SETTLEMENT</KH>
<HD>Accord Puts Some Jobs in Jeopardy</HD>
<DH>Tentative pact would give one firm's planning positions to
longshore union.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Cleeland</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shipping lines and union dockhands can both claim to be winners under
the labor contract signed this weekend for West Coast ports. For at
least one group of workers, however, the deal looks to be a total
loss.</LD>
<LD>   Under the tentative agreement, a few dozen nonunion planning jobs
would be brought under the jurisdiction of the International
Longshore and Warehouse Union. And that means Sherry Goff and 30
colleagues may be out of a job.</LD>
<LD>   The question still is open, subject to interpretation of the
contract language by arbitrators, federal labor officials and
possibly the courts.</LD>
<TE>   That process is certain to be nasty, played out behind the scenes
as larger changes on the waterfront, such as the implementation of
labor-saving technology, move forward.</TE>
<TE>   Goff works in the nerve center of Stevedoring Services of America,
the largest U.S. terminal operator. In a Salt Lake City control room
750 miles from the ocean, she plans and tracks by computer the
unloading of cargo containers from ships along the West Coast.</TE>
<TE>   The ILWU has claimed these planning jobs for more than a decade,
arguing that before computers moved the work inside, the tasks were
performed on the docks by marine clerks with clipboards. The union
launched an organizing campaign in the 1990s, and the planners at
many shipping lines agreed to join.</TE>
<TE>   But Seattle-based SSA fiercely resisted those efforts, and
eventually moved all its planning jobs from California ports to Utah,
a state with strong legal limits on union organizing.</TE>
<TE>   Goff was part of that move. In 1997, she and her two young
children packed up their home in Oakland and headed east. "It's a
whole different lifestyle," said Goff, a 25-year SSA employee. "It's
cheaper to live, a better environment for the kids. There's a lot of
pluses to being here."</TE>
<TE>   Goff knew planning jobs again would be on the table, and watched
nervously during negotiations between the ILWU and the Pacific
Maritime Assn., which represents about 80 shipping lines and
stevedoring companies, including SSA.</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 1, a breakthrough agreement was announced on the
implementation of labor-saving technology at the ports, which paved
the way for the accord reached Saturday night. That was a relief for
retailers and manufacturers, which depend on the ports to move their
goods.</TE>
<TE>   But it left Goff with a lump in her throat because what made the
deal possible was the PMA's concession -- over objections of her
employer -- that certain planning jobs would fall under union
jurisdiction.</TE>
<TE>   The union made it clear it does not want to represent the Utah
workers. It wants the planning jobs for its own marine clerk members,
and considers that to be a fair exchange for agreeing to technology
that will cut hundreds of other clerk jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Last Tuesday, Goff and her colleagues filed a complaint with the
National Labor Relations Board, claiming that this part of the
tentative contract is illegal. "How can someone negotiate your job
away?" said Goff, who voted against unionization when she was based
in Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   The Utah workers were aided by lawyers from the National Right to
Work Legal Defense Foundation, which has filed hundreds of lawsuits
against unions across the country. Few have been successful.</TE>
<TE>   The NLRB filing also was praised by SSA President Jon Hemingway.
"We expect howls of protest from the union," he wrote in a Nov. 19
letter to employees. "Nonetheless, we hope that we will be able to
get clarification and resolution so that our people, whether
affiliated with a union or not, can continue to perform their jobs."</TE>
<TE>   The PMA, in a rare split with one of its members, defended the
contract clause before the NLRB, saying the company could continue to
employ the nonunion Utah workers, even though their job functions
would be transferred to the union.</TE>
<TE>   To further complicate matters, the union filed its own NLRB
charges Friday, claiming that SSA improperly sponsored the effort by
its employees to void the clause in the contract.</TE>
<TE>   Wayne Benson, a spokesman for the labor board's Denver office,
where the charges have been filed, said the case filed by Goff and
her co-workers is considered the "highest possible priority."</TE>

<LD>Readers looking to get their online fix for popular magazines such as
Time or People soon may have only one place to turn -- America
Online.</LD>
<LD>   America Online and Time Inc. are in discussions about making Time
Inc.'s magazine content available via America Online, rather than the
entire Internet, a person familiar with the matter said.</LD>
<LD>   Such a deal would bring the two units of AOL Time Warner Inc.
closer together, while offering a potentially significant lift to the
struggling Internet division.</LD>
<TE>   Currently, most of Time Inc.'s magazines can be read for free
online.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, may be
discussed at a Dec. 3 meeting with analysts, where new America Online
Chief Executive Jon Miller plans to discuss the division's plans for
the future.</TE>

<LD>   The guidelines are the first to specifically address invisible
tracking devices called "Web bugs" that can be used to monitor
traffic on a Web site, collect names for "spamming" campaigns or
allow ad agencies to profile a computer user's habits.</LD>
<LD>   Developed by privacy consultants, the U.S. Postal Service and

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal probe of accounting practices at Computer Associates
International Inc. may be more extensive than the software company
has acknowledged, according to a lawyer for several former employees.</LD>
<LD>   Computer Associates, based in Islandia, N.Y., has said that the
investigation by the Justice Department and the Securities and
Exchange Commission focuses on a $1.1-billion executive compensation
package and the company's method of booking revenue in 1998.</LD>
<LD>   But the former employees, who are suing the firm on various
grounds, allege that it used customer contracts and free software to
shift revenue between quarters in 1999 and 2000, the former
employees' lawyer, Joseph Ranni, said. Such a practice could violate
accounting rules.</LD>
<TE>   Computer Associates defended its accounting and said it wasn't
aware of any changes in the probe. Shares of Computer Associates rose
16 cents to $14.98 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge denied a request to freeze proceeds from sales of
Qwest Communications International Inc. stock by former Chief
Executive Joe Nacchio and the company's founder, Philip Anschutz.</LD>
<LD>   The motion to freeze the proceeds from the stock sales was related
to a pending shareholder lawsuit that alleges that Qwest and certain
individuals, including Nacchio and Anschutz, engaged in financial
fraud, artificially inflating Qwest's share price between May 24,
1999, and Feb. 14, 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Attorneys representing the Qwest shareholders had sought a court
order to freeze the proceeds from the stock sales to ensure that
their clients would be able to collect damages if they win their
lawsuit.</LD>
<TE>   But the judge poured cold water on the likelihood the plaintiffs
would prevail.</TE>
<TE>   Qwest shares rose 37 cents to $4.99 on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Tenet's Medicare Loophole to Close Soon, Analyst Says</HD>
<DH>Hospital firm received $763 million last year in outlier
payments, which a report says the agency will clamp down on.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald D. White</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A financial analyst for UBS Warburg warned investors that a federal
agency soon will close a "major loophole" that allowed hospital chain
Tenet Healthcare Corp. to receive $763 million last year in a
particular form of Medicare payments.</LD>
<LD>   The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is
reviewing Medicare outlier payments that are made to hospitals to
help offset the cost of unusually expensive treatments.</LD>
<LD>   These outlier payments are calculated, in part, by comparing a
hospital's charges against a complicated statewide average on costs
and procedures.</LD>
<TE>   Tenet has acknowledged aggressively raising its retail hospital
prices, which help determine its outlier payments. Recently, CMS
administrator Tom Scully said Tenet received a disproportionately
large share of outlier payments, and he promised quick action to
exert greater control over the program.</TE>
<TE>   Investors have been waiting eagerly for news about any potential
changes in the outlier program and its effect on Tenet's revenue.</TE>
<TE>   In a research report Friday, UBS analyst Kenneth Weakley wrote
that outlier payments based on statewide averages of medical costs
would be eliminated after a 60-day waiting period, although he did
not estimate how much Tenet would lose in annual revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Weakley, who was the first analyst to raise concerns about
outliers at Tenet, was not available for comment Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet spokesman Harry Anderson had no comment on Weakley's report,
but he said the company is "eagerly awaiting information" from CMS.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Barbara-based Tenet is the nation's second-largest hospital
chain.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet's stock has nose-dived in recent weeks after it was revealed
that the company is being audited by CMS for its sizable Medicare
billings. The Securities and Exchange Commission also has opened an
informal inquiry into the company. And a Tenet hospital in Redding,
Calif., was raided by federal agents who are investigating two
doctors for allegedly performing unnecessary heart surgeries.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, the California Nurses Assn. on Monday released a
report claiming that Tenet inflates drug charges at its hospitals by
736% above costs, or more than double the national average.</TE>
<TE>   "We acknowledge that price increases in recent years have put us
ahead of other hospitals. But the important point to remember is that
no [patient] pays these prices. People pay an amount set by Medicare
or Medicaid or negotiated by their insurance companies," Anderson
said.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Monday, a coalition of nurses, community health activists
and union leaders called on California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer to
block Tenet's pending $35-million acquisition of the USC/Norris
Comprehensive Cancer Center and Hospital in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet already manages the small research facility and also owns
and operates USC University Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Carolyn Tapp, who leads a group called the Women of Color Breast
Cancer Survivors, is part of the coalition and says she is concerned
that Tenet will restrict access and care if Norris is sold.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet vigorously denies that charge.</TE>
<TE>   A USC official said recently that the university was still in
favor of selling the hospital to Tenet.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Lockyer said the state takes seriously the sale of
all nonprofit facilities, such as Norris, to for-profit companies.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney general has until Jan. 17 to review the proposed
sale. His spokesman, Tom Dresslar, said the state already has an
outside consultant studying how the sale would affect care at the
hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet's shares closed Monday at $16.52, up 12 cents, on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Personal Bankruptcy Filings at Record Pace</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Americans filed for personal bankruptcy at a record pace in the third
quarter as rising unemployment and the stock market's continuing
plunge made it harder for people to repay debts.</LD>
<LD>   Personal bankruptcies totaled 391,873 in the quarter ended Sept.
30, a 0.2% increase from the second quarter, according to data
reported Monday. It was the largest number of filings for any quarter
since the Administrative Office of the U.S. courts began keeping
records.</LD>
<LD>   That brought the number of such filings for the 12 months ended
Sept. 30 to 1.51 million.</LD>
<TE>   Americans had a record $8 trillion in personal debt, including
credit card loans and mortgages, at the start of the third quarter.
As debt has continued to balloon over the last two years, the jobless
rate has risen and many Americans' investment portfolios have shrunk.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people have been laid off in the past year, and the
amount of debt people are carrying relative to their incomes is very
high," said Jay Westbrook, a professor of law at the University of
Texas at Austin. "That's a path that will too often lead to
bankruptcies."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, business bankruptcy filings fell 2.7% in the third
quarter, to 9,433. It was the third straight quarterly decline.</TE>
<TE>   The rise in personal bankruptcy filings came amid expectations
that Congress would pass a law to make it harder for high-income
debtors to declare bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   The measure unexpectedly failed to pass after the Senate earlier
this month said it wouldn't vote on a revised House-passed bill.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation would have made it more difficult for debtors to
file under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, which allows
consumers to cancel their debts. Individuals who make more than the
median income in their state would have been required to pursue a
Chapter 13 bankruptcy, requiring them to repay creditors at least
some of what they're owed.</TE>

<BD>From Reuters and Times Staff</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>General Electric Capital Corp. is taking aim at yield-hungry small
investors: The finance arm of GE has launched a plan to sell $20
billion of bonds specifically to individuals.</LD>
<LD>   The bonds are being sold as "InterNotes" through a 2-year-old
program run by Incapital of Chicago and Banc of America Securities.</LD>
<LD>   The InterNotes program lets small investors buy investment-grade
bonds in increments of $1,000. Investors can choose how often to have
interest payments made to their accounts.</LD>

<AU>Arianna Huffington</AU>
<BD>Arianna Huffington writes a syndicated column.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Once again, the United States is a nation divided.</LD>
<LD>   And I'm not talking about the irrevocable, brother-against-brother
split between those who think the Bachelor should have proposed to
Brooke instead of Helene. I'm talking about a contentious clash that
is just beginning to rage. Call it the SUV war.</LD>
<LD>   On the one hand, sales of the gas-guzzling, pollution-spewing,
downright dangerous behemoths continue to soar. And apparently, the
more fuel-inefficient the better: Dealers are having a hard time
keeping up with the demand for the Hummer H2, GM's new $50,000
domesticated spinoff of the Gulf War darling, which struggles to
cover 10 miles for every gallon of gas it burns.</LD>
<TE>   There seems to be no shortage of Americans who think that
consuming 25% of the world's oil just isn't enough.</TE>
<TE>   Lining up on the other side of the SUV DMZ is a disparate
collection of groups and individuals whose aim is to win the hearts
and minds -- and change the driving habits -- of the American public.</TE>
<TE>   These include the Evangelical Environmental Network, which is
promoting greater fuel efficiency through a provocative TV ad
campaign that asks, "What would Jesus drive?" Hint: I don't think the
answer is an H2 (turning water into oil wasn't really his thing).</TE>
<TE>   This comes at the same time that Americans for Fuel Efficient
Cars, a group I co-founded with film producer Lawrence Bender and
environmental activist Laurie David, is producing ads parodying the
drugs-equal-terror ads the administration is running. In this case,
we're linking driving SUVs to our national security.</TE>
<TE>   When Hollywood progressives and the "WWJD?" crowd independently
hit on the same idea, you know that something is up.</TE>
<TE>   Even as SUVs continue to roll off the assembly line and out of car
dealers' showrooms at a record pace, there is a growing sense that
the tide of public opinion is turning against these metal
monstrosities, that a tipping point in the push to wean ourselves
from foreign oil has finally been reached. The SUV makers have won a
few battles, but they may be about to lose the war.</TE>
<TE>   Just take a look at the media, usually an excellent weather vane
when it comes to these kinds of societal shifts. In the last week
alone there has been an explosion in the amount of positive coverage
given to the anti-SUV movement, including segments on all the
networks' nightly news shows.</TE>
<TE>   And in Washington, after staunchly opposing any raise in fuel
efficiency standards, the Bush administration let it be known that it
is considering a proposal to increase the standard for light trucks
and SUVs by 1.5 miles per gallon by 2007. While Team Bush hailed the
proposed boost as a major victory in the battle for energy
independence, Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.), who along with Sen. John
McCain (R-Ariz.) last spring proposed raising the SUV standard by
50%, called the 7% increase "window dressing." Others labeled it
"political theater" and "almost an insult in its modesty."</TE>
<TE>   It does seem woefully inadequate, especially when you consider the
many loopholes already being driven through by light trucks and SUVs,
which are currently allowed to average 7 mpg less than regular cars.
For instance, did you know that if an SUV is massive enough, it is
entirely exempt from federal fuel economy standards?</TE>
<TE>   Even the mucky-mucks in Detroit are starting to get the message.
Ford, for instance, whose executives met last week with
representatives from the "What Would Jesus Drive?" campaign, has
pledged to boost the overall fuel efficiency of its SUVs by 25% over
the next three years and plans to introduce a hybrid gas-electric
model that will get around 40 mpg.</TE>
<TE>   The war's not going the SUV makers' way, and they know it. The
change in the public's mood is very similar to the
consciousness-raising that followed the designated-driver campaign
and the efforts of Mothers Against Drunk Driving. The campaign
hammered home a very compelling message, and the public's perception
of drinking and driving was changed forever. Getting loaded and
getting behind the wheel went from being cool to being antisocial.
With any luck, getting behind the wheel of a loaded gas guzzler is
about to undergo the same transformation.</TE>

<HD>The Future Dances on a Pin's Head</HD>
<DH>Nanotechnology: Will it be a boon -- or kill us all?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Julia A. Moore</AU>
<BD>Julia A. Moore is a public policy scholar at the
Smithsonian Institution's Woodrow Wilson International Center for
Scholars.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's official. The nanotechnology debate is underway. Michael
Crichton's alarmist book, "Prey," with its menacing swarms of
molecule-sized robots, hits bookstores this week, with a Hollywood
spectacular soon to follow.</LD>
<LD>   Nongovernmental groups, scientists and industry are lining up for
a major public relations battle over the good and evils of
nanotechnology. The opposing sides are asking whether nanotech will
fill the world with self-replicating microscopic "nanobots" -- a
thousand times smaller than the diameter of a human hair -- that will
wipe out humanity, or whether nano is a silver bullet that promises a
cure for cancer, an end to crop shortages and the solution to
cleaning up pollution.</LD>
<LD>   Nanotechnology uses individual atoms or molecules as components of
tiny machines, measured by the nanometer, or millionth of a
millimeter. (A millimeter is equivalent to 0.039 of an inch.) Today's
computer chips pack about 40 million transistors onto a silicon wafer
no bigger than a postage stamp. The National Science Foundation
foresees a future of computer chips that store trillions of bits of
information on a pinhead-sized gadget.</LD>
<TE>   Nanotechnology's applications go far beyond the realm of
semiconductors and computers, potentially affecting virtually every
aspect of people's lives and promising us new clean energy sources,
pollution control systems, and nanoscale sensors and drug delivery
tools working inside the human body to detect and treat disease.</TE>
<TE>   Yet in 2000, Sun Microsystems scientist Bill Joy was so worried
about the possibility of terrorists using masses of uncontrolled and
self-replicating nanobots to selectively kill people who are
genetically distinct or in a certain geographic area that he wrote an
article for Wired magazine warning that robotics, genetic engineering
and nanotechnology threaten to make humans an endangered species.</TE>
<TE>   Whether nanotechnology research results in the ultimate doomsday
machine or in mankind's salvation is up to us. In the mid-1980s,
there was considerable opposition to the now-celebrated Human Genome
Project. The increased availability of genetic information raised
difficult questions about how the information is used by insurance
companies, law enforcement agencies, schools and employers. There
also are big issues regarding commercial exploitation -- for example,
who owns genes and other pieces of DNA, and what can be patented?</TE>
<TE>   The founders of the Human Genome Project acknowledged that they
did not have answers to these significant societal questions. So they
set aside 5% of the project's annual budget for a program to define
and deal with the ethical, legal and social implications raised by
this brave new world of genetics -- creating one of the largest such
efforts ever.</TE>
<TE>   Societal concerns about new technologies demand real action by
government, the science community and industry, not just public
relations "spin." The public knows that any new technology brings
pluses and minuses, and it is willing to accept some risks connected
to new technologies -- particularly medical breakthroughs -- if the
benefits are significant enough.</TE>
<TE>   But increasingly, people want hard evidence that scientists,
government and corporations have examined and addressed the potential
risks associated with scientific breakthroughs and new technologies.
They're looking for concrete measures aimed at building public
confidence in 21st century progress.</TE>
<TE>   Such steps include governments maintaining strong oversight and
regulatory systems and dealing with concern over the growing
commercialization of science and financial conflicts of interest.</TE>
<TE>   Most important, citizens want to have a say in making individual
choices and the societal trade-offs related to the application of new
technology and science.</TE>
<TE>   Breakthroughs today in nanotechnology mark a tremendous milestone
for science, but they pose even bigger challenges for science
policymakers in the future.</TE>

<HD>How the Politicos Stole Christmas</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert Scheer</AU>
<BD>Robert Scheer is a syndicated columnist.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What a lousy Christmas present.</LD>
<LD>   On Dec. 28, three days after the celebration of a man famous for
helping the downtrodden, Republican scrooges and Democratic stooges
in Congress will hand 800,000 Americans something far worse than a
lump of coal: an end to unemployment benefits the Senate had earlier
voted to extend.</LD>
<LD>   Affected parents are now likely to spend the holidays putting on a
brave face for the kids, wondering how they're going to pay the rent
come New Year's Day.</LD>
<TE>   An additional 90,000 unemployed workers will lose their benefits
in each subsequent week of 2003 because the Republican leadership of
the House refused to back an extension. This was too much even for
Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.), who said: "It's unconscionable for us to
leave town without fixing unemployment compensation. The political
symbolism of it is just horrendous."</TE>
<TE>   Neither harsh reality nor "political symbolism," however, moved
President Bush to intervene. For all of Bush's crocodile tears about
those who suffered the loss of jobs in an economy soured by a burst
stock market bubble, terrorist attacks and corporate scandals, he did
nothing to ease the burden on unemployed workers. To be charitable,
it is possible that the president does not know what an unemployment
check is, or why the failure to receive one in the dead of winter
could harm a family's values -- like the value of keeping the heat on
or of having a roof over one's head.</TE>
<TE>   Evidently, there is only so much compassionate conservative spirit
to spread around, and most of it has been reserved for
welfare-addicted basket cases such as the insurance and airline
industries. Now it is the giant drug companies that have received a
holiday bonus.</TE>
<TE>   The pharmaceuticals earn huge profits from government-granted drug
patents but evidently will not produce new vaccines for the public's
security unless they are guaranteed a risk-free environment. Thanks
to a provision tacked onto the homeland security bill, they are now
inoculated against responsibility for injuries or deaths caused by
vaccinations, whether given in the past or the future.</TE>
<TE>   We need a Charles Dickens to capture the heartlessness of Bush
economics, but in his stead we'll quote Rep. David R. Obey (D-Wis.):
"I find it outrageous that the Congress is going to find room in its
heart to help the poor, downtrodden drug companies but will not find
room in their hearts to deal with the problems of the long-term
unemployed."</TE>
<TE>   Outrageous, but not surprising. The unemployed don't have much to
give in campaign contributions, while the drug companies stuffed most
of their $30 million in donations into Republican stockings during
the last electoral go-around.</TE>
<TE>   The White House does have something to offer those struggling
during this tepid "jobless recovery" -- the siren songs of
patriotism, whose sweet notes overwhelm the sour tastes of raw fear
and material insecurity left in the wake of recession and terrorist
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Whenever the drums of war beat loudest, ordinary people accept
economic deprivation while the rich find ways to further enrich
themselves. Not that they'll have to look very hard.</TE>
<TE>   While denying a few hundred bucks to unemployed workers, the Bush
Republicans are still moving aggressively to extend and make
permanent their budget-busting 2001 tax cut for the rich and to
eliminate the inheritance tax, thereby widening the gap between haves
and have-nots.</TE>
<TE>   When asked by a Los Angeles Times reporter how he could explain
tax cuts for the rich to an unemployed worker, Sen. Specter, a GOP
stalwart, bravely broke ranks long enough to reply: "I'm going to say
to him, 'We did you wrong.' "</TE>
<TE>   The senator shouldn't sound so surprised. The Republicans are
simply being consistent, and the results are predictable. The rich
get richer, while the middle class steadily erodes as solid jobs are
lost to cheap labor abroad, whose docility is guaranteed by friendly
dictatorships backed by American firepower.</TE>
<TE>   Wrap this rip-off in the cloak of God and country and it
apparently sells, as the last election demonstrated. Doesn't it mock
the spirit of Christ -- which the powerful conservative Christians in
the GOP publicly claim informs their every decision -- to so
blatantly betray the needy as we celebrate a savior of the poor?</TE>

<HD>This Is Not the Job of Soldiers for Hire</HD>
<DH>The U.S. military, not mercenaries, should guard the Afghan
president.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jonathan D. Tepperman</AU>
<BD>Jonathan D. Tepperman is senior editor at Foreign
Affairs magazine in New York. A longer version of this article ran in
the Nov. 25 issue of New Republic magazine.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Earlier this month, just as United Nations weapons inspectors were
packing their trunks for Baghdad and the Pentagon was honing its
invasion plans, a group of U.S. soldiers headed for home. The 45
Special Forces troops who had guarded Afghan President Hamid Karzai
since summer -- and already saved his life at least once -- left. The
Bush administration replaced them with mercenaries.</LD>
<LD>   Though this fateful decision has drawn little notice at home, it
may have fatal consequences for Karzai and Afghanistan. And it could
sharply undermine international confidence in American commitments
abroad, the last thing we need as we try to sustain support for
disarming Saddam Hussein.</LD>
<LD>   The decision to contract out Karzai's security detail is not
surprising. We have witnessed a huge boom in "private military
corporations" since the end of the Cold War.</LD>
<TE>   Part of this is because as regular armies have shrunk, the number
of available freelancers has grown. And part has to do with the giddy
faith that the government has come to place in the private sector as
the stock market boomed and the American economy reached
unprecedented heights.</TE>
<TE>   It became a gospel of sorts that private companies could clean
streets, run prisons or even fight wars more cheaply and efficiently
than could bureaucrats.</TE>
<TE>   The recent scandals in corporate America have taken much of the
luster off this myth, but Republicans in Washington hang on to it.
And corporations can do some things better. No one argues that the
Army needs to clean its own toilets, for example.</TE>
<TE>   But for actual military uses, private contractors offer few of the
benefits that privatization was supposed to deliver. They are neither
cheaper nor more effective than government workers. Worse, they're
unaccountable and hard to control, which makes them particularly ill
suited to a mission like guarding Karzai.</TE>
<TE>   Consider DynCorp, a $2-billion Virginia-based corporation that has
been hired to protect the Afghan leader. Some of its work has been
exemplary. But it has recently been mired in scandals, including a
prostitution ring in Bosnia and allegations of overbilling, cost
overruns and poor maintenance work.</TE>
<TE>   Further, though contractors are sometimes ruthlessly effective in
combat situations -- in Sierra Leone, for example, a handful of South
African mercenaries quickly reversed the course of the war -- their
tactics often are indiscriminate, which could be disastrous in
Afghanistan, where many in the government already resent Karzai and
his U.S. supporters and are just waiting for them to slip up.</TE>
<TE>   Such a slip-up seems almost inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   Most of Karzai's new, private bodyguards will be former Special
Forces troops. But as civilians, they'll find it tough to get the
intelligence, communications and military support critical to
predicting threats to their client and keeping him alive.</TE>
<TE>   Given these drawbacks, why has the Bush administration decided to
swap Karzai's elite military guardians with mercenaries? The
administration isn't telling.</TE>
<TE>   Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld has suggested that it's
because he needs the bodies for Iraq. But given the tiny numbers
involved, this strains credulity.</TE>
<TE>   Here is another possibility: The Pentagon need not disclose the
details of contracts under $50 million, and the State Department,
which has hired DynCorp in this case, does not have to publicly
discuss such "proprietary contracts." Nor can Congress interfere or
set guidelines as it could were actual troops involved. Using DynCorp
to help keep the peace in Afghanistan leaves room for deniability in
case something goes wrong.</TE>
<TE>   But by contracting out this mission, the Bush administration has
made a dangerous gamble. In order to keep the job quiet, it has
risked the life of a man whom we are very much interested in keeping
alive.</TE>
<TE>   If one of DynCorp's bodyguards commits a crime, kills an Afghan or
allows the death of Karzai, no one in Afghanistan or abroad will
really care that the malefactor was a contract worker, not a soldier;
only that he was American and that he failed.</TE>
<TE>   At a moment when Washington is trying to persuade the world to
support a possible war in Iraq and the reconstruction that would have
to follow, should we be sending the message that we care more about
plausible deniability than the safety of an ally?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>At least the Bush administration seems to have been embarrassed about
its latest gutting of clean air regulations. Its announcement that it
is eliminating some industrial emissions requirements came on a
Friday afternoon -- a time that's a black hole for news -- in a
conference room where no cameras were permitted and without the
presence of Environmental Protection Agency chief Christie Whitman.</LD>
<LD>   The result of the change will be dirtier air not just near the
plants but in communities for miles around.</LD>
<LD>   At the press conference, EPA Assistant Administrator Jeffrey R.
Holmstead vaguely promised, "There will be emissions reductions as a
result of the final rules that we are adopting today." However, at an
earlier Senate briefing, Holmstead admitted that the agency hadn't
done any computerized or statistical modeling to substantiate his
Orwellian claim that allowing more pollution would encourage less
pollution.</LD>
<TE>   The administration's changes to the so-called New Source Review
program, expected to take effect this week, are complex, but they
boil down to giving plants more freedom to determine how their
progress in reducing emissions is to be measured.</TE>
<TE>   Previously, oil refineries, steel mills and paper processing
plants had to show that a renovation would reduce emissions levels
relative to the two most recent years. The new rules would allow
those factories to use as a baseline their two worst-polluting years
of the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   Control of Congress now rests with the GOP, which received at
least $11 million from power companies in the 2001-02 election cycle.
That's why hope for the 30,000 Americans who die prematurely each
year of causes related to industrial air pollution and for the many
more afflicted with pollution-triggered asthma rests largely in the
hands of moderate Republicans who were elected on pro-environment
platforms.</TE>
<TE>   Now is the time for these legislators, particularly Sens. Gordon
Smith of Oregon, Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island and Olympia J. Snowe
of Maine, to back legislation being crafted by Sen. James M. Jeffords
(I-Vt.) to overturn the new EPA rules.</TE>
<TE>   States can also help fill the void. Governors across the country
should follow the lead of New York's Republican governor, George
Pataki, who promises to challenge the EPA changes in court.</TE>
<TE>   Most Americans will not support policies that lead to more
pollution. Nor are they likely to believe that pollution can be
prettied up with rhetoric about more jobs, even though the
administration tried to do just that in its press release, using the
word "efficiency" five times in three paragraphs. It is because of
those public sentiments that governors in statehouses and legislators
in Washington, by protecting the environment against the Bush
administration's assault, may protect their jobs as well.</TE>

<LD>President Bush described a tentative settlement to the long-running
labor dispute at West Coast ports as "good for workers, good for
employers and ... good for America's economy." That's usually a
meaningless political cliche; this time, happily, it's accurate.</LD>
<LD>   Hope for a quick solution had been dashed in October when shipping
lines and terminal operators locked out port workers for 10 days. The
Bush administration properly used the Taft-Hartley Act to win a court
order that reopened 29 West Coast ports, including Long Beach and Los
Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Nobody knew what would happen when the order expired Dec. 27. So
imagine the surprise late Saturday night when the collective
bargaining process -- thought by many to be as dead as the dinosaurs
-- led to an unexpected six-year labor agreement that will serve as a
template for negotiations beginning in 2004 at East Coast and Gulf
Coast ports.</LD>
<TE>   Federal mediators deserve credit for tirelessly pushing the
International Longshore and Warehouse Union and the Pacific Maritime
Assn., which represents shipping lines and terminal operators, to
stop bickering and start negotiating. The AFL-CIO, which counts the
ILWU as a member, was so concerned about the mediation process
succeeding that it sent its secretary-treasurer, Richard Trumka, to
San Francisco to take part. Top management ended up praising the
negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   There are no guarantees that the Pacific Maritime Assn. won't be
back in six years asking for more concessions, or that
independent-minded longshore workers won't reject the settlement in
an upcoming vote. But the hard-fought agreement suggests that labor
and management leaned heavily on their long, shared history of
negotiating solutions -- most notably a landmark 1960 agreement that
paved the way for huge cranes and cargo containers that have reshaped
the ports.</TE>
<TE>   Port management won what it failed to get in two past negotiations
-- the right to introduce bar-code scanners and other labor-saving
technology, a move that will eliminate hundreds of union jobs. The
union in return won significant pension plan improvements and modest
wage hikes.</TE>
<TE>   Flash back 30 years, when labor unrest last shut down West Coast
ports and the economic effect barely registered outside the harbor
front. Those ports now handle more than $310 billion in seagoing
trade annually, so October's lockout was from the start more than a
local dispute. With this agreement, management and the union
delivered a solution that will have positive repercussions well
beyond the waterfront.</TE>

<HD>Saudis' Troubling 'Charity'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The daughter of an assassinated king of Saudi Arabia could hardly be
expected to knowingly finance Sept. 11 hijackers. But Princess Haifa
al Faisal, daughter of King Faisal and wife of the Saudi ambassador
to Washington, did somehow provide money that ended up with two of
the hijackers. This disclosure should prompt all-out scrutiny of the
Saudi royal family's gifts to charities and needy individuals to
ensure they do not foster terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   The FBI is investigating the money provided to the families of
Omar al Bayoumi and Osama Basnan and how the two men gave financial
assistance to two of the hijackers, Khalid Almihdhar and Nawaf
Alhazmi, while they all lived in San Diego. Some U.S. senators and
House members complain that the FBI has gone easy on the Saudis
during the investigation; FBI officials deny that and say Basnan and
Bayoumi, who have left the United States, routinely helped Arab
newcomers to this country.</LD>
<LD>   Charity is a fundamental tenet of Islam, and the Saudi royal
family long has contributed to religious and social organizations at
home and abroad. However, opponents of the regime have charged that
some of the charities were fronts for terrorist organizations and
that the rulers in Riyadh did not care what happened to their money
abroad so long as it did not finance opposition at home.</LD>
<TE>   The fact that 15 of the 19 Sept. 11 hijackers were Saudis puts a
spotlight on the relationship between the United States, which
depends on Saudi oil, and the kingdom. Osama bin Laden, architect of
the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, is a harsh
critic of Saudi Arabia for letting the U.S. keep troops at bases
there; the Riyadh government stripped Bin Laden of his citizenship
several years before the attacks on the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Although Saudi officials emphasize that the kingdom has had 60
years of close relations with Washington, Riyadh has not always been
helpful to U.S. interests. The government refused to share evidence
about the 1996 bombing of Khobar Towers barracks in Saudi Arabia that
killed 19 U.S. airmen.</TE>
<TE>   Former Assistant Secretary of State Edward S. Walker Jr. says the
Saudi government "has always been reluctant to air its dirty linen in
public and that's not helping them at this point." Financial support
from the royal family for relatives of Palestinian suicide bombers in
Israel also angers the United States, despite Saudi claims that the
money goes to survivors of "martyrs" resisting Israeli occupation.</TE>
<TE>   Saudi officials are right to insist that Bin Laden wants to poison
relations between Riyadh and Washington. But they must understand
that the United States needs to know how past terror attacks were
financed and planned so it can work to prevent new ones. That means
Saudi Arabia must cooperate with U.S. investigators and stop
bankrolling acts of terror.</TE>

<HD>Pinpointing Washington Prep's Problems</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It is no coincidence that stories about crime sprees in South Los
Angeles ("16 Shooting Victims Will 'Never Have That Chance' for
Dreams") and a story about Washington Prep High, a school out of
control in South L.A., appear at the same time (Nov. 21). As a
resident of South L.A. who teaches at a different South L.A. high
school, I can say that a large minority of young people here lack
respect for themselves, which then extends to lack of respect for
others. Hence we have rampant graffiti and violence perpetrated by
young people who lack a moral compass.</LD>
<LD>   We are all to blame. The young people cannot be excused because of
their age. They are responsible for their actions. Parents who fail
to instill what most of us consider common values are to blame as
well, perhaps because they also lack these values, perhaps because
they have been unable to teach them to their children. The rest of us
who live and/or work in the city are also to blame because we have
been unable to show these youths a better way. Chief William Bratton,
I am angry! Many of us are. You were hired to improve the situation.
I await the day I can run through my neighborhood without seeing
omnipresent tagging or being hassled by gangsters or wannabes. Show
us the way.</LD>

<TE>   The problems at Washington Prep did not just begin this year. This
is an endemic situation that has been flagrantly ignored. Only when
principals are willing to permanently expel repeated
disciplinary-problem students (three strikes?) and parents can bring
personal suit against school officials for failure to provide a safe
and productive learning environment will this change.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Levy</TE>
<TE>   Santa Barbara</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As someone who left teaching two years ago after having taught at
Washington Prep for 25 years, let me make a suggestion. Keep your
story on file. You can run it over and over again, after making the
appropriate name changes, every few years. Nothing is going to change
because there is no political will to do what needs to be done.</TE>
<TE>   I am always reminded of the only solution to the problem each time
I run into one of the so-called "troublemakers" I tried to teach. We
always smile and shake hands. Why? Because we are individuals; we
relate as human beings. Put kids into a class with close to 40 others
and that basic human bond breaks down. All the state needs to do is
cut class size by one half and miracles will occur. But where is the
politician who will campaign to do this? Taxes would have to be
raised. And because this idea is politically dead on arrival, our
society will pay the price for decades to come.</TE>

<TE>   The members of the school board are the culprits here. They should
have seen to the firing of the principal. The replacement principal
should be ordered to nail the parents or guardians of out-of-control
kids. It won't be easy, but if a school has to be run like a reform
school, then that's the way it should be.</TE>

<HD>Eminem: Is the Right Word 'Gift' or 'Stupid'?</HD>

<LD>I was delighted to read "Rap Battles of '8 Mile': Flying Words Are
Better Than Flying Bullets," Jody Rosen's Nov. 22 commentary
celebrating the (mostly) anti-violence of rap music and, especially,
Eminem's amazing gift to communicate universally. He certainly
exemplifies a great spirit of independence in addition to the "two
proud American exports: rhythm and wit."</LD>
<LD>   I am a 65-year-old grandmother so taken with the vital energy of
the rapster battle as filmed in "8 Mile" that I must go take it in
again. I noticed, by the way, that the Rabbit character is the only
one in the story who doesn't drink or smoke pot. Could that have
something to do with his drive for succeeding in life on his own
terms?</LD>

Bloodthirsty militant groups are proud to claim these atrocities as
their own.</TE>
<TE>   The U.N. and the European Union turn a blind eye, winking at Arab
oil, and "human rights supporters" on college campuses and elsewhere
ignore these crimes altogether or justify them. Too many Palestinian
parents and schoolteachers teach their children to commit suicide and
to murder other children, and yet the compassionate of the world
don't cry out against this exploitation of children. What has
happened to human values when crimes so heinous can be winked away or
justified? Maybe we comfortable Americans should think about this the
next time we ride a bus or dine out.</TE>

<HD>Parents on Trial in Abuse Case</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Tough Love, or Abuse?" Nov. 21: I am the father/stepfather of
teenage boys, one of whom got seriously in trouble with the law and
who was similarly out of control in our household for a couple of
years. Fortunately, I was the right "dad" at the time, and my stepson
has grown into a fine young man who holds down jobs and does what
he's asked. But it was hell on wheels for a while and almost
destroyed my marriage.</LD>
<LD>   We never made my stepson sleep outside, but at one point we
seriously considered sending him out of the house to live in one of
those camps for troubled youth. I figured, however, that if he knew
what the consequences of his actions would be he might acquiesce to
the normal demands/requests of parents. At one point I told him it
was a foregone conclusion that he was "out" if he didn't shape up
(his mother backed me up) and things got better. Thank God.</LD>
<LD>   I am not saying that Grady and Deborah Machnick did not overstep
the bounds of good parenting, but there is a strain running through
adolescent society today that they are somehow entitled to test their
parents and to have everything, whether they earn it or not. Well, I,
for one, think that's "dog droppings."</LD>

<TE>   As I read your article, I became appalled as I learned what these
parents had done to their child. I am 16 years old. Coming from the
experience of having had difficulty myself maintaining consistent
discipline, I am so grateful that my parents treated me with love and
understanding. I cannot imagine what would have happened to me had I
had to endure the kind of punishment and cruelty the Machnicks' son
had to face.</TE>

<TE>   I find the actions of these two "professionals" utterly
deplorable. I do not entirely hold this boy harmless, but come on,
the grown-ups at least have to pretend to act their age when it comes
to formulating some plan of action toward modifying their son's
behavior.</TE>
<TE>   It just goes to prove that two seemingly educated people can get
married, knock down a nice piece of change, live in a respectable
community with all the requisite accouterments and still lack the
common sense to recognize their own limitations, let alone the
requisite humility to obtain the necessary help.</TE>
<TE>   Did they not even stop to think what message they were sending
their son about the perceived lack of value they held for him when
they placed dog droppings in his backpack? What must this troubled
young man think of himself? This is not good.</TE>

<HD>91 Toll Lanes Sale to OCTA Wins Approval</HD>
<DH>Tolls will continue until the road's debt is retired. Deal
clears the way for $1.6 billion in improvements to the Riverside
Freeway.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dan Weikel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After more than a year of study and deal-making, the Orange County
Transportation Authority on Monday approved a final agreement to buy
the 91 Express Lanes, a privately owned toll road that has become the
state's most controversial experiment in building highways.</LD>
<LD>   OCTA directors voted unanimously to buy the roadway from
California Private Transportation Co., which has operated the four
lanes running 10 miles down the middle of the congested Riverside
Freeway since December 1995.</LD>
<LD>   The tolls lanes -- among the most expensive per-mile rides in the
nation -- have frustrated commuters and politicians alike, largely
because the owners have the right to block major improvements to the
Riverside Freeway.</LD>
<TE>   OCTA agreed in April to acquire the operation for $207.5 million
on Jan. 3, 2003, as long as the company's revenue and finances were
sound. Under the agreement, the authority will assume the operation's
debts of $135 million and pay the owners $72.5 million in cash.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans directors still must agree to the sale, but no opposition
is anticipated.</TE>
<TE>   The tollway runs from northern Anaheim to the Riverside County
line. It was one of four privately owned turnpikes approved by the
state Legislature as a way to hasten construction of new highways. So
far, it is the only one to be built.</TE>
<TE>   To help the Express Lanes succeed, Caltrans gave California
Private Transportation the extraordinary power to veto improvements
to portions of the Riverside Freeway through 2030.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say the restrictions have aggravated congestion on the
Riverside Freeway, which is the only major link between the
fast-growing Inland Empire and Orange County jobs. On workdays,
commuters make at least 250,000 trips on the Riverside Freeway, most
during rush hours. Daily trips are projected to swell to 400,000 by
2020.</TE>
<TE>   The sale of the tollway to OCTA will end the noncompete agreement,
clearing the way for $1.6 billion in improvements to the Riverside
Freeway. About a third of that will be funded by Riverside County,
which recently passed Measure A, a sales tax initiative that will pay
for transportation projects.</TE>
<TE>   "What makes this a workable deal is the increasing traffic," said
Arthur T. Leahy, OCTA's chief executive officer. "If we do not make
this purchase, it will reach horrific proportions."</TE>
<TE>   OCTA officials said they decided to complete the purchase after
the company's books showed that revenue from the toll road has been
increasing steadily. Company records indicate that after years of
losses, the lanes are now profitable.</TE>
<TE>   Toll revenue is important to OCTA, which intends to maintain the
toll road operation until the lanes' $135-million debt is retired.
Officials say they want to refinance the road next year with
tax-exempt bonds, a move that could lower its debt service. They say
that until they take over the operation, they can't estimate how long
it will take to retire the debt and end the tolls.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA's evaluation of the Express Lanes also shows that its
electronic toll collection system needs to be replaced at a cost of
$3 million, and the lanes need $2 million in repairs. In addition to
approving the purchase, the OCTA board agreed to hire Cofiroute --
one of the current owners of the toll lanes -- for about $5 million a
year to manage day-to-day operations of the system. Cofiroute is a
French toll road company that joined with Level 3 Communications and
Granite Construction Co. to build and operate the 91 Express Lanes.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA officials say that as soon as they acquire the toll-road
operation, an advisory committee of officials from Riverside and
Orange counties must set tolls and policies for the lanes. The
committee also will examine the politically sensitive question of
whether another major traffic corridor is needed between Riverside
and Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   "The purchase of the Express Lanes, Measure A, and the advisory
committee are a recipe for success," said Assemblyman-elect Todd
Spitzer, who recently resigned from the Board of Supervisors and the
OCTA board of directors.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Gang Task Force Disbanding</HD>
<DH>Serious crime was prevented by award-winning investigative
unit, officials say. Federal funds were not renewed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Seema Mehta</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Citing budget cuts, the Orange County district attorney's office said
Monday it is disbanding an award-winning investigative unit that
focused on gambling, home-invasion robberies and other financial
crimes committed by gangs.</LD>
<LD>   The Regional Gang Enforcement Team, which brought together local,
state and federal policing agencies to tackle crimes across the
county, was funded by a nearly $3-million federal grant that has not
been renewed, said Michelle Emard, spokeswoman for the district
attorney's office.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators in the unit infiltrated gangs to gather data, and,
in some cases, prevent crimes. The unit was involved in several
high-profile cases, including the seizure of $5 million in
counterfeit designer clothing in Westminster and the arrests of
leaders of a large West Coast drug ring.</LD>
<TE>   It was formed in 1999 by Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas, who cited
its success in his reelection campaign. Rackauckas could not be
reached for comment Monday, but other law enforcement officials
expressed concern about the unit's demise.</TE>
<TE>   "It was extremely successful, not only in gathering intelligence
on this whole underlying criminal element, but in making extremely
effective arrests and preventing some serious crimes," said Fullerton
Police Chief Patrick E. McKinley, who served on the team's board of
directors.</TE>
<TE>   McKinley said he worries that without the aggressive policing by
the unit, some types of crimes will increase.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana Police Chief Paul M. Walters, who is also on the unit's
board of directors, vowed to seek funding to restart it.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very much committed to keeping it," he said. "Everyone
knows these types of projects are the most successful way to police."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike territorial street gangs, those investigated by the unit
are roving, and akin to organized crime. Cases involved murder for
hire, home-invasion robberies and kidnapping for ransom.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, the team made 44 arrests, including people charged with
murder, attempted murder, home-invasion and commercial robbery, sales
of narcotics and machine guns, and other felonies.</TE>
<TE>   It seized drugs, automatic weapons, handguns and $250,000,
according to a September report from the district attorney's office.
Team members also aided the Drug Enforcement Agency, the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms and U.S. Customs.</TE>
<TE>   During its first year, the unit received awards from the
California Narcotics Officers Assn., the International Assn. of Asian
Crime Investigators, the Orange Korean Institute for Human Rights and
others.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most publicized cases involving the unit resulted in
the arrest of two leaders of an organized crime group that
investigators say dominates the Ecstasy trade in Orange County. The
men were arrested in a plot to murder the head of the group.</TE>

<HD>Fired Director of Union Says He Was 'Ambushed'</HD>
<DH>Barry Hammitt seeks a review by arbitrators of the
late-night dismissal. But an official defends the board, saying vote
wasn't planned.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Catherine Saillant</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An internal battle at Ventura County's largest government employee
union continued Monday as dismissed executive director Barry Hammitt
alleged he was "ambushed" and demanded a legal review of his abrupt
termination last week.</LD>
<LD>   Hammitt's attorney, James Farley, sent a letter demanding
arbitration to Keith Filegar, president of the Service Employees
International Union, Local 998. The union represents 6,500 workers
employed by county government, seven cities and several special
districts.</LD>
<LD>   Farley wrote that Hammitt, who was fired Nov. 19 after 28 years as
the union's top administrator, is entitled to a review of his
dismissal by a panel of arbitrators with expertise in labor
regulations.</LD>
<TE>   The union's governing board "ambushed" Hammitt, 58, near the end
of its meeting by suddenly calling for a dismissal vote, the letter
said.</TE>
<TE>   The vote came after several of Hammitt's backers had left the
meeting, assuring the two-thirds majority needed to oust his client,
Farley said in the letter.</TE>
<TE>   There was nothing on the meeting's agenda to indicate the
late-night vote might occur, Farley said. And shortly after Hammitt
was terminated, a locksmith "miraculously appeared" to change the
locks on the union doors, he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "It is ironic that Mr. Hammitt, after all of these years of
fighting to provide job protection to all of the employees that the
union represents, that he would be denied the same things that he
fought for," Farley wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Filegar said the vote was not planned.</TE>
<TE>   He defended the governing board's action, saying union bylaws
require only that two-thirds of board members present must agree to
dismiss.</TE>
<TE>   Filegar said the locksmith was called after the meeting was
adjourned. He questioned Farley's representation of Hammitt, because
Farley has long been the labor group's attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Farley told the union in September that he was winding down his
practice but assured labor leaders he would not "leave them in the
lurch," Filegar said. The union has not yet retained other counsel,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a little surprised that Mr. Farley is claiming to represent
Mr. Hammitt when he is still the attorney for the union. He might
want to check his canon of ethics," the union leader said.</TE>
<TE>   The union named an acting executive director Monday, labor
attorney Jack Futoran Sr. A search for Hammitt's permanent
replacement will soon be underway, Filegar said.</TE>

<HD>Roberto Matta Echaurren, 91; Artist Bridged Surrealistic,
Abstract Genres</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Suzanne Muchnic</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chilean artist Roberto Sebastian Antonio Matta Echaurren -- known for
Surrealistic images of cosmic wonderlands and apocalyptic dreams,
executed under the name of Matta -- died Saturday in Italy, at 91. He
had been hospitalized in Civitavecchia, near his home in the Tuscan
town of Tarquinia.</LD>
<LD>   An internationally renowned artist who spoke several languages,
traveled widely and seemed at home wherever he happened to be, Matta
came of age professionally while living in Paris during the
turbulence leading up to World War II. Like many of his colleagues,
he eventually fled to the United States, but he thrived on making
connections between disparate groups of artists. Viewed as a bridge
figure between Surrealism and Abstract Expressionism, he is often
characterized as a cultural catalyst.</LD>
<LD>   "He was the most important link between the European Surrealist
artists and the young generation of American artists who would become
known as the New York School," said Elizabeth A.T. Smith, chief
curator of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, who organized a
recent traveling show of his work with Colette Dartnell, a curator at
Los Angeles' Museum of Contemporary Art. The critically acclaimed
exhibition, "Matta in America: Paintings and Drawings of the 1940s,"
appeared at MOCA last fall.</LD>
<TE>   "Matta was one of the youngest Surrealists in exile here during
the war and one of the few members of the Surrealist circle who could
communicate easily with artists of his own generation in New York,"
Smith said. "He was very influential in helping young American
artists liberate themselves from the constraints of tradition."</TE>
<TE>   Paul Schimmel, chief curator at MOCA, agreed: "His presence on the
scene and his youthful exuberance provided a critical juncture
between the old world and the new."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Santiago on Nov. 11, 1911, of Spanish and Franco-Basque
parents, Matta completed his early education at the French Jesuit
College of the Sacred Heart, then studied architecture at the
Catholic University of Santiago, graduating in 1931. He moved to
Paris in 1935 and got a job in the office of Swiss architect Le
Corbusier, but soon plunged into a new career.</TE>
<TE>   On a trip to Spain, Matta met Spanish poet Federico Garcia Lorca,
who introduced him to Surrealist theory. Lorca also gave him a letter
of introduction to Spanish painter Salvador Dali, who was living in
Paris. Through Dali, Matta met Andre Breton, the leading light of the
Surrealist movement in Paris.</TE>
<TE>   Swept away by the Surrealists' advocacy of delving into the
subconscious to find intuitive truth, Matta in 1938 painted his first
pictures and participated in the International Exhibition of
Surrealism in Paris. He fled to the United States in 1939, settled in
New York and soon became acquainted with American artists who would
become major Abstract Expressionists, including Jackson Pollock,
Robert Motherwell and Arshile Gorky.</TE>
<TE>   Matta's first show in New York took place in 1940, at the Julien
Levy Gallery, a leading showcase for the Surrealists. Two years
later, his work was featured in "Artists in Exile" at the Pierre
Matisse Gallery. As his work evolved, he continued to plumb
irrational sources, drawing inspiration from chance and accidental
paint spillage as he created a world of biomorphic beings.</TE>
<TE>   But his imagery grew more bizarre and threatening. While praising
his work of the 1940s as highly inventive, critics often dismiss much
of his later work as a sort of science fiction illustration.</TE>
<TE>   "Matta's most powerful and persuasive moment as a painter didn't
last long," Times art critic Christopher Knight wrote in his review
of the 2001 exhibition at MOCA. "By the time he returned to Europe in
1948, at the ripe old age of 37, his work had already moved in a more
illustrative direction....The work shows that an interest in imagery
was usurping a commitment to discovering vital new ways of painting."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Matta continued to receive recognition for his work.
He was commissioned to create a large mural for the UNESCO building
in Paris in 1956. Major retrospective exhibitions of his work were
presented at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1957 and at the
Georges Pompidou Center in Paris in 1985. During an interview at the
latter show, the artist described his point of view as an interest in
"the phenomenon of capturing the spark produced in the act of
understanding."</TE>
<TE>   In his private life, Matta was a notorious womanizer who left a
complicated trail of ex-wives and children. Married five times, he
was the father of six children, including artists Sebastian and
Gordon Matta-Clark, who both died in the late 1970s. Matta is
survived by his wife, Germana Ferrari Matta, their daughter, Alisee,
and three children from earlier marriages: artist Pablo Echaurren,
who lives in Italy, and musician Ramuntcho Matta and artist Federica
Matta, who both live in France.</TE>

<HD>Nguyen Is a Winner in Final Count</HD>
<DH>Garden Grove makes him the nation's first Vietnamese
American to sit on a school board.</DH>

<LD>Lan Nguyen, an attorney who for weeks was trailing in his bid for one
of two open seats on the Garden Grove Unified School District board,
was declared a winner after all Monday when a final tally gave him a
second-place finish.</LD>
<LD>   The victory makes Nguyen the first Vietnamese American in the
country to be elected to a school board, according to the Asian
Pacific American Municipal Officials, a division of the National
League of Cities.</LD>
<LD>   Nguyen received 18,777 votes to Terry Cantrell's 18,718, according
to final figures from the Orange County Registrar of Voters. Before
the provisional votes had been counted, Cantrell had 18,417 and
Nguyen had 18,341. The top vote-getter was Bob Harden with 20,745.</LD>
<TE>   Nguyen credited his victory to a strong get-out-the-vote effort in
the Vietnamese community. The Garden Grove district has the largest
Vietnamese American student population in the nation -- 28%, or about
11,000 students.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I have a chance to hopefully make a difference," said Nguyen,
who said he wants to improve communication between the large
immigrant community and school officials.</TE>
<TE>   The results shifted after tallying provisional votes -- ballots
cast at polling places by absentee voters who did not receive ballots
and those cast by voters who moved and voted where they were not
registered.</TE>
<TE>   Nguyen will go to San Francisco next week for a training session
conducted by the state's School Board Training Assn. His term
officially begins Dec. 6.</TE>

<HD>Winds Down Power Lines, Uproot Trees</HD>
<DH>No injuries are reported, however, as dusty Santa Anas blow
through. A gradual decrease is expected to begin by noon today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Haldane</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Ron and Anna Winship struggled to walk in the strong Santa Ana
winds sweeping through Newport Beach's Fashion Island on Monday, they
shared the same darkly humorous thought.</LD>
<LD>   "As we were walking under the Christmas tree," Ron Winship said,
"we were imagining tomorrow's headlines: 'Two Residents Killed by
Falling Ornaments.' "</LD>
<LD>   In fact, several of the 17,000 lights and ornaments adorning the
mall's 115-foot tree dropped like glass leaves, prompting mall
officials to cordon off the area and post guards to keep customers at
a safe distance. That was a minor inconvenience, however, compared to
the damage the 30- to 50-mph gusts did elsewhere in Orange County.</LD>
<TE>   "We've had stronger winds," said Brandt Maxwell, a meteorologist
with the National Weather Service, "but the real award today is for
the winds being so widespread."</TE>
<TE>   Maxwell said he expected the Santa Anas to begin to subside by
about noon today. "They will make a gradual decrease," he said, "but
it will still be pretty breezy in spots Tuesday night and even on
Wednesday."</TE>
<TE>   Monday's winds downed power lines, causing outages for thousands
of customers; uprooted trees across roadways and, in one case, into a
condominium complex; blew down freeway signs; caused a big rig to
jackknife on the Orange Freeway in Fullerton; and stirred up thick
clouds of dust.</TE>
<TE>   Amazingly, no injuries were reported, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "Mother Nature mugged us today," said Steve Conroy, a spokesman
for Southern California Edison, which had hundreds of workers toiling
all night to restore power.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, he said, about 16,000 customers throughout the county
experienced outages ranging from brief flickers of power interruption
to several hours of darkness. "If the winds stay with us," he said,
"we could see some additional outages."</TE>
<TE>   The California Highway Patrol reported several road closures
caused by fallen trees. The most serious tree incident, officials
said, was a 75- to 100-foot eucalyptus tree that smashed into a
condominium in the 2600 block of San Clemente's Calle del Comercio,
causing serious damage to the building but no injuries.</TE>
<TE>   "It came through the back window, and the whole ceiling came in,"
said Mary Lynn Lippert, who shares the condo with her husband and two
teenage daughters. "A big portion of the trunk is in the bedroom."</TE>
<TE>   At Fashion Island, mall officials were trying their best to put a
positive spin on the weather.</TE>
<TE>   "It's actually a very pretty day out," said Shayne Voorheis, the
mall's director of sales and marketing. "It's a nice feeling, an
autumn wind and fall harvest weather. It's putting everyone in the
mood for Thanksgiving."</TE>
<TE>   Some customers agreed. "It feels good," said Judy Migliaccio of
Huntington Beach. "It's brisk, the air is clean, and it feels like
Christmas is coming."</TE>
<TE>   Those whose livelihoods depend on sales at the mall's encampment
of outdoor carts -- most of which had to close for the day -- had a
slightly different take, however. "Outside is like a ghost town,"
said Liz Rice, who sells home furnishings from a cart at the open-air
mall.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried to keep the cart open," she said, "but everything was
flying everywhere, so I had to close. Customers were walking a little
bit faster and not stopping, especially when they heard those
ornaments falling."</TE>

<HD>John Rawls, 81; Philosopher Shaped Idea of Social Justice</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter Hong</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Rawls, a political philosopher who shaped late 20th century
notions of social justice with ideas that guided debates over topics
from affirmative action and welfare to physician-assisted suicide,
has died. He was 81.</LD>
<LD>   A Harvard University professor, Rawls died Sunday of heart failure
at his home in Lexington, Mass., according to a statement from the
university. Rawls had suffered a series of strokes, beginning in
1995, but continued to publish until last year.</LD>
<LD>   Rawls's 1971 book, "A Theory of Justice," revived the idea of the
social contract, the concept that society is a cooperative venture
from which everyone should expect to benefit.</LD>
<TE>   Social contract theories -- the subject of works by Thomas Hobbes,
John Locke and Jean Jacques Rousseau -- had been neglected in the
20th century by philosophers preoccupied with the study of logic,
linguistics and the philosophy of science.</TE>
<TE>   Rawls asserted in his writings that one's opportunities in life
are influenced by, among other factors, social and economic status.
One's prospects, therefore, are largely shaped by luck, but luck is
in turn shaped by political, social and economic systems.</TE>
<TE>   Rawls' idea of social justice, wrote philosopher Thomas Nagel,
gave it "the form that it has in contemporary discussion."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Rawls' ideas on equality and ways to achieve justice have
transformed not only philosophy but also other academic fields.
Rawls' work not only remains a staple of undergraduate classes, but
is evoked directly or indirectly in courtrooms, legislatures and
houses of worship.</TE>
<TE>   "His ideas had an electric effect on other people," Princeton
University professor Charles Beitz, a Rawls scholar, said Monday in
an interview with The Times. "No political philosopher in memory has
had the influence Rawls has had over fields such as law, economics
and sociology."</TE>
<TE>   Beitz said Rawls' profound effect on public policy debates is
ironic because the professor never sought attention outside the world
of professors and philosophers. "He never sought to write Op-Eds or
testify before Congress," Beitz said.</TE>
<TE>   Rawls did, however, take stands on issues through his academic
writing. In "A Theory of Justice," written during the Vietnam War, he
argued that a just society must provide the opportunity for true
conscientious objection to combat service.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, Rawls joined five other philosophers in submitting a
brief to the U.S. Supreme Court that argued for a right of dying
patients to choose to die. Later that year, the court refused to
grant Americans a constitutional "right to die," but it did not
preclude states from establishing laws that would establish such a
right. The ruling was considered a victory by some advocates of
physician-assisted suicide.</TE>
<TE>   Rawls believed society should follow a basic principle: Would the
haves accept the status quo if they were in the position of the
have-nots? Slavery, for instance, is unjust because a slave owner
cannot in good faith claim the system would be acceptable if he were
in the position of the slave.</TE>
<TE>   Rawls argued that inequality is acceptable only if it works to
everyone's advantage. In his view, a doctor earning a high salary is
justified in doing so if the services he provides result in better
health care for all -- including the poorest of society.</TE>
<TE>   John Bordley Rawls was born in 1921, the second of five sons in a
well-to-do Baltimore family. He attended Kent School, a Connecticut
prep school, and earned his undergraduate and doctoral degrees at
Princeton.</TE>
<TE>   Rawls was an Army infantryman during World War II, witnessing some
of the war's bloodiest battles in New Guinea and the Philippines.
Philosopher Nagel wrote that the war influenced Rawls' world view by
exposing him to "the deadly fanaticism of the Japanese army, the
murderous romanticism of the Nazis ... and the calculated massacre of
civilians by the Allies in Tokyo, Hiroshima, Nagasaki and Dresden."</TE>
<TE>   Rawls taught at Oxford, Cornell and MIT before settling at Harvard
in 1962. He published his first article at 30, his second at 34 and
his third at 37.</TE>
<TE>   After "A Theory of Justice," Rawls would not publish his second
book until 1993. "Political Liberalism" was a response to more than
30 years of criticism of his previous work.</TE>
<TE>   A stroke in 1995 left him unable to work for several years. He
nevertheless resurfaced in 1998 with "Law of Peoples" in 1998, and
"The Idea of Public Reason Revisited" in 1999. Last year, he
completed "Justice as Fairness: A Restatement."</TE>
<TE>   While Rawls seldom, if ever, attempted to influence public policy
through vocal political activism, he believed philosophy was relevant
to political and social issues. He contributed to the journal
Philosophy and Public Affairs, which applied philosophy to current
policy debates.</TE>
<TE>   Regarded by colleagues as generous and gentlemanly, Rawls also let
his ideas guide his behavior. "He was one of the most decent people
among teachers of moral philosophy," Beitz said.</TE>
<TE>   That decency is captured in an often-repeated anecdote.</TE>
<TE>   When attending a doctoral dissertation defense, Rawls reportedly
noticed that the sun was shining harshly in the candidate's eyes.
Rawls rose from his chair and stood between the candidate and the
sunlight for the rest of the session.</TE>
<TE>   Details on his survivors were not immediately available.</TE>

<LD>A key connector between Moorpark and the Santa Clara River Valley
reopened Monday, nearly five years after El Nino storms washed part
of it away.</LD>
<LD>   The redesigned three-mile stretch of Balcom Canyon Road cost
nearly $3 million. Most of the funding came in the form of disaster
relief from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.</LD>
<LD>   In February 1998, mudslides and the collapse of 200 feet of road
forced the Balcom Canyon connector to close. About 2,000 motorists
traveled the winding, two-lane road daily before its shutdown.</LD>
<TE>   Designing the new road, securing federal funding and getting
environmental permits took about 18 months. Bulldozers graded steep
hills and flattened mountaintops to prevent future landslides. High
winds and pesky yellow jackets caused further delays.</TE>
<TE>   The new road is safer, thanks to wider shoulders, guardrails and
reflective lane markers, said Butch Britt, Ventura County's deputy
director of public works. But the road is still curvy. Drivers are
advised not to travel faster than 25 mph.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't use this for a raceway," said county Supervisor Kathy Long,
who joined Supervisor Judy Mikels on Monday to reopen the road.</TE>
<TE>   To the east, Grimes Canyon Road is the more popular connector
between Moorpark and the Santa Clara River Valley. For emergencies,
Mikels said, it's good to have Balcom Canyon back in service.</TE>
<TE>   At its highest point, Balcom Canyon Road offers a sweeping view of
the surrounding mountains, the valley and citrus groves.</TE>
<TE>   The canyon had been a popular dumping ground for old and stolen
cars. The road's new design should discourage that, Britt said.</TE>
<TE>   During the reconstruction, residents along Balcom Canyon Road had
enjoyed the absence of speeding traffic, but missed the convenience
the road had allowed.</TE>
<TE>   "It was so wonderfully peaceful and quiet," said Patricia
Caldwell, one of several ranch owners along Balcom Canyon. When the
road closed, Caldwell and her husband practically stopped going to a
favorite restaurant in Santa Paula once they couldn't get over the
hill easily.</TE>
<TE>   With the reopening, "the old familiar place will once again see
our faces," she said.</TE>

<HD>School's Injunction Bid Denied</HD>
<DH>Ventura Christian High had sought temporary waiver of
land-use laws while lawsuit is pending.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Amanda Covarrubias</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge ruled Monday that a struggling Christian school in
Ventura would have to follow city land-use rules, regardless of its
religious affiliation.</LD>
<LD>   The tentative ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Christina A.
Snyder in Los Angeles will not force Ventura County Christian High
School to close, said parent Bill Bays, a plaintiff in a lawsuit
against the city.</LD>
<LD>   The private school alleges that city officials are deliberately
driving it toward bankruptcy with seldom-enforced land-use laws. It
contends the city arbitrarily demanded that the school obtain permits
for portable classrooms on the campus.</LD>
<TE>   Snyder's ruling Monday was in response to a request by the school
for an injunction that would temporarily waive the land-use laws and
allow the school to use the portable classrooms. Meantime, the
school's 54 students are taking classes in a building across the
street from the midtown campus. The lawsuit has yet to be resolved.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a setback," Bays said. "I'm disappointed, but we will
prevail."</TE>
<TE>   School attorney Nicholas P. Miller did not return phone calls.</TE>
<TE>   City Atty. Robert Boehm said the city was seeking fair treatment
for all parties, including neighbors who had complained that the
school's five portable classrooms were set too close to their
backyards.</TE>
<TE>   "We've always contended that the church was factually wrong in
regards to its assertions that they're being treated differently than
anyone else," Boehm said. "Basically, the judge is saying ... they
haven't pursued all the administrative remedies."</TE>
<TE>   At least one of those remedies would be acquiring a city permit to
use the portables.</TE>
<TE>   But to get the permit, the school would have to pay $40,000 in
traffic mitigation fees and at least $20,000 to move the portables to
another spot on the campus, money that school officials say they do
not have.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, they filed the lawsuit, contending that some city
employees had an anti-Christian bias, that city demands had caused a
sharp drop in enrollment and that the private school was not
answerable to the city but to the landlord, Ventura Unified School
District, which leased the property to the school three years ago for
$1 a year.</TE>

<HD>Tree-Sitter Hangs On During High Winds</HD>
<DH>Activists to continue protest in defiance of plans to move
the old Santa Clarita Valley oak.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Winds gusting up to 70 mph were not enough to drive activist John
Quigley from his treetop perch Monday near Santa Clarita.</LD>
<LD>   "It's been a wild ride today," Quigley said on Day 25 of his vigil
in a 400-year-old oak that he and local environmentalists are trying
to save. He said the winds had not shaken his resolve.</LD>
<LD>   "I got word about the winds in the morning, so I cleaned house up
here by tying everything down and double-strapping myself on,"
Quigley said, gripping a branch and peering down from the door-sized
plank he's called home since Nov. 1.</LD>
<TE>   Quigley was making plans to spend Thanksgiving in the tree,
nicknamed Old Glory, "as long as it stands and doesn't get blown over
in this wind."</TE>
<TE>   The experienced tree-sitter was recruited by local
environmentalists to help prevent the oak from being felled by
developers.</TE>
<TE>   Subdivision developer John Laing Homes plans to widen adjacent
Pico Canyon Road from two lanes to four to accommodate future growth
in the area.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Rattazzi, president of John Laing Homes, announced last week
that the company had decided to move the tree to a nearby park at a
cost of more than $250,000.</TE>
<TE>   Rattazzi has hired experts successful in transplanting oaks to
oversee the operation. The job is expected to begin this week.</TE>
<TE>   But Quigley and the tree supporters said they believe moving the
giant oak will kill it.</TE>
<TE>   Rosi Dagit, one of several certified arborists who examined the
tree Monday, called it a "poor candidate for transplantation."</TE>
<TE>   "If you move the tree, you are not saving it," said Dagit of the
Resource Conservation District of the Santa Monica Mountains. "The
tree might live five years, but it would be dying slowly, and all
you'd have left is expensive firewood."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, activists are making plans to continue their protest,
even if it means going to jail for trespassing.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies have made no arrests but
could be required to do so if John Laing Homes -- which owns the
property where the oak sits -- ask that Quigley and the protesters be
forcibly removed.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, the oak supporters conducted training sessions in
nonviolent resistance. If there is an attempt to remove them, they
said, it could be before Thanksgiving.</TE>
<TE>   "Any attempt to destroy this tree -- and we believe that means
moving it -- will be met with resistance," activist Tom Barron said.
"It depends on what level of obstruction is required. We have soccer
moms out here who are willing to be arrested to save Old Glory."</TE>
<TE>   The protesters said some residents are planning to bring turkey,
stuffing and all the trimmings Thursday to celebrate Thanksgiving
with them under the tree.</TE>
<TE>   Quigley said that as much as he would like to spend the holiday
with his family at home in Pacific Palisades, he'll be in the tree.</TE>

<HD>UCI to Fix Housing Unit Flaws With $11 Million Won in Court</HD>
<DH>Eight years after the student complex was built, leaks that
have caused flooding, dry rot, mold and falling tiles will finally be
plugged.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Anton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The University of California has been awarded $11 million in a
lawsuit over numerous construction defects that caused millions of
dollars in water damage to a UC Irvine student housing complex.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement, reached this month after months of mediation in
Orange County Superior Court, comes eight years after UCI's Arroyo
Vista complex was completed by a San Diego contractor, Diversified
Turnkey Construction Co., which has since gone out of business.</LD>
<LD>   The company's insurers will pay nearly $5 million for the repair
work, with the rest coming from subcontractors and their insurers.</LD>
<TE>   About three years ago, UC asked the project's bonding company,
Fireman's Fund, to pay $900,000 to cover the cost of repairing leaky
showers, tile and dry rot that have plagued Arroyo Vista and its
three dozen buildings since it opened, said UC attorney Steve
Morrell.</TE>
<TE>   When the company declined, UC filed suit in March 2000. An
investigation revealed widespread water damage and mold in walls and
ceilings, caused by defects including poorly constructed decks and
leaking windows, doors and roofs.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't realize [until then] that there were defects throughout
the project," Morrell said. "Virtually every system to keep out
rainwater had failed."</TE>
<TE>   In all, UC estimates that the construction flaws caused $15
million in damage -- about $1.5 million less than the complex cost to
build.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't a great project. It didn't come out the way it was
supposed to come out," said John Simpson, an attorney who represented
the contractor and Fireman's Fund. "We're glad to have the case
resolved."</TE>
<TE>   Repairs at Arroyo Vista are far from done, and students who pay
$345 a month for a shared unit are accustomed to dealing with clogged
plumbing, minor floods and tiles falling from shower walls.</TE>
<TE>   "We used the shower; it leaked down through the floors and it
shorted the electrical system, and the fire alarm went off," said
Adam Knapp, a senior who has lived in the complex for three years.
"The housing is actually really nice. The problems are in all the
internal things you can't see.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not that bad," he added. "And the price is right."</TE>

<HD>Vasco Guilty of Double Murder</HD>
<DH>O.C. jury didn't believe she was manipulated into aiding in
the plot to kill her lover's wife. She could be sentenced to life
without parole.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>H.G. Reza</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Anaheim woman was convicted Monday in an elaborate murder-for-hire
scheme in which a Huntington Beach doctor and his wife were gunned
down three years ago along a remote section of Ortega Highway.</LD>
<LD>   Adriana Vasco held her lawyer's hand and cried when the jury in
Santa Ana found her guilty of first-degree murder in the killing of
Carolyn Oppy-Stahl, 44, and second-degree murder in the death of Dr.
Kenneth Stahl, 57.</LD>
<LD>   The jury also found two special circumstances: lying in wait and
multiple murder, meaning she could face life in prison without parole
when she is sentenced Jan. 10. Superior Court Judge Francisco P.
Briseno has the option of sentencing her to life in prison with the
possibility of parole. The jury rejected a third special
circumstance: murder for financial gain.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors had said that Vasco had carried on a lengthy love
affair with Stahl and that together they came up with a plan to kill
Oppy-Stahl because Stahl wanted out of his marriage but feared a
divorce would ruin him financially. Prosecutors said Vasco, 35,
recruited her other boyfriend, Dennis Godley, to kill Oppy-Stahl in
exchange for $30,000 to be paid by Stahl.</TE>
<TE>   But Godley ended up shooting Stahl too, apparently to eliminate
him as a witness, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Dennis Conway. Vasco
testified at trial that she heard Stahl and Godley discuss the plan
to kill Oppy-Stahl. But she insisted that she was manipulated into
helping the doctor arrange his wife's murder and never believed it
would actually occur.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors said they didn't believe her story.</TE>
<TE>   "She's a tough, street-smart person," said juror Donald Tobias, a
Placentia resident and retired chiropractor. "[The panel] felt that
as long as she wasn't intoxicated or high, she had a pretty good idea
this would happen," Tobias said.</TE>
<TE>   Vasco and her sister, Norma Luna, began crying when the first
guilty verdict was announced. Vasco, red eyes brimming with tears,
turned around and looked at her sister.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to find a way to explain this to [Vasco's] children, that
Mom's not coming home," Luna said outside of court.</TE>
<TE>   Vasco had testified that Godley had threatened to kill her and her
two children if she revealed details of the murder plot. Godley is
scheduled to stand trial next year and has pleaded not guilty.</TE>
<TE>   Stahl and his wife were found shot multiple times inside their
car, which had the headlights on and the motor running while parked
on the shoulder of Ortega Highway. A security guard discovered the
car and the bodies inside.</TE>
<TE>   Stahl, an anesthesiologist, had taken his wife to dinner at a
Mission Viejo restaurant to celebrate her 44th birthday. Questions
immediately arose about why and how his car ended up on Ortega
Highway, which is in the opposite direction of the couple's
Huntington Beach home.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, homicide investigators were led to Vasco by calls that
Stahl had made to her from his cell phone. When questioned by
sheriff's investigators, Vasco revealed details of the plot. She told
detectives that she drove Godley to the murder scene and watched as
he shot Oppy-Stahl and Stahl.</TE>
<TE>   After her arrest, a judge ruled that Vasco's statements about the
murder plot were inadmissible because they were coerced and that her
confession had been illegally obtained.</TE>

<HD>Condors Being Inoculated for West Nile Virus</HD>
<DH>Birds at the L.A. Zoo are part of a program that started on
the East Coast. Those in national forest near Fillmore will
eventually get shots too.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Kelly</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wildlife officials have launched an intensive effort to vaccinate
California condors against the West Nile virus, which has killed
thousands of birds on the East Coast and could possibly decimate the
vulnerable condor population as the virus heads west.</LD>
<LD>   "So far we have had only isolated incidents on the West Coast, but
this has the potential to be extraordinarily scary, especially with
only 205 birds," said Bruce Palmer, coordinator of the California
Condor Recovery Program for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. "We
can't take any chances."</LD>
<LD>   The mosquito-borne virus has so far killed 4,133 wild or captive
birds. Penguins, flamingos, eagles, hawks, owls, crows and waterfowl
are especially vulnerable, officials said.</LD>
<TE>   In response, the Los Angeles Zoo has already inoculated 10 of its
32 California condors. The San Diego Zoo is vaccinating its condors.
And Boise, Idaho's Peregrine Fund, which also breeds the birds, will
follow suit this spring.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the birds are standing up well to the injections with no
side effects reported.</TE>
<TE>   That's not to say they like it.</TE>
<TE>   Mali, for one, was not amused Monday when he was hoisted onto an
examination table at the Los Angeles Zoo.</TE>
<TE>   The 20-pound condor, with red eyes and a 9-foot wingspan, stared
balefully at the three women holding his sharp beak shut and keeping
a firm grip on his scaly talons.</TE>
<TE>   Cynthia Stringfield, a zoo veterinarian, looked down the bird's
throat and felt his body for abnormalities. She drew blood from the
condor before injecting the vaccine into his leg.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-year-old condor thrashed a bit, then became still.</TE>
<TE>   "We are focusing on the captive birds first because they are the
reproductive ones," Stringfield said. "By early spring, we hope to
vaccinate all the wild birds."</TE>
<TE>   The experimental vaccine uses the DNA of the West Nile virus
rather than a live or dead virus. This is supposed to reduce the
chance of a condor getting sick or actually contracting the disease
through the process. The Centers for Disease Control created the
vaccine with DNA furnished by a bioengineering company in North
Dakota that donated the vaccines used for the condors.</TE>
<TE>   The effectiveness of the drug is still being determined.</TE>
<TE>   But giving shots to captive birds is one thing; doing it in the
wild is something else. Condors live in remote stretches of the Grand
Canyon, Big Sur and Los Padres National Forest near Fillmore. They
are monitored by satellite transmitters fastened to their bodies.
Tracking, trapping and vaccinating them will require a major effort.</TE>
<TE>   "We will certainly give this our best shot. We have 21 birds out
there," said Greg Austin, a director with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service at Hopper Mountain National Wildlife Refuge in Los Padres
National Forest. "The first 15 might be easy, and the last six could
take six months. We would need vets to come up here to do it or to
train us how to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Susie Kasielke, L.A. Zoo curator of birds, said the virus was
wreaking havoc in East Coast zoos. Colleagues have told her of
penguins, flamingos and great horned owls dying. Other animals, such
as zebras, have also been infected. Local zoo officials have not
decided which other animals to vaccinate.</TE>
<TE>   Some birds, such as chickens and sparrows, don't seem to be
susceptible to the disease, Stringfield said.</TE>
<TE>   The disease has been reported in 41 states, and health officials
believe it could arrive in California by spring, though the dry
climate makes it difficult for mosquitoes to thrive.</TE>
<TE>   Six Californians have tested positive for the virus, but five
apparently acquired it east of the Rocky Mountains.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the size of the condor population," Kasielke said, "any
infection would have long-term consequences."</TE>

<LD>The director of admissions at UC Irvine has been tapped to head
undergraduate admissions for the University of California system.</LD>
<LD>   Susan Wilbur, 52, will oversee a system that handled 95,014
student applications this year, a 32% increase in the last five
years.</LD>
<LD>   "We are in a period of tremendous growth," Wilbur said. "Very
clearly, a major issue facing us is accommodating that student
demand."</LD>
<TE>   Wilbur, who has undergraduate and graduate degrees from USC and a
doctorate in higher education from UCLA, came to UCI in 1979 as a
student recruiter. Since she took over the admissions department in
1993, the number of freshman and community college transfer
applications at UCI has nearly doubled.</TE>
<TE>   Wilbur will begin her new job in January and be based in Oakland.</TE>

<LD>   Cluff, under criminal investigation by county prosecutors, was
ordered Friday by the EIDC's executive board to take a paid leave of

<HD>91 Toll Lanes Sale to Orange County Wins Approval</HD>
<DH>Fees will continue until the road's debt is retired. Deal
clears the way for $1.6 billion in improvements to the Riverside
Freeway.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dan Weikel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After more than a year of study and deal-making, the Orange County
Transportation Authority on Monday approved a final agreement to buy
the 91 Express Lanes, a privately owned toll road that has become the
state's most controversial experiment in building highways.</LD>
<LD>   OCTA directors voted unanimously to buy the roadway from
California Private Transportation Co., which has operated the four
lanes running 10 miles down the middle of the congested Riverside
Freeway since December 1995.</LD>
<LD>   The toll lanes -- among the most expensive per-mile rides in the
nation -- have frustrated commuters and politicians alike, largely
because the owners have the right to block major improvements to the
Riverside Freeway.</LD>
<TE>   OCTA agreed in April to acquire the operation for $207.5 million
on Jan. 3, as long as the company's revenue and finances were sound.
Under the agreement, the authority will assume the operation's debts
of $135 million and pay the owners $72.5 million in cash.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans directors still must agree to the sale, but no opposition
is anticipated.</TE>
<TE>   The tollway runs from northern Anaheim to the Riverside County
line. It was one of four privately owned turnpikes approved by the
state Legislature as a way to hasten construction of new highways. So
far, it is the only one to be built.</TE>
<TE>   To help the Express Lanes succeed, Caltrans gave California
Private Transportation the extraordinary power to veto improvements
to portions of the Riverside Freeway through 2030.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say the restrictions have aggravated congestion on the
Riverside Freeway, which is the only major link between the
fast-growing Inland Empire and Orange County jobs. The sale of the
tollway to OCTA will end the noncompete agreement, clearing the way
for $1.6 billion in improvements to the Riverside Freeway. About a
third of that will be funded by Riverside County, which passed
Measure A, a sales tax initiative that will pay for transportation
projects.</TE>
<TE>   Toll revenue is important to OCTA, which intends to maintain the
toll road operation until the lanes' $135-million debt is retired.
Officials say they want to refinance the road next year with
tax-exempt bonds, a move that could lower its debt service. They say
that until they take over the operation, they can't estimate how long
it will take to retire the debt and end the tolls.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA's evaluation of the Express Lanes also shows that its
electronic toll collection system needs to be replaced at a cost of
$3 million, and the lanes need $2 million in repairs.</TE>

<KH>TIMES HOLIDAY FUND</KH>
<HD>College Child-Care Center Trains Parents</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daniel Hernandez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Going to college and raising toddlers at the same time was never
easy. For scores of parents who attend Cal Poly Pomona, it might have
been impossible.</LD>
<LD>   But right in the middle of campus, the Cal Poly Children's Center
offered a solution by providing no-cost child care.</LD>
<LD>   Some parents said they could barely have imagined that the setup
could get any better. This year, it did.</LD>
<TE>   A new program at the center focuses on training the young parents,
even as they pursue their own higher education, to become teachers at
home. Much of the focus is on preparing their children to read. And
though it means a longer day on campus and another homework
assignment, more and more parents are signing up.</TE>
<TE>   "The hardest thing for the families is that this is the end of
their day, 5:30. But they make the time to come," said director
Consuelo Rodriguez. "They look at it as so valuable. And they get to
network with other adults."</TE>
<TE>   Hasmine Belmonte, who has a 4-year-old daughter, Maya, said
parents "are always multi-tasking. When you're here, you're only
thinking about your child."</TE>
<TE>   The program, made possible with a $15,000 grant from last year's
Times Holiday Campaign, brings parents together for monthly
workshops. They do kindergarten art projects and hear their
children's teachers talk about topics ranging from self-esteem to
bedtime stories.</TE>
<TE>   The hope is that, if parents become more involved with their
children's critical early development, the children will grow up to
be better readers and communicators. To that end, the Times grant
also funded the purchase of mini-backpacks stuffed with read-along
books and art projects that parents and kids can check out for a few
nights.</TE>
<TE>   "She loves it. She wants the homework," Belmonte said of her
daughter. Maya, she said, now "realizes M works with other words and
not just with Maya. I know that she's comprehending her letters, and
I'm really proud of her."</TE>
<TE>   The Children's Center is a bustling cluster of low buildings where
about 70 children, 2 to 4 years old, are cared for daily by a few
teachers. Parents come by for playtime between classes and during
lunch breaks. The day-care aspect, Belmonte said, has been all
important. She and her husband "wouldn't be in school if it weren't
for the center."</TE>
<TE>   The Holiday Campaign was established in 2000, and is part of the
Los Angeles Times Family Fund, a fund of the McCormick Tribune
Foundation. The foundation matches the first $700,000 raised at 50
cents on the dollar. Last year, the holiday appeal and matching funds
from the foundation raised $653,000, which was granted to 56
charities serving Southern California.</TE>

<HD>Despite Noise, Track Operator Hopes to Stay in Driver's
Seat</HD>
<DH>Jim Naylor, guiding spirit of the Ventura Raceway for 25
years, is working to lower the decibels. His contract is up for
renewal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Chawkins</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Approaching 56, Jim Naylor speaks with the ceaseless passion of a man
who has spent most of his life watching small cars whip at high speed
around a tiny dirt oval.</LD>
<LD>   But he doesn't raise his voice. Noise from the Ventura Raceway has
become a hot political issue and Naylor, the track's promoter,
bulldozer operator, announcer and guiding spirit for 25 years, has no
desire to add to it.</LD>
<LD>   Today, Naylor's contract to run the raceway at the Seaside Park
fairgrounds will be up for a one-year renewal. A Ventura County Fair
Board committee has recommended approving it -- but only after
acrimonious meetings packed with racing fans, a barrage of angry
letters to the editor and accusations of just plain snobbery.</LD>
<TE>   "They think the raceway is a bunch of dirt, and it must be dirty
people who play in it," said racing supporter Ron Barrett, a Ventura
software developer. "We're seeing a cultural division between those
of us in the dirt and those who like a more cosmopolitan atmosphere."</TE>
<TE>   Raceway critics like Doug Halter disagree.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people think it's a classist issue, but that's not it,"
said Halter, a downtown businessman and a founder of the Laurel
Theatre. "Anyone trying to spend an evening at home on the hillside,
or in midtown, or on the west side, shouldn't have to put up with the
noise. There could be a lot of better uses for Seaside Park."</TE>
<TE>   The issue is made more urgent by a rapidly gentrifying downtown
just blocks away and plans for a four-star, 140-room ocean-side hotel
practically next door.</TE>
<TE>   During an eight-month race season beginning in March, everything
from midget racers to sprint and stock cars thunder around the track.</TE>
<TE>   For Naylor, the conflict is the biggest threat ever to his baby,
the fifth-of-a-mile-long brown strip into which he says he has poured
countless hours and dollars.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how much it's been," he said. "I don't want to know.
I don't have a good long-term memory -- that's got to be the only
reason I do this."</TE>
<TE>   Naylor grew up in Port Hueneme, where his father operated heavy
equipment for the Navy. Jim Sr. raced at tracks here and there,
tinkered on his cars with young Jim by his side and passed on to his
son a zest for racing's perpetual left turn.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're around motor-heads as much as I was, you get addicted
to it -- the sounds, the smells, the whole nine yards," Naylor said.</TE>
<TE>   A sometime racer himself, Naylor came up with $22,000 to buy the
failing operation at Ventura's fairgrounds in 1977. He ran it as a
family affair, with his dad hopping on the raceway's battered
bulldozer to mold the track until he died two years later.</TE>
<TE>   Naylor's mother, Ann, answered the phones, as she still does. His
two daughters grew up amid the roar of the engines, doing all kinds
of raceway chores.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Naylor built the place up. He promoted
let-it-all-hang-out motorcycle racing with the likes of "Flyin' "
Mike Faria and "Sudden Sam" Ermolenko. He enlarged the track,
installed a press box and new lights and staged gimmicky promotions:
mud wrestling night, wet T-shirt contests, a visit from streakers,
the crowd-pleasing occasion when fans dashed onto the track to snatch
up $1,000 in small bills.</TE>
<TE>   For a couple of years, Naylor offered a "Blind Man's Bluff" race
each month, in which hooded drivers piloted Ford Pintos around the
track as a passenger gave directions. The popular stunt was done on
behalf of Greg Kauffman, a blind mechanic.</TE>
<TE>   "We did it," Naylor said, "so Greg could race."</TE>
<TE>   Naylor doesn't spend much time away from racing. Recently, he
spent most of a month's time off downloading the sounds of train
whistles, gunshots, crying babies, oinking pigs and hundreds of other
effects to go with his excited lap-by-lap announcing patter.</TE>
<TE>   Naylor explodes into excitement at every turn, narrating a race
the way a breathless survivor might recall a train wreck. The
look-at-'em-go exclamations are the same whether the race involves
midget cars or the 800-horsepower sprint cars that look like Darth
Vader's boyhood toys.</TE>
<TE>   "I shouldn't be an announcer," Naylor said. "I'm dyslexic. But I
was unhappy with the announcers I had, and about 15 years ago, I
couldn't afford another one."</TE>
<TE>   His most grueling work, though, happens before and after each race
night as he climbs atop his tractor and other heavy equipment. He
loves currying the track and clearing the parking area the way other
men love watching football. Saying he has donated a small fortune in
free services to the fairgrounds, he grows animated when he
reminisces about past storms and the mountains of mud they forced him
to move in the middle of the night.</TE>
<TE>   But the raceway has never provided Naylor a living. He also runs
JN Designs, a high-tech sign shop in Oxnard, where, among other
things, he "Naylorizes" cars with a rogue's gallery of racing
graphics.</TE>
<TE>   "He'd put twice as many stripes on the car as necessary," said
racer Charlie Utts, 41, of Camarillo. "You'd go, 'Oh my God, what's
he doing, what's he doing?' "</TE>
<TE>   Like many other track loyalists, Utts is drawn to Naylor's homey
touches, like his yearly barbecue for fair workers, his occasional
big chili feeds and the candy tosses he used to stage for the kids.</TE>
<TE>   Racing at Ventura is a great equalizer, Utts says: "My grandmother
goes out there. Parnelli Jones has been out there. Paul Newman has
been out there!"</TE>
<TE>   A racing buff, Newman rents the track from time to time for
himself and a few friends, including Christian Fittipaldi, a star
driver on the team Newman owns.</TE>
<TE>   "When they're done, Mr. Newman shakes everyone's hand," Naylor
said. " 'Great track tonight, Jim -- thanks for preparing it,' he
tells me. He's the nicest man you'd ever want to meet."</TE>
<TE>   That is what Naylor says he likes best about the raceway: CEOs and
celebrities rubbing shoulders with shade-tree mechanics.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a common bond," he said. "There's no longer a chain of
command. It's all about racing."</TE>
<TE>   How much longer Naylor's brand of dirt-track democracy will last
is anyone's guess.</TE>
<TE>   Once the biggest racing market in the United States, Southern
California has been home to 172 tracks over the years, with about two
dozen operating at once in racing's heyday in the 1950s, according to
racing historian Harold Osmer. A dozen tracks survive, with a number
shut down by noise complaints from neighborhoods that sprouted
nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Naylor totes a hand-held, digital decibel meter in his glove
compartment. He explains that a loud voice registers at 80 and the
Angels' fans red "thunder sticks" topped 116 outside Edison Field
during the World Series. He said he has been trying to work down from
the mid-90s to below 90 in the area just outside the track, planting
trees as a sound barrier and requiring racers to install
sophisticated mufflers.</TE>
<TE>   He also has abandoned loud "tune-and-test" sessions on weekdays --
an action that drew praise from Halter and other critics. But he
isn't sure when the fun at Ventura Raceway will be back up to speed.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had a black cloud hanging over us," Naylor said. "Maybe
next year we'll get back to being a little more goofy."</TE>

<HD>Oh, Are You Saying This Check Is Supposed to Be Made Out in
My Name?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For today's stupid criminal trick, the L.A. Independent reported that
a woman was arrested for forgery after she walked into a bank and
tried to cash a check that "had gotten wet and had been repaired with
transparent tape." The check had been "made out to another person,
and the suspect was attempting to cash it with a driver's license
that belonged to someone else." Just one thing puzzles me: What made
the bank suspicious?</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Don't try to pet them, either: In Death Valley, Bill Anderson
noticed a warning to leave the corralled creatures alone (see photo).</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wholly confusing: Peter Woelper of San Dimas came upon a for-sale
sign that might have reflected the refinisher's sentiment. (see
photo). And the church bench apparently had an unusual design.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Stop the slaughter! Not only did USC defeat UCLA for the fourth
straight time Saturday, but the Trojans chalked up the most points
(52) in the series since a 52-0 victory in 1930.</TE>
<TE>   After that 1930 rout, by the way, the two schools agreed to
suspend their series because USC was just too powerful for its
Westwood foe. They didn't play each other again until 1936. In all
fairness, I think it's time for another break. Right now, UCLA is
obviously not in USC's class. I could see resuming the series in six
years -- if UCLA's football program has recovered.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Clothes unmake the man: I guess that's what I get for wearing
scruffy clothes and a scruffy beard. Walking near the Seal Beach
pier, I needed a quarter to buy a newspaper and asked a passerby if
he would accept two dimes and a nickel in exchange. A toothless
street person overheard part of the conversation and asked me, "What
do you need, buddy?"</TE>
<TE>   He pulled out a wad of cash, explaining that someone had just
given him $20. The generous fellow was willing to give an obvious
down-and-outer like myself whatever I needed to get through the day.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MiscelLAny: The police log of Cal Poly Pomona's Post newspaper
said that "a fight was broken up on the lawn at Montecito Hall.</TE>
<TE>   "A student admitted that he took a fraternity's mascot, a toy fire
truck.</TE>
<TE>   "The electric toy was thrown into the duck pond and ruined by the
water. The student was issued a citation and promised to replace the
toy."</TE>
<TE>   And that concludes our leaders-of-tomorrow report.</TE>

<HD>To the Church, It Was a Case of 'Dirty Dancing'</HD>
<DH>Pastor says expulsion of arts program protects children.
Others say the homosexuality of some staff members played a role in
the decision.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Cara Mia DiMassa</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>All Pastor Edgar Chacon wanted to do, he says now, was protect the
children. If a child were to stumble across a snake, he says, he
would kill the snake to save the child.</LD>
<LD>   This time, he killed the dancing.</LD>
<LD>   A nonprofit arts program was evicted last week from the campus of
the church where Chacon presides. As a way to build self-esteem and
artistic talent, the program encouraged kids to dance and practice
yoga.</LD>
<TE>   With Chacon casting the tie-breaking vote, the board of Santa
Anita Wesleyan Church in El Monte voted to close the after-school
program, called Creative Planet.</TE>
<TE>   Yoga, Chacon said, is a pagan practice and should be banned.
Modern dance is also taboo.</TE>
<TE>   "If these children are learning how to dance, it will be so easy
for them when they get to be in any discotheque, because they will
already know how to dance. And discotheques are not the best
places.... In those places, the young people can get drugs and
knowledge of things that do not edify them.</TE>
<TE>   "In my mind, I did the right thing," said Chacon, who was reached
by phone in the Dominican Republic, where he is attending a church
conference. "I am protecting the children."</TE>
<TE>   The decision mystified Creative Planet students, most of whom do
not attend the church.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm heartbroken," said Lydia Renteria, 11, an aspiring singer and
dancer who had been hoping to get a solo in the program's Christmas
show. "This place has been like a second home for me."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Lydia and other students helped Bill C. Rugh, the
director of Creative Planet, move out of the building it has occupied
for nearly a year and a half.</TE>
<TE>   Rugh's family has been involved with Santa Anita Wesleyan since
the 1930s, and the controversy over Creative Planet has severed those
ties.</TE>
<TE>   Rugh taught third and fourth grade at the church's elementary
school, and his father, Bill E. Rugh, was treasurer of the church
board until he resigned last week in protest. His mother, Kathryn,
was principal of the elementary school, but quit her job after she
was ordered to discipline her son for his efforts to save Creative
Planet.</TE>
<TE>   When the church board voted to close Creative Planet, it also
fired Bill C. Rugh from his teaching job. (His brother, Robert,
remains on the church board.)</TE>
<TE>   Bill C. Rugh, who has worked as a dancer and actor, started
Creative Planet with the belief that students well-rounded in the
arts develop higher self-esteem. Many of the students attending the
program come from communities where resources for arts education are
lacking.</TE>
<TE>   When Creative Planet began in mid-2001, Santa Anita Wesleyan's
pastor at the time, Dave Ellis, supported Rugh's goals and gave him
access to an eight-room former nursery school on the church campus.</TE>
<TE>   The church board approved Creative Planet, which in addition to
yoga and modern dance, offered courses in acting, music, voice,
ballet, tap dance and creative writing.</TE>
<TE>   The church provided no financial support for Creative Planet, said
Rugh, who paid most costs out of his own pocket, because many of the
program's 48 students attended on scholarship. He called upon friends
in the entertainment industry --including actress Elizabeth Berkley
and writer Terry Haley of "Married With Children" -- to teach and
mentor students.</TE>
<TE>   But soon after Creative Planet opened, Ellis left to work at
Wesleyan Church headquarters in Indiana, and Chacon became pastor.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew he was conservative," said Bill E. Rugh, one of three
board members who voted to keep Creative Planet open. "But not this
much."</TE>
<TE>   Bill C. Rugh tried to save his program. Children wrote letters,
parents sent e-mails. Some parents boycotted the church elementary
school for a day. Others pulled their children out of the school
altogether.</TE>
<TE>   As a result of that campaign, Rugh was fired for insubordination,
he and his parents said.</TE>
<TE>   Most board members did not return calls seeking comment, but Bill
E. Rugh said the meeting held to decide the program's fate had been
divisive, with members criticizing a Creative Planet performance in
October at the L.A. Arts Open House.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think they understood," he said. "They were stuck on this
German song by Beethoven."</TE>
<TE>   The chorus the children sang, "O Welche Lust!" is from "Fidelio."
The opera is set in a prison, and the chorus evokes the gratitude of
prisoners briefly allowed outside their cells.</TE>
<TE>   Rugh said church leaders misinterpreted the German lust as the
English "lust." A translation of the opening lines gives a far
different meaning:</TE>
<TE>   "O welche lust!/ In freier Luft/Den Athem leicht zu heben" ...
"Oh, what enjoyment/ to breathe the fresh air of heaven."</TE>
<TE>   When asked about the performance, which portrayed the dream
travels of a young boy with both secular and religious music, Chacon
said that it had featured an "evil" modern dance.</TE>
<TE>   Bill C. Rugh's defenders say another issue has been lurking behind
criticisms of Creative Planet: Rugh is gay, and some of his teachers
are as well.</TE>
<TE>   Rugh said Creative Planet students and parents have long known of
his homosexuality. "I sing with the Gay Men's Chorus. I was on an
episode of 'Will &amp; Grace,' " the popular television sitcom that
features two gay characters. "It's not like they didn't know."</TE>
<TE>   The issue was raised at a Nov. 7 church meeting, according to the
San Gabriel Valley Tribune, which reported that board member David
Herrera had told fellow congregants that the "kingdom" did not
approve of homosexuality.</TE>
<TE>   At a meeting with the three board members who eventually voted to
close Creative Planet, Rugh said, his own sexuality never came up.
"But they asked me if I had gay teachers," he said. "I said yes, and
they asked me to fire them. I refused. I told them the few teachers
they thought were gay weren't the ones who are gay."</TE>
<TE>   Rugh hopes to find a new location for Creative Planet.</TE>
<TE>   Chacon, meanwhile, hopes to open a program that would teach
computers and Spanish -- "things that we believe would be better for
the children."</TE>
<TE>   And, perhaps, less controversial.</TE>
<TE>   "I told myself, 'Well, the parents will be happy that somebody is
taking care of the children,' " he said. "But what a surprise I
had.... They were so mad with me."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A surcharge to encourage water conservation is showing up in
customers' bills for the first time, and some major consumers are
getting hit big.</LD>
<LD>   The surcharge makes residents and businesses pay extra for water
they use over a specified level. The charge appears to be working;
compared to the same period last year, water use was down 10% in the
September-October billing period.</LD>
<LD>   While 75% of customers used less than the limit, some saw
increases: A Moonstone Beach Drive motel got a bill of nearly
$13,000, with a $6,400 surcharge.</LD>

<LD>A group affiliated with the Boy Scouts of America lost a bid Monday
to continue to get free berthing at Berkeley Marina.</LD>
<LD>   The city of Berkeley halted free berthing for the Sea Scouts in
1998 because of the group's policies against gays. The Scouts sued,
and the 1st District Court of Appeal ruled Monday that they did not
have a case.</LD>
<LD>   Berkeley provided free berthing for six decades, but stopped after
it passed a 1997 ordinance forbidding the city from subsidizing
groups that discriminate.</LD>

<LD>Some farmers are contemplating creating their own school district,
because they don't like the way Madera Unified is operated. They deny
it's because they don't want to pay more taxes after a $46-million
school bond was approved by voters Nov. 5.</LD>
<LD>   Farmer Dennis Meisner said school officials have talked about
redistricting for years, and denies growers are proposing to pull out
of the district after voters approved Measure B.</LD>
<LD>   Growers opposed the bond, saying it would unfairly tax landowners
with large properties.</LD>

<HD>Hunger Striker Stands Firm on Trees</HD>
<DH>After 50 days, woman is still waiting for Davis to agree to
save the state's old-growth forests.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Bailey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>For 50 days, she is said to have survived on water and a bit of
broth, spending daylight hours in quiet protest under the boughs of a
towering old redwood beside the state Capitol.</LD>
<LD>   Susan Moloney has waged her hunger strike on the lawn of the
Capitol to make a point about trees with the man who presides inside.
When he first ran for office four years ago, Gov. Gray Davis vowed to
save California's old-growth forests. He hasn't, as Moloney sees it,
and she wants him to live up to that long-ago campaign promise.</LD>
<LD>   "It is indeed sad we have to do these kinds of things to get
attention," Moloney said Monday.</LD>
<TE>   The governor refuses to be budged by this one-woman protest,
saying through a spokesman that those remarks from the 1998 election
stump have been misconstrued by Moloney and the media and that he has
in fact saved plenty of the old trees.</TE>
<TE>   "Public policy is not made by refusing to eat," said Steve
Maviglio, Davis' spokesman. "This sort of thing is a publicity stunt,
not an effort for meaningful change."</TE>
<TE>   So they remained at loggerheads Monday on the cusp of a holiday
known for feasting, not fasting: Moloney, the hunger striker, who
thinks every tree older than the state's founding in 1850 should be
spared the chain saw; and Davis, the governor, whose foes say only
big contributions get big results.</TE>
<TE>   Moloney was joined Monday by Julia Butterfly Hill, the tree sitter
whose epic two-year vigil in the branches of a Humboldt County
redwood ended in 1999 after loggers agreed to sell the tree to a
nonprofit organization.</TE>
<TE>   During a news conference Monday on the Capitol steps, Hill vowed
to spend Thanksgiving week -- and perhaps longer -- fasting with
Moloney to prod the governor toward adopting blanket protection for
California's oldest trees.</TE>
<TE>   "We're tired of the lies and tired of the spin," Hill said. "Now
is the time for Gov. Davis to stop running from his promise."</TE>
<TE>   Over the past 50 days, Moloney said, she has seen her weight drop
more than 20 pounds. At 5-foot-5, she is now a gaunt 107 pounds.
Bones in her hips and shoulders that never showed before now jut out.
A native of New York, Moloney was a computer programmer until she
moved to Humboldt County in the mid-90s and became an environmental
activist. She's now executive director of the Campaign for Old
Growth, a grass-roots group trying to put a measure on the state
ballot to ban axing all trees more than 152 years old. The group
tried to get an initiative on the November ballot, but failed to
gather enough signatures.</TE>
<TE>   The ballot measure is only the most recent cause in the war to
save the North Coast redwoods, which has raged virtually unabated for
more than a decade. With plenty of tree-sitting activists already in
place on private timber tracts, Moloney began the hunger strike Oct.
7 as a new approach to get Davis' attention.</TE>
<TE>   Each workday, she spends several hours in a canvas-backed camping
chair. "It's not a Lazee Boy," she quipped, "but it's not bad."
Overhead is the huge redwood tree dedicated to Gil Murray, a timber
industry lobbyist who was the last victim of Unabomber Ted Kaczynski.</TE>
<TE>   Early on, a few passersby gave Moloney a razzing. One even asked,
"Want a hamburger?" Moloney, in fact, is a strict vegetarian. But
mostly, Moloney said, she has heard only kind words of support and
sympathy. Some people come up with tears in their eyes, she said,
asking that she not hurt herself.</TE>
<TE>   Though one Capitol worker claims to have seen Moloney sneaking a
few Cheerios, the activist says she subsisted for the first 40 days
only on water and herbal tea. After visiting a registered nurse,
Moloney added vegetable broth and freshly juiced carrot and apple to
her diet.</TE>
<TE>   The worst effect, she said, has been a growing inability to
withstand the foggy fall cold of Sacramento. She tries to outsmart it
with layers of clothing. But she can last only about three hours
outside now, forced to retreat to a friend's apartment for warmth. On
weekends, she usually gets a ride home to Garberville to be with her
family, where she said she continues to fast.</TE>
<TE>   Some friends are worried she may be taking this cause too far.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been begging her to quit," said Kent Stromsmoe, a Campaign
for Old Growth activist. "I'm concerned the fast will affect her
judgment. That she won't be reasonable about knowing when she should
stop."</TE>
<TE>   Moloney, who has started a Web site (www.fastforoldgrowth.org) to
chart her effort, said she has no illusions about carrying on too
long, no desire to compromise her long-term health. She said her
mental acuity remains intact, and indeed during talks she seems
sharp.</TE>
<TE>   "I can feel it taking its toll in several ways," she said. "But I
also feel very strong about carrying this through."</TE>
<TE>   On March 14, 1998, Davis was quoted by the Associated Press
declaring to the state Planning and Conservation League in Sacramento
that if elected he would ensure "all old-growth trees are spared from
the lumberjack's ax." "His promise is unequivocal," Moloney said.
"He's made excuse after excuse about it. Now we want him to make some
positive movement toward saving old growth. That's what it's going to
take."</TE>
<TE>   She suggests that the governor agree to endorse her group's
proposal to save heritage trees or declare an emergency moratorium on
old-growth harvests. Though the Davis administration played a key
role in forging the 1999 public purchase of the revered Headwaters
grove in Humboldt County, Moloney said about 7 million old trees
remain vulnerable throughout the state.</TE>
<TE>   Maviglio, the governor's spokesman, said Davis in fact has a
better record of saving ancient trees than any of his predecessors.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from helping forge the Headwaters deal, which spared 7,400
acres of redwood and 1,500 of ancient trees, the Davis administration
has altered logging rules to require an environmental review before
old-growth trees are cut, Maviglio said. Virtually all of
California's ecologically significant old-growth redwood forest is
now protected in state or federal parks. During Davis' watch, the
state has purchased more than 30,000 acres of second- and
third-generation forest in Del Norte and Mendocino counties.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we need to judge the governor on what he's done,"
Maviglio said. "There are activists who won't be satisfied unless no
trees are cut down. The governor has had to weigh such beliefs
against the thousands of jobs on the North Coast that depend on the
timber industry."</TE>
<TE>   A week ago, Davis sent his forestry chief, Andrea Tuttle, out to
talk with Moloney, Maviglio said. There was no compromising, no
agreement by either camp. Davis is "absolutely" concerned about
Moloney's welfare, Maviglio said, but is convinced she has an
extremist viewpoint.</TE>
<TE>   Moloney said she figures the governor needs to hear from people
like her. Though not a big campaign donor, she said, she represents
thousands of Californians who want to save the trees -- and a lot
more who expect campaign-trail vows to be kept.</TE>
<TE>   "All I know is he made an important promise when he wanted our
vote," Moloney said. "Now he seems far more interested in the desires
of the timber industry than the wishes of the majority of people in
the state."</TE>

<HD>$11-Million Court Award Will Repair Faulty Work on Housing
at UC Irvine</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Anton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The University of California has been awarded $11 million in a
lawsuit over numerous construction defects that caused millions of
dollars in water damage to a UC Irvine student housing complex.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement, reached this month after months of mediation in
Orange County Superior Court, comes eight years after UC Irvine's
Arroyo Vista complex was completed by a San Diego contractor,
Diversified Turnkey Construction Co., which has since gone out of
business.</LD>
<LD>   The company's insurers will pay nearly $5 million for the repair
work, with the rest coming from subcontractors and their insurers.</LD>
<TE>   About three years ago, UC asked the project's bonding company,
Fireman's Fund, to pay $900,000 to cover the cost of repairing leaky
showers, tile and dry rot that have plagued Arroyo Vista and its
three dozen buildings since it opened, said UC attorney Steve
Morrell.</TE>
<TE>   When the company declined, the university system filed suit in
March 2000. An investigation revealed widespread water damage and
mold in walls and ceilings, caused by defects including poorly
constructed decks and leaking windows, doors and roofs.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't realize [until then] that there were defects throughout
the project," Morrell said. "Virtually every system to keep out
rainwater had failed."</TE>
<TE>   In all, UC estimates that the construction flaws caused $15
million in damage -- about $1.5 million less than the complex cost to
build.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't a great project. It didn't come out the way it was
supposed to come out," said John Simpson, an attorney who represented
the contractor and Fireman's Fund. "We're glad to have the case
resolved."</TE>
<TE>   Repairs at Arroyo Vista are far from done, and students who pay
$345 a month for a shared unit are accustomed to dealing with clogged
plumbing, minor floods and tiles falling from shower walls.</TE>
<TE>   "We used the shower, it leaked down through the floors and it
shorted the electrical system, and the fire alarm went off," said
Adam Knapp, a senior who has lived in the complex for three years.
"The housing is actually really nice. The problems are in all the
internal things you can't see.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not that bad," he added. "And the price is right."</TE>

<HD>Woman Found Guilty in O.C. Double Murder</HD>
<DH>Jurors didn't believe Adriana Vasco was manipulated into
aiding in the plot to kill her lover's wife. She may face life
without parole.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>H.G. Reza</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Anaheim woman was convicted Monday in an elaborate murder-for-hire
scheme in which a Huntington Beach doctor and his wife were gunned
down three years ago along a remote section of Ortega Highway.</LD>
<LD>   Adriana Vasco held her lawyer's hand and cried when the jury in
Santa Ana found her guilty of first-degree murder in the killing of
Carolyn Oppy-Stahl, 44, and second-degree murder in the death of Dr.
Kenneth Stahl, 57.</LD>
<LD>   The jury also found two special circumstances: lying in wait and
multiple murder, meaning she could face life in prison without parole
when she is sentenced Jan. 10. Superior Court Judge Francisco P.
Briseno has the option of sentencing her to life in prison with the
possibility of parole. The jury rejected a third special
circumstance: murder for financial gain.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors had said that Vasco had carried on a lengthy love
affair with Stahl and that together they came up with a plan to kill
Oppy-Stahl because Stahl wanted out of his marriage but feared a
divorce would ruin him financially. Prosecutors said Vasco, 35,
recruited her other boyfriend, Dennis Godley, to kill Oppy-Stahl in
exchange for $30,000 to be paid by Stahl.</TE>
<TE>   But Godley ended up shooting Stahl too, apparently to eliminate
him as a witness, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Dennis Conway. Vasco
testified at trial that she heard Stahl and Godley discuss the plan
to kill Oppy-Stahl. But she insisted that she was manipulated into
helping the doctor arrange his wife's murder and never believed it
would actually occur.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors said they didn't believe her story.</TE>
<TE>   "She's a tough, street-smart person," said juror Donald Tobias, a
Placentia resident and retired chiropractor. "[The panel] felt that
as long as she wasn't intoxicated or high, she had a pretty good idea
this would happen," Tobias said.</TE>
<TE>   Vasco and her sister, Norma Luna, began crying when the first
guilty verdict was announced. Vasco, red eyes brimming with tears,
turned around and looked at her sister.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to find a way to explain this to [Vasco's] children, that
Mom's not coming home," Luna said outside of court.</TE>
<TE>   Vasco had testified that Godley had threatened to kill her and her
two children if she revealed details of the murder plot. Godley is
scheduled to stand trial next year and has pleaded not guilty.</TE>
<TE>   Stahl and his wife were found shot multiple times inside their
car, which had the headlights on and the motor running while parked
on the shoulder of Ortega Highway. A security guard discovered the
car and the bodies inside.</TE>
<TE>   Stahl, an anesthesiologist, had taken his wife to dinner at a
Mission Viejo restaurant to celebrate her 44th birthday. Questions
immediately arose about why and how his car ended up on Ortega
Highway, which is in the opposite direction of the couple's
Huntington Beach home.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, homicide investigators were led to Vasco by calls that
Stahl had made to her from his cell phone. When questioned by
sheriff's investigators, Vasco revealed details of the plot. She told
detectives that she drove Godley to the murder scene and watched as
he shot Oppy-Stahl and Stahl.</TE>
<TE>   After her arrest, a judge ruled that Vasco's statements about the
murder plot were inadmissible because they were coerced and that her
confession had been illegally obtained.</TE>

<HD>Route 66 Marks Several Paths Through City</HD>
<DH>Historic 'mother road' from Chicago to L.A. was realigned
many times. Contradictory signs trace its varied routes in Los
Angeles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hugo Martin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>L.A. loves fakes. Fake lips. Fake breasts. Fake names (Ice Cube, Ice
T, Mr. T).</LD>
<LD>   This is, after all, the entertainment capital of the world. It's
all about faking it.</LD>
<LD>   A reader wondered if Los Angeles' propensity to put up a false
front extends to Route 66, the historic "mother road" from Chicago to
Los Angeles. The road, though no longer an officially designated
route, has been celebrated in books ("The Grapes of Wrath"), song
("Get Your Kicks on Route 66") and a TV series ("Route 66").</LD>
<TE>   Alex Smith of Los Angeles wrote to Behind the Wheel to point out
that his map book shows several routes, including a few that parallel
each other, all claiming the Route 66 title.</TE>
<TE>   Question: How can there be two or more Route 66s running parallel
so close?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: There are several roads with that designation because the
route had several alignments over its 80 years or so of official
existence.</TE>
<TE>   For example, three roads from South Pasadena to downtown Los
Angeles -- Figueroa Street, Huntington Drive and the Pasadena Freeway
-- all bear the historic Route 66 signs.</TE>
<TE>   Here is how it happened: In 1926, Route 66 ran west along Colorado
Boulevard, south along Fair Oaks Avenue, then southwest along
Huntington Drive, eventually ending in downtown Los Angeles, said Dan
Harlow, a board member of the California Route 66 Museum in
Victorville.</TE>
<TE>   In 1937, state and federal officials moved Route 66 to Figueroa
Street, a wider, more accessible road with a more direct route to
Santa Monica and the ocean. When the Arroyo Seco Parkway (also known
as the Pasadena Freeway) opened in 1940, government officials once
again realigned the route, giving the parkway the Route 66
designation, Harlow said.</TE>
<TE>   While the route was moved several times, historians and road buffs
have lobbied to put up the historic designations -- the Route 66
signs -- to memorialize the past routes.</TE>
<TE>   Still confused? Think of it this way: Last year, Motor Trend
magazine named the Chrysler PT Cruiser as "Car of the Year." This
year, the title may go to a snazzier model with better acceleration,
plusher seats or more headroom. In Los Angeles, it seems the Route 66
designation has simply been transferred over time to the newer,
snazzier road.</TE>
<TE>   Make sense?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Morbid curiosity. It's that odious human trait that makes
motorists slow down and stare at the sight of a car accident or a
police stop on the side of the road.</TE>
<TE>   Statistics from the California Department of Transportation show
that rubbernecking alone can reduce freeway speed by as much as 26%.</TE>
<TE>   Patty Boyle of Westchester wrote to point out that, a few years
ago, Caltrans built several areas on the side of Los Angeles freeways
that are shielded from traffic by 6-foot-high fences. The sites were
designed so that motorists stopped by police or involved in minor
accidents could pull behind the fences, thus giving looky-loos
nothing to looky at.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Do you know if the (accident investigation sites) are actually
used and, if so, what their effectiveness has been?</TE>
<TE>   A: Caltrans built 12 of these sites on the Harbor, San Diego and
Santa Monica freeways in the early 1990s. Caltrans officials say the
sites are used often, but the state has not completed any studies to
confirm this.</TE>
<TE>   Still, such a study may be moot. Caltrans officials say they have
built no more accident investigation sites because they have simply
run out of available freeway real estate. Whatever excess freeway
space is available is now being swallowed up to add carpool lanes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of getting an eyeful on the road, Deane Bottorf of Corona
del Mar wrote to recount a frightening experience on a city street.
While cruising around recently, he saw what looked like an unoccupied
car pull up alongside him. Bottorf eventually discovered that the
driver of the car was sitting so low in the seat that he could barely
peer over the top of the dashboard.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Is it illegal?</TE>
<TE>   A: Unfortunately, Bottorf's experience is not unique. CHP Officer
Alex Delgadillo said lots of drivers in Southern California think it
is hip or cool to sink really low in the seat while driving.</TE>
<TE>   It's called lowriding and it has been around for decades. Remember
the 1970s tune by the band War? "The low rider drives a little slower
... Low rider, is a real goer."</TE>
<TE>   It may be bad posture, and your mother may not approve, but it is
not illegal to slouch while driving. "It has come up in the past, but
there is nothing we can do," Delgadillo said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Clark of Azusa wrote to say that he gets steamed when he
sees so many out-of-state license plates on Southern California
freeways. He wants these newcomers to do the right thing and register
those cars. (Hey, our debt-ridden state can use the fees.)</TE>
<TE>   Q: I realize that there are a lot more important concerns for the
Highway Patrol, but I was just wondering if anything is ever done
about this?</TE>
<TE>   A: State law requires a motorist to register for a California
license plate within 20 days of accepting employment or establishing
residence in California. But this violation does not get
high-priority enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   CHP officers do not stop motorists with out-of-state plates solely
to make sure they are abiding by this law. If a CHP officer stops a
motorist for another offense, such as speeding, and notices the
out-of-state plates, then the officer can investigate and write a
citation.</TE>
<TE>   Concerned folks like Patrick also can tip off the CHP or the
Department of Motor Vehicles if they know of such a scofflaw in the
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   But as long as these newcomers to the state stay on good terms
with police and neighbors, they can drive around for a while without
registering.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe what California needs is a statewide campaign. We can post
billboards at the state borders that read: "Welcome to California.
Now Register Your Car."</TE>

<HD>High Winds Bully Trees, Trucks, Raise Fire Fears</HD>
<DH>Southland officials report no serious accidents or
injuries. More gusts, some as high as 70 mph, are expected through
tonight.</DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Blustery Santa Ana winds whipped across Southern California on
Monday, yanking down power lines, flipping trees and big rigs and
momentarily reaching hurricane speeds at spots in the San Fernando
Valley.</LD>
<LD>   Forecasters warned that the hair-dryer effect, which has fire
officials on high alert, would continue through tonight.</LD>
<LD>   "Mother Nature mugged us today," said Steve Conroy, a spokesman
for Southern California Edison. More than 40,000 homes lost power at
some point Monday, and the utility had crews working through the
night to restore service.</LD>
<TE>   Winds briefly hit speeds of 77 mph in the Verdugo Hills north of
Glendale and 78 mph in the Angeles National Forest on Monday night,
said Stuart Seto of the National Weather Service.</TE>
<TE>   But to emergency workers' relief, no major fires, accidents or
injuries were reported.</TE>
<TE>   A family in San Clemente escaped injury when the wind shoved a 75-
to 100-foot eucalyptus tree into their home.</TE>
<TE>   "It came through the back window and the whole ceiling came in,"
said Mary Lynn Lippert, who lives in the condominium on Calle del
Comercio with her husband and two teenage daughters. "A big portion
of the trunk is in the bedroom." The tree caused serious damage to
the building, but no one was injured.</TE>
<TE>   In La Crescenta, a house was gutted after a downed power line
sparked a blaze.</TE>
<TE>   "We were very concerned for a while because of the erratic winds
and the potential of a larger fire," said Los Angeles County Fire
Inspector Edward Osario. But the home in the 3000 block of Gertrude
Avenue was unoccupied, and firefighters extinguished the blaze within
an hour.</TE>
<TE>   In Hancock Park, the wind uprooted a tree at 2:15 p.m. and tossed
it onto a pickup truck, taking power lines with it as it fell,
officials said. The driver wasn't injured.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time in Ontario, a gust of wind overturned a big rig,
which blocked traffic on Jarupa Street for nearly an hour. Another
big rig jackknifed on the southbound Orange Freeway in Fullerton.
Elsewhere in Orange County, several trees were toppled, blocking
roads.</TE>
<TE>   Weather officials said the winds were caused by interaction
between a high pressure area over the Great Basin in Nevada and a low
pressure area over the deserts of southeastern California.</TE>
<TE>   The gusts also sucked the moisture from the air, sending humidity
levels diving throughout the region. Officials said there was a 20%
chance of rain Friday.</TE>
<TE>   In Northern California, the wind stoked wildfires in the Sierra
Nevada at a time when many agencies had cut back on firefighters
because they thought the danger was past.</TE>
<TE>   Eldorado National Forest had laid off 60 seasonal firefighters and
was struggling to man its equipment to fight about 15 fires, the
largest at 1,000 acres, said spokesman Frank Mosbacher. In the Tahoe
National Forest, firefighters battled a number of blazes totaling
about 250 acres. In Calveras County, six separate areas were burning.</TE>
<TE>   "After seven to 10 inches of rain, we thought we had safe
conditions," said Tim Feller, company district manager of Sierra
Pacific Industries Inc.</TE>
<TE>   But winds as high as 70 mph ignited fires, including the
thousand-acre Plum Fire two miles south of Riverton, south of
California 50.</TE>
<TE>   "This stuff is just wicked," Feller said.</TE>

<HD>Coalition Goal Is Athletes' Rights</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. Adande</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the Collegiate Athletes Coalition announced its formation in
January 2001, I had no idea it would establish itself so quickly. As
for the chairman of this group of current and recently graduated
athletes, he had no idea the cause could be so ... cold.</LD>
<LD>   With the coalition nearing its second year of existence, about 30
members were in Columbus, Ohio, last weekend to hand informative
fliers to fans on their way in to the Michigan-Ohio State football
game.</LD>
<LD>   "It was freezing, man," said CAC chairman Ramogi Huma, a former
UCLA linebacker. "But I managed to hand out fliers" -- an estimated
70,000 of them. Listed were the group's concerns that health
insurance doesn't cover summer "voluntary" workouts, that athletes
can have their scholarships revoked when they are injured, and that
when players die -- as three college football players did last year
-- the NCAA's death benefit is often inadequate for the funeral
costs. In part, the flier said, "The players that you are watching
today are at risk."</LD>
<TE>   Most people stuffed the fliers in their pockets. Some stopped to
ask questions. A few had even heard of the group and were happy to
see members on campus.</TE>
<TE>   What recognition the group has came from a story on "60 Minutes"
in January and a trip to Capitol Hill to speak to Congress last
summer. Not bad for an organization that was just a concept 2 1/2
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "We're getting there," Huma said. "We're getting to somewhat of a
critical mass where we can pressure the NCAA."</TE>
<TE>   But the NCAA likes to operate its own agenda, in its own time.
Huma did have some correspondence with former NCAA president Cedric
Dempsey, but Dempsey canceled an arranged meeting at January's NCAA
convention. Huma sent a letter to the NCAA's management council,
Division I board of directors and President-elect Myles Brand in
October and hasn't heard back.</TE>
<TE>   When I called the NCAA on Monday to ask if anyone cared to respond
to the letter, a spokeswoman said it would require further research.</TE>
<TE>   With more than 1,000 member schools and a voluminous book of
regulations, the NCAA winds through a long, laborious process with
just about everything. Huma wonders just whom those rules and
regulations serve, because it doesn't seem to be the athletes
anymore.</TE>
<TE>   "There are inherent risks in sports," Huma said. "We're looking to
minimize those risks. That's what they [the NCAA] were founded on.
They're getting so far away from it."</TE>
<TE>   For Huma, the turning point came six years ago when his teammate,
Donnie Edwards, was suspended for accepting a bag of groceries from a
sports agent. Edwards claimed he didn't know the food was from an
agent.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to choose between not honoring NCAA rules or eating?"
Huma said. "We wanted to support Donnie, but what could we do? That
was the inspiration for the whole movement."</TE>
<TE>   It took a while to get going. When it started coming together in
the summer of 2000, Huma began sending e-mails to labor organizations
seeking help. One of them landed in the inbox of Tim Waters at the
United Steelworkers of America.</TE>
<TE>   He took it to his president, Leo Gerard. Then they ran it by the
lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to make sure that if we helped them that we stay within
the NCAA's guidelines," Waters said. "We wanted to make sure we
didn't put any players at risk.</TE>
<TE>   "This is something that we should be involved in. Health
insurance, fairness, death benefits are generally in the area of
things our organization fights for every day."</TE>
<TE>   Don't be fooled by the union's title. It isn't limited to
steelworkers -- or even Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "Under 15% of our membership is in the steelworkers," Waters said.
"We represent everything from nurses to all the workers at the
University of Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   "Our union is a mixture of a lot of other unions. People think of
big mills, but our biggest single employer today is Goodyear Tire and
Rubber."</TE>
<TE>   Technically, the CAC can't be a union because the athletes are not
university employees. There can be no arbitration or collective
bargaining.</TE>
<TE>   "This [the CAC] is one of the most interesting," Waters said. "But
the issues draw us closer to it. In our opinion, [the NCAA] is a
corporation -- they call themselves nonprofit -- that has a group of
people making billions of dollars, and they're not looking out for
the concerns and the best interests of the people generating all this
money. It smacks of unfairness by an employer."</TE>
<TE>   With the organizational and financial support of United
Steelworkers, the CAC has a foothold on 15 campuses, including every
school in the Pacific 10 Conference. One notable exception is the
football program at Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   When Huma and Ryan Roques, another former UCLA player, went to
meet with Coach John Mackovic, he quickly dismissed them and told
them he wasn't the guy they were looking for.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a stark contrast from the response we get from other
coaches," Huma said. "Most coaches want anything they can get for
their players."</TE>
<TE>   So he wasn't surprised a couple of weeks ago when more than 40
Arizona football players went to the school president to ask that
Mackovic be removed.</TE>
<TE>   "For half the team to come together, that means things must have
been really bad," Huma said.</TE>
<TE>   But Mackovic stayed. As is usually the case, the players' wishes
were not heard.</TE>
<TE>   That's why Huma and his organization keep at it. They feel they've
taken steps, such as the NCAA's willingness to consider lifting the
$2,000 limit on athletes' out-of-season work earnings.</TE>

<HD>It's Not Exactly a Tearful Reunion</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>For the first time since his infamous departure as coach of the
Dallas Cowboys in 1994, Jimmy Johnson sat down to talk with owner
Jerry Jones. The reason for the reunion was an interview for Fox
Sports, Johnson's current employer.</LD>
<LD>   "Jerry missed me so much that he actually offered me a contract
and I turned him down," Johnson cracked.</LD>
<LD>   The interview will be aired in two parts, the first on a special
edition of "Fox NFL Sunday" on Thanksgiving Day at 12:30 p.m. and the
second on the regular "Fox NFL Sunday" next weekend.</LD>
<TE>   Who fired whom? Johnson, in the interview, says, "I've heard you
say a couple of times that you fired me. If you did fire me, which I
didn't think you did, then don't you owe me three years on my
contract?"</TE>
<TE>   Jones replies, "Well, I thought we made a cash settlement.... The
real point is that you weren't fired and we both agreed that it just
wasn't going to work anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Happy days: When Johnson asks Jones what he liked and didn't like
about their relationship, Jones says, "Let me begin with that I know
I'm not right all the time. I also know that I wouldn't be sitting
here owning the Cowboys right now if it wasn't for our relationship,
which started over 30 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "What bothered me the most was that any time there were criticisms
by other staff members or the media, they were always misinterpreted
and blown out of proportion. I interpreted that as a chink in the
armor of the organization. But I don't want to tarnish things any
more because, honestly, those were the happiest days I've ever had in
my professional life."</TE>
<TE>   Another reunion, of sorts: On Thanksgiving Day, Phyllis George
will make her first appearance on an NFL pregame show since her days
as a regular on CBS' "The NFL Today."</TE>
<TE>   Only George will be on Fox.</TE>
<TE>   "Tune in, you'll never know what I'll say to [Terry] Bradshaw,"
George said.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who is the all-time leading scorer in college
basketball?</TE>
<TE>   Save it: When Fox Sports Net showed Mark Cuban celebrating after
his Dallas Mavericks had defeated the Lakers, Lisa Guerrero said,
"That's great, Mark, that you've won 11 straight games. But until you
win 11 straight games in June instead of November, maybe you should
save the celebration."</TE>
<TE>   Transparent: CBS' Dan Marino, explaining the codes the Miami
Dolphins had for calling audibles at the line of scrimmage, said, "If
it was 'blue,' that meant sky for pass. 'Green' meant ground for run
... "</TE>
<TE>   It seems opponents could have eventually figured that out.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Pete Maravich is all-time leading scorer in college
basketball with 3,667 points and a 44.6-point average in three
seasons at Louisiana State (1967-70).</TE>
<TE>   Finally: On last week's edition of HBO's "Inside the NFL,"
highlights from the San Francisco 49er-San Diego Charger game
included a shot of the 49ers' Terrell Owens scoring a touchdown,
planting the ball under his shoe and striking a celebratory pose.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly thereafter, a microphone picked up Owens saying, "I can't
stand myself."</TE>

<HD>Olympic Nod to Go to Brown</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Heisler</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Larry Brown, who won an NCAA title at Kansas and reached the NBA
Finals with Philadelphia, is expected to be named coach of the U.S.
men's basketball team for the 2004 Olympics today.</LD>
<LD>   USA Basketball, which runs the team, has called a news conference
in New York to announce its choice. However, word leaked after last
week's meeting of the senior committee that Brown had been selected.</LD>
<LD>   Brown has already announced that he'd be pleased to go, if
selected. Last week in Philadelphia, he called it "the greatest honor
going."</LD>
<TE>   Under Milwaukee Buck Coach George Karl at last summer's World
Championship, the U.S. lost for the first time since NBA players
started representing the country internationally in 1992, ultimately
dropping three games and finishing an inglorious sixth.</TE>
<TE>   That has prompted a cry for the league's best players to
participate. The Lakers' Kobe Bryant has already said he's interested
in playing for Brown.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, Shaquille O'Neal joked last week that if Phil
Jackson wasn't selected, he thought he might have a sore knee in
2004.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, Jackson, Miami's Pat Riley and Utah's Jerry Sloan were the
final candidates. Of the four, only Brown had international
experience.</TE>
<TE>   Brown has been taking U.S. teams abroad for more than 10 years.
Most recently, he coached the U.S. team in the 1999 Olympic
qualifying tournament in Puerto Rico, then served as Rudy
Tomjanovich's assistant at Sydney, Australia, in 2000 as the
Americans won the gold medal.</TE>
<TE>   Brown also won a gold medal as a player at the Tokyo Olympics in
1964.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike most NBA coaches, Brown has coached at the college level
too, at UCLA, where he reached the NCAA final in 1980, and at Kansas,
where he won an NCAA title in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   College coaches must learn how to contend with the zone defenses.
Pro coaches never did until last season, when the NBA lifted its ban
on zones.</TE>
<TE>   With the Americans' once-imposing talent differential narrowing,
the tactical ability of the coach becomes more important, especially
since many international teams also use zone defenses.</TE>

<KH>CLIPPER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Brand Believes His Formula</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Power forward Elton Brand made his first eight shots in Sunday's
victory over the Houston Rockets and had 17 points and six rebounds
in the first half. The Clippers held a 10-point lead, and all was
well at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   The Clippers lost the lead, but rallied late to win, 90-89.</LD>
<LD>   "We need to get the lead and keep going with what got us the
lead," Brand said.</LD>
<TE>   The Clippers haven't followed that game plan often enough, which
explains why they squandered leads of 17, 16 and 15 points during an
eight-day stretch that threatened to derail their prospects for a
successful season.</TE>
<TE>   The Rockets wiped out a 17-point Clipper lead before faltering at
the end Sunday. The Denver Nuggets erased a 16-point deficit Friday
and won at the buzzer, 72-70. The Seattle SuperSonics rallied from 15
points down Nov. 17 and won, 84-78.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still a young ballclub," Brand said. "We don't want to keep
using that as an excuse, but it's true."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Alvin Gentry continues to plead with his players to begin
the offense with a pass to either Brand or center Michael Olowokandi
down low. When the Clippers freelance on the perimeter, it's tough to
determine who gets more upset: Gentry, Brand or Olowokandi.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to find a way to get the ball to the post," Gentry
said. "We've got to get our perimeter guys thinking about getting the
ball in to the post."</TE>
<TE>   Twice in the last two games, the Clippers have gone to Olowokandi
with the game on the line and he has delivered with a hook shot. He
sank one that enabled the Clippers to tie the Nuggets, 70-70, late
Friday. He made another over 7-foot-5 center Yao Ming that got the
Clippers within 89-88 in the closing seconds Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Brand, who had a season-best 26 points against the Rockets, leads
the Clippers with an average of 16.6 points. Olowokandi is the team's
third-leading scorer with an average of 14.9 points. Brand and
Olowokandi are shooting 49.4% each, second-best behind guard Eric
Piatkowski's 50%.</TE>

<TE>   Site -- Staples Center.</TE>

<TE>   Records -- Clippers 5-9, Jazz 7-7.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Jazz (2001-02) -- 0-4.</TE>
<TE>   Update -- Utah has won four consecutive games, putting a temporary
halt to the conventional wisdom that says the best days of the Jazz
are behind the team. Utah also has won 14 in a row over the Clippers
and 18 of the last 20. The Clippers last beat the Jazz on March 27,
1999, at the Arrowhead Pond. Karl Malone leads the Jazz by averaging
19.2 points and seven rebounds in 34.2 minutes. John Stockton is
averaging 11.7 points and 7.1 assists in 26.9 minutes.</TE>

<LD>   What: "Real Sports With Bryant Gumbel"</LD>
<TE>   Where: HBO, tonight, 10</TE>
<TE>   Jeanie Buss is featured in the lead segment, which focuses on the
Laker executive vice president's 1995 Playboy spread, her
relationship with her boyfriend, Laker Coach Phil Jackson, and her
relationship with her father, Laker owner Jerry Buss.</TE>
<TE>   Reporter Armen Keteyian wastes little time getting to the point:
Could the owner fire the coach if he is dating the boss' daughter?</TE>
<TE>   Jeanie Buss says, "That would be understood. Someone asked me,
'What if your dad fired Phil?' I said I'd see Phil and say, 'Hey,
bummer at the office. Where are we going to dinner?' Our relationship
isn't about him being coach, it's about two adults being together."</TE>
<TE>   Photos from the Playboy spread are shown, including one of Jeanie
posing with basketballs covering her breasts. She says it was always
her dream to pose for Playboy and that she did should have nothing to
do with her business career.</TE>
<TE>   It's pointed out Jeanie was estranged from her father after her
parents divorced when she was 7. He came back into her life when she
was 17. They have been close ever since.</TE>
<TE>   Keteyian asks Jerry Buss if it's uncomfortable having his daughter
dating his coach.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see that has any bearing whatsoever. I read newspapers,
like everybody else, and I've seen comments like that. But what's the
big deal? I wouldn't hesitate at any time, if I felt it was the right
thing to do, to fire Phil."</TE>
<TE>   What if Jackson were to leave and go to Montana?</TE>
<TE>   "Well, the most important thing to me is my family and this
organization," she answers. "So if he said he was going to pack up
and move to Montana, I don't think I would follow him there."</TE>

<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the Lakers titled their season "The Quest for Four," they
couldn't know four wins -- in more than three weeks -- would be such
a test of endurance and perimeter shooting.</LD>
<LD>   Fortunately, they resisted the urge to rename it "The Quest for
Five," because that victory came only two nights later, and now,
starting a three-game trip through Miami, Orlando and Memphis,
they've won consecutive games for the second time this month.</LD>
<LD>   Shaquille O'Neal is back, they've won two in a row and their
offense doesn't have that Miami stink about it anymore, allowing them
a moment to examine what it is they've done to themselves.</LD>
<TE>   They are 5 1/2 games behind the Sacramento Kings in the Pacific
Division, 8 1/2 games behind the Dallas Mavericks in the Western
Conference, and no fewer than nine teams stand between them and Mark
Cuban's renowned international scouting department.</TE>
<TE>   About those standings ...</TE>
<TE>   "Don't look at the standings," Coach Phil Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   Well, then, you should know ...</TE>
<TE>   "Kind of know what they are," he said. "We've got a long haul. To
think realistically about it, it's going to take us a couple months
of playing really well to be back in the hunt, as far as I can see. I
don't see anything that's going to be a quick remedy.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll worry ourselves about that when we feel like we're starting
to play well enough to chase, to be a factor."</TE>
<TE>   There is another complication. The Lakers' nine early losses might
also cost them Jackson's deft touch in the regular season. In three
seasons in Los Angeles, Jackson has carried just the right amount of
November-to-March disregard to keep O'Neal, Kobe Bryant and his
veteran players healthy for the playoff grind.</TE>
<TE>   Therefore, it was the Lakers who won dynasty-shaping seventh games
against Portland and Sacramento, and the Lakers who lost a total of
three games in three NBA Finals. The unassuming Eastern Conference
helped too, but the Lakers consistently got to June on legs kept
fresh in December, January and February.</TE>
<TE>   This time, Jackson might have to drive them to get home-court
advantage in the first round.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not about looking down the schedule and knowing you're going
to be able to win 10 in a row sometime in January," Jackson said.
"You just play when you play and just see if we can't be consistent
about that."</TE>
<TE>   Typically, Jackson said, he strives for 85%-90% capacity during
the regular season. He might require more for the fourth title.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to reason with that a little bit too," he said. "We think
we have to play at a little higher level than we've had to play in
the past, perhaps.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a price to pay for that. If you burn yourselves out doing
that, chasing to be in position for the playoffs, it might cost you
something once you get there."</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>
<TE>   at Miami, 4:30 PST</TE>
<TE>   Channel 9 (5:30)</TE>
<TE>   Site -- American Airlines Arena.</TE>

<TE>   Records -- Lakers 5-9, Heat 2-10.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Heat (2001-02) -- 1-1.</TE>
<TE>   Update -- The Heat is averaging 81.1 points and apparently will
hang with New York and Cleveland at the bottom of the Eastern
Conference for at least another season. The Lakers have won their
last three games in Miami and are 9-5 there overall.</TE>

<LD>Breaking their silence about teammate Rollie Dykstra's injury, four
University of La Verne football players defended the school's care of
the senior quarterback and described him as a willing participant
before he suffered a serious head injury in a game last month.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not trying to bash Rollie, but when you strap on the pads and
helmet, you know there is danger involved. And he strapped on his
helmet," said Justin Wolfchief, a freshman running back who trailed
Dykstra on the option keeper that ended with Dykstra's injury in a
game Oct. 19 against visiting Redlands.</LD>
<LD>   Several La Verne players have grown frustrated, Wolfchief said,
with criticism of the school's handling of Dykstra's injury by
Dykstra's family and attorney Martin Cervantes. La Verne
administrators have cited federal law that prevents them from
discussing students, and the result has been a slanted interpretation
of actual events, according to Wolfchief and La Verne teammates Ray
Delgadillo, Phillip Faulding and Ernesto Rios.</LD>
<TE>   Among the issues they classify as misrepresented:</TE>
<TE>   * The contention that Dykstra was suffering severe headaches
during the week before the Redlands game. The players say Dykstra
disobeyed a trainer's request by attempting to practice while wearing
a helmet, an act they describe as his "psychological" and "symbolic"
display to teammates, coaches and trainers that he was in playing
condition.</TE>
<TE>   * The alleged statement by an unnamed player to Cervantes that, as
a result of head pain, Dykstra vomited and was "drenching" (sweating
profusely) less than two hours before the game. Wolfchief said he
overheard Dykstra tell a teammate he'd thrown up because he'd had
trouble swallowing some pills, and that his sweating was not
excessive.</TE>
<TE>   "I was taking handoffs from him, I would've noticed if [the
sweating] was bad," Wolfchief said. "It was a hot day."</TE>
<TE>   * Cervantes' description of the tackle that immediately preceded
Dykstra's sideline collapse as "garden variety," implying a previous
head injury had left Dykstra especially vulnerable to serious injury.</TE>
<TE>   "He got hit hard by two guys," Wolfchief said. "He got stuck
hard."</TE>
<TE>   La Verne Coach Don Morel, informed of the players' comments, said,
"I am confident that when all is said and done, it will be clear that
the coaches and trainers at the University of La Verne handled this
situation correctly."</TE>
<TE>   Dykstra, 24, who'd previously played at Division I-AA Florida A&amp;M,
returned to college, and the football field, after a nearly two-year
hiatus, emerging as Division III La Verne's starting quarterback.
According to Dykstra's father, Roland Sr., and his girlfriend,
Jennifer Ross, the player was experiencing severe headaches in the
weeks before the game against Redlands.</TE>
<TE>   Ross said Dykstra first expressed discomfort to her after he'd
been sacked eight times Oct. 5 in a loss to Claremont-Mudd-Scripps.
She said Dykstra reported his head was "throbbing" after a 30-6
defeat at Cal Lutheran on Oct. 12.</TE>
<TE>   Ross has said Dykstra told her La Verne trainer Jim May
discouraged him from seeking medical attention, citing expense as a
factor.</TE>
<TE>   Early in the second quarter against Redlands, Dykstra was tackled
on the option run and required assistance to reach the sideline. He
collapsed there, then suffered seizures, a locked jaw and labored
breathing that required a call for paramedics.</TE>
<TE>   Dykstra emerged from a coma two weeks ago. He is being treated at
Loma Linda University Center Rehabilitation Institute. Roland Dykstra
Sr. said his son can't stand on his own and can't control his left
side, but that he can speak sensibly and can feed himself with his
right hand. Dykstra could return home as early as January.</TE>
<TE>   Cervantes has said he expects to file a claim against La Verne in
Los Angeles County Superior Court for negligence regarding the
treatment of Dykstra before and after the injury.</TE>
<TE>   Cervantes acknowledges the central argument of his case is based
on why La Verne's staff, informed of Dykstra's headache, did not
arrange for him to receive in-depth medical examination or treatment
from a neurologist before clearing him to play.</TE>
<TE>   "I have become aware that Rollie was set for some [medical]
testing at a hospital, either an MRI or a CT scan; that it did not
take place [before the Redlands game] and he was told it was not
necessary," Cervantes said. "It looks like this is becoming their
side of the story versus our side of the story. There are speculative
gaps here. Our hope is that Rollie gets well and fills in those gaps.
This comes down to who really talked to Rollie about this, who
cleared him to play and why he did not have the test that would have
definitively cleared him or not."</TE>
<TE>   Rios, a fifth-year senior offensive lineman, said, "What they're
not taking into consideration is the mentality of [Dykstra]. He's a
battler, and what it comes down to is, if you're a football player,
you want to be out there on Saturdays. That's how I think too. I'd
rather deal with an injury than go to Jim [May]. If he thinks you're
hurt, he'll take you out."</TE>
<TE>   Delgadillo, a defensive lineman, said he was bothered by a leg
injury in the week before the Redlands game and was unable to
practice. While watching, Delgadillo said, he witnessed an exchange
when May noticed Dykstra wearing his helmet and pads:</TE>
<TE>   "May: 'What are you doing suiting up?'</TE>
<TE>   "Dykstra: 'I'm fine.'</TE>
<TE>   "May: 'You can throw the ball, but no contact, and no helmet.' "</TE>
<TE>   Said Delgadillo: "Jim May did exactly what he was supposed to do."</TE>
<TE>   Wolfchief said he also recalled that Dykstra pressed the issue by
wearing his helmet.</TE>
<TE>   "I specifically remember an assistant coach asking, 'They're
letting you wear your helmet out here?' and Rollie saying, 'No, I'm
just seeing how long they'll let me play,' " Wolfchief said. "That
was a player just wanting to play."</TE>
<TE>   One university administrator, after being told of the players'
comments, said, "These are the things I would love to tell you. This
is the stuff that enforces our side of the story. It's what we've
been forced to dance around."</TE>
<TE>   May would not comment about any subject regarding Dykstra.</TE>
<TE>   Delgadillo said May has paid keen attention to concussions and
head injuries. He said all La Verne players were checked for
concussions personally by May before the season, and he detailed his
own treatment after "dinging my head in the first week of practice.</TE>
<TE>   "He gave me a concussion test and wouldn't let me have any contact
or exercise, or even run, for a week and a half," Delgadillo said.
"He gave me the concussion test five times before clearing me."</TE>
<TE>   Delgadillo said he was not sent to a neurologist or any other
outside physician for the injury.</TE>
<TE>   The concussion test used at La Verne is ImPACT concussion
management software, a program also used in the NFL and an instrument
co-developer Dr. Michael Collins described as "a tool considered the
gold standard of care for managing concussions and the measurement of
neuropsychological function." Collins, of the University of
Pittsburgh, said a referral to a physician was proper protocol.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a panacea," Collins said of ImPACT. "Concussion is a
difficult injury to manage. There are still obvious unknowns, and
headache alone does not indicate a concussion. A trainer would look
for a whole cadre of other symptoms too -- loss of memory, dizziness,
fatigue, sleep problems, sensitivity to light or noise."</TE>
<TE>   La Verne's season is over -- the Leopards won their final two
games against Chapman and Occidental, finishing 3-6 -- but the
difficult questions linger on Dykstra's injury: What did he tell May?
How was his condition treated?</TE>
<TE>   A Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference trainer,
asked how headaches are typically handled, answered, "It depends,
case by case."</TE>
<TE>   "That's the problem with this," said another SCIAC trainer who
requested anonymity. "Of the two people who know those exact answers,
one is hospitalized and can't talk, and the other is being told not
to talk."</TE>
<TE>   Said Wolfchief: "We've said a prayer for Rollie every day since he
was hurt. I consider him a brother and I want him to be OK. But Jim
May has gone through a lot of [adversity] and he doesn't deserve to
be blamed."</TE>

<HD>Eagles Function Well on the Reserve System</HD>
<DH>With McNabb out, Detmer excels until he too is hurt, then
Feeley finishes off 38-17 rout of 49ers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas Bonk</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>So how do you figure the Philadelphia Eagles? A week ago, starting
quarterback Donovan McNabb broke his ankle and they won the game.
Then, on Monday night, backup quarterback Koy Detmer dislocated his
elbow and they won again.</LD>
<LD>   While it might seem as if they're one more quarterback injury away
from punching in Norm Snead on speed dial, the Eagles don't seem to
be affected very much by it, and even if they are, it wasn't in
evidence during a 38-17 blowout victory over the San Francisco 49ers
at 3Com Park.</LD>
<LD>   Detmer was wheeled off the field on a motorized cart in the third
quarter after he was injured when wrapped up by 49er defensive end
Chike Okeafor, who grabbed him below the knees. Detmer extended his
left arm as he tried to break his fall and writhed in pain
immediately after he hit the ground.</LD>
<TE>   Eagle players were on their knees on the sidelines waiting for
medical personnel to attend to Detmer, whose arm was placed in a soft
cast. When he climbed into the back of the cart without aid, players
from both teams went over to give him their good wishes.</TE>
<TE>   "My whole arm went numb," Detmer said. "I'm lucky something wasn't
broken. It was scary there for awhile."</TE>
<TE>   Detmer felt well enough to return to the field and watch from the
sideline in the fourth quarter. What he saw made him smile.</TE>
<TE>   McNabb to Detmer to A.J. Feeley, that's the Eagles' quarterback
lineage, and it's been good enough to keep them in the race for a
first-round bye and a home-field playoff game.</TE>
<TE>   Despite having thrown only 17 passes in his last three seasons,
Detmer, 29, completed 18 of 26 passes for 227 yards and two
touchdowns, ran for one and kept the Eagles rolling at 8-3. And
Feeley threw a touchdown pass after replacing him.</TE>
<TE>   Now, with five games left, the New York Giants at 6-5 are the only
remaining Eagle opponent with a winning record.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, that whooshing noise heard all around the stadium was
the air escaping from the 49ers' balloon</TE>
<TE>   "We have to go out tomorrow and forget about this," said
linebacker Derek Smith. "You have to have a short-term memory in this
league."</TE>
<TE>   Added quarterback Jeff Garcia, indentifying the turning point in
the game: "Opening snap. We just never got it done."</TE>
<TE>   Coming in with only one conference defeat and what appeared to be
a favorable schedule, the 49ers seemed ready to set sail into
December with a strong wind at their backs.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, they discovered the reality of NFL parity. But even after
losing two in a row, the 49ers are still 7-4 and will play three
currently 4-7 teams next month: Seattle, Dallas and Arizona. In fact,
the 49ers play only one more team with a winning record -- the Green
Bay Packers on Dec. 15.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia was leading comfortably, 28-10, when Okeafor tackled
Detmer after a 24-yard completion to Jeff Thomason to the 49er
one-yard line. Feeley, a second-year player from Oregon, threw a
one-yard scoring pass to tight end Chad Lewis and the rout was on.</TE>
<TE>   Not even a big night by Terrell Owens -- 13 receptions for 166
yards and two touchdowns -- could save San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   It got ugly at halftime, when the 49ers, trailing, 21-7, after
making only two first downs, ran off the field with a loud chorus of
boos ringing inside their helmets.</TE>
<TE>   The Eagles, running a McNabb-less offense, controlled the first
half with ease as Detmer threw a pair of touchdown passes in a
21-point second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The Eagles scored twice in just over three minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The first touchdown was a 25-yard pass to Todd Pinkston, who came
back to catch the underthrown, wobbly throw. Pinkston beat Jason
Webster to the ball, snagged it and plunged across the goal line.</TE>
<TE>   The second was a record setter. Brian Mitchell took Jason Baker's
line-drive 36-yard punt in a full sprint, made a right turn to the
sideline and ran untouched, 76 yards, for his 13th touchdown on
either a punt or a kickoff return. That broke the NFL record Mitchell
had shared with Eric Metcalf.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, trailing, 14-0, the 49ers were piling up more boos than
first downs, unsettling the crowd of 67,919.</TE>
<TE>   After a 33-yard kickoff return by Jimmy Williams, the 49ers did
something about it, driving 55 yards to get to within 14-7 on a
three-yard scoring pass from Garcia to Owens.</TE>
<TE>   The Eagles ran only three plays before punting and the 49ers
started fast on their next drive when Garcia completed a 19-yard pass
to Owens.</TE>
<TE>   But Fred Beasley dropped a pass, Kevin Barlow was thrown for a
three-yard loss and Garcia's pass to Tai Streets was incomplete.</TE>
<TE>   Detmer took the Eagles on an eight-play, 74-yard scoring drive,
scoring just before the half to make it a 14-point advantage again.
Antonio Freeman caught an 11-yard touchdown pass from Detmer, beating
Mike Rumph on an inside route.</TE>

<DH>Whether it's a miracle or just good coaching, Irish revival
has answered their fans' prayers</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Dufresne</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SOUTH BEND, Ind.</DL>
<LD>The players, dressed in suits and flanked by their coach, donning a
blue beret and dark wool coat, exit Mass at the Basilica of the
Sacred Heart at 12:15 on game day and make their ritual walk through
campus toward the stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Hundreds of fans line the sidewalk to get a glimpse of their
heroes, groups forming and reforming in sweeping lines ahead of the
pack.</LD>
<LD>   It is an autumn Saturday, cold and bright; the leaves have turned
and so has the tide.</LD>
<TE>   "They're just football players," a teenage girl says as her
green-clad father yanks her by the arm so as to stay ahead of the
procession.</TE>
<TE>   Not just players, dear.</TE>
<TE>   When the breaks are with the boys, as they have been this year,
the Notre Dame campus swells with joy.</TE>
<TE>   At the school's famous Grotto, men, women and children stand in
line to light candles, shuffling politely forward as if waiting for
someone to take their ticket.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't necessarily pray for an Irish win," said Bill Frazier,
who has traveled from Cincinnati. "I think that's selfish. I don't
think God would respond to something like that."</TE>
<TE>   Frazier, clad in a "Return to Glory" T-shirt pulled over a
sweatshirt, sat on a park bench and watched the multitudes pass by.</TE>
<TE>   "Isn't this great?" he said. "You know, if you were here last
year, it wasn't that crowded."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, what was that, other than a faded, far-away, unpleasant
memory?</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame travels west this week with a 10-1 record and renewed
national standing. The No. 7 Irish play No. 6 USC (9-2) at the
Coliseum on Saturday in a game that, at long last, can dare to match
the yellow-stained newspaper-clip history of this storied rivalry.</TE>
<TE>   Not since 1988's pairing of No. 1 Notre Dame vs. No. 2 USC at the
Coliseum has the game meant this much.</TE>
<TE>   The most remarkable part is how fast Notre Dame has completed
renovations after last year's 5-6 finish and how lucky they were --
yes, lucky -- in turning fiasco into fortune with the hiring of Coach
Tyrone Willingham.</TE>
<TE>   Only 11 months have passed since Notre Dame fired Bob Davie, hired
George O'Leary and accepted his resignation days later after it was
learned he falsified his resume. It was only last December that the
coaching search took almost comical turns as Athletic Director Kevin
White scoured the country in a private jet in search of someone --
anyone! -- willing to coach college football's most prestigious team.</TE>
<TE>   There have been far more highs than lows for the football program
with 11 national championships, but last December was the pits.</TE>
<TE>   "It really was," former Notre Dame and NFL great Paul Hornung
said. "Thank God we made the perfect choice afterward. We got a
do-over. If you don't succeed, try again."</TE>
<TE>   The key was doubling back and landing Willingham, finishing up his
seventh season at Stanford. He was on the early post-Davie short list
but ultimately was passed over for O'Leary.</TE>
<TE>   There were several factions, if not fissures, en route to
resolution.</TE>
<TE>   There was a Jon Gruden-for-coach camp, led by Hornung, and a Tom
Clements push by Joe Montana and friends.</TE>
<TE>   Allen Pinkett, a former running back who is now a radio analyst
for Notre Dame football, wanted Willingham from the start.</TE>
<TE>   White, his hand almost forced, ultimately turned to Willingham,
who would have been a perfectly fine choice in the first place. As it
played out, Notre Dame was seen in many quarters as backpedaling into
the socially conscious hiring of the school's first black head coach
in any sport.</TE>
<TE>   "It probably looked like this huge social statement that they
signed this black coach," Pinkett said. "But what Notre Dame did was
sign the best coach."</TE>
<TE>   The proof is in the product.</TE>
<TE>   Taking last year's 5-6 bunch, the taciturn Willingham turned Notre
Dame around, making his stoic face the new face of Irish football.</TE>
<TE>   Willingham would not talk your ear off, the way Lou Holtz would,
but has proven, in a Gary Cooper sort of way, that less can be more.</TE>
<TE>   For reporters, Willingham has made note-taking a breeze. He is a
human pause button. He ended the traditional Sunday morning news
conference and the school generally has made his players less
available. Willingham speaks in cryptic, measured tones, never
revealing too much.</TE>
<TE>   During last week's regular news conference in advance of the
Rutgers game, Willingham provided the following answers to questions.</TE>
<TE>   "No, no, there's no blame. No blame."</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, I did."</TE>
<TE>   "Won't say."</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah."</TE>
<TE>   "It is the best system we have."</TE>
<TE>   "Earlier in the year, yes."</TE>
<TE>   You've heard of the Navajo wind talkers?</TE>
<TE>   Irish receiver Omar Jenkins says players call this "Tyrone Code."</TE>
<TE>   "He may say three words to you all [the media] and I may know
there's a whole other paragraph to that," Jenkins joked.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever Willingham has done has worked, and Irish fans are back
on the bandwagon.</TE>
<TE>   "You can sense the difference," former Notre Dame coach Gerry
Faust said of the mood. "It's good that you have down years, because
it makes you realize what the good years really mean."</TE>
<TE>   Hornung, who says then-Oakland Raider coach Gruden would have been
the choice had the timing been better, has been won over completely
by Willingham, perhaps to the point of hyperbole.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, I was in Green Bay when [Vince] Lombardi arrived,"
Hornung said, "and there are similar circumstances when you look at
it."</TE>
<TE>   Most Notre Dame fans, however, compare Willingham's arrival to the
first days of Ara Parseghian, who inherited a 2-7 squad in 1963 from
Hugh Devore and finished 9-1 in 1964, the only blip a 20-17 defeat at
... USC.</TE>
<TE>   Irish fans only hope Willingham measures up to Parseghian, who
went 95-17-4 and won two national titles in 11 seasons.</TE>
<TE>   It has been Willingham's clockwork attention to detail that has
been most impressive, and his chain-of-command calm demeanor in times
of stress. The Irish hardly have been dominant this season, ranking
109 out of 117 schools in total offense before last Saturday's 42-0
rout of Rutgers.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, with the exception of a 14-7 home loss to Boston College on
Nov. 2, the Irish have been uncanny and opportunistic.</TE>
<TE>   They won their first two games, against Maryland and Purdue,
without scoring a touchdown on offense. They beat Michigan by two
points, with Shane Walton batting away the potential tying two-point
conversion with 2:53 left.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame's 21-17 win over Michigan State was borderline
miraculous, with backup quarterback Pat Dillingham and Arnaz Battle
hooking up on the game-winning, 60-yard pass-and-catch with 1:15
left.</TE>
<TE>   "I personally feel the key to the season was the Michigan State
game," Faust said. "After they came back that way, they really
believed they were a destiny team."</TE>
<TE>   The next week, Notre Dame trailed Stanford, 7-3, late in the third
quarter before scoring four touchdowns in a span of 6:54.</TE>
<TE>   The Irish gave up 402 yards against Pittsburgh but gutted out an
ugly, error-plagued 14-6 win. Their defense was "The Magnificent 11"
against Air Force, holding the nation's leading ground attack to 104
yards in a 21-14 win.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen better defense at Notre Dame in all my years that
I've followed ND," Faust said. "It's outstanding. It's ferocious.
It's God's will, maybe, but it's the way they're hitting too."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, there's no telling how this would have played out under
a Notre Dame coach named O'Leary, no way of knowing what he would
have done with the same players against the same schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Pinkett doesn't think Irish players were suited to O'Leary's
style.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to say whether O'Leary would have been a step up from
Bob Davie," Pinkett said.</TE>
<TE>   Ah, Bob Davie, the forgotten man.</TE>
<TE>   But where does he fit into all this?</TE>
<TE>   He took his firing with class and has moved on to become an
excellent analyst for ESPN.</TE>
<TE>   Here is his breakdown on his former team:</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of obvious what it is," Davie said. "If you look at it
from the standpoint [of] an analyst, Ty Willingham is probably the
coach of the year. I think everyone would be chasing him."</TE>
<TE>   Part of Davie, though, wonders what he might have done had he been
allowed to coach this year's team. He was criticized on many fronts
in his five years in South Bend, yet the key players on this year's
10-1 team were recruited and coached by him.</TE>
<TE>   "We were a 9-2 team the year before [9-3 actually after the 2001
Fiesta Bowl loss to Oregon State], a good defensive team last year
and a really good special teams football team last year," Davie said.
"They've kind of continued to win with the plan we kind of put in
place, playing great defense and special teams.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm proud of the job I did. I'm proud of the foundation I left,
but in no way would I minimize what Tyrone has done coming in and
getting them over the hump."</TE>
<TE>   It's not easy to explain how Willingham took the same players and
won the close games Davie always seemed to lose.</TE>
<TE>   One explanation is that players often take on the characteristics
of their coach, and Willingham's demeanor clearly has rubbed off on
the Irish in tense moments.</TE>
<TE>   Willingham has been able to connect with his players in a way
Davie could not.</TE>
<TE>   Pinkett recalls almost having to bite his tongue last year during
radio broadcasts of Irish games.</TE>
<TE>   "I could see the talent down there," Pinkett said. "On a 5-6 team,
we put eight players on NFL rosters. I knew it was there; fortunately
we have Coach Willingham now."</TE>
<TE>   Willingham was an outsider, but quickly engrossed himself in all
things Irish.</TE>
<TE>   Not long after he arrived, he held informal chat sessions in
dormitories. Hornung swears Willingham has met every student on
campus.</TE>
<TE>   Willingham knew becoming Irish coach was more than knowing the Xs
and O's.</TE>
<TE>   "I probably say I'm still learning, and probably will be
continuing the learning process for some time," Willingham said last
week, "because I think there's a great deal to this university that
is not superficial. So therefore, you've got to dig a lot deeper to
find out all of the meanings, all of the traditions and how
everything fits together."</TE>
<TE>   Funny how it all worked out, and how fast.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame went from O'Leary to Whoa, Nellie.</TE>
<TE>   From the play on the field to the way the midday sun hits the
Golden Dome on crisp fall afternoons, this season has been almost
picture perfect.</TE>
<TE>   "To tell you the truth," Pinkett said, "as a fan and a former
player, they're really fulfilling our expectations. This is really
what we expected, even last year."</TE>

<HD>Lost on the Air: the Write Stuff</HD>
<DH>In the desire to be seen and heard, loudly, sports
reporters are getting more exposure -- at the cost of credibility</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Penner</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Outlined against a blue-gray television screen, the four hoarse men
of the Apocalypse are embarrassing themselves and their profession
again.</LD>
<LD>   They are shouting at each other. They are shouting at the
smirking, obnoxious host who shouts back at them. They are shouting
at you. They are shouting at me.</LD>
<LD>   They are sportswriters by trade, and sportswriters had been
behaving this way in press boxes long before Grantland Rice changed
his first typewriter ribbon. They shout about the stupid opinion the
guy sitting two seats down just shouted. They shout about the poor
quality of the free food as they circle back for seconds. They shout
about the idiot editor on the other end of the phone who doesn't
understand how hard it is to write with all this shouting going on.</LD>
<TE>   It wasn't something sportswriters were particularly proud of or
willing to confess in mixed company. It isn't something the newspaper
reader really needs to know while plowing through that morning's
account of how the home team blew another close one.</TE>
<TE>   But now it is on the air, all over the place, because after
decades of healthy mistrust and mutual contempt, television and
sportswriters have hit on a remarkable discovery: Those other guys
are just as shameless and pathetic and desperate as we are -- and we
know exactly how to exploit them.</TE>
<TE>   The networks are desperate for midday programming that can
compete, ratings-wise, with the whirring vacuum cleaner in the other
room. They're looking for something loud and cheap and fast and
mindless. In this environment, if you can get a roomful of frat boys
to stop pirating music off the Internet for half an hour between
classes, you have the makings of an afternoon "hit."</TE>
<TE>   Sportswriters who appear on these shows are desperate for money
and attention, always that combination, always in that order. Some
get pushed in front of the camera by editors who believe that trading
in the quality, credibility and reputation of their newspapers for a
little cheap TV publicity is a good deal.</TE>
<TE>   Periodically, sports editors from across the country will meet and
discuss why sports sections are not as good as they once were. All
they need to do is tune into ESPN's daily doubleheader, "Around the
Horn" followed by "Pardon the Interruption," and they will have their
answer.</TE>
<TE>   "Around the Horn" exists -- I can only guess here -- because ESPN
couldn't figure out a way to fit all its cameras inside a dentist's
office and properly mike the drill. It is 30 minutes</TE>
<TE>   of hell, orchestrated by a blathering self-important loudmouth
named Max Kellerman, who also covers boxing for the</TE>
<TE>   network and got this gig, presumably, because he has experience in
talking over a bloody carnage.</TE>
<TE>   Four sports columnists from newspapers from various time zones are
rounded up via split screen, from their respective newsrooms, with
their respective newspaper logos visible behind them, and, goaded on
by Kellerman, are encouraged to act like morons.</TE>
<TE>   Jay Mariotti of the Chicago Sun-Times, Woody Paige of the Denver
Post, Bob Ryan of the Boston Globe, Tim Cowlishaw of the Dallas
Morning News, and T.J. Simers and J.A. Adande of the Los Angeles
Times are the primary columnists in the show's rotation.</TE>
<TE>   The format is pseudo-game show: Kellerman throws out a topic and
the columnists are given a few moments to shout what they think about
it. Or that's what they'd like you to think. The object of the
"competition" is not to see if anyone has anything intelligent or
thought-provoking to say, because that takes too long -- any opinion
that takes longer than 30 seconds to make has no place on this show.
No, columnists earn or lose points strictly on the basis of whether
Kellerman agrees with their take.</TE>
<TE>   (Sample question: "Who is your favorite old-guy athlete? And there
is a right answer.")</TE>
<TE>   The premise is absurd, of course. And that's precisely the point.
It's merely a device to get the ball rolling and the writers
shouting, so Kellerman can insult them and take points away from them
-- points that translate into seconds of air time to be used later
for more shouting. Just what we need.</TE>
<TE>   And if the writers don't shout loudly enough, or don't shout over
each other often enough, or don't interrupt each other at the right
time, they stop taping and do another take so they eventually can
splice together a seamless 30-minute blast of headache-inducing
inanity.</TE>
<TE>   The show's only redeeming feature: the mute button Kellerman
pushes to silence a columnist for 10 seconds. Unfortunately,
Kellerman is not nearly as trigger-happy as he needs to be.
Fortunately, home viewers can compensate.</TE>
<TE>   The other day, I directed the perfect "Around the Horn" from my
sofa. I hit the mute button on my remote control when the show
started and kept it there until it ended.</TE>
<TE>   "Pardon the Interruption" lumbers on right after "Around the
Horn," and, by comparison, it is the Algonquin Round Table. It
features Washington Post sports columnists Tony Kornheiser and
Michael Wilbon doing the same thing they've done inside the Post
newsroom for years -- only now, after streamlining it for television,
they're getting paid for it.</TE>
<TE>   It also features a regular segment in which the sparring hosts
take time out to interview a sports figure or commentator, apparently
so they can catch their breath. The segment is called "Five Good
Minutes," or six more than you'll find on "Around the Horn."</TE>
<TE>   Sportswriters-on-TV has seldom been a good idea. One exception:
Mike Lupica's hysterical fits on "The Sports Reporters," which
performed the useful service of scaring scores of journalism students
into switching their majors and thereby thinning the prospective
sportswriting talent pool. The job market is overcrowded as it is.</TE>
<TE>   Sportswriters belong in front of a keyboard, not in pancake
makeup. Newspapers have changed considerably since the advent of
cable television and the rise of talk radio, but their fundamental
game plan has not -- and that's to give the people something
television and radio cannot.</TE>
<TE>   Television and radio deal in headlines and sound bites. Newspapers
and their sports sections have the time and space to work beneath the
surface, to look behind the scenes, to report and comment and analyze
in greater depth and detail.</TE>
<TE>   Somewhere along the line, the mission has become blurred, if not
lost altogether. Shoved along by media mergers and "synergy" charts,
the old adversarial relationship has given way to a proliferation of
multimedia jacks-of-all-trades -- newspaper columnists with TV or
radio gigs -- always at the expense of the newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   How many feature stories and columns would be better written and
more thoughtfully executed if the writer weren't splitting his or her
workday pulling long stints in the studio or in rehearsal?</TE>
<TE>   A conservative guess?</TE>
<TE>   All of them.</TE>
<TE>   Shows such as "Around the Horn" chip away further by luring the
columnist and his newspaper in because of their reputations, then
degrading those reputations with a format that casts them as clowns.</TE>
<TE>   Nostalgia is hot right now in sports, so maybe sportswriting still
has a chance. Classic uniforms. Classic stadiums. If we wait long
enough, armed in the dark with our remote controls and our mute
buttons, maybe everyone will eventually regain their senses and
remember what classic sportswriting once was all about.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Murray and Red Smith never had their own television shows.</TE>

<LD>Like you, I wish only the best for USC.</LD>
<LD>   That is why I'd like to remind excited fans Saturday night in the
Coliseum, many of whom will probably be running on the field to
celebrate and some going so far as to make a move on the goal posts
after Notre Dame has won, to act as if you've been in the end zone
before celebrating an Irish victory, and to behave appropriately.</LD>
<LD>   I would also caution Trojan fans that appropriate behavior does
not include stringing up a sportswriter to the goal post left
standing just because he chooses to remain objective at all times.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THERE IS something ugly happening in college sports, and I'm not
referring to the Trojan fan who is rushing right now to his computer
to angrily demand in the most misspelled obscene language imaginable
that a particularly handsome sportswriter be fired or harmed for even
joking Notre Dame might beat USC.</TE>
<TE>   All hell is breaking loose on the field, but in most cases after
the game is over: At Clemson a 67-year-old sheriff's deputy was run
over by fans rushing the field Saturday; three fans were injured and
police used pepper spray on others at a North Carolina State game;
Ohio State fans threw chunks of sod at the police, who responded with
pepper spray; fans bombarded visiting players at Washington State
with thrown bottles; scores of fans were led off in handcuffs after
rushing the field at Cal. At Cal!!!</TE>
<TE>   We're getting to the point where we won't only be recapping the
scoring in a big game, but the number of casualties and arrests that
follow.</TE>
<TE>   Hawaii and Cincinnati met in the middle of the field after
Saturday's game, but instead of shaking hands, a brawl broke out.
Hawaii and Cincinnati!!!</TE>
<TE>   Add up the arrests and injuries -- and whether it's just a number
of disasters falling all over themselves on one college weekend to
make it seem worse than what it really is, or something larger like a
societal ill speaking to more complicated frustrations among people
needing an outlet -- we're not far away from someone dying because
they went to a game over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "We have parents complaining and wanting to know why our security
guards are chasing their kids and tackling them on the field, and I'd
like to ask those parents: 'Why are your kids drunk and running
around crazy on the field?' " said Pat Lynch, general manager of the
Coliseum. "People have died because of falling goal posts, and our
mission is not to have anyone get hurt.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very dangerous situation when people charge the field.
It's not anybody's right to enter the field. It's our right to
protect the field. When you have people coming down on the field you
won't believe the sexual harassment that takes place, especially when
the band is also on the field. Some kids think that it's cool to
grope and molest female band members."</TE>
<TE>   A year ago a large number of fans ran onto the Coliseum field
after USC had defeated UCLA and made a move on the goalposts.
Coliseum security and Los Angeles police officers, however,
surrounded the goal posts at each end of the field, leaving the fans
to run around like fools.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll try to get the message out not to come on the field," Lynch
said.</TE>
<TE>   "But if it happens, we'll be prepared to protect the goalposts and
maintain public safety."</TE>
<TE>   Given an ugly e-mail taste of just how angry and mean Trojan fans
can get when teased or spurned by someone who couldn't care less who
wins or loses, I'm not surprised public safety is an issue at
sporting events, just bothered by the prospect of watching someone
carried off on a stretcher because they thought it would be fun to go
to a game. Or because they write about sports in the newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE NEW York Times took an editorial position on whether a rich
woman is entitled to admittance to a private golf club somewhere in
Georgia by calling on Tiger Woods to boycott the Masters.</TE>
<TE>   Since the Los Angeles Times seems concerned only about
editorializing on "Argentine Children's Plight" and other worldly
things like "North Korea's Foolish Gamble," I would call on Mr. Woods
to get married, contending that his wife then would be the first
woman to gain admittance to the Augusta National Golf Club, thereby
ending this controversy.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DETROIT FREE Press sports columnist Drew Sharp on Coach Marty
Mornhinweg's decision not to take the ball after winning the coin
flip in overtime: "This is a team devoid of talent and smarts. And
they've become the spitting image of their coach."</TE>
<TE>   Although Mornhinweg is expected to be replaced at season's end,
this is probably not a good time to bring up Bob Toledo's name.</TE>
<TE>   For much of this season I gave him high marks for surviving
without Cory Paus at quarterback, but his decision to insert freshman
Matt Moore into the USC game right after Drew Olson had led the
Bruins down the field to score was Mornhinweg-ish. And his
explanation was just as ridiculous, suggesting he was only following
the plan he had set for the game, which should have been tossed away
as soon as UCLA fell behind 21-0.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WASHINGTON STATE quarterback Jason Gesser, while walking on
crutches after spraining an ankle, said he will be in the Rose Bowl
on Dec. 7 to play UCLA. We're still awaiting word to see if the
Bruins will show up.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in an e-mail from Chace808:</TE>
<TE>   "Why are you such a SC hater? Does your editor finally realize
that everyone hates you ... ? You will be fired soon. Trust me, the
writing is on the wall."</TE>
<TE>   That's news to me, but don't fret; maybe we just haven't used the
same stall.</TE>

<HD>No. 1 Miami Widens Margin in BCS</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ohio State may be headed for the BCS national title game in the
Fiesta Bowl, but Miami still sits atop the bowl championship series
rankings and USC still waits for its opportunity, moving up two
places to No. 6.</LD>
<LD>   The defending national champion Hurricanes increased their lead
over the Buckeyes from 0.01 of a point last week, when they moved
ahead of Ohio State, to 1.32 points Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Miami, ranked No. 1 in the Associated Press media and coaches'
polls, has 2.89 points, 0.80 points better than last week's total.
Ohio State has 4.21 points, with Oklahoma moving up to third with
9.09 points.</LD>
<TE>   The Buckeyes (13-0) completed their regular season with a 14-9
victory over Michigan on Saturday. As one of only two unbeaten teams
remaining -- Miami (10-0) is the other -- Ohio State assured itself
of at least a second-place finish when the final BCS standings are
released Dec. 8.</TE>
<TE>   The top two teams in the final rankings head to Tempe, Ariz., for
the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 3.</TE>
<TE>   If the Hurricanes win their final games against Syracuse (4-7) on
Saturday and Virginia Tech (8-3) on Dec. 7, they will play the
Buckeyes for the national championship.</TE>
<TE>   If Miami loses, Oklahoma (10-1) stands the best chance of the
one-loss teams to move into the title game. The Sooners, who beat
Texas Tech, 60-15, benefited most by Washington State's 29-26 triple
overtime loss to Washington. The Cougars tumbled to eighth in the
latest BCS rankings.</TE>
<TE>   While the Sooners are next in line to move up, other teams looking
for help are No. 4 Georgia (10.07), No. 5 Iowa (12.43), No. 6 USC
(13.37) and No. 7 Notre Dame (13.83).</TE>
<TE>   The Fighting Irish (10-1) are guaranteed a spot in a BCS bowl if
they finish in the top six of the final BCS standings. The Trojans
(9-2) play Notre Dame on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio State's margin behind Miami widened primarily because of
Washington State's loss. The Buckeyes received only a 0.3 bonus-point
deduction for an earlier victory over the Cougars. Last week, the
deduction was 0.8.</TE>

<HD>Texas A&amp;M Freshman Dies After Collapsing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>COLLEGE STATION, Texas</DL>
<LD>A Texas A&amp;M freshman football player died Monday morning after
complaining to his roommate he was having trouble breathing.</LD>
<LD>   Brandon Fails, 18, died at St. Joseph Regional Health Center,
school officials said. An autopsy will be performed to determine the
cause of death.</LD>
<LD>   The 6-foot-1, 307-pound defensive lineman appeared in four games
for the Aggies before undergoing knee surgery on Oct. 22.</LD>
<TE>   "Brandon was a bright-eyed young man with an engaging
personality," Texas A&amp;M Coach R.C. Slocum said. "You couldn't be
around Brandon for very long without smiling. He was an outstanding
football player but an even better person."</TE>
<TE>   Slocum said Fails' roommate, tight end Patrick Fleming, told him
Fails collapsed as they prepared to leave their room for breakfast in
the dorm cafeteria.</TE>
<TE>   Fleming told Slocum he and Fails went out to dinner with a friend
Sunday evening without any problems.</TE>
<TE>   The team did not practice Monday, but Slocum said it would resume
workouts today to prepare for Friday's regular-season finale against
Texas at Austin. There were no plans to postpone the game.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think Brandon or his family would want that," Slocum
said.</TE>

<HD>Florida State Dismisses McPherson From Team</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Florida State quarterback Adrian McPherson was dismissed from the
team Monday amid reports that police planned to question him in the
theft and forgery of a blank check.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Bobby Bowden would not give details of the violation, but
said McPherson would remain in school and on scholarship through the
end of the semester.</LD>
<LD>   "That's about all I can say," Bowden said. "This is kind of new to
me too."</LD>
<TE>   Bowden called his decision to dismiss McPherson "clear cut."</TE>
<TE>   At the end of Monday's news conference, sports information
director Rob Wilson said the investigation did not involve gambling
or point shaving.</TE>
<TE>   No one has been charged in the check forgery, and police would
have no further comment until criminal charges are filed, the
Tallahassee Police Department said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Rix, whom McPherson replaced in late October, will start
against Florida on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Utah fired Coach Ron McBride two days after the Utes finished with
their second losing record in three seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that as we looked at our program over the last three
years that we have not reached the goals that we've needed to," said
Athletic Director Chris Hill, who told McBride of his decision during
a meeting Monday.</TE>
<TE>   McBride coached Utah for 13 seasons and took the Utes to six of
their nine bowl appearances. Even though the Utes won their last
three games, including Saturday's 13-6 victory over Brigham Young,
they finished 5-6.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Verle Sorgen, the Pacific 10 Conference's coordinator of
officials, will review replays today of the final play of
Washington's 29-26 triple-overtime victory over Washington State, a
call Cougar Coach Mike Price labeled "an unforgivable mistake."</TE>
<TE>   Acting on a decision made by line judge Roger McMinn, crew chief
Gordon Riese stunned a Saturday night crowd of 37,600 at Washington
State's Martin Stadium when he announced Cougar backup quarterback
Matt Kegel was attempting a backward pass when Washington defensive
lineman Kai Ellis tipped the ball.</TE>
<TE>   After another official signaled an incomplete pass on the
first-down play, Riese's crew gathered and ruled unranked Washington
had recovered a live ball and won the Apple Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Sorgen's interpretation of the call won't affect the game's
outcome. If it's determined the crew made the wrong ruling, their
performance will be downgraded. Crews with the best grades are
awarded bowl games.</TE>

<TE>   Taver Johnson, a Miami of Ohio assistant coach who damaged a
visiting coaches' box after a loss at Marshall, was barred from
off-season recruiting. Johnson also must pay for the damage to the
coaches' box, forego any pay raise next year and attend anger
management counseling at his own expense, the university said....
Nebraska kicker Josh Brown has been arrested on suspicion of driving
under the influence.... No. 19 Boise State (11-1) has accepted an
invitation to play in the Humanitarian Bowl, which will be played on
its home field Dec. 31.... Michigan State receiver Charles Rogers

<HD>Center Shows His Nasty Side</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There is a little more oomph to center Marc Chouinard's game this
season.</LD>
<LD>   Chouinard has exceptional skill in the faceoff circle and as a
penalty killer. He even has the offensive savvy to chip in a goal
here and there while centering the Ducks' fourth line.</LD>
<LD>   The one area where he had been lacking was nastiness. But there
has been a noticeable change in his willingness to throw around his
lanky, 6-foot-5, 218-pound frame this season.</LD>
<TE>   "He's more physical and we want him to be a lot more physical,"
Coach Mike Babcock said. "On a journey of 10 miles, we think he's on
Lap 2.... It's not how big you are, it's how big you play."</TE>
<TE>   Chouinard, who usually is squeezed between Kevin Sawyer and Dan
Bylsma on the fourth line, established himself last season as a
reliable NHL center. He looked to improve on that this season.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously when you're in the role I'm in, you have to hit,"
Chouinard said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of physical, Sawyer, the Duck enforcer, again showed his
canny ability to draw a penalty Sunday. Sawyer duped Florida's Peter
Worrell into an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty in the second period.</TE>
<TE>   "Emotions were running high and there were a couple big hits that
shift," Sawyer said. "I kind of knew [Worrell] might be a little
sensitive. I got in his face, he got in mine. Out of the corner of my
eye I saw him drop him gloves. I kept my feet moving and drew the
penalty."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Center Adam Oates was medically cleared to play. He has been out
since Oct. 24 with a broken left hand.</TE>

<LD>Jesse Gonzales, superintendent of Compton Unified School District,
confirmed Monday night that former Dominguez High boys' basketball
coach Russell Otis, replaced in a storm of controversy less than two
years ago, has emerged as the leading candidate to reclaim his old
position.</LD>
<LD>   Gonzales, speaking after a school board meeting, said Otis, who
guided the Dons to seven Southern Section championships and four
state titles in 13 seasons, could be approved at the board's next
meeting, Dec. 10.</LD>
<LD>   Dominguez finished the 1999-2000 season ranked No. 1 in the
nation, but in November 2000 Otis was arrested for allegedly sexually
molesting a former player.</LD>
<TE>   Otis vigorously denied the charges and a jury acquitted him. But
the school district fired him in February 2001, citing his failure to
obtain a permanent teaching credential.</TE>
<TE>   Dominguez would be hiring him as a walk-on coach without teaching
responsibilities.</TE>
<TE>   The player who criminally accused Otis has leveled similar civil
charges in Compton Superior Court, seeking unspecified compensatory
and punitive damages. The Compton district has also been named as a
defendant in the case, accused of negligence. A jury trial is
scheduled to begin in early February.</TE>
<TE>   Conrad Kohrs, the attorney defending Otis in the civil litigation,
said he has brought a cross-complaint against the plaintiff and his
family members for "deliberately, intentionally and maliciously lying
not only during the investigation but under oath during the criminal
trial."</TE>
<TE>   Dominguez will open its season Monday without a permanent coach.
Former Don player Joey Aubrey and his father, Horace, have served as
interim coaches since practice started this week.</TE>
<TE>   "I told [Dominguez Principal Kelcey] Richardson that he needed to
start thinking in terms of what he is going to do, that he needed to
make some arrangements to have somebody in place," Gonzales said.</TE>
<TE>   Joey Aubrey has said he supports Otis' return as coach.</TE>

<TE>   At least 14 schools that competed in the Southern Section football
playoffs last weekend violated an edict requiring them to use
Spalding footballs and face sanctions, according to section spokesman
Thom Simmons.</TE>
<TE>   Game officials were asked to file incident reports on those
schools that did not use Spalding footballs. The section had received
14 reports as of Monday afternoon. Spalding is paying the Southern
Section $75,000 a year in sponsorship money for five years.</TE>
<TE>   Officials were told to inform coaches before each playoff game of
the ball requirement.</TE>
<TE>   Simmons said Commissioner Jim Staunton has not decided on the
punishment for schools ignoring the rule or when the punishment would
be enforced. The section warned this month that those schools could
face a financial penalty or loss of future playoff home dates.</TE>

<HD>Despite His Size, Cole Gives Foes Devil of a Time</HD>

<LD>Chris Cole of Mission Viejo High creates the havoc of a giant on the
football field even though he's not much bigger than a running back.</LD>
<LD>   He's a 5-foot-10, 225-pound senior defensive tackle who makes
290-pound offensive linemen look helpless when they try to block him.</LD>
<LD>   "You play against him or watch him on film and you come away
knowing who's the best football player on the field," Coach Bob
Johnson said.</LD>
<TE>   It's the Humpty Dumpty syndrome when facing Cole: The bigger the
blocker, the harder he falls.</TE>
<TE>   Cole uses speed, power and instincts to sack quarterbacks, disrupt
rushing attacks and cause chaos. It's no wonder Mission Viejo has won
25 consecutive games over the last two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "I've coached 32 years of defensive linemen, and this is the
finest I've seen, let alone coached," defensive coordinator Marty
Spalding said. "He's so fast and a tremendous athlete. He's a clinic
on film. You just want to watch him and use his play as a teaching
tool."</TE>
<TE>   Cole had 15 sacks last season. He has nine sacks and 16 tackles
for losses this season. He bench-presses 325 pounds, runs 40 yards in
4.7 seconds and never gives up on a play.</TE>
<TE>   "I always play like it's my last game," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it's his Samoan heritage that gives Cole a toughness that's
hard to duplicate.</TE>
<TE>   He was born in New Zealand and moved to Orange County when he was
11. Rugby was the sport he knew best until he tried out for football
as a freshman.</TE>
<TE>   "They just put me out there and told me to hit," he said.</TE>
<TE>   His strategy is simple.</TE>
<TE>   "The ball is snapped, you explode with quickness and get into the
backfield," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Double teams don't bother him.</TE>
<TE>   "It just leaves another person open, so that's good for the team,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Size is supposed to be crucial for linemen, but Cole has
discovered other ways to complete his tasks.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't really care how big they are," he said of offensive
linemen. "Some guys smaller are much better. It's good I'm short. I
get leverage and don't get popped when they're coming at me. I like
it when they're big."</TE>
<TE>   Mission Viejo (11-0) is seeded No. 1 in Southern Section Division
II and plays at Canyon Country Canyon (10-1) Friday in a quarterfinal
game. To beat the Diablos, some team is going to have to figure out
how to neutralize Cole.</TE>
<TE>   "He's running at full speed constantly, so the only way to
effectively block him is two on one," Spalding said.</TE>
<TE>   But that only frees up defensive end Justin Williams or others to
make tackles.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Jefferson finished 1-8 last season, but the Democrats
(6-5) have made it to the City Championship quarterfinals under
first-year Coach Doi Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   A big reason is the Big Three -- receiver Gary White and offensive
tackles Clifton Stanford (6-3, 280 pounds) and Whitfield Usher (6-3,
315). All three are future college players. Usher scored 1,240 on the
SAT and rarely gives up sacks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   How much time should be devoted to sports practices at the expense
of academics is always open for debate.</TE>
<TE>   North Hollywood Harvard-Westlake is on the verge of approving a
schoolwide policy that would limit its sports teams to two hours of
practice on weekdays and three hours on Saturdays.</TE>
<TE>   Numerous coaches across the Southland wouldn't be able to coach at
Harvard-Westlake under the new policy, because they conduct practices
that last three hours or longer in such sports as football,
basketball, water polo, swimming and baseball.</TE>
<TE>   The school newspaper, the Chronicle, criticized the proposal in an
editorial: "We cannot expect excellence from our teams if we restrict
practice hours to less than that of the competition."</TE>
<TE>   The Chronicle asked, "If we limit the number of hours a team can
practice to two, then shouldn't we also limit the number of hours of

<BD>From Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was quite an ending -- to a match, a season and a coaching career.</LD>
<LD>   No. 1 singles player Kristen McVitty and the No. 1 doubles team of
Celia Durkin and Helen Kolpakov won crucial third-round sets for the
Calabasas High girls' tennis team, which upset top-seeded and
previously unbeaten Beverly Hills on games, 69-65, after the teams
tied, 9-9, in sets in the Southern Section Division I championship
match Monday at the Claremont Club in Claremont.</LD>
<LD>   The victory sent veteran Calabasas Coach Bill Bellatty out a
winner. With his 14th season at the Coyotes' helm concluded,
Bellatty, 61, announced his retirement after the match. Calabasas
last won a title in 1999 in Division IV.</LD>
<TE>   "What a way to go out," he said. "It's just so much fun. It's just
so great for the girls. I've still got all the team pictures from
over the years, and I can name them all."</TE>
<TE>   Bellatty's last victory was certainly memorable and avenged a 10-8
loss to the Normans in Calabasas' second match of the season.</TE>
<TE>   The second-seeded Coyotes (22-2) weren't assured of the victory on
games until Durkin and Kolpakov defeated the No. 3 team of Vivian
Yoon and Jade Sherman, 6-1, to pull Calabasas into an 8-8 tie and
then McVitty defeated No. 3 singles player, Irina Shef, 6-2, in the
second-to-last set to be completed.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew it was going to be close, that every game was going to
matter," McVitty said. "It was exciting. I just tried to focus on my
match and do the best I could."</TE>
<TE>   Junior standout Riza Zalameda won her three sets, 6-2, 7-5, 6-2,
for Beverly Hills (21-1), ranked No. 2 by The Times. Beverly Hills
was not helped by the absence of regular No. 2 doubles player Liana
Babich, who left Sunday night on a family vacation to Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Without Babich, the Normans' No. 2 singles player, Tessa Tran, was
moved into doubles and Emily Peterson was thrust into the No. 2
singles spot. Tran and Stephanie Ellis won two of three sets, but
Peterson lost all of hers, by what turned out to be costly 6-0
scores. Shef, an experienced senior, also struggled with only one
victory in three sets.</TE>
<TE>   Brentwood 10, North Hollywood Campbell Hall 8 -- The No. 1 team of
Alexandra Rogers and Stephanie Marlis won three sets and the Eagles
won seven of nine sets in doubles to win the Division III title.</TE>
<TE>   The pair's 6-3 victory over Christine Chang and Christina
Cunningham gave Brentwood (20-2) its 10th point and clinched the
victory.</TE>
<TE>   Campbell Hall (14-5-1), making its first appearance in a final,
won six singles sets, including two each by Alli Krasnopolsky and
Daron Moore.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura St. Bonaventure 11, Riverside King 7 -- No. 1 singles
player Katie Callaghan did not lose a game while winning three sets
and Raine Mitchell also swept at No. 2 singles for the Seraphs, who
claimed the Division IV championship in a match between teams making
their first appearances in a final. St. Bonaventure (24-0) took a 5-1
advantage after the first round and never looked back, winning seven
of nine singles sets.</TE>
<TE>   The top Seraph doubles team of Allie Haus and Megan Molinski won
three sets.</TE>
<TE>   King (22-1) got two victories in three sets from its top two
doubles teams.</TE>
<TE>   -- Lauren Peterson</TE>
<TE>   San Juan Capistrano St. Margaret's 14, Santa Maria 4 -- The
Tartans won all nine singles matches on the way to winning the
Division V championship, their first tennis title in school history.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman Lauren Imre did not lose a game in three sets at No. 1
singles and finished with a 46-1 record for the top-seeded Tartans
(18-0).</TE>
<TE>   Unseeded Santa Maria (17-8) advanced to the championship with
consecutive 10-8 victories in the quarterfinals and semifinals.</TE>

<LD>The gales that ripped through the Claremont Club on Monday were
strong, but not as powerful as the winds of change that swept Palm
Desert High from its cozy perch in Southern Section Division IV to
the more difficult Division II before the girls' tennis season began.</LD>
<LD>   Consider Palm Desert's performance in the Division II championship
as the ultimate windbreaker -- a 12-6 victory over defending champion
Fullerton Troy that won the school its second Southern Section tennis
title in three years.</LD>
<LD>   Top-seeded Palm Desert (21-0) entered with a torrid playoff run
and continued to roll by gradually taking apart No. 2-seeded Troy
(20-4). The Aztecs took a 4-2 lead after the first round of play and
an 8-4 lead after the second round.</LD>
<TE>   Division IV, Division II, Division MCMLXVII? Didn't matter to the
Aztecs.</TE>
<TE>   "You take what is given to you," Palm Desert Coach Randy Blalock
said. "The girls understood that there was a full-on reorganization
going on [with several playoff divisions]."</TE>
<TE>   Said Robyn Baker, Palm Desert's No. 1 singles player: "We never
looked at it as moving up to Division II. We looked at it as winning
a [Southern Section] championship."</TE>
<TE>   Palm Desert's No. 1 doubles team of Caroline Houston and Brittany
Blalock, the coach's daughter, won all three of their sets as the
Aztecs won seven of nine sets in doubles play.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman Cosmina Ciobanu was a bright spot for Troy, winning all
three of her singles sets.</TE>

<DH>Monsoor's methods rejuvenate Los Alamitos girls' volleyball
team</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul McLeod</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Say what you want about how they pulled it off, the Los Alamitos High
girls' volleyball team is the Southern Section Division I-AA
champion.</LD>
<LD>   Which means the techniques employed by Coach Sue Monsoor will
probably be described as "dynamic" or "cutting edge" -- as opposed to
"different" or "strange."</LD>
<LD>   Monsoor officially became smarter than most when Los Alamitos
upset No. 1-ranked Long Beach Wilson, a team it had twice lost to
earlier in the season, in the title match Saturday at Cypress
College. Tonight, the Griffins (29-7) open the state playoffs by
playing host to Carlsbad La Costa Canyon (30-2) at 7 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   So chalk one up for underwater drills as conditioning exercises
and weekly team meals for bonding. And for find-your-inner-self
meditation classes in yoga, an idea Monsoor adopted after a family
vacation on Kauai.</TE>
<TE>   The third-year coach even hired a personal trainer to help develop
her players in body and mind.</TE>
<TE>   Monsoor's approach apparently was exactly what 15 skilled, highly
trained but somewhat bored teen-age girls from six club teams needed
to mold into an effective unit.</TE>
<TE>   "We have all been playing volleyball so long, so many years,"
senior defensive specialist Laura Kroneberger said. "We've done the
drills over and over. This was new stuff and we liked it because it
was so different."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps even more important, Monsoor, 47, sold her players on the
idea that winning in high school is just as important as it is for
elite club teams.</TE>
<TE>   "High school is the time to be with peers that they go to school
with every day," Monsoor said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a meld with friends they hang with. This is an important
time in their lives."</TE>
<TE>   Monsoor never planned on being a high school volleyball coach. She
was born in Canada but grew up in Long Beach, where she was an
outside hitter in volleyball and teammate of the late Flo Hyman on a
club team.</TE>
<TE>   After moving with her parents to England in 1972, Monsoor returned
a year later and graduated from Long Beach Wilson High. But her
skills got rusty during the time away and for most of the next 20
years she rarely touched a volleyball.</TE>
<TE>   Volleyball crept back into Monsoor's life at the church elementary
school where her two children, Rachel and Kevin, were enrolled.</TE>
<TE>   "As a parent, you had to do yard duty," she said. Monsoor played
volleyball with the kids, eventually became the school's coach, and
won several parochial league titles.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1990s, she coached several club teams.</TE>
<TE>   When Rachel enrolled at Los Alamitos in 1997, Monsoor intended to
be nothing more than a supportive mother. But a year later, when the
frosh-soph team needed a coach, she stepped in.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just going to help," she recalled.</TE>
<TE>   But Monsoor could see that the program needed an overhaul.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no continuity between the different levels before I
came on board," she said. "They were entities unto themselves. No one
knew what was going on at other levels. Nobody helped anyone else."</TE>
<TE>   Taking the varsity job three years ago, Monsoor began to
experiment with new ideas.</TE>
<TE>   During the summer, the team trained in the pool with the Griffin
boys' water polo team, and they met regularly with a personal trainer
for workouts designed to help them learn to trust each other and
improve their self-esteem. They worked on controlling their emotions
in pressure situations and performing well in tense moments.</TE>
<TE>   They developed team mantras such as "Steer the Ship" and wore tiny
heart pins on their lapels. As funny as it seems, several players
said, they began to believe that the amount of heart they put into
their actions would decide whether their ship would come in.</TE>
<TE>   Los Alamitos won Sunset League titles in 1991-93 -- and a state
championship in '93 -- but had slipped significantly until advancing
to the section semifinals a year ago. This season, all three levels
swept to league titles. And on Saturday, that ship docked.</TE>
<TE>   "At first, we really thought that what [Monsoor was having us do]
was funny," senior outside-hitter Hailey Hartong said. "But after a
while of doing it we all realized that we had gained mental focus in
pressure situations that helped in long rallies and playing in front
of big crowds."</TE>
<TE>   That helped in the Division I-AA championship match and should
serve the Griffins well in the state playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "Four to five years ago we had the talent here, but they didn't
have the ability to get the job done," Monsoor said.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a calming now. We're getting where we need to be."</TE>

<KH>KING REPORT</KH>
<HD>No Talks Yet With Potvin</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since the Kings saved him from the NHL scrap heap in February 2001,
Felix Potvin has done as much for his team as any other goaltender.</LD>
<LD>   Only two -- Martin Brodeur of the New Jersey Devils and the
retired Dominik Hasek, formerly of the Buffalo Sabres and Detroit Red
Wings -- have more victories since Feb. 20, 2001, when Potvin made
his first start for the Kings after being traded from the Vancouver
Canucks for considerations.</LD>
<LD>   Only four -- Brodeur, Hasek, Roman Cechmanek of the Philadelphia
Flyers and Patrick Roy of the Colorado Avalanche -- have compiled
lower goals-against averages.</LD>
<TE>   None has played more minutes or posted more shutouts.</TE>
<TE>   And yet, other than Coach Andy Murray, who has utilized Potvin as
his starter in all but 15 of 126 regular-season games since the
goaltender's arrival, plus all 20 playoff games, the Kings seem
reluctant to commit to Potvin. He is eligible to become an
unrestricted free agent when his contract runs out at midnight June
30.</TE>
<TE>   General Manager Dave Taylor has said he would like to sign Potvin,
31, to a multiyear deal, but no offer has been forthcoming.</TE>
<TE>   "We just haven't had any talks," Taylor said Monday. "We've just
been focused on the games."</TE>
<TE>   In September 2001, Potvin signed a one-year contract, plus a club
option for this season. Last summer, rather than attempt to hammer
out a longer deal, the Kings exercised their option. They're paying
their No. 1 goaltender $3.55 million this season, including
performance bonuses earned last season.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not ruling out that maybe something is going to happen,"
Potvin said. "But it's not really something that's bugging me.... It
sure would be fun to stay here, but it's out of my hands."</TE>
<TE>   Will the Kings sit down and talk contract with him at some point?</TE>
<TE>   "I would think so," Taylor said.</TE>

<HD>Iverson Steps Up to Lead 76er Win</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Larry Brown has coached Allen Iverson in all but one of the
superstar's six NBA seasons, and says he has never seen him play
better.</LD>
<LD>   Iverson had 29 points on 11-of-20 shooting as the Philadelphia
76ers avenged a loss to New Orleans with a 108-87 victory Monday
night that extended their home record to 8-0.</LD>
<LD>   "The thing that is exciting me is he's trying to do the right
thing every time down," Brown said. "His all-around game is as good
as anytime I've been around him."</LD>
<TE>   Iverson played one of his best games, making seven free throws in
nine attempts and dishing out four assists. Several other spectacular
passes went unconverted by his teammates. He says his improvement has
actually come on the defensive end.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm being as hard on myself on defense as I've been in offense,"
Iverson said. "Before I was concentrating so hard on getting a good
shot. Now I am working hard at both ends of the court."</TE>

<HD>At 28, Epstein to Run Red Sox</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Boston Red Sox made 28-year-old Theo Epstein the youngest general
manager in baseball history Monday, ending a long search for a
front-office leader by promoting one of their own.</LD>
<LD>   The Red Sox had been without a permanent general manager since
Florida financier John W. Henry bought the team in spring training
and fired Dan Duquette.</LD>
<LD>   Mike Port was interim general manager for the season and was a
candidate for the long-term job that went to Epstein. The team said
Port has been invited to remain as vice president of baseball
operations.</LD>
<TE>   Epstein, who was reared near Fenway Park in suburban Brookline,
became director of baseball operations for San Diego in 2000, when
Red Sox President Larry Lucchino was running the Padres. Epstein also
spent two years each in San Diego's media relations department and as
a baseball operations assistant.</TE>
<TE>   "The Red Sox are very much in my blood, which makes this --
standing here today as the new general manager of this club -- a
humbling experience," Epstein said at a Fenway Park news conference.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis Cardinal right-hander Andy Benes plans on ending his
baseball career, although he would not use the word "retirement." He
said he plans to speak soon with General Manager Walt Jocketty....
The Cardinals did re-sign pitcher Woody Williams, who agreed to a
$14.9-million, two-year contract.... Tom Glavine's agent prepared a
four-year counteroffer, hoping to spur higher bids from the Atlanta
Braves, New York Mets and Philadelphia Phillies.... The Pittsburgh
Pirates filled a long-troublesome spot in their lineup, acquiring
first baseman Randall Simon from the Detroit Tigers for three minor
leaguers, including Australian-born left-hander Adrian Burnside....
Houston Astro outfielder Richard Hidalgo suffered muscle and nerve
damage when he was shot in the left forearm during an attempted
carjacking in Venezuela last week. General Manager Gerry Hunsicker
said doctors are optimistic Hidalgo will be ready for spring
training.</TE>

the actress' spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   CART dropped the Rockingham 500 from next season's calendar,
leaving the troubled open-wheel series without any races in Europe in
2003. CART, however, hopes to announce shortly that it will hold at
least two races in Europe next year.</TE>
<TE>   ABC's regional college football telecast of USC's lopsided victory
over UCLA drew a mediocre 9.6 Nielsen rating in Los Angeles with a 23
share of the audience.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Ohio State's 14-9 victory over Michigan, which was
nationally televised, averaged an overnight rating of 8.5 with a 20
share in the major markets.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, the Ohio State-Michigan game posted a 6.4/16. It
got a 49.6/78 in Columbus, Ohio, a 31.5/57 in Cleveland and a 28.7/54
in Detroit.</TE>

<HD>Linden Finds Way to Top for Canucks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Trevor Linden passed an old friend Monday night.</LD>
<LD>   Linden became Vancouver's leading career goal scorer, passing
former team captain Stan Smyl, as the Canucks beat the Minnesota
Wild, 2-1, at St. Paul, Minn., for their seventh victory in a row.</LD>
<LD>   "Stan's a special person," Linden said of Smyl, whose career was
winding down when Linden joined the Canucks as the second overall
selection in the 1988 NHL draft. "When I came to this team, he was
someone I looked up to and he helped me a lot."</LD>
<TE>   Linden scored a short-handed goal at 5:58 of the third period,
giving him 263 in his 12 seasons with the team. In all, Linden has
scored 320 goals in 15 NHL seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a beautiful goal for him to get the record for the
Canucks," said Vancouver Coach Marc Crawford, whose team was outshot,
28-17. "It was probably one of the prettier ones he's scored."</TE>
<TE>   Linden took advantage of a giveaway by Minnesota's Cliff Ronning
in the neutral zone. He broke in alone and flipped a backhand over
Manny Fernandez's pad</TE>
<TE>   Henrik Sedin also scored for the Canucks, who closed to within two
points of the Wild in the Northwest Division.</TE>
<TE>   Ottawa 2, Toronto 0 -- Patrick Lalime made 22 saves as the
Senators extended their season-high unbeaten streak to seven games
with a victory over the Maple Leafs at Ottawa.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Fisher and Peter Schaefer scored the goals.</TE>
<TE>   Lalime, who has started 17 of Ottawa's 19 games, got his 21st
career shutout and first since April 5 at Washington. Lalime had four
shutouts in 12 playoff games for the Senators last spring.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 1, Chicago 0 -- Dan Hinote scored with 8:37 left at
Denver, and David Aebischer had 26 saves as the Avalanche won at home
for only the second time this season.</TE>
<TE>   It was Aebischer's sixth career shutout and the first by an
Avalanche goaltender this season.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago, which has lost the first four games of its seven-game
trip, got 23 saves from Jocelyn Thibault.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 5, Phoenix 1 -- Scott Young scored twice, and Mike Modano
had a goal and an assist as the Stars remained unbeaten at home in
regulation.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Guerin scored on the power play for his team-high 10th goal
and Pierre Turgeon had three assists for the Stars, 8-0-0-1 at
American Airlines Center this season.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose 4, St. Louis 1 -- Evgeni Nabokov made 32 saves and the
Sharks, despite being outshot, 13-4, in the third period, won at St.
Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Vincent Damphousse, Brad Stuart, Marco Sturm and Patrick Marleau
scored for San Jose. Scott Mellanby beat Nabokov on the power play to
spoil the shutout bid with 3:59 left.</TE>
<TE>   Edmonton 5, Detroit 4 -- Jason Smith beat Manny Legace 1:28 into
overtime to lead the Oilers to victory at Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Smith shoveled a rebound over a prone Legace off a goal-mouth
scramble to extend Detroit's winless streak to three games. The teams
tied, 1-1, Saturday night in Edmonton.</TE>
<TE>   New York Rangers 3, Carolina 1 -- Eric Lindros and Ronald
Petrovicky scored rare power-play goals, leading the Rangers at New
York.</TE>
<TE>   New York had only five power-play goals in 74 chances before
Monday and none in the five previous games. Dan Blackburn stopped 30
shots in his ninth straight start for the Rangers in place of Mike
Richter.</TE>

<HD>Bettman Sings Owners' Song on Road Show</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Helene Elliott</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Commissioner Gary Bettman has toured more North American cities than
the Rolling Stones and done more interviews lately than even Al Gore,
kicking off a public relations campaign to portray the NHL in a
favorable light before the expiration of the labor agreement between
the league and players.</LD>
<LD>   At every stop he has made two points in nearly the same words:
Owners need cost containment -- translation: a salary cap -- in the
next agreement and will soldier through a lockout to get a system
that will balance growth of salaries and revenues.</LD>
<LD>   "Given a choice between short-term pain or bleeding to death over
time, we will take the short-term pain," he said.</LD>
<TE>   He also said he's ready to start talks with the NHL Players Assn.,
but added, "Their response is, they like the status quo and they're
not interested in talking about changing right now."</TE>
<TE>   They don't want the changes he wants, certainly. He has been told
by owners a cap is a necessity and he has ammunition for a long
fight, if needed. Each club was asked to contribute $10 million to a
war chest.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Goodenow, executive director of the NHLPA, has said little
while Bettman is making his rounds. But in a recent interview at the
union's Toronto office with The Times' Chris Foster, Goodenow said
Bettman had made no proposal and his offer to talk "is just a ploy on
Gary's part to deflect the issue.... If he has a proposal that he
thinks will interest the players, he should bring it forward."</TE>
<TE>   Goodenow also said he's hopeful a work stoppage will be averted,
though he interpreted Bettman's recent remarks as throwing down the
negotiating gauntlet. The current agreement, forged after a 104-day
lockout cut the 1994-95 season to 48 games, expires Sept. 15, 2004.</TE>
<TE>   "If it were a partnership/business negotiation, it would be a
little bit different than a labor negotiation," Goodenow said. "But I
think the league is historically, and appears from current comments,
that they want it to be another labor negotiation. If that's the
case, it will have a certain style and flavor to it that would set it
apart from being a real business/partnership negotiation.... If there
is a problem, if the owners' position is one I have heard about, then
certainly there will be problems."</TE>
<TE>   The main sticking point for Goodenow, whose constituents' average
salary has climbed from $572,000 in 1993-94 to about $1.7 million
this season, is a cap. A luxury tax was discussed during the 1994
talks but discarded; Major League Baseball has a tax, and the NFL and
NBA have caps.</TE>
<TE>   Knowing the word "cap" will trigger hostility, Bettman has used
euphemisms such as "containment" or "cost certainty." To Goodenow, if
it looks like a skunk and acts like a skunk, it's wise to have a
clothespin handy.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of what he said is a problem is [a] disparity in revenues,
and revenue sharing can address that, although it doesn't appear his
bosses can agree on a revenue-sharing program that will satisfy each
other," Goodenow said.</TE>
<TE>   "The revenues in the league have grown dramatically. They have had
a problem, Gary has had a problem, managing the distribution of the
growth and the revenue. If he has a disparity problem, but he has
grown revenues to a large degree, then I think maybe there has been a
mismanagement on how they distribute those revenues."</TE>
<TE>   The current agreement limits unrestricted free agency until
players are 31, with rare exceptions. Restricted or Group II free
agency, in which the player's team can match outside offers and get
compensation of up to five first-round draft picks, has been more
restrictive than Goodenow anticipated.</TE>
<TE>   "When we negotiated the collective agreement, we thought there
would possibly be more activity in that area, in terms of offer
sheets," Goodenow said. "But it hasn't materialized. By the same
token, salaries have moved in a different way too. I guess I would
say I misjudged, to a degree, the level of which there might have
been some Group II offer sheets to players, but that's a historical
perspective."</TE>
<TE>   Here's another perspective: The last lockout was a momentum-killer
for the NHL. And in a shaky economy, the multimillionaire players and
billionaire owners will find little sympathy from fans or
advertisers.</TE>
<TE>   All involved should start working quietly toward a resolution.
Baseball players and owners realized this summer they would have lost
more in good will than they would have gained through a work
stoppage, and NHL players and owners should take note.</TE>
<TE>   Jokinen's No Joke</TE>
<TE>   Five years and two teams after the Kings chose him third overall
in the entry draft, Olli Jokinen is realizing his potential.</TE>
<TE>   Heralded by King General Manager Dave Taylor as "very aggressive
and very mature," Jokinen said on draft day that the Kings "need a
big center and I'm ready. It's no problem to adjust."</TE>
<TE>   But the 6-foot-3 Finn, moved around too much by then-coach Larry
Robinson, struggled with English and never found ways to use his size
and skills. He had no points in eight games his first season and nine
goals in 66 games in 1998-99 before the Kings reluctantly traded him
to the New York Islanders in the Ziggy Palffy deal.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes it takes time for young players to develop when they
come in the league," said Jokinen, who was dealt from New York to
Florida in June 2000. "I was a high pick and there were big
expectations. When you don't score, you go in the wrong direction....
There were some tough times the first few years. I was even thinking
about going back to Europe and getting my confidence back over there,
but things turned for me."</TE>
<TE>   The catalyst was Panther Coach Mike Keenan, who pushed Jokinen to
improve his fitness and played him in crucial situations. Jokinen,
who will face the Kings on Wednesday at Staples Center, is among the
league's scoring leaders with 12 goals and 26 points. And he's still
nine days from his 24th birthday.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw talent," Keenan said. "When I made the decision to play him
a lot last year, I said, 'We've got to find out once and for all if
all the scouts in the world were wrong. I'm going to give him the
benefit of the doubt,' and he's really stepped up."</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, too late for the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   Said Jokinen: "Better later than never."</TE>
<TE>   Here's the Pitch</TE>
<TE>   When the New York Mets wooed free-agent pitcher Tom Glavine last
week, they brought out some heavy hitters.</TE>
<TE>   They had New York Ranger goalie Mike Richter and Hall of Famer Rod
Gilbert drop by during lunch to greet Glavine, a standout
Massachusetts high school hockey player drafted by the Kings in 1984
before Luc Robitaille.</TE>
<TE>   In a variation of the theme, the Philadelphia Phillies took
Glavine to a Philadelphia Flyers' game. His picture on the scoreboard
drew a standing ovation.</TE>
<TE>   Slap Shots</TE>
<TE>   Is there a hat shortage in Canada? Fans in Montreal didn't toss a
single chapeau to the ice after a hat trick by Saku Koivu Nov. 18 and
their Toronto counterparts tossed merely six hats a few days later to
celebrate a three-goal effort by the Maple Leafs' Alexander Mogilny.
The nets behind the goals prevent hats from reaching the ice, but
that doesn't explain why none were launched elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe it's just a sign that the economy is doing poorly," Mogilny
said.</TE>
<TE>   Stats of the day: The Pittsburgh Penguins have scored 31 of their
62 goals on the power play. Of those 31, Mario Lemieux has figured in
25, with six goals and 19 assists. He has played all 20 games and is
averaging 24 minutes 15 seconds of ice time and more than two points
a game, with a league-leading 41.</TE>
<TE>   Despite leading the Northeast Division, the Boston Bruins are
drawing poorly. In the last three weeks, they've had their two
smallest crowds since they moved to the Fleet Center in 1995. And
they're not alone: The Rangers' game at New Jersey and Montreal's
visit to Ottawa last week didn't sell out.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd pay to watch these guys play," Bruin forward Joe Thornton
said of his teammates.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is, he's among the few who can afford tickets, parking
and food at that characterless arena.</TE>
<TE>   Roger Neilson, fighting bone and skin cancer, was hospitalized for
tests last Friday in Ottawa.... Vultures are circling Calgary Coach
Greg Gilbert. He mishandled a dispute with Marc Savard and they
weren't speaking by the time Flame General Manager Craig Button
traded Savard to Atlanta.... Rumors have the Colorado Avalanche
interested enough in unsigned restricted free agent Kyle McLaren to
give up Alex Tanguay or Martin Skoula. But the Bruins are playing
well enough to wait for the best deal.</TE>

<TE>   In case you missed it, Southern California finally has a
legitimate NHL rivalry that is only going to get better. Coach Andy
Murray hates to lose to the Ducks, and Anaheim's first-year Coach
Mike Babcock will make sure that his team remembers the Kings' 4-2
victory at the Pond in early October. Goaltending will be a key.</TE>

<HD>Report: Olympics Getting Too Big</HD>
<DH>On eve of IOC assembly, document supports Rogge notion that
it's time to slow burgeoning growth of the Games.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alan Abrahamson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>The Olympic Games have enjoyed "unparalleled growth" over the last
century but are now so big they are in peril of suffocating in their
own popularity, an International Olympic Committee report warns.</LD>
<LD>   The report, released Monday, urges cuts in costs, complexity and
size. In comprehensively documenting the growth in the Games'
popularity during the 20th century, an IOC panel noted that the
Summer Games, from the postwar 1948 Games in London to the most
recent 2000 Olympics in Sydney, grew from 17 to 28 sports, 4,092 to
10,651 athletes, 136 to 300 events and 59 to 199 competing nations.
Across the globe, nine of 10 people with access to TVs saw part of
the Sydney Games.</LD>
<LD>   The Winter Games also have experienced stupendous growth. From St.
Moritz, Switzerland, in 1948 to Salt Lake City in 2002, the numbers
have shot up: four to seven sports, 669 to 2,399 athletes, 22 to 78
events and 28 to 77 nations.</LD>
<TE>   Bigger Games demand more of everything. The number of meals served
each day in the Olympic village, for instance, grew from 35,000 in
Barcelona in 1992 to almost 50,000 in Sydney. There were 2,100
official cars on hand in Barcelona, 4,700 in Sydney, an increase of
124%. Technology budgets in Sydney totaled $770 million. Law
enforcement officials in Australia performed 250,000 Games-related
vehicle searches and oversaw 8.5 million trips through airport-style
metal detectors -- and that, of course, was before the Sept. 11,
2001, terror attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The time has come, the report concludes, to pause.</TE>
<TE>   However, the panel, chaired by longtime IOC member Dick Pound of
Canada, offers no magic formula for downscaling in the report.
Rather, it suggests for consideration by the full IOC a series of
deliberate logistical steps, such as a review of the number of days
the village is open before and after the Games, on the principle that
each day of service requires millions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   The report makes clear, however, that something must be done: "The
Games have reached a critical size, which may put their future
success at risk if the size continues to increase. Steps must be
undertaken and serious consideration given to effectively manage
future growth, while at the same time preserving the attractiveness
of the Games."</TE>
<TE>   The report, issued on the eve of an all-delegates IOC assembly
here that will serve as a major test of the leadership of Jacques
Rogge, the Belgian elected last year to an eight-year term as IOC
president, dovetails with Rogge's repeated calls to slow -- if not
stop -- the Games' growth.</TE>
<TE>   "This meeting will be critical in showing the [IOC] members who's
actually running the show under this new regime," University of
Chicago professor John MacAloon, an expert on the Olympic movement,
said. "That is unquestionably the larger revelation."</TE>
<TE>   Rogge has said many times in the last two years, during his
campaign for the presidency and since taking office, that the Games
were becoming so big that some cities -- particularly those in Latin
America and Africa -- could not even dream of staging them.</TE>
<TE>   As the report points out, the number of accredited people at the
Games has doubled over 20 years, from 100,000 at the Los Angeles
Games in 1984 to 200,000 in Sydney.</TE>
<TE>   The addition of sports, disciplines and events is "the main
driver" for the increase over the years in the size of the Games, the
report says. Each additional athlete now costs an additional $30,000;
each press representative $15,000.</TE>
<TE>   The Summer Games now cost at least $3 billion, the report says --
$2 billion run through a local organizing committee, with at least
another $1 billion in costs such as security and transit, typically
borne in some measure by local, regional or national authorities.</TE>
<TE>   The Winter Games -- with about one-fourth the athletes --
nonetheless cost at least $2.2 billion, $1.5 billion in organizing
committee costs, the rest governmental expenditures, the report
estimates.</TE>
<TE>   The IOC is due this week to take up a proposal that baseball,
softball and modern pentathlon be cut from the Summer Games, perhaps
as soon as the Beijing Games in 2008.</TE>
<TE>   It remains far from clear, however, whether Rogge has the
political support to cut the three sports. The proposal was announced
in August but a decision may be postponed until the next
all-delegates IOC assembly, next July in Prague, capital of the Czech
Republic.</TE>
<TE>   Also up for consideration at the IOC session this week is a review
of the 50-point reform plan the IOC enacted in 1999, in the wake of
the Salt Lake City corruption scandal.</TE>
<TE>   The IOC decided then that its members could not visit cities
bidding for the Games. Rogge has said he is in favor of the ban. Some
members view it as an imposition on their personal freedom and
professional integrity.</TE>

<HD>Conner Tries to Clip OneWorld's Sails</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rich Roberts</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The quarterfinal repechage round of the Louis Vuitton Cup challenger
trials for the America's Cup started late, after three days of too
little wind or too much wind, but that didn't slow the elimination
process.</LD>
<LD>   There is more than one way to sink a rival.</LD>
<LD>   Team Dennis Conner spent the last couple of days firing paper
torpedoes into Seattle's OneWorld, its opponent in the best-of-seven
knockout series.</LD>
<TE>   The New York Yacht Club entry protested to the event's
international jury that OneWorld, headed by billionaires Paul Allen
and Craig McCaw, should be kicked out of the Cup for using secret
Team New Zealand design information in the current competition. An
initial hearing was scheduled Monday night to address procedural
matters only.</TE>
<TE>   A day earlier, Team Dennis Conner and Italy's Prada had filed a
joint application with the arbitration panel, which rules on
violations of the protocol, which is meant to discourage dirty
tricks. The paper referred to "recent access to evidence in
connection with the possession and use by OneWorld of other
syndicates' design information."</TE>
<TE>   Why now, long after OneWorld has already been punished -- however
lightly -- after previously admitting having such information?</TE>
<TE>   The latest action charges OneWorld with using the stolen
technology on its own boats and claims, in a Team Dennis Conner press
release, to have 92 pages of "comprehensive documentary evidence" to
back it up, without offering details.</TE>
<TE>   The submission requests that "OneWorld be disqualified from both
[the challengers trials and the America's Cup]," the statement said.</TE>
<TE>   The new development is connected to an affidavit by former Team
New Zealand rules advisor Sean Reeves, long held but not made public
by TNZ. Reeves, a lawyer who defected to OneWorld along with lead
designer Laurie Davidson and several sailors after the 1995 defense,
became the center of a firestorm when he had a falling out with
OneWorld and allegedly peddled design information to other
challengers, among them Team Dennis Conner and San Francisco's Oracle
BMW.</TE>
<TE>   A source said that Team New Zealand consented to release the
affidavit to the challengers only late last week.</TE>
<TE>   However, Reeves, who is back living in the Auckland suburb of
Devenport, may not be available to testify. He is under a gag order
by a U.S. court in a legal action brought against him by OneWorld.</TE>
<TE>   That could put Team Dennis Conner in an awkward position. Bill
Trenkle, Conner's general manager and longtime crew member, filed an
affidavit in OneWorld's behalf last February detailing Reeves' offer
to sell design secrets during a breakfast meeting in Del Mar in June
2001. Now Reeves' affidavit may be Team Dennis Conner's best
evidence.</TE>
<TE>   But there also was the disclosure offered by New Zealand's ONE
News TV last June about an e-mail allegedly sent to OneWorld by "a
mast company executive" which read: "The work we have done to date on
our own fittings [locks and such] has been essentially copying TNZ
designs, based on input from ex-TNZ team members ... [and] it may be
pretty obvious where some of the designs really originated."</TE>
<TE>   The e-mail apparently was meant as a warning.</TE>
<TE>   In an apparent resolution of the matter in August, OneWorld's mea
culpa -- and a declaration that it hadn't used the information -- got
the team off with a minimal penalty from the arbitration panel: one
point (i.e., victory) deducted from its score for the two
round-robins in October.</TE>
<TE>   OneWorld called it a "harsh but just penalty."</TE>
<TE>   The panel of five prominent international jurists with sailing
backgrounds ruled, in part: "The panel accepts the unchallenged
evidence given by the OWC witnesses, to the effect that the material
wrongfully in their possession was not utilized by OWC for design
purposes ... [and that] it may be impossible for another participant
to prove that the information had been used."</TE>
<TE>   Not anymore, Team Dennis Conner and Prada say.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyer Jim Farmer, representing Prada and Team Dennis Conner, was
quoted in the New Zealand Herald as saying that his clients believed
OneWorld had misled the arbitration panel during the last case and
had intentionally used the design secrets.</TE>
<TE>   "There is compelling evidence ... that there was actual, known use
of Team New Zealand's drawings," the complaint to the panel says.</TE>
<TE>   A century and a half of America's Cup history is rife with such
disputes. In 1986 at Fremantle, Australia, Conner questioned the
legality of New Zealand's fiberglass boats when all of the other
12-meters were built of aluminum.</TE>
<TE>   In 1988, Conner's team dragged New Zealand into court for a rogue
challenge with a boat built to the limit of the rules -- then won
with a catamaran. In 1992, at San Diego, Italy's Il Moro fought to
disqualify New Zealand for illegal use of a bowsprit.</TE>

<LD>The defending world champion United States women's national team will
play at least three and almost certainly four World Cup-bound teams
at the 10th annual Algarve Cup in Portugal in March.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. will play in Group A, along with Canada, Sweden and
France in the 12-nation event.</LD>
<LD>   All three U.S. opponents have qualified for the 2003 FIFA Women's
World Cup in China in September.</LD>
<TE>   The Americans, who have won the Algarve Cup only once, are favored
to win their group and, if so, will meet the winner of Group B in the
final.</TE>
<TE>   Group B includes World Cup host China, Olympic champion Norway,
which also has qualified, Denmark and Finland.</TE>
<TE>   Group C, whose teams are not contending for the championship,
features Wales, Greece, Portugal and a team to be determined.</TE>
<TE>   Haan Denial</TE>
<TE>   Dutch Coach Arie Haan, who last week was widely reported to have
been named China's new coach, Monday angrily denied that he had
accepted or even been offered the position.</TE>
<TE>   "It's rubbish, a complete fabrication," Haan said of reports in
the German and Chinese media and also carried on the official Web
site of the Asian Football Confederation.</TE>
<TE>   "I have the feeling I have been put in this situation by a local
Stuttgart newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   "I have called them and told them in no uncertain terms what I
think of them. Somebody writes a story and the rest [of the media]
reprint it.</TE>
<TE>   "The China story is lies. I did not speak with any Chinese
official."</TE>
<TE>   Stoilov Recovering</TE>
<TE>   Bulgarian national team player Stoycho Stoilov, who last week was
shot in the chest, liver, arm and leg during an argument after a
traffic accident, has regained consciousness and is expected to
recover.</TE>
<TE>   "What is important is that Stoilov's life is not in danger
anymore," said Stefan Strugarov, a surgeon in Blagoevgrad, Bulgaria,
where the incident occurred.</TE>
<TE>   "I cannot tell how much time he will need for rehabilitation, but
we can be sure it will not be less than several months."</TE>
<TE>   Cooper Resurfaces</TE>
<TE>   Keith Cooper, the former director of communications for FIFA who
was controversially fired by Joseph "Sepp" Blatter during the FIFA
president's post-World Cup purge of those he felt were not totally
supportive of him, has been hired by UEFA, European soccer's ruling
body.</TE>
<TE>   Cooper, 55, will initially be in charge of organizing the events
surrounding the Jubilee 2004 project, UEFA's 50th anniversary
celebration.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican Playoffs</TE>
<TE>   The field for the Mexican league's quarterfinals was set when UAG
and Santos Laguna clinched the final two places in the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   UAG, coached by former Peruvian national team coach Julio Cesar
Uribe, defeated Chiapas, 2-0, on goals by Chile's Reinaldo Navia and
Peru's Roberto Palacios, to secure its spot in the final eight.</TE>
<TE>   Santos Laguna did so by trouncing Toluca, 5-2.</TE>
<TE>   Toluca had lost only once in 18 previous games.</TE>
<TE>   One of Toluca's goals was scored by Paraguayan striker Jose
Cardozo, bringing his league-record total to 29 goals in 19 games.</TE>
<TE>   In the quarterfinals, defending champion Club America plays Santos
Laguna, Toluca plays Guadalajara, UNAM plays Cruz Azul and Morelia
plays UAG.</TE>
<TE>   Limpar Retires</TE>
<TE>   Midfielder Anders Limpar, who played for clubs in Sweden,
Switzerland, Italy, England and the U.S., announced his retirement at
37.</TE>
<TE>   Limpar, whose 58 games for Sweden included those in the 1990 and
1994 World Cups, played for Major League Soccer's Colorado Rapids

<HD>Toledo Admits Mistake</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It took some cajoling, but Coach Bob Toledo eventually admitted
Monday that replacing starting quarterback Drew Olson with Matt Moore
in the second quarter of the loss to USC was a mistake.</LD>
<LD>   Olson overcame early jitters to direct an 89-yard scoring drive
that cut USC's lead to 21-7. The Bruins forced a punt and took over
at their six-yard line. Another scoring march might have made for a
close game rather than the 52-21 debacle that transpired.</LD>
<LD>   But Moore, who like Olson is a freshman, was inserted and he
fumbled the first two snaps. The Trojans recovered the second miscue
and scored a touchdown moments later.</LD>
<TE>   "If you look at practice, Matt never fumbled snaps and Drew
fumbled a few snaps," Toledo said. "I never thought Matt would fumble
the football. He also performed well once he got comfortable."</TE>
<TE>   But by the time Moore got comfortable, the score was out of reach.</TE>
<TE>   The quarterbacks are regarded as equal in ability, but Toledo
acknowledged that he should have departed from his pregame plan of
using both in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   Because Olson had played through his nervousness, he had the best
chance of directing another drive at a critical juncture.</TE>
<TE>   "Looking back, it was a bad decision," Toledo said. "It didn't
work out, so I look [bad]. Now that it happened, of course, I
wouldn't do it again. I wanted to get Matt in the game before
halftime and whoever had the hot hand, go with him in the second
half.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be criticized for that one forever. I obviously made a
mistake."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Olson will start against Washington State on Dec. 7. Moore, who
has a mild concussion, again is expected to play.</TE>
<TE>   Running back Akil Harris (concussion) and receivers Tab Perry
(ankle), Craig Bragg (concussion) and Jon Dubravac (broken toes) are
not practicing this week.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   C.J. Niusulu is expected to plead guilty to a reduced misdemeanor
charge today in Barstow Superior Court. He would be sentenced in
December.</TE>
<TE>   The freshman defensive tackle is charged with felony battery
stemming from a fight at a Barstow drive-in theater in July. Toledo
said a felony conviction would prompt Niusulu's dismissal from the
team.</TE>
<TE>   Niusulu, who has played well as a reserve, had an emergency
appendectomy last week and did not play against USC. He is not
expected to play against Washington State.</TE>

<LD>   USC's freshman receiver acknowledged Monday that he was a step
slow Saturday against UCLA when he mishandled one pass and could not
catch up to another that probably would have resulted in a touchdown.</LD>
<LD>   It was the second consecutive game that Williams struggled because
of a thigh bruise.</LD>
<TE>   "I've been missing a gear," Williams said. "I can't top out. But
I'm getting that back. Today I felt light and carefree with no pain
at all."</TE>
<TE>   Williams' 997 yards receiving are a Pacific 10 Conference freshman
record. He caught six passes for 66 yards against UCLA, but did not
have a touchdown reception for the first time in eight games.</TE>
<TE>   Williams said he would be at full strength for Saturday's
regular-season finale between sixth-ranked USC and No. 7 Notre Dame
at the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   "The last two weeks, I haven't performed as well as my teammates
or the fans have been accustomed to," Williams said. "This week's
game presents a perfect opportunity to show everybody that I'm back."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Offensive coordinator Norm Chow said officials at Utah have not
contacted him regarding their head coaching position.</TE>
<TE>   Utah, which defeated USC in the Las Vegas Bowl last year, fired
Ron McBride on Monday, two days after the Utes completed a 5-6
season. Chow is regarded as a natural candidate because he played on
the offensive line for Utah in 1965-67 and coached at Brigham Young
for 27 seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "No one's called and I'm not calling them," Chow said. "It's a
mixed bag. Can you go home? Do you want to go back? ... I'm not
sitting around looking to be a head coach."</TE>
<TE>   Chow, however, said he would not rule out talking to schools about
head coaching positions if contacted.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC moved up to No. 6 in the bowl championship series
standings.... Center Norm Katnik did not practice because of a left
ankle sprain suffered against UCLA, but said he expected to play
Saturday.... Freshman fullback Brandon Hancock had an MRI exam for a
right knee injury suffered in the fourth quarter against UCLA. He
said it was a sprain that would not prevent him from playing
Saturday.</TE>

season opener at North Carolina Charlotte. They started the season
with an exhibition loss to NCAA Division II Cal State San Bernardino.

<DL></DL>
<LD>Loyola Marymount is off to its best start in seven seasons after
defeating short-handed Cal State Sacramento, 88-55, Monday night at
Gersten Pavilion.</LD>
<LD>   The Lions are 2-0 for the first time since the 1995-96 season,
which was the last time they finished with a winning record. The
victory was Loyola's most lopsided since a 41-point win over Cal
State Hayward in 1994. It's all good news for third-year Coach Steve
Aggers, who's still sorting out a roster that includes nine new
players, including seven freshmen.</LD>
<LD>   "We found out some things about roles on our team," Aggers said.
"With the youth that we have, it might take a few more games."</LD>
<TE>   Junior forward Keith Kincade scored nine of his 14 points in the
first half to lead four Loyola players in double figures. Freshman
point guard Wes Wardrop added 13 points, and sophomore forward Andy
Osborn and junior forward Sherman Gay each scored 10.</TE>
<TE>   For the second consecutive game, Loyola thrived with defense and
depth. The Lions limited Sacramento to 15-for-49 shooting (30.6%) and
forced 22 turnovers, and they went deep into their bench, using 13
players.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento (0-1) was without three upperclassmen who are not
expected to join the team until January because of eligibility
issues.</TE>

<TE>   No. 10 Oregon 86, Cal State Northridge 77 -- Luke Jackson scored

Ducks past the Matadors in the championship game of the John Thompson
Foundation Challenge. Northridge (1-2) tied the score, 73-73, on
Chris Davis' layup with 3:17 left, but Oregon (2-0) answered with a
5-0 run to go ahead, 78-73. Ian Boylan's 13 points led Northridge.</TE>

<KH>UCLA REPORT</KH>
<HD>Read Their Lips: This Practice Is a Real Pain</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Losing two exhibitions hurt UCLA's pride. And judging from the scars,
the Bruins are giving the notion of playing with intensity something
more tangible than lip service.</LD>
<LD>   Center Ryan Hollins has a fat lip and forward Jason Kapono is
wearing a bandage below his bottom lip, the result of a collision in
practice. Guard Jon Crispin returned to practice after suffering a
concussion last week.</LD>
<LD>   "It's obvious we are not where we need to be, so we've really
brought it at practice," Kapono said.</LD>
<TE>   The players are anxious about tonight's opener against San Diego.
Anxious about how they will perform. Anxious about the mood of the
Pauley Pavilion crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got a lot of [national championship] banners hanging in
here, and the fans are getting salty," center T.J. Cummings said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kapono practiced without a bandage on this right thumb for the
first time since spraining it more than a week ago. He is expected to
play tonight. "The bandage affects my shot, so I have to get rid of
it," he said. "I've got to fight through the pain and play."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins will be without reserve point guard Ryan Walcott
tonight and Saturday against Duke. Walcott must serve a two-game
suspension because he played in two exhibitions before redshirting
during the 2000-01 season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Word that former Bruin center Dan Gadzuric has changed the
pronunciation of his name from Gad-ZUR-ick to Gad-zur-EECH amused
Kapono. Gadzuric, the rookie center of the Milwaukee Bucks, announced
the change last week.</TE>
<TE>   "That's Dan, he's a funny guy," Kapono said. "For some reason he
just wanted to change his name. He's spontaneous like that."</TE>

<TE>   Records -- UCLA 0-0, San Diego 1-0.</TE>
<TE>   Update -- The Bruin season begins with glaring questions about
rebounding, defense and effort. They lost their first exhibition by
25 points, their worst loss at Pauley Pavilion, and their second by
six. The play of senior guard Ray Young, who scored 41 points, was
one of the few positives in the exhibitions. San Diego, coached by
former UCLA player and assistant Brad Holland, defeated Nevada,
77-75, in its opener. Center Jason Keep, a 6-foot-10 transfer from
Oklahoma State, scored 19 points for the Toreros, who were 16-13 last
season.</TE>

<LD>There was no sense of self-importance in USC's locker room after the
Trojans' ragged 81-68 season-opening win over second-year Division I
school UC Riverside on Friday night.</LD>
<LD>   And that's a good thing, the players acknowledged, because if they
have another disjointed performance tonight, the Trojans would be
ripe to be picked apart by Rhode Island, which is opening its
$54-million Ryan Center.</LD>
<LD>   "We've got to get some fire from inside and play harder," said
sophomore center Rory O'Neil, who had his first career double-double
with 13 points and a career-high 11 rebounds Friday.</LD>
<TE>   Forward Nick Curtis, who had career highs in points (12), rebounds
(eight) and minutes (19), blamed "first-game jitters" for an awkward
season opener in which, Coach Henry Bibby said, the Trojans played
with no urgency.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got a lot to work on," Curtis said. "A lot of guys took
plays off. It's unexplainable."</TE>
<TE>   Imagine the explaining the Trojans would have to do if they play
the same way against a team that finished 8-20 last season, which
included an 82-54 loss at USC.</TE>
<TE>   Sending a message to his seniors last Dec. 4, Bibby benched David
Bluthenthal, Sam Clancy and Brandon Granville to start the Rhode
Island game and started freshmen Curtis, O'Neil and Errick Craven,
sophomore Desmon Farmer and junior Robert Hutchinson.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After reviewing tape of Riverside guard Nate Carter's last-second
basket against USC, both teams agreed that the freshman's shot was a
three-pointer instead of a two-point basket as originally awarded,
making the final 81-68.</TE>

<HD>Iraq Bears Burden of Proof</HD>
<DH>The chief weapons inspector insists on 'convincing
evidence' that Baghdad does not possess weapons of mass destruction.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maggie Farley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>UNITED NATIONS -- As 17 inspectors arrived in Baghdad on Monday to
prepare for their first foray to suspected weapons sites in four
years, their chief told the U.N. Security Council that they will
assume Iraq has weapons of mass destruction unless it can prove
otherwise.</LD>
<LD>   The inspectors' stance puts great pressure on Baghdad, which
maintains that it has no such weapons but must provide an inventory
by Dec. 8 of anything that can be used to make biological, chemical
or nuclear arms.</LD>
<LD>   It also signals that when inspections actually begin on Wednesday,
the inspectors will take a tougher line than in the past, forcing
Iraq to back up its assertions with "convincing evidence" such as
documents or testimony -- even if it has nothing to declare. The
Security Council will probably regard omissions that it judges
intentional and lack of cooperation with inspectors as triggers for
military action.</LD>
<TE>   "The production of mustard gas is not exactly the same as
production of marmalade. You do expect those who produce chemical
weapons to keep some tracks of what they have produced," Hans Blix,
the chief weapons inspector, said after meeting with the Security
Council.</TE>
<TE>   "They have provided a lot of figures to [inspectors] in the past.
These figures do not give a full account. If they want to be
believed, they had better provide either the weapons, if they remain,
or better accounts."</TE>
<TE>   Blix said that Iraq's previous declarations under an inspection
program that ended in 1998 left "open questions" about its weapons
capabilities. The list of items that group of inspectors said were
unaccounted for when they left includes 3,000 tons of precursor
materials for biological weapons; 360 tons of chemical weapon agents;
30,000 munitions for delivery of weapons; VX nerve gas; and 7,000
liters of anthrax.</TE>
<TE>   The new inspectors arrived Monday aboard a white C-130 transport
plane along with a cargo of high-tech sensors and computers they will
use when they start their inspections later in the week. U.N.
officials said that the first inspections will check surveillance
equipment left in place when the last group of inspectors pulled out.</TE>
<TE>   The team will later look at new or rebuilt sites. Dozens more
inspectors are scheduled to arrive Dec. 8, with a buildup to nearly
100 inspectors by Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   At the United Nations, Blix warned of potential flash points:
While Iraqi officials professed their intention to cooperate, they
told him that "entry to ministries and presidential sites are not the
same as entry to factories."</TE>
<TE>   But the Security Council resolution passed unanimously Nov. 8
authorizes U.N. inspectors to go anywhere at any time -- especially
to those sensitive sites such as presidential palaces, which were
previously protected by special arrangements. Blix said inspectors
had reestablished a 24-hour hotline with Iraqi officials to arrange
surprise visits in the middle of the night, if they choose.</TE>
<TE>   Iraqi officials still are confused about completing the
declaration due Dec. 8, specifically how to account for some
materials used in petrochemical factories, medical labs, research
centers and the agricultural sector that might also be used to
produce banned weapons. Iraq has hundreds, perhaps thousands, of such
sites, and Iraqi officials are worried that "time for submission was
short and omissions could have serious consequences," Blix told the
council.</TE>
<TE>   Blix said he told Iraqi officials to focus on the weapons, and
that inspectors could follow up with questions on dual-use goods
later.</TE>
<TE>   But he also warned them to check their stocks and storerooms
carefully before reporting a clean slate.</TE>
<TE>   "They are aware that the consequences could be very serious," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Inspectors have learned lessons from Iraq's past "full and final"
declarations that turned out to be anything but. The previous team of
inspectors found documents that detailed a biological weapons cache
much greater than Iraq had reported. Baghdad made several subsequent
"final" reports.</TE>
<TE>   With the threat of war hanging over the inspectors' mission, this
report really will be Iraq's "final chance," the Security Council has
cautioned.</TE>
<TE>   That warning was repeated by world leaders Monday after Iraqi
Foreign Minister Naji Sabri sent an 11-page letter to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan over the weekend with a point-by-point
rebuttal of the Nov. 8 resolution.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, en route to Mexico City, told
reporters that the letter "was certainly not indicative of a
cooperative attitude."</TE>
<TE>   "We have no doubt he does have weapons of mass destruction," Prime
Minister Tony Blair said of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein at a news
conference in London. "But I have made it clear throughout that this
has got to be a situation in which there is an honest declaration by
Saddam."</TE>
<TE>   In Paris, Annan and French President Jacques Chirac urged Iraq to
cooperate fully with the inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the only way to avoid a military conflict in the region,"
Annan said.</TE>
<TE>   Chirac urged Baghdad to offer the inspectors all they needed to do
their job.</TE>
<TE>   Against the backdrop of resumed inspections, Security Council
members also haggled Monday over how long to extend a humanitarian
program for Iraq and whether to add more items to a list of goods it
may not import.</TE>
<TE>   After the United States refused to renew the plan for the usual
six months, the council agreed to extend the oil-for-food program,
which would have expired at midnight, until Dec. 4 so negotiations
among Washington and the other 14 nations could continue.</TE>
<TE>   The plan allows Iraq to import food, medicine and other supplies
to ease the impact of U.N. sanctions imposed after Hussein's 1990
invasion of Kuwait. It allows Iraq to sell unlimited quantities of
oil, with revenue going into a U.N. account that pays vendors for the
goods that Iraq orders.</TE>
<TE>   The United States, and particularly the Pentagon, wants to add
items to the "goods review list" of civilian supplies going to
Baghdad that could have military uses and must be reviewed separately
by Security Council members.</TE>
<TE>   "There were some items under the goods review list that we felt
did not necessarily have a benign or purely civilian or humanitarian
purpose," said U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. John D. Negroponte. "And
we were concerned that this list be improved to address some of the
items that the government of Iraq has tried to import as of late."</TE>
<TE>   The items include Cipro, an antibiotic also known as ciprofloxacin
that is used after exposure to anthrax, and atropine, which can be
used as an antidote for nerve gases, as well as global positioning
system jammers and radio intercept devices.</TE>

<HD>Why Outsiders Are In in Latin America</HD>
<DH>Voters have set aside ideology in their desire for a higher
standard of living. But populist campaign promises may be hard to
keep.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. Christian Miller and Hector Tobar</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>QUITO, Ecuador</DL>
<LD>Across Latin America, people are trading in the old for the new. In
country after country, voters are rejecting political parties and
powerful party bosses who have long dominated the economic and social
landscape in favor of outsiders.</LD>
<LD>   It's a trend rooted less in ideology than in a desire for change.
Voters do not seem to care whether candidates are of the left or
right, but whether they are likely to deliver a better standard of
living.</LD>
<LD>   As a result, they are turning to anti-establishment leftists such
as Ecuador's newly elected president, Col. Lucio Gutierrez, who has
never before held political office, or Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of
Brazil, who spent a lifetime outside mainstream politics as a
committed leftist.</LD>
<TE>   At the same time, they have supported conservatives such as
Colombia's new President Alvaro Uribe, a hard-liner who ran as an
independent, and Mexico's President Vicente Fox, who shattered the
decades-long dominance of the entrenched Institutional Revolutionary
Party.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a discontent that has manifested itself as a desire for
people outside the system," said Pablo Franky, a political analyst at
Javeriana University in Bogota, the Colombian capital. "The
traditional parties have not been able to solve the problems of
poverty, corruption and inequality."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the traditional parties had embraced the so-called
Washington consensus, pursuing open markets and free trade. Few of
the new generation of anti-establishment leaders have rejected
outright the drive toward globalization. But many of them have
expressed the desire to soften its effects on the poor and middle
class.</TE>
<TE>   Politicians of both types have made extravagant populist promises
to put a chicken in every pot. Gutierrez's opponent pledged to build
200,000 homes that could be purchased for $48 a month. Gutierrez
responded by promising 200,000 homes for $37 apiece.</TE>
<TE>   Neither man explained exactly how he would pay for such a program.
Ecuador faces $2 billion in payments on its $13-billion foreign debt
next year, an amount equal to nearly half the country's budget.</TE>
<TE>   It is also unclear whether there is a genuine surge in
anti-American feeling, or whether voters are simply rejecting
discredited U.S.-backed elites and the U.S. prescription for their
economies.</TE>
<TE>   None of the outsiders seems particularly ideological. Uribe,
perhaps the most conservative president in the region, won partly on
his promises to crack down on leftist rebels, but also pledged to
vastly increase the number of schools in the country.</TE>
<TE>   South America's most leftist leader, Venezuelan President Hugo
Chavez, has been careful to maintain close economic ties with the
U.S., his country's largest market. And Lula has promised to honor
Brazil's payments to the International Monetary Fund.</TE>
<TE>   "This turn toward the left in Latin America is very peculiar,"
said Fausto Maso, a radio talk show host in Caracas, the Venezuelan
capital, and columnist for the El Nacional daily. The left "doesn't
have Russia anymore and ... this limits them. During the campaign
they say one thing, but when they get elected they end up talking to
Washington, and later end as failures."</TE>
<TE>   Not all Latin American governments are distancing themselves from
Washington. In Central America, memories of failed ideological
experiments in countries such as Nicaragua have left the region
firmly committed to deeper economic and social integration with the
U.S. Leaders are rushing to take advantage of a possible free trade
agreement with the Bush administration. Recent elections in Honduras
and Nicaragua saw the return of conservative politicians.</TE>
<TE>   In South America, most countries remain committed to the
hemisphere-wide free trade agreement scheduled to be completed by
2004, though Ecuador and Brazil have expressed reservations.</TE>
<TE>   "There is still an enormous push to achieve some kind of more
productive economic relationship with the United States," said Peter
Hakim, president of Inter-American Dialogue, a left-center think tank
in Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   More than anything, the region's continued poverty explains the
rise of unorthodox, outsider and messianic leaders. A recent U.N.
report indicated that after a decade of decline, poverty rates have
begun increasing in some Latin American countries, especially
Argentina.</TE>
<TE>   The region's growing number of poor still face shortages in health
care, education and pensions. Many have seen the success of Asian
competitors, some of which are taking jobs away from South America,
and wonder why they have not benefited from the globalization boom.
Continuing problems with corruption also have left voters
disillusioned.</TE>
<TE>   "What we are seeing is the result of the failure of all the models
that have been tried up to now. All of them -- left and right,
populist and neoliberal -- have failed to deliver the goods," said
Anibal Romero, a political analyst in Caracas. "People in Latin
America are looking for some kind of hope in the future. They want
freedom, prosperity, a better life. If that can be delivered by the
left, very well. If it can be delivered by the right, just as good."</TE>
<TE>   The new leaders are men and women of widely varying ideological
stripe, but most of whom share one characteristic: charisma.</TE>
<TE>   In troubled Paraguay, one of the poorest countries in South
America, politics is dominated by the shadow of a leader who shares
much in common with Venezuela's Chavez and Ecuador's Gutierrez. Like
both those men, Lino Oviedo is a military leader who led a coup
against his country's elected government.</TE>
<TE>   Oviedo now lives in exile in Brazil, where he rails against the
endemic corruption in Paraguay, ruled for decades by the dictator
Alfredo Stroessner and then later by the Colorado Party.</TE>
<TE>   President Luis Gonzalez Macchi declared a state of siege in
September when Oviedo supporters marched in Asuncion, the capital,
demanding the president's resignation. Recent polls have shown that a
third of Paraguayan voters would back an Oviedo presidency, even
though he is barred from running.</TE>
<TE>   "People want a strongman, someone who can provide security and
jobs in the middle of this chaos," said Carlos Martini, a sociologist
and journalist at the Catholic University in Asuncion. "His support
points to a longing for the Stroessner era. For me, Oviedo is just
the symptom of a failed political model."</TE>
<TE>   In Argentina, one of the front-runners in polls leading up to
elections scheduled for early next year is a figure who just months
ago would have been considered a long shot at best.</TE>
<TE>   Adolfo Rodriguez Saa, a Peronist governor, was president for a
week last December following the fall of Fernando de la Rua in a wave
of protests against poverty, budget cuts and the crash of the
nation's banking system.</TE>
<TE>   Elected by Congress as an interim president, Rodriguez Saa
delivered an inauguration speech that was a model of Peronist
populism. Even though Argentina was -- and still is -- nearly
bankrupt, he promised an ambitious government jobs program.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez Saa was driven from office by his fellow Peronists who
would not support his radical prescription for the Argentine economy.
Now he's back, promising to break Argentina's dependency on the
International Monetary Fund.</TE>
<TE>   "These victories are clearly the consequence of an economic model
that isn't working anymore for the people of Latin America," said
Gustavo Valenzuela, a spokesman for Rodriguez Saa, reflecting on the
recent elections in Brazil and Ecuador. "People talk about
globalization and neoliberalism. Whatever you want to call it, it
isn't working."</TE>
<TE>   Venezuela is perhaps the oldest example of the Latin Americans'
experiment with anti-establishment figures -- and the most
disastrous.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez triumphed over corrupt political parties when he ran for
office in 1998 and enjoyed the support of more than 90% of the
population in a poll taken at the beginning of his term.</TE>
<TE>   He moved quickly to realize his ill-defined "Bolivarian"
revolution, an attempt to improve the lives of the country's poor by
rejecting free trade policies. He pushed through laws to require
greater state ownership in oil ventures and to permit the seizure of
privately owned land. Four years later, the economy of the world's
fifth-largest oil producer is worse than ever, with unemployment on
the rise and the national currency falling.</TE>
<TE>   Politically, the outlook is also grim. Chavez was briefly felled
by a coup in April. His return to power has been marked by increasing
bitterness that has left society deeply divided.</TE>
<TE>   Just last week, Chavez seized control of Caracas' police force,
which had been under the control of a political opponent. The move
led to violent protests and a call for the country's fourth
nationwide strike in 12 months.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition leaders are pushing for early elections, perhaps the
clearest sign that Venezuelans care more about results than about
ideology.</TE>
<TE>   "The people will inevitably vote against Chavez. They will vote
for the person who has the best chance of beating Chavez, it's that
simple," said Maso, the radio talk show host. "It doesn't matter what
political tendency the person has."</TE>

<HD>3 Charged in Identity Theft Case</HD>
<DH>Authorities say about 30,000 victims had their private
financial information stolen in the largest such fraud scheme in U.S.
history.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kathy M. Kristof and John J. Goldman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Federal authorities on Monday unveiled charges against three men in
what they said was the largest identity fraud case in U.S. history.</LD>
<LD>   Consumers from across the country -- some 30,000 victims have been
identified so far -- had private financial information stolen by a
ring of thieves that authorities said used pilfered corporate
passwords to electronically access consumer data from all three major
credit reporting bureaus.</LD>
<LD>   For many consumers, the theft was the beginning of a nightmare
that left their bank accounts drained and allowed crooks to run up
thousands of dollars worth of fraudulent charges in the victims'
names, James B. Comey, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New
York, said at a news conference. Losses so far have been estimated at
$2.7 million, authorities said, although that total could rise as the
investigation continues.</LD>
<TE>   The case underscores that identity theft, already considered the
fastest-growing financial crime in the country, has reached epidemic
proportions, said Carl Pergola, national director of fraud
investigation services at BDO Seidman in New York. Roughly 40% of all
consumer complaints logged at the Federal Trade Commission now
involve identity fraud, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "With electronic access to data, and gangs focused on committing
this fraud, it's like giving [thieves] the keys to the vault,"
Pergola said. "Maybe this will press companies to put more controls
in place."</TE>
<TE>   Identity thieves use a consumer's personal and financial
information -- such as birth date, Social Security number and bank
account numbers -- to make fraudulent credit card purchases, open
unauthorized bank accounts and even take out loans in the consumer's
name.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers aren't legally responsible for paying the fraudulent
charges. However, they must prove that the charges were fraudulent,
and in some cases it has taken victims years to have the charges
removed from their credit histories.</TE>
<TE>   In a complaint unsealed Monday, the U.S. attorney's office in
Manhattan charged Philip Cummings, 33, with wire fraud and
conspiracy. In addition, Linus Baptiste, 43, who was arrested in late
October, has been charged with wire fraud in a related case,
authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   They said a third alleged conspirator, Hakeem Mohammed, was
charged with mail fraud last month and has entered a guilty plea in
connection with changing consumer addresses and opening accounts in
the names of two of the victims identified in the scheme.</TE>
<TE>   According to the complaint, the scam started more than two years
ago, when Cummings worked for Teledata Communications Inc., a Long
Island company that provides software and computer services to help
banks and retail establishments access consumer credit reports online
from the three big credit reporting agencies -- Equifax Inc.,
Experian and TransUnion.</TE>
<TE>   In early 2000, Cummings was approached by an unnamed
co-conspirator, who has since agreed to cooperate with authorities,
according to the U.S. attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   The co-conspirator, identified only as "CW" in court documents,
told Cummings that he could get $60 for every credit report he
supplied to a ring of thieves.</TE>
<TE>   Cummings allegedly used his position as a computer help-desk
employee to purloin passwords used by a variety of TCI's customers,
including Ford Motor Credit Co., Washington Mutual Inc. and Community
Bank of Chaska, Minn. With those passwords, Cummings could get credit
reports, listing everything from mortgage information to credit card
numbers and loan payment histories, on thousands of consumers.</TE>
<TE>   The complaint alleges that the theft ring -- a group of at least
20 individuals of Nigerian descent living in Brooklyn and the Bronx
-- provided CW with long lists of names and Social Security numbers
of specific individuals whose credit reports they wanted.</TE>
<TE>   Armed with a laptop computer, Cummings allegedly masqueraded as
one of TCI's corporate clients, pulling dozens of credit reports at a
time, according to the complaint. CW and Cummings then would split
the fees.</TE>
<TE>   "The defendants took advantage of an insider's access to sensitive
information in much the same way that a gang of thieves might get the
combination to a bank vault from an insider," said Kevin P. Donovan,
assistant FBI director in charge of the New York field office.</TE>
<TE>   "But the potential windfall was probably far greater than the
contents of a bank vault, and using 21st century technology, they
didn't even need a getaway car."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said the scam began to unravel earlier this year.
Partly in response to a raft of complaints from consumers who said
they'd been victimized by identity fraud, officials at Ford Motor
Credit began to review bills they had received from Experian for
pulling credit histories of potential car buyers. The Ford Motor
Credit office identified on many of the consumer complaints said it
had never requested the credit reports in question.</TE>
<TE>   Investigating further, Costa Mesa-based Experian discovered that
unauthorized requests for credit reports were being made in large
batches -- dozens per call. It noticed a similar pattern with
requests it was getting from a Washington Mutual branch in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Atlanta-based Equifax had discovered that a Washington
Mutual affiliate in Crossville, Tenn., had been billed for 1,100
credit reports that the company said it had never requested.</TE>
<TE>   In September, Chicago-based TransUnion discovered that a corporate
client was complaining that it had been billed for 4,500 unauthorized
credit reports.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities began tracing the requests through phone records. In
late October, FBI agents arrived at CW's New York address with a
search warrant. Authorities said agents seized a laptop computer with
Cummings' name, lists of consumer names and Social Security numbers,
numerous credit reports and a ledger showing amounts paid -- and owed
-- to CW for the information.</TE>
<TE>   All three credit reporting agencies, and the companies whose
access codes were used in the scam, have been cooperating with
investigators. None of the companies has been implicated in the
scheme, authorities said. TCI, Cummings' former employer, has also
been cooperating with investigators.</TE>
<TE>   Ford Motor Credit, Washington Mutual and the credit reporting
agencies said they already have contacted the consumers identified as
victims in the scam. However, the investigation is continuing.</TE>
<TE>   Comey, the U.S. attorney, urged consumers who think they are
victims of identity fraud to contact the Federal Trade Commission's
identity fraud hotline at 1-877-ID-THEFT.</TE>
<TE>   "Identity theft is an enormous problem in this country, but we've
yet to find something bigger than this in terms of the tens of
thousands of people who were ripped off," Comey said. "We will pursue
and prosecute with equal vigor others who may be involved."</TE>

<KH>Harriet Doerr 1910-2002</KH>
<HD>Novelist Published First of 3 Gem-Like Books at Age 74</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Myrna Oliver</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Harriet Doerr, a late-blooming but highly successful author who
submerged her background as the heiress to a railroad fortune and
based her books on her experiences as a resourceful resident of rural
Mexico, has died. She was 92.</LD>
<LD>   Doerr died Sunday at her home in Pasadena of complications from a
broken hip suffered in a fall last month, said her daughter, Martha
Doerr Toppin of Oakland.</LD>
<LD>   The silver-haired writer, who published her first novel when she
was 74, carefully considered the kaleidoscopic world about her over
several decades, chose a few perfect words to describe her
observations and wrote three slender gems of literature.</LD>
<TE>   Doerr might have written more, but for failing eyesight caused by
glaucoma and the increasing frailties of old age. She envisioned an
autobiography -- staunchly denying that her books had been
autobiographical, as many readers believed -- that would have been
divided into three parts: her early years as wife and mother, her
travel and work with her late husband in Mexico and the writing
years.</TE>
<TE>   "The words are still there and the stories, but the mechanics are
somewhat questionable," she said of her diminished sight in the
summer of 1998 while leading garden architects on a tour of the
spacious grounds of her Pasadena home. She could describe in detail
every rose, citrus tree and clay pot she had collected in her
travels, but she did so, she admitted, from memory.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico and a phrase etched into Doerr's consciousness in the years
she spent there -- "Consider this, Senora" -- were a magic match.</TE>
<TE>   She used the phrase once in her first novel "Stones for Ibarra,"
which won the American Book Award for first fiction in 1984, and made
it the title of her second novel in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Her third book was a collection of essays and short stories, "The
Tiger in the Grass," which was published in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   In explaining the phrase for The Times in 1993, Doerr said: "They
say this when you're having a little discussion -- not angry or
anything. Then you consider it, whatever it is, and out comes some
rather wise philosophy! This is so typical. This is why you fall
deeply in love with the place! Just when you think, catastrophe is
here.... Consider this!"</TE>
<TE>   Doerr grew up with a famous name and a privileged background. She
was the granddaughter of Henry Edwards Huntington, the railroad
tycoon, and played with her siblings at his San Marino estate, which
is now the Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens.</TE>
<TE>   But once married, she dropped her maiden name and forbade fuss
about her heritage.</TE>
<TE>   "Every so often, I'll be introduced by some well-meaning person as
Harriet Huntington Doerr. It makes me want to kill myself and her
[the introducer]," Doerr told The Times in 1998. "What is she really
saying? She is saying that my grandfather had a lot of money and gave
a lot of money to the library. She wants my being related to him to
be more important than the books I've written."</TE>
<TE>   The books, and her college degree -- which were related -- came
late in Doerr's life. She was the third daughter among the four girls
and two boys of Huntington's only son, Howard, and Berkeley piano
teacher Leslie Thayer Green. She was born in Pasadena on April 8,
1910, and grew up in a spacious, shingled house off Oak Knoll Avenue
with a nanny and a tutor, cooks and gardeners.</TE>
<TE>   The family often summered at Lake Tahoe and gathered for holidays
at her uncle's historic ranch in Long Beach, Rancho Los Alamitos,
which is now a park. Harriet and her siblings experienced
Rachmaninoff in the old Philharmonic Hall on Pershing Square and
Houdini at the Orpheum Theater on Broadway, and were always
encouraged to express themselves freely.</TE>
<TE>   Her father died when she was 11, of cancer, which later also
claimed her mother, five siblings, her husband and a son.</TE>
<TE>   She met her husband, Albert Edward Doerr, a Stanford engineering
student from a mining family, at a Christmas party in her parents'
home the winter before she went east to attend Smith College. He sent
her off on the train with a compartment filled with roses.</TE>
<TE>   Homesick throughout her first year in the cold Massachusetts
climate, Harriet transferred to Stanford for the next two years, then
dropped out to marry Doerr on Nov. 15, 1930.</TE>
<TE>   The young Doerrs set up housekeeping in a converted 1810 mill in
the San Gabriel Valley. They had a son, Michael, and a daughter,
Martha, and shuttled between Pasadena and Mexico, where his family
had copper mining interests, from 1935 until Al Doerr's death in
1972.</TE>
<TE>   Only then did Doerr decide to complete her college degree. She
began slowly, with a few classes at nearby Scripps College in
Claremont, and then, in 1975, took the big leap to return to
Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   She majored in history but took a writing course as a lark and
found her metier.</TE>
<TE>   She took additional writing courses on a Wallace Stegner
fellowship.</TE>
<TE>   "I found I'm quite happy working on a sentence for an hour or
more, searching for the right phrase, the right word," she said, long
after earning her American Book Award and a National Endowment for
the Arts grant. "I compare it to the work of a stonecutter --
chipping away at the raw material until it's just right, or as right
as you can get it."</TE>
<TE>   That literary precision both limited her output and garnered
multiple awards -- gold medals and fiction awards from the
Commonwealth Club of California, the Bay Area Book Reviewers Assn.,
PEN Center U.S.A. West and the American Academy and Institute of Arts
and Letters, and the American Book Award for first fiction, all for
"Stones for Ibarra." "Consider This, Senora" was a bestseller, placed
on the Publishers Weekly best books list and winner of the Harold D.
Vursell Memorial Award for quality of prose style from the American
Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters.</TE>
<TE>   Doerr's body of work, perhaps 600 pages total in the three slender
books, has been called lyrical, sweet and spare, conveying in her
precise words her feelings about life, death, love and beauty.</TE>
<TE>   Times reviewer Susan Slocum Hinerfeld called the first book
"something of a miracle as novels go, a real act of creation ... a
work of substance." Jonathan Yardley echoed in the Washington Post
Book World that Doerr "has mastered the art of fiction to a degree
that would be remarkable in almost any writer of any age.... What
really matters is what she has written, and it is very fine indeed."
New York Times critic Anatole Broyard likened Doerr's work to that of
Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Katharine Anne Porter "and even Graham
Greene."</TE>
<TE>   When "Consider This, Senora" was published, Times reviewer Charles
Bowden wrote that it should be savored "like a drink in the evening
before a fine fire." A Publishers Weekly reviewer called the novel
"exquisitely nuanced, elegant and wise." New York Times reviewer
Sandra Scofield said: "The novel captures a time and place as surely
as a jeweler sets a stone."</TE>
<TE>   "The Tiger in the Grass" was published in 1995, the year her son
died of brain and lung cancer. The first essay, the book's title
piece, was her concise memoirs interspersed with italicized comments
about his illness. One entry was: "My son called to say he was dying.
He had fallen down and couldn't get up."</TE>
<TE>   Times reviewer Susan Salter Reynolds praised the book, noting that
it revealed Doerr's "sturdy, good nature, a humble, grateful
temperament." A firm believer that an author's collected experiences
find their way onto the page, Doerr, as a Stanford writing student,
began with pieces about Mexico. Her classmates noticed that she used
the same settings and characters in all her "linked stories" and
suggested that she turn them into a novel.</TE>
<TE>   "Stones for Ibarra," whose protagonist couple experience many
things that Doerr and her husband did in Mexico, including his
struggle with leukemia, was not an easy sell. Publisher after
publisher rejected the manuscript, often writing "We like it, but
what is it?" Then a woman working for Viking chanced to read three
chapters, leading to publication and almost instant success.</TE>
<TE>   When Doerr talked to young writers about precise choice of words
and about turning life experience into fiction, she reminded them
that success is tightly entwined with luck.</TE>
<TE>   Readers and critics alike often saw that Doerr's characters,
albeit with different names, shared experiences, lifestyle and even a
mining management career with Harriet and Al Doerr. No, the author
always insisted, upset when she received phone calls asking if she
were Sara (her first heroine).</TE>
<TE>   "The book is not autobiographical," she told The Times shortly
after "Stones for Ibarra" was published. "None of the dialogue
between the Americans was ever spoken."</TE>
<TE>   "I embroidered a great deal to make 'Ibarra' more interesting. The
truth is either so outlandish or so boring," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite her dignified shyness, Doerr became a popular speaker
among college, book and writing groups.</TE>
<TE>   She always invited questions and one of her favorites, usually
from young career-bent women who had difficulty understanding how she
had devoted 42 years to the sole occupation of housewife, was:</TE>
<TE>   "Were you happy?"</TE>
<TE>   "I never heard," she would respond with a twinkle in her very blue
eyes, "of anyone being happy for 42 years."</TE>
<TE>   Doerr is survived by her daughter.</TE>
<TE>   At Doerr's request, there will be no services.</TE>
<TE>   Her daughter asked that memorial donations be made to La Escuela
Primaria "Leona Vicario" T.V. in Asientos, Mexico c/o P.C. Jordan,
Rio Nazas 118, Colonia Cuauhtemoc, 06500 Mexico D.F.; or to the Old
Mill Foundation, El Molino Viejo, 1120 Old Mill Road, San Marino, CA
91108; or the Los Angeles Philharmonic, 135 N. Grand Ave., Los
Angeles, CA 90012.</TE>

<HD>Homeland Agency Is Big at Birth</HD>
<DH>Bush nominates Ridge to lead the Cabinet department
centered around anti-terrorism. Integrating all of its parts may take
years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Vicki Kemper</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush signed legislation Monday creating the Department of
Homeland Security and nominated former Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge as
its secretary, officially setting in motion the reorganization of the
federal government around an anti-terrorism mission.</LD>
<LD>   Monday's ceremony marked the beginning of what will likely be a
long, messy and contentious process of creating a new bureaucracy of
170,000 employees from a score of separate agencies, many with long
and proud histories.</LD>
<LD>   "It's going to take years to integrate all these different
entities into an efficient and effective organization," said David M.
Walker, head of the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm
of Congress. The top priority, he said, must be "the people
dimension."</LD>
<TE>   And "it's not just about having top-flight leadership," Walker
added. "It's also recognizing that you've got 170,000 dedicated
public servants, and reaching out to them, giving them some identity
that binds them together."</TE>
<TE>   Also evident was the bitter residue of the public battle over
workers' rights in the new department.</TE>
<TE>   T. J. Bonner, president of the National Border Patrol Council, the
union representing the roughly 10,000 federal employees who guard the
nation's borders, predicted that agents would soon leave the agency
in droves.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody wants to work in an environment where you can be fired at
will," he said, adding that labor difficulties could reduce security
at the nation's borders.</TE>
<TE>   "Computers don't catch people. Cameras don't catch people. People
catch people," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The seriousness of the problem has not been lost on
secretary-nominee Ridge, who until now has been director of the White
House Office of Homeland Security.</TE>
<TE>   One of his biggest challenges, he said in an interview Monday, is
to "relieve the anxiety of the many good men and women" who will work
for the new department. "We can't be successful without them."</TE>
<TE>   Ridge said he had already begun reaching out to the federal
employees' unions. He invited leaders of the two largest unions to
the bill-signing ceremony, and they agreed to meet again in a couple
of weeks to discuss how to win over a huge, now somewhat
disempowered, segment of the federal work force.</TE>
<TE>   "At the end of the day, homeland security and job security are
compatible," Ridge said.</TE>
<TE>   The White House on Monday sent Congress an 18-page transition plan
that calls for most of the constituent agencies to join the new
department March 1.</TE>
<TE>   The merger will bring together such diverse agencies as the Coast
Guard and the Secret Service. When the merger of all 22 agencies is
complete -- a process expected to take at least a year -- the
department's 170,000 employees will rank it third in the government,
behind the Defense and Veterans Affairs departments.</TE>
<TE>   "We are taking historic action to defend the United States and
protect our citizens against the dangers of a new era," said Bush,
who was flanked in the White House East Room by several members of
Congress.</TE>
<TE>   The bill-signing signaled an end, at least for now, to a partisan
power struggle between Bush and congressional Democrats. For months,
the president had opposed Democratic efforts to create a
Cabinet-level anti-terrorism agency.</TE>
<TE>   After Bush embraced the idea and offered his own plan, Democrats
resisted -- until their crushing defeat in this month's elections --
his demand for broad powers to hire, fire and relocate the
department's employees. In the end, Bush clearly prevailed.</TE>
<TE>   The reorganization plan sets an ambitious timetable.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 24, the office of the secretary, which includes the deputy
secretary and up to 33 undersecretaries and other top officers, will
be established.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Ridge, whom Bush called "the right man for this new
and great responsibility," the president named two other top
officials Monday.</TE>
<TE>   If confirmed by the Senate, Navy Secretary Gordon England will
become deputy secretary. England, a former vice president of General
Dynamics Corp., brings a strong business background, which many
outside experts have said the new department should have.</TE>
<TE>   Asa Hutchinson, administrator of the Drug Enforcement
Administration and a former Republican congressman from Arkansas, was
Bush's choice for undersecretary for border and transportation
security.</TE>
<TE>   Ridge said the administration was "quite far down the road" in
filling out the remainder of the department's leadership roster.</TE>
<TE>   On March 1, joining the new department will be: the Coast Guard,
the Customs Service, the Transportation Security Administration,
portions of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the Federal
Emergency Management Agency and the Secret Service.</TE>
<TE>   On June 1, the Plum Island Animal Disease Center, located on Long
Island, N.Y., will officially transfer from the Agriculture
Department to Homeland Security.</TE>
<TE>   By Sept. 1, any remaining transfers will be completed.</TE>
<TE>   The department will be divided into four broad divisions.</TE>
<TE>   * The information analysis and infrastructure protection unit will
assess intelligence information from the CIA, FBI and National
Security Agency and work with state and local law enforcement
agencies, as well as private operators of utilities, energy
facilities and other potential targets, to prepare for and respond to
potential attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Although intelligence failures and a lack of communication between
the FBI and CIA preceded the Sept. 11 attacks, those agencies will
not join the new department. Nevertheless, Ridge said he was "very,
very confident" that the information-sharing process had improved.</TE>
<TE>   "I've witnessed and benefited from" information shared by the
intelligence agencies, he said. "There is no doubt in my mind I will
get what I need."</TE>
<TE>   * The border and transportation security division will oversee
immigration processing, container security and traveler safety and
the nation's airports, borders and ports.</TE>
<TE>   * The emergency preparedness and response unit will work with
state and local governments, police and fire departments and
hospitals and other health providers to prepare for attacks involving
nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. This unit, which will
include FEMA, will also coordinate the government's response to such
natural disasters as earthquakes, floods, hurricanes and tornadoes.</TE>
<TE>   * The department's science and technology division will oversee
the development of technologies to detect weapons and of vaccines and
medicines to protect against smallpox and other biological agents.</TE>
<TE>   The Secret Service, now part of the Treasury Department, and the
Coast Guard, now in Transportation, will remain distinct entities
within the new department.</TE>
<TE>   To facilitate the massive reorganization, the Office of Management
and Budget and a transition planning office of about 80 officials
from the various agencies have been working for five months to
coordinate e-mail, technology, financial and personnel systems. They
are also looking for office space for the roughly 10% of the
department's employees who work in the Washington area.</TE>
<TE>   The goal, Ridge said, is to create a department that "on Day One,
you'd have an ability to be a one-stop shop for state and local
governments, to develop intelligence to work with the private sector
to reduce their vulnerability, to direct public dollars to research
that will enhance security."</TE>

<HD>Poor Nations May Compete for U.S. Aid</HD>
<DH>Bush administration proposal would set up a kind of merit
scholarship for the best performers among developing countries.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maura Reynolds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Countries that want a slice of the new $5-billion pie
the Bush administration has set aside for economic development and
alleviating poverty will have to compete for it, U.S. officials
proposed Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The officials, who released the first details of White House plans
to change the way foreign aid is granted to developing countries,
said the program, which requires congressional approval, would be
administered by an independent government "corporation."</LD>
<LD>   "There is no model for what we are about to do," said a senior
administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity.</LD>
<TE>   The new foreign aid program, known as the Millennium Challenge
Account, would be a kind of merit scholarship for the best performers
among developing countries, the officials said. It would not replace
or reduce the current need-based aid that totals $10 billion per year
and is administered largely through the U.S. Agency for International
Development, or USAID, part of the State Department.</TE>
<TE>   Development officials and experts welcomed the proposal, in part
because it represents a 50% increase in U.S. foreign aid, which has
fallen sharply in real terms since the end of the Cold War.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a real big change in the United States' foreign
assistance program, mostly because of the size," said Steven Radelet,
a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development and a former
Treasury Department official.</TE>
<TE>   All the same, the United States will remain the least generous
foreign aid supplier in the industrialized world relative to its
economy: The Millennium Challenge Account will raise the amount of
money the United States spends on foreign aid from 0.1% of gross
domestic product to 0.15%.</TE>
<TE>   "We will still rank No. 22 out of the 22 industrialized counties,"
Radelet said.</TE>
<TE>   As details of the administration's proposal became known,
development experts said they worried that the program could create a
system of winners and losers -- that a select group of 10 to 15
nations might do exceedingly well, but the rest could be left further
behind.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, more traditional development agencies like USAID could
be saddled with only the most problematic countries.</TE>
<TE>   "It means you don't get the neediest people or the poorest
countries," said Carol Graham, a development expert who is director
of the governance studies program at the Brookings Institution. "Who
will be left with the basket cases? AID."</TE>
<TE>   The proposed Millennium Challenge Account follows many years of
conservative criticism of how U.S. foreign aid is allocated and
administered.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration came into office vowing to rethink foreign
aid, an effort boosted by post-Sept. 11 concerns about failed states
in the underdeveloped world.</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, development experts praised the Bush
administration for increasing its commitment to economic development
for the world's poorest countries.</TE>
<TE>   But they asserted that many aspects of the proposal -- including
strict eligibility criteria and accountability mechanisms -- are less
of a break with current practice than the administration suggests.
Such improvements have been introduced in recent years by
international institutions like the World Bank, whose primary mission
is to promote development around the world.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a sincere effort to complement the programs that are
already out there," a World Bank spokesman said on condition he not
be further identified. "Their criteria track pretty closely to what
we are already doing or developing. It doesn't supplant existing
programs."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most unusual aspect of the proposed funding entity is
that it would not be a part of any existing federal department or
agency.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, it would have a board of directors made up of
Cabinet-level officials, chaired by the secretary of State, and would
be run by a CEO nominated by the president and approved by the
Senate, the administration officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Such a structure has no apparent analogue. Government-sponsored
institutions such as Fannie Mae and the Export-Import Bank are
independent, with boards composed in part of private-sector
officials.</TE>
<TE>   But those are loan-making organizations active in the capital
markets. By contrast, the Millennium Challenge Account would make
grants, not loans, and be administered solely by federal officials
despite its corporate structure.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a privatization" of foreign assistance, an
administration official said.</TE>
<TE>   Development experts said that one of the most vexing issues for
the Bush administration was designing a governing structure for the
new program. If it was part of the State Department or other
department, its mission would probably conflict with existing
agencies like USAID. The Bush administration also wanted the new
program to have maximum flexibility in contracting, hiring and
salaries.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, it was decided to make it a corporation independent
of existing departments and agencies.</TE>
<TE>   "It increases flexibility," said Graham of Brookings. "There's
also a risk that it reduces accountability."</TE>

<HD>Slain Militant Linked to Al Qaeda</HD>
<DH>Yemeni native killed in September was a top operative in
Bin Laden's group, Algeria says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>ALGIERS</DL>
<LD>An Islamic militant killed by Algerian security forces in a raid more
than two months ago has been identified as a top Al Qaeda operative
in Africa, Algeria's official news agency reported Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Emad Abdelwahid Ahmed Alwan, sometimes known as Abu Mohammed, was
shot and killed in a Sept. 12 raid in the Batna region, about 200
miles east of Algiers, the APS news agency reported.</LD>
<LD>   Ahmed Alwan, a 37-year-old native of Yemen, was identified after a
two-month investigation by government experts, the report said. He
was a leader of Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist network for
northern and western Africa, it said.</LD>
<TE>   A U.S. official in Washington said there was no independent
confirmation that Ahmed Alwan was dead. "If it's true, the world is a
safer place. He is a significant figure [in Al Qaeda] but is not at
the very top," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   APS said Ahmed Alwan was instrumental in helping settle Al Qaeda
fighters from Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia in Yemen
after they lost their bases in Afghanistan following the demise of
Taliban rule in that Central Asian nation last year.</TE>
<TE>   In Algeria, he worked with the Salafist Group for Call and Combat,
an organization suspected of links to Bin Laden, APS said. The rebel
group is one of two leading guerrilla factions fighting the Algerian
government.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile in France, police arrested six suspected Islamic
radicals on Monday as part of a crackdown on networks recruiting for
extremist groups.</TE>
<TE>   A judicial source said the arrests in a northern Paris suburb were
part of a probe into networks that may have sent Muslim youths for
military training in Afghanistan before the Taliban regime was
overthrown.</TE>
<TE>   Police arrested five other suspects Friday and Saturday on charges
of providing false passports and money to Islamic activists. The
source said they belonged to a different network.</TE>
<TE>   One of the men arrested over the weekend was an Algerian, Redouane
Daoud, who escaped from a Dutch prison in June, the source said.</TE>
<TE>   The daily Le Monde said Daoud, 25, was thought to be the head of
the Al Qaeda network in the Netherlands.</TE>
<TE>   The paper said police think he might be linked to a group that
provided passports to two Arab journalists who killed Afghan
commander Ahmed Shah Masoud, the famed leader of anti-Taliban forces,
last year.</TE>

<LD>Up to 15,000 people are sleeping outdoors in bitterly cold conditions
in Pakistan's mountainous northeast, as aftershocks have spread fear
after a major earthquake that killed about two dozen people last
week.</LD>
<LD>   Residents fear their fragile houses may collapse, officials said.
More than 100 aftershocks have rocked the mountainous region since
Thursday's temblor.</LD>
<LD>   Army helicopters were delivering relief goods, but the terrain
made the task dangerous. Authorities have provided 700 tents as well
as blankets and warm clothes but 2,000 more tents are needed,
officials said.</LD>

<HD>Massive Water Project to Begin</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>China has approved a multibillion-dollar project to pump water from
its verdant south to the arid north in a plan that would be China's
largest water diversion effort.</LD>
<LD>   State media quoted Water Resources Vice Minister Zhang Jiyao today
saying that construction was ready to begin and that an initial
segment could be finished by 2005.</LD>
<LD>   "The south-to-north water diversion project is a mega-project that
is strategically aimed at realizing the optimal allocation of water
resources," Zhang was quoted saying in the English-language China
Daily.</LD>
<TE>   The project aims to relieve growing demand for water in Beijing
and other key northern cities that are home to about half of China's
population and important grain growing and industrial regions.</TE>
<TE>   An idea credited to communist China's founder Mao Tse-tung, the
plan would build three massive north-south aqueducts to pump water
from the Yangtze, the world's third-longest river. Together, the
three channels would pump 48 billion tons of water a year -- enough
to fill New York City's taps for a quarter century.</TE>
<TE>   In the first phase, Yangtze water will be pumped to parched
Shandong province by 2005, the official New China News Agency said.
Yangtze water will reach Beijing by 2010, it said.</TE>
<TE>   The scale of the project has raised questions about possible
negative effects on the environment, as well as the economic strain
it will place on China's developing economy. The total expenditure
could exceed that of the Three Gorges Dam, which is expected to cost
$24 billion.</TE>

<HD>Haider Will Stay in Politics</HD>
<DH>A poor showing by his far-right party in Austria's
elections initially led him to quit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>VIENNA</DL>
<LD>Joerg Haider, leader of Austria's far right, announced early today
that he will stay in politics, just hours after declaring that he was
calling it quits because of his Freedom Party's disastrous showing in
Sunday's general elections.</LD>
<LD>   Haider, whose praise of Adolf Hitler and anti-foreigner rhetoric
helped propel his party into national government two years ago, said
he was persuaded to stay on as governor of Carinthia after a six-hour
meeting with political colleagues.</LD>
<LD>   "I accept personally much of the responsibility for the bad
results," he told the Austria Press Agency. "Thus a resignation would
have been the logical consequence. But my party friends did not
accept this because they believe my 'Carinthian way' is good and I
should continue."</LD>
<TE>   Haider's decision was the latest example of a "withdrawal from a
withdrawal" that critics cite as an example of why he cannot be taken
seriously. The move was likely to further alienate swing voters who
abandoned his party in Sunday's elections.</TE>
<TE>   Though Haider stepped down in 2000 as the Freedom Party's official
leader, he has continued to wield influence.</TE>
<TE>   His previous threats to quit politics were made to pressure
opponents in his party to accept his views. But his declaration
Monday that he was quitting had been taken more seriously.</TE>
<TE>   Weakened by infighting, the party lost nearly two-thirds of its
previous support Sunday, winning only 10% of the vote.</TE>
<TE>   Disaffected swing voters powered the conservative People's Party
-- the Freedom Party's government coalition partners -- to more than
42%, its best showing since the mid-1960s. The Social Democrats also
gained, getting just under 37%.</TE>

<HD>Afghan Lovers So Close, Yet So Far Apart</HD>
<DH>Dating is difficult. One pair watched each other a year,
then declared their devotion. As often happens, her parents saw
things differently.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Dixon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>KABUL, Afghanistan -- All that Mohammed Abrahim has left of his
long-loved sweetheart is a crackly old tape of her voice, a
photograph and a couple of her handkerchiefs to soak up his tears.</LD>
<LD>   He lives on the third floor in the Qasaba area, on the edge of
Kabul. Nazifa lived on the first floor -- until her father sent her
far away last month to cure a forbidden virus called love.</LD>
<LD>   His mother tried to negotiate the couple's marriage, but Nazifa's
parents arranged for her to wed someone else. That engagement was
broken because Nazifa, who like many Afghans goes by one name, is in
love with Abrahim. Still, her father has declared that the lovers
will never marry.</LD>
<TE>   Abrahim's hope is not completely dead. But as he sits with head
bowed, shyly murmuring the story of his love, tears slip down his
cheeks.</TE>
<TE>   After the strict Islamic Taliban movement was driven from power
last year, Kabul, the Afghan capital, seemed poised for a more
liberal era when young men and women could mix more freely together.
The ban on girls and women attending schools was lifted, and arrests
of unrelated couples simply for walking or talking together in public
eased.</TE>
<TE>   But the tradition of arranged marriages quickly snapped back into
place. Private meetings between young men and women are still
forbidden in Afghan society. Couples who elope can be arrested and
jailed. And marriage for love remains rare.</TE>
<TE>   Lovers who defy the social rules and meet in secret risk
heartbreak when their parents marry them off to someone else.</TE>
<TE>   Love in Afghanistan can also be a dangerous business. Farid
Kharote, 23, also of Qasaba, had a girlfriend who was engaged by her
parents to another man. One evening last month, Kharote hurried to
her apartment for a secret assignation. A dozen men ambushed him and
beat him savagely. He was hospitalized for three days, after which
his love was diluted by a strong sense of self-preservation. He fled
the country.</TE>
<TE>   Abrahim and Nazifa, both about 20, met on the stairs of their
apartment block five years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "She told me she'd been watching me for a whole year," Abrahim
said. "I was shaking and sweating. I told her, 'I love you too.' "</TE>
<TE>   For five years, he followed her with his eyes whenever she
hurried, head down in her burka, across the stony ground near their
block. He had no difficulty distinguishing her from other girls
shrouded in the head-to-toe garment.</TE>
<TE>   "She is polite. Her eyes are almond-shaped and black," he said.
"She is very small. She's beautiful."</TE>
<TE>   Her former fiance lives in Iran. When Nazifa and Abrahim kept
seeing each other after her engagement, neighbors talked.</TE>
<TE>   The couple would meet on the stairs; there was nowhere else to go.
There they quickly kissed, the moment all the more piquant because of
their terror they would be caught.</TE>
<TE>   "I was afraid that if someone knew about our love and saw us
kissing, maybe they would tell her father or brother or the man she
was engaged to and maybe they would try to kill me or her," Abrahim
said.</TE>
<TE>   Alarmed about the gossip, the groom's family requested a special
ceremony this summer called neka -- which is as binding as a wedding,
though the groom is absent. A huge dagger was placed beside Nazifa to
symbolize the man. His family planned to move her to their house to
live and work.</TE>
<TE>   Abrahim awoke that day in a dark mood. "I thought, 'I can't get
her. And if I can't get her, I don't need my life.' "</TE>
<TE>   But the next day, moping on the stairs near her door, he saw
engagement presents being returned from Nazifa's family to her
fiance's family.</TE>
<TE>   Later he learned of Nazifa's courage. With a mullah and 100
relatives present for the ceremony, she was supposed to repeat
solemnly three times that she loved her fiance. She said nothing. The
mullah declared that the wedding could not go ahead, and the party
ended in recriminations.</TE>
<TE>   From then on the lovers would sit on their balconies each night
for hours, he looking down at her, she gazing back. They invented a
complex system of gestures to convey their thoughts.</TE>
<TE>   But that was in September, before her father sent her away to the
distant city of Kandahar in southern Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Their love is full of sorrow and pain. But for many young Kabul
residents, love in this post-Taliban time is more of an exquisite
game. Some young men and women ring phone numbers randomly for hours
each day, then engage in long, giggly phone conversations when they
find a willing partner.</TE>
<TE>   One handsome 18-year-old, Fahim, who asked that his second name be
withheld to avoid damaging his chances of marrying the young woman he
loves, sat in a house in Kabul, phone-flirting with a girl named
Maryam, who was so paralyzed with shy laughter it was difficult to
get much sense out of her.</TE>
<TE>   He was trying to set up a meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "When I meet her, I'll continue my friendship -- if she's
beautiful. If not, I'll just cut it," he said after hanging up, the
meeting not quite arranged.</TE>
<TE>   First meetings are usually fleeting. The scene might be an ice
cream shop. He'll recognize her from some item of clothing. If she is
wearing a burka, she'll lift the garment's face panel briefly so they
can exchange glances.</TE>
<TE>   "The first time she doesn't come up close. She just says hi, and
that's it. It takes five or six minutes just to see each other.
Later, if I want to meet her, I can go to our shop, which has a room
at the back and a sofa," Fahim said. Couples use the back rooms in
shops for talking, kissing and cuddling.</TE>
<TE>   After the phone call, Fahim and a male friend prowled the
neighborhood looking for girls to follow and flirt with -- called
"street teasing."</TE>
<TE>   "It's no fun," said a 17-year-old high school student also named
Maryam, complaining of the flirtatious remarks young men make in the
street.</TE>
<TE>   "It happens whenever we go to the city and there are some boys on
the way and they tease us. They'll normally follow me for an hour."</TE>
<TE>   Mina Osmani, 16, a butcher's daughter who wants to be a
journalist, is a brave, perky girl who talks to boys on the phone in
her spare time.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you want to meet tomorrow at 12?" a boy asked her over the
speaker phone.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," she said, but added, "I am scared. Should I tell a lie to
my father?"</TE>
<TE>   "Tell him I'm your classmate," advised the boy.</TE>
<TE>   Most young men have one ideal girl who fits their model of
perfection, the one they hope to marry -- usually a relative. Fahim
said his cousins -- one of whom he might marry -- and his sisters are
extremely virtuous, and very different from his girlfriends. His
sisters and cousins would never go out walking and meeting boys, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Brows furrow deep when you ask an Afghan man what he would do if
he found out his sister had a boyfriend. It is an unthinkable
question.</TE>
<TE>   In the Taliban era, it was dangerous for lovers to meet, but not
impossible. There were private rooms in restaurants where they could
go, at the risk of a Taliban raid. A rendezvous could be arranged in
the back rooms of shops or at a family house left vacant for a few
days.</TE>
<TE>   Young lovers who were stopped and questioned by the religious
police would claim to be siblings or spouses. The police would
separate them and order each to list all the other person's
relatives. So the first thing new lovers did was memorize a long list
of relations.</TE>
<TE>   After the Taliban fell, there were more opportunities for boys and
girls to meet and talk, on the way to school or in classrooms. The
area where girls congregate in front of Kabul University was
optimistically dubbed the "Park of Love," though it is rather
unapproachable for boys.</TE>
<TE>   But security police still stop couples driving in cars or seen
together in quiet streets and question them.</TE>
<TE>   Soldiers patrol some campuses and ensure that girls and boys don't
meet there out of classrooms.</TE>
<TE>   "The boys are hanging around, mooning after the girls," said
Marina, 23, who is studying to be a teacher. "But now the soldiers
won't let the girls leave the faculty building. You can't walk with
boys in the university.</TE>
<TE>   "If there are boys and girls sitting together and studying, it's
not a problem. But if they're walking somewhere or sightseeing or
they're laughing together, then the police can arrest them," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   One boy who came to meet a girl at university reportedly was
beaten by soldiers, shoved into a car and driven away.</TE>
<TE>   After Nazifa's engagement was broken, she became damaged goods in
the eyes of potential suitors. Abrahim, who is poor and unemployed,
sent his mother to propose again, but Nazifa's father asked for $400
as the "bride price" -- the money paid by a suitor to a woman's
family. When a generous friend came up with the money, the father
doubled the price.</TE>
<TE>   For Abrahim, love is a thread of torture and wild hope that runs
crookedly through his life. However much he puzzles over his love,
there is no solution unless Nazifa's father relents. Meanwhile, there
is the threat that her family will marry her to someone in Kandahar,
where the bride price is high.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel depressed. I feel exhausted," Abrahim said. "I think:
What's wrong with me? Why don't I have money? Why don't I have
power?"</TE>

<HD>Mexico Rebel Tears Into Spain's Leaders</HD>
<DH>Paper publishes note to a supporter in which the Zapatista
leader calls the premier 'an imbecile.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>A newspaper published a dispatch from reclusive Zapatista rebel
leader Subcommander Marcos, a letter laced with scatological humor
and insults for major Spanish political figures.</LD>
<LD>   Marcos called Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon "a grotesque clown"
and labeled Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar "an imbecile" in
a letter dated Oct. 12 and published by La Jornada.</LD>
<LD>   Garzon -- who has led efforts to bring former dictators including
Chile's Augusto Pinochet to trial for past crimes -- apparently
earned Marcos' wrath for his participation in a crackdown on Basque
separatists, whom the Spanish government blames for terror attacks.</LD>
<TE>   The letter was apparently written to a Spanish supporter of the
Zapatista rebels, a group that staged a brief armed uprising in the
southern Mexican state of Chiapas in 1994, demanding greater Indian
rights.</TE>
<TE>   Marcos' letters are normally marked by their joking tone, but this
one descended into bathroom humor.</TE>
<TE>   It also included some poetry about a revolutionary butterfly --
"The butterfly says NO! No to logic, No to prudence ... " -- and
political commentary, directed at Mexican President Vicente Fox: The
Zapatistas "are not being silent, the thing is that you are not
listening to them."</TE>
<TE>   Another letter from Marcos was published earlier this month.</TE>
<TE>   Marcos and most of the rest of the Zapatistas largely have
remained quiet since the rebel group staged a tour from the jungles
of Chiapas to the streets of Mexico City in the name of Indian rights
in March 2001.</TE>

<HD>Palestinian Boy Dies in Encounter With Soldiers</HD>
<DH>The Israeli army says troops fired to disperse youths
throwing rocks and explosives in Nablus. The military backs off in
Bethlehem.</DH>

<DL>NABLUS, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Israeli troops shot and killed an 8-year-old Palestinian boy in
Nablus on Monday as hundreds of youths on their way home from school
threw stones at soldiers, said witnesses and hospital officials.</LD>
<LD>   The children had gathered in the center of the city, hurling
stones at an army jeep, witnesses said. Soldiers opened fire, killing
the boy, Jihad Faqeh, hospital officials said. Seven other
Palestinians were wounded, including two adults who were reported to
be in serious condition.</LD>
<LD>   The army said troops fired to disperse stone-throwers, and that
two explosive devices were thrown toward soldiers.</LD>
<TE>   Israeli troops have been patrolling Nablus, the West Bank's
largest city, since June, keeping more than 200,000 residents under
curfew for much of the time. Israel says Nablus is a stronghold of
Palestinian militants and that its military presence there is
necessary to prevent attacks on Israeli civilians.</TE>
<TE>   The army said Monday that it prevented a suicide attack Saturday
when troops arrested two Hamas bombers near Nablus. Computers packed
with explosives were found in the taxi the two were riding in, the
army said. The computers were detonated in a controlled explosion.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere in the West Bank, the army pulled its troops out of the
center of Bethlehem, and Palestinian residents ventured out of their
homes for the first time since last week.</TE>
<TE>   But the army said there was no formal withdrawal, and soldiers and
their armored vehicles remained nearby.</TE>
<TE>   The army said it had arrested 40 Palestinians, including five
would-be suicide bombers, in Bethlehem in the last three days and 11
suspects elsewhere in the West Bank on Monday.</TE>

<HD>Putin Criticizes Coverage but Vetoes Legislation Limiting
Press</HD>
<DH>Reportage during hostage crisis spurred bill, which Kremlin
probably helped pass.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Dixon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>Russian President Vladimir V. Putin, under fire over restrictions on
media freedom, sharply criticized some reporting on Moscow's recent
hostage crisis Monday but vetoed legislation that would have further
limited news coverage.</LD>
<LD>   His move appeared to be an effort to stop a hail of criticism, not
only from human rights organizations that defend media freedom, but
also from pro-Kremlin media chiefs.</LD>
<LD>   Although Putin vetoed the legislation, it is unlikely it could
have even passed both houses of parliament without initial support
from the Kremlin. Putin's move suggested that he had decided the
controversy was hurting him politically more than new legislation
would help him.</LD>
<TE>   The new regulations would have banned the airing of terrorists'
statements and outlawed reporting on technology, weapons, ammunition
or explosives used in anti-terrorist operations. They were introduced
in parliament after last month's crisis, in which Chechen rebels
seized more than 700 hostages at a Moscow theater. The hostages were
rescued by special police, but 129 of them died, most from the
effects of a gas used to incapacitate the rebels.</TE>
<TE>   Putin's veto followed an incident earlier this month in Brussels
in which he attacked radical Islam and a journalist who questioned
Russia's policy on Chechnya.</TE>
<TE>   Putin on Monday called in representatives of the major Russian
media outlets, from the most loyal to the most critical, to announce
the veto.</TE>
<TE>   He then launched a thinly veiled attack on NTV, a media group
controlled by the state-dominated Gazprom company. During the hostage
crisis, NTV aired a program showing hostages' relatives pleading for
an end to the Chechen war and footage of special forces moving in to
storm the theater.</TE>
<TE>   NTV has denied accusations that it aired the storming footage
live. But in his comments Putin accused a station, which he did not
name, of going after ratings and profits.</TE>
<TE>   "Minutes before the storming, one of the television stations
showed the movement of special police squads, which could have led to
terrible tragedy," he said. "It was not a mistake on the part of
individual journalists. It was an attempt to push up ratings and
capitalization and to make money."</TE>
<TE>   NTV has been under intense Kremlin pressure since the hostage
crisis. But last week, President Bush gave an exclusive interview in
Washington to Savik Shuster, the NTV anchorman whose program aired
the comments of distraught relatives during the crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Political analyst Pavel I. Voshchanov, a columnist at the daily
Tribuna, said the Kremlin had made it clear to leaders in the Russian
parliament that the media had stepped out of line during the hostage
crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "The legislators, like good restaurant waiters, rushed to fulfill
the highest order and did it in record-breaking time, overdoing the
thing quite a bit and making the Kremlin look even worse, until the
president personally interfered and publicly saved the Russian mass
media from his own hook," Voshchanov said. "The whole thing was a
pretty blunt and obvious operetta farce directed by the Kremlin."</TE>
<TE>   Putin's tactic was the kind used by authoritarian regimes,
Voshchanov said.</TE>
<TE>   "This latest PR action with the mass media law reminds me of some
weird mixture of Stalinism, Brezhnevism and the apogee of the Yeltsin
rule, when Boris Yeltsin could afford to say anything he wanted and
then would turn it upside down to make him look like a really
democratic and wise father of his people."</TE>

<HD>German Leader Gets a Thumping as Anti-Tax Tune Tops the
Charts</HD>
<DH>The song skewers Schroeder as a con artist with his hands
on the worker's wallet.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeffrey Fleishman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>BERLIN -- It's a fast little ditty at the top of the German pop
charts. It's not about love. It's not even about lost love. It's
about one of the least favorite people in the nation today,
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, who just two months ago promised so
much to get reelected.</LD>
<LD>   Using a syncopated rap beat, "The Tax Song" skewers the chancellor
as a sneaky flimflam artist with his hands on the worker's wallet.
"Promises that were made yesterday can be broken today," sings
satirist Elmar Brandt, mimicking Schroeder's gravelly baritone. "I'll
raise your taxes, I'll empty your pockets. Every one of you bums
stashes some cash away, but I'll find it no matter where it is ....
I'll get your piggy bank."</LD>
<LD>   The scathing lyrics have struck a chord in a nation whose soul and
economy are under siege.</LD>
<TE>   "What can you do?" said Mario Altermann, a $5-an-hour construction
laborer with dust in his beard. "The small guy never has a chance.
The worker pays the bill. They should cut the incomes of those fat
government deputies .... There's nothing I like about Schroeder. That
song captures how we feel."</TE>
<TE>   Even by the standards of their somber country, locked now in the
fog and drizzle of autumn, Germans are a gloomy lot. Unemployment is
nearly 10%. Budget deficits balloon weekly. Unions are threatening
strikes. There are proposals to raise taxes on everything from
heating oil to stock portfolios. The other day the government floated
the ideas of forcing workers to contribute more to pension funds and
of lifting the tax on false teeth from 7% to 16%.</TE>
<TE>   The economic crisis is forcing Germany to confront years of
expensive social policies and the continuing heavy costs of absorbing
the eastern regions. There's even talk that the German welfare state
-- the European epitome of cradle-to-grave coddling -- will have to
get more miserly. Schroeder and his economic experts, known as the
"five wise men," were supposed to fix it all, but whenever Finance
Minister Hans Eichel appears on TV, the news is bad and the solutions
painful.</TE>
<TE>   The German psyche is bewildered. The world's third-largest
economy, Germany two years ago was the financial engine of the
continent, before Europe began merging its currencies under the euro.
Germans despaired over giving up their beloved deutschemark and
complained about entering a union with such economic laggards as
Italy and France. Today, Germany is the sick one. Its projected
economic growth is 0.2% this year and its budget deficit of about $35
billion puts it in violation of European Union standards.</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder evaded detailed plans on taxes and economic reforms
during the campaign. Many of those who voted for him now say the
chancellor pulled a fast one. But economists and others contend that
Schroeder has few options, especially with consumers spending less
and seemingly endless reports on bankrupt companies crowding the
business pages.</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder's approval rating has slid to 34%. He attempted to
project confidence when he recently announced a package of economic
reforms during a news conference. His usually jovial bantering with
reporters was not in evidence when someone asked the chancellor if he
had heard "The Tax Song," which also has a video that depicts a safe
falling from the sky and squashing a caricature of a cigar-smoking
Schroeder.</TE>
<TE>   The chancellor snapped: "I don't intend to comment on this.... I
wish we'd have more unemotional debates in this political fight" to
solve the country's problems.</TE>
<TE>   That's not an easy task when newspaper headlines read: "Taxman
Ambushes Santa Claus."</TE>
<TE>   For many Germans, "The Tax Song" is a jangling interlude to soften
the pain. Moving between a rap riff and fast guitars and drums, the
song reached No. 1 on the charts earlier this month, selling more
copies than Madonna and Ozzy Osbourne.</TE>
<TE>   Taking a break from repairing elevators in office buildings, Andre
Peters said higher taxes will sting. But he added that for decades
the German government has lacked the will to reform the economy and
reduce the strain of Europe's most generous welfare state. Even
Schroeder's prescription of tax hikes is considered by many
economists to lack the fundamental change needed to free industry
from the grip of social programs and powerful unions.</TE>
<TE>   "Germans must understand they must cut down on things," said
Peters, sipping coffee in a small diner under a train trestle. "It's
too expensive, and we can't afford it anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Around the corner, not far away, Dieter Krause-Pitrowski pushed a
shopping cart in a discount grocery. He's a disabled construction
worker. He's not in favor of reducing the welfare state, but he sure
was mad at Schroeder, the man he voted for in September.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel betrayed," Krause-Pitrowski said. "Everybody is mad. But
no one does anything. There'll be no revolution."</TE>
<TE>   "The Tax Song" says the chancellor will enact a "dog tax, tobacco
tax, car and environmental tax." One line pokes fun at what has
become a lingering German question: Does Schroeder color his hair?</TE>
<TE>   "Why not have a tax for bad weather? That would bring a lot of
money," sings Brandt, sounding just like the chancellor. "Or a tax
for dying your hair, er, no, better not."</TE>

<HD>Report: Ukraine Help to Iraq Likely</HD>
<DH>Team of U.S. and British investigators says there's a
'credible possibility' that defense systems went through an
intermediary.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>KIEV, Ukraine</DL>
<LD>U.S. and British investigators said Monday that there is a "credible
possibility" that Ukraine sent sophisticated radar systems to Iraq
through an intermediary.</LD>
<LD>   The team of 13 U.S. and British experts spent a week in Ukraine
last month investigating whether the country sent any Kolchuga radar
systems to Baghdad in violation of U.N. sanctions. Their findings,
compiled in a 16-page report, were released by the U.S. Embassy in
the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, on Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The investigation came after the State Department said it had
verified the authenticity of a July 2000 recording in which President
Leonid D. Kuchma is apparently heard approving the sale of four
Kolchuga systems to Iraq for $100 million in discussions with Valery
Malev, then head of the state-owned arms sales company.</LD>
<TE>   Kuchma has strongly denied the allegations. Ukrainian officials
were not available for comment late Monday.</TE>
<TE>   In their report, the investigators said they had been unable to
prove that Ukraine transferred radar systems to Iraq "under openly
declared contracts," but said that "covert or illegal arms transfers,
particularly with the complicity of third parties, remain a credible
possibility."</TE>
<TE>   The investigators, who weren't further identified by the embassy,
said Ukraine had provided documentation on 72 Kolchuga systems but
that four remain unaccounted for. Ukraine says it sold the four
systems to China but refused investigators access to the contracts,
saying they were commercial secrets.</TE>
<TE>   The investigators said Ukrainian officials refused to give them
complete reports of their own internal investigations into the matter
and said some officials had refused to answer key questions,
especially concerning the role of the country's leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Ukrainian officials told investigators they could not interview
two key individuals -- Leonid Derkach, former chief of the State
Security Service, and Yuri Orshansky, Ukraine's former honorary
consul to Iraq -- because they were not in the country, the report
said.</TE>
<TE>   The investigators were suspicious of a visit by an Iraqi
delegation in June to the city of Donetsk, where the Kolchuga factory
is located, partly because Ukrainian officials denied it took place,
the report said. The ostensible purpose of the visit was to discuss
oil and gas cooperation between the two countries, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   The report concludes that Ukraine's export controls "lack
sufficient safeguards to prevent senior officials or entities from
misusing state organs or bypassing the system."</TE>
<TE>   The radar allegations have soured Ukraine's relations with the
U.S. and Europe. Washington suspended $54 million in aid to the
government last month as part of a policy review and threatened more
sanctions in the future.</TE>
<TE>   Kuchma was pointedly not invited to last week's NATO meeting in
Prague, Czech Republic, and was given a seat far from President Bush
and British Prime Minister Tony Blair when he showed up anyway.</TE>

<LD>Two prominent Eastside officials Monday jointly condemned recent
attack mailers sent to voters in the 14th Council District, and vowed
to pull their endorsements of the candidates running to represent the
area if they participate in negative politics.</LD>
<LD>   In a morning news conference in Hollenbeck Park, County Supervisor
Gloria Molina, who is supporting former Assembly Speaker Antonio
Villaraigosa for the seat, and Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Los Angeles),
who is backing incumbent Councilman Nick Pacheco, both expressed
strong disapproval of mailers sent by a Pacheco friend lambasting
Villaraigosa for having white advisors and children out of wedlock.</LD>
<LD>   "Personal attacks have no place in campaigns," Becerra said.
"Indeed, they are corrosive, divisive and distract from a real
dialogue about the issues."</LD>
<TE>   Added Molina: "Neither one of us wants to be part of a campaign
that is going to bring shame to this council district."</TE>
<TE>   Pacheco has denied involvement in the attack mailers, and said he
asked his longtime friend Ricardo A. Torres II to halt the mailings.
Two weeks ago, after pressure from other officials such as Los
Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca, Torres relented. But he hinted that
he may renew his attacks at some point.</TE>
<TE>   This weekend, Villaraigosa sent his own four-page mailer to 14th
District voters blaming Pacheco's "operatives" for the "repulsive"
attack campaign. The councilman "has no right to divide our community
by race for any reason," Villaraigosa wrote.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Molina and Becerra both called Villaraigosa's response
inappropriate, and said they hoped it would be the last volley hurled
in what has already become an exceedingly nasty fight.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope with this, this is the end of this kind of
back-and-forth," the supervisor said. "This is exactly what we don't
want to see going on in this campaign."</TE>
<TE>   Villaraigosa defended his mailer, saying that it simply showcased
newspaper articles and editorials about Torres' attacks. His campaign
manager Steve Barkan said the mailers were distributed to households
that they believe received the Torres fliers.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought it was important to set the record straight and also
show Pacheco that we will defend ourselves," Barkan said.</TE>
<TE>   The former Assembly leader said he plans to live up to the
standards set by Becerra and Molina.</TE>
<TE>   "I have always run a clean, positive campaign, and I will continue
to do so," Villaraigosa said.</TE>
<TE>   But Pacheco called Villaraigosa's mailer a "personal attack" laced
with "innuendo."</TE>
<TE>   "I think ultimately each campaign is going to be held responsible
for the quality and tenor the campaign takes," the councilman said,
adding that he also plans to run a positive campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Molina and Becerra's united front comes a year and a half after
they were embroiled in their own campaign controversy. In 2001,
Becerra's mayoral campaign launched an anonymous attack phone call in
which a woman impersonated Molina and accused then-mayoral candidate
Villaraigosa of being soft on child molesters and rapists. The
congressman denied any knowledge of the call, but the incident soured
his relationship with the longtime county supervisor.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, however, both officials were congenial as they agreed
to hold their respective candidates accountable until the March
election.</TE>
<TE>   "If in fact we can't get our candidates to honor this request to
speak directly to the issues, then I think my endorsement would be in
jeopardy," Molina said.</TE>
<TE>   The congressman agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "Our names are behind them, and we wish to see that our names
don't get sullied, along with anyone else," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But it remains unclear whether attacks made by others on behalf of
either candidate would prompt the officials to yank their backing. In
the case of the Torres mailers, for example, Becerra said he is
convinced Pacheco was not involved. Other groups such as labor and
Indian gambling interests are expected to get involved in the closely
watched council race.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we're going to have a tough time trying to figure out if
they violate it, as to how we'll hold them accountable," Molina
acknowledged.</TE>

<HD>Chief Talks, Listens in South L.A.</HD>
<DH>Several hundred turn out and emotions run high in an area
plagued by violence. Bratton says police need to win the community's
trust.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Megan Garvey and Daniel Hernandez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Police Chief William J. Bratton went to South Los Angeles
on Monday with a message for residents who have seen more than 20
killings this month.</LD>
<LD>   "We do not want to come in as an invading army, a platoon of
strangers," he told several hundred people gathered to question the
new chief at First AME Baptist Church. "We want to come in with
authorization. We want to come in respectfully."</LD>
<LD>   In emotional -- and occasionally hostile -- meetings at two
churches in one of the city's most troubled areas, Bratton heard
demands for more police coverage set off against reminders of the
historic tensions between Los Angeles' black community and its
police. Shortly after his first appearance ended, the latest shooting
-- an apparent drive-by about two miles from where Bratton spoke --
left one man wounded, police said.</LD>
<TE>   Many of the South Los Angeles residents who came to meet the chief
said their nerves have been frayed by the wave of killings in their
community, where the city has seen nearly half of the more than 600
homicides so far this year.</TE>
<TE>   "I offer this challenge to you and to Mayor Hahn" said Qmii
Jackson, who waited in line for nearly an hour to question Bratton at
the day's first meeting at Mount Moriah Baptist Church. "Do whatever
you would do to stop this war if it was your neighborhood. Do
whatever you would do if you lived here."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson could barely speak through her sobs. For the first time in
her life, she told Bratton, she was too frightened to leave her
South-Central home last weekend when she needed medicine for her
6-month-old son.</TE>
<TE>   Her words contrasted with those of a man wearing a bright red
T-shirt with the word "POLICE" crossed through on the front and "We
ain't guilty" on the back. He ended his wait in line by yelling at
Bratton:</TE>
<TE>   "You declare war on graffiti artists. You declare war on gangs,
all of them kids. And now we have 20 dead and you instigated the pigs
killing us. I see through you. You are sucker."</TE>
<TE>   The man then stormed out of the church before Bratton could
answer.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard their anger. I heard their anguish," Bratton said of his
questioners. "I heard their recommendations."</TE>
<TE>   The problem the city faces is "a lack of respect of human life"
Bratton said.</TE>
<TE>   During the appearances, Bratton rejected the idea of flooding
South Los Angeles streets with officers. Doing so would probably
raise the ire of a community with a long history of confrontation
with police rather than solve any problems.</TE>
<TE>   "The easiest thing is to go in and arrest everyone in sight," he
said to the several hundred people at Mount Moriah. "But you cannot
arrest your way out of this problem. We aren't going to come in and
throw every black kid up against a wall.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to find a way in this city to regain trust," he told the
group, which included many local ministers. "We need to find a way to
heal wounds between the police and the community."</TE>
<TE>   His eyes are open to the department's shortcomings, Bratton added.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some who are corrupt, who are uncaring, who are racist
and they should not be there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "But the vast, vast, vast majority are caring and courageous, and
I need the community to understand that."</TE>
<TE>   Challenged by one man to replace his call last week for the city
to "get angry" with words of reconciliation, Bratton refused to back
down.</TE>
<TE>   "We need both, sir," said Bratton, who told those gathered that
their neighborhoods had seen "more than their fair share" of
violence.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton deflected a number of suggestions offered by community
members.</TE>
<TE>   He told one woman a curfew for minors would be impossible to
enforce with the current 9,000-member police force.</TE>
<TE>   In one heated exchange, Bratton tried to explain why the tactics
used last week in two sweeps of downtown's skid row are not the way
to combat South L.A.'s killings.</TE>
<TE>   "We were specifically targeting parole violators who prey on some
of the city's homeless, some of the people least equipped to protect
themselves," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "But they weren't killing anybody," shouted Diane Jones from a
back pew.</TE>
<TE>   "I beg to differ," Bratton responded from the lectern. "We had a
murder there last week."</TE>
<TE>   "We had 20 in South-Central," said Jones, who had told the chief
earlier that she had to crawl to safety last week when one of the
volunteers at her organization, Pathway to Progress on South
Broadway, was shot four times.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton again asked for community help in instilling values in
children before they became involved in gangs. And he reminded people
that much of the violence in the city was carried out by non-gang
members against members of their own families.</TE>
<TE>   "The community listens to you. God listens to you," Bratton told
the ministers at Mount Moriah. "I need your individual and collective
voice on this issue of mindless violence."</TE>
<TE>   When he was named chief by Mayor James K. Hahn, Bratton told The
Times that he wanted to establish close ties with prominent leaders
in the city's minority communities. In doing so, he said, he would be
better able to keep local leaders informed of police action and
reduce the likelihood of communities' exploding in anger.</TE>
<TE>   His meetings Monday, arranged through Councilman Nate Holden and
Urban League President John Mack, mark the start of what Bratton says
will be his continuing presence in South Los Angeles neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   Mack said Monday evening that he gave Bratton credit for reaching
out to the community, but took note of a remark the chief made last
week and urged him to apply the same standard to the department.</TE>
<TE>   "My caution to him is that in urging parents to control their own
kids, he heed his own advice and control his rank and file," Mack
said.</TE>

<HD>Borrowing Urged for New LAPD Center</HD>
<DH>Council's top advisor suggests using general fund as
backing for $150 million in loans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick McGreevy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amid new reports of health problems at Parker Center, the Los Angeles
City Council's top advisor recommended Monday that the city replace
the Police Department's aging headquarters.</LD>
<LD>   Chief Legislative Analyst Ron Deaton suggested that the best way
to construct a new building is to borrow $150 million against the
city general fund, rather than to ask voters to approve bonds and a
tax increase.</LD>
<LD>   Deaton made his recommendation to the City Council as the Los
Angeles Police Department issued a report stating that, since 1999,
nine employees have filed workers' compensation claims about
respiratory and skin-rash problems allegedly caused by the building's
old heating, ventilation and air-conditioning system.</LD>
<TE>   Parts of the ventilation systems are disintegrating, "resulting in
the discharge of large amounts of material from the registers,"
former Acting Police Chief Martin Pomeroy said in a report released
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is serious enough that city officials have drafted a
$12-million plan to replace the heating and air-conditioning systems,
and another $12-million plan to bring the eight-story building up to
fire and life-safety codes.</TE>
<TE>   Deaton told council members at a hearing Monday, however, that a
1996 report by consultant Larry Kosmont had recommended that the
building be replaced rather than renovated.</TE>
<TE>   The council's Information Technology and General Services
Committee asked Monday for a briefing on the health issues and agreed
to form a working group to complete the plan for a new headquarters
building.</TE>
<TE>   The group also will explore leasing office space for police
operations during the construction period.</TE>
<TE>   In proposing a new police headquarters to a City Council panel
Monday, Deaton cited the Kosmont study, which detailed the structural
problems with Parker Center.</TE>
<TE>   The consultant's report said the building had a "noticeable lean"
from earthquake damage or foundation settling, and, among other
things, needed a new roof, better plumbing and asbestos removal.</TE>
<TE>   The building was given a yellow tag designation after the 1994
Northridge earthquake, meaning it had been damaged but could remain
open during repairs.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD officials said the quake repairs did not involve major
structural improvements necessary to bring the building up to current
fire and safety codes.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Dennis Zine, a member of the committee, said he was
particularly concerned that the building has been cited by the Fire
Department and the federal Occupational Safety and Health
Administration for safety violations.</TE>
<TE>   The building, which opened in 1955, lacks visual and audio alarm
and fire sprinkler systems required by city fire codes for high-rise
structures, LAPD officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Deaton, one of the most influential administrators at City Hall,
made his recommendation a day before a real estate firm is scheduled
to issue a report stating that it makes financial sense to move
employees out of Parker Center into leased space until a new building
can be constructed.</TE>
<TE>   Police Commission President Rick Caruso said the report by CB
Richard Ellis will state that the cost of operating Parker Center is
so high and office rents downtown so low that the move could be done
for a nominal additional cost that would be offset by safety concerns
for police employees.</TE>
<TE>   "They have concluded it is absolutely practical and feasible, and
in my mind it should have been done long ago," Caruso said, adding
that he was waiting for the real estate firm to quantify the nominal
cost.</TE>
<TE>   Caruso said the real estate report could clear the way to begin
moving people out of Parker Center in 60 to 90 days, but council
members voiced concern Monday that the issue needs to go through a
review process before any move is scheduled.</TE>
<TE>   The council committee asked that the working group report back
with an action plan in January.</TE>
<TE>   With voters having rejected a 1999 bond measure that would have
funded a new police headquarters, Deaton said the council should
consider borrowing the $150 million needed for the project and paying
it off with existing general funds.</TE>
<TE>   The city long ago created a Municipal Improvement Corp. of Los
Angeles with powers to issue tax-exempt certificates of
participation, which are like bonds to provide long-term financing.</TE>
<TE>   Deaton estimated that such a funding scheme would require $15
million annually from the city general fund, with an additional $5
million per year to lease space in private buildings for Parker
Center operations until the new building is constructed.</TE>
<TE>   The lease issue sparked some tension Monday. Councilman Mark
Ridley-Thomas said the city already had contracted with a real estate
consultant to handle leasing issues, so Caruso's use of CB Richard
Ellis is problematic.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Gunn, the Police Commission's executive director, told the
council panel that CB Richard Ellis is working pro bono, and had been
brought in so the commission could be part of the decision-making
process.</TE>
<TE>   He conceded that the council, not the commission, has authority to
approve leases and construction projects.</TE>
<TE>   Deaton said he thought the Police Commission brought in the real
estate firm "to provide extra heat" to get the council moving more
quickly.</TE>

<HD>2 Ex-Priests Charged in L.A. Molestations</HD>
<DH>One of them has served time in prison. They are the fourth
and fifth former priests to be charged by county prosecutors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Winton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two former priests, including one who was already imprisoned for
child molestation, have been charged with sexually assaulting minors
in Los Angeles, authorities said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   John Anthony Salazar, believed to be at large in Canada, was
charged with sexually assaulting a male student at St. Bernard High
School and an altar boy at St. Teresita Church in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Salazar was convicted of molesting children in 1988 and served
nearly three years of a six-year prison sentence. While on parole, he
was hired by the Diocese of Amarillo, Texas, where he worked for 11
years.</LD>
<TE>   Matthew Michael Sprouffske, 75, was arrested at his home in
Darien, Ill., on Monday afternoon and was being held in lieu of
$200,000 bail. He was charged with four felonies, committing lewd
acts with minors under the age of 14.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles said
the church had been advised of the allegations against Sprouffske,
who was removed from the priesthood in April.</TE>
<TE>   The spokesman said the church was unaware of the new allegations
against Salazar.</TE>
<TE>   They are the fourth and fifth former priests to be charged in Los
Angeles County Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley's investigation of criminal
misconduct in the Roman Catholic priesthood.</TE>
<TE>   Sprouffske was charged with crimes allegedly committed in 1955 and
1959. Salazar was charged with crimes allegedly committed from 1980
to 1983.</TE>
<TE>   Sprouffske allegedly molested a female relative in the 1950s when
he was assigned to Mt. Carmel High School in Los Angeles, said Deputy
Dist. Atty. William Hodgman, who heads the Sex Crimes Unit.</TE>
<TE>   "What this priest did warrants prosecution. This is not the oldest
case we are prosecuting," Hodgman said.</TE>
<TE>   Salazar, who resigned from the priesthood in May, was serving at a
parish in the Diocese of Amarillo. He faces up to six years in
prison.</TE>
<TE>   He was sentenced in 1987 to six years in prison for molesting two
altar boys at St. Lucy's Catholic Church in East Los Angeles. He
plead guilty to two felony counts.</TE>
<TE>   He was convicted of molesting the boys, ages 13 and 14, when he
invited them to spend nights at his living quarters on the church
grounds.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, he was teaching at the Santa Teresita School in
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   After serving time in prison, Salazar was allowed to return to the
active ministry by a bishop in Amarillo. He was hired directly from a
treatment program for sexual abusers in New Mexico, where he was
paroled.</TE>
<TE>   He was last assigned to the Church of Holy Spirit in Tulia near
Amarillo.</TE>
<TE>   Hodgman said Texas authorities were helping to track Salazar. Law
enforcement sources said Monday they believe that Salazar may have
gone to Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Sprouffske was a member of the Carmelite order. Salazar was a
Piarist priest. Neither order returned calls for comment Monday.</TE>
<TE>   J. Michael Hennigan, attorney for the Archdiocese of Los Angeles,
said the archdiocese was informed in April of Sprouffske's removal
from the active priesthood.</TE>
<TE>   The Carmelite order informed Los Angeles Archdiocese officials
that a previously reviewed and resolved allegation had been
reexamined, Hennigan said.</TE>
<TE>   The alleged victim, police said, contacted Napa police earlier
this year, and the matter was referred to the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office has already charged two former
priests and one retired priest with multiple counts of child
molestation.</TE>
<TE>   All are awaiting preliminary hearings, where a judge will
determine if there is enough evidence to order them to stand trial.</TE>
<TE>   Former priest Michael Stephen Baker, 54, of Long Beach is charged
with molesting a boy repeatedly from 1976 to 1981. Former priest
Carlos Rodriguez, 37, of Commerce is charged with molesting an altar
boy in the mid-1980s. Retired priest G. Neville Rucker, 82, of Los
Angeles is accused of molesting 10 girls over a nearly 30-year period
dating to 1946.</TE>
<TE>   All three have pleaded not guilty.</TE>
<TE>   Police agencies across the Los Angeles Archdiocese, which includes

<HD>82 Rampart Cases Rejected for Lack of Evidence, Other
Problems</HD>
<DH>D.A. says many would depend on the testimony of Perez and
Durden, who aren't credible.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Scott Glover</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley announced Monday that
dozens of cases against officers implicated in the LAPD's Rampart
Division scandal would not result in criminal prosecution.</LD>
<LD>   Cooley said he made the decision based on his review of 82
Rampart-related cases that detectives submitted to prosecutors.</LD>
<LD>   The district attorney's office decided to not prosecute the cases
because of insufficient evidence and because the statute of
limitations had expired. Further, many of the cases involved the two
main players in the scandal -- Rafael Perez and Nino Durden -- who
had entered into plea bargains that protect them from further
prosecution.</LD>
<TE>   The documents released by the district attorney's office Monday,
known to prosecutors as "rejects" or declination memos, offer a
detailed analysis of the 82 cases that prosecutors reviewed.</TE>
<TE>   Most of them dealt with incidents in which Perez and/or Durden
were either the alleged perpetrators of the crimes or witnesses to
crimes allegedly committed by other officers. The alleged crimes
included planting evidence, assault and providing false information
in police reports.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutor Curt Hazell, who supervised the review, said that
Perez, as a convicted drug thief and liar, was essentially useless as
a witness, regardless of whether one believes him.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem you have is not whether he made [Rampart] up; it's
whether you can use him as a witness," Hazell said. "Why should
anybody believe him beyond a reasonable doubt."</TE>
<TE>   The review did not include some of the most serious allegations to
come out of the scandal: three allegedly unjustified shootings that
police officials failed to thoroughly investigate, and that
prosecutors said were not submitted to their office.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley said he was informed by high-ranking Police Department
officials that those cases remain under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "We have their assurances that they will be presented in due
course," Cooley said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, federal investigators are continuing their probe of the
Rampart scandal, said Thom Mrozek, a spokesman for the U.S.
attorney's office in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Mitzi Grasso, president of the Los Angeles Police Protective
League, called the district attorney's decision "a refreshing turn of
events."</TE>
<TE>   "I think that's an indicator that there was not widespread
corruption, as many people had feared," Grasso said.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Gigi Gordon, who represents indigent clients potentially
caught up in the scandal, said she found the report "amateurish and
not surprising."</TE>
<TE>   She said she believes the Police Department stopped investigating
the scandal prematurely and did not inform the district attorney's
office. "If they can't even figure out that the LAPD had turned off
the tap on them, why would it be surprising that they're not filing
any cases," Gordon said.</TE>
<TE>   The scandal was launched in September 1999 when Perez, charged
with stealing cocaine from department evidence lockers, made a deal
with authorities in which he agreed to reveal police misconduct in
exchange for a lighter sentence on the drug charge. He went on to
describe an out-of-control anti-gang unit in which officers allegedly
beat suspects, stole drugs, planted evidence and covered up
unjustified shootings.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Perez and Durden, both of whom are serving time in
federal prison, seven current and former officers were charged with
crimes as a result of Perez's allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Three were convicted of conspiring to obstruct justice, but their
convictions were overturned by the judge in the case. That outcome
has been appealed by the district attorney's office. One officer was
acquitted in that case and has returned to work.</TE>
<TE>   In another case, one officer is awaiting trial on charges that he
beat a suspect. Two other officers in that case have pleaded no
contest, one to a charge of assault, the other to filing a false
police report.</TE>
<TE>   The scandal has taken a toll in other ways: More than two dozen
officers resigned or were fired; more than 100 criminal prosecutions
were overturned because prosecutors lacked confidence in their police
witnesses; and the city anticipates spending $100 million to settle
Rampart-related civil lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   The documents released by the district attorney's office failed to
reach any broad conclusions. In a telephone interview Monday, Cooley
suggested that there had been an effort to answer some fundamental
questions.</TE>
<TE>   He referred to his request that the Los Angeles County Civil Grand
Jury conduct an investigation to determine whether there "was a
failure of leadership, oversight, management and supervision
necessary at the highest levels within the LAPD to control Rampart
Crash officers."</TE>
<TE>   A draft of the grand jury's finding was prepared, but never
released.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very, very disappointed that that report was never released
by the grand jury ... that that part of the reform effort never
played out," Cooley said.</TE>
<TE>   In making his announcement, Cooley cited some changes he has
instituted in his office to guard against corruption.</TE>
<TE>   They include revamping the unit responsible for prosecuting
crooked police officers and establishing new guidelines for giving
defense attorneys information that may reflect on the credibility of
officers testifying in criminal prosecutions.</TE>
<TE>   "Rampart showed us that there are some bad law enforcement
officers who themselves became the gangsters they were supposed to be
policing," the district attorney's report stated. "Rampart also
showed us that these bad law enforcement officers must be detected
early on, investigated thoroughly and prosecuted vigorously when
there is sufficient evidence that they have committed crimes."</TE>

<HD>Baja City Can't Skirt This Issue</HD>
<DH>Tecate's ban on male cross-dressing gets a mixed response.
One result has been a surge in gay pride.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anna Gorman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>TECATE, Mexico</DL>
<LD>This city may be minutes from cosmopolitan San Diego and just over
the Mexican border, yet life moves as slowly as a colonial village
and residents hold tight to their traditions.</LD>
<LD>   The town's central square fills each afternoon with young couples
holding hands, old friends playing dominoes and farmers in cowboy
hats lounging on park benches.</LD>
<LD>   Just off the square, however, Saidi's Salon breaks with both
history and tradition. Inside on a recent day, Ruben Obregon chatted
with customers, his tight brown blouse fitted at the waist and his
jeans laced up to the knees. Jose Alberto Villagomez -- black locks
in a shoulder-length bob and red shirt coming only to his belly --
trimmed and styled a longtime customer's hair.</LD>
<TE>   But now Tecate's city council has approved an ordinance that could
make the way Obregon and Villagomez dress a crime. The one-sentence
law, approved last month, translates: "Men dressed like women in
public who are disturbing the peace can be cited for a lack of
morals."</TE>
<TE>   The ordinance is designed to reassert the city's traditional
values, protect children and, according to its authors, curtail the
sort of promiscuous lifestyle that they worry could contribute to the
spread of AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, men who had felt a measure of acceptance and some
comfort in this conservative town say they feel threatened. Under the
law, they can be arrested, fined $50 and jailed for two days -- as
they see it, simply for being who they are.</TE>
<TE>   Activists throughout the region have attacked the ordinance as not
only vague -- failing to specify what constitutes cross-dressing --
but grossly unfair in suggesting that men who dress in untraditional
ways are a social and public health threat.</TE>
<TE>   City officials say police officers will make the judgment calls
required by the ordinance: Do painted nails, pierced ears and makeup
constitute "dressing like a woman," or do only a dress or skirt
justify an arrest? And what is necessary to show that peace has been
disturbed?</TE>
<TE>   At least one city councilman believes cross-dressers should be
arrested if they are kissing in public or talking to young people
"inappropriately" -- for example, standing too close to them.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates for the cross-dressers -- including gay community
leaders on both sides of the border -- say the law has had a silver
lining, bringing attention to their issues as never before.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty years ago, most cross-dressers rarely left their houses for
fear of being beaten up or harassed, said Saidi Garcia, owner of the
hair salon. But this month, they were able to dress in drag and march
peacefully through town, even drawing vocal support for their cause.</TE>
<TE>   "We are in our element now," he said. "We are not so repressed.
The culture is more open and we are more united."</TE>
<TE>   The controversy in Tecate started this spring, when Mayor Juan
Vargas heard from a local doctor that one cross-dressing man
reportedly tested positive for HIV. Vargas and the city council
drafted the new ordinance, which passed, 9 to 2, with one abstention.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want AIDS in Tecate," said councilman Cosme Cazares
Burgueno. "The government has an obligation to protect its people.
That's the reason we have to take these measures."</TE>
<TE>   Cazares said that he doesn't have anything against gays and that
the ordinance could be used to cite others, including men who
disguise themselves as women to commit robberies.</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Sonia Chavez Aguilar said the ordinance should help
cut down on gay street prostitution and remove a bad influence for
children. "That's not what I'd like my kids to see," Chavez said.
"It's immoral."</TE>
<TE>   Chavez said she would also like to make gays take regular blood
tests and carry health cards.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Jose Carlos Perez Perpuly tried to convince his
colleagues that Mexican law does not let local governments infringe
on the right of free expression. He called "absurd" the argument that
the ordinance will cut the spread of AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   "The resolution doesn't achieve anything," he said, shaking his
head. "It doesn't solve the public health problem. We can't repress a
group of citizens that is part of our town. We have the
responsibility to secure the rights of all citizens."</TE>
<TE>   The local chapter of the state human rights office opposes the
ordinance and plans to challenge it in court as unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   Tecate's gay activists say their community includes perhaps 30
cross-dressers, but midriff tops and brightly painted nails are a
glaring contrast with the routine attire of most men: worn jeans and
work boots.</TE>
<TE>   Hairstylist Villagomez said city leaders are using AIDS and public
health as a pretext to apply the ordinance.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a homophobic law from the last century," said Villagomez,
a 26-year-old man who plucks his eyebrows and wears earrings and,
occasionally, women's clothes.</TE>
<TE>   To fight against the ordinance, Obregon and several friends formed
the Rainbow Gay Pride Group, which now has a membership of about 40.
They delivered a petition to City Hall and twice in two weeks staged
protest marches unlike anything ever seen in the rural town.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of men wearing tight skirts and high-heeled boots paraded
through town during the most recent rally this month. Among the 200
marchers were residents of Tijuana, Mexicali and San Diego, city
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The new ordinance has divided this city of about 80,000, which is
surrounded by vineyards and olive orchards and is perhaps best known
for the beer that bears its name.</TE>
<TE>   Beatriz Lopez, a waitress at Cafe Los Pinos in the main square,
said she thinks the law and a new curfew for youths are making Tecate
a better place to live and visit.</TE>
<TE>   Antonio Carrillo, 74, however, looked up from a game of dominoes
to say that the law is crazy and that men should be allowed to dress
as they wish.</TE>
<TE>   For Obregon, 38, there have always been stares and occasional name
calling about his appearance. But in the last few weeks he has been
arrested three times. The first time, he paid a $20 fine and was
released. He said officials from the city's human rights office
helped free him after the other arrests.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, Obregon went on a local radio program to raise
awareness about the dispute and to say that more should be done to
educate the public about HIV and AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   Tecate's gays say they know it won't be easy to get the town
leaders to reverse their decision, but that they will keep fighting.</TE>
<TE>   "We are in a macho culture," Obregon said. "We have advanced, but
very little. We knew, with a march, we weren't going to win the
battle. We have to keep fighting."</TE>

County edition, two photo captions accompanying a story about a law
against cross-dressing in Tecate, Mexico, misidentified the subjects.
A blond man identified as Jose Alberto Villagomez should have been
identified as Saidi Garcia, owner of Saidi's Salon. A man with long

<HD>Condors Inoculated for West Nile Virus</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Kelly</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wildlife officials have launched an intensive effort to vaccinate
California condors against the West Nile virus, which has killed
thousands of birds on the East Coast and could possibly decimate the
vulnerable condor population as the virus heads west.</LD>
<LD>   "So far we have had only isolated incidents on the West Coast, but
this has the potential to be extraordinarily scary, especially with
only 205 birds," said Bruce Palmer, coordinator of the California
Condor Recovery Program for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. "We
can't take any chances."</LD>
<LD>   The mosquito-borne virus has so far killed 4,133 wild or captive
birds. Penguins, flamingos, eagles, hawks, owls, crows and waterfowl
are especially vulnerable, officials said.</LD>
<TE>   In response, the Los Angeles Zoo has already inoculated 10 of its
32 California condors. The San Diego Zoo is vaccinating its condors.
So far, the birds are standing up well to the injections with no side
effects reported.</TE>
<TE>   "We are focusing on the captive birds first because they are the
reproductive ones," said Cynthia Stringfield, an L.A. Zoo
veterinarian. "By early spring, we hope to vaccinate all the wild
birds."</TE>
<TE>   The experimental vaccine uses the DNA of the West Nile virus
rather than a live or dead virus. This is supposed to reduce the
chance of a condor getting sick or actually contracting the disease
through the process. But giving shots to captive birds is one thing;
doing it in the wild is something else. Condors live in remote
stretches of the Grand Canyon, Big Sur and Los Padres National Forest
near Fillmore. They are monitored by satellite transmitters fastened
to their bodies. Tracking, trapping and vaccinating them will require
a major effort.</TE>
<TE>   "We will certainly give this our best shot. We have 21 birds out
there," said Greg Austin, a director with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service at Hopper Mountain National Wildlife Refuge in Los Padres
National Forest. "The first 15 might be easy, and the last six could
take six months."</TE>

<HD>Former Georgia State Senator's Parole Revoked</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>The state of Georgia on Monday revoked the parole of former state
Sen. Ralph David Abernathy III after finding him guilty of taking
fees to represent inmates.</LD>
<LD>   The decision means Abernathy, son of the late U.S. civil rights
activist Ralph David Abernathy Sr., must return to prison, where he
could remain until January 2004.</LD>
<LD>   The Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles said it found that
Abernathy had violated his parole by breaking a state law prohibiting
anyone other than a licensed attorney from soliciting money to
represent prisoners at parole hearings.</LD>
<TE>   Parole board spokeswoman Heather Hedrick said the parole
revocation followed a hearing last week at which witnesses testified
that Abernathy collected $35,000 from two women on a promise that he
could convince board members to release their relatives.</TE>
<TE>   She also said the evidence included taped phone conversations of
Abernathy.</TE>
<TE>   The board acquitted Abernathy of four charges of theft by
deception, Hedrick said.</TE>
<TE>   Abernathy, who has been held in Atlanta's Fulton County Jail since
September, had denied he broke the law. His lawyer, Steve Strelzik,

<HD>Judge Orders Boston Church to Release Files on Priests</HD>
<DH>Documents must be turned over to those alleging
molestations. Lawyer suing archdiocese calls ruling a 'huge victory.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Mehren</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>In a pointed rebuke to Catholic Church officials here, a judge Monday
ordered the Boston archdiocese to release 11,000 previously
classified documents pertaining to 65 priests charged with molesting
children over a 30-year period.</LD>
<LD>   A separate ruling Monday by Judge Constance Sweeney requires the
archdiocese to turn over psychiatric records of a priest linked to
the case of retired priest Paul Shanley, whose trial on multiple
counts of child rape is set to begin early next year.</LD>
<LD>   Roderick MacLeish Jr., a lawyer for dozens of alleged clerical
abuse victims, hailed the decisions as "a huge victory for us, the
most significant rulings that have been handed down in any church
abuse case in Massachusetts in terms of potential liability for the
archdiocese and for Cardinal Bernard Law."</LD>
<TE>   Yielding to an earlier court order, the archdiocese delivered the
documents late Friday to lawyers for the alleged victims.</TE>
<TE>   A request from church lawyers that the documents be sealed from
public view until at least January brought sharp criticism from
Sweeney.</TE>
<TE>   "While the defendants have seemingly produced the documents to
opposing counsel at the last minute and under a warning of sanctions
and contempt, they still resist public disclosure of those
documents," the judge said.</TE>
<TE>   "If the tone of this endorsement is harsh," she continued, "so be
it. The court simply will not be toyed with."</TE>
<TE>   Donna M. Morrissey, a spokeswoman for the archdiocese, did not
return a call Monday for a comment on the latest turn in a scandal
that has churned in Boston and across the nation for close to a year.</TE>
<TE>   But MacLeish, in an interview late Monday, said Sweeney's action
contained language to support the contention of alleged victims that
the archdiocese routinely made administrative decisions in favor of
priests rather than protecting the children.</TE>
<TE>   'Big Setback'</TE>
<TE>   The disputed records, Sweeney wrote, "raise significant questions
of whether the archdiocese was really exercising the care [toward
children] they claimed to use in assigning offending priests."</TE>
<TE>   MacLeish and other lawyers had sought the documents on behalf of a
client who says he was repeatedly raped by Shanley.</TE>
<TE>   Despite accusations of sexual abuse against Shanley, a letter from
the Boston archdiocese recommended him as a priest "in good standing"
when Shanley transferred to Southern California in the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Dubbing Monday's rulings "a big setback to the archdiocese,"
MacLeish said he expected to make the documents public as early as
next week.</TE>
<TE>   He also said that he will seek review of the documents by members
of SNAP, the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests.</TE>
<TE>   In ordering the church to turn over the psychiatric records of
Father Paul Lane, Sweeney also faulted the archdiocese for permitting
Lane to celebrate Mass after church psychiatric evaluations showed
that he had a history of molesting boys.</TE>
<TE>   Sweeney's rulings came as more than two dozen lawyers representing
hundreds of alleged victims met here Monday. Archdiocese spokeswoman
Morrissey said the meeting was designed to "set structure to the
lawsuits in our desire to work toward a settlement in a fair and
equitable manner."</TE>
<TE>   After defaulting on a tentative agreement worth up to $30 million,
the archdiocese in September reached a $10-million settlement with 86
alleged victims of former priest John J. Geoghan.</TE>

<HD>Costs to Reenlist Troops Soar, Audit Finds</HD>
<DH>Military is criticized for mismanaging bonus program for
soldiers with special skills.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A military program that encourages soldiers with special skills to
reenlist has more than tripled in cost and gone far over budget,
congressional auditors said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The cost of the Selective Re-Enlistment Bonus program has soared
over five years -- to $789 million this year from $235 million in
1997 -- in part because the services aren't sticking to their own
guidelines, the General Accounting Office said.</LD>
<LD>   In response, the Defense Department said the increases followed
years when the Pentagon was intentionally cutting jobs and reducing
spending on bonuses. The increases reflect the difficulty of
retaining skilled workers in the strong economy of the late 1990s.
The department also rejected the GAO's claim that it is not
adequately overseeing the program.</LD>
<TE>   Congress created the program in 1974 to help the Defense
Department retain soldiers in specialized areas, such as medical
professionals or air traffic controllers. The bonuses are based on
the specialty, the soldier's monthly pay and years of experience.
They range from a few thousand dollars to $60,000.</TE>
<TE>   Almost 59,000 service members received the bonus in 2001, the last
year for which figures were available. That compared with 23,000 in
1997.</TE>
<TE>   The GAO report said the Navy and Air Force failed to use their own
criteria for bonuses, and have increased the number of specialties
that qualified for bonuses. The Army had no specific criteria. The
Marine Corps generally followed its criteria, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the Army, Navy and Air Force didn't stay within their
budgets, spending $240 million more than Congress had appropriated
from 1997 to 2001, the GAO said.</TE>
<TE>   In the Pentagon's response, Charles Abell, assistant secretary of
Defense for force management policy, said the increased spending
isn't surprising considering that spending on the bonuses fell 40%
from 1990 to 1998.</TE>

<HD>Court Fight Erupts Over Bid to Put Jury Talks on Camera</HD>
<DH>A Texas judge wants 'Frontline' to tape deliberations in a
death penalty trial. Prosecutors are opposed to the idea.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lianne Hart</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>It is an unprecedented courtroom experiment that can be seen as
either an exercise in public service television or an invasion of
juror privacy: A Texas judge wants to let filmmakers videotape
deliberations in a death penalty case here.</LD>
<LD>   Harris County prosecutors are having none of it, objecting to
state District Judge Ted Poe's decision to allow cameras from PBS'
"Frontline" to roll as jurors consider the fate of 17-year-old Cedric
Harrison, accused of fatally shooting a man during a carjacking in
June.</LD>
<LD>   Late Monday, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals intervened,
giving Poe until next week to explain why scenes from the jury room
-- a chamber closed by tradition, not Texas law -- should be part of
next year's TV lineup.</LD>
<TE>   "He thought our criminal justice system benefited from people
seeing how it works," said Chip Babcock, who is representing Poe
before the criminal appeals court. "Jurors will be wrestling with
literally a life-and-death issue.... It will be extraordinarily
interesting to see."</TE>
<TE>   Harrison supports the idea, and his defense attorneys said the
filming could help guarantee a fair trial.</TE>
<TE>   But prosecutors argue that cameras will discourage juror candor
during the give-and-take of deliberations. "We don't try these cases
for the spectacle or for people's entertainment," Harris County Dist.
Atty. Chuck Rosenthal has said.</TE>
<TE>   Under Poe's plan, an unobtrusive remote camera would be installed
in the ceiling of the jury room. Videotape would be reviewed and kept
by the court until the trial is over.</TE>
<TE>   Potential jurors who object to the cameras would not have to serve
-- but that in itself is problematic, said Neil C. McCabe, a
professor at the South Texas College of Law in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   "The mere fact that a person doesn't like the idea of engaging in
a media experiment that the judge set up is not a reason to kick the
person off the jury," McCabe said. "Jurors should not be dismissed
because they don't want to play his game."</TE>
<TE>   Still, if prosecutors present a strong case, cameras won't change
the trial outcome, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We hand out death penalties like party favors here," said McCabe,
referring to Houston's reputation for sending more prisoners to death
row than any other city in the country.</TE>
<TE>   "If this is something that cries out for the death penalty anyway,
you can expect the jury to give it."</TE>
<TE>   Poe, a former prosecutor with 21 years on the bench, is well-known
here for his quirky -- and sometimes controversial -- rulings.</TE>
<TE>   He has ordered several convicts to wear signs proclaiming their
crime. Two men found guilty of spousal abuse had to apologize in
front of the Family Law Center downtown as their wives watched and a
crowd gathered.</TE>
<TE>   Poe's latest experiment could be viewed as "no more than the
people's right to be informed," said T. Gerald Treece, another
professor at the South Texas College of Law. "One could argue that
the educational value outweighs potential problems.</TE>
<TE>   "But with jury deliberation, you go through this terrible ordeal,
and come out with justice because people are willing to hang in there
with what they believe in."</TE>
<TE>   Treece worries that some jurors may sit quietly "for fear of being
embarrassed in front of the cameras." Then there are the showboating
jurors, "people wanting to be on juries so their little sermonettes
can be recorded for posterity. Whether they grandstand or feel
inhibited," Treece said, "there are two extremes -- and both of them
are bad."</TE>

<HD>Ex-FBI Agent Acquitted of Vehicular Homicide</HD>
<DH>He is convicted of misdemeanor charges in the interstate
collision that killed two brothers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>A former FBI agent was acquitted by a Florida jury Monday of
manslaughter and vehicular homicide in a 1999 highway crash that
killed two brothers, but was found guilty of lesser misdemeanor
charges.</LD>
<LD>   A state court jury in Fort Lauderdale found David Farrall, 39, not
guilty of the more serious charges in the deaths of brothers Maurice
Williams, 23, and Craig Chambers, 19. But it found him guilty of
driving under the influence and reckless driving.</LD>
<LD>   Farrall would have faced a maximum of 30 years in prison if
convicted on the manslaughter and homicide charges.</LD>
<TE>   Farrall's Honda collided with the brothers' Kia on Interstate 95
shortly after midnight on Nov. 23, 1999. Williams, a youth minister,
was driving Chambers home from church choir practice. Neither had
alcohol in his system, trial evidence showed.</TE>
<TE>   Farrall, who was then an FBI agent, was driving home from a tavern
where he had been watching a football game with his supervisor and
had a blood-alcohol level of 0.14, trial evidence showed. Florida's
limit for drivers is 0.08.</TE>
<TE>   The Florida Highway Patrol initially blamed the brothers for the
crash, saying they were going the wrong way on the highway. A month
later, they said it was Farrall who was going the wrong way.</TE>
<TE>   But Farrall insisted he was not going the wrong way. Prosecutors
and legal analysts suggested that the jury might have been uncertain
about that issue due to conflicting evidence.</TE>
<TE>   "I still believe the brothers were going the right way,"
prosecutor Michael Horowitz said after the verdict. "Maybe the jurors
had difficulty with that."</TE>
<TE>   The investigation drew widespread scrutiny, with community
activists accusing the Highway Patrol of protecting the white FBI
agent at the expense of two brothers, who were black.</TE>
<TE>   Highway Patrol investigators said the FBI did not tell them
Farrall had been drinking before the crash and that the FBI prevented
them from talking to Farrall at the hospital where he was treated for
injuries afterward. The FBI has denied the allegations. Farrall had
been with the FBI for a little over a year before the crash and was
fired after his arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Accident reconstruction experts testifying for the prosecution
said skid marks, crash debris and the landing position of the cars
showed Farrall was driving south in the northbound lanes on
Interstate 95.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Bruce Udolf called the testimony "junk science"
aimed at manipulating the jury. He said prosecutors and investigators
were looking for a scapegoat to appease critics and the victims'
relatives, who have filed a $50-million lawsuit against the FBI, the
Highway Patrol, Farrall's FBI supervisor and the bar that served him.</TE>
<TE>   Farrall testified that he was not impaired by alcohol and that he
was going the right way before the crash.</TE>

<HD>Judge Rejects Einhorn's Bid to Overturn Murder Conviction</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Ira Einhorn's bid to overturn his murder conviction was rejected
Monday by a judge who dismissed defense claims that he made mistakes
during the trial of the former hippie guru.</LD>
<LD>   Defense attorneys said they will appeal.</LD>
<LD>   Einhorn, 62, was convicted last month and sentenced to life
without parole for bludgeoning former girlfriend Holly Maddux to
death in 1977. He kept her remains in a steamer trunk in his closet.</LD>
<TE>   Defense attorneys contend Judge William Mazzola improperly allowed
testimony involving two former girlfriends who said Einhorn turned
violent when they tried to end relationships with him. Defense
attorney Mitchell Strutin said the incidents happened too long ago to
be relevant.</TE>
<TE>   "We were forced to defend against this second layer of charges. It
amounted to a trial within a trial," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But prosecutor Joel Rosen said the assaults and journal entries
demonstrated that Einhorn had a "philosophy of violence."</TE>

<HD>New Rule Allows You to Give Up Your Day Job to Run for
Congress</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Simon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Here's a new reason to run for Congress: You can get paid, even if
you lose.</LD>
<LD>   Under a Federal Election Commission rule issued Monday,
non-incumbent candidates for federal office will be allowed to pay
themselves a salary out of campaign funds. The decision is designed
to spur more people of modest means to enter the political fray.</LD>
<LD>   But lest anybody think about getting rich off political campaigns,
the rule limits candidates' salaries to the amount they received in
their old job or the pay for the office they are seeking -- whichever
is lower.</LD>
<TE>   House and Senate members make $150,000 a year. The president earns
$400,000.</TE>
<TE>   The new policy was issued as the commission fleshed out the
details of the landmark campaign finance reform law passed by
Congress and signed by President Bush this year.</TE>
<TE>   "People shouldn't have to mortgage their homes to run for office,"
said John Pomeranz, nonprofit advocacy director for the Alliance for
Justice, a coalition of civil rights groups that supported the salary
rule.</TE>
<TE>   In past years, officials deadlocked on whether to permit
candidates to draw a salary from campaign funds, given a federal ban
on personal use of political contributions. But Monday's commission
vote allowing compensation was 5 to 1.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the rule said it would help level the playing field
between challengers and incumbents.</TE>
<TE>   "The argument has been that members of Congress get paid by the
taxpayers their normal salary while they're running for office," said
Larry Noble, who now heads the Center for Responsive Politics, which
tracks campaign financing. "But a challenger usually has to quit work
if they're going to run for office full time."</TE>
<TE>   The rule was pushed by Republican Michael E. Toner, a Bush
appointee to the FEC.</TE>
<TE>   "Why shouldn't people of modest means be able to run for office,
people like schoolteachers, blue-collar workers, other people who
don't have the ability to save hundreds of thousands of dollars and
forgo their salaries and jobs while they run for office?" Toner said
in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   A proliferation of wealthy congressional candidates have gained
attention in recent years for running largely self-financed
campaigns. The new salary rule includes safeguards to prevent abuses,
according to FEC officials. Presidential candidates who accept
partial taxpayer financing of their campaigns are forbidden from
paying themselves salaries. Members of Congress cannot collect
salaries from their campaigns in addition to their pay.</TE>
<TE>   Among experts, reaction to the rule was mixed.</TE>
<TE>   "The ruling may give a few more Americans an opportunity to run
for office, which is good," said Spencer Overton, an associate
professor of law at George Washington University Law School.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem remains, however, that most Americans don't have
access to hundreds of wealthy individuals willing to give $2,000 each
to pay for television commercials, consultants and other existing
expenses of a competitive federal campaign."</TE>
<TE>   Noble said, "A good effect will be if people run for office who
could not run before, and we see a broader cross section of
candidates. It will be bad if people start running for office just
for the sake of getting this money.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we need to keep an eye on how it works," he added. As an
example, he questioned whether the FEC will monitor whether a
candidate who claims to have earned $125,000 a year before seeking
office really had done so.</TE>
<TE>   Karl J. Sandstrom, the commissioner who opposed the rule, said he
was concerned it would allow some candidates to earn more than
others.</TE>
<TE>   A candidate who has been a parent staying home to take care of a
children, for example, might not be entitled to any salary.</TE>
<TE>   "If you didn't make any money the previous year, you're entitled
to nothing," he said.</TE>

<HD>Arizona Governor OKs Indian Gaming Plan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>Arizona Gov. Jane Dee Hull on Monday signed into law a ballot
proposition approved by voters to expand Indian gambling.</LD>
<LD>   However, Proposition 202 won't take effect until Hull gets the
go-ahead from the state Supreme Court to sign gambling agreements
with individual tribes.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, the high court was still considering whether to grant
an injunction requested by horse and dog racetracks to block the
agreements.</LD>
<TE>   The tracks argue that Proposition 202 violates the state
constitution by granting tribes monopoly gambling powers and
privileges not awarded to the general public.</TE>
<TE>   Under 202, the number of slot machines would be increased, and
casinos could add Las Vegas-style house-banked blackjack, which is
not allowed under current compacts. In exchange, the tribes would
give the state up to 8% of revenue, depending on how much the tribes
take in.</TE>
<TE>   Hull is required to sign the agreements approved in the initiative
in order for the measure to take effect. Under the proposition, she
has 30 days from Monday to do so.</TE>
<TE>   Should the high court deny the injunction, a Hull spokesman said
she could sign the agreements as early as today.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Superior Court Judge Robert Myers denied the tracks'
request for an injunction, saying they didn't have a reasonable
likelihood of succeeding in their case against the state. They then
appealed to the high court.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 202 was backed by 17 tribes.</TE>
<TE>   Two other gambling measures, including one that would have allowed
racetracks to operate slot machines, were defeated on election day.</TE>

<HD>Hate Crimes Against Muslims Soar, Report Says</HD>
<DH>After 9/11, the number of assaults and other incidents
increased 1,600%, FBI says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard A. Serrano</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Hate crimes and other acts of vengeance skyrocketed nationwide
against Muslims and other immigrants from the Middle East after the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, according to a long-awaited FBI report
released Monday.</LD>
<LD>   But Islamic leaders in Washington and elsewhere, many of whom were
themselves the targets of outrage in the days after the World Trade
Center and the Pentagon were hit, said the new numbers do not reflect
even more acts of retribution that countless immigrants were afraid
to report.</LD>
<LD>   The FBI found that while attacks against Muslims had previously
been the least common hate crime against a religious group--just 28
in 2000--the number of incidents surged to 481 in 2001, an increase
of 1,600%.</LD>
<TE>   The huge rise is "presumably as a result of the heinous incidents
that occurred on Sept. 11" of 2001, the FBI said.</TE>
<TE>   Ibrahim Hooper, spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic
Relations, said that while much of the bias has tapered off, there
was a tremendous backlash at first.</TE>
<TE>   "These new numbers come from the initial weeks and months after
9/11," he said, "when it was just basically out of control. We
couldn't keep up with the reports." According to the FBI report, most
incidents targeting Muslims and others of Middle Eastern background
ranged from assaults to intimidation. There also were three cases of
murder or manslaughter and 35 arson fires, the FBI said.</TE>
<TE>   The hate crime statistics were drawn from almost 12,000 local,
state and federal law enforcement agencies around the country. Areas
of the country with large Muslim populations, such as Southern
California, Chicago, Detroit and Washington, reported the most
incidents.</TE>
<TE>   The report did not break down the increases in specific cities.
But it noted that overall in Los Angeles, there were 450 hate crimes
targeting victims for their race, ethnic background or religion.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, much of the retaliation continued into the early part
of this year, until the U.S. war on terrorism in Afghanistan began to
wind down.</TE>
<TE>   Hooper and other Arab American leaders said that many immigrants
stayed home in the days after Sept. 11, afraid to go to work or
school or to shop for fear of retaliation. In many cities, mosques
were the target of vandalism. Also bothersome because it was
widespread, Hooper said, were incidents in which people were abused
while simply walking on the street. "There were shouts from a passing
car," Hooper said. "There was verbal harassment. There were comments
at work. It just degrades you."</TE>
<TE>   He and others said that many Muslims were afraid to report hate
crimes to the FBI, out of fear the bureau would want to investigate
them. Mohamad Ali Elahi, the imam at the Islamic House of Wisdom in
Detroit, where a half-million of the nation's 7 million Muslims live,
said many people of the Islamic faith still suffer emotionally from
the backlash.</TE>
<TE>   "For us, the pain continues, the suffering continues," he said.
"The prejudice that was produced after this disastrous event insulted
the sacredness and the belief system of our faith community."</TE>

<HD>No Evidence Found to Back Student's Coercion Claim</HD>
<DH>Judge sought probe of FBI after charges were dropped in
pilot radio case against Egyptian.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John J. Goldman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The Justice Department has uncovered no evidence to corroborate an
Egyptian student's allegations that an FBI polygraph examiner coerced
him into confessing that he owned an aviation radio found near the
World Trade Center on Sept. 11, according to a report released
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, the judge who ordered the inquiry cast doubt on
the polygraph as a valid investigative tool.</LD>
<LD>   Government prosecutors welcomed the Justice Department's finding,
and they said no further action is necessary.</LD>
<TE>   Robert S. Dunn, a lawyer representing Abdallah Higazy, subject of
the report, labeled the finding "a craftily woven cloth of deceit and
deception that was essentially a whitewash."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Jed S. Rakoff called for the probe after
prosecutors in January dropped charges of lying to investigators
against Higazy, 30, a computer science student who was detained as a
material witness in connection with the attack on the twin towers.</TE>
<TE>   Higazy was released in January after a pilot notified authorities
that he was the true owner of the radio.</TE>
<TE>   A month later, a hotel security guard pleaded guilty to lying when
he told the FBI that he found the radio in a locked safe in the room
that Higazy, a student at Polytechnic University in Brooklyn,
occupied during the terrorist attack.</TE>
<TE>   The guard, Ronald Ferry, 48, was sentenced to six months of
weekends in a halfway house.</TE>
<TE>   After these events, Rakoff ordered a report on how the FBI had
gotten the confession from an innocent man.</TE>
<TE>   Higazy charged that he was pressured into giving false information
after the FBI polygraph examiner threatened that the lives of his
family in Egypt and his brother in upstate New York would become a
"living hell."</TE>
<TE>   Higazy told interviewers from the Justice Department's Office of
the Inspector General that to save his family, he decided to confess
falsely to owning the radio found in the Millennium Hilton Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   He said he told the FBI agent administering the test that he gave
three different versions of how he obtained the radio.</TE>
<TE>   Higazy said he didn't inform his lawyer, or the government, about
the alleged threat the day of the examination or the next day at a
court hearing because he was afraid.</TE>
<TE>   In a two-part report to Rakoff, the Justice Department said Higazy
did not raise the issue until at least 11 days after he was allegedly
threatened.</TE>
<TE>   Government lawyers said assertions that the polygrapher, whose
name was deleted from the report, shouted and banged on the table
during the examination were belied by the fact that Higazy knew his
lawyer was right outside the interview room.</TE>
<TE>   The report said that two FBI agents outside the room did not hear
such noises during the polygraph, and that although Higazy was told
he could stop the test at any time, he declined to do so.</TE>
<TE>   Even when the polygrapher halted the examination and left the room
with the door open to speak with an FBI agent, Higazy made no attempt
to confer with his lawyer, who was just outside the room, the report
said.</TE>
<TE>   "In sum, Higazy's allegations that his family was threatened
during the course of the polygraph, or that the polygrapher coerced
Higazy or otherwise engaged in misconduct are contradicted by all of
the facts set forth by the other witnesses, including Mr. Dunn," the
report concluded.</TE>
<TE>   The document stressed that Dunn had conceded that he perceived no
reason to interrupt the examination while he was outside the
polygraph room.</TE>
<TE>   "Therefore, after a thorough investigation, there has been no
evidence uncovered to corroborate Higazy's allegations," the report
added.</TE>
<TE>   In rebuttal, Dunn charged that the examination was not supposed to
turn into an interrogation and that the report did not explain the
full circumstances of how his client falsely confessed to owning the
radio.</TE>
<TE>   In a memorandum, Rakoff said that conflicts remain between
Higazy's and the government's accounts of what happened in the
polygrapher's office, and that the reports left unanswered a broader
question.</TE>
<TE>   That issue, the judge added, was "whether the government's
continued reliance on such a doubtful investigatory tool as polygraph
testing increases the possibility of false confessions."</TE>

<HD>A Setting Sun for Icehouses</HD>
<DH>The South Texas hangouts offering a cool place to have a
cold beer are slipping away in a culture of mini-marts and singles
bars.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Megan K. Stack</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN ANTONIO</DL>
<LD>It's a poor man's community center, a latter-day trading post or a
Tejano juke joint. It's a scruffy backdrop for birthday parties,
stump speeches and domino showdowns. Not quite a bar, but more than a
convenience store, the icehouse is the sleepy, shadowy soul of the
working-class neighborhoods of South Texas.</LD>
<LD>   Since icehouses sprouted from the steamy streets of Texas'
burgeoning cities in the first half of the last century, they have
been all of these things, and something else. Comfortable turf for
lawyers or factory workers, bikers and children. Places to cool down,
show off or swap salacious tales.</LD>
<LD>   But in a modern landscape of television, shopping malls and
singles bars, icehouses are melting away, one by one.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a dying breed," says manager Cathy Doria, running fingers
over the counter at Stanley's Ice Station #2, a fading stack of
cinder blocks on San Antonio's south side. Catching sight of a
regular, she interrupts herself.</TE>
<TE>   "How ya doin', Tony?" her voice booms over the hiss and drone of
college football. "Bob beatcha in and beatcha out. He quit smokin',
so it doesn't take him so long to drink." She gives him a hard stare.
"You gonna be a good boy today, Tony?"</TE>
<TE>   Outside, the sun is setting into the sunken bowl of the city. A
chill stands in the concrete shadows by the take-away window --
another autumn is stretching into winter. In the scrubby wash of
cypress and mesquite that is Stanley's backyard, barefoot girls spin
and scramble at a tetherball stalk. An old-timer grips his Budweiser,
claps a fedora onto his head and shuffles over the yellowing grass to
a bench in the sun. College kids slouch at the rims of the pool
tables. They are here in common, the young and the old and the
in-between.</TE>
<TE>   An icehouse can be as simple as an overgrown hot dog stand, or can
be crammed into a converted shed, an abandoned garage or a
nondescript storehouse. They are dim buildings where hot weather is
battled with creaking ceiling fans and rollaway garage doors -- a
little dirty and a little sweaty, the sort of place where
neighborhood mutts, blue jeans and horseshoes are right at home.</TE>
<TE>   "They're sloppy, slapdash, added onto," San Antonio architect
Henry Munoz says. "It's this informal architecture where the canopy
records the time of day, where the garage door lets the inside out.
Some people think they're tacky. I think they're beautiful."</TE>
<TE>   Icehouses sell beer and soda pop, along with jumbles of fishing
supplies, canned chili and lottery tickets. They stop shy of selling
hard liquor, but might offer glasses of coke or tonic for those who
carry flasks. Most rigid of all criteria -- and any discerning
icehouse enthusiast will underline this point emphatically -- it
isn't an icehouse if it doesn't sell sacks of ice.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an ungraspable thing," says Tom Denyer, a former Texas A&amp;M
professor who has studied the history and sociology of icehouses.
"They're folk art -- performance art done by folk without being
concerned about audience or reaction. You go into an icehouse and
it's human drama."</TE>
<TE>   There used to be an icehouse for just about every neighborhood in
South Texas. In theory, they were places to pick up ice. In practice,
they were one of the region's defining social institutions. There was
an icehouse near St. Mary's University where young Chicano
intellectuals argued late into the night over poetry and Central
American intervention. There were icehouses where Democrats knew
they'd better put in a campaign appearance; icehouses known for their
conjunto music; icehouses renowned for their menudo and barbecue.</TE>
<TE>   The neighborhood lore of Flores Street is preserved in the chatter
of Stanley's cashiers: The day they refused to sell another beer to a
tipsy preacher and he condemned them to hell. The time Ernie got a
little drunk, crawled atop a creaking table and commenced an unsteady
striptease. Remember the night Mando had to be carried home?</TE>
<TE>   Stanley's has the jumbled look of a tag sale gone to seed. "Pride
Not Prejudice," reads a sign behind the bar. There is a lewd Spanish
proposition for Osama bin Laden and plastic beads that the owner's
grandchildren strung into necklaces, flats of motor oil and a
procession of slot machines. Painted vignettes of penguins and palm
trees cling to the facade.</TE>
<TE>   B.B. Taylor's father haunted the pool table here when she was a
kid. She grew up to work behind the bar. "I remember," she says from
her perch at the counter, "he'd be here drinking and shooting pool."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't as if somebody one day invented the icehouse. They
evolved in the alley of time between the advent of ice plants and the
innovation of air conditioning. Back then, everything moved slower in
the long, thick summers, and scouting for shade qualified as a
serious endeavor.</TE>
<TE>   Back then, ice was precious. It hadn't been long since the cold
stuff was slashed from the northern glaciers and shipped south to
Galveston. Then came the factories, and ice was carted in great
steaming blocks to neighborhood distribution sheds to be sawed,
chipped and sold.</TE>
<TE>   Texas was changing fast in the decades of the world wars -- a
petrochemical boom was reinventing the old ranch and farm state into
a constellation of modern cities. Displaced country folk left their
moribund hometowns and poured into the fledgling Texas metropolis to
make a living. They gathered in icehouses to ease their homesickness
and cool their summer sweats.</TE>
<TE>   It began with ice, and grew. After a time, enterprising owners
took to stocking milk, bread and cigarettes. Then they started icing
down bottles of Coke and beer, and hauled benches out under the shade
trees.</TE>
<TE>   The icehouse was born.</TE>
<TE>   "A guy could say, 'I'm going to the icehouse and get some bread,'
" says Mike Stanush, who owns Stanley's. "But then he could stay for
an ice cold beer."</TE>
<TE>   Icehouse patrons are a fiercely loyal set. People still drive back
to the streets where they grew up, to the old sheds and garages where
their parents whiled away the heavy, golden afternoons of bygone
Julys. It was Stanush's grandmother who first took him by the hand
and led him into an icehouse. "She'd come and say, 'We're going
honky-tonking,' and we'd go with her and her boyfriend," he says.
"They'd drink a few beers, and we'd play pinball."</TE>
<TE>   Munoz too remembers the long afternoons leaning over a Big Red at
his father's side in the neighborhood icehouse. The men drank beer;
their voices braided into a grown-up slur of politics. "That's part
of what I call the gentility of South Texas that's dwindling, but not
gone," he says. "Things are slower; things are informal. There's a
social connection here that doesn't exist in most big cities
anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Nobody really knows why the icehouse flourished in South Texas.
Was it the climatic combination of hot summer and dry prairie that
encouraged outdoor lounging? Was it the influence of Catholics, who
tended to regard alcohol more tolerantly than their Protestant
brethren? Was it some cultural alchemy wrought by the proximity to
Mexico, or by the influx of German immigrants to the Hill Country?</TE>
<TE>   For whatever reason, icehouses teemed on a tight patch of the map,
a region roughly bounded by Houston, San Antonio and the Mexican
border. In what Denley calls the "more white, more Anglo, more
Baptist" northern counties, icehouses were a far lesser -- and these
days long defunct -- phenomenon. Icehouses existed where whites and
Latinos mixed, as beat writer Jack Kerouac noted when he stumbled
upon a "mad gas station" during a dark drive south to the Rio Grande
through San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   "Mexicans were standing around in the hot light of the overhead
bulbs that were blackened by valley summerbugs, reaching down into a
soft drink box and pulling out beer bottles and throwing money at the
attendants," he wrote. "Whole families lingered around doing this. We
were already almost out of America and yet definitely in it and in
the middle of where it's maddest."</TE>
<TE>   Stanley's has been promising its patrons "the coldest beer in
town" since 1954. There used to be a chain of Stanley's sprinkled
throughout San Antonio -- these days, the joint on Flores is one of
the few icehouses left.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, heavens, I can't tell you how long I've been coming here,"
says John Ramirez. The retired policeman plants his elbows on the
countertop, cowboy hat tugged low over his brow. "It's kinda hard to
say why a person picks a particular place to do their drinking."</TE>
<TE>   Sorrowful owners say icehouses have become an outmoded convention.
Air conditioning has driven Texas summer indoors, turning the season
into a series of scoots over burned pavement, a time to cower in
frigid rooms and battle off the head colds brought by incessant
chill.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, the idea of wandering to the corner for a bottle of milk
is an anachronism. Neon-lit mini-markets shimmer like squat
lighthouses along the freeways and suburban byways. Ironically, the
7-Eleven chain grew from a Dallas icehouse.</TE>
<TE>   Drinking has changed too. Sipping alcohol in plain view of the
neighbors and children has an outmoded smack. "People want to go to
fancy nightclubs nowadays," says Stanush.</TE>
<TE>   On Flores Street, the men peddle hot turkey legs in the
lengthening shadows. A few miles away, the old Spanish missions stand
green and crumbling under the weight of centuries. Night is coming
down.</TE>
<TE>   In the television set at Stanley's, Texas is up on Tulane, a
Longhorn rushes and the man in overalls hollers, "Looky here!" The
patrons flip through Doria's wedding album; the bartenders discuss
the coming holidays.</TE>
<TE>   "Used to be there were icehouses all the way up and down Flores,
but I guess they just phased out," says bartender Robin Rubin. "I
don't know -- they just aren't here anymore."</TE>

<HD>N.Y. Council OKs Property Tax Increase</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>New York's City Council voted Monday to raise property taxes sharply
and slash $844 million in spending to help balance a budget that
slipped into the red amid recession and fallout from the Sept. 11
attacks.</LD>
<LD>   By a 41-6 vote, the council approved a somewhat scaled-down
version of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's plan to fight New York's
$1.1-billion budget deficit.</LD>
<LD>   The plan passed Monday boosts property taxes 18.49%, compared with
25% under the Bloomberg blueprint, and eliminates a few of
Bloomberg's nearly $900 million in proposed cost-saving measures.</LD>
<TE>   Under a compromise reached Friday by Bloomberg and Council Speaker
Gifford Miller, eight fire stations and 32 senior centers that had
been marked for closure will remain open. But the Fire Department
must still cut 50 marshals and 112 civilian jobs, the Police
Department must reduce its July 2003 incoming class by 1,900 officers
and the Department of Education must make $200 million in cuts. That
will result in hundreds more layoffs.</TE>
<TE>   The city still faces a $6.4-billion budget gap for fiscal year
2004, which begins July 1.</TE>
<TE>   Council member Lewis Fidler of Brooklyn said he supported the
increase only because it was necessary to help the city recover from
last year's attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "The tax increase we are acting on today is a war tax in my view,"
Fidler said.</TE>
<TE>   Under the plan, the annual tax for a single-family home worth
$245,000, currently $1,853, would go up this fiscal year by $171 to
$2,024. It would go up next fiscal year to $2,196.</TE>
<TE>   Before the vote, Bloomberg said that he was satisfied with the
compromise and that he plans to turn his attention to lobbying the
state Legislature. The mayor is seeking the Legislature's approval
for a commuter tax on workers who live outside the city, help in
paying for teachers' salaries and other aid.</TE>

<HD>Donations Going to Sniper Victims</HD>
<DH>County officials and a rights group are giving funds to
survivors and kin of those killed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Newsday</BD>
<DL>ROCKVILLE, Md.</DL>
<LD>The donations have slowed but the victims of the snipers who
terrorized the Washington area have not been forgotten.</LD>
<LD>   Montgomery County officials will donate about $116,000 today to
the United Way to be divided among the families of the 13
Washington-area shooting victims, said Tamara Schomer, crisis manager
for the metropolitan area branch of the organization.</LD>
<LD>   And Monday, the Washington, D.C.-based Victims' Rights Foundation
announced that it had given $18,000 to each of those wounded and to
the families of those killed.</LD>
<TE>   "Speaking on behalf of the families, we want to give our sincere
thanks for people's prayers and donations," Greg Wims, president of
the group, said at a news conference Monday in Montgomery County,
where six of the attacks occurred.</TE>
<TE>   The volunteer organization has raised $260,000 since the shootings
started in the Washington area. "This money, while it will not
replace the victims, will at least allow the families time to mourn
and grieve without wondering where their mortgage payments, their car
payments, will come from," said Ellen Alexander, victims' rights
director for Montgomery County.</TE>
<TE>   Ten people were killed and three others were wounded in a sniper
spree that began in suburban Maryland on Oct. 2 and paralyzed the
region as the killings spread into the district and suburban
Virginia. Three weeks after the attacks began, police arrested John
Allen Muhammad and Lee Boyd Malvo in connection with the shootings.
The two, who are being held in Virginia, have been linked to 21
shootings, 14 fatal, across the country.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation's payments were the first money that victims'
families have received from about $600,000 donated to several funds
that were set up in response to the sniper shootings.</TE>
<TE>   Individual trusts honoring some of the victims also have been
collecting money, and the United Way and the Salvation Army have
established funds.</TE>

<HD>New Crew for Space Station Brings a Girder</HD>
<DH>Shuttle arrives at orbiting platform to replace three
people in space since spring, and delivers a new piece of framework.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Space shuttle Endeavour arrived at the international space station on
Monday, delivering a new three-man crew and another girder for the
orbiting outpost.</LD>
<LD>   The one American and two Russians who have been living on the
space station since spring were thrilled to see Endeavour, their ride
home.</LD>
<LD>   "You guys look pretty good out there," space station astronaut
Peggy Whitson radioed as Endeavour made its final approach. The
shuttle closed the gap more slowly than usual and docked a half-hour
late, prompting Whitson to joke: "It looks like you guys fly that
like you stole it."</LD>
<TE>   The two spacecraft came together 250 miles over the South Pacific,
ending a round-and-round-the-world chase that began with Endeavour's
weekend launch. It marked the close of a six-month stint aboard the
space station for Whitson and cosmonauts Valery Korzun and Sergei
Treschev.</TE>
<TE>   When they moved into the space station on June 7, the three were
supposed to check out in October after 4 1/2 months. But shuttle
problems extended their stay.</TE>
<TE>   Astronaut Kenneth Bowersox, a 46-year-old Navy captain, succeeds
Korzun as the space station commander. Bowersox will remain on board
until March, along with American Donald Pettit and Russian Nikolai
Budarin. Mission Control welcomed them to their new home.</TE>
<TE>   The crews exchanged enthusiastic bear hugs once the hatches swung
open. Whitson teased Pettit about his new buzz cut.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, you got a haircut, dude," she said, laughing. "I'm glad
you're here."</TE>
<TE>   Pettit entered the space station with straws and bags of drinks
for Whitson and her Russian colleagues. "Coffee," he announced.</TE>
<TE>   Endeavour will remain docked for a full week so its crew can
install the latest link in the space station's backbone. The
$390-million girder will be removed from the shuttle payload bay
today, and a pair of shuttle astronauts will perform three spacewalks
to hook it up.</TE>
<TE>   A nearly identical girder was attached by another shuttle crew
last month. By the time the aluminum framework is completed in
another year, it will stretch longer than a football field and
support a network of solar wings and radiators.</TE>
<TE>   Pettit, a newcomer to space and the station's designated science
officer, was not supposed to be on this mission. He was originally an
understudy but was upgraded in July after NASA pulled astronaut
Donald Thomas off the flight.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors were worried about Thomas' exposure to cosmic radiation
during a four-month space voyage.</TE>
<TE>   For Thomas, it was a sore subject, so much so that he did not
contact the other astronauts before their launch, Bowersox said.</TE>
<TE>   "Going up for a long-duration flight was Don Thomas' dream, and
when he wasn't able to do it, it hurt him pretty bad," Bowersox said
Sunday. "So as the distance and the time heals that wound, then I
think it will be a little bit easier for him to discuss how much fun
we're having on orbit."</TE>

<HD>State Budget Crises Mount</HD>
<DH>Lawmakers press for federal bailouts, but they will find a
difficult climate in deficit-ridden Washington. Medicaid funding is a
top concern.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald Brownstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Demands from governors and state lawmakers for a federal financial
bailout are growing, as states from California to Florida face
potentially sweeping cuts in popular programs amid deepening budget
woes.</LD>
<LD>   Every state but Vermont is required by law to balance its budget,
and virtually all of them are now struggling with deficits. "This is
the worst budget crisis states have faced since World War II," said
Raymond Scheppach, executive director of the National Governors
Assn., which released a state fiscal survey Monday.</LD>
<LD>   But the states confront a difficult climate in Washington, as the
federal government struggles with its own budget deficits -- and both
President Bush and the incoming Republican Congress focus on other
priorities.</LD>
<TE>   Over the last several weeks, state officials have pressed
Washington for more money to fund homeland security improvements,
election reform, education, highway construction and, above all, the
joint state-federal Medicaid health-care program for the poor. That
program may suffer widespread cuts this year, even as the number of
Americans without health insurance is rising.</TE>
<TE>   Although states appear likely to receive aid on some fronts, most
analysts say that they are unlikely to obtain nearly as much help as
they are requesting. And that could mean deeper cutbacks, especially
in Medicaid, in states such as California that have been counting on
a federal lifeline.</TE>
<TE>   "The general picture is, don't count on anything from the feds,
because the federal government now has a deficit, and it also has
other priorities," said Kenneth Finegold, a senior research associate
at the nonpartisan Urban Institute. "National security and tax cuts
are priorities of this administration, and balancing state budgets
are not."</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials say that while they are increasing
spending in some areas important to states -- such as special
education -- it is unrealistic to expect a broad aid package when
Washington is in the red too. And they say that states may be helped
more -- especially in coping with exploding health-care costs -- by
reductions in federal regulations than in increases in federal
dollars.</TE>
<TE>   In all, the states faced a cumulative budget shortfall of nearly
$50 billion when initially designing their budgets for this fiscal
year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Last week, the conference reported that the deficit is on track to
swell by an additional $18 billion by June, when most states close
their books for the fiscal year. Tax receipts are running below
projections in two-thirds of the states, the legislatures group
found.</TE>
<TE>   In California alone, Gov. Gray Davis recently said the budget gap
was going to be even worse than the $21.1 billion projected by the
nonpartisan Legislative Analyst's Office. To begin dealing with that,
Davis said he would freeze as much state spending as possible and
would give the Legislature a package of $5 billion in budget cuts and
other savings to consider in a special session beginning Dec. 9.</TE>
<TE>   These vast deficits mark a screeching end to the boom times of the
late 1990s, when state revenues soared and governors of both parties
buoyed their popularity by cutting taxes and increasing spending on
such programs as education and children's health.</TE>
<TE>   In retrospect, it appears that states may have gone too far on
both fronts -- increasing spending and reducing revenue in ways that
became unsustainable when the economy slowed.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of states in the 1990s developed structural deficits,
because they increased spending and cut taxes, and that combination
left them with revenues that would not be sufficient ... unless the
economy would continue to grow at the high rate it was growing,"
Finegold said.</TE>
<TE>   States now have been forced to cut spending and, in a few
instances, raise taxes. In each case, tougher decisions are looming.</TE>
<TE>   In its report Monday, the governors association said 37 states
have cut $12.6 billion in spending in their 2002 budgets. However,
the report noted, states have relied heavily on short-term solutions,
such as drawing down on so-called rainy-day funds that swelled during
the fat years of the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Also, many states have been able to get by with cuts that the
public is least likely to feel, such as reducing their work forces or
limiting travel.</TE>
<TE>   States have moved even more gingerly in considering taxes.
According to the governors association study, states raised taxes by
just over $8 billion in this year's budgets.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the widespread cuts in state taxes approved while the
economy was booming from 1994 to 2001 are now reducing state revenue
by more than $40 billion annually, according to an analysis by the
Center on Budget and Policy Priorities think tank.</TE>
<TE>   The reluctance to take tough steps at home may hurt the states in
their pleas to Washington for help.</TE>
<TE>   Here are the key areas where state legislators and governors are
seeking additional help:</TE>
<TE>   Homeland security: States have been frustrated by Congress'
failure to approve the $3.5 billion in grants that Bush proposed to
upgrade local emergency agencies that would provide the first
response in a terrorist attack. Most expect that money will be
approved in 2003 as the incoming GOP Congress and the Bush
administration reach agreement on broader appropriation bills that
stalled on Capitol Hill this year.</TE>
<TE>   Election reform: Prospects are far more uncertain for states
receiving the $2.2 billion that they say they need to fund election
reform legislation that Congress approved this year. Congressional
committees have been talking about much smaller funding levels.</TE>
<TE>   Highway construction: States are pressing Washington to restore
$4.1 billion in highway construction funds slashed from the omnibus
bill that Congress approved to keep the federal government operating
until January.</TE>
<TE>   Health care: By far the biggest issue for the states is their push
for increased federal funding for Medicaid. With health-care costs
rising rapidly -- and the recession increasing caseloads -- Medicaid
spending spiked by more than 13% in 2002, the largest annual increase
since 1992. States are now spending more money on Medicaid than any
other program except elementary and secondary education, according to
the governors association study.</TE>
<TE>   As costs explode, states are beginning to scale back Medicaid
coverage. One recent survey found that 29 states were cutting
payments to doctors and hospitals, 15 were requiring higher
co-payments from recipients and 18 were taking at least some steps to
reduce eligibility.</TE>
<TE>   Larger and more widespread cuts seem likely in the months ahead,
most experts believe. "Any state with a fiscal problem is going to be
cutting their Medicaid program next year," said Al Jackson, vice
president for political affairs at the American Hospital Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Health experts find that an ominous prospect, because more
Americans last year relied on Medicaid as the number with private
health insurance plummeted by 1.2 million, according to the Census
Bureau.</TE>
<TE>   Trying to forestall further cuts, the Senate in July approved an
emergency $6-billion increase in the federal contribution to the
program. Washington now picks up about three-fifths of the cost of
Medicaid, with the states supplying the rest. Under the Senate bill,
the federal government would have absorbed a slightly larger share of
the cost for 18 months. The Senate bill also provided states with an
additional $3 billion to bolster social-service programs.</TE>
<TE>   But the bill died in the House amid opposition from the Bush
administration. White House officials fear that the Senate's
"temporary" increase in the federal share of Medicaid costs would
become permanent. As an alternative, the administration proposed, and
the House approved, one-time grants to states of $3 billion to cover
the uninsured.</TE>
<TE>   Without significantly more federal dollars -- which appear
unlikely -- the coming budget sessions could be turbulent in many
states. With the easiest spending cuts behind them, states may be
facing much more politically explosive reductions or tax increases
this fiscal year. And that means the howls for help from the state
capitals may grow even louder in the months ahead.</TE>

<HD>Streamlined Check-Ins May Be Tested</HD>
<DH>A 'trusted traveler' program would improve security,
government report says. Some practical questions must be answered
first.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Streamlined airport check-in for travelers who have passed a
background investigation could get a test as early as next year,
after a congressional agency determined that the approach might
improve security.</LD>
<LD>   The General Accounting Office, in a report to be released today,
concludes that a so-called "trusted traveler" program would be
feasible, but many practical questions must first be answered.
Airlines are clamoring for such a program to woo back frequent
business travelers turned off by high ticket prices and security
hassles.</LD>
<LD>   Prompted by the GAO findings, Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas)
plans to call for a test of the concept as early as next year at
several airports, her office said. Hutchison is expected to chair the
Senate aviation subcommittee next year.</LD>
<TE>   "A registered traveler program offers potential for improving
security and reducing inconvenience to participating travelers," says
the GAO report, a copy of which was obtained by The Times.</TE>
<TE>   Fearing that terrorists could infiltrate the program, the
Transportation Security Administration had initially opposed special
treatment for low-risk passengers. However, the agency has now
reversed course and set up a Registered Traveler Program Office to
study the concept and plan for its possible implementation. Tom
Ridge, who was nominated by President Bush today to head the new
Homeland Security Department, was an early advocate of the idea.</TE>
<TE>   The program would be voluntary, so those concerned about
government intrusion into their private lives would be under no
obligation to apply.</TE>
<TE>   A "trusted" or "registered" traveler would have to pass a
background check before being issued the high-tech identification
card that would allow access to express security lanes.</TE>
<TE>   The card would incorporate a "biometric identifier" such as a
fingerprint or a measurement from the eye or hand. A special machine
would read the card and match it to the traveler.</TE>
<TE>   At peak travel times like Thanksgiving week, trusted travelers
could clear security in a matter of seconds. They would still have to
pass through a metal detector and put their carry-on luggage through
X-ray machines, but they would be spared more intrusive searches.</TE>
<TE>   "According to TSA officials, the agency is willing to consider
some differentiated security procedures for program participants,"
the report says.</TE>
<TE>   Theoretically, passengers left in the standard security lanes
would also benefit, because many frequent fliers would have been
culled from their lines.</TE>
<TE>   A minority of passengers who travel often account for a large
share of the people at airports, statistics show.</TE>
<TE>   The two-tiered approach to security could also improve protection
for all passengers because fewer resources would have to be expended
searching low-risk travelers.</TE>
<TE>   Several countries, including Israel, Great Britain and the
Netherlands, have trusted traveler programs at key international
airports. U.S. immigration authorities use the same concept at
certain crossings on the Mexican and Canadian borders to expedite
passage for workers.</TE>
<TE>   One issue that would have to be addressed before the program can
be extended to air travelers is who would pay. A background check can
cost up to $150 per individual, the GAO report estimates. Frequent
fliers would be willing to pay up to $100 to enroll, and $25 to $50
annually for renewal, according to airline officials. Many business
travelers would likely be able to pass the cost on to their
companies.</TE>
<TE>   The government would have to spend about $10 million to set up a
test of the system at six airports, a congressional official said.
Hutchison, who is also a member of the Senate Appropriations
Committee, intends to press for the funding.</TE>
<TE>   The GAO recommended that federal authorities test the concept on a
small scale, after closely studying the experience of other
countries. Such a test would help address security-related concerns
and provide a sense of how popular the program might be among
travelers. The government should select a single technology for use
at all airports, and should develop performance measures to monitor
and evaluate the program, the GAO recommended.</TE>
<TE>   Although the idea sounds straightforward, it raises many thorny
questions. Among them:</TE>
<TE>   Should the program be limited to U.S. citizens only? What
infractions or characteristics would deny someone a trusted traveler
card? Would there be any right to appeal the denial? Would the
information gathered in background investigations be used solely for
airport security, or could it be shared with other law enforcement
agencies or used for commercial purposes? Would children be allowed
to use the express lane with their cardholding parents? Would the
federal government be financially liable if a trusted traveler
committed a terrorist act at an airport or on a plane?</TE>
<TE>   The answer to many of the questions involves trade-offs that could
affect civil and privacy rights.</TE>
<TE>   For example, limiting the program to U.S. citizens would simplify
the background checks, by making it easier to verify information. One
option calls for initially allowing only U.S. passport holders to
enroll. But that would automatically exclude law-abiding, taxpaying
immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   "Concern was expressed that certain races and ethnicities, mainly
Arab Americans, would be systematically excluded from program
participation," the report says.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts interviewed by the GAO expressed concern that the
card could become a prelude to an internal passport, such as those
required in totalitarian countries.</TE>
<TE>   "Civil liberties advocates ... were particularly concerned about
the potential for such a program to lead to the establishment of a
national identity card," the report says. Nonetheless, the trusted
traveler idea appears to be on the verge of going forward.
Congressional officials say there is broad support among lawmakers,
industry and groups representing frequent fliers.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Strongly Defends Saudis in Fight on Terrorism</HD>
<DH>Administration points to help in tracking Al Qaeda's money
trail as the royal family admits to an indirect link to two Sept. 11
hijackers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Gerstenzang and Richard A. Serrano</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration Monday strongly defended Saudi Arabia's role
in the war on terrorism after Saudi officials acknowledged that the
wife of the kingdom's U.S. ambassador may have unwittingly supported
two of the Sept. 11 hijackers.</LD>
<LD>   The disclosure of an indirect financial trail from the Saudi royal
family to two Saudis who lived in San Diego before boarding the plane
that crashed into the Pentagon triggered sharp congressional
criticism of Saudi behavior.</LD>
<LD>   But White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said President Bush "does
believe the Saudis have been a good partner in the war against
terrorism."</LD>
<TE>   In particular, he singled out Saudi Arabia's assistance in
tracking Al Qaeda's money trail, and taking steps to cut off the
terrorist organization's financing.</TE>
<TE>   Both U.S. and Saudi officials sought to repair any lasting damage
to the long relationship between the two countries at a time when the
kingdom is deciding whether to allow the Pentagon to use its military
bases, and fly through its airspace, if the United States attacks
Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The financial connection surfaced over the weekend with the
disclosure that money from an account of Princess Haifa al Faisal,
the wife of Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the kingdom's ambassador to the
United States, had gone to two Saudi families, one of whom then
provided help to two of the hijackers.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department officials in Washington and in Southern
California say they have found no evidence suggesting the princess or
any Saudi officials knowingly helped the hijackers. The chief Saudi
spokesman here, Nail al Jubeir, has insisted that the princess never
meant to assist the terrorist conspiracy.</TE>
<TE>   The issue is drawing attention to the reach of the Saudi royal
family, and to the anxieties that are rampant as the Bush
administration and the Saudi leaders view each other warily.</TE>
<TE>   In the nearly 15 months since the attacks on the World Trade
Center and the Pentagon, in which 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudis,
the kingdom has come under increasingly negative scrutiny in the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   But a Saudi spokesman voiced optimism that the result of the new
scrutiny may be to "show how much we have been cooperating in the war
on terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   "It's unfortunate that some people jump to conclusions based on
half-truths and rumors. There is nothing there and people are trying
to make connections that don't exist. But then, some people don't
think the moon landing happened," Al Jubeir said.</TE>
<TE>   Among experts in U.S.-Saudi relations, the idea that a member of
the royal family would seek to further the Al Qaeda goals drew
derision. That is because Osama bin Laden, the terrorist group's
leader, is deeply opposed to the Saudi leadership and seeks to bring
about a sharp break between Saudi Arabia and the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "If Osama's alive, he must be ecstatic. This is his plan at work.
This is what he wanted to produce and now he's got it," said Chas
Freeman, who was the U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia from 1989 to
1992 and is now president of the private Middle East Policy Council.</TE>
<TE>   Al Jubeir said that neither Prince Bandar nor Princess Haifa had
met either of the Saudi men -- Osama Basnan and Omar al Bayoumi --
who had helped the hijackers.</TE>
<TE>   The Saudi government has said that the princess thought she was
making charity payments to Basnan's wife, who needed treatment for a
thyroid problem. Later, Al Bayoumi provided financial help to two
hijackers, Khalid Almihdhar and Nawaf Alhazmi, as the terrorists
arrived in California.</TE>
<TE>   Even before the case came to light, U.S. investigators were trying
to determine whether Al Bayoumi had a financial relationship with the
embassy, was working as an informant monitoring San Diego's large
Saudi community, or had been helping the terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   He met the two hijackers at Los Angeles International Airport when
they first arrived in California, brought them to San Diego, helped
them resettle there, and briefly lent them rent money.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Al Jubeir said Al Bayoumi had no financial relationship
with the embassy and was not working as an informant. FBI sources
said they had found no evidence suggesting he was tracking the local
Saudi community, and that the meeting at LAX was a chance encounter.</TE>
<TE>   Al Bayoumi left the United States six months before Sept. 11, and
is believed to be living in Saudi Arabia. Basnan was deported on Nov.
17, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Jeremy Warren, a San Diego lawyer for Basnan and his wife,
insisted Monday they were not trying to help the terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   "My clients were not spies or terrorists or anything like them.
They were just good parents trying to raise their kids," he said. He
said Basnan knew the hijackers only casually at a local mosque, and
that his clients were indigent and unemployed.</TE>
<TE>   Court records show that the wives of Basnan and Al Bayoumi were
arrested for shoplifting in April 2001, pleaded guilty and paid their
fines.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department sources Monday offered further explanation of
why the future hijackers needed help paying their first two months'
rent: The landlord would not accept their offer of cash, and also
wanted references.</TE>
<TE>   "So [Al] Bayoumi sponsored them and [gave them] a cashier's check
drawn on his bank account," the source said. Later that day, the
Justice official said, the hijackers repaid Al Bayoumi with cash, a
transaction documented by activity on his checking account.</TE>
<TE>   Another FBI official said that while Al Bayoumi clearly knew the
eventual hijackers, there is no evidence that he received any money
from the Saudi government.</TE>
<TE>   To the contrary, the FBI investigation found, the money from the
Saudi princess only made its way to al Bayoumi's wife when one check
to Basnan was endorsed over to her.</TE>

<HD>New Anti-Terrorism Legislation Fosters a Sense of
Insecurity</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patt Morrison</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush signed a law Monday creating a Department of Homeland
Security to prevent terrorist attacks. The bill extends government
access to e-mail and phone records, and authorizes integrating
government and private-sector information for "data-mining," which
could ultimately collate such data as credit-card transactions,
medical, library, academic and other records, to look for suspicious
activity.</LD>
<LD>   -- News reports</LD>
<LD>   Some of the law's more obscure provisions allow the DHS to use the
data to contact Americans to ask them personally to join the war on
terrorism, as these sample letters show:</LD>
<TE>   The Theodore Kaczynski Amendment: "Dear American: Records show you
have recently shopped at a sporting goods store and have purchased,
among other 'red-flag' items, a tent and a compass. Tents can be used
by terrorists to hide out in America's beautiful wilderness areas and
assemble explosive devices. A compass could aid in finding the
direction of Mecca. Because cross-referencing to our membership
database shows you do not belong to any scouting or related
organization, DHS officers will be contacting you to ask you to
prove, among other things, that you can tie a sheepshank knot and
whittle a duck decoy out of a hunk of wood, or give them a good
reason why not."</TE>
<TE>   The Restaurant Protection Amendment: "DHS records show you have
not patronized any of the nation's fine fast-food restaurants in at
least two weeks, and no correlation-search of your medical records
indicates any health condition that would prevent your enjoying the
all-American meal of burger, fries and cola. (Be advised: A second
notice could bring DHS officers to your home unannounced to search
for evidence of couscous.)"</TE>
<TE>   The Family Values Amendment: "Records show you have purchased an
over-the-counter pregnancy test within the last week. Please be
advised that we have sorted through your trash to find the test
results. A positive pregnancy test means DHS family counselors will
be coming to your home or place of business to speak with you, your
family, neighbors and co-workers, to ensure that your pregnancy means
the nation will be welcoming another fine young American citizen in
(fill in the blank) months' time. Congratulations, Mom!"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I made all that up -- at least I hope I did; who knows what the
feds are cooking up? The new homeland security laws make it harder
for us to find out what they're up to, and easier for them to get a
fix on us.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Bratton, Los Angeles' police chief, has been exhorting his
new city to get angry about gangbangers run amok in L.A. Can't anyone
out there spare a little fury for the forces running amok in D.C.?</TE>
<TE>   The bill flagrantly cloaks in "national security" legislation so
porky it could win a blue ribbon at a county fair. U.S. companies
that move their business offshore, out of the great American
homeland, to dodge paying federal taxes can now get a juicy piece of
the antiterrorism cash-pie by landing federal contracts. Some
patriots leave the country to keep from paying their own taxes, but
can get big government checks -- the taxes you and I pay but they
don't.</TE>
<TE>   Want more? The Pentagon is independently ramping up a "Total
Information Awareness" mega-database to correlate bank deposits,
Internet surfing, magazine subscriptions, academic grades, medical
information, credit card transactions. If you do it, Big Colonel
could pretty much know about it.</TE>
<TE>   The man in charge of this massive e-snoop is John Poindexter,
national security advisor to Ronald Reagan, the president who railed
against "big gub'mint." Poindexter was convicted of Iran-Contra
felonies such as destroying documents, lying to Congress -- the usual
Beltway rap sheet. His conviction was overturned because of some
bollix in his immunity agreement. Asked about this record, President
Bush released a statement saying Poindexter "has served our nation
very well." Absolutely right: He just didn't serve it long enough for
my liking, not a single day of his six-month jail sentence.</TE>
<TE>   So what, you're saying. I'm not doing anything wrong. Let 'em
look.</TE>
<TE>   Who gets to define "wrong"?</TE>
<TE>   In the paranoid 1950s, the feds could keep you from getting a job
if you were on the "wrong" side of security-check questions like,
"What do you think of female chastity? Do you follow the United
Nations' activities? Is it proper to mix white and Negro blood
plasma?" Indiana demanded loyalty tests for pro wrestlers. A
scientist was kept off a government panel because he was arrested at
a protest to integrate a swimming pool.</TE>
<TE>   So I ask you again, who gets to define "wrong"?</TE>
<TE>   I don't know what homeland this purports to defend, but it doesn't
sound like the one I grew up in. You may have heard of it. The land
of the free ... the United States of America.</TE>

<HD>Man Goes on Trial in Son's Fire Death</HD>
<DH>Duane West is accused of trapping his 4-year-old in a
burning bed to get out of paying child support. Defense says he
suffered a breakdown.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kristina Sauerwein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The last memory Jaquetta "Nicole" Taylor has of her son was his
father blocking the 4-year-old's escape from a burning bed, she
testified Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "He sat straight up and started screaming, 'Mommy! Mommy!' " the
33-year-old recalled in a shaky, soft voice in Los Angeles County
Superior Court as a murder trial opened for Duane West.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors alleged that West killed his son Marquise to avoid
child-support payments. His defense attorney told jurors in the
downtown courthouse that West's action was the result of an emotional
breakdown.</LD>
<TE>   For the most part, Taylor looked calm. But when the prosecutor
asked her to recall Marquise's last day of life, she held a tissue to
her mouth and wept.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Lance Ito asked if she
wanted a break.</TE>
<TE>   "Please," she whispered.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor darted out of the courtroom, tears streaming down her face.</TE>
<TE>   West, 30, is charged with murder, attempted murder, torture,
arson, child abuse and burglary in the July 9, 2001, attack in
Granada Hills in which he allegedly beat Taylor and set her hair on
fire with nail polish remover and a match.</TE>
<TE>   Marquise Diantae McDonald died from burns the next day. If
convicted, West faces life in prison without parole.</TE>
<TE>   The mother told jurors that she tried to escape her two-story
townhouse and get help when West charged after Marquise. The boy had
been sleeping in his mother's bed, which caught fire.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor said that she was able to roll down the stairs and run out
the front door, where she fell to the ground. West followed her and
stomped on her chest.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just laying there, saying 'Help me, help me,' " Taylor
said.</TE>
<TE>   She spotted a passerby and yelled: "My baby's upstairs burning.
Please go get my baby."</TE>
<TE>   In his opening statement, Deputy Dist. Atty. Craig Mitchell said
the passerby went upstairs and, when he tried to pull Marquise to
safety, the boy's skin became loose in his hands.</TE>
<TE>   At times, the trial "will be very difficult to listen to,"
Mitchell told jurors as he held up the boy's photo. " ... [Marquise]
deserves his day in court."</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell contended that West's acts had been intentional and
deliberate. He said West had admitted to holding Marquise down to
stop him from leaving the blazing bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   "The murder of Marquise was carried out for financial gain,"
Mitchell said.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Ilona Peltyn said West had been emotionally
distraught in the weeks before his son's death.</TE>
<TE>   "Duane West was unraveling," said Peltyn, emphasizing that for the
first few years of Marquise's life, West had not known he was the
father.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor testified that she originally thought Marquise was the son
of another man, which is why she gave Marquise the last name
McDonald. But as her son grew, she said she noticed that his eyes,
nose and "everything else" looked just like West, whom she had met
years earlier at a Pop Warner football game in the San Fernando
Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The two never married and had sex only once, Taylor said, but they
maintained a friendship. West asked to keep a photo of Marquise and
helped her select Christmas gifts for the boy, Taylor said.</TE>
<TE>   They danced around the paternity issue until, one day, it came up.</TE>
<TE>   "You know Marquise is your son, and I know Marquise is your son,"
Taylor recalled saying to West. "What are we going to do about it?"</TE>
<TE>   Taylor asked for child support. West paid her $150 a month in May
and June of 2001. Taylor wanted more, while West wanted to give less,
if anything, Taylor testified.</TE>
<TE>   "We were both angry," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In early July, West's defense attorney said, her client perceived
Taylor's persistent calls for child support as a threat. West feared
losing his house, car, wife and children.</TE>
<TE>   "He would lose his life," Peltyn told jurors. "He would have
nothing. He would be nothing."</TE>
<TE>   In court, West slouched in his chair. He wore a light shirt with
trousers and occasionally fidgeted when Taylor spoke, but otherwise
showed little emotion.</TE>
<TE>   The trial resumes Tuesday in Los Angeles County Superior Court.</TE>
