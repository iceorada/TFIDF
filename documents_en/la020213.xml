<LD>Sophie B. Hawkins is feeling lucky. After spending the last few
months feverishly writing and recording in her home studio in Venice,
the resilient singer-songwriter says she is considering "really good
offers" from two major labels that resulted from just two weeks of
shopping her new material.</LD>
<LD>   On a balmy Monday afternoon at Venice beach, she sits in the sun,
percolates over a Greek salad at the Sidewalk Cafe and talks about
artistic vision, the fleeting nature of fame and the business of
selling records. Her eyes are animated behind her orange-tinted
glasses. "Isn't this divine?" she asks.</LD>
<LD>   Hawkins, 35, who earned fame with her 1992 hit, "Damn, I Wish I
Was Your Lover," is preparing for a comeback, of sorts. She had two
successful records in the early 1990s, but was left nearly broke by
bad financial decisions. Ryodisk Inc. released her third album,
"Timbre," last year, but she recently parted ways with the label,
unhappy about the album's promotion.</LD>
<TE>   Now, as well as pitching her new record, Hawkins is pursuing work
as a film composer. One of her songs is featured during a love scene
in Josh Hartnett's new film, "40 Days and 40 Nights," and Billy Bob
Thornton recently purchased another song. Hawkins is also keeping her
fingers crossed that she'll be chosen to help score "The Human
Stain," an upcoming Miramax film starring Nicole Kidman and Anthony
Hopkins.</TE>
<TE>   This month, the 1998 documentary about her life, "The Cream Will
Rise," will be released on video. The film, by screenwriter and
director Gigi Gaston, delves deeply into Hawkins' difficult
relationship with her family as well as a childhood haunted by sexual
abuse, alcoholism and anorexia.</TE>
<TE>   For Hawkins, the film represented a great risk. Ultimately,
however, she said the project released her from a lot of lingering
pain, and helped her realize her potential.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that I'm still around--that's what's important about the
documentary," Hawkins says. "The fact that I'm still doing more work,
in more fields, and am making more money and feeling happier and
doing better-- that is a good sign."</TE>
<TE>   Ken Lay's Deal</TE>
<TE>   Kenneth Lay's cash flow improved this week, as an anonymous buyer
purchased one of the Enron founder's properties in Aspen, Colo. The
cottage was valued at $4.1 million, but sold for $10 million.</TE>
<TE>   The Lay family recently offered three other Aspen properties for
sale: two homes valued at $6.1 million each and a lot listed at $2.9
million. The 3,015-square-foot cottage, however, was not listed for
sale, and sold in a private deal. The Lay family also owns several
other properties in Houston and Galveston.</TE>
<TE>   The cottage, which was built in 1959, is modest by Aspen
standards, and local real estate agents believe it is likely the
anonymous buyer will tear it down to build a grander home. Michael
Eisner, Jack Nicholson and Goldie Hawn also own property at the
upscale ski-resort area.</TE>
<TE>   Playboy Pet Dies</TE>
<TE>   Pets have famously come and gone at the Playboy Mansion, but one,
known only as Teri, endured for almost three decades.</TE>
<TE>   The death of such a familiar figure has cast a pall over the
Holmby Hills Estate. Teri, 32, was a wooly monkey, and, said Playboy
spokesman Bill Farley, she died last week of natural causes.</TE>
<TE>   Born in the Amazon region, Teri was among the last wooly monkeys
to come to the United States. (In 1975, the federal government banned
the private import of primates, other than for medical research.)</TE>
<TE>   She spent most of her days in a cedar tree at the estate,
entertaining celebrities and other visitors. Elizabeth Hurley
recently became an ardent fan, Farley said.</TE>
<TE>   Teri is believed to have been the oldest wooly monkey to live
side-by-side with humans, Farley said, adding that she surpassed the
average life expectancy for a female of her species by some seven
years.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of her death, Teri had lived the equivalent of more
than 100 human years.</TE>
<TE>   She left no survivors.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service is planned today at the mansion.</TE>
<TE>   'The Natural' Politician</TE>
<TE>   This time around, "Primary Colors" author Joe Klein has no qualms
about taking credit for his work. "The Natural," which hits
bookstores next month, is his nonfiction account of the
"misunderstood presidency of Bill Clinton."</TE>
<TE>   In the book, Klein argues that Clinton's election campaign
"appeared to exist entirely, and very comfortably, within the grammar
of popular culture--a cross between a disaster movie and a country
music song ....His staff called him Elvis--and, more privately, 'The
Natural,'  after the character played by Robert Redford in the film
adaptation of Bernard Malamud's baseball novel. He was, the
consultant Paul Begala would say, quoting the film, 'the best there
ever was.'"</TE>
<TE>   Later in the book, Klein makes this "damned with faint praise"
assessment:</TE>
<TE>   "He remains the most compelling politician of his generation,
although that isn't saying much."</TE>
<TE>   On Al Gore's presidential aspirations, Klein offers: "Gore had a
genius for subservience ... he was a shy, uncomfortable man, who once
admitted to me that he probably wouldn't have become a politician if
his father--who had been an esteemed, if gaseous, liberal senator
from Tennessee--hadn't been in the business. Even as vice president,
Gore seemed all tangled up in his sonhood ... he seemed the eternal
protege, more a son than a father figure, more a student--the world's
best student--than a teacher. He was a natural number two."</TE>
<TE>   Ouch ...</TE>
<TE>   Jet-Setter's Birthday</TE>
<TE>   Hotel heiress Paris Hilton celebrates her 21st birthday today with
a jet-setter's evening. It starts with dinner at Studio 54 in New
York, followed by a Las Vegas bash at club Light in the Bellagio
hotel.</TE>
<TE>   By her side will be boyfriend and model Jason Shaw, and friends
Tara Reid and Lionel Richie's daughter, Nicole. But the fetes
honoring Hilton's transition into legal adulthood don't stop there.</TE>
<TE>   She started the celebrations last Friday with a pajama party at
club Lotus in New York. On March 1, the party moves to Los Angeles
with a late-night gathering at the new GQ Lounge inside the Sunset
Room in Hollywood. By late March, Paris is off to Tokyo.</TE>
<TE>   Quote/Unquote</TE>
<TE>   Don Henley has no peaceful, easy feelings when he hears Shania
Twain and Faith Hill clutter up the country airwaves--many of their
songs inspired by the burnished pop-country sound of the Eagles.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a constant source of irritation to me that great country
artists like Merle Haggard, Johnny Cash and George Jones don't get
airplay on a great many country stations today," he told The Times
recently. "What they call 'young country,' unfortunately, is an
offshoot of what we used to do. It's our fault. I'm so sorry. I
apologize to the entire universe."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Even after all these years, there are still many questions about
love. Why is love so elusive? How much does it cost? Now, finally,
some answers:</LD>
<LD>   What exactly is love anyway?</LD>
<LD>   Love has various meanings. Poets see love in the twinkle of the
milky way. Or in the slant of sunlight on a winter's day. The ancient
Greeks, a practical people, apparently believed love was an illness,
not covered by most major health plans.</LD>
<TE>   Even today, love is not covered by most major health plans.</TE>
<TE>   Why not?</TE>
<TE>   Love is not easy to treat. For one thing, it can last 48 hours or
48 days. In rare cases, love can last a year or more. (For more on
this, see Freud's writings on pain and pleasure.)</TE>
<TE>   What do men really want?</TE>
<TE>   Women.</TE>
<TE>   What do women really want?</TE>
<TE>   Women want a companion, a soul mate, a shoulder to lean on. They
want romance and surprise. Walks on the beach. Moonlight. Diamonds.
SUVs. A pretty good line of credit.</TE>
<TE>   What else do women want? Women want little, random acts of
kindness. And big, sweeping romantic gestures that make their
girlfriends envious. They want Paris in the spring and New York in
autumn. Christmas in the Alps and Tuscany in mid-June.</TE>
<TE>   Women want a guy with a granite chin, but who is sensitive, you
know, and kind of athletic. A guy who's spontaneous but reliable.
Simple yet enigmatic. Tall but short. Women want Arthur Miller, Joe
DiMaggio and that Brad Pittsburgh guy all rolled into one. That's all
that women want.</TE>
<TE>   Are they, like, nuts?</TE>
<TE>   Many of them, yes.</TE>
<TE>   My husband is broken. Any suggestions?</TE>
<TE>   Husbands are like electronics. The best way to fix one is to turn
him on and off.</TE>
<TE>   I've tried rebooting my husband that way. His eyes flicker but he
doesn't respond.</TE>
<TE>   If you have trouble turning your husband on, smack him hard on the
forehead and jiggle his modem. This will turn on most husbands.</TE>
<TE>   Can kids help a marriage?</TE>
<TE>   Definitely.</TE>
<TE>   How many?</TE>
<TE>   The more children the better.</TE>
<TE>   Why?</TE>
<TE>   It increases the odds of having one you like.</TE>
<TE>   Cupid seems nice. But my friends say he swallows a lot of his
frustrations and is now just a pudgy, diapered little man who can't
get a date. Is this true?</TE>
<TE>   Yes.</TE>
<TE>   Any idea what Cupid's cholesterol level is?</TE>
<TE>   650 (roughly the same as Santa's).</TE>
<TE>   Some men think they can make up for all the wrong things they do
with a special gift and a mumbled apology. Why?</TE>
<TE>   You mean some guys do both?</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, romance seems to be disappearing. Is there any hope?</TE>
<TE>   Just when you think there is no hope, along comes hope. Hope is
constant. Hope keeps us going.</TE>
<TE>   Like Hope in that TV show "thirtysomething"?</TE>
<TE>   Yes. But she complained a lot. I'm thinking more of eternal hope.
Like what you feel when your favorite baseball team takes the field
for the first time each spring.</TE>
<TE>   So love is like baseball?</TE>
<TE>   No, in baseball you get two more strikes.</TE>
<TE>   Is it possible to put a price tag on true love?</TE>
<TE>   In theory, love is free. In practice, it can be rather expensive.</TE>
<TE>   Here are some of the probable costs of true, everlasting love:</TE>
<TE>   First date: $100</TE>
<TE>   Second date: $75</TE>
<TE>   Third date: $25</TE>
<TE>   First weekend away together: $2,000</TE>
<TE>   Pregnancy test: $12</TE>
<TE>   Engagement ring: $2,000</TE>
<TE>   Honeymoon: $5,500</TE>
<TE>   Starter home (California): $275,000</TE>
<TE>   Diapers: $3,000 (each kid)</TE>
<TE>   Child care: $24,000 (each child)</TE>
<TE>   Various expenses, like Valentine's gifts and oil changes: $50,000</TE>
<TE>   Braces: $3,000 (each kid)</TE>
<TE>   Marriage counseling: $500</TE>
<TE>   Kids' college educations: $100,000 (each kid)</TE>
<TE>   Daughters' weddings: $30,000 (each bride)</TE>
<TE>   Retirement home: $650,000</TE>
<TE>   His-and-her grave sites: $5,000</TE>
<TE>   TOTAL AVERAGE COST OF TRUE, EVERLASTING LOVE: $1,440,212*</TE>
<TE>   *based on one wife, two daughters, one son</TE>
<TE>   Is love really worth it?</TE>
<TE>   Almost always.</TE>

<HD>Daddies' Girls</HD>
<DH>At a magical Valentine's gathering, fathers and daughters
make memories on the dance floor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEVERLY BEYETTE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The last dance had ended. The deejays were packing up the discs. As
the flower-covered hearts and red and white balloons were being taken
down, a handwritten note was found near the memory book. It read:
"Daddy, you are the only boy I love."</LD>
<LD>   And that's what the Woodland Hills Father-Daughter Valentine Dance
is all about: one magical night each year when little girls put on
their party dresses and step out with their fathers. The red carpet
was rolled out Friday night as 424 dads and daughters began arriving
at the activity center at St. Mel Church for the fourth annual dance.
Girls in velvet and lace--and a tiara or two. Dads in suits--and a
tux or two.</LD>
<LD>   Inside the darkened hall, under flashing strobe lights and a
double arch of balloons, couples crowded the floor, dads extending
their hands to their daughters and asking, "May I have this dance?"</LD>
<TE>   They danced the hokey pokey and the chicken dance, with dads
setting aside their dignity to flap their arms and jump about
clucking. They danced to Bill Haley and the Comets' "Rock Around the
Clock" and to Frank Sinatra singing "My Funny Valentine."</TE>
<TE>   They danced to Britney Spears and, of course, to Al Martino
singing, "You're sugar, you're spice, you're everything nice, you're
daddy's little girl." "All you dads, how long has it been since
you've been surfing?" asked deejay Michael Brooks, spinning the Beach
Boys' "Surfin' USA." This was not cotillion, so anything went,
including lots of enthusiastic jumping around and bouncing up and
down.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Spano of Calabasas, an actor on "NYPD Blue," brought daughter
Liana, 6, a charmer in purple velvet with ribbons in her dark hair.
It was their first time at the event and, Spano said, "She's having a
great time, and I'm having a pretty good time myself." At the moment,
he observed, Liana seemed intent on doing flips on the dance floor,
"which she's not exactly dressed for."</TE>
<TE>   Ponytailed Stewart Dickson, dapper in a three-piece suit, was
taking turns dancing with daughters Price, 13, in a new print dress
with beaded sweater and Maura, 7, in red velvet. "We've been coming
every year," said Dickson, who lives in Calabasas and is a technical
director for Walt Disney feature animation. "Maura just loves to
dance."</TE>
<TE>   Few dads seemed to need the prodding but, just in case, this sign
was posted: "We hope that you enjoy your date with your daughter.
Please take this time to give her your undivided attention. Try not
to preach, teach, lecture or nag! Talk to her about what she wants to
talk about. Relax. Stare into her eyes. Laugh. Dance. Tell her how
beautiful and special she is."</TE>
<TE>   Paul Barrosse, a TV writer-producer who lives in Woodland Hills,
was escorting daughters Emilia, 10, and Eva, 6. Mom Victoria
Zelensky, a TV producer, was working the photo booth, where dads and
daughters posed before a big pink heart. Barrosse recalled the first
of these dances, which was in a small, crowded hall in Woodland
Hills. "It was deathly hot. We were doing the conga line [a
continuing tradition] just to get out of the building and get cool."</TE>
<TE>   Zelensky, one of the four founders of the event, said that mothers
who volunteer to work the dance are instructed "not to interact with
their daughters. Be invisible, please," just this one night.</TE>
<TE>   The dance was the idea of Cathy Nordlund, a stay-at-home mom in
Woodland Hills and mother of Samantha, 10. She happened to hear on
the radio of a similar event in the East. "I got three of my buddies
to go out on a limb with me," she said. They were Zelensky, former
Spago chef Betsy Bowers and Celeste Gosnell, another stay-at-home
mom. Gosnell's three daughters each have dates for the dance--one
with their Dad, and one each with a grandfather. Gosnell's father
flies in each year from Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   Collin St. Johns was carrying a tired Georgina, 5, around the
floor. This was their first time at the event and, said St. Johns, a
real-estate salesman from Woodland Hills, "We're having a great
time." He and friends Dale Bowen and Phil Ginolfi had gone all out,
hiring a white stretch limo to bring their girls to the dance. They'd
had dinner at a neighborhood Italian restaurant where the girls "got
to sit at the piano bar and drink Shirley Temples."</TE>
<TE>   Scanning the hall, St. Johns said, "This is awesome. Look at all
these fathers here." He and Georgina had their photo taken twice, so
both Mom and Dad can have a copy for their desks. Deejays Michael and
Alison Brooks lined up dads and daughters on either side of the dance
floor. "I know we've got some great dancing dads out there," said
Michael, as Alison came down to tap couples for their minute or so of
fame alone on the floor.</TE>
<TE>   Little girls waved their hands like crazy, hoping to be chosen.
And dads showed their mettle, some swinging their daughters around in
midair or between their legs. One father, watching from the
sidelines, asked no one in particular: "Are we insured for that kind
of thing?" By 9 o'clock, two hours into the dance and half an hour
before the last dance, some of the younger girls were cuddling up in
their dads' laps, weary. Others had temporarily deserted their dads
for a good giggle with their girlfriends. Sashes on party dresses
were coming untied. Party shoes were being kicked off.</TE>
<TE>   Marc Shevin, a real-estate agent from Calabasas, danced with
Hanna, 5, a knockout in a pink and fuchsia tie-dyed dress and new
pink cowboy boots. "The boots were a must for tonight," said Shevin,
who also was escorting daughter Sara, 8.</TE>
<TE>   Fathers and daughters danced to the Village People's "YMCA" and to
Sinatra singing "The Way You Look Tonight," to the Baha Men's "Who
Let the Dogs Out?" to Britney Spears' "Oops, I Did It Again" and 'N
Sync's "Pop." Between dances, they ate finger sandwiches and cookies
and drank pink punch.</TE>
<TE>   Midway through the evening, there was a solemn reminder to cherish
every moment. Dads and daughters paused to remember Gabrielle
Caterina Loman, 12, who suffered a fatal seizure. She and her father,
Mitch, had been to all three previous dances. "This year," said the
deejay, "Gabrielle is dancing in heaven." In her honor, he played
their favorite song, "Cherish" by the Association.</TE>
<TE>   Later, as Sinatra sang "The Last Dance," the couples filed out,
dads helping daughters into their wraps. Bob Mullen, a business
consultant from Woodland Hills, had a daughter on each arm--Emily,
10, and Megan, 8. Emily, still aglow, said the best part was "that I
got to spend time with my dad."</TE>
<TE>   About 24 women volunteer to put on the dance. "We're not an
entity," said Nordlund, just a group that comes together once a year.
With tickets only $12, they rely on the kindness of donors, who
provide things such as bottled water and Polaroid film. Bowers is in
charge of food preparation. Decorations are stashed away in garages
and recycled from year to year.</TE>
<TE>   St. Mel Church doesn't charge for use of its hall. The deal: The
dance usually clears $1,000 to $1,500, which is donated to the church
for refinishing of the hall floor. After the dads and daughters
finish stomping around, "it needs it," Nordlund observed.</TE>
<TE>   She spoke of how events like this help forge lifetime bonds
between fathers and daughters, of the long-term impact on the girls'
lives from being treated like princesses, of the importance of "being
treasured, so that at that inevitable point in their life when they
aren't being treasured by a man, they will know what it felt like."</TE>

<HD>Book Celebrates Women Redefining Middle-Age Views</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>BALTIMORE SUN</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The face of 50 has changed since most of us were kids. Heck, the
whole philosophy of 50 has changed.</LD>
<LD>   "There's so much more joy associated with this period of life
now," says Connie Collins, a contributing editor at More magazine, a
publication for women between 40 and 60. "In our mothers' generation,
many women felt life was over at 50. The children were grown, and
there was nothing left to do. But for this generation, life is just
beginning. We're experiencing a rebirth."</LD>
<LD>   This year, about 3.5 million baby boomers will turn 50, some
fairly famous female mugs among them--supermodel Beverly Johnson,
author Amy Tan, former gymnast Cathy Rigby--so Collins and the other
editors at More decided to develop a book that showed the new look
and attitude of the Big 5-0, "Fifty Celebrate Fifty" (Meredith
Books). Inside its pages, 50 women between 47 and 56--many
celebrities (including Meryl Streep, Sally Field and Diane Sawyer)
and some simply deserving of celebration (including archeologist Sue
Hendrickson, attorney Laura Carroll and Episcopal priest Beth
Long)--share their thoughts about age, life and lessons.</LD>
<TE>   Collins, 54, talked with us about putting the book together and
what it means to be in your 50s in the this millennium:</TE>
<TE>   Question: What do you mean by "rebirth"?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: We feel wiser; some women say they feel smarter. Fifty's
not what it used to be. Women have more of a choice now. Many of them
are entering their second or third careers at 50, 50-year-old women
are getting their own shows, I wrote my first book after turning 50.
It's a beginning; it's not the end.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What has changed to make this possible?</TE>
<TE>   A: This is the generation that had the pill. We fought for women's
rights and rights for African Americans. We were the generation first
in Harvard business or law schools, back when there were 10 or 15
women in a graduating class. This is a generation that broke barriers
and changed the rules, and now we've reached middle age and decided
we don't want to get so old so fast.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How does the book show this?</TE>
<TE>   A: It's 50 notable women--some famous, some not famous but notable
in their own right--meant to inspire other women and epitomize what
it means to be a role model. The women in the book look so wonderful.
They're healthier than our mothers were, they eat better, they get
more exercise. Some even talked about having a little work done. It
shows other (50-ish) women that they're not alone and they really are
young.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How did you choose who would be in the book?</TE>
<TE>   A: We wanted to put women representative of our generation in it:
women who'd lost children, changed careers, traveled the world by
themselves, chosen single motherhood over high-powered careers, women
who had babies in their late 40s and adopted in their early 50s,
women who were inspirational.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Like Susan Sarandon, who wrote the book's foreword?</TE>
<TE>   A: Yes, just look at her! My God, not everybody can look like
that. She takes really good care of herself. She has made choices in
her life. She has a partner (Tim Robbins); she doesn't need to get
married. She's a social activist; she marches and is vocal for causes
she believes in. Yet, she's just like the soccer mom in that she has
to juggle one kid's baseball game, another's play and a third's
concert.</TE>
<TE>   Q: The book's subtitle is "Fifty Extraordinary Women Talk About
Facing, Turning and Being Fifty." What can the ordinary woman get
from their stories?</TE>
<TE>   A: I think she can find a little bit of herself in each one of
these women, I really do, and I think she'll find these women
inspirational and say "If she can do that, I can do that" or "I
didn't know that about her." There's a leap year baby (Kathy
Werther-Kapsy) in the book who really thinks she hasn't accomplished
much, but she got pregnant at 17--and where I'm from, that would have
been it for you--and now she's going to get her master's (degree)
this year. There's also a nurse who volunteered in Vietnam who was
just extraordinary and I think inspiring to other nurses.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Did you find any themes throughout your interviewing?</TE>
<TE>   A: One of the themes I found was spirituality. So many of these
women are finding their spiritual selves--Cybill Shepherd, (talk-show
host) Iyanla Vanzant, (former Olympic runner) Madeline Manning Mims,
Reba McEntire. It's part of the journey for many, they've developed
their own sense of a higher purpose in life. And the optimism of the
women was a theme--hard work and optimism and relaxation; so many of
them seemed to have found a balance of those things.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How would you characterize your 50s?</TE>
<TE>   A: I feel so much better now than I did when I was 40. I don't
worry as much; I don't beat myself up when I make a mistake. I've
learned that I'm human and that you just do the best that you can.
Age brings you to that realization; it's an acceptance. You get tired
of fighting the things you've fought all your life and you finally
know the things you can't change. You just let it be, let it go and
focus more on living. In March I'll be 55. I have a new career, I had
a face lift, I lost weight. I feel better at 55 than I did at 50, and
I'm hoping I'll feel even better at 60.</TE>

<LD>Rainy Day Safety</LD>
<LD>   Otto the Auto is a robotic car that visits classes throughout
Southern California, free of charge. Otto teaches children about
traffic safety through songs, blinking headlights and friendly
presentations in English and Spanish. Today he talks to Gabriel and
Avalon about staying safe on rainy days.</LD>
<LD>   The rain had just begun falling when Gabriel and Avalon started
walking to school. Both children enjoyed splashing in puddles and
catching raindrops on their tongues. They had just reached the
crosswalk and were ready to cross when they saw their friend Otto the
Auto.</LD>
<TE>   "Hey, Otto, how do you like the rain?" Gabriel shouted.</TE>
<TE>   "I like it," Otto responded. "While I'm here, I want to remind you
to be safe while crossing the street."</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, Otto," Avalon sighed. "We cross here every day, and every day
we stop, look left, then right, then left again and over our
shoulders. We check to see if a car is coming."</TE>
<TE>   "That's good, but what is different about today?" Otto asked.</TE>
<TE>   "That's easy," Gabriel said. "It's raining."</TE>
<TE>   "Right, and a rainy day means extra safety and taking more time to
look before you cross the street," Otto said. "On rainy days, drivers
have a harder time seeing you. Also, it may take longer to stop the
car on a wet street."</TE>
<TE>   Avalon said, "That's probably why my mom gave us these bright rain
jackets and bright umbrellas--so we can be seen more easily."</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, and bright is just the word to describe you two, like the
sun that's beginning to break through the clouds," Otto laughed.</TE>
<TE>   Visit Otto's Web site at www.aaa-calif.com/otto for parent and
teacher information and fun activities for kids. Principals can
arrange for Otto to visit schools by contacting the Automobile Club
of Southern California at (714) 885-2317.</TE>

<HD>Cop Killer Travels Twisted Path to Freedom</HD>
<DH>Crime* Thomas Trantino, who killed two officers in a New
Jersey bar, is released into a changed world.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL LIEBERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LODI, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Four decades ago, after the killings on the Sin Strip here, no one
could have imagined that Thomas Trantino would ever go free, as he
did this week.</LD>
<LD>   The issue back then was whether he would die for what he did--and
how.</LD>
<LD>   President Kennedy was in the White House, and Martin Luther King
Jr. was days away from giving his "I Have a Dream" speech when
Trantino and another ex-con pulled a robbery in Brooklyn and headed
to New Jersey to celebrate. They landed in the inaptly named Angel
Lounge on Route 46, where bars used to stay open till dawn. Frank
Falco placed a $50 bill on the counter, and the partying began.</LD>
<TE>   A neighbor thought someone was shooting off fireworks. He called
the police with a noise complaint at 2:30 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Sgt. Peter Voto, 40, had wrestled for the local high school and
served in the Navy before joining the force. A father of three, he
worked night patrols, 8 p.m. to 4 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Tedesco was only 21 and a trainee, due to get his uniform and
gun a week later. He carried only a flashlight on Aug. 20, 1963, when
he rode with Voto to Route 46.</TE>
<TE>   Voto made it through the sea battles of WWII but did not survive
the Angel Lounge. Tedesco wound up wearing his uniform for the first
time at his own funeral.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, a noose was spotted in Lodi police headquarters. Such
was the rage over New Jersey's most notorious crime since the
kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby.</TE>
<TE>   A dragnet found Frank Falco across the Hudson River, in a hotel
near Times Square. New York police said he resisted when they woke
him, and they had no choice but to shoot him six times.</TE>
<TE>   Trantino had enough sense to turn himself in. He had a lawyer and
photographer with him when he surrendered at a Manhattan precinct
house. Half-Italian, half-Jewish and dubbed "The Rabbi, " he looked
like a hood out of the old Jimmy Cagney movies in his gray suit,
white shirt and dark glasses.</TE>
<TE>   When reporters shouted questions, he said, "My mother and father
are over there. Don't you have any decency?" A voice shot back,
"Don't you?"</TE>
<TE>   His lawyer argued he'd been made insane by pills and alcohol and
that Falco fired the fatal shots, but a jury took only seven hours to
find the 25-year-old guilty of murder, and with no recommendation of
mercy they condemned him to the electric chair. And who could argue?</TE>
<TE>   By all accounts, he had set off the massacre after the sergeant
discovered a gun wrapped in a bar towel. Witnesses said he grabbed
Voto from behind and pistol-whipped him to the ground, yelling, "We
are burning all the way!"</TE>
<TE>   It looked like he would burn after they took him to death row on
Feb. 29, 1964, but he was still there in 1972, kept alive by appeals,
when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned death penalty statutes across
the country. Though executions resumed by 1977, 600 inmates
nationwide had their reprieves secured.</TE>
<TE>   Just as Charles Manson and his followers were spared in
California, Trantino's sentence was reduced to life in prison in New
Jersey at a time when life did not necessarily mean life.</TE>
<TE>   Thus began a parole battle like few others.</TE>
<TE>   There was a long lineup ready to proclaim why Trantino should rot:
victims' families, police organizations, governors and a state
Legislature that passed two "Trantino laws" to make sure no cop
killer ever again had even the hope of freedom.</TE>
<TE>   Long after the crime, it could still draw a crowd chanting "Kill!
Kill!," as Newark-born attorney Roger Lowenstein found out in 1982,
the first time he entered a courthouse on Trantino's behalf.
Lowenstein has represented the convicted killer for no fee for the
past 20 years, staying on the case even after he switched coasts to
pursue a second career as a TV writer, on "L.A. Law" and other shows.</TE>
<TE>   But it would be hard for any fictional script to match the twists
in this real-life case, especially how the rabid killer become one of
his state's best behaved inmates: registering hardly a single
infraction for 32 years, designing programs to help young offenders
and coming to function "more as a staff member in the prison than as
an inmate," as one of the 57 psychological studies of him put it.</TE>
<TE>   Trantino also wrote a book about his life and made paintings that
have been displayed in galleries in Europe and Japan, though those
parts of his record may not have helped his cause--his writing and
art only inflamed groups that saw him as another killer seeking to
profit off the blood of victims while "playing the system" with his
good behavior act. Again, who could blame them?</TE>
<TE>   "Punishment is the word of the day," Trantino himself noted just
last week. "Don't put them in prison--put them under the prison."</TE>
<TE>   During his 39 years in custody, American society has grown
skeptical of claims of redemption, or rehabilitation, or of the whole
concept of parole, especially for killers. In the age of spin, hardly
anyone can be believed, much less people like him. The new political
climate says there is no atoning for some crimes.</TE>
<TE>   So he stayed locked up longer than any inmate in New Jersey, until
Monday, when he made his ceremonial walk away from a halfway house in
Camden.</TE>
<TE>   Small Town Rocked by Murder of Officers</TE>
<TE>   A crime's impact often goes beyond the obvious, the widowed
spouses and orphaned children. When the brother of the slain sergeant
said the killings "destroyed two families," he understated the
fallout in Lodi, a town of 20,000 developed around the United Piece
Dye Works. The factory eventually closed, but the workers stayed, and
their families intermarried in a community that defined "tightknit."
One of the officers called to the Angel Lounge was Tedesco's cousin.
Voto had a cousin on the ambulance crew. And his brother, Andy,
eventually become chief of police.</TE>
<TE>   Andy Voto never forgot how, as a little boy, Pete "walked me to
school on my first day." Not long before the murders, his 7-year-old
daughter died, and the deaths joined in his mind. He couldn't bring
himself to hug his mother. "There was no sign of love left in me," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Andy recalled a man telling him at Pete's funeral that his brother
was in heaven and that they should "pray for his murderer." He had to
keep from slugging the guy.</TE>
<TE>   Over the decades, Andy tried to come to all the demonstrations to
demand justice--preferably death--for Trantino. He could barely
express what he felt when heard suggestions that the murders that
devastated so many had, in a sense, helped the killer. Voto did not
doubt that prison could be good for a former heroin addict and
robber, or that a high school dropout might become "jailhouse smart."
But to hear Trantino's lawyer portray him as an inmate who had
"changed himself forever" was something else.</TE>
<TE>   Even after he retired and had a stroke, Andy Voto would lean on
his walker and say to the TV cameras, "Trantino, I hate your guts,
and I'll follow you to the grave."</TE>
<TE>   Rebellious Prisoner in a Tempestuous Era</TE>
<TE>   Trantino was rebellious through the '60s, his death row years, and
was often thrown in the hole for breaking rules. He refused to cut
his wildly curling hair and wrote stream-of-consciousness letters to
his lawyers or authorities. The old-style hood morphed into a
jailhouse Yippie prankster.</TE>
<TE>   One letter requested an eight-foot flag for his cell and a
recording of Kate Smith's "God Bless America." Trantino complained
that "the world is falling apart at the seams, crime is rampant and
sex is running all over the streets. All authority have broke down .
. . Law and order (with equality and justice for all, of course) is
on the wane."  A prison supervisor wrote back commending his "show of
patriotism."</TE>
<TE>   About the time the death penalty was thrown out, Trantino's
letters and Picasso-esque drawings were published by Knopf under the
title "Lock the Lock."</TE>
<TE>   It was a time when books by inmates were in vogue, from Eldridge
Cleaver's "Soul on Ice" to the novels of France's Jean Genet. The
life of crime was often portrayed as a reflection of society and
prison conditions as a mirror of oppression outside. Trantino became
friends with another New Jersey inmate, boxer Rubin "Hurricane"
Carter, whose autobiography would proclaim his innocence well before
his conviction was, in fact, thrown out.</TE>
<TE>   But any efforts to present authorship as evidence of an inmate's
worthiness for freedom suffered a fatal blow when Norman Mailer and
others touted the brilliance of Utah killer Jack Abbott, whose
letters became "In the Belly of the Beast." Abbott was feted in New
York after his 1981 release--then stabbed a man to death.</TE>
<TE>   Public attitudes were in flux. By 1988, George Bush would win the
presidency in part by blaming Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis for
Willie Horton, a convicted killer who raped a woman while on a
furlough. After that, it was a brave politician who argued for
release of any killer.</TE>
<TE>   Caught in the Web of State Parole Board</TE>
<TE>   Trantino became eligible for parole in 1979. He was 41 and no
longer quite the rebel.</TE>
<TE>   After earning "full minimum" status, he was assigned to an honor
camp, where he was trusted enough to escort young offenders--69
times--on work and recreation details. On a trip to the beach, he
saved a girl struggling in the surf. Later, the New Jersey Supreme
Court said he had "no rules infractions since 1970," no alcohol or
drug violations and had "completed 17 programs designed to enable him
to help fellow inmates."</TE>
<TE>   Trantino's prison record would have been irrelevant under the
life-without-parole sentence coming into style. But he had been
resentenced under old statutes that downplayed retribution in favor
of "reformation and rehabilitation."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, in order to keep him in prison, New Jersey had the burden
of showing "a substantial likelihood" he would commit a crime if
released. Otherwise, he was supposed to go free.</TE>
<TE>   One by one, the others reprieved off death row were paroled under
that criteria. Not Trantino.</TE>
<TE>   The Parole Board did vote 3-2 to release him in 1980, provided he
pay restitution to the families. They wanted no part of such a deal.
Police groups were outraged also. Rumors circulated that the dead men
had been sexually mutilated--or urinated on--though there was no
evidence of such. The board changed its mind, nonetheless: Trantino
would have to serve another 10 years to satisfy "punitive aspects" of
his sentence.</TE>
<TE>   But Trantino was assured that would be it. Unless he exhibited
"aberrant behavior," the board chairman said, "we are now looking at
a day when you will be released."</TE>
<TE>   He wasn't, though. His next time back, the board decided he needed
more drug counseling.</TE>
<TE>   His next time, they hit him with a Catch-22. The board agreed that
he had, in fact, reached his "rehabilitative potential" in prison--it
merely needed to see how he did in a halfway house. The catch? Prison
officials refused to send him to one.</TE>
<TE>   One parole official suggested he sue. "You've done what you've
needed to do," the man said. "This case has never been treated the
same way as any other."</TE>
<TE>   Only in 1995 did the corrections department explain its refusal to
send him to a less-secure facility: "Letters ... warning that Mr.
Trantino would be killed."</TE>
<TE>   When the state Supreme Court found the explanation inadequate,
Trantino was moved to a screening center. That's when Gov. Christine
Todd Whitman declared her "surprise" and urged the attorney general
to review the transfer. He ordered a new psychological exam of the
inmate who'd had dozens.</TE>
<TE>   The state Legislature passed its first law inspired by the case in
1996, abolishing parole for anyone who kills a police officer.
Another in 2000 took away any chance of parole to any murderer whose
death sentence was overturned in the future. "No more Trantinos!" was
the cry.</TE>
<TE>   The state was not through trying to hold the real one, either.
Parole officials went back over every piece of paper on him, from his
work record as a 7-year-old to reports by his former wife that he
abused her in 1963. Suddenly the board had five new grounds to deny
release, including his failure to deal with the domestic violence 37
years earlier. It also cited his "history of being less than candid"
about events in the Angel Lounge.</TE>
<TE>   During his trial, Trantino testified that he was high on Dexedrine
and double shots of whiskey and could not remember the shootings. He
didn't believe witnesses who said he shot Voto. "I was never a
killer, no way," he kept saying even a decade after his trial. "I
played the role of the tough guy. That just wasn't me."</TE>
<TE>   Later on, even his lawyer told him how offensive his stance was.
"He made his sound like he was a victim," Lowenstein said, "when no
matter how you looked at it, he was responsible for both murders."</TE>
<TE>   Though Trantino never changed his story that the night was largely
blacked out to him, by 1999 he was almost going overboard in
professing his guilt.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, I shot and killed both men," he told the parole board.</TE>
<TE>   "You're sure?" he was asked.</TE>
<TE>   "I am sure."</TE>
<TE>   For the board, this became "inconsistent testimony," one more
reason to keep him.</TE>
<TE>   When the case came before the state Supreme Court a final time,
Deputy Atty. Gen. Howard McCoach told the justices that Trantino
appeared to be a "charming, beguiling, charismatic" man but was "a
schemer, a plotter, a manipulator.</TE>
<TE>   The families however, could sense what was coming after those
Sept. 25, 2000 arguments. Tedesco's mother sat in a wheelchair,
holding a painting of her dead boy while one of Voto's sons reminded
reporters of another New Jersey inmate and author, Edgar Smith. He
won his release and moved to California, where he stabbed a woman.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a caged animal," Jerry Voto said of Trantino. "If they want
to go by the letter of the law--12 people found him guilty and he was
supposed to be executed."</TE>
<TE>   Later, the court was respectful of such emotions as it ordered
Trantino's transfer to a halfway house for a year, and then parole.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not underestimate the pain and anguish that our disposition
is likely to cause," the 4-1 decision said. But he should have been
free years earlier, it concluded.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter how great the pressure, agencies of government cannot
ignore the law in special cases," the court wrote. "At its core, this
case is more about the rule of law than it is about Thomas Trantino."</TE>
<TE>   Andy Voto was not well enough to make the hearing. He admitted to
fantasizing, though, about running into his brother's killer. "I
can't say it didn't pass through my mind in the heat of the thing.
But vengeance takes a different position in your life as time goes
by," the retired chief said.</TE>
<TE>   "I would be as bad as him if I went there and killed him in cold
blood."</TE>
<TE>   His living room wall reminds him of the daughter and brother he
lost. He wouldn't want to miss seeing them in heaven.</TE>
<TE>   Resuming His Life After 39 Years in Custody</TE>
<TE>   Trantino knows there's little he can say to the families. Words
"can't bring back the person they love. And that's what they want."</TE>
<TE>   He said he feels like the mythological character whom Camus writes
of in "The Myth of Sisyphus" whose plight is to push a boulder to the
top of a mountain only to see it fall back, then have to do it again,
for eternity.</TE>
<TE>   "Sisyphus was being punished for his sins. But Camus says he finds
his freedom when he's coming down the mountain, to roll it up again."
Trantino tries to stay "coming down the mountain ... in the freedom
of the moment."</TE>
<TE>   The state announced his release date as Tuesday, but that was to
keep spectators away. He went on parole a day earlier, his 64th
birthday. He was a free man, technically, when he carried his laptop
out the door of the halfway house that morning. He will begin work
Monday as a counselor for young offenders.</TE>
<TE>   A good diet has kept his weight at 185 pounds, he said, same as
when he went in at 25. He meditates.</TE>
<TE>   He will be on parole the rest of his life with a slew of
restrictions, including no alcohol, no bars and no going to Bergen
County, where Lodi is located. If they catch him in the smallest
violation, he knows, he'll be back in.</TE>
<TE>   His mother is dead, but he hopes to see his father, who is 89 and
in a nursing home. He may eventually settle in Staten Island, near
other family. One of his favorite sayings is "Happy spring!," so he
wants to hear the birds and see the flowers.</TE>
<TE>   He has an invitation to produce an art show in Tokyo if he's ever
allowed to leave the country. He wants to visit California, where
Lowenstein has put aside scriptwriting to open a "social justice"
charter school for poor children, many from homeless shelters.</TE>
<TE>   But his more immediate plans were modest: "To see my parole
officer and do what my parole officer tells me to do. Then I'm going
to continue my life. Just be a better person every day.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing to celebrate."</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU>DICK LOCHTE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stephen J. Cannell's "The Viking Funeral" (St. Martin's, $24.95, 400
pages) is the sort of fast and furious read you might expect from one
of television's most successful and inventive writer-producers. It's
the second book in the continuing saga of Shane Scully, an LAPD
detective so at odds with the system that he gets even less respect
than Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch.</LD>
<LD>   Still rocky from the physical and mental pummeling he suffered in
"The Tin Collectors," Scully takes a spin along the Ventura Freeway
and spies a familiar face one lane over. It belongs to Jody Dean, who
was his closest friend "from Little League through the Police
Academy." The unusual aspect of this sighting is that Dean supposedly
died by his own hand two years ago. Naturally, no one believes
Scully.</LD>
<LD>   His persistent search for proof of his pal's resurrection widens
this credibility gap, alienates him further from the force and, when
he starts to uncover the secret behind Jody's "suicide," places him
and his loved ones in peril.</LD>
<TE>   In creating such TV series as "Ten Speed and Brown Shoe" and "The
A-Team," Cannell seemed to delight in turning pop fiction concepts on
their ear. Here, consciously or not, he samples bits and pieces from
a variety of successful mysteries and thrillers--ranging from Agatha
Christie's "What Mrs. McGillicuddy Saw!" to Graham Greene's "The
Third Man"--and uses them to fashion an effective action-adventure
tale built around male bonding and a mind-boggling scam involving
rogue policemen, drug-laundering and tobacco company skulduggery, the
last, he says, based on fact.</TE>
<TE>   Given that, the author lets his imagination roam free in
concocting an assortment of unique cops and robbers, as well as
original suspenseful situations. The one minor annoyance may be a
reaction to all those years of scriptwriting, an overuse of something
not allowed by his former gig--passages devoted to his hero's thought
processes. As Hemingway and Hammett, among others, have proven, when
the dialogue is good and the action flowing fast, a lot of mental
meandering merely gets in the way.</TE>
<TE>   If you think you've got troubles, check out Joanne Kuhlman, the
protagonist of Nancy Taylor Rosenberg's new novel, "Conflict of
Interest" (Hyperion, $24.95, 312 pages). The Ventura County
prosecutor's soon-to-be ex-husband, a computer wiz in jail for
embezzling and for absconding with their two children, may have hired
someone to kill her. Their son and older daughter, now living with
her after a long separation, are not happy kids. The boy feels
abandoned, the 15-year-old girl, who is pregnant, is loyal to her
father.</TE>
<TE>   On top of that, our heroine thinks that one of the three young men
she's trying for armed robbery may be the innocent dupe of the
others. She's also beginning to fall in love with the dupe's defense
attorney. This may sound as if Rosenberg has gone a bit over the top
in piling on the grief, but, actually, the book, unlike a couple of
her other novels, is pretty effective.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutor Kuhlman is a likable, humane protagonist. There's an
unusual guardian angel watching over her, an enigmatic unlicensed but
effective bodyguard named Eli. The main villains in the piece, two
brothers as devious as they are sociopathic, are frighteningly real.
And the domestic situations have the ring of truth. The author keeps
the action moving from Joanne to the evil brothers and their naive
co-defendant to the resourceful Eli--none of whom behaves in any
predictable way, which makes for fascinating reading.</TE>
<TE>   Hard-boiled heroine Nina Zero was headed for prison at the
fade-out of her last caper, Robert M. Eversz's "Shooting Elvis"
(1996). Among other things, she'd unwittingly been responsible for
blowing up a large part of LAX. She's at large and almost in charge
in the author's new "Killing Paparazzi" (St. Martin's Minotaur,
$23.95, 310 pages). Tougher than beef jerky and considerably more
cynical and wary than when she entered stir, Nina is quick to accept
$2,000 for marrying a British photographer in need of a green card.
They part on less than friendly terms, but when he becomes victim No.
3 in a series of paparazzi murders, she, by then a member of the
shutterbug trade herself, decides to hunt down the killer.</TE>
<TE>   All the standard thriller elements are present, but Eversz's
sardonic style and contemporary noir attitude transform them into
fresh and flippant entertainment. "Killing," like its predecessor, is
a street-smart, razor-sharp combination of crime fiction and Southern
California social commentary.</TE>
<TE>   Here's narrator Nina on vanity billboards and the power of
celebrity: "Further down Sunset, Madonna strained against her plywood
frame with breasts big enough to crush small cars, Nathan Lane mugged
with a mouse the size of a killer whale and the 30-foot-tall
sunglassed face of Jack Nicholson howled at the moon. One Halloween
or Oscar night they might come alive, leap free of the plywood, paint
and paper that bound them, and with bodies to match the size of their
stardom trample Hollywood to dust."</TE>

and its sequel, "Laughing Dog" (Poisoned Pen Press), reviews
mysteries every other Wednesday.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Your heart just has to go out to ... geez, where to begin?</LD>
<LD>   There are so many people to feel sorry for these days, and, hey,
I'd like to help everyone. But that's not possible, so I'm limiting
my advice to those folks whose situations pull particularly hard on
the old heartstrings. Such as:</LD>
<LD>   * Kenneth Lay: Kenny Boy, after people get done suing you, you may
be forced to live on odd jobs, Social Security and your $475,042
annual lifetime pension. Just don't fall into the trap of relying on
credit cards to make ends meet. Granted, this will be hard for you,
what with the temptation to amass the appearance of wealth through
plastic pyramid schemes. Oh, and tell your wife to use an extra cup
of bread crumbs with the meatloaf. It will make it go a lot further.</LD>
<TE>   * John Ashcroft: Mr. Attorney General, putting $8,000 worth of
curtains on statues in the Hall of Justice is not only expensive,
it's major-league weird.</TE>
<TE>   Still, if you insist on playing Barbies with the "Spirit of
Justice," why not dress her in a sassy little push-up number from
Victoria's Secret? The lingerie, which could be changed periodically,
would really add some much-needed pizazz to your news briefings.</TE>
<TE>   * Andersen accountants: Hasn't it occurred to any of you that
trying to change your reputation is a bad idea? If people out there
in the business world ever get the impression you folks have gone
straight, you'll be toes up in no time. Nobody wants a Boy Scout
accountant. They want you. They want someone who can make 2 plus 2
equal $1.6 billion.</TE>
<TE>   * Martha Stewart: Well, girlfriend, with Kmart on the ropes, I see
where your shares of Martha Stewart Living are now only worth $520
million. This is not a good thing. But you can always go back to
catering, or decorating pool bottoms with cut-up credit cards.</TE>
<TE>   * Dick Cheney: Sure, Punxsutawney Phil is seeing more sunlight
than you these days.</TE>
<TE>   But think about it this way. You're the one they're keeping super
safe. The other guy is the one they parade out in public. What's that
tell you?</TE>
<TE>   * Mariah Carey: Hey, nobody ever said it was easy being a diva.
What you have to learn to accept, is that for most people when a
business partner hands them $28 million to end a relationship, it's
not considered a setback. On the other hand, lip-synching the
national anthem at the Super Bowl is.</TE>
<TE>   * The detainees: You were herded onto planes by testy, autocratic
men and women in uniform. You were crammed into uncomfortable seats
for a long flight. You arrived at your destination only to find the
accommodations less than desirable.</TE>
<TE>   Fellas, you are right to protest. This may be war, but there is no
reason you should be treated like common tourists.</TE>

<HD>The Day the Dragon Danced</HD>
<DH>Part 3 The story so far: Grandma and her grandson Charles
are watching the Chinese New Year's Parade. Her grandson wants to see
the dragon dance. Grandma grumbles and complains as they wait.</DH>

<LD>Craaack! Snap! Snap! Snap! Crackkkle! Pow!</LD>
<LD>   I jumped about a foot. Firecrackers were popping all around.</LD>
<LD>   "Oh, my heart!" Grandma said. Then she laughed.</LD>
<TE>   A red firetruck with red and gold paper decorations snorted slowly
down the road. A lot of pretty girls were on the truck. They wore
shiny red satin dresses. Some had long black hair, and some had brown
and one had yellow. They smiled and waved and threw money into the
street. I ran out to pick up a new penny. "Here, Grandma," I said,
handing it to her. "This means you'll have lots of money in the New
Year."</TE>
<TE>   "I surely can use some of that, child." Grandma smiled and put the
lucky penny in her purse. Then she rubbed me on the head.</TE>
<TE>   But where was the dragon?</TE>
<TE>   A clang of cymbals announced the dragon.</TE>
<TE>   "Grandma, look!"</TE>
<TE>   The dragon's huge red, green, white and orange head stuck around
the corner. His big white teeth shone in his wide open mouth. His big
red eyes looked from side to side. Below his chin hung his long white
beard.</TE>
<TE>   "Look! look!" I yelled.</TE>
<TE>   The dragon raised his head high, then brought it down low; then he
moved it from side to side. His eyes rolled some more. "He's looking
for bad things to eat up, Grandma." I giggled excitedly and grabbed
Grandma's coat sleeve. The cymbals crashed and clanged for the dragon
to keep time with his many, many feet.</TE>
<TE>   "Better watch out, child, you can be pretty bad sometimes."
Quickly she tickled me around the middle and I jumped.</TE>
<TE>   Now we could see that the dragon was moving along on a long, long,
long row of legs. They all wore red socks, but each pair of legs had
on a different kind of athletic shoe.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday: Why does the dragon have so many different kinds of
shoes?</TE>
<TE>   Kay Haugaard loves Chinese dragons. Their bright colors and
dancing make her happy. This story will be on The Times' Web site at

<HD>Accidents Up for Teen Girls</HD>
<DH>Possible factors cited in the higher rate include increased
time behind the wheel and media influences.</DH>

<LD>Natalie Finegood was running late and facing a test at high school.</LD>
<LD>   So she put a list of vocabulary words on her lap and started
taking advantage of traffic signals to cram.</LD>
<LD>   She wasn't watching the lights, so when she heard the other cars
around her at an intersection accelerate, she did the same.</LD>
<TE>   One small problem: With eyes focused on the vocabulary list
instead of the road, she failed to notice a slow-moving vehicle
directly ahead of her.</TE>
<TE>   "I rear-ended a trash truck," says Finegood, now 17, describing
the accident that occurred in July 2000 when she had had her driver's
license for just four months.</TE>
<TE>   Finegood's 1994 Ford Explorer was fixable and no one was hurt. And
the accident, she says, "made me more aware of events on the road."
With the exception of a speeding ticket, she's driven without
incident since the accident.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles teen's driving record reflects a troubling
nationwide statistic: The youngest female drivers are crashing more
often. Although their accident rates don't yet match those of teenage
boys, safety experts and parents view the trend as disturbing.</TE>
<TE>   Exactly why teen girls are becoming riskier drivers is a matter of
debate--some experts blame movie and TV portrayals of aggressive
driving, some say it's simply that teen girls now drive more miles
than in the past, and others insist that the new statistics are but a
blip on the radar screen and that girls' accident rates are heading
back down.</TE>
<TE>   But for now there's an upward trend.</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, 16% of 16-year-old girl drivers were involved in traffic
accidents, according to statistics from the Insurance Institute for
Highway Safety, an independent organization funded by auto insurers.</TE>
<TE>   By 2000, the figure was 17.5%. In the same period, the percentage
of 16-year-old boys involved in accidents dropped from 21.6% to 21%,
says safety institute spokesman Russ Rader.</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, teen males have paid higher auto insurance premiums
than teen females, reflecting their higher risk. But that gap is
closing. In 1985, male drivers ages 16 to 20 paid 61% higher premiums
than females in the same age range, says Dick Luedke, a spokesman for
State Farm Insurance Co.</TE>
<TE>   By 2000, the difference was down to 41%.</TE>
<TE>   But Luedke says most of the increase in females' premiums occurred
between 1985 and 1995 and that the rate of increase may be leveling
off.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts say there's a practical explanation for the increased
accident rate among young females: They're are simply driving more
miles than they used to. That trend is expected to continue.</TE>
<TE>   In 1977, licensed female drivers ages 16 to 19 drove an average of
4,036 miles a year, Rader says. By 1995, the national average annual
mileage among the same age group was 6,870 miles. (If this sounds low
to Southern California parents, Rader points out that it is a
national average and that teen drivers from smaller cities and rural
towns pull down the average considerably.)</TE>
<TE>   Other driving experts say there's more to the rise in risky female
driving than mileage alone.</TE>
<TE>   Media and culture that promote a new, more aggressive female also
are to blame, says Leon James, professor of psychology at the
University of Hawaii and a veteran researcher of road rage and other
driving behavior.</TE>
<TE>   The aggression portrayed in car chases and other common scenes, he
says, is imitated by teens of both genders.</TE>
<TE>   The type of vehicle driven may also affect driving behavior and,
in turn, crash rates, James says. In his surveys, he has found those
who drive SUVs and sports cars say they feel more aggression than did
drivers of other vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Even more troubling, he says, is that the drivers of these
vehicles have told him that driving aggressively made them feel more
competent as drivers.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey Arnett, an independent scholar affiliated with the
University of Maryland who has studied teen behavior extensively,
takes issue with what he calls the media's habit of romanticizing
driving risk.</TE>
<TE>   A prime example, he says, are car commercials that emphasize a
vehicle's speed. Other factors that might influence the rising crash
rate of young female drivers, Arnett says, is socialization that
includes "less pressure to be girly."</TE>
<TE>   And some risky driving behavior, he adds, is associated with
immaturity, not gender.</TE>
<TE>   "Both boys and girls in this age group take more risk," Arnett
says. "They incur infractions for such behaviors as speeding."</TE>
<TE>   Arnett, like the other experts, points out that boys remain the
riskiest young drivers.</TE>
<TE>   Driver education and traffic school instructors agree.</TE>
<TE>   "Boys are more aggressive [drivers] than girls," says Elizabeth
Lomer, operator of the Ford Driving School in Hollywood, which offers
driver education training in addition to traffic school classes for
motorists who get moving violation tickets for such infractions as
speeding and want to wipe the slate clean with the Department of
Motor Vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   A typical teenage traffic school class there, she says, is 90%
male. In her years as a driving instructor, she found boys tend to be
more impulsive behind the wheel and girls more hesitant--which can
lead to safer driving.</TE>
<TE>   "Girls tend to pay more attention to the actual lesson," says Mike
Abramian, owner-operator of the USA Driving School in Burbank.</TE>
<TE>   "That might be because some girls, on entering driver's education,
have never driven at all. Boys somehow manage to get into the car"
and drive before they get a permit, he says.</TE>
<TE>   Even though teens attend driver's education classes in order to
get an instructional permit and license before they turn 18, there is
no evidence that such programs reduce the teen accident rate, says
Rader of the Insurance Institute.</TE>
<TE>   That's probably because the emphasis is on teaching basic driving
skills and not on addressing immaturity or teens' "penchant for risk
taking," he says.</TE>
<TE>   But parental example does count, says James of the University of
Hawaii: "The way 16-year-olds drive reflects how their parents drove
them."</TE>
<TE>   Natalie Finegood, the teen who became more safety conscious after
she crashed into a trash truck, says her driving style is more like
her father's than her mother's, but that other family members also
can have an influence.</TE>
<TE>   "I spent much of my time [as a younger teen] being driven around
by my brother, who's now 21." That's when, she says, she may have
picked up the speeding habit she hopes she's kicked.</TE>

<HD>Auto Makers Go for the Sleek in Chicago</HD>
<DH>Car show* Trucks and SUVs on display feature a smooth look
that demonstrates that they too can sport something new.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUEJONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>The sleek, streamlined look is migrating from passenger cars to
compact and large trucks. It's starting to show up in some vehicles,
and is promised for others under development.</LD>
<LD>   A variety of production and concept models unveiled at the Chicago
Auto Show last week reflected this latest attempt by auto makers to
develop products to stand out in an increasingly me-too market.</LD>
<LD>   Examples included the Kia Sorento, an SUV that will go on sale in
the U.S. later this year (Highway 1, Feb. 6) and a "step-side"
version of the Toyota Tundra--a design that softens the slab-sided
truck with wide flared rear fenders and a step molded into the side
of the bed for easy access.</LD>
<TE>   Auto makers aren't ignoring their cars, either. Even Pontiac, long
noted for its widespread use of ribbed plastic body cladding, is
shedding its skin--at least that was the promise Robert A. Lutz,
General Motors Corp. vice chairman and product development guru, made
in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   A trio of vehicles that illustrate the new direction came to
Chicago from Detroit, Tokyo and Seoul.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Less Boxy</TE>
<TE>   Subaru Forester</TE>
<TE>   First up, Subaru's completely redesigned Forester: the latest
production SUV to show sleeker lines, with stylish, trapezoidal
headlights reminiscent of the new Chevy Trailblazer, though the two
were designed independently.</TE>
<TE>   Slightly less boxy than its predecessor, the 2003 Forester's body
is strengthened with a reinforced frame but made lighter with use of
aluminum. Although the external dimensions are the same, it has more
interior passenger space than its predecessor.</TE>
<TE>   "It's on the same platform, but it handles much, much better,"
said Kyoji Takenaka, president of Tokyo-based Fuji Heavy Industries,
Subaru's parent.</TE>
<TE>   Subaru is aiming to sell about 5,000 more cars in the U.S. than
last year's 186,000 mark. To do so in what is expected to be a
declining market, it will have to take its share out of competitors'
hides.</TE>
<TE>   It is expecting to do so with new or redesigned models: the
Forester goes on sale in May and will be followed in August by the
all-new Baja, based on the Legacy Outback wagon but with a small
pickup truck bed instead of the wagon's enclosed cargo area.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Terra4 Features</TE>
<TE>   Contoured Wells</TE>
<TE>   Although General Motors Corp.'s GMC Terra4 is industrial looking
in keeping with that division's design themes, its appearance is
softened by a swept-back windshield and contoured wheel wells.</TE>
<TE>   The Terra4's name comes from a convergence of "fours:" four doors,
four-wheel drive, four-wheel steering and four ways to load the cargo
bed--through the top, sides, rear or mid-gate that separates the bed
from the rear seat.</TE>
<TE>   The concept truck "challenges the conventional idea of what a
truck is," said GM North America President Gary Cowger.</TE>
<TE>   Its theoretical power plant is a hybrid gasoline engine-electric
motor combination that saves on fuel but provides V8 power, a system
GMC has been showing on its recent concepts.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Airplane Inspires</TE>
<TE>   Hyundai's Entry</TE>
<TE>   South Korea's Hyundai Motors showed a super-luxury concept built
off the Equus luxury car sold only in South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Designed at Hyundai California Design in Irvine, the sculpted
concept for a large coupe is "our vision of what a luxury car can be
... [with the] theme of the body inspired by the fuselage of an
airplane," said senior designer Roger Flores.</TE>
<TE>   Hyundai, which has seen sales soar in recent years because of an
aggressive warranty program and an equally aggressive effort to
introduce new vehicles such as the hot-selling Santa Fe sport-utility
and to redesign existing vehicles such as the Accent, Elantra and
Sonata passenger cars to reflect modern tastes, also reiterated its
plan to start building some of its vehicles in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Byung-ho Sung, Hyundai's chief operating officer for international
operations, said the company has narrowed its search for a factory
site to four states: Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi and Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   Building Hyundai cars in the U.S. will help Americans become more
familiar with them, he said.</TE>

<HD>Potentially Faulty Sensors Prompt Nissan to Recall Some
Sentras</HD>
<DH>Safety*  Engine on 2000, 2001 models may stop while car is
moving. No injuries linked to parts have been reported.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A pair of potentially faulty sensors that could cause the engine to
stop while the car is in motion has prompted Nissan Motor Co. to
recall 103,000 of its model year 2000 and 2001 Sentra sedans in the
U.S.</LD>
<LD>   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced the
voluntary action as part of its monthly list of automotive recalls,
published to alert motorists who might have missed manufacturers'
notices.</LD>
<LD>   Other recalls on the latest list, which covers recalls reported to
or ordered by NHTSA in November, are four from Hyundai Motor Co., one
from DaimlerChrysler's Jeep brand, one from BMW and one from
Mitsubishi Motors Corp.</LD>
<TE>   Nissan said an additional 13,000 Sentras sold in Canada and an
unspecified number of Nissan models using the same four-cylinder
engine and sold in Europe and Asia also are being recalled for the
same faulty sensors.</TE>
<TE>   No accidents or injuries linked to sensor malfunction have been
reported, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   Nissan is sending letters to owners of the affected cars, asking
them to visit their local dealers for free replacement of the engine
camshaft and crankshaft timing sensors.</TE>
<TE>   Hyundai, South Korea's largest auto maker, recalled 86,000 Sonata
sedans from the 1999 through 2001 model years for a faulty air bag
warning light that could activate unnecessarily; 42,782 Tiburon
sports coupes from 1997 through 2001 for potentially faulty seat belt
retractors that could cause the belts to become tangled; and 26,608
Accent models from 2000 and 2001 to correct a problem that could
cause excessively high engine idle speed in cold climates.</TE>
<TE>   The company also has recalled 1,900 of its 2001 model XG300 sedans
to correct improperly manufactured powertrain control modules. The
XG300 is nearly complete, said spokesman Mike Anson.</TE>
<TE>   DaimlerChrysler recalled 38,700 of its model year 2002 Jeep Grand
Cherokees to inspect for and correct potentially leaky fuel filler
tube.</TE>
<TE>   NHTSA said BMW is recalling 1,318 of its 2002 model 5-Series
sedans manufactured with standard suspensions in September and
October because of a problem with the tire mounting process that
could cut the outer sidewall surface of some tires.</TE>
<TE>   Dealers will inspect all five tires for a possible cut and replace
them if needed. Owner notification began Dec. 10. BMW spokesman David
Buchko said that the recall is voluntary and that there have been no
reports of any tire failures, accidents or injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Mitsubishi recalled 18,630 Mirage sedans and coupes from 1999
through 2001 for inspection and replacement of a crankshaft pulley
bolt that could loosen, resulting in loss of power steering.</TE>

<HD>For Teen Drivers, There's  No Safety in Numbers</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although adult researchers are pretty much unanimous in pegging teen
male drivers as more accident-prone than their female counterparts,
teens themselves are divided about which gender is worse on the road.</LD>
<LD>   "Young guys screech their tires and show off their cars," said
Anais Sahabian, 15, a Los Angeles high school sophomore enrolled in
driver's education. "Girls are more attentive."</LD>
<LD>   Dane Butler, 16, of Burbank, said  he thinks girls are more
dangerous behind the wheel. "I've seen more girls getting into
accidents than boys," he said. "A lot of them are distracted."</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, Iana Azusada, a 17-year-old Los Angeles high school senior
who is studying for her driver's permit, said she has observed
classmates who drive while talking on a cell phone or checking the
car mirror, "worried about how they look." But she doesn't think the
girls she knows are any riskier drivers than the boys</TE>
<TE>   There are ways to reduce the likelihood of risky driving behavior
among teens that can lead to accidents or other problems.</TE>
<TE>   "Graduated licenses [in which driving privileges are phased in
slowly] have been shown to be effective in reducing teen crashes,"
said Insurance Institute for Highway Safety spokesman Russ Rader. As
teen drivers get older, the crash rates decline.</TE>
<TE>   The fewer passengers teen drivers carry in the car, the lower the
likelihood of an accident. "With two or more passengers in the car
with a teen driver, the risk of a fatal crash rises five times
compared to driving alone or with one passenger," Rader said.</TE>

<LD>Auto makers have latched onto almost every conceivable theme in their
struggle to come up with names that will help sell cars.</LD>
<LD>   There are fish and fowl, insects and trees, Latin words and
foreign places, letters, numbers and the human races. They've used
royalty, meaningless alpha-numeric combinations, weapons, celestial
bodies, poisonous snakes, mythology and more.</LD>
<LD>   But never before has anyone named a vehicle after a shoe.</LD>
<TE>   Ford Motor Co., fighting to come back from a disastrous series of
safety, marketing and reliability problems in recent years, has
decided on CrossTrainer as the name of a new sport-utility-styled
vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   "I think a cross trainer is an athletic shoe, isn't it," said Tom
Healey, director of marketing services at the automobile research
firm J.D. Power and Associates. "What are they trying to resonate
with? I don't know the point."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, a cross trainer is a type of shoe that purportedly allows
the amateur athlete to engage in a range of activities, from tennis
to running, basketball to television watching.</TE>
<TE>   The new Ford vehicle will fit a genre that packages a station
wagon with the image of a sport-utility vehicle. The idea is that it
supports many activities.</TE>
<TE>   It's not a particularly glamorous look, but no doubt Ford's
research has shown a sizable market for a rugged vehicle that is
smaller, better performing and less costly than a true SUV.</TE>
<TE>   Ford is betting big on it, converting a Taurus/Sable manufacturing
plant in Chicago to CrossTrainer production in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   But oh, that name.</TE>
<TE>   Will you get a car or a pair of athletic shoes when you ask the
parking valet to bring you the blue CrossTrainer?</TE>
<TE>   More important, will questions like that cross consumers'
minds--and color their decision making--when they go car shopping?</TE>
<TE>   The trend in car naming in recent years has been to select names
loaded with testosterone or to swing to combinations of letters and
numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Infiniti, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Volvo and Lexus, among others, use
virtually all alpha-numeric names: Q45, 330i, SLK320, S80, IS300.</TE>
<TE>   But even with something so bland, there are pitfalls.</TE>
<TE>   Mostly, the numbers denote a vehicle's engine size. But
Mercedes-Benz, among others, has tripped up when the engine size
changed but the model name remained the same.</TE>
<TE>   In a bid for novelty, some car makers have strung things together
in unmanageable fashion: the bonkers Merkur xr4ti, a short-lived
Mercury from Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the growing dominance of trucks has given vehicle
naming a tougher edge, said Kenny Morse, the Mr. Traffic radio host.</TE>
<TE>   Take, for example, one edition of the most popular vehicle in the
nation, the Ford F-150 pickup truck. The company this year came out
with the Harley Davidson F-150 Super Crew, Morse said.</TE>
<TE>   That's consistent with such names as the Sequoia, Expedition,
Mountaineer, Tahoe, Trailblazer and the Ironman, a special edition of
Isuzu's Vehicross sport-utility--a model discontinued this year.</TE>
<TE>   "There is almost no appeal to women, which is the strangest part
of it all," Morse said. "They are the car buyers in the U.S. They are
involved in most of the car purchases."</TE>
<TE>   Some names have simply been around too long.</TE>
<TE>   Does Ford's Crown Victoria, apparently referring to British
royalty, resonate well with today's buyers? Or Mercury's Grand
Marquis?</TE>
<TE>   These are old names on old vehicles, perhaps intended at one time
to appeal to the pretensions of the middle class. Names such as the
Dodge Monaco and the Chevrolet Monte Carlo are in the same vein. They
are unlikely to ever be duplicated.</TE>
<TE>   Except for its success, the same might be said of the venerable
Suburban, the king of the SUV class that has been around for decades.</TE>
<TE>   Suburbia today is the often-unattractive sprawl of the 1960s and
'70s.</TE>
<TE>   But when GM named the vehicle in 1935, the Suburban was purchased
by a lot of rural dwellers and "instead of saying you were a hick or
a farmer, it said you are a suburbanite," Healy said. "Somebody from
the boonies would see the suburbs as glamorous."</TE>
<TE>   Animal names are consistently popular. Among the best have been
the Falcon, Mustang, Sting Ray, Barracuda, Super Bee and Viper. The
antithesis of these are the engineered names of imports: Camry,
Acura, Jetta.</TE>
<TE>   The Japanese have an odd affinity for Latin or Latin-sounding
names: Lexus, meaning law, or Maxima, the biggest.</TE>
<TE>   Spanish pops up sometimes in domestic as well as import names:
Japan's Isuzu had an Amigo, Ford had a Ranchero and Chevrolet had a
Nova.</TE>
<TE>   There have been a smattering of Indian names too: Aztek, Cherokee.
In fact, the Aztek is a Pontiac, which is an entire brand named after
a Native American chief.</TE>
<TE>   Terrible names often are associated with failed models. Among the
worst: the General Motors Impact.</TE>
<TE>   "Why not call it the crash-boom-bang?" Morse asked.</TE>
<TE>   The Chevy Citation, the so-called X-platform car that was to beat
back imports in the 1970s, became known as the traffic ticket.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, there is the Edsel, the car named after Henry Ford's
downtrodden son.</TE>
<TE>   "It has become synonymous with a bad idea. I don't think there is
anything essentially goofy about the name," Healey said, "but it has
come to mean loser.''</TE>
<TE>   Although the car was a styling experiment that didn't catch on
with buyers, naming it after someone who spent most of his life
pushed into the shadows by a domineering patriarch wasn't the keenest
piece of marketing savvy.</TE>
<TE>   "After a time," Healey said, "the name will define the car."</TE>
<TE>   In the Edsel's case, it became the definition of a failure.</TE>
<TE>   And that's about as bad as it gets in product marketing.</TE>

<LD>These sweets are all favorites of mine, and any of them would make a
good Valentine's Day treat.</LD>
<LD>   For those friends and family members concerned about fat, there's
nothing like these soft, homemade marshmallows--they're just sweet
enough and very delicate in texture. I received a batch of them as a
present, and they were so good that I didn't share them with a soul.</LD>
<LD>   The pecan pie bar cookies are sweet, chewy and addictive while the
thin chocolate cookie crisps are less sweet, the perfect foil for
after-dinner espresso or an afternoon tea.</LD>
<TE>   The bars can be kept up to five days in an airtight container at
room temperature or frozen as long as a month. Experiment with
different flavorings--coffee, mint, almond, coconut.</TE>

<TE>   Karen Kelly's Marshmallows</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 15 minutes plus 8 hours
chilling</TE>
<TE>   1 (1/4-ounce) envelope unflavored gelatin</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons cold water</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup light corn syrup, divided</TE>
<TE>   6 tablespoons hot water</TE>
<TE>   1 cup granulated sugar</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup powdered sugar, sifted</TE>
<TE>   Set aside a lightly buttered (bottom and sides) 13x9-inch baking
pan. Place the gelatin in a small dish; stir in the cold water and
set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Place 1/4 cup of the corn syrup in the bowl of an electric mixer.
Combine the hot water, remaining 1/4 cup corn syrup and the
granulated sugar in a small saucepan. Stir until the sugar dissolves,
then boil uncovered, without stirring, until the mixture registers
230 degrees on a candy thermometer, about 5 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Add to the mixer bowl. Whip on medium high, slowly adding the
gelatin mixture by spoonfuls. Continue whipping until the outside of
the bowl feels cool to the touch and the mixture is thick, about 10
minutes. Add the vanilla; mix until combined.</TE>
<TE>   Spread the mixture evenly in the pan (it will be about 1/2 inch
thick). Let it rest at room temperature, uncovered, for 24 hours. Use
a paring knife dipped into hot water to cut the marshmallows into
2-inch squares.</TE>
<TE>   Place the powdered sugar in a shallow bowl. Toss the marshmallows
in the sugar to keep them from sticking. These can be stored up to 5
days at room temperature in an airtight tin, layered between pieces
of wax paper.</TE>
<TE>   24 (2-inch) square marshmallows. Each marshmallow: 62 calories; 9

<TE>   Active Work Time: 20 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 40 minutes</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened</TE>
<TE>   1 cup light brown sugar, packed</TE>
<TE>   1 egg</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons light corn syrup</TE>

<TE>   1/4 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup minced walnuts</TE>
<TE>   2/3 cup oatmeal</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Grease 2baking sheets, then sprinkle
lightly with water (to release cookies from pan after they are
baked); set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Cream the butter and sugar in the bowl of a mixer until fluffy,
about 1 minute. Add the egg, vanilla and syrup. Mix until smooth. Add
the cocoa, flour and salt. Mix well. Add the walnuts and oatmeal. Mix
until combined.</TE>
<TE>   Drop the batter by 1/2-tablespoon measures, about 2 inches apart,
on the prepared pans. Use a finger dipped in water to flatten each
cookie. Bake until the cookies are darker around the edges, about 7
to 8 minutes. Let them rest on the pan until firm enough to transfer
(with a metal spatula) to a cooling rack. Cool completely. The
cookies can be kept up to 1 week, stored in an airtight container at
room temperature.</TE>
<TE>   About 40 cookies. Each cookie: 66 calories; 20 mg sodium; 11 mg

<HD>In Utah, It's Good to Be Green (Jell-O)</HD>
<DH>Gelatin gets molded to Salt Lake City tastes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROLYN WYMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While athletes at the 2002 Winter Olympics are going for the gold,
their Utahan hosts will be going for the green.</LD>
<LD>   That is, green as in lime Jell-O--the nonsponsoring, unofficial
food of choice in the home of the Winter Olympics.</LD>
<LD>   Salt Lake City is America's Jell-O-eating capital. Every man,
woman and child in Salt Lake City buys two boxes of the stuff
annually, or twice the national average, says Mary Jane Kinkade of
Jell-O brand gelatin-maker Kraft Foods. Utah residents also eat twice
as much lime Jell-O as anyone else on the planet.</LD>
<TE>   Locals attribute their high Jell-O consumption to the large
population of teetotaling Mormons and their compensating love of
sweets. (Utahans are also champion consumers of ice cream, candy bars
and marshmallows--including the miniature ones used in Jell-O molds).</TE>
<TE>   In Utah, the classic lime Jell-O add-in is shredded carrots.</TE>
<TE>   Sariah Hillam, 31, of Roosevelt, Utah, sometimes makes Jell-O with
vegetable broth. "Jell-O is something kids will eat," explains the
mother of three.</TE>
<TE>   And since shelf-stable Jell-O powder keeps well, it is a staple of
the food larders all good Mormons keep.</TE>
<TE>   Hillam reports frequent Jell-O sightings at potlucks and church
gatherings--but the dishes are rarely sweet. "There will be at least
four or five kinds of Jell-O salads at any event," she says. Jell-O
desserts are rare by comparison, Hillam says, which could explain the
large sales of the salad-oriented lime flavor in Utah.</TE>
<TE>   Local newspaper food editor Valerie Phillips traces lime's
popularity to a single locally popular Jell-O salad featuring lime
Jell-O, crushed pineapple, cottage cheese and whipped cream. "That's
been a big favorite for a very, very long time," says Phillips of
Salt Lake City's Deseret News, whose 1998 Jell-O cooking contest
acknowledged lime's popularity with a separate "green" category.</TE>
<TE>   "Ask a Mormon to bring a green salad and they will bring green
Jell-O," adds local cookbook author Roger Salazar, whose humorous
cookbook "No Man Knows My Pastries: The Secret Not Sacred Recipes of
Sister Enid Christensen" (Signature Books, $8.95) includes a chart
matching Jell-O molds to common Mormon social occasions.</TE>
<TE>   Utahans don't just eat Jell-O. They also slide in it, sculpt with
it and use it to decorate their clothes and buildings. The annual
Jell-O slide, which involves sliming up in a Jell-O pit before diving
headfirst onto a slick plastic slice, is a recruiting tool for Utah
State University's Latter-day Saints Men's Assn., although organizer
Bud Pace says just as many young women take part.</TE>
<TE>   You won't find corned beef and cabbage or green beer at the
Flanigan's Inn in Zion National Park on St. Patrick's Day. This Irish
restaurant and inn instead celebrates the holiday with a lime Jell-O
sculpting contest. Salt Lake City also has a vintage clothing store
(Grunts and Postures) whose exterior is decorated with more than 100
vintage Jell-O molds.</TE>
<TE>   And guess which of the hundreds of Olympic pin designs authorized
by the 2002 Salt Lake Organizing Committee has proven to be the most
popular? That's right, the one depicting a bowl of cubed lime
gelatin. The pins are now only available on the collectors market and
cost a cool $150 to $200 each.</TE>
<TE>   Pin maker Aminco International's California-based executives were
initially skeptical about the idea of a Jell-O pin. "We were worried
that Utah would be embarrassed about being known as the Jell-O-eating
capital of the world," Aminco Vice President David Hyman says. "But
Utahans are very proud of it."</TE>
<TE>   Hyman and his colleagues were amazed that the lime Jell-O pins and
a subsequent one featuring lime Jell-O and shredded carrots were all
snapped up in a matter of weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Jell-O's grip on Utah slipped in 1999, when Kraft announced that
Des Moines had wrestled the lead in Jell-O sales away from Salt Lake
City. Acting out of state patriotism (and without telling Kraft),
chef Scott Blackerby of Salt Lake's Bambara restaurant risked his
upscale reputation by serving Jell-O desserts and holding a "Take
Back the Title!" Jell-O recipe contest. "The more people experiment
with their recipes, the more Jell-O gelatin they'll buy," he says.
Thanks in part to Blackerby's efforts, Utah regained its Jell-O
eating crown in early 2001. To celebrate, Jell-O spokesman Bill Cosby
delivered a free comedy routine to a joint session of the Utah state
Legislature, which responded by making Jell-O the state's official
snack food (overriding the protests of one senator who said Jell-O
has too much "wiggle jiggle" for such a straitlaced state).</TE>
<TE>   As for the Olympic athletes, those who train at any of the three
sports centers run by the U.S. Olympic Committee see gelatin on the
cafeteria salad bar daily. The committee's food services manager,
Terri Moreman, says she serves it as a comfort--rather than a
performance--food, although the diet varieties are popular with
athletes who need to watch their weight.</TE>
<TE>   Sugar Free Jell-O's 1984 introduction was, in fact, accompanied by
a public relations campaign featuring the Olympic medal-winning U.S.
Women's Volleyball Team. Boxer Antonio Tarver, winner of a 1996
Olympic bronze medal, once credited diet Jell-O with keeping him a
light heavyweight.</TE>
<TE>   But no, sports fans, there is as yet no movement to make Jell-O
sliding into an Olympic event.</TE>

<HD>Giving It Up for Lent: The Cuisine of Denial</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY ROURKE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One night in winter, when Dwight D. Eisenhower was still president
and Pius XII was pope, my mother sidestepped our usual dinner of
hamburgers or hot dogs and passed hot cross buns around the kitchen
table. It was the first night of Lent, just like tonight. We had
entered the Christian season of fasting and prayer that wends its way
for close to seven weeks toward Easter.</LD>
<LD>   That evening my mother had all six of us children to herself and
she was happy. A schoolteacher, she liked fitting a lesson into
everyday events. There were enough of us to make a small class. The
shiny buns she took from the bakery box had a story to go with them.
They were only made during Lent and the grid of white frosting on top
formed a cross. An English monk invented them in the Middle Ages.</LD>
<LD>   All of that explained why I had never seen them before. But it was
the first bite that convinced me they were the right food for the
occasion. They were filled with dried fruit, one of my least favorite
foods. Lent must be an acquired taste, I decided.</LD>
<TE>   Our mysterious meal is my first clear memory of the most solemn
phase in the church calendar year. I was in fifth grade at the
Cathedral school in Syracuse, N.Y., and the nuns had drummed into our
heads the meaning of the season. But it took my mother's lesson at
the kitchen table, served with hot cross buns, to make an impression.
Even now, the "surrender" of Lent that the saints write about makes
me think of food.</TE>
<TE>   I find I am not alone. Most of the 2 billion Christians in the
world live in countries where Lent and special foods go together.
Even people who don't observe the season as they once did remember
what they used to eat at this time of year. Salt cod for Greeks,
lentil patties for Armenians, bean soup for Italians, bread pudding
with cheese for Mexicans. They are simple, inexpensive dishes made
from local ingredients. However different they are from each other,
there is something they share. They all comply with the rules of
Lent.</TE>
<TE>   For Roman Catholics, and I am one, the strictest fasts are on Ash
Wednesday and Good Friday, the first and one of the last days of the
season. Adults in good health do not eat meat, and the day's total
intake is one full meal with two others that should be very small.</TE>
<TE>   "The basic idea is to be more spartan. No frills," says Father
Philip, guest master at St. Andrew's Priory, a Benedictine monastery
in Valyermo. "On Fridays in Lent we have vegetable soup and bread for
dinner. And that's all."</TE>
<TE>   Most Protestants follow a more general guideline. "Christians keep
three Lenten disciplines," says Pastor Mark Price of St. Timothy's
Lutheran Church in Lakewood. "There is fasting, prayer and alms
giving." He leaves the details to individuals.</TE>
<TE>   Giving up bad habits counts as a fast, he says. So does taking on
something new as a form of self-discipline. Some people he knows
place Herculean limits on themselves, fasting for three days, Maundy
Thursday until Easter Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't spell out what people should do," says Price. "On Ash
Wednesday I just tell the congregation, 'Your Lenten discipline
begins now.'"</TE>
<TE>   Orthodox Christians, most with roots in Eastern Europe, Russia and
Greece, follow austere rules, by comparison. Clean Monday, the first
day of their Great Lent, as well as Holy Friday and Saturday, the
last two days, are "dry fast" days. Observers of the fast get by on
fruits, nuts and foods that require no cooking.</TE>
<TE>   Other days, the ideal is to give up meat, dairy products, fish,
except shellfish, olive oil and wine. That leaves vegetables, fruits
and grains. "Keep a simple diet to gain control of our physical
desires," says Father John Bakas, dean of St. Sophia's Greek Orthodox
Cathedral in Los Angeles. "It is a spiritual exercise."</TE>
<TE>   From these recipes for self-denial come dishes that some people
actually look forward to, each year. "It's comfort food," Eloise
Gomez says of capirotada, the Mexican bread pudding she grew up on.
"Ash Wednesdays we always knew my mom would make it with raisins and
cheese." Gomez will add the dish to the Lenten menu at the Mater
Dolorosa Retreat Center in Sierra Madre, where she is kitchen
supervisor.</TE>
<TE>   In her cookbook, "The Foods and Life of Oaxaca" (Hungry Minds,
$32.50), Zarela Martinez gives the recipe for a dish made of chilies
dipped in a batter of egg and dried shrimp that she associates with
Lenten cooking in her mother's kitchen. That and a stew of dried
corn, green onion and tomatoes were basic foods when she was growing
up.</TE>
<TE>   "They have an emotional connection," she says. Reviving them is
not a religious calling for her, but a cultural one. "A lot of
Mexican Americans want to reclaim their traditions," Martinez says.
"I rescue these dishes because they are part of Mexican heritage."</TE>
<TE>   Other big-name cooks have been bringing back their own Lenten
nostalgia foods. Last year during Lent, Mario Batali of "Molto
Mario," one of the most popular shows on the Food Network, spooned
out his bread soup for Lent, made of bread crumbs,
Parmigiano-Reggiano and sweet peas in a chicken stock. That course
led on to a dish of pasta and beans.</TE>
<TE>   It is daunting to think about the quantities of macaroni and
cheese, tuna casserole and fish sticks that have been consumed by
American Christians during Lent since the rise of frozen foods. Even
foodies still think of them as the standard-bearers. This year again,
grocery stores including Bristol Farms are baking hot cross buns,
back by popular demand as of today.</TE>
<TE>   But ask Greek Orthodox Christians what they eat during Lent and
it's a whole other story. "Lentil soup," says Anastasia Kalivas who
manages the Orthodox Christian bookstore, The Life Giving Spring, in
Glendale. "And on Holy Friday, the day Christ was crucified, we add
vinegar to symbolize the vinegar the soldiers gave him when he dying
on the cross."</TE>
<TE>   Plain rice, plain spaghetti and taramosalata, carp roe, spread on
bread are other familiar Greek dishes for Lent. "If you keep the
fast, Lent makes for a different lifestyle," Kalivas says. "You might
live on vegetables the whole time, if you are Greek."</TE>
<TE>   An afterthought spins conversation in the opposite direction. "You
look forward to Great Lent, but you dread it too," Kalivas says.
Fasting is about food, what you used to eat and now live in hope that
you will one day eat again. Eastern and Western Christians are
reminded of the extravagant freedom to eat whatever you want for one
day during Lent.</TE>
<TE>   Orthodox Christians remember on March 25, the Feast of the
Annunciation. A major holy day in their calendar year, it
commemorates Mary, the mother of Jesus, conceiving her son. And it
has its own special dish, bacalao, made of reconstituted salt cod
dredged in flour, fried and served with a garlic sauce. "When you've
been fasting for weeks, salt cod is a feast," says Kalivas.</TE>
<TE>   Italians escape the penitential tone on the feast of St. Joseph,
March 19, with pizzelle, flat, snowflake-shaped cookies rolled in
powdered sugar. The Irish break free on St. Patrick's Day, March 17.
Corned beef and cabbage never looked so good.</TE>
<TE>   It seems cruel to glance back toward yesterday. Mardi Gras, or Fat
Tuesday, as it is fondly known by happy pagans, Shrove Tuesday for
the devout who only intended to indulge one more time before
"shriving" themselves of their sins. Cruel perhaps, but revealing.</TE>
<TE>   The revelers in New Orleans may still be out to breakfast, having
been to Tuesday night's Mardi Gras ball and then to a breakfast of
grillades and grits. There might still be a slice of King  cake, with
a trinket buried inside, in the kitchen. Fat Tuesday is the last day
of the festival that the cake is served.</TE>
<TE>   In Pennsylvania Dutch country, faschingkrapfen, the doughnut-like
pastries that Germans and Austrians serve during their Carnival
before Lent, had a moment as well, on Tuesday. "A long time ago as a
little boy in Germany," says Joachim Splichal, the chef and owner of
Patina restaurant in Los Angeles, "we made faschingkrapfen of brioche
dough, cut into triangles and fried, then covered with sugar and
cinnamon. As a young kid, I looked forward to that. Now, it reminds
me of a season of the year, like raspberry or asparagus season."</TE>
<TE>   And in North Hollywood, members of St. Emmanuel Lutheran Church
might still be feeling the effects of Tuesday night's pancake supper.
Sausages, buttermilk cakes the size of serving plates and a pancake
race that had players rushing through the parish hall flipping
flapjacks from a spatula rounded out the evening. Pancake suppers are
part of the pre-Lent tradition too, thanks to a legend about an
English housewife in the 14th century who ran late to church with her
skillet in her hand.</TE>
<TE>   One last greasy foods fest of pancakes, pasties and grits leaves a
person with something to hold on to though the weeks of deep Lent
ahead. The church approves of it, as a way to clear your kitchen of
butter, sweets and meats that would only tempt you, later on. I
approve of it, too. Lent never fails to remind me that ordinary life
is a luxury.</TE>

<LD>Fish soup is a favorite of mine because it is light yet warm and
satisfying. This version is made with lean halibut and swordfish to
reduce the fat even further.</LD>
<LD>   It's essential to use the freshest bones for the stock. You may
have to ask for them specially at your local fish market. Use the
freshest fish, as well. Really fresh fish will not have a fishy odor,
and the flesh will be firm and spring back when touched. For the best
flavor, use fish the same day you buy it.</LD>

<LD>How to impress someone with a nice meal in a short amount of time?
Serve grilled swordfish. It's impressive on the dinner plate--perfect
for Valentine's Day.</LD>
<LD>   Try grilling it on a stove-top grill pan--these are a nice
addition to any kitchen. Look for the ones made from cast iron,
they'll get hotter. Best of all, a stove-top pan will keep you inside
rather than running out to the grill while your valentine waits.</LD>

<LD>"The '97 Franciscan 'Oakville Estate Magnificat.' The thing I like
about the wine is that the winery is in downtown Oakville and it is
relatively well-priced, considering Silver Oak, Beringer and Groth
are right next door. It is also the '98 vintage, which has been
written off by many people as being weaker than the '99 or '97. I say
the '98s are more elegant, and although they may not last as long,
they are very ripe and easy to drink now. This wine has a lot of
power and weight, meaning the tannins are large in volume but very
ripe. The fruit is black cherry with some red fruits in front of the
mouth. Elegant on the entry but good intensity later, so no
astringency."</LD>

<LD>Leftover cooked rice is a terrific building block for last-minute
dinners. You can turn it into a main-course salad, add it to a
filling for burritos, make fried rice or combine it with some pantry
staples and stuff it into peppers as I have done here.</LD>
<LD>   One cup of uncooked rice yields three cups of cooked rice, plenty
for a family of four. Double the quantity next time you make rice and
you're almost ready for another meal.</LD>
<LD>   If you love rice as much as I do, you might be interested in
buying an automatic rice cooker. It is one of my favorite kitchen
appliances because it needs no watching. Add rice, water and salt,
and in 20 minutes you have fluffy steamed rice--nothing sticks or
boils over, and the rice stays warm until serving time.</LD>

<TE>   Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Halve the bell peppers lengthwise,
remove the cores and scrape out the seeds. Place the halves cut side
up on a rimmed baking sheet.</TE>
<TE>   In a large bowl, mix together the rice, black beans, corn and
cilantro.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion

vegetables are browning. Add the salt, cumin, turmeric and paprika.
Stir continuously until the spices are fragrant, about 1 minute.
Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the hot pepper sauce.
Add this to the rice mixture in the bowl. Stir to thoroughly combine.
Taste and adjust seasonings, if desired. Pack this mixture into the
pepper halves. Top with the grated cheese.</TE>
<TE>   Bake the peppers, uncovered, until tender when pierced with a
knife, about 30 to 35 minutes. Place 2 halves on each dinner plate

<LD>DEAR SOS: My girlfriend and I had a wonderful Valentine's dinner at
La Traviata in Long Beach. The ambience was romantic, the service and
entertainment were great, but the sea bass was to die for. Can you
get the recipe?</LD>
<LD>   JOHN E. MIN</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles</LD>
<TE>   DEAR JOHN: Here it is, almost Valentine's Day again. We got the
recipe, but we substituted halibut because Chilean sea bass is so
overfished. We used the restaurant's glaze and ponzu sauce. Make it
for your girlfriend at home this year. But you're on your own for
service, entertainment and ambience.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Miso-Glazed Halibut With Rice and Vegetables</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 15 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 40 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Miso can be found in the refrigerated aisle with other Asian
products at well-stocked supermarkets.</TE>
<TE>   MISO GLAZE</TE>
<TE>   1 cup orange juice</TE>
<TE>   1 cup sugar</TE>
<TE>   Juice of 1 lemon</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons miso</TE>
<TE>   Place the orange juice, sugar and lemon juice in a small saucepan
and cook over medium-high heat until reduced to 1/4 cup. Stir in the
miso; set aside.</TE>
<TE>   PONZU SAUCE</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup soy sauce</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons lemon juice</TE>
<TE>   1 clove garlic, pressed</TE>
<TE>   Combine the soy sauce, lemon juice and garlic; set aside.</TE>
<TE>   ASSEMBLY</TE>
<TE>   Nonstick cooking spray</TE>
<TE>   6 (6-ounce) halibut steaks</TE>
<TE>   Salt, pepper</TE>
<TE>   Miso Glaze</TE>
<TE>   3/4 pound baby carrots</TE>
<TE>   3/4 pound broccoli crowns</TE>
<TE>   1 cup jasmine rice, cooked</TE>
<TE>   3 green onions, sliced</TE>
<TE>   Ponzu Sauce</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 500 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Coat a large baking pan or rimmed baking sheet with cooking spray.
Season the fish with salt and pepper and place in the pan. Brush with
the Miso Glaze. Bake until the fish begins to flake, about 6 to 8
minutes. It will continue to cook when removed from the oven, so do
not overbake.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, steam the carrots and broccoli until tender, about 10
minutes for the carrots and 8 minutes for the broccoli.</TE>
<TE>   Place some rice in the center of each of 6 warmed plates and top
with a piece of fish. Top the fish with a few green onions and a
splash of the Ponzu Sauce. Arrange the vegetables as you wish.</TE>

<LD>Penelope's in La Canada Flintridge is a nice place to stop for
coffee, a quick bite or something to read--it's a bookshop and
gallery as well as a restaurant. If you don't have time to linger,
Penelope's will pack food to go. For a light lunch, try the
vegetarian sandwich, filled with Brie, spinach leaves, sliced red
onion and avocado. The choice of bread is up to you. The orange color
of sun-dried tomato bread makes a nice contrast to the leafy green
filling. Other options are Kalamata olive, multi-grain, sourdough,
rye, French rolls and croissants. Sandwiches come with a choice of
green salad, fruit or coleslaw made with red cabbage.</LD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Over the last several years we have seen the development of a
category of books encouraging us to live like the Italians.
Presumably, these do not refer to our driving, pop music or choice of
governments, but only to our cooking and eating. In these books,
Italy is no longer a nation, or even the home of a cuisine. It has
ascended to the realm of philosophy, where it represents Paradise
Before the Fall (much as the American West did for centuries
previous).</LD>
<LD>   At the heart of these books is the encouragement to live more
simply, or rather to cook and eat more simply. The idea is that with
a few well-chosen ingredients, prepared carefully (or maybe, the
books would say, "mindfully"), we can achieve some sort of blissful
state of cuisine where all is delicious, yet unfettered by
complication.</LD>
<LD>   I certainly would not want to disagree with this, at least as a
philosophy of cooking. After all, that's what drew me to California
in the first place. And in reading Viana La Place's new "La Bella
Cucina: How to Cook, Eat and Live Like an Italian" (Clarkson Potter,
$28), one of the first things that struck me was how very Californian
it all sounded. Or, at least, California before traffic, riots and
recessions.</LD>
<TE>   This is certainly not coincidental, since La Place, who now lives
in the Bay Area and in Italy, is a Californian born and bred.
Cookbook fans will know her from the books she wrote with Evan
Kleiman in the 1980s--"Pasta Fresca," et al.--which were pioneering
works in what became known as Cal-Ital cuisine. "La Bella Cucina"
shows how La Place has grown in the intervening years, both as a
writer and as a cook.</TE>
<TE>   Just glancing through the book, you might miss some of its charms.
She has an unfortunate fondness for the exclamation point, and the
recipes probably aren't the kind to send you running to the cashier.
(How many times have you already seen a recipe along the lines of
"Mustard Greens With Olive Oil and Red Wine Vinegar"?) It's only in
reading it closely that you appreciate what La Place is up to.</TE>
<TE>   The introductory note, delivered in what seems to be a roundabout
fashion, is actually a rather pointed discussion of vinegars
("balsamic vinegar," she writes, "is used inappropriately most of the
time, splashed on everything, including the tenderest salad
greens"--she does like it on roasted red peppers). Even with the
simplest things, it's the details that make the difference.</TE>

<HD>Temple of Dining</HD>
<DH>A trip to Southern California's great Wat Thai yields a
glimpse of enlightenment--and the perfect papaya salad.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE T. TRAN</AU>
<BD>Special to the Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We are driving down San Fernando Road looking for the great Thai
Temple, with a direction lost somewhere in my childhood memory. My
logic for exploring L.A. without a map is that somehow traveling
becomes more interesting when you are lost, simply because of the
unexpected things you find along the way.</LD>
<LD>   An hour later we stop at the San Fernando Mission to ask for
directions to the Thai Temple. It's the middle of Sunday Mass, and
the girls behind the gift store counter don't know where it is, so we
look in their phone book, but to no avail. Finally my friend and I
give up and call information. The man on the other end of the line
says, "A Thai temple? The one with the underground food court, and
you use tokens to buy food?"</LD>
<LD>   "Yes, that's the one," I say.</LD>
<TE>   "I used to go there every weekend with my girlfriend," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "So you know how to get there?"</TE>
<TE>   "No."</TE>
<TE>   "Let me guess, you two broke up and you never went back there
since."</TE>
<TE>   "That's how the story goes."</TE>
<TE>   He gives us a number to the Thai temple of L.A., which is in North
Hollywood. We call that number and ask if it is indeed the temple
with great Thai food.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, yes," a woman answers, the way parents respond to a child's
exclamation that Christmas is all about opening presents.</TE>
<TE>   We get back on the freeway, take the 118 east, the 5 south, then
the 170 and exit at Roscoe Boulevard. Twenty minutes later we are
walking up the steps of a grand building whose architecture
transports us to another time and place. The red roof with golden
trim exudes a sense of sacredness and awe as Buddhist icons and
statues reach up to the ceiling.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the temple, the sound of synchronized chanting echoes
through the walls as the smell of burning incense lingers,
disconnecting my mind from geographic reality. For a moment I am 7
years old again, helping my mom light the incense sticks at our local
stupa in Ben Tre, a province of the Mekong Delta in Vietnam, praying
for a better harvest season. The next moment, I am in a temple in
Singapore, listening to the strange chanting of Buddhist scripture.</TE>
<TE>   I don't understand the Thai language, yet somehow the rhythmic
flow at the Wat Thai is familiarly comforting and relaxing. The
Theravada monks in brilliant orange robes, the color of turmeric, sit
motionless along with others in their peaceful worship.</TE>
<TE>   We come upon a little booth where we exchange dollar bills for
plastic tokens with the name Wat Thai of Los Angeles written on them.
(Wat means Buddhist temple.) We follow a group of people down the
stairway for food, with handfuls of red, green and yellow tokens.</TE>
<TE>   I wait in line on the left side by the entrance where a woman
mixes fresh batches of papaya salad. My friend returns carrying
perfectly grilled chicken and beef satay sticks and some
heavenly-smelling curry rice. I fight the temptation to eat his food
while waiting for my salad. Finally it is my turn. I am in front of
the line.</TE>
<TE>   "One papaya salad, medium spicy, please," I say, a little too
eagerly.</TE>
<TE>   The woman smiles, takes a giant spoon and scoops strips of green
papaya into a large stone mortar. Watching her work is mesmerizing.
She pounds the vegetables while adding more ingredients, a heap of
roasted peanuts, a spoon of dry shrimp, a sprinkle of crushed red
peppers, a few marinated salty crab legs, a little sugar here and a
dash of lime juice there.</TE>
<TE>   My mother first took me here about 15 years ago. But I remember
this papaya salad as if I had eaten it yesterday. I shout to her over
the noise she makes preparing the salad that her papaya salad is the
best around. She laughs and says with traditional modesty, "This
salad you can get at any Thai restaurant."</TE>
<TE>   I shake my head, shouting back, "I have searched for this place
for so long. This is the most authentic Thai food around L.A."</TE>
<TE>   She smiles and continues to mix my salad. My friend and I carry
our delicious treasures up the stairs to the benches in the
courtyard. We also purchase some crispy fried plantains and taros
along with a crepe dessert filled with sweet rice and fresh durian.
My friend thinks durian has an odor, and I think it has a sweet
fragrance. We agree that it is an acquired taste. At the table,
shaded by a giant bo tree (Ficus religiosa), we join a group of
people of various ethnicities.</TE>
<TE>   I take out my chopsticks and taste my salad. It is a divine
combination of sweet, sour, salty and spicy. I wonder whether anyone
has ever reached enlightenment through food. But before I can think
of an answer, my mouth becomes inflamed from the chile. I gulp down a
whole bottle of water, breathe and announce ecstatically that this
salad is the tastiest papaya salad outside of Thailand, being
perfectly too hot for human consumption.</TE>
<TE>   I dive in for another round of spicy papaya salad because I have
yet to master moderation or sanity. Of course, one could always order
the less dramatic "no pepper" version and still get a delicious salad
without the tears.</TE>
<TE>   Another popular item is the food court's steaming rice noodle
soup, similar to the Vietnamese pho but with a bolder grilled onion
taste. Pad Thai, a stir-fried noodle dish with roasted peanuts and
chicken, is another popular item, along with Thai ice tea, a drink
now served with tapioca pearls if you request them.</TE>
<TE>   The atmosphere of the food court underground is a little cramped
and busy, but you can take your food upstairs to eat and enjoy the
open air. The other customers are friendly, while at the same time
leaving you alone enough to soak up the ambience. I recommend
visiting the temple and food court early on weekend mornings when the
weather is cooler and the place less crowded.</TE>
<TE>   After we eat, we enter the temple, leaving our shoes outside. One
monk reads from a doctrine and periodically people respond with a
phrase or two in Thai. I whisper a question to another monk nearby
and he summarizes: "Buddhist teaching is that we have both good and
bad inside us. We must learn from others' examples both virtues and
vices ... this way, everyone is your teacher."</TE>
<TE>   Historically, Thai temples have served social, economic and even
political functions within the community by providing a safe
gathering ground. Today, Thai temples include community outreach
efforts. At the Wat Thai, there are classes for children in classical
Thai dance, music, culture and language. Adults can participate in
secular courses such as Thai fruit and vegetable carving classes and
Thai language classes. Of course there are also Buddhism classes and
meditation practice for those who seek a spiritual path.</TE>
<TE>   "Happiness comes from understanding, respect, and friendship",
says monk Phrakru Sumondharmavong, a resident monk at the Wat Thai.
"We are equal even with difference in belief, we can be friends and
live in peace and harmony."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The food court is open Saturday and Sunday, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m..
The Wat Thai of Los Angeles is at 8225 Coldwater Canyon Ave., North
Hollywood, (818) 780-4200. For more information, visit its Web site:

<LD>Twilight descends on the sailboat anchored in a forested Alaskan
cove. I can still make out a bald eagle perched in a cedar, its head
like a white tennis ball in the gloom. I hear a cork pop softly
below, and soon a glass of wine is handed up the companionway.</LD>
<LD>   Ah, Sauvignon Blanc. After a hard day of beating into
salt-spitting wind, the fruit is amazing--pure and ripe with its
piercing scents and flavors of melon, fig, spring grass and
wildflowers. The boat rocks gently, stars wink and then blaze, and
the crisp, luscious wine seems to glow in the briny air.</LD>
<LD>   I've never enjoyed wine more than on a sailing trip. Sure, the
anchor drop is a signal for cold beer. That's a universal law. But
after that primal need is satisfied, it's time for higher sensual
pursuits--and few olfactory sensations are as satisfying as that
meeting of land and sea, the bottled soul of sun and earth in a
bracing oceanic setting.</LD>
<TE>   Any wine with reasonably intense fruit fits the bill (a big, juicy
Zinfandel is marvelous). But there's something about Sauvignon Blanc
that complements the savor of the ocean just about perfectly.</TE>
<TE>   I kept thinking about that while tasting various wines with
oysters a couple of weeks ago. The 2002 Pacific Coast Oyster Wine
Competition is described by its founder, Seattle seafood merchant Jon
Rowley, as an "annual dating service for wines and oysters." I, for
one, took a nearly lascivious pleasure in my matchmaking duties.</TE>
<TE>   An oyster is literally the essence of its environment. It filters
gallons of seawater daily, retaining the nutrients, especially
minerals. The concentration of minerals probably accounts for the
slight rush some people experience when eating oysters, and no doubt
has something to do with the oyster's long-standing reputation for
aphrodisiacal powers.</TE>
<TE>   More to the point, it accounts for its bold flavor of the sea. Or,
more accurately, flavors: The creature that Aldous Huxley called "a
piece of machinery greatly more complicated than a watch" has a way
of expressing its oysterness differently in various locations, in
much the same way wine grapes reflect terroir. Oysters of the same
species grown in different bays on the Pacific Coast are as distinct
as, say, Sauvignon Blancs from Dry Creek Valley and Napa Valley.</TE>
<TE>   For the competition, Rowley selected Kumamotos from the Washington
coast. The Kumamoto is a mysterious subspecies of the Pacific oyster
originally from Japanese waters. Its complex flavor begins by
spreading in soft, salty-sweet billows that suddenly part to reveal a
pulse of briny minerality that lingers on a clean cucumber-like
finish.</TE>
<TE>   To be honest, I normally favor a French Sauvignon Blanc such as
Sancerre with oysters (Hippolyte Reverdy's, for example). A steely
Champagne from the Chardonnay vineyards of the Cote des Blancs works
for me too. But sitting in on this tasting reminded me rather
forcefully that just as the West Coast produces some of the world's
best oysters, it yields some fine oyster wines too.</TE>
<TE>   There were about a dozen and a half wines from California, Oregon,
Washington and British Columbia. Most were Sauvignon Blancs from the
2000 vintage, but there were also a Chenin Blanc, a Pinot Blanc, a
Semillon and three Pinot Gris. All had been selected by a hearty crew
of tasters in Seattle. The task handed to me and a dozen fellow
tasters was to cull the best of the best, 10 wines deemed ideal
matches with the noble Kumamoto.</TE>
<TE>   To my surprise, two of my top three wines were Pinot Gris. I loved
the high-toned, spicy fruit of the 2000 Oak Knoll Winery Pinot Gris
(Oregon) and its lively debate with the Kumamoto brine. They ended up
agreeing on every point.</TE>
<TE>   I also liked the 2000 King Estate Pinot Gris (Oregon). Tasted by
itself it seemed too broadly fruity for oyster duty. But the
combination of grape and sea was magic. There was another kind of
magic with the 2001 Geyser Peak Winery Sauvignon Blanc (California).
Its bright, herb-inflected fruit and mineral undertones brought out
the Kumamoto's sweet side.</TE>
<TE>   The match between oysterness and 2000 Rodney Strong Vineyards
Sauvignon Blanc (California) was straightforward harmony. The pure
melon flavor of the wine amplified the nutlike taste many oyster
lovers associate with the Kumamoto. That richness also responded to
the delicately floral fruit and steely acidity of the 2000 Gray Monk
Estate Winery Pinot Gris (British Columbia). And I loved the crisp,
ripe flavors of the 2000 Maryhill Winery Sauvignon Blanc
(Washington), which framed the sea taste beautifully. I also gave
high marks to Sauvignon Blancs from Cakebread, EOS and Pedroncelli
(California), Eola Hills (Oregon) and Chateau St. Michelle
(Washington).</TE>
<TE>   All in all, a strong showing for West Coast wines--and pleasant
duty for an oyster fan. As my last plate of empty shells was taken
away, I recalled Samuel Butler's observation, "What can awaken less
consciousness of warm affection than an oyster? Who would press an
oyster to his heart, or pat it, and want to kiss it? Yet nothing
short of its complete absorption into our own being can in the least
satisfy us."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, for those of us who don't mind tossing something strange
down our throats, so long as it smacks of arcane oceanic mysteries
and zaps us with the effects of pure, concentrated nutrients from the
sea, oysters on the half shell are among the great seasonal treats.
Especially with a glass of crisp white wine.</TE>

"It's so like being in the classroom," the veteran elementary school
teacher marveled.</LD>
<LD>   The videotaped lessons are part of a teacher-training program at
the Los Angeles Unified School District. The 40-hour program is meant
to improve upon more traditional--and costly--teacher-development
workshops where participants hear lectures but rarely have input.</LD>
<TE>   Through computer classes, taken at designated sites throughout the
district, they are encouraged to question their own assumptions--and
everyone else's.</TE>
<TE>   A facilitator gives teachers a series of questions after they
watch an online video, then the teachers discuss their answers both
in class and via the Internet outside of class.</TE>
<TE>   "Each teacher has to respond and reflect," said Maria Fergosa, the
co-director of the LAUSD/UCLA Collaborative Institute, which created
the videos for the L.A. district.</TE>
<TE>   "We can then go in and look at the responses and discuss them.
We've never been able to do this before."</TE>
<TE>   After watching the video with about 30 other teachers, McGuire was
asked by the facilitator to devise different questions that would
best engage the struggling student. If necessary, she could go back
to relevant portions of the video, which is broken into chapters.</TE>
<TE>   Her questions were then shared on the Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates say the format is both effective and efficient.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to streamline staff training through technology," said
Jim Konantz, assistant superintendent of information technology for
the Los Angeles school system.</TE>
<TE>   By 2004, Konantz said, the district aims to have 60% of all
teacher development online. As it stands, about 95% of the district's
teacher development is done through traditional workshops and
seminars.</TE>
<TE>   Half the kindergarten-through-second-grade teachers in the Los
Angeles district, about 5,500 teachers, are being offered the program
as part of their ongoing professional development.</TE>
<TE>   So far, 1,200 teachers have participated since training began in
September.</TE>
<TE>   The program being used by the Los Angeles math teachers was
developed by LessonLab, a Santa Monica company that sells Web site
access to educational organizations.</TE>
<TE>   So far, LessonLab has done business with UCLA, a Florida school
district and Pepperdine University. It has also joined with the
publishing company Pearson Education to use the company's textbooks
online.</TE>
<TE>   The Web site content for K-12 math teachers was developed by UCLA
educators in coordination with the school district. UCLA has a
contract with the state to train teachers. Fergosa and her colleagues
made sure the content related to what the district was teaching.</TE>
<TE>   Not all teachers will use the program; some are uncomfortable with
computers. But McGuire said she chose it in part to overcome her
technophobia.</TE>
<TE>   "You can learn faster through this technology," said McGuire, who
teaches severely handicapped children at Los Angeles Elementary
School in Koreatown. The online lessons give teachers fresh ideas.
Recently, they inspired Cary Davis, a second-grade teacher at
Allesandro Elementary School in Silver Lake, to encourage his
students to try different ways of counting.</TE>
<TE>   He gave the class some problems to solve. Then, he said, "I had
the kids lay out scratch paper, counters and number lines and said,
'Go for it.' I typically don't take the time to do that."</TE>
<TE>   The online training also provides flexibility, teachers and
administrators say.</TE>
<TE>   Using the program is much cheaper than sending teachers to
seminars and paying for substitutes to cover for them.</TE>
<TE>   The teachers can attend a few days of classes when they are
off-track, be given their tasks and access the program at home to
complete the training.</TE>
<TE>   The technology is being used for teachers at other levels as well.
One subdistrict within Los Angeles Unified has developed a pilot
program with LessonLab to train algebra teachers.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to LessonLab, two other online companies, Teachscape
and Scholastic, have begun developing pilot teacher-development
programs for the district--although not as extensive as LessonLab's,
Konantz said.</TE>
<TE>   With the slow economy, dot-com education companies are looking
more attractive to cost-conscious school districts, some experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they're looking for alternative ways [to train
teachers]," said Tim Stroud, assistant director for educational
issues with the American Federation of Teachers. "Once you've
invested in the computers, there's not much additional cost. It has
great potential."</TE>

<LD>Msgr. Anthony Dalla Villa, 63, former rector of New York's St.
Patrick's Cathedral who delivered Andy Warhol's eulogy, died Sunday
of a heart attack while giving a sermon at St. Agnes Catholic Church
in New York.</LD>
<LD>   Dalla Villa was known for invoking pop culture and modern themes
in his sermons. During Warhol's 1987 memorial service at St.
Patrick's, he said: "What you are is God's gift to you. What you make
of it is your gift to God."</LD>
<LD>   Dalla Villa was ordained in 1964. He served at Bronx and Staten
Island churches before transferring to St. Patrick's in 1980. He
became rector in 1988 and joined St. Agnes last year.</LD>

<HD>Guy Stockwell, 68; TV and Film Actor Taught the Craft</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Guy Stockwell, an actor in about 30 movies and 250 television shows,
a respected acting coach and the older brother of actor Dean
Stockwell, has died at 68.</LD>
<LD>   Stockwell died of undisclosed causes last Wednesday at Yavapai
Regional Medical Center near Prescott, Ariz. He had lived in Prescott
for the last five years.</LD>
<LD>   The sons of Broadway singer and actor Harry Stockwell, Guy and
Dean started out as child actors.</LD>
<TE>   Guy made his stage debut at age 5 in "The Innocent Voyage," and a
few years later had a small role as a boy in the 1946 motion picture
"The Green Years."</TE>
<TE>   But Guy Stockwell, unlike his younger brother, hit his acting
stride not as a boy but as a young man in the quirky 1959 mystery
"This Rebel Age" and in the 1960 comedy "Please Don't Eat the
Daisies."</TE>
<TE>   His best big-screen role came in 1966 with the remake of "Beau
Geste," with Stockwell in the title role and Leslie Nielsen and the
late Doug McClure as his brothers struggling with their evil French
Foreign Legion commander, portrayed by the late Telly Savalas.</TE>
<TE>   Stockwell also found major success on the small screen in the
1960s as a regular on two much-loved series.</TE>
<TE>   In 1961 and 1962, he joined the late Gardner McKay sailing the
South Pacific on the Tiki as first mate Chris Parker in "Adventures
in Paradise."</TE>
<TE>   Stockwell was one of 10 actors joining Richard Boone for repertory
plays on the TV anthology series "The Richard Boone Show" in 1963.</TE>
<TE>   Stockwell's guest roles on television spanned four decades of such
popular prime-time series as "Perry Mason" and "Wagon Train" in the
1950s, "Mannix" and "The F.B.I." in the 1960s, "The Streets of San
Francisco" and "ChiPs" in the 1970s, and "Simon and Simon," "Murder,
She Wrote," "Matlock" and "Quantum Leap" in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   The actor also appeared in such movies for television as
"Everybody's Baby: The Rescue of Jessica McClure" in 1989 and
"Unspeakable Acts" and "Columbo Goes to College," both in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Stockwell, unlike his more famous actor brother, gravitated more
to stage than screen and performed around the country in such classic
plays as "The Seagull" and "The Misanthrope."</TE>
<TE>   But from about 1960 on, Stockwell built another career as an
acting coach and producer of plays for new talent in small Los
Angeles theaters, including Stage II on Melrose Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   He helped create the Los Angeles Art Theater and starred there in
the title role of "Hamlet" and in his own adaptation of "Crime and
Punishment."</TE>
<TE>   In teaching, Stockwell said he patterned his work on that of
Russian-born actor and teacher Sergeivich Stanislavsky, who died in
1938.</TE>
<TE>   Stanislavsky, Stockwell explained for The Times in 1986, studied
actors and asked them how they did certain expressions or gestures
that appealed to him.</TE>
<TE>   "In effect, what Stanislavsky was doing was modeling excellent
behavior," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "And once he had a clear enough model, shaking all the nonsense
out of it, he taught other people the same model--and lo and behold,
they became excellent actors."</TE>
<TE>   Stockwell also sought to shortcut psychoanalytic methods employed
by the renowned teacher Lee Strasberg and others who insisted that an
actor understand a situation and then wait for emotion or motivation.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Stockwell said, with his method he could teach an
inhibited female student to scream for a horror movie audition quite
quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "If you'd ask any teacher how long it would take to alter the
inhibition, they'd tell you, conservatively, three, four months--lots
of sensory work," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "But I had her doing it in three minutes. Essentially, I told her,
'There's no reason for you to feel anything. You're quite capable of
faking it.'</TE>
<TE>   "And when she realized she didn't have to feel--only behave--she
was fine [and] screamed bloody murder.</TE>
<TE>   "Acting," said the teacher who also enjoyed acting, "should not be
painful, but play."</TE>
<TE>   Stockwell also taught in the UCLA master's program for acting.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his brother, Stockwell is survived by his first
wife, Suzanne; and three children.</TE>

<HD>Volunteerism: A Way to Grind the Callouses Off Our Hearts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four thousand hours. One hundred weeks. Two years of our lives.</LD>
<LD>   That's asking a lot.</LD>
<LD>   So here's a toast to your daring, Mr. President. Count me in.
Consider this a pledge. Two years.</LD>
<TE>   Not since John F. Kennedy has a sitting president summoned
citizens to the cause of their country. At least not like this. And
even Kennedy didn't ask so much, so directly. And lest we forget,
Kennedy spoke to a different era, one with fresh memories of World
War II and collective national effort.</TE>
<TE>   As I recall the moment 41 winters ago, Kennedy's challenge--what
could we do for the good of the U.S. rather than the other way
around--was one of those political high notes that shaped the way we
viewed ourselves.</TE>
<TE>   Regrettably, those words have become quaint, belonging to the
fairy tale of America more than the reality.</TE>
<TE>   Do-gooders remain, but apart from the hustling imperatives of
larger society. The gap between those who give and those who take in
America has grown vast.</TE>
<TE>   Some of my friends are cynical about George W. Bush's new and
unexpected summons to service. In fact, there's been a lot of silence
on the subject. Don't talk about it and maybe it will go away.</TE>
<TE>   Not me. I'll be soupy--because that's the point of community.
Grind some of those calluses off your heart.</TE>
<TE>   We have a choice. We can approach life with the attitude of Ralph
Waldo Emerson, who said, "To live without duties is obscene." Or we
can borrow from Oscar Wilde, "Duty is what one expects from others."</TE>
<TE>   Bush's State of the Union call to expand the domestic AmeriCorps
and Senior Corps was nearly lost between his report on the war and
partisan skirmishing over the economy. It has been overshadowed, as
well, by the headlines of Enron.</TE>
<TE>   But the cultural consequences are likely to be as profound and
lasting as anything of this age if Bush, and we, actually follow
through to create a resurgent and unifying national spirit of
volunteerism.</TE>
<TE>   When I came of age in the 1960s, public service was a decidedly
conservative idea. I was surrounded by young people, the liberals of
that time, who were free spirits.</TE>
<TE>   They were me-first individuals.</TE>
<TE>   To them, collective duty was an establishment idea. It belonged to
their parents' generation. They turned their backs on it. And it
didn't help that "service" meant primarily the military draft.</TE>
<TE>   That thinking, of course, has been turned inside out now. Today,
many conservatives define themselves by a rigid ideology of
economics: Free-market capitalists are the me-first individualists of
the moment.</TE>
<TE>   Duty has become an expression of government oppression and a
liberal notion.</TE>
<TE>   Odd, isn't it?</TE>
<TE>   Dick Armey, the GOP leader of the House and the man who wrote much
of Newt Gingrich's "contract with America," responded to Bush in full
roar, berating government-sponsored community service as "obnoxious."</TE>
<TE>   "The idea that government can teach charity to America rings very
hollow with me," said Armey. Criticism not being enough, the Texas
congressman added mockery. His 4,000 hours? He'd spend them playing
poker. Ha ha.</TE>
<TE>   Bush would do his country lasting good to battle Armey and this
cynicism to the death.</TE>
<TE>   Teaching good deeds is not the point. Expecting them is. Our
social collective--that is, us, through the organization of
government--could only be strengthened by reactivating that old word
"obligation."</TE>
<TE>   Service is different from charity. Charity ought to be private.
But service ought to be public. Personally, I think it ought to be
mandatory, but that's another topic.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the college professors I know think that students would be
better off with an interval of real-world experience after high
school. Retirees should have every reason to give back to a society
that has allowed so many of them to prosper. Mid-life career
reevaluation need not be a crisis.</TE>
<TE>   At the least, those people who volunteer to build houses, to
assist the frail, to tutor children or for a thousand other worthy
tasks, those willing to give for nothing or for a sub-minimum wage
stipend of $9,300--deserve esteem.</TE>
<TE>   Just as our military rates our respect, we owe our service
volunteers official approbation so they can walk tall among us.</TE>
<TE>   Just so you know: My wife works for Habitat for Humanity, one of
scores of private agencies strengthened by the efforts of AmeriCorps
volunteers. I'll introduce a few of them to you in the near future.</TE>

<HD>How Many Blonds Mess Up a Nash Equilibrium?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BART KOSKO</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The film "A Beautiful Mind" is the first to deal with a profound
social issue that touches everyone but that few people understand--a
Nash equilibrium.</LD>
<LD>   The film also focuses on the mental illness of mathematician John
Nash, who won the 1994 Nobel Prize in economics for a two-page paper
he published in 1950 when he was 20. But without that Nobel Prize,
there would have been no film.</LD>
<LD>   Yet the filmmakers failed to correctly explain a Nash equilibrium.
And a mere flash of text at the film's start only hints at why the
Journal of Economic Literature recently said the impact of the Nash
equilibrium in the social sciences "is comparable to that of the
discovery of the DNA double helix in the biological sciences."</LD>
<TE>   So what is a Nash equilibrium?</TE>
<TE>   A Nash equilibrium shows how selfish competitors should act in
relation to those whom they compete against.</TE>
<TE>   Swiss political philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau suggested a
hunting example in his 1755 "Discourse on Inequality" that has led to
something called the deer game.</TE>
<TE>   Suppose you are one of four starving people in the forest. You
have just two options: You can try to catch a rabbit or a deer. But
you can catch a deer if--and only if--all four of you work together
to catch one. How each person behaves depends on how the others
behave.</TE>
<TE>   Suppose the other three people catch rabbits. Then the best you
can do is catch a rabbit too because you have no chance to catch a
deer. This rabbit hunt is a Nash equilibrium because each person does
his selfish best given what the others do and because no one has an
incentive to switch hunting strategies.</TE>
<TE>   Thus order arises from competitive struggle.</TE>
<TE>   Now suppose the other three people try to catch a deer. You still
eat if you catch a rabbit, but then they can't catch a deer. They
will catch a deer if you help them and then you can all have a feast.
So it is in your selfish interest to try to catch a deer. The deer
hunt is also a Nash equilibrium because each person does the best he
can and has no reason to change his hunting strategy.</TE>
<TE>   The movie gets this backward when it concocts a "blond game" in a
bar. Each young man in the bar wants to pick up a blond woman rather
than a brunet. Then a blond beauty walks in with several brunets.</TE>
<TE>   The Nash character--Russell Crowe--conceives the Nash equilibrium
in this fictitious scene. He claims that no man should pursue the
blond because they can't all have her, and the pursuit would insult
the brunets. So he claims that the optimal strategy is to pursue only
the brunets.</TE>
<TE>   But each man will want to switch from his brunet to the blond if
all the other men have brunets. So this is not a Nash equilibrium.</TE>
<TE>   The film's logic says that children will pick up only the pennies
on a sidewalk and not the hundred-dollar bill lying next to the
pennies because they can't all have the bill. Our own selfishness
says otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   Studies of ultimatums have shown that we can be so selfish that we
become envious and we don't achieve a Nash equilibrium. Suppose I
have $100 and I offer you a share of it. The rules let us keep our
shares if you accept my offer. But neither of us gets anything if you
reject my offer. Then I should offer you as little as possible and
you should accept anything I offer. Yet more than half of players
reject an offer of less than $20 even though accepting even $1 is
better than nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Nash equilibrium can also explain the darker side of behavior.</TE>
<TE>   I once wrote a paper about outlaws who grow and steal marijuana
plants. It pays to steal if there are many more growers than thieves
because growing pot is so risky. But it pays to grow if there are too
many thieves because a grower has some chance of harvesting something
while thieves find little to steal and other thieves will steal from
them.</TE>
<TE>   The outlaws will adjust their strategy mixes of growing and
stealing until they reach Nash equilibrium.</TE>
<TE>   John Nash deserved his Nobel Prize--and a more accurate movie.</TE>

<HD>Enron Is but a Pebble in the Wave</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES P. PINKERTON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As expected, former Enron chief Ken Lay invoked the 5th Amendment and
refused to answer questions Tuesday on Capitol Hill.</LD>
<LD>   But much has been spoken about him: Fox News' Bill O'Reilly
compared him to Al Capone; Newsweek's Martha Brant to Osama bin
Laden. Lay surely did wrong, but at the same time, he had the right
idea.</LD>
<LD>   What idea was that? Trading electricity like every other
commodity. That's a good idea because only markets bring supply and
demand into equilibrium, thus preventing shortages and surpluses.
Only markets bring new ideas into production, and that's the essence
of economic growth.</LD>
<TE>   A look back at business history suggests that bad people often are
part of good trends. In the 19th century, for instance, the Next Big
Thing was railroads. A scandal involving Credit Mobilier, the holding
company for Union Pacific Railroad, blew up in 1872, walloping
Washington, even the White House. Yet that criminal fiasco did not
derail the industry that connected the country.</TE>
<TE>   Put simply, dynamic capitalism--the bringing together of buyers
and sellers in a fast-changing environment--is risky. Even honest
risk-takers are sometimes wrecked. Victor Niederhoffer was a
successful commodities trader in New York in the 1980s; he wrote
books about the business as well. And not long after he published
"The Education of a Speculator" in 1996, he made a bad bet, and his
$100-million hedge fund went bust.</TE>
<TE>   In spite of these disasters, the trend toward trading continues.
In the 1970s and '80s, sectors of the economy--notably
transportation, financial services and telecommunications--were
deregulated. In each case, the rush of new entrepreneurship brought
controversy and occasionally criminality, but Americans ultimately
were better off. At a time when more than half of Americans are
online, for instance, it's hard to think back just two decades, when
telecommunications innovation meant a push-button phone.</TE>
<TE>   Electricity deregulation will be a similar story of small steps,
missteps, sidesteps and, ultimately, a great leap forward. Three
decades ago, utilities were a series of state-regulated monopolies;
not surprisingly, each outfit was sleepy and inefficient. In
reaction, cost-conscious companies began to go off the grid, setting
up co-generators and micro-turbines that enabled them to generate
cheaper and more reliable power.</TE>
<TE>   So it was the reality, not ideology, that forced deregulation.
States such as Pennsylvania have been successful. In Philadelphia,
homeowners who shop around for power save an average of $10 a month.
Other states, including California, have botched their deregulation
schemes and ended up saddling consumers with even greater costs.</TE>
<TE>   But for all the storming and stressing over rival deregulatory
plans, few suggest that it's desirable or even possible to return to
the old days of cozy cost-plus production. This same
commodity-trading trend is visible everywhere. Russian electricity
mogul Anatoly B. Chubais was in Manhattan recently, pitching
investors on a plan for linking power grids across a Eurasian market,
from Lisbon to Vladivostok. Some say that Chubais is a nogoodnik, but
even if his proposal fails, someone's will succeed.</TE>
<TE>   The inevitability of a trend, of course, is not the same as the
integrity of a specific firm. Enron was "a badly run
commodity-trading company," says Mallory Factor, a New York merchant
banker. And of course, it may also prove to be a criminally run
company.</TE>
<TE>   But even if the top leaders of Enron all go to jail, the future
still belongs to market forces. So says Jeremy Shane, a veteran
utility industry trader: "In electricity, markets even out short-run
peaks and troughs and bring lower overall prices in the long run."
Electricity cannot remain a lethargic island in a fast-flowing sea of
competition.</TE>
<TE>   As lawmakers match Lay's legal silence with their own loud noise,
the electro-deregulatory trend will quietly continue, because nothing
can stop an idea whose time has come--not even a bunch of crooks.</TE>

<HD>Programs on an Oscar Nominations Joyride</HD>
<DH>Television* The big day yields stories for 'Access
Hollywood' and others.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL BROWNFIELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Big-name actors and the entertainment outlets that so desperately
need them engaged Tuesday in what has become a pro forma publicity
bonanza: Oscar nomination day. And as expected, everyone came out a
winner.</LD>
<LD>   The nominations yield stories that can be used in the countdown to
the ceremony by local morning shows, CNN and most especially the TV
programs and channels exclusively dedicated to entertainment news.
For them, nothing serves up a full plate of goodies quite like the
Oscars.</LD>
<LD>   "We compare it to the NCAA basketball tournament, when they
announce the 64 teams," "Access Hollywood" executive producer Rob
Silverstein said regarding nomination day.</LD>
<TE>   Silverstein's staff hit the ground running at 5:30 a.m. when the
nominations were unveiled, assembling its coverage in advance of a 1
p.m. deadline so "Access Hollywood" can be fed by satellite to TV
stations across the country. (The series is carried locally at 7:30
p.m. by KNBC-TV.)</TE>
<TE>   The coverage, of course, didn't stop at interviews, incorporating
analysis, handicapping of Oscar chances and other bits of ephemera.</TE>
<TE>   "It's harder than doing an awards show," Silverstein said. "An
awards show happens the night before, and you have 12 hours to put it
together."</TE>
<TE>   Whether the stars were overwhelmed or merely thrilled, getting
their reactions was a piece of business worked out well in advance.
Oscar season, after all, is about hype, and the right kind of hype
requires careful preparation. Thus, franchises such as E!
Entertainment Television, "Access Hollywood" and "Entertainment
Tonight" raced around town during the wee hours of Tuesday morning,
while studios blocked out interview time for anticipated Oscar
contenders.</TE>
<TE>   Publicists for "A Beautiful Mind" felt safe enough about the
film's nomination chances to pre-arrange a live "Today" show
appearance Tuesday with the film's director, Ron Howard, and best
supporting actress nominee Jennifer Connelly. Both are in Germany,
attending the Berlin Film Festival.</TE>
<TE>   "Invariably, it's part of the overall game plan, which is to win,"
said veteran publicist Stan Rosenfield, whose clients include Oscar
winners Robert De Niro and Geoffrey Rush as well as Will Smith, a
best actor nominee for "Ali." "You're always looking for ways to get
your client exposure. Here's a way to do it where you don't have to
offend anybody. You're reacting to a nomination. This is like getting
to kiss the princess in a movie."</TE>
<TE>   For Antonio Ruiz, executive producer of special events for cable's
E! Entertainment Television, the Oscar workday began sometime after
midnight, with his production crew scheduled to be at the Academy of
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' headquarters in Beverly Hills by
2:30 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   E! carried the nominations live as part of a special 90-minute
show that also included in-studio analysis and instant reaction from
nominees. Ruiz had a staff of about 25 at his command Tuesday, which
occasionally had to tread lightly in dealing with superstitious
nominees. "If you're camped out on their doorstep, [they think]
they're not going to win," he noted.</TE>
<TE>   Given the competition among outletst, Oscar nomination day also
has the potential to bring out the most cloying and dubious claims of
exclusivity. "Entertainment Tonight," for instance--which is known to
demand preferential camera positions at award shows and
premieres--likes to use the phrase "ET has learned" to impart
information readily available to anyone. Producers for the show
declined to be interviewed for this story.</TE>
<TE>   It may seem hard to believe, but coverage of the nominations
hasn't always been conducted with the scope and urgency of the
Olympics. A decade ago, experienced observers recall, the academy's
Samuel Goldwyn Theatre wasn't even full for the announcements, and
junior publicists, loaded down with change, phoned in the results
from a bank of pay phones.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, that was before the proliferation of cell phones, the
Internet and other mechanisms by which celebrity obsession has
spread. Small wonder that Oscar day is viewed with trepidation by
performers and their handlers, who can expect to be asked "How does
it feel?" roughly 500 times. As publicist Rosenfield put it, "The
questions are not going to put a smile on the ghost of Edward R.
Murrow."</TE>

"Groundhog Day," you have good reason. Many of the folks nominated
today have been and will be trotted up-and-down various red carpets
on televised awards shows leading up to the Oscars</TE>

<LD>On the Presidents Day weekend after their announcement, best picture
nominations gave a boost of more than $1 million to 14 of the 25
nominees over the last five years. (Ranked below by amount of dollar
increase.) Seven other films still in release at the time of their
nominations (three were long gone) added $150,000 to $800,000. Only
one best picture nominee in the last five years saw its gross decline
during the post-nominations weekend: "The Thin Red Line" (by $45,000,
to $1.87 million).</LD>
<LD>   Among current best picture nominees, "The Lord of the Rings: The
Fellowship of the Ring" has grossed $271.4 million to date; "A
Beautiful Mind" has taken in $113.3 million; "Gosford Park," $22
million; and "In the Bedroom," $19.3 million. Those four films are
still in theaters and certain to receive significant boosts this
weekend.</LD>
<LD>   The other best picture contender, "Moulin Rouge," earned $57.2
million in theaters and so far has amassed more than $70 million in
VHS and DVD income.</LD>

<HD>Punk Rock Revolutionary: The Legacy of Joey Ramone</HD>
<DH>Pop Music* The late singer's last album is a work of
musical range and emotional depth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD CROMELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You read the obituaries. He died before his time from cancer last
year, a former member of a music-altering, fashion-setting rock
quartet that is still influencing music years after its breakup.
Despite his low profile in recent years, his death struck his fans on
a deep, personal level.</LD>
<LD>   George Harrison? Well, sure. But it also describes Joey Ramone.</LD>
<LD>   Ramone, born Jeff Hyman, was the frontman for the Ramones, the New
York band that upended the music-biz applecart in the mid-'70s with
something called punk rock.</LD>
<TE>   Much as Harrison's death sent ripples through the now-calm waters
of the '60s generation's collective consciousness, Ramone's, last
April at age 49, jolted the children of the punk revolution, who
placed flowers at the door of his old haunt CBGB the way their elders
would later on the Beatles' Hollywood Boulevard star.</TE>
<TE>   But while Harrison's final music has yet to surface, Ramone's last
recorded testament comes out Tuesday. "Don't Worry About Me" is more
than a curiosity or a sentimental send-off. The record is a surprise
in many ways, from its musical range to its emotional depth. If the
Ramones were passing out pep pills on the street corner, so to speak,
Joey, older and on his own, is serving a full-course meal.</TE>
<TE>   You might expect Joey Ramone to do a Stooges song (he performs
"1969" here), but who would have guessed that he'd begin an album
with the utopian Louis Armstrong hit "What a Wonderful World"?</TE>
<TE>   To deliver the unexpected was one of the singer's goals when he
started the project a couple of years after the Ramones' 1996
breakup. For all the freedom punk rock afforded others, the style
eventually became a straitjacket for Joey, who chafed under its
constraints as the Ramones soldiered on for two decades.</TE>
<TE>   "Joey liked bands that challenged and changed," says Daniel Rey, a
longtime friend and collaborator and the new album's producer. "He
was a big fan of the Who, and they did rock operas."</TE>
<TE>   So when Joey got out on his own, there would be keyboards and
instrumental solos. He'd pile on the dynamic shifts, glimmering
textures and backing vocals. There would be introspection and
grown-up takes on spirituality and the state of the world.</TE>
<TE>   There would also be the lymphoma, diagnosed in 1994 and the
subject of the album's one angry rant, where Joey tersely repeats
such lines as "sitting in a hospital bed ... I want my life ... "</TE>
<TE>   But even that wrenching song--"I Got Knocked Down (But I'll Get
Up)"--comes with an upbeat subtitle. That optimism, along with a
vulnerability and sweetness, are the album's defining
characteristics.</TE>
<TE>   Where the Ramones got a laugh from cartoonish violence, Joey
grapples with the real thing now, perplexed by news of kids killing
kids and blowing up schools. He seems displaced, a decent guy who
can't quite figure out what's going on these days: "It's a different
world to me and I just don't understand."</TE>
<TE>   A frequent side effect of mature perspective is dull music, but
Ramone hasn't lost a step. His sob 'n' throb approach to "Wonderful
World" is a reminder of vintage Ramones crossed with Sex Pistols, and
the rest of the album frequently bursts with the exhilaration of
someone rediscovering a youthful purpose.</TE>
<TE>   In part it's a tour of his inspirations, from the New York Dolls
swagger of "Stop Thinking About It" to the pure Who homage of "Mr.
Punchy," with its la-la-las and oooo-oohs and playful
call-and-response chorus.</TE>
<TE>   But the most distinctive track is "Searching for Something," the
story of a woman's spiritual quest, which takes her from New York
City to an ashram upstate and then to India.</TE>
<TE>   With that subject matter, and with its whiff of "My Sweet Lord" in
the acoustic guitar arrangement, the song can be heard as a kind of
bridge between Ramone and Beatle.</TE>
<TE>   Modest Expectations for the New Album</TE>
<TE>   As much as it departs from his past, and as modest as Sanctuary
Records' commercial expectations are (the independent label's
director of marketing Meg Harkins says the company is shipping "a
couple hundred thousand" copies internationally), Joey's solo album
extends one of rock's most colorful story lines.</TE>
<TE>   The Ramones were formed in 1974, when Hyman and three Forest Hills
neighbors donned leather jackets and torn jeans and adopted their
shared surname. Like some kind of misfit superheroes, Joey, Johnny,
Dee Dee and Tommy Ramone were ready to take on the world with songs a
minute or two long, all introduced by Dee Dee's shout of 1-2-3-4.</TE>
<TE>   Alongside such peers as Talking Heads, Blondie, Patti Smith and
Television, they made a Bowery dive called CBGB the sudden nerve
center of a revolution that would bring down the wall between fans
and musicians.</TE>
<TE>   When disaffected working-class kids in England got wind of the
Ramones' beat and 'tude, punk rock assumed the weight of political
combat, and elsewhere the music evolved into nihilistic posturing.</TE>
<TE>   But the Ramones' rebellion was remarkably benign--a plea to loosen
the neckties and rediscover the freedom and lift they had felt in the
music of Phil Spector, the Beatles, the Who and the Kinks. Two of
Joey's greatest thrills would come when Spector produced a Ramones
album, and later when Joey produced a record by Spector's ex-wife,
the Ronettes' singer Ronnie Spector.</TE>
<TE>   The Ramones' strategy has proved a durable one, still serving as a
blueprint for such current hit acts as the Offspring and Blink-182.
In an interview during the Ramones' farewell tour in 1996, Joey was
asked about the many young bands that were earning a good living
recycling his band's recipe, and he had a firm reply.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nobody as good as the Ramones, never will be."</TE>
<TE>   The comment underscored a couple of things. Although the Ramones'
attack seemed simple to the point of primitivism, it wasn't that easy
to pull off, as many a wannabe punk band discovered. That precision
and regimented force were the products of a rare determination and
discipline, and its offbeat humor wasn't easily duplicated.</TE>
<TE>   But the statement also had a tone of defiance and defensiveness.
Joey felt the Ramones never received the respect they deserved, and
one of the saddest ironies in in his story is that eight months after
his death, the Ramones were voted into the Rock and Roll Hall of
Fame.</TE>
<TE>   They'll be inducted March 18, and later in the year, the
Columbia-affiliated DV8 label will release a tribute album to the
Ramones with a lineup that includes Eddie Vedder, the Red Hot Chili
Peppers, the Offspring and Green Day.</TE>
<TE>   They certainly didn't get that kind of respect at the beginning,
at least beyond the formative punk-rock world. I remember one day in
the mid-1970s when an acquaintance came by the office to ask why the
paper was devoting so much ink to punk. He was in the music
publishing field, an admirer of song craft and traditional musical
virtue, and he all but trembled as he complained about all this
attention going to "a guy who can't sing and looks like a fly!"</TE>
<TE>   Of course looking like a fly was one of the many cool things about
Joey Ramone, and his goofy, endearing singing was perfect for such
lyrics as "beat on the brat with a baseball bat, oh yeah" and "gimme
gimme shock treatment," in a way that, say, Michael Bolton's or
Christopher Cross' wouldn't have been.</TE>
<TE>   It all added up to the detonation that rock music, trapped in the
dead-end of disco and corporate rock, desperately needed.</TE>
<TE>   The band's blend of B-movie imagery, Mad magazine humor and holy
gibberish was simultaneously funny and trenchant, a genuine
expression of youthful frustration and alienation borne by a sound
that carried solace and solutions. Fans got the joke, but that didn't
diminish the music's ability to help them through an increasingly
chaotic and uncertain world.</TE>
<TE>   In his new role, Joey remains a guide for his contemporaries as
they begin creeping toward the unthinkable: middle age. From the
great beyond, he's reassuring them that they can still rock hard, and
still telling them to follow their heart instead of rules.</TE>

<HD>A Subdued Evening With Latinoamericano</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We look avidly to the Cuarteto Latinoamericano for its fearless,
feisty excursions into the vast, once-ignored Latin American quartet
repertoire. So then, what does one make of the program that they are
presenting on the Music Guild series this week, with only one of the
four works on tap of Latin American origin?</LD>
<LD>   In any case, the Cuarteto didn't seem to display much passion for
Brahms' String Quartet in A minor, Opus 51, No. 2 Monday night at Cal
State Northridge; even in passages where the players could have
broken out with some volatility, they sounded subdued, a bit flaccid.
Debussy's String Quartet also lacked fire, but at least they were
able to produce a soulfully hushed, concentrated stillness in the
third movement.</LD>
<LD>   The one Latin American work that they did play was the Villa-Lobos
String Quartet No. 5, the most immediately appealing quartet of the
composer's cycle of 17, and the one with the most overt Brazilian
folk influences.</LD>
<TE>   There was to be another piece on the program by Joaquin Turina,
but that was swapped for a brief early Puccini rarity, "Crisantemi,"
a melancholy single movement whose themes were later incorporated
into the opera "Manon Lescaut." The Cuarteto kept it moving fluidly,
limpidly and, thanks to their avoidance of schmaltz, effectively.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The program repeats tonight at 8 p.m. at the Wilshire-Ebell
Theatre, 4401 8th St., L.A. (310) 552-3030.</TE>

<HD>'Beautiful Mind' Script Was a Tortuous Journey for Its
Screenwriter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK GOLDSTEIN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"A Beautiful Mind" is often described as a film about Nobel
Prize-winning mathematician John Forbes Nash's harrowing journey into
schizophrenia. But the film, which earned eight Oscar nominations
Tuesday, is also the culmination of an intensely personal journey for
screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, whose script was nominated for best
screenplay adaptation.</LD>
<LD>   "I've probably been writing this story my whole life," says
Goldsman, 39, whose parents founded one of the first group homes for
childhood schizophrenia in the late 1950s in Brooklyn Heights. "I was
familiar with schizophrenia before I could even pronounce the word.
I'm terrified of many things in life, but mental illness is not one
of them. If you put somebody in a raging delusion a couple of inches
away from my face, I feel like I've come home."</LD>
<LD>   Goldsman was in Germany promoting the movie with the "Beautiful
Mind" cast when he learned of his nomination. "Upsettingly for a
writer, I didn't know what to say," he explained. "All I could think
was, 'This is not what happens to me. Oscar nominations are things
other people get.'"</LD>
<TE>   With its bouquet of nominations Tuesday, the Ron Howard-directed
movie has emerged as a leading Oscar best picture contender, despite
complaints that it takes broad liberties in sculpting Nash's personal
life. It also represents a huge career leap for Goldsman, who is best
known in Hollywood for writing crowd-pleasers like "Batman Forever"
and "The Client." In person, Goldsman is easy to underestimate; he
comes off like a neurotic Jewish comic, constantly joking about his
fears and phobias. His track record is equally easy to undervalue.
Most critics have dismissed him as a writer-for-hire.</TE>
<TE>   "You get paid a tremendous amount of money in Hollywood, so you
can't complain about bad reviews," he explains. "I'm proud of my
[John] Grisham films like 'The Client' and 'A Time to Kill,' which I
think are credible, grown-up movies. But it's true that I also got
farther and farther away from recognizing myself as a writer. Writing
'A Beautiful Mind' was a way of honoring my mother and father and the
kids they worked with."</TE>
<TE>   Goldsman admits he found it difficult growing up in a home
surrounded by mentally disturbed children. When he was 9, he told his
parents he didn't want anything to do with the kids they were working
with. "I was furious that they'd taken so much of my parents' time
away from me," he recalls. But the experience clearly shaped him as a
writer. "For me, writing has always been an attempt at structuring a
predictable environment out of what often seemed like an
unpredictable universe."</TE>
<TE>   By the time Goldsman went off to college at Wesleyan, he was
working with his parents again, eventually starting a consulting firm
that helped mental health workers create comprehensive treatment
environments. When he was 28, he found himself at Harvard's Kennedy
School, debating the merits of mandatory mainstreaming for mentally
and physically challenged children. "I was reasonably convincing," he
says. "But I thought, 'What if I've become my mother?' I love her,
but I don't want to be her."</TE>
<TE>   Goldsman had been writing all along but with little success. He
boasts of having a stack of rejection notices from the likes of the
New Yorker's Roger Angell and novelist Kurt Vonnegut. His thesis
advisor at Wesleyan "looked at my writing and told me to give it up."
And despite his success in Hollywood, Goldsman was far from anyone's
first choice when Imagine Entertainment acquired the rights to Sylvia
Nasar's biography of Nash, also titled "A Beautiful Mind."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Imagine almost didn't get the project. Company founder Brian
Grazer had first heard of the book when his friend, Vanity Fair
editor Graydon Carter, told him about an excerpt he'd published in
the magazine. Grazer was taken by the story but couldn't get the Nash
family to sell the rights. Months later, the family members changed
their minds, but by then rival producer Scott Rudin was pursuing the
rights too.</TE>
<TE>   Both producers pitched their takes on the book to the family.
Grazer eventually won out, paying the family and Nasar roughly $1.5
million for the movie rights. While Nasar's book had speculated about
Nash's homosexual relations, the movie rights agreement stipulated
that the subject of homosexuality would not be included in the film.</TE>
<TE>   The book attracted a host of writing talent, but Imagine Film's
co-chairman Karen Kehela lobbied heavily for Goldsman. The writer
came in with an irresistible visual pitch. "I told them, 'Imagine
being in a mental hospital with no roof, so we would first see Nash
in a room, talking to someone, and then see someone in every room in
the hospital, talking to someone who wasn't there.'"</TE>
<TE>   Goldsman got the job, but he almost lost it when he was slow to
deliver a first draft. "Honestly, this script was fueled by terror,"
he says. "I was trying to write my way back to the writer I thought I
should be, and I had no excuse if I [messed] it up." After months
passed with no sign of a script, Grazer was furious.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, Akiva's supposed to be so hungry to do this, where's the
[expletive] script? It made me nuts," Grazer recalls. "It took almost
a year just to get an outline--and then that didn't even reflect
Akiva's pitch, which made me really mad. That's when I started
telling everyone I was going to fire him."</TE>
<TE>   Goldsman conquered his writer's block and soon turned in a first
draft that was so "profound," as Grazer puts it, that Imagine soon
had a string of A-list directors lined up to do the film. Imagine
initially went with Robert Redford, but when Redford was delayed by
scheduling problems, Grazer encouraged Howard, his partner at
Imagine, to take the reins.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Goldsman says Howard worked closely with him on shaping the
script, especially in creating a strong emotional bond between Nash
and his wife, Alicia (played by Jennifer Connelly, an Oscar nominee
along with Crowe). "Ron wanted to make sure their relationship had
primacy throughout the whole story. The scene where Nash proposes to
her wasn't in the original script, but Ron felt we were missing a key
moment, and he was right."</TE>
<TE>   Still, critics have complained that the film overly romanticizes
the Nash marriage, which ended early on in divorce (though they were
remarried last June). Golds- man contends that the script accurately
reflects their emotional ties. "They were divorced," he says. "But
when John was ill, Alicia took him in and supported him for decades.
She was his tether; she kept him going. I don't believe John would've
lived long enough to get better without her."</TE>
<TE>   Goldsman is particularly unhappy with critics who say his script
sanitizes Nash's life by omitting several messy details, including
Nash's having fathered a child with a previous lover and his possible
sexual bonds with men.</TE>
<TE>   "The movie isn't about Nash's sexuality, and to say he is gay is
to politicize his sexuality," Goldsman argues. "In the 1950s,
homosexuality was considered a mental illness, and to tie those
things together in a movie made today does a disservice to Nash or
anyone else."</TE>
<TE>   For Goldsman, the most important acclaim for the film has come
from the critic he holds in highest esteem, his mother, Mira
Rothenberg, who at 80 still sees patients in private practice. "She
is a Holocaust survivor, so she's seen the real monsters that people
are running from in their minds," he says. "It meant a lot to me that
she enjoyed the film, because what's up there on screen comes from
what I learned from her. If nothing else, it honors what she's been
working on her whole life."</TE>

<HD>Barone Arranges a Melodic Evening</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's very likely that at some point in the future, enterprising
musicologists are going to discover a treasure trove of largely
unknown music from the 20th and 21st centuries. They will marvel at
the quality and creativity of what they uncover and be baffled by the
fact that it was so rarely heard at the time it was written.</LD>
<LD>   What music is that? The music that has been written and arranged
for rehearsal bands, Monday night bands and, at times, for the sheer
love of composing big band music.</LD>
<LD>   The performance by trombonist Mike Barone and an all-star
collection of Los Angeles players at the Jazz Bakery on Monday night
was a case in point. Well-crafted and imaginative, his arrangements
and compositions were consistently intriguing.</LD>
<TE>   An original, "Grungy Bungee," combined a perky melodic theme with
colorful woodwind textures and piquant harmonic dissonance. A version
of J.J. Johnson's "Lament" used shimmering flutes and clarinets to
underline Barone's trombone solo. And his takes on a pair of
standards, "How Deep Is the Ocean?" and "As Time Goes By," positioned
both the familiar tunes in novel settings, the former with an
undercurrent of Latin rhythm, the latter amid lush blocks of
orchestral sound.</TE>
<TE>   How often will this engaging music be heard? Probably rarely. Like
others who are drawn to writing for big jazz bands, Barone can only
pick up intermittent performance opportunities. This, despite the
fact that the personnel usually includes A-list musicians. Monday
night's aggregation, for example, included stellar efforts from,
among numerous others, tenor saxophonist Ernie Watts, alto
saxophonist Bill Perkins and trumpeter Ron King.</TE>
<TE>   What those future musicologists will realize, however, is that the
big band instrumentation typified by Barone's band represents, in
effect, the symphony orchestra of the 20th century.</TE>
<TE>   Its inherently balanced elements--a trumpet section, a trombone
section, a saxophone section and a rhythm section, sometimes playing
in tandem, sometimes independently--possess an almost limitless
potential for musical expression.</TE>
<TE>   At its peak, it served as a powerful voice for Duke Ellington,
Fletcher Henderson, Benny Carter, Sy Oliver, Quincy Jones, Ernie
Wilkins, Gil Evans and dozens of other gifted writers.</TE>
<TE>   Even today, despite the dominance of guitars, synthesizers and
musical electronica in general, it is an instrumentation that
persistently appeals to musicians and composers.</TE>
<TE>   Although big jazz bands like the Barone unit are now largely
relegated to the fringe areas of performance, they continue to
stimulate a body of work that one day will receive the acknowledgment
it deserves.</TE>

<HD>Oscar Makes Vintage Picks</HD>
<DH>Fashion *The academy indulges a historical preference for
period and fantasy looks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALLI HERMAN-COHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the last 40 years, modern-day clothes just haven't wowed academy
voters when it has come to costume design, no matter how cleverly
they were used. But the particularly diverse field of movies last
year raised the prospect that Oscar nominations would go beyond the
usual period and fantasy films.</LD>
<LD>   Academy members, however, held true to their voting record. All of
Tuesday's nominees designed historic or fantasy clothes. Nominee
Judianna Makovsky assumed she might not be a contender for "Harry
Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" because the movie featured many
modern costumes. "I was a little in shock this morning," she said
when reached at her Los Angeles home. Makovsky, whose first
nomination was for 1998's "Pleasantville," said contemporary clothes
typically don't impress academy voters. She was thrilled to break the
nomination news to her mentor in Italy, Milena Canonero, who also was
picked for "The Affair of the Necklace." Other nominees include
Catherine Martin and Angus Strathie for "Moulin Rouge," Ngila Dickson
and Richard Taylor for "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the
Rings," and Jenny Beavan for "Gosford Park."</LD>
<TE>   Beavan, who earned her eighth nomination in 18 years and won her
sole Oscar in 1986 for "A Room With a View," created 1930s-era,
upper- and servant-class clothing for a large and discerning cast of
actors. "The great thing about the nomination is that it is voted on
by other costume designers,'' Beavan said from London. She was
planning to celebrate Tuesday night with her 16-year-old daughter,
Caitlin, "in quite a gentle way,'' she said. "I've got to work
tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   The preference for period costume has been something of a sore
spot among designers, though they know they're not alone. "Great work
in all fields can be neglected at award time," said Hope Hanafin, a
Los Angeles costume designer who is co-chairing the upcoming Costume
Designers Guild awards. The guild awards were created four years ago
in part to help spread recognition to a broader range of costume
design work. Unlike the Oscars, the guild award categories
distinguish between contemporary and period or fantasy work, in film
and in television.</TE>
<TE>   Oddly, winning an Academy Award doesn't always hugely boost a
costume designer's career. Albert Wolsky, who won Oscars for "Bugsy"
and "All That Jazz" and snagged five nominations, notes that Oscar
didn't make him an overnight celebrity.</TE>
<TE>   "I never felt that all of a sudden, it changed things for me,"
said Wolsky, an L.A. resident and co-chair of the guild awards.</TE>
<TE>   The same is true for Beavan, who said that winning the Oscar
"helps you in slightly curious ways,'' such as helping her obtain
work permits outside of her native England.</TE>
<TE>   Directors of lavish costume movies appreciate Oscars, but bank on
experience in the wardrobe department, Hanafin observed.</TE>
<TE>   "The people who are nominated most often and receive the awards
already have substantial careers,'' she said, "so they would be
getting the work anyway. That's different from a breakout performance
by a director or an actor. It is rare that those breakout films have
the opportunity for breakout costumes, because of the [limited] scope
of them."</TE>
<TE>   The detail in the big-budget costume epics comes through in a
sample of last year's movie costume designs that are being readied
for public display at the Fashion Institute of Design and
Merchandising in downtown L.A. starting Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "In a movie, you just don't see some of the intricacy of these
costumes," said Robert Nelson, FIDM museum director. Visitors can see
the star-shaped rhinestones that adorn Nicole Kidman's corset and
shoes in "Moulin Rouge." They can appreciate the subtle blend of
textures and colors in the tweeds for Beavan's "Gosford Park," or
marvel at the intricacy of the armor in "Lord of the Rings."</TE>
<TE>   And they can, as always, believe a little more in the characters
and the fantasy that these clothes help create.</TE>

<CX>   Oscar nominations--In some editions of Wednesday's Calendar, a
photo caption for a "Moulin Rouge" costume incorrectly credited the
design to costumers from "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the
Ring." It should have credited Catherine Martin and Angus Strathie, who
are nominated for Academy Awards for best costume design for "Moulin
Rouge," and not Ngila Dickson and Richard Taylor, who are nominated in
that category for "Lord of the Rings."</CX>

<LD>"Don't tell anyone I said I was 40, because I totally intend to lie
about it in the press," Sheryl Crow said to the El Rey Theatre
audience during the birthday concert/party she threw for herself
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Well, if she keeps putting on shows like this one, she can say
she's any age she wants.</LD>
<LD>   It didn't hurt that celebrants included A-list guests both on
stage (Gwyneth Paltrow, Bonnie Raitt, Don Henley, Dwight Yoakam and
Doyle Bramhall II all sat in with Crow's band) and in the audience
(Meg Ryan, Anjelica Huston, Gwen Stefani, Chris Rock, David Spade,
Ellen DeGeneres, Laura Dern and Paltrow's mom, Blythe Danner, among
others, mixing with music business figures and actual paying fans).
But it was the birthday girl herself who set the tone for the
evening, showing that age is just a number.</LD>
<TE>   Starting with a buoyant version of the James Gang's "Walk Away," a
giddy Crow kept the mood loose and spirited for nearly two hours,
mixing a bunch of mostly '70s rock songs with some of her own biggest
hits and several enticing selections from her upcoming "C'mon, C'mon"
album, due April 9. The performances were rarely sloppy, even through
the parade of guests--testimony to Crow's leadership and the strength
of her band.</TE>
<TE>   Among the highlights: Raitt and Henley trading verses on Gregg
Allman's "Midnight Rider" and Boudleaux Bryant's "Love Hurts," with
Raitt teaming with Crow on the Rolling Stones' "Dead Flowers"; Yoakam
twanging up Cheap Trick's "I Want You to Want Me" and Queen's "Crazy
Little Thing Called Love"; and Crow and band reliving their youths
with the Move/ELO classic "Do Ya," Led Zeppelin's "Good Times Bad
Times" and Queen's "Tie Your Mother Down."</TE>
<TE>   Even in that illustrious set-list company, Crow's own songs held
their own. And, yes, Paltrow, introduced by Crow as "my backup
singer," proved a strong vocal partner on several songs.</TE>
<TE>   If Crow wants to give her fans a present, she'll play as if it's
her birthday every day.</TE>

<HD>A Tribute Fit for a Jazz Man</HD>
<DH>Music*  In the wake of pianist Nate Morgan's illness,
friends and musicians turn out in droves to perform at an
emotion-packed benefit in the Crenshaw District.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMORY HOLMES II</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The benefit concert for and tribute to pianist Nate Morgan at the
newly opened Jatkodd Cultural Fine Arts Center in the Crenshaw
District on Sunday was  most newsworthy for the window it provided to
a generally unnewsworthy dimension of L.A.'s African American
community. The art center sits in a formerly abandoned structure just
north of 43rd Street on Crenshaw Boulevard and houses a huge working
space with a loft, high walls and vaulted ceilings.</LD>
<LD>   Patrons eagerly paid $20 a head to see scores of Morgan's friends
and band mates perform--perhaps as many as 40 in all over the course
of the night. Each delivered highly emotional sets, which often fused
music with powerful elements of poetry or vocalese. There was food,
drink and plenty of loud chatter. From the loft to the stairwell and
out into the streets an exuberant, restless, standing-room-only crowd
never seemed to stop mutating with new colors and shapes, like a
single, living entity.</LD>
<LD>   Among the crowd were  luminaries of jazz, such as Pharoah Sanders
and Arthur Blythe, and from the local poetry scene, Ojenke and Otis
O'Solomon Smith, all of whom performed. And too, there were many of
Morgan's family and friends present. There was little distinction
between the crowd on the floor and the crowd on the stage throughout
the night at Morgan's combination birthday celebration and rent
party.</LD>
<TE>   The event seemed to highlight qualities of character that occur
with great frequency, but mostly without great fanfare throughout
L.A.'s African American community. Poet Kamau Daa'ood, one of the
events performers and organizers, may have put it best: "This is
nothing new," he said, during one of the night's breaks. "The
tradition of the community coming together to help its own at the
time of need is an ancient tradition.</TE>
<TE>   "And basically that's what we're tapped into and that's what we're
working with here. This is a labor of love--a labor of love for
Nate."</TE>
<TE>   Morgan, who turned 49 on Saturday, is a Los Angeles native and
product of local music schools and traditions. The talented pianist's
highly textured sound has been characterized in The Times by jazz
critic Don Heckman as "discreetly subversive" and "rhapsodic."</TE>
<TE>   But now Morgan is in the midst of a profound health crisis. The
father of six had been diagnosed with high blood pressure in 1999.In
December, he was rushed to the hospital following a performance at a
Christmas party.</TE>
<TE>   The paramedic who took Morgan's blood pressure on the night of his
emergency asked the pianist if he was still taking his blood pressure
medication. "I said no," recalls Morgan, "and he told me, 'Well,
you're about to kill yourself. You're about to have a stroke.'" It
was not a stroke, but kidney failure that Morgan suffered. "Now I'm
on dialysis four times a day and the bill keeps going up," Morgan
says, "even though I don't have the money for it. I don't know how
long that'll last."</TE>
<TE>   Morgan's financial plight, he said, is illustrative of the fate of
many Los Angeles-based musicians. Long-term bookings are increasingly
rare and many club owners prefer to pay cash, bypassing the
musicians' union, which provides medical coverage to members working
under contracts that require the employer, such as a club owner, to
pay into the union's health and welfare and pension funds..</TE>
<TE>   The benefit drew a succession of inspired performances. Notable
among them was the big band ensemble with which Morgan is most
associated, The Pan Afrikan Peoples Arkestra--commonly known as the
Ark--under the direction of Michael Session; and the Great Voice of
UGMAA (Union of God's Musicians and Artists Ascension), directed by
and featuring stand-out vocalist, Dwight Trible. The Ark, by any
measure a remarkable ensemble of singers and musicians (and poet
Daa'ood), and the accompanying Voice of UGMAA may be one of L.A.'s
most neglected local treasures.</TE>
<TE>   On this night, Morgan was a beneficiary of an informal, yet
effective grass-roots effort that binds the artist together with his
community in a system of support. The most influential exponent of
this reciprocal arrangement was the late jazz pianist and composer,
Horace Tapscott, who founded the Ark and who died in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Mentor to Morgan and many of the other musicians, singers and
poets on stage at the Jatkodd center, Tapscott's policy was simple:
When the community is in crisis, the artists must respond, and when
the artists are in crisis, the community must do likewise.</TE>
<TE>   This,  opined Tapscott, is the way a community and its artists
grow rich and prosper. Following one of his many sets in the evening,
Trible said, "Number one, when you get involved in this music, you're
not involved for the money in the first place. So that's why I can
say there ain't nobody richer than me right at this moment."</TE>
<TE>   Jazz scholar and author Steven Isoardi, who has written two books
on the history and significance of jazz in Los Angeles, characterized
the Tapscott self-help doctrine in this way: "It has always been a
struggle. But the thing that has attracted me to this music was that
element of selflessness; of serving something higher than yourself;
of a rejection of all the values of capitalism that are so
sickeningly pervasive now. Horace stood for an alternative. And a lot
of people supported that and came around it. And you can tell by the
people here today and the feeling inside that it lives through these
people. You can feel it in the music."</TE>
<TE>   Poet Daa'ood said, "You know, Nate has served this community for
over 30 years. One of my mentors talks about being 'wounded with a
blessing.' I think the work that Nate is doing in terms of serving a
given community is important work. It feeds people at a very basic
level. And this society has to find ways of doing what a lot of other
societies have been doing since ancient times, and that's supporting
the artists that feed people and nourish people's spirits. And that's
why we're here today. It's to help Nate in a time of need with his
six kids and his wife at a time when he can't work. We're here to
lift him up like he's lifted us up through his music over the years."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>There was a time when a dismissive, rhyming reference to TV as a
certain kind of "tube" highlighted the medium's perceived role in
dumbing-down society, hypnotizing the masses with eyeglass-inducing
pabulum.</LD>
<LD>   Like so much in the modern media, however, subtlety has given way
to a more blunt and literal translation.</LD>
<LD>   Skin, in case you haven't noticed, is in these days in a big way,
including the confines of prime-time television. Not that it was ever
out, mind you, for anyone who remembers the "jiggle" shows of the
1970s or, before that, Barbara Eden's famous midriff (and, bowing to
the now-quaint standards of the day, carefully obscured navel) on "I
Dream of Jeannie." It's just that any pretext of dressing up this
fascination with dressing down appears to have been dropped.</LD>
<TE>   Consider the Playboy Playmate edition of "Fear Factor" coinciding
with this month's rating sweeps, ABC's prime-time "Victoria's Secret
Fashion Show" during the November sweeps, Fox's planned "Who Wants to
Pose for Playboy?" pageant for the upcoming May sweeps (see a theme
here yet?) and Fox's "Temptation Island 2," which quietly sinks into
the Nielsen sunset this week despite a steady dose of cleavage plus
some honest-to-gosh sex. Even last week's "Friends" got into the act,
with Monica celebrating Valentine's Day by modeling lingerie and
bringing home a porn video for her appreciative husband, Chandler.</TE>
<TE>   Much has been written about vigorous cost-saving initiatives at
the major networks, but the influx of women parading around in
underwear can't be blamed on cutbacks in the wardrobe budget.</TE>
<TE>   Obvious as they might seem, the real reasons are more layered and
complex, beginning with a mainstreaming of pornography (so much so
that PBS' "Frontline" weighed in on the topic last week) as well as
material that doesn't quite rise to that level. In concert with this,
shows eager to appear irreverent have reacted to complaints about the
media's objectification of women by flouting such criticism, from
Comedy Central's "The Man Show," with its "girls on trampolines"
feature; to Howard Stern's radio and E! TV program, showcasing
strippers, porn stars and the Internet's sundry "pinup" divas,
offering easily download-able companions for the very lonely.</TE>
<TE>   Helping fuel this anti-feminist backlash is the greater viability
of programs targeting narrow audiences as the viewing pie is sliced
into smaller segments. In short, an inexpensive series like "The Man
Show" can endure with a relatively small audience, providing that its
viewers fall into a demographically desirable age bracket prone to
drinking lots of beer, playing video games and wearing Nikes.</TE>
<TE>   Cable channels, which lack the lofty circulation of the major
networks, have glommed onto this strategy as a means of garnering
attention, giving rise to E!'s "Vegas Showgirls" or A&amp;E's "Inside the
Playboy Mansion," which repeats this Friday. Notably, an event at the
Playboy Mansion to promote the A&amp;E special dutifully brought out
camera crews from several local TV stations, unable to resist the
lure of playmate flesh as a tease for their 10 o'clock newscasts. And
while A&amp;E hasn't abandoned stately costume dramas, the network would
be hard-pressed to generate such publicity had it not temporarily
dispensed with the costumes.</TE>
<TE>   If all this points toward a shift in attitudes, it's more
evolutionary than revolutionary. For while such judgments are
admittedly subjective, prime-time television is more "dirty" than
truly vulgar, its treatment of sexuality (with the exception of a few
high-minded dramas) rife with the sort of innuendo-laden material
aimed at 12-year-old boys. The new wrinkle, if it amounts to one, is
an emphasis on appealing to those boys' older brothers and fathers
with a slightly more titillating approach.</TE>
<TE>   Granted, some of these programs have fallen on their face
ratings-wise, including the much-ballyhooed "Fear Factor" versus the
Super Bowl halftime and post-game shows. Sadly, the highlight was
watching host Joe Rogan plead with the reluctant playmates to plunge
into ice-cold water for a swimming stunt, reminding you of every
pathetic fraternity boy you've seen in a bar near closing time.</TE>
<TE>   Still, given the pervasiveness of such fare, it's hard to
determine if viewers were outraged or simply blase because, frankly,
they can find better, more revealing displays elsewhere. After all,
beyond the actual porn available to most satellite and cable
subscribers (no brown paper bags required), pay channels dole out
plenty of gratuitous nudity after 11 p.m., even if they seek to
cultivate Emmy Awards earlier in the evening.</TE>
<TE>   None of this sits particularly well with self-appointed guardians
of morality, who sought to eradicate smut from the airwaves under the
guise of forcing networks to label programs with content ratings,
such as TV-14 or TV-MA. After much hemming, hawing and indignant talk
about undermining the Constitution, the networks complied--and now
find themselves able to put on pretty much what they want to the
extent that advertisers (who keep pushing the boundaries of taste
themselves) will tolerate it, politely telling critics, "We warned
you, so change channels or turn off the set."</TE>
<TE>   Welcome to the world of unintended consequences, or so much for
the best-laid plans of mice and ministers. No wonder watchdog groups
were fed up enough to petition the Federal Communications Commission,
contending that the Fox series "Boston Public," set in a high school,
violates indecency guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   Not to rain on their parade, but commission chairman Michael
Powell has made clear that he prefers marketplace solutions over
government intervention, so the odds of the FCC springing into action
are about as likely as Venezuela, with its four competitors, sweeping
the Winter Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   In the face of all this half-naked evidence, it's easy to
criticize programmers for crass cynicism, until you realize how often
their baser impulses have been rewarded. To that extent, viewers who
reliably show up for showgirls (and we know who we are) bear
complicity for the fact that we get playmate "Fear Factor" at
halftime instead of "Masterpiece Theatre."</TE>
<TE>   As for those seeking to pressure or shame broadcasters into
exercising greater restraint, the networks may cloak themselves in
freedom and apple pie, but the bare, no-frills response would read as
follows: "Hey, times are tough. We will when you do."</TE>

<LD>   Documentary Ruffling White House Feathers</LD>
<LD>   Advisors to President Bush aren't happy with a documentary
premiering at the South by Southwest Film Conference and Festival in
Austin, Texas, next month. The fun-loving antics captured on
celluloid, they fear, could undermine the new square-jawed image sent
out by the chief executive.</LD>
<TE>   The 75-minute "Journeys With George" was shot by Alexandra Pelosi,
who covered the campaign as a producer for NBC. Bush not only sat
down for interviews, she says, but also came up with the name of the
movie.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not a George Bush blooper tape," said Pelosi, 31, who is
the daughter of Nancy Pelosi, the new House Democratic whip. "This is
the campaign experience from my seat."</TE>
<TE>   In one scene, Bush is shown wading through throngs of journalists
who are sipping margaritas in the back of the presidential campaign
plane. "These are my people," he says. "It takes an animal to know an
animal. And I'm not admitting I'm an animal with 50 days to go in the
campaign." Though the President doesn't break his sobriety, Pelosi
shows him drinking a nonalcoholic beer with gusto--something other
photographers were forbidden to shoot.</TE>

<TE>   Insurer Lashes Out at Transplant Drama</TE>
<TE>   In New Line Cinema's movie "John Q," opening Friday, a distraught
father played by Denzel Washington is trying to get a heart
transplant for his ailing 9-year-old son. Unable to get an organ
through the proper channels or to convince his employer to cover the
procedure, he takes the emergency room hostage.</TE>
<TE>   The plot is not only a stretch, it's downright inaccurate, said
the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Though transplant demand has nearly quadrupled in the last decade,
there is a nationwide network of centers set up to address the need,
the health insurance carrier said.</TE>
<TE>   "This kind of fiction reinforces ridiculous stereotypes about
health care, glorifies violence as a means of problem-solving and
needlessly frightens the public," said Dr. Allan Korn, chief medical
officer for the group.</TE>
<TE>   The criticism took New Line by surprise. "We find it curious that
Blue Cross/Blue Shield would issue a four-page press
release--especially since the film makes it very clear that John Q
has an issue with his employer, not his insurer," spokeswoman
Christina Kounelias said Tuesday. "In any case, the movie is only a
dramatic 'what if'--and we made every effort to be accurate."</TE>

4,500 acres in north San Diego County.</TE>
<TE>   The two-time Grammy-winner was on tour and had just performed at
the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics. She rushed back to
Fallbrook expecting her home to be in ruins. The walls were scorched,
and her 24-acre avocado grove was badly burned. But the house was
intact.</TE>

peak will now be restricted to one night--Thursdays.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning March 4, the Damon Wayans sitcom, "My Wife and Kids,"
will get its second slot of the week, Mondays at 8 p.m. Because the
show will still run on Wednesdays, the Monday airing will be mostly
reruns.</TE>
<TE>   It will be followed on Mondays by "The Wayne Brady Show," a
variety program that did well in a limited run last summer, and the
game show "The Chair," starring John McEnroe. The ratings-challenged

<HD>African American Picks Make Oscar History</HD>
<DH>Minorities * Nominations of Smith and Washington mark first
time two blacks have competed for best actor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LORENZA MUNOZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Academy Award nominations of Will Smith ("Ali"), Denzel
Washington ("Training Day") and Halle Berry ("Monster's Ball") have
made this a historic Oscar season. It's the first time two African
American males have been nominated in the best actor category. Also,
Berry is the first black woman nominated for best actress since
Angela Bassett in 1993 for "What's Love Got to Do With It."</LD>
<LD>   "I'm hoping that given the climate and the new awareness that has
been created around this issue of diversity, this won't be something
that will be here today and gone tomorrow," said NAACP President
Kwesi Mfume. "But the wonderful thing about all of this is that each
one of these individuals got this nomination because of their skill
level and not because of their skin color."</LD>
<LD>   It has been 30 years since so many black actors have been honored.</LD>
<TE>   In 1972 Diana Ross ("Lady Sings the Blues") and Cicely Tyson
("Sounder") were nominated for best actress, Paul Winfield
("Sounder") was nominated for best actor and "Sounder" was nominated
for best film. Though none of them won, never had so many nonwhite
actors been nominated in the same year.</TE>
<TE>   In a phone interview, Smith said it's time more blacks were
recognized.</TE>
<TE>   "I view it as we blacks in America are 13% of the population and
we have to work that much harder to be noticed. Black America will be
smiling for the next couple of weeks."</TE>
<TE>   Berry said the nominations signal a step in the right direction.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so proud to be a part of this," she said via telephone from
London. "What this means to me is that things are changing.... It is
a big deal that three black people have been nominated.... This is
one big, huge step in that goal toward equality--not just in movies
but in life."</TE>
<TE>   Washington, who has been nominated five times and won best
supporting actor for "Glory" in 1989, was unavailable for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Until this year, the Academy Awards have been bleak reminders of
how far Hollywood has to go in diversifying its casts and story
lines. For films from 1990 through 1999, only 19 nonwhites (including
Asians, Native Americans, African Americans and Latinos), or about 8%
of the nominees, were included in the top five categories: actor,
actress, supporting actor, supporting actress and director. Only
two--Whoopi Goldberg (supporting actress in "Ghost") and Cuba Gooding
Jr. (supporting actor in "Jerry Maguire")--won. Never has an African
American won best actress.</TE>
<TE>   Sidney Poitier, who won for leading actor in 1963 for "Lilies of
the Field," is the only black actor to ever receive an Oscar in this
category.</TE>
<TE>   The bleak nomination statistics are made more puzzling by the
extent of nonwhite talent in Hollywood. More than 19% of the Screen
Actors Guild membership and nearly 8% of the Directors Guild of
America is African American, Latino or Asian. According to the Motion
Picture Assn. of America, in 1999 nearly 30% of the American
moviegoing audience was Latino, African American or Asian.</TE>
<TE>   These statistics have prompted protests, separate awards
ceremonies for minorities and forums on diversity in Hollywood. But
attempts to draw attention to the issue, such as the Rev. Jesse
Jackson's 1996 protest outside the Oscars, have proved fruitless.</TE>
<TE>   "The best help is what has happened this year," said Berry. "That
speaks more than any picket outside of any venue."</TE>

<HD>Business as Usual for New Line Cinema</HD>
<DH>Studios* Excitement over 13 nominations for its 'Lord of
the Rings' is tempered by work to be done.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD NATALE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's Oscar nomination morning at New Line Cinema's Los Angeles
headquarters on Robertson Boulevard. The dawn has brought the company
13 nominations for the fantasy blockbuster "The Lord of the Rings:
The Fellowship of the Ring," including the company's first for best
picture (although its art-house division Fine Line Features picked up
a best picture nod for 1996's "Shine"). In the history of the Academy
Awards, only two films, 1997's "Titanic" and 1950's "All About Eve,"
received more nominations (14).</LD>
<LD>   Elation is tempered by the need to put finishing touches on the
post-nominations campaign, to capitalize on the box-office bump a
movie with this many nominations usually receives. Employees, who
have been at work since before the nominations were announced at 5:38
a.m., gulp down lox and bagels while New Line marketing heads Russell
Schwartz and Rolf Mittweg finalize two new TV spots, one emphasizing
action and the other the film's epic scope.</LD>
<LD>   In another part of the office, Gordon Paddison, who oversees
Internet marketing, is preparing spots for the Hollywood Reporter and
Variety online sites featuring interviews with nominees in all
categories, including the technical (costume design, score)
contributors to the film.</LD>
<TE>   "Rings" trilogy producer Mark Ordesky, who has been on the project
for 31/2 years, checks in from New Zealand where he and nominated
director Peter Jackson have been "up all night playing Risk,"
awaiting the nominations, which they saw on BBC World.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson has been on the phone nonstop and is on his way to a live
satellite feed before flying to the U.S. and points abroad for more
personal appearances. At the same time, he's editing the second
"Rings" installment, "The Two Towers."</TE>
<TE>   Having already grossed more than $690 million worldwide, the first
installment of the J.R.R. Tolkien trilogy will more than recoup the
$300-million production budget for the series and set the stage for
the two sequels, due this December and next. "There's no question
that the Oscar nominations and the awards the film has already won
have helped build momentum for the next two films," says Robert
Shaye, New Line's founder and co-chairman.</TE>
<TE>   While the best picture nomination validates the film's artistic
integrity, it should also propel its domestic gross over the
$300-million mark. The nominations give distribution head David
Tuckerman leverage to retain theaters over the Presidents Day
weekend, even with five new movies opening, including New Line's own
"John Q," starring best actor nominee Denzel Washington (for
"Training Day").</TE>
<TE>   With the second-largest foreign market yet to open--Japan, where
the film debuts in early March--the film could add more than $100
million, Mittweg says. The "Rings" movies also have already been sold
to AOL Time Warner's broadcast television division for about $160
million.</TE>
<TE>   It's amazing what a difference a single movie can make, especially
one that no other company wanted to attempt. Only New Line was
willing, at Shaye's suggestion, to commit to three movies instead of
the two Jackson originally had envisioned.</TE>
<TE>   Prior to the film's December release, Shaye wondered aloud whether
his 35-year-old company's days were numbered. For decades Shaye had
struggled to elevate New Line from a provider of low-budget
exploitation flicks to a major independent company through the
success of such films as the "Nightmare on Elm Street" series and
"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles." Then came "Austin Powers" and "Rush
Hour," and their sequels, the most profitable movies the company had
released until "Rings."</TE>
<TE>   Based on his gamble on the "Rings" trilogy and some conspicuous
flops like "Little Nicky" starring Adam Sandler" and "Town and
Country" starring Warren Beatty, however, Shaye was no longer allowed
to greenlight any film budgeted at more than $50 million. If the
first "Rings" had failed, New Line would have been stuck with damaged
goods, and AOL Time Warner Chairman Richard Parsons had made it no
secret he was considering consolidating the company with Warner Bros.</TE>
<TE>   Success of "Rings" has reversed the company's fortunes. Among
films released last year, "Rings" is second only to Warner Bros.'
"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," which has grossed about $900
million worldwide (the second installment is due in November, a month
before "The Two Towers").</TE>
<TE>   New Line received another bonus by securing a best actor
nomination for Sean Penn in "I Am Sam." With "John Q" tracking well
in audience surveys for this weekend and another potentially
lucrative summer release in the third "Austin Powers" movie, the
62-year-old Shaye, Hollywood's longest-enduring film company head,
has no plans to depart on a high note and retire. "To paraphrase
Stanley Kubrick," he says, "retire from what?"</TE>

<HD>Furtado Showcases Her Many Influences</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NATALIE NICHOLS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a playful move that offered a hint at the kind of artist she
aspires to be, Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter Nelly Furtado took
the Wiltern Theatre stage on Monday following a fanfare that recalled
"Purple Rain"-era Prince.</LD>
<LD>   Not that the 23-year-old Canadian--who is up for best new artist
and several other awards associated with her 2000 debut album, "Whoa,
Nelly!"--sounded at all like Prince on this sold-out first of two
consecutive nights at the Wiltern.</LD>
<LD>   But the nearly 90-minute show aimed for the multifaceted appeal of
the erstwhile Artist in his heyday, or, perhaps more appropriately,
of the unpredictable Beck.</LD>
<TE>   If Furtado's vision isn't as arresting, it's just as organic.
Blending sass and introspection with unsinkable vigor, the engaging
performer's songs incorporated many influences, including styles from
Portugal (her parents are from that nation's Azores island group),
Brazilian rhythms, R&amp;B-pop and modern rock.</TE>
<TE>   It's the sort of thing that once upon a time might have been
deemed too confusing for a pop audience, but largely thanks to the
mainstream absorption of hip-hop styles, Furtado's mostly young fans
take it all in stride, making her a rising star and Grammy contender
rather than merely an interesting eccentric.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, this time the singer-guitarist and her band more strongly
emphasized the hip-hop aspect of her work, not just by goofing on
Missy Elliott's massive "Get Ur Freak On" and LL Cool J's 1991 hit
"Mama Said Knock You Out," but also in a musical presentation that
was even more percussive than in her previous shows.</TE>
<TE>   But all the thumping on such upbeat numbers as the defiant "Baby
Girl" diminished the impact of Furtado's agile, quirky vocals, which
skipped among scatting, freestyling and crooning. Other times the
tunes proved less substantial, despite the undeniable catchiness of
such standouts as the wistful folk-pop hit "I'm Like a Bird."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, although Furtado mixes up what should be a signature sonic
complex, in concert her high-energy persona doesn't quite translate
to actual individuality. Maybe the set's breakneck pace and the
restless genre-jumping are meant to make up for a lack of depth. Or
maybe she just needs to relax and not let ambition overwhelm her.</TE>

<HD>Chasing the Gold</HD>
<DH>'The Lord of the Rings' nearly ties a record; 'Beautiful
Mind' and 'Moulin Rouge' come on strong.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT W. WELKOS and SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth, the fate of civilization depends
upon a gold ring. In Hollywood, fates are ruled by a gold statuette.
And each quest can be epic.</LD>
<LD>   Appropriately enough, the fantasy "The Lord of the Rings: The
Fellowship of the Ring" received 13 Academy Award nominations
Tuesday, including best picture, director and supporting actor--one
short of the record of 14 held by "All About Eve" and "Titanic."</LD>
<LD>   "A Beautiful Mind," the odyssey of schizophrenic math professor
and Nobel laureate John Nash, and "Moulin Rouge," a lavish,
expressionistic musical, each received eight nominations, including
best picture.</LD>
<TE>   Also nominated for best picture were "Gosford Park," a seriocomic
tale of love, lust and murder at an English country estate, which
collected seven nominations, and "In the Bedroom," an intimate drama
about a family tragedy, which garnered five nominations.</TE>
<TE>   What has already been an expensive and vigorously waged Oscar
campaign will culminate March 24 at the 74th annual Academy Awards,
as the show returns for the first time in four decades to the heart
of Hollywood and moves into its new home, the Kodak Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   Like Tolkien's literary masterpiece, this year's Oscar race seems
fraught with uncertainty and obstacles.</TE>
<TE>   Will New Zealand-born actor Russell Crowe, who was nominated
Tuesday for best actor in "A Beautiful Mind," win back-to-back
Oscars, a feat only accomplished in this category by Spencer Tracy
and Tom Hanks?</TE>
<TE>   Will Ron Howard, director of "A Beautiful Mind," finally erase the
curse of Richie Cunningham and Opie Taylor by grabbing his first
Oscar?</TE>
<TE>   Will Halle Berry be the first African American woman to win best
actress, for her role in "Monster's Ball"? Or will Denzel Washington
or Will Smith become the first African American actor to win the best
actor Academy Award since Sidney Poitier received the Oscar for
1963's "Lilies of the Field"?</TE>
<TE>   First-time nominee Smith--who is in Australia with his wife and
"Ali" co-star, actress Jada Pinkett Smith, and their children--said
they were asleep when his publicist phoned shortly before 1 a.m. to
say he had been nominated for "Ali." His wife became so excited she
jumped out of bed and struck her head on the door.</TE>
<TE>   "I got her some ice and aspirin and when we settled down she said,
'Baby, we are going to the big dance,'" Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time in its seven-decade history, the Academy of
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has created a new category for
animated films. All the inaugural nominees were spawned by computer:
the fairy tale spoof "Shrek," the comedy "Monsters, Inc." and the
offbeat "Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius."</TE>
<TE>   Like Frodo and his odd assortment of friends who go on an epic
journey in Tolkien's beloved novel, this year's best actor nominees
are an eclectic group of contenders.</TE>
<TE>   There is the brooding Crowe, who won the Oscar last year as the
Roman general-turned-slave in "Gladiator" and was nominated the
previous year as the tormented cigarette industry whistle-blower in
"The Insider."</TE>
<TE>   Then there is the usually hot-tempered Sean Penn, who plays a
mentally challenged man fighting to retain custody of his young
daughter in "I Am Sam"; the usually affable Smith, who portrays famed
boxer Muhammad Ali in the biopic "Ali"; the usually heroic
Washington, who goes against type by playing a crooked undercover
narcotics cop in "Training Day"; and the usual supporting player Tom
Wilkinson, who plays a grieving father seeking revenge in "In the
Bedroom."</TE>
<TE>   The leading actress nominees are no less diverse.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Berry's turn as a widow of an executed convict who falls
in love with a racist prison guard, this year's nominees include
former Oscar winner Judi Dench as the Alzheimer's-stricken writer
Iris Murdoch in "Iris," Nicole Kidman as the ill-fated courtesan in
"Moulin Rouge," former Oscar winner Sissy Spacek as the anguished
mother in "In the Bedroom" and Renee Zellweger as an lovelorn,
overweight woman looking for Mr. Right in London in the comedy
"Bridget Jones's Diary."</TE>
<TE>   Reached in London, where she is filming the next James Bond movie,
Berry commented on the fact that she is one of the handful of African
American actresses to have been nominated in this category.</TE>
<TE>   "Never in my life did I think I'd be nominated for an Oscar," she
said. "Women of color are rarely at these kinds of things."</TE>
<TE>   Spacek, who received her first Academy Award for 1980's "Coal
Miner's Daughter," said this nomination "makes everything a little
bit sweeter."</TE>
<TE>   "I am older now, and I realize how rare it is to find these magic
projects," the 52-year-old actress said from her home in Virginia.
"When you are young, you think they are all going to be like that."</TE>
<TE>   One of the day's surprises had to be Zellweger. The blond Texan,
who is filming the musical "Chicago" in the Windy City, said she
turned on the TV and was "overwhelmed" when she learned of her first
nomination.</TE>
<TE>   "I am elated," said Zellweger who gained 20 pounds for the part of
Bridget, laughing that she did it the old-fashioned way. "I used my
fingers and ate pizza and doughnuts."</TE>
<TE>   In one of the more hotly contested categories, the best supporting
actor nominations went to Jim Broadbent for "Iris," Ethan Hawke for
"Training Day," Ben Kingsley for "Sexy Beast," Ian McKellen for "The
Lord of the Rings" and Jon Voight for "Ali."</TE>
<TE>   Reached in London, McKellen said he was "riding high" after
getting the good news. "One of 13 [nominations] is a lucky number
this morning," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Vying for supporting actress were two stage and screen veterans:
Helen Mirren and two-time Oscar-winner Maggie Smith. In "Gosford
Park," Mirren plays the steely head of the downstairs staff at a
sumptuous British mansion and Smith the snobby eccentric upstairs
matron.</TE>
<TE>   Going up against them are three relatively younger actresses who
have worked for years in the business: Jennifer Connelly in "A
Beautiful Mind," former Oscar winner Marisa Tomei in "In the Bedroom"
and Kate Winslet in "Iris." Winslet, who has been nominated twice
before, is playing the younger version of Dench's character, Iris
Murdoch.</TE>
<TE>   Tomei, who won best supporting actress for the 1992 comedy "My
Cousin Vinny," said her feelings regarding her nomination for her
dramatic role in "In the Bedroom" are "pretty raw and pretty pure. I
feel pretty happy. There is a mix of joy and being grateful and
stunned and proud of Sissy and Tom and [director] Todd [Field] and
just grateful."</TE>
<TE>   In a town obsessed with youth, Robert Altman, who turns 77 next
week, was nominated for "Gosford Park," his fifth nomination in this
category in a lengthy career.</TE>
<TE>   Other directors named Tuesday include three-time nominees Ridley
Scott, the director of last year's best film, "Gladiator," for "Black
Hawk Down," and David Lynch, for "Mulholland Drive," and first-timers
Ron Howard for "A Beautiful Mind" and Peter Jackson for "The Lord of
the Rings."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, speaking by phone from his home in Wellington, New
Zealand, where he had gathered with his co-writers and other members
of his creative team, said he learned he was nominated while playing
the board game "Risk" and watching a tape of his Oscar rival, Lynch's
film "Mulholland Drive."</TE>
<TE>   "I think the biggest challenge for us was the script," said
Jackson, who's deep in post-production on the second of three films
based on the Tolkien novels. "It was the most fiendishly difficult
book to adapt."</TE>
<TE>   Lynch, who was shunned by the Directors Guild of America for
"Mulholland Drive," said he was surprised at receiving his third
Oscar nomination. "I didn't think it was going to happen," he said,
noting that "Mulholland Drive" began as an unsold TV pilot. "It has
had a very strange path. It's just like Mulholland Drive itself. It
is a long, very winding, narrow path, and it ended up in a pretty
good gosh-darn place."</TE>
<TE>   Howard, who is in Germany, where "A Beautiful Mind" is being shown
at the Berlin Film Festival, noted that twice before in his career he
failed to receive recognition from the academy although he had been
nominated by the DGA for "Cocoon" (1985) and won the guild's top
prize for "Apollo 13" in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   "I certainly didn't know what to expect here today," Howard said.
"It's gratifying and it means a lot to me. On the other hand, my
heart goes out to some people who were anticipating the possibility
that they could be nominated today. Their names weren't called. I
understand how that feels."</TE>
<TE>   Though his film "In the Bedroom" is nominated for best picture and
he is nominated for best adapted screenplay, Field did not receive a
directing nomination.</TE>
<TE>   The outspoken Zwigoff said he was surprised by his nomination
because "I don't agree with most of the [academy's] choices." He
added: "I was happy for David Lynch. I thought he well deserved it."
Asked if he would be attending the awards, he replied, "My wife
really wants to go, so I guess I'm going. Maybe they will give me a
free suit. I need a new suit."</TE>

<LD>Indifferent to hoopla and buzz, the sidewalks around the intersection
of Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue came to life slowly
Tuesday. Scents of coffee, mustard and doughnuts floated out into the
balmy winter morning. Beneath a mammoth, beaming Britney Spears
billboard, a smattering of tourists in shorts and cameras walked
around workers mopping the Walk of Fame. To the sounds of Latin music
and drive-time radio coming from souvenir shops, purple-haired,
black-clad business people passed schoolchildren, the odd derelict or
midnight cowboy.</LD>
<LD>   Only a team from Japanese public television taping the entrance to
the new Kodak Theatre testified to the impending shift of the Academy
Awards to the neighborhood after years of being held at the Dorothy
Chandler Pavilion and the Shrine Auditorium.</LD>
<LD>   But behind the quiet street scene, there were plenty of opinions
about the effect of the March 24 Oscar ceremonies--and they were
mixed.</LD>
<TE>   "It's going to hurt us very much," said Dody Urban, chief
supervisor of Starbucks in the new Hollywood &amp; Highland complex, in
between serving a long line of customers. Like most shops in the
adjacent block, she expects hers will be closed by authorities on
Oscar Sunday for security reasons.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, Glen LaCour, who runs an international student
hostel next door, said he's already rented every room to the Academy
of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to allow security police access
to the roof. Residents will be forced to relocate for at least one
night.</TE>
<TE>   Finnish acting student Lissa Manner Koski, 21, a resident of the
hostel, said she had been looking forward to watching the movie stars
arrive from the office window. Now, she said, she'll just have to
watch it on TV.</TE>
<TE>   "My business sense recognizes the Oscars are good for Hollywood,
good for movies, good for the whole industry," said Ted Nelson, owner
of Hollywood Plaques and a wholesaler of trophies and awards to about
50 businesses on Hollywood Boulevard. But for the local shopkeepers,
moving the awards to Hollywood "won't make a bit of difference," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   During winter, shopkeepers usually see a 30% drop from their
summer peak. This year, however, they're down 70% due to tourist
fallout after Sept. 11, Nelson said. Surviving on the sales of
T-shirts, postcards, ashtrays and shot glasses--anything, in short,
with the word "Hollywood" on it--the souvenir shops that have stayed
afloat are those nearest the Chinese Theater, Nelson said.</TE>
<TE>   The businesses to benefit the most will probably be the nearby
hotels hosting post-Oscar parties, said Hollywood Chamber of Commerce
President Leron Gubler. "With the huge reporter pool, all the
restaurants should definitely benefit as well," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Already, the fact that the Oscars would be held in the Hollywood &amp;
Highland complex has bestowed "instant credibility" on the giant
building, he said. Despite the project's financial problems (the
developer recently reduced the value by $217 million), Gubler said,
"Seeing Hollywood on the worldwide screen will help us with our
revitalization.... You have to look at the big picture."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Every year, as the Academy Award nominations are announced in the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science's Samuel Goldwyn Theater,
gasps are heard among the cell-phone-toting publicists and scribes.
It's the sound of dashed expectations and unexpected anointments.
Here are some of this year's biggest Oscar nomination surprises.</LD>
<LD>   1. "Moulin Rouge"--Apparently, movies direct themselves. The film
earned eight nominations, including best picture, but writer-director
Baz Luhrmann was ignored. Also, the first live-action musical
nominated in two decades was shut out in all musical categories.</LD>
<LD>   2. Who produced this movie anyway?--Three films--"Monsters, Inc.,"
"Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius "and "The Lord of the Rings: The
Fellowship of the Ring"--list their producers as "nominee to be
determined." The academy permits only three nominees per best picture
nod, and the nominees must have the official title of producer.
According to the academy, the three films did not comform to the
standards.</LD>
<TE>   3. Ethan Hawke--The baby-faced slacker actor-author-director
hasn't been on anybody's short list as the greatest actor of his
generation, but playing a rookie cop opposite powerhouse Denzel
Washington in "Training Day" has elevated his game.</TE>
<TE>   4. "Memento"--Although this Chinese puzzle murder-mystery was
based on a short story, it was not nominated for a screenplay based
on material previously published, but for best screenplay written
directly for the screen. Why? The key word is "previously." "Memento"
premiered in France a week before the original short story was
published in Esquire.</TE>
<TE>   5. Foreign language film--This category boasted two films that
haven't yet premiered in the U.S.--"Elling" and "Son of the Bride."
Perhaps it's not that surprising, except when one considers three
better known films--already in release--that were left off the list:
"The Son's Room," "Italian for Beginners" and "Behind the Sun." Also,
Miramax's profuse spending on "Amelie" appears to have paid off,
helping the film earn five nominations.</TE>
<TE>   6. Documentary--For the last decade, Holocaust-themed
documentaries have dominated this category and won the award in 2000,
1998, 1997 and 1995. This year, no Holocaust-themed documentary was
nominated, although there were kudos for documentaries on Romanian
street children and war photographer James Nachtwey.</TE>

<CX>   Also, a story in Wednesday's Calendar about the year's biggest
Oscar nomination surprises stated that "Moulin Rouge" was "shut out" of
the musical categories. In fact, the film is not eligible in the original
song or original score categories because neither a song nor "Moulin
Rouge's" score was initially created for the film.</CX>

<HD>Gripping Look at Huey Newton</HD>

<AU>MARK SACHS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was nearly 13 years ago on an Oakland street that activist Huey
Newton's turbulent life met with a violent end that shocked few, shot
down by a 24-year-old drug dealer.</LD>
<LD>   Newton, who in 1966 co-founded the Black Panther Party with Bobby
Seale, was only 47, but in truth had been in decline for several
years, beaten down by ongoing legal skirmishes and an equally
daunting array of vices.</LD>
<LD>   Tonight at 9 on KCET, however, the radical icon is resurrected
with a vengeance in "A Huey P. Newton Story," Spike Lee's mesmerizing
filmed adaptation of the Obie Award-winning one-man play starring
Roger Guenveur Smith.</LD>
<TE>   Smith's take on Newton is a blues-riffing fever dream of a
performance, jumping topics and even eras without batting an eye. "I
like to fight, to bite people's ears off," he explains. "I like to
choke my coach." His monologue careens forward, backs up and then
runs over words and phrases again and again, to riveting effect.</TE>
<TE>   The anger and frustration toward racial injustice that fuels
Newton's tears and tirades are framed beautifully by director Lee.
The long-running play, which made a well-reviewed stop in Los Angeles
last February, fleshed out the stark staging with the use of period
music and audio news clips. But Lee opens it up a bit further, adding
photos, vintage TV-news footage and moody solos from musician
Branford Marsalis to supplement Marc Anthony Thompson's Obie-winning
score. Lee and his top-notch production staff employ camera wizardry
and lighting techniques to evocative effect, yet manage to never take
away from Smith's performance.</TE>
<TE>   An odd note is the relatively lifeless audience that was on hand
in New York for the taping. While Smith is pulling out all the stops
onstage, burning through a pack of cigarettes in the process, the
crowd response is muted at best. Evidently, not everyone was ready
for Huey's return.</TE>

<LD>The gold-medal performances didn't stop at the Winter Olympics for
NBC last week, although the highest-rated opening ceremony on record
helped feather the Peacock Network's ratings nest, based on viewing
estimates issued Tuesday by Nielsen Media Research.</LD>
<LD>   Viewing of the Olympics remained strong through the weekend--and
ahead of the Winter Games in Nagano, Japan--without approaching the
lofty levels attained for Friday's opening event. With only three
days of Olympics coverage in its weekly average, NBC's audience
soared 90% compared with the corresponding week last year and
exceeded tune-in for any two rivals combined. The network has also
passed CBS in average overall prime-time viewing for the season.</LD>
<LD>   "Friends," meanwhile, whose cast signed lucrative deals for a
ninth season earlier this week, continued its sterling year with a
dominant performance for a new episode, followed by the highest
rating for a rerun (an episode featuring Brad Pitt) since an
installment of "Seinfeld" in 1998. That double dose of "Friends" also
funneled viewers into "Will &amp; Grace," which, with a guest appearance
by Matt Damon, drew its largest audience ever.</LD>
<TE>   Fox's "Ally McBeal" also showed some signs of renewed life,
delivering its highest rating in nine months.</TE>

<HD>Bidders Promise to Remedy the Problems at Belmont</HD>
<DH>Schools: Both firms competing to finish building the campus
would seal off gases and install elaborate safeguards. Board is
cautiously optimistic.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Two competing proposals to finish the Belmont Learning Complex under
a contract worth as much as $88 million both would seal off hazardous
underground vapors from a former oil field and install an elaborate
system of vents, air scrubbers and detectors, according to
presentations made Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Details of the two plans were made public at a board meeting of
the Los Angeles Unified School District, which is expected to choose
a contractor next month.</LD>
<LD>   The mood at the meeting was one of cautious optimism as some board
members appeared to embrace school Supt. Roy Romer's contention that
the long-delayed project could be completed within three years.</LD>
<TE>   The board halted construction in 1999, midway into the project,
because of environmental problems, particularly the underground gases
emanating from the former oil field on which part of the school sits.</TE>
<TE>   Romer said Tuesday that either of the two plans would ensure
safety at the high school.</TE>
<TE>   "When we have our next seismic disturbance, everybody should run
[to the Belmont school] and get in the middle of this site," Romer
said. "It will be the safest place in Los Angeles to protect yourself
from gases in the ground."</TE>
<TE>   The school, which would serve as many as 4,600 students, is more
than 60% complete and has already cost the district $154 million. A
panel of experts hired by the district estimated that it will cost an
additional $68 million to $88 million to complete the school and
insure the property for 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   At Tuesday's meeting, that panel did not recommend either of the
bidders but stressed that both plans meet the technical and financial
requirements. The two bidders will be compared in more detail over
the next month.</TE>
<TE>   In the school district's original request for bids, firms were
asked to cover underground trouble spots with tarp-like membranes to
block pollution.</TE>
<TE>   But Thierry Sanglerat, an executive at an environmental mitigation
firm and a member of the Belmont review panel, said the winning
contractor should construct the membrane and ventilation system under
the entire 34 acres as a precautionary measure.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever gases remained would be odorless and harmless, Sanglerat
said.</TE>
<TE>   The panel of experts also recommended that the district monitor
gases at a much finer level than required by law--at least 100 times
the standard mandated by the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration. The estimated cost of the environmental safeguards
would be $10 million to $15 million and still meet the overall budget
to complete the campus and insure the district against liability.</TE>
<TE>   Sanglerat noted that similar membrane and ventilation systems are
in place beneath other Southern California buildings, including Hoag
Memorial Hospital in Newport Beach and Cal Poly Pomona. There have
been no problems there, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Romer eliminated a third finalist in the bidding for the project
last week because of a possible conflict of interest. Eastridge Cos.
was dropped because one of its executives was involved in other real
estate consulting work for the school district.</TE>
<TE>   The two remaining bidders are the Alliance for a Better Community
and Komex H20.</TE>
<TE>   One issue the bidders failed to resolve was how to insure the site
for environmental safety for the 70 years the district originally
requested .</TE>
<TE>   Review panel member David Dybdahl of American Risk Management
Resources Network said both bidders suggested getting about 30 years
of insurance coverage for about $7 million. The two firms said that
there is no market for policies of 70 years.</TE>
<TE>   Romer said that 30 years' coverage and the environmental
safeguards make him confident that the district will be well
protected against any accidents.</TE>

<HD>Union Courts LAPD Officers</HD>
<DH>Labor: The Teamsters launch a bid to replace the Police
Protective League as bargaining unit for 8,900 employees. An
incumbent official calls it an illicit raid.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY CLEELAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Teamsters officials and several Los Angeles Police Department
officers Tuesday launched a labor union organizing campaign that
throws another wild card into the political intrigue surrounding the
LAPD.</LD>
<LD>   The union, one of the largest in the country, is seeking to
represent the department's 8,900 officers. They first would have to
decertify the Police Protective League, which has represented LAPD
officers for 75 years.</LD>
<LD>   At a news conference outside the Police Academy in Elysian Park, a
pro-Teamsters police officer said he and others are unhappy with
recent contracts negotiated by the league and with the level of
communication between league officials and members.</LD>
<TE>   The officer, Sgt. Craig Lally, said he agrees with the league's
efforts to oust Chief Bernard C. Parks, who is seeking a second
five-year term, as do about 200 others who openly back the Teamsters.</TE>
<TE>   Several local union officials had speculated that the Teamsters
would draw from Parks' supporters in the ranks, and a Teamsters
official said Monday that the drive was "about the chief and about
representation."</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, however, that official, James Santangelo, president of
Joint Council 42, distanced himself from the controversy about Parks,
saying, "We don't have a dog in that fight."</TE>
<TE>   Lally, an assistant watch commander in the West Los Angeles
Division, said he approached the Teamsters nearly a year ago, soon
after the league negotiated a three-year contract that gave officers
a 16% raise but eliminated legal representation during internal
department investigations.</TE>
<TE>   Lally also said the department's disciplinary procedures are too
hard on officers.</TE>
<TE>   Lally was one of 44 "problem officers" named in the 1991
Christopher Commission report, which addressed allegations of
excessive force in the department.</TE>
<TE>   The list named officers who had drawn six or more complaints
regarding force or tactics from 1986 through 1990.</TE>
<TE>   None of the complaints against Lally were upheld, and other
officers have cited his case as evidence that the list was arbitrary
and unfair.</TE>
<TE>   Lally and other Teamsters supporters are now distributing blue
pledge cards to officers to sign, stating that they no longer want to
be represented by the league.</TE>
<TE>   A return of about 3,000 cards will trigger an election between the
Teamsters and the league, according to a union attorney.</TE>
<TE>   However, the Teamsters could be blocked by an internal AFL-CIO
procedure intended to prevent unions from raiding one another's
members.</TE>
<TE>   Mitzi Grasso, league president, said the group is protected from
such a raid because it recently joined the AFL-CIO, a federation of
66 national unions. The AFL-CIO has rules against member unions
raiding other member unions.</TE>
<TE>   But Santangelo and a Teamsters attorney said the league did not
properly join the federation, and so is not protected. Santangelo
said he lobbied AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney to reject efforts
by the league to secure protection.</TE>
<TE>   With 1.4 million members, the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters is one of the federation's largest unions.</TE>
<TE>   The Teamsters represents law enforcement officers in nearly 300
organizations, none as large as the Los Angeles force, Santangelo
said.</TE>
<TE>   Several police officers passing the news conference expressed
reservations about joining a union that has a history of criminal
ties and is operating under a federal consent decree that regulates
internal elections and until recently tracked union finances.</TE>
<TE>   To that, Santangelo noted that the LAPD is also under a federal
consent decree that requires stronger oversight of problem officers.</TE>
<TE>   "There are bad politicians, there are bad cops, there are bad
businessmen," he said. "If there are bad Teamsters in the
organization, they don't last long. The bottom line is, we care about
working men and women and their families."</TE>

<LD>Laura Bush was in town this week doing the first lady thing, which
means sandpapering any splintery edges of the administration du jour,
and varnishing it with some home truths of her own.</LD>
<LD>   First ladies, like Miss Americas, choose themes, and Laura Bush,
the former teacher and librarian, is pedal-to-the-metal for teachers
and teaching, for books and literacy.</LD>
<LD>   When she hunkers down with schoolkids, as she did in North
Hollywood, it is the real thing. When Nancy Reagan did it, you got
the sense that the kids were dress extras, there for only as long as
the script called for them to be there.</LD>
<TE>   On Monday, Laura Bush got top billing--above Britney Spears--on
Jay Leno's show. She gave him the supposed attack pretzel and
creditably delivered a quip about "safe snacks."</TE>
<TE>   The Olympics have altered the Leno format, yet he didn't ask Laura
Bush what I did the next day, which is whether she ever wanted to be
in the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   When she answered "Yeah, right," in the sardonic West Texas tones
of a girl who would choose Dostoevsky over ice skates any day, I
figured we were off to a good start.</TE>
<TE>   Now, I've met a few first ladies, and my idiosyncratic criterion
for judging them has nothing to do with her causes, or her husband's
causes, or her Mater Dolorosa role as mother to the nation.</TE>
<TE>   My rule is this: Is she good girlfriend material? How would she
hold up on a shopping trip? A slumber party with wine and Twinkies? A
long, late weepy confessional dinner?</TE>
<TE>   Example: Betty Ford-- definite girlfriend material. She could talk
about anything, and did, from breast cancer to premarital sex.
Rosalynn Carter--there's always one girl who brings dental floss to a
slumber party, and I suspect Rosalynn is one of them. Barbara
Bush--too bossy. Nancy Reagan--just too-too. I'll get to Hillary
Clinton presently.</TE>
<TE>   I had 15 minutes with Laura B. Anyone is hard to size up in 15
minutes. Give me three hours, or just make me holler from behind the
ropes. "Mrs. Bush"--(Barbara)--"are those real pearls?" "Mrs. Reagan,
what did your horoscope say today?"</TE>
<TE>   Laura Bush's speech at Town Hall here Tuesday rounded the bases of
a revived national spirit, volunteers and teachers, and most
particularly children's reading and education.</TE>
<TE>   Then, bolder than her husband in the White House press room, she
took questions. One woman asked about TV morality, and Mrs. B got a
laugh. Her daughters watched "that very popular California show
'90210'" and while it was on, "I would walk through the room and say,
'These are not our values.'"</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Mrs. B took a rotation of quarter-hour interviews, her
voice raspy with Beltway winter overlaid with Santa Ana wind scratch.</TE>
<TE>   Did you meet Leno's wife, Mavis, champion of Afghan women when
most Americans still thought an Afghan was grandma's blanket? "I
never have talked to her," though Mavis gave her husband a note for
Mrs. B. "He's very proud of her, and he should be. I mean, all
Americans really should be proud of her, she's talked about it so
long and the great news is we actually get to see it change" in
March, when Afghan girls go to school--some for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   So what books influenced you? "I have a huge list," starting with
'Little Women,' the first book she remembers her mother reading to
her. And then "I would say certainly 'The Brothers Karamazov' has
been very influential. I just have read a whole lot of Russian novels
at various times ... all one summer when I was a schoolteacher in
Houston, I read 'em around the swimming pool, so even though they're
set in very cold Russia, they have this sort of bio-humidity about
them that I remember."</TE>
<TE>   You've praised Mark Twain, but some people want to ban Twain and
books like "Catcher in the Rye" from libraries, even "The Hobbit."
"Well, I certainly don't think any of those books should be banned
from libraries. I understand why people feel slightly uncomfortable
with Mark Twain, because that was his point--he was making Americans
really uncomfortable" about their moral dilemmas.</TE>
<TE>   What about your mother taking a small bath on Enron stock?
"Fortunately for my mother she's a very small investor.... Who we
need to think about are people who had their entire life savings, the
former employees, and didn't have any information beforehand so they
could've diversified themselves. That's the really, really sad part."</TE>
<TE>   So, on the Patt Standard: Hillary, whom I covered for about a week
in 1992? Good girlfriend material, just so long as she doesn't think
her husband will make a pass at you.</TE>
<TE>   Laura Bush? Possible girlfriend material, just so long as she
doesn't think you'll make fun of her husband.</TE>

<HD>Don't Let Iraq Dictate Anti-Terrorism Policy</HD>

<LD>Even if the inclusion of Iran in the "axis of evil" were a function
of U.S. policy on Iraq, it is still highly risky. It is likely to
increase Iran's determination to acquire nuclear weapons without
changing its policy on terrorism. Moreover, in lumping terrorism with
the spread of weapons of mass destruction, we may be working in
opposite directions: One task requires the significant cooperation of
states, the other targets them. We need differentiated policies.</LD>
<LD>   If there is any logic to Iran's inclusion on the list with Iraq
and North Korea, it is derived from a possible war on Iraq.
Historically, the United States sought to maintain balance in the
Persian Gulf between Iraq and Iran, not allowing either one to
dominate. During the Cold War, the U.S. supported Iran while the
Soviets supported Iraq. During the Iran-Iraq War, our policy was to
ensure that neither side won decisively.</LD>
<LD>   After the Gulf War in 1991, the U.S. embarked on the "dual
containment" of Iran and Iraq, largely because we worried that the
weakening of Iraq and the imposition of sanctions on it could give
Iran an opportunity to assert its power in the region. Now, with a
potential war on Iraq, which at minimum would significantly weaken it
and at maximum lead to its disintegration, the ground also is laid
for weakening Iran.</LD>
<TE>   This, Bush administration officials probably hope, also would
alleviate the fears of some allies in the Gulf who have always seen
Iran as a threat and worried that a diminished Iraq would increase
that threat.</TE>
<TE>   It seems then that Hussein, not the fear of terrorism and the
spread of weapons of mass destruction, is dictating U.S. policy.
Indeed, many states that have policy differences with the U.S. may
now increase their drive to procure nuclear weapons as the only way
to deter American power. Countering this drive through military means
alone probably would increase states' sponsorship of terrorism: If
they are to be targets anyway, their easiest method of response is
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   We are capable of destroying many enemies, including Iran, Iraq,
North Korea and more, but we do not have the resources to bring
stability or the desired outcome in every region after such wars. And
instability is where terrorism thrives.</TE>
<TE>   Ugly as some states are, they remain the natural enemies of
terrorism by fanatic groups. Weakening and destabilizing these states
will not decrease terror. It is easier to deter states than to deter
shadowy nonstate groups.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has been the target of a single horrific enemy that has
viciously attacked us and declared war on us: Al Qaeda. Imagine if
the anger of many groups and states becomes directed at us. The
recent anti-American demonstrations in Iran are an unfortunate
reminder. The horror of last September demonstrated how easy it is to
commit large-scale terror in the age of globalization.</TE>
<TE>   Osama bin Laden's horrible message to potential terrorists was not
so much a call to join his group but to demonstrate the vulnerability
of even the largest power on Earth to the acts of a few men with box
cutters. In this he succeeded, even as we have fortunately destroyed
much of his power. The danger that remains is too great to allow
ourselves to be blindsided by our obsession with Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   We are a powerful country and we must use that power to defend our
interests against those who threaten us. But we do not need more
desperate enemies.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the world, which saw our vulnerability in the September
tragedy as a threat to the global order, was buoyed by the recovery
of American power after the Afghan success. Now is the time for
prudence, not for turning global empathy and admiration into
pervasive anger.</TE>

<LD>Jim Spencer, a two-time Gold Glove winner who was a first-round draft
pick for the Angels and the 11th overall selection in baseball's
first amateur draft in 1965, died Sunday of an apparent heart attack.
He was 54.</LD>
<LD>   Spencer, whose winter home was in Sarasota, Fla., died in Ft.
Lauderdale. He had played in a charity baseball game Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Spencer made it to the major leagues in 1969 and spent four years
with the Angels, fulfilling a dream he had fostered since he was 3.</LD>
<TE>   "I decided then that my life's work would be baseball," he told
The Times in 1970. "And after that, it was all I thought about for
every moment of every day."</TE>
<TE>   His goal led to a mild form of insomnia when he was 11, leaving
him tossing and turning at night as he worried about making the big
leagues.</TE>
<TE>   "When you live your life with one goal, then that is the way it
is," he said at age 22.</TE>
<TE>   Spencer also played for the Texas Rangers, Chicago White Sox and
Oakland A's during his 15-year career.</TE>
<TE>   The left-hander had a career batting average of .250 and hit 146
home runs, though he was best known for his defensive prowess,
snaring Gold Glove awards in 1970 and 1977.</TE>
<TE>   After being traded to the Rangers in 1973, Spencer played in his
only All-Star game, replacing injured Boston Red Sox legend Carl
Yastrzemski for the American League team.</TE>
<TE>   His manager at the time, Whitey Herzog, informed him as he was
dressing for a game.</TE>
<TE>   "You're kidding," Spencer gasped, before realizing Herzog wasn't.</TE>
<TE>   "It just goes to show that you should never give up on yourself,"
Spencer said later that year.</TE>
<TE>   He remained active in the sport after retiring, serving as a scout
for the Yankees and as an assistant coach for the U.S. Naval Academy.</TE>
<TE>   Spencer also worked in promotions for the Yankees and took part in
charity events, including the appearance Saturday at a children's
hospital benefit game in Hollywood, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Spencer, who also had a home in Sykesville, Md., is survived by
his wife, Susie; daughters, Jessica and Jaime; parents, Lloyd and
Helen Spencer; and sister, Debbie DuVall of North Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   Funeral services are pending.</TE>

<HD>Frank Crosetti, 91; Yankee Player, Third-Base Coach</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Frank Crosetti, one of the last links to the great New York Yankee
baseball teams of the 1930s and early '40s, has died. He was 91.</LD>
<LD>   Crosetti, who played with the Yankees from 1932 to 1948 and was
the team's third-base coach for the next 20 years, died Monday night
in Stockton of complications from a fall in early January, said Norma
Crosetti, his wife of 63 years.</LD>
<LD>   Nicknamed ''the Crow,'' Crosetti played for eight teams that won
World Series titles and was teammates with Yankee legends such as
Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig and Joe DiMaggio.</LD>
<TE>   The 5-foot, 10-inch Crosetti batted .245, hit 98 home runs and
drove in 649 runs in 1,682 games in 17 seasons. He was an All-Star in
1936 and 1939, but his best season might have been 1938, when his 757
plate appearances set a major league record for a 154-game season. He
also led the American League with 27 stolen bases. He was the team's
starting shortstop from 1932 through 1940, when Phil Rizzuto replaced
him.</TE>
<TE>   After retiring as a player, Crosetti coached Yankee greats such as
Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris on teams that took part in 15 World
Series.</TE>
<TE>   ''I couldn't rank Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, Mantle,
Maris and other great Yankee hitters,'' Crosetti told The Times in
1961. ''They played at different times, had different styles...." He
said he had ''been asked to pick the best Yankee teams since I came
up in 1932, but that can't be done either.''</TE>
<TE>   Born Oct. 4, 1910, in San Francisco, Frank Peter Joseph Crosetti
spent many of his formative years in Los Gatos near San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   His father raised vegetables on a 12-acre plot, while Crosetti and
his brother spent their free time playing one-a-cat, a baseball-style
game.</TE>
<TE>   ''We used the big end of the corncob as a ball,'' he said. ''We
had a bunch of corncobs and when they dried they'd get hard, and we'd
chop the big end off. For a bat, we'd get a board and whittle it down
on one end to make a handle.''</TE>
<TE>   Crosetti's family moved to the North Beach area of San Francisco
when he was in high school, but Crosetti was not a good student. He
once skipped classes at Lowell High for two consecutive weeks and
spent most of those days watching ballgames played by the San
Francisco Seals of the Pacific Coast League.</TE>
<TE>   After dropping out of high school at the age of 16, Crosetti
worked at a produce market before a friend asked if he was interested
in going to Butte, Mont., to play semipro baseball. The two worked
for a Montana power company by day and played baseball at night
through the summer, then returned to San Francisco, where Crosetti
played in several games a day at various parks in the region.</TE>
<TE>   The Seals signed Crosetti in 1928 and he played three seasons for
the team before joining the Yankees, a club that featured San
Francisco native and future Hall of Famer Tony Lazzeri at second
base.</TE>
<TE>   DiMaggio, who was also from San Francisco and played for the
Seals, had his contract purchased by the Yankees in 1935.</TE>
<TE>   The three players, all of whom were of Italian origin and none of
whom were particularly loquacious, forged a friendship that began
when a team executive instructed Lazzeri and Crosetti to drive
DiMaggio down to spring training in St. Petersburg, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   ''Tony didn't talk much and DiMag didn't say a word. He just sat
in the backseat and looked out the window,'' Crosetti told Newsday in
1991. ''Tony and I shared the driving. We would go two or three hours
and then look at the other guy and say, 'Wanna drive?' and then we'd
shift places. Sometimes that was all the conversation in the car.</TE>
<TE>   ''Finally, on about the third day, I said to Tony: 'Let's let the
kid drive.' So he turned to him in the backseat and said, 'Wanna
drive, kid?' And DiMag said, 'I don't know how.' I don't know if he
was pulling our legs or not.''</TE>
<TE>   After Crosetti retired as a player, he became a fixture in the
third-base coaching box. He once was reportedly about to succeed the
legendary Casey Stengel as manager of the Yankees, but denied the
story.</TE>
<TE>   ''I wouldn't manage a ballclub for any amount of money," he said.
"I have the best job in baseball right here and my only ambition is
to remain as third-base coach of the Yankees. Anyone who says
different is nuts.''</TE>
<TE>   Crosetti did coach with the expansion Seattle Pilots in 1969, but
was released after one season when manager Joe Schultz was fired.</TE>
<TE>   In retirement, Crosetti was a frequent visitor to the Yankee
clubhouse when the team made trips to Oakland. Last May, during one
of his visits, he told a New York Daily News reporter that Babe
Ruth's legendary "called shot" home run against the Chicago Cubs in
the 1932 World Series never happened. Legend has it that Ruth pointed
to the outfield fence before he hit the homer.</TE>
<TE>   ''I've been asked this a million times and he did not point,''
Crosetti said.</TE>
<TE>   "The next day, it was all in the papers. He sat next to me in the
dugout and said, 'If the writers want to say I pointed, let 'em.'</TE>
<TE>   ''That was the tip-off, right there. What happened was, the Cubs
were getting on him and he had two strikes on him. So he put his
finger up in front of his face and what he meant was, 'I have one
strike left.'</TE>
<TE>   ''And then it happened that on the next pitch, he hit a home run.
But he didn't point.''</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his wife, Crosetti is survived by his son, John D.
Crosetti of San Diego; daughter, Ellen Biggs of Menlo Park; three
grandsons; and two great-grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Evelyn Scott, 86; 'Peyton Place' Actress, First Female DJ
on L.A. Radio Station</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Evelyn Scott, the tough-talking saloon keeper of the pioneering
prime-time television soap opera "Peyton Place," has died at 86.</LD>
<LD>   Scott, who began her career as Los Angeles' first female disc
jockey on radio station KMPC, died of undisclosed causes Jan. 31 at
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. The actress became a regular on "Peyton
Place," which was based on a Grace Metalious novel and 1957 movie of
the same title.</LD>
<LD>   Considered scandalous for its time, the show depicted the
extramarital affairs, dark secrets and skulduggery of residents of a
small New England town called Peyton Place.</LD>
<TE>   Scott played Ada Jacks on the original TV series from 1965 to
1969, reprised the role on "Return to Peyton Place" from 1972 to 1974
and did it again for the 1985 TV movie "Peyton Place: The Next
Generation."</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the 1960s series, Scott told The Times that the
friendships she made among the vast cast were the most important
thing about her five-year run.</TE>
<TE>   "They last more than anything else," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Scott still felt the same way a few decades later when she
rejoined a handful of original cast members and a lot of newcomers to
shoot "The Next Generation" in Waxahachie, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   "The main reason I came back," the then-septuagenarian said in
1985, "is to see all my friends again. It's like a class reunion, yet
it still seems like the day before yesterday. None of us has lost our
touch."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Brockton, Mass., the blue-eyed, red-haired Scott came to
Los Angeles for a career in show business.</TE>
<TE>   She started out as a disc jockey, the area's first woman in that
role, spinning records for KMPC's early morning "Wake-Up" show and
then became a singing DJ on KHJ's similar "Rise and Shine" morning
program.</TE>
<TE>   Scott began acting in local companies, including the Stage
Society, West Coast Theater, Civic Playhouse and Pasadena Playhouse.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1950s, she had small roles in a handful of motion pictures,
including "Wicked Woman," "The Green-Eyed Blonde" and "I Want to
Live!" starring Susan Hayward.</TE>
<TE>   Scott also appeared in episodes of such popular TV series as
"Bonanza," "Gunsmoke" and "Perry Mason."</TE>
<TE>   In her private life, Scott was involved for many years as a board
member of Portals House Inc., a center to aid mentally troubled
people.</TE>
<TE>   She also was a fund-raiser and major supporter of OPICA Adult Day
Care, which aids senior citizens, and regularly recruited friends to
help serve dinner to the homeless at Skid Row centers.</TE>
<TE>   Formerly married to blacklisted writer Gene Stone, Scott married
importer Urban S. Hirsch Jr. in 1961. She is survived by Hirsch and
three stepchildren, Urban III, Rita and Karen.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service is planned Feb. 23.</TE>

<HD>New Role for Onetime Pariah</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Six months ago, Pakistan was a pariah nation, creator of the Taliban
regime in next-door Afghanistan and home to Islamic extremists. Today
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf visits the White House as the
leader of a country moving back toward the international mainstream
and preaching moderate Islam. That course will require help and a
long-term commitment from the United States.</LD>
<LD>   Washington already has pledged nearly $1 billion to assist
Pakistan, and a  U.S.-led consortium of nations has let Pakistan
delay repayment of billions of dollars more in loans.</LD>
<LD>   Pakistan has many uses for that money, but a prime one should be
establishing public schools and opening the classrooms to girls.
Public schools provide an alternative to  religious classes that
teach a perverted  interpretation of the Koran and hatred of the
West.</LD>
<TE>   Military assistance also can help. That does not mean providing
whatever weapons the nation wants and fueling an arms race with
India, Pakistan's hostile neighbor. But it should include resuming
the training of Pakistani soldiers in the United States and perhaps
joint exercises between the two countries. Pakistan is providing
bases for U.S. troops and aircraft to attack Afghanistan, a
courageous move by Musharref, given pro-Taliban sentiment within the
country.</TE>
<TE>   Washington should work with Pakistan and India, both nuclear-armed
countries, to ease the threat of war between the two. That should
involve quiet diplomacy rather than formal, public mediation.
President Bush would do well to tell Musharraf, a general who seized
power in a coup in 1999, that his army cannot continue to let
guerrillas cross into Indian-controlled Kashmir, the main source of
tension between the neighbors. India should remove some of its troops
from the  border in Kashmir and move toward meaningful talks with
residents of the disputed state.</TE>
<TE>   For decades Washington and Islamabad had close ties that included
substantial U.S. economic and military assistance and U.S. bases in
Pakistan. The bond grew stronger during the joint fight against the
1979-1989 Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. But then Washington's
attention turned elsewhere and Pakistan became a haven for
terrorists. Pakistanis question whether the United States will remain
steadfast this time.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, who has often praised Musharraf for casting his lot with
Washington after the September terror attacks, should say it again
and say it loud: The United States' relationship with Pakistan is for
the long run.</TE>

<LD>Angelenos probably don't spend a lot of time thinking about the Port
of Los Angeles unless they work there or live next door. Many are
surprised to learn how much this hidden giant adds to the region's
and the nation's economy: $220 billion in computers, toys, furniture
and other goods pass through the Los Angeles and Long Beach port
complex each year. It's the biggest port in the country, topping even
New York.</LD>
<LD>   But as staff writer Gary Polakovic made clear in a story in
Sunday's Times, trade and jobs are not the port's only influence on
Southern California's quality of life. The complex is also the
region's worst air polluter. The giant container ships that visit
during a typical day release more smog-forming gases than 1 million
cars, more than twice as much as all the power plants in the Los
Angeles Basin. Never mind the strides California has made in making
cars and energy plants run cleanly. If shipping remains unregulated,
it will soon account for two-thirds of the county's smog-forming
gases.</LD>
<TE>   The port's economic and environmental effects on the region are,
not surprisingly, interlocked. The shipping industry's clout makes
regulating emissions a challenge for the multitude of local, state
and federal agencies responsible for overseeing the harbor and
enforcing air quality standards. Shippers say reforms cost too much.
And with the economy on hold, no official wants to risk imposing
regulations and losing business to other ports. But the long-term
costs to human health and the environment demand that someone rise to
meet the challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Sweden is pioneering economic incentives, charging reduced harbor
fees to ships that use cleaner oil and urging the European Union to
investigate the use of tradable emission permits. It is also pressing
to strengthen an international agreement on reducing ship emissions
since foreign-flagged ships--there or in Los Angeles--are not subject
to local regulations. The agreement was adopted in 1997, but too many
countries, including the United States, failed to ratify it.</TE>
<TE>   Those who live next to the port scrape black dust off their cars.
Others see a haze over their suburban valleys and inhale the
invisible particles of unburned diesel fuel. As more people become
aware that port pollution is hurting hard-fought efforts to clean the
air, they'll pressure lawmakers to do something about it. A policy of
"no net increase" in emissions pushed by Los Angeles Mayor (and
harbor-area resident) James K. Hahn is good but not enough. What's
urgently needed is a widespread commitment to start reducing the
pollution.</TE>

<LD>Today's the day for members of the House of Representatives to
demonstrate that they're ready to resist the tempting lucre of the
nation's Enrons, unions and rich influence buyers. At last it's their
chance to show that they can do more than smirk cynically at the
prospect of returning democracy to the people.</LD>
<LD>   The Shays-Meehan bill banning most so-called "soft money"
contributions to candidates offers the best hope in decades for
cleaning up the political system. Those in Congress who are sincere
about reform must make sure the bill isn't waylaid by critics with a
questionable grasp of the Constitution or stalled by supposed
supporters with weaselly excuses for waiting to implement change.</LD>
<LD>   Election after election has seen a steady rise in soft money
contributions, which are heaped into party coffers to be used with
few restrictions. In the 2000 election cycle the total came to $438
million. The organization Democracy 21 projects that unless
Shays-Meehan is enacted, soft money will exceed $750 million in 2004.
That's a lot of dough for average citizens to counter with e-mails,
phone calls and whatever's left in their checking accounts after they
pay their housing, grocery, tax and energy bills--all of which happen
to be affected by big-bucks lobbying.</LD>
<TE>   After each election, lawmakers piously demand change. But somehow
reform always fails. At least that's what happened before Enron's
collapse gave Americans a rare glimpse into the system. This, after
all, is a company that wiped out shareholders while showing great
generosity to executives and pols--trying to buy goodwill from almost
every congressional committee head, for example, and pumping more
money into the 2000 Bush campaign than any other corporate donor.</TE>
<TE>   House Majority Leader J. Dennis Hastert and other leading
Republicans claim that the real danger isn't corporate influence but
reform itself, and they are furiously throwing roadblocks into the
path of Shays-Meehan. A favorite tactic is to cram the bill with
"poison pill" amendments. One requires that if any part of the bill
is found unconstitutional by a court, the whole must be nullified.
Another approach is to distract legislators with alternative
legislation--specifically, the Ney-Wynn bill, which does not ban
raising soft money.</TE>
<TE>   Still, if 218 House members hold fast, Shays-Meehan will make it
to the Senate relatively intact. For that to happen, California
Republicans such as Elton Gallegly (Simi Valley) and Doug Ose
(Sacramento) must stay on board. Ose, a backer of reform in the past,
now says he is having doubts about Shays-Meehan. He claims it is
insufficiently rigorous. In fact, the bill's ban on soft money is
sweeping and comprehensive. It would, among other things, bar federal
officeholders and candidates from raising soft money and prohibit
such funds from being used by state parties on behalf of federal
candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps those wavering on reform would rather wait till the middle
of the decade, when the nation's profoundly corrupting soft money
contributions have doubled, amid more waste of time and energy by
leaders grubbing to get their share. Voters shouldn't be so patient.
They should insist that Congress pass Shays-Meehan immediately.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "The Company Presidency," Opinion, Feb. 10: Kevin Phillips'
attempt to tie President Bush to the Enron debacle would be funny
(and in some ways it is funny) were it not so dishonest.</LD>
<LD>   Left out of the article are a few key facts. Such as the fact that
Enron contributed hugely to just about every major politician in
America. Sen. Joe ("Holier Than Thou") Lieberman pocketed campaign
contributions from Enron. Ann Richards, whom George W. Bush defeated
in the race for the Texas governorship, also happily accepted Enron
money. Many other Democrats, including Sen. Hillary Clinton, gladly
cashed Enron checks. (After the company floundered last month, she
donated it to charity.) Enron executives were aboard the famous Ron
Brown (Commerce secretary in the Clinton administration) jet plane
trips, courtesy of hefty campaign contributions to Clinton.</LD>
<LD>   The hidden, and untrue, assumption buried in the Phillips article
is that because President Bush has consistently favored energy
deregulation (along with many other energy experts) and because Enron
nominally did the same, that this somehow constitutes a quid pro quo.
Phillips knows better.</LD>

<TE>   Kudos to Phillips. He raises the proposition as to which dynasty,
the Bush family or Enron, built the other. It's apparent that it was
a mutual enterprise. Phillips chronicles the deception, the lies, the
intrigue and the collaboration with the acuity of a surgeon's
scalpel.</TE>
<TE>   Enron execs plead the 5th, former Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey
Skilling "can't recall," Vice President Cheney refuses to comply with
the bipartisan General Accounting Office's request and an endless
list of Bush Cabinet members and appointees, ad nauseam, all point to
an administration mired in muck. Isn't it ironic that Teapot Dome was
also over "energy"?</TE>
<TE>   Thanks also to Patt Morrison for providing a little levity with
her verse, "Red Ink and Ken" (Opinion), to an otherwise obscene and
outrageous situation.</TE>

<TE>   Unlimited contributions from big corporations like Enron inflict
the most corrupting influence on our government. They undermine the
"one man, one vote" principle by tempting honest politicians to give
preference to their contributor's agenda.</TE>
<TE>   Executives use company cash to pad the pockets of politicians.
Enron's executives bought their way out of government oversight so
they could make billions at the expense of their shareholders,
employees, retirees and power customers. Other corporations and
unions do the same thing regularly. I'm mad as hell and I'm not going
to take it anymore!</TE>
<TE>   Congress has a chance to end this abuse by passing the
Shays-Meehan law. No more backpedaling. Now is the time for our
representatives to stand up and represent us, the voters.</TE>

any knowledge of wrongdoing, but got rich. The people who stayed lost
their jobs and their life savings. Who should we be looking for?

<LD>Re "Put a Psychiatrist in His Corner," Commentary, Feb. 11: Dr. Alen
J. Salerian certainly has a grasp of the conventional wisdom
concerning Mike Tyson but misses the mark: Tyson is crazy, but crazy
like a fox.</LD>
<LD>   In this, the twilight of his career, Tyson wants two things: the
preservation of his existing ring legacy and the continuing ability
to sign for easy paydays (e.g., fighting Brian Nielsen in Denmark).
By ducking Lennox Lewis yet again, this time through his recent,
headline-grabbing antics, he can continue to achieve both.</LD>
<LD>   While Tyson is indeed a criminal, and particularly unstable when
he goes off his antidepressant medication when preparing for fights,
he remains a master of promotion and a savvy protector of his ring
legacy.</LD>

<TE>   Although I agree with Salerian's conclusion that Tyson needs his
head examined, I wish he could have used a better example than that
FDR "let Stalin steal Eastern Europe at Yalta." I'm surprised he
didn't spout the Republican mantra, "FDR sold us down the river"! Why
not call for a psychiatric examination for the current president and
all those who want to dump billions into a missile defense system?</TE>

<HD>Environmental Impact of Salt Lake Olympics</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In "Greenest Games Ever? Not!" (Opinion, Feb. 3), Martin Lee
pronounced a failing grade for the environmental efforts of the Salt
Lake Organizing Committee for the Olympic Winter Games. In 1994,
"environment" joined "sport" and "culture" as the third principle of
Olympism. As the first city to win the Games since, Salt Lake has
been joined by over 100 partner organizations in pursuit of three
major goals: zero waste, zero emissions and urban forestry advocacy.</LD>
<LD>   Through recycling and composting, the SLOC will recover between
90% to 95% of the solid waste produced at the Games. Recently
certified "climate neutral" by the Climate Neutral Network, the SLOC
has reduced the Games' air emissions to less than zero by quantifying
all emissions and then offsetting them through retirement of donated
emission-reduction credits. The SLOC's urban forestry programs have
seen 100,000 trees planted in Utah, plus over 18 million trees
worldwide. Our education programs leveraged the public's interest to
promote environmental stewardship.</LD>
<LD>   An environmental audit by [engineering and construction firm]
CH2MHill confirmed that the SLOC had achieved its goals, making the
Winter Games of 2002 "the greenest games ever," a testament to
environmentally responsible event management and a legacy for the
future.</LD>

<LD>Re "Crypts That Keep On Giving," Feb. 8: Your article gives me the
impression that somewhere along the way of its 2,000-year history the
Catholic Church has lost its spiritual way. The thought of selling
crypts under the new Los Angeles cathedral, with the price going up
as one gets closer to the altar, strikes me as very similar to the
practice of selling indulgences (to decrease time spent in purgatory)
in the 16th century, which was a factor in the tumultuous history of
those times that included numerous religious wars.</LD>
<LD>   And to justify the practice by comparing it to age-old cathedrals
in Europe where the powerful and the famous are buried fails to take
note of that time, when the rulers, the rich and the powerful were
thought to be closer to God. I think that we, as a society, have
grown a bit more sophisticated than that.</LD>
<LD>   A church should be a place that includes everyone and a place
where one can take a breath of "clean, spiritual fresh air." Somehow,
what the diocese wants to do doesn't seem to measure up to what the
church founders would have wanted. By the way, I was born and raised
a Catholic.</LD>

<HD>6 Members of Enron's Board Quit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Enron Corp. said Tuesday that six of its 14 directors are resigning
as the company attempts to restructure itself.</LD>
<LD>   The bankrupt energy trader also declared what many investors
already assumed: that its once-towering stock has been rendered
worthless, even though it still trades for about 34 cents a share.</LD>
<LD>   The directors' resignations come in the wake of blistering
criticism of Enron's board. An internal company report said the
board's lack of oversight and poor understanding of the company's
financial dealings contributed to Enron's collapse.</LD>
<TE>   The resignations, effective in 30 days, were announced in a filing
with the Securities and Exchange Commission after a board meeting at
the offices of the company's New York law firm. The document was
vaguely worded, and analysts said it's unclear whether the
resignations were voluntary or requested by Enron's creditors.</TE>
<TE>   Board members frequently resign during bankruptcy proceedings,
choosing to step down rather than be involved in the restructuring
process, experts said. "People don't want to be on the boards of
bankrupt companies," said Kenneth N. Klee, a bankruptcy expert at
UCLA law school. "They want to be on boards of profitable companies
with high prestige, where they don't have high legal exposure."</TE>
<TE>   But one source said portions of the Enron board meeting Tuesday
were heated, and that the final wording of the SEC filing was
carefully negotiated.</TE>
<TE>   Three of the six departing directors live overseas: Ronnie C.
Chan, 52, chairman of Hong Kong real estate firm Hang Lung Group;
Paulo V. Ferraz Pereira, 47, executive vice president of Brazil's
Grupo Bozano banking firm; and Lord John Wakeham, 69, former
secretary of state for energy in Britain.</TE>
<TE>   The other three directors who are leaving have been on the board
since 1985: John H. Duncan, 74, a private investor; Robert Jaedicke,
73, an accounting professor and former dean of Stanford University's
Graduate School of Business; and Charles A. LeMaistre, 78, former
head of the University of Texas' Anderson Cancer Center.</TE>
<TE>   Though the board for now will be composed of eight directors,
Enron said in its filing that it will "search aggressively" for a new
chairman and new board members.</TE>
<TE>   "Enron today is a very different company than before the
bankruptcy and it has different needs in its board of directors,"
said W. Neil Eggleston, a lawyer representing non-employee directors.</TE>
<TE>   Remaining board members are Robert A. Belfer, 66, former chairman
of Belco Oil &amp; Gas; Norman P. Blake Jr., 60, chairman of Comdisco
Inc.; Wendy Lee Gramm, 57, former chairman of the U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission; John Mendelsohn, current president of the
Anderson Cancer Center; William C. Powers, dean of the University of
Texas School of Law; Frank Savage, 63, head of Savage Holdings;
Raymond S. Troubh, a financial consultant; and Herbert S. Winokur
Jr., 58, head of financial firm Capricorn Holdings.</TE>
<TE>   Troubh was added to the board in November, shortly before Enron's
bankruptcy filing, to head a special litigation committee.</TE>
<TE>   Non-employee Enron directors each have been paid $50,000 in
service fees annually, plus $1,250 for each board meeting attended.
The directors were required to defer 50% of their base annual service
fee into an Enron stock plan.</TE>
<TE>   In its filing Tuesday, Enron also said it believes that "the
existing equity of the company has and will have no value," based on
the firm's estimates of assets and liabilities. Under the law, common
shareholders are last in line in a bankruptcy. They often lose their
entire stake.</TE>
<TE>   Enron's stock was delisted by the New York Stock Exchange in
January. It now trades in the so-called pink-sheet market. The
closing price Tuesday--before the company made its announcement--was
33.7 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   In other news Tuesday, the Labor Department said it will replace
the Enron officials in charge of the company's three retirement plans
with an independent monitor, whose salary will be paid by the
company. "The workers in these plans have suffered enough," said
Labor Secretary Elaine Chao.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement, which may be subject to approval by the bankruptcy
court, requires Enron to pay fees for three years, up to a maximum of
$1.5 million per year, plus expenses.</TE>

<HD>Lack of Credibility May Put Off International Bailout
Package</HD>
<DH>Argentina: A detailed economic recovery plan would help
rebuild confidence, experts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BUENOS AIRES</DL>
<LD>Amid the Argentine government's myriad problems, one stands out: its
lack of credibility at home and abroad. That may prove the biggest
obstacle to securing a desperately needed international assistance
package and starting down the road to economic recovery.</LD>
<LD>   After all the turmoil of the last two months--with five
presidents, a devaluation and a default on most of its $150 billion
in public debt--Argentina is still fighting the perception that it
isn't facing up to tough budgetary and political choices. Until it
does, chances of an International Monetary Fund bailout are slim to
none, experts say.</LD>
<LD>   The federal government has yet to sort out its tangled relations
with its provinces, which are free to spend more money than they
receive in transfers from the federal government. The government took
a positive step in allowing its peso to float freely this week--the
peso gained 10% on Tuesday, trading at 1.80 to the dollar--but has
yet to outline its monetary policy or put forth a credible federal
budget.</LD>
<TE>   Although the government is projecting an annual deficit of 3
billion pesos, economists say it will rise higher as early as this
month because of poor tax collections.</TE>
<TE>   And while the government maintains that inflation will be 15% in
2002, economist Michael Gavin of UBS Warburg says 25% is a
"conservative estimate."</TE>
<TE>   The banking system is a shambles, partly because depositors no
longer trust the government with their money. After years of promises
that dollar deposits would be respected, President Eduardo Duhalde
converted all accounts to devalued pesos last month. Depositors still
are denied their "property rights" of full access to their accounts.</TE>
<TE>   The government has made no public effort to outline how it might
resume payments on the public debt it stopped paying last month.
Until it does, a bailout is an impossibility, said Carina Lopez, an
analyst with Standard &amp; Poor's debt rating firm in Buenos Aires.</TE>
<TE>   Argentina's confidence problem is made even more acute because it
has fewer resources to help it out of its crisis in comparison with
Mexico and Brazil, which devalued their currencies in 1994 and 1999,
respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico was helped by booming trade with the United States. Brazil
benefited from a massive influx of foreign investment and the
credibility of central bank chief Arminio Fraga, a former associate
of financier George Soros. Argentina's central bank, on the other
hand, lost its autonomy last month when the legislature handed
jurisdiction to the executive branch.</TE>
<TE>   The prospect for a new spurt of foreign investment in Argentina is
practically nil, because companies that spent billions of dollars
over the last decade buying up privatized companies--including
utilities, energy concerns and banks--have been left holding the bag.
Duhalde decreed a freeze last month in energy and telephone rates in
devalued pesos, even though most of the companies are loaded with
debt in dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Caught in the bind are companies such as Metrogas, a Buenos Aires
gas distributor owned by a consortium including British Gas and
Repsol. The company must meet its dollar-denominated debt obligations
with a reduced revenue stream based on devalued pesos.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the company missed a $1.6-million payment on its debt,
although finance director Luis Domenech said Tuesday it was due not
to a lack of cash but to government restrictions on external payments
of dollars. "It's a problem," Domenech said of the new government
policies.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Argentina's economic panorama darkens by the day. In
what some economists call a "fiscal rebellion," many Argentines have
stopped paying taxes, another sign of popular distrust. January tax
collections were 20% less than the same month last year. Unemployment
could reach 30% this month--up from 21% in January--and industrial
output is off by more than 16% so far this year, says the  Fiel think
tank here.</TE>
<TE>   Demonstrations, often violent, continue daily, putting pressure on
President Duhalde, who inherited a crisis when he took office Jan. 2,
the fifth president in two weeks. On Tuesday, angry retirees broke
windows of banks in the affluent resort town of Mar de Plata,
complaining to television reporters they couldn't access their
accounts to pay living and medical expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Economy Minister Jorge Remes Lenicov visited the International
Monetary Fund and U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill on Tuesday
to open a dialogue in hopes of securing an assistance package
estimated in the local press here at between $15 billion and $25
billion.</TE>
<TE>   "We are conscious that Argentina has lost its credit and
credibility in the international financial system," said presidential
spokesman Eduardo Amadeo on the IMF steps in Washington. "We know it
will be a long negotiation," Amadeo told La Nacion newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, no one has any illusion that such a sum is forthcoming,
partly because Argentina still hasn't put together a credible
recovery plan. Its targeted budget deficit, for example, is
unrealistically small, given the deep drop in tax collections, said
Fabio Rodriguez, an economist with Fundacion Capital think tank.</TE>
<TE>   It's an important point because many fear that the government will
print money to make up for the shortfall, leading to a recurrence of
the hyperinflation that bedeviled the country in the 1980s. Economist
Abel Viglione of  Fiel sees a possible "Hurricane Mitch" of inflation
in coming months as the government loosens banking restrictions and
Argentines buy dollars at any cost, which would weaken the peso and
drive prices higher.</TE>
<TE>   With depositor and investor confidence waning, Argentina will see
a massive restructuring of its banking industry under any scenario,
including bank closures and mergers, according to S&amp;P economist
Gabriel Caracciolo.</TE>
<TE>   "All the functions that banks serve--mortgages, consumer and
retail loans and project financing--are gone. There are too many
banks for the structure of the economy in coming years," Caracciolo
said.</TE>
<TE>   Argentina's road to recovery will be slow and more difficult than
others in recent Latin American history, said Gustavo Canonero, head
of research at Deutsche Bank here.</TE>
<TE>   "Argentina's devaluation has forced the government to destroy
institutions, like the banking system and property rights. The
consequences are far reaching. Institutions take time to rebuild. So
does confidence," Canonero said.</TE>

<HD>Parts Firm Founder Enters Guilty Plea</HD>
<DH>Courts: Mission Viejo man admits to deceiving bank,
shareholders of Aviation Distributors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The founder of an Orange County aircraft parts supply firm pleaded
guilty to deceiving his bank and accountants and to defrauding
shareholders who bought nearly $7 million worth of his company's
stock, federal prosecutors said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Osamah S. Bakhit of Mission Viejo admitted devising a scam first
detected by Andersen, whose audits of Enron Corp. have come under
fire. Andersen quit as auditor of Bakhit's Aviation Distributors Inc.
in August 1997, citing falsified documents. Federal investigations,
shareholder lawsuits and Bakhit's resignation as chief executive soon
followed.</LD>
<LD>   Bakhit, 52, who remains the company's biggest shareholder, pleaded
guilty Monday to 18 counts of conspiracy, securities fraud,
falsifying business records and reports to regulators, evading
accounting controls and lying to his bankers and auditors. He is
scheduled for sentencing Aug. 19 in federal court in Santa Ana.</LD>
<TE>   Bakhit's lawyer, James R. Asperger, didn't return a phone call
seeking comment. Federal prosecutors declined to say what punishment
they will ask U.S. District Judge David O. Carter to impose.</TE>
<TE>   Aviation Distributors, which is based in Lake Forest, went public
at $5 a share in March 1997. The shares reached $12.87 five months
later on the Nasdaq SmallCap Market.</TE>
<TE>   The stock, which Nasdaq delisted in October 1997, closed Tuesday
at 17 cents a share, unchanged in the over-the-counter market.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors contend the company, which supplies new and overhauled
parts to airlines, would never have been able to sell stock without
falsifying its records. When Aviation Distributors was forced to
restate its 1996 financial statements in April 1998, a profit of
$300,000 became a loss of $1.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Working with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the FBI and
federal prosecutors found that Bakhit directed workers to provide
forged invoices and other false information to Far East National Bank
to gain access to bank credit lines, Assistant U.S. Atty. Shannon
Wright said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to trying to deceive Andersen, the company also gave
false information to a second accounting firm, Grant Thornton, after
Andersen quit, Wright said.</TE>
<TE>   Aviation Distributors and its director of quality assurance, James
Goulet, pleaded guilty previously to conspiracy and securities fraud.
The company was ordered to pay a $750,000 criminal fine. Goulet, 40,
of Lake Forest, will be sentenced later this year.</TE>

<HD>Microsoft Security Chief Has Work Cut Out for Him</HD>
<DH>Computing: Hiring of Scott Charney is seen as a critical,
and timely, move for the software firm.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES PILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates pledged in January to
transform the company's approach to security and privacy, the
software industry sensed a coming sea change.</LD>
<LD>   "Trustworthy computing is more important than any other part of
our work ... the highest priority" Gates wrote in a memo to Microsoft
employees Jan. 15.</LD>
<LD>   The details of Gates' strategy have been scant, but the company
took a major step forward Jan. 31 with the hiring of former
Department of Justice computer-crime head Scott Charney as chief
security strategist.</LD>
<TE>   Charney, 46, is a cybersecurity specialist at the accounting firm
PricewaterhouseCoopers, where he oversees anti-hacking systems and
conducts cybercrime investigations. He starts at Microsoft on April
1.</TE>
<TE>   Charney brings credentials as an aggressive prosecutor experienced
in the cross-border investigations that tend to follow today's
computer hacking episodes. Under his direction, the Justice
Department in 1994 sent to jail members of the Masters of Deception,
well-known hackers who had successfully obtained phone and credit
agency records.</TE>
<TE>   He will report to Craig Mundie, one of Microsoft's two chief
technical officers.</TE>
<TE>   Security experts say that to succeed, Charney must fundamentally
change the company's design process, which is widely viewed as sloppy
and error-prone. In scores of cases, the company has added features
to a product, waited for users to encounter inevitable security
holes, issued a software "patch" for the worst problems and ignored
the others.</TE>
<TE>   "The only way to change the culture is to put a barking dog at the
head ... who can instill fear," said Fred Hickey, editor of the
High-Tech Strategist, a financial newsletter.</TE>
<TE>   People often succeed at Microsoft "largely by dint of their
relationships or the ability to convince people that they are right,"
Mundie said. "To some extent, you can say [Charney's] power emanates
from me and Bill Gates."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Some Wonder Whether Focus Will Be on PR</TE>
<TE>   But as the outlines of Gates' "trustworthy computing" initiative
take shape, industry experts are skeptical about whether Microsoft is
prepared for the depth of change it implies.</TE>
<TE>   Charney will split his time between Washington, D.C., and
Microsoft's Redmond, Wash., headquarters. That arrangement, combined
with his lack of engineering experience, suggests to some analysts
that his focus will be tracking down hackers and lobbying lawmakers,
instead of dealing with software design problems inside the company.</TE>
<TE>   Charney may have been selected "because Microsoft needs good PR,"
said John Pescatore, a security analyst with Gartner Inc.</TE>
<TE>   But the way Microsoft introduced its new approach suggests it may
be more serious. Sweeping pronouncements by Gates have been rare. His
decision to orient Microsoft products toward the Internet in 1995,
and more recently to build Web-based software services under the
".Net" rubric, radically altered the company's products and the
markets they dominate.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the security effort is motivated partly by public
relations concerns, analysts agree it is well timed. The Sept. 11
terrorist attacks vaulted security awareness to the top of public
consciousness and the business agenda.</TE>
<TE>   "Microsoft is in a unique position to shape the future of
information technology and to help drive security as a critical
component of our information infrastructure," Charney said.</TE>
<TE>   He faces a daunting challenge. Although no software is impervious
to hackers, the dominance of Microsoft's products has made it a prime
target.</TE>
<TE>   In December, a problem in the company's flagship Windows XP
operating system--touted as the safest ever--allowed hackers to take
control of a user's PC over the Internet. The problem was so
dangerous that it triggered an FBI alert.</TE>
<TE>   Bugnet, an online publication that tracks software flaws, has
reported 287 security-related problems in Microsoft products since
January 2000, or about one every 21/2 days.</TE>
<TE>   Because the company's software is nearly ubiquitous, improving its
security would have far-reaching effects. And competitors would be
compelled to clean up their own problems, said Doug Tygar, a
professor of computer science at UC Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   "Using the Web has become an increasingly unpleasant experience
because of the security and privacy problems," he said. "Making the
Internet a safe place is going to be absolutely key to its continued
success."</TE>
<TE>   Heeding such warnings, Microsoft sent its entire Windows
development team, about 8,000 people, into a security course the
first week in February. They will cease development of all new
features for the rest of the month, instead probing the Windows code
base--the basic programming instructions that define the company's
operating-system products.</TE>
<TE>   Mundie called the move unprecedented in the industry. He pledged
that Microsoft would delay the release of new products if needed to
close security holes.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts applauded those moves as tangible evidence of the
company's good faith.</TE>
<TE>   "They are getting more serious," Hickey said. "Gates senses that
his company's position is threatened if they do not follow through."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Watching for Changes in Product Development</TE>
<TE>   Other experts are waiting to see whether Microsoft will change
what they view as a flawed product development culture.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at the stars at Microsoft," Gartner's Pescatore said.
"They're not the ones who said let's ship late, with fewer features,
to make sure the product is secure."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the push to the Internet, trustworthy computing is not a
"bet-the-company" initiative, said longtime Microsoft watcher Jeffrey
Tarter, editor of Soft-Letter, an industry newsletter. He compared
the security push with a campaign in the 1990s to improve the
company's once-abysmal technical support. In that case, Microsoft
spent billions of dollars to enhance phone and online response.</TE>
<TE>   Tygar and other security experts say that Microsoft should look at
the tight integration between the Windows operating system and
applications such as word processing and e-mail. Such links increase
user productivity, but often open security holes.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft's has generally tried to shield users from the hassle of
endless software settings by automating security functions.</TE>
<TE>   Charney subscribes to that basic approach. "You can make a system
so secure that it's not useful," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, experience suggests that hiding complexity with too
much zeal can run contrary to secure operations. For example,
Microsoft boasts that its server software, designed to manage Web
sites and networks of computers, is easier than competing products to
set up and operate. That may encourage complacency among users,
analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   "You get an awful lot of Microsoft servers set up with simple
default settings or security patches not installed, because the
people who run those servers, on average, are less skilled," Tarter
said.</TE>
<TE>   Vulnerabilities involving Microsoft server software accounted for
more than 85% of 129,000 hacking episodes at 300 companies in the
last half of 2001, according to Riptech Inc., an Alexandria, Va.,
computer security firm.</TE>
<TE>   Mundie acknowledged that computer users must get used to spending
more time and money keeping their systems safe and that Microsoft and
other vendors face a public education and customer confidence
challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Charney described his own security philosophy as one based on
prevention.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people ... want security to be an event, like
[responding to] a fire," Charney said. Instead, it requires continual
vigilance and reevaluation of how products are designed, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Experts view that approach as enlightened. But they say that
Microsoft should also tie pay raises and promotions to strong
security.</TE>
<TE>   Mundie said that security has always been a factor in Microsoft's
compensation and may take on added importance. But the company plans
no fundamental shift in incentives.</TE>

<HD>Lay's Silence Draws Wrath From Senators</HD>
<DH>Hearings: Ex-Enron chief takes the Fifth; panel assails him
for not doing enough to prevent the company's collapse.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON  and EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Former Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth L. Lay invoked his 5th Amendment
right against self-incrimination before Congress on Tuesday, enduring
withering criticism and comparisons to a con man for his role in the
biggest corporate bankruptcy in U.S. history.</LD>
<LD>   At a separate hearing Tuesday, five former chairmen of the
Securities and Exchange Commission agreed that Congress should act to
bolster investor confidence in the financial markets and improve the
independence of auditors.</LD>
<LD>   In his first Capitol Hill appearance since his company's collapse,
Lay expressed "profound sadness about what has happened to Enron" and
said he was invoking the 5th Amendment reluctantly "because it may be
perceived by some that I have something to hide."</LD>
<TE>   His refusal to testify drew the fury of members of the Senate
Commerce Committee, who faulted Lay for failing to do more to prevent
the company's collapse.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Lay, I've concluded that you're perhaps the most accomplished
confidence man since Charles Ponzi," Sen. Peter Fitzgerald (R-Ill.)
lectured him. "I'd say you were a carnival barker, except that
wouldn't be fair to carnival barkers. A carny will at least tell you
up front that he's running a shell game."</TE>
<TE>   "I find ignorance a difficult defense," Sen. Jean Carnahan (D-Mo.)
added. "You and the top executives at Enron were paid enormous sums
of money, presumably because of your financial and management
expertise. It was your job to understand what the company was doing."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.), the committee chairman, referred
to Lay as "Kenny Boy"--the nickname that President Bush gave him--and
said he hoped that the energy trader's collapse would spur the House
to approve a campaign finance reform measure today.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope that this shames us into acting," he said. "We've got to
clean up our own act."</TE>
<TE>   Lay was the sixth witness in Congress' Enron investigations to
invoke the 5th Amendment. Four current or former Enron executives,
including former Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow, declined
to testify, as did David B. Duncan, the Andersen partner who headed
the Enron audit and was fired for shredding documents.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey K. Skilling--who served as Enron chief executive for six
months last year--testified for several hours last week under
skeptical questioning from lawmakers.</TE>
<TE>   After enduring an hour of blistering criticism on everything from
the company's global ventures to its alleged gouging of Californians
during last year's electricity crisis, Lay raised his right hand to
be sworn in. Appearing under a subpoena, Lay, 59, told lawmakers that
he wanted to tell his story--but, after much agonizing, bowed to his
attorney's advice and invoked his 5th Amendment right.</TE>
<TE>   "I am deeply troubled about asserting these rights," Lay said at
the packed hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Citing a Supreme Court ruling calling the 5th Amendment a
protection for the innocent, Lay--who was forced to resign as
chairman and chief executive Jan. 23--asked lawmakers "not to draw a
negative inference" because he was asserting his constitutional
right.</TE>
<TE>   "His every instinct, his every desire, was to testify," his
attorney, Earl J. Silbert, a former Watergate prosecutor, said after
the hearing. "Frankly, it was only on my insistence that he [did] not
do so."</TE>
<TE>   Later, the Senate panel heard from William C. Powers, an Enron
board member and dean of the University of Texas Law School, whose
internal investigation of the company found that accounting abuses
masked more than $1 billion in losses in a one-year period.</TE>
<TE>   The report blamed Enron management, the Andersen accounting firm,
company lawyers and Enron's board for authorizing--and failing to
oversee--off-the-books partnerships whose losses helped spark the
company's Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection filing Dec. 2.</TE>
<TE>   Among other points, senators had intended to question Lay about
why his signature appears on a June 2000 approval sheet for a deal
between Enron and the LJM2 partnership. Lay told the Powers
investigating team that he was unaware of the details of the
partnerships, but his signature on the approval sheet suggests that
he signed off on at least one of the questionable transactions.</TE>
<TE>   Lay told internal investigators he thought the transactions were
OK "because Andersen had signed off on them," Powers told senators
Tuesday. Andersen spokesman Patrick Dorton responded, "There is a
difference between structuring these transactions and offering
accounting advice."</TE>
<TE>   Lay originally was to appear voluntarily before congressional
panels last week, but he abruptly backed out because of what his
lawyer called "prosecutorial" comments of lawmakers on talk shows. He
also was subpoenaed to appear Thursday before the House Financial
Services subcommittee on capital markets, where he plans to assert
the 5th Amendment.</TE>
<TE>   The five former SEC chairmen--whose tenures spanned 25 years and
five presidents--appeared Tuesday before the Senate Banking
Committee. With few exceptions, Arthur Levitt, Richard C. Breeden,
David Ruder, Harold M. Williams and Roderick M. Hills endorsed
restrictions on auditing firms that also provide consulting services
to their clients; faster and fuller disclosure on insider stock sales
and special-purpose entities such as the Enron partnerships;
mandatory replacement of accounting firms after five to seven years
of working for one client; and a new oversight board to regulate
accountants.</TE>
<TE>   They also expressed disappointment that the recently released
White House budget did not include increased pay for SEC enforcement
agents.</TE>
<TE>   "We have had consistent failure of self-regulation in the
accounting industry," Breeden said.</TE>
<TE>   Levitt said he did not believe that a proposal by current SEC
Chairman Harvey L. Pitt to create a new oversight board has enough
enforcement teeth.</TE>
<TE>   Today, a bipartisan group of senators plans to introduce a bill
designed to plug a corporate tax loophole that allows a company to
deduct multimillion-dollar pay from their income taxes even though
the pay never appears on the company books as an expense.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Rep. John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), chairman of the House
Committee on Education and the Workforce, plans to introduce
President Bush's pension reform proposals, which would, among other
things, give employees the right to sell company stock and diversify
into other investment options after they have participated in a
401(k) plan for three years.</TE>
<TE>   An Education and the Workforce subcommittee on employer-employee
relations has scheduled a hearing on retirement security for this
afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday, the House Energy and Commerce Committee is expected to
hear the testimony of Enron Vice President Sherron S. Watkins, whose
August memos to Lay warned of an impending accounting scandal.</TE>

<HD>Ban on Microsoft Witnesses Sought</HD>
<DH>Antitrust: States say the company is using a "hide the
ball" tactic by naming more people.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>State antitrust enforcers asked a federal judge to bar Microsoft
Corp. from calling Chairman Bill Gates and 17 other possible
witnesses, accusing the company of "hide the ball" tactics to ward
off new penalties.</LD>
<LD>   Microsoft last week added 23 names to its list of potential
witnesses for hearings scheduled to start March 11. The software
giant said in its own court filing Tuesday that the additions were a
response to the "sweeping and draconian" remedy proposed by the
states.</LD>
<LD>   The exchange is the latest in a series of volleys fired between
Microsoft and its critics as they prepare for a courtroom showdown
next month on the company's business practices.</LD>
<TE>   Nine of the 18 states involved in the fight want Microsoft to
forfeit control of its Internet Explorer browser as one of the
penalties for illegally protecting its Windows personal computer
operating system monopoly. Nine other states have signed onto a
narrower settlement between Microsoft and the Justice Department
aimed at ending a legal battle that began in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Under a schedule set by U.S. District Judge Colleen
Kollar-Kotelly, Microsoft and the dissenting states have until Feb.
22 to gather evidence and formally question possible witnesses in
preparation for the hearings. The states say they won't have adequate
time to get ready for all of Microsoft's potential witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   "Microsoft is obviously trying yet again to derail this remedy
proceeding to the detriment of consumers and competitors who continue
to be harmed by Microsoft's monopolist conduct," the states' lead
trial attorney, Brendan V. Sullivan Jr., said in the filing. The
group includes New York, California and Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft's original witness list mentioned only six people, all
current Microsoft employees. The additions, submitted on the
court-imposed deadline of Feb. 8, include the chief Washington
lobbyist for rival Oracle Corp., plus officials at 14 other
companies.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft said it settled on most of its proposed witnesses only
in the last few days.</TE>

<HD>News Corp. Writes Off $909 Million for TV Sports</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stung by the high cost of sports broadcasts during one of the worst
advertising slumps in history, News Corp. on Tuesday took a
$909-million operating charge in the second quarter because of its
three expensive U.S. national sports television contracts.</LD>
<LD>   News Corp.'s Fox Entertainment Group wrote off $387 million of its
eight-year, $4.5-billion contract with the National Football League,
$297 million of its eight-year, $1.9-billion NASCAR auto racing deal
and $225 million of its six-year, $2.4-billion contract with Major
League Baseball.</LD>
<LD>   As a result, News Corp.'s net loss in the second quarter ended
Dec. 31 widened to $606 million, or 50 cents a share, from a
$23-million loss, or 3 cents, a year earlier. The company's sales in
the latest quarter rose 7% to $4.12 billion.</LD>
<TE>   "I think you have to say that the prices being paid [for sports]
have gone beyond an economic level, not just here but around the
world," said News Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch in a conference call
with analysts.</TE>
<TE>   More than any other media mogul, Murdoch has built his empire on
the back of sports programming, buying up games for his pay
television services around the world.</TE>
<TE>   Fox's is the largest quarterly write-down ever taken by a network
on sports and underscores the increasingly difficult economics of
such programming for broadcasters. In 1995, Fox took a $350- million
write-down in the second year of its four-year, $1.6-billion contract
with the NFL, and its rival, CBS, wrote down $196 million on its NFL
contract in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Yet fees paid for professional sports have continued to escalate,
as ratings and advertising rates have declined amid a glut of games
on television.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last two seasons, General Electric Co.'s NBC lost an
estimated $300 million on National Basketball Assn. games. And last
month, the network lost the bidding to renew the NBA deal to Walt
Disney Co.'s ABC and ESPN networks. Analysts said Tuesday that they
were surprised that neither of the other two networks with NFL
rights--ABC and Viacom Inc.'s CBS--plan to write down the value of
their football contracts.</TE>
<TE>   News Corp. said the downturn in U.S. advertising has prevented the
company from meeting sales forecasts for sports broadcasts.</TE>
<TE>   News Corp. cut its fiscal 2002 profit forecast because of lowered
expectations for ad sales. Chief Financial Officer David Devoe said
the company's operating profit, excluding interest and taxes,
probably will rise by a percentage in the single digits.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding the sports charge, News Corp. said it would have earned
$203 million, or 17 cents a share, down 25% from $270 million, or 26
cents, a year earlier. That was in line with analysts surveyed by
Thomson Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   The company said that despite the slump in advertising, revenue
gains were driven by its filmed entertainment and cable networks such
as the Fox News Channel. However, these improvements were more than
offset by sharp declines at the television stations, broadcast
network and newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   Operating income in the television division declined to $113
million, down from $211 million a year earlier, because of ratings
decline at the Fox networks, sports programming costs as well as the
advertising slowdown.</TE>
<TE>   News Corp. also said it would no longer buy consulting services
from its auditor, Andersen. The announcement follows similar
disclosures last month by Disney, whose auditor is
PricewaterhouseCoopers.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of the Enron Corp. scandal, many companies are seeking
to avoid a potential conflict of interest by their accounting firms.</TE>
<TE>   The American depositary receipts of Sydney, Australia-based News
Corp. fell 53 cents to $27.35 before the earnings were released.</TE>

<HD>Overture Says 4th-Quarter Earnings Beat Expectations</HD>
<DH>Internet: The former GoTo.com also announces expansion of
Microsoft MSN contract.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE FREY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite a continuing downturn for Internet-related companies,
Overture Services Inc. announced better-than-expected fourth-quarter
earnings Tuesday, with 2001 revenue more than double that of the
previous year.</LD>
<LD>   The company also announced that it has expanded its contract to
provide Microsoft Corp.'s MSN with online search results for another
year. On that news, the company's stock soared $5.91, or 27%, to
close at $27.66 in Nasdaq trading.</LD>
<LD>   Overture, formerly known as GoTo.com, reported after the market
closed that it earned $20.8 million, or 35 cents a share, on revenue
of $101.2 million in the fourth quarter. The company, which offers
pay-for-placement Internet searches, had posted a net loss of $361.7
million, or $7.27 a share, on revenue of $39.8 million the same
quarter in 2000.</LD>
<TE>   For fiscal 2001, Overture reported net income of $20.2 million on
revenue of $288.1 million. It posted a net loss of $458.6 million on
revenue of $103.1 million the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   The company had projected fourth-quarter net income of $10million
on revenue of $76million. It was its second straight quarter of
profitability.</TE>
<TE>   "We're performing ahead of our own expectations," said Overture
Chief Executive Ted Meisel.</TE>
<TE>   Overture provides search results for America Online, Yahoo,
Netscape and other Internet sites.</TE>
<TE>   Advertisers bid for placement in Overture's search results, with
the highest bidder appearing at the top. When a consumer clicks on
the links, the advertiser pays Overture a fee.</TE>
<TE>   Overture generated 442 million paid clicks worldwide for 53,000
active advertisers during the fourth quarter. It generated 228
million paid clicks for 38,000 advertisers the same quarter a year
before.</TE>
<TE>   Advertisers paid an average of 23 cents per click at the end of
2001, an increase of 6 cents from the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say that number could at least double as big names such
as Lego Co. begin to advertise.</TE>
<TE>   "They're adding advertisers at a fairly high rate and they're
adding bigger advertisers," said Safa Rashtchy, a senior analyst with
U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray.</TE>
<TE>   Overture's new contract will keep revenue flowing to the company
from Microsoft's MSN Web site through 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, shares fell 41% when EarthLink Inc. announced it would
not renew Overture's contract and launched a new search engine
powered by technology from Google Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Though the company's contracts with America Online Inc. and Yahoo
Inc. come up for renewal later this year, Overture's new agreement
with Microsoft strengthens its position, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "This totally locks up the market for them," Rashtchy said. "It
almost doesn't matter if you have competition."</TE>
<TE>   The company projected first-quarter net income of $21 million on
revenue of $122 million and fiscal 2002 net income of $58 million on
revenue of $442 million.</TE>
<TE>   * Applied Materials Inc. lost $45million in the fiscal first
quarter but beat expectations as the San Jose chip-making equipment
giant continued to struggle with weak demand.</TE>
<TE>   For the three months ended Jan. 27, Applied lost $45 million, or 6
cents a share, compared with a profit of $157 million, or 19 cents,
in the year-ago period.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding special items, the company earned $15 million, or 2
cents a share, compared with a profit of $424 million, or 50 cents, a
year ago. Analysts were expecting the company to break even.
First-quarter revenue fell 58% to $1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   * Infogrames Inc., a video game publisher in Santa Monica, posted
a 30% rise in sales but a 26% drop in profit for its fiscal second
quarter because of higher royalty payments and a charge related to
the bankruptcy of Kmart Corp. Net income fell to $12.2 million, or 17
cents a share, from $16.2 million, or 24 cents a share, a year
earlier. Revenue rose to $165.8 million, from $127.5 million a year
earlier. Infogrames, the U.S. subsidiary of France-based parent,
Infogrames SA, wrote off $4.2 million owed by Kmart, about two-thirds
of what it is owed by the troubled retailer.</TE>
<TE>   * Stamps.com, the Santa Monica online postage service, said its
fourth-quarter loss narrowed dramatically as it reported its first
operating profit on continuing operations. The company lost $987,000,
or 2 cents a share, from a deficit of $68.4million, or $1.4 a share,
a year earlier. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization from continuing operations totaled $300,000, compared
with a $2.4-million loss a year earlier. Sales fell 15% to
$4.5million.</TE>

<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>A bankruptcy judge has cleared the way for Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co.
to spend up to $75 million to upgrade a bottleneck in its
transmission system that contributed to last year's rolling
blackouts.</LD>
<LD>   PG&amp;E's Path 15 near Los Banos in the San Joaquin Valley gained
notoriety last winter when the 84-mile stretch of high-voltage
transmission lines was unable to handle enough electricity from
Southern California to keep the lights on in the north.</LD>
<LD>   The $300-million project will add a third line to the two already
present and make other improvements.</LD>
<TE>   Under the direction of U.S. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, PG&amp;E
is working with several private and public agencies and businesses to
make improvements and share ownership of the new line.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue from the new line will be regulated by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali must approve all PG&amp;E spending
requests over $50 million. PG&amp;E filed for federal bankruptcy
protection 10 months ago after soaring power prices drove it into
debt. It claims it owes it creditors more than $13 billion.</TE>

<HD>Rerun of SAG Election Takes a Nasty Turn</HD>
<DH>Labor: Accusations and criticism are flying between
factions as the actors guild repeats the polling for president and
two other offices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES BATES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Take 2 of the election to decide who will lead the Screen Actors
Guild is shaping up as one of the nastiest ever, even at a union
where turmoil has been the norm for years.</LD>
<LD>   Words like "slug," "hatchet man" and accusations of "hijacking"
the election are being hurled by supporters of the leading contenders
for the top union posts.</LD>
<LD>   Current SAG President Melissa Gilbert broke her silence in an
interview Tuesday, accusing opponent Valerie Harper of launching a
"brutal" personal campaign. She said Harper in TV and radio
appearances over the last week has unfairly accused her of being cozy
with talent agents, producers and even Canadian film interests.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm truly amazed at the tone," Gilbert said.</TE>
<TE>   Harper countered in an interview that she is merely criticizing
Gilbert's stance on issues that are important to actors.</TE>
<TE>   She also said that she has decided to run a more aggressive
campaign than she did last fall after deciding she had not
sufficiently countered allegations made by Gilbert. Harper said she
was not as concerned now with the possible media response as she was
last fall.</TE>
<TE>   "Things change. I thought then it was bad to subject staff
members, guild members and our union to it. The media would have
turned it into the cat fight at SAG: 'Half Pint' takes on 'Rhoda,'"
Harper said, referring to her role as Rhoda Morgenstern in the 1970s
TV series "Rhoda" and Gilbert's role as Laura Ingalls in "Little
House on the Prairie."</TE>
<TE>   The volleys between the two leading presidential candidates come
as SAG members are receiving ballots this week, with a March 8
deadline. A new election was ordered by a five-member union committee
because New York members had two extra days to vote, and ballots sent
to members contained no signature line.</TE>
<TE>   Gilbert will stay in office until the results are announced.</TE>
<TE>   The new round of voting is for president and two other offices:
treasurer, which was won in the previous election by actor Kent
McCord, and recording secretary, won by Elliott Gould.</TE>
<TE>   Also running for president are two lesser-known candidates, Eugene
Boggs and Angeltomkins.</TE>
<TE>   Harper and supporters of a new election argue that the violations
were serious.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of a new election, notably SAG First Vice President Mike
Farrell, say minor voting infractions would not have affected the
election.</TE>
<TE>   With each day, the name-calling gets worse. Gilbert supporters
have despairingly dubbed Harper backers "Val's Pals." Gould was
quoted at a rally this week as calling Farrell a "slug."</TE>
<TE>   At stake is the most visible job at the union that continues to be
bitterly divided into two camps.</TE>
<TE>   Harper is an outspoken supporter of former President William
Daniels, who believed in a tougher posture with studios, advertisers
and agents. Gilbert's camp believes that the Daniels regime failed,
and led actors on an ill-fated six-month strike in 2000 against
advertisers.</TE>
<TE>   In the interview, Gilbert accused Harper of being a hypocrite for
asking her not to campaign last month in the interest of union unity.</TE>
<TE>   Harper said an agreement to refrain from campaigning was discussed
by all candidates but that no agreement was reached. She added that
Gilbert supporters fired the first shot when they criticized the
decision to hold a new election.</TE>
<TE>   Gilbert also said she is refusing Harper's offer to debate. Last
fall, it was Harper who declined to debate. Gilbert said that with
ballots being mailed out this week it's too late and that Harper
should have taken her up on the offer last fall. Harper said
Gilbert's refusal is disingenuous, given that she criticized Harper
for ducking her in the earlier election.</TE>
<TE>   SAG's infighting has been aired in public for nearly four years.
But Harper said other unions and organizations probably fight just as
much, only their members aren't as well-known.</TE>
<TE>   "It's because we're famous. If we were the plumbers union, no one
would care," Harper said.</TE>

<HD>FTC Takes Action on E-Mail Schemes</HD>
<DH>Probe: Seven must return future funds gained from chain
letter. Agency warns others.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID COLKER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the first of a series of planned government crackdowns on junk
e-mail schemes, the Federal Trade Commission announced actions
Tuesday against one of the most widely distributed get-rich-quick
scams.</LD>
<LD>   The e-mail, which promised recipients they could "Be a millionaire
like others within a year!" on a $25 investment, is an illegal chain
letter ruse, the FTC said. Seven people caught last year in an agency
sting agreed to a federal court judgment that required them to return
future funds gained from the scheme.</LD>
<LD>   In addition, the FTC said it had sent warning letters to 2,000
other people allegedly involved in distributing the e-mail.</LD>
<TE>   FTC officials said they are serious about pursuing e-mail scams,
but they acknowledge it's an uphill battle. The agency has only 271
investigators to examine all types of commercial claims nationwide,
online or otherwise. Some computer users get at least that many
unsolicited e-mail offers a week.</TE>
<TE>   "If we or others involved could figure out an efficient way to
make it stop, we would," said Eileen Harrington, the agency's
associate director for marketing practices.</TE>
<TE>   The chain letter e-mail--which asked a recipient to send $5 to
five people listed, substitute his or her own name for one and then
forward the e-mail to as many people as possible--came to the
agency's attention because of its bold claim of legitimacy. "If you
have any questions of the legality of this program," the e-mail
stated, "contact the Office of Associate Director for Marketing
Practices, Federal Trade Commission."</TE>
<TE>   Harrington started receiving calls about two years ago. "They've
got some chutzpah, putting that in the e-mail," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In September 2000, the FTC sent 1,000 letters to people named in
the e-mail, warning them that chain mail is illegal. One of the
letters was received by Chad and Megan Estenson of Warwick, N.D.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a generic letter, we didn't think it matched this
program," said Megan Estenson, 27, who is a Head Start teacher. They
believed the e-mail they were distributing was legal because they
received goods--a series of reports on topics such as "The Insider's
Guide to Advertising for Free on the Internet"--for their initial $25
payment.</TE>
<TE>   But receiving goods does not make a chain mail-type program legal
unless there is a source of outside income to support claims of
wealth to be gained.</TE>
<TE>   In October 2001, the couple accepted a $5 payment from an FTC
investigator working undercover, thus substantiating they were still
involved in the scheme.</TE>
<TE>   Megan Estenson said she and her husband didn't realize they were
breaking the law until they received a notice that the FTC had taken
action against them in U.S. District Court. "Of course, you feel
foolish," she said. "I'm a college- educated woman. We fell for this
thinking it was something legal."</TE>
<TE>   Still, she resents the action taken against them. "The FTC is a
big hammer and we are a little nail. I don't really know why they are
wasting their time on me, when there is something like Enron out
there," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She would not disclose how much she and her husband had received
from the scheme, but said it was nothing approaching the riches
promised. Since signing the court judgment, she said they had
received and returned $25.</TE>
<TE>   Returning funds received only after the court action seems like
little more than a wrist slap, but Harrington said a federal court
stipulation is a serious matter.</TE>
<TE>   "There are many times in our lives when we have to fill out papers
that ask if we have ever been the subject of a law enforcement
action," Harrington said. "It will follow them everywhere."</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>   Qualcomm Inc. shareholders reelected director Frank Savage,
rejecting labor and pension group opposition to his role as a
director of Enron Corp., the energy trader that filed the largest
bankruptcy petition in U.S. history.</LD>
<LD>   The vote was announced at the annual shareholder meeting in San
Diego of the company that licenses patents for mobile phones. Savage
and four other directors were reelected to three-year terms with more
than 95% of the vote, Chief Executive Irwin Jacobs said.</LD>
<TE>   The vote suggests connections to Enron won't necessarily
disqualify a director from serving on another company's board. The
California Public Employees' Retirement System, which owns
3.45million Qualcomm shares, and the AFL-CIO labor federation were
among groups opposing reelection of Savage, mainly because of his
connection with Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Savage, 63, was chairman of Alliance Capital Management
International from 1993 to 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Savage was not at the meeting, but he attended a board meeting
Monday, Jacobs said.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Qualcomm fell 78 cents to close at $40.50 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Apple Set to Withhold Latest QuickTime</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jon Healey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Apple Computer Inc. said it plans to withhold the new version of its
popular QuickTime digital media software in a bid to increase support
for MPEG-4, an emerging standard for compressed digital video.</LD>
<LD>   Company officials said they objected to a 2-cents-per-hour fee
that the 18 MPEG-4 patent holders, including Microsoft Corp.,
Matsushita, Philips Electronics and Sony Corp., want to collect from
the companies that transmit video in that format.</LD>
<LD>   Unless that fee is dropped, Web-based broadcasters and video
companies will stick with non-standard technologies such as
Microsoft's Windows Media Video instead of switching to MPEG-4, Apple
officials said.</LD>
<TE>   Apple, Microsoft and RealNetworks Inc. are the leading suppliers
of software for encoding, transmitting and playing compressed digital
video, but their current products all emphasize non-standard
technologies.</TE>
<TE>   Apple plans to withhold QuickTime 6, its first software built on
MPEG-4, until the licensing fees for broadcasters are dropped.</TE>
<TE>   In a related development, Apple announced an alliance with
Ericsson, a leading supplier of mobile phones and related equipment,
and Sun Microsystems Inc. to sell video technology to wireless
networks. The technology, which will be based on MPEG-4, will enable
consumers to receive film clips on their hand-held devices.</TE>

<HD>ImClone Rejects Erbitux Demands</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ImClone Systems Inc. on Tuesday rejected partner Bristol-Myers Squibb
Co.'s demands to remove top executives and hand over control of their
stalled cancer drug, Erbitux.</LD>
<LD>   Bristol-Myers is considering legal and business options and will
decide after a meeting with regulators Feb. 26, Chief Executive Peter
Dolan told ImClone in a letter. Earlier, Bristol-Myers, the largest
maker of cancer drugs, threatened to walk away from their partnership
if ImClone rejected its terms.</LD>
<LD>   The partners are fighting over potential profit from Erbitux and
which should lead the effort to get the drug approved by the Food and
Drug Administration.</LD>
<TE>   The agency, which refused to consider Erbitux in December, will
outline at the Feb. 26 meeting what steps ImClone must take to get
the drug accepted for review.</TE>
<TE>   "The FDA meeting may clarify a lot of things, such as the cost and
the time it will require to go ahead with the drug," said Jordan
Schreiber, manager of the Merrill Lynch Healthcare Fund.</TE>
<TE>   ImClone sees no need to renegotiate the agreement, ImClone
Chairman Robert Goldhammer said in a letter to Dolan after a meeting
of ImClone directors Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Goldhammer's letter invited Dolan to meet with ImClone's senior
management "to explore ways in which the company ... can work most
effectively to obtain FDA approval" of Erbitux.</TE>
<TE>   That suggested to some analysts the door may still be open for
negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   ImClone shares rose 82 cents to $17.65 on Nasdaq. Bristol-Myers
rose 21 cents to $45.38 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Key Indexes Turn Lower as Telecom Stocks Fall</HD>
<DH>Wall St. Nortel, Lucent and Qualcomm drop amid concern
about corporate spending.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shares of telecom equipment makers led major indexes to their first
loss in three sessions Tuesday after Nortel Networks said its
customers scaled back purchases in the last month.</LD>
<LD>   Lucent Technologies, Qualcomm and Ciena dropped with Nortel amid
concern that businesses may be reluctant to invest in technology even
as the economy recovers.</LD>
<LD>   "We're not getting the reinforcement from corporate America that
we need," said Jeff Swensen, a trader at John Hancock Advisers Inc.</LD>
<TE>   The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index fell 4.44 points, or 0.4%, to
1,107.50, with telecom equipment makers accounting for one-fifth of
the drop. The Nasdaq composite index slid 12.45 points, or 0.7%, to
1,834.21. The Dow Jones industrial average declined 21.04 points, or
0.2%, to 9,863.74 after trading as high as 9,906.</TE>
<TE>   The New York Stock Exchange had its slowest day of the year, with
slightly more than 1 billion shares traded on the exchange floor.
Rising and falling stocks were about even on the NYSE and Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks have fallen this year partly on speculation that some U.S.
companies have not been forthcoming with investors about their
finances. Nortel added to that concern Monday when it said it fired
Chief Financial Officer Terry Hungle because of personal trades he
made that violated retirement plan investing rules.</TE>
<TE>   Nortel shares declined 42 cents to $6.42. Although it said
customers cut spending in the last 25 days, the firm maintained its
forecast that first-quarter sales will fall about 10% from the fourth
quarter. The company expects to return to profitability by year's
end.</TE>
<TE>   Nortel's announcement suggests that the economy may not be
recovering as fast as many corporate executives had expected, said
Brian Pears, trader at Victory Capital Management. He said many
investors bought Nortel and Lucent late last year expecting a
turnaround.</TE>
<TE>   Lucent, North America's largest phone equipment maker, fell 26
cents to $5.99. Ciena, the second-biggest maker of optical network
equipment in the U.S., dropped 39 cents to $10.08. Qualcomm, which
licenses patents for mobile phones, lost 78 cents to $40.50. The Amex
index of networking stocks lost 3.3% and is off 13.7% year to date.</TE>
<TE>   Avaya, spun off from Lucent in October 2000, had its bond rating
cut to "junk" status by Standard &amp; Poor's after the maker of office
phone equipment agreed to pledge its domestic assets to secure a
$1.25-billion line of credit. Its shares fell 78 cents to $5.70.</TE>
<TE>   In other market news:</TE>
<TE>   * Investors shunned Treasury bonds for the fourth day in five
after General Electric Capital and mortgage buyer Freddie Mac sold
$9.5 billion of bonds, swelling supply and luring money from
government securities. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury
bond rose to 4.98% from 4.91% Monday.</TE>
<TE>   * Harley-Davidson fell $3.04 to $50.99 as investors worried about
a possible slowdown in demand for its distinctive heavyweight
motorcycles.</TE>
<TE>   Overseas, a rally in bank stocks helped boost the Japanese market
more than 2% as investors bet that the government is preparing
another bailout of an industry mired in bad loans. The government
wants to help banks sell shareholdings that have fallen in value so
they can avoid slashing their capital, as would be required under new
accounting rules. The Topix index in Tokyo rose 2.5% on Tuesday and
was higher in early trading today.</TE>

<HD>MetLife Reports Loss of $296 Million for Quarter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>MetLife Inc. had a loss in the fourth quarter, reflecting stagnant
sales and losses on investments in Enron Corp. and Argentina. The
largest U.S. life insurer also incurred expenses of $489 million as
it fired staff and set aside money to settle lawsuits.</LD>
<LD>   The New York-based company's net loss was $296 million, or 41
cents a share, compared with net income of $591 million, or 74 cents,
a year earlier. Revenue was little changed at $8.4 billion.</LD>
<LD>   MetLife took $172 million in investment losses and absorbed costs
for the pending lawsuit settlement and job cuts. Excluding these
items and another related to annuity contracts, profit rose 9%,
exceeding analysts' expectations. Chief Executive Robert Benmosche
has taken steps to reduce expenses, though analysts said the company
needs to boost revenue.</LD>
<TE>   MetLife put aside $159 million in the quarter to settle pending
litigation over alleged race-based pricing of policies sold before
1973. The insurer also had $330 million in costs to cut about 2,100
jobs, or 7% of staff, and a $74-million expense related to group
annuity contracts at a unit.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding these items and realized investment losses, profit rose
to $439 million, or 59 cents a share, from $404 million, or 51 cents,
a year earlier. Analysts expected MetLife to earn 58 cents, according
to a poll by Thomson Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   MetLife shares gained 80 cents to $30.37 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Other company earnings, excluding one-time gains and charges
unless noted:</TE>
<TE>   * Deere &amp; Co., the largest tractor maker, had a loss of $38
million, or 16 cents a share, in the quarter ended Jan. 31, compared
with net income of $56 million, or 24 cents, a year earlier. Sales
fell 6.8% to $2.52billion.</TE>
<TE>   * TrizecHahn Corp. said its fourth-quarter earnings rose 17% to
$88 million, or 58 cents a share. Revenue rose to $291.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   The results don't include $369.5million in previously announced
charges, mainly to write down the value of properties, including
Hollywood &amp; Highland, the new home of the Academy Awards show.</TE>

<HD>Moody's Drops Proposal to Assess Credit More Often</HD>
<DH>Securities: Decision comes on pressure from investors who
say higher frequency would boost bond, stock volatility.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Moody's Investors Service is backing away from the idea of raising
and lowering corporate credit assessments more often--a plan it put
forth in the wake of Enron Corp.'s largely unforeseen collapse.</LD>
<LD>   The credit-rating firm said it is bowing to pressure from
investors who said the proposal to react more quickly to perceived
changes in companies' finances would make corporate bond prices and
perhaps stocks too volatile.</LD>
<LD>   "We expected that investors would be enthusiastic, but they were
not," said Chris Mahoney, chairman of Moody's credit policy committee
in New York. "They were very, very vocally opposed to an increase in
ratings volatility."</LD>
<TE>   Moody's is seeking to balance demands from investors that ratings
on companies don't swing too wildly, while ensuring that they
accurately reflect shifting credit risks. Lawmakers have been calling
for ratings procedures to be tightened to detect deteriorating
corporate credit. Moody's rated Enron an investment-grade company
until four days before the company went bankrupt.</TE>
<TE>   Investors for years have complained that the top two rating
companies, Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's, have taken too long to
upgrade or downgrade companies. Yet the prospect of rapid changes now
has them unnerved.</TE>
<TE>   Money managers base investment decisions partly on ratings given
to bonds by Moody's and S&amp;P.</TE>
<TE>   Investors can be forced to sell securities if ratings change
notably, particularly from investment-grade to junk.</TE>
<TE>   Moody's said it still plans to hasten reviews of credit ratings,
which typically have taken as long as 90 days. The firm already has
sped up some of its ratings.</TE>
<TE>   Ford Motor Co., for example, was under review for a possible
downgrade for just three days in January before Moody's cut the
firm's ratings. The previous review took two months.</TE>
<TE>   Moody's said it also will pay more attention to bond and stock
market moves, but it "will not allow such market opinion to take the
place of fundamental credit analysis."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>American Airlines will unveil two new television commercials Thursday
during NBC's coverage of the Winter Olympics. The spots that will run
in Los Angeles, New York and other large cities are part of the
airline's slow return to traditional airline advertising after Sept.
11.</LD>
<LD>   One advertisement describes the airline's role in "the free flow
of people and ideas and products and joy." The other spot addresses
the flying public's demand for "the freedom to come and go anywhere,
any time, with confidence and peace of mind." Both commercials
identify the airline as "proud to bear the name American."</LD>
<LD>   The commercials are precursors to a longer-range ad campaign to
begin later this year.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of American's parent firm AMR Corp. rose 52 cents to $24.80
on the NYSE.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>America West Airlines Inc. will make money in March, its first
profitable month since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, and lose about
$100 million this year, Chief Executive W. Douglas Parker said.</LD>
<LD>   The eighth-largest U.S. carrier, a unit of America West Holdings
Corp., is losing less than $1 million a day, compared with about $5
million a day shortly after the attacks. It will earn money next
month as people travel for spring break and Easter, Parker said.</LD>
<LD>   "Don't take that to mean every month thereafter will be cash
positive," Parker said. Phoenix-based America West last month
received a $429-million loan secured by the government, ending the
threat of a possible bankruptcy filing.</LD>

<HD>Kaiser Aluminum Files for Chapter 11</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kaiser Aluminum Corp. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, a
move that probably will lead to further consolidation in the ailing
aluminum industry.</LD>
<LD>   Houston-based Kaiser, which employs more than 6,000, said it
expected to secure $300 million in financing from Bank of America
Corp. The company listed total assets of $3.3 billion and debts of
$3.1 billion.</LD>
<LD>   The aluminum industry has fallen on hard times, crippled by a
manufacturing slowdown that has driven down prices. Kaiser also said

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ford Motor Co. is recalling 640,975 cars because a problem in the
engine cooling system can start a fire under the hood. The recall
involves the 1995 Ford Mustang, Ford Taurus and the Taurus' twin, the
Mercury Sable.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, the Chrysler arm of DaimlerChrysler will recall about
585,000 sport-utility vehicles and pickups for separate problems,
U.S. regulators said.</LD>
<LD>   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Chrysler
will recall 316,148 Jeep Wrangler SUVs made between June 1989 and
December 1995 to fix the parking brake, which can release on its own.</LD>
<TE>   Chrysler also will recall 268,740 Dodge Ram pickups to fix an
alternator wire that can come loose and create a fire hazard. That
recall covers 2001 model year pickups built between January and
August 2000.</TE>

<LD>Despite budding signs that the worst may be over for the U.S.
economy, most key data remain at levels that indicate a recession,
according to a panel of economists deemed the country's recession
arbiter.</LD>
<LD>   Although some encouraging data have rolled out in recent weeks,
the National Bureau of Economic Research's business cycle dating
committee said that among the four U.S. indicators it
watches--employment, industrial production, wholesale-retail trade
and income--only income has not performed in a way typical of a
recession in the last eight months.</LD>
<LD>   The panel said income has fared better than the other key
indicators partly because of falling import prices and continued
growth in worker productivity.</LD>

<HD>SunTrust to Drop Andersen, Says Enron Case Not a Factor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SunTrust Banks Inc. said Tuesday that its board decided to drop
Andersen, its auditor of about 60 years, and hire rival
PricewaterhouseCoopers, becoming one of the first major companies to
sever ties with the accounting firm since the Enron Corp. scandal
broke.</LD>
<LD>   But the Atlanta-based bank said its decision to switch auditors
for 2002 had nothing to do with Andersen's controversial audits of
Enron or the quality and integrity of Andersen's previous audits.</LD>
<LD>   SunTrust said it regularly reviews outside service contracts and
began accepting bids from accounting firms in April 2001, before
Enron's problems emerged.</LD>
<TE>   Andersen was among firms that bid on the accounting contract last
year, a SunTrust spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   SunTrust declined to comment on how much money it might save, or
what services it would gain, by hiring PricewaterhouseCoopers.
Andersen billed SunTrust $1.7 million in 2000 for audits and $1.4
million for other services, according to documents filed with
regulators.</TE>
<TE>   "We wish the company well and we regret the loss of any client,"
said Patrick Dorton, a spokesman at Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Andersen  said it is losing business as a result of
the Enron scandal. It said longtime clients were asking tough
questions, although they were sticking by the firm.</TE>

<LD>Much of the Internet's network devices--from desktop computers to

hackers to shut them down or gain control of the devices, a
government-funded research group warned.</LD>
<LD>   The problem is most serious for Internet service providers, which
use systems called routers to manage the flow of messages across
computer networks and the Internet, the group said.</LD>
<LD>   The CERT Coordination Center, based at Carnegie Mellon University

<HD>Safety Agency Won't Probe Explorer</HD>
<DH>Investigation: NHTSA says the data do not show the SUV to
have more defects than similar vehicles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUEJONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>Federal safety regulators Tuesday denied a request by tire maker
Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. to conduct a safety defect investigation
into the Ford Explorer sport-utility vehicle.</LD>
<LD>   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it made
the decision after an extensive analysis of agency data and
information provided by Firestone and Ford Motor Co. The data do not
support Firestone's contention that Explorers stand out from other
SUVs with respect to its handling characteristics following a tread
separation," NHTSA Administrator Jeffrey Runge said in a statement.</LD>
<LD>   Bridgestone/Firestone submitted the request in May 2001, asking
the agency to open an inquiry into the handling and control
characteristics of the Explorer after Firestone tires that lost their
treads were linked to hundreds of Explorer roll-over accidents. At
least 271 people were killed and hundreds more injured. Firestone
launched two recalls of 10 million tires in the last 18 months.</LD>
<TE>   Firestone cited a report by an Ohio State University professor
that said the Explorer showed a propensity to over-steer, or turn
more tightly than drivers intend, after a tire failure.</TE>
<TE>   But NHTSA said the report and other data did not show "that
Explorers in general ... are more likely to exhibit linear range
oversteer characteristics following a rear tire tread separation than
many of their peers.</TE>
<TE>   "Moreover, a vehicle cannot be found to contain a safety-related
defect under our statute solely because it has not been designed to
preclude" the linear range oversteer.</TE>
<TE>   Sue Cischke, Ford's vice president of environmental and safety
engineering, said NHTSA's decision "is consistent with real-world
performance data showing the Explorer to be among the safest of
vehicles, and NHTSA's previous finding that many Firestone Wilderness
AT tires built before 1998 contain a safety defect."</TE>
<TE>   Bridgestone/Firestone spokeswoman Jill Bratina had no comment
other than, "NHTSA has made its determination."</TE>
<TE>   The agency's decision comes less than two weeks after a Barstow
jury in a rollover injury case ruled the Explorer was defectively
designed, the first time a jury determined the SUV had a design
defect due to its risk of rolling over.</TE>
<TE>   But the jury also found Ford not responsible for the crash or for
the damages, and that the defect did not cause the injuries in that
case. The injured family received a total of $14.9 million from a
Ford dealer the jury found failed to repair the used Explorer; from
Caltrans and a highway contractor.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the government repeated its warning on SUVs flipping
over in accidents. "The Ford Explorer decision aside, NHTSA reminds
consumers that SUVs in general have a greater tendency to roll over
during a crash than passenger cars," the agency said. "In 2000, 62%
of all SUV fatalities were the result of rollover, compared to 22%
for passenger cars."</TE>
<TE>   NHTSA's decision not to investigate the Explorer is consistent
with what it says is its legal mandate.</TE>
<TE>   According to the agency, it is barred from taking actions that
might reduce consumer choice or eliminate whole classes of vehicles.
As a result, it says, it can't declare vehicles defective unless
their safety risks are significantly worse than other vehicles in
their class.</TE>

<HD>NASD Offers Guide to Stock Ratings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Acknowledging how confusing stock analyst recommendations can be, the
National Assn. of Securities Dealers Inc. has issued a guide to help
investors decipher equity research reports.</LD>
<LD>   The "Guide to Understanding Securities Analyst Recommendations"
was posted Tuesday at the brokerage industry group's Web site
(www.nasd.com), along with a glossary of terms commonly used in the
reports.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey L.
Pitt urged brokerages to immediately comply with an NASD proposal
that would require them to provide additional information in research
reports and stiffen barriers between a firm's analysts and investment
bankers.</LD>
<TE>   That plan is aimed at minimizing conflicts of interest in the
brokerage industry, which has come under fire for its supposed lack
of objectivity. Critics say analysts face pressure to issue glowing
reports that may help their brokerages win or keep investment banking
deals with the companies they cover.</TE>
<TE>   Although not new, the criticism has gained momentum in the wake of
Enron Corp.'s collapse. Many analysts maintained positive
recommendations on Enron's stock right up until the company filed for
bankruptcy protection in December.</TE>
<TE>   SEC approval of the NASD's plan is expected to take two months.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the investor guide explains that Wall Street analysts
rarely use a simple buy-sell-hold scale to rate stocks; instead, each
firm issues its own set of labels or delicate euphemisms.</TE>
<TE>   At Firm A, for example, "buy" may be the top rating, followed by
"outperform," "neutral," "underperform" and "avoid." At Firm B,
ratings may run from "strong buy" to "buy" to "hold" to "sell." At
Firm C, "recommended list" might be the top mark, followed by
"trading buy," "market outperformer," "market perform" and "market
underperformer."</TE>
<TE>   The guide also acknowledges one of Wall Street's worst-kept
secrets--that the word "sell" is scarcely used. Frequently, a "hold"
rating in effect means "sell," the NASD notes.</TE>

<LD>GameStop Corp., the video-game store unit of Barnes &amp; Noble Inc.,
raised $325 million in its initial public offering Tuesday,
capitalizing on surging sales in one of the fastest-growing retail

<LD>   The IPO values GameStop at $972 million. Barnes &amp; Noble (BKS) will
own Class B shares, giving it voting power of about 95%.</LD>
<TE>   Also Tuesday, JetBlue Airways Corp. filed for an initial public
stock offering to raise as much as $125 million to buy planes as the
low-fare carrier prepares to fly to more cities.</TE>
<TE>   The company hasn't disclosed how many shares it will offer or an
estimated price.</TE>

<LD>Two sheriff's deputies were injured when a driver lost control of his
car and struck them as they were making vehicle security checks at
John Wayne Airport.</LD>
<LD>   Sammy Black, a 22-year-veteran, had both legs broken in several
places Tuesday. Christopher Hancock, who has been with the Orange
County Sheriff's Department for two years, suffered cuts and bruises,
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The deputies were searching rental cars being returned when a car
driven by George Mack, 80, of Salem, Ore., slammed into one of the
vehicles, pinning Black between two bumpers, authorities said. The
car he was inspecting then slid into the car in front, striking
Hancock.</LD>

<LD>Concerned that traffic has increased to dangerous levels, Ventura
County supervisors Tuesday created a panel to investigate ways to
improve safety along semi-rural Santa Rosa Road near Camarillo.</LD>
<LD>   The action comes two months after a 14-year-old Camarillo honor
student was struck and killed as she jogged along the two-lane
stretch with her father.</LD>
<LD>   Residents of Santa Rosa Valley said that creation of the group,
made up of homeowners and government representatives, is a good first
step in correcting problems along the six-mile corridor that connects
Moorpark and Thousand Oaks with Camarillo.</LD>

<HD>Burglary Suspect Is Described as a Poor Driver, Unable to
Eat an Apple</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Under the heading "Only in Hollywood," the LAPD's Blue Line
publication relates that a suspected burglar bit his victim, then
fled in a stolen car. But he left one piece of evidence behind: his
false teeth.</LD>
<LD>   Officers noticed a name and serial number inscribed on the
dentures.</LD>
<LD>   "An inquiry in the computer system revealed the number was, in
fact, a California Department of Corrections ID number," Blue Line
said. The suspect was an ex-con.</LD>
<TE>   The defanged suspect topped off his day by crashing into a
signpost while being chased by other officers, who captured him.</TE>
<TE>   Moral of the story: If you're going to bite a victim's arm, use a
pair of unmarked false teeth.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of brains: Near Lake Arrowhead, Wally Schultz snapped a
warning that seemed directed at illiterates (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And while we're at it: Darby Ziegler of Huntington Beach found a
real estate flier showing no evidence of the utmost in copy editing
skills (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   It was only a matter of time: Jorge Estrada of Los Angeles found a
reference in a local newspaper to a lane that is apparently reserved
for road-rage participants (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   This never happened to Joe Friday: A resident phoned the Los
Angeles County sheriff's substation in Paramount and asked to speak
to the deputy who had taken her crime report.</TE>
<TE>   Asked the deputy's name, she said she was looking at his business
card but wasn't sure how to pronounce it. She said it was spelled,
"F-A-C-S-I-M-I-L-E."</TE>
<TE>   She was told to check the middle of the card, and there she found
the deputy's actual name.</TE>
<TE>   City Talk, the newsletter of Paramount, couldn't help quipping:
"Just the FAX, Ma'am."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   L.A. vs. the world: The controversy over the Russians winning the
gold medal over the Canadians in pairs figure skating at Salt Lake
City calls to mind a Winter Olympics dispute that involved the Los
Angeles City Council.</TE>
<TE>   In 1988, City Councilman Ernani Bernardi rose during the opening
minutes of a session to declare that American figure skater Debi
Thomas had been "shafted" by the East European judges.</TE>
<TE>   Council President John Ferraro reminded Bernardi with a laugh
that, since Winter Olympics judging was not on the council agenda,
any discussion of the subject was a violation of the state's Ralph M.
Brown Act.</TE>
<TE>   "White act, blue act, green act--I don't care," the irascible
Bernardi responded.</TE>
<TE>   The councilman added, for good measure, that winning skater
Katarina Witt of East Germany wore a "weird outfit."</TE>
<TE>   I can't remember if Mr. Blackwell agreed.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: The California Avocado Commission is trying to
persuade consumers to add the fruit to bacon, lettuce and tomato
sandwiches. Its billboard says: "Your BLT Could Use a Vowel."</TE>
<TE>   I'm not sure I could order a BLAT, though.</TE>

<HD>Little Saigon Ushers In the New Year</HD>
<DH>Festivities: County's Vietnamese observe the lunar holiday
with incense and prayers for good luck.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<LD>David Nguyen sees himself as a simple man. On Tuesday, though, he was
anything but. He sported a new hairdo, a new black suit with a new
green tie and new shiny dress shoes.</LD>
<LD>   "It's once a year," he said. "I have to start the new year right,
with everything new."</LD>
<LD>   Nguyen, a merchant in the heart of Little Saigon, joined hundreds
of thousands of Vietnamese and Chinese Americans in Southern
California as they celebrated the Lunar New Year on Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   For Chinese, Vietnamese and some Koreans, it is the most important
cultural and religious holiday of the year, a time marked with
caution and festivities, tradition and superstition. There is an
emphasis on securing good luck for the year ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Like the Chinese New Year and the Korean Sol, Tet Nguyen Dan for
the Vietnamese--known simply as Tet--is a time for renewal and family
bonding. Tuesday began the Year of the Horse, which comes around
every 12 years.</TE>
<TE>   In Little Saigon, the smell of freshly baked bread was replaced
with incense. Shops along Bolsa Avenue, usually alive with lights and
blaring music, were dim. And on a street that typically attracts as
many as 32,000 motorists a day, traffic was thin.</TE>
<TE>   The Lunar New Year is a time of year when business owners close
their shops for days at a time and consult a fortune teller before
deciding which would be the luckiest day to reopen.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a belief that what happens on the first day takes place
throughout the whole year," said Kim Son Vo, a professor and
coordinator for the Intercultural Development Center at Cal State
Fullerton.</TE>
<TE>   Nguyen, 41, said he hopes his customers will continue to buy
jogging suits, traditional dresses and luggage at his shop, Mindy
Fashion.</TE>
<TE>   And to ensure such good fortunes, he and his wife, Mindy, 38,
lighted incense, bowed for prayers and burned joss paper Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We're hoping for business to remain good this year," said Nguyen,
a Fountain Valley resident. "We want to start the year off right."</TE>
<TE>   Down the street at the Asian Village Mall, children handed money
to dragon dancers of the Hoa Lan Dragon Dance team from Leuzinger
High School in Lawndale, a group of about 20 dancers who performed in
front of shops to drive out evil spirits.</TE>
<TE>   Christina Luong, 28, of Santa Ana watched with pride as her
2-year-old son, Ryan Pham, took in the festive dance.</TE>
<TE>   "He was born in the United States, so I wanted to remind him of
our New Year's," said Luong, who dressed her son in traditional red
and blue ao dai (a traditional outfit) and a headdress with a long
hair braid.</TE>
<TE>   Many in Little Saigon went from temple to temple to pray, bringing
along fruit offerings and donations.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm hoping for success, happiness and peace around the world,"
said Lien Nguyen, 45, an assembler from Garden Grove.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese Americans typically celebrate the start of the Lunar New
Year spending time with their families, though some attended larger
and more formal gathering in Chinatowns in Los Angeles and Monterey
Park.</TE>
<TE>   "It's much more symbolic over here because it's a tradition that
people want to keep as their custom," said Bill Chang, chairman of
the South Coast Chinese Cultural Association in Irvine. "They want
their kids to know."</TE>

<HD>Deputies on Airport Duty Struck, Injured by Cars</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two Orange County sheriff's deputies were injured Tuesday when a
driver apparently lost control of a rented car and plowed into a line
of vehicles as the deputies were making security checks at John Wayne
Airport, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Sammy Black, a 22-year-veteran, had both legs broken in several
places. Christopher Hancock, who has been with the department two
years, had cuts and bruises, officials said. Both were taken to
Western Medical Center-Santa Ana, where Hancock was expected to be
released late Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The deputies were searching the trunks of rental cars lined up
single file to be returned about 9:45 a.m. when a car driven by
George Mack of Salem, Ore., slammed into the rear vehicle, pinning
Black between two bumpers, police said. The car he was inspecting
then slid into the car in front of it, striking Hancock, who was
between them.</LD>
<TE>   The California Highway Patrol is investigating, said Jim Amormino,
a spokesman for the sheriff's department. "They want to see if there
was anything wrong with the car or if [Mack] accidentally hit the gas
instead of the brake."</TE>
<TE>   Mack, 80, on vacation with his wife, was allowed to return to
Oregon, Amormino said.</TE>

<HD>Argyros Adjusting to an Ambassador's Life</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Orange County businessman makes himself at home
in Spain. His wife agreed to change her name.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO and ANN CONWAY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As they move from laid-back Southern California to the precise royal
protocol of Madrid's Plaza Mayor, George Argyros and his wife are
learning that an ambassador's life requires certain trade-offs.</LD>
<LD>   Now that he is the U.S. ambassador to Spain, he has had to give up
his 6 a.m. runs around Balboa Island.</LD>
<LD>   Gone too are those unaccompanied drives to work from his bay-front
house on exclusive Harbor Island. Home is now a four-bedroom suite on
the second floor of the ambassador's residence adjacent to the U.S.
Embassy, where Argyros walks to work through a tunnel.</LD>
<TE>   Instead of yachts bobbing outside the front door of his home,
there are tanks--two of them. And forget about the days of casually
popping out for lunch at Antonello, the Ritz or Pascal. In Madrid,
Argyros is accompanied by a security contingent whenever he leaves
the grounds.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing that's the same in George's life is that he wakes
up in the morning and goes to sleep at night--and even that's in a
different time zone," said longtime friend and associate Bruce
Nestande.</TE>
<TE>   Judie Argyros has had to make an even more dramatic adjustment:
She changed her name.</TE>
<TE>   Argyros' wife of 39 years has always gone by Judie. But in
November, a language teacher noted during preparation for the
couple's move to Spain that Spanish speakers pronounce the J as an H.</TE>
<TE>   That would mean that "Judie" would become, phonetically,
"Hoo-dee-ay."</TE>
<TE>   "That didn't sound very diplomatic to me," she said. "So I decided
to go back to my birth name, Julianne, and go by Julia."</TE>
<TE>   George Argyros--dressed in tuxedo and tails, and transported by
horse-drawn carriage--presented his credentials Dec. 12 to King Juan
Carlos during a formal ceremony with no visitors allowed.</TE>
<TE>   Then it was back to Orange County for the holidays before
officially moving into the ambassador's residence last month.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never been so busy," Argyros said. "It's a full-time
charge."</TE>
<TE>   His workday starts at 9 a.m. with courtesy calls by visiting
dignitaries, government ministers and guests, with meetings scheduled
every hour, according to aide Wendy Cantor, who moved from Orange
County with the Argyroses. Three days a week, the Argyroses attend
Spanish class.</TE>
<TE>   The midday break starts at 2 p.m. for lunch; meetings continue
through the late afternoon, followed by evening copitas, or
receptions. Dinner events begin at 9:30 p.m. or later.</TE>
<TE>   "He's on California time and on Spanish time," Cantor said.</TE>
<TE>   But perhaps the one aspect of Spanish life that has taken the most
adjusting to, Argyros said, is the daily siesta.</TE>
<TE>   Even though some areas are slowly shedding the traditional
three-hour midday break, most of Spain still operates from 10 a.m. to
2 p.m., then from 5 to 9 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't eat until 11 o'clock at night," he said. "It's a real
adjustment that Judie and I are going through."</TE>
<TE>   "We've tried to adjust our schedule so we can sleep, but so far it
hasn't worked," Julia Argyros said.</TE>
<TE>   The embassy residence is where the couple do their entertaining,
aided by a staff of 14. There are two large reception halls, a dining
room that seats 40 and a commercial kitchen on the first floor.
Caterers are brought in only if the reception is for more than 600
people, said Julia Argyros, who oversees the receptions, dinners and
embassy visits.</TE>
<TE>   They haven't entirely escaped Southern California's Hollywood
connection, though. The Argyroses recently lunched with Tom Cruise,
who was in Madrid to attend the premiere of "Vanilla Sky" the
following day with Spanish actress Penelope Cruz. They said Arnold
Schwarzenegger has arranged a visit this month.</TE>
<TE>   On the Argyroses' first night in Madrid, Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft
and Drug Enforcement Administration chief Asa Hutchinson were guests.
The Rev. Robert Schuller also spent an evening.</TE>
<TE>   Argyros, whose personal wealth is estimated at $1 billion, is
accustomed to a certain level of pomp and ceremony. The former owner
of Air California and the Seattle Mariners baseball team had been
chairman of the board of trustees of Chapman University since 1976
and chairman of the board of the Richard Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace.
He stepped down from both posts after being confirmed for the
ambassadorship by the U.S. Senate.</TE>
<TE>   A longtime Republican activist, Argyros led a $30-million
fund-raising campaign in California for President Bush's 2000
election. He has been one of the staunchest supporters of Orange
County's plans to build a commercial airport at the closed El Toro
Marine base.</TE>
<TE>   As ambassador, Argyros oversees about 400 employees at the U.S.
Embassy in Madrid and consulate in Barcelona. He is Bush's
representative to the Spanish king and to Prime Minister Jose Maria
Aznar, who also is president this year of the European Union.</TE>
<TE>   Security, always tight around U.S. ambassadors, has increased
since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The tanks in front of the
residence are a constant reminder, as are the two security details
that, however unobtrusively, guard Argyros when he travels.</TE>
<TE>   "It takes some getting used to," he said.</TE>
<TE>   One of Argyros' most active roles--and the most traditional--is
that of chief cheerleader for improving trade relations with Spain,
which has a trade deficit with the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Argyros said he has been acquainting himself with trade issues and
intervening when problems arise.</TE>
<TE>   For example, he has been working to reactivate an export agreement
for Clementine oranges, or tangerines. The U.S. government suspended
imports of the fruit in December after Mediterranean fruit fly larvae
were discovered in some shipments believed to be from Spain.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, he hosted a reception to introduce himself to 300
American CEOs in Spain. More recently, the couple were among 400
guests at a reception for foreign ambassadors and Spanish diplomats
hosted by King Juan Carlos and Queen Sophia.</TE>
<TE>   "Spain has more influence and history and investment in the
Western Hemisphere than any other country in Europe," Argyros said.</TE>
<TE>   "I've gone to charm school for two weeks, but you don't appreciate
all that you get into until you get there," he said. "It's much
different than anyone can imagine."</TE>

<HD>O.C. Tollway's Chair Calls for Review</HD>
<DH>Transit: Head of San Joaquin Hills' board seeks an
independent financial analysis of the troubled turnpike.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The board chairwoman of the San Joaquin Hills toll road on Tuesday
called for an independent financial analysis of the west Orange
County turnpike, which has fallen short of revenue projections since
it opened in 1996.</LD>
<LD>   Linda Lindholm, also a Laguna Niguel council member, said she will
ask the tollway's board of directors Thursday to consider hiring a
consultant to evaluate the road's economic problems and possible
solutions.</LD>
<LD>   "It's absolutely time to have another set of eyes look at this,"
said Lindholm, the board's new chairwoman. "We need to decide on a
direction for the next 20 years, and before things get to a critical
state."</LD>
<TE>   Lindholm said she was concerned about the turnpike's chronic
failure to meet its traffic forecasts and last week's decision by a
Wall Street ratings agency to downgrade more than $1 billion in toll
road bonds to junk status.</TE>
<TE>   The San Joaquin Hills tollway, which runs from Newport Beach to
just north of San Juan Capistrano, is part of a 51-mile network of
toll roads operated by the Transportation Corridor Agencies in
Irvine. The other tollways are the Foothill, the Eastern and a small
part of California 133.</TE>
<TE>   Wilbur Smith &amp; Associates, the traffic consultant for the San
Joaquin Hills tollway, had predicted that the road would have almost
94,500 riders a day within the first year of opening.</TE>
<TE>   But TCA records show that as of December 2001, the road has never
had more than 72,000 toll-paying motorists a day and continues to
fall below revised, more conservative projections made in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   The question facing corridor officials is whether the highway's
traffic volume will generate enough revenue to keep up with the
road's escalating bond payments. The debt service is expected to grow
from $46.7 million in January 2003 to $186 million in 2034.</TE>
<TE>   Walter D. Kreutzen, the TCA's chief executive officer, said that
by 2007 the San Joaquin Hills tollway could be in technical default
on its bonds by failing to take in $1.30 in revenue for every $1
owed.</TE>
<TE>   "The analysis that was done in the past has put us in a
challenging position," Lindholm said. "The projected increases in
ridership have been too optimistic. We're not coming close to what
they've predicted."</TE>
<TE>   Lindholm envisions hiring a transportation consulting firm that
will answer to the San Joaquin Hills board of directors, not Kreutzen
or TCA staff. She said that whoever is selected by the board will
work jointly with agency officials during the evaluation.</TE>
<TE>   If the board approves her plan, the consultant would assess the
road's financial picture and possible solutions, such as refinancing
debt and pursuing a merger of the Foothill/Eastern and the San
Joaquin Hills operations.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Telles, the TCA's communications director, said the agency's
staff is supportive of Lindholm's proposal and willing to work with
an independent consultant if one is hired. She added that Kreutzen is
scheduled to present possible refinancing options to the board
Thursday. She described the discussions as preliminary.</TE>
<TE>   County Supervisor Todd Spitzer, who sits on the tollway's board,
has echoed the call for an outside review. He says the road needs
more than gimmicky promotions to increase ridership.</TE>
<TE>   "Coupons and taking a cut of hamburger sales at McDonald's isn't
going to fix the toll road's finances," Spitzer said. "An independent
consultant will help us ask the right questions and get the proper
direction."</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer warned that merging the TCA's toll roads might not be the
right thing to do. Under that proposal, the outstanding bonds for all
the TCA turnpikes would be refinanced. Toll revenue would then be
combined to cover the debt service of the unified system.</TE>
<TE>   The Foothill and Eastern traffic forecasts were partly based on
the projected population growth of east Orange, Spitzer said. But
Irvine Co. proposals to build 12,000-plus homes in that area have
been scaled back to about 4,000-plus homes.</TE>
<TE>   "The staff has jumped on the idea of consolidation," Spitzer said.
"It might be fine at the end of the day when all is evaluated, but if
you jump on it prematurely, you could hurt the road's finances even
more."</TE>

<HD>Recovering Addicts' Perspective on Marijuana Is Far From
Hazy</HD>

<LD>At first, she was just goofin,' slouched in her chair and acting as
if she didn't really want or need to be there. Too cool for the room.</LD>
<LD>   Others had spoken, had talked about their marijuana addiction, but
18-year-old Darlene [in keeping with the spirit of anonymity at the
meeting, I'm using different first names for participants] didn't
look like one to open up. She was at this meeting of Marijuana
Anonymous as part of a court referral and looked for all the world
like the most bored student who ever sat in a world history class.</LD>
<LD>   Toward the end of the hourlong meeting, during a slightly awkward
few moments of silence, she sensed people looking at her. "What do
you say?" she said, meaning she didn't know what was expected. "Like,
how it's been?"</LD>
<TE>   You don't have to talk if you don't want to, someone else said.</TE>
<TE>   She began. "It took me six times, in and out of jail," she said.
"I [messed] up a lot."</TE>
<TE>   She went on to say she'd stolen up to $300 from her mother on
occasion, mostly to get high. She used speed and alcohol, but as for
the others in MA, marijuana is the drug of choice.</TE>
<TE>   Darlene thinks she's turned it around. She's graduated from high
school, is about to complete her court-appointed time in a group home
and believes she'll reconcile with the father of her baby.</TE>
<TE>   By the time she had finished her few minutes of talking, she
wasn't laughing anymore. "I didn't like my life, but it wasn't drugs
that [messed] up my life. I did it. It was my choice."</TE>
<TE>   Marijuana Anonymous members meet almost every night in Orange
County. On this night, they're on the second floor of the Sister
Elizabeth Building near St. Joseph Hospital in Orange. The group
originated in Orange County more than 15 years ago and is patterned
after the 12-step program for recovering alcoholics or other addicts.</TE>
<TE>   I came because a few months ago, I wrote about an Orange County
Sheriff's Department raid on a marijuana farm. In light of what seems
to be a softening of the public's mood regarding pot use, my glib
take was to ask whether the deputies' time was well-spent.</TE>
<TE>   I won't be nearly as glib on the subject in the future. I don't
know if marijuana is addicting or not, but these people believe it
is. That's probably all that matters.</TE>
<TE>   Before the meeting, 45-year-old Jim was warming up the coffee.
"The widespread belief is that [pot smoking] is not a big deal, that
you really don't get addicted to it," he says. "We call ourselves
addicts. I say I'm in recovery and definitely was addicted. I smoked
daily for 13 years."</TE>
<TE>   Those in the group of 16 drug users who chose to talk described
lives overrun by their need to smoke pot. They talked about friends
and relatives left in their wake, about lives they thought would be
more enjoyable if they could get high.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm about to turn 14," Cleo says. "I know I'm pretty young to be
in these meetings."</TE>
<TE>   She started smoking pot when she was about 8 or 9, she says. "I
was a real pot head back then. I could say I'm an addict, but it's
taken me a long time to say whether I'm an addict or not. I'm only
14. What does a 14-year-old know? But I started smoking at 8 and did
it all the way to 14. That's a long time. Normal kids don't do that."
She concluded by thanking everyone in the room for supporting her.</TE>
<TE>   Gloria, 17, has been coming to MA for 18 months. Her first drug
arrest, she says, was at 10. She experimented with heroin at 11. "Now
I'm clean," she says. "I think how stupid I was."</TE>
<TE>   Many of us play down pot-smoking. Many people have smoked it for
years, without apparent disabling effects. While we smile knowingly
as well-known figures like singer Willie Nelson talk about his
recreational use, we probably should also remember those who have
lost themselves in the haze of pot smoke.</TE>
<TE>   "This meeting works," Gloria told the first-time attendees. "You
find friends here. You find honesty here. You find out who you really
are."</TE>

<HD>Irvine to Study Its Power</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hoping to avoid rolling blackouts and high electricity costs like
those of last year's energy crisis, Irvine officials said Tuesday
they will consider forming a municipal utility to serve the city's
143,000 residents and businesses.</LD>
<LD>   During the peak of the power crunch, Irvine was sometimes in the
dark several times a week.</LD>
<LD>   "For a while, it was happening every couple of days, if not
daily," Mayor Larry Agran said. "The blackouts would be brief, but
the uncertainty of it all created havoc. If we were to have our own
utility, presumably through contracts or other partnership
arrangements, we would have an adequate, affordable source of
electricity so we would avoid that happening again."</LD>
<TE>   The City Council voted unanimously to hire a consultant who would
study the options and costs of getting into the electricity business.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim, Burbank, Pasadena and Colton are among 38 California
cities that manage their own electricity supply. Another 18 besides
Irvine are considering doing so, Irvine City Manager Allison Hart
said.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest advantage is local control, said Jerry Jordan,
executive director of the California Municipal Utilities Assn. Cities
no longer have to rely on regional utilities such as Southern
California Edison for their power and may shop for the lowest rates
or create partnerships with other cities to build or manage power
plants.</TE>
<TE>   But setting up an independent utility can cost millions and would
be complicated. John Phillips, a member of the California Energy
Coalition, told the council that Irvine "needs to continue to
investigate ways that residents can best be served, and I don't
believe a municipal utility is the best way to do that. I can't think
of a more difficult endeavor."</TE>
<TE>   The city would have to buy into an existing power plant or join
with other cities to build a new one.</TE>

<HD>The Prisoner With the Million-Dollar Heart</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The prison inmate who got the heart transplant last month at the
prestigious Stanford Medical Center is recovering nicely, but my own
heart skipped several beats this week when I found out about the
first bill received by the state for the procedure.</LD>
<LD>   It came to $913,000.</LD>
<LD>   Stephen Green, assistant secretary of the state Youth and Adult
Correctional Agency, was almost as surprised as I was. The average
cost of a heart transplant in the United States is just over
$200,000.</LD>
<TE>   Green had predicted that after-care costs could run the inmate's
tab as high as $1 million over time, but no one expected this kind of
damage so soon.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, we're talking about one of the premier hospitals in
the world. As taxpayers, we got this inmate--a two-time felon serving
14 years for a robbery in Los Angeles-- the best second chance money
could buy.</TE>
<TE>   A Stanford spokeswoman told me the cost of transplants varies
widely but, due to patient confidentiality, she couldn't divulge why
this particular one broke the bank.</TE>
<TE>   The good news, Green said, is that the state won't pay the full
amount. It will try to negotiate a settlement closer to what Medicare
or Medicaid would pay. He guessed that will be somewhere between
$200,000 and $400,000.</TE>
<TE>   Green said the inmate ended up at Stanford because, although
California has a dozen or more hospitals that do heart transplants,
the state had contracts with only three. Stanford, as of the first of
this year, is no longer on the list, but UCLA and UCSF are.</TE>
<TE>   Let me repeat that if we're going to continue to lock up more
people than any other country in the world, it isn't going to be
cheap. And I think inmates deserve decent health care, whether
they've got the flu or a heart condition.</TE>
<TE>   But as the prison population ages, we're going to have more
inmates in need of organ transplants. Now would be a good time for
state officials to shop for deals at something other than the most
elite hospitals on the planet.</TE>
<TE>   Last time I wrote about this, I had another question besides why
Stanford? Why did this inmate get a new heart when more than 4,100
people were on a waiting list nationwide?</TE>
<TE>   That decision is based entirely on medical need, said officials
with the United Network for Organ Sharing, which maintains the list
for the federal government. Social standing should not be a
consideration, the network and various ethicists agreed, warning that
we're on a slippery slope if we start making moral judgments like
that. Wouldn't we be playing God?</TE>
<TE>   I appreciate the complexities behind the sentiment. But roughly 7
million people in California have no health insurance and might have
a better chance of seeing a doctor if they were in prison.</TE>
<TE>   What moral imperative says we should care more about the health of
160,000 inmates than of uninsured people, one-quarter of whom are
children?</TE>
<TE>   As for all this righteousness about equal treatment of everyone on
the organ recipient waiting list, someone is playing God in
determining who gets on the list in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   If you've got no insurance and no money, you might not make the
cut. The inmate was a good candidate because the state was on the
hook for his bills.</TE>
<TE>   Anne Paschke of the United Network for Organ Sharing said the
network offers people referrals to organizations that can help raise
money. But, she said, "Some people do fall through the cracks."</TE>
<TE>   Frank Salgado, 41, was one of them. He grew up in San Diego,
started a physical therapy business in Las Vegas with his wife, and
raised two sons.</TE>
<TE>   A year and a half ago, he was diagnosed with congestive heart
failure, and, after the first medical procedure, his health insurance
company dumped him and his entire family.</TE>
<TE>   His doctors at UCLA told him he wouldn't survive without a new
heart, but with no insurance, getting onto the national waiting list
for a transplant was a six-figure problem.</TE>
<TE>   "They said I had to raise $150,000 as a down payment," says
Salgado, who didn't have anywhere near that kind of cash.</TE>
<TE>   Salgado did everything but mortgage his house, wiping himself out
for a chance to salvage his life. Friends and church groups threw
fund-raisers, and finally he scraped together the $150,000 that put
him on the list. He wears a beeper now, waiting for the call.</TE>
<TE>   Did the California inmate get the heart that could have saved
Salgado's life, and, if so, are you as comfortable with it as the
ethicists claim you should be?</TE>
<TE>   "I've tried to be a good husband and father, a good person in the
community. I paid my taxes. I worked in a profession that helps
people. My insurance cancels me, and it's a tremendous amount of
money that I don't have," Salgado says.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had patients who came to my office after being in this
country two months. They can't speak English, but they get Medicare
because they're over 65. It makes no sense to me. Prisoners get
health care and I can't. Something's wrong with that picture."</TE>
<TE>   The problem isn't that inmates get medical coverage, but that
people on the outside have to wage battle for decent care. And so the
average Joe, who's getting squeezed by his chintzy HMO, has
palpitations when he opens the paper to see that he just bought a
Stanford heart transplant for a con.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe, after all the hand wringing about ethics and morality,
we're left with one more argument for universal health care. If you
happen to get sick, like Frank Salgado, it shouldn't bankrupt your
family.</TE>
<TE>   One last thing. About 80,000 people are on the waiting list for
hearts, kidneys and other organs. On average, 16 people die each day
before getting the call that could save their lives.</TE>

<HD>Safety Check Ordered for Highway</HD>
<DH>Ventura County: A panel is created to look into reducing
accidents on a semirural two-lane road near Camarillo.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Concerned that traffic has increased to dangerously high levels,
Ventura County supervisors Tuesday created a panel to look into ways
to improve safety along Santa Rosa Road near Camarillo.</LD>
<LD>   The action comes two months after a 14-year-old Camarillo honor
student was struck and killed as she jogged along the two-lane
stretch with her father.</LD>
<LD>   Residents of Santa Rosa Valley said creation of the group, made up
of local homeowners and government representatives, is a good first
step in correcting problems along the six-mile corridor that connects
Moorpark and Thousand Oaks with Camarillo.</LD>
<TE>   "We've got a major thoroughfare going right through a residential
area," said Ruth Means, president of the Santa Rosa Valley Community
Homeowners Assn. "Safety is our main concern."</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, a county transportation manager outlined ways traffic
can be slowed to the posted 55 mph limit or lower.</TE>
<TE>   The county could install a "roundabout" that would slow motorists
as they circulate around a central island, said Butch Britt, a
transportation deputy director. Narrower lanes, landscaped medians,
radar speed trailers and cautionary signs are also options with
widely varying costs, Britt said.</TE>
<TE>   Britt said county studies show traffic trips have increased from
5,000 per day in the 1970s to 25,000 per day last year. Nevertheless,
he said, accidents have remained relatively low and motorists drive
at an average 58 mph, just three miles over the posted limit.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have an overly unsafe road on Santa Rosa Road," Britt
told supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Frank Schillo disputed Britt's figures, saying he had
done his own study and found a higher number of accidents than the
county reported. Schillo, whose district includes a portion of Santa
Rosa Valley, said he also is concerned about local residents' ability
to turn onto the highway from side streets.</TE>
<TE>   "They are putting their lives in danger trying to get out on that
road," Schillo said.</TE>
<TE>   Britt did not make specific recommendations on which techniques
would be most effective. But he indicated one strategy that has
worked well in Camarillo could also be applied to Santa Rosa Road.</TE>
<TE>   Camarillo was able to get motorists to drive about 45 mph on Las
Posas Road by narrowing lane widths and installing landscaped
medians, he said. Widening the corridor to four lanes would also
improve safety, Britt said.</TE>
<TE>   Those combined improvements would cost about $18.7 million, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Rosa residents, however, have indicated they will not
support any move to widen the two-lane road. Residents fear doing so

<LD>On the longest day of the Olympics for skiers, boyhood friends from
Norway, Lasse Kjus and Kjetil Andre Aamodt, could finish 1-2 in the
men's combined. It wouldn't be the first time. They finished 1-2
eight years ago in Lillehammer, with Kjus winning the gold. He won
silver four years ago in Nagano and has five Olympic and world medals
in the event. But Aamodt is reigning world champion.</LD>
<LD>   They might be pushed by American Bode Miller, who has been one of
the world's best slalom skiers this season. But he suffers in the
downhill. He finished second to Aamodt in a recent World Cup
competition without going into a downhill crouch because it would
have been too tiring. The competition includes one downhill and two
slaloms, skied within a six-hour period at Snowbasin.</LD>

<HD>Estonia Wins First Winter Medals</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIDWAY, Utah</DL>
<LD>The Norwegians knew someone eventually would challenge them as the
world's elite men's cross-country team. They just didn't expect it
this soon.</LD>
<LD>   Estonia won its first Winter Olympic medals Tuesday as Andrus
Veerpalu took the gold and Jaak Mae the bronze in the men's
15-kilometer classic-style cross-country race. Norway's Frode Estil
got the silver.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a great, great success for Estonia," Veerpalu said. "I
feel very proud."</LD>
<TE>   American John Bauer finished 12th, the best U.S. cross-country
showing since Bill Koch won the silver in a 30K race at the 1976
Innsbruck Games.</TE>
<TE>   Bente Skari won Norway's third gold of the Games in the women's
10K classical, finishing ahead of Russians Olga Danilova and Julija
Tchepalova.</TE>
<TE>   While Skari's victory was hardly a surprise, the performance of
her male countrymen has been. Estil's silver is only the second medal
for Norway in four races, well off the pace of its goal--10 medals in
12 cross-country events.</TE>
<TE>   Johann Muehlegg, a German racing for Spain, won Saturday's 30K
freestyle race, and the best the Norwegians could do was fourth.</TE>
<TE>   At the Nordic world championships in Finland almost a year ago,
Veerpalu won a 30K race by just two-tenths of a second over Estil.
Afterward, Estil said the victory--Estonia's first-ever world
title--was good for the sport.</TE>
<TE>   "Norway has so many gold medals," Estil said at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Estil didn't feel any different after Veerpalu beat him again.</TE>
<TE>   "Norway has dominated this sport in the last 10 years, so I think
it's important for this sport that other nations win, too," he said.
"But I hope there soon will be some gold medals for Norway, too."</TE>
<TE>   Norway won four cross-country golds in Nagano on the men's side
alone, but three belonged to Bjorn Daehlie, who retired.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Veerpalu, Skari was behind most of the way in the women's
race until she made a late surge to win her first gold medal.</TE>
<TE>   She finished in 28 minutes 5.6 seconds, pumping her arms hard over
the final 100 meters to cross the finish line 2.5 seconds faster than
Danilova.</TE>

<HD>Mayer Rocks; Moseley Rolls</HD>
<DH>1998 winner's latest trick pleases the fans, not judges.
U.S. teammate takes silver, behind Finland's Lahtela.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DEER VALLEY, Utah</DL>
<LD>Jonny Moseley completed his new signature trick, the Dinner Roll,
much to the delight of the raucous, flag-waving crowd who came to
watch the men's freestyle skiing moguls competition Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Just about the only folks he didn't overwhelm, it seems, were the
judges.</LD>
<LD>   Although he temporarily stole the show with his new move, Moseley,
26, won't know the spotlight at these Games of standing on the medals
podium.</LD>
<TE>   Janne Lahtela of Finland, solid and fast if not innovative, won
the gold; Travis Mayer of Steamboat Springs, Colo., took the silver;
and Richard Gay of France got the bronze.</TE>
<TE>   As for the empty-handed Moseley, don't feel too bad. The 1998
Olympic gold medalist pronounced himself "super-satisfied" with his
effort, adding that it was his goal to "come out here and put on a
good show."</TE>
<TE>   That he did. And if American fans were disappointed that his
effort wasn't rewarded with a medal, perhaps they derived some
consolation from Mayer's silver medal. Doesn't everyone love an
underdog?</TE>
<TE>   Only a couple of months ago, the 19-year-old on leave from Cornell
University wasn't even among the best mogul skiers on the U.S. team.
"I didn't expect this to happen," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mayer's score of 27.59 placed him comfortably in front of Gay, at
26.91, and bested all but Lahtela, a four-time Olympian who is known
more for being technically precise than for being fancy.</TE>
<TE>   Lahtela's winning mark of 27.97 was accomplished because he was
smooth and fast, if not particularly scintillating with his
acrobatics. "The Olympic Games--for me, it's not about trying
something new," Lahtela said. "You don't train really hard for four
years, go to the Olympics and see if it will happen."</TE>
<TE>   One Dinner Roll, he correctly reasoned, does not an Olympic
victory banquet make. Half of the scoring is based on a skier's
ability to keep a tight, close line downhill. The other half is split
between time and two aerial moves.</TE>
<TE>   Therefore, the Dinner Roll--two full spins with the body nearly
parallel to the ground--accounted for only 121/2% of Moseley's score,
which was 26.78. So though it might be fun and exciting, "It takes a
lot more than one jump to win the contest," Lahtela said.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Moseley's time of 28.56 seconds down the course was
third-slowest of the 16 finalists.</TE>
<TE>   This, of course, was not a justifiable excuse for him not
medaling, according to his many fans.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not the '70s anymore," said Charlotte Moats, 21, of Salt
Lake City. "If the crowd is on its feet, I don't understand how the
judges don't understand that."</TE>
<TE>   None of the 29 other athletes competing tried anything remotely as
innovative as Moseley's move. Their tricks--aerial maneuvers from
ramps placed between fields of moguls--came from a now-standard
repertoire: spinning once around while flying or twisting the skis
back and forth three or four times while in the air.</TE>
<TE>   The last time Moseley introduced something new at the Olympics,
his "360 Mute Grab"--grasping an inside ski while doing a full spin
with his skis crossed--at Nagano, Japan, helped him win the gold
medal.</TE>
<TE>   It also made him a celebrity. Back then, his life was so hectic
that it took him an entire day to find the time to place a return
call to President Clinton, who wanted to congratulate him.</TE>
<TE>   And to that end, Moseley remains an A-list celebrity, fourth place
and all.</TE>
<TE>   NBC has announced that Moseley will guest host "Saturday Night
Live" on March 2.</TE>
<TE>   So what will he do on national TV? Moseley was asked after
Tuesday's race. "Have fun, that's for sure," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Jeremy Bloom, a 19-year-old University of Colorado football player
from Loveland, Colo., took ninth. A wide receiver who redshirted in
football last season so he could ski, he came into the Games leading
the World Cup moguls tour. "I messed up today," he said after
Tuesday's race.</TE>
<TE>   The other American, Evan Dybvig of Tunbridge, Vt., was unable to
compete after injuring his right knee when he crashed during a
qualifying run.</TE>

<LD>"Have fun in Salt Lake City!"</LD>
<LD>   Close friends and family members actually used those words before
the great send-off into the heart of dullness, into the land of
buttoned-up Mormons, watered-down beer and carrot-topped lime green
Jell-O.</LD>
<LD>   They meant well enough, I suppose, although the words carried the
same sort of smirking undertone you notice when someone advises,
"Don't do anything I wouldn't do."</LD>
<TE>   That commandment, by the way, has been broken. I've already done
something they wouldn't do.</TE>
<TE>   I am here. And they aren't.</TE>
<TE>   Have fun in Salt Lake City? Sure, it's somewhat easier now, with
the Olympics in town. That's one way to improve the night life. You
could drop the Olympics into a cow pasture and for three weeks, and
that cow pasture would be rocking. (You should have seen Dave
Matthews at the Medals Plaza the other night. Layered with sweaters
and fingerless gloves, his breath forming massive clouds over his
head, he looked fully prepared for the cow pasture--and probably
thinking about using his guitar for kindling.)</TE>
<TE>   That's why Salt Lake City spent millions of dollars, many of them
in the form of bribes, and risked international scandal and shame to
bring the Winter Games here. It was to give the residents something
to do.</TE>
<TE>   But take away the five Olympic rings and Ross Powers reaching
cruising altitude on the halfpipe and the Foo Fighters and what are
you left with? "Denver, without the charm," says one veteran Olympics
writer.</TE>
<TE>   A few years back, an independent film called "SLC Punk" did a good
job of chronicling the condition. The story involves a young punk
named Stevo who starts a (very small) punk-rock scene in Salt Lake
City, banging his head against the boredom, the blandness and the
bleakness.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing going on," Stevo says in the movie. "That's what
I saw when I looked out over the city. Nothing. How the Mormon
settlers looked upon this valley and felt it was the promised land is
beyond me. I don't know, maybe it looked different back then."</TE>
<TE>   I went down into the valley more than a week ago, arriving the
Monday before the opening ceremony. Monday in Salt Lake City. Long
Monday. Big Monday.</TE>
<TE>   As in Wyoming at Utah, college basketball at the Huntsman Center.
That sounded as if it might be fun. Tip-off was scheduled for 10:03
p.m. That would get me to midnight. One day down, 20 to go.</TE>
<TE>   Huntsman Center was rocking with excitement at a quarter to 10. A
couple of visitors joked about the crowd being up way past its
bedtime, but that's Myth No. 1 about Salt Lakers: They are not all
early-to-bed homebodies. They will stay up for Rick Majerus and the
Runnin' Utes, who before this game held the nation's longest winning
streak at 13 and had won 48 consecutive conference games at home.</TE>
<TE>   Especially when the opponent is Wyoming, second in the Mountain
West Conference.</TE>
<TE>   Especially when they are giving away plastic ice scrapers at the
door.</TE>
<TE>   The turnstile count pushed 13,000 for this one. It was a typical
big-game college crowd, if a little more polite than most, at least
until there was a break in the action.</TE>
<TE>   During one timeout, the Utah mascot, a guy in a red-tail hawk
outfit, readied himself for the standard
off-the-trampoline-and-over-the-rim monster-dunk bit--except his
takeoff was interrupted by another guy in a giant half-man,
half-inflatable crash-test dummy costume, the mascot for nearby Rocky
Mountain Raceway. The hawk crashed into crash-test dummy. The
crash-test dummy was leveled. The crowd went wild.</TE>
<TE>   During another timeout, the hawk pulled on a black vest, tied a
black bandanna around his head and began break-dancing at midcourt.
At Huntsman Center, this passes for cutting-edge hip-hop culture. The
crowd went wild again.</TE>
<TE>   At halftime, the public-address announcer informed the arena that
"We have a special guest moseying out to center court." It's Utah
football coach Ron McBride, brandishing the Las Vegas Bowl trophy, a
memento of December's 10-6 victory over USC.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd greeted McBride with a rousing standing ovation as the
announcer yells into his microphone:</TE>
<TE>   "Thanks for bringing home the trophy to ... UTAH!"</TE>
<TE>   The excitement, however, began to ebb in the second half as the
Utes, undermanned on the front line and unable to withstand Wyoming's
inside pounding, fell behind and began casting away desperate
jumpers. The Utes shot 11.5% from the field in the second half. The
crowd went quiet.</TE>
<TE>   To pass the time between Utah baskets, I began flipping through
the game program and landed on the lyrics for the Utes' somewhat
gender-exclusive fight song, "Utah Man."</TE>
<TE>   "I am a Utah man, sir, and I live across the green.</TE>
<TE>   Our gang, it is the jolliest that you have ever seen.</TE>
<TE>   Our coeds are the fairest and each one's a shining star.</TE>
<TE>   Our yell, you hear it ringing through the mountains near and far."</TE>
<TE>   Utah lost, 54-46. Afterward, Majerus, a couple of reporters and a
few friends gathered at Dee's, a local hangout noted for its
round-the-clock breakfast. Majerus' gang, it was not the jolliest you
have ever seen.</TE>
<TE>   Breakfast with Majerus. On paper, it sounded like fun. But not
this time, not when the paper is a depressing, distressing stat sheet
that leaves Majerus in a state of near-catatonia, rubbing his right
hand over the top of his head while muttering about defensive
breakdowns.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fun things to do while in Salt Lake City (or so we had heard):</TE>
<TE>   1. Visit the Fun Dome. "Welcome to Utah's premier entertainment
facility," says Mandy Hortin, the very cheerful employee at the
big-promise Utah Fun Dome. "This is the funnest place ever!"</TE>
<TE>   Fun in Utah is a relative term, of course. This dome offers a
video-game arcade, bowling, laser tag, miniature golf and karaoke.</TE>
<TE>   The Fun Dome, according to Hortin, "is awesome," but it is open
only two days a week, Friday and Saturday. The bowling alley has
limited hours Monday through Thursday, but the rest of the place is
shut down from Sunday through Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really not busy enough to be open more than that," Hortin
reports.</TE>
<TE>   Fun in Salt Lake. Open two days a week.</TE>
<TE>   2. Visit the Traveling Jell-O Museum. Did you know that Salt Lake
City consumes more Jell-O than any other city in the United States?
Did you know that a couple of years back, students at Brigham Young
collected more than 14,000 signatures on a petition to name Jell-O
the official state snack of Utah? Did you know that on Jan. 31, 2001,
after being lobbied by Bill Cosby, the Utah State Legislature voted
to approve the petition?</TE>
<TE>   You will find the information, along with plastic Jell-O spoons
with pictures of Wayne Gretzky and Patrick Roy on the handles, at the
Traveling Jell-O Museum, now doing time at the ZCMI Center Mall in
downtown Salt Lake.</TE>
<TE>   Or you can attend a book signing for "Jell-O: A Biography" at the
Borders across the street and ask the author herself: What's the deal
with Salt Lake City and lime-green gelatin?</TE>
<TE>   "You start with the fact that there are a lot of large families
here," Carolyn Wyman says, "and Jell-O is cheap, so you can feed a
lot of kids. Also, there's a high percentage of teetotalers in Salt
Lake City. If you don't drink, you have to have a vice. Here, it's
sugar."</TE>
<TE>   Amy Motta, a local resident, stops by Wyman's table. Motta is a
self-described "Jell-O collector," searching out old boxes of the
stuff, old cookbooks, molds, advertising. She proudly shows off her
green Jell-O Olympic pin.</TE>
<TE>   Motta begins reminiscing about 1999, a tough year for Salt Lake
and its favorite dessert. That was the year Des Moines passed Salt
Lake in the Jell-O consumption standings, sending a shockwave through
the marshmallow and carrot shavings community.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not embarrassed [to be No. 1], we're proud," Motta says.
"When we lost the title, it was, 'My gosh!' It was like it had been
stolen from us. 'It's rightfully ours! Let's get it back!'"</TE>
<TE>   It took a year, but Salt Lake rallied to reclaim the top spot.
Currently, the Utah Jazz is holding a "Jazz Up Your Jell-O" contest,
asking fans to "show us your most spirited picture of you dressed up
in Jazz gear, enjoying your favorite Jell-O product, for a chance at
a Grand Prize Suite for you and 23 of your closest friends."</TE>
<TE>   (Cinematic footnote: As the final credits to "SLC Punk" roll, the
soundtrack shifts to a song by the old Bay Area band the Dead
Kennedys. Lead singer's name: Jello Biafra. Nice touch.)</TE>
<TE>   3. Grunts And Posture. It has been billed as the funkiest, most
off-beat store in the city, a vintage clothing shop with a musty
smell of incense, adorned on its exterior by dozens of Jell-O
molds--of course--nailed around the doorway.</TE>
<TE>   Grunts And Postures is the place to go if you're looking for an
Austin Power chest-hair wig ($6), or a 1968-69 Women's International
Bowling Congress rulebook (bowling is big in Salt Lake), or vampire
red hair dye.</TE>
<TE>   Or a Jesus Action Figure, selling for $9.95. "We sell a ton," says
Alex Berry, a clerk at Grunts And Postures. "Around Christmas, they
flew out of here."</TE>
<TE>   4. Eat. "Green Jell-O and Red Punch: The Heinous Truth! About
Utah!" is a book title sold at Grunts And Postures--and two of the
city's culinary staples, along with ice cream and fry sauce.</TE>
<TE>   Fry sauce is a dipping sauce for French fries, developed in the
1950s by the local Arctic Circle hamburger chain. Now, most of the
local burger joints have their own version--a little ketchup mixed
with a little mayonnaise and a "secret" assortment of spices. Hires
Big H here calls it "Super Fry Sauce." In L.A., you'd call it
"Thousand Island Dressing."</TE>
<TE>   A colleague mentions a place he's heard about, supposedly Salt
Lake's answer to the "Soup Nazi" restaurant of "Seinfeld." We've been
gone awhile and starting to miss the verbal abuse of the greater Los
Angeles service industry, so we decide to stop by Big City Soup.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, there is soup and bread--no sandwiches--just like the
television show. But there are six brands of soup and two helpful
clerks behind the counter who offer free samples and smile as they
ring up your order and hand you a pre-wrapped slab of cheddar cheese
to go with your bread.</TE>
<TE>   "Seinfeld" has its Soup Nazi. Salt Lake has Soup Mormons.</TE>
<TE>   And Snelgrove Ice Cream Parlor, touted on CitySearch.com as one of
the city's best "Mormon Meet Markets," has 45 flavors, including
English Butter Toffee, German Chocolate, French Silk, Macadamia Nut
and Canadian Vanilla.</TE>
<TE>   Multiculturalism, Salt Lake style.</TE>
<TE>   5. Hoop. Basketball is an obsession across Utah, and Salt Lake
City, from the venerated Jazz to the 6 a.m. pickup games held at the
Mormon church houses. Spend some time here and it's easy to
understand why.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a team sport--Mormons tend to be very team-oriented," says
Mike Gorrell, Olympic reporter for the Salt Lake Tribune. "And it's
indoors. Every ward [Mormon church] has its own gym."</TE>
<TE>   On the college level, loyalties are fiercely divided between Utah
and BYU. "No self-respecting non-Mormon ever cheers for BYU," Gorrell
says. But the Jazz "is the one unifying force in Utah," he says.
"Everything else is broken down along religious lines.... The Jazz
transcend all the divisions. The two years they made it to the
finals, it was a wonderful time here.</TE>
<TE>   "Until the end."</TE>
<TE>   6. Have a beer at the movies. When it comes to dinner and a movie,
Salt Lake has one keg up on L.A., or just about anywhere else.
Believe it or not, Salt Lake has a place where you can order a
microbrew and a pizza or burger, sit on sofas or in theater seats
with eating trays and enjoy a meal while watching "Ali" or "Vanilla
Sky" or "Spike &amp; Mike's Sick And Twisted Animation Festival."</TE>
<TE>   Brewvies bills itself as a "cinema pub" that features all the
usual accoutrements--three pool tables, pub grub, rock videos--along
with two big screen theaters. It also sells T-shirts. "We Support
3.2% Tithing And 10% Beer" reads one. "I Went To Utah ... And All I
Got Were These Dumb Seven Wives," reads another.</TE>
<TE>   Across town, a microbrew that calls itself "Polygamy Porter" plays
off the same theme. Slogans: "Why Have Just One?" And, "Bring Some
Home To The Wives."</TE>
<TE>   You have to like a place that knows its place, and knows how to
have some fun with it.</TE>

<HD>Skating on Thin Ice? It Figures</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Randy Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>The sun rose in the east Tuesday morning. The Wasatch Mountains were
snowcapped. It was cold outside.</LD>
<LD>   There was a figure skating controversy.</LD>
<LD>   What else is new?</LD>
<TE>   I'm not sure why the Winter Olympic organizers bother with an
opening ceremony. George W. Bush wasted his breath when he declared
the Games open Friday night. Everyone knows the Games don't open
until the first skater or coach or choreographer or costume designer
or sequin supplier complains about the judges' scores.</TE>
<TE>   That occurred here Monday night during the figure skating pairs
freestyle program.</TE>
<TE>   Disclaimer: I am not a figure skating judge. I try not to even
play one in the newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   But I was at the Salt Lake Ice Center, and, if anyone had asked me
afterward which pair had won, I would have said the Canadians, Jamie
Sale and David Pelletier.</TE>
<TE>   I didn't like their music--"Love Story"--and I wasn't any more
overwhelmed by their program than when they unveiled it two years
ago. But they were virtually flawless, and it's my opinion that if
you know your limitations and skate within yourself, you should be
rewarded--provided the material isn't too simple. It's a conservative
approach, but one based on the belief that falling down in figure
skating is bad.</TE>
<TE>   When the Russians, Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze, were
revealed as the winners, I was surprised. But not very. I understood
it. They made a modest error--he stepped out of a double axel--but
their program was faster and more complex than the Canadians', and
three of the nine judges believed the Russians should be credited on
the technical mark for their ingenuity.</TE>
<TE>   Their classical presentation, to music from the opera "Thais," was
clearly superior.</TE>
<TE>   When all the scores--technical and presentation--were tallied, the
Russians won, 5-4, with presentation scores providing the difference.</TE>
<TE>   Fair enough.</TE>
<TE>   Or so I thought.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I was astonished to learn later Monday night how astonished so
many people were over the decision.</TE>
<TE>   That started with NBC's expert analysts, Scott Hamilton and Sandra
Bezic. Who am I to argue with either about figure skating? Hamilton
is an Olympic champion. Bezic is one of the sport's most respected
choreographers, credited with remaking Brian Boitano so that he could
win the gold medal in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   But, as sometimes happens to U.S. networks on election day, they
were too quick to project a winner. They awarded the gold medal to
the Canadians before they even left the ice, ignoring that one pair,
the third-place Chinese, still had to skate. If the Chinese had
landed their unprecedented throw quad salchow, the judges would have
really had a difficult decision.</TE>
<TE>   That, however, was tame compared with the reaction of Hamilton and
Bezic after the scores were in.</TE>
<TE>   They were overwrought.</TE>
<TE>   Hamilton, sounding very much like the shrieking character who
portrays him on "Saturday Night Live," demanded, "How did that
happen?"</TE>
<TE>   But instead of explaining how it could have happened, he said,
"They won that program. There's not a doubt of anyone in the place,
except maybe a few judges. That will be debated forever."</TE>
<TE>   Bezic said, "I'm embarrassed for our sport right now."</TE>
<TE>   I was embarrassed for NBC.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Are judges biased? Do some prefer athletes who were raised under
one political system to those who were raised under another? Do some
prefer certain styles over others? Have deals ever been made among
judges to favor one skater over another? Is it possible that such
deals could be made today?</TE>
<TE>   The answer to all of those questions is yes.</TE>
<TE>   Figure skating judges are susceptible to the same human failings
as everyone else. They're far from perfect.</TE>
<TE>   Conspiracy theorists, mainly among the media, speculated Tuesday
that the French judge sided with the Russians in the pairs
competition in return for a promise that the Russian and other former
Eastern Bloc judges would favor the French ice dancing team later
this week.</TE>
<TE>   The Canadian Olympic Assn., although not commenting on specific
allegations, has asked for an investigation, which the International
Skating Union has agreed to conduct.</TE>
<TE>   If officials find a plot, they should expose the judges and bar
them from the sport. It has been done before.</TE>
<TE>   But it's much more likely that the five judges who scored the
Russians higher did so because they thought the Russians were better.
It's just as likely that the judges who scored the Canadians higher
in last year's World Championships did so because they thought the
Canadians were better, even though the Canadians made an error
similar to the one the Russians made Monday night. No one called for
an investigation then.</TE>
<TE>   In calling for one Tuesday, Sally Rehorick, the head of the
Canadian delegation who, coincidentally, is a figure skating judge,
listed several areas in which Sale and Pelletier were better than the
Russians, including harmony, phrasing, continuity, rotations, spins,
lifts, landings and coverage of the ice.</TE>
<TE>   That about covers it.</TE>
<TE>   I called Irina Rodnina, a three-time Olympic pairs champion from
the former Soviet Union who now lives in Marina del Rey, and asked
which team she preferred in those elements. The Russians, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Reasonable minds can disagree--and will in figure skating.</TE>
<TE>   My favorite perspective was offered by Pelletier, who said, "Well,
this is figure skating, people, and, if I didn't want this to happen
to us, I would have skied."</TE>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>So, you've seen it on MSNBC and now you'd like to take up curling.
How does one go about that?</LD>
<LD>   Well, it might be inconvenient, but the easiest way is probably to
move to Canada, where curling clubs abound--there are about 1.2
million participants--and the sport sometimes outdraws hockey on TV.</LD>
<LD>   Don't want to leave the country? There's always the Midwest.
Curling in this country is pretty much done there, also at clubs,
although this country's number only about 130. Minnesota, Wisconsin,
Illinois, Michigan and Ohio have most of them.</LD>
<TE>   You say you want to stay home and curl in Southern California?
Good luck.</TE>
<TE>   You can try the Yellow Pages for curling clubs, but chances are
you won't find any, which leaves this as strictly a do-it-yourself
project.</TE>
<TE>   The first thing you need is a sheet of ice, 145 feet long, 15 feet
71/2 inches wide, with concentric-circle targets at either end. If
your backyard pool is long and skinny, you could try freezing it,
then painting in the targets.</TE>
<TE>   OK, assuming you've somehow got the ice sheet, you'll need proper
curling equipment--special shoes, one with a slippery sole, one with
a gripper; 42-pound granite stones with handles, and a brush broom.
The broom should be no problem, because brooms are widely available.
The rocks and shoes can be found at your nearest curling-supplies
store, which in L.A.'s case, might be in Bemidji. Hey, you're the one
who wants to curl.</TE>
<TE>   Assuming further that you've got all this stuff, you now need
proper clothing. Lots of curlers affect a Scottish look, wearing tams
and tartans, because curling is of Scottish origin, but the main
thing is to dress warm in loose clothing. This is a winter sport,
after all.</TE>
<TE>   Great, you've got your gear together, you're properly dressed,
nothing left to do but to do it. To the pool, er, ice sheet!</TE>
<TE>   Oh, no! Look, it's 80 degrees out! The ice has melted! Nuts, now
we can't curl!</TE>
<TE>   You know, much like bowling, curling has an unwritten rule: If you
don't drink, you can't curl. But there's no such rule as: If you
don't curl, you can't drink. So let's just sit here by the pool and
have a glass of Chardonnay. Maybe later, when the ice has melted,
we'll take a dip.</TE>

<HD>Dad's Arrival Cheered</HD>
<DH>Becky Wilczak may not win a medal, but her father's
presence at the finish line will be reward enough.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARRY TEMKIN</AU>
<BD>TRIBUNE OLYMPIC BUREAU</BD>
<DL>PARK CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>Tom Wilczak says he'll find a way, as he usually does, to "finagle"
his way to the finish line tonight after his daughter, Becky, makes
her fourth and final run in the women's singles luge at Utah Olympic
Park.</LD>
<LD>   No, he won't have the right credential to get there in these
security-drenched Games, but the 55-year-old River Forest, Ill.,
resident didn't seem concerned about that Tuesday, the day his
daughter made her Winter Olympics debut.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm sure there are ways," he said with a smile that stretched all
the way to Chicago, and why would anyone doubt him.</LD>
<TE>   After all, he made it to Salt Lake City despite a liver that
turned on him in 1987. Wilczak has autoimmune hepatitis and likely
needs a liver transplant within months to survive.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday he was feeling just fine, a little weak as usual, but just
fine. "This is Becky's dream, to make the Olympics," he said. "For me
to be here is just phenomenal.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't tell you how much this means to me."</TE>
<TE>   An hour later, he watched on TV in a tent above the finish line as
Becky made the first of her two Tuesday runs. He watched as two solid
efforts gave her a total time of 1:26.990 and fourth place.</TE>
<TE>   That's probably the best he or she could hope for. As expected,
the German team dominated, with Sylke Otto, Barbara Niedernhuber and
Silke Kraushaar placing 1-2-3.</TE>
<TE>   Otto finished in 1:26.432. Niedernhuber, Kraushaar and Wilczak
trailed her by .048, .086 and .558 seconds, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Barring a major German miscue, Becky won't win a medal. Her father
didn't seem to care. .</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't make any difference as long as I'm there to hug her at
the end," he said.</TE>
<TE>   That's where the hugs always come when Becky is racing, and her
dad didn't expect to see her until then.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just our rule," he said, explaining that he didn't want to
"jinx" his daughter. "It's after the last run."</TE>
<TE>   Tom Wilczak wasn't really sure he'd make it to the Games until his
plane landed Monday night in Salt Lake City. There was the matter of
his health--he had 21/2 gallons of fluid drained from his stomach
area Monday--and the fact a suitable liver could become available
while he was at the Games, even though he'll return home Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   His doctor put his mind at rest about the first issue. "He said
you can be just as sick there as here," Wilczak said.</TE>
<TE>   After that he probably was coming regardless, but the Salt Lake
Organizing Committee put his mind at rest last Thursday when it
offered a private jet to whisk him home if necessary.</TE>
<TE>   That was a relief for father and daughter. "I'm happy he's here,"
Becky said after her second run. "For 10 years he's supported me."</TE>
<TE>   Now about all that could go wrong ... or right ... would be if a
suitable liver became available before Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll consider that when we get the call," Wilczak said. "It will
be a real tough one if it's tomorrow morning."</TE>
<TE>   Wilczak's illness has been difficult for his family because
training and competition take Becky away from home for months at a
time.</TE>
<TE>   She calls home frequently and gets so worried when no one answers
that Tom and his wife, Della, change their answering machine message
to alert her.</TE>
<TE>   That reflects the close relationship father and daughter share,
Della Wilczak said. Tom was the one, she said, who used to pull Becky
out of school for an opening-day baseball game and the one who'd take
her to see the Christmas windows in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   And until illness prevented it, he would attend all of Becky's
major races in the U.S. and as many overseas contests as he could.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so happy he'll get to watch Becky," Della Wilczak said,
"because this is his dream too."</TE>

<TE>   A volunteer track sweeper lost part of his index finger Tuesday
night trying to catch an out-of-control luge sled.</TE>
<TE>   Venezuelan Iginia Boccalandro lost control of her sled near the
end of the first heat. She glanced off one wall, flew back across the
track and slammed the other wall as she continued to careen down the
ice.</TE>
<TE>   Boccalandro landed face-down on the track and slid headfirst for
over 30 yards, her racing suit in tatters as she lay motionless. As
track personnel rushed to assist, her sled turned around and was
headed back toward her.</TE>
<TE>   Just before the 50-pound sled reached Boccalandro, volunteer Drake
Self tried to grab it. The sled flipped over and sliced off the tip
of his index finger just below the fingernail.</TE>
<TE>   Boccalandro was not seriously injured. She was disqualified for
not completing the run.</TE>

<HD>Goebel Feeling Fine in Third Place</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Tim Goebel's pursuit of an Olympic figure skating gold medal began in
earnest Tuesday with a splendid performance that left him in third
place after the first phase of the men's competition.</LD>
<LD>   But for world champion Evgeny Plushenko of Russia, the pursuit of
gold ended when he fell in a heap of silver spandex at the Salt Lake
Ice Center.</LD>
<LD>   Goebel, who trains in El Segundo, performed an animated and
forceful short program Tuesday to put himself in medal contention
behind Alexei Yagudin of Russia and Takeshi Honda of Japan. But
Plushenko took a shocking tumble on the first element of his
routine--a planned quadruple-triple jump combination--leaving him
fourth and all but ending his much-anticipated battle with Yagudin.</LD>
<TE>   "The Olympic Games is over," said Alexei Mishin, Plushenko's
coach. "Why? Probably pressure."</TE>
<TE>   Goebel thrived under pressure, becoming the first skater to land a
quadruple salchow in the Olympics with a quad salchow-triple toe loop
combination near the start of his "Danse Macabre" routine. The
21-year-old native of Rolling Meadows, Ill., can fulfill his Olympic
dream Thursday, when the men perform their long programs.</TE>
<TE>   "I was absolutely thrilled," said Goebel, who opened his arms to
embrace the crowd of 16,234. "I've never gotten a crowd response like
that. It was amazing to skate the way I did and have all my family
and my teammates here."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Weiss of the U.S. acquitted himself well but was unlucky
enough to draw the first skating position, when judges are
conservative and leave room to reward subsequent performances. But
six-time U.S. champion Todd Eldredge, back for a third Olympic
appearance in search of the great performance that has eluded him, is
still seeking that great moment.</TE>
<TE>   Eldredge gambled by attempting a quadruple toe loop-double toe
loop combination, which he has only recently landed with regularity.
He two-footed the landing of the first part but stayed upright--only
to fall on his next jump, a triple axel. When the ice chips settled,
Eldredge was ninth, one spot behind Weiss.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, I went for it," said Eldredge, who was 10th at the 1992
Albertville Games and fourth at the 1998 Nagano Games. "Quite
honestly, the quad wasn't the problem. The triple axel was. I felt
great. Practice had been going great.... I thought I would be more
upset, quite honestly. Coming back [after a two-year sabbatical], and
all the success I've had, six titles, that's pretty darn good."</TE>
<TE>   Alexander Abt of Russia, who trains at Lake Arrowhead, is fifth.
Two-time Olympic silver medalist Elvis Stojko, continuing Canada's
bad luck on the ice, was hammered on his technical marks after he
stepped out of the first part of his quad toe-triple toe combination
and was seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Yagudin was a dynamo as he skated to "Winter." His footwork was
nimble, his spins fast and his jumping strong. He opened with a quad
toe-triple toe combination and earned a standing ovation for his
2-minute, 40-second routine.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a little bit nervous," said Yagudin, who was ranked first
by all nine judges. His technical marks included one 5.7 and one 5.9;
his presentation marks were all 5.8s and 5.9s. "It was really hard to
even start the program because I couldn't feel my legs."</TE>
<TE>   Honda, who trains in Toronto under Stojko's former coach, Doug
Leigh, was ranked second by five judges. He also opened with a quad
toe-triple toe combination.</TE>
<TE>   Although Goebel can earn a medal in Thursday's long program, which
is worth two-thirds of the final score, he's almost afraid to tempt
fate and believe it's possible.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't been thinking about a medal since I got here," he said.
"I've had some great run-throughs of my long program in training, and
if I skate 90% as well as I skated [Tuesday] I'll be happy."</TE>

<HD>Miller Looks to Zig In</HD>
<DH>The U.S. skier excels in the slalom; it might help him beat
the favorites in the men's combined.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SNOWBASIN, Utah</DL>
<LD>Bode Mil- ler begins his legitimate quest today, weather always
permitting, to become the first American Alpine skier to win three
medals in the same Olympics when he competes in the men's combined
event.</LD>
<LD>   Miller, who will be one of the medal favorites next week in the
giant slalom and slalom, has been somewhat overlooked in the
combined, in which the times of a shortened downhill race and two
slaloms are added for a result.</LD>
<LD>   Because he is so much better than the field in slalom, however,
there are some who think Miller has a chance of wresting the gold
medal from favorites Kjetil Andre Aamodt and Lasse Kjus of Norway.</LD>
<TE>   Miller's chances are tied to staying within striking distance of
combined stalwarts Aamodt and Kjus in the downhill.</TE>
<TE>   Miller doesn't do much speed racing yet managed to stay within
2.12 seconds of Aamodt in the first downhill training run.</TE>
<TE>   This is significant because in his last two World Cup slalom wins,
Miller beat Aamodt by 2.96 seconds in one race and 3.29 in the other.</TE>
<TE>   "A month ago, I thought you can't beat Aamodt and it would be
tough to beat Kjus," Steve Porino, a reporter for Ski Racing magazine
who is doing Alpine commentary for NBC during the Olympics, said.
"Now, I think Aamodt will have a harder time beating Bode."</TE>
<TE>   It is also bodes well for Miller that Kjus, the 1994 Olympic
champion in combined, has not posted a result in his last three
slaloms, skiing out in one race and failing to qualify for a second
run in the two other races.</TE>
<TE>   Kjus and Aamodt finished 1-2 in the Olympic combined at the 1994
Lillehammer Games and have dominated the event since.</TE>
<TE>   When asked this week to describe the perfect combined skier,
Miller responded without hesitation.</TE>
<TE>   "Aamodt," he said. "He's one of two guys who's finished every
slalom this year, and he's been in the top 30 in every slalom, which
is necessary. And he's got the speed and the confidence to push the
line in downhill.</TE>
<TE>   "To try to compete with someone like that you have to have
something going for you. Something special. And right now, that is
slalom for me. I can ski a line and an aggressive approach right now
that no one can match."</TE>
<TE>   Miller has raced in only two World Cup downhills this year, at Val
d'Isere, France, and Wengen, Switzerland, and the U.S. team seems
more interested in letting Miller concentrate on technical events.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, at age 23, Miller is talented enough to emerge as an
all-event skier in all four Alpine disciplines: downhill, slalom,
giant slalom and super-giant slalom.</TE>
<TE>   With his athletic ability, Miller may soon compete for the World
Cup overall title.</TE>
<TE>   Despite having raced in only three speed events this year, he has
racked up enough points to rank third in the World Cup overall
standings behind Austria's Stephan Eberharter and Aamodt.</TE>
<TE>   Miller seems intrigued with becoming an all-event skier and
reaping medals in the combined.</TE>
<TE>   "It is different," he says of the event. "You have to be ready to
go from a downhill to a slalom ski in an hour. Also, for me, I don't
have to try to win the downhill. I do have to try to be close."</TE>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>A Salt Lake Winter Olympic scandal involving a controversial figure
skating decision, an internal investigation by the International
Skating Union and a Chinese judge suddenly and mysteriously taking
ill?</LD>
<LD>   How quaint.</LD>
<LD>   No under-the-table freebies? No behind-closed-door gratuities?
Just an old-fashioned squabble over who really won the pairs gold
medal, coupled with accusations of political back-scratching and bloc
voting?</LD>
<TE>   It's enough to make you misty-eyed, and you don't even have to be
Canadian.</TE>
<TE>   All of Canada was in mourning Tuesday after favorite son and
daughter David Pelletier and Jamie Sale finished second to the
Russian team despite the hysterical protestations of NBC analysts
Sandra Bezic and Scott Hamilton--who, it needs to be noted, don't
have a vote in the matter.</TE>
<TE>   "Robbed!" declared the headline of Tuesday's Ottawa Star.</TE>
<TE>   "Canucks golden fleeced," seconded the Toronto Star.</TE>
<TE>   And perhaps they were. But let's put aside all the rumors of
backstage dealings and "Survivor"-type alliances for a moment and
break the matter down to its required-element essence:</TE>
<TE>   You skate to the theme from "Love Story," you deserve whatever you
get.</TE>
<TE>   You can say the judges from Russia, China, Poland and Ukraine--who
favored the Russian team of Elena Berezhnaya and Anton
Sikharulidze--were protecting their geopolitical interests.</TE>
<TE>   You can speculate that the French judge--who also went for the
Russians--was swapping a thumbs-up here for a return favor down the
line in ice dancing.</TE>
<TE>   Or you can say the judges were simply fulfilling their moral
responsibility as arbiters of good taste.</TE>
<TE>   Do we really want "Love Story" winning the gold medal?</TE>
<TE>   Shouldn't the top step of the Olympic podium be reserved for
something more, ahem, sophisticated than two Canadian skaters
throwing pretend snowballs at one another, reenacting the infamous
snowball fight from the Ali McGraw-Ryan O'Neal shlockfest?</TE>
<TE>   Is it any wonder the Chinese judge took ill and withdrew from
Tuesday's men's short program?</TE>
<TE>   An especially strong stomach was needed for that one. Unless you
like your male Olympic medal contenders dressed like comic book
superheroes, St. Valentine's Day cards or the produce section of your
local supermarket.</TE>
<TE>   Russia's Alexei Yagudin, the favorite in the competition, skated
out looking like the wrong man in the wrong place. I double-checked
the official program.</TE>
<TE>   No, this wasn't the audition for the black-and-white version of
"Spider-Man."</TE>
<TE>   Ukrainian Dmitri Dmitrenko followed shortly after, looking like
the unfortunate victim of a head-on collision with a downtown
florist's cart. At least Evgeni Plushenko, Yagudin's countryman</TE>
<TE>   and probable second-place finisher,</TE>
<TE>   dressed appropriately for the occasion: silver.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, Americans Timothy Goebel and Todd Eldredge were
understated--a good thing from a sartorial standpoint, if not the
overall standings. Goebel emerged from the evening in decent
shape--ahead of Plushenko, behind Yagudin and Japan's Takeshi Honda,
good enough for third place. Eldredge, however, botched his first
combination and fell on his next jump, squandering any slim medal
hopes he might have entertained, unless he makes a deal with a French
judge.</TE>
<TE>   Veteran's Day, it was not. Eldredge, 30 and famously conservative,
tried to think young, tried to boldly venture out of character--and
promptly fell right on his quad. Elvis Stojko, a month shy of his
30th birthday, wound up in seventh place, two slots ahead of
Eldredge. Earlier, in the downhill, Picabo Street, who turns 31 in
April, pushed her surgically scarred knees through one more run--and
finished 16th, just before announcing her retirement.</TE>
<TE>   These Olympics, they belong to the young (unless you count the
figure skating judges, who are fairly old.) U.S. speedskaters Casey
FitzRandolph, 27, and Kip Carpenter, 22, finished 1-3 in the men's
500 meters. Along with Derek Parra's silver in the 5,000, the United
States has three medals in three speedskating events, four years
after the American men went 0-for-Nagano.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, up in Park City, it was a tale of men and moguls and a
maneuver made famous by 1998 Olympic champion Jonny Moseley, a
720-degree barrel roll known in freestyle skiing as The Dinner Roll.</TE>
<TE>   "Jonny, Save Freestyle," read one supporter's handwritten sign at
the Deer Valley Resort. "Put Some Butta On The Dinner Roll."</TE>
<TE>   Moseley did what he could, playing to the crowd, putting on "a
good show," as he put it--nailing his trademark jump, at the expense
of his overall finish. The Dinner Roll, while tasty, accounted only
12.5% of Moseley's final score. Speed counts for 25%, and Moseley
wasted precious seconds with his audience-pleaser.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like the people who really know the sport will consider
what I did today as very bold and legendary," Moseley said.</TE>
<TE>   The judges thought differently, however. Moseley finished the day
in fourth place, behind winner Janne Lahtela of Finland and U.S.
teammate Travis Mayer, who took the silver.</TE>
<TE>   Lesson to be gained on the mountain Tuesday:</TE>
<TE>   Man does not live by the Dinner Roll alone.</TE>

<HD>A Relatively Delightful Day for Street</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Plaschke</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SNOWBASIN, Utah</DL>
<LD>She flew past the finish line, skidded into the corral, then this
country's most competitive skier did the strangest thing.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of shouting for joy, she shouted for her family.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of wagging one finger for number one, she held up her
index and pinkie fingers for love.</LD>
<TE>   Sometimes gold isn't everything, we were reminded Tuesday when
watching Picabo Street perform one last dance in the Olympic women's
downhill.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes home is enough.</TE>
<TE>   The most memorable final run of her career wasn't the one down the
Wildflower course, where she started fast and finished slow, her
medal melting into 16th place.</TE>
<TE>   Her most memorable last run began afterward, when she waded into
the bleachers to clutch the two dozen family members and friends that
had come from Idaho to share her final journey.</TE>
<TE>   Still in her Spiderman racing suit, she held tiny nephew Cade and
goddaughter Savannah, nuzzling, whispering.</TE>
<TE>   "I want Auntie," cried Savannah.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone wants Auntie," said her mother.</TE>
<TE>   Still with snow on her socks, Street then hugged her best friend,
Jessica Kahae, who was crying.</TE>
<TE>   "Picabo's legacy is that she has the power to be herself," Kahae
said.</TE>
<TE>   When Street finally left the group--many of whom are sleeping in
her Park City home--she made it clear she is never leaving the group.</TE>
<TE>   "See everyone tonight!" she shouted, disappearing with a phalanx
of security as everyone cheered and waved and cried some more.</TE>
<TE>   "She got to come down here to her hometown," said brother-in-law
Chris Feinman. "She didn't win a gold medal. But she got to come down
to her family and friends."</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, apparently, that was the same thing.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone thought Street spent the last four years working her way
back to the Olympics from a horrific crash and third knee operation
in hopes of finishing first.</TE>
<TE>   Turns out, she came back simply to finish.</TE>
<TE>   On a beautiful day such as this. With the stands filled with more
than 20,000 fans shouting her name. With family waiting for her
embrace. A retirement gift more valuable than a lodge full of gold
watches.</TE>
<TE>   "At one time, I visualized winning the gold medal ... and of
course I still wanted to win," Street said. "But lately, that vision
was a lot more blurry than the one about finishing at home, just like
this."</TE>
<TE>   Blurry only after she realized she was going to finish nearly a
minute and a half behind winner Carole Montillet of France?</TE>
<TE>   This didn't seem like it. This seemed real, from the moment
immediately after her run, when she waved and blew kisses to the
crowd through her helmet.</TE>
<TE>   She later grabbed a microphone and shouted, "You guys make it all
worth it! This is the best day I've ever had in my ski racing
career!"</TE>
<TE>   Then she hugged her mother Dee for the longest time, with a
conversation that had nothing to do with winning.</TE>
<TE>   "Relieved, are you?" her mother asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah," Picabo said.</TE>
<TE>   And so this career of the most popular female skier in this
country's history is over, two Olympic medals, two World Cup downhill
championships, a 30-year-old who changed right before our eyes.</TE>
<TE>   The little hippie girl?</TE>
<TE>   She became an unabashed patriot, dressing up Tuesday with a
heart-shaped flag tattooed on her right cheek, a flag scarf hanging
out of the back her helmet, that helmet adorned with the Statue of
Liberty, an eagle and fighter jets.</TE>
<TE>   The reckless fighter?</TE>
<TE>   She said that during the last couple of years, her legendary
late-night calls to her parents</TE>
<TE>   from Europe were not about how she finished, but if she finished
safely.</TE>
<TE>   "Thanks, Mom and Dad, for all those 4 a.m. phone calls!" she
shouted into the microphone. "Now you don't have to wait anymore. I'm
coming home, baby!"</TE>
<TE>   And the big-game killer? The skier who stunned the sports world
with a downhill silver medal in 1994 in Lillehammer then, after
shredding her left knee in an accident two years later, surprised
everyone again in 1998 at Nagano by winning a super-G gold?</TE>
<TE>   In the end, she changed the rules. Going up on the ski lift
Tuesday, she admitted that she was thinking about more than winning.</TE>
<TE>   "I looked at everyone in the stands and I wished I could have
said, 'I'm on my way down! Be there in a minute!'" she said.</TE>
<TE>   Coming down, she said she skied well, despite a performance that
would have angered her in earlier years.</TE>
<TE>   "I executed my plan of attack, I executed what I came out here to
do," she said. Finally, when she slid into the corral, she said she
didn't need to look at the scoreboard.</TE>
<TE>   "Coming across the line, I thought, this is what I dreamed, what I
thought about, what I cried over ... skiing into a finish with
[thousands] cheering for me," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She is finished, but she's not, after cutting a trail that will be
visible long after her departure. It is a path paved with positive</TE>
<TE>   ideas about the character of women athletes, ideas about strength
and empowerment and personality.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just following the lead Picabo created," said Jonna Mendes,
who finished 11th Tuesday, the highest among Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Street's father Ron recalled Tuesday how that path evolved,
describing he and his daughter's first ski trips into the Idaho</TE>
<TE>   woods.</TE>
<TE>   "It used to be, 'Turn when I turn,'" he said. "Then I turned when
she turned. Then, I just stood back and watched."</TE>
<TE>   It was quite a sight, wasn't it? Still is.</TE>

<DL>PARK CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>Ski jumping may not be a mainstream sport in the United States, but
whether it's Michael Jordan or the space shuttle, Americans love to
see things fly.</LD>
<LD>   The 120-meter jump is the Winter Olympics' ultimate air show, and
a packed house of 19,200 roaring spectators--including Princess Anne
and former Polish president Lech Walesa--turned out to watch the
event's qualifying round Tuesday at Utah Olympic Park.</LD>
<LD>   Only 16 of the 66 competitors were eliminated from today's finals,
and Tuesday's marks don't carry over, so it was a day to sit back and
enjoy watching men seemingly suspended on strings.</LD>
<TE>   World Cup leader Adam Malysz, nicknamed "the Polish Batman,"
seemed to be riding in his bat glider as he soared 123.5 meters, the
day's third-longest jump and--combined with style points--enough for
the lead with 120.8 total points.</TE>
<TE>   German co-favorite Sven Hannawald and Slovenia's Robert Kranjec
tied for second with 119.1 points, both on jumps of 122 meters.
Italy's Roberto Cecon, fourth with 118 points, and Slovenia's Peter
Zonta, 20th with 103.5, each had the day's longest jump, 125 meters.
Simon Ammann of Switzerland, the surprise gold-medal winner in
Sunday's 90-meter jump, flew 119.5 meters but received mediocre style
marks and finished 13th.</TE>
<TE>   Alan Alborn of Anchorage, the top U.S. jumper, placed eighth with
114.1 points on a jump of 119.5 meters and appeared ready to improve
on his 11th-place finish in the 90-meter competition. Alborn said he
is aiming for a medal, not only because it would be the first U.S.
Olympic ski-jumping medal in 78 years but also because it would "show
American ski jumpers are competitive."</TE>
<TE>   "Once you have a medal, it's proof," he said. "Everybody can say
he could have won a medal, but that doesn't cut it until you do it."</TE>
<TE>   Alborn said competing in front of large crowds at overseas events
had helped him learn to block out cheering when he was ready to jump,
but he appreciated the enthusiastic turnout for the 120-meter event.</TE>
<TE>   "It was definitely a boost to have all these people root for you,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Clint Jones of the U.S. jumped 111.5 meters for 97.2 points and
qualified for the finals. Americans Brendan Doran and Tommy Schwall
were among those eliminated.</TE>
<TE>   Hannawald, the 90-meter silver medal winner, said the young U.S.
jumpers have the talent to do better but need experience.</TE>
<TE>   "They're getting better, but they need more time," he said. "They
can't think they can rebuild this in one year, so they have to
train."</TE>

<HD>Gold Is a Perfect Fitz</HD>
<DH>FitzRandolph does just enough to hold off Shimizu for first
U.S. victory in 500 meters since Heiden, and U.S. teammate Carpenter
wins bronze.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE KUPPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KEARNS, Utah</DL>
<LD>Casey FitzRandolph didn't skate as fast Tuesday as he had Monday in
the men's 500 at the Utah Olympic Oval, but it didn't matter.</LD>
<LD>   Neither did Hiroyasu Shimizu.</LD>
<LD>   So, by a margin that he wouldn't have wanted to cut any closer,
.03 of a second, the veteran sprinter from Verona, Wis., made his
first Olympic medal a gold one. It was America's first in men's
speedskating since Dan Jansen won his final race at Lillehammer in
1994, and the first in the 500 since Eric Heiden's in 1980.</LD>
<TE>   And rounding out a day of good fortune for the U.S. team, Olympic
rookie Kip Carpenter, another Wisconsinite, won a bronze.</TE>
<TE>   FitzRandolph finished with a two-race time of 69.23 seconds to
69.26 for Shimizu, who won the 500 at Nagano and holds the world
record in the event. Carpenter's third-place time was 69.47.</TE>
<TE>   Considering that FitzRandolph, Shimizu and Carpenter were 1-2-3
after the first half of the two-day race, it sounds as though
Tuesday's skating was nothing more than a rerun. In fact, it was
anything but.</TE>
<TE>   On a day when most of the 33 other skaters bettered their
first-skate times, the medalists all failed to match their Monday
efforts. FitzRandolph, in fact, was beaten by Carpenter when they
were paired in the final race of the day.</TE>
<TE>   "When I crossed the line, I didn't know if I'd won," FitzRandolph,
27, said. "I could hear the people cheering, but I didn't know if
they were cheering for Kip and the bronze or me and the silver...."</TE>
<TE>   They were cheering for FitzRandolph and gold--as well as Carpenter
and the bronze--but if FitzRandolph hadn't hustled along at the end,
he might have had to settle for silver.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't have a very good race," he said. "Kip is known for his
slow starts and he was kicking my butt at the start. When I saw my
opener [the first 100 meters], I knew I had to get on it, that I
couldn't coast through this race and win a gold medal. I was just
trying to stay with it mentally. Luckily, I came out of it with .03
to spare."</TE>
<TE>   Luckily for him, as well, Shimizu was unable to make good on a vow
to better his Monday time, posting a 34.65-second run, compared with
Monday's 34.61.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, Shimizu's run was the second-fastest of the day. Had it
been the fastest, he'd now have a pair of gold medals.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel a little bit of regret," he said, not the least bit
consoled by silver. "I could have done better. The difference might
have been [small], but that was the difference between winning and
not winning. Defeat is still defeat."</TE>
<TE>   And victory is still victory, and it all came down to the last two
pairs of the day, a little more than a minute's worth of skating.</TE>
<TE>   Shimizu, skating with Canadian Mike Ireland in the second-to-last
pair, had a .19-second deficit to make up, and because times were
running faster, many were looking to Shimizu for a fast run, maybe a
record run. When he didn't get it, and indeed was slower than he had
been Monday, the predominantly U.S. crowd breathed a collective sigh
of relief.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Americans had to skate in the final pair, and as cozy
as that sounds, it's not always a desirable thing. It's bad, for
instance, when one skater falls. It's worse when one falls and takes
out the other. It's worst of all when they're teammates.</TE>
<TE>   "The last 24 hours had not been too relaxing and my nerves were
acting up before the race," FitzRandolph said.</TE>
<TE>   Added Carpenter, "I was ready to race again after [Monday's] race
... but I only slept three hours last night and I was nervous about
that."</TE>
<TE>   So, two nervous skaters went to the line, one of
them--FitzRandolph--who had false-started, then fallen from third to
sixth in somewhat similar circumstances four years ago at Nagano.</TE>
<TE>   "One of my challenges was to put that out of my mind," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Carpenter's surprisingly fast start was enough to get FitzRandolph
focused again.</TE>
<TE>   "Four years ago, I knew I had to skate the race of my life, times
two," he said. "This time, because I skate fast every day, I knew I
had to skate a good race, times two. I felt like I could skate fast
enough to win."</TE>
<TE>   And so he did, but just barely. His 34.81 was .39 slower than his
Monday time, .02 slower than Carpenter's time, and was good enough
only for a tie for sixth-fastest of the day.</TE>
<TE>   Still, good enough was good enough, and now FitzRandolph, who
learned to skate on the rink once used by Heiden, his inspiration,
knows what it's like to be a gold-medal Olympian.</TE>
<TE>   "Too many things are going through my mind and not sticking around
long enough for me to grasp them," he said. "I realize that I've just
won the gold medal, but in terms of the last 22 years--that has not
sunk in yet."</TE>
<TE>   It was 22 years ago, when he was 5, that FitzRandolph decided to
become an Olympic champion.</TE>
<TE>   "I was playing hockey in 1980 when Eric Heiden won his five gold
medals and apparently that impressed me more than our [Miracle on
Ice] hockey team," FitzRandolph recalled. "I told everyone I was
going to do what Eric did. Obviously, that's not going to happen."</TE>
<TE>   Still, a gold medal commands some respect, and FitzRandolph's was
worth a hug from Heiden, the U.S. team physician who was rinkside.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been 22 long years," FitzRandolph said, "but I couldn't have
written a better script since watching Eric in 1980."</TE>

<TE>   With nine medals through four days of competition, the United
States seems well on its way to establishing records for medals won
in the Winter Olympics. A look at how they are progressing at Salt
Lake, compared to their previous highs:</TE>
<TE>   2002   *Record</TE>
<TE>   Gold 3  6</TE>
<TE>   Silver 4  6</TE>
<TE>   Bronze 2  4</TE>
<TE>   Total 9  13</TE>
<TE>   * Individual records established at different Games. The U.S.
record for gold medals was set at the 1932 Lake Placid Games and
equaled at Lake Placid in 1980, Lillehammer in 1994 and Nagano in
1998; the mark for silvers was set at Oslo in 1952; the most bronze
medals were won at Innsbruck in 1976 and equaled at Nagano; the
overall record of 13 medals was set at Lillehammer and equaled at
Nagano.</TE>

<KH>WHERE ARE THEY NOW?</KH>
<HD>Mahre Brothers Still Double-Teaming the Slopes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They were identical twins, brothers from Yakima, Wash., who gave the
U.S. perhaps its single greatest Olympic skiing moment.</LD>
<LD>   Phil and Steve Mahre won slalom gold and silver at the 1984 Winter
Games in Sarajevo. They put up inspiring performances that came from
nowhere after both had suffered through a season of poor performances
and a seeming lack of desire.</LD>
<LD>   Heading into the Sarajevo Games, Steve had been 45th in the World
Cup standings and Phil 62nd. Four years earlier in Lake Placid, Phil
had won a silver, finishing behind only Swedish dominator Ingemar
Stenmark. Stenmark was not allowed to compete in 1984 because he had
turned professional.</LD>
<TE>   Also missing from the field was another slalom star, Marc
Girardelli, who had run afoul of citizenship rules by competing for
Luxembourg while he was an Austrian citizen.</TE>
<TE>   Five days before the slalom, Phil had finished eighth and Steve
17th in the giant slalom. Their skiing was called "desultory" in one
news account and their attitude was considered "disrespectful" in
another because Phil had made a comment about not needing a gold
medal because he was already set for life.</TE>
<TE>   With that as the setting, it was considered a big upset when,
after the first of two runs, Steve was in first place and Phil in
third.</TE>
<TE>   Phil finished his well-executed second run first, then used a
walkie-talkie to give hints to Steve on how the course was running.</TE>
<TE>   Steve attacked his second round ferociously, too much so for
winning a race where technical perfection matters as much as speed,
and he finished second to his brother.</TE>
<TE>   The brothers are still together. They are 44 and live in Yakima.
Steve has two children; Phil has three.</TE>
<TE>   According to Steve, the brothers make their living in the ski
industry. They run the Mahre Training Centers in Keystone, Colo. "It
is a skiing enhancement center for everyone, from beginner to
expert," Steve said. Steve also participates in a mentoring program
for the U.S. ski team development programs.</TE>
<TE>   The brothers occasionally participate in what Steve calls "old-man
races."</TE>
<TE>   Steve is working on restoring his home, a 1902 brick Victorian,
and Phil is helping his in-laws build a home. Phil also built a
private water skiing lake for his family.</TE>
<TE>   "The memory of 1984, of winning a medal and being able to share it
with my brother and family, is an amazing memory," Steve said.
"Sometimes it feels like a long time ago, some days it feels like
just yesterday. Winning the medal on the same day in the same event
as my brother is something that is hard to describe. It was just a
great moment in time that will always be treasured. We've always been
close and that event in our lives only strengthened this feeling."</TE>
<TE>   The brothers learned to ski after their father took a job as
mountain manager at the White Pass Ski Area in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The Mahres competed in three Olympics (beginning in 1976) and Phil
is the only American male skier to medal in two Olympic Games. Phil
was the first skier inducted into the U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame in
1992 and one of only three men (Stenmark and Gustavo Thoeni of Italy
were the others) to win the World Cup overall championship three
years in a row (1981, 1982 and 1983).</TE>

<HD>It's All U.S. in Crowd Pleaser</HD>
<DH>Women's team lives up to lofty expectations with 10-0
opening-game rout over Germany before flag-waving fans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. ADANDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WEST VALLEY CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>If the United States women's hockey team wondered what it would be
like to play the Olympics in its home country, it found out long
before game time.</LD>
<LD>   And if there were any doubts that the team's performance could
match the lofty expectations, they were resolved well before the
final buzzer sounded Tuesday in a 10-0 victory over Germany.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps the outcome wasn't decided as soon as the team buses
pulled up to the E Center, but the tone for the day sure was.</LD>
<TE>   "We were driving up here before the game and there was a huge line
outside the gates," U.S. forward Shelley Looney said. "We were like,
'That can't be for our game. It's two hours ahead of the game.' They
were like, 'Yeah. They open the gates at 10.'"</TE>
<TE>   The flag-waving crowd filled the 8,400-seat arena with noise as
soon as the American women hit the ice.</TE>
<TE>   "We were definitely excited," forward Karyn Bye said. "We were
tapping each other on the shin pads, saying 'Hey, come on, let's show
this crowd how we can play.'"</TE>
<TE>   They didn't show their top form right away. If this were a sport
that depended on fast starts, like speedskating or the bobsled, they
would have been in trouble.</TE>
<TE>   They tried a little too hard to be perfect, to adhere to the
system, and made a few too many passes. It took four German penalties
before the Americans ran a good power play.</TE>
<TE>   Bye scored the United States' first goal 6:46 into the first
period, when Jenny Potter fed her a pass from behind the net.</TE>
<TE>   With just under four minutes left, Laurie Baker skated around the
net, caught German goalie Stephanie Wartosch out of position and shot
the puck off her leg to make it 2-0.</TE>
<TE>   The high-powered U.S., which averaged 7.5 goals per game in its
pre-Olympic tour, finally got rolling in the second period. The
Americans cranked up the fastbreak, creating odd-man rushes and
scoring three goals in less than two minutes. They poured it on from
there, with one section of the crowd gleefully counting the goal
total after each score.</TE>
<TE>   "They are extremely skillful players, their technique is great and
they're very, very good skaters," German forward Julia Wierscher
said. "Very fast, very physical. And this is what we need to learn."</TE>
<TE>   What makes the Americans so formidable is their combination of
skill and hustle. They're all willing to do the dirty work as well.
On the third goal, Natalie Darwitz dug the puck off the boards in the
German zone, accelerated and fired a shot that went off Wartosch's
side and into the net.</TE>
<TE>   Eight players scored, with Bye and Darwitz each getting two goals.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest threat to U.S. goalie Sara DeCosta was her blades,
which would freeze to the ice because of inactivity.</TE>
<TE>   Germany managed only eight shots for the game and had no
legitimate scoring chances in the second period.</TE>
<TE>   They were credited with two shots on goal during the period, but
those were merely dump-ins that went straight toward DeCosta's stick.</TE>
<TE>   "It's 100 times easier to play in a game where you get 50-60 shots
than a game where you get five, eight, whatever," said DeCosta, who
recorded eight shutouts in 17 pre-Olympic games.</TE>
<TE>   Would it be a disadvantage if an untested United States suddenly
finds itself locked in a tight game with Canada with the gold medal
at stake? At this point, that's about the only element of mystery to
this tournament, in which the two North American teams clearly
surpass the rest of the globe.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been a lot of pomp and circumstance," U.S. Coach Ben
Smith said. "We finally got a chance to play today."</TE>
<TE>   In another women's game, Riikka Nieminen had three assists for
Finland in a 4-0 victory over China, which plays the U.S. on
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   In men's games, Austria edged Slovakia, 3-2, and Germany defeated
Latvia, 4-1.</TE>

<HD>First Is a First for France</HD>
<DH>Montillet credits win in part to teammate Cavagnoud, who
was killed in October. Street is 16th in final race.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SNOWBASIN, Utah</DL>
<LD>It was supposed to be Picabo Street's day in the downhill, but that
obviously wasn't in the grand plan.</LD>
<LD>   If it was, the race would have gone off as scheduled, on Monday,
and Street would have zoomed down the Wildflower course at Snowbasin
from the second race position on cold snow.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, the race was pushed to Tuesday, Street got stuck with bib
No. 26, a two-hour start delay softened the snow, Street sloshed her
way to 16th place and one compelling moment gave way to another.</LD>
<TE>   Street very much wanted to script the ending in the last race of
her spectacular career, but, in the end, she couldn't top the story
of France's Carole Montillet, a downhill underdog who pulled off the
run of her life for a ski team still shocked by the loss of superstar
teammate Regine Cavagnoud, killed in a freak training accident in
October.</TE>
<TE>   Montillet won the women's downhill from the 11th start position
with a time of 1 minute 39.56 seconds. Italy's Isolde Kostner, one of
the favorites, took the silver with a time of 1:40.01 and Renate
Goetschl of Austria took the bronze in 1:40.39.</TE>
<TE>   It was a disappointing day for the American speed team, which did
not place a racer in the top 10. Jonna Mendes finished 11th to lead
the U.S. field, followed by Kirsten Clark at No. 12 and then Street.</TE>
<TE>   Caroline Lalive crashed and did not finish.</TE>
<TE>   Montillet's victory was the first for a French woman in the
Olympic downhill and her first downhill win.</TE>
<TE>   Had Cavagnoud not been struck down, dying at 31 when she collided
with a German ski coach while training on an Austrian glacier, she
might have been on the victory stand instead of Montillet.</TE>
<TE>   "I really ran the race for myself," Montillet said in French
through an interpreter, "but I know that she [Regine] helped me
because she was with me."</TE>
<TE>   Street didn't think it was coincidence. "If you're paying
attention, God doesn't work in mysterious ways, he works in strategic
ways," Street said. "He did today what he needed to do."</TE>
<TE>   Street happily accepted this trade-off. Though she desperately
wanted to steal a medal in her last competitive race, and give the
home-country fans something to scream about, Street ultimately got
out with what she wanted most: her health and her life.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't imagine having to ski after losing one of my teammates,"
Street said of Montillet's feat. "I don't even know if I could do
it."</TE>
<TE>   Downhill racers play a devil's dance, and Street had dipped close
to the fire, nearly losing it all in a horrendous crash in
Switzerland in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   She made it all the way back from that spill, and a 16th-place
Olympic finish in that context set her free.</TE>
<TE>   "It was worth making the comeback just to be here," said Street, a
silver medalist in the downhill in 1994 and gold medalist in the
super-G in 1998. "I have no regrets. If I died and came back
tomorrow, I'd do it all over again and I'd do it exactly the same
way."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe things do happen for a reason, because there was a certain
magic in Montillet's run and no Earthly inkling that it was going to
happen.</TE>
<TE>   Montillet was ranked only 15th in the World Cup downhill
standings.</TE>
<TE>   Kostner certainly didn't see it coming.</TE>
<TE>   "I know at the Olympics there is always an element of surprise,"
Kostner said, "but I didn't think of her in that sense."</TE>
<TE>   To say that Cavagnoud's death has affected Montillet would be
understatement. The tragedy has hung like a dark cloud over the
French team. Montillet said she became suffocated by the harping of
journalists who injected the memory of Regine into every conversation
about her and the team.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever I did, the reference was always made to Regine's
accident," she said. "Everything was simply referred back to that.
That was very, very difficult for me because I was beginning to feel
as if I was losing my own identity. Then, I really got fed up. I had
enough of it."</TE>
<TE>   Montillet retreated from the public eye. She dodged journalists,
up to and through the Olympic downhill training runs. At one point
before the Olympics she sought refuge in San Diego, of all places, in
an attempt to escape.</TE>
<TE>   Now what?</TE>
<TE>   "I know I'm going to be a public figure from now on," Montillet
said, "but I'm not going to say yes to everybody."</TE>
<TE>   The story lines of Street and Montillet overshadowed a downer day
for Team USA, which was expected to contend for a medal.</TE>
<TE>   Lalive did not take advantage of her No. 2 start position, caught
an edge and crashed, suffering more damage to her pride than her
body.</TE>
<TE>   Lalive, 22, is a promising star, yet her ski-out almost mirrored
her crash at last year's world championships at St. Anton.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want it to be a pattern," Lalive said of her struggles in
big races, "but maybe it's something I need to look at, how I
approach major events."</TE>

<HD>MTA Increases Estimates of Valley Busway Commute Time</HD>
<DH>Transit: Officials also make concessions to some residents
in latest plans for east-west line.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A proposed busway across the San Fernando Valley will probably not
reduce commute times as much as had been anticipated, according to
the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's latest estimates.</LD>
<LD>   And the east-west busway's final environmental impact report makes
some concessions to vociferous opponents by proposing added
pedestrian paths and more sound walls along the 14-mile route.</LD>
<LD>   The report is "responsive to the public comments we received,"
said Los Angeles County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, who chairs the
MTA board.</LD>
<TE>   Yaroslavsky shrugged off the report's estimate that a ride between
its end points at Warner Center in Woodland Hills and North
Hollywood's Metro Red Line subway station could take 35 to 40
minutes. Last year, the MTA said such a ride would take as little as
28.8 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still better than an hour and 15 minutes on the 101
[Freeway]," Yaroslavsky said. "It's an alternative to sitting in
traffic."</TE>
<TE>   The report, an update of a draft prepared last summer, is expected
to be approved by the MTA board at its Feb. 28 meeting. Then,
officials plan to choose a contractor, begin construction in spring
2003 and open the busway in spring 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Some community members are shuddering at the thought.</TE>
<TE>   "It will destroy our neighborhood ... our whole area," said Jill
Haber, chairwoman of West Valley Concerned Citizens, one of many
community groups opposing the project.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say the corridor, which could have hundreds of buses
running every day, would harm their communities with congestion and
noise. Concerns about air pollution were assuaged by MTA officials'
promise to use "clean fuel" buses.</TE>
<TE>   Orthodox Jews who live and walk to their synagogue in the East
Valley area fear the frequent buses would inconvenience or endanger
pedestrians.</TE>
<TE>   Reversing itself since the draft study, the MTA now proposes to
build several pedestrian paths along the corridor. And to accommodate
Orthodox Jews who cannot do any work--including pushing buttons on
mechanical devices--on their Sabbath and holidays, crosswalk signals
would be operated by a timer on those days.</TE>
<TE>   More "traffic calming measures" will be implemented, such as
adding left and right turn pockets and diverting cars away from
residential neighborhoods, said project manager Kathleen Sanchez. The
MTA plans to build 6,100 additional feet of sound walls, bringing the
total to 29,500 feet.</TE>
<TE>   But bus rides will take longer than previously anticipated,
Sanchez said, because the city of Los Angeles Department of
Transportation told the MTA it will not synchronize traffic signals
to the degree the agency had expected.</TE>
<TE>   Transportation officials denied that assertion. The agency has
long planned to synchronize traffic signals along the corridor, said
James Okazaki, assistant general manager. He criticized the MTA's
earlier analysis of travel time as "unreasonable" and said it would
be possible only if there were no cars trying to cross the corridor
and the buses made no stops.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the corridor's opponents said they feel defeated despite
the MTA's concessions.</TE>
<TE>   Rabbi Marvin Sugarman said he still opposes the transit corridor
despite improvements for pedestrians, because it would still directly
face his Shaarey Zedek Temple in Valley Village on Chandler Boulevard
and disrupt his congregation's tranquillity.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been vehemently opposed to this from the very beginning,"
Sugarman said. "We haven't had the power to overcome this stupidity."</TE>
<TE>   Others say the project, which began years ago as a subway
proposal, is long overdue.</TE>
<TE>   Mel Wilson, co-chairman of the Valley Industry and Commerce
Assn.'s ground transportation committee, called busway opponents "a
very boisterous minority."</TE>
<TE>   A busway will "do a lot of good for a majority of folks," Wilson
said. "Now it's time to build."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Authorities used a bloodhound Tuesday to search the home of a
7-year-old girl who has been missing since Feb. 2.</LD>
<LD>   Officers led the bloodhound, on loan from the Riverside County
Sheriff's Department, on a thorough search of Danielle van Dam's
home.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities were hopeful that the dog's extremely keen nose would
detect something that other dogs had missed.</LD>
<TE>   "We're going to try to pick up a scent," Lt. Jim Duncan told
reporters. "This dog is different than the dogs we used the other
day, and it's supposed to be maybe a little bit better-trained."</TE>
<TE>   Officials declined to say whether the dog found anything.</TE>
<TE>   Danielle's family says she was last seen when her father, Damon
van Dam, put her to bed on Feb. 1. She was discovered missing the
next morning.</TE>
<TE>   Police believe she was abducted.</TE>
<TE>   There have been no arrests.</TE>
<TE>   Danielle's parents said Monday they were posting a $25,000 reward.
Investigators have seized a motor home and property belonging to a
neighbor of the Van Dams, David Westerfield, and police have said he
is a focus of the investigation. The 49-year-old engineer, who has
hired a criminal attorney, has allowed police to search his home.</TE>

<LD>Ten people have been arrested, including a Robinsons-May employee, on
suspicion of stealing about $10,000 worth of clothing from the Canoga
Park department store, officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Each suspect was charged with one count of burglary, said Det.
Robert Phan of the Los Angeles Police Department.</LD>
<LD>   Officers arrived at the store in the Westfield Shoppingtown
Topanga mall on Topanga Canyon Boulevard about 8:30 p.m. Monday,
after witnesses saw thieves leaving the store in two cars filled with
clothing, police said.</LD>
<TE>   Arrested were Aaron Afzali, 30, of Upland; Monica Afzaoi, 31, and
Feradoon Martin, 26, of Alta Loma; Anthony Molina, 18, Mario Molina,
21, and Anita Nava, 20, of Baldwin Park; Eric Rojas, 22, and Linda
Rojas, 24, of Pacoima; Nadia Tejada, 22, of Rancho Cucamonga; and Ana
Valdez, 18, of Fontana.</TE>
<TE>   Each is being held in lieu of $15,000 bail at either the West
Valley or Van Nuys jails.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Rojas, a loss-prevention officer at the store, is suspected
of being instrumental in the theft, Phan said.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the clothing was recovered at the scene, Phan said.</TE>

<DH>Baseball: Uncertainty over contraction and a depressed
free-agent market have some hinting at collusion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There is a chill in the air from another winter of discontent in
professional baseball as pitchers and catchers prepare to report to
spring training later this week.</LD>
<LD>   Commissioner Bud Selig's plan to eliminate two major league teams
was stalled by politicians and ultimately quashed by the courts, and
owners and players still don't have a new labor agreement.</LD>
<LD>   So why the undercurrent of feeling that Selig &amp; Co. accomplished
most of what they wanted?</LD>
<TE>   Perhaps because of the latest free-agent freeze out.</TE>
<TE>   There were some big contracts this off-season, but it appears that
the contraction movement, while failing in the courts, succeeded in
holding salaries relatively in check.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly something did. And player agents have their own 'C-word'
theory.</TE>
<TE>   Collusion.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course there was collusion," agent Alan Meersand said. "All
the clubs are working together. There may or may not have been a
directive from [the commissioner's office], but there doesn't have to
be a directive to withhold making offers when you announce you're
going to eliminate teams.</TE>
<TE>   "The moment the great leader of major league baseball, our
fearless commissioner, tells the world that major league baseball is
going to eliminate two teams, the other 28 general managers are
frozen until they know what's going to happen with those players.
Just look at what happened in the market. It was absolutely
depressed. There was no question about it, and everybody knows why."</TE>
<TE>   Well, maybe not everybody. While acknowledging the possibility of
a dispersal draft might have been a factor, baseball executives
attribute the change to clubs acting responsibly after years of
reckless spending produced bloated payrolls and hundreds of millions
in guaranteed contracts.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a market correction," said Dan O'Dowd, general manager of
the Colorado Rockies. "A lot of clubs like us, clubs that spent money
in the past, are now facing the reality of [their actions]. All of
our decisions this winter have been reality-based decisions. My
compatriots in the game are doing the same exact thing. I think it's
going to be this way from year in and year out now.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a star-driven system. It was the way it was created; that's
the way the union wants it. The price you pay, when you have that
type of system, is that there are going to be a lot of guys left at
the very end who don't have anything."</TE>
<TE>   Agents cite an inordinate number of offers considered below market
value and still-unsigned free agents as proof that contraction was a
form of collusion, whether planned or a welcomed byproduct  for
owners.</TE>
<TE>   The postponed contraction process has become an issue in ongoing
talks for a new collective bargaining agreement, and the Major League
Baseball Players Assn. has filed a grievance to officially address
the situation.</TE>
<TE>   Although general managers prepared for a dispersal draft, they
dispute that the process hindered their pursuit of free agents. Had a
draft occurred, several said it would have only provided a Band-Aid
for most clubs' deficiencies--not a cure-all.</TE>
<TE>   But even free agents considered among the game's elite players
often found that their price wasn't right; many accepted less than
their initial contract requests.</TE>
<TE>   Barry Bonds received a five-year, $90-million contract to remain
with the San Francisco Giants after establishing a major league
single-season home run record and being selected the National
League's most valuable player for the fourth time. The perennial
All-Star had been expected to receive a deal that averaged more than
$20 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   Juan Gonzalez returned to the Texas Rangers for a two-year,
$24-million contract. Despite concerns about his back, the All-Star
outfielder, who won two American League MVP awards in his first stint
with the Rangers, probably would have received offers between $15
million to $20 million annually in previous off-seasons.</TE>
<TE>   The pitching market took a hit too.</TE>
<TE>   Chan Ho Park, considered the top available starter, left the
Dodgers for the Texas Rangers, signing a five-year deal that could be
worth as much as $71 million. But others, based on standards for the
position, settled for surprisingly low contracts.</TE>
<TE>   For example, former Dodger James Baldwin, who sought a three-year
contract for more than $20 million, took a one-year, $1.25-million
deal with the Seattle Mariners.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year, if you look at the starting pitchers, you saw good
pitchers like [Kevin] Appier and [Denny] Neagle getting $10 million,
$11 million," agent Eric Goldschmidt said. "This year, you saw good
pitchers like Aaron Sele getting $7 million or $8 million. What that
tells me is that clubs are either managing their money better, or
there are some other factors that came into play."</TE>
<TE>   Then again, this class of free agents was not considered one of
the best. Agents acknowledge that fewer marquee players were
available than in recent seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "The suggestion of collusion is a convenient excuse for a confused
marketplace," agent Jeff Moorad said. "I will say that I think teams
were better informed about offers being made. I sensed some level of
shared information, more so than in the past, between the
organizations, but I can't put my finger on anything specific. It's
far too easy to fall back on the claim of collusion."</TE>

<LD>Stephen A. Smith of the Philadelphia Inquirer, commenting on Kobe
Bryant's ordeal at the NBA All-Star game: "The same city that once
booed Santa Claus, that cheered when Dallas Cowboy receiver Michael
Irvin suffered a neck injury on the turf of Veterans Stadium, that
former Phillie standout Pete Rose once labeled a town that would 'boo
a crack in the Liberty Bell,' continues to amaze with one pathetic
display after another.</LD>

game?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Welcome aboard: Tom FitzGerald in the San Francisco Chronicle:
"Congratulations to Tim McCarver, the new member of the Giants' TV
crew. Fortunately, he didn't let little things keep him from taking
his new job, like winning this column's 'Most Annoying TV
Sportscaster' poll last fall.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe he can win over viewers like Jim Greene of San Francisco,
who says of the newcomer, 'Wouldn't a chalkboard and fingernails be a
lot less expensive?'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More FitzGerald: "You'll never guess who wants to be a head coach
in the NBA when his playing career is over. It's Latrell 'The Choker

he says.</TE>
<TE>   "Mostly blood, depending on how hard he squeezed."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Expanding allegiance: An NBC promo for the Saturday night Olympic
pairs program of Jamie Sale and David Pelletier of Canada said the
pair would "try to bring home a medal for North America."</TE>
<TE>   Said Bob Wolfley of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: "So, hey, if
you get tired of rooting for the U.S., take up the cause for your
continent."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   One and the same: Charles Austin, the high-jump gold medalist at

don't see how it can be a true American athletic endeavor if there is
no ball, basket or recruiting scandal."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Slow excitement: From comedy writer Jerry Perisho: "The American
men's curling team upset world champion Sweden, 10-5, at the Olympic
Games on Monday. You could almost hear Al Michaels call the last few
seconds: 'Do you believe in lethargy? Yes!'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Elmore Smith of the Lakers, 17, against Portland on
Oct. 28, 1973.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Jerry Colangelo may be running out of patience with
being an NBA owner. When it was mentioned that he seems to enjoy the
company of baseball players more than basketball players, Colangelo,
who owns the Suns and Diamondbacks, told the Arizona Republic: "I'm
not going to argue with your observation. Getting into baseball was
refreshing. So many players have paid their dues and are appreciative
of what they have. Baseball is a breath of fresh air. It's a
different culture."</TE>

<LD>Eli Meschures of Beverly Hills High has plenty of reasons for wishing
the Southern Section soccer playoffs would never end.</LD>
<LD>   Meschures is a senior who will play in the first playoff game of
his three-year varsity career Friday when Beverly Hills (17-6-2)
travels to Pasadena (16-1-4) for a first-round Division III game.</LD>
<LD>   Beverly Hills is making its first playoff appearance since the
1995-96 season.</LD>
<TE>   And, perhaps most important to Meschures, he relishes playing on
the same team as his brothers, freshman Michael and sophomore Harry.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been like a dream come true," Eli said. "To be able to
play on the same team with my brothers and to have the team make the
playoffs for the first time in seven years has been really special."</TE>
<TE>   Eli, a third-team all-section Division II selection as a sophomore
and junior, is a center midfielder on a Beverly Hills team that is
one victory away from tying the school record for wins in a season.</TE>
<TE>   Michael is a starter at left midfield, and Harry is a reserve
midfielder and played forward.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been really easy coaching them," Coach Steve Rappaport said.
"Eli has been our team leader the last couple of seasons and his
brothers try to emulate him. Eli is not a vocal leader. He goes out
and plays hard and the brothers just follow suit."</TE>
<TE>   Although this is the first season that the brothers have been on
the same team, the three of them have practiced together often.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like you always know what the other guy is going to do,"
said Michael. "We're not really the talkative types on the field, but
we're able to communicate with each other without saying anything."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Back on the right track: La Puente Nogales (17-4-2) was ranked
among the top 10 teams in the region for the first two months of the
season, but dropped from the rankings after going 2-3 during a
five-game stretch last month.</TE>
<TE>   Coach John Rodriguez said internal problems contributed to
Nogales' swoon.</TE>
<TE>   "The Damien game was the straw that broke the camel's back,"
Rodriguez said about a 1-0 loss. "There were a few players on the
team who felt I was doing the wrong things at times. We had a meeting
the next day and I basically told them that I was the coach and we
were going to do things my way."</TE>
<TE>   Nogales is 2-0-1 since.</TE>

<HD>Injuries, Illness Still Among Big Concerns</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The season resumes Thursday for the Clippers but some of the issues
that plagued the first half are still present--particularly the issue
of health.</LD>
<LD>   Earl Boykins was excused from Tuesday's practice because of a
gastrointestinal infection. He will stay home a couple of days and is
questionable for Thursday's home game against San Antonio.</LD>
<LD>   Jeff McInnis also had a stomach virus but worked out.</LD>
<TE>   Lamar Odom (wrist) and Keyon Dooling (sprained left ankle) were
scheduled to have their injuries evaluated after Tuesday's practice
by team physician John Daly. Even if the cast is removed today from
Odom's wrist, there would be no timetable for his return. But
Dooling, who practiced extensively for the first time since November,
could be activated.</TE>
<TE>   "He's getting closer," Coach Alvin Gentry said of Dooling. "It's a
day-to-day thing. You don't know when he's going to get past that
pain part and do all the things he used to do. It's an injury that
takes awhile [to heal]. But I thought he had his best day of
practice. And no one's worked harder on rehab, I call tell you that
now."</TE>
<TE>   Dooling said there is a little swelling around the left ankle. He
knows he needs his lateral movement back to score and defend.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not as quick as I usually am but I'm getting there," Dooling
said. "It's to the point now I've got to play through it until I get
everything back.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first time I've been injured to this extent. It's
been tough on me mentally, but it happens. I'm just looking forward
to getting back out there."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reserve forward Harold Jamison also was not at practice but his
absence was not excused. Gentry did not appear overly concerned.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a very responsible guy,'' Gentry said. "Obviously, he will
be fined, and I don't know what that is right now. But he's never
been late for anything before.</TE>
<TE>   "He can have one goof but it will be a costly goof."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Michael Olowokandi was solid (20 points, 12 rebounds) in the last
meeting with San Antonio, won by the Clippers, 91-87, on Jan. 31. So
he doesn't think the Spurs will be so quick to have only Tim Duncan
or David Robinson defend him.</TE>
<TE>   "This game is all about adjustments," Olowokandi said. "We'll make
some, and they will too. I imagine they will send some other people
at me and try to throw me off rhythm.</TE>
<TE>   "But if it's one-on-one again I'll be happy. You look forward to
playing real centers in the NBA. Most have a lot of pride and want to
play you by themselves."</TE>

<LD>A consumer's guide to the best and worst of sports media and
merchandise. Ground rules: If it can be read, played, heard,
observed, worn, viewed, dialed or downloaded, it's in play here.</LD>
<LD>   What: "SportsCentury: Florence Griffith Joyner"</LD>
<LD>   Where: ESPN, today, 4:30 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   As part of Black History Month, ESPN has chosen to revisit the
Florence Griffith Joyner story. Unfortunately, it's a story that
always will be shrouded by questions of possible
performance-enhancing drug use. They are questions that never seem to
go away, not even 3 1/2 years after her death at age 38.</TE>
<TE>   This half-hour profile focuses too heavily on those questions.
There still are no answers, and this show really offers no new
perspectives.</TE>
<TE>   But maybe any Griffith Joyner profile would be guilty of overdoing
the drug rumors. Lifetime aired a one-hour profile during Black
History Month two years ago; it too dealt with the drug issue.</TE>
<TE>   It just seems that this ESPN profile stresses that aspect too
much.</TE>
<TE>   One interesting topic this show touches on is that Griffith Joyner
fired her coach, Bob Kersee, one week after the 1988 U.S. Olympic
trials. Maybe there's a parallel with Michele Kwan there somewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Griffith Joyner replaced Kersee with her husband, Al Joyner, and
you could say things turned out all right, considering FloJo, as she
came to be known, shocked the track and field world at the 1988
Summer Olympics at Seoul.</TE>
<TE>   Her performance in Seoul capped an incredible year. Her athletic
accomplishments are certainly a big part of the show, as is her
beauty. Host Chris Fowler, in the opening, calls Griffith Joyner "the
most flamboyant member of track and field's first family."</TE>
<TE>   No question she was flamboyant. "You never knew what to look for
first, her hair, her nails, her outfit or her time on the track,"
journalist Christine Brennan says.</TE>
<TE>   Muscle structure is something else people always looked for, as
well. They wondered how she became so muscular so quickly. They also
wondered why she retired so abruptly in February 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Those are questions that may never be answered, and apparently
they are questions that may never go away.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Mighty Duck captain Paul Kariya has his mind focused on tonight's
game against Calgary, but the moment he has waited for is close.
Starting Friday, Kariya will play for Team Canada in the Olympics.</LD>
<LD>   It has been eight years since Kariya, then an amateur, played in
the Olympics. He missed the 1998 games because of a concussion.</LD>
<LD>   "When I have played for Canada in the Olympics or World
Championships or World Juniors, we always had the expectation that
anything less than a gold is unacceptable," Kariya said.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defensemen Oleg Tverdovsky (Russia) and Ruslan Salei (Belarus)
also will compete in the Olympics. In fact, they face each other
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "All I can say, if they play Oleg on that team, that says
everything," Salei joked. "They are pretty weak."</TE>

Bryan Murray said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As if to help compensate for every key teammate they have lost,
members of the Placentia El Dorado girls' soccer team are turning in
record-setting performances.</LD>
<LD>   Freshman goalkeeper Kirstin Radlinski, for example, has posted a
school-record 14 shutouts after taking over for Tawnya Patino and
Ashly Vale.</LD>
<LD>   Patino, last season's starting goalie, got an after-school job and
opted not to play this season. Vale, her back-up, suffered a broken
leg over the summer and has yet to play this season.</LD>
<TE>   The Golden Hawks also lost last season's leading scorer, Vanessa
Chanez, who quit the team before the season because of "a personality
conflict" with her coach, according to Coach Juan Mares, in his third
season.</TE>
<TE>   But the return of junior forward Tasia Duarte, who didn't play for
El Dorado last season to focus on club soccer, has eased that loss.
Duarte, with 20 goals and 11 assists, leads an offense-minded team
that has a school-record 81 goals.</TE>
<TE>   The Golden Hawks (20-3-3, 9-1) have outscored their opponents,
81-12, overall and, 41-4, in league play en route to the Empire
League title and a school-record number of victories.</TE>
<TE>   With a nine-game winning streak since a Jan. 8 loss to Anaheim
Loara, and victories in 13 of their last 14 games, they enter the
Southern Section Division III playoffs with momentum.</TE>
<TE>   "I was kind of skeptical about how it was going to go at first,
but I think we've all kind of picked it up," said senior forward
Robin Bennett, who has returned from knee surgery last May to tally
12 goals and 12 assists.</TE>
<TE>   Duarte and Bennett are two of four players who have scored 12
goals or more. Center midfielder Darci Gwartz, who has 19 goals and
five assists, and junior forward Vanessa Lewis (12 goals) are the
others.</TE>
<TE>   The Golden Hawks, semifinalists for the first time in Division II
last season, face Anaheim Savanna, the third-place finisher in the
Orange League, in the first round of Division III playoffs on
Saturday at El Dorado.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Change is good: Anaheim Esperanza still features the same players
it has had for the last three seasons. Arizona-bound Erin Clewett and
USC-bound Heather Jablonsky just haven't been in their usual places.</TE>
<TE>   Clewett, a forward for her first three seasons at Esperanza, has
been switched to midfielder, and Jablonsky, a midfielder in the past,
has been moved up front by first-year Coach John King.</TE>
<TE>   The changes may have taken a little getting used to, but the girls
have made it look easy.</TE>
<TE>   "It was kind of a big change for me," Clewett said. "I wasn't too
happy at first, but it's worked out good. We're winning, so I guess
I'm doing my job right."</TE>
<TE>   Clewett has a team-high nine goals to go with four assists. She
has 43 career goals, surpassing the school record of Kim Gallo, who
had 40 from 1993-1997. Clewett also is the school's all-time leader
in points with 115. Gallo held the previous record with 98.</TE>
<TE>   Jablonsky has eight goals and nine assists this season and 30
goals and a school-record 43 assists in her career.</TE>

<LD>For the second time in three racing days, Santa Anita is offering a
good third race.</LD>
<LD>   On Saturday, stakes winners Sky Jack and Futural returned to
racing. The finish of the one-mile race was thrilling as Reba's Gold
defeated Sky Jack by a nose. Futural was a distant third.</LD>
<LD>   This afternoon, two graded stakes winners will race--along with
four others--in a six-furlong contest.</LD>
<TE>   Early Flyer, who will break from the rail, is the most
accomplished member of the field. Owned by Verne Winchell's VHW
Stables and trained by Ron McAnally, the Gilded Time colt won the
Grade II San Vicente over this track last year, and returned almost
four months later to defeated eventual Breeders' Cup Sprint winner
Squirtle Squirt in the Grade III Lazaro Barrera at Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   Best known for his victories in the Baldwin Stakes locally and the
Bay Shore at Aqueduct last spring, Skip To The Stone will be making
his first start since finishing fourth in the aforementioned Barrera.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The seventh drew a full field of 10 going about
61/2 furlongs on the turf. Contention runs deep.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Lorenzo Lezcano. The apprentice jockey has 53 wins at
Aqueduct, 12 more than runner-up Javier Castellano.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Shah Jehan, a $4.4-million purchase, was last in
Friday's Sham Stakes at Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking:  A pick three singling Stage Knight in the
second, using Skip To The Stone and Impressive Grades in the third
and Pleasantly Perfect, Soud, Set For More and Sunset Rock in the
fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 6/105. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $32.80/$645.40. Total money bet: $596.</TE>

<HD>Buchberger to Be Honored</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Kings will scatter far and wide after tonight's game. Four will
spend the Olympic break in Salt Lake City--Adam Deadmarsh and Aaron
Miller playing for the United States, Mattias Norstrom for Sweden and
Mikko Eloranta for Finland.</LD>
<LD>   Others will spend the time soaking up the sun from Hawaii to Cabo
San Lucas to San Diego. Kelly Buchberger will spend the weekend in
Moose Jaw, Canada, a city of about 35,000 where the temperature this
time of the year is about minus-25 degrees.</LD>
<LD>   Buchberger, who won three Stanley Cup championships with the
Edmonton Oilers, played junior hockey for the Moose Jaw Warriors, who
will retire his jersey No. 24 before Saturday night's game against
the Prince Albert Raiders.</LD>
<TE>   "It's an honor," said Buchberger, who grew up about three hours
east of Moose Jaw in Langenburg. "It's such a privilege just to play
the game and then to get recognized later on in your career is just
an added bonus."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Buchberger, more a scraper than a scorer, earned a surprising
distinction when he registered the 26th game-winning goal of his
career in Thursday night's 2-1 victory over Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   The goal was the 100th of his career, giving the 35-year-old
forward the highest percentage of game-winning goals in NHL history
for players with at least 100 goals, according to the Elias Sports
Bureau.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't even know they kept such a stat," said Buchberger, who
has played in 1,015 NHL games, averaging a little less than one goal
every 10 games.</TE>

<HD>Lue Is Inspired by Jordan</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The media mob around him was so tight, he barely had room to dress in
the Washington Wizard locker room. Encircled by microphones, cameras
and pads, he spun in all directions to field the volley of questions
coming his way, patiently dealing with each one.</LD>
<LD>   Tuesday, he was the Wizard everybody wanted to talk to, the man
who had returned to Los Angeles hoping to build upon his reputation.</LD>
<LD>   The face is so familiar. So's the name: Tyronn Lue.</LD>
<TE>   While that other well-known Wizard, Michael Jordan, doesn't talk
before games, Lue, a Laker for three seasons and a defensive force in
last year's NBA Finals before signing with Washington as a free
agent, was more than happy to talk about life with Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   "I played with Shaq [O'Neal] and Kobe [Bryant] and now I'm playing
with Michael," Lue said. "I've been blessed is all I can say."</TE>
<TE>   Lue was hoping to get more playing time with the Wizards. But, he
said, his anticipation turned to awe when it became official that
Jordan was coming back.</TE>
<TE>   "All the guys were in awe," Lue said.</TE>
<TE>   And for awhile, the Wizards found themselves unable to function.</TE>
<TE>   More of a fan club than a ballclub, the team lost nine of its
first 11 games.</TE>
<TE>   "The guys looked for Michael to do too much," Lue said. "It
changed when Michael said, 'Look at me as at teammate, not as the
president of the team.' When we did that, we started to win games."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Lue is still in awe, and it's a learning experience.</TE>
<TE>   "I learn just from the way he carries himself," Lue said, "both on
and off the court."</TE>
<TE>   But Lue has learned, as so many others have over the years, you
step on Superman's cape only at your own risk.</TE>
<TE>   "In practice, we were teasing him about his three-point shooting,"
Lue said. "He said, 'Let's go.' I've gone up against him, but I
haven't beaten him yet."</TE>
<TE>   The 6-0, 183-pound Lue was averaging 14.6 minutes before Tuesday
night, 4.0 points and 2.8 assists.</TE>
<TE>   Before the game, Laker General Manager Mitch Kupchak presented Lue
with his championship ring from last season.</TE>

<HD>Kobe Is Wizard of Awes</HD>
<DH>Lakers: Bryant gets 15 assists, the most in his career, and
third triple-double as Los Angeles rallies from 20-point deficit to
beat Washington, 103-94.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was billed as Air Jordan against the heir apparent.</LD>
<LD>   And by the end of Tuesday night's regular-season game between the
Lakers and Washington Wizards, which had Staples Center crackling
with postseason energy and excitement, it was plainly apparent that
Kobe Bryant has the talent, the focus and the determination to fill
the high-flying shoes of Michael Jordan.</LD>
<LD>   With Bryant leading a spirited rally from a 20-point third-period
deficit, the Lakers beat the Wizards, 103-94, in front of a sellout
crowd of 18,997.</LD>
<TE>   Responding to the challenge of a face-to-face meeting with Jordan
and cognizant of the need to fill the gaping hole in the middle left
by the absence of injured center Shaquille O'Neal, Bryant came up
with one of the most complete games of his career. His third
triple-double of his career consisted of 23 points, 11 rebounds and
15 assists, also the best in his career.</TE>
<TE>   "I looked at this as a chance to show the world what we could do,"
Bryant said.</TE>
<TE>   Was he also eager to show Jordan what he could do?</TE>
<TE>   "It was all business," Bryant said.</TE>
<TE>   Laker Coach Phil Jackson enjoyed his first head-to-head meeting
with the player who led his Chicago Bull teams to six NBA titles.</TE>
<TE>   "Some things started going on out there on the floor that were
interesting," Jackson said. "And comments were made, but it turned
out to be fun."</TE>
<TE>   For nearly 32 minutes, the only thing apparent was the air between
the Lakers' shots and the basket.</TE>
<TE>   Shooting only 32.6% in the first half, their defense spotty, their
rhythm off, the Lakers fell behind the Wizards by 20 points midway
through the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant was two for nine, Rick Fox one for five, Derek Fisher three
for nine.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not know what happened in the first half," Jackson said. "I
think we kind of stumbled around. It was an ambulant state, but we
got it going after we were 20 down.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess desperation is our answer to our playing basketball
tonight."</TE>
<TE>   With such a lead in the hands of a Jordan-led team, such a
comeback would not have seemed possible when Air Jordan ruled the NBA
skies.</TE>
<TE>   But this is another era. Jordan turns 39 Sunday, and his age
showed at the most crucial time in the game, what used to be his
time.</TE>
<TE>   With the Lakers down, 63-43, and 7:50 remaining in the third
quarter, Bryant began the long road back with a free throw.</TE>
<TE>   That started the Lakers on an 8-0 run, which would mushroom into a
34-11run by quarter's end. At one point in that run, Bryant scored
six of the eight Laker points, hitting on a free throw, a jump shot,
a layup off a steal and another free throw.</TE>
<TE>   And there were other heroes as well. Slava Medvedenko and Mark
Madsen, trying to supply some bulk and force up front to make up for
O'Neal, who is on the injured list because of his chronic toe injury,
also had their moments.</TE>
<TE>   Madsen scored on a spinning baseline turnaround jumper, moving and
gyrating much as he did last summer on the victory platform during
the championship celebration, to bring the Lakers within 73-68.</TE>
<TE>   Medvedenko got a tip-in to tie the score at 74.</TE>
<TE>   And then Brian Shaw made a three-pointer with three-tenths of a
second remaining in the third quarter to put the Lakers out in front,
77-74.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we just lost our composure and I'm a part of that,"
Jordan said.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan finished with 22 points, making only eight for 20 from the
floor. His shooting, however, wasn't that much different from
Bryant's, the Laker guard connecting on only nine of 20.</TE>
<TE>   While Jordan was unable to sustain a Wizard win streak that had
reached five straight, improving Washington to 26-21 before the game,
Bryant pulled the Lakers out of the valley.</TE>

<LD>Peja Stojakovic scored 23 points Tuesday night and the Kings used a
big second-quarter effort to defeat the San Antonio Spurs, 99-86, at
Sacra- mento.</LD>
<LD>   The Kings won their 19th in a row at Arco Arena and improved to a
league-best 26-1 at home.</LD>
<LD>   Chris Webber had 20 points, 12 rebounds and five blocks for the
Kings, who ran off nine consecutive points early in the second
quarter en route to outscoring the Spurs, 32-16, in the quarter.</LD>
<TE>   Tim Duncan had 24 points and 21 rebounds for the Spurs, who have
lost three in a row to the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 110, Denver 93--Antoine Walker finished with 30 points, 14
assists and 12 rebounds, and the Celtics outscored the Nuggets, 23-5,
over a span of 4:44 late in the third quarter and early in the fourth
to pull away at Denver.</TE>
<TE>   The frustration of the Nuggets' fans spilled over into persistent
booing of Nick Van Exel late in the game.</TE>
<TE>   Van Exel, the Nuggets' leading scorer who went public Dec. 8 with
a demand to be traded, has been late for practice twice in the last
two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Because of his latest infraction, on Monday, Van Exel didn't start
against the Celtics. He played 26 minutes and scored 12 points.</TE>
<TE>   As boos were directed at him late in the game, the point guard
waved his fingers in a bring-it-on motion.</TE>
<TE>   Van Exel's only comment after the game, "You've got the wrong
locker."</TE>
<TE>   Van Exel and center Raef LaFrentz have been the subject of recent
trade speculation.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 112, Seattle 106--Steve Nash scored 28 points, including
five three-pointers, and the Mavericks won a franchise-record eighth
consecutive road game.</TE>
<TE>   Nash had 15 points in the first quarter, when the Mavericks shot
72.7% (16 for 22) and scored 39 points.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 85, Memphis 78--Cuttino Mobley scored 26 points and
Moochie Norris had 21 at Houston, and the Rockets won without Steve
Francis for only the second time in 21 games this season.</TE>
<TE>   Francis sat out again with a migraine headache.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 96, Milwaukee 92--Ron Artest, who scored 22 points, made a
steal and a three-point basket in the Bulls' fourth-quarter rally at
Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago began the fourth quarter with a 20-4 run, erasing an
11-point deficit. Ray Allen scored 32 points for the Bucks, who have
lost six of eight.</TE>
<TE>   Utah 98, Indiana 82--Karl Malone had 34 points, 14 rebounds, six
assists and five steals at Indianapolis, helping the Jazz end a
two-game skid and extending Indiana's losing streak to three games.</TE>
<TE>   The Jazz had 17 offensive rebounds, including eight in the third
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 99, Toronto 81--Andre Miller had 22 points, 17 assists

<LD>In an unprecedented move, baseball owners unanimously approved the
takeover of the Montreal Expos by the commissioner's office and the
sale of the Florida Marlins to Montreal's current owner.</LD>
<LD>   Tuesday's votes came three days before teams begin spring training
and created management shifts. Montreal Manager Jeff Torborg resigned
and became Florida's manager, and Hall of Famer Frank Robinson, who
was major league baseball's vice president of on-field discipline,
was appointed Montreal's manager.</LD>
<LD>   Larry Beinfest, who had been the Expos' interim general manager,
resigned to become Florida's general manager and was replaced by Omar
Minaya, who had been senior assistant general manager of the New York
Mets.</LD>
<TE>   Tony Tavares, who resigned last month as Angel president, was
appointed Montreal's president by Commissioner Bud Selig.</TE>
<TE>   "From this day forward, in terms of the decisions they make, they
are on their own," Selig said about the Montreal people in a
conference call.</TE>
<TE>   Selig made no assurances that the Expos, who joined the National
League in 1969, would survive beyond the 2002 season. He promised the
Expos would be run independently and that their top young players,
such as Vladimir Guerrero, wouldn't be traded.</TE>
<TE>   The only previous time a major league team was owned by a league
or the commissioner's office was briefly between the 1942 and 1943
seasons, according to research by the Hall of Fame and the Elias
Sport Bureau.</TE>
<TE>   The National League took over the Philadelphia Phillies on Feb. 9
from Gerald Nugent, who fell behind in his rent at Shibe Park, and
sold the team on March 15 to William D. Cox, who later was banned for
life by then-commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis for gambling on
Phillies' games.</TE>
<TE>   Current Marlin owner John Henry heads a group that received
approval Jan. 16 to buy the Boston Red Sox for $660 million from the
Jean R. Yawkey Trust.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey Loria is buying the Marlins from Henry for $158.5 million
and selling the Expos for $120 million to Baseball Expos LP, a
Delaware limited partnership owned by the other 29 teams. The
commissioner's office is lending him the difference between the
prices.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Paul Abbott and the Seattle Mariners agreed to a one-year contract
worth $3,425,000.... Designated hitter David Ortiz signed a $950,000,
one-year contract with the Minnesota Twins.... Reliever Tim Crabtree,
32, signed a minor league contract with the Dodgers and was invited
to spring training as a nonroster player. He was 0-5 with a 6.56
earned-run average with the Texas Rangers last season.</TE>

co-founder and retired chairman of The Home Depot, was completed....
PSINet Inc. has filed a request in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York
to take its name, displayed in a neon purple logo, off the Baltimore
Ravens' stadium. The Internet company and the Ravens have agreed to
terminate a 20-year, $105-million contract that gave PSINet naming
rights to the stadium.... Jacksonville signed offensive tackle Chris
Ziemann, who had been with the New York Giants the last two
seasons.... Fullback Joey Goodspeed, out of football last year,
signed a one-year contract with San Diego. Goodspeed first signed
with Pittsburgh in 2000 out of Notre Dame.</TE>

<DH>Oklahoma Women's Team Joins Men Near Top of National
Rankings</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NORMAN, Okla.</DL>
<LD>Oklahoma Coach Sherri Coale remembers her disbelief in 1990 when she
heard the news from another teacher at Norman High.</LD>
<LD>   "Oklahoma just dropped women's basketball."</LD>
<LD>   Coale, coach of the high school's girls' team at the time, was
quick with her response.</LD>
<TE>   "They can't do that."</TE>
<TE>   Her fellow teacher shrugged: "They just did."</TE>
<TE>   Coale didn't hesitate.</TE>
<TE>   "Trust me, they can't."</TE>
<TE>   She was right, of course.</TE>
<TE>   Within days, a furor erupted at the women's Final Four. A famous
lawyer started preparing a Title IX lawsuit and soon Oklahoma's
athletic department reversed field faster than Billy Sims.</TE>
<TE>   A dozen years later--and six seasons after Coale took over as
Oklahoma's coach--the Sooner women are 20-2 and ranked No. 4 in the
nation.</TE>
<TE>   So are the 19-3 Sooner men--a coincidence that makes Oklahoma the
only school other than Duke whose men's and women's programs are in
the top five.</TE>
<TE>   In a state where football and wrestling cast large shadows,
basketball is having its day.</TE>
<TE>   It might not have the lore of Indiana or North Carolina, but
Oklahoma has a rich basketball history.</TE>
<TE>   Henry Iba won consecutive NCAA titles in 1945 and '46 at Oklahoma
State, once known as Oklahoma A&amp;M.</TE>
<TE>   He coached in Stillwater for 36 years beginning in 1934, made Bob
Kurland the first celebrated 7-footer and influenced coaches from Don
Haskins and Eddie Sutton, who played for him, to Bob Knight, who
considered him a close friend.</TE>
<TE>   At Oklahoma City University, Abe Lemons kept the basketball world
in stitches.</TE>
<TE>   At Oklahoma, Billy Tubbs guided the Sooners to the 1988 NCAA title
game against Kansas with a team that included Mookie Blaylock and
Harvey Grant.</TE>
<TE>   And Sutton returned to his alma mater in 1990, taking Oklahoma
State to the Final Four in 1995, where the Cowboys and Bryant "Big
Country" Reeves lost in the semifinals to UCLA's last NCAA
championship team.</TE>
<TE>   It's a state with a wealth of NAIA and junior college programs as
well. But tonight, the eyes of Oklahoma fall on raucous Gallagher-Iba
Arena in Stillwater, where the Oklahoma men visit 16th-ranked
Oklahoma State in the season's second episode of Bedlam, as the
rivalry is called. (Oklahoma won the first game, 58-53.)</TE>
<TE>   With a population that isn't that much larger than Orange
County's, Oklahoma schools sometimes must search far a field for
players.</TE>
<TE>   "Think about it, it's a state of three million people," said
Oklahoma Coach Kelvin Sampson, who took the Sooners to the Sweet 16
in 1999 with a team led by Mexico native Eduardo Najera.</TE>
<TE>   "This year, there are seven or eight kids from Oklahoma who will
play top-level Division I basketball. But typically, it varies from
zero to eight. Some years, there are no kids at all recruited by OU
or Oklahoma State."</TE>
<TE>   At Oklahoma State, Sutton has five players from Oklahoma, but the
Cowboys' best player is senior guard Maurice Baker, who went to high
school in Illinois and played junior college ball in Utah.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma has only two players from the state--led by junior Ebi
Ere, a 6-foot-5 guard from Tulsa.</TE>
<TE>   "He's about as Oklahoma as you can get," Sampson said.</TE>
<TE>   "My father is Nigerian," Ere said. "But I've never lived anywhere
except Oklahoma and Kansas, when I went to junior college."</TE>
<TE>   The Sooners' top scorer and emotional leader is junior guard
Hollis Price, a New Orleans native who overcame a nasty injury in a
first-round NCAA tournament loss last season that left a piece of an
Indiana State player's tooth in his right elbow and required three
surgeries to correct.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd never heard of Oklahoma," he said, though he's found a home
there. "If I go out to a club in New Orleans, I might stay out 'til
4:30. Here, everything's closed by 2."</TE>
<TE>   It's easier to find women's basketball players on the recruiting
trail in Oklahoma--partly because football and wrestling don't drain
away athletes--because girls' basketball has a long tradition, even
if it was the six-on-six variety for many years.</TE>
<TE>   Five of Coale's players are from the state--one of them Shannon
Selmon, the daughter of Dewey Selmon of the famous Selmon brothers
who played football at Oklahoma in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Another home-grown player is senior guard LaNeisha Caufield, one
of 20 finalists for the Naismith national player of the year award.</TE>
<TE>   But three of the Oklahoma women's players are from
Canada--including the best, Stacey Dales, a 6-foot senior point guard
who played for the Canadian Olympic team in Sydney.</TE>
<TE>   A first-team All-American last year, Dales is also among the
Naismith finalists.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm from the midst of big cities--Ottawa, Toronto, Montreal,"
said Dales, who is from Brockville, Ontario. "No, to the common
cliche, we don't live in igloos.</TE>
<TE>   "I had this girl in Oklahoma ask me, 'Where's Canada?'</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, on the other side of that, I had said, 'Where's
Oklahoma?' I really did have to pull out an atlas and take a look at
where Oklahoma was before I came here. But it's a really simple
place. I tend to be high-strung. I think it's good for me."</TE>
<TE>   The feeling is mutual.</TE>
<TE>   Coale took over in 1996, and it wasn't until Dales arrived in 1998
that the program finally emerged from the uncertainty after its brush
with death in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   "I spent my first two years here just rehashing that," Coale said.
"Every home visit, if they didn't know the history, the people
recruiting against us certainly were going to tell them."</TE>
<TE>   These are heady days for Oklahoma basketball--and a good time for
most Sooner sports.</TE>
<TE>   The football team finished sixth in the nation, both basketball
teams are in the top five, and men's and women's gymnastics,
wrestling and softball are in the top 10.</TE>
<TE>   The revenue generated by football helps, and Oklahoma doesn't seem
to have much difficulty with raising funds, either.</TE>
<TE>   At the Lloyd Noble Center where Oklahoma plays basketball, a new
$17-million, 63,000-square-foot addition is being completed.</TE>
<TE>   There are joint medical and weight-room facilities for the men's
and women's basketball teams, separate-but-equal coaches' offices,
film rooms and lavish locker rooms--along with pro-style players'
lounges equipped with a television, video games and overstuffed
leather chairs.</TE>
<TE>   Athletic Director Joe Castiglione--who arrived in 1998, long after
the women's basketball uproar--urged Coale and Sampson to ask for
everything they'd want in the building.</TE>
<TE>   The centerpiece is stunning twin practice arenas--one for the
women, one for the men--that make the typical stories obsolete about
men's teams running the women off the court or forcing them to
practice in the evening or wee hours of the morning.</TE>
<TE>   With all they have in common, Oklahoma's fourth-ranked men and
women only hope they'll end the season in the same place.</TE>
<TE>   "We set a goal," said Price, whose team has beaten No. 3 Maryland
by 16 points at home but lost to No. 2 Kansas by eight on the road.</TE>
<TE>   The players say it together in the huddle: "Final Four."</TE>
<TE>   The women have the same goal, and despite a 14-point loss at
undefeated and top-ranked Connecticut, they say they'd like to see
Coach Geno Auriemma's team again.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they're the favorite," Coale said. "But I don't think the
gap's as large as before."</TE>

<LD>If all goes as expected in short-track speedskating at these
Olympics, plan on seeing plenty of Apolo Anton Ohno in the future.</LD>
<LD>   On the early-morning and late-night TV show circuit, maybe on a
cereal box. You know, the usual fare of Olympic champions.</LD>
<LD>   Ohno should have a star resume.</LD>
<TE>   He's good; he's the unquestioned leader of the U.S. team; he's
controversial; and, if everything goes the way many are predicting,
he will leave these Games with four medals, possibly all gold, and
several records.</TE>
<TE>   Last season's overwhelming World Cup champion, he is favored in
each of the men's individual events--the 500-, 1,000- and 1,500-meter
races--and, along with teammates Rusty Smith, Ron Biondo and Daniel
Weinstein, figures to be in the thick of things in the 5,000-meter
relay. The competition begins today at the Salt Lake Ice Center with
the preliminaries in the men's 1,000 and the relay, and the women's
final in the 1,500.</TE>
<TE>   Ohno, at least publicly, says the expectations set for him are a
tad on the high side.</TE>
<TE>   "A sweep? Four gold medals? That's almost impossible," he said.
"In short track, anything can happen [to mess up a skater's race].
I'll consider this a successful Olympics if I walk away from all the
races knowing I did my best. I know I'm prepared, and I know I'm
ready."</TE>
<TE>   Teammate Weinstein, a Harvard man, figures Ohno is being modest.</TE>
<TE>   "The way I see it, Apolo is a step up from everybody else in the
world," he said. "He says four golds are impossible. For him, it's
possible.... He's the World Cup champion, and I think people in other
countries, even if they don't say it, think he's the best. I think
he'll do awesome."</TE>
<TE>   If he does, it will be the culmination of an unusual pre-Olympic
period for him. A week after the Olympic trials here in late
December, Ohno and Smith were accused by teammate Tommy O'Hare of
rigging the final qualifying race--at O'Hare's expense--so their
friend, Shani Davis, could win and qualify for the Games. Ohno and
Smith both denied the allegation, and skating officials said it was
odd that O'Hare had waited so long to lodge his protest. Still, there
was a chance that Ohno and Smith could have been dismissed from the
team. Instead, they were cleared in an arbitration hearing and O'Hare
withdrew his charge.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a distraction at the time, but I was always confident of
the outcome," Ohno said. "Now I'm ready to do my thing and perform
the best I can."</TE>
<TE>   Smith, who skated for the U.S. at Nagano, also figures in the
medals picture, especially in the 500.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the U.S. women are battling illness. Amy Peterson, a
three-time Olympic medalist competing in her fifth Games, is once
again battling chronic fatigue syndrome, the disease she fought
through at Nagano, just as long-track star Chris Witty is battling
mononucleosis.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a good day, then a bad day," Peterson said. "But I'm in a
better place than I was two or three months ago, so, hopefully, I can
stay on an upswing. I just worry about letting the team down."</TE>
<TE>   Not to worry, said teammate Caroline Hallisey.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there's any way Amy could ever let the girls' team
down, ever," she said. "No matter if she's having what she thinks is
a down day, she's going to help us."</TE>
<TE>   A topic of conversation at the Games has been the home-field
advantage, because athletes have practiced and competed at venues
here for years. That doesn't apply to the short-trackers, though.
They will be skating in the Salt Lake Ice Center. The U.S. team had
its Olympic qualifying races and hosted a competition there this
season, but, except for the crowd, would seem to have no edge.</TE>

<LD>Figure skater Sasha Cohen of Laguna Niguel, who left Salt Lake City
after the opening ceremony to train at home, will return Friday and
will resume practicing on Olympic ice Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Her coach, John Nicks, said Tuesday her practices at Aliso Viejo
have been going well and added they planned to work at altitude in
Lake Arrowhead on Tuesday and today to reinforce her conditioning.</LD>
<LD>   Nicks also said the only change in her programs will be doing the
triple lutz-triple toe loop combination jump she didn't do in her
long program in finishing second to Michelle Kwan at last month's
U.S. championships.</LD>
<TE>   "Most of the girls have the triple-triple combination, although
most are not secure," he said. "Doing that could be the difference
for a medal."</TE>
<TE>   Kwan is the only member of the U.S. women's delegation who stayed
in Salt Lake City this week for practices. Sarah Hughes, third at the
U.S. nationals, has been skating in Colorado Springs, Colo.</TE>
<TE>   Returning home to train in familiar surroundings has worked out
well, Nicks said.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact of the matter is you're never as comfortable as you are
training at your home base, under conditions you're used to," he
said. "I think the Olympic village is a wonderful experience for
kids, but sometimes it's not the best place to be when you've got to
focus on training."</TE>

<TE>   Steroid levels 1,000 times the limit were found in a Latvian
bobsledder allowed to compete at the Olympics despite a failed drug
test and a series of moves to ban him.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Christiane Ayot, whose IOC-accredited lab in Montreal ran the
test, said the international bobsled federation apparently ignored
the results when it imposed a retroactive three-month ban on Sandis
Prusis. The ban ended just before Olympic competition.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe they had already made up their mind" and accepted
Prusis' argument that the drug was contained in legal food
supplements, said Ayot, who is helping the International Olympic
Committee's medical commission during the Winter Games.</TE>
<TE>   She also said the chance that Prusis absorbed such a high amount
of the drug in contaminated supplements was very small.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Storey, president of the bobsled federation FIBT, said
Ayot's claim that his group ignored the results was "absolutely
untrue."</TE>
<TE>   Though he would not comment on the exact levels of the steroid in
Prusis' sample, he said independent experts told the FIBT that it was
possible the drug in the amounts found came from tainted food
supplements.</TE>
<TE>   Latvian Olympic and bobsled officials earlier indicated that the
level of nandrolone found in Prusis' sample was only slightly above
the limit of two nanograms per milliliter.</TE>

<LD>Just when you thought all snowboarders had a distinct two-syllable
vocabulary and a mandatory date of birth in the '80s, we introduce
the exception.</LD>
<LD>   Sondra Van Ert, former world champion in the giant slalom, was
born in 1964. She will turn 38 in March. For better perspective, she
could be Danny Kass' mother. The former owner of a paint store and
onetime land surveyor for Dick Fosbury (yes, as in Fosbury flop), Van
Ert has set an example for women who compete beyond age 30.</LD>
<LD>   "I hope so," she said. "Everyone here is about 10 to 12 years
younger. Sometimes, they're thinking, 'I'm old.' And then they look
at me."</LD>
<TE>   After all, age is a state of mind. She got into a van the other
day and snowboarder Kelly Clark had left some of her CDs behind. Van
Ert liked the music and planned on making some new purchases. Team
bonding was fun too, at Thunder Spring, Idaho. They competed in
tennis, using loose serving rules. "You didn't have to get it in the
box."</TE>
<TE>   The cross-generation thing is not much of a problem because Van
Ert has the ultimate slope credentials. She is still near the top,
ranking in the top five of the World Cup standings in five of the
last six years. The other snowboarders understand that language.</TE>
<TE>   Cold Calling? Ouch</TE>
<TE>   In the category of "how cold is it up there?":</TE>
<TE>   Richard Perelman, venue chief at the Soldier Hollow site, where
all the sledding and some ski jumping is being held, gets dozens of
cell phone calls every day, but he can't take any of them, unless you
catch him inside.</TE>
<TE>   "If I take those gloves off, I'll lose fingers," Perelman said,
"and I can't punch those little numbers on the cell phone with my
gloves on."</TE>
<TE>   Perelman said that his mountain venue can be pleasant at times,
but that once the sun goes down, the freeze is in.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got lots of night luge," Perelman said. "You'd enjoy that."</TE>
<TE>   And where did Perelman get his blood thickened in preparation for
all this? Los Angeles, where he is from, of course.</TE>
<TE>   Peacock Plucking</TE>
<TE>   Fast becoming a leading media conscience of the Games, TV critic
Howard Fendrich of the Associated Press on Tuesday took yet another
shot at his favorite target, NBC.</TE>
<TE>   Fendrich is fairly new and has this idealistic idea that NBC might
treat the Olympics like an event, rather than a vehicle to
manufacture various heart-tugging sagas. To this, Fendrich writes:
"In a flashback to the network's mawkish coverage of the Sydney
Olympics, Monday night's show opened with announcer Tom Hammond
discussing figure skaters Natalia Ponomareva and Evgeni Sviridov as
though they were characters in some 19th-century fable."</TE>
<TE>   He quotes Hammond as saying, "We have been following the special
Olympic story of Natalia and her broken foot. I don't know how many
people have come up to me since Saturday night, saying how much they
appreciated the special Olympic story of Natalia and skating with a
foot that's broken in two places."</TE>
<TE>   According to Fendrich, Hammond added, for good measure, "Natalia
and Evgeni skate for Uzbekistan, one of the U.S. allies in the war in
Afghanistan."</TE>
<TE>   And Fendrich's conclusion to all of this?</TE>
<TE>   "Pu-leeze. Natalia and her foot finished 18th, by the way."</TE>
<TE>   What, No Assist?</TE>
<TE>   The Olympic spirit apparently hasn't lit the fire within every
Utah resident.</TE>
<TE>   John Stockton, the notoriously standoffish Utah Jazz guard, was
sitting with his family at a Latvia-Slovakia hockey game when a fan
asked him to pose for a photo.</TE>
<TE>   Stockton refused.</TE>
<TE>   Not Forgotten</TE>
<TE>   Volunteers at the top of the men's downhill course have arranged
nine U.S. flags in a circle adjacent to another U.S. flag in memory
of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Some officials have pressured them to take it down, but they
refused.</TE>
<TE>   That's Not Funny</TE>
<TE>   Justice was finally served Tuesday night at the Olympics Medal
Plaza when host Bob Saget was nearly booed off the stage.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight, as scheduled, "Saturday Night Live" star Tracy Morgan
will replace him.</TE>

<HD>Jordan Is the Best Teacher the Wizards Could Have</HD>

<LD>Even though this is L.A. and all the famous people came to Staples
Center to see Michael Jordan, it didn't mean that Jordan was going to
score 50 points or do between-the-legs dribbling or Superman dunks
against your world champion Lakers.</LD>
<LD>   He did not come here to embarrass Kobe Bryant or prove himself to
us. He came here with the Washington Wizards to win another
basketball game and get into another NBA playoff series. It is a
professional's way, to have only one purpose, winning games.</LD>
<LD>   The Wizards didn't win. They led by 20 once, which should never
have happened. The Wizards aren't nearly good enough to lead the
Lakers by 20 even if Shaquille O'Neal has a sore toe and can't play.
The Lakers won, 103-94, and avoided another bad loss.</LD>
<TE>   And it was good Jordan didn't come here to be involved in a
spectacular battle with Bryant. That gave the Lakers a chance to see
what it is that has brought Jordan back to the game, to see how
Jordan cherishes every bounce pass, every dribble, every rebound,
every time he must bend his knees and assume the defensive position.</TE>
<TE>   Every basketball instant is precious to Jordan. He doesn't expect
the Wizards to win an NBA title. He expects the young Wizards to play
a little harder, a little smarter, a little better every night. He
expects the young Wizards to eat right and work out right, to
practice long and hard, to pay attention to the floor-bound aspects
of the game as well as the high-flying ones.</TE>
<TE>   "You have a guy like Michael Jordan as your teammate, you better
pay attention to his every word," Popeye Jones said before the game.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan gave a little fist-pump when Jones made a 15-foot jump shot
at the start of the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The shot won't be on any highlight film but it was important to
the Wizards, who led by 13 at halftime, to not let the Lakers run off
a bunch of points to start the second half. It was important because
Jones has never been a reliable jump shooter. But in the NBA you
should be able to make that shot. Jordan appreciated that Jones did.</TE>
<TE>   "Michael teaches us something new about the game every day," Jones
said. "Little things that young guys don't always pay attention to."</TE>
<TE>   What Jordan sees is the game. He sees how to win a game in many
different ways. He sees himself as he is, a 38-year-old whose legs
aren't so springy, whose back isn't so strong, whose vision is so
different. His vision comes from the level of a chessboard and not
from the blimp. Jordan sees the floor and not the rim. This is not
better or worse, just different.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers could learn a little about heart from Jordan. According
to his teammates, Jordan still practices harder than anyone else
every day. He is not thrilled with loafing teammates, even in a
simple drill.</TE>
<TE>   It is easy for talented men like Bryant and O'Neal to get
distracted by things they shouldn't.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal's whining about Brad Miller and throwing a punch and his
coach, Phil Jackson, encouraging that whining, was unbecoming of a
champion. Bryant's very public dismay at being booed at the All-Star
game in his hometown? Jordan would never do that. Jordan would just
go back to Philadelphia and win, maybe by scoring 50 points or maybe
by holding Allen Iverson to 10 points.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan still anticipates the game better than the next nine best
players in the league. When Wizard center Jahidi White didn't make a
cut he should have midway through the third quarter, Jordan was
shaking his head almost before White should even have reached his
spot. As soon as a whistle blew, Jordan had his arm around White and
his mouth pressed to White's ear.</TE>
<TE>   What Jordan has coaxed from the Wizards this season is the
beginnings of that same feel for the game. It is as if the Washington
players have progressed from block printing to cursive writing.</TE>
<TE>   Things happen faster for them now. What that fifth pass means
makes sense. Proper spacing has become clear. When Jordan leaves
again, for good, people like Jones and White, Brendan Haywood,
Richard Hamilton, will have become better basketball players and
whatever teams they play for in the future will be better teams
because of what they learned from Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant got his head and his heart into this game in the third
quarter. He had 12 points and five assists. He ran full speed. He did
everything with commanding crispness. He ended up with the third
triple-double of his career. And when Bryant began playing that way,
the Lakers came from 20 points down to lead by three at the end of
the period and then to pull away in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing I've learned from Michael," White said, "is that every
single possession matters. He preaches how important it is to play
hard every single second. And that doesn't just mean in the game.
What you do in practice is what you do in games."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan plays the same in the first quarter as in the fourth and he
never waits for the third quarter. The crowd was never drawn to its
feet in admiration but the game was worth watching. Jordan always is.
And afterward, here's what Bryant said. "We're not here fighting for
every possession, not like world champions should do. We have to come
out and fight for every possession."</TE>
<TE>   Somebody paid attention.</TE>

<HD>Riviera Goes Retro</HD>
<DH>Hoping to Attract 2008 U.S. Open, Six Holes Are Modified to
Capture Original Design and Challenge the Modern Player</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID WHARTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tucked away in Riviera Country Club's grand, rambling clubhouse, up a
flight of stairs from the ornate lobby, is a small room lined with
shelves. Not much more than a closet, it holds sketches, photographs
and artifacts from a dimly recalled past.</LD>
<LD>   Black-and-white pictures show an unusual double fairway on the
eighth hole and a long bunker guarding the left side of the seventh,
elements washed away in a 1939 flood. Old drawings illustrate
original greens long since eroded or modified.</LD>
<LD>   When the club embarked on a mission to polish its faded
reputation--pining for the days of Ben Hogan and Sam Snead--this
archival storeroom was the first stop. "Looking at those photographs,
we decided to restore part of the original design," said Michael
Yamaki, the club's corporate officer.</LD>
<TE>   Then they went a step further. Or, some say, in another direction.</TE>
<TE>   They sought to update the layout, lengthening and toughening
several holes to accommodate the modern player who hits the ball
longer and straighter than Hogan might ever have imagined.</TE>
<TE>   Club executives hope this $1.3-million project, which involved six
holes, will help them in their bid to host the 2008 U.S. Open. At the
same time, however, they have heard grumbling from a noted golf
historian who likens their work to "putting a mustache on the Mona
Lisa."</TE>
<TE>   The first true test comes this week when the PGA Tour arrives for
the Nissan Open beginning Thursday. Everyone involved--including
officials who award the U.S. Open--will be watching.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time you do anything to a course like this, there are people
who want to criticize," head pro Todd Yoshitake said. "We're
interested to see what the pros say."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The pros started all this.</TE>
<TE>   Never mind the stately eucalyptus and sycamores, or the folklore
surrounding "Hogan's Alley." In 1995, the Tour came to Riviera for
the PGA Championship and handed the club a very public embarrassment,
players ridiculing the greens. A Japanese corporation that had taken
ownership a few years earlier decided that changes had to be made.</TE>
<TE>   First came a renewed effort to improve turf conditions. Next,
Riviera began working with Fazio Golf Course Designers, one of the
so-called "Open doctors" known for helping courses get selected for
the U.S. Open.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Marzolf, a senior design associate with the North
Carolina-based firm, was aware of the course's heritage but did not
expect to find so much documentation. Aerial photos chronicled the
work of George C. Thomas, the original designer, and the effect of
storm waters that overflowed the famed barranca, badly damaging
several holes.</TE>
<TE>   "You could see all the intricacies of the bunkering," Marzolf
said. "The subtleties of the landing areas, the contours, the
elevated greens."</TE>
<TE>   The depth of old hazards could be gauged by shadow lines on
photographs. Details were such that when workmen began digging to
re-create the lost bunker along No. 7, they hit sandy remnants of its
long-buried predecessor.</TE>
<TE>   Modernizing the course was not as straightforward.</TE>
<TE>   Marzolf pored over newspaper accounts of past tournaments, looking
for clues about which clubs players used from various lies. Yoshitake
called upon Snead and others to compare how the course played before
technological advances in clubs and balls.</TE>
<TE>   On the ninth hole, which once required caution, most of today's
players could easily carry the fairway bunker. On second shots where
Hogan might have hit a four-iron, big hitters now pulled a nine from
their bags.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted today's players to hit the same club as the great
players of the past," Marzolf said. "We wanted to put that four-iron
back in their hands."</TE>
<TE>   The designer had numerous conversations with club executives about
how this might be accomplished. The United States Golf Assn., which
oversees the U.S. Open, also got into the act, touring the course and
commenting on "the good, the bad and the ugly," as a USGA spokesman
put it.</TE>
<TE>   All the while, everyone realized that any changes might spark a
controversy reminiscent of a 1940s party in the main ballroom where
Errol Flynn tried to pick up another man's wife and was arrested.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to keep the integrity of the course," Yamaki said. "How
do you do that? I guess everyone has a different opinion."</TE>
<TE>   The most dramatic changes were made to holes that border the
barranca, the ones that took the brunt of the epic storm.</TE>
<TE>   On No. 7, the humped fairway is now guarded by the restored penal
bunker on the left and the barranca on the right. A shot to either
side will find trouble.</TE>
<TE>   On No. 8, workers added 46 yards and re-created the obliterated
right half of the split fairway. Players can still go left, choosing
to lay up in front of a bunker or try a power fade, leaving a wedge
to the green. The right side leaves a shorter iron shot.</TE>
<TE>   "Depending on the pin placement, the golfer now has a better angle
with which to approach the green, which has been slightly enlarged to
accept such shots," Yoshitake said.</TE>
<TE>   In Tuesday's practice rounds, the tee for the eighth hole was at
its farthest point, some 462 yards, so the right fairway was the one
the players used.</TE>
<TE>   "If it were up some, it might make a difference," Brent Geiberger
said. "But with the tee all the way back, the play is to the right
fairway."</TE>
<TE>   The official length for the eighth is 433 yards, but unless the
weather changes, it's likely the pros are going to play the hole from
its longest point.</TE>
<TE>   On No. 13, the tee has been lowered and the barranca comes back
into play, guarding the left side and the newly extended back portion
of the green.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, designers also added as much as 50 yards to Nos. 9
and 12, where Humphrey Bogart used to watch tournaments leaning
against a sycamore and sipping from what the late Times columnist Jim
Murray referred to as "a Thermos filled with God knows what." The tee
on No. 5 was returned to the top of a small hill, which brings the
wind into play and asks most golfers to hit a slight fade rather than
a draw.</TE>
<TE>   Yoshitake downplays the recent work, saying Riviera is known for
its variety, notably the pot bunker in the middle of the sixth green
and the blind tee shot on No. 18. He refers to new additions as
"polishing the jewel."</TE>
<TE>   But he gets an argument from Geoff Shackelford, who has written
two books about designer Thomas and the club's history. An
unapologetic traditionalist, Shackelford has spoken out against
modifications to courses such as Augusta National, Inverness and Oak
Hill.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen good restorations and bad ones," he said. "Riviera just
didn't do a good job of fitting features in."</TE>
<TE>   In particular, he criticizes the enlarged green on No. 13 and a
new, crowned front on No. 8. He says that when No. 7 had its original
bunker, the fairway was not humped, so there wasn't as much risk of
bouncing into sand or barranca.</TE>
<TE>   The historian sees the modifications as part of a trend: As
stronger players with better equipment manhandle older courses, as
scores dip lower and lower, clubs react by stretching their holes.
They add gimmicks that force players to lay up, thus nudging the
leaderboard back toward par.</TE>
<TE>   The victim in all this, he says, is strategy. Designs are thrown
out of whack as length takes precedence over classic quirks, those
tricky situations where a golfer must choose between playing it safe
or going for broke.</TE>
<TE>   "Tour players just hit it dead straight," he said. "You don't see
decision-making and you don't see shot shaping. It's just not as
interesting."</TE>
<TE>   Club executives, he believes, could have taken a less-invasive
approach to their U.S. Open bid.</TE>
<TE>   "They could say this is Riviera, this is Hogan's Alley," he said.
"They could add some back tees and grow the rough everything would be
fine."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The USGA will not decide on a site for the 2008 Open until its
executive committee reconvenes in June. With Torrey Pines also in the
running, the decision could be delayed until fall. But with the pros
rarely hesitant to voice their opinions about playing conditions,
Riviera should get an idea of where it stands this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Several lesser-known players, participating in Monday's
invitational pro-am, gave high marks. The big names had yet to
arrive.</TE>
<TE>   "That's something I'll be holding my breath about," Yamaki said.</TE>
<TE>   Marzolf will be on hand, charting shots, gauging whether the
course plays the way he envisioned. Sitting down for a conversation
with Shackelford at an industry convention in Florida last week, he
is open to criticism. "It's OK to have different thoughts on the
course," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the only people who will not openly express themselves are
club members who know they can be unilaterally expelled. A few years
ago, a one-time greens committee chairman was kicked out after
complaining to a golf magazine about maintenance practices.</TE>
<TE>   Yoshitake insisted he has heard mostly raves from his membership.
Sitting in the club's elegant dining room, nursing a soda, he pointed
out that Thomas returned several years after the course's 1927
opening and tinkered with holes, adding a new twist here, a bunker
there.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is, he passed away," Yoshitake said. "Who's to say
that he might not have come back and done something else."</TE>
<TE>   In his absence, club executives and modern designers took it upon
themselves to interpret his intentions. The archives, locked away in
an upstairs room, provided a research tool and inspiration.</TE>
<TE>   The black-and-white photos reveal what Riviera once was, the first
course west of the Mississippi selected to host an Open in 1948. The
architectural sketches hearken to an era when Hogan referred to No. 4
as the "greatest par three in America," when the pros ranked this
layout among the nation's best.</TE>
<TE>   "I think people are confused about why we did this," Yoshitake
said. "We love this golf course. We're looking for that respect."</TE>

<HD>She Was Really Giving Thanks for Breath Mints</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I felt badly for Salma Hayek, the biggest game of the year and the
Lakers giving her seats just 20 or so feet away from where I was
sitting--like she could really concentrate on watching Michael Jordan
and Kobe Bryant.</LD>
<LD>   Staples Center official Tim Harris apparently noticed the same
thing, and asked if I would mind coming over and meeting Salma after
the first quarter, and while I was obviously busy and on deadline, I
wanted her to enjoy the evening.</LD>
<LD>   Now normally I don't pop in a breath mint every time I'm going to
meet one of these sportswriter groupies, but I didn't think it would
be polite to have bad breath when I told Ed Norton to get lost.</LD>
<TE>   As I made my way over to her, I noticed several fans in the crowd,
including Jeanie Buss, pointing, smiling and getting a real kick out
of Salma's chance to finally meet me, and I got a feeling for a
minute what it must be like to be George Clooney.</TE>
<TE>   As you might expect, Salma jumped out of her seat before I could
get to her--grabbing my hand and putting her cheek right alongside
mine. I've been married for 29 years, so I'm a little out of practice
when it comes to kissing a woman, so if she was waiting for me to put
one on her, I let her down.</TE>
<TE>   But while we were standing there cheek to cheek--she whispered
into my ear: "Thanks for giving my career a boost," and I saw no
reason to tell her I try to do that for everybody in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   I know Norton also had something to say, too, but frankly I
couldn't understand why he was still there.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE GROCERY store bagger said he would give anything to be at the
Laker game last night to watch Michael and Kobe play against each
other.</TE>
<TE>   I asked for my daughter's hand back.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I'D LIKE to report the bagger had a great time at the game last
night, while now I can live happily thereafter, but after giving it a
great deal of thought, the bagger called to say I'm still going to
have a wedding to pay for next year.</TE>
<TE>   One consolation: I'm sure my daughter had him sitting there with
her last night in front of the TV watching the men's short program in
figure skating instead of the basketball game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ALMOST EVERYONE else in town was here for the big game, including
a pair of USC associate athletic directors who had first-row seats
near the Lakers' bench. I would have suggested auctioning them off
for the new arena building fund on campus, but that's just me.</TE>
<TE>   Maria Shriver was here without Arnold, and David E. Kelley was
here without Michelle, but I don't like to start rumors.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   AS FOR the basketball game, the play on the court didn't match the
playoff buzz in the arena until there was one minute remaining in the
third quarter--Kobe stealing the ball from Michael and going the
length of the court for the basket and the three-point play after
being fouled by Tyronn Lue.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers had fallen behind by 20 points in the third quarter
with Kobe trying to be the consummate team player, but then Kobe
began to assert himself, and with a little more than nine minutes
remaining in the fourth quarter, the good guys were ahead by eight.</TE>
<TE>   With less than six minutes to play, Kobe and Michael began
exchanging shots at each end of the court, and this was why everyone
had come. Michael had 20 points and Kobe 19, and then Kobe put on one
of those MVP moves to make it 21 with Jordan coming back to post 22.
Then it was Kobe versus Michael one-on-one, everyone in the place
coming to their feet, and Kobe drilled a bomb to finish with Jordan's
number--23, and I was having so much fun I forgot to wave goodbye to
Salma. I hope she gets over it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   IT'S ONLY February, but I believe we already have the Bogus Story
of the Year for 2002--with news the Pasadena City Council has
unanimously approved a three-year plan to lure an NFL team to play in
the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   The ridiculous and not-very-well-thought-out plan calls for an NFL
team in another city to pay for the renovation of the Rose Bowl and
then pay rent to use the stadium so the Rose Bowl doesn't go out of
business.</TE>
<TE>   When Rose Bowl GM Darryl Dunn was asked who will pay for this new
NFL playpen, Dunn said, "Not us.''</TE>
<TE>   NFL owners also don't like the word "renovate.'' The Rose Bowl
will have to be demolished and completely rebuilt to lure a team
here. The Rose Bowl folks said they have talked to the NFL, and have
received encouragement to move forward.</TE>
<TE>   The NFL makes a practice of encouraging everyone to work on its
behalf to stimulate competition and get a better a deal.</TE>
<TE>   The folks at the Rose Bowl, while making a media splash over
nothing, are not only naive when it comes to understanding the NFL
landscape, but clueless if they think NFL owners are going to form a
line to help them stay in business.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE NICE thing about Tiger Woods pulling out of the Nissan Open
this week is there should be plenty of parking available now.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in an e-mail from Steven:</TE>
<TE>   "I'm probably one of the very few who find your articles
entertaining and funny. Will you ever post a complement in the e-mail
you use for your 'Last Word?'''</TE>
<TE>   Yes, I give you this complementary e-mail from Angel Ventura: "You
are a complete fool, and you do a fantastic job validating this fact
every time you print a column."</TE>

<HD>This Game Rivals Anything Around</HD>
<DH>College basketball: Annual matchups between Azusa Pacific
and Biola generate unique passion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC STEPHENS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They are small universities with small-college athletic programs that
don't aspire to be anything more than what they already are: Quiet
liberal arts colleges that revel in their familial atmospheres and
their commitments to Christian learning environments.</LD>
<LD>   Tranquil is a word that describes both colleges, Azusa Pacific,
enrollment 6,800, and Biola (originally the Bible Institute of Los
Angeles), enrollment 3,500.</LD>
<LD>   Unless, of course, you happen to be on campus on the days just
before The Game.</LD>
<TE>   Then the rumblings cut through the libraries, weave through the
classrooms and eventually surround the grounds. Discussions of
physics and philosophy give way to discussions on what chant will be
the most annoying to the opponent.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter where you go, the conversation is about the game," said
Steve McIlwain, a senior guard for Azusa Pacific. "I honestly don't
think there is anyone at school that isn't talking about the game."</TE>
<TE>   That might be an overstatement. But probably not by much.</TE>
<TE>   The latest chapter in this storied rivalry had another fantastic
finish Tuesday night as Biola, the top-ranked team in NAIA, escaped
with a 62-61 Golden State Athletic Conference victory in front a
record crowd of 2,927 at Azusa Pacific's Felix Event Center.</TE>
<TE>   Biola senior Bryan Weakley provided the decisive points with a
three-point basket with 11.6 seconds remaining.</TE>
<TE>   "That's how it's always been," said Weakley, who had 16 points. "I
knew it was going to come down to the end no matter what the score
is."</TE>
<TE>   Biola (24-2, 15-2) moved 21/2 games ahead of eighth-ranked Azusa
(20-5, 12-4) with three games left. Azusa has won the last nine
conference championships.</TE>
<TE>   The close game was typical of a rivalry that's grown hotter
through the years since it started in 1966. Azusa has dominated in
some stretches, Biola in others.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Tuesday's game broke a series tie. In 78 previous meetings,
each team had won 39 times.</TE>
<TE>   As in any entrenched rivalry, there have been blowouts,
buzzer-beating shots, wild comebacks and controversy.</TE>
<TE>   During its 39-1 season in 1982, Biola escaped with a one-point
victory and an overtime victory over the Cougars. The Eagles remained
undefeated until losing the NAIA national championship game.</TE>
<TE>   In a wild 1993 game, the Eagles defeated then No. 1-ranked Azusa,
63-62, when Cougar guard Ronnie Winbush couldn't get off a shot
before the final buzzer sounded. Azusa coaches vehemently protested,
claiming Biola game officials started the clock when the ball was
inbounded and not when it was touched. Police were called in to quell
a skirmish between Biola and Azusa supporters.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, with both teams ranked in the National Assn. of
Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) top 10, Azusa rallied from a
20-point first-half deficit to post a 73-68 victory at Biola, then
used a 22-5 game-ending rally to win 69-61 at home.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, Biola dealt Azusa its only loss in the Cougars'
two-year-old, $14-million arena. The 78-67 defeat was the only one
suffered by the Cougars in conference. Azusa avenged the defeat with
victories over the Eagles at Biola and in the conference tournament
title game.</TE>
<TE>   In the first meeting this year, Azusa Pacific nearly made up a
12-point deficit in the final 1 minute 52 seconds before succumbing,
85-83, in a packed gym at Biola on Jan. 8 in La Mirada.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Augustine, who played for USC and Nebraska before
transferring to Biola, experienced the intensity of rivalry for the
first time in that game. The experience confirmed everything he had
been told.</TE>
<TE>   "I had no idea about Biola or Azusa Pacific or any of this leading
up to the first game," Augustine said. "I had heard so much around
school and the buzz kind of introduced me to the rivalry.</TE>
<TE>   "It kind of reminded me of USC and UCLA on a lower stage. But it
some ways, it's a lot bigger."</TE>
<TE>   At large universities like USC or UCLA, there are segments of the
student body that have little interest for college basketball. With
these small schools, "the students get heated almost to a personal
level," McIlwain said.</TE>
<TE>   Azusa Coach Bill Odell said the importance of the game is
magnified because students on both campuses know each other and often
attend the same churches. That is, if they aren't members of the same
family.</TE>
<TE>   "I cannot imagine the USC-UCLA rivalry being any greater than
ours," Odell said. "Because the players change so much, I don't think
there's as much passion felt as there are between the students.
You've got families where one goes to Azusa Pacific and another
family member goes to Biola. We often compete for the same students,
with both being Christian universities."</TE>
<TE>   The feelings run deep enough that when Biola lost to Cal Baptist
on Feb. 5, the result was met with a resounding cheer when it was
announced at Azusa Pacific's home game against Christian Heritage.</TE>
<TE>   The perennial success of both teams only fuels the rivalry. The
two are often ranked among the nation's top NAIA teams.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Holmquist, 50, in his 22nd season at Biola, recently became
the youngest collegiate coach to win 600 games. Odell, 59, a former
high school coach at Covina Northview and Long Beach Millikan, has
won 299 games in 11 seasons at Azusa.</TE>
<TE>   "It emphasizes why you coach and why you play," Holmquist said. "I
always find it to be real exciting. On game day you're tense and you
never know what will happen. I think anyone who loves to coach loves
to be in games like this."</TE>

<HD>Tyson Licensed to Fight in Georgia</HD>

<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>Mike Tyson has been licensed to fight in Georgia, putting the Georgia
Dome into the running as a site for his heavyweight title fight with
Lennox Lewis.</LD>
<LD>   The fight is still being shopped to several cities, though, and
both the site and date of the bout are in question.</LD>
<LD>   Georgia's top boxing administrator said Tyson received a license
last week for a possible bout in Atlanta on June 8.</LD>
<TE>   But Thomas Mishou, administrator of the Georgia Boxing Commission,
said other cities are also in contention for the fight.</TE>
<TE>   "There are other cities in consideration--I think probably the
lead city is L.A.," Mishou said of a fight that probably would take
place at Staples Center. "Now that this has gone this far I think
that Atlanta is being seriously considered."</TE>
<TE>   The fight was originally set for April 6 in Las Vegas, but Nevada
boxing officials last month rejected Tyson's bid for a license.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, promoters have scrambled to find another site, with
several states saying they would not license Tyson.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, the Texas Motor Speedway said it was withdrawing from
consideration because it didn't consider Tyson a wholesome
attraction.</TE>
<TE>   Tyson adviser Shelly Finkel said Atlanta was a prime candidate for
the fight.</TE>
<TE>   "We chose Atlanta because there have been some big fights there,
it's a major city that has held several big events and they have
direct flights from London," Finkel told the New York Daily News.</TE>
<TE>   Mishou confirmed a license was issued to Tyson. In Georgia, a
license costs $10 and an applicant must only prove a boxer is
physically fit for a match.</TE>
<TE>   "June 8th is the date that I've heard that the match may very well
take place," Mishou said.</TE>
<TE>   Tyson also has a license application pending in Texas, and is
expected to apply for a permit in California. Promoters in Michigan
also are bidding to stage a fight there.</TE>
<TE>   "The fight will not happen on April 6," Gary Shaw, Lewis' promoter
at Main Events, said Tuesday. "Lennox is in a courtroom now. He's not
in training.</TE>
<TE>   "It's Feb. 12. Anyone who is realistic will tell you that it won't
happen on April 6."</TE>

<LD>There are no must-win games until tournament time, but there is a lot
riding on UCLA's matchup against Arizona on Thursday at Pauley
Pavilion.</LD>
<LD>   Arizona, 10-3 in the Pacific 10 Conference, holds a 11/2-game lead
over UCLA and three other teams that are all 8-4. Oregon is in second
at 9-4 and one game behind the Wildcats.</LD>
<LD>   If the Bruins lose, they fall two games behind Arizona in the loss
column. If they win--and USC, California and Stanford all win, as
expected--a half-game will separate six teams, and all would have
four losses.</LD>
<TE>   "We have just as good a team as Arizona," Bruin guard Rico Hines
said. "We will come out and play hard."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Junior forward Jason Kapono is one of 20 finalists for the
Naismith award, given to the nation's top player as voted by coaches,
writers and administrators.</TE>
<TE>   Kapono also was named to an All-District team by the National
Assn. of Basketball Coaches, which selects 150 players in 15
districts nationwide to become eligible for its All-American team.
Senior forward Matt Barnes was named to the second team.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UCLA's home game against Arizona State on Saturday will begin at
12:30 p.m., a half-hour later than originally scheduled.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Trojans have lost two in a row, dropped their third game of the
season on a last-second three-point basket and  are on an eight-day
break between games after opting not to play a nonconference game
during UCLA week.</LD>
<LD>   "We got the sorrow run out of us," senior David Bluthenthal said,
alleviating fears that the Trojans, who play host to Arizona State on
Thursday, would spend their break wallowing in self-pity.</LD>
<LD>   Bluthenthal has used the respite to work on  his jump shot.  The
small forward has been relegated to the second team in practice and
is not sure if he will start against the Sun Devils.</LD>
<TE>   "It's all about the team," Bluthenthal said. "If I don't start, I
won't get down on myself. I'll just accept my role and do what I can
to help the team get the win."</TE>
<TE>   Bluthenthal, who said this has  been his most trying collegiate
season, made  a clutch three-pointer late in the UCLA game and said
he hopes it's the type of shot that can break him out of his
season-long funk.</TE>
<TE>   "I think my problem is that I'm not having fun playing ball," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm getting mad at myself when I'm missing shots. I've been
worrying about [impressing NBA] scouts."</TE>
<TE>   Errick Craven, another Trojan who has been flat,   used the break
to rest and ice his tired and heavy legs. USC's starting shooting
guard has been tentative on offense and his lightning-quick first
step toward the basket has been neutralized as opposing teams have
adapted to him.</TE>
<TE>   He also has hit the freshman wall.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not doing much wrong, I'm just not doing much well," Craven
said. "I'm just out there running around and as a starter you can't
do that."</TE>

<HD>Skating on Thin Ice Over Judging</HD>
<DH>Olympics: Canadians in pairs contest were 'Robbed!' in favor of
Russians, many say. Flap exposes infighting in graceful sport.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY
</DL>
<LD>As an uproar grew over a controversial pairs skating decision,
officials launched an inquiry Tuesday into why the judges elected to
award gold to Russia for a challenging but sometimes flawed program over
a Canadian couple who many said were flawless.</LD>
<LD>   The flap over Monday night's judging quickly took on a life of its own
Tuesday, and by day's end there were dueling news conferences marked by
angry allegations, threats to quit the sport and suspicions voiced of
bloc voting among judges. Seemingly every skater and skating expert
weighed in with an opinion, resulting in a media feeding frenzy for what
is shaping up to be the biggest controversy in skating since Tonya
Harding and Nancy Kerrigan.</LD>
<LD>   "This is the worst thing that's happened in a long time in figure
skating," said longtime Southern California coach Frank Carroll.</LD>
<TE>   Russians Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze performed a classical
and dramatic long program but had one misstep, when Sikharulidze stumbled
on the landing of a double axel jump. Canadians Jamie Sale and David
Pelletier--who are also off-ice sweethearts--offered up a sometimes
poignant, sometimes whimsical performance to the pop culture staple "Love
Story."</TE>
<TE>   The winners seemed obvious. When the Canadians finished, fans chanted
"Six! Six!" in anticipation of a perfect score, and NBC commentators,
meantime, had all but assured audiences at home that the Canadian effort
was as good as gold.</TE>
<TE>   But by a 5-4 margin, the Russians won, reviving long-standing debate
about the subjective judging that is an inherent part of the sport.</TE>
<TE>   "Robbed!" read the front page headlines of the Ottawa Sun and Winnipeg
Free Press newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   Sally Rehorick, a representative of Canada's Olympic delegation and a
figure skating judge, said she was "horrified" and might quit judging
because of what she perceived as an injustice against Sale and Pelletier,
who said at his own news conference that he was considering leaving the
sport.</TE>
<TE>   "The Russians are a wonderful pair, an exquisite pair," Rehorick said.
"[Monday] night, Jamie and David skated better. . . . I do feel the
credibility of our sport could be negatively affected by this decision."</TE>
<TE>   John Nicks, a 10-time U.S. Olympic coach and two-time Olympic pairs
skater, said even if Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze had performed more
intricate footwork than Sale and Pelletier, that should not have been
decisive.</TE>
<TE>   "Not for first place," said Nicks, who watched the event on TV at home
in Southern California but will return to Salt Lake City on Friday to
coach Sasha Cohen in the women's competition. "You don't win and lose a 4
1/2-minute freestyle program on footwork. I thought [the decision] was
baffling. . . . Probably only five people agreed--the judges."</TE>
<TE>   But the Russians, who have historically dominated the sport, defended
the victory that marked the 11th consecutive Olympic gold medal for
Soviet or Russian pair skaters.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Tamara Moskvina said her skaters' transition moves were far more
challenging than the Canadians', and she rated her skaters' footwork as
more difficult. She also pointed out that the Russians did not protest at
last year's world championships in Vancouver, when voting went the other
way, with the Canadians beating the Russians.</TE>
<TE>   "We considered that Elena and Anton won, but it went to the other
couple," she said at her own news conference. "We didn't accuse the North
American bloc [of voting together], we just accepted it. So now it is our
time."</TE>
<TE>   Separately, Chinese judge Jiasheng Yang, who was joined by colleagues
from Russia, France, Poland and Ukraine in voting for the Russians over
the Canadians, withdrew from judging the men's short program Tuesday "due
to an illness," according to the Olympic news service. Judges from the
U.S., Canada, Germany and Japan voted for Sale and Pelletier.</TE>
<TE>Governing Body Opts to Review Decision</TE>
<TE>   The International Skating Union, the sport's international governing
body, said it will review the decision "to respect the public opinion."
Union General Secretary Fredi Schmid said in a statement that the
organization "is doing an internal assessment to monitor if the ISU rules
and procedures have been respected."</TE>
<TE>   A reversal of the judges' decision is unlikely, but judges have been
suspended by the ISU when it has been determined that bloc judging
occurred.</TE>
<TE>   Controversy is nothing new to figure skating, in which judges award
one set of marks based on skaters' execution of jumps, spins and other
quantifiable elements, and another set of subjective marks for
performance.</TE>
<TE>   In Olympic figure skating, especially, debates still rage over medals
awarded long ago, amid accusations of deal-making by judges to help each
other's skaters and of bloc voting by judges from the former Soviet
republics against Western skaters.</TE>
<TE>   Fans of the sport still debate the outcome of the men's competition at
the 1992 Albertville Games, where Paul Wylie of the U.S. was the only
skater among the top six to perform a flawless long program and yet
finished second to Viktor Petrenko of the post-Soviet breakup team.</TE>
<TE>   Arguments still rage over whether Oksana Baiul of Ukraine deserved her
gold over Kerrigan at the 1994 Lillehammer Games, or whether Tara
Lipinski's energetic long program was deserving of gold over the more
elegant Michelle Kwan, who won the silver in the 1998 Nagano Games. That
contest in particular ignited arguments among skating fans about the
value of technical mastery versus the importance of maturity and
artistry--subjective judgments all.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Hamilton, an NBC commentator at Salt Lake City and the 1984
men's Olympic gold medalist, also condemned the decision Monday and said
it would be "debated forever."</TE>
<TE>Canadians' Choice of Music Cited</TE>
<TE>   In a sign of just how personal it can get, Hamilton said the
Canadians' biggest mistake may have been choosing music that appeals more
to them than to the judges.</TE>
<TE>   "I always try to defend that as a cultural thing, not as bloc voting,"
he said. "Their artistry may not be judged on the same level because it
isn't an established-for-generations thing."</TE>
<TE>   The International Olympic Committee on Tuesday declined to become
involved in the controversy, saying it was the domain of the ISU, which
has scheduled a news conference for today.</TE>
<TE>   Director General Francois Carrard said the controversy is "not the
first and not the last" at the Games, for the simple reason that "you
don't have an objective answer" as in other sports. "Judges are judges,
people are human, results are results. That's life."</TE>

<HD>Alleged 'Trainer' of Sept. 11 Attackers Is Granted Bail</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Britain frees Algerian pilot after U.S. fails to produce
concrete evidence against him.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>LONDON
</DL>
<LD>The Algerian pilot whom investigators had named as the Sept. 11
skyjackers' "lead trainer" when they jailed him here nearly five months
ago was freed on bond Tuesday, after the U.S. government failed to
produce any hard evidence linking him to the terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Lotfi Raissi wept in open court, and his family applauded from a
glass-walled gallery as British Judge Timothy Workman overruled
prosecutors' objections, set bail at about $15,000 and allowed Raissi and
his wife to later walk hand in hand out of a maximum-security prison in
southeastern London.</LD>
<LD>   The judge ordered Raissi, who also faces two indictments on lesser
charges by a federal grand jury in Arizona, to reappear next month for an
extradition hearing.</LD>
<TE>   But the decision to free a man once viewed as a key suspect in the
attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon was a public blow to the
Bush administration, which has led a worldwide campaign to round up Sept.
11 suspects as well as other possible terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the case appeared emblematic of an investigation that has
increasingly run into difficulties. Only one man, Zacarias Moussaoui, has
been charged for his alleged role in the Sept. 11 plot. He was arrested
for immigration violations in Minnesota in August and thus was already in
custody when the attacks occurred.</TE>
<TE>   None of the more than 1,200 people detained in the United States after
the attacks has been charged with terrorism; 116 face unrelated criminal
charges, according to Justice Department figures released in
mid-December, while 460 are being held for immigration violations. The
others have been released.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike some of the U.S. cases, most of the overseas cases have escaped
public scrutiny. CIA Director George J. Tenet told the Senate
Intelligence Committee last week that "nearly 1,000 Al Qaeda operatives"
had been arrested in more than 60 countries, a figure far higher than
previous estimates.</TE>
<TE>   But a U.S. official familiar with the roundups said not all those
arrested were Al Qaeda operatives. Moreover, the official said some had
been released, suggesting insufficient evidence to support continued
detention.</TE>
<TE>   Officials in Washington acknowledged that they have not been able to
develop concrete evidence tying Raissi to the skyjackers.</TE>
<TE>   "If there were terrorism charges we could have brought against Mr.
Raissi, we would have brought them," said Bryan Sierra, a Justice
Department spokesman. "That hasn't happened yet."</TE>
<TE>   But Sierra said Raissi, who was arrested 10 days after the attacks,
has not been ruled out as a suspect. And the spokesman sought to downplay
the significance of the British judge's ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "The extradition request is still pending, and we're still seeking to
have him face charges in Arizona," Sierra said.</TE>
<TE>   Workman's ruling came after a 35-minute hearing in which Raissi's
attorney assailed the FBI and U.S. prosecutors for "disgracefully"
withholding evidence and ignoring witnesses' testimony in the prolonged
effort to extradite Raissi to the United States. The prosecutor
representing the U.S. at the hearing denied the charge.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the 20 weeks Raissi was held in London's Belmarsh Prison,
defense attorney Hugo Keith argued, the FBI examined his life "from top
to toe . . . but nothing whatsoever has been forthcoming."</TE>
<TE>   The FBI refused to discuss specific allegations leveled by Keith.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutor James Lewis, presenting the U.S. government's case, offered
no new evidence Tuesday to support terrorism charges.</TE>
<TE>   Arguing against Raissi's release, Lewis said "the fact that he is a
suspect is a compelling reason to believe he will fail to appear" for the
March 28 extradition hearing.</TE>
<TE>   After 45 minutes of private deliberation, Workman said, "I'm satisfied
there's no likelihood of terrorism charges being proffered against Mr.
Raissi in the near future." He ordered Raissi to surrender his passport.</TE>
<TE>   During the hearing, Keith tore into the allegations against Raissi,
whose predawn Sept. 21 arrest along with his family at his suburban
London apartment made headlines worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   One FBI document, Keith said, attempted to link Raissi to Hani
Hanjour, the Saudi Arabian suspected of flying a Boeing 757 into the
Pentagon. It stated that Raissi and Hanjour had taken a training flight
together at an Arizona flying school on March 8, 1999, along with an
American instructor.</TE>
<TE>   But Keith stated that Raissi's defense team has since interviewed the
American pilot, who said his logbooks showed that he and Raissi alone had
flown together on March 9. Other records showed that Hanjour flew with
another instructor the previous day.</TE>
<TE>   Keith added that the American pilot had told the FBI the same thing
but that U.S. authorities had not informed the British court. And Keith
quoted from a Nov. 29 FBI affidavit by an agent he identified only as
Plunkett that reported "no evidence to suggest that Mr. Raissi and Mr.
Hanjour had ever trained together."</TE>
<TE>   Outside the courthouse, the Raissi family's initial rejoicing quickly
turned to angry rejoinder.</TE>
<TE>   His wife, brother and mother, who had gathered before the hearing with
signs declaring "Scapegoat" and "Stop Racism," demanded that U.S.
officials drop all charges and publicly apologize to the 27-year-old
Algerian.</TE>
<TE>   Declaring that "justice has been done," his brother Mohamed said "the
FBI said to the world that he [Raissi] was the biggest terrorist, and now
they have to say to the world that this man is innocent."</TE>
<TE>   Raissi's wife, Sonia, added: "They should drop the charges and say
sorry to him. My message to the FBI is, 'You arrested him for terrorism,
so why do you want to extradite him for these ridiculous, minor charges?'
"</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, U.S. law enforcement officials have made prevention of
another attack their top priority, paying less attention to
evidence-gathering techniques often used to build a criminal case. John
Martin, a former Justice Department official and authority on national
security cases, said Raissi's release raises doubts about that strategy.</TE>
<TE>   "The aim in bringing criminal cases should be to make sure that the
defendants aren't turned loose on the street, and that means you're going
to have to have better evidence and cooperation between prosecutors in
different countries," Martin said.</TE>
<TE>   "The question in this case is whether the evidence is lacking or
whether the U.S. government is reluctant to share it with the Brits. I
think it's more likely that the evidence is lacking," he said.</TE>
<TE>   After his arrest here, Raissi was indicted by a federal grand jury in
Phoenix on charges of lying on his application for a pilot's license. He
was indicted again in November on additional charges, although none
specifically link him to terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Phoenix said Tuesday
that Raissi's release in London "really has no impact" on the local
prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   The first indictment alleges that Raissi, who is licensed in the
United States to fly Boeing 737s, failed to tell a Federal Aviation
Administration doctor that he had knee surgery for an old tennis injury.
It also alleges that he did not disclose a 1993 conviction for stealing a
briefcase at London's Heathrow Airport.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Keith attacked those charges in court Tuesday. The FAA doctor
who examined Raissi for his pilot's license had examined him for an
earlier license, Keith argued, and Raissi had disclosed his surgery the
first time. The FBI was aware of that, Keith added, yet it failed to
inform the British court. The theft charge, the attorney said, was filed
in Britain, and FAA rules did not compel Raissi to report it.</TE>
<TE>   The second indictment alleges that Raissi conspired to file a false
application for political asylum on behalf of another Algerian, Redouane
Dahmani, who is in custody in Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   Raissi's attorney also disputed that case Tuesday. He attacked the
FBI's handling of a diary found in the London apartment of a suspected
senior Al Qaeda member known as Abu Doha, who also is in British custody
and the subject of U.S. extradition efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors had asserted that the diary belonged to Abu Doha and
suggested links to Raissi. But prosecutor Lewis conceded Tuesday that the
diary bore none of Abu Doha's fingerprints.</TE>
<TE>   Abu Doha appeared before Judge Workman after the Raissi hearing. But
Abu Doha, who was identified in testimony as a key figure in a plot to
bomb Los Angeles International Airport, did not win bail.</TE>

<HD>Big Payday for CEO as Firm Sinks</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Global Crossing's John Legere gets millions, including a
promotion severance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even as his company was sliding into financial ruin, Global
Crossing Ltd. Chief Executive John Legere collected as much as $3 million
in severance pay after being promoted from the telecommunication
company's biggest subsidiary. The payout is highly unusual and likely to
fuel more controversy over the compensation that Global Crossing granted
executives in the months before its downfall.</LD>
<LD>   Legere's severance package, outlined in regulatory filings, came on
top of a $3.5-million signing bonus he received for joining Global
Crossing four months before it filed the fifth-largest bankruptcy in U.S.
history.</LD>
<LD>   The 43-year-old Legere also had his salary doubled, to $1.1 million,
and the $10-million balance of a $15-million loan from the subsidiary,
Asia Global Crossing, erased.</LD>
<TE>   Compensation expert Graef Crystal said he has never heard of a
subsidiary paying severance to a CEO who left to work for the parent
company.</TE>
<TE>   "For all practical purposes, this is the same company," Crystal said.
"It's just a promotion . . . so he got promoted and gets severance."</TE>
<TE>   The arrangement is even more unusual considering the nature of
Legere's move. In leaving Asia Global Crossing, Legere relocated his
office less than 200 yards across a Beverly Hills courtyard complex
shared by both Global Crossing and Asia Global Crossing.</TE>
<TE>   Legere's employment agreement with Asia Global Crossing gave him $1
million in severance for each year remaining on the contract. Under a
recent contract extension, Legere could receive up to $3 million,
according to regulatory filings.</TE>
<TE>   Madelyn Smith, a spokeswoman for Asia Global Crossing, would not
disclose the exact amount of severance paid to Legere, saying only that
he "was paid severance in accordance with his contract." Through a Global
Crossing spokeswoman, Legere declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Global Crossing spun off Asia Global Crossing, which runs the
company's fiber-optic network in the Far East, and retained a 59%
ownership stake. The two companies have overlapping boards of directors,
and at one point last year Legere was chief executive of both companies.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to employees last week, he defended his pay package.</TE>
<TE>   Legere wrote that the loan was meant to compensate him for giving up
lucrative stock and options in Dell Computer Corp., where he was a
high-ranking executive before he joined Asia Global Crossing. The
$15-million loan was never designed to be repaid, he said, and was set up
as a loan solely for tax reasons.</TE>
<TE>   His salary and signing bonus were considered reasonable by the
company's board of directors, who consulted with compensation experts
before voting to approve the package, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The job of turning around Global Crossing will be a tough one, given
the company's heavy debt load and the weak economy, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It takes a unique set of skills, experience and leadership ability to
tackle this job in the midst of what might metaphorically be called 'A
Perfect Storm,' " Legere wrote. "As for the salary and bonus--the
employees, the industry and public at large will have a chance to weigh
in on whether I'm earning my keep."</TE>
<TE>   The nearly $15 million in compensation given to Legere in the months
leading up to the bankruptcy filing did not materially contribute to the
company's financial downfall. Global Crossing listed $12.3 billion in
debts, and $22.4 billion in assets in the filing.</TE>
<TE>   But news of Legere's severance package further outraged the employees
Global Crossing laid off before the Jan. 28 Chapter 11 filing, which cut
off all severance payments to former employees, many of whom have yet to
find new jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Others have been stuck with unreimbursed travel expenses, reduced
health benefits and retirement funds of little or no value now that
Global Crossing shares have been reduced to 7 cents, from a high of
$65.77 in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "This makes me very upset. I'm having to worry about my heating bills
and mortgage and everything," said former Global Crossing employee Matt
Fico. "You just wonder sometimes where a company's priorities lie."</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing has been a target of compensation experts critical of
excessive executive pay. Former CEO Robert Annunziata, who was employed
for 13 months, got a $10-million cash bonus, a guaranteed annual bonus of
$500,000 and a $5-million loan to buy company stock when he joined the
company in 1999. His package included options to buy 2 million shares of
Global Crossing stock at $10 below market prices.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, his contract provided for a brand-new 1999 Mercedes and
monthly first-class trips to shuttle his family, including his mother,
back and forth from his Los Angeles and New Jersey homes.</TE>
<TE>   The company also has come under fire because executives reaped large
gains from the sale of stock. Top officers sold a total of $1.3 billion
in Global Crossing stock in the three years before the company's
bankruptcy filing.</TE>
<TE>   About half of that total was sold by Gary Winnick, the company's
founder and largest stockholder.</TE>
<TE>   Executive compensation has taken on new importance in the wake of the
company's bankruptcy and the growing similarities between Global Crossing
and energy trading firm Enron Corp.</TE>
<TE>   The Houston-based energy firm's collapse revealed a quagmire of
misleading accounting and self-dealing within the firm, sparking
investigations by several agencies and Congress and renewed interest in
the accounting minutiae involving Global Crossing and others.</TE>
<TE>   One day after the filing, a letter by a former Global Crossing
employee surfaced, questioning the company's aggressive accounting
methods.</TE>
<TE>   The letter, written in August by former finance Vice President Roy
Olofson, outlined bookkeeping methods he viewed as misleading.</TE>
<TE>   Despite strenuous denials from Global Crossing, Olofson's allegations
are now the subject of investigations by the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the FBI.</TE>

<HD>U.N. Prosecutors Open Milosevic's War Crimes Trial</HD>
<DH>Tribunal: The former Yugoslav leader is accused in the 1990s
slaughter in the Balkans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEBASTIAN ROTELLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>THE HAGUE
</DL>
<LD>The trial of Slobodan Milosevic, the first head of state to be put
in the dock for crimes against humanity, began here Tuesday with
prosecutors accusing the former Yugoslav president of masterminding the
slaughter of thousands of people and the abuse of hundreds of thousands
more during a bloody decade in power.</LD>
<LD>   The first day of the long-awaited proceedings at the International
Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia was a watershed in the annals
of international law. The opening statements paid tribute to the
historical weight of the moment and evoked the carnage in the Balkans in
the 1990s.</LD>
<LD>   Milosevic's mere presence at the defendant's table was a victory for a
9-year-old U.N. court that has struggled with a legally cumbersome and
politically treacherous mission, chief prosecutor Carla Del Ponte told
the three-judge panel.</LD>
<TE>   "Today, as never before, we see international justice in action," said
Del Ponte, a former Swiss attorney general known for locking up
international gangsters and corrupt politicians. "Let us take a moment to
reflect upon the establishment of this tribunal and its purpose. . . .
Our unique contribution is to bring to justice the persons responsible
for the worst crimes known to humankind."</TE>
<TE>   Del Ponte said the "medieval savagery" of Milosevic's military
campaigns resulted in the charges against him of genocide, crimes against
humanity, violations of the Geneva Conventions and other offenses. The
trial will encompass three separate indictments for wars of "ethnic
cleansing" in Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and the province of Kosovo in
Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic, where Milosevic was president
from 1989 to 1997. The Kosovo conflict provoked a 1999 air campaign
against his regime by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and hastened
his downfall and arrest last year.</TE>
<TE>   The trial has been described as Europe's most significant war crimes
prosecution since the judgment of Nazis at Nuremberg. It is expected to
last two years, and it features a defendant who will act as his own
lawyer but refuses to recognize the legitimacy of the proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   In political diatribes during pretrial hearings, Milosevic portrayed
himself as a persecuted martyr and jousted with the judges, who entered a
not guilty plea for him. The judicial panel--made up of jurists from
Britain, Jamaica and South Korea--has appointed a distinguished legal
team to ensure that Milosevic gets an adequate defense and a trial that
will be both fair and regarded as fair.</TE>
<TE>   Milosevic, 60, wore a blue suit Tuesday and sat between two uniformed
guards. His jaw raised pugnaciously, an occasional half-smile coming to
his lips, he took notes as prosecutors got down to the complex carpentry
of building a case based on hundreds of witnesses and thousands of
exhibits.</TE>
<TE>   The central premise of the accusations laid out by prosecutor Geoffrey
Nice: Milosevic led a continuing criminal enterprise whose ruthless goal
was the creation of a "Greater Serbia" and the annihilation of Bosnian
Muslims, Croatians and other ethnic enemies.</TE>
<TE>   Nice reviewed the indictments' catalog of horrors: at least 4,000 dead
in Kosovo and more than 800,000 ethnic Albanians forcibly deported from
the province. More than 7,000 massacred in the town of Srebrenica alone
during the 1992-95 war in Bosnia. Entire regions where Croatian civilians
were killed or forcibly removed in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Nice argued that Milosevic's direct and indirect control of an array
of military, police and paramilitary forces in the Balkans made him
personally responsible for systematic atrocities--torture, rape,
destruction of villages--even if they happened hundreds of miles away.
Using video clips, the prosecutor reviewed Milosevic's transformation
from Cold War-era Communist Party boss to fervent Serbian nationalist and
his rapid, destructive rise to power.</TE>
<TE>Genocide Hard to Prove, Rights Activist Says</TE>
<TE>   "He did not personally confront his victims," said Nice, a British
attorney with a brooding, understated courtroom manner. "He could view
what was happening from the distance of high political office. . . . This
trial is about the climb of the accused to power. A power exercised
without accountability, responsibility or morality."</TE>
<TE>   In order to convict Milosevic of genocide, the prosecution will have
to prove that he set out to eliminate an ethnic group or nationality in
whole or in part.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an exceedingly difficult charge to prove," said Richard Dicker
of Human Rights Watch, an international watchdog group that has compiled
several investigative reports on atrocities in the Balkans. "You have to
show specific intent."</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Milosevic was not technically head of state at the time of
the alleged genocide in Bosnia, though he allegedly controlled the
Yugoslav government while president of Serbia. He became president of
Yugoslavia in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Key evidence, judging from the prosecution's opening argument, will
come from political insiders once close to Milosevic as well as officials
from Western governments. If past trials here are any guide, the most
sensitive witnesses are likely to testify in closed session and their
identities will be known only to prosecutors, the defense and the judges.</TE>
<TE>   Nice also offered a preview of evidence from intelligence intercepts
of Milosevic's telephone conversations with subordinates. He displayed
organizational charts tying Milosevic to alleged death squad leaders such
as Zeljko "Arkan" Raznatovic, a slain paramilitary chieftain notorious
for his viciousness.</TE>
<TE>   In a modern courtroom filled with journalists from around the world,
Milosevic will finally face his victims and their ghosts. Survivors will
testify about excruciating allegations, such as one from Bosnia recounted
by Nice. The attorney described how paramilitary fighters locked a
mother, her newborn baby and 45 members of an extended family in a house,
doused it with gasoline and set it on fire.</TE>
<TE>   "They were burned alive," Nice said quietly. "And the baby's screams
were heard for some two hours before it, too, succumbed. That's one
representative crime for well over 7,000 deaths."</TE>
<TE>   Milosevic listened tight-lipped. The former dictator's most expressive
moment of the day came after the showing of a video clip from 1989
depicting a decisive moment in his political career. In the footage, a
stern, noticeably thinner and more youthful Milosevic addressed Serbs
enraged at ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. His words to the crowd that day
become a kind of nationalist war cry: "No one will ever beat you again."</TE>
<TE>   When the clip ended, Milosevic seemed momentarily lost in
contemplation of the scene from his glory days. Realizing that the
attention of the courtroom had returned to him, he shook his head with a
wry, surprised smile that brought a burst of laughter from spectators.</TE>
<TE>   Major outbursts are expected from the defendant today, when he will
have an opportunity to deliver an opening statement. If Milosevic's
comments and those of his advisors are any indication, he will unleash an
attack on his attackers with all the bombast and fury of an accomplished
politician.</TE>
<TE>   He and his advocates say the prosecution is hypocritical. They accuse
the U.S. and European powers of treating him as a valued negotiating
partner throughout much of the 1990s, then turning on him and committing
war crimes of their own during the aerial bombardment of Yugoslavia in
1999.</TE>
<TE>   Milosevic also appears obsessed with his legacy in Serbia, so he is
likely to portray himself with gloomy fatalism as a patriot whose only
crime was to stand up to Islamic terrorists and other enemies.</TE>
<TE>U.S. Lawyer in Defense Team</TE>
<TE>   Even though he claims to reject the proceedings, Milosevic has been
building a defense in recent jailhouse strategy sessions with an
assortment of informal advisors. They include former U.S. Atty. Gen.
Ramsey Clark, now an outspoken leftist critic of the U.S. government, and
Jacques Verges, a French criminal defense lawyer who specializes in
notorious clients, including French Gestapo chieftain Klaus Barbie and
Venezuelan terrorist Carlos the Jackal.</TE>
<TE>   In comments to reporters during a break Tuesday, Verges scoffed at the
prosecution's case thus far.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't seen any proof yet," he said. "This is a fake tribunal, and
Mr. Milosevic should keep calling it a fake tribunal."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the criticism, the international court has done more than many
observers expected in its early years. The trial of Milosevic is a
triumph for those who say justice must globalize along with economics.</TE>
<TE>   "The international justice phenomenon is in its infancy," Dicker said.
"The signal that this trial sends is the important role of international
criminal courts where national courts are unable to do the job. The guy
who was the architect of the policies that wrought hell in the Balkans
will be brought to trial using the highest standards of international
law."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, half a dozen of Milosevic's accused co-conspirators remain
at large. Among them are Milan Milutinovic, the current Serbian
president, and the Bosnian Serbs' wartime leaders, Radovan Karadzic and
Gen. Ratko Mladic.</TE>

<KH>RACE FOR GOVERNOR</KH>
<HD>Jones' Values, Style Show His Farm Roots</HD>
<DH>Election: He has paid his party dues, but an independent streak at
times defies political wisdom.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DAUNT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>FIREBAUGH, Calif.
</DL>
<LD>Bill Jones settles himself into the creaky seat of his old GMC
Suburban. He has his aging golden retriever, Ginger, in the back and a
deserted two-lane highway ahead of him.</LD>
<LD>   It is here, on a flat stretch of road through some of California's
most fertile farmland, that this unlikely politician feels most
comfortable. Heading out to the ranch near Fresno where he grew up, Jones
is taking a short break in his campaign for governor.</LD>
<LD>   He's spent the last 20 years in state Republican politics. Now, as he
aims for California's top office, Jones, 52, views his quest with the
stolid practicality of a farmer preparing a field for a spring harvest.</LD>
<TE>   "Politics is like farming," Jones says, glancing at a field of dormant
grapevines. "You can do everything right and have everything wiped out by
a hailstorm. It's a matter of looking at the conditions, picking a time
you can contribute and win. That's the time we are looking at now."</TE>
<TE>   As far as Jones is concerned, this is a job he has earned. He has paid
his dues, working his way up through local political committees, putting
in 12 years as an assemblyman, and eight years as secretary of state. In
the last few years, he has been the only Republican holding a statewide
office in California.</TE>
<TE>   But that has not helped him much as he runs for governor. As much as
anything else, what has hurt Jones is his own behavior, particularly his
penchant for treading his own path regardless of the political cost.</TE>
<TE>   In the 2002 presidential primaries, while he was planning his bid for
governor, he alienated the Republican front-runner, George W. Bush, by
publicly pulling his endorsement and siding instead with the upstart
candidacy of John McCain.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Jones has been reluctant to expand his base of
operations beyond the Central Valley. He never so much as bought a house
in Sacramento, preferring to shuttle back and forth in his own plane to
preserve time with his family at their Fresno home. He uses the term
"Valley girl" to describe young farm women--not those hanging out in
malls on Topanga Canyon Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Even his authorship of the state's three-strikes measure did little to
wrest him from an anonymity that aides have long blamed on his
common-as-apple-pie name.</TE>
<TE>   Jones dismisses the criticism. "It doesn't matter if you come from a
rural area or a city, our beliefs are the same: safe streets, good
education for our children and jobs," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Though gentlemanly and good-natured by reputation, Jones has displayed
an unusual aggressiveness in the governor's race. He has taken on his GOP
opponents, former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and businessman Bill
Simon Jr.--as if firing his last shot. Which, perhaps, he is.</TE>
<TE>   If he loses, Jones says he is "grounded" enough to recognize that
there are other important things in his life. He won't mourn. He'll just
put on his weathered cowboy boots and head back to his ranch.</TE>
<TE>Rooted in the Family Farm</TE>
<TE>   For as long as Bill Jones can remember, the family farm in the San
Joaquin Valley laid the groundwork for his life.</TE>
<TE>   His parents met in the 1940s while attending UC Davis, and won the
land in a government lottery for World War II veterans. Jones' father,
who grew up working at his dad's Tulare County cotton gin company, fought
in the South Pacific. His mother, whose family has lived outside
Sacramento, in the mountain town of Placerville, was a captain in the
U.S. Air Force.</TE>
<TE>   It was a source of pride among the women in the Jones family that Cora
Jones outranked all the men they knew. At 6 feet tall, she was a war-era
Martha Stewart, organizing her household with military precision as she
raised two sons and a daughter in the modest ranch house. Her son
inherited her approach.</TE>
<TE>   "I never saw her run out of milk, and I do that every other day," says
Jones' wife, Maurine.</TE>
<TE>   Jones' father, also a conservative Republican, served on the local
water board for 47 years, and helped develop state water policy under
then-Gov. Ronald Reagan.</TE>
<TE>   The family, middle class when the crops came in, made ends meet by
herding cattle and growing cotton, sugar beets and rice on about 6,000
acres.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Jones was born in Coalinga five days before Christmas in 1949,
the middle child sandwiched between a sister and brother. A
self-described mediocre student, he attended a five-room school the town
of Las Deltas.</TE>
<TE>   Although his parents did not make him work on the farm, Jones wanted
his piece of it. So while most kids his age were still sleeping in, Jones
was out at 5 a.m. feeding the cows.</TE>
<TE>   By the time he was 11, he had bought several of his own. When still a
teenager, he tooled around the farm in an old World War II jeep, like
other rural kids oblivious to the strictures of the DMV. He learned how
to fly a crop-duster, taking off on a ragtag airstrip near his family
farm.</TE>
<TE>   "I grew up with a horse, a dog, a rifle, and a long distance between
neighbors," Jones says.</TE>
<TE>   Few people at the time would have predicted that he would end up in
politics, although the prospect did not surprise Jones' best friend of 40
years, Tim Ward. It wasn't so much that Jones was a natural leader. It
was that he had the natural ability to fix things--old tractors, broken
fences, sick cattle and hurt feelings.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not one of these guys who thinks his opinion is the only one
that matters," says Ward, who runs his family's fuel supply business in
Firebaugh. "He can look at both sides and negotiate a solution."</TE>
<TE>   It was a skill that Jones would demonstrate as student body president
at Cal State Fresno, where he earned a bachelor's degree in 1971 in
agribusiness.</TE>
<TE>   The country was embroiled in the Vietnam War, and tensions were
running high at the university. Jones, who had run for student government
at the urging of his fraternity brothers, was on the conservative side,
supporting the war while calling for calm at the university.</TE>
<TE>   When word got out that protesters planned to march on the agriculture
college, other students armed themselves with shovels and pitchforks to
confront them.</TE>
<TE>   Fearing the worst, Jones stood in the road leading to the agriculture
school, hoping he could head off a conflict.</TE>
<TE>   "Bill kept them apart," says Maurine Jones, who was a student there at
the time. "He got leaders together to sit down and talk."</TE>
<TE>   It was the first time Jones dealt with political strife.</TE>
<TE>   "It as a very contentious time," Jones says. "But it really piqued my
interest in politics. I learned to listen and understand what people were
saying."</TE>
<TE>   He and Maurine, a former Miss Tulare County, married in 1971. In the
30 years since, Maurine Jones says her husband has only yelled at her
once--when she accidentally washed his wallet.</TE>
<TE>   From the start of their romance, however, Jones made it clear that he
would enlist in the Marines.</TE>
<TE>   In 1971, she went with him to sign his papers. But there was a
problem: Government doctors discovered that Jones had serious back
problems from years of heavy lifting on the farm. They gave him a
honorable discharge and sent him home.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember that day so clearly," Maurine Jones says. "I have never
seen him so down and disappointed. For a wife to see that, it was
devastating for me as well. On the other hand, I was happy. I didn't want
him to go. Talk about conflicted feelings."</TE>
<TE>   Jones said he wanted to go to Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt it was an obligation to the country," he says. "And if I was
going to go, I want to go with the Marines."</TE>
<TE>   But the rejection would indirectly lead him to politics.</TE>
<TE>   He went to work managing the family farm, expanding its cattle
operation to one of the largest in the area. Maurine taught English at
the schoolhouse in Las Deltas. Soon, the newlyweds heard that President
Nixon needed volunteers for his reelection campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The two signed on, hooking up with political consultant Ed Rollins,
who was heading up Nixon's Central Valley effort. Thirty years later,
Rollins is running Jones' gubernatorial bid, as a volunteer.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after the Nixon campaign, Jones decided to pursue politics for
himself.</TE>
<TE>   "I had built up my [farming and ranching] operation," Jones says. "I
was happy with how it was going, and I could have stayed there. But I
felt I had something more to contribute."</TE>
<TE>   He says he liked the idea of helping people solve their problems. He
lived, after all, in a place where county supervisors let their
constituents into their homes to gripe until late into the evening.</TE>
<TE>   "Public service is so important," he says. "If you do it well, you
take care of the people and they take care of you."</TE>
<TE>   At the time, he told his wife that he would serve two years in
office--to make up for missing out on the Marines.</TE>
<TE>   In 1974, he won a seat on the Fresno County Republican Central
Committee. Two years later, he ran for 29th Assembly District seat, but
lost.</TE>
<TE>   "It was right after Watergate and you couldn't find a Republican
anywhere, it was so bad," Jones says.</TE>
<TE>   He learned a lesson: When he ran six years later, he hired the
winner's campaign consultant--and won.</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, Jones had found a job that he liked as much as
farming. So every time an election approached, he would sit down with his
wife and young daughters and ask them how they felt about enduring
another race.</TE>
<TE>   "Finally, as the girls got older . . . they would say 'Mom, Dad really
wants to talk about this again?' " Maurine says. "They didn't have any
understanding that it was any big deal. For them, it was just a way of
life."</TE>
<TE>   Each daughter has picked half of their father's vocation--one politics
and the other farming. Jones' younger daughter, Andrea, 24, worked as a
youth coordinator on McCain's presidential effort and headed the
unsuccessful 2000 U.S. Senate campaign for Republican Tom Campbell. Now
she is assisting her father.</TE>
<TE>   Jones' older daughter, Wendy, 27, is helping run the family farm with
her husband, Ryan Turner.</TE>
<TE>Solidly Conservative, but Independent</TE>
<TE>   In Sacramento, Jones quickly cemented his reputation as a solidly
conservative member of the Assembly minority. Even so, he avoided too
close a connection with a brash brand of Assembly Republicans who moved
even further to the right with a take-no-prisoners approach. He was
eventually rewarded for his independence.</TE>
<TE>   When the moderate Republicans decided in 1991 to oust their
confrontational leader, they turned to Jones.</TE>
<TE>   "He's fairly open to different ideas," says longtime GOP strategist
Tony Quinn. "He's pretty pragmatic as to how he approaches government
problems."</TE>
<TE>   As an assemblyman, he often carried measures protective of the
agriculture industry. Some of his colleagues said privately that Jones'
career was so focused on the Central Valley that he had little feel for
the gritty issues facing California's urban areas.</TE>
<TE>   Determined to prove them wrong, Jones broadened his focus, co-writing
in 1994 the three-strikes measure that required a sentence of 25 years to
life for those convicted of three serious felonies. It was the idea of
Fresno resident Mike Reynolds, whose daughter was murdered in a 1992
robbery.</TE>
<TE>   That same year, Jones ran for secretary of state, edging past his
Democratic rival by fewer than 40,000 votes of more than 7 million cast.
In 1998, he struggled again and barely won reelection.</TE>
<TE>   He vowed to run his office as a "nonpartisan referee" and indeed has
angered some members of his own party with his support of campaign
finance reform and the so-called blanket primary, an effort to increase
voter turnout by allowing all voters to vote for any candidate, not just
one from their party.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have praised Jones' performance
as secretary of state, calling him one of the best in generations. Yet
some have wondered if he has been too much of a maverick for his own
good.</TE>
<TE>   Though the secretary of state owed much to former Gov. Pete Wilson,
who handpicked the Fresno Republican to lead the Assembly's GOP caucus 10
years ago, the two men later disagreed over federal "motor voter"
legislation aimed at increasing registration.</TE>
<TE>   More damaging was his decision in spring 2000 to abandon his pledge to
back Bush and throw his support to McCain. At the time, Jones said he was
disappointed with Bush's attempts to dissuade Democrats and independents
from crossing over to vote in the Republican primary.</TE>
<TE>   His political consultant, Rollins, says he cautioned Jones against
changing his endorsement.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly he believed that McCain was the best guy at the time and he
did what he thought was right," Rollins says. "Bill has always done
that."</TE>
<TE>   But, he says: "It's not the sort of decision that a guy running for
governor would do. Obviously these political people are significant, and
they let him know they didn't look favorably upon what he did."</TE>
<TE>   Others were particularly perplexed because Jones had given Bush his
word, and the move cut against his image of rectitude.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes people question his political judgment," says veteran
consultant Rick Taylor.</TE>
<TE>   The uproar was somewhat lost on Jones.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt strongly that the state needed someone with as broad a voice
as possible," Jones says. "I had known John for quite awhile. . . . I
felt I needed to do what I felt was best for California."</TE>
<TE>   After the primary, he switched his support back to Bush. Jones still
drives around with a "Bush/Cheney Farm and Ranch Team" bumper sticker on
his truck.</TE>
<TE>   "The day after the primary, I supported the president," Jones says. "I
raised a quarter of a million dollars for him at my home. And I will
support him in the future. I'm very proud he's a Republican."</TE>
<TE>   But Jones got his comeuppance. While the president has not endorsed a
candidate in the GOP primary, he and his operatives encouraged Riordan
into the race, thereby saddling Jones with a multimillionaire opponent.</TE>
<TE>   At this late stage of the campaign, Jones continues to struggle to
raise cash. He's been forced to sit by as Riordan and Simon take to the
airwaves.</TE>
<TE>   Making matters worse, the nonpartisan nature of his job has left him
without the support of various interest groups who could take up some of
the slack. His campaign operation is minimal. While Riordan travels
around the state in a chartered jet and a luxury bus, Jones flies himself
to events in the same plane he uses to round up cattle.</TE>
<TE>   Struggling to make up for funding difficulties, he has sharpened his
tenor, bitterly criticizing his opponents at every turn.</TE>
<TE>   Jones tells audiences that his foes can "raise money but cannot raise
a record."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm the one with the experience to do this job," Jones says. "If I
thought the other candidates were qualified, I wouldn't be running."</TE>
<TE>   At a recent stop in Irvine, at a conference of Latino business people,
Jones blasted Riordan for proposing a "living wage" for workers in the
state.</TE>
<TE>   "The consequences of a massive increase in the minimum wage will be
throwing people out of work and slamming the doors of small and
medium-sized businesses," Jones says. "Everyone knows that, at least
everyone outside of Santa Monica."</TE>
<TE>   At an appearance in Sacramento, he accused Gov. Gray Davis of turning
the state's large surplus into a massive deficit.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a farmer and a rancher," he tells those gathered to hear him. "I
know the value of hard work and I know the stress and strains of meeting
a payroll and staying within budget.</TE>
<TE>   "The one thing I have learned both in business and politics is that to
succeed one must lead and to lead one must know where one wants to go."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, before Jones made his candidacy official, some GOP
strategists tried to get him out of the race, convinced that
circumstances were aligned against him.</TE>
<TE>   "I . . . all but begged him to run for lieutenant governor," says Dan
Schnur, a Republican consultant close to Jones. "I said, 'you will be
able to establish yourself for the future.' "</TE>
<TE>   But Jones brushed aside the suggestion.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'I'm not the kind of person who runs for office as a
steppingstone to the next one,' " Schnur says. "He believes he'll be a
better governor than the other three candidates. He said, 'Either I'll be
governor or I'll go home to the ranch.' "</TE>

<HD>A Call to Let Go of Hatred</HD>
<DH>The Nation of Islam's Tony Muhammad talks of healing and reaches
out to law enforcement as he reshapes the group's image in L.A.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERESA WATANABE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Among the judges, attorneys and Police Department brass who
recently gathered to honor Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard C. Parks, one
man stood out as a puzzle: Tony Muhammad, Western regional minister of
the Nation of Islam.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, that Nation, those hard-talking advocates of Islam and black
nationalism notorious for four decades of bad blood with law enforcement.
These are the guys who took on 75 LAPD officers in a 1962 shootout that
left one Nation member dead and 22 police and Muslims injured. A portrait
hangs in the lobby of their Vermont Avenue mosque of Oliver X. Beasley, a
member killed by sheriff's deputies in another shootout in 1990.</LD>
<LD>   Yet Muhammad came to the party, celebrating Parks' 37 years of
service, as a welcome guest. He thanked the chief for building bridges
with his members in a joint fight against crime. "For the first time in
history, there has been healing between the Nation of Islam and the Los
Angeles Police Department," Muhammad declared to the audience.</LD>
<TE>   Healing is not a word usually associated with the Nation of Islam or
its fiery leader, Louis Farrakhan. Among many African Americans, the
Nation has long been respected as a positive force: clean-cut Muslims in
suit and bow tie helping gang members get right, preaching a message of
black pride and self-sufficiency. Outside the black community, however,
the Nation has just as long been mistrusted as a militant, separatist,
race-baiting, Jew-hating sect of radical--and unorthodox--Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   But when Farrakhan kicks off the organization's annual meeting at the
Los Angeles Convention Center today--the first time the massive event
will be held outside his Chicago-area home base--the refrain of healing
will be everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   It is in the World Saviours' Day convention's theme: "Healing the
Wounds to Bring About a Universal Family." It is in the convention's
workshops--"Healing the Wounds Among the Children of Abraham," for
instance--and the wide call for people of all races and religions to
attend the convention, which is expected to draw more than 20,000.</TE>
<TE>   Farrakhan, 69, a skilled musician, will begin the five-day convention
tonight with a Beethoven violin concerto at the Cerritos Center for the
Performing Arts--"a healing piece for humanity," as Muhammad describes
it. The concert will pay tribute to Farrakhan's musical idol, Jascha
Heifetz--a Jew--along with Farrakhan's mother and two of the Nation of
Islam's founders.</TE>
<TE>   "This country is evolving, and we have to evolve, too, and let some of
the pain of the past go," Muhammad said, "because hate that grows in you
will kill you."</TE>
<TE>   Some skeptics doubt Farrakhan can cut loose his extensive baggage of
race-baiting to pursue a path of genuine healing.</TE>
<TE>   Vibert L. White Jr., a former Nation member and author of "Inside the
Nation of Islam," said Farrakhan's peace gestures in the last decade have
turned out to be more show than substance--whether to Jews or orthodox
Sunni Muslims, who regard the Nation's theology as heretical to authentic
Islamic doctrine. Reconciliation is the only way the Nation can survive,
since black separatism no longer sells in the African American community,
White said.</TE>
<TE>   Aminah McCloud, an Islamic studies professor at DePaul University in
Chicago, said Farrakhan began reaching out to whites, Latinos, Catholics
and Protestants in his home base more than a decade ago, but that such
overtures had drawn little notice nationally.</TE>
<TE>   Whether or not Farrakhan can convince his critics, Muhammad is clearly
reshaping the Nation's image in Los Angeles. "A brilliant, thoughtful and
effective leader," Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca calls him.</TE>
<TE>   The 44-year-old Atlanta native was one of the Nation of Islam's rising
stars, serving as an evangelist in the South when Farrakhan picked him
nearly seven years ago to resuscitate the faltering movement in Los
Angeles. According to Muhammad, Farrakhan told him that God had blessed
him with the power to unify people, and instructed him to begin building
broad coalitions with politicians, law enforcement and the crazy quilt of
ethnic and religious communities here.</TE>
<TE>   The outreach may be as much tactical as heartfelt. White said that
people were leaving the Nation "in droves" because of theological doubts,
harsh treatment and questions over financial management. In Los Angeles,
Muhammad Mosque No. 27 boasted 3,000 active members in its heyday,
according to members at the time; today Tony Muhammad said there are 500
to 1,000 core members, although he said thousands remain affiliated.</TE>
<TE>   Muhammad said reconciliation has always been the organization's goal,
pointing to its original statement of beliefs calling for a "universal
government of peace wherein we can all live in peace together." In the
days of Jim Crow laws and public lynchings, he said, peace was a pipe
dream, white folks were devils and injustice had to be fought viciously.
Now, he said, America has mellowed and the Nation must too.</TE>
<TE>   Farrakhan, at a speech in Los Angeles 18 months ago, said his
near-fatal bout of prostate cancer had added further impetus to seek
healing not only for blacks but all people.</TE>
<TE>   At least in Los Angeles, Nation members no longer overtly call for a
separatist state, although that demand remains in their national
newspaper, Final Call. Muhammad said a separatist state was only desired
if America remained intolerably unjust but, because of improvements, "We
can coexist."</TE>
<TE>   The Nation now has Latino members--such as Albert X., 25, who said he
never even knew the organization was mostly black, because it was
portrayed as a movement of unity, discipline and social justice by the
African American friend who brought him in. Some practices remain overtly
racist: Whites are still barred from attending the Nation's Sunday
services, although Muhammad said they will eventually be admitted after
blacks overcome their lingering, deep-seated feelings of inferiority.</TE>
<TE>   Despite such practices, Muhammad manages to disarm outsiders with
deference, Southern charm and an ability to talk gangspeak one moment and
high finance the next. He asks longtime social activists how he can serve
and support their community work, calls gang leaders "giants" and "heads
of state," respects elders with "yes sirs" and "no ma'ams." He tells
prisoners that "the white man is not your greatest enemy. Your greatest
enemy is sitting on top of your neck, and that's ignorance."</TE>
<TE>Getting Involved in Local Politics</TE>
<TE>   Under his leadership, Nation members who once rejected the U.S.
electoral system as corrupt and racist are now walking precincts for
local candidates. Last year, they turned out more than 140 volunteers for
San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown. They provided similar help to Los
Angeles mayoral candidate Antonio Villaraigosa--rejecting, like many
younger African Americans, the traditional black support for then-City
Atty. James K. Hahn and his legendary father, the late county Supervisor
Kenneth Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   During one campaign day last fall, for instance, Muhammad and
Villaraigosa gave each other the thumb's up before the minister headed
out to troll for votes. At a barber shop on Crenshaw Boulevard, Muhammad
told voters that Villaraigosa had championed the poor and worked to
improve family health care while Hahn had flopped trying to fight street
crime with injunctions against gang members.</TE>
<TE>   Muhammad himself ran--and, without campaigning, nearly won--a seat as
a delegate to the last Democratic National Convention, initially urged on
by Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles).</TE>
<TE>   In a demonstration of their new mainstream political strength,
Muhammad's troops managed to beat back a recent effort by the
Anti-Defamation League to overturn the Los Angeles City Council's waiver
of the $30,000 Convention Center fee for the Nation of Islam.</TE>
<TE>   The Nation of Islam was historically insular, separatist and overtly
hostile to outsiders. Today, when community volunteer Cynthia "Sister"
Mendenhall needs to feed someone, Muhammad brings by fish and vegetables.
When she needs security at a funeral or football game, Muhammad sends his
Fruit of Islam forces.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time I call him, he comes," said Mendenhall, a black Christian
who said she had no relations with the Nation of Islam before Muhammad
arrived and was taught growing up not to socialize with its members.</TE>
<TE>   Nation members are finally reconciling with followers of Imam W.D.
Muhammad, son of the founder of the Black Muslims, Elijah Muhammad. After
Elijah Muhammad's death in 1975, the son rejected the movement's belief
that his father's teacher, W. Fard Muhammad, was the messiah and moved
the organization into mainstream Sunni Islam. Farrakhan broke away and
reestablished the Nation of Islam with its original beliefs in Los
Angeles in 1977: This week's convention will mark the 25th anniversary of
that event.</TE>
<TE>   The two Muslim leaders publicly reconciled two years ago. Although
they have not bridged their theological differences, Imam Muhammad will
lead the convention's Friday prayer. The two movements have cooperated on
prison ministry efforts and took a joint tour through seven state prisons
last year. At Solano prison in Vacaville, for instance, Tony Muhammad
urged the mostly black inmates at his meeting to reconcile with their
brown brothers, join the peace movement breaking out among gangs and hit
the books for a better future.</TE>
<TE>Reaching Out to Other Communities</TE>
<TE>   Muhammad has also forged ties beyond the black community. He has
participated in sweat lodges with Native Americans. He has celebrated
Cinco de Mayo with Latinos and the Lunar New Year with Chinese. He said,
"I love a lot of young whites" he meets because they feel remorse for the
sins of their fathers against blacks.</TE>
<TE>   So far, Muhammad has not made headway in healing Farrakhan's most
fractured relationship--that with Jews. But Muhammad said he wants to
try. Last week, Muhammad met for the first time with Rabbi Abraham Cooper
of the Simon Wiesenthal Center to convey Farrakhan's desire for dialogue
and a visit to the Museum of Tolerance--where Farrakhan's own picture is
exhibited as a specimen of intolerance.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, Farrakhan has alleged that there was Jewish
participation in the slave trade and claimed that Jews dominate the media
and financial worlds. He is most reviled by Jews for statements calling
Judaism a "dirty religion" and saying Hitler was "a great man," although
Farrakhan said the quotes were taken out of context.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides described the 80-minute meeting as a cordial exchange
roaming across topics ranging from baseball to Farrakhan.</TE>
<TE>   But Cooper and the center's dean, Rabbi Marvin Hier, say they will not
meet with Farrakhan until he apologizes for his offenses against Jews in
a public forum, such as a news conference or published commentary.</TE>
<TE>   Cooper said other Jews had met with Farrakhan over the last few years,
but most felt "had" when the Muslim leader subsequently made statements
that offended them. In 1996, according to Hier, the World Jewish Congress
met with Farrakhan to start a rapprochement but ended the efforts when he
offended them the next day by comparing the plight of Iraqi children to
those who suffered in the Holocaust.</TE>
<TE>   Cooper called Muhammad "charismatic, engaging and open," but said it
was too soon to say whether local ties between Jews and the Nation could
be forged. Neither the Wiesenthal Center nor the Anti-Defamation League
have turned up any evidence of anti-Semitism from Muhammad, who
vigorously defends Farrakhan's statements about Jews as largely
misunderstood.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Muhammad voiced optimism after the meeting with Cooper.
"There were some philosophical differences, but not wide enough to
prevent a happy medium by which the two communities can move forward to
heal," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The most startling group of Muhammad's new friends can be found in law
enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   At the Parks reception, Muhammad moved comfortably through the crowd,
embracing the chief and LAPD Lt. Fred Booker, who calls the minister "a
great role model" for youth. Sheriff Baca counts himself an ally and
friend as well, working with Muhammad on gang problems, inmate
rehabilitation and other issues.</TE>
<TE>   "He understands better than any Nation of Islam minister I've been
exposed to the art of conflict resolution," Baca said.</TE>
<TE>   In response to a court order about five years ago, Baca recalled, his
deputies evicted Nation members from an Inglewood building they were
renting. Tension was mounting between the two sides, when Muhammad
averted possible violence by calling for peaceful compliance with the
court order and a meeting with deputies later to discuss their grievances
over it.</TE>
<TE>   Several days ago, Muhammad was holed up with 30 representatives from
some of the Southland's most notorious gangs--deadly enemies sharing the
only safe zone in town, the Nation of Islam's Muhammad Mosque No. 27 on
Vermont Avenue. The evening's agenda--to call for peace during the week
of the convention--was waylaid when two rival gangs brought in a
potentially explosive grievance. One gang had stolen a car belonging to
another, ripped off the rims and dumped it back in the enemy's territory.
The aggrieved party was about to retaliate. According to those present,
Muhammad coaxed the two sides to avoid violence, brokering a deal to buy
new rims as restitution.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes he does the unorthodox--like the time he invited 10 gang
members to learn etiquette at a four-course formal dinner in his home. He
said he wanted to teach them how to use a full set of silverware, expose
them to fine dining and view firsthand how to treat women graciously.
(Muhammad calls his wife, L'Tonya, "Queen"; the couple has two children,
Khallid, 13, and Aisha, 11.)</TE>
<TE>   "Minister Tony has opened doors for us major league, and we're
grateful," said Big Cat, an older member of the notorious Rollin 60s,
during a recent drive through his neighborhood. "We got somebody real,
and he needs help."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Muhammad has plenty of ideas for change, but not enough money
to fund them. He spins out visions of buying up homes for young men with
no place to go, calling them "Houses of Knowledge and Discipline." He
imagines buying up his block and building an AIDS treatment clinic, drug
rehabilitation center, gang-intervention program, a bank specializing in
small loans.</TE>
<TE>   Muhammad is starting to attract financial support for his work from
some celebrities, including Magic Johnson, radio host Steve Harvey and
record executive Russell Simmons. All three are co-sponsoring the
convention; Johnson has donated computers and Harvey helps out with the
food drive. Three times a year or so, Harvey said, he sends Muhammad to
his Sherman Oaks tailor to keep him in the fine Italian fabrics he
favors.</TE>
<TE>   Muhammad owns more than 40 suits, mostly custom designed; some 30
pairs of shoes, mostly from the celebrity shoe store C and E; and 22
hats. He said the taste for quality was cultivated during a career as a
real estate executive at a national fast-food restaurant chain, but that
most of his clothes today are gifts. After accepting Farrakhan's call to
full-time ministry in Los Angeles, he said, his salary plummeted to $300
a week.</TE>
<TE>   Muhammad was first inspired by Farrakhan in 1985. He said he was
cutting up a kilo of cocaine and listening to a friend's videotape of
Farrakhan. At the time, Muhammad said, he was utterly irreligious; he
detested the way his mother futilely prayed to a picture of a white Jesus
for salvation from poverty. He said he was working as a manager at
Eastern Airlines in Atlanta and making five times as much money dealing
drugs, which he would wrap around his waist and slip through unchecked by
airport security.</TE>
<TE>   In those days, Muhammad, an All-American in football and baseball, was
bitter over failing to become a pro athlete after graduating from college
in 1983, he said. He was hurt from growing up with a mother who drank in
despair over trying to raise 10 children and a father who rarely came
around lest the welfare payments stop. Telling the story now, he tears
up.</TE>
<TE>   Something about Farrakhan's voice mesmerized him. He said the Muslim
leader was railing against drug dealers as the "new devil of black
people," who nonetheless could rechannel their entrepreneurial energies
from community destruction to salvation. Muhammad said he flushed his
cocaine down the toilet and joined the Nation the next day.</TE>
<TE>   To talk about his private life openly makes him rare in the circle of
top Nation of Islam officials, even as it helps the Nation's outreach
efforts by softening its leaders' hard edges.</TE>
<TE>   It is part of the healing, Muhammad said. "I want to be open. I am
thankful to be open and tell people how I feel and what I feel, so all of
us can heal."</TE>

<HD>Oscar Nominees' List Rings of Reassurance</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a morning when news of the 74th Oscar nominations had to vie for
air time with reports of a new terrorism alert, the films that had the
most success with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences could
be summed up in a single word: reassuring. In fact, of the six films that
got five nominations or more, all but one can be seen as different forms
of cinematic comfort food.</LD>
<LD>   Though it has rarely been the academy's style to embrace probing,
difficult material, the year's events seemed to have--if
anything--increased its love of the familiar. As a result, four of the
five best picture nominees, even those with ostentatiously glitzy
exteriors like "Moulin Rouge," are conventional at their core. And, with
one exception (the exceptional "In the Bedroom"), films that didn't fit
that mold suffered in the voting.</LD>
<LD>   So the traditionally uplifting "A Beautiful Mind" was a big winner
Tuesday, scoring nominations in most of the major categories, while the
disquieting "Black Hawk Down" was something of a disappointment, failing
to get a best picture nod. Since Sept. 11, Hollywood has been trying to
gauge the national mood, and if academy voters reflect current tastes,
everyone wants movies that go down easy.</LD>
<TE>   Of course, there is comfort food and there is comfort food, and it is
heartening that the picture that got the most nominations (a near-record
13, including picture, direction, screenplay, cinematography and Ian
McKellen for best supporting actor) was the masterful "The Lord of the
Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring." It was encouraging that the academy
not only had no trouble differentiating this film from "Harry Potter and
the Sorcerer's Stone" (which managed only three nominations) but also
recognized that "Rings" was no ordinary colossus but one made with
intelligence and true emotion.</TE>
<TE>   Coming in behind "Rings" with eight nominations, including picture,
direction, screenplay and acting nods for Russell Crowe and Jennifer
Connelly, was "A Beautiful Mind." Though loosely based on the true story
of a schizophrenic math genius, "Mind" has had more nips and tucks done
to its underlying reality than a desperate trophy wife, all with the
object of making a troublesome, complicated reality into an
audience-pleasing, reassuring "one man overcomes adversity" movie.</TE>
<TE>   Tied with "Mind" in nominations is "Moulin Rouge." The academy was not
distracted by the film's jazzy style nor put off by its puerile script
(it's the only one of the five best picture nominees not to have a
screenplay nomination). What the voters saw was what old-timers Stanley
Donen and Robert Wise pointed out in "Moulin's" ads: This film's musical
heart is old-fashioned enough to fit right in at MGM half a century ago.
(The same situation holds true for the French film "Amelie," which had
five nominations, including best foreign language film, and whose cloying
nature was hard to miss despite a barrage of busy filmmaking).</TE>
<TE>   "Gosford Park," which finished fast to end up with seven nominations,
had the foresight to combine two familiar and much-loved genres: the
Agatha Christie country party whodunit and the kind of
upstairs-downstairs, smart servants-simple masters story that has been
popular at least since P.G. Wodehouse created Bertie Wooster and Jeeves.</TE>
<TE>   Only one non-feel-good movie prospered in this atmosphere, and that
was the decidedly somber, beautifully done "In the Bedroom," which had
five nominations, including best picture. A key reason was the strength
of the acting: "Bedroom" had three performance nominations (for Sissy
Spacek, Tom Wilkinson and Marisa Tomei), a figure matched only by the
"Iris" trio of Jim Broadbent, Judi Dench and Kate Winslet.</TE>
<TE>   Doubtless also a powerful factor in "In the Bedroom's" success with
the academy, as it was with that of the French-language "Amelie" and also
"Iris," was the power of Miramax's advertising and publicity campaign.
Though the company's trademark fiscal enthusiasm does not work in all
cases (the benighted "Shipping News" was shut out), it has given the
studio a record 11 best picture nominations in a 10-year period. And
there is something heartening about a film as good as "In the Bedroom"
getting the kind of recognition it likely would not have gotten absent
this kind of support.</TE>
<TE>   If "Bedroom" survived the happiness blitz, other disturbing films were
less successful. "Black Hawk Down" got four nominations, including best
director for Ridley Scott, but its reality and its uncompromising
intensity might have cost it a chance for best picture. Similarly,
critical favorite "Mulholland Drive" could manage only a best directing
nomination for David Lynch. Even the strength of Naomi Watts' acting
couldn't get her nominated or compensate for the film's spooky and
unapologetic non-linearity. More to the academy's liking was Renee
Zellweger's deft comic performance in the bubbly "Bridget Jones's Diary."</TE>
<TE>   As usual, the academy's writers branch came up with the most eclectic
nominations. The dark comedies "Ghost World" and "The Royal Tenenbaums"
received no other nominations besides best original screenplay, while the
backward thriller "Memento" (original screenplay) and the animated
"Shrek" (adapted screenplay) each received only one other nomination.</TE>
<TE>   Now it's on to the Academy Awards, which figure to be anything but
routine. There are reports of unprecedented security for the March 24
event, taking place at Oscar's new home, the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood.
Given all that's happened, some films that provide reassurance could be a
welcome distraction.</TE>

<HD>Jail Breakout Said to Split Arafat, Aide</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Reported clash with security chief over the release of
prisoners underscores the pressure on the Palestinian leader.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>In a sign that Israeli military and diplomatic pressure is opening
fissures in the Palestinian leadership, Yasser Arafat reportedly
denounced his West Bank security chief, Col. Jibril Rajoub, during a
violent argument Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Palestinian sources described what appeared to be a serious rupture in
relations between Arafat and one of his top officials. The Israeli
military claims that the Palestinian Authority president's ability to
control militias and even his own security forces is weakening.</LD>
<LD>   Arafat lashed out at Rajoub after the colonel's officers did nothing
to stop a mob in Hebron that freed 17 prisoners from the West Bank city's
jail Monday night, sources close to Rajoub said. The mob broke down the
jailhouse doors and helped inmates escape after Israel launched
airstrikes on a Gaza City security compound.</LD>
<TE>   The Hebron breakout, captured on video by television news crews,
embarrassed Arafat, who has been trying to convince the Bush
administration and the European Union that he is cracking down on gunmen,
said the sources, who requested anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Relations between Arafat and Rajoub have been strained recently by
policy disagreements and by comments from some Israeli officials that
they would like to see Rajoub replace Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's government has declared Arafat
"irrelevant" and refuses to deal with him. Israeli tanks have confined
the Palestinian leader to Ramallah in the West Bank for more than two
months as Israel has chipped away at the infrastructure of his regime.</TE>
<TE>Israel Aims to Weaken Arafat's Hold on Power</TE>
<TE>   As it has sought to weaken Arafat's grip on power, Israel has
increasingly targeted the many security forces that underpin his
government. Israeli airplanes and attack helicopters have destroyed
Palestinian police headquarters, jails and other security structures.
Dozens of Palestinian police and security officers have died in the air
raids, and more have been killed in clashes with Israeli troops.</TE>
<TE>   Israel says it has struck Palestinian security forces when they have
been involved in attacks on Israelis or have failed to prevent attacks.
It also holds Arafat responsible for the attacks, even when they are
carried out by groups opposed to the Palestinian Authority, such as Hamas
and Islamic Jihad. Israel says it will continue to hit Arafat's security
buildings until he takes strong measures against militants.</TE>
<TE>   The pressure on Palestinian security forces has had the side effect of
eroding the rule of law in Palestinian-controlled territories, where
citizens say they can no longer count on the police to investigate crimes
or capture criminals.</TE>
<TE>   "The police spend most of their time trying to protect themselves
these days," said Said Zeedani, director of the Palestinian Independent
Commission for Citizens' Rights, a human rights group based in Ramallah.</TE>
<TE>   From his office window, Zeedani can see Palestinian policemen sitting
under the olive trees outside their offices in a converted apartment
building they moved to after Israel destroyed their station. The officers
are too frightened to work in the building, which they expect will
eventually be targeted by the Israelis, he said. So they park their cars
far away and sit on chairs under the trees.</TE>
<TE>   Similar scenes can be found throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Security officers balance case files on their laps while sitting outside
buildings they fear might be hit.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, even egregious violations of public order are going
unchecked by security services in the Palestinian-controlled territories,
Zeedani said.</TE>
<TE>   Most recently, a mob of about 200 from the Kalandiyeh refugee camp
rioted on Ramallah's Main Street for four hours Jan. 31. The rioters
burned shops and homes belonging to the family of a man suspected of
killing a Kalandiyeh resident with whom he had fought after their cars
collided. Police did not intervene, Zeedani and witnesses said.</TE>
<TE>Vigilante Justice Reportedly on Rise</TE>
<TE>   Arafat formed a committee to look into the matter, but no arrests have
been made. Neither has anyone been arrested in the killing of three
prisoners by enraged rioters who stormed a makeshift courthouse in the
West Bank town of Jenin last month. The mob killed the three men, who had
been convicted of murdering a security officer, because they thought the
men's sentences were too light. In that case, police tried to protect the
prisoners--whose case could not be heard in a courtroom because the court
building had been destroyed in an Israeli airstrike--but the mob
overwhelmed the officers.</TE>
<TE>   Such instances of vigilante justice are mounting, Palestinians say, as
the Palestinian Authority's ability to enforce law and order wanes.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli strikes against jails have made it hard for the Palestinian
Authority to justify to its public the sort of arrest campaign that
Israelis, the Bush administration and others are demanding, Palestinian
officials say. In recent weeks, several gunmen have stormed prisons to
free detainees they say are at risk of being killed in Israeli air raids.
The mobs rarely encounter resistance from security officers.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as Israel bombards our security forces and our jails and our
civilian facilities, we are not committed to keep any prisoner in our
prisons," Rajoub's counterpart in the Gaza Strip, Col. Mohammed Dahlan,
said in an interview printed Tuesday in Al Quds, a Palestinian newspaper
published in mostly Arab East Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   "If Sharon kills and bombards our headquarters and our jails and
assassinates our cadres, then we will not keep anyone hostage to become
the victims of the Israeli bombardments," Dahlan said.</TE>
<TE>   Rajoub, who heads the powerful Preventive Security Apparatus, is
thought to have been pushing Arafat for months to rein in militants and
quell the Palestinian revolt in favor of a return to negotiations with
Israel. But Tuesday, Arafat accused him of failing to order his men to
defend the Hebron jail because the southern West Bank town is Rajoub's
birthplace and power base.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat grew so angry during their exchange that he waved his gun in
Rajoub's face, the sources close to Rajoub said. Alarmed by the
confrontation, senior Palestinian officials were said to be serving as
mediators between the two men Tuesday night. Neither Arafat nor Rajoub
could be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Rajoub has long been a controversial figure in the West Bank. A
onetime militant who spent years in Israeli prisons, he has built close
relations with Israeli security officials since the establishment of the
Palestinian Authority in 1994. His elaborate headquarters in Ramallah
have remained untouched by Israeli airstrikes and incursions, and he has
kept his several-thousand-strong force out of the fighting that has raged
since September 2000.</TE>
<TE>   But Rajoub has also repeatedly insisted that he is an Arafat loyalist
who has no intention of replacing the Palestinian leader.</TE>

<HD>South Koreans Feel Loss of Kin at Holiday Rites</HD>
<DH>Asia: During family-oriented Lunar New Year, the pain is fresh for
those separated by war half a century ago.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DORASAN, South Korea
</DL>
<LD>The retired teacher carried with him a package of dried squid, a
camera, a cane, two white chrysanthemums and a faded sepia photograph of
his parents.</LD>
<LD>   Bending on an arthritic knee and struggling to support himself and his
parcels with the cane, he carefully placed the squid and the two flowers,
one for each parent, on a makeshift altar in this divided peninsula's
demilitarized zone.</LD>
<LD>   It is a Korean tradition on the Lunar New Year to visit the hometown
of one's parents and make an offering of food to one's ancestors. But
80-year-old Kim Song Hyuk could get no closer to Kaesong, in North Korea,
than a wind-swept parking lot at the edge of the DMZ. To do so, he joined
about 650 other South Koreans with families in the North on a special New
Year's train ride Tuesday organized by the Korean National Railroad.</LD>
<TE>   "This is the tragedy of our people. What other people have been
separated for 50 years with no letters, no telephone calls?" said Kim,
who fled Kaesong on foot in 1951 during the Korean War, leaving his
parents and siblings behind.</TE>
<TE>   Half a century later, the pain is still fresh, especially on holidays,
for South Koreans such as Kim. For that reason, the South Korean railroad
organized the New Year's trip on a newly renovated line that, it is
hoped, will one day go all the way to the North Korean capital,
Pyongyang.</TE>
<TE>   As part of an agreement struck in June 2000 during a landmark summit
between South Korean President Kim Dae Jung and North Korean leader Kim
Jong Il, the railroad between the long-estranged Koreas was supposed to
be reconnected. South Korea recently finished a $150-million project to
rebuild its seven-mile stretch to the DMZ, but the North Koreans have not
yet done their section.</TE>
<TE>   Dorasan Station, the northernmost stop on the rebuilt line, is a
brand-new facility with shiny marble floors, clean restrooms, space for
customs and quarantine, and a sign directing prospective passengers to
the Pyongyang train. Signs on the platform inform travelers that the trip
to Pyongyang is a mere 205 kilometers, or 127 miles. But there are no
trains, and the prospects for them are dim, given that the reconciliation
process between the Koreas is at a standstill.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's New Year's train was the first to pull into Dorasan and
might be the only one for some time, except for symbolic visits.
(President Bush is expected to visit Dorasan next week during his trip
through Asia.) The train was greeted by a marching band in a short
opening ceremony. The station was festooned with ribbons and a large
banner proclaiming Dorasan "the road to unification and peace and
prosperity."</TE>
<TE>   Do Jeong Seok, a railroad spokesman, said that when the line between
South and North Korea is finally reconnected, it will prove an economic
boon because it will provide a land transport link to both Europe and
China.</TE>
<TE>   "You cannot calculate just in terms of money. This will be the
connection to all the continent," Do said.</TE>
<TE>   Son Hak Lae, the administrator of the railroad, said he hopes North
Korea plans to start work on its seven-mile stretch soon. President Kim
said last month that military intelligence had observed North Koreans
refurbishing a barracks near the defunct railroad and thought that might
be a precursor to work on the other side.</TE>
<TE>   The Korean families on the special train were less sanguine than the
officials. Many said they had made the trip because they didn't expect to
be allowed any closer to North Korea in their lifetimes.</TE>
<TE>   There have been no North-South family reunions for almost a year,
following the first ones in half a century in August 2000, and efforts by
South Korea's Unification Ministry to set up a reunion for this Lunar New
Year collapsed, leaving the train to the DMZ the families' best option.
The ministry reported that on a list of more than 100,000 South Koreans
applying for family reunifications, about 12% have died during the wait.</TE>
<TE>   The South Korean government said Tuesday that it is launching a
project to set up videophone conversations between separated families.</TE>
<TE>   "There is disappointment. We registered for family reunions, but
nothing happened," said Nam Moon Cha, 70, who was traveling with seven of
her grandchildren for the ancestral ceremonies. "We wanted the children
to know that they have a hometown over there that they maybe will never
visit."</TE>
<TE>   Even though the trip was in honor of the holiday and many of the
passengers wore traditional, brightly colored garments known as hanbok,
the ceremonies were hardly festive. As participants bowed solemnly before
a table laden with offerings of fish, fruits, wine and rice cakes, many
burst into tears.</TE>
<TE>   One woman threw her head back and started screaming toward the
mountains of North Korea, "Omonim! Omonim!" (Mother! Mother!) The woman,
59-year-old Han Un Suk, said she was taken out of the North during the
war as a 7-year-old by an aunt and has never been able to obtain any
information about her parents.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm old now, but I still miss my mother," Han said.</TE>
<TE>   Kim, the retired teacher, said the families have lowered their
expectations and now aspire only to find out what they can.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to reunite like the two Germanys, but we would be happy
only to get a letter or to make a telephone call," he said.</TE>

<HD>North Korea Frees Japanese Researcher</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOKYO
</DL>
<LD>North Korea released a Japanese researcher and former reporter
Tuesday after detaining him for two years on espionage charges, in an
apparent attempt to ease tensions with its neighbor and gain maneuvering
room. The move came less than a week before President Bush is to travel
to Tokyo and Seoul, two of North Korea's avowed enemies.</LD>
<LD>   "North Korea is sending a clear-cut message," said Satoshi Morimoto, a
North Korea expert with Tokyo's Takushoku University. "Money flowing to
Pyongyang [the North Korean capital] has almost stopped. And North Korea
is increasingly worried that the U.S. will expand its anti-terror
campaign against them."</LD>
<LD>   Economic researcher Takashi Sugishima, 62, a retired reporter for
Japan's influential Nihon Keizai financial daily, was seized on Dec. 4,
1999, while part of a delegation visiting Pyongyang. Authorities accused
him of spying for Japan and South Korea, a charge the two nations denied.</LD>
<TE>   Experts say Tuesday's release is part of a bid by Pyongyang to
sidestep the growing political and economic pressure it faces. The U.S.
campaign against terrorism had already made the Communist regime jittery
even before President Bush's State of the Union address last month
identified North Korea, along with Iraq and Iran, as part of an "axis of
evil."</TE>
<TE>   North Korea also finds itself financially strapped as is gears up for
the expensive two-month "Arirang" festival to mark the birthdays of its
leadership, designed to showcase the regime and maintain citizen loyalty.</TE>
<TE>   Japan, whose citizens are traditionally a major source of funding for
North Korea, recently raided the Chogin Tokyo Credit Union on suspicion
of financial irregularities, deterring many depositors. Chogin has
traditionally been a major conduit for money transferred by Japanese
residents of North Korean descent to relatives in the North.</TE>
<TE>   Japan is also taking a tougher line against North Korean seaborne and
airborne incursions, which experts cite as a key source of illicit drug
profits. In late December, Japan's navy chased a suspected North Korean
spy ship, which later sank.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea also finds its traditional contacts within Japan's ruling
Liberal Democratic Party closed off as public opinion toward Pyongyang
sours.</TE>
<TE>   "They're looking for some change with Japan, some sort of
improvement," said Masao Okonogi, a North Korea expert with Keio
University.</TE>
<TE>   Any thaw in relations faces huge hurdles, however, including war
reparations and a resolution of the fates of the estimated 70 Japanese
abducted from Europe or Japan by North Korean agents during the last 2
1/2 decades and forced to live in North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with the Yomiuri newspaper Tuesday, Sugishima said he
was confined to his room during his two-year captivity and watched
constantly by a minder. Whenever he was moved, he was blindfolded. He
received three meals a day, occasionally including white rice.</TE>

<HD>Israel Raids Gaza; 3 Reportedly Killed</HD>
<DH>Middle East: The army says the incursion into three towns is a
response to the Palestinians' use of the Kassam-2 rocket.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>Israeli tanks punched into the Gaza Strip late Tuesday, seizing
three Palestinian towns and a refugee camp, the army and Palestinian
sources said. Three Palestinian policemen were killed when their post was
shelled, Palestinian sources said.</LD>
<LD>   The Israeli operation began hours after Defense Minister Binyamin
Ben-Eliezer said Israel might recapture some Palestinian territory to
prevent rocket attacks on Israeli cities. The militant Islamic movement
Hamas fired a Kassam-2 rocket into the Negev desert Sunday. The rocket
caused no damage, but Israeli officials said the use of the weapon, which
can reach cities deep inside Israel, marked an escalation of the conflict
that has raged since September 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Israeli security sources said Palestinians fired two more Kassam-2
rockets Tuesday at Jewish settlements in the West Bank but did not hit
them. No one was injured.</LD>
<TE>   In a statement issued this morning, the army said tanks, infantry
troops and special forces were sent into the northern and central Gaza
Strip in response to the rocket attacks. It said it "seized territory . .
. where rockets and mortars are fired." Troops and tanks pulled out of
two of the towns before dawn, the army said, but remained in Beit Hanoun,
in northern Gaza, a town Israeli officials described as "a center of
terrorism from the Hamas movement."</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian security officials said the three police officers died in
Deir al Balah, a farming community in central Gaza that lies near a
Jewish settlement frequently targeted by Palestinian gunmen and hit by
Palestinian mortar shells. In a statement, the security service said the
police officers were "assassinated in cold blood." An army spokesman said
he was checking the report that the officers had been killed.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians said the Israelis destroyed three Palestinian posts on
the outskirts of Deir al Balah. The army said its troops exchanged
gunfire with Palestinians in Beit Hanoun, Beit Lahiya, Deir al Balah and
the Jabaliya refugee camp.</TE>
<TE>   In Jabaliya, militants called on refugees to resist the incursion,
broadcasting messages from mosque loudspeakers.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians said the Israelis arrested dozens of suspected militants
and were making house-to-house searches. Tanks reportedly surrounded the
partially destroyed house of Salah Shehada in Beit Hanoun. Shehada is a
high-ranking Hamas militant who is on Israel's list of wanted
Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Maj. Gen. Abdel Razek Majaydeh, chief of Palestinian police in Gaza,
issued a statement demanding an immediate withdrawal of Israeli forces
from all Palestinian areas in the Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   "What the Israeli occupation forces are doing is an aggression on our
unarmed Palestinian people," said Majaydeh. "This will not achieve
security for the Israelis but will increase the deterioration and the
danger in the situation."</TE>
<TE>   In its statement, the army said arrests had been made during its
operation but declined to say how many. The army did not say how long its
forces would remain in Beit Hanoun.</TE>
<TE>   Ben-Eliezer, Israel's defense minister, told reporters Tuesday that
"the Kassam-2 is something that crosses all our red lines" because of its
range of about five miles.</TE>

<HD>Pakistan Seizes Kidnap Suspect</HD>
<DH>Asia: Police capture Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh after stakeout,
raising hopes that U.S. reporter will be freed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFFREY MOHAN</AU>
<AU>JEFFREY GETTLEMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>KARACHI, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>The top suspect in the kidnapping of Wall Street Journal reporter
Daniel Pearl has been captured and has told police that the correspondent
is alive.</LD>
<LD>   The arrest of Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh on Tuesday in the eastern city
of Lahore came after Sheikh returned to a family member's home, where
authorities who were monitoring his telephone calls lay in wait.</LD>
<LD>   "We were on a stakeout Tuesday morning," said Javed Noor, deputy
inspector general of police in Lahore. "We sat outside the home until
Sheikh showed up. He was not surprised. He didn't put up a fight. He was
not armed. He was very cool."</LD>
<TE>   The arrest raised hopes that Pearl, 38, would be freed soon, three
weeks after his disappearance in Karachi, the port city where he came to
investigate alleged connections between an extremist Islamic group and
accused "shoe bomber" Richard C. Reid.</TE>
<TE>   It was not immediately clear, however, whether Sheikh gave
investigators information about Pearl's whereabouts.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after his arrest, investigators hustled Sheikh off to Karachi
under heavy guard and appeared to be hurrying to resolve the kidnapping
case that has added tension to U.S.-Pakistani relations. President Pervez
Musharraf is in Washington for a meeting today with President Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Aided by FBI agents, police from Punjab province, where Lahore is
located, tracked down Sheikh by studying records of cell phone calls made
by two Sheikh associates arrested in Islamabad, the capital, Noor said.
The suspects, whose names have not been released, made numerous calls to
the house where Sheikh was apprehended.</TE>
<TE>   "The FBI provided great technical assistance in all this," said Javed
Iqbal Cheema, director general of the crisis management division of the
Interior Ministry. "It's too early to tell when Daniel will be recovered,
but we have been told he is alive. And we hope it will be soon."</TE>
<TE>   The arrest boosted hopes among U.S. officials, family members and
colleagues who have weathered weeks of promises, predictions, speculation
and hoaxes concerning Pearl's fate.</TE>
<TE>   "Things are moving now," one American diplomat said Tuesday night. "We
hadn't lost hope--nobody here had. But the arrest is a great break. The
guy they got, he's the main one. We're hoping he'll lead us to Pearl."</TE>
<TE>   The diplomat, who asked that his name not be used, said FBI agents had
been working closely with their Pakistani counterparts over the last few
days. He said he didn't know whether any American agents were in Lahore
when Sheikh was apprehended.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very worthy breakthrough," said Syed Kamel Shah, the police
inspector general for Sindh province, where Karachi is located. "The
results will be, and we hope soon, to see Daniel Pearl."</TE>
<TE>   Sheikh, a 27-year-old British citizen, has ties to Pakistani Islamic
extremist groups as well as the Al Qaeda network. Indian intelligence
officials suspect that he is behind an attack last month on the American
Center in Calcutta and have said they believe that he may have wired
money to Mohamed Atta, the suspected ringleader of the suicide hijackers
who attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   Educated at elite British institutions, including the London School of
Economics, Sheikh joined the Islamic "holy war" after a summer spent in
Bosnia-Herzegovina aiding Muslim war victims.</TE>
<TE>   Since Pearl's disappearance, Pakistani authorities have detained about
a dozen people and raided homes in several provinces. They have also
detained an unknown number of Sheikh's relatives in an acknowledged
attempt to put pressure on him to surrender.</TE>
<TE>   Three men have been charged as accomplices to the kidnapping after
investigators discovered electronic evidence that they had sent two
e-mail announcements of the abduction from a group dubbed the National
Movement for the Restoration of Pakistani Sovereignty. One or more of
those suspects told authorities they sent the messages at Sheikh's
behest, according to investigators.</TE>
<TE>   In angry anti-American tones, the hitherto unknown group vowed to kill
Pearl and demanded, among other things, the release of Pakistanis
detained during the U.S. war on Afghanistan and of the former Taliban
ambassador to Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   The three e-mail suspects appeared at a hearing in Karachi under
extremely tight security earlier Tuesday. Hooded, shackled and escorted
by guards wearing protective vests, Fahad Naseem, Sheikh Adil and Salman
Saquib stepped out of an armored personnel carrier into a phalanx of
cameras. After a brief appearance, they were ordered held without bail
for an additional 14 days.</TE>
<TE>   Until he was named a top suspect last week, Sheikh had moved about
Pakistan without apparent impediments from authorities despite his role
in kidnapping foreign hikers in the Indian-controlled part of the
disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir--for which he was imprisoned by
Indian authorities in 1994. Five years later, he was freed as part of a
deal with hijackers of an Indian Airlines jet.</TE>

<HD>Afghan Officials Expect Surrender of Top Taliban</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KANDAHAR, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>More than a dozen fugitive Taliban leaders--including the deposed
regime's chief, Mullah Mohammed Omar--are preparing to come out of hiding
and turn themselves in to Afghan and U.S. authorities, according to
officials in the southern province of Kandahar.</LD>
<LD>   "Right now we are in contact with more than 15 senior Taliban
leaders," said Khalid Pushtoon, an aide to Kandahar Gov. Gul Agha
Shirzai. "We are trying to convince them that they will be treated with
dignity and honor."</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, the Taliban foreign minister, Wakil Ahmed Mutawakel, turned
himself in to Afghan authorities and was escorted to the U.S. military
base at the city of Kandahar's airport.</LD>
<TE>   Details and conditions of his surrender remained murky four days
later. Pushtoon said that was by design, because he and Shirzai were
working to persuade the rest of the Taliban Cabinet to follow in
Mutawakel's footsteps.</TE>
<TE>   At a security meeting at his headquarters, Shirzai said he was
confident that Omar would not remain at large much longer.</TE>
<TE>   "Our efforts [in] searching for Mullah Omar are continuing, and soon
you will learn about his surrender too," Shirzai said.</TE>
<TE>   Mutawakel's surrender was carried out in secret. Kandahar's police
chief, military commander and chief of military intelligence acknowledged
in separate interviews that they had not been informed of it either
before or immediately afterward.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon, as well as Shirzai, confirmed that Mutawakel surrendered
to Afghan authorities, not to U.S. forces as some had presumed. The
governor was in Europe at the time but said Pushtoon handled the
surrender in his absence and personally escorted Mutawakel to the U.S.
base, which has a large detention facility. Afghan officials provided no
other details.</TE>
<TE>   Secondhand reports suggest that Taliban leaders have remained in
hiding largely in and around the Pakistani city of Quetta. Mutawakel
apparently crossed into Afghanistan secretly early Friday with the
intention of surrendering.</TE>
<TE>   "Nowadays, the condition of Taliban leaders is very, very bad, and
they can't find a suitable place to stay," said Zabed Akram, Kandahar's
police chief. "A Taliban leader recently contacted me and said the
Pakistani police and the United States are getting closer every day."</TE>
<TE>   Pushtoon said that since surrendering, Mutawakel has been undergoing
questioning by U.S. officials at one of perhaps half a dozen American
military facilities in and around Kandahar. As the highest-ranking
Taliban leader in custody, he is expected to provide valuable
intelligence to the United States, possibly including information on the
whereabouts of Osama bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   Mutawakel is believed to have been among the most moderate of the
Taliban leaders. He is said to have argued in favor of turning Bin Laden
over to the U.S. after Sept. 11, a stance that reportedly caused a
falling-out with Omar and other Taliban leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Pushtoon said that because Mutawakel has agreed to cooperate with the
United States, he will not be prosecuted. Other Taliban leaders who
surrender can expect the same treatment as long as they are not
personally responsible for crimes or serious abuses, Pushtoon said.</TE>
<TE>   At least some Afghan officials said they did not believe that
Mutawakel should have been turned over to the U.S. and would have
preferred that his case be handled by Afghanistan's interim government
and newly appointed supreme court.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to understand myself why he surrendered to U.S. troops and not
to Afghans," said Khan Mohammed, military commander of Kandahar. "I think
our supreme court should decide what will happen with him."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, declaring that his province had achieved a degree of
stability unknown for nearly three decades, Shirzai lifted a curfew
Tuesday, proclaiming what he called Afghanistan's first night of freedom.</TE>
<TE>   However, little change was visible on the streets after 9 p.m. Several
police officers said the curfew had been loosely enforced anyway, adding
that they had received no new orders to alter their procedures for
checking vehicles and pedestrians. By 10 p.m., the city was empty of
pedestrians and private vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Shirzai also announced that the opium market in central Kandahar had
been shuttered, the first step toward the eradication of opium production
in the region.</TE>

<HD>Terrorism Link Probed in Woman's Fatal Car Crash in Tennessee</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A mysterious car crash outside Memphis is fueling questions about
possible terrorist links involving five Middle Easterners charged with
buying fake driver's licenses in Tennessee.</LD>
<LD>   Katherine Smith, a Tennessee driver's license examiner charged with
furnishing the fake licenses, had been due to appear in court Monday in a
detention hearing for her five alleged co-conspirators.</LD>
<LD>   But early Sunday morning, Smith was found dead in a rural area outside
Memphis after her car apparently ran off the highway, struck a traffic
light pole and burst into flames.</LD>
<TE>   "The timing is odd," George Bolds, spokesman for the FBI in Memphis,
said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   "There was definitely an intense fire inside the car," he said. "She
was burned beyond recognition, and we had to use dental records to
identify her. For accidents like this--hitting a light pole--that's not
normally something that leads to a big fire and burns up the driver."</TE>
<TE>   The gas tank did not explode and the car appeared only slightly dented
from the impact, officials said. Bolds said investigators are trying to
determine the cause of the crash and are looking for accelerants that
might have caused the quick spread of the fire.</TE>
<TE>   While the crash could have been an accident, he added that "if there
were individuals involved with her [in the driver's license scheme] who
were concerned about their participation being known as a result of her
prosecution, they might have a motive to do her harm."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said Monday in Memphis federal court that they believed
there may be "connections" between the five remaining defendants and the
Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys charged in court that the only reason prosecutors
raised the terrorism issue is because the defendants are from the Middle
East. And authorities conceded they do not have evidence "at this time"
that any of the five defendants, all of whom remain in custody, is a
terrorist.</TE>
<TE>   But the FBI remains interested in possible terrorism links.
Investigators say one of the defendants, 31-year-old Khaled Odtllah,
drove from New York City to Memphis on Sept. 11, while a second
defendant, 24-year-old Sakhera Hammad, had in his wallet a visitor's pass
from the World Trade Center dated Sept. 5. Several of the defendants
apparently lived in the New York area and were in the United States
illegally, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Hammad told authorities that he had the World Trade Center pass
because he was working with a plumbing crew in the building, Bolds said.
"That could be true, but it's one of those things you need to check out,"
he said.</TE>

<LD>A man charged with lying about his association with a Sept. 11
hijacker repeatedly changed his story during interviews with FBI agents
over two days, a prosecutor charged.</LD>
<LD>   Faisal Al Salmi first told agents he didn't know hijacker Hani
Hanjour, Assistant U.S. Atty. Peter Sexton said during opening statements
in Al Salmi's trial.</LD>
<LD>   But in another interview, Al Salmi told agents he had been with
Hanjour on 10 different occasions over several years, Sexton said. He
later said he had only met Hanjour twice at mosque during late 2000 and
had a brief conversation with him about aviation.</LD>

<LD>Media mogul Ted Turner said the Sept. 11 attacks were an act of
desperation, and the hijackers were "brave" but probably "a little nuts."</LD>
<LD>   Turner, in a lecture at Brown University in Providence, also compared
President Bush to Julius Caesar.</LD>
<LD>   In a wide-ranging address, the AOL Time Warner vice chairman said the
attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were an outgrowth of
poverty.</LD>

<LD>John Walker Lindh's trial should begin no earlier than
mid-November, the government and defense said in Alexandria in a rare
agreement on the eve of the arraignment for the young American who fought
with the Taliban.</LD>
<LD>   The defense said it would need time to conduct overseas
investigations, handle classified information, argue for suppression of
evidence and allow the effects of prejudicial publicity to fade.</LD>
<LD>   Federal prosecutors said they disagreed with a delay because of
publicity but accepted the other reasons for a November date.</LD>
<TE>   The proposed timetable, in an unusual written motion signed by both
sides, will be discussed today at Lindh's arraignment before U.S.

<HD>Public Notes Alert but It's Business as Usual</HD>
<DH>Security: Americans are still trying to come to grips with the new,
post-Sept. 11 normality.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN GARVEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>There among the reports of stolen cars and petty burglaries
spilling out of the old-fashioned teletype machine at police headquarters
in Colonie, N.Y., Monday night was the FBI notice to be on the lookout
for 13 suspected terrorists.</LD>
<LD>   Next to it sat a new computer terminal dedicated to warning of
terrorist threats. It remained silent, not yet operational.</LD>
<LD>   The scene reflected the country's uncertainty as Americans grappled
with the heightened awareness of potential terrorism.</LD>
<TE>   For the most part, they went about their business despite the FBI
notice. But they couldn't shake the notion that they were in more danger
than they had known before terrorists struck on Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "We are deploying our resources and manpower today in the exact same
way as yesterday," Colonie Police Chief John Grebert said. "Without more
specific targets being named, that's all we can do. But I understand
perfectly that these alerts serve a useful purpose--keeping the average
citizen aware."</TE>
<TE>   Average citizens did indeed seem aware. Many said that, while they
were alarmed by warnings from federal officials that more attacks were
virtually certain, they were trying to get on with their lives.</TE>
<TE>   So in the face of the latest reminder that terrorists might be
plotting against the United States, airline flights went on as scheduled.
Travel plans remained intact. Commuter trains were packed.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, checkpoints for trucks near the Capitol were restored,
and security appeared tighter.</TE>
<TE>   At the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, officials said they made
sure the appropriate security forces there had the FBI photos and names
in hand, although they noted that nothing in the known threat was
connected directly to the Games.</TE>
<TE>   "In essence, we're doing nothing differently in the realm of security
today," said Dave Tubbs, director of the Olympic Public Safety Command.
"Frankly, we can't see anything else we can do. We're satisfied with our
plan."</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, the latest FBI alert may have delayed a decision by
Mayor James K. Hahn's administration to remove barriers blocking Main,
Los Angeles and San Pedro streets near City Hall and Parker Center, the
police headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   "The mayor is interested in seeing the streets reopened as long as we
have a confidence level that we can keep the visitors and employees in
Civic Center safe," said Deputy Mayor Matt Middlebrook.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been on a heightened alert right along," said police spokesman
Sgt. John Pasquariello.</TE>
<TE>   In Seattle, under sunny skies at Pike Place Market, Greg Marks, 27,
bought flowers for a friend and walked among the lunchtime crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard about [the warning] on the radio this morning. It's hard to
get really worked up about it though," said Marks, who added that he
already has had to deal with revelations that local targets were found in
computers in Afghanistan. "Life has to go on. If we live in fear, then
the bad guys win."</TE>
<TE>Possible Al Qaeda Connection Emerges</TE>
<TE>   Monday's alert made no mention of Al Qaeda, but Atty. Gen. John
Ashcroft said in an appearance in Texas on Tuesday that those named in
the alert "may be associated with Osama bin Laden or the Al Qaeda network
and . . . may be planning attacks on U.S. interests."</TE>
<TE>   A Justice Department official said the Al Qaeda connection was based
on new intelligence gathered since Monday's alert. Officials said the
suspects could be planning attacks as early as Tuesday, based on
information culled from sources in Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials said the alert was issued to keep the public aware.</TE>
<TE>   "There is nothing different to be done," said Gordon Johndroe, a
spokesman for the Office of Homeland Security. "This isn't a raising of
the alert status. It's literally an APB. We've got names and we've got
pictures."</TE>
<TE>   Past FBI warnings, including three nationwide alerts since Sept. 11,
have drawn concerns from police and the public about a "Chicken Little"
syndrome, with frequent alerts leading the public to grow cavalier about
possible risks.</TE>
<TE>   But FBI officials said they had heard no similar negative reaction
after Monday's warning.</TE>
<TE>   "It was clear this time what was being sought--here's names and
pictures and specific information. It's in harmony with our trying to get
out more information," said an FBI official who asked not to be
identified.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft, in his San Antonio appearance, said: "While this alert is
not specific to any particular locality, I want to encourage all law
enforcement officials, and, frankly, all Americans everywhere, to be on
the highest state of alert in regard to these individuals. I encourage
individuals to report anything that they consider to be suspicious."</TE>

Washington, John J. Goldman in New York, Julie Cart in Salt Lake City and
Kenneth Reich in Los Angeles, and researchers Edith Stanley in Atlanta

<DH>Aid: Russia agrees to sell military spare parts to Afghans and help
with logistics, army-building.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN DIXON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW
</DL>
<LD>Afghanistan doesn't need any more weapons, the nation's defense
minister, Mohammed Qassim Fahim, said at a news conference here Tuesday.
But with nearly all its equipment Soviet- or Russian-made, and much of
that in disrepair, what it does need are spare parts and technical help.</LD>
<LD>   In response, Russian Defense Minister Sergei B. Ivanov promised to
sell the country military spare parts and provide help with logistics and
the creation of a national army. He even held out the possibility of
offering training planes and transport helicopters in the future.</LD>
<LD>   But Ivanov ruled out sending Russian military advisors, saying there
is no need for them given the Afghans' military experience.</LD>
<TE>   "These commanders have been fighting for 20 years. What other
education could they need? They received the most important education
long ago. They are mature, experienced commanders. What is there we can
teach them?" Ivanov said, jovially suggesting that the Afghans could
teach Russians a thing or two about combat tactics.</TE>
<TE>   In a situation rich in irony, Russian leaders have promised to help
Afghanistan rebuild after 23 years of war that began with an invasion by
the Soviet Union in 1979.</TE>
<TE>   The Kremlin, which for years armed the Northern Alliance, the core
force that helped dislodge the ruling Taliban, is eager to maintain its
influence in Afghanistan. And soon after the Taliban fled the Afghan
capital, Kabul, in mid-November, Russia built a makeshift hospital in the
city and sent experts to help repair the Soviet-built Salang Tunnel
between Kabul and the north.</TE>
<TE>   Russia's military aid to the Northern Alliance after the Taliban came
to power stemmed from Moscow's concern that an extremist Islamic movement
could spread from Afghanistan to former Soviet republics in Central Asia,
which is viewed by Moscow as within its sphere of interest.</TE>
<TE>   Ivanov said Moscow's main concerns in the region are preventing
terrorists from maintaining training camps in Afghanistan and stemming
the flow of drugs from the country.</TE>
<TE>   At a 61-nation conference on Afghan aid last month in Tokyo, where
participants pledged $4.5 billion to help rebuild the country, Russia did
not commit itself to a specific amount but promised technical and
engineering expertise and assistance in clearing mines.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Fahim said Afghanistan still looks to Moscow for help.</TE>
<TE>   "The people of Afghanistan count on the Russian Federation--just as
they did during our fight against the Taliban regime--to render us
invaluable assistance and to take an active part in rebuilding
Afghanistan in the future," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Later Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir V. Putin added his weight to
his nation's pledge of support in a meeting with Fahim.</TE>
<TE>   "A new stage has begun now," Putin said. "A stage of economic
rebuilding, the restoration of the social and humanitarian sphere, and
the building of the political sphere. Russia is ready to make an adequate
contribution in all aspects of this cooperation."</TE>
<TE>   Ivanov emphasized that Russia was responding to an Afghan request for
help, not trying to force itself on Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   He said it is natural that Afghanistan would rely on Russia for help
in maintaining Soviet- and Russian-made arms and rebuilding energy
facilities.</TE>
<TE>   The Russian defense minister refused to elaborate on the cost of
Moscow's support but said his government does not want to consume the
sparse funds Afghanistan has. It is much cheaper for Afghanistan to buy
spare parts than new military equipment, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ivanov said Russia might offer training planes, transport helicopters
and communication systems to Afghanistan in the future.</TE>

<HD>Villagers Tell of U.S. Bombing</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: Survivors of October attack say 21 people, mostly
women and children, died. U.S. officials deny that civilians were hit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC SLATER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>THORAI, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>On an October night two weeks after the U.S. bombing campaign
started, 27 members of two extended families crowded onto a trailer
hitched to a red tractor to ride to safety in the mountains. But
warplanes attacked three times in 40 minutes, survivors and witnesses
say, killing 17 children and four adults.</LD>
<LD>   The first strike hit the trailer. Most survivors were taken to the
guest house of a nearby home, nearly a dozen witnesses said. Half an hour
later, two bombs slammed into the guest house, killing all the survivors
inside, they said. Ten minutes after that, a plane dropped a final bomb
on the trailer outside.</LD>
<LD>   Of the original 27 passengers, only six survived: four who had been
injured but were placed in a different room at the home, and two who were
being cared for at a different house.</LD>
<TE>   As the fighting in Afghanistan ebbs, details of U.S. successes and
failures are slowly emerging. The bombing in this tiny village in
south-central Afghanistan demonstrates the limits of spy satellites,
unmanned observation planes and on-the-ground intelligence in a murky
conflict in which Afghan forces regularly changed sides and enemies
traveled on anything from donkeys to pickup trucks to tractors.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. military officials say precision-guided munitions were dropped in
the area Oct. 21, the day the Afghans say the attack occurred. But the
Americans say they have no evidence that civilians were hit.</TE>
<TE>   The victims' relatives say most of the trailer's passengers were
children. Three of the six survivors are women, two are young girls, and
one is a 1 1/2-year-old boy with a sliver of shrapnel in his foot.</TE>
<TE>   "They say they can see everyone from the sky," said one man,
22-year-old Qudratullah. "They said they wouldn't kill civilians."</TE>
<TE>   Qudratullah lost a brother, a sister, a sister-in-law, two nieces and
four nephews in the attack. The fact that he's not certain where some of
them are buried is an indication of the confusion of that night, which
has yet to end for the families.</TE>
<TE>   A quarter of a mile from where the tractor was hit, across a hard,
unplanted wheat field, hundreds of strands of brightly colored ribbon,
embroidered banners and the blast-scarred clothing of the dead wave in
the wind at the cemetery.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps six children are buried under one pile of stones, relatives
say, and four more under another. Many bodies were in pieces, they say,
and because the villagers were worried that the planes would return, they
interred them all by noon the next day.</TE>
<TE>   But the planes never came back, people say. They don't know why this
collection of mud houses and desiccated farm fields was hit.</TE>
<TE>   "We are alone here," said Hayatullah, Qudratullah's father and the
patriarch of one of the village families, standing outside his mud
farmhouse. "There is no house next to me, no Taliban, no Al Qaeda. . . .
They hit civilians. They destroyed our lives. We miss our family."</TE>
<TE>   The bombs began falling about 8 p.m., first on a Taliban military
compound less than two miles west, in Tarin Kowt, a day's drive north of
Kandahar and the capital of Oruzgan province.</TE>
<TE>   The birthplace of Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar, Oruzgan had
long been a Taliban stronghold, with many members of the regime's
leadership hailing from Tarin Kowt.</TE>
<TE>   In late October, Tarin Kowt was a hot target for U.S. pilots. Army Lt.
Col. Jim Yonts, a spokesman for the U.S. Central Command, said American
forces attacked a compound near Tarin Kowt on Oct. 21 that had been
identified by intelligence analysts as a Taliban command-and-control
complex.</TE>
<TE>   "Our indicators, through imagery post- and pre-strike, [do] not
support the claim that families and children were killed," Yonts said.
"We don't have any indications that this happened."</TE>
<TE>   Yonts said intelligence analysts had been tracking movements at the
facility for several days before the strike. He said all the munitions
destroyed their intended targets.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a target that we identified early on," Yonts said. "We
tracked it and came back in and struck it."</TE>
<TE>   But Afghan troops loyal to the new government, who now occupy the
compound, said Tuesday that most of the Taliban soldiers at the base had
fled by the time the Americans attacked, knowing it would be targeted.</TE>
<TE>   The 10 or 12 who stayed behind are believed to have escaped unharmed,
despite the fact that bombs hit a mosque, a munitions storage area and
barracks.</TE>
<TE>   The families in Thorai, one led by Hayatullah, the other by a farmer
named Abdul Qudus Khan, heard the bombs but worried little at first. Both
homes are in the middle of fields, inaccessible even by car. There was
nothing here to bomb, they reasoned.</TE>
<TE>   But Fazal Rabi, 30, one of Khan's sons, decided to get the family
tractor and move women and children farther west into the mountains just
in case. Rabi, who would stay to keep watch on his house, would lose a
daughter, two sons, his mother, two sisters, two nieces, three brothers
and a sister-in-law.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Rabi had loaded his family members onto the trailer,
Hayatullah and his son Qudratullah had decided to move most of their
family members too. A bomb had just exploded 12 feet from Qudratullah's
bedroom, caving in much of the wall and blasting apart apricot trees with
hunks of shrapnel that still litter the place.</TE>
<TE>   Members of Hayatullah's family climbed aboard the trailer and together
the group began heading toward the mountains. Qudratullah, his father and
some other men stayed behind.</TE>
<TE>   When they were less than half a mile down the road, they heard the
planes coming in from the west, from Tarin Kowt.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw a flash in the sky," said Radigul, 23, Rabi's wife. "The planes
came in so low. We turned out the lights on the tractor."</TE>
<TE>   The blackout didn't help. The first blast hit the front of the
trailer, where three of her children were sitting. When she woke--blind
in her right eye and her right arm crippled--her children had already
been in their shared graves for three days.</TE>
<TE>   Salam Jan, who lives nearby, ran out to help. The men from both
families also ran in the direction of the explosion, fearing the worst.
Qudratullah shouted, "Ghani! Ghani!" as he ran. His older brother, Abdul
Ghani, had been driving the tractor. Ghani had been blown well forward,
but he was alive.</TE>
<TE>   As fast as they could, villagers carried the dead and wounded in
shawls and blankets into Jan's guest house. When it filled up, they put
four people in another room and two in a nearby house. They were the only
six of the original 27 to survive.</TE>
<TE>   As villagers treated the wounded and searched for more remains, two
planes came in again, this time from the north. People at Jan's house saw
two streaks of light. This time, the guest house appeared to take a
direct hit.</TE>
<TE>   In a potato sack, Jan keeps pieces of the bomb, some plastic, some
lightweight metal, some jagged iron. More are littered outside his house.
The words "NO LIFT" can be seen on two pieces that appear to be part of
the fins from a bomb.</TE>
<TE>   Ten minutes after the guest house was hit, the final strike came,
leaving a crater 10 feet in diameter, half in the road and half in Jan's
yard.</TE>
<TE>   Several hundred people came to help dig graves in the hard earth and
to pray. Most intact bodies were put in separate graves, while body parts
were placed in one of the mass graves.</TE>
<TE>   Infertile women now come to pray at the site, asking for a child.
Brothers and husbands and daughters and wives tie ribbons and strings to
the tall wooden poles that act as headstones.</TE>
<TE>   Qudratullah can't fathom why the U.S.--if it can tell who's Taliban
and who's not from outer space and detect guns in buildings, as he's
heard--would bomb a tractor towing a trailer packed with women and
children.</TE>

<HD>Wood With Arsenic to Be Phased Out</HD>
<DH>Health: Producers of pesticide and the EPA reach agreement on the
lumber additive but say there is no proof that it is hazardous.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Environmental Protection Agency announced Tuesday that
arsenic-treated lumber--the green-tinted wood on decks and play sets
across the country--will be phased out of the residential market over the
next two years.</LD>
<LD>   The voluntary decision by producers to pull the arsenic-treated
lumber, known to most do-it-yourselfers as pressure-treated wood, off the
market was the result of months of negotiations between the EPA and the
companies that produce the pesticide.</LD>
<LD>   The companies launched the talks in response to mounting pressure from
environmentalists and consumers who fear that the ubiquitous product puts
children at risk of developing cancer.</LD>
<TE>   Scientists who have studied lumber treated with arsenic, a known human
carcinogen, say children can be exposed to the toxin simply by touching
the wood and then putting their fingers in their mouths. Repeated
exposures increase the risk.</TE>
<TE>   But the EPA, in announcing the decision to take the product off the
market, confused the issue somewhat by saying that it has not concluded
that arsenic-treated wood on decks, picnic tables and play sets poses
"unreasonable risks to the public."</TE>
<TE>   The agency is reviewing the product and will publish a preliminary
risk assessment next year. In the meantime, EPA officials said parents
and homeowners do not need to replace decks or play sets made with the
product or worry about the arsenic-treated lumber still for sale at
lumber yards and in home-improvement stores.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists, however, warned that arsenic levels in treated
lumber are so high that parents should take steps to reduce the risk,
such as applying an oil-based sealant or replacing the structure.</TE>
<TE>   "The question now is what can millions of American families do with
the thousands of square miles of highly hazardous arsenic-soaked lumber
in their backyards," said Jane Houlihan, a vice president of the
Environmental Working Group, a Washington-based environmental research
organization. "Children increase their cancer risk every time they play
on this wood."</TE>
<TE>   Wood is pressure-treated with a pesticide to prevent infestation by
insects and other microorganisms that can cause decay and structural
problems.</TE>
<TE>Push to Reclassify It as Hazardous Waste</TE>
<TE>   California State Sen. Gloria Romero (D-Los Angeles) is pushing
legislation that would ban all arsenic-treated wood in California and
reclassify the lumber as a hazardous waste that must be disposed of in
special facilities.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a dangerous product," Romero said.</TE>
<TE>   The EPA announcement marked a reversal by the pressure-treated wood
industry, which had ardently defended the safety of its product in the
face of growing criticism from environmental and consumer groups. Most
major manufacturers of playground equipment already have shifted to
treating their equipment with alternative pesticides or have announced
plans to do so.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been an amazing turnaround over the last six months," said
Patrick Bischel, owner of Northern Crossarms, a Minnesota wood treatment
company that switched to a different compound four years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental groups praised the withdrawal of the product but
criticized the murky message that accompanied it.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a disconnect here," said Paul Bogart, spokesman for Healthy
Building Network, a coalition of architects, environmentalists and
scientists. "If you're a consumer, you don't know what to think. You know
it's being taken off the market but you don't know why."</TE>
<TE>   But EPA officials said the agency has not deciphered the conflicting
data about the product-- chromated copper arsenate, or CCA--so it is
premature to say whether it presents health risks.</TE>
<TE>   "The hazard associated with arsenic is well known," said Steve
Johnson, head of the EPA's pesticide office. "But the issue for
CCA-treated lumber is: Is there any exposure occurring? Are children
being exposed to the materials in CCA-treated lumber? At this point we
don't know."</TE>
<TE>Response to Shifting Market Demands</TE>
<TE>   The producers of chromated copper arsenate, the dominant preserver
used in outdoor wood for 50 years, said they are phasing out the product
in response to increased market demand for arsenic-free wood products.
They insisted that arsenic-treated wood poses no danger to consumers.</TE>
<TE>   But environmentalists called that position an obvious attempt to avoid
lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   The product is still the mainstay in most lumber stores. Lumber
treated with alternate substances usually must be special ordered.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest sellers of arsenic-treated lumber--Lowes and Home
Depot--said they will take their cues from the EPA.</TE>
<TE>   Company representatives said the stores will begin stocking an
alternative to arsenic-treated lumber as soon as it becomes available and
will stop stocking arsenic-treated wood before the deadline.</TE>
<TE>   About 350 plants across the country pressure-treat lumber. They will
have to alter their facilities, at a cost of $40,000 to $200,000, to
begin producing a non-arsenic alternative, said Parker Brugge, executive
director of the American Wood Preservers Institute, the trade group for
the industry.</TE>
<TE>   An emerging alternative is wood treated with ACQ (alkaline, recycled
copper and quat, a fungicide), which contains no carcinogens or other
dangerous substances.</TE>
<TE>   The EPA offered some guidance on the use of the pressure-treated wood:
Never burn it, and wear masks and gloves when sawing it or working with
it. Don't put food directly on it.</TE>
<TE>   Studies suggest that applying penetrating oil-based coatings to the
treated wood reduces exposure to arsenic, said the EPA's Johnson. But
painting the wood with a product that may flake or peel is not a good
idea because sanding it could dislodge more arsenic, he added.</TE>
<TE>   "As always, when children play outside, whether around CCA-treated
play structures or not, they should wash their hands prior to eating,"
EPA said in a release.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists also expressed concern about the disposal of
arsenic-treated wood, which now is exempted from hazardous waste rules
and can be thrown out anywhere. The arsenic can leach out into ground
water and complicate efforts to reduce arsenic in drinking water.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>United Airlines mechanics and cleaners rejected the tentative
contract recommended by a presidential panel last month, setting the
unprofitable UAL Corp. unit on course for a possible Feb. 20 strike.</LD>
<LD>   The workers cast 68% of votes against the proposed contract, according
to results released by the International Assn. of Machinists and
Aerospace Workers union. The contract would have raised top pay for
mechanics at the second-largest carrier by 37% this year. The two sides
have said they would resume talks if the contract were rejected.</LD>
<LD>   The workers also voted 86% in favor of giving their union leaders the
option to call for a strike if no agreement can be reached over the next
week. The union said 90% of eligible voters cast ballots.</LD>

<HD>Having a Cow at Olympics</HD>
<DH>Protests: For a variety of activists, getting worldwide press
coverage is the name of the Games.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY
</DL>
<LD>This is a good place for extroverts these days, particularly if you
don't mind dressing up like a cow or driving a truck displaying bloody
views of abortions.</LD>
<LD>   With 10,000 journalists in town, the Olympics have drawn a horde of
activists and ax-grinders, all eager for a headline or a few seconds on
worldwide TV.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, reporters from several countries surrounded three or four
sullen young anarchists, most of them masked, on a downtown street. After
denouncing the Olympics as a tool of corporate fat cats, their leader
faltered when it came to the name of his group: "We're the Party Bloc of
the Anti-Capitalist . . . well, it's on the press release."</LD>
<TE>   Nobody so far has blockaded traffic or torched a Starbucks, and local
residents have taken the visiting zealots in stride. Even anti-Mormon
protesters at Temple Square, the heart of the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints, report a polite, if cool, reception.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been cussed at," said Jim Dorrough, "but not too bad."</TE>
<TE>   An ex-Mormon electrician from Edgewater, Wash., Dorrough hands out
fliers accusing the Mormons of corrupting Christianity with beliefs that
contradict the Bible. "I came because I expected quite a large crowd of
non-Mormons who need to know the truth," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of red-jacketed Falun Gong adherents roam the sidewalks,
denouncing the cruel treatment of the spiritual group by the government
of China.</TE>
<TE>   At a rodeo put on to coincide with the Olympics, advocates for animals
scream: "Stop the animal holocaust!"</TE>
<TE>   Anti-abortion activists, homeless rights supporters, evangelical
Christians: All are pushing their causes in a town that doesn't see too
much street theater, and so far, it's gone down as smoothly as the green
Jell-O that Utah folks are said to consume by the acre-foot.</TE>
<TE>   "If this is the way it stays, then amen," said Sgt. Fred Louis, a
spokesman for the Salt Lake City police, which has 400 officers at the
ready to deal with unruly crowds. So far, police have arrested five
protesters--members of a group called Jedi Women who veered from a march
on homelessness toward police lines outside the Games' opening ceremony
Friday. They were released after several hours.</TE>
<TE>   While dozens of groups have signed up to demonstrate at seven official
sites, the Mormon Church has shied away from any missionary zeal when it
comes to pushing its message onto Olympic visitors.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to be good hosts," said Bruce L. Olsen, a spokesman for the
church. "If you have someone over to your house for dinner, you don't
hand them literature and try to convert them to your faith."</TE>
<TE>   Still, making converts is the name of the game for true believers of
all stripes who have been drawn here to state their case before the
world.</TE>
<TE>   The rodeo was a flashpoint from the get-go, drawing criticism for its
inclusion in a series of cultural events affiliated with the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the rodeo arena in outlying Farmington, Steve Hindi sat at the
console of his $160,000 truck, chatting on a cell phone with a Swedish
reporter. Video screens on the sides of his truck showed calves being
yanked and slammed down during roping competitions. Electronic signs
delivered Hindi's message in flashing red letters: "Cruelty is not in the
Olympic Spirit," with the "not" crossed out.</TE>
<TE>   The display moves even non-believers, said Hindi, who owns an
industrial fasteners factory in Illinois: "I've had ladies in fur coats
come up to me asking how they can help."</TE>
<TE>   About 50 protesters, including a man dressed as a Holstein cow, came
out for the final night of the rodeo, as they had for the previous two. A
SWAT team and a mounted patrol watched as they shouted at rodeo fans on
the way inside. Overhead, a Blackhawk helicopter circled.</TE>
<TE>   In Salt Lake City for a visit, primatologist Jane Goodall also took
her turn Monday denouncing the rodeo.</TE>
<TE>   Such high-level support wasn't in the cards for a dozen bundled-up,
middle-aged men and women demonstrating one frigid afternoon in downtown
Pioneer Park, one of the Games' official protest sites.</TE>
<TE>   For two hours, they held hands, chanted and did slow rapturous turns
to make a point about world peace--namely, that they're for it. They were
watched in the late-afternoon shadows only by a few bored Salt Lake City
police officers and a single reporter.</TE>
<TE>   Mindful of stressing the grass underfoot, the members of Dance for
Universal Peace moved from time to time to less danced-upon patches of
lawn.</TE>
<TE>   That the world's press didn't show up in force was OK, said Helen
Donovan, a local nurse: Everybody would get the message sooner or later.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an energy," she explained.</TE>

<LD>Lawyers for Terry L. Nichols asked an appeals court to reverse the
Oklahoma City bombing conspirator's conviction or allow him to be
resentenced.</LD>
<LD>   Nichols is serving life in prison on his 1997 conviction of conspiracy
and involuntary manslaughter for the deaths of eight federal agents in
the 1995 bombing, which killed 168 people.</LD>
<LD>   Defense attorney John Richilano argued that jurors should have
considered whether Nichols knew his actions could lead to massive deaths.</LD>

<LD>Twelve jurors and six alternates were selected in Cleveland in the
bribery trial of U.S. Rep. James A. Traficant Jr. After the jury was
seated, Traficant asked U.S. District Court Judge Lesley Wells to dismiss
the indictment against him because the jury pool was from the Cleveland
area and not Youngstown, the city he represents. The judge took no
action. Traficant, who is not a lawyer but is defending himself, said he
would renew his complaint before opening statements, which were expected
today.</LD>
<LD>   Traficant, 60, has been accused of accepting gifts and favors in
exchange for using his political influence, forcing his staff to make
cash kickbacks or do favors for him, tax falsification and racketeering.</LD>

<HD>Money, Politics Collide as House Again Debates Campaign Finance
Reform; GOP Leads Attack</HD>
<DH>Politics: Advocates of bill score a victory as a fight over rules
fizzles. The measure's foes hope to scuttle it with talks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The House on Tuesday opened a freewheeling debate on money in
politics, with Republican leaders beseeching about two dozen undecided
GOP lawmakers to help derail a proposal to limit large donations from
unions, corporations and wealthy individuals.</LD>
<LD>   The leaders, claiming that GOP control of the House could be at stake,
today will try to amend a bill that would ban the unlimited donations to
national political parties that are known as soft money. Their goal is to
force negotiations between the House and the Senate that could scuttle
the legislation.</LD>
<LD>   To that end, Republican National Committee Chairman Marc Racicot wrote
and telephoned lawmakers to remind them of the significant differences
between the bill and the reform principles spelled out last year by
President Bush.</LD>
<TE>   Still, as the long-awaited House debate opened, the bill's foes
acknowledged that they could not count on allies in the Senate or the
White House to stop it.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no longer any place to hide," said Rep. Thomas M. Reynolds
(R-N.Y.), an opponent of the bill. "It's going to be settled right here
in the House of Representatives."</TE>
<TE>   Late Tuesday, GOP leaders were honing a strategy that would attempt to
sink the bill by passing amendments with financing limits so strongly
worded that they have no chance of becoming law.</TE>
<TE>   Another would force parties to stop raising soft money immediately and
require them to return millions of dollars in soft money they have
already raised in anticipation of this year's congressional elections.</TE>
<TE>Reform Advocates Win on Ground Rules Vote</TE>
<TE>   In preliminary action earlier Tuesday, the House approved on a voice
vote ground rules for the campaign finance debate, which will culminate
in major votes today and perhaps Thursday. The procedural vote itself was
a significant victory for the pro-reform coalition of Democrats and
dissident Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   Just last summer, after the Senate's approval of a bill that includes
a soft money ban, House GOP leaders had sought to impose ground rules
that reform advocates said were stacked against them. A scheduled debate
fizzled amid accusations of subterfuge on both sides.</TE>
<TE>   But now, the sponsors of the legislation, Reps. Christopher Shays
(R-Conn.) and Martin T. Meehan (D-Mass.), say they have a clean shot at
passing a bill very similar to what the Senate approved.</TE>
<TE>   As the debate opened, they were confident of success. They cited
public outrage over the Enron Corp. collapse, noting that the
now-bankrupt and discredited energy company was the source of $1.7
million in soft money in the 1999-2000 election cycle.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the two parties collected nearly $500 million in soft money
during those two years. And such a large amount of cash, reform advocates
say, inevitably provides givers with unfair influence.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe that a majority of the House has reached its breaking point
with this soft money system," Meehan said. "They know that this is a
system that gives good people a bad name, and I believe they are ready to
change it."</TE>
<TE>   Opponents say the proposed reforms are unconstitutional, and that
there is no proof that contributors such as Enron gain an unfair
advantage. On a more basic political level, the GOP House leaders claim
that banning soft money would cripple the party's ability to respond to
the help that labor unions generally provide to Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Some unions, however, also oppose portions of the bill they believe
would hamper their political activities.</TE>
<TE>   Under the Shays-Meehan bill, the national parties would be barred from
collecting soft money and would instead be forced to redouble their
efforts to obtain smaller donations under a system regulated by federal
law since 1974. To help the parties, the bill would raise those
contribution limits, allowing an individual to contribute as much as
$95,000 every two years to candidates and party committees. The current
limit is $50,000.</TE>
<TE>   The bill would also impose new regulations on political advertising by
unions, corporations and other groups in a response to the proliferation
of so-called "issue advocacy" attacks during the weeks before primary and
general elections.</TE>
<TE>   In a significant tactical shift, the bill's sponsors said Tuesday that
the soft money ban would not take effect until after the 2002
congressional elections. Previously, the proposal was to take effect 30
days after enactment.</TE>
<TE>   Shays and Meehan said it was unrealistic to change the campaign law so
close to the November elections. Opponents of the bill mocked the shift,
asking why the sponsors would not want to ban soft money immediately if
it is so pernicious.</TE>
<TE>   The sponsors also said they planned to ask the House to vote on at
least three amendments. One would set contribution limits for House
candidates at $2,000 per individual per election, up from the current
$1,000. The bill already would increase that limit for Senate candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Another amendment would strip a provision from the Senate bill that
limits the price of advertising that television stations can charge
federal candidates in the days before an election. A third would propose
steps to ease contribution limits for candidates who face self-funded
wealthy opponents.</TE>
<TE>GOP Works to Keep Strategy a Secret</TE>
<TE>   House GOP leaders were keeping much of their strategy under wraps,
refusing to divulge several proposed amendments until today. Under the
ground rules, the GOP leaders are allowed to propose two alternatives to
the Shays-Meehan bill and up to 10 amendments.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates on both sides of the debate were putting pressure on
Republicans who have supported campaign reform in the past. Rep. Sherwood
L. Boehlert (R-N.Y.), a long-standing supporter of the soft money ban,
complained that he couldn't even go buy a Valentine's Day card for his
wife without being accosted by a pro-reform lobbyist.</TE>
<TE>   Reform advocates are nervous that despite his record of backing
campaign finance reform, now that he chairs the House Science Committee
he may be under more pressure to toe the leadership line. Boehlert
declined, for example, to sign the petition that forced House leaders to
bring the Shays-Meehan bill to a vote.</TE>
<TE>   Boehlert said Tuesday he would stick with Shays and Meehan on crucial
amendments.</TE>
<TE>   Other Republicans were less definite. Because many details of the
competing proposals were not immediately known, uncommitted lawmakers had
a convenient excuse for not taking sides publicly.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not sure what we'll be called upon to vote on," said an aide to
Rep. Michael Ferguson (R-N.J.), one of those who has yet to announce his
position on the bill.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey GOP Chairman Joe Kyrillos was among those lobbying Ferguson
to oppose the bill. Also lobbying against it were top GOP officials such
as Racicot and his deputy Jack Oliver.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.), another swing vote, said he supports the
Shays-Meehan bill but was noncommittal about the amendment that could
determine the measure's future.</TE>
<TE>   "Fred will consider every amendment on its merits," said his spokesman
Mike Waldron.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley), another key vote, said he was
distressed at the decision by the bill's sponsors to postpone the
effective date of their soft money ban. "If you need the bill, you need
it now," Gallegly said.</TE>
<TE>   While House GOP members typically look to Bush for leadership on tough
votes, White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said Tuesday the
president would continue to avoid direct involvement in the debate.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has said it is up to Congress to hash out the reform issue, and
he will sign a bill sent to him if he believes it would improve the
financing system.</TE>

<HD>Odyssey Leads to Chance at 'Real Reform' for Advocates</HD>
<DH>Politics: Years of failed bills and frustration culminate in a
narrowly focused effort to thwart big money influence. But the journey
isn't over.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Three political fund-raising scandals. Two maverick presidential
campaigns. One White House veto. And more than a decade of frustration,
reversals and dashed hopes.</LD>
<LD>   That's what it has taken for supporters of campaign finance reform to
reach a House vote expected today that may constitute their best chance
yet to force their vision into law.</LD>
<LD>   In their decade-plus of struggle, reformers have been compelled to
ruthlessly narrow their aims. Their bills once sought to comprehensively
reduce the influence of money in politics. Now the reformers have pared
back to a single goal: blocking the flow of unlimited big money
contributions into political campaigns.</LD>
<TE>   Even if they push their current bill into law, that may not reduce the
amount of money spent on politics, supporters acknowledge. But the
legislation would severely curtail the system of loosely unregulated
"soft money" financing that has become the fastest-growing source of
money in politics and threatened to swamp the fund-raising limits imposed
after the Watergate scandal.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, when supporters say this is going to get money out of
politics, that's hype," said Harvard University lecturer Michael Waldman,
who oversaw the campaign finance issue for President Clinton. "But this
is real reform. It will at least for a few elections shut down the most
egregious features of the current system. The most fundamental thing this
would do is restore the idea that there are some limits."</TE>
<TE>   And that alone could change the way campaigns look in the next few
years, though perhaps not only in ways that reform advocates predict. The
bill's critics believe that its provisions targeting independent
groups--such as restrictions on the airing of political ads funded by
unions or corporations--are much less likely to survive judicial
challenges than those affecting political parties. That could produce a
system where interest groups have more freedom to spend and shape the
campaign dialogue than candidates and parties.</TE>
<TE>   The impending House vote stands as the latest collision of the two
forces that have shaped the debate over campaign finance reform for more
than a decade. On one side has been the embedded reluctance of many
lawmakers to change fund-raising rules that they believe have helped them
win their seats. On the other has been a succession of money scandals and
reform movements that have generated public pressure for change.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the constants here has been the problem keeps getting worse
and the national support keeps getting bigger and we [reform advocates]
never go away," said Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, one of
the groups pressing for reform.</TE>
<TE>   The result has been a series of legislative showdowns in which
Congress has taken up the reform banner, fought to stalemate, set the
issue aside and then been forced to begin the process again after a new
spike of public outrage.</TE>
<TE>   Just since 1990, the House has passed reform bills five times and the
Senate four times (while filibusters thwarted Senate action in four other
years). Yet through all that, no bill has become law.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers enacted the last major change in the campaign finance laws
after Watergate in 1974, creating the modern system of contribution
limits and public financing for presidential general elections.</TE>
<TE>   As loopholes emerged in that system, the first proposals to further
tighten the flow of money into campaigns surfaced in the mid-1980s. But
it wasn't until the early 1990s that the effort took off.</TE>
<TE>   Scandal, as it would repeatedly, provided a key boost. Controversy
surrounding the efforts of five senators on behalf of failed savings and
loan tycoon Charles H. Keating encouraged Democrats (who then controlled
the House and Senate) to pass sweeping campaign finance legislation in
1990 and 1992. But internal disagreements killed the first bill and
then-President Bush, as the legislators expected, vetoed the second.</TE>
<TE>   The drive was revived after the 1992 election, when Ross Perot's
strong third-party showing demonstrated a substantial constituency for
reform. But congressional Democratic leaders, who had eagerly passed
reform legislation under a president they knew would veto the bill,
hesitated to do so under Clinton, who had pledged to sign it.</TE>
<TE>   Though bills passed both chambers, House Democratic leaders refused to
reconcile their differences with the Senate through late 1994,
effectively killing the legislation. Clinton had labeled reform one of
his top goals but failed to intervene as the Democrats interred it.</TE>
<TE>   The reform effort appeared to die when Republicans, generally
skeptical of the idea, seized control of Congress in 1995. But scandal
again revived it in 1997, when outrage over Clinton's 1996 reelection
fund-raising tactics spurred a new push led by Sens. Russell D. Feingold
(D-Wis.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.), who embraced the reform cause after
being tainted as one of the senators linked to Keating.</TE>
<TE>   This new effort came with a narrowed focus. The legislation that
repeatedly cleared Congress in the early 1990s sought to comprehensively
reduce the flow of money into politics. It included voluntary spending
limits for congressional campaigns (usually in return for some federal
funding), limits on fund-raising by political action committees and a ban
on unlimited soft money contributions to the parties.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1997, though, the reform bills have dropped the other provisions
to focus on the soft money ban and a parallel effort to block interest
groups from using unlimited contributions to fund independent advertising
campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the efforts still foundered. Although the House passed the
new reform bills in 1998 and 1999, the Senate could never overcome a GOP
filibuster. Indeed, some House members are suspected of supporting the
bills because they knew the legislation could not overcome Senate
filibusters.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, once again, when the legislation appeared dead, outside forces
have provided new momentum. McCain's strong performance in the 2000 GOP
presidential primaries--like Perot's showing in 1992--helped propel a
reform bill through the Senate last year. Now, Enron Corp.'s collapse has
brought the House effort to the brink of success. The Enron backdrop has
also discouraged President Bush from actively opposing the legislation,
though the ban on soft money is more sweeping than he prefers.</TE>
<TE>   Reform supporters are already dampening expectations that the
legislation would transform politics, should it become law. Soft money
accounts for only about one-sixth of the roughly $3 billion spent on
federal elections in 2000, according to the nonpartisan Center for
Responsive Politics.</TE>
<TE>   But the bill's supporters say unlimited soft money contributions, used
to fund party-sponsored "issue" advertising campaigns, have become the
system's most severe problem by undermining the Watergate-inspired
contribution limits. In the last three presidential races, the parties
have effectively run parallel campaigns, one funded with money raised
under the spending limits, the other with soft money. Now that approach
is migrating into congressional races.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say banned soft money would inevitably find other ways into
campaigns. Many predict a proliferation of independent spending
campaigns, particularly if the courts strike down as a violation of free
speech the legislation's efforts to constrain such groups.</TE>
<TE>   "They think they are going to be shutting off soft dollars by shutting
off the parties, but it is just going to seep to groups like us," said
Steve Moore, president of the Club for Growth, a conservative political
action committee.</TE>
<TE>   Wertheimer too has no illusions that this week could mark any kind of
final victory. Even if a bill reaches Bush and he signs it, Wertheimer
said, reformers will have to begin new efforts, such as replacing the
Federal Election Commission with a new enforcement body. "Every step in
this process is always hard," Wertheimer said. "So even if we win, I'm
not celebrating anything."</TE>

<HD>How Pairs Skating Is Scored</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pairs skating is broken into two parts: A short program that counts
for one-third of the team's total and a free skate that counts for the
rest.</LD>
<LD>   Nine judges score a competition based on technical merit and
presentation. A perfect score is 6.0.</LD>
<LD>   Short Program:</LD>
<TE>   The pairs short program consists of eight required elements that
include overhead lifts, side-by-side solo jumps and solo spins done in
unison, pair spins, footwork, and a death spiral performed to music of
the skaters' choice. In the short program, technical merit serves as the
tiebreaker.</TE>
<TE>   After the short program Saturday, the Russian pair of Elena Berezhnaya
and Anton Sikharulidze had a slight lead over Jamie Sale and David
Pelletier of Canada, with seven judges ranking the Russians first and two
ranking the Canadians on top.</TE>
<TE>   Free Skate:</TE>
<TE>   The free skating program consists of technical and artistic moves
choreographed to the skaters' individual strengths, skills and ability to
perform as a team.</TE>
<TE>   A well-balanced pair free skating program must contain:</TE>
<TE>   * Three or four different lifts (one of which must be a twist lift)
with full extension of the lift arm;</TE>
<TE>   * One or two throws;</TE>
<TE>   * One or two solo jumps;</TE>
<TE>   * One jump sequence;</TE>
<TE>   * One pair spin combination;</TE>
<TE>   * One solo spin;</TE>
<TE>   * One or two different death spirals;</TE>
<TE>   * At least one step sequence;</TE>
<TE>   * At least one sequence of movements that must include turns, spirals
and flowing moves while fully utilizing the ice surface.</TE>
<TE>   In the long program, presentation serves as the tiebreaker.</TE>
<TE>   In Monday's free skate, two of the judges gave the teams equal total
scores, but both judges said the Russians had higher presentation points,
giving them the edge.</TE>

<HD>White House Told to Save Energy Records</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A federal judge directed the White House on Tuesday to save records
from energy task force meetings and warned the Bush administration it
must take seriously a private group's lawsuit seeking the records.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush has refused to turn over records of meetings with Enron
executives and others who advised the administration on energy policy
last year.</LD>
<LD>   Congress' investigative arm, the General Accounting Office, is
expected to sue soon for the records' release. Tuesday's hearing involved
a similar lawsuit, filed in July by the private group Judicial Watch.</LD>
<TE>   "I get the feeling the government's underestimating the seriousness of
this case," U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan told Justice Department
lawyer Anne Weismann.</TE>
<TE>   He asked Weismann where the records were. The office of Vice President
Dick Cheney and eight agencies that Weismann said have information should
maintain them, Sullivan said.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department already had instructed the White House and the
Commerce, Energy and Treasury departments to keep all Enron records.</TE>
<TE>   The judge also asked if the White House would claim executive
privilege if he sought information about meetings as part of the lawsuit.
Weismann said administration officials may, but it would not be their
entire defense.</TE>
<TE>   Enron's collapse last fall has renewed interest in records of Bush's
energy policy task force, which was run by the vice president. Bush is a
longtime friend of former Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay.</TE>
<TE>   Judicial Watch Chairman Larry Klayman told Sullivan that months before
the company's failure, his organization was worried that executives of
Enron and others were secretly "exercising undue influence over the vice
president, the executive branch."</TE>
<TE>   His group, best known for multiple suits it filed against the Clinton
administration, wants details of the meetings. Judicial Watch sued under
a 1972 law intended to promote openness for presidential panels.</TE>

<HD>New York City Mayor Unveils Belt-Tightening Budget</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg will unveil a
$41.3-billion budget today with $1.8 billion of cuts as the media
tycoon-turned-politician guides the city through the deepest fiscal
crisis in decades.</LD>
<LD>   A special $1.5-billion bond sale will be a big part of the Republican
mayor's plan to close a $4.8-billion budget gap, according to financial
sources who declined to be identified. The new shortfall is $300 million
bigger than the one the mayor forecast only last week.</LD>
<LD>   The budget gap, which Bloomberg says requires him to cut spending on
the police and schools by 7%, also is so huge because the World Trade
Center attack shuttered thousands of businesses.</LD>
<TE>   Though Bloomberg repeatedly has ruled out raising taxes, his new plan
calls for a cigarette tax. The estimated size of the levy is anywhere
from eight cents to $1 a pack, one of the financial sources said,
explaining that the wide range reflected uncertainty about what the state
Legislature might allow.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no comment until the budget is officially released," a
Bloomberg spokeswoman said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The new mayor, who repeatedly has warned the city that his first
budget will contain painful cuts, also will call on the city's 250,000
workers to come up with productivity savings that would add up to about
$250 million.</TE>
<TE>   Another $250 million would be saved--if the Legislature agrees--by
stretching out to 10 years from five years the cost-of-living increases
Albany gave retired city workers.</TE>
<TE>   And $100 million would be saved through early retirement, though job
prospects for people who might wish to start new careers look bleak. City
Comptroller William Thompson on Tuesday said 112,000 jobs were lost in
the last half of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The city's capital program, which pays for keeping bridges and roads
safe, for example, would be slashed by $2 billion for each of the next
two years.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg included two major costs Giuliani never put in the budget.</TE>
<TE>   The first is the extra $50 million the city will spend because the
council agreed it will pay some Medicare costs for retired workers. The
second is judgments and claims--the vast sums the city pays when it loses
civil suits filed against it by injured citizens.</TE>
<TE>   Though New York City already has around $50 billion of debt
outstanding, Bloomberg wants to sell $1.5 billion of special bonds
related to recovery from the World Trade Center disaster.</TE>

<HD>Bush Sets Goals for Major Cuts in Drug Use</HD>
<DH>Politics: He discloses strategy that focuses on disrupting the
market for narcotics, help for addicts and prevention.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush set a goal Tuesday of cutting the use of illegal
drugs in the United States by 10% over two years and 25% over five years
as he unveiled a national drug control strategy.</LD>
<LD>   The program, which the president said is "in the center of our
national agenda," is built on three elements: disrupting the market for
illegal drugs, helping drug users, and preventing drug use among those
who have not gotten involved with it.</LD>
<LD>   Bush's plan calls for increased funding for drug abuse treatment,
heightened efforts to educate young people about the dangers of using
illegal drugs, and greater involvement by parents in making drugs
socially unacceptable.</LD>
<TE>   In seeking to balance efforts to reduce demand for drugs with the
campaign to reduce supplies that took root when Bush's father was
president, the proposal marks a sharp turn in government anti-drug
policy.</TE>
<TE>   "We're determined to limit drug supply, to reduce demand and to
provide addicts with effective and compassionate drug treatment," the
president said. "Each of these steps is essential, and they're
inseparable."</TE>
<TE>   Bush also linked the campaign against drugs to the anti-terrorist
campaign, which has become the focus of his foreign policy.</TE>
<TE>   Citing the support he said terrorist networks get from selling drugs,
whether in South America or Afghanistan, Bush said: "When people purchase
drugs, they put money in the hands of those who want to hurt America,
hurt our allies."</TE>
<TE>   He said 70% of the world's opium has come from Afghanistan, "resulting
in significant income to the Taliban."</TE>
<TE>   Actually, the Taliban's record was mixed: Until recently, Afghanistan
was the world's largest producer of opium. But in July 2000, Mullah
Mohammed Omar, the Taliban leader, condemned opium cultivation. In one
edict, he brought the output of 3,200 tons a year to a virtual
standstill.</TE>
<TE>   Now, there are new fears among international anti-narcotics officials
that farmers will feel free to resume planting the valuable crop,
ignoring the new government's anti-poppy decrees.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's focus on drug abuse, and the priority he is giving the effort,
reflect a renewed interest in the administration on domestic policy as
Bush and his advisors widen their sweep beyond the immediate demands of
the war against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   His new policy comes in the wake of a sudden increase in the seizure
of illegal drugs along the nation's southwest border due to tighter
security after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   In the budget sent last week to Congress, the administration proposed
spending $3.8 billion for drug treatment, increasing that funding more
than 6% over the current fiscal year. It is also seeking to spend $2.3
billion on drug interdiction efforts along the borders, a 10% increase.</TE>
<TE>   The administration's plan appears to draw on both the role of law
enforcement that the previous Bush White House emphasized and the "Just
Say No" campaign in which Nancy Reagan, the former first lady, sought to
discourage young people from using illegal drugs.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, by focusing on the demand for drugs, the
administration appears to be responding to complaints from drug-producing
countries in Latin America that drug money filtering south from the
United States is fueling corruption and other criminal behavior
there--and that they would send fewer narcotics northward if fewer people
in this country wanted drugs.</TE>
<TE>   "The best way to affect supply is to reduce demand for drugs," Bush
said in a speech in the White House East Room to anti-drug experts from
government agencies and Washington research groups. "We can work as hard
as we possibly want on interdiction, but so long as there is the demand
for drugs in this country, some crook is going to figure out how to get
them here."</TE>
<TE>   And convincing young people not to use drugs, he said, "starts with
good parenting."</TE>
<TE>   For Bush, the matter reaches beyond one of policy to one of personal
concern. His niece Noelle, 24, the daughter of Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, has
been accused of prescription drug fraud. Her lawyer said Friday that she
has been admitted to a drug treatment program.</TE>
<TE>   The president made no reference to Noelle Bush during his
announcement.</TE>
<TE>   Adele Harrell, a drug policy expert at the Urban Institute, a
nonpartisan policy research organization, said after Bush's speech that
he was "the first president to approach the problem" with an appreciation
of the importance of reducing the demand for drugs.</TE>
<TE>   But Harrell said the nation has never been able to reduce drug use to
the degree that is called for in the Bush plan. "I found the number
startling," she said.</TE>
<TE>   As for the emphasis Bush put on parenting, she said drug abuse by
teens and young adults "confronts many parents who've been good parents,
and have done everything you'd ask of them."</TE>
<TE>   In California, experts praised Bush's goals and spending increases.
But if he is to meet his goals, they said, he may need to divert more
money from drug seizures to treating addicts.</TE>
<TE>   "They are pretty lofty goals but give him an 'A' for effort," said Jim
Stillwell, executive director of Impact, a private, nonprofit foundation
running one of the largest drug treatment programs in Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   As someone who has been involved with treatment programs for more than
30 years, Stillwell said, he could not recall a president establishing
such precise percentage goals for reducing drug use in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   But while Bush's goals are certainly attainable, they will "certainly
not be cheap," he said. "Right now, there are waiting lists all over the
country for residential treatment programs."</TE>
<TE>   And while Bush also proposes a big increase in spending for drug
interdiction, Stillwell said, that will have no impact on one of the
nation's most nettlesome narcotics--methamphetamines--which are produced
for the most part in California.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Brady, public policy consultant for the California Senate, also
said that Bush's initiatives are laudable but will need far more money
than is now proposed by the administration.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankly, if he is talking about 6% more for treatment programs and
10% more for drug interdiction, I think he should spend the whole 16% on
treatment," Brady said.</TE>
<TE>   Brady added that while outpatient treatment programs cost from $3,000
a year to double that amount, the price is far less than the minimum
$25,000 a year it costs to incarcerate drug addicts convicted of crimes
that support their addictions.</TE>

<HD>Unlikely Coalition Declares Health-Care Crisis</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICKI KEMPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Business and labor leaders, the insurance industry, health-care
providers and consumer advocates--at odds on almost every issue--sat on
the same side of a table Tuesday to declare that the country is in a
health-care crisis and proclaim their commitment to health coverage for
all Americans.</LD>
<LD>   Their strange-bedfellows coalition highlighted the growing consensus
in Washington that in a time of recession and spiraling health-care
costs, something must be done to help Americans--more than 39 million and
growing as of 2000--who have no health insurance.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, the coalition released data showing that an additional 2.2
million Americans lost health coverage last year because of layoffs. That
represents the largest one-year increase in the number of uninsured
Americans since 1992, said Ron Pollack, executive director of the
consumer advocacy group Families USA.</LD>
<TE>   Research shows that 80% of the uninsured are in working families whose
employers do not provide health coverage. They earn too much to qualify
for Medicaid or other public health-care programs but too little to
afford to pay health insurance premiums.</TE>
<TE>   The partnership--Covering the Uninsured--announced its launch of a Web
site and a $10-million advertising campaign funded by the Robert Wood
Johnson Foundation. The print ads and television commercials focus on
various health-care problems and outcomes, noting that "when you're
uninsured, life turns out differently."</TE>
<TE>   The campaign's Web site address is http://www.coveringtheuninsured.org</TE>
<TE>   Drawing further attention to the issue, a national association of 100
academic health-care centers Tuesday launched a $250,000 educational
campaign--more than one-tenth of its annual budget--to generate action on
what it called the "national disgrace" of the uninsured.</TE>
<TE>   Teaching hospitals have only 6% of the nation's hospital beds but
provide 50% of all uncompensated medical care, said Dr. David J. Ramsay,
president of the University of Maryland-Baltimore County.</TE>
<TE>   Coming in an election year, the two high-profile campaigns by
influential mainstream groups could further pressure Congress and
President Bush to act on health-care issues. Bush has proposed a range of
initiatives, including $89 billion in tax credits over 10 years to help
the uninsured buy their own health-care coverage.</TE>
<TE>   More than 6.3 million Californians, almost one in five state
residents, have no health insurance. California ranks fifth among the
states in the proportion of its population that is uninsured, according
to Census Bureau and other data compiled by the Assn. of Academic Health
Care Centers.</TE>
<TE>   New Mexico ranks first, with almost one-quarter of its population
uninsured. Texas, with 22% of its population uninsured, ranks second. Dr.
Arthur Kellermann, professor and chairman of emergency medicine at the
Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta, illustrated what he
called the "tragedy and sheer absurdity of the current situation." He
recalled an uninsured mother in her early 40s who could not afford her
blood pressure medication and later died of a massive stroke.</TE>
<TE>   "The money that we spent in a few short minutes in a futile effort to
save her life would have paid for her medication for years and years," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "The hard truth," Dr. Yank D. Coble, president-elect of the American
Medical Assn., told the foundation coalition, "is that Americans without
health-care coverage live sicker and die younger."</TE>
<TE>   "It's bad fiscal policy. It's bad public policy. And it's bad
medicine," Coble said. Leaders of the coalition's 12 often adversarial
partners--including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Health Insurance
Assn. of America, the American Hospital Assn. and AARP--acknowledged that
they disagree on what the government should do to help the uninsured gain
access to health care. And none of them expects a quick or easy political
solution.</TE>
<TE>   Other organizations participating in the Covering the Uninsured
campaign are the AFL-CIO, American Nurses Assn., the Business Roundtable,
the Catholic Health Assn. of the United States, the Federation of
American Hospitals, and the Service Employees International Union.</TE>

<LD>   None of the proposed options would allow unhindered use of
snowmobiles. One option would permit their continued use with noise and
pollution limits, a National Park Service official said, while another
would keep the ban in place as approved but delay its implementation by a
year.</LD>
<LD>   The ban was imposed during the Clinton administration, but the Bush
administration agreed to review it as part of the settlement of a lawsuit
filed by the snowmobiling industry, outdoor enthusiasts and the state of
Wyoming. All of those groups argued that the initial study did not take
into consideration a new generation of cleaner, quieter snowmobiles that
are friendlier to the environment.</LD>
<TE>   In addition to Yellowstone, the nation's oldest national park, the ban
affects Grand Teton National Park. At a news conference Tuesday on
Capitol Hill, proponents of the ban said the latest study was a waste of
time and taxpayer money, and they urged the park service to maintain its
current schedule of phasing out snowmobile use beginning next winter.</TE>
<TE>   "The new review finds that continued snowmobile use will harm
wildlife, just as the original report did," said William Meadows,
president of the Wilderness Society. "It finds that continued use will
harm air quality--just as the original report did."</TE>
<TE>   Meadows was joined by Reps. Susan A. Davis (D-San Diego) and Rush D.
Holt (D-N.J.), Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and Steven Bosak, an official
with the National Parks Conservation Assn. They said the alternative
options were not supported by the study's findings.</TE>
<TE>   Davis said even the most advanced snowmobiles harm the environment and
detract from other visitors' enjoyment of Yellowstone and Grand Teton,
places with unique ecology and geology that need to be protected.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not saying people shouldn't snowmobile," Davis said. "But there
are other places to do that."</TE>
<TE>   But Ed Klim, president of the International Snowmobile Manufacturers
Assn., said proponents were working from a draft several months old that
did not represent the final report and did not include data that the
industry and other agencies had presented.</TE>
<TE>   Klim said snowmobiles use the same park roads in the winter as cars do
during the summer, and that the industry would support options under
consideration that would include increased limits, such as the number of
snowmobiles allowed.</TE>
<TE>   "We have never been for unfettered snowmobiling in Yellowstone," he
said. "There is a bit of misunderstanding of our position."</TE>
<TE>   Under the Clinton administration plan, snowmobiling would be phased
out and access to the parks would be provided by snow coaches,
essentially buses on skis managed by the park service, said parks
spokeswoman Marsha Karle. A phaseout of snowmobiles would begin in winter
2002-03, with a full ban by the following winter.</TE>
<TE>   The first option under the new study to be presented by park officials
calls for no change to this plan. A second option would keep the same
rules as the original plan but would delay its implementation until
2003-04, with a full ban in effect by winter 2004-05.</TE>
<TE>   The third option would allow unguided snowmobiling in the parks as
long as the snowmobiles met stricter emission standards and decibel
levels than currently allowed. Under this option, the park service would
increase law enforcement and educational programs to limit the effect of
snowmobiles on the park's environment.</TE>
<TE>   Under a fourth option, only guided snowmobile tours would be allowed
and only if the tours use the most clean and quiet snowmobile models
available. A limit would be placed on the number of snowmobiles in the
parks.</TE>
<TE>   The report, prepared by officials at the parks, is scheduled to be
available for public comment by March 29.</TE>

<HD>Study Eases Viagra Concerns</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO
</DL>
<LD>A study has found that Viagra does not reduce blood flow to the
heart in some men with heart disease, a conclusion that should ease some
safety concerns about the popular sexual potency pill, Mayo Clinic
researchers reported Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The study involved men with stable heart disease who were not taking
nitrates, drugs used to treat angina. Because some earlier studies showed
nitrates can cause serious decreases in heart blood flow and blood
pressure when combined with Viagra, men in the study were not allowed to
use nitrates during its course.</LD>
<LD>   The 105 men with an average age of 66 in the study were given either
Viagra or a sugar pill and underwent an exercise stress test an hour
later.</LD>
<TE>   The drug "had no adverse effect on symptoms or how long the men were
able to exercise," said Patricia Pellikka, lead investigator for the
study.</TE>
<TE>   "We expected and saw that echocardiograms of these heart disease
patients would show evidence of inadequate blood supply to the heart
muscle during exercise. The key finding, however, is that the problem was
not made worse" by Viagra use.</TE>
<TE>   While a test involving 105 patients is not large enough "to absolutely
predict cardiac events," she added, "as a cardiologist these findings
increase my confidence in prescribing [Viagra]. . . . For men with
coronary artery disease who are not taking nitrates, the study should
provide reassurance that sildenafil [as Viagra is called generically] is
not likely to increase their heart attack risks."</TE>
<TE>   About 30 million men in the United States alone have impotence
problems, conditions which often coexist with heart disease, the study
said. Since Viagra was approved for use there have been reports of
adverse effects, including heart attack, abnormally rapid heart rhythm,
low blood pressure and death, raising concerns about the safety of the
drug for heart disease patients.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHARLOTTE, N.C.
</DL>
<LD>NAACP leaders said Tuesday that despite a lawsuit threat they will
move ahead with plans to hold protests along South Carolina highways to
discourage tourists from spending money in the state.</LD>
<LD>   The protests, planned for rest stops and welcome centers, are part of
the civil rights group's ongoing economic boycott over the state's
display of the Confederate flag on the Statehouse grounds.</LD>
<LD>   South Carolina NAACP Executive Director Dwight James said he is not
fazed by state Atty. Gen. Charlie Condon's promise to sue the group.</LD>
<TE>   "We've been through other threats of intimidation. We're going to
press on until we reach the prize," James said.</TE>
<TE>   Condon has said the protests are illegal because their aim is to harm
someone else's business. He also argued that a welcome center is a
nonpublic forum reserved for greeting visitors and it would be unlawful
to use it to discourage tourism.</TE>
<TE>   Legal advisors to the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored
People have told James that the "border patrols" will be within their
constitutional rights to protest.</TE>
<TE>   Condon, who is running for governor, said Tuesday he was optimistic
leaders of the state NAACP will abandon the plans.</TE>
<TE>   The NAACP has boycotted the state since early 2000, unsatisfied with
the Legislature's compromise to remove the flag from the Statehouse dome
and place it at the Confederate soldier monument on another part of the
grounds.</TE>
<TE>   James said the NAACP won't stop until the flag is removed from the
Statehouse grounds.</TE>
<TE>   James declined to give a starting date for the protests, although the
group said previously they would be held in late February at spots along
major highways.</TE>

<HD>Bush Shows 'Disdain' for U.S. Allies, Gore Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>Al Gore, reentering America's foreign policy debate, accused the
Bush administration Tuesday of showing "impatience and disdain" toward
U.S. allies in the war in Afghanistan and said military force alone would
not win the long struggle against terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, Gore
embraced President Bush's controversial description of Iraq, Iran and
North Korea as an "axis of evil." But he said that other dangerous forces
have to be addressed, such as poverty, ignorance, environmental problems,
disease, corruption and political oppression.</LD>
<LD>   For Gore, the appearance at the council marked another step back into
the national spotlight. Members of the New York-based think tank include
some of the nation's most influential foreign policy experts, and the
media were invited to listen in.</LD>
<TE>   Ten days ago, Gore gave a "return to the national debate" speech at a
Tennessee Democratic Party fund-raiser. In recent months he's also
appeared at Democratic fund-raisers in key political states, such as
Florida, New Hampshire and Iowa. After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, he
spoke out to proclaim his support of Bush in the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   In his first policy address since the 2000 election, Gore renewed his
support for the Bush administration's "highly successful opening
counterattack" to the attacks. But he said it is crucial that the
administration show "a more evident respect" for the coalition of allies
it has built or that alliance could quickly crumble. Gore said the
administration sometimes sends the message: "With others, if we must; by
ourselves, if possible."</TE>
<TE>   Gore said U.S. policy should also be aimed long range at "draining the
aquifer of anger that underlies terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   "The evil we now confront is not just the one-time creation of a
charismatic leader and his co-conspirators, or even a handful of
regimes," Gore said. "What we deal with now is today's manifestation of
an anger welling up from deep layers of grievance shared by many millions
of people."</TE>
<TE>   Foreign policy is one area in which Gore, during his unsuccessful 2000
presidential campaign, believed he had an advantage over then-Gov. Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Gore, a two-term vice president and 16-year veteran of Congress, had
an influential hand in President Clinton's foreign policy. He traveled
frequently overseas to represent the United States on missions to the
Middle East and China, for example, and at world economic and
environmental forums.</TE>
<TE>   He headed several country-to-country commissions designed to shape
U.S. relations with such nations as Russia, Ukraine, Egypt and South
Africa.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A landmark similar to Hollywood's Walk of Fame is planned for the
nation's capital to honor Americans who gave of themselves to help
others.</LD>
<LD>   The Extra Mile pathway will consist of at least 70 bronze medallions,
each 3 1/2 feet in diameter, embedded in sidewalks along a 10-block area
near the White House. Each medallion will bear the name, likeness and
background of the honoree.</LD>
<LD>   The project is a centerpiece of the Points of Light Foundation, a
nonprofit group spawned in 1990 by former President Bush's vision of
creating a legion of volunteers "spread like stars, like a thousand
points of light."</LD>
<TE>   Plans call for a dedication in 2003, although the project still has to
raise $2 million of the estimated $3 million needed. The project has
received about $192,000 in federal funds.</TE>
<TE>   The pathway's first hand-sculpted medallion, honoring the Rev. Edgar
J. Helms, a Methodist minister who started Goodwill Industries
International, was scheduled for unveiling today. Others in the first
group include the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and suffragette Susan B.
Anthony.</TE>

<HD>Lab Workers Show Signs of Lung Disease</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO
</DL>
<LD>Tests show seven current or former workers at Argonne National
Laboratory have blood abnormalities caused by exposure to the toxic metal
beryllium, the first such cases discovered at the lab.</LD>
<LD>   Two other employees who worked in nuclear weapons development at the
lab show signs of potentially fatal chronic beryllium disease, but their
initial blood tests were negative, officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The nine employees have been referred to medical specialists to
determine whether they have the incurable lung illness that has killed
several workers in the nuclear industry.</LD>
<TE>   "Years ago the department did not know that exposure to beryllium
would cause disease," said Brian Quirke, spokesman for the U.S.
Department of Energy, which owns Argonne. "We are sorry that these
employees' work caused them harm."</TE>
<TE>   The tests show sensitization to beryllium, indicating antibodies are
fighting the metal's presence in the lungs, Quirke said. They do not
verify the disease's progression. Fewer than 5% of people exposed to
beryllium show any ill effects.</TE>
<TE>   The facility in suburban Chicago does research in high-energy physics,
chemistry and materials science. The metal--toxic when breathed as dust
or vapor--was used to deflect neutrons in test reactors and as an alloy
for crucibles because of its high melting temperature.</TE>
<TE>   The medical cases were discovered during recent testing by the Energy
Department, which was conducting a congressionally mandated nationwide
screening program of potential beryllium victims.</TE>
<TE>   Nationally, Energy Department screenings of nuclear workers have found
546 out of 27,835 whose blood shows a reaction to beryllium in the lungs.
Of those, 183 have developed beryllium disease.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>A prancing, black package of pompoms put a little Spice into the
Westminster dog show Tuesday night.</LD>
<LD>   In an upset, a miniature poodle named Surrey Spice Girl walked off as
America's top dog when she was picked as best in show at Madison Square
Garden.</LD>
<LD>   "She oozes breed type," said judge W. Everett Dean Jr. "Every step was
right. She was smooth, gorgeous."</LD>
<TE>   The perfectly manicured 3-year-old became the first miniature poodle
to win America's most prestigious dog show since 1959.</TE>
<TE>   The victory completed a kind of Triple Crown for breeder Anne Clarke.
She previously won best in show as a handler at Westminster and also
judged the award.</TE>
<TE>   A Kerry blue terrier named Torum's Scarf Michael had been the early
favorite among dog fanciers and the crowd of 10,000. He was bidding to
become only the second dog ever to win Westminster and Crufts, England's
banner show.</TE>
<TE>   But instead of becoming a world beater, the 5 1/2-year-old terrier
called Mick appeared a bit distracted and left room for Spice.</TE>
<TE>   There were more than 2,500 entries at the show, representing 159
breeds and varieties.</TE>
<TE>   The two-day event attracted celebrities such as Candice Bergen and
Glenn Close. It also drew an Irish setter co-owned by New York Yankees
pitcher Mike Mussina.</TE>
<TE>   Group winners earlier Tuesday evening were a Brittany called Jester
(sporting), a Rhodesian ridgeback named Wetu of Kalahari (hound) and a
Pembroke Welsh corgi called Sammy Sosa (herding).</TE>
<TE>   A standard schnauzer named Charisma Jailhouse Rock won the working
group and an affenpinscher called Cosmo won the toy group Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   Spice came from the non-sporting group and Mick won among terriers.</TE>
<TE>   Kaz Hosaka expertly led Spice around the center ring, and could hardly
speak after the victory.</TE>
<TE>   "I came to this country 23 years ago hoping to win this show," he
said.</TE>

<DL>LITTLE ROCK, Ark.
</DL>
<LD>The governor's wife was paid about $6,000 by two housing trade
groups to speak about the first family's decision to move into a
triple-wide trailer while their mansion was being renovated.</LD>
<LD>   The Arlington, Va.-based Manufactured Housing Institute and Illinois
Manufactured Housing Assn. said they each gave Janet Huckabee an
honorarium of about $3,000 to address their members last year.</LD>
<LD>   Both groups deny the money was payback for the free publicity she
generated for their industry. Janet Huckabee did not return telephone
calls Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   Gov. Mike Huckabee and his family moved into the 2,100-square-foot
triple-wide in August 2000 for 16 months and were featured on television
and in the Economist and the New York Times.</TE>
<TE>   "I said we were going to get national publicity. I encouraged it,"
Janet Huckabee told Modern Homes, the institute's trade magazine in
November.</TE>
<TE>   Huckabee disclosed the payments to his wife on his 2001 statement of
financial interest.</TE>
<TE>   Graham Sloan, executive director of the Arkansas Ethics Commission,
said no state law prohibited the governor's wife from accepting speaking
fees.</TE>

<HD>Hostages Taken, Released at College</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>FAIRFIELD, Conn.
</DL>
<LD>A former student claiming to have a bomb held nearly two dozen
students and an associate professor hostage Tuesday before releasing them
unharmed, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   At one point, there were 23 people inside the Fairfield University
classroom. The suspect, identified only as a recent graduate, freed the
hostages a few at a time throughout the evening. He was taken into
custody about an hour after the last student was released.</LD>
<LD>   Nancy Habetz, a spokeswoman for the Roman Catholic school in
southwestern Connecticut, said the suspect "came out and gave himself up
peacefully."</LD>
<TE>   Fairfield First Selectman Kenneth Flatto said the package the student
claimed was an explosive device was left in the classroom and was being
examined by a bomb squad.</TE>
<TE>   The suspect took over a religious studies class in Canisius Hall late
Tuesday afternoon, Habetz said. Some 300 students were evacuated from the
building.</TE>
<TE>   WCBS-TV in New York said the suspect ordered one of the hostages to
call the station, demanding that a statement be read over the air. The
statement, which station spokeswoman Karen Mateo described as "rambling
and anti-Semitic," was not broadcast.</TE>
<TE>   The class, "Voices of Medieval Women," is taught by Elizabeth A.
Dreyer, an associate professor. Her husband, John Bennett, spoke to his
wife after her release.</TE>
<TE>   "She's OK, she says the man is clearly disturbed, and she said she
wants to see me," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Evening classes were canceled and students held a prayer service in
one of the residence halls, student Joni Saunders said.</TE>
<TE>   Canisius Hall is home to the academic vice president, the College of
Arts and Sciences, the university registrar and other offices as well as
faculty offices and classrooms.</TE>
<TE>   The school, founded in 1942, has about 5,000 undergraduate and
graduate students.</TE>
<TE>   Fairfield is about 20 miles from the New York state line.</TE>

Compton City Council in June 2001. Andrews, who was defeated in that
election, did not run as an incumbent. A judge, citing fraud by Andrews'
opponent, last week declared that Andrews has won the election.</LD>

<LD>Ventura County's sheriff's academy--the principal training facility

state and federal investigations of suspected racial profiling in
local police departments.</LD>

report found. "There must be specific guidelines in writing, and
active, ongoing training for all law enforcement personnel as to what
constitutes probable cause to detain a citizen."</LD>
<TE>   The Ventura County Criminal Justice Training Center in Camarillo
now offers cadets 24 hours of "cultural diversity and discrimination"
lessons as part of a 24-week school, which involves 957 hours of

<HD>Highway Safety Check Ordered</HD>
<DH>Transportation: A panel is created to look into reducing
accidents on Santa Rosa Road. Several options are presented.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Concerned that traffic has increased to dangerously high levels,
Ventura County supervisors Tuesday created a panel to look into ways
to improve safety along semirural Santa Rosa Road near Camarillo.</LD>
<LD>   The action comes two months after 14-year-old Camarillo honor
student Jennifer Lynn Bonds was struck and killed as she jogged along
the two-lane stretch with her father.</LD>
<LD>   Residents of Santa Rosa Valley said creation of the group, made up
of local homeowners and government representatives, is a good first
step in correcting problems along the six-mile corridor that connects
Moorpark and Thousand Oaks with Camarillo.</LD>
<TE>   "We've got a major thoroughfare going right through a residential
area," said Ruth Means, president of the Santa Rosa Valley Community
Homeowners Assn. "Safety is our main concern."</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, a county transportation manager outlined ways traffic
can be slowed to the posted 55 mph limit or lower.</TE>
<TE>   The county could install a "roundabout" that would slow motorists
as they circulate around a central island, said Butch Britt, a
transportation deputy director.</TE>
<TE>   Narrower lanes, landscaped medians, radar speed trailers and
cautionary signs are other options with varying costs, Britt said.</TE>
<TE>   Britt said county studies show traffic trips have increased from
5,000 per day in the 1970s to 25,000 per day last year. Nevertheless,
he said, accidents have remained relatively low and motorists drive
at an average 58 mph, just three miles over the posted limit.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have an overly unsafe road on Santa Rosa Road," Britt
told supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Frank Schillo disputed Britt's figures, saying he had
done his own study and found a higher number of accidents than the
county reported. Schillo, whose district includes a portion of Santa
Rosa Valley, said he also is concerned about local residents' ability
to turn onto the highway from side streets.</TE>
<TE>   "They are putting their lives in danger trying to get out on that
road," Schillo said.</TE>
<TE>   Britt did not make specific recommendations on which techniques
would be most effective. But he indicated one strategy that has
worked well in Camarillo could also be applied to Santa Rosa Road.</TE>
<TE>   Camarillo was able to get motorists to drive about 45 mph on Las
Posas Road by narrowing lane widths and installing landscaped
medians, he said. Widening the corridor to four lanes would also
improve safety, Britt said.</TE>
<TE>   Those combined improvements would cost about $18.7 million, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Rosa residents, however, have indicated they will not
support any move to widen the two-lane road. Residents fear doing so
would spoil the area's semirural environment, one marked by rolling
hills dotted with horse ranches and estates.</TE>
<TE>   The panel is expected to recommend proposed improvements, along
with a method of paying for them, to the Board of Supervisors within
six months.</TE>

<HD>Program on Racial Profiling Urged</HD>
<DH>Ventura County: In response to complaints, grand jury
recommends sheriff's academy create a special curriculum to educate
cadets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County's sheriff's academy--the principal training facility
for area police--must develop a detailed curriculum to teach cadets
how to avoid incidents of racial profiling, according to a grand jury
report released Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The citizen panel's recommendation is the result of an inquiry
that began more than a year ago following complaints from community
groups demanding state and federal investigations of suspected racial
profiling in local police departments.</LD>
<LD>   "A mere understanding of cultural diversities is not enough," the
report found. "There must be specific guidelines in writing, and
active, ongoing training for all law enforcement personnel as to what
constitutes probable cause to detain a citizen."</LD>
<TE>   For example, the report said, training material "does not answer
the question of whether it is racial profiling to stop a black male
in a predominantly white neighborhood, if the only thing that makes
the officer suspicious is that the man looks out of 'place.' Instead,
the material focuses on cultural differences and how to effectively
deal with them."</TE>
<TE>   Currently, the Ventura County Criminal Justice Training Center in
Camarillo offers cadets 24 hours of so-called "cultural diversity and
discrimination" lessons as part of a 24-week school, which includes a
total of 957 hours of instruction.</TE>
<TE>   While the academy's 60 instructors are strongly encouraged to
supplement their state-designed course materials with newspaper and
magazine articles and other information about racial profiling, it is
not required.</TE>
<TE>   That will soon change, officials said. As of Jan. 1, state law
mandates that all peace officers receive several hours of training on
preventing "bias-based" policing.</TE>
<TE>   The new curriculum--being crafted by a state committee that is
working with material from a police oversight office--won't be ready
until April, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Capt. Kenton Rainey, director of the sheriff's academy, said he
believes cadets receive ample training on race issues both in the
classroom and while paired with veteran officers during on-the-job
training.</TE>
<TE>   "I personally believe racial profiling is a problem that occurs
throughout the country," Rainey said. "We deal with the issue at the
academy, but sometimes you can provide as much training as possible
and somewhere, someone is going to violate" the law.</TE>
<TE>   Rainey, the department's highest-ranking black officer, said the
academy far exceeds minimum state standards for training cadets in
all areas of law enforcement and that racial issues are discussed in
a number of classes, including those  on ethics and law.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County Deputy Public Defender Michael Neary conducted a
study last year finding that 96% of his clients who were pulled over
for minor infractions and then charged with more serious offenses
were black or Latino.</TE>
<TE>   Neary said the grand jury was "absolutely accurate" with its
recommendation for a more specific curriculum on racial profiling.
But he said the report didn't go far enough in examining racial
inconsistencies in police work.</TE>
<TE>   "The only time we stop people for looking out of place is when
they are black or brown and they are in a predominantly white
neighborhood," Neary said, adding that he has never heard of a white
person being stopped solely for driving through a minority
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   The public defender said he hoped the report would encourage more
people to come forward with their stories of racial profiling and
other mistreatment.</TE>
<TE>   While the county's top law enforcement officials have repeatedly
contended that racial profiling is not a problem locally, county,
state and federal officials continue to investigate the issue
following several citizen complaints.</TE>
<TE>   One incident being investigated involves Robert Lee Jones, a
23-year-old black man whom Oxnard police officers shot to death last
August. Jones' family has said he was killed unnecessarily and was
depressed at the time about being the victim of earlier racial
profiling by officers.</TE>
<TE>   John Hatcher, president of the local chapter of the National Assn.
for the Advancement of Colored People, alerted state investigators
about racial profiling in Ventura County. He said he agrees with the
grand jury's recommendation about additional training but believes it
stops short of solving the problem.</TE>
<TE>   Hatcher said police agencies should have citizen oversight
committees and should be required to train officers using experts
from outside law enforcement, such as college professors and
sociologists.</TE>
<TE>   "Law enforcement is teaching itself. They need people from the
outside who can train officers, otherwise they are not solving
anything. How can a white police officer train other officers in
diversity if he has never been in my shoes?" said Hatcher, who is
black.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard Police Chief Art Lopez, who is working with community
representatives to develop an eight-hour ethics and diversity
curriculum that will include material on racial profiling, said he
agrees with Hatcher, in part, on this issue.</TE>
<TE>   Many classes offered to his department's officers during advanced
training are taught by outside experts, Lopez said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think, to some extent, what [the grand jury] is saying is
true," Lopez said. "You need scenarios, you need open-ended questions
and you need people from the community talking to officers and
sharing their stories and teaching them."</TE>

<HD>AIDS Activists Released</HD>
<DH>San Francisco: The two will be tried on charges of
harassing officials. They have protested prevention campaigns that
they believe stigmatize gay sex.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After spending 73 days in a San Francisco jail, two aggressive AIDS
activists have posted a reduced bail and are now free until their
trial on numerous felonies and misdemeanors.</LD>
<LD>   Protesters Michael Petrelis and David Pasquarelli were released
last week after their supporters posted a combined $220,000 bond.
Until then, the two had been held in lieu of $1.1 million.</LD>
<LD>   Petrelis and Pasquarelli are accused of harassing, stalking and
making criminal threats against public health officials, AIDS
researchers and newspaper reporters. They have acknowledged
making--or encouraging others to make--late-night phone calls using
sexually explicit language, but they deny threatening anyone.</LD>
<TE>   Among other things, they were protesting prevention campaigns that
they believe stigmatize gay sex.</TE>
<TE>   "It's good to finally be free," Pasquarelli said through his
lawyer, Mark Vermeulen. "I look forward to presenting my case to a
San Francisco jury, where I am confident I will be found innocent of
these outrageous charges."</TE>
<TE>   Vermeulen predicted the trial would be held in late spring or
summer.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of civil-rights and gay activists around the country have
defended Petrelis and Pasquarelli, saying the charges against them
are inflated and indicate the lengths to which prosecutors will go to
squelch political dissent.</TE>
<TE>   But many in San Francisco, including some AIDS prevention leaders,
aren't sympathetic.</TE>
<TE>   "They've crossed a line no real activist would," said Michael
Lauro of AIDS Activists Against Violence &amp; Lies. "They deserve to be
prosecuted to restore a sense of safety every citizen in our city is
entitled to."</TE>
<TE>   Before their Nov. 28 arrests, Petrelis and Pasquarelli expressed
anger over reports from the city's public health department, printed
in the San Francisco Chronicle, showing syphilis rates on the rise
among gay and bisexual men. They said they believed those statistics
were concocted to collect more federal money for the city.</TE>
<TE>   Pasquarelli is a spokesman for ACT UP San Francisco, a breakaway
group not affiliated with the national ACT UP. The Bay Area group
contends that AIDS is caused by the side effects of HIV treatment
rather than the human immunodeficiency virus itself.</TE>
<TE>   Petrelis, who is not a member of ACT UP San Francisco, disagrees
with those views but shares the group's belief that federal AIDS
funds are being misspent on unnecessarily frightening and sexually
graphic prevention messages.</TE>
<TE>   Both men are HIV-positive.</TE>

<HD>Jones Takes Aim at Riordan's Wife</HD>
<DH>Politics: He criticizes Nancy Daly Riordan's donations to a
Maryland Democrat. Ex-mayor's campaign officials say gifts have
stopped.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Secretary of State Bill Jones stepped up his attacks on the
front-runner for the GOP gubernatorial nomination Tuesday, releasing
a letter in which the chairman of the Maryland Republican Party
complains that the wife of former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan
has raised money for the Democrat running for governor in Maryland.</LD>
<LD>   Campaign records show that Nancy Daly Riordan has contributed
$3,000 since 2000 to Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, including $2,000 in
October, when Riordan was assembling his team to run for governor.</LD>
<LD>   Riordan campaign officials said Tuesday evening that they did not
believe that Daly Riordan held any fund-raisers. One event she
planned to co-sponsor in October was canceled because of the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks.</LD>
<TE>   "The fact that Mr. Riordan's wife, whose politics I do not know,
is aggressively and successfully raising money for Kathleen Kennedy
Townsend, at best, sends a poor message to California and Maryland
Republicans," Maryland GOP Chairman Michael S. Steele wrote to his
California counterpart, Shawn Steel, on Jan. 2. "At its worst, it
suggests that Mr. Riordan and his supporters back the campaign of
Kathleen Kennedy Townsend."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan has been criticized by his two rivals in the March 5
primary for giving hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democratic
candidates over the years, including former Los Angeles Mayor Tom
Bradley, state Sen. John Burton of San Francisco and Gov. Gray Davis,
the man Riordan now hopes to unseat. But the contributions of
Riordan's wife, a children's advocate who has helped raise money for
some Democrats, have rarely been cited by the former mayor's foes.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan campaign officials said Daly Riordan, a registered
Democrat, has stopped giving money to Democratic candidates.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, as Jones continued a bus tour through Southern
California, he said Daly Riordan's actions meant her husband should
not be the Republican Party's nominee. "They both represent our
party," Jones said. If Riordan becomes governor, Jones said, his wife
"will be called upon to help raise money for our party."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan campaign manager Ron Hartwig stressed that Riordan's wife
had ceased any Democratic fund-raising by the time the Maryland
official wrote his letter. "This should not be an issue in a
campaign," he said. "Mrs. Riordan has indicated her political
affiliation, and as an individual she has a right to her political
affiliation. Mr. Jones should be focused on the issues, as Dick
Riordan is."</TE>
<TE>   The back-and-forth over Riordan's wife opened a new front in the
continuing assaults from the underfunded Jones. Before an Orange
County stop to tout his education plan, the secretary of state
started his day outside a downtown high-rise that the Los Angeles
Unified School District is buying for $74 million. The building is
partly owned by billionaire Eli Broad, who with Riordan helped lead a
successful campaign to replace school board members and the district
superintendent.</TE>
<TE>   "Mayor Riordan's real record on education is one of failure and
favoritism, with the kids coming in dead last," Jones declared.</TE>
<TE>   The Riordan campaign dismissed Jones' education criticism, noting
that test scores are up in L.A. Unified since the board members the
former mayor backed were elected. "While Bill Jones is focusing on
trivial issues, trying to spin his way out of third place and being
an armchair quarterback, Richard Riordan is focusing on what's in the
best interests of children," Riordan spokeswoman Kim Serafin said.</TE>

<HD>Senate Panel Cites Enron for Contempt</HD>
<DH>Energy: Members also vote to seek a criminal probe into the
bankrupt energy company's shredding of documents.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>A frustrated Senate committee voted Tuesday to issue a new contempt
charge against the bankrupt Enron Corp. and ask California
prosecutors to open criminal investigations into destruction of
documents by company officials.</LD>
<LD>   Several committee members voiced alarm at suggestions that top
Enron executives may have sought to thwart the committee's
investigation of suspected price gouging during the state's energy
crisis last year.</LD>
<LD>   "We have to look at jail time [for Enron officials]," Sen. Debra
Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) told fellow members of the Select Senate
Committee on Price Manipulation of the electricity market.</LD>
<TE>   On a unanimous bipartisan vote, the committee adopted a finding of
contempt against Enron for disobeying a committee subpoena last week.
The committee ordered the company to produce a representative who
could testify on Enron's failure to turn over certain confidential
pricing documents.</TE>
<TE>   It also unanimously authorized Chairman Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana) to
ask district attorneys in San Diego and Sacramento counties and Atty.
Gen. Bill Lockyer to investigate whether any criminal laws in
California were broken when Enron employees shredded documents,
allegedly on orders of their superiors.</TE>
<TE>   The committee wants to find out if the destroyed documents dealt
with Enron's pricing actions in California, although members conceded
this evidence would be difficult to get. Violations of the California
anti-destruction laws could result in jail or prison terms, the panel
was told.</TE>
<TE>   At the hearing, Dunn noted that none of the half-dozen energy
companies in the investigation, including Enron, had agreed to sign a
promise that it would not destroy subpoenaed documents. Likewise,
other companies have been reluctant to surrender their records.</TE>
<TE>   Financial sanctions against Enron, Dunn said, might "impact Enron
in its current behavior" but also sends a "clear message to the rest
of the [energy producers] that ... we are serious about this
investigation."</TE>
<TE>   For Enron, it was the second time the Senate committee voted for a
contempt citation. A similar charge was brought last summer for
failure to comply with demands for information. It never came to a
vote of the full Senate because Enron representatives indicated at
the last minute that they would cooperate and make the documents
available.</TE>
<TE>   In the first citation, which remains alive in the Rules Committee,
it was recommended that Enron be fined about $1 million a day for
each day it failed to comply. Then, as now, there was talk of
prohibiting the company from doing business in California, an extreme
sanction that few lawmakers believed would be carried out.</TE>
<TE>   The contempt process is rarely used by the Legislature. It was
last tried in 1929 when several executives of a cement company were
sent to jail for refusing to cooperate in a price-fixing
investigation. Later the state Supreme Court voided the contempt
citations.</TE>
<TE>   No representatives of Enron appeared at the hearing Tuesday. But
later, Karen Denne, a corporate spokeswoman, insisted that the
beleaguered company had tried to cooperate with the Senate committee.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure what they are holding us in contempt for," Denne
said. "We've made every effort to make those documents accessible to
the committee." For example, Enron recently told Dunn that he could
see the documents in Portland, Ore., or Houston, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Dunn said Enron executives broke their promise last summer to make
the records available in Sacramento. He said he learned only a few
days ago that the records the committee sought were stored only in
Houston and Oregon and would not be sent to repositories in
Sacramento.</TE>

<DH>Health care: San Luis Obispo supervisors cite ongoing
financial woes. Working poor would be most affected.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>San Luis Obispo County has decided to begin proceedings to close the
123-year-old county hospital.</LD>
<LD>   The fate of the hospital has been one of the longest-running civic
debates in this area, which, despite its reputation as a
retirement-cum-wine tasting mecca, has many poor people in need of
care.</LD>
<LD>   The county Board of Supervisors voted 4 to 1 last week to hold
hearings on the closure, the latest and most dramatic action in a two
decades-old debate over the best way to provide medical care for the
poor and uninsured.</LD>
<TE>   Without the public hospital, the poorest patients could receive
care at local private hospitals, but no one knows what will happen to
the working poor who lack health insurance but don't qualify for
government assistance.</TE>
<TE>   The county initiated a cost-cutting effort several years ago that
included laying off doctors to keep the hospital afloat. Not only did
the actions anger medical providers in town, they also did not hold
down costs.</TE>
<TE>   "The turnaround plan failed for any one of a number of reasons,"
said county Supervisor Shirley Bianchi, a longtime supporter of the
public hospital. She cast the lone vote against holding hearings on
the closure.</TE>
<TE>   Bianchi said she is still searching for alternatives to shutting
down the hospital. "I'm hoping that before that happens, that things
will improve so we don't need to proceed."</TE>
<TE>   The hospital has had narrow escapes before. In 1999, the county
was considering closing the hospital. At that time, however, an
election brought two new members to the Board of Supervisors and the
board reversed course, deciding instead on the turnaround plan.</TE>
<TE>   "When we initiated the turnaround plan, things were not quite as
desperate," said Bianchi. The plan aimed at shaving losses to $6.5
million a year. Instead, losses have been above $9 million.</TE>
<TE>   More and more counties across the state have closed
taxpayer-funded hospitals in recent years, but some observers are
surprised that San Luis Obispo County would get into such trouble.
Bianchi said the public image of the county as a well-fixed
retirement destination that plays host to wine tours is misleading.
Not quite a less glittery Napa, Bianchi said, the Central Coast has a
substantial number of minimum-wage workers toiling in tourism and
agriculture.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not that well off," she said. "If you lift up the skirts of
this town, you see a lot of problems."</TE>
<TE>   The county supports not only the 40-bed hospital, but five
regional clinics. It is unclear whether the county will ultimately
get out of the medical care business altogether or still fund the
clinics.</TE>
<TE>   Bianchi opposes closing any facilities. "It's difficult for me to
believe a for-profit hospital will want to deal with the uninsured,"
she said. "I do not believe they will be treated with the same amount
of care."</TE>
<TE>   The problem isn't finding ways to care for the poorest patients.
The county has long-term contracts with the four private hospitals to
care for them. The issue is providing care to "unsponsored" patients:
people who are usually working and make too much to qualify for
indigent care, but not enough to afford health insurance.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, any person can walk into the county hospital and
receive care. But treating these uninsured patients will require new
contracts with private medical providers.</TE>
<TE>   Closing the hospital could take a year or more, officials said.</TE>

<DH>Politics: Stumping in the Central Valley, Gov. Davis
emphasizes $79-million program to promote state agriculture, cut in
sales tax on equipment.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TULARE</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis took his reelection campaign to the world's largest
farm equipment show Tuesday, touting a sales tax cut on tractors
approved last year and a program earmarking $79 million in state and
federal money to promote California agriculture.</LD>
<LD>   Davis spoke at the World Ag Expo of his admiration for farmers and
the adversity they overcome. And he recounted his administration's
efforts on behalf of the $28-billion agriculture industry, citing an
array of programs, including an eradication campaign against the
glassy-winged sharpshooter, an insect that ravages grapevines.</LD>
<LD>   Forgoing his trademark dark blue business suits for casual khaki
pants and blue blazer, Davis stepped into the cab of a John Deere
forage harvester. Later, leaders in the agricultural industry hosted
a fund-raiser for Davis in nearby Visalia.</LD>
<TE>   Agricultural interests have accounted for about $1.5 million of
the roughly $40 million Davis has raised since taking office in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to cede any part of California," said Davis, who
views the Central Valley as an important swing part of the state.
Davis won a majority of votes here four years ago, and said: "I
anticipate doing so again this year."</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Bill Jones, a rancher from Fresno and
Republican candidate for governor, was quick to criticize Davis,
saying the governor has failed to provide leadership "on one of the
most important issues facing California and our farmers, the state's
looming water crisis."</TE>
<TE>   Davis helped win voter approval in 2000 of a $2-billion water bond
to finance conservation, planning and development programs. But Jones
said Davis should have gone further by, for example, intervening on
behalf of ranchers in the Klamath River Basin whose water supplies
were cut last year because of environmental concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "This governor's record on agriculture has been abysmal," Jones
said by phone from a campaign bus tour in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, Davis has tilted to the left on several issues
as he tries to shore up his support among Democratic backers,
including labor and trial attorneys. But in the more conservative San
Joaquin Valley, the governor waxed nonpartisan.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't matter if you have an R or a D after your name," Davis
said. "What matters is whether you've delivered, and we've delivered
big time for agriculture. We do it because agriculture has to succeed
for the rest of us to succeed."</TE>
<TE>   Davis cited a decision last year to cut the state sales tax on
farm equipment, which could save farmers a combined $50 million a
year, or $5,000 on a $100,000 piece of heavy equipment. Davis and
Democratic lawmakers' decision to support the tax break helped secure
passage of the budget last summer by swaying Assembly Republicans
from the San Joaquin Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Davis also extolled a $79-million promotional program, funded by
$62 million from the federal government and $15 million from the
state, with matching money from growers. The program includes $51
million for a "Buy California" marketing campaign for farm products
and to promote California products internationally.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign comes as much of California's farm industry struggles
with low commodity prices, foreign competition and rising costs for
electricity and workers' compensation insurance premiums. Whether the
promotional campaign will have a bigger impact on farmers' morale or
on their bottom lines remains to be seen.</TE>
<TE>   Davis said he was not prepared to estimate the campaign's impact
on sales for farmers.</TE>
<TE>   The governor, who has promoted increased trade relations with
Mexico, also was careful not to sound too protectionist.</TE>
<TE>   But he said he has a vision for marketing California farm
products:</TE>
<TE>   "California standards are the highest in the world for
agriculture. We have the most rigorous environmental standards. We
need to use that to our advantage and advertise through the Buy
California program that no food is healthier than food grown in
California."</TE>
<TE>   Davis is the first governor to visit World Ag Expo since his
former boss, then-Gov. Jerry Brown, appeared here 21 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The expo is spread across more than 100 acres and includes heavy
farm equipment, trucks and other products offered for sale by 1,453
exhibitors.</TE>
<TE>   It draws thousands of farmers from across the state and country.
Some come from other countries.</TE>
<TE>   In a news conference after his talk, Davis offered no solution for
dairy farmers who, because of disputes and litigation with
environmentalists and the state, have been unable to obtain permits
to expand in Tulare County, the nation's top dairy producing county.
The disputes have blocked new dairies for three years.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody has to step in and resolve it," said Jack Prince,
executive vice president of Land O' Lakes, a dairy cooperative.</TE>
<TE>   The administration appears to have no plans to intervene. "What
we've made a decision to do is to let the two sides get together and
work it out," said Bill Lyons Jr., Davis' agriculture secretary.</TE>
<TE>   The California Farm Bureau, perhaps the most influential
organization of farmers, has endorsed Jones' candidacy.</TE>
<TE>   "He is part of our family," Bill Pauli, head of the farm bureau,
said of Jones.</TE>
<TE>   Pauli said he is not sure whom his group will support if Jones
fails to win the March 5 primary. The other Republican gubernatorial
candidates, former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and businessman
Bill Simon Jr., are refining their positions on farm issues.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, by contrast, is a known quantity, Pauli said.</TE>
<TE>   "The governor has done some good things," Pauli said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not in a position where we're in strong, strong
disagreement with the governor."</TE>

<HD>Argyros Adjusting to the Busy Life of an Ambassador</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Orange County businessman makes himself at home
in Spain. His wife agreed to change her name.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO and ANN CONWAY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As they move from laid-back Southern California to the precise royal
protocol of Madrid's Plaza Mayor, George Argyros and his wife are
learning that an ambassador's life requires certain trade-offs.</LD>
<LD>   Now that he is the U.S. ambassador to Spain, he has had to give up
his 6 a.m. runs around Balboa Island.</LD>
<LD>   Gone too are those unaccompanied drives to work from his bay-front
house on exclusive Harbor Island. Home is now a four-bedroom suite on
the second floor of the ambassador's residence adjacent to the U.S.
Embassy, where Argyros walks to work through a tunnel.</LD>
<TE>   Instead of yachts bobbing outside the front door, there are
tanks--two of them. And Argyros is accompanied by a security
contingent whenever he leaves the grounds.</TE>
<TE>   Judie Argyros has had to make an even more dramatic adjustment:
She changed her name.</TE>
<TE>   Argyros' wife of 39 years has always gone by Judie. But in
November, a language teacher noted during preparation for the
couple's move to Spain that Spanish speakers pronounce the J as an H.</TE>
<TE>   That would mean that "Judie" would become, phonetically,
"Hoo-dee-ay."</TE>
<TE>   "That didn't sound very diplomatic to me," she said. "So I decided
to go back to my birth name, Julianne, and go by Julia."</TE>
<TE>   George Argyros--dressed in tuxedo with tails and transported by
horse-drawn carriage--presented his credentials Dec. 12 to King Juan
Carlos during a ceremony with no visitors allowed.</TE>
<TE>   Then it was back to Orange County for the holidays before
officially moving into the ambassador's residence last month.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never been so busy," Argyros said. "It's a full-time
charge."</TE>
<TE>   His workday starts at 9 a.m. with courtesy calls by visiting
dignitaries, government ministers and guests, with meetings scheduled
every hour, according to aide Wendy Cantor, who moved from Orange
County with the Argyroses. Three days a week, the Argyroses attend
Spanish class.</TE>
<TE>   The midday break starts at 2 p.m. for lunch; meetings continue
through the late afternoon, followed by evening copitas, or
receptions. Dinner events begin at 9:30 p.m. or later.</TE>
<TE>   "He's on California time and on Spanish time," Cantor said.</TE>
<TE>   But perhaps the one aspect of Spanish life that has taken the most
adjusting to, Argyros said, is the daily siesta.</TE>
<TE>   Even though some areas are slowly shedding the traditional
three-hour midday break, most of Spain still operates from 10 a.m. to
2 p.m., then from 5 to 9 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't eat until 11 o'clock at night," he said. "It's a real
adjustment that Judie and I are going through."</TE>
<TE>   "We've tried to adjust our schedule so we can sleep, but so far it
hasn't worked," Julia Argyros said.</TE>
<TE>   Argyros, whose personal wealth is estimated at $1billion, is
accustomed to a certain level of pomp and ceremony. The former owner
of Air California and the Seattle Mariners baseball team, he had been
chairman of the board of trustees of Chapman University in Orange
since 1976 and chairman of the board of the Richard Nixon Library &amp;
Birthplace. He stepped down from both posts after being confirmed for
the ambassadorship by the U.S. Senate.</TE>
<TE>   A longtime Republican activist, Argyros led a $30-million
fund-raising campaign in California for President Bush's 2000
election. As ambassador, Argyros oversees about 400 employees at the
U.S. Embassy in Madrid and consulate in Barcelona. He is Bush's
representative to the Spanish king and to Prime Minister Jose Maria
Aznar, who also is president this year of the European Union.</TE>
<TE>   One of Argyros' most active roles--and the most traditional--is
that of chief cheerleader for improving trade relations with Spain,
which has a trade deficit with the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Argyros said he has been acquainting himself with trade issues and
intervening when problems arise. Last month, he hosted a reception to
introduce himself to 300 American CEOs in Spain. "I've gone to charm
school for two weeks, but you don't appreciate all that you get into
until you get there," he said. "It's much different than anyone can
imagine."</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Authorities used a bloodhound Tuesday to search the home of a
7-year-old girl who has been missing since Feb. 2.</LD>
<LD>   Officers led the bloodhound, on loan from the Riverside County
Sheriff's Department, on a thorough search of Danielle van Dam's
home. Authorities were hopeful that the dog's extremely keen nose
would detect something that other dogs had missed.</LD>
<LD>   Officials declined to say whether the dog found anything.</LD>
<TE>   Danielle's family says she was last seen when her father, Damon
van Dam, put her to bed on Feb. 1. She was discovered missing the
next morning.</TE>

<HD>Nearly Half Don't Store Guns Safely, Poll Finds</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly half of the gun-owning households in Los Angeles County with
children under 18 do not store guns safely, the Los Angeles County
Department of Health Services announced Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   A department-sponsored telephone survey found that 45% of those
gun owners don't lock the weapons in a cabinet or other firearm
container. About 114,000 children live in those homes.</LD>
<LD>   "These findings are of concern and it suggests a need for more
education," said Dr. Jonathan Fielding, director of public health.</LD>
<TE>   Fielding said the figures are minimum estimates due to
underreporting of gun ownership. Based on national surveys, the
actual percentage of unsafe storage could be much higher, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Data from 1999 show that 19% of deaths of people under the age of
20 in the county were by gunshot. "We're significantly higher than
the national average," which is 12%, Fielding said.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly safe storage practices won't reduce that to zero, but
it will reduce the preventable deaths," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The county recommends that guns be locked up unloaded, with
ammunition kept separately.</TE>
<TE>   About 8,000 households were randomly selected for the survey,
which examined a wide range of health issues. This was the first time
that specific questions about gun storage were included.</TE>

<HD>Panel OKs Extending LAX Food Contract</HD>
<DH>Concessions: Some commission members question the
president's negotiations with Host Corp., a contributor to the
mayor's campaign.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY L. RABIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With little public discussion and no competitive bidding, the city
Airport Commission on Tuesday approved a 2 1/2-year contract
extension for Los Angeles International Airport's major food and
beverage provider.</LD>
<LD>   The special arrangement for HMS Host Corp. benefits one of the
airport's biggest business interests, which also financially
supported James K. Hahn in last year's campaign for mayor of Los
Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Although the lease extension received unanimous approval from the
seven-member commission, the brief discussion exposed a growing rift
between Airport Commission President Ted Stein and some other
commissioners.</LD>
<TE>   Stein bypassed the normal channels for contract extensions by
personally negotiating the deal with the company. "I put the people
together," Stein said.</TE>
<TE>   Some saw the arrangement as the latest evidence of the president's
domineering style, sometimes in favor of Hahn's campaign
contributors.</TE>
<TE>   But Stein defended the deal as necessary to strengthen HMS Host,
which suffered economic losses because of the sharp drop in air
travel after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and delays in building
facilities in two LAX terminals.</TE>
<TE>   The deal will extend the politically connected firm's contract to
operate many of the airport's food and beverage services at LAX until
at least June 2008. Host manages many airport restaurants, including
California Pizza Kitchen, Pizza Hut, Burger King and Starbucks.</TE>
<TE>   The extension is even longer, until 2009, for food and beverage
concessions at United Airlines' Terminal 8 and retail stores in
American Airlines Terminal 4. The airport received more than $8
million in revenue from Host the year before the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Stein called the package "a fair deal for the airport, for Host,
and for some of the workers who Host will be required to hire back"
as passenger volumes increase.</TE>
<TE>   Security Measures Affect Restaurants</TE>
<TE>   Like many airport businesses, Host has laid off workers because of
the decline in air travel. Federally mandated security restrictions
also have had an impact because only ticketed passengers are allowed
beyond checkpoints, depriving most airport shops and restaurants of
the "meeters and greeters" who once supplied much of their business.</TE>
<TE>   But some skeptics at the airport see the extension as further
evidence of favoritism for Hahn loyalists and of Stein's heavy-handed
stewardship of LAX.</TE>
<TE>   Those concerns broke into the open Tuesday when commissioners
expressed discontent with not being informed about pending business
deals involving the world's third-busiest airport.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, commission Vice President Warren Valdry told Stein
to "find a way to keep the seven commissioners in the loop" so that
they "know what the heck is going on."</TE>
<TE>   That prompted this retort from Stein: "You don't even know what's
going on."</TE>
<TE>   Commissioner Mahala Walter then chimed in: "I don't have any idea
what's going on."</TE>
<TE>   Before that exchange, Commissioner Leland Wong had raised
questions about the process that led to the lease extension.</TE>
<TE>   "How did we pick Host? How are we determining who gets the 2
1/2-year extensions?" he asked. "I need to understand the rationale."</TE>
<TE>   The lease extension concept was raised by a Host representative at
a Dec. 4 commission meeting in Van Nuys. That night, the commission
unanimously approved a $9.5-million rent relief package for airport
concessionaires hurt by the dramatic falloff in business after the
attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   "We clearly understand the tragic circumstances that we are facing
is not your fault.... And I'm not here to ask you to make our company
whole," said Bruce Fish, general manager of Host operations at LAX.</TE>
<TE>   But Fish went on to suggest that the company be given an extension
of its contract to recoup its losses and recover its investment in
facilities, and "time to participate in the growth and the upside the
future may bring."</TE>
<TE>   Clarence Daniels, president of Concession Management Services, a
minority subcontractor to Host, added that the rent relief being
offered to other airport businesses would not help his operation.
Instead, he said, "We would like the airport to consider some
additional term."</TE>
<TE>   Rick Janisse, a deputy executive director of the city's airport
department, told the commission that some airport concessionaires,
including Host, chose not to participate in the rent relief program
from Oct. 1 to Dec. 31. That program allowed airport businesses to
pay only a percentage of sales rather than previously agreed-to
minimum monthly rents.</TE>
<TE>   When the rent relief package was approved, Stein served notice
that he was not inclined to support further rent reductions this
year, despite pleas from some concessionaires.</TE>
<TE>   Host Gave Thousands to Hahn Campaign</TE>
<TE>   Instead, extension of often-lucrative long-term leases became the
preferred approach for Host. The company and its employees
contributed $15,000 to Hahn's campaign for mayor. Fish declined to
discuss the contract negotiations or the company's political
contributions.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than considering lease extensions one at a time, Wong said,
the airport needs to have some type of criteria for determining which
concessionaires have been most affected by the economic decline since
Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   The discussion of the Host contract laid bare growing discord on
the commission, which oversees the operations of Los Angeles,
Ontario, Van Nuys and Palmdale airports.</TE>
<TE>   Tension is the most pronounced between Stein, a lawyer, political
fund-raiser and one-time candidate for city attorney, and Valdry, a
businessman.</TE>
<TE>   Valdry, first appointed to the Airport Commission by Mayor Richard
Riordan, sent a stinging six-page letter to Stein, his fellow
commissioners and airport officials, complaining bitterly about
Stein's conduct at a closed-door meeting last week.</TE>
<TE>   "Your manner was confrontational, abrasive, disrespectful and
uncivil," Valdry wrote. He said Stein ordered him to leave a meeting
with potential bidders on a contract to place commercial advertising
throughout the airport because he had not been invited to attend.</TE>
<TE>   Valdry said there is no policy prohibiting commissioners from
observing interviews with potential bidders. He said he had received
feedback from unidentified airport staff members about Stein's
"abusive and arrogant manner toward them."</TE>
<TE>   He criticized Stein's autocratic leadership and suggested that the
airport needs a board president who operates "with a quality of
statesmanship."</TE>
<TE>   Stein would not comment on Valdry's complaints.</TE>

<HD>A 'No' Vote Could Bring Back Willie Brown</HD>
<DH>Prop. 45: If proposal to loosen term limits fails, the San
Francisco mayor might run for state Senate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>More often than not, Willie Brown got the last laugh during his 31
years in the California Assembly--and he's getting a chuckle again
these days.</LD>
<LD>   A dozen years after California voters approved a strict
term-limits initiative, forcing an end to Brown's Assembly career in
1995, lawmakers are mounting a multimillion-dollar campaign to
potentially lengthen their careers, with passage of Proposition 45 on
the March 5 ballot.</LD>
<LD>   The twist is that if the measure doesn't pass, if term limits are
left unchanged, the man who once dubbed himself the Ayatollah of the
Assembly could end up back at the Capitol.</LD>
<TE>   As it is, state senators are limited to two four-year terms.
Assembly members can serve no more than three two-year terms. But
backers of Proposition 45, led by Democratic lawmakers and interest
groups that do business before them, are betting a political truism:
Voters have disdain for the Legislature, but like their hometown
lawmaker.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 45's backers say the measure offers a modest softening
of one of the nation's strictest term-limit laws. Critics denounce it
as an underhanded attempt to undermine a law that brings new blood
into the Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   If it passes, senators could seek a third four-year term and
Assembly members could seek two more two-year terms, provided they
gather petition signatures from 20% of the registered voters who cast
ballots in the prior election. After accumulating enough signatures,
they would face election.</TE>
<TE>   So how is it that Brown could return to Sacramento in 2004?</TE>
<TE>   If voters approve the initiative, Brown's longtime friend, Senate
President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco), could run for a
third term in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   But if it fails and Burton is forced from the Legislature, Brown,
67, whose tenure as San Francisco mayor is ending, would be the
favorite to succeed him. Brown already has raised more than $500,000
for a Senate campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "Voters ought to know--those who wanted term limits and whose
nightmare apparently was the continuation of my 31-year career--that
if they vote 'no' on this one, if they refuse to modify it, I'm
baaaack," Brown said, feigning an evil cackle.</TE>
<TE>   The initiative's backers include some of the strongest foes of
term limits. Many donors financing the campaign spent heavily against
Proposition 140, the initiative that brought about term limits a
dozen years ago. But a cursory reading of the initiative could lead a
voter to assume it is the brainchild of term-limit advocates.</TE>
<TE>   "Term limits have reinvigorated the political process by promoting
full participation and bringing a breath of fresh air to California
government," the preamble reads.</TE>
<TE>   It goes on: "The people recognize that in some instances a few
specially skilled and popular lawmakers have been unable to complete
important legislative programs for their districts before they must
leave office. In recognition of these special cases, the people of
California seek an opportunity by petition to extend some specific
district representatives' terms in office by a maximum of four
years."</TE>
<TE>   Term Limits Challenged in Other States</TE>
<TE>   In Idaho, the Legislature repealed that state's limits earlier
this month. An effort to end them in Maine is underway.</TE>
<TE>   But with polls showing a strong majority of California voters
still supporting the concept of term limits, proponents here opted
against pushing a measure to directly lengthen terms or abolish
limits altogether.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of like Proposition 13," Burton said, referring to the
landmark 1978 property tax-slashing initiative. "[Voters] have a
visceral reaction. But if you give the people the option at the local
level, that is something they will consider."</TE>
<TE>   Only five states have term-limit measures as strict or stricter
than California's, and legislators in both parties cite problems with
California's system, particularly in the Assembly. If Proposition 45
is approved, perhaps the biggest impact would occur in the lower
house, where leaders change every year or two. Speaker Herb Wesson
(D-Culver City), who took office last week, is the seventh speaker
since Brown was ousted after Republicans briefly gained control in
the lower house in the 1994 election.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're dealing with a budget of $100 billion," said Wesson,
who will negotiate his first budget this year without ever having sat
on a budget committee, "I think Californians will recognize the need
to have people with a tad more experience."</TE>
<TE>   Support Comes From Variety of Sources</TE>
<TE>   Backers of the ballot measure have raised $8.2 million. Donors
include organized labor and businesses with interests ranging from
banking and insurance to gambling and alcohol. Most of the donors
routinely have issues in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   The California Democratic Party, which taps donors ranging from
organized labor to business interests, is the single largest donor,
at $3 million.</TE>
<TE>   Labor unions have contributed $1.2 million directly to Proposition
45's passage.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to get voters to understand that this is a very simple
extension of one term for an elected official they think has done a
good job," said Los Angeles political consultant Bill Carrick,
managing the Yes-on-45 campaign and preparing a statewide television
ad campaign. "If you get people focused on that argument, they very
much like the idea. It is not an end of term limits."</TE>
<TE>   The campaign against 45 reports having raised a mere $37,100,
though leaders vow they will have enough money to wage a campaign.</TE>
<TE>   But the main organization pushing term limits nationally, U.S.
Term Limits in Washington, has not decided whether to help finance
the 45 opposition, Executive Director Stacie Rumenap said.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents include the three Republican candidates for
governor--former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, Secretary of
State Bill Jones and businessman Bill Simon Jr. Gov. Gray Davis has
not taken a position.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Schnur, a political consultant working against Proposition 45,
is homing in on Burton, 69, a veteran of three decades in office,
first in the Legislature, then in Congress, and now back in the
Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   "John Burton," said Schnur, "was elected to the state Legislature
the same year that Lyndon Johnson was elected president. Thirty years
later, his only solution to a budget deficit is to raise taxes. This
is what you get with a career politician like John Burton."</TE>
<TE>   Burton, widely viewed as the most influential lawmaker in
Sacramento, shrugs off the strategy: "Who knows me?"</TE>
<TE>   Schnur also warns that Proposition 45 would open a loophole in
another initiative approved two years ago capping contributions to
legislators at $3,000 from individuals, a charge that 45's backers
dispute. Incumbents could receive unlimited donations into their
bonus-term petition committees, gaining an unfair advantage over
challengers, Schnur said.</TE>
<TE>   "That is unregulated, special-interest soft money," Schnur said,
adding that California would be allowing more soft money--donations
not given directly to candidates--as Congress debates legislation to
restrict soft money in federal elections.</TE>
<TE>   Common Cause Takes Neutral Position</TE>
<TE>   Questions about how incumbents would finance their petition drives
helped convince California Common Cause, a nonprofit watchdog group,
to remain neutral on the initiative, though Common Cause opposes term
limits.</TE>
<TE>   "That is the concern," said Jim Knox of Common Cause. "It would
allow interest groups to become involved with signature gathering
campaigns in a way that would circumvent the current contribution
limits."</TE>
<TE>   At Burton's request, the legislative counsel studied the issue and
concluded last week that contribution caps imposed by Proposition 34
of 2000 would apply to petition committees. And if there is a
loophole, Burton, the main backer of Proposition 34, said he would
push legislation to close it.</TE>
<TE>   "Schnur is a good spin meister and he has spun this one pretty
well," said attorney Lance Olson, who represents dozens of
legislative candidates, as well as the Yes-on-45 campaign.
"Incumbents are candidates by definition. They have an obligation to
report and disclose all contributions."</TE>
<TE>   The original term-limits initiative, Proposition 140, won with 52%
of the vote in 1990. The win by term-limit proponents here helped
spread the movement nationally. Of the 17 states with limits, 14
adopted them after the California vote.</TE>
<TE>   Voters approved term limits at the time when the FBI was engaged
in a Capitol corruption investigation that ended with convictions of
14 people, including five legislators. In the Assembly, Brown was at
the flamboyant height of his power.</TE>
<TE>   "He personified the problem in Sacramento," said Republican
consultant Wayne Johnson, who oversaw the 1990 campaign for term
limits. "People had completely lost faith in their ability to get
anything done. The Legislature was far too cozy with power
interests."</TE>
<TE>   The Legislature is a far different place than the one Brown knew.
The number of women and Latino lawmakers has increased. Almost every
member of the Assembly is new since Brown's days. Even if Brown were
to return, some say, he could never achieve the power he once had.</TE>
<TE>   "The Willie Brown who left here is not the Willie Brown who would
come back," Johnson said. "The personalities have changed. There will
be constant turnover. It truly is a different place."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A two-hour time limit for uncovered parking spaces outside the Civic
Arts Plaza and City Hall went into effect this week, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The new time limit is intended to free up parking spaces for
people with quick business at City Hall and to encourage those who
need more time to use a covered parking structure at the site.</LD>
<LD>   "Cars have been parked in the outdoor lot all day long and that
was never the intended use for the front lot," City Manager MaryJane
Lazz said. The fine for violating the time limit is $40.</LD>

<HD>Political Plot Alleged Over Land Swap</HD>
<DH>Thousand Oaks: Council members question if three planners
delayed vote on the deal to help Linda Parks' campaign. She denies
accusations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A majority of the Thousand Oaks City Council is threatening to
censure one of its members and oust half the Planning Commission
because of a controversial land-swap deal.</LD>
<LD>   Three councilmen have called a special meeting today to discuss
the fracas that has erupted over a plan that would preserve nearly
200 acres in an area known as the Western Plateau.</LD>
<LD>   In exchange for the land, developers could build hundreds of
market-value homes elsewhere, while scaling back on senior and
affordable housing.</LD>
<TE>   Councilman Dennis Gillette said that as many as three of the
city's five planning commissioners may have conspired to help
Councilwoman Linda Parks in her bid for county supervisor by delaying
action on the land-swap deal at Monday night's meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "It takes on the appearance of being little more than a thinly
veiled subterfuge," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Gillette said Parks would be in a sticky position if she were
required to vote on the swap before the March 5 election. If Parks
voted for it, she might be accused of assisting developers, and if
she opposed the plan, it could hurt her reputation as a protector of
open space, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Parks called the accusation outrageous and contended that Gillette
and Councilmen Dan Del Campo and Andy Fox are trying to embarrass
her, help her campaign opponent Randy Hoffman and punish planning
commissioners for failing to rush through a plan that would benefit
developers.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole thing is ridiculous," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Planning commissioners are appointed by council members and serve
only in an advisory capacity. In a terse memo issued Tuesday, Del
Campo wrote, "No 'cause' is necessary to fire a planning
commissioner."</TE>
<TE>   But he went on to charge that at least one commissioner had
disregarded factual information, failed to allow the public to be
heard, wasted city staff time and jeopardized the land deal.</TE>
<TE>   At Monday night's meeting, Planning Commission Chairman Michael
Farris led a 3-2 vote to postpone a recommendation on the Western
Plateau deal for at least a week. He said he and Commissioners Nora
Aidukas and Claudia Bill-de la Pena had concerns about the accuracy
of land-use maps.</TE>
<TE>   Parks for weeks had been raising questions with individual
commissioners and city staff about the validity of the Western
Plateau deal, saying an earlier city map showed that a portion of the
land where Dos Vientos developers would be allowed to build
additional housing appeared to be park and open space.</TE>
<TE>   Under city law, construction on such land would require a public
vote, she said. City staff told planning commissioners that the map
Parks saw contained an error and that the land was not covered by the
ordinance.</TE>
<TE>   But Farris and his colleagues wanted more time to consider the
matter before issuing a recommendation.</TE>
<TE>   Parks and Farris said there were no secret strategy sessions among
commissioners, nor was there a plan to drag out the recommendation in
order to delay a council vote.</TE>
<TE>   "I would love to vote on it," Parks said of the land-swap
proposal. "I'm so ready to vote on it, I can't even tell you.</TE>
<TE>   "I gave those maps to planning commissioners and now they want to
remove those planning commissioners," Parks said. "That's all that's
happened. I'm not influencing them to vote against it or for it. I
just gave them the maps."</TE>
<TE>   Planning Commissioner Tom Glancy, who along with Commissioner Jim
Bruno was on the losing end of the panel's vote, said his other
colleagues' actions appeared orchestrated.</TE>
<TE>   "It was sort of apparent that those three guys came in with their
minds made up to delay a decision," Glancy said.</TE>
<TE>   "The smoke-screen is they wanted information, but when it was
stated that staff could explain their questions, they said they
really didn't want that, they wanted extra time to study it."</TE>
<TE>   Farris said he intended to issue a recommendation at the
commission's meeting next week, which would still get the proposal to
the City Council in time for its scheduled Feb. 26 vote--a full week
before the election.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm trying not to fly off the handle on this and to take it in
stride," Farris said. "But I think it's a sad commentary on the
council to take this action purely for political reasons."</TE>

<HD>Ojai Plaza to Get a New Look</HD>
<DH>Renovation: A $1.6-million face-lift is set to begin. Plan
to replace old fountain has generated controversy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARRI KARUHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The plaza behind Melony Vance's bookstore in downtown Ojai has become
an eyesore. The plants are dying, the sidewalks are cracked and the
water fountain is missing chunks of blue tile.</LD>
<LD>   "It looks like someone's neglected backyard," said Vance, manager
of Local Hero Books. "It's really a potentially nice space, but it's
not used and it's in disrepair."</LD>
<LD>   The city of Ojai next month plans to begin a $1.6-million project
to renovate Ojai Arcade Plaza--a park the size of a city block behind
several businesses between Ojai Avenue and Matilija Street. The goal
is to increase foot traffic, attract more customers and give
pedestrians a quiet place to sit, dine and enjoy public art.</LD>
<TE>   The project, to be finished in November, will include new sod,
lighting, brick sidewalks, restrooms, planters and carved boulders
for use as chairs and benches. There will be a community stage. About
30 trees will be planted and a 12-foot-wide circular fountain with a
4-foot-tall bronze Matilija poppy in the middle will become the
plaza's centerpiece.</TE>
<TE>   City officials hope that an increase in visitors will prompt
merchants to use their backdoors as second entrances.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to eliminate some blighted conditions behind the
Arcade and increase economic activity," said Kathleen McCann, city
redevelopment analyst. "Our downtown is important to our economic
vitality."</TE>
<TE>   The improvements have been planned since 1997, when the city hired
a firm to design the changes and hold public workshops to gather
opinions from residents, merchants and artists.</TE>
<TE>   The project has not been without controversy. The city decided to
remove the existing fountain and replace it with sculptures and other
work by local artists. The artwork would be exhibited on a rotating
basis throughout the year.</TE>
<TE>   Stuart Rupp, owner of Nancy Rupp Studio/Gallery, wants the
fountain preserved. It sits near the entrance of his gallery, which
belonged to his wife, who died last March. The fountain is the reason
she decided to open the gallery in Ojai, he said.</TE>
<TE>   More than that, Rupp said, the fountain has cultural and
historical value. The plaza was designed 25 years ago by renowned
architect Zelma Wilson, and though Wilson didn't design the fountain,
it is still part of her overall vision for the property, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Rupp said he has collected 1,200 signatures from people nationwide
and in England who visit Ojai annually and would prefer the fountain
remain. He said it's a better fit for Ojai than the proposed water
sculpture, which is expected to draw pedestrians into the plaza.</TE>
<TE>   "They are the antithesis of each other," Rupp said. "People come
to Ojai for the intimacy. They come for the spirituality."</TE>
<TE>   City Manager Dan Singer said the water fountain doesn't fit with
the renovation, and it's illogical to have two water features within
100 feet of each other. He said city officials will determine whether
it can be placed elsewhere in town. If not, it will be sold at
auction or to any interested buyer.</TE>
<TE>   Hallie Katz, who owns the Human Arts gallery along the plaza, was
on the five-person committee that in May suggested removing the
fountain. Katz said she didn't realize at the time how significant
the fountain is to some in the community and would have suggested a
compromise.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anybody realized how important the fountain would
become to people who have a sense of connection," Katz said. "I think
it was too cavalierly dismissed as an insignificant part of the
plan."</TE>

<HD>Airport Panel Revisits Plans for Palmdale</HD>
<DH>Aviation: Interest in the shuttered High Desert airport has
resurfaced, with commissioners voting to seek development proposals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four years have passed since Palmdale Airport had a commercial
flight. It now sits dormant alongside onion and pistachio farms, on
land the city of Los Angeles bought in the 1960s, when there was talk
of expanding the airport into a major hub.</LD>
<LD>   Such talk is in the air again.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles Board of Airport Commissioners voted unanimously
Tuesday to solicit proposals for a master plan to develop the
airport, located within the boundaries of Air Force Plant 42 in north
Los Angeles County's High Desert.</LD>
<TE>   The decision came at the urging of Mayor James K. Hahn, who wants
the Palmdale facility to ease the passenger burden on Los Angeles
International Airport. LAX and other Southern California airports
face a projected 50% growth in annual passenger loads--from 102
million to 157 million--in the next two decades.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's office said the goal is to make Palmdale a "regional
player" in air transportation, even though the airport never caught
on with passengers. Los Angeles World Airports spokesman Paul Haney
said a master plan will determine how much traffic a bigger Palmdale
Airport could accommodate.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody in L.A. knows what the heck we've got up there," said
Haney, whose agency oversees Palmdale Airport.</TE>
<TE>   The 70-acre facility had the capacity to handle 300,000 passengers
annually when flights there ended in 1998--the year United Express
stopped its daily shuttles to LAX, saying it wasn't making money.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles World Airports officials and Antelope Valley boosters
recently have tried to woo new carriers. They assembled an extensive
marketing package that they were planning to pitch to five commuter
airlines--on Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   The promotional meetings were canceled, and the marketing plan
remains on hold, said Jim Ritchie, Los Angeles World Airports deputy
executive director for long-range planning. But Palmdale Mayor Jim
Ledford said the master plan "will show the possibilities of [the
airport] and the growth it can handle."</TE>
<TE>   The plan will analyze the demand for passenger and cargo service,
and examine what effect an expansion would have on the desert
environment and freeway traffic. Ritchie said the plan should be
completed within three years. Its cost has not been determined.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's office estimates that the airport could serve a market of 7
million in the next 20 years. Los Angeles World Airports estimates an
annual passenger count of 1.5 million by then. Those numbers will be
reevaluated for the master plan, Ritchie said.</TE>
<TE>   LAX tallied 61 million passengers in 2001. Los Angeles World
Airports' other full-service airport, Ontario International, serves
6.7 million passengers per year, but has the capacity to expand to 22
million, agency spokeswoman Maria Tesoro said.</TE>
<TE>   The city owns more than 17,000 acres around the Palmdale site,
plenty of room to build a major international airport, Haney said.</TE>
<TE>   But for now, Antelope Valley leaders say they would be content
with a commuter airport that will meet local needs.</TE>
<TE>   "There are very few places with 600,000 people not served by an
airport," said David Myers, president of the Greater Antelope Valley
Economic Alliance. "Nobody is talking about turning Palmdale into LAX
North right now."</TE>
<TE>   A 2001 marketing study, Myers noted, found that 26 regional
businesses generated 125,000 air passengers per year. Most of the
businesses surveyed said they would trade low air fares at distant
airports for the convenience of Palmdale flights.</TE>
<TE>   Myers said some commuter airlines still want to talk about
reestablishing service.</TE>
<TE>   But United Airlines spokesman Alan B. Wayne said there is not
enough demand for the carrier to take another risk on Palmdale.</TE>

<HD>Ex-LAPD Partners Targeted in Probe</HD>
<DH>Police: U.S. attorney is looking into 1999 incident where
shots were fired at a teen drug suspect by officers called Batman and
Robin.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GLOVER and MATT LAIT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal authorities are investigating a 1999 incident in which a Los
Angeles police officer fired shots at a 14-year-old drug suspect and
then was accused of planting a gun to justify his actions.</LD>
<LD>   FBI agents and lawyers in the Los Angeles U.S. attorney's office
have questioned at least one current and one former LAPD officer who
were present on the night of the Feb. 8, 1999, shooting in South Los
Angeles. LAPD Officer William Ferguson fired at the teenager who
allegedly pointed a gun at him through the window of a crack house.
Ferguson missed, but the city paid out $1.7 million to settle a
lawsuit growing out of the case, which has drawn the attention of
federal authorities and others.</LD>
<LD>   Occupants of the house gave authorities an account of the event
that diverged in several places from the one detailed in police
reports, and a number of investigations are attempting to get to the
bottom of the case.</LD>
<TE>   The former officer questioned by federal prosecutors is Jeffrey
Robb, who was Ferguson's partner at the time of the shooting.
Together, those two officers were known on the streets as Batman and
Robin. Robb was granted limited immunity before giving a statement to
federal prosecutors in an interview last month, according to his
lawyer, Paul DePasquale. The lawyer declined to comment on what Robb
told investigators.</TE>
<TE>   FBI agents have also interviewed a second LAPD officer, who
responded to a call for backup on the night of the shooting and ended
up firing two shots at Ferguson, whom he mistook for a suspect.</TE>
<TE>   The federal probe is the latest investigation to be launched
regarding that shooting and its aftermath. The LAPD's inspector
general, Jeffrey C. Eglash, is looking into the Police Department's
handling of the case, specifically the question of whether members of
the city's Police Commission had all the necessary information when
they concluded that the shooting was within LAPD policy.</TE>
<TE>   Though the Police Commission's look at the case has implications
for department procedures, the federal probe carries potentially more
serious consequences. Federal law makes it a crime for police
officers to violate the civil rights of suspects.</TE>
<TE>   Federal investigators are examining the shooting as part of
wide-ranging corruption probe of Ferguson and Officer Ruben
Palomares. Palomares was not at the scene of the 1999 shooting but he
and Ferguson have been friends for several years; Palomares is in
federal custody in San Diego on cocaine trafficking charges.</TE>
<TE>   According to LAPD officials, authorities are investigating
allegations that Ferguson, Palomares and others robbed drug dealers
at gunpoint. Palomares has also been identified as a suspect in the
murder of a young man in Huntington Park but has not been charged in
that case. Attorneys for Palomares and Ferguson deny the allegations
against their clients.</TE>
<TE>   The federal involvement in the case comes after it has bounced
from one prosecutor to another in the district attorney's office for
more than two years. The case remains under review by the district
attorney, but according to one prosecutor familiar with the
investigation, there has been little headway.</TE>
<TE>   According to the official police report of the shooting, Ferguson
and Robb were conducting a routine narcotics investigation at a known
crack house when Frank Harris, 14, pointed a gun at Ferguson, who
fired in self-defense but did not hit the youth.</TE>
<TE>   The occupants in the house, however, said the officers tried to
provoke the shooting by banging on the doors and windows and
identifying themselves first as rival gang members and then as
police.</TE>
<TE>   A tape recording of a 911 call by one of the house's occupants
suggests that those inside were in fact confused about who it was
outside that night.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey lady," resident Magellon Harmon said to the emergency
dispatcher, "get somebody over here. We don't know if they're real
cops or not."</TE>
<TE>   Harris and others in the house that night said that the teenager
was unarmed and that police planted a gun in a bedroom, then later
claimed the weapon belonged to Harris. Shortly after the shooting,
LAPD investigators became concerned that Ferguson was engaged in
possibly criminal activity. Investigators obtained a search warrant
for his police locker and found a replica handgun that, in the
opinion of one detective, was most likely possessed by Ferguson to be
used as "planted evidence.'</TE>
<TE>   In November, the city agreed to pay $1.7 million to settle a civil
lawsuit filed by Harris and others who claimed they were tormented by
the officers.</TE>
<TE>   During pretrial depositions in the case, both Ferguson and Robb
refused to testify about details of the shooting, citing their
constitutional rights against self-incrimination.</TE>
<TE>   DePasquale would not say what prompted Robb to give a statement to
federal authorities last month.</TE>
<TE>   Also interviewed about the shooting was Officer Ernest Berry, who
is still assigned to the Southeast Division.</TE>
<TE>   The investigations into the 1999 shooting have turned up other
possible leads as well, according to sources familiar with the case.
After an article about the shooting in The Times in August, LAPD Sgt.
David Loera approached internal affairs investigators, saying he had
information about the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Loera's purpose in coming forward was to dispute a claim made by a
fellow sergeant who said he witnessed Ferguson plant a gun on the
night of the shooting, investigators said.</TE>
<TE>   Loera told investigators that he also was present but did not see
Ferguson plant a weapon.</TE>
<TE>   But he did tell the investigators about the discovery of a
"Pendelton-type jacket" found on the ground near where Ferguson had
been standing.</TE>
<TE>   Unbeknownst to Loera, Ferguson had previously been accused of
wearing a similar jacket to conceal his identity as an officer and be
able to sneak up on suspects.</TE>

<HD>Redistricting May Be Delayed</HD>
<DH>Boundaries: Council may extend the panel's deadline for
redrawing the 2nd District.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amid concerns about meddling in the 2nd District election, the Los
Angeles City Council agreed Tuesday to consider postponing the work
of a citizen redistricting commission until after voters go to the
polls March 5.</LD>
<LD>   Chief Legislative Analyst Ron Deaton, who was asked by the council
to report today on a possible extension of the March 1 deadline for
the commission to recommend new council district boundaries, said he
would probably urge a delay.</LD>
<LD>   The original deadline was set in 1999 before the council knew
there would be a special election March 5.</LD>
<TE>   Councilman Tom LaBonge raised the issue after the citizen
redistricting commission released a preliminary map that would divide
the 2nd District in two, with candidate Wendy Greuel living in one of
the new districts and candidate Tony Cardenas in the other.</TE>
<TE>   That created the possibility that after the new council district
boundaries take effect Aug. 1, voters in the March 5 election may not
be represented by the person elected.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Commission Chairman John Emerson proposed a new map
that would leave Greuel and Cardenas in the same council district.</TE>
<TE>   The Emerson alternative temporarily disarms the issue, but, if the
commission is forced to vote on his proposal by March 1 and rejects
it, some worry that such action could have an impact on the election
four days later.</TE>
<TE>   Both Cardenas and Greuel support an extension of the redistricting
deadline, with Greuel saying a delay "would be most beneficial for
the public's interests."</TE>
<TE>   But Councilman Jack Weiss said it was improper for the council to
extend the deadline because the redistricting commission had not
voted to request the action.</TE>
<TE>   "We all know there is an election coming up in a few weeks," Weiss
told his colleagues. "I believe that to take action here, without
receiving a formal request from the redistricting commission, would
inappropriately interject us into the political process."</TE>
<TE>   Emerson said he and some other commissioners support the delay.</TE>
<TE>   Others countered that the council became involved when it set a
deadline right before the election.</TE>
<TE>   "We are already involved in the politics of it," Councilman Eric
Garcetti said. "The sooner they send [the recommendation] to the
council, the more political it gets. The longer we keep it away from
council, the less political it is."</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski said commission members and the
public seemed to support a delay when Emerson announced the
possibility at a hearing Monday in Woodland Hills.</TE>

<LD>A painter who attacked robbers with a meat cleaver was shot to death
in a Los Angeles restaurant, and one of the robbers was killed by his
own accomplice in the struggle, police said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Police said three robbers entered Miltons, a Caribbean restaurant
at 2415 Slauson Ave. about 8 a.m. Monday and, at gunpoint, ordered a
painter and a cook to get on their knees.</LD>
<LD>   As the robbers ransacked the restaurant, the painter, Carl Scott,
36, of Reseda, grabbed a meat cleaver and struck one of them in the
back of the neck, then charged another robber, police Det. Scot
Williams said.</LD>
<TE>   As Scott and the second robber struggled over the cleaver, the
injured robber fatally shot Scott and wounded his own accomplice,
police said.</TE>
<TE>   The third robber, a 17-year-old boy, drove the other robbers to a
hospital, police said. The man wounded by the cleaver was in stable
condition, but his accomplice, who was 19, died, Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   Police are holding the youth and the wounded man, 19, whose name
they had not released.</TE>
<TE>   The cook wasn't injured, and the restaurant had not opened for
business.</TE>

<LD>A federal appeals court ruled that a Merced man on death row for 17
years is entitled to a hearing on whether his lawyer provided
deficient representation during the trial's sentencing phase.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decision came in the case of
Thaddaeus Louis Turner, who was convicted of the April 1984 stabbing
death of Roy Savage. In a 3-0 ruling, the court rejected claims made
by Turner and upheld his conviction. And the judges did not overturn
the death sentence.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Kim Wardlaw wrote that Turner's claim that his lawyer "was
ineffective during the penalty phase is compelling" and reversed a
federal judge's ruling that Turner was not entitled to a hearing.</LD>

<HD>Newport Failed to Test Sewer Sludge</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE HANLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Newport Beach officials said Tuesday they are investigating why the
city dumped large amounts of sewer sludge into an Irvine landfill for
the last 12 years without first screening the materials for toxic
metals, as required by state water regulations.</LD>
<LD>   Assistant City Manager Dave Kiff estimated that 140 tons of the
sludge was improperly dumped since 1990. He said he doubted the
dumping did much harm to the environment but said the staff is now
testing the material and getting permission before disposing of it.</LD>
<LD>   "I believe this was an honest mistake. People in the general
services yard were supposed to be testing this before they took it to
a landfill," Kiff said. "We want to investigate whether anyone knew
about it earlier and didn't say anything.</LD>
<TE>   "Either way, we shouldn't have been doing it. We're repentant.
We'd like to think of ourselves as respective of the environment. And
we've screwed up here, so we'd like to make it right."</TE>
<TE>   The debris in question includes sand, eggshells and raw human
waste routinely scraped from faulty or clogged pipes along the city's
sewer system. Other cities in the county ship this type of waste to
the Orange County Sanitation District. But in Newport Beach, it was
pumped out by vacuum trucks and ferried to the city's maintenance
yard, where it was watered down, dried, then mixed with beach debris
and other garbage before being carted away to the Frank R. Bowerman
Landfill in Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   Under state health and safety codes, before such waste is disposed
of it must be tested for metals and other pollutants. Violations can
result in maximum fines of $25,000 a day, depending on the severity.</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear Tuesday whether Newport Beach will face any fines.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County Waste Management Department, which oversees the
landfill, was closed in observance of Lincoln's Birthday on Tuesday,
and officials could not be reached. Another regulatory agency, the
Santa Ana Regional Water Quality Control Board, was also closed for
the holiday.</TE>
<TE>   Kiff said he has spoken many times with water regulators about the
issue, and they told him the dumping probably did not exceed the
state's threshold for toxic metals because Newport Beach has little
heavy industry. The Bowerman landfill is lined to protect
groundwater, and Kiff noted that the only business handling metals in
the city is a plating warehouse.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists believe the dumping was unintentional. However,
they worry about the potential harm to workers who handled the
material.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Skinner, a doctor of internal medicine and an
environmentalist in Newport Beach, said human waste can contain 100
types of viruses. Among the most harmful are hepatitis A and
salmonella, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kiff said workers have access to masks, gloves and other equipment
that they can use at their discretion. He said no worker has filed a
complaint about illness.</TE>
<TE>   The city, which stopped dumping the material four weeks ago, plans
to bring in an outside investigator to determine exactly how long the
dumping had been going on, Kiff said. An outside consultant will also
be hired to educate staff about regulations.</TE>

<HD>Stalking Law Called Too Narrow for Meg Ryan Fan</HD>
<DH>Crime: Officials must prove he meant to cause fear when he
broke into a Malibu home he thought was actress'.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Michael Hughes gave a simple, if incredible, explanation to
sheriff's deputies for why he broke into a Malibu house last month.
His fiancee forgot to leave a key under the mat, so he had to smash
the bedroom window to climb inside.</LD>
<LD>   The woman Hughes calls his fiancee is actress Meg Ryan, who says
she has never met the 30-year-old former real estate agent from
Florida.</LD>
<LD>   Hughes, who was also convicted last year of attempting to enter
President Bush's Texas ranch with firearms, reacted with disbelief
when a detective told him he was not engaged to Ryan. Hughes said
that no matter where in the world Ryan was, he would find her.</LD>
<TE>   Though Hughes might seem like an ideal candidate for charges under
California's anti-stalking law, prosecutors say he doesn't fit the
narrow legal definition of a stalker because they cannot prove that
he intended to cause fear in the actress--no matter how fearful she
now is. Although the state has made great strides in the last decade
in cracking down on stalkers, prosecutors say, the Hughes case
highlights weaknesses that remain.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan succeeded last week in getting a three-year civil restraining
order against Hughes. The Los Angeles County District Attorney's
office, meanwhile, has filed two misdemeanor counts of trespassing,
which could bring a jail sentence of one year. As it turned out, the
house he broke into was not Ryan's but that of another Malibu family
with the same last name.</TE>
<TE>   "We can only file what we have the evidence to prove," said Los
Angeles Deputy Dist. Atty. Loni Petersen. "Hopefully [the law] will
be broadened in the future."</TE>
<TE>   Hughes is behind bars awaiting trial and is scheduled to return to
a Malibu courtroom Feb. 21. A judge has expressed doubts that he is
mentally competent and might order psychiatric treatment before
Hughes can be tried in the alleged break-in.</TE>
<TE>   Even if a defendant is convicted of a stalking charge, the longest
prison sentence he can receive in California is five years. After
serving time, some defendants land right back on the victims'
doorsteps if they haven't received adequate mental health treatment,
psychiatrists say.</TE>
<TE>   Park Dietz, a forensic psychiatrist who has studied stalking, said
at least 95% of celebrity stalkers have a diagnosable mental
disorder, such as schizophrenia or erotomania, in which they have
delusions of love from others.</TE>
<TE>   Stalking has become so common that Dietz said virtually all
celebrities have stalkers, even if they don't know it.</TE>
<TE>   Celebrities often try to fend off stalkers with complex security
systems, bodyguards and fan mail screeners. The average celebrity
stalker begins by writing as many as a dozen letters before
attempting to visit the star, Dietz said.</TE>
<TE>   The murder of sitcom star Rebecca Schaeffer in Los Angeles in 1989
by an obsessive fan helped set in motion the first anti-stalking
legislation in the country. The state law made stalking a misdemeanor
but required the defendant to have the "intent of instilling fear or
death or serious injury."</TE>
<TE>   First-Time Stalking Is Now a Felony</TE>
<TE>   Since then, California's law has been strengthened to allow
first-time stalking to be charged as a felony and broadened to make
the intent to place the victim "in reasonable fear for his or her
safety." The law has also been expanded to include stalking a
victim's family.</TE>
<TE>   When prosecutors don't have enough to prove a stalking charge,
they often file other charges, such as burglary or assault. Or as in
the Hughes case, they file an aggravated trespassing charge, which
includes referral for mental health counseling and a longer jail
sentence and probation period than a regular trespassing charge. They
may also work with the county mental health department, which can
detain suspects if they are a danger to themselves or others.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors use the law for non-celebrity stalkers, many of whom
are obsessed with former friends or spouses.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases where the anti-stalking law is employed, proof of
intent to place victims in fear is not difficult. Film director
Steven Spielberg's stalker went to his Pacific Palisades home at
least four times in 1997 before being arrested with duct tape, a box
cutter and handcuffs in his possession. Jonathan Norman was found
guilty of stalking and sentenced to 25 years to life under the
three-strikes law.</TE>
<TE>   A stalking case involving Madonna was even clearer, said Deputy
Dist. Atty. Rhonda Saunders, who helped write the law and its
revisions. In 1995, a homeless man showed up at the singer's home
repeatedly and threatened to kill her, her assistant and her
bodyguard.</TE>
<TE>   On one occasion, Robert Dewey Hoskins lunged at the bodyguard and
tried to grab his gun after scaling the wall of Madonna's estate. He
was convicted of stalking, making terrorist threats and assaulting
the bodyguard, and sentenced to 10 years in state prison on the
multiple charges.</TE>
<TE>   Evidence of Intent Is Not Found</TE>
<TE>   In the case of Hughes, prosecutors say, they have not found
evidence that shows that he intended to place Ryan in fear for her
safety.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes' quest to see Ryan apparently began in December 2000,
shortly before he appeared at the front gate of Bush's ranch in Texas
and asked to see him. Hughes was arrested after authorities found
four high-powered weapons, including a pistol and a rifle, in his
rental car.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes was treated in a federal prison hospital before being
deemed competent to stand trial, where he pleaded guilty to unlawful
attempted entry to the residence of the then-president-elect. He was
sentenced to six months in prison, time he had already served at the
hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Before his Texas foray, Hughes had sent an e-mail to Ryan's
manager, according to court papers.</TE>
<TE>   After leaving the Texas hospital, Hughes hired a retired FBI agent
in Florida and a Los Angeles private investigator to find Ryan's
address, according to her security consultant. In early January,
Hughes packed his passport and almost $3,000 in cash and drove from
Florida to see her, documents filed in Superior Court said.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 6, Hughes drove to a Malibu address with a night vision
scope, directions to the house and a magazine cover story on Ryan,
police said. He grabbed his silver flashlight, broke the window,
climbed in and then spent the day at the house, the documents said.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes allegedly ate two meals, threw away a book on Jacqueline
Onassis and several full cans of beer and rearranged the outdoor
furniture so he could lie by the pool while he waited for Ryan.</TE>
<TE>   But instead of Meg Ryan, Tomas and Andrea Ryan, who are not
related to the actress, came back to their home after a wedding to
discover an intruder, dressed in black and wearing a fishing cap.
They called the sheriff's department, which arrested Hughes and
notified Ryan's security consultant.</TE>
<TE>   Meg Ryan, star of such films as "When Harry Met Sally" and
"Sleepless in Seattle," received a temporary restraining order in
January, which was extended last week. Ryan's attorney said he was
satisfied that the judge ordered Hughes to stay at least 150 yards
from the star.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just hoping that it stops now," attorney Michael Plonsker
said.</TE>
<TE>   During the Feb. 4 hearing in Santa Monica Superior Court, Hughes
represented himself and told the judge that a rabbi had informally
married the couple in Vancouver, Canada. Hughes said he needed a few
hours with Ryan to patch up problems.</TE>
<TE>   "Meg is a little upset with me," he said. "She has been upset with
me for some time now."</TE>
<TE>   Ryan, however, submitted a declaration to the court saying that
she has never met John Hughes. His actions, she wrote, "are alarming
and have caused me to be concerned and fearful for my and my family's
safety."</TE>
<TE>   After the judge read her statement aloud, Hughes said he believed
that Ryan was coerced. "This issue goes deep into the CIA. It goes
into the NSA, it goes into the White House, and it goes into the
FBI," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Suspect's Mother Says He Has Illness</TE>
<TE>   Hughes' mother, Stephanie Hughes, said in a telephone interview
that her son suffers from bipolar disorder. "I have a very warm,
compassionate son," she said. "John would never harm a flea."</TE>
<TE>   John Hughes graduated from the University of South Alabama and
worked in real estate, his mother said. He bought houses, fixed them
up and rented them out. Hughes married and had a son, but he split
with his wife two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   That was about the time that the paranoia set in, Stephanie Hughes
said. "It just snuck in the door," she said. "It just started
building."</TE>
<TE>   Police said Hughes told them he had been prescribed Wellbutrin, an
antidepressant, and Depakote, a mood stabilizer.</TE>
<TE>   A psychiatrist who evaluated Hughes on behalf of Meg Ryan's legal
team said he was delusional and potentially dangerous. "This
gentleman is brought to a courtroom, where ideally he should be
brought to a psychiatric hospital," said psychiatrist David Glaser of
Encino. But Glaser said he was impressed by how articulate Hughes was
in court, saying his cross-examination was as effective as that of
some attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Wright, a former FBI stalking expert, said disorders are not
readily apparent in all stalkers who are ill. "They don't have one
eye in the middle of their foreheads," he said. "They're often very
intelligent, very crafty people."</TE>
<TE>   Saunders said the fact that many stalkers have mental illnesses
doesn't lessen the crimes.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is, we can't keep them forever and we can't cure
them," Saunders said. "The only thing we can do to protect the victim
is to take them off the streets for as long as possible."</TE>

<HD>MWD to Boost Security for Its Water Systems</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Board OKs an additional $5.5 million to prevent
potential saboteurs from dumping poison into reservoirs and treatment
plants.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The day after the FBI renewed its warning that municipal water
systems are potential terrorist targets, the governing board of the
Metropolitan Water District of Southern California voted Tuesday to
spend an additional $5.5 million to prevent sabotage by terrorists
armed with poison.</LD>
<LD>   The money will be used to tighten security at treatment plants and
reservoirs throughout the district, which supplies water to 17
million people in six counties.</LD>
<LD>   "If we can't deter them, at least we want to detect them so we can
get law enforcement out there," said Jill Wicke, the district's
manager of water system operations.</LD>
<TE>   Two-thirds of the money will go for increased barriers, alarms and
video monitoring. The rest will go for such measures as improvements
to the automated testing system, so that officials will know
immediately if poison has been dumped into the water system.</TE>
<TE>   The plan has been in the works for weeks, following an analysis of
the district's security system by Control Risks Group, an
international security firm based in London. Coincidentally, the FBI
on Monday renewed its warning to the MWD and other water districts in
the nation that water treatment and conveyance systems are inviting
targets for terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, officials at many water
agencies increased security. The Los Angeles Department of Water and
Power doubled the number of guards at its plants.</TE>
<TE>   The California Highway Patrol deployed aircraft to patrol the
state's two major pipelines, the California Aqueduct that brings
water from Northern California, and the MWD's Colorado Aqueduct from
the Colorado River.</TE>
<TE>   Legislation is pending in Sacramento and Washington to reimburse
local agencies for security measures.</TE>
<TE>   "While we hope for eventual reimbursement," MWD Chief Executive
Ronald Gastelum said of the $5.5 million, "we will spend this money
with no regrets."</TE>
<TE>   Water quality specialists say that it would take an enormous
amount of poison to affect a water system.</TE>
<TE>   Still, officials are concerned that even a small amount of
contaminant could give a victory for terrorists by undermining public
confidence.</TE>
<TE>   "We have remained on heightened alert since Sept. 11," Wicke said.
"We don't ever anticipate going back to the way we were."</TE>

<LD>Homelessness in California is so widespread that the state needs a
new office to coordinate a response, Senate President Pro Tem John
Burton said.</LD>
<LD>   Burton intends to seek legislation creating an Office of
Homelessness, and requiring counties to compile statistics on how
many homeless people die in the streets.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, 235 people died in San Francisco, Santa Cruz and Santa
Clara counties, he said.</LD>
<TE>   Burton also wants the state to borrow $2 billion to build
affordable housing. Voters would consider the bond measure in
November if the Senate-approved measure clears the Assembly this
spring.</TE>

<LD>The toll from Sunday's brush fire rose to 36 homes destroyed and
5,240 acres burned, fire officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The fire, which raced through avocado groves and million-dollar
homes, may have started as a controlled fire by farmers burning
brush. The cost of fighting the fire has been computed at $1.1
million.</LD>
<LD>   Besides the houses, 17 outbuildings, one mobile home, 22 private
vehicles, two fire engines and three smaller structures were
destroyed. On Tuesday, the fire continued to burn in uninhabited
sections of Camp Pendleton, but no structures were threatened.</LD>

<LD>San Francisco International Airport could face fines and stricter
oversight after suspicious runoff spilled into the San Francisco Bay
in December.</LD>
<LD>   The spill showed traces of cyanide and may have violated a
pollution cease-and-desist order by the San Francisco Bay Regional
Water Quality Control Board.</LD>
<LD>   Airport spokesman Ron Wilson said no cyanide is kept at the
airport, and the reading probably is a false positive.</LD>
<TE>   "It was properly treated material that entered the bay," Wilson
said Tuesday. He said 20 stickleback fish were placed in the treated
water entering the bay that day and all lived.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson attributed the incident to heavy rainfall that overwhelmed
the system.</TE>

<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>A native of Iraq who was arrested during a federal crackdown on
foreign students who overstayed their student visas has pleaded
guilty to charges of immigration fraud and illegal weapons
possession.</LD>
<LD>   Maher Hazim Aziz, 38, became a target of the crackdown in December
because he had violated the terms of his six-month student visa by
dropping out of flight school, prosecutors said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors said they would ask a judge to sentence Aziz to no
more than 14 months in prison.</LD>
<TE>   He will be deported after completing his sentence, Assistant U.S.
Atty. Michael Wheat said.</TE>
<TE>   Aziz entered the United States from Canada, where he holds
citizenship, in 1997 on a student visa to attend flight school in the
San Diego area.</TE>
<TE>   He left flight school before finishing the program and went to
work at several jobs using a fraudulent immigration document and
Social Security card, according to court records.</TE>
<TE>   Federal agents found the fraudulent documents, along with a
9-millimeter pistol, .45-caliber handgun and 60 rounds of ammunition
at his home last week during an Immigration and Naturalization
Service roundup of foreign students in the San Diego area who
overstayed their visas.</TE>
<TE>   As an illegal immigrant, he is barred under federal law from
possessing firearms.</TE>
<TE>   Aziz was the only one of the nine students detained in the roundup
who faces criminal charges.</TE>
<TE>   Six men were either deported or allowed to leave the country
voluntarily.</TE>
<TE>   Two others are awaiting immigration proceedings.</TE>

<LD>After nearly 20 years of honorable service, I left the LAPD on a
beautiful, clear day in 1999--disciplined for not calling the station to
see if rain was forecast.</LD>
<LD>   As a lifelong L.A. resident and LAPD officer, I have been honored to
have served among some of the most dedicated and caring individuals I've
ever met. With them, I have witnessed humanity at its best and worst.</LD>
<LD>   Throughout my career, neither Chief Bernard Parks nor the City Council
(except for council freshmen) ever demonstrated any practical evidence to
reform the LAPD. While officers like me were forced to follow policies
(conjured by a clueless council) that resulted in dangerous hiring
practices, unnecessary shootings and beatings, Parks (and mentor Willie
Williams) continued to promise reform, showing a handful of pathetic
complaints as evidence of progress.</LD>

<LD>Re "Riordan Ducks Davis' Left Jab," by Dan Schnur, Commentary, Feb.
8: Gov. Gray Davis' diversion strategy of picking abortion as "the first
topic of his campaign" reminds me of the '60s, when the Republicans tried
to poison the 1962 presidential election by making John Kennedy's
Catholicism an issue.</LD>
<LD>   I respect Richard Riordan's honesty and maintain that taking an oath
to abide by the laws of our land does mean that one must give up his or
her personal and religious convictions. It is apparent that Davis wishes
to avoid the big issue--the energy crisis--and I feel his attempt to
divert and/or win the pro-choice vote by attempting to "pigeonhole"
Riordan will backfire not only with conservatives but with liberals as
well.</LD>

<TE>   Why is Riordan whining about personal attacks? Aren't a candidate's
position on abortion and his honesty about that position relevant issues?
Riordan seems to be too delicate for statewide politics. Maybe he should
stick to what he does best--riding a bicycle through the south of France.</TE>

<TE>   So Riordan doesn't want votes from pickup owners? Your Feb. 7 article
about his shoot-from-the-lip style revealed a side of Riordan that I
already suspected was there, but now see blatantly confirmed. He is not
only a political chameleon but a snobbish and arrogant one. A man driving
a pickup truck sees Riordan's campaign bus and gives him a thumbs-up. The
gubernatorial candidate flashes his own thumbs-up, then mutters:
"Rednecks for Riordan."</TE>
<TE>   Stereotyping and prejudice, anyone? Apparently, the big tent Riordan
preaches for the Republican Party doesn't include any voter he might
consider a "redneck"--it's all about the sort of rich, liberal,
pseudo-Republicans who are the only people Riordan can claim to
represent.</TE>

<TE>   Gov. Davis is really piling it on Riordan for his previous statements,
which have no bearing at all in the present. I would think the public
would find more interesting reading in their electric bills since, thanks
to the outstanding contracts signed by Davis, we will be massively
overpaying for the next decade. I would think that far more Californians
are interested in the horrible state financial deficit and electric rates
than abortion; Davis is simply putting up a big smoke screen with the
abortion issue to hide the real state problems.</TE>
