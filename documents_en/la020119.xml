<LD>Adults may be well advised to have some Dramamine handy before tuning
into the new PBS children's series, "Dragonfly TV," launching Sunday.
This "edutainment" science series is a head-spinning mix of fly-by
scenes, jittery effects, stand-on-your-head camera angles and
never-ending, pulsing loops of pop music.</LD>
<LD>   But apparently it's an age thing: A test at home revealed that the
viewing experience is not nearly as stomach-wrenching for younger
viewers, steeped in MTV culture from birth.</LD>
<LD>   The live-action "Dragonfly TV" is one of two new fun-and-learn PBS
shows crafted to grab the attention of 'tweeners--ages 8 to 12. In
the math-focused, animated "Cyberchase," beginning Monday, three kids
are special agents for a computer motherboard that calls for help
when villainous Hacker (voiced by Christopher Lloyd) threatens the
virtual worlds of cyberspace.</LD>
<TE>   Both shows are designed to show that, yes, math and science do go
beyond the classroom.</TE>
<TE>   "Dragonfly TV," based on and named for the respected children's
magazine that is inserted in the Scientific American Explorations
family magazine, features two enthusiastic young hosts who bridge the
herky-jerky, graphic design-heavy video segments. Experts in various
fields, from paleontology to animal behavior, appear, but mostly the
show spotlights young people engaged in favorite sports and
activities: kayaking, martial arts, surfing, rock-climbing,
skateboarding, robot-building.</TE>
<TE>   It's not just the activities, though, it's the how and why of
them: What makes white-water rapids rapid, how does foot position
affect the power of a taekwondo kick, how do you build a robot that
can unlatch a latch, how do you weigh a whale?</TE>
<TE>   The fast pace may not be adult-friendly, but it craftily gives the
acts of discovery and data-gathering an infectious sense of urgency
and importance. Viewers are encouraged to go to the show's Web site,
www.muohio.edu/dragonfly, to share their own discoveries and for
science project tips and interaction with kid and adult scientists.</TE>
<TE>   "Cyberchase" is in the more traditional cartoon mode: Kid heroes
use a computer as a portal to a different virtual world in each
episode, going up against kooky bad guys. (In addition to Lloyd as
Hacker, Gilbert Gottfried voices a cyber-bird pal named Digit and
guest vocal talent includes Bebe Neuwirth, Jasmine Guy, Geoffrey
Holder and others.) It's not superpowers that save the day, however.
It's math power.</TE>
<TE>   How to find the villain's castle on a world full of castles? The
kids survey a town's inhabitants for villain-sightings, end up in
Dracula's domain and realize they must start again with more specific
questions.</TE>
<TE>   How can they get across a hole in the ground too wide to leap? How
high must they climb to reach a ski lift whizzing the Hacker's
henchmen out of their reach? They have to estimate, not guess,
volume, height, quantity and distance to save the day.</TE>
<TE>   Don't look for creative breakthroughs, but "Dragonfly TV" and
"Cyberchase" combine fun and thought with enough conviction to make
inventive problem-solving--and curiosity--look pretty cool.</TE>
<TE>   "Dragonfly TV" can be seen Sundays at 8 a.m. and "Cyberchase"
weekdays at 2:30 p.m., both on KCET-TV.</TE>

<HD>American Dream Analyst</HD>
<DH>As a New York bartender, Joe Hortua heard it all, musings
that inspired his first produced play, "Making It," premiering at
South Coast Repertory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BOEHM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Joe Hortua entered the job market in 1997 with a master of fine arts
degree in playwriting from New York University. That qualified him to
earn his living as a restaurant barkeep.</LD>
<LD>   Talk about good career moves. Now, at the young-for-a-playwright
age of 30, Hortua is getting his first professional production--South
Coast Repertory's world premiere of "Making It," which opens Jan. 25.
The play grew out of the Chicago native's four-year tenure watching,
listening and learning at Lumi, a tony Italian eatery on Manhattan's
Upper East Side.</LD>
<LD>   "I was still so green, and I learned so much about life," the
spiky-haired Hortua said during a recent interview at, fittingly, the
oak-trimmed bar in South Coast's lobby. Hortua found much about the
restaurant microcosm unforgettable. He accumulated a boxful of notes
on yellow legal pads that he filled with stories and observations
inspired by his co-workers and customers.</LD>
<TE>   What Hortua saw and heard from his perch behind the bar in New
York has been distilled and transformed in "Making It," a play whose
theme he sums up as "deconstructing the myth of the American Dream."</TE>
<TE>   The play has three sets of characters.</TE>
<TE>   The waiter has an acting degree and besieged hopes of doing
something with it; his boss and nemesis, the restaurant owner, freely
shares her caustic life lessons as an actress who gave up her dreams
for something solid.</TE>
<TE>   The diners consist of an engaged couple--he an aspiring young
playwright who loves to pontificate; she a warmhearted and a good
listener. Hortua regards the woman, Claire, as a touchstone for the
audience, the one clear-seeing person in "Making It" who is not
consumed with "making it." Paolo, the playwright, erupts against his
neglectful mentor, a distinguished gay author and social activist who
becomes Paolo's emblem for all baby boomer phoniness,
self-righteousness and self-absorption. The generational rift between
boomers and Gen-Xers, and the question of whether the younger
generation is hopelessly lost in cynicism, emerge as themes.</TE>
<TE>   Working in the kitchen are two immigrants of unspecified
nationality. One is in love with America's promise. The other thinks
Americans are crazed malcontents. Hortua himself is the son of
immigrants who arrived here as adults. His mother, Milagros, left
Bilbao, Spain, for adventure. His father, Jose, came from Colombia,
where his family's poverty forced him to quit school at age 12. In
America, the senior Hortua went from sweeping the floor at a Chicago
auto parts company to heading its data processing department. He
worked hard, got some breaks, became an apartment landlord on the
side and put Joe and his younger brother, a civil engineer, through
college.</TE>
<TE>   When David Emmes, South Coast's co-founder and producing artistic
director, read "Making It" last summer, he decided that the virtually
unknown Hortua deserved a shot on the theater's Second Stage, and
that he would direct the show himself.</TE>
<TE>   Emmes was intrigued not only by Hortua's themes, but also by his
unorthodox writing style. As befits a fan of David Mamet and Ernest
Hemingway, Hortua writes in short, undecorated sentences that are
small kernels of meaning. Through repetition, accretion and subtle
variation, he builds them into lengthy speeches. On the page,
Hortua's script looks like free verse. He says his style is largely
inspired by Thomas Bernhard, an Austrian playwright who died in 1989
and, according to "The Cambridge Guide to Theater," is known for
"skillfully orchestrated cascades of words."</TE>
<TE>   Emmes says he is coaching the cast of "Making It" to treat
Hortua's prose cadences with a care usually accorded classical verse
plays. "It's very rhythmic and musical in the way great classic texts
often are."</TE>
<TE>   This is heady stuff, given Hortua's unpromising literary
beginnings. He says his bad attitude and miserable study habits as a
schoolboy in Morton Grove, Ill., earned him Ds and Cs and moved one
high school English teacher to a book-flinging rage. But he liked
reading newspapers and magazines, especially about politics, and he
wrote for the school paper. Despite poor grades, he was accepted into
the highly rated journalism program at the University of Missouri--he
suspects because of his ethnicity.</TE>
<TE>   Everything changed when Hortua came home for winter break during
his freshman year. First he met Beth Wohlschlaeger, now his wife and
the mother of their infant son, Pablo. Two weeks later, he nearly
died from a burst appendix. During his recuperation he resolved to
become serious about his studies. Soon, he was bingeing on Hemingway
and political writers.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't until the last semester of his senior year--now he was
at the University of Iowa, home of the famed Writers' Workshop--that
Hortua even gave a thought to writing plays. To fill out his credits,
he enrolled in a seminar taught by playwright Naomi Wallace--then an
unknown graduate student, later the recipient of a 1999 MacArthur
Foundation grant for her politicized plays.</TE>
<TE>   Something clicked in Hortua, and Wallace saw it. She gave him
special attention and remained a mentor after he graduated. Hortua
can remember having read just one play--"A Raisin in the Sun"--before
taking Wallace's class. The only one he had seen that made any
impression was "Hair," and that was because of the nude scene. Now he
got up early on Saturday mornings, encamped himself in a deserted
college library and devoured the works of Mamet, Sam Shepard, Caryl
Churchill and lesser-known European writers recommended by Wallace.</TE>
<TE>   "Joe's work excites me because it engages boldly in issues of
power," Wallace said via e-mail from London, where she lives. "Who
has it, who doesn't and why. He's a very talented writer with a big
scope. Even if his characters don't leave the room, Joe brings all
the intricacies and mess of the world inside that room for them to
engage in."</TE>
<TE>   His sole aim at the start of penning "Making It" was "to write
about a restaurant in its totality." Only as characters and scenes
emerged did he realize that his restaurant was a caldron in which
bigger themes of generational conflict and the pitfalls of the
American Dream were bubbling up.</TE>
<TE>   Hortua hopes, ultimately, that "Making It" will challenge viewers
who accept uncritically the truth and virtuousness of the American
Dream. But neither does he wish to dismiss the dream. Hortua was
tending bar as recently as last summer; his wife is on maternity
leave from her job as a psychotherapist treating troubled teens in a
group home. The family of three occupies a one-bedroom apartment in
Astoria, Queens, and Hortua wants more.</TE>
<TE>   He has a commission from South Coast to write another script. But
the next big step, he says, may be a move to Los Angeles to pursue
opportunities in television, where writers typically earn far more
than they can make from plays. He will go where he needs to go for
the sake of making it because, well, being American means you get the
chance to try.</TE>
<TE>   "Most Americans live with this myth that makes them neurotic; they
always feel like they're not living up to it and they should be
elsewhere," Hortua says. "But [pursuit of the American Dream] is so
like my dad: You figure out what you want and you just go ahead and
do it. [The dream] is attached to certain myths, but on the other
hand it's very true for me--and very valuable."</TE>

<DH>A guitar belonging to the late Andy Kaufman is up for
auction on EBay, put up by a former New York talk-show host.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL BROWNFIELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Comedian Andy Kaufman's guitar is item No. 1501446139 on the auction
Web site EBay (www.ebay.com). The opening bid, last Saturday, was
$100; as of Friday, with 20 hours and five minutes left before the
bidding closed, the price had grown to $3,850, although the seller
didn't sound too proprietary about the item.</LD>
<LD>   The seller, in fact, didn't really seem to know what the guitar
was worth.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not that emotionally attached to it," said Joe Franklin, on
the phone from New York.</LD>
<TE>   He is the same Joe Franklin whose contribution to the 20th century
was 43 years of talk-show memories, otherwise known as "The Joe
Franklin Show," a late-night fixture of the New York airwaves.
Franklin interviewed everyone from the sublime to the legitimate, and
some of them more than once. According to Franklin, he had Otto
Preminger on 175 times, Rudy Vallee 125  and Morris Katz, "the
world's fastest painter," 800.</TE>
<TE>   It's all captured in Franklin's 1995 book, "Up Late with Joe
Franklin: Stories of the Greats, the Near Greats, the Ingrates, the
Has-Beens and the Never Weres."</TE>
<TE>   In all, Franklin says, he conducted more than 500,000 interviews,
though most sources, including Franklin himself, have cited it as
around 300,000. "The Joe Franklin Show" aired on WABC and later on
WWOR, which, thanks to the early heydays of basic cable, introduced
Franklin to a nation that probably asked, in unison, "Who is this
guy?"</TE>
<TE>   He was, it turns out, a show-business institution of a sort, with
suspiciously pasted-down hair, arcane show-biz banter and "Broadway
Danny Rose" for a booking agent. The earnestness with which Franklin
would introduce his nobody guests was lampooned by comedian Billy
Crystal, who did Franklin on "Saturday Night Live," increasing his
cult profile.</TE>
<TE>   But Franklin will tell you that his guests, back in the day, also
included the actor Ronald Reagan and the singer Bing Crosby. When
Franklin, who says he is 71, retired from TV in 1993, he decided to
sell off his considerable stock of memorabilia.</TE>
<TE>   Like nostalgia's junk man, Franklin had collected reams of stuff
from guests, asking them things like: "Could I have that tie clip?"</TE>
<TE>   In this way, Franklin says, he came into the possession of Charlie
Chaplin's cane and Harold Lloyd's straw hat.</TE>
<TE>   And Andy Kaufman's guitar.</TE>
<TE>   According to Franklin, Kaufman liked to stop by his office. In
all, they had 25 lunches together, he said. "He used to drop in here
with John Travolta and Andrew Dice Clay," said Franklin, creating a
somewhat dubious picture. "They were like a trio, all good friends."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the EBay literature makes a persuasive argument for the
guitar's authenticity. Thematically, it asserts the logical
connection between Kaufman and Franklin--both were attracted to show
business' lunatic fringe. It says the guitar is from an appearance
Kaufman made on the show in 1974, when the comedian was an emerging
but unknown oddball on the New York club scene, honing his trademark
bits: an Elvis Presley impersonation, his character Foreign Man.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the actual value of the guitar, forgetting Kaufman's
notoriety, is not promising. For one thing, it has only five strings,
and its strap is made of "ordinary household twine."</TE>
<TE>   But Lynne Margulies, Kaufman's longtime girlfriend, figures the
guitar at least has to be functional enough to play "The Cow Goes
Moo," one of the songs Kaufman liked to play.</TE>
<TE>   Margulies, who runs an art gallery in Hollywood, regularly trolls
EBay to see what phony piece of Kaufman ephemera is being sold as
real, particularly as it concerns a figure whose death people thought
was staged. Kaufman died in 1984 of cancer. He would have been 53
last Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   There was a rash of items for auction around the time of "Man on
the Moon," the 1999 Kaufman biopic starring Jim Carrey, but much of
that activity has since died down, Margulies says.</TE>
<TE>   When she saw the guitar listed, "my first instinct was, 'Oh,
that's [nonsense].' Andy never told me about giving him the guitar.
But Andy did have a real soft spot for Joe Franklin." Last month,
Margulies says, the guitar appeared on EBay, but the bidding stopped
at $4,082, with the "reserve not yet met" notation, meaning the
owner's minimum price hadn't been met.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Zmuda, the Kaufman intimate who for years helped the comedian
perpetrate his stunts, said that early on in his career, Kaufman "had
quite a few cheap guitars."</TE>
<TE>   "Joe Franklin gave him a chance to go on the show [when] he wasn't
famous at all," Zmuda said. "I wouldn't doubt it if Andy even
suggested to Joe, 'Hey, I can give you some props for your museum.' "</TE>
<TE>   Franklin, for his part, said that a friend was handling the EBay
sale for him. "I gave him maybe 75 items and I said, 'Play around,
have a good time.' "</TE>
<TE>   Seventy-five items, however, probably doesn't begin to penetrate
Franklin's stock. Visitors to his office have been taken aback at the
clutter. "The room is so jammed with memorabilia that Mr. Franklin
can conduct interviews only by opening his office door and seating
the interviewer partly in the hall under a sign that says, 'Memory
Lane,'" wrote a New York Times reporter who visited Franklin in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   Franklin did say that he'd found a buyer for Greta Garbo's shoes.</TE>
<TE>   As his phone rang constantly, Franklin rattled off some more
anecdotes. "Sometimes I'd go backstage and be very assertive," he
said, explaining that this was how he'd ended up with one of Vivian
Leigh's dresses and Heddy Lamar's doll. Under persistent questions
about Kaufman's guitar, Franklin grew magnanimous. "I'll give it to
you for nothing, you want it?"</TE>
<TE>   These days, Franklin does nostalgia segments for Bloomberg Radio,
has a weekend show on WOR radio and a restaurant, Joe Franklin's
Memory Lane restaurant.As for the memorabilia, Franklin is more
circumspect. A company he signed a deal with to market his
memorabilia went bankrupt, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But he still has the Harold Lloyd hat. The Harold Lloyd estate, in
fact, had called, "but I lost their number.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't know how to get ahold of the Harold Lloyd estate, do
you?" he asked.</TE>

<KH>Sundance Festival</KH>
<HD>A Friendlier Climate?</HD>
<DH>Despite longtime industry resistance to ethnic movies, a
flurry of entries from minority filmmakers at this year's screenings
signals hope for change.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN CLARK</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>PARK CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>Among its many functions, the Sundance Film Festival is in the
business of hope. And one segment of the filmmaking population that's
sorely in need of hope is actually getting it--this is the year, or
at least the moment, of the ethnic filmmaker.</LD>
<LD>   According to festival artistic director Geoffrey Gilmore, 2002 is
a "breakout year for Latino films."</LD>
<LD>   "This is the first time that we've had more good Latino films
[submitted] than we put in the festival." And there is an abundance
of films by Asian Americans too, along with a couple of prominent
Native Americans, although very few African Americans.</LD>
<TE>   Gilmore won't speculate why this is so--he's been around too long
to do that. Each year, Sundance features some sort of statistical
anomaly that may or may not mean something--movies directed by women,
movies starring Parker Posey (or Christina Ricci). What he can say is
that this development is a good thing. Whether this good thing can
overcome Hollywood's resistance to ethnic films is another matter. In
other words, no matter how good they are, they might not get picked
up for distribution.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line for the studios is that ethnic films--even highly
touted ones--aren't proven moneymakers. Take, for example,
"Girlfight," about a teenage Latina boxer (made by an Asian American,
Karyn Kasama), which shared the Grand Jury Prize in 2000 but crashed
at the box office. Part of the reason for such failures lies in
Hollywood's inability to market such films, but the fact is the
industry needs something to market--faces, names. White indie
filmmakers have known this for a long time, larding their films with
recognizable actors in order to secure funding and distribution. Whom
does an ethnic filmmaker turn to when he wants to make a movie about
his own community?</TE>
<TE>   Arthur Dong, whose documentary "Family Fundamentals," about
homophobia among Christian families, is in competition here, says
that when an Asian American filmmaker he knows shopped his project to
agents and studio executives, more than one of them said, "This is
great, but you don't have any white people in it."</TE>
<TE>   Lupe Ontiveros, a critically acclaimed Latina actress, has spent
much of her English-speaking career playing maids. That's one reason
why she jumped at the chance to play the theater manager in Miguel
Arteta's "Chuck &amp; Buck," a breakout role for her last year after
playing at Sundance.</TE>
<TE>   Justin Lin, whose film in competition, "Better Luck Tomorrow," is
about Asian American teenagers, says that actor Jason Tobin came to
him with a sample reel of his previous roles, in which he played only
delivery boys.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, these stereotypes are no more or less than a reflection
of societal attitudes. Patricia Cardoso, a Colombian who directed
"Real Women Have Curves," also in competition, about a Latina's drive
for independence, says she would sometimes park her car in Bel-Air
and walk to UCLA, where she was going to school. Drivers would stop
and ask her what house she worked for.</TE>
<TE>   Sherman Alexie, a Native American who wrote the 1999 Sundance
entry "Smoke Signals" and is back this year with "The Business of
Fancydancing," about the homecoming of a Native American poet, says
that when he gets off a plane in a small town, people wonder what
they're supposed to do with this big, long-haired Indian, as he
describes himself. He says he gets the same look when he walks into a
room full of studio executives.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps inevitably, the very real stereotyping faced by ethnic
filmmakers encourages them (well, at least one of them) to indulge in
their own stereotyping.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to sound anti-Semitic [but] it's easier if you're
Jewish," Alexie says. "Marlon Brando [who once made the same point]
wasn't all that wrong. In proportion to the national population,
whatever it is, it's disproportionate, it's a family business. How do
you get into the family? How do you get into any tribe?"</TE>
<TE>   One avenue is to make documentaries that attract what one
filmmaker describes as "white guilt money" from liberal corporate and
nonprofit benefactors. Few of these filmmakers would turn down this
kind of money if it were offered.</TE>
<TE>   .</TE>
<TE>   Nor are these filmmakers above using their ethnicity to aid their
careers, albeit uneasily. Bertha Bay-Sa Pan, whose "Face," about
several generations of Chinese American women in New York, is in
competition at the festival, won a Directors Guild Award for best
Asian American filmmaker. "There is attention put upon me because I'm
Asian and female," she says. "If it's to my advantage, why not take
advantage of it? We all have different advantages. You use whatever
you can use."</TE>
<TE>   Pan thinks her film is very commercial, so much so that she was
surprised to be accepted at Sundance. But it's automatically
considered outside the mainstream--and therefore independent--by
virtue of the fact that it is by an Asian American and about Asian
Americans. And these are not Asian Americans as often depicted by
Hollywood: delivery boys or obedient daughters. One character, for
example, abandons her child.</TE>
<TE>   Lin's film "Better Luck Tomorrow," as described by Gilmore,
doesn't feature "archetypical nerds or good boys." "I feel like it
confuses the viewers," Lin says of his movie. "The one big comment we
get is that these characters could have been anybody. That's the
struggle for Asian American filmmakers. I wanted to deal with issues
of teen violence and angst from an Asian American perspective."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Aiming for Accurate Portrayal of Indians</TE>
<TE>   Chris Eyre, a Native American who directed "Smoke Signals,"
returns this year with "Skins," about a Sioux Indian reservation
policeman and his alcoholic Vietnam veteran brother. In movies,
Indians fall into two camps, Eyre says. They symbolize spirituality
or politics: the noble savage or genocide victim. Eyre would rather
portray Indians as they really are, he says.</TE>
<TE>   "They have greater iconic value in American culture than any
minority, but they are people," Eyre says. "Self-representation of
Indians is one of the last cinematic frontiers left. Most other
ethnic groups have forged their own territories."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike white filmmakers, who can create, say, a white sociopath
without worrying that audiences will think all whites are sociopaths,
ethnic moviemakers often feel they have to be mindful of the images
they project. Because there are so few of these images, each one is
loaded. Cardoso says she had to moderate the attitudes of her
heroine's parents--initially, neither wanted her to continue her
schooling--lest audiences think all Latino parents are that way</TE>
<TE>   Latino director Miguel Arteta, whose film "The Good Girl" is in
this year's festival--and got picked up for distribution by Fox
Searchlight--says he took some heat, ironically, from the white
community, for his depiction of a Latino gigolo in his first Sundance
entry, "Star Maps" in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never felt like I've wanted to make myself a spokesman for
the Latino world," Arteta says. "I think the most radical and
politically correct thing to do is to do the most personal stories."</TE>
<TE>   And so after "Star Maps," Arteta made "Chuck &amp; Buck," featuring a
white protagonist's homoerotic fixation on his white childhood
friend.</TE>
<TE>   A personal story is always going to be a tough sell, no matter who
you are, says Alexie.</TE>
<TE>   "If you want to be independent, be independent," Alexie says. "The
second you feel like you deserve a large audience, you'll start
making junk."</TE>

<HD>Mel Martin Charges Up Standards</HD>
<DH>The low-profile veteran saxophonist and his backup trio
romp through a hard-swinging set of bebop variations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Saxophonist Mel Martin is one of a number of first-rate jazz artists
whose residence in the Bay Area--outside the major jazz media centers
of New York  and Los Angeles--has tended to reduce his visibility.
Which is not to say that he hasn't had a busy career, working with
such pop performers as Santana, Boz Scaggs and Van Morrison, and
leading his own group, Bebop and Beyond, on a series of tribute
albums to Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk and Benny Carter.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday night at Spazio in Sherman Oaks, Martin made one of
his occasional Southland appearances, combining participation at the
International Assn. for Jazz Education and the National Assn. of
Music Manufacturers with a few local gigs. Leading a Los Angeles
rhythm section consisting of pianist Jon Mayer, bassist Darek Oles
and drummer Roy McCurdy, he romped confidently through a
hard-swinging set mostly devoted to bebop variations on a group of
familiar standards.</LD>
<LD>   Martin's big, muscular sound, reminiscent at times of Dexter
Gordon, was especially effective with the flowing melodic lines of
"There Is No Greater Love." And, on another standard, "Polka Dots and
Moon Beams," he switched to the curved soprano saxophone, using the
rarely heard instrument to deliver a somewhat more tempered, if no
less rhythmically urgent, set of variations.</LD>
<TE>   Martin couldn't have asked for a better stylistic partner than
Mayer, whose ever-present sense of swing and articulate bop
improvising provided a creative counter and an empathetic backup
support. Oles and McCurdy, two of the Southland's most dependable
rhythm section artists, held the music together with their
characteristic creative ease.</TE>
<TE>   Interestingly, despite the no-nonsense, straight-ahead bebop
nature of the music, a medium-tempo version of "All the Things You
Are" drew a mobile, middle-aged couple to the dance floor. Their
presence, along with their sheer terpsichorean energy, was a reminder
of a time when jazz--even extremely adventurous jazz--and dancing
were enthusiastically compatible musical partners.</TE>

<HD>Distribution Deals on Brisk Pace</HD>
<DH>No breakout films have surfaced and few entries can be
called commercial (weird might be better), but more sales are being
made than in recent years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN CLARK</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>PARK CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>This year's Sundance Film Festival is one of the hottest film markets
in recent memory, with more than half a dozen movies picked up for
distribution so far. Yet many people here are complaining that the
festival, which wraps up this weekend, lacks the fireworks, the
breakout movies, that have characterized the past couple of years.</LD>
<LD>   "It absolutely is the most robust year in quite a while," says
Jeff Dowd, a producer's representative who has a number of films
here. "We went in somewhat concerned, but we're all seeing our films
are going to sell."</LD>
<LD>   Few of the films that have been sold can be called commercial.
Many of the stories are downbeat, if not downright weird. The films
are stubbornly un-formulaic. And yet here they are, guaranteed
distribution.</LD>
<TE>   What's even more mystifying is that this flies in the face of the
general drag the economy has had on the festival. The venues, which
are normally sold out, have had tickets available. Main Street and
the restaurants are quiet. It might be assumed that the independent
studios would be pulling back along with everybody else--but that
wasn't the case at all.</TE>
<TE>   Among the pickups:</TE>
<TE>   * Finn Taylor's "Cherish," a film that is screening in competition
at the Sundance Film Festival, is about a dippy computer nerd (Robin
Tunney) who is accused of running over a cop while drunk. She's
confined to house arrest while awaiting trial, and develops a
relationship with an equally nerdy security expert (Tim Blake Nelson)
assigned to make sure that the tracking device on her ankle works
properly. Fine Line bought it for between $1 million and $2 million.</TE>
<TE>   * Gary Winick's "Tadpole," another film in competition, is about a
precocious prep-school boy (Aaron Standford) who has a crush on his
stepmother (Sigourney Weaver), vows to steal her away from his
self-obsessed father (John Ritter), and inadvertently falls into the
arms of her 40-ish best friend (Bebe Neuwirth) while she's giving him
a massage. Miramax bought it for around $5 million.</TE>
<TE>   * Karen Moncrieff's "Blue Car," which is featured in American
Spectrum--the place where films that are considered either too
commercial or not cutting-edge enough for competition go--is about an
aspiring teenage poet (Agnes Bruckner) who lives with her bitter
mother (Margaret Colin) and her withdrawn little sister who likes to
mutilate herself. She is befriended by her high school English
teacher (David Strathairn) and ultimately betrayed by him. Miramax
bought it for between $1 million and $2 million.</TE>
<TE>   * Todd Louiso's "Love Liza," in competition, is about yet another
computer nerd (Philip Seymour Hoffman), whose wife commits suicide.
The entire film is devoted to his grief, which is only allayed when
he sniffs gasoline from a rag and befriends a model airplane
enthusiast. Sony Pictures Classics bought it for $2 million.</TE>
<TE>   Among the other pickups: Miguel Arteta's "The Good Girl," bought
by Fox Searchlight, $4 million; John Malkovich's "The Dancer
Upstairs," also bought by Fox Searchlight, $2.5 million; and Gus Van
Sant's "Jerry," bought by ThinkFilm, $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Last year at Sundance the independent studios picked up few films,
perhaps in response to the excessive amounts spent on films in
previous years that had no hope of making the money back. Indies were
guilty of being swept up in the enthusiasm Sundance audiences
displayed toward the films, forgetting that these people don't
necessarily represent the movie-going public and that the festival
itself is a hothouse, forcing films to bloom that would bloom nowhere
else.</TE>
<TE>   Dowd says that while the figures paid for films this year are
relatively low, , the final outlay, factoring in prints and
advertising and overhead, is still considerable. The indies may buy a
movie for $1 million but end up spending $4 million or more on it. He
thinks that these open wallets are in some sense related to Sept. 11,
in that there is a hunger for films of substance.</TE>
<TE>   But attorney John Shloss, who represents many independent films
and filmmakers (he helped broker the deal for "Tadpole") takes a more
pragmatic view.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's the slowdown in production in anticipation of the
strike, which continued after 9/11," he says. "There are unique
factors too. [Fine Line Pictures President] Mark Ordesky getting back
into it after being tied up with 'Lord of the Rings.' You've got
[Miramax co-Chairman] Harvey Weinstein rediscovering these films."</TE>
<TE>   "They saw the critical and commercial success of last year's
films," says Nancy Utley, president of marketing for Fox
Searchlight--among the pickups last year were Miramax's "In the
Bedroom"--adding that even if the films that were bought are
uncommercial, they can make their money back if they perform well on
the art-house circuit, in worldwide sales and on home video.</TE>
<TE>   Anyway you slice it, if you're selling or buying or showing movies
at the Sundance Film Festival, this has been a good year.</TE>

trouble, the car turns blue. In fact, if you slam on the brakes, it

<LD>The article on "star gazing" ("Hey, Don't Look, but Isn't That ...,"
by Paul Brownfield, Jan. 10) was correct: The best way to spot
celebrities is by chance.</LD>
<LD>   I lived most of my life in Los Angeles and recall the following
more memorable sightings: sitting behind Walter Matthau at a concert
in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, nearly colliding with Cary Grant in
the doorway of a men's clothing store on Santa Monica's 3rd Street,
dining next to Robert Wagner and Natalie Wood at a Chinese restaurant
and standing next to a warm and engaging Debbie Reynolds at a Los
Angeles International Airport baggage-claim carousel.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I enjoyed Paul Brownfield's article about celebrity sightings but
I'm astounded that The Times somehow overlooked a Web site called
"Seeing Stars" (http://www.seeing-stars.com). I discovered it five
years ago, and it's definitely the best guide to L.A. and star
spotting I've ever seen. I refer to it every time I make a trip out
to Southern California.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In your "Unofficial Field Guide to the Stars," you neglected to
mention the essential spot for both star gazing and Southern
California culture: the carwash.</TE>
<TE>   At the Santa Palm Car Wash in West Hollywood (locally known as the
"Car Wash of the Stars"), I have seen all of the Hollywood elite,
including the likes of Jodie Foster, Halle Berry, Rob Reiner and
Salma Hayek. If you want to catch a glimpse of stardom, just follow
the line of dirty cars.</TE>

<LD>Neither Gov. Gray Davis' recently announced proposal of tax
incentives for the film industry nor the similar proposal announced
last month by Los Angeles Mayor James Hahn are going to be much help
as long as the incentives are limited to films budgeted under $10
million. Most projects in this range are made with small, usually
nonunion crews often working on deferments (which means ultimately
for free), increasingly on video.</LD>
<LD>   Where these incentives would really be beneficial is for projects
in the range of $20 million to $40 million, especially genre films,
which require a standard crew and can afford to at least pay them
scale. Being able to make more films of this type here would provide
the economic benefits to both the industry and the local
infrastructure the politicians claim to be trying to help.</LD>
<LD>   This does not solve the problem of actually getting the financing
for films in this range, the biggest stumbling block to increased
production. A way of doing this, with a requirement that production
and postproduction be done locally, would be the biggest benefit of
all.</LD>

<TE>   I hate to sound ungrateful to Gov. Davis, but I am. His new
proposal to offer tax credit to low-budget film producers to lure
them back from Canada is like trying to get the fox back into the
henhouse.</TE>
<TE>   Why draw the tax-credit line at low-budget productions? Why bring
back the worst of what film production has to offer? So-called
low-budget producers have already received major contract concessions
from nearly all of the state's film and television unions.</TE>
<TE>   The workers that Davis is using as a base for his tax credit
already have given producers nearly 25% of what they normally would
make. These workers do not expend 25% less energy. They don't lift
and move things that have agreed to be 25% lighter or less dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   These workers will not benefit from Davis' tax credit; it will
merely allow them to be taken advantage of more often.</TE>

<LD>In his response to the Howard Rosenberg article on "Sex and the
City," Lee M. Jockers (Letters, Jan. 12) bashes the four female
stars, asserting that "men of quality and substance would have no
interest in these foulmouthed, aging bimbos and their $300 shoes."
Jockers is simply wrong.</LD>
<LD>   I have been assured by my wife, who is an expert on the cost of
fashion, that the Manolo Blahnik and Jimmy Choo shoes featured on
"Sex and the City" start at $500, and many styles of these shoes cost
more than $800.</LD>
<LD>   Please, Mr. Jockers, be accurate with your criticism.</LD>

<HD>Sept. 11's Impact on Arts</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>While I was glad to read that Los Angeles' largest arts institutions
have not experienced the dramatic downturn in contributions they had
anticipated during the fall ("Region's Major Arts Groups Hold Steady
Post-Sept. 11," by Christopher Reynolds, Jan. 14), I am nevertheless
concerned that your article may have created complacency among
supporters of mid-size and smaller nonprofit organizations.</LD>
<LD>   Arts managers with whom I speak express a shared concern that the
real "post-9/11" impact is yet to be felt, and we must make special
efforts to focus our energy and resources on our core programs. It
has always been a challenge for us to differentiate ourselves in such
a large and thriving arts market. In a time of such uncertainty,
however, it is especially important that our patrons realize the
value of their support and its power to help us fulfill our missions.</LD>

<LD>I was hardly surprised to see a well-deserved article on the revival

surprised not to see mention of the famed Silent Movie Theater, since
1942 as much a landmark on Fairfax Avenue as Canter's Deli and the
Farmers Market.</LD>
<LD>   After all, it's the only one like it in America, with a
fascinating history of its own. It offers comfortable seats combined
with period-piece music and a wide cross-section of patrons.</LD>

<LD>Just a quick note to say how much we enjoyed the article on the 17th
annual Elvis Birthday Bash at the House of Blues ("Behold the Many
Moods of Elvis," by Randy Lewis, Jan. 8). But a couple of things were
overlooked that should be mentioned.</LD>
<LD>   The article failed to mention the founder, Art Fein, who works all
year to make the fun happen. But the real oversight was not noting
the first-time addition of an emcee, the great Fred Willard. He not
only kept the between-act patter lively, he opened with an Elvis song
tribute himself. We hope he becomes a regular addition to one of
L.A.'s most memorable nights. Long live the King!</LD>

<LD>Ken Burns did adults a favor with his two-part Mark Twain documentary
("Storytelling Stars in Twain Special," by Howard Rosenberg, Jan.
14). Most of us read Tom Sawyer or Huckleberry Finn at an early age.
To be truly appreciated, they and other Twain books should be reread
at an older age.</LD>
<LD>   The man was most unusual, ahead of his time in recognizing the
unequal treatment women and minorities endured. Burns did great
overviews in his "The Civil War" and "Baseball" multi-episode
documentaries. In the two Twain segments, Burns gave us depth of
character and insight into a great writer.</LD>

<DH>Musicians at first recoiled at writing about Sept. 11, but
with perspective and emotion, the words just started to flow.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANDY LEWIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For country singer-songwriter Alan Jackson, Sept. 11 provoked a song
with a flood of questions and no easy answers. Rocker Neil Young
looks at the attacks through the eyes of one of the United Airlines
Flight 93 passengers who tried to try to wrest control of the plane
from the hijackers.</LD>
<LD>   Singer-songwriter Loudon Wainwright III describes a sobering
subway ride from his home in Brooklyn Heights to Manhattan, John
Hiatt sees a city wounded but not defeated and Richard Thompson
denounces religious extremists who pervert the message of Islam with
acts of violence.</LD>
<LD>   In the first days and weeks after Sept. 11, a nationwide outburst
of patriotism was mirrored in the pop music world by reissues of
Whitney Houston's 1991 recording of "The Star Spangled Banner" and
Lee Greenwood's 1984 hit "God Bless the U.S.A."</LD>
<TE>   Now that the initial shock of the attacks on the World Trade
Center and the Pentagon has subsided, musicians have started
responding to the tragedy itself. The results, as varied as
individual responses to any event so monumental might be, display the
eloquence and reflection many predicted the pop music world would
embrace following Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "As is often the case, when anything happens, particularly
something big, I thought, 'Will I write a song about this?'" says
Wainwright, who has written dozens of songs about topical issues
during his 32-year recording career. "And my first thought was, 'No.
I wouldn't touch it. It's just too big.'"</TE>
<TE>   Several days after Sept. 11, however, he was on a train heading
home to New York from a trip to Washington, D.C., and quickly wrote
"No Sure Way," a haunting ballad with which he's been closing most of
his concerts since October.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Jackson was simply too stunned initially to consider
trying to write a song. But one night he had a bout of insomnia that
left him awake at 3 a.m. and thinking about Sept. 11. He says "Where
Were You (When the World Stopped Turning)" "just came flowing out."</TE>
<TE>   Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow?</TE>
<TE>   Go out and buy you a gun?</TE>
<TE>   Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watchin'</TE>
<TE>   And turn on "I Love Lucy" reruns?</TE>
<TE>   "I find I generally don't like songs where people express their
political views," the soft-spoken Georgia native says. "And this one
isn't political. It's still pretty simple. I felt like I was just
reporting, asking the kinds of questions anybody might ask."</TE>
<TE>   That universality is reflected in the public's response to the
song, which has logged five weeks atop Billboard's country singles
chart through radio play alone. The song hasn't been released as a
commercial single, but is on Jackson's album "Drive," which came out
earlier this week.</TE>
<TE>   Wainwright also found himself "reporting more than editorializing,
though the chorus has a kind of a heaven and hell thing going on. But
other than that, it's just a description of the journey.... A lot of
my songs are descriptions, so as unusual and horrible as this event
was, the actual writing didn't feel different."</TE>
<TE>   His references to four Manhattan subway stops gives his song added
resonance to New Yorkers:</TE>
<TE>   Chamber Street--a closed ghost station</TE>
<TE>   Passing through we seemed to glide</TE>
<TE>   Like prisoners inside compartments</TE>
<TE>   On some house of horrors ride</TE>
<TE>   "The horror--that was the emotion I was trying to get," says
Wainwright. "The scariness of it. That was unusual for me. Rarely
have I dealt with a topical issue that's been this much of a personal
issue."</TE>
<TE>   Hiatt, too, focuses on the mood in and around Manhattan in "New
York Had Her Heart Broke," which he's been singing at the end of his
concerts lately.</TE>
<TE>   And the daylight felt dark</TE>
<TE>   F-16s over Central Park</TE>
<TE>   When N.Y. had her heart broke</TE>
<TE>   Ah but she will rise ... again</TE>
<TE>   Most of the post-Sept. 11 songs have a serious tone, but writers
have found a multitude of angles from which to approach it.</TE>
<TE>   British singer-songwriter Thompson relies on his perspective as a
Muslim convert in "The Outside of the Inside," his response to the
Taliban's efforts to justify its actions in the name of Islam.</TE>
<TE>   I'm familiar with the cover</TE>
<TE>   I don't need to read the book</TE>
<TE>   I police the world of action</TE>
<TE>   Inside's where I never look</TE>
<TE>   Taliban officials, Thompson told Billboard recently, are "people
who are more interested in worshiping religion than worshiping God.
And so far as I'm concerned, it's inconceivable to practice a
religion and supposedly listen to one's inner voice and yet do the
disgusting things that the Taliban do to other people."</TE>
<TE>   Like his peers, Thompson avoided the subject altogether for a time
after Sept. 11, fearing that "whatever I produced would seem rather
trivial."</TE>
<TE>   Young won't even talk about "Let's Roll," saying through a
spokesman he'd rather let the song speak for itself.</TE>
<TE>   Young's label, Reprise Records, made copies for radio stations to
play, but hasn't issued it commercially. It's scheduled to be on
Young's new album, due in March.</TE>
<TE>   For Nashville veteran Ray Stevens, who has charted more than two
dozen singles-- mostly comedic numbers but also a few social
commentaries--since the early '60s, it was a humorous idea that
inspired him to weigh in with his latest comedy tune, "Osama Yo'
Mama."</TE>
<TE>   "Remember when the cast of 'Saturday Night Live' asked Mayor
[Rudolph] Giuliani, 'Is it OK? Can we be funny?' And of course his
answer was 'Why start now?'" Stevens says. "When he said that yes, we
need humor, that was my cue."</TE>
<TE>   Most musicians say at first they were hesitant to write a song at
all; then they were reluctant to go public with their works.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want it to look like I was trying to sell my career with
this [tragedy]," says Jackson. But the fact that the song came to him
so quickly convinced him it was worth doing, a sentiment most of his
peers echo.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know where it came from," Jackson says. "It's like one of
my favorite things Hank Williams said when he was asked about where
he got his songs. He said, 'I just hold the pen--God writes the
song.' That's how I feel about this one."</TE>

<LD>   Is the Boss' Music Headed for Broadway?</LD>
<LD>   The New York-based performing arts group Culture Project has
received tentative clearance from Bruce Springsteen to turn his songs
into a rock opera called "Drive All Night."</LD>
<TE>   According to E! Online News, the singer is expected to preview a
rough demo of the two-hour production in March. Each act of the
opera, conceived four years ago by artistic director Darrell Larson
and his partner, Stephanie Kerley-Schwartz, contains snippets from
some 29 songs by the Boss, including "Thunder Road" and "Atlantic
City." The story revolves around a working-class guy named Eddie.</TE>
<TE>   If the demo gets the go-ahead, Larson says, he'll work up a
full-stage version that he'll try out in "Springsteen country" and
then bring to New York.</TE>

<TE>   Adelphia Taking Heat Over Curtailed C-SPAN</TE>
<TE>   Disgruntled viewers have been calling Adelphi Communications to
complain about the cable company's decision to curtail the
programming of the C-SPAN channel.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia's move was motivated by a federal mandate to add local
broadcasters such as KAZA and KXLA to a limited broadband, a company
spokesman told The Times. That meant some channels were forced to
share. In many parts of Southern California, where the company serves
135 communities and 1.2 million customers, the channel that used to
air C-SPAN around the clock is now sharing with one offering TV
listings.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got to believe that it's a question of basic
incentives--C-SPAN doesn't generate revenue," said Silver Lake/Echo
Park resident William Pietz, who has organized a local chapter of
Citizens for C-SPAN. "But firms like Adelphia need to be reminded
that it's a question of public trust. C-SPAN is a precious
resource--crucial to informing citizens and to preserving what
remains of our public political culture."</TE>
<TE>   Lee Perron, Adelphia's regional vice president, says the company
is finalizing details with engineers and programmers about
reinstating C-SPAN in Southern California full-time within 45 days.
"We received many calls--a lot of them passionate--and understand the
commitment to C-SPAN," he said Friday. "Our company and others not
only appreciate it, but invest in its satellite time and production
costs. Without us, it wouldn't exist. Though C-SPAN doesn't generate
revenue, many customers subscribe, in part, because of it--and it's a
benefit our industry provides to the public."</TE>

<TE>   One 'Millionaire' Is Enough, Regis Says</TE>
<TE>   Regis has given his final answer on the syndicated version of "Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire"--and the answer is "no."</TE>
<TE>   "Regis has been offered the syndicated 'Millionaire' not once, but
twice, and has declined," his agent, Jim Griffin, told the New York
Post. "I won't go into specifics of the offer and why it didn't
compel him. Regis already has a full plate and it's not like he
needed another job. I'm sure he will be supportive of whoever they
choose."</TE>
<TE>   The syndicated show, due in the fall, will be shopped
around--without a host--at the National Assn. of Television Program
Executives convention in Las Vegas next week.</TE>

<TE>   Smithsonian Chief Rehnquist Under Fire</TE>
<TE>   A group of 170 scholars, authors and academics sent an open letter
this week to Supreme Court Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist,
chancellor of the board of regents of Washington's Smithsonian
Institution, charging that Lawrence Small, secretary of the museum,
was "unwilling or unable to carry out the mission of the Smithsonian,
or to safeguard its integrity."</TE>
<TE>   Small, they claimed, is allowing corporations and individuals too
much say in the content of exhibits they sponsor and letting them
place their logos on Smithsonian buildings, exhibition halls and
other spaces. The museum receives about 70% of its budget from the
federal government and must remain independent, critics say.</TE>
<TE>   The letter, reported in the Washington Post, originated with
Commercial Alert, a watchdog group devoted to keeping commercial
culture "within its proper sphere." Ralph Nader is chairman of the
advisory board.</TE>
<TE>   What prompted the letter was a $10-million gift from General
Motors for the General Motors Hall of Transportation at the Museum of
American History. Since Small's arrival in January 2000, Fuji has
given $7.8 million for an exhibit and Kmart had its corporate logo
emblazoned on a show devoted to African American music.</TE>
<TE>   Rehnquist could not be reached for comment but Small released a
statement. "The Smithsonian regents and staff control, without
limitation and question, the institution's activities," he said,
reiterating his commitment to "maintaining the integrity of the
Smithsonian and the public's trust."</TE>

<TE>   Ideas on Display for New York Renovation</TE>
<TE>   From interlocking, tubular towers to a building with holes already
built into it, about 50 architects and artists participated in "A New
World Trade Center: Design Proposals"--a private exhibit devoted to
rebuilding the decimated area. It opened Thursday at New York City's
Max Protetch Gallery.</TE>
<TE>   "They're visions for what Lower Manhattan should or could look
like," said Protetch, who conceived of the project shortly after the
Sept. 11 attack.</TE>
<TE>   None of the proposals visualized rebuilding the 110-story twin
towers. And while many of the projects had commemorative aspects,
only a few called for the entire 16 acres to be turned into a
memorial.</TE>
<TE>   Though the exhibit has no official connection to the city agencies
overseeing the reconstruction process, Protetch says, he hopes some
will visit.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of the reason to do this," he said, "was to hopefully try to
expand the process to include architects who otherwise might not be
considered."</TE>

<TE>   Porn 'Star Wars' No Threat, Judge Rules</TE>
<TE>   A federal court in San Francisco has refused to block the sale and
distribution of an X-rated, animated "Star Wars" spoof.</TE>
<TE>   Lucasfilm Ltd. sued Media Market Group Ltd., the New York
producers of "Starballz," for copyright and trademark infringement
last October, alleging that similarities between "Starballz" and
"Star Wars" could confuse consumers into thinking that Lucasfilm
sponsored or produced the X-rated movie that mocks the "Star Wars"
story line.</TE>
<TE>   The chance of confusion, the judge said, was slim to none.</TE>
<TE>   Lucasfilm spokeswoman Lynne Hale said she "respectfully disagrees"
with the decision.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a pornographic cartoon utilizing 'Star Wars' intellectual
property. We feel strongly that the law does not allow for parody to
be a defense to a pornographic use of someone else's intellectual
property."</TE>
<TE>   The company has not decided whether to appeal.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Afrobeat, a danceable blend of James Brown-influenced funk,
traditional African styles, jazz and soul, is usually credited to the
late, iconic Nigerian bandleader Fela Kuti. But the architect of that
'60s-born style was actually Kuti's longtime drummer and musical
director, Tony Allen, whose own new group, Psyco on Da Bus, offered
an updated twist on that sound at the Knitting Factory Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Rather than a full-tilt, sweat-till-you-drop fest, the 61-year-old
Allen, sampler and turntablist Doctor L (a.k.a. Liam Farrell),
bassist Cesar Anot and keyboardist Jean-Phi Dary crafted
journey-to-inner-space grooves that amounted to a head trip for your
body.</LD>
<LD>   The band formed a tight group on stage, allowing the players to
easily cue off Allen throughout the 90-minute set. This configuration
also reflected the introverted nature of the percussive tunes, which
ranged from celebratory to pensive. They bore heavier jazz and dub
flavors than Kuti's work, but often were just as sprawling and
hypnotic.</LD>
<TE>   Thanks to Doctor L, a solo artist and producer in his own right,
the music had a techno-delic intensity while also incorporating more
genteel electronica styles such as trip-hop and ambient groove.
Indeed, although such selections from the group's self-titled 2001
debut as "Afropusherman" did at times evoke Kuti in their
straight-ahead polyrhythmic funkiness, the insular vibe of it all
wouldn't have been out of place at a rave.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the show had the feeling of live mixology, like a DJ set
with instruments.</TE>

<HD>Finns' Composition for PC, Opus 1</HD>
<DH>Music: British duo has found a receptive audience for their
software, now on display in Anaheim.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS PASLES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Whether using quill tips or felt tips, composers have spent enormous
amounts of their time over the centuries simply inking out their
music on manuscript paper.</LD>
<LD>   To the rescue come several software programs, including
"Sibelius," created by British twins Ben and Jonathan Finn, 33. Ben
Finn is in town this weekend at the International Music Products
Assn. (NAMM) tradeshow at the Anaheim Convention Center. They named
their program after another "Finn," Finnish composer Jean Sibelius.</LD>
<LD>   Once choristers in Kings College, Cambridge, the two were studying
music in high school and teaching themselves computer programming on
the side when they decided to put the two subjects together.</LD>
<TE>   For fun, they created some homework-helping programs, like one to
harmonize Bach chorales. That prompted the idea of creating a music
notation program that would help musicians much like a word
processing program assists writers.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought it would take about a year or two to develop," Ben
Finn said in a recent phone interview from Cambridge, England. "It
took five years before we got it finished or releasable.</TE>
<TE>   "In fact, when we realized the complexities of notation, we almost
gave up. And we knew nothing about the music engraving aspect,
publishers' rules positioning notes and things like that. We had to
do a lot of research."</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, they spent a lot of time planning. "You can paint
yourself into a corner easy," Finn said. "You can do the easy stuff,
then find a difficult problem and have to go back and redo
everything."</TE>
<TE>   Initially, the two worked together, but then they specialized.
Jonathan became the programmer and Ben shifted interest to the
business side.</TE>
<TE>   He had to. They couldn't interest anyone in selling their program,
so they set up their own company, the Sibelius Group, in 1993,
packaging the program with a computer, printer and keyboard.</TE>
<TE>   "It cost several thousand dollars, but people wanted to buy it. It
saves so much time. They could see that straightaway. They could use
it to write from scratch or produce a final copy or extract
orchestral parts. It transposed automatically. It was saving maybe
50% of their time."</TE>
<TE>   Within two years it became the industry standard in Britain. "It
was used by all the main publishers. It was a big shock and surprise
to us. We were really operating out of my living room."</TE>
<TE>   They created a Windows version in 1998 and a Mac version in 1999.
"As soon as we did, that gave us a worldwide market instead of just a
UK market. In the last three years, we've been very involved
worldwide."</TE>
<TE>   Their main competition is a program called Finale, with which the
twins have been going head to head ever since. Users are mostly
classical and jazz musicians "because they use notation more than
rock and pop. But it is used by rock and pop publishers who are
producing guitar books and things like that."Sibelius will even
automatically transcribe music played on a keyboard connected to a
computer. But the brothers don't suggest their program will
substitute for musical creativity. "I doubt computers will replace
humans," Finn said. "They can assist a bit."</TE>
<TE>   Details and a downloadable demo version can be found on the
company's Web site: Sibelius.com.</TE>

<TE>   "My goal is to make chamber music something very accessible to the
community," Palchak said recently. "It's to feature the world-class
performers that we have here in Southern California. There's no
shortage of them."</TE>
<TE>   The series was funded by a $15,000 seed grant from the city of
Irvine, a $500 grant from Mervyn's in Irvine and support from Irvine
Valley College, one of the two colleges at which Palchak teaches (the
other is Saddleback College in Mission Viejo).</TE>
<TE>   "Irvine Mayor Larry Agran agreed to fund the first season with the
stipulation that the concerts be free and that we perform in the City
Council chambers, which turns out to be a wonderful setting for
chamber music," Palchak said.</TE>
<TE>   The first concert, a Bach program on Nov. 4, filled the chambers
to "the legal capacity," Palchak said. The official tally: 270.</TE>
<TE>   The second concert will be Jan. 27 and will feature Palchak,
harpist Eleanor Choate, violist Andrew Duckles and soprano Kelly
Boudreux in music by Debussy, Gershwin and other composers. A third
program is planned March 10.</TE>
<TE>   California Concert Artists will play works by Debussy, Gershwin
and other composers Jan. 27 at 4 p.m. at Irvine City Hall, 1 Civic
Center Plaza, Irvine. Free. (949) 451-5488.</TE>

<HD>Kozyrev Details the Open Road at Hurtling Speed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PAGEL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Born in St. Petersburg, Russia, and educated in Athens, Ohio, and
Santa Barbara (where he now lives), Dimitri Kozyrev is an artist
whose first solo show in Los Angeles consists of a series of great
American road paintings. Although road movies are a staple of the
film industry, road paintings are an art history anomaly, probably
because images of highways and back roads are ordinarily thought of
as landscapes.</LD>
<LD>   At Cirrus Gallery, Kozyrev's mid- to large-size paintings avoid
this designation because they faithfully re-create the experience of
hurtling through the landscape in a vehicle powerful enough to make
the legal speed limit seem like an unjust restriction of personal
liberty. To stand before one of his canvases is to feel the tug of
the open road, a sensation of expansiveness that makes you breathe
deeply when you break out of traffic, leaving the congested city
streets to shrink in your rearview mirror.</LD>
<LD>   Kozyrev engineers this effect by painting, with the precision of a
miniaturist, extremely detailed images of trees, telephone poles,
billboards and street lights on the horizon lines at the centers of
otherwise fairly empty canvases.</LD>
<TE>   Like the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, however, these
places are elusive. As you move in for a close-up, they stop obeying
the laws of one-point perspective. What had seemed to be a coherent
image disintegrates into an array of disjointed planes, disconnected
lines, illegible gestures and random dollops of color and texture.</TE>
<TE>   As a painter, Kozyrev is a master of hit-and-run illusionism. His
ever-receding cities are Cubist collisions filtered through Adam
Ross' futuristic paintings of virtual worlds. Rather than depict the
roadside in all its gritty materiality, Kozyrev gives physical form
to the psychological state triggered by driving, whether along the
interstate or on any old county trunk.</TE>
<TE>   There's something profoundly optimistic about getting out of town
and heading off on an adventure, especially one without a specific
destination in mind. That's precisely where Kozyrev's art takes
viewers: both deeper into your own thoughts and farther out into the
world.</TE>

<HD>Long Live the King, and His Impersonators</HD>
<DH>Music: Who's the most Elvis of them all? A big Midwest
competition brings out devout Presley fans and the look-alikes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTI PARSONS</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL>SPRINGFIELD, Ill.</DL>
<LD>At one point during his peanut-butter-and-bacon-sandwich years,
Elvis, while onstage, lunged into a dip so precipitous that he nearly
didn't make it back up.</LD>
<LD>   Halfway down and wobbling his way through "Suspicious Minds," the
King managed to turn the whole thing into a joke.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm caught in a trap," he sang, "and I can't get up. I hope these
pants don't tear up, baby."</LD>
<TE>   Spontaneous or not, it was funny back then. And decades later, it
still slays audiences like the crowd at last weekend's sold-out
Midwest Elvis Presley Impersonator Competition at the Springfield
Hilton.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, yeah, people like that one," Johnny Harra Jr. says sagely. A
14-year veteran of the Elvis circuit, Harra nods as women in the
front rows shower roses on the fellow contestant serving up the
vintage bit.</TE>
<TE>   Harra is in street clothes, but his pompadour, long sideburns and
permanent lip curl would stamp him as an Elvis impersonator anywhere,
even if you saw him walking in the mall. He seems to admire a side of
Elvis Presley that has eluded public attention all these years--his
work ethic. Says Harra, "When Elvis walked out on stage, he gave the
audience 110%. That's what that was."</TE>
<TE>   Elvis' moves seem to possess a weapons-grade charisma that can be
passed on full-strength to imitators. The women don't just throw
roses. They dance. They undo their blouses. They buy scarves in the
hopes that one of the 20 Elvis replicas performing one after the
other will sweat on them and throw them back. Some of them even hang
around the exit doors in, well, groups.</TE>
<TE>   No wonder some 50-year-old man who fills out "The Eagle" suit in
the historically correct dimensions might spend hundreds of dollars
on clothing and travel across the country for a weekend here. If the
$3,500 in prize money wasn't enough of an incentive, the Sideburn
Chasers might be.</TE>
<TE>   And that raises the profound question of why--nearly a quarter of
a century after Elvis Presley died--people still show up by the
hundreds to see knockoffs of His Greatness sing rather than lip-sync
the Elvis oeuvre? More than 1,500 people attended this particular
event over the two nights, and they spent as much as $22.50 each for
good seats in the hotel's ballroom. There's enough of an industry to
support dozens of other contests around the country and a coterie of
managers--would-be Col. Tom Parkers who claim there are no fewer than
35,000 Elvis impersonators available for booking.</TE>
<TE>   John Lennon and the boys from Liverpool were a phenomenon, but
although a certain number of Beatles imitators are out there, you
don't have hundreds of guys in Sgt. Pepper jackets mimicking them
onstage. Frank Sinatra was a heartthrob but, a copycat or two aside,
he has hardly inspired a cottage industry. Ever seen a Barbra
Streisand look-alike outside a drag show? Judy Garland? Diana Ross?</TE>
<TE>   "A drag show? What are you talking about?" asks an offended
Bradley Scott, a young-looking Old Elvis, sporting his fair share of
makeup and a very bright blue flamboyant suit. "We're not out here
dressing up like women."</TE>
<TE>   From Scott's point of view, being an impersonator, or "tribute
artist," is about time travel. Elvis was there at the dawn of rock
'n' roll--Lennon himself once said, "Before Elvis, there was
nothing"--so his evocation takes more people back to their youth than
anyone else could, he thinks.</TE>
<TE>   Elvis had a "pingpong thing" going between him and his audience,
Scott says, and, every once in a while, on a good night, Scott feels
like he's playing the same game.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a way for people to reminisce," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe so. But that doesn't explain how Nance Fox got into Elvis.</TE>
<TE>   Watching the show from a seat just outside the ballroom, where she
can listen while plucking cigarettes from a leather holder, she
shakes her head no. She appreciated Elvis as a young woman, she says,
but wasn't "a slobbering fan, by any means."</TE>
<TE>   "Nah, that's not it," she says. "It happened later, when my son
wanted an Elvis impersonator at his wedding reception. I said, 'I
don't want some fat guy waddling in here in a jumpsuit.'"</TE>
<TE>   But her son got his request, and Fox got an earful of channeled
Elvis.</TE>
<TE>   "Almost without exception, his songs were emotional," about grief,
love and his mama, she says. "And Elvis sang them emotionally.... If
your husband isn't romantic, if your job isn't fulfilling, Elvis
understands."</TE>
<TE>   And don't forget his "before-the-time sexual movements," she adds.
"He was the first one who made it OK to show you were sexually moved
by someone. People will still pay to see that."</TE>
<TE>   Fox should know. A former Realtor, she got into the King so much
that she now markets 97 Elvis artists to contests and shows all over
the world.</TE>
<TE>   And she's right--an Elvis convention is dripping with sex. You've
got your Young Elvises swiveling with agility, and your Old Elvises
making a pretty good showing with the deep-knee lunges. For those of
another gender orientation, there's always a "scarf girl" onstage
keeping the performers draped with a steady supply of neckwear.</TE>
<TE>   There was even a female Elvis at the annual weekend convention, a
slender woman with jet-black hair, a giant feather trailing down her
back and tremendous crowd appeal. So maybe part of the appeal is its
campy drag-show effect?</TE>
<TE>   "The whole T-V thing, I wonder if most of these people would even
get it," says Chad Smith, a geek-chic 29-year-old band member who has
driven from Chicago's Humboldt Park neighborhood with his girlfriend
for the show. "They'd see a transvestite walking down the street, and
they'd say, 'That is a [messed]-up person.' But here, they're all
right with it."</TE>
<TE>   Onstage at the moment is Jamie Aaron Kelley, a 20-year-old so good
as the Young Elvis that he is appearing not as a contestant but as a
performer. A veteran Elvis--his Presley-struck parents got him into
it when he was 4--he holds a record, his promotional material says,
for being "the first person in history to memorize every song that
Elvis ever recorded in his career."</TE>
<TE>   He makes one group of teenage girls scream like it's 1962 and they
just saw the real thing. And it's not his fantastic memory they're
talking about later.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always thought he was dreamy," says Melissa Volkert, 14.
She's talking about Jamie, not Elvis.</TE>
<TE>   "My friends don't think he's cute, but I do," says Alicia
Fehrholz, 16. She's talking about Elvis, not Jamie.</TE>
<TE>   Either way, it doesn't impress the coat-check girl, about the only
person in the place who hasn't paid to witness the spectacle.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, my goodness," she says, as another swell of screams rises up.
"Do these people think this is Elvis?"</TE>
<TE>   Of course not, says a passing tribute artist.</TE>
<TE>   "But we are the closest thing to Elvis they'll ever see."</TE>

<HD>Nick's Saturday Night: Something New</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SACHS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nickelodeon's Saturday night lineup for 2002 gets off to a
rambunctious start tonight with a slew of new and retooled shows.</LD>
<LD>   First, some clarification is in order: Yes, this is Nick, and yes,
we're talking about evening programming. But fans of the channel's
Nick at Night roster, home to such classic comedies as "All in the
Family" and "Cheers," may be in for a crude awakening if they tune in
too early on Saturday nights. That's crude as in food fights and zit
jokes, not the Farrelly brothers.</LD>
<LD>   But one of the new offerings, "The Nick Cannon Show" (9:30 p.m.),
is a pleasant surprise for, as the saying goes, kids of all ages.</LD>
<TE>   The 21-year-old comedian has been a familiar figure on Nick in
spot roles, but he's calling all the shots here. Cannon is the star
and executive producer of this imaginatively amusing effort in which
he plops down in a suburban household and wreaks amiable havoc with
the real-life people within his orbit. Hip-hop stars Lil' Romeo and
Master P perform in a fun backyard-barbecue finale, and Eddie Murphy,
Britney Spears and other guests will be on hand later in the season.</TE>
<TE>   The other anchor of the evening's programming is "All That," which
has assembled a new cast of energetic adolescents for its seventh
season (8 p.m.). As always, the players come from the "When in Doubt,
Shout" school of comedy, but I'm pretty sure I'm well off the chart
of the target demographic.</TE>
<TE>   The show, Nickelodeon's longest-running live-action series, has a
celebrity-host format this season, with Frankie Muniz ("Malcolm in
the Middle") drawing the first slot. Recording star Aaron Carter, the
younger brother of the Backstreet Boys' Nick Carter, provides a
musical boost.</TE>

<HD>The Way He Tells It</HD>
<DH>Larger-than-life Hollywood producer Robert Evans narrates a
new film documentary about his turbulent life and career.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT W. WELKOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARK CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>Legendary movie producer Robert Evans, dressed smartly in a camel's
hair overcoat and beige turtleneck, saunters into a Main Street
restaurant for a round of media interviews for a new film about his
remarkable life in Hollywood called "The Kid Stays in the Picture,"
which was to premiere here Friday night at the Sundance Film
Festival.</LD>
<LD>   He is now 71, four years removed from a paralyzing stroke that
struck with typical Evans flair while he was delivering a toast to
horror-meister Wes Craven. Evans said the incident nearly scared
Craven to death.</LD>
<LD>   He is now all but recovered, but stroke or no stroke, Evans on
this day said the trip to Sundance had invigorated him.</LD>
<TE>   A Hollywood rebel throughout his 40-odd years in show business, he
has come to this snowy citadel of independent films not only to
promote the new movie made by documentary filmmakers Brett Morgen and
Nanette Burstein but also to show young, up-and-coming filmmakers
that if he can make it back, then anything is possible.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been knocked down for the count; I was cold as dry ice," he
said in that distinctive baritone voice that Vanity Fair editor
Graydon Carter once described as sounding like oil rolling in a
barrel. "I couldn't get a job anywhere. If I can do it at my age,
they can do it at their age. Don't be afraid of getting knocked down.</TE>
<TE>   "This is exciting for me," he said of Sundance. "In a way, for
better or worse, I have more in kin with the independent films. I
don't call them independent. I call them people making movies on
their own."</TE>
<TE>   As chief of production at Paramount Pictures in the Hollywood
glory days of the late 1960s and early 1970s, before multinational
conglomerates absorbed the studios and "event" movies became the
norm, Evans went almost overnight from being an actor to becoming a
studio chief, greenlighting such memorable movies as "Rosemary's
Baby," "Love Story," "Harold and Maude," "True Grit," "Serpico" and
the Academy Award-winning film "The Godfather" and its electrifying
sequel "The Godfather Part II."</TE>
<TE>   Later, as a producer, he would go on to make "Chinatown,"
"Marathon Man" and "Urban Cowboy," to name a few. And then the bottom
dropped out.</TE>
<TE>   He became a Hollywood pariah when he was busted for cocaine
possession and later was linked, but never indicted, with the "Cotton
Club" murder case.</TE>
<TE>   It is all vividly captured in "The Kid Stays in the Picture,"
which itself is based on Evans' cathartic 1994 autobiography of the
same name.</TE>
<TE>   As he sits down for an interview, sipping a ginger ale, Evans
still retains the look of an aging movie star: the carefully coiffed
but now graying hair; the unnaturally tanned skin; the distinctive
eyewear that harks back to his studio reign when he wore the
then-mod-looking, oversize frames a la Michael Caine.</TE>
<TE>   Evans acknowledges that he owns about 100 pairs of eyeglasses,
including several pairs he removes from his pockets. He then
introduces Alan Selka, "my right-hand man," a tall, slender man with
a British accent who fishes around in his own pockets and comes up
with several more pairs.</TE>
<TE>   Evans said he did not initially want to participate in the
documentary about his life. The book was a success, and its audio
version, featuring Evans with his signature voice, became an instant
cult classic in Hollywood. So, he thought, why press his luck?</TE>
<TE>   "I've rolled two sevens so far, and I hope I don't crap out," he
said of the film.</TE>
<TE>   The 90-minute documentary features Evans narrating off screen,
appearing only briefly on camera as he is today. Much of the film
consists of photographs and films that he burrowed away like a pack
rat over the years.</TE>
<TE>   Morgen and Burstein say no one in Hollywood today is the equal of
Evans at the height of his powers.</TE>
<TE>   "Bob was a link between the studio system and today's corporate
conglomerates," Morgen said. "That specific time in Hollywood was the
Wild West."</TE>
<TE>   The filmmakers said they went into the project trying hard to
avoid being seduced by Evans' enormous charm and personality. But
seduce them he did, nonetheless. "We saw it, we knew it, and we loved
it," Morgen said, describing their film as not so much documentary as
"cinema mythologica."</TE>
<TE>   The filmmakers said they were helped in their efforts because of
Evans' enormous archive of materials. He had a camera to record his
activities wherever he went.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time he would go to any set of any movie at Paramount, he
had a still photographer go with him," Burstein said.</TE>
<TE>   Does that mean he is vain?</TE>
<TE>   "You know what it is?" Burstein said. "Bob is a master at
presenting himself to the press and to the world.... Bob understands
the power of his image."</TE>
<TE>   But one who lives by publicity can also be destroyed by publicity,
and when it became known in the 1980s that he was linked through a
business partner to the notorious "Cotton Club" murder case, the
press had a field day. (The case involved the 1983 slaying of New
York impresario Roy Radin, who was involved in the filming of "The
Cotton Club.") Evans would escape indictment, but the media would
link him to the case for years.</TE>
<TE>   "So, it worked for him," Morgen said, "and then it turned on him."</TE>
<TE>   The film includes some never-before-seen footage Evans has kept to
himself over the years. It includes actor Dustin Hoffman doing a
biting impersonation of Evans on the set of "The Marathon Man" and a
film, shot by a young Mike Nichols, in which Evans personally
addresses the board of directors of Gulf &amp; Western, which then owned
Paramount, and persuaded them not to deep-six the studio because he
had a slate of good films coming up, including one called "The
Godfather."</TE>
<TE>   Evans said he turned over "my whole life" to Morgen and Burstein.
"They know more about me than my family ever knew, for certain," he
said. "They have things I didn't want them to find."</TE>
<TE>   The filmmakers said that the movie almost didn't get made. They
recalled that just before going to the Academy Awards, where they
were nominated for their 1999 documentary "On the Ropes," they
learned that Evans had years earlier given all film rights to his
book to Vanity Fair's Carter. The parties eventually worked things
out, and Carter became a producer on the movie.</TE>
<TE>   USA Films plans to release the film either in late spring or early
summer.</TE>
<TE>   One could hardly think of a more colorful subject for a
documentary than Evans. His life reads like part fairy tale and part
tabloid expose.</TE>
<TE>   Born Robert J. Shapera in New York City, his father was a dentist
who ran the first racially integrated dental clinic in America,
according to the film. When he was 12, his father changed the family
surname to Evans as a tribute to his dying mother, whose maiden name
was Evan. Robert caught the acting bug and did radio work in World
War II, becoming the youngest disc jockey in the nation. Older
brother Charles co-founded a clothing line that would become
Evan-Picone, making him a millionaire before his 25th birthday.</TE>
<TE>   Evans was discovered by actress Norma Shearer in the mid-1950s
when he jumped into a swimming pool at the Beverly Hills Hotel. She
picked the handsome young man to play her late husband, studio mogul
Irving Thalberg, in the 1957 movie "Man of a Thousand Faces," about
the life of Lon Chaney Sr.</TE>
<TE>   Four months later in a totally unrelated incident, Evans happened
to be dancing the tango at the El Morocco in New York when he was
told that 20th Century Fox studio chief Darryl F. Zanuck was sitting
in the corner of the nightclub and wanted to meet him.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was a joke," Evans said. "I walk over to him and he
says, 'Are you an actor, kid?' I said, 'No, but I just finished
making a picture.' He said, 'I want you to play opposite Ava Gardner
[as a young bullfighter] in 'The Sun Also Rises.'"</TE>
<TE>   With his chiseled good looks, Evans romanced a veritable Who's Who
of Hollywood leading ladies over the ensuing years, including
Gardner, Lana Turner, Grace Kelly, Ali MacGraw, Raquel Welch and
Margaux Hemingway.</TE>
<TE>   Evans keeps busy. This March, he has a movie going into production
called "How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," starring Kate Hudson. He also
has a project that does a twist on the Dorian Gray story featuring a
woman in the title role. "The highest point in my life, maybe, is
now," Evans said. "Here I am at my age being up here with all these
young filmmakers, talking to them, hearing their aspirations, what
they are trying to accomplish, and I don't feel like an old man
sitting here. The things I've done maybe I can spread around to
others. There is no higher feeling than that."</TE>

<LD>Ever since he got here, I've been praying for the Dodgers to trade
Gary Sheffield for a rosin bag and a bucket of balls.</LD>
<LD>   Looks like I got my wish.</LD>
<LD>   Eric Monson</LD>
<TE>   Temecula</TE>

<TE>   I envy Montreal and Minnesota fans. At least they're being told
their teams might be dissolved. Here in L.A., the dissolution of the
Dodgers has been a quiet four-year process beginning the moment
Rupert Murdoch bought the team.</TE>
<TE>   Snyder Sims</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Today the Dodgers made what is perhaps the stupidest trade in the
team's long history. They traded one extremely talented malcontent
for one not-so-talented malcontent and a pitcher who throws well one
out of every five games.</TE>
<TE>   No doubt, there is laughter and dancing in the streets of Atlanta.
It's quite obvious the Dodgers are merely dropping payroll to sell,
and choosing not to admit it to the fans. My question is, do the fans
still have to show up? My guess is, no, we don't.</TE>
<TE>   Erez Borowski</TE>
<TE>   Montrose</TE>

<TE>   A million thanks to the Los Angeles Times for revealing to the
public the Dodgers' malcontent in their clubhouse. It's Bill
Plaschke! Trade him!</TE>

<TE>   And so, the latest Battle of the Stupids has been fought.</TE>
<TE>   In the first battle, it was Kevin Malone vs. Chase Carey, with
Malone barely edging out the Fox executive. Then, it was Malone vs.
Dan Evans. Malone gave it all he had and seemed clearly to be the
most stupid, but Evans had a secret weapon: He could trade the best
right-handed hitter in the game and get virtually nothing in return.</TE>
<TE>   So, Evans is the new champion in the Battle of the Stupids. And
Dodger fans are, once again, the losers.</TE>

<TE>   On hearing of his trade to the Dodgers, Brian Jordan said, "Life's
a bummer."</TE>
<TE>   Here is a man who has been blessed with the talent to play a game
for a living. He's in the fourth year of a $40-million contract. And
he has a $10.5-million option after that.</TE>
<TE>   You know whom I think life is a bummer for? The thousands of
people whose lives were taken away or forever changed on 9-11. With
unemployment at an all-time high, life's a bummer for the men and
women who have mouths to feed but can't find a decent job.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, I don't think there's a person on earth who wouldn't
happily trade their current situation with Brian Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   Oh wait, I guess I can think of one.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Hauck</TE>
<TE>   Studio City</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A solid, albeit somewhat injury-prone veteran outfielder with
offensive and defensive talent as well as huge postseason experience,
plus an enthusiastic, up-and-coming pitcher in exchange for the
biggest pain to ever wear the Dodger uniform? I'll take this trade.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Smith</TE>
<TE>   San Gabriel</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What a great trade! I applaud Dan Evans on his keen baseball
acumen, and can't wait for the 2002 season to begin. Thanks again,
Dan!</TE>

<TE>   Entering this off-season, the Dodgers needed a shortstop, center
fielder and closer. So they trade for a Phillie starter two years
removed from a 19-loss season. Then they trade a talented, young
starter [Luke Prokopec] for a 33-year-old middle reliever. Then they
deal Sheffield, his miserable attitude and 100-plus annual RBIs for a
chronically injured left fielder who'll be 35 next season, and an
unproven pitcher who recently had Tommy John surgery.</TE>
<TE>   As of now, the Dodgers enter this preseason needing a shortstop,
center fielder and closer. And a general manager?</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Green</TE>

<TE>   I was disappointed to find that your editors had chosen to publish
the letter written by Mr. Gagliano [Jan. 12] about the anticipated
signing of Kazuhisa Ishii and signing of Hideo Nomo. I wonder if Joe
DiMaggio and Phil Rizzuto had to listen to similar comments regarding
"Spaghetti Night" at Yankee Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   The Japanese players have won three rookie-of-the-year awards as
well as Ichiro's MVP, so I think their skills and work ethic speak
for themselves. Please accord the same respect to the Asian American
community that you would to other athletes of color, and reconsider
printing such garbage in the future.</TE>

<HD>Agents, SAG Still  Apart on New Pact</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: Actors oppose major changes in 63-year-old
'master franchise agreement,' which agents say is outdated, onerous.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES BATES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Prospects remained bleak that agents and actors will reach a new
agreement between the two groups before the current one expires at
midnight Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Representatives of the Screen Actors Guild and agents--represented
by the Assn. of Talent Agents and the National Assn. of Talent
Representatives--continued talking Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Neither side would comment, but sources said no new agreement is
expected this weekend.</LD>
<TE>   At stake is a "master franchise agreement" forged in 1939 with the
aim of protecting actors from being exploited.</TE>
<TE>   If the agreement expires, agents theoretically would be unshackled
from the 63-year-old agreement and would be free to sell their
agencies to any buyer, forge pacts with producers and raise
commissions.</TE>
<TE>   But sources said the talent agencies have no plans to do anything
drastic, and are willing to continue negotiating with SAG if it
appears progress is being made.</TE>
<TE>   As a good-faith gesture to clients, agents also plan to adopt a
voluntary code of conduct to assure clients they will continue to
operate without conflicts.</TE>
<TE>   The current agreement, which agents must abide by to represent SAG
actors, has several regulations including strict conflict-of-interest
provisions to make sure agents don't become producers and studios
don't end up owning the same agencies they negotiate with for the
services of an actor or director.</TE>
<TE>   Agents have pushed to loosen the agreement for more than two
years, arguing that the rules are outdated and onerous. They say the
rules prevent them from attracting much-needed capital from companies
that have only a marginal interest in production such as advertising
agencies.</TE>
<TE>   They also argue that revisions are needed so they can compete with
talent managers, whose unregulated status, they say, is an unfair
competitive advantage.</TE>
<TE>   In theory, agents legally are allowed to procure work for actors,
while managers serve more like advisors and are not supposed to line
up work.</TE>
<TE>   Actors say loosening the rules could open the door to numerous
conflict-of-interest scenarios.</TE>
<TE>   The two sides were on the verge of reaching an agreement in early
2000, but the Screen Actors Guild nixed the deal, saying it wasn't in
the best interest of actors.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, the two sides sat down for the first time in
more than a year.</TE>
<TE>   SAG had delayed meeting, in part because of its contract
negotiations last year and because its leadership remains in flux.</TE>

<HD>AOL in Talks to Buy Red Hat</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEC KLEIN</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>AOL Time Warner Inc. is in talks to buy Red Hat Inc., a prominent
distributor of the Linux computer operating system, according to
sources familiar with the matter.</LD>
<LD>   The negotiations--which are still fluid--are the latest indication
that AOL Time Warner, the world's largest media company, is looking
for alternatives to software made by Microsoft Corp., whose Windows
operating system runs 90% of the world's PCs.</LD>
<LD>   The longtime competitors have fought over rival consumer
technologies lately, including online subscription services,
instant-messaging systems and Web-based video and audio players.</LD>
<TE>   Officials of AOL, Red Hat and Microsoft declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Durham, N.C.-based Red Hat sells products and services based on
the Linux operating system, the freely available software developed
collaboratively by volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   To counter Microsoft's desktop hegemony, New York-based AOL Time
Warner could use the deal to couple its America Online software, the
market leader with more than 33 million Internet subscribers, with
Red Hat's operating-system technology, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   The AOL online software, which consumers can install for free from
the Web or a compact disc, is designed to run on Microsoft's Windows
operating system.</TE>
<TE>   But the AOL software could be configured to override Windows and
launch a version of Red Hat's Linux operating system, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear Friday what price tag Red Hat could fetch. The
company has a market capitalization of about $1.45 billion and
employs about 600 people.</TE>
<TE>   News of the talks came after the markets closed. Red Hat shares
closed off 14 cents at $8.41 on Nasdaq. AOL Time Warner fell 46 cents
to $29.58 on the Big Board.</TE>

<HD>Investors Want Idealab Liquidated</HD>
<DH>Internet: Lawsuit against the Pasadena company's founder
claims Bill Gross mismanaged the incubator. The plaintiffs want the
$500 million that remains.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN KAPLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A group of blue-chip investors who poured nearly $1 billion into the
once-highflying Internet pioneer Idealab Inc. filed a lawsuit Friday
demanding that founder Bill Gross liquidate the company and return
the $500 million that's left.</LD>
<LD>   The suit alleges that Gross, Idealab's chief executive, and his
fiancee, company President Marcia Goodstein, badly mismanaged the
company and have kept the enterprise alive simply to preserve their
sumptuous lifestyle.</LD>
<LD>   "In just two years, the defendants burned through more than $500
million," the lawsuit says. "Idealab's 'incubator' business, for all
practical purposes, is nonexistent, and in fact, other 'incubators'
are winding down, dissolving and refunding investor money."</LD>
<TE>   Gross responded to the suit, saying it is "completely and totally
baseless."</TE>
<TE>   "It's just embarrassing that these people are so immature and
crybaby that they want to take an investment that they made and carry
it out this way," he said after reading the allegations. "There's a
market downturn, but Idealab as a company is doing great."</TE>
<TE>   The filing of the lawsuit late Friday in Los Angeles Superior
Court marks a grim milestone in the rise and fall of one of the most
luminous stars of the so-called new economy.</TE>
<TE>   With Pasadena-based Idealab, Gross invented the concept of an
Internet "incubator" that turned inspirations into corporations in as
little as three months. His strategy was widely copied as
entrepreneurs and investors looked to cash in on the dot-com craze.</TE>
<TE>   But the tech meltdown of the last two years has left 6-year-old
Idealab a shadow of its former self.</TE>
<TE>   Its most famous fledgling, online toy retailer EToys Inc., was
once worth more than Toys R Us but shut down last year after burning
through millions of dollars. Dozens of lesser-known firms also have
been shuttered.</TE>
<TE>   Idealab's Web site lists 26 active companies, only one of which
has been a big hit. Overture Services Inc., a pay-for-placement
Internet search engine, has a market capitalization of $2.2 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The investors suing Idealab--including Dell USA, T. Rowe Price
Science &amp; Technology fund and Moore Global Investments Ltd.--say
there is little for the incubator to do and it could easily operate
on a $1-million annual budget. Instead, Idealab maintains offices in
Pasadena, Silicon Valley, Boston and London and recently doubled the
salaries of Gross and Goodstein.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit has opened a can of worms, alleging a series of
unseemly practices that occurred behind closed doors at the privately
held company.</TE>
<TE>   It accuses Gross and his associates of using Idealab's resources
to fund stock repurchases at inflated prices and collateralize
personal loans, instead of looking out for the company's investors.
The plaintiffs said Idealab executives refused to hold shareholder
meetings or provide access to the company's financial records, in
violation of California law.</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiffs claim Gross has refused to liquidate Idealab
because he is $40 million in debt and has a $50-million loan "he
cannot possibly repay" without "accessing the assets of Idealab." The
suit also says six other executives and directors have borrowed a
total of nearly $4.5 million from the company.</TE>
<TE>   Gross said he borrowed $40 million from Bank of America so he
could plow it back into the company, not spend it on personal items.</TE>
<TE>   "I invested in Idealab on the same terms as they did," Gross said.
"That money is in Idealab alongside theirs."</TE>
<TE>   The plaintiffs, including mutual funds and individuals, were the
last major investors in Idealab. They put up $1 billion for a 10%
share of the incubator, giving it a total valuation of $10 billion.
The investment came in March 2000, just weeks before the dot-com
bubble burst. Some of Idealab's best-known start-ups began folding
soon after.</TE>
<TE>   Idealab and the plaintiffs have spent months trying to negotiate a
deal that would allow the investors to recoup at least part of their
massive cash influx. But the investors said Gross offered only 10
cents on the dollar. If Idealab were forced to divest its cash and
liquidate assets, the investors could get 50 cents on the dollar,
according to the suit.</TE>
<TE>   The investors will probably seek an injunction to prevent Gross
and other executives from frittering away Idealab's remaining assets,
said their attorney, Skip Miller, a partner with the Los Angeles firm
Christensen, Miller.</TE>
<TE>   They are seeking at least $500million in damages in addition to
recovering the $500million remaining from their original investment.</TE>
<TE>   Idealab President Goodstein said the suit came as a surprise.</TE>
<TE>   She said the company had little contact with its investors and
there were no signs they were considering legal action.</TE>
<TE>   "We're scratching our heads," she said.</TE>

<HD>House Panel to Probe ImClone Systems</HD>
<DH>Biotech: Firm may have provided investors inaccurate data
about cancer drug.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE GELLENE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A congressional committee launched an investigation Friday into a
small biotechnology company accused of misleading investors about a
highly touted cancer drug.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter to ImClone Systems Inc., Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin
(R-La.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee,
expressed "serious concerns" about the accuracy of information the
highflying company shared with investors about its experimental
cancer drug.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of ImClone Systems have lost 65% of their value since Dec.
28, when the Food and Drug Administration rejected the company's
application to market the much-anticipated drug, called Erbitux.</LD>
<TE>   Tauzin's letter said ImClone Systems gave "questionable
descriptions" of the reasons for the FDA's rejection, which later
were laid out in detail by the Cancer Letter, an industry newsletter
that obtained a copy of the FDA's confidential rejection letter.</TE>
<TE>   Tauzin said the company did not tell investors that the FDA
believed ImClone's clinical trial was so flawed that a new trial
would be needed, as reported in the newsletter.</TE>
<TE>   Tauzin's letter also took note of a series of lucrative insider
trades in ImClone stock that took place before the FDA rejection.</TE>
<TE>   The committee sent similar letters to the FDA and to Bristol-Myers
Squibb, which invested $1 billion in ImClone Systems last fall as
part of a costly deal to obtain U.S. marketing rights to Erbitux.</TE>
<TE>   The tenor of the letters suggests the committee may be looking for
a way for the FDA to tip off the Securities and Exchange Commission
when drug companies provide potentially false or misleading
information to investors. Most aspects of the FDA's administrative
review of new drug applications are confidential.</TE>
<TE>   But Peter Sheffield, a spokesman for the committee, said it is too
early to know what congressional investigators will find or where the
probe may lead.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of Bristol-Myers and ImClone said the companies
will cooperate with the committee, which set a Jan. 31 deadline for
receiving the materials. The FDA also pledged cooperation.</TE>
<TE>   The committee, in its letter, asked ImClone Chief Executive Samuel
Waksal to provide records of the company's correspondence and
meetings with the FDA and of its now controversial clinical trial of
Erbitux.</TE>
<TE>   "It is important that the hopes of cancer patients are not falsely
raised and that the integrity of biomedical research is maintained,"
Tauzin said his letter.</TE>
<TE>   The committee asked Bristol-Myers to provide a list of people who
conducted due diligence of ImClone when the pharmaceutical giant
invested in the company, buying a 20% stake at $70 a share.</TE>
<TE>   The committee also asked for internal audits and investigations
relating to ImClone and the opinion of Bristol-Myers' oncology
advisory committee on Erbitux, the revelation of which could prove
embarrassing to Bristol-Myers, whose stake in ImClone has lost $640
million in market value.</TE>
<TE>   The committee asked the FDA for its materials on Erbitux and also
its "legal analysis on relevant federal statutes concerning FDA
disclosure of nonpublic information" to the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   The congressional investigation is the latest in a series of
setbacks for the entrepreneurial company that until last month was
the toast of the biotechnology industry. Its shares traded as high as
$75 on Dec. 6 as the deadline for an FDA decision on Erbitux neared.
On Friday, its shares fell $8.93 to close at $21.15 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   The company's shares had climbed steadily since May, when it
presented data at a high-profile medical conference that showed
Erbitux, when used in combination with a powerful chemotherapy drug,
shrank tumors in 22.5% of colorectal cancer patients. ImClone said
the patients selected for the clinical trial had not benefited from
the chemotherapy drug, irinotecan, alone.</TE>
<TE>   The results electrified the medical and investment community,
because the outcome was better than what is achieved with existing
chemotherapy treatments. But the FDA said data submitted by ImClone
did not support its conclusion.</TE>

<HD>Muddled Outlook Batters Stocks</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Tech sector leads sell-off and Nasdaq falls
2.8% as bellwethers sound note of caution.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cautious outlooks from Microsoft and IBM sent technology stocks
tumbling Friday as investors worried that an economic recovery might
be further delayed.</LD>
<LD>   The tech-driven Nasdaq composite index closed out its worst week
since the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts said the sharp drop was to be expected given all the
buying investors indulged in late last year when they expected
business to quickly turn around in 2002.</LD>
<TE>   The tech sector took the brunt of the selling as Nasdaq fell 55.48
points, or 2.8%, to 1,930.34 and ended the week down 4.6%.</TE>
<TE>   The last time Nasdaq had a bigger weekly percentage decline was
Sept. 21 to 28, when it plunged 16% after the terror attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The market's other major indexes also posted sharp daily and
weekly declines.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average sank 78.19 points, or 0.8%, to
9,771.85. For the week, the Dow fell 2.2%, notching its first
back-to-back weekly losses since September.</TE>
<TE>   The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index stumbled 11.30 points, or 1.0%, to
1,127.58. It ended the week down 1.6%.</TE>
<TE>   The downturn reflected the market's disappointment with statements
from Dow members IBM and Microsoft late Thursday in which both
companies said they don't know if a recovery has started.</TE>
<TE>   Although the high-tech bellwethers beat earnings expectations,
that wasn't enough for Wall Street, which had been buying on the
assumption the companies would confirm a turnaround is in progress.</TE>
<TE>   IBM fell $5.65 to $114.25, while Microsoft tumbled $3.76 to
$66.10.</TE>
<TE>   The selling spread to other technology issues as well, including
Intel, which issued a similarly cloudy forecast earlier this week.
The chip maker, also a Dow member, fell $1.05 to $33.48.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think people were expecting lots of positive comments
about an economic recovery, but they were hoping for some glimmer of
hope, and so far management has not provided that," said John
Forelli, portfolio manager for John Hancock Core Value Fund. "So
people are taking profits instead of buying stocks."</TE>
<TE>   After two consecutive years of decline on Wall Street, investors
aren't willing to take many chances.</TE>
<TE>   Such caution has led them to take profits from the market's big
fourth-quarter advance.</TE>
<TE>   "People are gunshy. They know what happened in 2000 and 2001 and
are much quicker to take profits," said Richard A. Dickson, a
technical analyst for Hilliard Lyons in Louisville, Ky.</TE>
<TE>   In other market news Friday:</TE>
<TE>   * Bond yields slipped as the fall in stocks lured investors to
fixed-income securities.</TE>
<TE>   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 4.89%
from 4.93% on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Yields were up for the week, however, as falling jobless claims
and surging consumer confidence damped hopes that the Federal Reserve
will cut interest rates again when it meets later this month.</TE>
<TE>   * Sun Microsystems fell 25 cents to $12.12 despite posting a
narrower-than-expected loss for its fiscal second quarter and raising
its revenue expectations for the third quarter to $3.2 billion from
$3.1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   * Nortel Networks reported sales that declined steeply from the
year-earlier period but were slightly above its previous forecast.
Nortel, however, forecast a further 10% slide in revenue for the next
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Nortel fell 24 cents to $7.50.</TE>
<TE>   * Dell Computer fell 85 cents to $28.10 although it raised revenue
and earnings forecasts for the fiscal fourth quarter, citing
increased demand among consumers.</TE>
<TE>   * Trading in New Energy of San Diego was suspended until February
by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which questioned
information released by the company.</TE>
<TE>   New Energy said it would cooperate with the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   The stock closed Thursday at $3.45, down $1.10.</TE>

<HD>MP3.com Sues Former Copyright Counsel</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Having paid more than $190 million to settle copyright-infringement
claims, Vivendi Universal subsidiary MP3.com on Friday sued the Palo
Alto law firm that advised it on copyright matters.</LD>
<LD>   The malpractice lawsuit against Cooley Godward seeks hundreds of
millions of dollars in actual and punitive damages. "To my knowledge,
this is the largest legal malpractice case ever filed in California,"
said Allan Browne, who represents MP3.com.</LD>
<LD>   Vivendi's Universal Music Group subsidiary won a $53-million
judgment against MP3.com in November 2000. Vivendi bought MP3.com six
months later for $372 million, a bargain-basement price compared with
the company's peak market value of more than $2 billion.</LD>
<TE>   The lawsuit seeks to recover some of that lost value, along with
the money MP3.com has paid to record labels, music publishers and
attorneys--plus punitive damages. At least five
copyright-infringement lawsuits are pending against the company.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Pitchford, chief operating officer for Cooley Godward,
wouldn't comment on the specific allegations in the MP3.com
complaint. He said the lawsuit is "at odds with our view of the facts
and on the border of frivolous, and we intend to deal with it that
way."</TE>
<TE>   Cooley Godward specializes in legal issues for high-tech firms,
particularly in the areas of intellectual property and financing.</TE>
<TE>   The malpractice case centers on the My.MP3.com service that
MP3.com launched in January 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The free service, a form of Internet jukebox, lets users listen
online to songs they owned without going through the time-consuming
process of uploading each song to their online accounts.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit contends that Cooley Godward didn't "meaningfully
advise" MP3.com about the potential copyright liability, and falsely
told the company that it had "strong and viable defenses."</TE>
<TE>   The service drew copyright-infringement claims almost immediately
from the major record companies and music publishers, and a federal
judge quickly ruled that MP3.com had violated copyright law.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hewlett-Packard Co. accused director Walter Hewlett of misleading
investors on the purchase of Compaq Computer Corp., saying that he's
a "musician and academic" who never worked at the company and that
the other board members support the proposed deal.</LD>
<LD>   "We strongly object to his flawed presentation of the merger,
which misleads rather than informs shareowners," said the letter
signed by Chief Executive Carly Fiorina and HP's other directors.</LD>
<LD>   The company and Hewlett, eldest son of HP's co-founder, have been
squabbling for months over the Compaq deal. But the letter HP sent to
its 900,000 shareholders appeared to be the harshest attack yet on
Hewlett and his credentials.</LD>
<TE>   Hewlett sent his own letter to shareholders Wednesday, saying the
Compaq deal is too risky and would increase HP's exposure to weak
businesses.</TE>
<TE>   HP shares fell 92 cents to $22.61, while shares of Houston-based
Compaq fell 28 cents to $11.52, both on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<LD>Dell Computer Corp. said surprisingly strong consumer sales will lift
quarterly earnings past Wall Street forecasts.</LD>
<LD>   The world's leading maker of personal computers said sales to
consumers in its fiscal fourth quarter ending Feb. 1 will grow 50%
from the previous quarter. That will push total sales, including
those to business customers, to $8 billion. Analysts were expecting
$7.6 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Dell has stolen market share from rivals even as PC shipments fell
last year for the first time since 1985. The company has lured
consumers using TV commercials featuring a teenage pitchman.</LD>
<TE>   Dell now expects earnings of 17 cents, a penny higher than analyst
estimates. Its shares fell 85 cents to close at $28.10 on Nasdaq amid

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bayer said the number of deaths linked to its cholesterol drug
Baycol, withdrawn from sale last year, had doubled from an earlier
estimate of 52.</LD>
<LD>   The news sent shares in Germany's largest drug group down more
than 2% less than a week before it makes its debut on the New York
Stock Exchange and as it seeks partners for its ailing drug unit.</LD>
<LD>   It revived concerns about the possibility of a hefty compensation
payout, already worrying investors after Dow Chemical Co. settled an
asbestos lawsuit this month.</LD>

<HD>Consumers Upbeat on Hopes of Swift Recovery</HD>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Consumer optimism was the highest in a year in January as growing
hopes for a swift recovery from recession overshadowed worries about
joblessness.</LD>
<LD>   The University of Michigan's closely watched index surged for a
fourth straight month to 94.2 in early January from 88.8 in December,
beating forecasts. The index hit its highest level since January 2001
and is up more than 12 points from a post-Sept. 11 low.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts said the report was the latest confirmation that
consumers have withstood the worst of the downturn and are feeling
better about the future. But they cautioned that the unexpectedly
strong lift in consumer sentiment did not necessarily foretell a
similar rise in spending.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>MGM Inc. majority shareholder Kirk Kerkorian failed this week to
attract the promising bids he wants from major media companies for
his legendary studio, industry sources said.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts say that if he doesn't get his desired price, Kerkorian,
84, will probably shelve the idea and try again later. Since 1969,
Kerkorian has bought the studio three times, selling it twice.</LD>
<LD>   The billionaire was hoping that a suitor would pony up $30 a share
or more to get MGM's vast film library of more than 4,100 titles that
include the valuable James Bond franchise and the Pink Panther
series. That would put MGM's worth at about $7.2 billion.</LD>
<TE>   But sources at various media companies said that despite their
ongoing interest in MGM's library, none was ready to bid because the
price is too high.</TE>
<TE>   MGM had no comment beyond a statement released this week in which
it said no deal is imminent. Its stock fell 10 cents to close at
$20.90 on the NYSE.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Winston Tire Co., one of the nation's largest independent tire retail
chains, has filed for bankruptcy protection from creditors while it
reorganizes. The Chapter 11 petition was filed Tuesday in federal
Bankruptcy Court in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Industry sources said the regional tire retailer has struggled for
years as the industry consolidates.</LD>
<LD>   Although Burbank-based Winston Tire is a large independent with
133 stores, all in California, it was limited by selling mostly its
own Winston tires.</LD>
<TE>   The company, a unit of Louisiana-based Performance Management Inc.
since May, has 1,100 employees and reported 2001 revenue of about
$100 million.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it recently secured a $1-million line of credit
and is in the process of securing an additional $2 million to $5
million in credit from suppliers.</TE>

<LD>The U.S. trade deficit narrowed slightly in November to $27.89
billion, from a revised $29.33 billion in October, as imports slipped
and exports stayed soft in the face of slow economic growth at home

<LD>   The contraction reflected a slight increase in overall goods and

imports to $106.09 billion.</LD>

<LD>The Federal Communications Commission proposed fining SBC
Communications Inc. $6 million, the largest fine ever proposed by the
agency, for allegedly failing to comply with conditions of its merger
with Ameritech in 1999. The commission said SBC failed to offer
competing local telephone companies fair terms for access to part of
its network in five states, as the FCC had required.</LD>
<LD>   The company has 30 days to contest the proposed fine or pay.</LD>
<LD>   San Antonio-based SBC disputed the FCC's conclusions and said it
would appeal to the commission to drop the penalty.</LD>

<HD>IPO Abuse Probe Ends With Huge Settlement</HD>
<DH>SEC: Source says Credit Suisse First Boston to pay $100
million without admitting guilt.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Credit Suisse First Boston has agreed to pay $100 million to settle
an investigation by federal regulators into the firm's handling of
initial public stock offerings during the late 1990s stock boom, a
source said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The payment to the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
National Assn. of Securities Dealers includes a penalty of $30
million--the second-highest civil fine ever paid by a Wall Street
brokerage--and the disgorgement of $70 million in  profit from IPO
deals, the source said.</LD>
<LD>   Settlement of the case probably closes the book on one of the most
controversial parts of a broad investigation of IPO practices during
the technology-stock frenzy, when brokerage firms and their preferred
clients made huge profits but individual investors often incurred
stinging losses. The CSFB case received the most attention, in part
because of the firm's huge profit as one of the leading underwriters
of tech offerings. The SEC is continuing a separate IPO probe against
other major brokerages.</LD>
<TE>   CSFB succeeded in avoiding any allegations of civil securities
fraud. Fraud charges could have made the firm vulnerable to
IPO-related lawsuits filed by individual investors and could have
affixed a professional stigma.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the firm agreed to settle charges that it violated SEC
record-keeping rules, as well as separate NASD regulations, including
that CSFB improperly shared in the profits of its customers.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't arm the plaintiffs in the private litigation," said
John Coffee, a Columbia University securities law professor. "They're
not really helped by this settlement."</TE>
<TE>   In settling the case, CSFB will neither admit nor deny wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at CSFB, the SEC and NASD could not be reached for
comment late Friday. The SEC will formally disclose the settlement
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement grew out of a broad investigation by securities
regulators into how Wall Street firms distributed IPO shares during
the technology-stock boom of the late 1990s. The 18-month probe
examined whether the securities unit of Zurich-based Credit Suisse
Group charged excessive commissions to institutional investors who
sought shares of coveted IPOs, and whether those payments amounted to
kickbacks.</TE>
<TE>   Sources have previously said the SEC is conducting a parallel
probe into whether other brokerage firms manipulated IPO prices by
forcing customers who received IPO shares to buy additional more
stock once formal trading began. This settlement does not affect the
second investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC probably agreed not to bring fraud charges because it
could have been difficult to prove that any excessive commissions
harmed investors, Coffee said. The institutional investors paying the
commissions obviously were willing to do so. And because IPO shares
routinely soared, the companies going public were probably aware that
their IPOs were underpriced, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Individual investors have charged in their private lawsuits that
the secret payments amounted to stock manipulation that hurt them.
Many small investors paid astronomical prices to buy IPO shares on
their first day of trading.</TE>
<TE>   But proving damage to small investors could have been difficult,
Coffee said. If CSFB were to have revealed the hidden payments to
individuals, it probably would have increased their interest in the
IPOs rather than frightened them away, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Such a disclosure "doesn't tell you, 'This company is shaky,'"
Coffee said. "It tells you, 'Sophisticated people who know more than
I know are willing to pay an awful lot of money to get this
allocation. This sounds like this [stock] might stay hot.'"</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan considered bringing
criminal charges against CSFB but decided late last year not to do
so.</TE>
<TE>   In terms of penalties paid by brokerages, the $30-million penalty
would be surpassed only by the $122-million payment by Salomon Bros.
in 1992 for its role in a scandal involving the auctioning of
Treasury securities. The $100-million total payment would rank as the
fifth-largest settlement of SEC charges by a brokerage firm.</TE>

<HD>Talk to Utter Its Final Issue</HD>
<DH>Media: The monthly devoted to culture blames shutdown on
weak ad revenue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CORIE BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Talk magazine, the monthly devoted to culture and celebrities and the
brainchild of publishing maven Tina Brown and movie mogul Harvey
Weinstein, said Friday that it will cease publication, 21/2 years
after its launch.</LD>
<LD>   The glossy magazine, headed by former New Yorker magazine editor
Brown, and jointly owned by Walt Disney Co.'s Miramax Films and
Hearst Corp., blamed the shutdown on the economy as advertising
revenues for the magazine industry fell 10% in 2001, when the economy
began slowing into a recession.</LD>
<LD>   "It's been a tough year, one of the worst in the history of the
magazine industry," said Leo Kivijarv, a media analyst with Veronis,
Suhler &amp; Associates Inc., noting that Mademoiselle, McCalls and the
Industry Standard have folded in recent months.</LD>
<TE>   Unveiled at a star-studded party in New York with Madonna during a
media boom in 1999, Talk's first issue published a revealing
interview with Hillary Rodham Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   "The lavish editorial product wasn't something that Hearst could
live with," said Jerry McGee, president of the Los Angeles office of
advertising agency J. Walter Thompson. "The number of readers didn't
justify the expense."</TE>
<TE>   Talk also paled when compared with Hearst's other new title, O:
The Oprah Magazine, a bona fide hit.</TE>
<TE>   The February issue will be the magazine's final one. "I know that
the magazine was stronger than it has ever been," Brown said. "The
fact is that the ad recession was so intense that it made it
impossible to find another investor in this environment."</TE>
<TE>   Brown needed a new investor, according to company sources, because
after the partnership sank $50 million into the magazine, Hearst
wanted out. Last year, Talk Media hired investment bankers Allen &amp;
Co. to find an investor to replace Hearst.</TE>
<TE>   "The cost to produce a general interest magazine at this level is
high," Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   Renowned for reviving Vanity Fair magazine in the 1980s, Brown
became editor of The New Yorker in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Brown called the staff into Talk's Manhattan conference room late
Friday to tell them that the magazine was going out of business.</TE>
<TE>   Talk had a total staff of 100.</TE>
<TE>   The magazine's vital statistics were improving, just not fast
enough. Advertising pages were up 6% last year over 2000 with ad
revenue up 25%. And circulation was up 20% from a year ago--to
670,000--with the February issue.</TE>
<TE>   Talk Miramax Books, owned solely by Miramax Films, will continue
its operations with Brown remaining as chairwoman. It plans to
publish upcoming titles by former New York City Mayor Rudolph W.
Giuliani and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.</TE>

<HD>Not All Tech Firms Seeing a Quick Return to Profit</HD>
<DH>Analysis: Top-tier companies are experiencing renewed
demand, but it may be a year before that upturn trickles down to the
sector's suppliers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN KAPLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The encouraging signs that the top of the technology pyramid has
weathered the worst of the economic slump has obscured a sobering
reality: The nuts-and-bolts companies that form the foundation of the
industry are still mired in a meltdown.</LD>
<LD>   Firms at the top of the hierarchy such as Microsoft Corp., Yahoo
Inc. and Compaq Computer Corp. sparked optimism on Wall Street this
week with earnings, though anemic compared with the boom years of the
late 1990s, nonetheless signaled that the period of freefall has
ended.</LD>
<LD>   Those front-line companies are best positioned to feel the early
stirrings of renewed demand from consumers and businesses. But they
are merely the first links of a long chain of events that will take
at least a year to ripple through the entire supply chain of the
high-tech economy.</LD>
<TE>   The bottom is populated by thousands of companies such as Applied
Materials Inc., KLA Tencor Corp. and Novellus Systems Inc., which
make the equipment needed to produce microchips. Their stocks
plummeted this week after chip-making giant Intel Corp. said it would
cut its capital spending 25% in 2002 despite fourth-quarter earnings
that beat analysts' expectations.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Applied Materials are off 11.5% since Intel's
announcement Tuesday. KLA Tencor is down 9.7%, and Novellus Systems
has slumped 10.6%.</TE>
<TE>   "The fourth quarter is a mixed bag," said John Corcoran, an
Internet analyst with CIBC World Markets in Boston. "It depends on
the sector, it depends on the segment of the sector, and it depends
on the particular company. It depends on where they are in the cycle
and what they do."</TE>
<TE>   The gradual rippling process of recovery is being played out in
all the major sectors of the high-tech industry: computers, the
Internet and telecommunications.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Yahoo rose nearly 11% on Thursday after the Internet
portal reported a narrower quarterly net loss and raised 2002 sales
estimates slightly.</TE>
<TE>   But the companies further down the Internet chain are still
suffering. Online advertising firm DoubleClick Inc. had a
fourth-quarter loss of $64 million, causing its stock to fall
slightly.</TE>
<TE>   Even further down the chain are network equipment makers, whose
livelihoods depend on demand from healthy Web content and commerce
firms. Some of them were once among the highest of the high-fliers
when dot-coms were powering the industry.</TE>
<TE>   Juniper Networks Inc. captured one-third of the market for
Internet routers with its faster machines, but since then its
customers have slashed spending. After reporting a fourth-quarter
loss of $5.13 million on Tuesday, its shares fell 5.6% in one day, to
$16.96. It has since recovered to $17, but is still just a fraction
of its high of $243 in October 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say it will take at least a year for the recovery that is
beginning to lift front-line companies such as PC and software makers
to ripple through the economy and lift companies that are several
layers removed from end users in homes and businesses.</TE>
<TE>   The process of recovery cannot even begin in earnest until this
summer, when corporations--which drive the bulk of tech
spending--begin working on their budgets for 2003, said Rob Enderle,
a technology analyst with Giga Information Group in Santa Clara,
Calif.</TE>
<TE>   Only when their budgets are set can PC makers begin to forecast
how many computers and servers they'll be able to sell. Based on
those estimates, they order components such as microprocessors from
Intel, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and other suppliers.</TE>
<TE>   They, in turn, compare those orders to the inventory they have on
hand and then decide how much to spend on capital equipment, such as
the machines needed to fabricate chips. Only then can the recovery
trickle down to companies like Applied Materials, and the sobering
reality is that there is little they can do but wait, Enderle said.</TE>
<TE>   "Until then, they can all go to Aruba in sailfishing boats," he
said.</TE>

<HD>A Class That Trades Gym Shorts for Wetsuits</HD>
<DH>Students at Palisades Charter High can hit the waves for
credit, wiping out at least one excuse for skipping school.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH R. WEISS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The surf is raging, the wind blowing offshore and any teenage surfer
in tune with the rhythms of the sea is scheming to cut class.</LD>
<LD>   Not this crew at Palisades Charter High School. No need. First
period is surf class.</LD>
<LD>   While other students huff and puff their way around the track in
PE class, these wetsuit-clad teenagers hoot and howl as they snag a
few wind-sculpted waves.</LD>
<TE>   Adam Bertolet grabs their attention as he glides his longboard
across the face of a wave, which begins to wrap around him like a
barrel--the leading edge cresting over his head. Then another student
attempts to get "barreled." Then another.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, the 25 students realize they are sitting way too close
to shore. Arms paddling furiously, they scratch their way up the face
of an 8-foot wave as it threatens to crash on them and drill sand up
their noses.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't need to cut class," says Melody Overstreet, one of five
girls in the class. "This is my motivation to go to school. This
starts my day off on a beautiful note."</TE>
<TE>   Pali High is one of a handful of high schools in Southern
California that offer surfing as physical education class. Other
schools sponsor surf teams that paddle out before or after school,
but Pali High is one of the few that gives PE credit for surfing.</TE>
<TE>   Location, of course, plays a role. It's easier to offer a surf
class if the high school is in Manhattan Beach, Redondo Beach or
Huntington Beach than, say, Eagle Rock.</TE>
<TE>   The Pali High surf class meets at Will Rogers State Beach about a
half mile from campus.</TE>
<TE>   Class schedule helps too. Pali High adopted a "block" schedule
three years ago, ditching the traditional hourlong classes for
two-hour classes every other day. That's enough time for surfing as
well as for driving back and forth to the beach and changing into and
out of clingy wetsuits.</TE>
<TE>   Ray Millette, a marine biology teacher and lifelong surfer, says
other PE teachers at Pali High were thrilled when he launched the
surf class three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   As they see it, he took on a number of free spirits who "don't
always dress [for gym] or follow the rules."</TE>
<TE>   Although surf class would seem like a perk of living near the
beach, students come from all over Los Angeles to attend Pali High, a
charter and magnet school.</TE>
<TE>   Any of them can attend the class providing they can arrange
transportation to the beach and supply their own boards.</TE>
<TE>   Millette helps beginners get on their feet and coaches them during
the year, offering tips on how to improve their form. Skill tests are
held every five weeks. On days when the surf is flat, students run on
the beach or lie on their boards and paddle a half-mile course around
a buoy tethered offshore.</TE>
<TE>   Millette hopes to field a surf team soon that will compete with
schools from the South Bay and Orange County. For now, class mostly
means time for students to have fun in the surf.</TE>
<TE>   "Here," he says, wriggling into his wetsuit in the beach parking
lot, "we let them express themselves in their own athletic way."</TE>
<TE>   The first student to arrive is Matt Brown, a 16-year-old with a
newly issued driver's license.</TE>
<TE>   It's shortly after 7 a.m. Monday. The morning chill lingers. Fog
shrouds the coast and drizzle wets the pavement. The surf has dropped
off overnight, so Matt huddles in his Ford Explorer, heater and
Walkman cranked up to maximum levels.</TE>
<TE>   Then Ted Smith rolls up in his bright green 1969 Camaro, coming to
a stop at an odd angle.</TE>
<TE>   Craig Spalding noses his 20-year-old Ford Bronco right between
their cars. It's coated with mud from some obvious off-roading.</TE>
<TE>   "Dude, where've you been?" Ted asks, examining the mud-caked hood.
Craig shoots him a mischievous grin.</TE>
<TE>   Pretty soon the parking lot fills with assorted vehicles, pointing
every which way--most of them ignoring the neat lines painted on the
blacktop. Rock blares from one car's stereo.</TE>
<TE>   "What did you do this weekend?" Ted asks. His fists are shoved
deep in the pockets of his oversized cargo shorts.</TE>
<TE>   "Surf," Matt says.</TE>
<TE>   Ted: "Where?"</TE>
<TE>   Matt: "Zeros. El Porto. Zuma, Little Dume. How about you?</TE>
<TE>   Ted: "I kept going north and wanted to see if Supertubes was going
off. You could make it, but only on the sets. It was so heavy."</TE>
<TE>   Millette appears out of nowhere and orders them to suit up.</TE>
<TE>   One by one, the students take the plunge into the chilly Pacific.
A few hang back, citing injuries, suspected colds, or, in one case, a
newly dinged surfboard in need of repair.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard stories that high school wasn't fun," says Greg Bebout, a
Billy Idol blond who rides a knee board. "But Pali is fun."</TE>
<TE>   Millette joins the students in the water, catching the waves with
as much enthusiasm as the students a third his age. "Of all of my
friends," he says, "I'm the only one who gets paid to surf. I guess
that makes me a pro."</TE>
<TE>   A few hardy students paddle for a buoy about a quarter-mile
offshore, going the distance for the exercise.</TE>
<TE>   Others jockey for position in the lineup of surfers, hopping on
the small waves breaking close to shore, pulling out quickly before
being catapulted onto the dry sand.</TE>
<TE>   An hour passes quickly and Millette reminds the class that it's
time to go. On this day, with barely ridable surf, the students put
up little resistance to ending their session.</TE>
<TE>   "There's just one thing as important to teenagers as surfing,"
Millette says. Eating. Back on campus, cookies, bagels and other
snacks await them during the 20-minute break before the next class
begins.</TE>
<TE>   The last student still in the water, skinny 15-year-old Dane
Anderson, with shaved head and a horseshoe earring, holds up an index
finger to signal: just one more.</TE>
<TE>   "Ten more would be good," Dane says. "But one more will have to
do."</TE>

<LD>THE DIARY OF</LD>
<LD>   A COUNTRY PRIEST</LD>
<LD>   A Novel</LD>
<TE>   By Georges Bernanos</TE>
<TE>   Translated from the</TE>
<TE>   French by Pamela Morris</TE>
<TE>   Carroll &amp; Graf</TE>
<TE>   $14, 298 pages, paper</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   French novelist Georges Bernanos was obsessed with the ways in
which science and capitalism challenged the Catholic Church in the
early 20th century. He wrote about these enormous issues not in epic
novels with casts of thousands, but in terms of the private crises of
individuals.</TE>
<TE>   Of all his books, it was his third novel, in 1936, "The Diary of a
Country Priest," that captivated readers (and inspired a film by
Robert Bresson) with its story of a sickly young priest in charge of
a gossipy, hardhearted parish in the French countryside.</TE>
<TE>   A reissue of Bernanos' splendid story invites new readers to
witness the priest's efforts to live according to the Gospels in a
hostile, materialistic community; it may even offer hope to people
who face similar struggles.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be hard to find such another place from which to
overlook the whole village, gathered together, as it were, in the
palm of a hand," he writes from a hilltop. "I look down, but it never
seems to look back at me. Rather does it turn away, cat-like,
watching me askance with half-shut eyes. What does it want of me?
Does it even want anything of me?"</TE>
<TE>   Viewed through his young, inexperienced eyes, the parish of
Ambricourt is rife with behavior not unlike ours. The people are just
as vain and secretive; hatreds arise from the same private traumas
that today, thanks to shock TV, are made grotesquely public.</TE>
<TE>   And for Bernanos, the devil and his minions are present, though he
doesn't write about bat-winged ghouls or spirits. It's their sinful
power that is visible. People are bitterly cynical, delighted by
scandal. (When the priest faints on a country lane, a rumor spreads
that he's an alcoholic, though we later learn that it's caused by a
tumor.)</TE>
<TE>   On his daily rounds, the priest notes how the taunting faces of
catechism students look "hard and avid." The grocer tricks him into
buying expensive wine without a pang of guilt; such small acts of
lying, he reflects, "can form a crust around the consciousness."</TE>
<TE>   In answer to such displays of contempt, the priest is
compassionate, reserved and nonjudgmental. He even forgives Chantal,
the rebellious spoiled daughter of the count and countess, writing
how her angry, tear-streaked face has an "almost unusual, almost
alarming nobility of expression [bearing] witness to the power of
evil."</TE>
<TE>   "I shouldn't think there's another softy like you in the entire
diocese," his friend, the Cure de Torcy, tells him. "Really, His
Grace must have been very hard up for priests to have given you the
handling of the parish. Luckily a parish is solid enough--or you
might break it."</TE>
<TE>   And yet, Bernanos wants us to value the priest's soft, generous
nature. He is full of innocence, which troubles his colleagues who
urge him to be tougher.</TE>
<TE>   In some ways, "Diary" is a failed novel of education, a genre in
which various figures share their wisdom with an idealistic young
man.</TE>
<TE>   Here, those figures offer only cynical or desperate philosophies
of life that pale beside the priest's burning piety. Torcy is too
pragmatic, too jaded, while the diocesan dean is more concerned about
what our day calls "spin." Monologues of a young soldier and the
priest's old friend, a defrocked priest, are poignant examples of
modern stoicism and despair. And yet, for all these speeches, "Diary"
never bogs down.</TE>
<TE>   There is great suspense when the priest confronts the haughty
countess about Chantal. His firm but gentle questioning chips away at
her defenses until she reveals the painful secret that has poisoned
her and her family's emotional life.</TE>
<TE>   The reader also watches the priest's own illness and, as he nears
death, hopes for a small miracle that never comes.</TE>
<TE>   Novelist Remy Rougeau's introduction emphasizes the book's
continuing relevance. What might shock modern readers is the way in
which this priest cultivates humiliation and innocence.</TE>
<TE>   Most of us would assume that these qualities must be overcome, not
welcomed, to be successful. And this, perhaps, is why Bernanos' tale
is needed more now than ever.</TE>
<TE>   "Ours is an age of doctors, lawyers and CEOs who must not appear
weak," Rougeau explains. "Americans think themselves capable of
nearly anything, certainly of shaping the future. We are not
particularly good at recognizing our nothingness in face of the
universe."</TE>
<TE>   The priest certainly recognizes his "nothingness," but that
doesn't mean his efforts are futile. His sweat is worth a great deal.
Bernanos, Rougeau notes, admired St. Therese of Lisieux, a saint
probably easier for most of us to understand than, say, Joan of Arc.
Therese was the saint of small gestures, of 9-to-5ers like many of
us, sweeping halls and quietly dying of tuberculosis.</TE>
<TE>   The church's canonization of her in 1925 signified how God's grace
works everywhere, in every corner, even in Ambricourt.</TE>
<TE>   And this is why, as the young priest lies on his deathbed, this
vital truth spills from his lips: "Grace is everywhere." That's a
balm for people feeling overlooked or forgotten, a solace for any
stuck in uncreative jobs; the simplest truths are often the sweetest.</TE>

<HD>At UCLA, a New Approach to Jewish Studies</HD>
<DH>Education: Director Kenneth Reinhard is bringing the
program out of its academic niche and attracting more students and
supporters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the 18 months since being named director of UCLA's small Jewish
studies program, Kenneth Reinhard has led an impressive retooling
designed to bring the isolated academic niche into the scholarly
mainstream.</LD>
<LD>   He's successfully pushed for a reduction in the undergraduate
requirements for Hebrew, added courses that explore the impact of
Jewish culture on secular life, and developed new emphases for
undergraduate majors, including Jewish law, American Jewish studies
and Israel studies.</LD>
<LD>   He also has attracted both non-Jewish professors and students to
the UCLA Center for Jewish Studies' programs, expanded educational
seminars for the community and landed more than $600,000 in grants.</LD>
<TE>   "It's about rescuing Jewish studies from the status of minority
studies--bringing it out of the ghetto," says Reinhard, 44, an
associate professor at the university for 13 years. "It's not just
about teaching Jews about Judaism, but about how Judaism has helped
transform Western civilization."</TE>
<TE>   It's a move that many university Jewish studies programs are
making to stay in business because of the dwindling number of Jewish
students. A major conference at Stanford University will explore the
ramifications of this trend in April.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're off to the side, you're going to become intellectually
provincial quickly," Stanford professor Arnold Eisen said.</TE>
<TE>   Reinhard's boss, Pauline Yu, dean of UCLA's humanities division,
says, "He's been full of ideas for the center. By bringing in
substantial amounts of funding, he must be doing something right."</TE>
<TE>   From a distance of nearly 2,000 miles, Bernard M. Levinson,
director of a similar program at the University of Minnesota, has
watched Reinhard's progress with envy.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm jealous as heck," he said. "I haven't seen any Jewish studies
program that forward looking" in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The center also has held a series of high-profile conferences that
have attracted international scholars from a variety of faiths.</TE>
<TE>   For example, in April the center will host a "St. Paul and
Modernity" conference, co-sponsored by Fuller Theological Seminary
and the National Endowment for the Humanities. The slate of
panelists, including French, Italian and Slovenian scholars, will
discuss the writings of Christianity's most famous convert from
Judaism.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the center's community outreach, Reinhard has developed
a six-month program on "The Legacy of Ten Commandments," in which
rabbis, psychologists, priests, English professors, museum curators,
and Christian and Islamic scholars delve into the modern implications
of the ancient laws.</TE>
<TE>   Sessions Draw</TE>
<TE>   Community Members</TE>
<TE>   The twice-monthly sessions at UCLA draw about 80 participants from
the Los Angeles area, which has the nation's second-largest Jewish
community. At the "Do Not Murder" seminar earlier this month, a rabbi
and Islamic scholar talked about the commandment's effect on war,
abortion, euthanasia and capital punishment.</TE>
<TE>   "I needed insight into the Jewish head to understand my faith,"
said Jillian Le Patourel, a Christian who attends the sessions. "I
needed to understand Jesus' Jewish roots. This is wonderful."</TE>
<TE>   As part of the center's service, a car was sent for Esther Shapiro
Horney, a 90-year-old Santa Monica resident who wanted to hear the
seminar but couldn't drive at night.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel I still need to get out while I'm still alive so I know
what's going on," Horney said.</TE>
<TE>   "Do Not Commit Adultery" is the topic for Thursday's session at
the Center for Jewish Studies. It features a psychologist and a
rabbi.</TE>
<TE>   Reinhard is an unlikely figure to head UCLA's Center for Jewish
Studies. Until nine years ago, he worked in academia strictly as a
professor of English and comparative literature, never giving Judaism
much thought.</TE>
<TE>   His childhood spiritual roots were shallow. He was raised an
"ultra-Reform" Jew, as he calls it, in the Chicago suburbs, attending
a synagogue where no Hebrew was spoken and services were on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just like being in a Protestant church," he said. "It felt
very alienating."</TE>
<TE>   But in the early 1990s, after he and his wife, who live in Irvine,
decided to raise their future children as Jews, he decided to get
serious about his faith.</TE>
<TE>   His wife, Julia Reinhard Luptona, a UC Irvine professor, converted
to Judaism, and Reinhard found a spiritual brother in Rabbi Elie
Spitz, who heads a Conservative synagogue in Tustin where the couple
are now members.</TE>
<TE>   "He showed me how amazingly interesting Judaism is," said
Reinhard, who has a 5-year-old daughter and 2-year-old triplets.
"It's not just the first half of Judeo-Christian culture. It's
connected with so many other things--psychoanalysis, philosophy,
literature, law."</TE>
<TE>   A few years later, Reinhard found himself melding his new love for
Jewish studies with his work in English and comparative literature.</TE>
<TE>   "It was personal and academic at the same time," he said. "I never
felt the two come together so profoundly."</TE>
<TE>   He's taken this approach to the Center for Jewish Studies, though
he's quick to say that he merely is building on the legacy of
previous directors.</TE>
<TE>   A Question of</TE>
<TE>   Alienating Jews</TE>
<TE>   Norbert Samuelson, an Arizona State University professor, said he
has "mixed feelings" about the trend to mainstream Jewish studies.
"Jews have played a major role in every part of Western civilization,
so it's the correct instinct," he said. But he said he wonders if the
Jewish community, which has funded Jewish studies programs across the
country, will become alienated and put its money elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "Are you hurting the only people who care about you?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   Reinhard acknowledges that his effort to make the 8-year-old
center more accessible has drawn criticism from traditionalists who
would prefer a center focus more directly on Jewish culture. But he
says his lofty plans for the center require a broadening of the
mission to attract new students, professors and supporters.</TE>
<TE>   For example, about a dozen UCLA students graduate each year with
an undergraduate degree in Jewish studies, a number Reinhard wants to
see increase dramatically.</TE>
<TE>   A new yearlong graduate course, "The Bible and Its
Interpretations," has drawn 30 students from throughout the
university.</TE>
<TE>   Reinhard is lobbying for a master's program in Jewish studies at
UCLA, and a doctorate program that would be available throughout the
UC system.</TE>
<TE>   The professor's biggest challenge may be fund-raising. His goal is
to raise $2.5 million for an endowment, which started with a $500,000
matching grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities; it
requires the center to raise an additional $2 million.</TE>
<TE>   "That's big stuff," said the University of Minnesota's Levinson.
"It's incredibly competitive. It recognizes that there's something
happening at UCLA of national importance."</TE>
<TE>   Reinhard needs to find $600,000 by the end of June to reach this
year's goal. But asking for money isn't a problem for Reinhard.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel passionate about what I do," he said. "I really believe in
it. I feel strongly that Jewish studies connects with the broadest
range of human experience."</TE>

<LD>LOUISVILLE, Ky.--Financial woes have forced the Presbyterian Church
(U.S.A.) to drop a plan for a denominational welcome center at the
Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.</LD>
<LD>   The denomination had hoped to raise up to $7 million to build a
center for worship and hospitality in Utah, where 70% of residents
are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</LD>
<LD>   The Welcome Center was to house big-screen televisions
broadcasting Olympic events, while offering Bible lessons and worship
in a 10,000-square-foot sanctuary. Multimedia presentations on
Presbyterian missions were also planned.</LD>

<HD>Many Faiths Plan to Join Pope's Pilgrimage to Assisi</HD>
<DH>Peace: Pontiff decided to lead the trip after Sept. 11 to
decry the use of religion as a motive for violence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PEGGY POLK</AU>
<BD>RELIGION NEWS SERVICE</BD>
<DL>VATICAN CITY</DL>
<LD>In a response to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Pope John Paul II
will lead representatives of Islam and many other religions on a
peace pilgrimage to the medieval town of Assisi next week.</LD>
<LD>   Two months ago, the Roman Catholic pontiff invited the religious
leaders to travel with him to the birthplace of St. Francis on Jan.
24 to "proclaim before the world that religion must never become the
motive of conflict, hate and violence."</LD>
<LD>   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said Friday that Orthodox,
Eastern and Protestant Christians, along with Jews, Muslims,
Buddhists, Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Zoroastrians and members of the
Tenrikyo, Shinto and traditional African faiths have accepted the
invitation.</LD>
<TE>   The Orthodox delegation will be led by Ecumenical Patriarch
Bartholomew I of Constantinople and will include patriarchs or
representatives of the Greek Orthodox churches of Alexandria and All
Africa, Antioch and All the East, Jerusalem, Moscow, Serbia, Romania,
Finland, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Poland and Albania.</TE>
<TE>   Also sending high-level representatives will be the Anglican,
Reformed, Scottish Presbyterian, Methodist, Disciples of Christ,
Pentecostal, Lutheran, Baptist, Mennonite, Quaker and Moravian
denominations, the Salvation Army, Conference of Secretaries of the
Christian World Communions and the World Council of Churches.</TE>
<TE>   Ten rabbis, including three from the United States and two from
Jerusalem, and 29 Muslim scholars, imams, grand muftis and sheiks
also will participate.</TE>
<TE>   Both the Dalai Lama and the archbishop of Canterbury, George
Carey, declined the pope's invitation because of other commitments.</TE>
<TE>   The religious leaders in attendance will offer testimonials to
peace, pray separately, eat a "frugal meal" in the refectory of the
Sacred Convent of Assisi and end the pilgrimage by declaring their
common commitment to peace and lighting a lamp of peace.</TE>
<TE>   "Never again violence! Never again war! Never again terrorism! In
the name of God may every religion bring to Earth justice and peace,
pardon and life, love!" the pope will say, according to a text issued
by his Office for Liturgical Celebrations.</TE>
<TE>   It will be the third time John Paul has gathered with leaders of
other religions to pray for peace in the home of the 13th century
saint who lived in poverty and dedicated his life to peace and
brotherhood.</TE>
<TE>   The first Assisi meeting was Oct. 27, 1986, during the Cold War;
the second was Jan. 9-10, 1993, amid strife in the Balkans.</TE>
<TE>   In issuing his invitation to the third Assisi pilgrimage, the pope
spoke of the "worrying tensions" caused by the attacks of Islamic
terrorists on New York and the Pentagon and said he wanted in
particular for Christians and Muslims to pray together. The Muslim
delegation will be the largest on the pilgrimage.</TE>
<TE>   The 81-year-old pope and his fellow religious leaders will make
the two-hour trip to Assisi, 140 miles north of Rome, by rail,
leaving from St. Peter's Station inside the Vatican.</TE>
<TE>   The station was built under Pope Pius XI in the early 20th
century, but Pope John XXIII was the first pontiff to use it, making
a pilgrimage to the shrine of Loreto and Assisi on Oct. 4, 1962, the
eve of the Second Vatican Council.</TE>
<TE>   The Vatican spokesman said John Paul and his guests will travel in
six or seven unmodified Italian railroad cars with double rows of
seats on either side of a central corridor. The train's only stop
will be a technical one--to switch from a diesel to an
electric-powered locomotive 150 yards outside Vatican walls.</TE>
<TE>   Security will be tight but discreet, Navarro-Valls said. He said a
helicopter will hover above the train as it travels from the Vatican
to Assisi and back.</TE>

<BD>FROM TIMES WIRE REPORTS</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago plans to close 14
elementary schools in the city and suburbs because of continued low
enrollment and dwindling finances. The archdiocese will also
consolidate two schools and open three new ones.</LD>
<LD>   The changes are expected to uproot 2,390 students in the nation's
largest Catholic school system. Displaced students and staff will be
sent to other archdiocesan schools.</LD>
<LD>   Many of the facilities scheduled to close are in poor
neighborhoods, where parishes are not able to subsidize the schools
on their own. Eleven of the closures are in Chicago, and the others
are in the suburbs of Cicero, Melrose Park and Harvey.</LD>

<HD>Enron's Far-Reaching Web</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Enron debacle is long past being a story about the fall of a
corporation. Enron's tentacles stretch far and wide, to accounting
firms, the Securities and Exchange Commission, Congress, the White
House, the Justice Department, even journalists. The question is
becoming not who was tainted by Enron but who wasn't. It is an object
lesson in why the SEC, the campaign finance system, the government
culture itself need reform. With so few left untainted, who is
trustworthy to clean up the mess?</LD>
<LD>   Consider the Bush administration, which has 35 officials who have
held Enron stock. Top political advisor Karl Rove's stock was worth
six figures. President Bush, despite his lame attempt to associate
Enron head Kenneth L. Lay with former Texas Gov. Ann Richards, has
long enjoyed a close relationship with him. Presidential economic
advisor Lawrence B. Lindsey received $50,000 as an Enron "advisor."
Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft recused himself from the criminal
investigation because he had received a hefty Enron contribution to
his 2000 senatorial campaign.</LD>
<LD>   Given these and many more links, it is ever more disturbing that
Vice President Dick Cheney obstinately refuses to divulge detailed
information about his energy task force's numerous meetings with
Enron executives.</LD>
<TE>   Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) has released another study
showing that numerous policies in the White House energy plan were
virtually identical to those espoused by Enron; no fewer than 17
policies, including deregulation initiatives and support for trading
in energy derivatives, would have benefited the corporation.</TE>
<TE>   By no means did Enron confine its efforts to the White House. On
the contrary, Capitol Hill lawmakers eagerly partook of Enron's
booty. Power couple Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas) and Wendy Gramm
constitute a study in conflicts of interest in themselves. Wendy
Gramm is a member of Enron's board; her husband was pivotal in
permitting Enron to receive an energy trading exemption.</TE>
<TE>   As The Times' Mark Fineman revealed Friday, none of the key
congressional committees investigating Enron or its former auditor,
the Andersen company, would be able to summon a majority if they
excluded members who had received campaign contributions from either
company. Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), one of the chief
investigators, accepted thousands of dollars from both. Rep. W.J.
"Billy" Tauzin (R-La.), who is aggressively investigating, raked in
contributions from the two companies. Lieberman and Tauzin are
running away from Enron as fast as they can, but the contributions
will always distort public perception of their actions.</TE>
<TE>   Few have been more fervent in denouncing the culture of greed that
led to debacles such as Enron than New York Times economics columnist
Paul Krugman. Yet it now turns out that Krugman himself was paid
$50,000 as an Enron consultant in 1999, even though his  position had
"no function" that he was aware of.</TE>
<TE>   After Sept. 11, polls showed that the American public had greater
confidence in government and other institutions. The Enron scandal
threatens to swiftly reverse that trend. There could be no better
argument for political and regulatory reforms.</TE>

<HD>The $500-Million Water Bill</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Westlands Water District's problems began about 600,000 years ago
when much of California's now-fertile Central Valley was a lake and
the lake bed was a layer of clay 20 to 200 feet thick. That clay may
wind up costing the taxpayers of the United States $500 million or
more in addition to the millions it already has consumed. Rather than
undertake a costly boondoggle to better drain the land, the
government may buy as much as a third of the sprawling district, the
nation's largest. Taxpayers should favor a buyout, if a decent price
can be reached.</LD>
<LD>   Here's the science: Subsidized federal water that irrigates crops
in parts of the 600,000-acre district does not naturally drain off or
filter deep into underground aquifers. The water is polluted by salts
that collect during irrigation and build up atop the clay layer
rather than draining away, ultimately destroying crops. Worse yet,
some of the waste irrigation water is contaminated by selenium, which
was blamed for a massive kill of ducks and other waterfowl at
Kesterson Reservoir in the mid-1980s.</LD>
<TE>   The federal government knew about this problem when it began
planning to irrigate Westlands in the early 1950s. To fix this flaw
in the pet project of the late Rep. B.F. Sisk (D-Fresno) and
burgeoning corporate farms, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation proposed
building a huge drain to carry the polluted water back north and dump
it in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. Ultimately it was to flow
through San Francisco Bay and into the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   The drain wasn't finished, and Westlands, which covers a
70-mile-long, once-arid stretch of western Fresno and Kings counties,
has successfully sued the government to force it to carry out its
promise to fix the drainage problem. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation
recently released studies indicating that the solution would cost as
much as $3.8 billion.</TE>
<TE>   What happened to the drain? It was only partly built when
environmental opposition mounted. The delta was polluted already. It
made no sense to dump even more polluted water into the estuary. For
years, the farmers and government sent the runoff to Kesterson
Reservoir, which in effect became a polluted sump. This ended after
the massive bird kill of the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   There was some talk of completing the drain, but that is an
environmental impossibility now. The $3.8-billion solution would be
to treat the water in a sort of desalinization plant. Far better to
stop irrigating the land. The sticking point is likely to be the
price. Westlands farmers are seeking $1,500 to $2,500 an acre, the
market value of fully productive land. Those prices, which would add
up to about a half-billion dollars, are far too high. First, farmers
have benefited from federally subsidized irrigation water all these
years, and, second, much of the land is so polluted it can't be
farmed profitably. Some sort of purchase or conservation easement or
the marketing of some of the water to other willing buyers is the
ultimate solution.</TE>
<TE>   Westlands was a 1950s inspiration of farmers and eager federal dam
builders who sought to make the desert bloom. Salt is triumphing in
the end.</TE>

<LD>Sometimes even the most arcane sciences can have practical
applications. Consider, for example, new research on how matter that
is light-years away influences atoms on Earth.</LD>
<LD>   The work of Ken Lanzetta, a State University of New York
astronomer, on this mind-bending subject was primarily intended to
find the age of stars. By cleverly analyzing data from the Hubble
Space Telescope--"teasing out an incredibly subtle result from what
is really just little fuzz balls," as one of his colleagues put
it--he found evidence suggesting that most stars are about twice as
old as previously thought, formed in a giant fireworks explosion 14
billion years ago.</LD>
<LD>   This may seem of interest only to a small cadre of astronomers,
but the work stands to benefit more down-to-earth sciences such as
computing. Though computers have been getting smaller and faster
every year, engineers are approaching the speed limits of
conventional chips built from integrated circuits. The most promising
way to break that limit is through "nanocomputing," building chips
out of individual atoms. That's where Lanzetta's research comes in.
By elucidating the behavior of atoms light-years away, astronomers
like him are helping engineers better understand the behavior of
atoms on Earth.</LD>
<TE>   On the day last week that Lanzetta announced his discovery, the
new head of NASA, Sean O'Keefe, announced that because the
international space station is billions of dollars over budget, the
space agency may cut back all sorts of future missions. That could
jeopardize funding for a key project needed to confirm Lanzetta's
finding: the Next Generation space telescope, a successor to the
Hubble telescope.</TE>
<TE>   Given that the U.S. budget deficit has left the nation barely able
to attend to such priorities as health care, telescopes may seem like
an extravagance. But as Lanzetta's research suggests, sometimes the
only way of solving earthly problems is by exploring cosmic
questions.</TE>

<DL>CONCORD, N.H.</DL>
<LD>A clergyman who has sought six times to become the Episcopal Church's
first openly gay bishop may try again when New Hampshire's bishop
retires in 2004.</LD>
<LD>   Search committee guidelines for the next bishop will be released
later this year.</LD>
<LD>   "It would be fair to say that I'm very open to the possibility,"
said the Rev. Canon Gene Robinson, assistant to the current bishop,
the Right Rev. Douglas Theuner. "My being gay is rarely alluded to by
me or the congregation."</LD>
<TE>   The Episcopal Church is divided over homosexual clergy and
same-sex unions. A 1979 church resolution that discourages
homosexuality is not binding church law, so dioceses set their own
policies.</TE>

42,000 unsolicited copies of the film "Jesus" to every household in
four Seattle-area ZIP Codes.</LD>
<LD>   Local churches, including Roman Catholic, Lutheran and other
denominations, spent more than two years raising $115,000 to fund the
video project, which begins this month. The 1979 film depicts the
life of Christ, according to the Gospel of St. Luke.</LD>
<LD>   The churches plan a mass-mailing to six more ZIP Codes in October.</LD>
<TE>   Groups in California and other states have sent out about 14
million "Jesus" videos. Campus Crusade for Christ International, an

<DL></DL>
<LD>Every year, UCLA students hang shirts at its Clothesline Project for
victims of domestic violence. In 2000, I hung a shirt for my friend
who had been repeatedly assaulted by his wife. She would get drunk
and then kick him, throw objects at him and even attack him while he
slept. Once, she broke his teeth by hurling an ashtray. Their two
kids witnessed everything.</LD>
<LD>   I won't forget seeing my shirt hang there--the only shirt
representing a male victim among hundreds of female victims. It
reminded me of the isolation my friend felt as a man experiencing
domestic abuse.</LD>
<LD>   He wouldn't hit back because he was raised a gentleman. He
wouldn't call the police because he was ashamed. He also feared that
his wife would falsely accuse him of abusing her, turning the tables
on the truth. The stigma and fear he faced left him feeling he had
little choice but to just take it. And that he did.</LD>
<TE>   Eventually it was me who couldn't take it. I called the hotlines
for help. The only shelter that would accept a male was the Valley
Oasis in Lancaster. It was too far for my friend, who was afraid to
leave his children in his wife's care. The hotline said the only
option was a motel or a homeless shelter, neither of which offered
the counseling or other services he needed.</TE>
<TE>   So he wound up receiving no help, and the violence continued.</TE>
<TE>   Valley Oasis director Carol Ensign told me she had seen men come
from as far as the East Coast because of the lack of services for
males but that most male victims are like my friend and don't seek
help.</TE>
<TE>   Studies bear out her conclusion. About 15% of the domestic
violence complaints are filed by men, but Justice Department
statistics from 1998 indicate that men are the victims of domestic
violence 39% of the time.</TE>
<TE>   Whether men are the victims 15% or 50% of the time shouldn't
matter. No victim should be ignored. But gender politics have
contributed to years of downplaying male victims and helped leave men
like my friend out in the cold.</TE>
<TE>   For example, many people insist that when a woman strikes a man,
it is done in self-defense. This is untrue. When surveys asked about
self-defense, about 85% of women who were violent said they struck
their male partner out of jealousy, on impulse or under the influence
of drugs and alcohol, not self-defense.</TE>
<TE>   Others minimize the risk to men by saying women don't cause as
much physical harm when they strike men. Violence--any violence--is
bad. The severity is irrelevant.</TE>
<TE>   Even minor violence is harmful to children who see it. And when
they grow up to batter their own partners as a result, it won't
matter whether they saw Daddy hitting Mommy or vice versa.</TE>
<TE>   Ignoring male victims does not help women; it only promotes the
cycle of violence we say we want to end.</TE>
<TE>   Thankfully, L.A. County has one of the few shelters that helps
male victims. But one shelter out in the desert will hardly put a
dent in the cycle. We need a shelter close to the city.</TE>
<TE>   I can only hope that as more men seek help, maybe my shirt won't
feel so ostracized. Until then, it'll just have to hang alone.</TE>

<HD>Race, Not Equity, Is Behind the UC System's 4% Rule</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROGER ARNOLD</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Why does the University of California discriminate against students
who go to the wrong high schools?</LD>
<LD>   The wrong high school is one with a high percentage of high
achievers, which makes the right high school the one with a high
percentage of low achievers.</LD>
<LD>   Here are the details: In fall 2001, the UC system implemented the
Eligibility in Local Context program, commonly known as the 4%
program. Under this program, the top 4% of students in each
participating California high school class are guaranteed admission
to one of the eight UC general campuses. Five of the eight campuses
are among the top 10 public universities in the nation; UC Berkeley
is ranked No. 1.</LD>
<TE>   What the program says to high school students is this: If you are
a high achiever in a school of low achievers you have a better chance
of being admitted to the UC system than if you are a high achiever in
a school of high achievers.</TE>
<TE>   To understand how this plays out, consider two students in two
high schools, A and B. The median grade point average in high school
A is 3.30; the median grade point average in high school B is 3.90.
Joe, who attends high school A, has a GPA of 3.80, which puts him in
the top 4% of students. Erica, who attends high school B, has a GPA
of 4.30, which puts her just outside the top 4%. Both Joe and Erica
desperately want to attend a UC school. Come fall, Joe will but Erica
will not.</TE>
<TE>   Erica wonders why Joe, with a lower GPA, was admitted to the UC
system and she was not.</TE>
<TE>   The UC system says the plan was developed to recognize that
student achievement is relative to the educational opportunities
available at individual schools.</TE>
<TE>   Student achievement may be relative--but within individual
schools? Why not within a given city or state?</TE>
<TE>   If the UC system had chosen a larger pool--such as the state--it
could not then do what it really wants to do: choose students based
on race. The fact is, the smaller the pool, the more race comes into
play. Just as families are more racially homogeneous than any given
school, any given school is more racially homogeneous than any given
state.</TE>
<TE>   If your objective is to choose students according to race, you
want the smallest politically acceptable unit that is racially
homogeneous. That's the school.</TE>
<TE>   If the University of California didn't want the school and only
the school to matter, it would admit the top 4% of students in each
high school only if each student achieved a certain ranking on the
SAT. But it doesn't do this because bringing the SAT into the picture
moves the pool from small (school) to big (country) and therefore
diminishes the role race plays.</TE>
<TE>   The University of California knows what it is doing. It knows that
it is choosing students based on race. It knows that it is "taxing"
some students and "subsidizing" others.</TE>
<TE>   It knows that the Ericas of the world exist. It simply doesn't
care. And furthermore, it believes that what it wants to do is the
morally right thing to do.</TE>
<TE>   That is the part that rankles.</TE>

<LD>Re "Homeless, Helpless, Hopeless," Jan. 12: The surge in evictions
across the country illustrates the depth of the economy's recession.
Is there anything more noticeable and pitiable than seeing homes
emptied of personal possessions piled high on curbs? It's mute and
vivid evidence of the eviction syndrome now extant. And it is not a
pretty sight. With today's wrangling in Washington about cutting
taxes and refunding taxes already collected and the concurrent
rhetoric about cutting government services, what could be more out of
line, cruel-hearted and wrongheaded?</LD>
<LD>   The people so affected by the recession ought to expect their
government to be helping out, doing for people what they cannot do

<LD>   The bottom-line question is, where do the eviction victims go and
what can they do without the government's help? For one thing, can
this "tax cut and refund" rhetoric. Use the revenue income to help
these affected people get a roof over their heads, a place where they
can at least survive until they can get jobs to pay for the shelter
they require for minimum sustenance.</LD>

<TE>   While we are keeping those in other countries as safe, warm and
well fed as possible, our eyes are averted from the crisis of
displaced workers and others who make up the homeless and hungry
throughout the United States. Massive assistance is distributed by
our government to countries that have desperate needs. Tents,
blankets, medicine and food are sent throughout the world while, at
home, this same largess for our own people is sorely wanting or
nonexistent.</TE>
<TE>   Charitable organizations struggle to keep their heads above water
but are drowning in pleas for help. Food banks are all but empty,
people are unable to heat their homes--just as more and more people
are forced to live in cars or on the street. Welfare is a dirty word,
and unemployment benefits are slow in coming or don't come at all.</TE>
<TE>   This situation is not due to earthquakes, fires or like disasters
but, quite simply, to a downturn in our economy, and we must treat it
as we would any other calamity.</TE>

<LD>I was totally disgusted reading about the weak manner in which the
U.S. wields its military power in response to the most violent
provocation in our history as a nation (''Fear of Civilian Deaths May
Have Undermined Effort,'' Jan. 16). I knew from the minute this whole
campaign began that we would never capture Bin Laden or effectively
put the terrorists out of business.</LD>
<LD>   As a nation still led by guilt-ridden, upper-middle-class
Caucasians, we are simply unable to be tough, because we fear being
labeled as racists. The same ''culture of hesitation'' regarding the
military affects our entire judicial system, immigration enforcement,
education establishment and workplaces. Caucasians in positions of
authority in such institutions are totally incapable of calling bad
things bad, good things good and untruths lies. Political correctness
is a poison to a nation's cohesiveness and resolve.</LD>

<TE>   I was appalled by your article, in which military sources complain
about not being able to bomb anything that moved (''interdicting
moving targets'') and offer no rationale for the claim that such
caution raises the long-term cost in lives.</TE>
<TE>   A war on terrorism is by definition an effort to avoid the deaths
of civilians. Therefore, it is absolute nonsense to whine, as
nine-tenths of the article does, because concern about innocent
people ''influence[s] wartime decisions,'' thus somehow infringing on
command prerogative. I believe that most of our brave men and women
in uniform understand that.</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth Palmberg</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As we debate whether to extend the use of military force beyond
Afghanistan, we should acknowledge that we have to get as close as
possible to casualty-free wars, because that is the only chance for
an all-volunteer force to work. This nation's large and politically
potent upper-middle class is not about to have its privileged sons
herded off to become privates. We must be careful not to confuse
facile patriotism with any willingness to make sacrifices. I do not
know how President Bush could ask the people of this nation to have
their children forcibly taken from them while the noblest duty
otherwise is to spend tax cuts on domestic travel.</TE>
<TE>   It is little wonder ''God Bless America'' has become so popular;
requesting protection from a deity is certainly easier than
requisitioning money or combatants.</TE>

<LD>William F. Devine ("Unchain Those College Ballplayers," Commentary,
Jan. 15) urges that, in the name of justice, collegiate male football
players get paid. Fine, but he fails to urge one other crucial step:
Stop requiring that the players be students. By acknowledging that
those athletes are employees whose academics matter to nobody but
themselves, universities could finally cut the Gordian knot of
hypocrisy in collegiate athletics.</LD>
<LD>   That would be the right course of action for all
revenue-generating sports, at least, which would cover men's football
and basketball. Offer the athletes tuition breaks if they want to
attend classes but let them continue to play--and collect their
salaries--if they flunk. The fans certainly don't care about
academics and the schools would continue to reap profits.</LD>
<LD>   The NCAA could stop many of its apparently silly investigations.
And schools that want "traditional" football should eliminate all
athletic scholarships and other benefits as well as all postseason
games.</LD>
<TE>   Finally, the corruption of academia engendered by the current
practices would be stopped.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Datz</TE>
<TE>   Altadena</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With the average price of a college education approaching six
figures, a college football player should be grateful for a free
education, not to mention a chance to cash out in the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike over-pampered jocks, the majority of college students don't
receive full athletic or academic scholarships. If a player feels
he's being treated unfairly, let him renounce the scholarship, apply
for financial aid and a student loan and get a part- or full-time job
to cover his expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, exploitation doesn't look so bad anymore, does it?</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence Tonsick</TE>
<TE>   Arcadia</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If the young athletes Devine believes are being exploited by
big-time college sports feel the same way, they're free to quit and
join the rest of us trying to get ahead in the real world. Even
gifted, college-level tight ends and point guards are ultimately a
dime a dozen, so replacing them would be easy.</TE>
<TE>   And the simple truth is, alumni interest is going to keep overall
TV ratings for college sports more or less the same, regardless of
whether the quality of play on the field (court) diminishes by a
degree or two.</TE>
<TE>   So, if the roughly $100,000 value of a four-year college education
and a priceless opportunity to impress professional scouts isn't
enough for college athletes, I challenge them--and the silly folks
like Devine who counsel them--to pick up the want ads and try finding
a better gig.</TE>

<HD>Enron in the White House</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Enron debacle sheds light on the parochial thinking that
dominates this administration's approach to energy. Enron Chairman
Kenneth L. Lay is (or was) a friend of the president and of many key
members of his administration. He was by all accounts a major
contributor to the energy policy that was formed by the
administration, a process that occurred behind closed doors and that
Vice President Dick Cheney refuses to open to public scrutiny. This
energy plan was clearly crafted to benefit the oil executives.</LD>
<LD>   Lay's and his fellow executives' actions at Enron expose the moral
hypocrisy of these gentlemen. They withheld critical information from
the public, deluded investors and employees about the true status of
Enron, cashed in their own holdings while they still had value and at
the same time prevented their own employees from selling Enron stock.
Thousands of people lost their jobs, and other thousands lost their
retirement savings.</LD>
<LD>   Given the demonstrated lack of scruples of Lay and his fellow
executives, any input that they provided to the energy plan is to be
distrusted. The plan should be scrapped and a new effort to define an
energy policy should be initiated that is open and includes
participation by all relevant parties, not just energy executives.</LD>
<TE>   Paul W. Rosenberger</TE>
<TE>   Manhattan Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Enron and Bush's energy policy may end the romance this country is
having with our present administration. If that doesn't do it, try
living in an all-electric home, where the utility rates have risen
$100 a month. In an indirect way, we are all victims of this latest
scandal.</TE>
<TE>   Bea Morrow</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The relationship between the Bush administration and Enron was far
too cozy to expect the Justice Department to aggressively carry out
its duties. This administration ignored Enron's gouging of
Californians over the mock "energy crisis" while Cheney met with
Enron to concoct the Bush energy policy. Cheney continues to defy his
own government's requests for notes of those meetings. Atty. Gen.
John Ashcroft has already had to recuse himself, and his deputy
formerly worked for a law firm that represented Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Only a special prosecutor will satisfy the American public's right
that justice be done. If the Republicans can support the need for an
independent counsel to investigate Whitewater, Troopergate,
Travelgate and all the other "scandals" that never happened,
certainly they should join the rest of us who demand to know if this
administration is as corrupt as it openly appears.</TE>

<TE>   I find Rex Rabin's cartoon (Commentary, Jan. 15), which depicts
Ken Starr lamenting he wound up with Whitewater rather than the
presumably more substantive Enron case, quite bizarre.</TE>
<TE>   Starr's investigation of Whitewater, which morphed into
Monicagate, was from the get-go about one thing only: neutralizing
President Clinton by all means short of assassination. In contrast,
the Enron scandal is all about the wealthy and powerful in this
country exploiting their privileged positions for further
self-enrichment at the expense of the middle and lower classes. Why
on Earth does Rabin think Starr would be against that?</TE>

<HD>LAUSD's Building Blocks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Carol Lynn Mithers' "LAUSD's Building Fantasy" (Opinion, Jan. 13) is
one example of the incompetence of Supt. Roy Romer, his predecessors
and the rest of the LAUSD's leadership when it comes to running and
building schools. Another example: San Pedro High School, a school
that is probably treated better than most. Over the past 10 years,
the district has added bungalow after bungalow to the campus until
there is literally room for no more. There are no more open spaces
outside of the athletic field and no student parking lot. The
employee parking lot is far too small to accommodate the hundreds of
employees. We local residents can no longer park in front of, or even
near, our own houses during a school day.</LD>
<LD>   Does the increased capacity--3,600 students on a campus originally
designed for 1,800--help the local community? Hardly. The district
simply buses in students from other areas, causing even more of a
traffic problem for residents, adding to local pollution levels and
forcing teachers to move from room to room during the day, since
there are still not enough classrooms for the teachers required for
the increased enrollment. All of this was done without an
environmental impact report, as the district simply added only a
certain number of bungalows per year so as to not trigger the
requirement.</LD>
<TE>   The district refuses to admit there is a problem, and even local
board member Mike Lansing has been silent on the issue. In the
meantime, the campus looks awful, the list of improvements for
Proposition BB has disappeared (even though things like air
conditioning were promised but not installed) and we have been told
by district representatives that absolutely nothing will be done.</TE>
<TE>   It is time for Romer to be held responsible for the mess he both
inherited and created. He was hired to turn things around, yet all we
have to show for it is expensive cluster offices with less local
control than ever before. And our "reform" board members? Don't even
start.</TE>

<TE>   LAUSD reminds me of a parent trying to feed 100 siblings with a
gallon of milk. There's just not enough to go around. Until the
district is broken up, those parents thinking of sending their
children to an LAUSD school might do best to think of it as a co-op.
LAUSD provides some buildings, some salaries and some standards, but
parents had better expect to do the rest themselves.</TE>

<LD>I read with great interest "Air Marshals' Future Full of Questions"
(Jan. 14) and was dismayed, but not surprised, by the airline
industry's attitude as represented by Douglas Laird, a former
security director for Northwest Airlines. Laird seems to think air
marshals are too expensive, bad for the industry's image and that
passengers can defend themselves.</LD>
<LD>   As for the expense, ask the U.S. government how much money is
being set aside to help the families of those who died on Sept. 11.
Ask those families how much their loved ones' lives were worth. Ask
the over 2.5 million people who are projected to lose their jobs as a
direct result of those terrorist attacks if the cost of maintaining
an Air Marshal Corps is too high. As for passengers defending
themselves, ask the heroes of United Airlines Flight 93 if they would
have rather had air marshals on board to protect them . . . oops,
never mind.</LD>

<TE>   1. Offer and require a real training program (including a GED,
where necessary). A 40-page handbook is not going to cut it.</TE>
<TE>   2. Pay them a living wage. Minimum wage will never buy a lot of
loyalty and concern, and people have families to care for.</TE>
<TE>   3. Put them into professional-looking, well-fitting uniforms that
will command respect--as one sees in many British and European
airports.</TE>
<TE>   The people who don't want the training program can move on; the
people who do will be able to do a better job. It couldn't hurt.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Clinton Says U.S. Must Give More to End Terrorism," Jan. 15: To
put a terse article on Page B4 when an eight-year duly elected
president of the United States (POTUS long before pretzels became
popular) speaks to a sold-out (6,000 people) group of admirers and
constituents (not just Jews, although the University of Judaism had
the moxie and intelligence to bring him to us) is to me (an old
Episcopalian lady Democrat) unconscionable of The Times!</LD>
<LD>   Yes, 6,000 of us jumped to our feet at the sight of
him--applauded, whistled, yelled, and this old lady shed tears to
boot. For the first time in a year, I felt a calm joy and optimism in
my heart. Former President Clinton is wise, thoughtful, sincere, kind
and hopeful enough to ease the panic we feel over the bumbling,
self-serving inexperience of the current administration. I came out
of the Universal Amphitheatre smiling, and thinking that the world
might still have a chance.</LD>

<TE>   Clinton suggests some redistribution of our considerable wealth
and informs us that half the world's population lives on less than $2
per day. I wonder if he waived his lecture fee, reported to be "in
the neighborhood" of $100,000, to support 50,000 of the world's poor
for a day; or if the NBA would waive Shaq's $714,285.72 fine and
support 357,142 of the world's poor?</TE>

<LD>Thank you for your coverage of the Israeli army's demolition of
refugee homes on the Gaza side on the border with Egypt ("Gaza
Operation Draws Unusual Criticism in Israel," Jan. 14). What was
appalling to me was Foreign Minister Shimon Peres' statement: "The
destruction of homes causes us very bad media damage." The Israeli
army razes 52 houses and renders 411 people homeless in the dead of
winter, committing a war crime and constituting a grave breach of the
Geneva Convention, which protects civilians under occupation, and
Peres is concerned about bad media damage?</LD>
<LD>   How can we, as U.S. citizens, respond to the average Palestinian
who truly wants peace but also feels that our U.S. government has
given Israel the green light to destroy Palestinian homes and
infrastructure? Application of international law and the presence of
U.N. observers in that area is a must if we are hoping for a
sustainable peace in that highly explosive region of the world.</LD>

<TE>   One sign of a healthy democracy in a country is the freedom of its
citizens to voice their opinions regarding the actions and policies
of their government. I doubt whether the Palestinians would have an
opportunity to debate the correctness of Katyusha rockets landing on
homes in Tel Aviv and other cities throughout Israel. Had these
weapons been successfully smuggled through the Rafah tunnels or by
cargo ships off the Gaza Strip, the criticism in Israel would be
about the government not doing enough to protect its citizens.</TE>

<LD>Matthew Miller laments that the Democrats are playing "a game of
inches" instead of going for the whole socialist enchilada
(Commentary, Jan. 11). Big news. The left has been playing the game
of incrementalism for decades: slowly chipping away at our liberties,
gradually eroding the Constitution, ratcheting up the size of
government and the tax burden. Each new outrage is used as the basis
for yet more intrusive measures. None of these odious programs or
laws is ever repealed or questioned--even when they fail.</LD>
<LD>   So a game of inches is nothing new to Miller and his fellow
travelers. It's what they do best.</LD>

<LD>We need to applaud Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham's decision to
declare Yucca Mountain fit for the storage of nuclear waste as a
much-needed push toward solving the waste problem ("Nevada Site
Picked for Nuclear Waste," Jan. 11). In this environment there is
little objective information, with even the driest technical reports
causing controversy. Yet all this rhetoric belies two facts. Leaving
spent nuclear fuel scattered across the country at nuclear plant
sites is poor environmental management and lousy economics.</LD>
<LD>   Gathering the material in one, federally controlled site is
cost-effective, assures the safe, monitored storage of the material
and is required by contract between the government and the utilities.
Current plans call for the spent fuel to be retrievable from the
Yucca Mountain facility for at least 50 years, which would allow us
to deal with the fuel in a different manner should more attractive
options arise.</LD>

<LD>I was impressed by "Salving a Workplace Pain" (editorial, Jan. 14),
on repetitive motion injuries. I am 66 and have done hard physical
labor, raised, fed and trained horses and moved heavy items all my
life. I now work with a computer.</LD>
<LD>   About 18 months ago I got a pain in my right shoulder from using
the mouse and typing. I am still exercising and working on getting
back to normal. I have to use my left hand on the mouse. I can hardly
move my right hand when writing and assist it with my left. I can
hardly read my own writing.</LD>
<LD>   I was always skeptical of repetitive motion injuries, but no more;
they are real and the worst I have experienced in my life--pain when
I move my arm, throbbing at night and when sitting or walking. Typing
and keeping client files on the computer is a real struggle.</LD>

<HD>Tax Cut: a Walk on the Sunny Side of the Street</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I would like to second the contents of Ronald Brownstein's column,
"New Era Means Trimming Tax Cut" (Jan. 14), in which he tells us why
the Bush administration's $1.35-trillion tax cut should be modified.
In crafting this tax cut, members of the Bush administration
projected only the most enthusiastic, improbable scenario imaginable.
They were told that bad things happen that could throw their
projections into a turmoil and deny necessary funds to Social
Security, national defense and security and the health and welfare of
the populace. They ignored this advice, and sure enough, bad things
did happen. The sin of the Bush administration, and President Bush
himself, was that they did not make allowance for negative events.
Then when those events did happen, Bush cried, "Don't blame me."</LD>
<LD>   Robert L. Fox</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brownstein opines that a recession means that the tax cut must be
trimmed back. If this sentiment weren't being echoed by Sen. Hillary
Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.) and given tacit acceptance by Senate Majority
Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), one might wonder if Brownstein were the
alter ego of Herbert Hoover. Let's forget about the economic stimulus
of a tax cut; raise taxes and contract the economy. That was the
Hoover strategy, and while it did wonders for fiscal rectitude, it
gored the working man.</TE>
<TE>   It has been 70 years since Hoover and the advent of homeless
encampments then referred to as Hoovervilles. Perhaps if Clinton and
Brownstein are successful in their quest and unemployment goes off
the charts, we could name the resulting homeless encampments
Daschle-villes. Or even Hillary-villes.</TE>

<HD>Innocence Project Honors 100th Freed Inmate</HD>
<DH>Courts: Larry Mayes, who served 21 years in an Indiana
prison for rape, was cleared by DNA. 'I'm just hurt. I'm not angry,'
he says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>For 21 years, Larry Mayes served time in an Indiana prison for a
crime he did not commit. His father, daughter and brother all died as
he maintained his innocence.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, three weeks after DNA testing cleared his name, the
52-year-old celebrated his return to civilian life while the
Innocence Project, which worked to secure his release, marked the
100th time it has freed an innocent person.</LD>
<LD>   "I always knew I was innocent. It was just a matter of time until
I could get someone to listen to me," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Mayes' comments came at the start of a three-day conference on the
so-called innocence movement--an effort supported by a coalition of
about 30 groups to investigate allegations of wrongful convictions
and push for reform of the justice system.</TE>
<TE>   Since the first Innocence Project was founded a decade ago by
defense attorneys Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld, the number of
overturned convictions has steadily increased. More than 20 people
were cleared last year.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Neufeld and others said they believe that the number of
people exonerated represents a fraction of those wrongly held, who
could number in the thousands.</TE>
<TE>   "We're here today to declare that there are innocent people in
prison, and we're here to talk about what we need to do about it,"
said Justin Brooks, director of the California Innocence Project at
the California Western School of Law, where the conference is being
held.</TE>
<TE>   Overturning a conviction is difficult. Cases are typically
reviewed by volunteer attorneys, who receive more claims than they
can handle. In about three-fourths of cases, key evidence is lost or
has been destroyed. In others, there is no DNA to analyze.</TE>
<TE>   To reduce the number of false convictions, attorneys at the
conference support such measures as eliminating witness lineups,
which can produce false identifications, and requiring police
interviews to be videotaped.</TE>
<TE>   Lost evidence nearly thwarted Mayes' release. Convicted in 1980
for raping a woman at an Indiana gas station, he was sentenced to 80
years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   He contacted the Innocence Project in the late 1990s after
learning about the group on a television talk show.</TE>
<TE>   Law students who took up his case were repeatedly told that a rape
kit from the case was lost. When the evidence eventually resurfaced,
DNA testing cleared Mayes.</TE>
<TE>   He was released Dec. 21 and works as a dishwasher at a truck stop.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just hurt. I'm not angry," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Marvin Anderson had a similar story. The African American man was
found guilty in 1982 of raping a white woman in Hanover County, Va.</TE>
<TE>   An all-white jury convicted him based on a single eyewitness, even
though he had an alibi. During his 15-year incarceration, another
inmate came forward to admit that he had committed the crime, but a
judge refused to believe him. DNA evidence proved Anderson's
innocence in December, making him the Innocence Project's 99th
exoneration.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels wonderful," he said of having his name cleared.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a blessing I was waiting for."</TE>

<HD>Prison Board Told Killer Is 'Worth Sparing'</HD>
<DH>Hearing: Lawyers appeal for clemency for Stephen Wayne
Anderson, who is scheduled to be executed this month.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC BAILEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Sketching the portrait of a changed and remorseful man, attorneys for
death row inmate Stephen Wayne Anderson pleaded for clemency Friday,
while prosecutors urged the state Board of Prison Terms to press
ahead with the execution this month.</LD>
<LD>   Unless Gov. Gray Davis intervenes, Anderson, 48, is slated to die
in San Quentin's death chamber Jan. 29 for the 1980 murder of
Elizabeth Lyman, an 81-year-old former piano teacher, in San
Bernardino.</LD>
<LD>   The prison board will make a confidential recommendation to Davis,
but Anderson's attorneys hold out little hope that the governor will
veer from his standard practice of rejecting clemency appeals.</LD>
<TE>   "This is, after all, an election year, and [Davis] has said if you
kill someone, forget it. No mercy," Margo Rocconi, one of Anderson's
lawyers, told the board during a two-hour hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson's life is "worth sparing," Rocconi said, because of the
remorse he has expressed and the desire of several members of Lyman's
family to see the death sentence commuted to life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Lance Lindsey, executive director of the national anti-execution
group Death Penalty Focus, told the board it should brush aside
political considerations because Anderson's record and the facts of
the case make clemency "politically safe" for the governor. Calling
it "not the most heinous case," Lindsey said the governor can
"demonstrate he has compassion."</TE>
<TE>   But a San Bernardino County prosecutor said that more than two
decades of reflection on the facts of the murder by state and federal
courts was sufficient, and that Anderson should die.</TE>
<TE>   "Twenty-one years has been enough," said David Whitney, lead
deputy prosecutor with the district attorney's major crimes unit. "It
has been said that justice delayed is justice denied. In this case,
it is time for justice."</TE>
<TE>   Whitney also noted that ballistics tests concluded that Lyman had
been shot at a distance of 8 to 20 inches, countering Anderson's
contention that he reacted reflexively when the elderly woman
appeared as he was burglarizing her house. He noted that Anderson
watched television in Lyman's living room and even prepared macaroni
in her home after the slaying.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a cold, calculated murder," Whitney said. "And that's
pretty heinous to me."</TE>
<TE>   The hearing followed a decision Thursday by a federal judge in San
Francisco to reject defense efforts to remove the governor from
considering Anderson's clemency petition. Defense lawyers believe
Davis has demonstrated a politically inspired bias against murderers.
They have appealed the decision to the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of
Appeals.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson's attorneys said that he had poor defense representation
during his trial, and that three jurors now believe he should not be
executed.</TE>
<TE>   Rocconi said Anderson's rocky youth in a family home that was
"turbulent, abusive and loveless" contrasts sharply with his efforts
to turn around his life in prison. Anderson has written hundreds of
poems and a play that was produced in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "Stephen Anderson is a different person than he was 21 years ago,"
Rocconi said. "Taking his life now makes little sense."</TE>
<TE>   Sister Mary Christine McNamara, a Catholic nun who has visited
Anderson on death row for 14 years, said the convicted murderer is
working desperately now to finish a novel before his execution.</TE>
<TE>   "Stephen bothers with it because he has chosen life," McNamara
said, pleading with the board to demonstrate that "murder, whether in
the death chamber or an impulsive act like Stephen's, is not the way
to solve problems."</TE>
<TE>   Whitney, the prosecutor, countered that he hoped the prison board
would not "buy into this notion he's a changed man."</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor said Anderson had bragged he was a "born killer."
If the convict had indeed changed, "then God bless him," Whitney
said. "But it's not about what's good for him."</TE>

<HD>Minimum Wage Is Not Enough, Riordan Says</HD>
<DH>Campaign: 'How can somebody live on $6.75 an hour?' he
asks. Meanwhile, Jones assails his opponent's record.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN and MARK Z. BARABAK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>PALM DESERT</DL>
<LD>Gubernatorial candidate Richard Riordan said Friday that California's
minimum wage of $6.75 an hour is too low for a person to make ends
meet, but declined to say whether he would support an increase.</LD>
<LD>   "How can somebody live on $6.75 an hour?" Riordan asked during a
visit to a citrus-packing plant in Riverside.</LD>
<LD>   "You can't.... In fact, you can't live on $10 an hour."</LD>
<TE>   As Riordan was stumping in Riverside County, Bill Jones, a rival
in the March 5 GOP primary, was assailing his record as mayor of Los
Angeles in a speech to Sacramento business leaders. The third major
GOP candidate, Bill Simon Jr., held a closed-door fund-raiser Friday
with former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan's remarks on the minimum wage came in response to concerns
raised by managers of the Blue Banner citrus plant, where he watched
assembly line workers sort oranges on a conveyor belt.</TE>
<TE>   As thousands of oranges rolled by on the rumbling machinery, Blue
Banner Vice President Vince Mazzetti told Riordan that increases in
the state's minimum wage since Gov. Gray Davis took office in 1999
have forced the company to lay off 95 people.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to look out for the company," Mazzetti said. "If the
company goes under, everybody's out of a job, not only those 95."</TE>
<TE>   California's hourly minimum wage, one of the nation's highest, has
risen $1 since Davis took office. The state Industrial Welfare
Commission approved the two 50-cent increases in October 2000. Davis,
a Democrat seeking reelection in November, has welcomed the move.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan, though, was careful to avoid taking sides in an issue
that pits business against labor--two powerful constituencies in the
governor's race.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to care about the have-nots," said Riordan, a
multimillionaire philanthropist. "I do. Very deeply. But you have
to--before you take action that seems obvious--really think it
through and think, 'Is this in the benefit of the have-nots?' And the
answer is not that clear."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan said he pays more than the minimum wage to dishwashers at
the Original Pantry, his restaurant in downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the toughest job there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Riordan would not say whether he approved of the state's
latest minimum-wage increases--nor whether another was warranted.</TE>
<TE>   "You've just got to look at the whole equation at each moment in
time and do the best you can to predict the effect on the future," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe we're better off with increases, maybe we're not better
off."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan's visit to Riverside, where he held two fund-raisers on
Thursday night, was the latest stop on his statewide bus tour. From
there, he rode to Palm Desert, where he spoke to a Republican group
at a Mexican restaurant. In the parking lot, Riordan made an appeal
to elderly voters during a TV interview in front of his bus.</TE>
<TE>   "What I want to do is take people who have had major jobs as
lawyers and doctors and businesspeople, and use that expertise to
help turn California around," said Riordan, who is 71.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to set up more senior centers around the state to have
more interesting things to do. You don't give up life when you become
a so-called senior. There are so many trips you can take, so many
games you can play, and so many songs you can sing."</TE>
<TE>   In Sacramento, Riordan was the target of criticism by Jones, the
California secretary of state, at a business group's luncheon. Taking
issue with the way Riordan portrays himself in his TV ads, Jones
said, "His record in L.A. was anything but one of a vigilant leader
taking charge and solving problems.</TE>
<TE>   "When the [Metropolitan Transit Authority] went on strike [in the
fall of 2000], Dick decided it would be a good time to vacation in
France, leaving the details to others," Jones said. "When the worst
police scandal in L.A. history was engulfing the city, Dick was
nowhere to be found.</TE>
<TE>   "What he has demonstrated to date is a leadership deficit that is
close to rivaling Gov. Davis," Jones said, citing Riordan's failure
to produce detailed plans on the state budget, agriculture and water
policy.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Spillane, political director of Riordan's campaign,
dismissed Jones' comments as "overheated rhetoric from an underheated
candidate."</TE>
<TE>   "Bill Jones is concerned about falling into third place, and his
shots are getting more desperate and cheaper by the time," Spillane
said.</TE>

<LD>Thanks to the concern of some dog lovers, police dogs in Lodi now can
wear protective vests that are bullet and stab resistant.</LD>
<LD>   The new safety equipment comes courtesy of WestAmerica Bank.
Christa Steele, vice president of the bank's Stockton branch, got the
idea from a friend and neighbor who belongs to the Central Valley Top
Dog Club. The club raised money and purchased two $659 Kevlar vests
for Lathrop police dogs, and Steele decided to offer the same body
protection for Lodi's police dogs.</LD>
<LD>   Steele's husband is a California Highway Patrol officer, and her
family's pets have always been retired police dogs.</LD>

<LD>Del Norte County officials said they will do what they can to thwart
a plan by the Save the Redwoods League to buy 25,000 acres of timber,
unless the county can be compensated for tax losses.</LD>
<LD>   The league has all but secured the $60 million it needs to buy the
land, but the county said it is opposed to the deal unless it can be
compensated through an endowment fund for the tax loss.</LD>
<LD>   "The hardest amount to raise is the $2 million for the tax
endowment fund," said Kate Anderton, executive director of
Save-the-Redwoods. "I've found no money in Sacramento to fund that,
so I'm pursuing private sources."</LD>
<TE>   Even if the league is unable to fund the endowment, it plans to go

<LD>A mother wants the school district to yank a textbook that allegedly

<HD>Uniform Response</HD>
<DH>Emotions, Reception Will Be Mixed in Jordan's Return to
Chicago</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. ADANDE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>The sight of Michael Jordan in a Washington Wizard uniform, that
won't be the hard part at United Center today. I've seen him in it
before. So have the Chicago Bulls, who paid him a visit at the MCI
Center 15 days ago.</LD>
<LD>   I'm not ready for the new sound of Jordan at the United Center.</LD>
<LD>   Whenever he was introduced to the crowd at Bull games it was in a
darkened arena, with "The Eye in the Sky" blaring in the background.
Public-address announcer Ray Clay would crank up the vocal cords and
bellow, "Frrrommmm NORTH CAR-OLINA ... " and the rest would be
inaudible, drowned out by the cheers of a packed house.</LD>
<TE>   It won't sound like that when Jordan makes his return to the
United Center today.</TE>
<TE>   Clay wanted to "give them the full-blown Michael Jordan," as he
put it. "Ninety percent of the people here remember it and want it
that way," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Bull management wants it done the same way any other visitor
is announced, so Clay will give a low-key intro along the lines of,
"A 6-6 forward from North Carolina, Michael Jordan."</TE>
<TE>   Lights on, without any music.</TE>
<TE>   And from there we're not quite sure. You would expect a standing
ovation for the player who gave a success-starved city six NBA
championships and made the Bulls the dominant professional team of
the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "He'll probably get a bigger ovation than everybody here," Bull
guard Fred Hoiberg said.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the best sports figure ever to come out of Chicago, and he
deserves everything he gets."</TE>
<TE>   But Jordan did buy into the ownership group of the Wizards. And he
chose to resume his playing career with that team. With his wife
filing for divorce earlier in the month, asking for their house and
custody of the kids, the feeling is Jordan's last ties to Chicago
have been severed.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it'll be a little bit of a cool reception, after what's
been going on," said Ben Biedron, a season-ticket holder for a dozen
years. "His problems with his wife and him being owner with the
Washington Wizards, I think that will have an effect.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if I'll cheer. I'll give him a couple of claps when
he's introduced."</TE>
<TE>   Another fan, Tomek Modzelewski, said, "People love him. Still,
it's different, him being in another uniform. We can't root for him
now. He's an enemy now. [However,] we'll always thank him and be
grateful for what he's done for us and giving us six championships."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever gratitude comes from the stands will be more than the
Bulls provide. There will be no video montage or any other tribute
from the team before the game.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Schanwald, the Bulls' executive vice president of business
operations, said the team has already erected a statue of Jordan
outside the United Center and retired his jersey in an elaborate
ceremony after his first retirement. They brought out the court and
hosted a huge news conference when he retired for the second time, in
1999.</TE>
<TE>   "We've honored Michael to death," Schanwald said. "I think it's
one of those moments, it really doesn't require any artificial hype.
I think sometimes, those things, it's best to let them occur
naturally."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan--who was sentimental enough to drop to his knees and kiss
the Bulls' logo on the old Chicago Stadium court in his last
appearance there--has been strangely cold as well.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm in a different uniform," he said this week. "I'm with another
organization, and that's just the way it is."</TE>
<TE>   As much as the Bulls have feted Jordan, there's a lingering
feeling that they never quite did enough. They gave him a statue, but
maybe they should have named the arena after him. After all, there
wouldn't have been a need to build the United Center without the
seven consecutive years of sellouts Jordan created at Chicago
Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   At the very least, they could have found a place for him in the
front office.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the blame and animosity about Jordan's departure is
directed toward Bull owner Jerry Reinsdorf and General Manager Jerry
Krause. They sent the dynasty to an early demise, first by letting
Coach Phil Jackson leave (losing a him-or-me battle with Krause),
which prompted Jordan's retirement and the departure of Scottie
Pippen.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan has made it clear that he didn't want to quit then, and
that his preference was to join the Bulls' ownership.</TE>
<TE>   The Bulls' attitude toward Jordan can be downright petty. He has
been practically expunged from the team's media guide, with scant
mention of him outside of his numerous appearances in the team
records section.</TE>
<TE>   But among rank-and-file members of the organization there are no
hard feelings toward Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad he's back playing, if that's what he loves to do," said
John Ligmanowski, the Bulls' longtime equipment manager.</TE>
<TE>   He hasn't assigned anybody to Jordan's old locker, which stays
empty in a kind of silent tribute. And he has helped the Wizards'
equipment managers with the Jordan details, such as where to get his
sweatbands and the fact that he likes to wear a brand-new pair of
shoes every game. Ligmanowski even sent them Jordan's preferred style
of athletic supporter by special delivery when they couldn't find it
anywhere in Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Clay, the PA announcer, said: "I'm really looking forward to him
coming back. Granted, I wish he was in red and black. But blue fits
him a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   After all, he did wear blue when he was in college, at NORTH
CAR-OLINA, as Clay would say it.</TE>
<TE>   Or at least, how he used to say it.</TE>

<HD>Gannon Likes His Position</HD>
<DH>AFC: Raider quarterback began his career by refusing to
play safety for the Patriots as a rookie.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>FOXBORO, Mass.</DL>
<LD>This isn't the first time the New England Patriots have stood in Rich
Gannon's way.</LD>
<LD>   The first time, they did it by drafting him.</LD>
<LD>   In 1987, the Patriots thought the prolific Delaware quarterback
might make a fine NFL safety, and took him in the fourth round.</LD>
<TE>   "At the time, I think Raymond Berry was the head coach, and he
called me and he said, 'We are excited to have you and we're just
looking for the best position for you,'" Gannon said.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, right then and there I knew that it wasn't quarterback."</TE>
<TE>   Gannon balked, forcing a trade to the Minnesota Vikings by
refusing to change positions.</TE>
<TE>   His boldness is probably the reason he is in his 14th season as an
NFL quarterback, arguing passionately with Raider Coach Jon Gruden on
the sidelines instead of arguing cases in court.</TE>
<TE>   "I told them I probably wouldn't report to mini-camp," Gannon
said. "You know, I would go to law school before I would [change
positions]."</TE>
<TE>   It's long ago and far away now, but at 36, Gannon has come back
around to face the Patriots tonight in wintry Foxboro Stadium for the
right to advance to the AFC championship game against Pittsburgh or
Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, no one really is left with that organization," said
Gannon, who went on to play for the Vikings, Redskins and Chiefs
before reaching the apex of his career with the Raiders. "Coaches,
general managers, owners, everybody is different."</TE>
<TE>   The only frosty feelings will be on the field, with temperatures
in the 20s for the 8 p.m. EST kickoff--and snow is predicted.</TE>
<TE>   It's a game the Boston Globe dubbed Old Men against Old Man
Winter, but the vintage Raiders--Gannon and future Hall of Fame
receivers Jerry Rice and Tim Brown--will pit their experience against
the upstart Patriots, who recovered from an 0-2 start to win the AFC
East.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we had a championship game in Chicago one year there, and
no one expected us to be able to function in the cold," said Rice,
who crossed the San Francisco Bay this season after leaving the
49ers.</TE>
<TE>   "I think exactly what Rich said: If it rains, then it's a factor.
Otherwise, under conditions like that, we'll be able to function."</TE>
<TE>   New England has its own quarterback story after Tom Brady took
over for the injured Drew Bledsoe, then usurped him when Bledsoe was
ready to return.</TE>
<TE>   But the game is widely seen as a contest of wits between the
offense-minded Gruden and Patriot Coach Bill Belichick, the defensive
mastermind whose defense has been rigid in the red zone but ranked
third worst in the AFC in yardage, giving up 334 yards a game.</TE>
<TE>   The variety of defenses can be daunting.</TE>
<TE>   "You only have so many minutes in a practice to prepare, and you
see the 3-4 with Willie McGinest and Bryan Cox and Roman Phifer and
[Mike] Vrabel on the field, and then the next play you see a 4-3
defense and then you see a nickel defense on first down," Gruden
said.</TE>
<TE>   Nasty weather, if it materializes, could put more emphasis on the
running games.</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots salvaged Antowain Smith from Buffalo and got a
1,000-yard season from him.</TE>
<TE>   The Raiders' running game was resurgent in last week's wild-card
victory over the New York Jets, when Charlie Garner rushed for 158
yards after a late-season slump.</TE>
<TE>   The Raiders went 10-6, swooning to lose four of their last six
regular-season games, but are a victory from reaching the AFC title
game for a second consecutive year. (They lost to Baltimore last
season.)</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots won 11 of their last 14, but have played only one
game since Dec. 22, their season final against 1-15 Carolina on Jan.
6.</TE>
<TE>   "With all due respect to Carolina, Oakland's a real good offensive
football team," Belichick said.</TE>
<TE>   The Raiders were especially so last week, when Rice caught nine
passes for 183 yards and hardly looked 39 years old.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a huge challenge for us, and I think our defensive players
have seen it from when we started looking at Oakland last week and
going over the scouting report," Belichick said.</TE>
<TE>   For Gannon, tonight will be about getting to the AFC title
game--not about reliving the Patriots' long-ago error.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't really consider New England one of the stops on my
journey in my career because I actually never really spent any time
there," he said. "A lot has changed and a lot has happened in the 15
years since I was drafted."</TE>

<LD>It's a bit odd that the NFL's top defensive rookie rarely plays in
passing situations, but it's something he intends to change.</LD>
<LD>   Soon.</LD>
<LD>   "Next year," said Kendrell Bell, a linebacker who is a big part of
the difference between the way the Pittsburgh Steelers' defense
performed last season and the way it has stifled offenses during a
13-3 season.</LD>
<TE>   "This is the wrong time to be doing a lot of changes."</TE>
<TE>   For now, Bell, an Augusta, Ga., native, is perfectly happy to sit
on third-and-long situations, because pass coverage is his weakness.</TE>
<TE>   The Steelers' coaching staff is equally satisfied at the moment to
have him put vicious hits on running backs coming up the middle and
for him to rush the quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   Taken 39 picks into the draft, he has recorded nine sacks, 151/2
tackles for lost yardage and 88 tackles overall. Those numbers were
good enough to earn him the top defensive rookie honor earlier this
week, as well as a Pro Bowl alternate designation.</TE>
<TE>   "No one has made a bigger contribution to their team than he has
to ours," Pittsburgh Coach Bill Cowher said. "His ability to play at
a high level for 16 games has been a credit to him and his
teammates."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Partial sunshine with seasonable highs in the mid-30s are
predicted for the Raven-Steeler playoff game Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The National Weather Service is forecasting one to three inches of
snow today, but it shouldn't be a factor because Heinz Field's grass
surface is covered and heated.</TE>
<TE>   The Brown-Steeler game Jan. 6 was played in steady snow, with six
inches accumulating in the Pittsburgh area. But the below-ground
heating system kept the field snow-free, although players said the
grass was slick in some areas.</TE>
<TE>   Steeler officials said the grass field has been heated around the
clock for weeks to prevent it from freezing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More than two months after his four missed field-goal attempts
contributed to the Steelers' only home loss and prevented a season
sweep of the Ravens, Kris Brown still can see the failed attempts in
his mind.</TE>
<TE>   So can his teammates. So can the Ravens, who wouldn't mind seeing
some more in Sunday's game that, because it matches the NFL's two
best defenses, could be decided by a field goal--or a missed attempt.</TE>
<TE>   Those four misses started a confidence-shaken Brown on a troubling
slump that isn't entirely over. His 14 missed field-goal attempts and
three missed extra-point attempts are the most in the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   Those misses are the very reason that, every Wednesday since that
13-10 loss to Baltimore on Nov. 4, Brown, holder Josh Miller and long
snapper Mike Schneck return to an empty Heinz Field and attempt 15 to
20 kicks. Some weeks, Brown makes them all.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not concerned about Kris, to be honest with you," said
Cowher. "For whatever reason, I have a sense that he's back to where
he was."</TE>

<HD>Anger Works for Capriati</HD>
<DH>Australian Open: Unhappy with a third-set overrule, she
heats up in 6-2, 3-6, 6-1 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MELBOURNE, Australia</DL>
<LD>When Jennifer Capriati argued, to no avail, about a vital overrule
against her in the opening game of the third set, it appeared to
signal the end of her Australian Open title defense. After all, she
was hobbled, hot and hunted.</LD>
<LD>   Hobbled?</LD>
<LD>   Not one, but two injured legs.</LD>
<TE>   Hot?</TE>
<TE>   Summer finally arrived in Melbourne and the temperature inched
close to 90 degrees today during Capriati's match against No.
81-ranked Eleni Daniilidou of Greece. And, on court, it was
considerably warmer. Hunted?</TE>
<TE>   As the defending champion and top-seeded player, Capriati is no
longer the automatic sentimental favorite every time she steps on the
court. It's normal when the hunter turns into the hunted, as former
champion Martina Hingis is fond of saying. The turnabout was more
pronounced because Melbourne's large Greek community packed the house
at Vodafone Arena and threw its support behind Daniilidou, drawing a
reprimand from the chair umpire after cheering a Capriati double
fault.</TE>
<TE>   The chair umpire, Jane Harvey, turned into a key figure in the
third set when she made an overrule in Daniilidou's favor. The Greek
teenager hit a forehand winner on break point, catching the corner
and the shot was called out. Capriati was irate at the overrule and
lost of the first game of the decisive set.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at the mark, you can see it," Capriati said. This being
Melbourne, and not Paris, Harvey stayed in the chair.</TE>
<TE>   What happened next would seem extraordinary to those who have not
watched Capriati very often. She got angry, put some additional power
behind her groundstrokes and did not lose another game, defeating
Daniilidou, 6-2, 3-6, 6-1, in 1 hour 41 minutes. Daniilidou admitted
afterward that she was "a little nervous." Something similar happened
to Capriati here in the fourth round last year. She felt she received
a bad call in her match against Marta Marrero of Spain, trailing 1-5.
After Capriati threw a small tantrum, a longtime friend walked over
to the press section and said: "Watch this." And Capriati lost only
one more game.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the situation was more difficult. Capriati has been
struggling with a hip flexor injury on both sides and needed
treatment during the match, having both legs wrapped. It impacted her
service motion and she finished with an uncommon amount of double
faults (10). Capriati will play Rita Grande of Italy in the fourth
round. The trainers were busy during Grande's match against No. 16
Iroda Tulyagonova of Uzbekistan, needing to treat both players.
Grande finally prevailed, 6-3, 5-7, 6-4.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly before Capriati's close call, Marcelo Rios of Chile was
dismissive of the depth on the women's tour. Rios, who defeated
Alberto Martin of Spain in the third round, 6-4, 6-3, 7-6 (3),
declared there were few difficult matches in the early rounds.</TE>
<TE>   "I always say men's tennis is too tough," Rios said. "It's not
like the girls, where they win one and love, until they're in the
quarters. Like, a girl that is [ranked] 40 now is going to beat
Hingis. Yesterday, I saw Hingis, and I don't know, a German girl. It
was 6-0, 6-1. It's like a joke.</TE>
<TE>   "I think in men's that's not going to happen. Everybody is tough.
And you can see [Fernando] Gonzalez, he's [ranked] 160, and he's from
Chile and he's in the fourth round, killing everybody, playing as
good as he can. Men's is tough. Even if you have a bad ranking,
anyone can beat you today."</TE>
<TE>   Rios was fairly genial with the media, a departure from his testy
nature when he was ranked No. 1 and reached the final here in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   He spoke about the calming influence of his wife and baby
daughter. His wife was a top junior international player from Costa
Rica, but Rios was adamant about the child's future sporting plans.</TE>
<TE>   "No chance," Rios said. "She's not going to be a tennis player."</TE>

<LD>   Utah State (13-3, 5-2) at Cal State Fullerton (3-12, 0-6), 7
p.m.--The Titans are in danger of having their losing streak reach
eight games against the powerful Aggies. Fullerton lost to Idaho,
63-59, on Thursday. Utah State, led by guard Tony Brown, is coming
off a 68-42 victory against UC Riverside. The Aggies limited
Riverside to 33.3% shooting.</LD>
<LD>   Pacific (11-5, 3-3) at Long Beach State (5-12, 1-5), 7:30--Long
Beach has lost 10 of 12, including three in a row. Cal State
Northridge defeated the 49ers on Thursday, 66-54, in a game that saw
Long Beach go scoreless in the final 4:41. Pacific blew a 15-point
halftime lead and lost to UC Irvine, 62-58, on Thursday. Demetrius
Jackson leads the Tigers in scoring (12.7).</LD>

<TE>   Cal State Northridge (5-10, 4-2) at UC Irvine (13-4, 6-0), 7,
KUCI-FM (88.9)--Irvine has a 19-game home winning streak but faces a
Matador team that has won three of its last four. Anteater guard
Jerry Green struggled again against Pacific but had a key rebound and
made two free throws late to help Irvine rally for a 62-58 victory. A
victory would lift Northridge into second place in its first season
in the Big West Conference. Matador forward Curtis Slaughter has
scored in double figures in five of his six starts.</TE>
<TE>   UC Santa Barbara (10-5, 4-2) at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo (9-5,
3-3), 7--It is a critical game for both teams hoping to stay close to
Irvine in the Big West race. Injuries have slowed the Gauchos as
sophomore guard and second-leading scorer Branduinn Fullove is a
game-time decision after suffering a deep thigh contusion in practice
Thursday. Forward Mike Vukovich, a part-time starter, is out because
of an injured right kneecap. Forward Adama Ndiaye also is banged up
with a shoulder injury but is expected to play. Cal Poly has won all
six of its home games, including a victory against Oregon State on
Dec. 15. Sophomore forward Varnie Dennis averages 15.5 points and 6.1
rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Idaho (5-11, 2-5) at UC Riverside (6-8, 3-3), 7, KPRO (1570)--The
Highlanders flopped in their showcase game against Utah State despite
the presence of a sellout crowd. They'll try to rebound against the
Vandals, who defeated Fullerton on Thursday. Riverside struggled
against Utah State's aggressive zone defense as it shot only 33.9%
from the field and attempted only three free throws. Shooting guard
Jason Perkins is mired in a slump, scoring only one point in the last
three games.</TE>

<TE>   Arizona (8-9, 4-4) at UCLA (5-11, 2-6), 4, KCAD (850), KCEWS

month with their first victory at Pauley Pavilion since 1998. The
Bruins, who get Shalada Allen back from a one-game suspension, are
trying to halt their latest skid that has seen them lose three of
four.</TE>
<TE>   No. 23 Arizona State (15-4, 6-2) vs. USC (9-8, 5-3), 4, Sports

can move into a tie for second place in the Pacific 10 Conference
with a victory.</TE>

<HD>Staples Makes Pitch for Lewis-Tyson Bout</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Staples Center has thrown its ring into the hat.</LD>
<LD>   With an announcement on the April 6 heavyweight title fight
between champion Lennox Lewis and challenger Mike Tyson planned for
Tuesday, promoters are still working on a site.</LD>
<LD>   Gary Shaw, Lewis' promoter, met earlier this week with Staples
Center president Tim Leiweke, who has expressed serious interest in
the bout.</LD>
<TE>   How interested the Lewis-Tyson promoters are in Staples remains to
be seen. MGM Grand and the Thomas &amp; Mack Center in Las Vegas are
believed to be the front-runners, and New York's Madison Square
Garden is also expected to become a contender.</TE>
<TE>   Usually, it comes down to money. And with the site fee expected to
exceed $10 million, it would seem Las Vegas officials have the money
to outbid Staples.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles arena put up $5.5 million to land the 2000 bout
between Oscar De La Hoya and Shane Mosley and wound up only a little
over the break-even point.</TE>
<TE>   But there are other factors involved.</TE>
<TE>   There is an ongoing investigation by Las Vegas law-enforcement
officials of an alleged sexual assault by Tyson in his Las Vegas home
last September.</TE>
<TE>   If that investigation yields enough evidence to warrant charges,
Tyson might not be able to get a boxing license from the Nevada State
Athletic Commission, despite the millions of dollars his appearance
in the ring could bring into the state.</TE>
<TE>   Depending on the seriousness of the charges, Tyson might have just
as much difficulty getting a license in California or New York. But
the fight promoters obviously want to leave themselves as many
alternatives as possible.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Broadcast Wars</TE>
<TE>   The rights to the pay-per-view telecast are also up for grabs. HBO
has the rights to Lewis' fights; Tyson is tied to the Showtime cable
network.</TE>
<TE>   Showtime executive Jay Larkin once said, "Pork chops will grow on
palm trees in Tel Aviv before we will let Mike Tyson fight on HBO."</TE>
<TE>   Well, start inspecting those branches because it might happen.</TE>
<TE>   Under a plan being negotiated, the Lewis-Tyson fight would be
shown on a third pay-per-view outlet with a third announcing team.
The fight would be reshown the next week on the cable network of the
winner, with the losing network getting $3 million to ease its loss.</TE>
<TE>   There have also been negotiations for a rematch. Rematch? With the
trouble-prone Tyson, whose second wife, Monica Turner, filed for
divorce this week, there is no guarantee there'll be a first fight
even after the contracts have been signed.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Too Expensive</TE>
<TE>   Christy Martin and Mia St. John, the two most recognizable female
fighters, are attempting to finally step into the ring against each
other.</TE>
<TE>   It is certainly the most attractive female match out there. But
for it to happen, the women have to lower their asking price. They
are seeking half a million dollars each.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Too Dangerous</TE>
<TE>   Former pro football lineman William "the Refrigerator" Perry has
backed out of his planned match against Eric "Butterbean" Esch.
Former King goon Marty McSorley was once in line for a Butterbean
fight as well, but he too changed his mind.</TE>
<TE>   Since he obviously doesn't want to fight any real boxers, who else
is out there for Butterbean's traveling circus?</TE>
<TE>   How about Dennis Rodman? Talk about a perfect fit.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kid Glove Treatment</TE>
<TE>   Although De La Hoya left promoter Bob Arum to sign with Jerry
Perenchio, head of the Univision Spanish language network, Arum, who
continues to do business with Perenchio, refuses to speak ill of him.</TE>
<TE>   At Wednesday's news conference at the Biltmore Hotel to hype De La
Hoya's May 4 title fight against Fernando Vargas, Arum, in his first
public appearance with De La Hoya since they rejoined forces, was
asked about Perenchio.</TE>
<TE>   "If he wasn't running one of the biggest media companies in the
world," Arum said, "he would have continued to do a tremendous job
with Oscar. He is one of the brightest and most creative people I
have ever met.</TE>
<TE>   "With all due to respect to Oscar, if Jerry wants to trade places
and give me his company and his stock, I will be glad to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Added De La Hoya, "As long as he makes me a partner."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Quick Jabs</TE>
<TE>   Showtime presents a tape-delayed boxing doubleheader tonight. At 6
p.m., from the Miami Jai-Alai Fronton, World Boxing Organization
junior-welterweight champion DeMarcus Corley (26-1-1, 16 knockouts)
will defend his title against No. 1 contender Ener Julio (21-3, 16).
Also, World Boxing Assn. Junior-flyweight champion Rosendo Alvarez
(30-2-1, 19) will defend against No. 1 contender Pitchit Siriwat
(25-1, 12).</TE>
<TE>   At 10 p.m. from London's York Hall, four-time world champion
Johnny Tapia (50-2-2, 27) fights a nontitle bout against Eduardo
Alvarez (29-4, 6). On the same card, WBO featherweight titleholder
Julio Pablo Chacon (42-2, 31) faces No. 8 contender Victor Polo
(30-3-2, 22).</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Julio Diaz's 10-round super-lightweight bout with Verdell Smith
lacked the feel of a convincing return.</LD>
<LD>   Diaz, the promising lightweight boxer from Coachella who suffered
his first professional defeat to Angel Manfredy in a controversial
12-round split decision in October, gradually disposed of Smith, a
fighter 16 years his elder, with an eighth-round technical knockout
Friday night at the Hollywood Palladium.</LD>
<LD>   Diaz, 22, said he was pleased with his performance against Smith,
38, a journeyman who was overwhelmed but not immediately overtaken.
"I didn't want to make a statement," Diaz said. "I wanted to take my
time and get used to being back in the ring instead of putting him
away early."</LD>
<TE>   Diaz (24-1, 18 knockouts) danced through the first round before
cornering Smith (40-37-1, 17 knockouts) in the second round with a
barrage of body punches. Diaz then pushed Smith into the corner in
the fourth and fifth rounds but didn't knock him down until the
seventh. In the eighth round, Diaz finished him off with a flurry of
body punches.</TE>

<LD>New England Coach Bill Belichick is seemingly mesmerized by the
Oakland Raiders, the Patriots' playoff opponent tonight.</LD>
<LD>   "You can't just look at one or two tapes and say, 'This is what
they're going to do,'" he told Bob Ryan of the Boston Globe.</LD>
<LD>   "They have so many different looks. [Raider Coach Jon] Gruden has
such a wide array of not only plays, but shifts, motion and ways to
disguise plays.</LD>
<TE>   "They have plays specifically designed to attack you. ...
Preparing to play them is kind of like trying to memorize the
dictionary."</TE>
<TE>   Belichick did concede, though, that the Patriots will show up.</TE>

conference but by Vince Lombardi, the last ostensible coaching savior
hired by the Redskins, at his official welcome Feb. 7, 1969.</TE>
<TE>   "There are strong parallels between the two, hard-bitten,
hard-driving football coaches. For one thing, their ages were
virtually identical at hiring time: 56 years and eight months for
Spurrier, 56 years and seven months for Lombardi....</TE>

<HD>Hearn's Return Remains on Hold</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chick Hearn, appearing Friday at a news conference at Staples Center,
said he had no idea when he would return, which was different from
what he had said earlier in the week.</LD>
<LD>   The Laker announcer, who had heart surgery Dec. 19, told The Times
on Monday that he'd be back for either a home game against the
Chicago Bulls on Feb. 6 or the Lakers' next game, a home game Feb. 12
against Michael Jordan and the Washington Wizards.</LD>
<LD>   Hearn saw his cardiologist later Monday and was told it was too
soon to announce any dates for his return. Hearn called The Times'
sports desk that night and asked that the story not reflect an exact
date. He asked that it just say early February.</LD>
<TE>   Hearn was even more vague Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no idea," he said. "I'd like to be coming back today. I
wish I was on the airplane going to San Antonio."</TE>
<TE>   Hearn said his doctors will determine when he returns.</TE>
<TE>   He was overwhelmed as he looked around the Chick Hearn Press Room,
which contained three of the four huge get-well placards that were
positioned around Staples Center during the first two Laker games
Hearn missed, ending his consecutive game streak at 3,338. The room
wasn't big enough to hold the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   The placards were about seven feet high and 36 feet wide. The
three in the room contained about 5,000 get-well wishes.</TE>
<TE>   Hearn answered questions for half an hour. At one point, he
mentioned a story printed Thursday that placed the Lakers' worth at
$403 million.</TE>
<TE>   "See what you can do when you don't pay the announcer enough," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Hearn said the Lakers had sent a limo for him and wife, Marge. "I
think it was a 1939 Ford."</TE>
<TE>   On a serious note, Hearn was asked about Shaquille O'Neal's
three-game suspension and $15,000 fine.</TE>
<TE>   "He got off lucky," Hearn said. "Thank God he didn't hit
[Chicago's Brad Miller]. There'd be court proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   "I know Shaq is remorseful and thankful he didn't hit him."</TE>

<HD>Clippers Have 20-20 Vision</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: A 109-103 victory over Cavaliers moves L.A.
back to .500, a seven-game improvement over their record a year ago.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Clippers reach the halfway point of the season tonight. And as a
young team with visions of reaching the playoffs for the first time
since 1997, they inspire a question: Are they better than they were a
year ago at this time?</LD>
<LD>   The record says yes, emphatically. After 40 games last season the
Clippers stood 13-27. After Friday's 109-103 victory over the
Cleveland Cavaliers, before 17,798 at Staples Center, they are 20-20.</LD>
<LD>   The increased talent level is also obvious. When Lamar Odom's sore
right wrist became too painful for him to continue in the third
quarter, the Clippers didn't skip a beat, thanks in large part to
Elton Brand, who had 24 points (including 13 in a row in the third
quarter) and 10 rebounds. Quentin Richardson had 22 points in 24
minutes off the bench. Jeff McInnis had 15 points and eight assists.</LD>
<TE>   Then there was the season-high 17 points and 11 rebounds from
Michael Olowokandi, helping the Clippers improve to 17-7 at home.</TE>
<TE>   "We are progressing," Coach Alvin Gentry said, before adding: "But
we have to get to a point where we can play with the same kind of
confidence on the road that we do in this building."</TE>
<TE>   The players say they get the message, even if they are 3-13 on the
road going into tonight's game in Portland.</TE>
<TE>   "We know we have to get some wins on the road. We can't just win
here," Richardson said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Olowokandi:"We need to show we learned something from our
last (1-5) road trip back East. This game [tonight] is important."</TE>
<TE>   If the Clippers are going to be a playoff team, Friday's game is
the kind they are supposed to win no matter where they play.</TE>
<TE>   The 13-27 Cavaliers came in having lost eight in a row overall,
and their last eight road games. But Cleveland, getting 24 points
each from Andre Miller and Lamond Murray, made a pest of itself for
nearly three quarters.</TE>
<TE>   Both teams shot 52% (an identical 40 for 77), there were 20 lead
changes and the score was tied 14 times. But the Clippers, who led,
47-46, at halftime, slowly separated themselves from the visitors
midway through the third quarter, when Brand scored on six
consecutive possessions.</TE>
<TE>   "I know there are a lot of great forwards in the Western
Conference," Gentry said. "But if being an all-star means being very
valuable to your team, I just hope when the West coaches vote for the
All-Star team they give Elton lots of consideration."</TE>
<TE>   Gentry expressed a new concern for Odom's health. "We're getting
to a point where we will have to consider sitting him out a couple of
games.''</TE>
<TE>   Until Los Angeles took control in the fourth quarter, the biggest
cheer of the night was given to fan Dwight Winn of Danville. At the
end of the third quarter, Winn, 27, banked in a half-court shot to
win a new automobile..</TE>
<TE>   Odom wasn't the only one in pain Friday. Murray took an accidental
elbow in the face from Darius Miles in the fourth quarter and had to
leave the game. And the three-man referee crew was shortened to two
when Courtney Kirkland sustained a pulled groin muscle in the third
quarter.</TE>

<HD>Giguere's Miscue Costs Ducks</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Goalie's turnover leads directly to a short-handed
goal by the Oilers and sends Anaheim to a 3-1 loss.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>EDMONTON, Canada</DL>
<LD>Say this for the Mighty Ducks, they certainly know how to lose a game
creatively. And that takes some doing when you lose so often.</LD>
<LD>   Goalie Jean-Sebastien Giguere, who has played so well and received
so little in return, stepped front and center Friday in a 3-1 loss to
the Edmonton Oilers before 16,558 at the Skyreach Center.</LD>
<LD>   Giguere went behind the net to retrieve the puck with the score
tied and the Ducks on the power play. By the time he got back to the
goalie crease, the Ducks were down a goal.</LD>
<TE>   Rem Murray picked Giguere's pocket and centered to Ryan Smith in
the slot. Smith had time to hand-deliver the puck into the net. It
gave the Oilers a 2-1 lead with five minutes left in the third period
against a Duck team that struggles nightly to score more than two
goals.</TE>
<TE>   "We find a way each night to give up a goal," Coach Bryan Murray
said. "Either there's a misread or a mishandle or whatever and that's
been the deciding goal so many nights."</TE>
<TE>   This, though, was the first time you could hang a loss on a Duck
goalie.</TE>
<TE>   Giguere has been solid all season and brilliant in the last two
months. He has a 1.71 goals-against average and .935 save percentage
since Dec. 1. He has a 5-9-3 record in that time.</TE>
<TE>   Every time he left the net Friday it was an adventure.</TE>
<TE>   Defenseman Pavel Trnka saved him midway through the second period
after Giguere came out to handle the puck, then turned it over. Josh
Green wound up and fired a shot, but Trnka got back to block it.</TE>
<TE>   No one could bail out Giguere later in the period, when Murray
rushed behind the net and hit his stick, knocking the puck away.</TE>
<TE>   "I was probably trying to do a little too much," Giguere said. "I
was trying to make a direct pass, I just got to do that a little more
assertive. He hit my stick, took the puck and that was the story of
the game there."</TE>
<TE>   There was a definite been-there, lost-that feeling for the Ducks.</TE>
<TE>   They got 37 shots, but one goal. And that came when Patric
Kjellberg swung and missed at an Andy McDonald centering pass near
the net only to have the puck go off his skate and into the net.</TE>
<TE>   They worked hard, getting one quality chance after another.
McDonald had five chances in the second period alone, all golden.</TE>
<TE>   They were again within a goal in the third period, trailing, 2-1,
before Mike Comrie had a puck go off his skate and into the net
midway through the third period.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks have been within a goal or tied in the third period in
all but four games this season.</TE>
<TE>   But Oiler goalie Tommy Salo was unbeatable, stopping every great
chance the Ducks had and probably would have stopped Kjellberg if
Kjellberg had actually hit the puck with his stick.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone kind of laughs at the 'Lame Ducks' whatever it may be,"
Murray said. "This is the way we play. It's just unfortunate we
haven't been able to find a way to score a few goals and get respect.
Certainly our effort is respectful every night.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the same game every night and it's the same effort."</TE>

<HD>Sawyer Ready at Drop of a Glove</HD>
<DH>Ducks: Enforcer expects to be active in tonight's rematch
of fight-filled Dec. 8 game against the Flames.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CALGARY, Canada</DL>
<LD>Kevin Sawyer is a hockey lover, not a fighter, at heart.</LD>
<LD>   That he fills the enforcer role for the Mighty Ducks was his
destiny. That he most likely will fan the Flames tonight against
Calgary, a rematch of a fight-marred Dec. 8 game that resulted in
fines, suspensions and a 4-0 Duck victory, has been preordained.</LD>
<LD>   He didn't go looking for that kind of trouble. It just found him.</LD>
<TE>   "When I was 18, I tried out for the Spokane Chiefs," Sawyer said.
"I wasn't planning on doing this role, because I didn't even know how
to do it. The first day during a scrimmage, I bumped Valeri Bure. He
shoved me. I shoved him back. All the boys came flying at me. That
was like pushing Paul Kariya on that team. I got my nose in there and
the coaches liked that."</TE>
<TE>   The last meeting between the Ducks and Flames played like a parody
of 1970s hockey.</TE>
<TE>   There were 309 penalty minutes, 291 in the third period. There
were 18 fighting majors in the game's final 1 minute 25 seconds.
During one faceoff late in the game, the Flames on the ice dropped
their gloves as soon as the referee dropped the puck.</TE>
<TE>   Calgary's Craig Berube, Steve Nichol and Coach Greg Gilbert
received suspensions.</TE>
<TE>   Sawyer was suspended for five games after he ran Flame goalie Mike
Vernon after Calgary's Bob Boughner refused to fight.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks' Ruslan Salei and goalie Jean-Sebastien Giguere were
fined and Coach Bryan Murray received a conditional fine that comes
due if the Ducks are involved in any more questionable brawls ...
like tonight?</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be interesting," said Giguere, who received a game
misconduct penalty last time. "There should be some scores to settle
over there. But I think we have to go there and focus on the game. We
can't just focus on the sideshow. But if they want to be stupid, I
know we can answer back."</TE>
<TE>   In other words: Let's Get Ready to Rumble.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly there has been prebout hype that would make Don King
proud. Murray called Gilbert a "jerk" and Nichol a "pipsqueak" in the
days afterward. The Ducks' Jeff Friesen said the Flames' Dave Lowry
was "gutless."</TE>
<TE>   Flame General Manager Craig Button singled out Denny Lambert,
saying, "next time he'll get his head beat in."</TE>
<TE>   While both teams insist that the focus will be on winning the
game, there seems to be other agendas.</TE>
<TE>   "Talk about a coward, [Friesen] doesn't even go in the corners,"
Berube said. "Who is he kidding? We just laugh at comments like that
basically."</TE>
<TE>   Said Friesen: "You got to be ready for anything. You got to make
sure your stick is with you at all times. But you go out there and
still have to play the game. I'm sure there are a few things that are
still yet to be decided."</TE>
<TE>   Sawyer had played in only 22 NHL games before this season. He
entered training camp a longshot to make the team. The Ducks, after
all, had two other enforcers, Lambert and Jim Cummins, who had
lengthy rap sheets in the NHL.</TE>
<TE>   But he quickly took things into his own hands. In a scrimmage,
Sawyer went after Cummins and took on Lambert a few minutes later.</TE>
<TE>   "My first thought was, 'What's this maniac doing here?'" Lambert
said. "It was great."</TE>
<TE>   Sawyer spent the summer in his native Christina Lake, a small
British Columbia town which doesn't even have its own ice rink. He
trained with Atlanta's Ray Ferraro, who has a cabin in the area.
Ferraro, who has been known as the "Little Ball of Hate," was good
for Sawyer's psyche.</TE>
<TE>   "You train with Ray, it's intense," Sawyer said. "If he doesn't
get the prescribed reps, out goes the 20-pound barbell through the
door.... It was like that Rocky movie, I was going up into the
mountains to train."</TE>
<TE>   Sawyer came out swinging. He played so well that the team sent
Cummins to the minors, then traded him to the New York Islanders last
week. Sawyer was leading the NHL in penalty minutes when he was

<DL>EDMONTON, Canada</DL>
<LD>Mighty Duck captain Paul Kariya has said that he wants to remain in
Anaheim and help the Ducks win the Stanley Cup.</LD>
<LD>   Others around the NHL, including one player/owner, don't seem
convinced that is possible. It took Pittsburgh's Mario Lemieux six
seasons to win his first Stanley Cup, but he didn't think patience
will help Kariya.</LD>
<LD>   "It's tough to see a guy that talented not having a chance to
compete for the Stanley Cup," Lemieux said. "I'm sure it's tough for
him. The kind of team he has, I'm sure it's difficult to accept.
Sooner or later I think he's going be a free agent and be able to
pick his poison."</LD>
<TE>   Kariya, 27, is a restricted free agent after this season, meaning
the Ducks can match any offer he receives. He will be an unrestricted
free agent after three seasons. Suitors certainly will be lining up.</TE>
<TE>   He could even fit in with Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish,"' Lemieux said, laughing. "If he would play for half
price."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Penguins, who played at Calgary on Thursday, practiced in
Edmonton on Friday. That put Lemieux, Kariya and the Canadian press
in the same building. The topic, of course, turned to the Olympics
and whether Lemieux and Kariya would skate on the same line.</TE>
<TE>   "Kariya would be a perfect fit," Lemieux said. "He has a lot of
speed and he sees the ice very well."</TE>
<TE>   Lemieux, who has played only 14 games because of a hip injury, had
three assists and an empty-net goal in a 6-4 victory over Calgary on
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "That's great for our team to see him flying like that," Kariya
said. "I saw the highlights and he looks like he's back in form.
That's great for all Canadians."</TE>

<DH>Fog Turned '88 Bear-Eagle Playoff Game Into Mistake by Lake</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nobody had the foggiest idea what was coming.</LD>
<LD>   For the opening kickoff of the 1988 playoff game between the
Chicago Bears and Philadelphia Eagles, the sky was bright blue and
you could see forever on a cold Saturday afternoon in Chicago's
Soldier Field, with the temperature in the 30s on that last day of
the year.</LD>
<LD>   The Bears looked resplendent in their trademark navy blue uniforms
with the orange and white trim. The Eagles stood out in stark
contrast in their road whites with the green trim. Within an hour,
however, the Bears would be no more than dark blobs on a fuzzy
landscape, and the Eagles would look like ghostly figures.</LD>
<TE>   The teams were meeting in an NFC divisional playoff game, as they
are today. Chicago, winner of the Central Division title in 1988,
enjoyed home-field advantage because of its 12-4 record.
Philadelphia, the Eastern Division champion, had ended the regular
season 10-6.</TE>
<TE>   The Bears took the early lead on a 64-yard touchdown pass play
from Mike Tomczak, making his first start in an NFL postseason game,
to Dennis McKinnon. Philadelphia safety Andre Waters, the only man
with a chance to catch McKinnon, fell down on the play.</TE>
<TE>   That was only the first of many bleak moments for the Eagles.
Their kicker, Luis Zendejas, missed a 43-yard field-goal attempt. Two
apparent touchdown passes on the same drive were called back because
of penalties. Philadelphia came up an inch short on fourth and one at
the Chicago four-yard line.</TE>
<TE>   But all those troubles paled, as did the Eagles' white uniforms,
compared to what occurred next.</TE>
<TE>   It was the second quarter and the Bears were ahead, 14-6, when the
first streams of white clouds floated into one end of Soldier Field.</TE>
<TE>   The first reaction of many in the press box was that it was smoke
from a fire.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia receiver Gregg Garrity said later he thought it was
some kind of weird snowstorm.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, it was fog, the result of cold air blowing off Lake
Michigan into a stream of hot air. It covered only the lakefront
area, which includes Soldier Field. The rest of Chicago remained
sparkling and clear.</TE>
<TE>   That, however, was of little solace to those who had a football
game to play.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, many football games have been played in inclement
weather. But at least with the benefit of weather reports, the
players involved had time to prepare themselves mentally, and gather
the proper equipment.</TE>
<TE>   This time, there was no preparation, and no equipment, to ease the
miserable conditions.</TE>
<TE>   The fog engulfed the field. Several veterans of the Chicago media
corps said they hadn't see anything like it in at least half a
century.</TE>
<TE>   Of the two teams, the Eagles had the greater difficulty. Wearing
white uniforms made them almost indistinguishable from the
background.</TE>
<TE>   Randall Cunningham, the Philadelphia quarterback, would fade back
to pass, only to see his receivers fade away.</TE>
<TE>   "What I could see was about 20 yards downfield," Cunningham said
after the game. "If you take your dropback, you could only see only
about 15 yards."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't much better for the Bears.</TE>
<TE>   The field-goal kickers would swing their legs through the ball,
watch it sail into the mist and then await word from an official
downfield on how they had fared.</TE>
<TE>   Up in the press box, all the media had were fuzzy pictures on
monitors or the relay of information from the public-address
announcer.</TE>
<TE>   And he wasn't much help.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, he reported, "There's word of a flag on the field."</TE>
<TE>   And later, he said, "Cris Carter catches the ball ... and he's
gone."</TE>
<TE>   Literally.</TE>
<TE>   Terry Bradshaw was working his first NFL playoff game as an
analyst that day for CBS. But how do you analyze what you can't see?</TE>
<TE>   It was also difficult for the 65,534 in attendance, who largely
came to root for the Bears and begin their New Year's Eve celebration
a bit early. They huddled around radios or small TVs, strained their
eyes to make out the blurred numbers on the scoreboard or searched,
often in vain, for a signal from the officials. Something would
happen on the field, but the cheers or boos were delayed several
minutes until fans finally figured out what had happened.</TE>
<TE>   Either team could have sneaked a 12th man onto the field that day
and who would have known?</TE>
<TE>   By the second half, the press box was largely abandoned. Most
reporters chose to go down on the field rather than gaze out at what
looked like an Arctic landscape.</TE>
<TE>   The Bears won the game, 20-12, but went on to lose to the San
Francisco 49ers, 28-3, in the NFC championship game.</TE>
<TE>   At least it is believed Chicago beat Philadelphia. The game film
offered little evidence one way or the other.</TE>
<TE>   When it was over, a radio reporter who was blind asked Chicago
Coach Mike Ditka what it was like out there.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought," said Ditka, "I was you."</TE>

<HD>Kite Soars to Lead  in Hawaii</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tom Kite had two eagles in a course-record nine-under-par 63 Friday
to take a three-stroke lead in the Senior PGA Tour's season-opening
MasterCard Championship at Kaupulehu-Kona, Hawaii.</LD>
<LD>   Kite, who eagled Nos. 4 and 7 and had five birdies in the
bogey-free round, hit 17 of 18 greens in regulation on the Hualalai
Golf Club course.</LD>
<LD>   Kite said the record-setting round was surprising, considering the
shifting wind and that he didn't touch a club for nearly a month
during the off-season.</LD>
<TE>   "It's nice to come back refreshed, enthusiastic and excited about
playing golf, but there's some payback," he said. "The golf swing is
not where you want it to be, and the inconsistency is there. I guess
that's probably why the round was so surprising."</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion Larry Nelson opened with a 66.</TE>
<TE>   Doug Tewell, who had a hole-in-one, was another stroke back along
with Bob Gilder and Jim Colbert in the tournament limited to tour
winners in the last two years and major champions in the last five.</TE>
<TE>   Tewell's ace, came on the 208-yard eighth. He used a four-iron to
bend the shot right to left, and the ball rolled 15 feet into the
hole.</TE>
<TE>   No longer able to compete against players more than half his age,
Jack Nicklaus said he has not decided whether he will play in the
Masters, the major championship he won a record six times.</TE>
<TE>   Nicklaus, who turns 62 Monday, has been plagued with back problems
and has not played tournament golf since July 29, when he tied for
third in the Senior British Open.</TE>
<TE>   His health is improving, and Nicklaus plans to play in the Senior
Skins Game next week in Hawaii against Hale Irwin, Arnold Palmer and
Fuzzy Zoeller.</TE>
<TE>   The Senior PGA Tour announced that two tournaments were being
eliminated: the tournament in Charlotte, N.C., which started in 1979,
and the Gold Rush Classic, which ended a 15-year run in the
Sacramento area. A title sponsor could not be found for either
tournament.</TE>

<KH>BOB HOPE CHRYSLER CLASSIC</KH>
<HD>It's a Tie in Triplicate, Any Way You Spell It</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LA QUINTA</DL>
<LD>The leaders' names as today's fourth round begins in the Bob Hope
Chrysler Classic: Deane Pappas, Kirk Triplett and Duffy Waldorf.</LD>
<LD>   You may know them in other ways--as John Daly's former college
teammate, the guy whose name is misspelled on his own golf bag and
the fellow who hits balls with kids' artwork scribbled all over them.</LD>
<LD>   Whatever works is fine. The thing is, their names don't really
matter nearly as much right now as they might come Sunday, when the
last birdie is shot and the last guy out the door at the Palmer
Course at PGA West cleans up the feathers.</LD>
<TE>   Pappas is a 34-year-old South African by way of the University of
Arkansas, where he and Daly played on the same team and probably
shared one of those hog-snout hats. Pappas laid waste to Bermuda
Dunes on Friday with a nine-under-par 63, good for a 19-under total
of 197 after 54 holes. He's still remembering the big lift he got
Wednesday at Indian Wells, where he made a double-eagle two on the
last hole. Said Pappas: "That was nice."</TE>
<TE>   For more insight, it's better to call on Waldorf, a four-time
winner on the PGA Tour who didn't even commit to the Hope until the
deadline last Friday, when he was in Hawaii, where he was busy
missing the cut. To hear him explain it, he had just finished lunch
and was thinking about going to the beach, but decided that the first
thing he should do was to call in and say he would play the Hope.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought, 'Well, I don't really want to play Palm Springs,
but....'"</TE>
<TE>   And so Waldorf, who went out Friday and stuck a 64 on the Palmer
Course, has played 54 holes with just one bogey.</TE>
<TE>   So when was the last time that happened, Duffy? "Without having to
dig deep in my memory bank, I'd say never."</TE>
<TE>   Then there is Triplett, the Nissan Open champion two years ago,
who matched Waldorf with his own 64 at the Palmer Course, despite
using a bag that has his name spelled TRIPRETT on the back.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure the guy stitching it got a phone call in the middle," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Hopefully, it's not the same guy who does the engraving for the
trophy on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Anyway, at this point, not a whole lot of preparation work can be
done for that little task. Even though the Triplett-Pappas-Waldorf
triumvirate shares the lead, it's only a one-shot margin over Jerry
Kelly, Brandel Chamblee, Cameron Beckman and John Senden.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, 17 players are within four shots of the lead, including
Daly in a group at 15-under 201 that also includes Phil Mickelson.</TE>
<TE>   Daly had a 65 at Bermuda Dunes and moved from a tie for 34th to a
tie for 13th. Mickelson had a rough day at the Palmer Course with a
two-under 70 to fall from a tie for third. Jay Haas is two shots
behind the leaders, just ahead of a Justin Leonard-Craig
Stadler-Chris DiMarco-David Berganio foursome that's at 16-under 200.
Leonard had a 64 at Bermuda Dunes and  Stadler, 48, had a 64 at
Indian Wells.</TE>
<TE>   Triplett has a degree in civil engineering from the University of
Nevada, and he obviously knows something about math. He started
figuring up how much under par he might have to be to win Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to be around that 30-under range," he said. "You have
to be there to have a chance."</TE>
<TE>   With an eight-birdie, no-bogey round, Triplett made the most of
his chances at the Palmer Course and should enjoy today even more
because he's playing user-friendly Indian Wells. "Well, yeah, there's
a lot of low scores shot at Indian Wells over the years," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The only player who shot a 65 and probably was a little
disappointed was Kelly, who made a bogey on his last hole at
Tamarisk. Beckman, who won the Southern Farm Bureau Classic last year
despite a sore neck, doesn't have anything wrong with him this week,
so that's probably a bad sign. But with a 64 at the Palmer Course, he
can't be counted out. He's a survivor, which is what you become when
you win a PGA Tour event after you've gone through qualifying school
three years in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Waldorf is continuing his tradition of playing with
golf balls that have doodles on them. Since his kids aren't here this
week, Waldorf has borrowed Chase and Kyle Freeman, the children of
touring pro Robin Freeman, to do the artwork.</TE>
<TE>   The patterns are unmistakable, said Waldorf: "Well, this one looks
like a couple of circles with some blobs in the middle."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever. As long as he can find it and as long as it rolls into
the hole quickly, that's all any player can ask this week.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Michael Jordan's return to Chicago today will be televised in 72% of
the country, but not in Los Angeles. This market will get the Lakers
and San Antonio Spurs at 10 a.m.</LD>
<LD>   The Laker game was on the NBC schedule all along and the
Washington-Chicago game was added as the second part of a
doubleheader after Jordan announced his return.</LD>
<LD>   But the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the NFL rescheduling that
delayed the playoffs one week meant a second NBA game on NBC today
would have gone head-to-head with an NFL playoff game.</LD>
<TE>   So NBC, according to a network spokesman, opted to show the two
games at the same time on a regional basis, thus depriving L.A.
viewers of Jordan's return to Chicago.</TE>

<LD>With the status of Philippe Boucher uncertain after the King
defenseman suffered a concussion in the second period of Thursday
night's 4-2 victory over the Buffalo Sabres, Jere Karalahti was
recalled Friday from the minors.</LD>
<LD>   Karalahti, loaned this week to the Kings' American Hockey League
team at Manchester, N.H., on a conditioning assignment, flew back and
forth between Los Angeles and New Hampshire without ever playing for
the Monarchs.</LD>
<LD>   The Finnish defenseman, who had been scratched from all but four
of the Kings' previous 22 games, arrived in Manchester in time for
Wednesday night's game, but his equipment did not. He was all set to
play in Friday night's game before getting the call to return to Los
Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   His plane was scheduled to touch down at LAX at about midnight.</TE>
<TE>   Boucher, meanwhile, was scheduled to be reevaluated late Friday
after being leveled Thursday by a clean hit by Sabre forward Taylor
Pyatt.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, who lead the NHL in penalty-killing percentage, have
killed 93 of 95 penalties over their last 23 games, outscoring the
opposition during that time, 3-2, while at a manpower disadvantage.
They have not given up a power-play goal in 11 games, killing their
last 44 penalties to match a club record.</TE>

<HD>Walker Returns, Memories Remain</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Samaki Walker spent the past few days making one thing clear to his
taunting teammates: Those weren't his San Antonio Spurs, swept by the
Lakers in the Western Conference finals last spring.</LD>
<LD>   Oh, he wore the uniform, practiced hard and gratefully took the
paycheck.</LD>
<LD>   But he barely played by the end, and by the time the Lakers rolled
through town on their way to the NBA finals, he was fairly certain
the Spurs would not spend the $3.3 million to bring him back.</LD>
<TE>   He understood his destiny, Walker said, just as the Spurs knew
theirs', barely a game into that series. He sat in their huddles and
locker room, so he knew their hopelessness.</TE>
<TE>   "To be perfectly honest, the fire wasn't there after the first
game," Walker said Friday afternoon before boarding a flight to San
Antonio, where the Lakers and Spurs will meet today for the first
time since the conference finals.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw guys, Terry Porter [for one], guys who I thought were
[leaders] on the team, it seemed like they lost a lot of faith, a lot
of energy, like they lost their intensity," he said. "I thought we
felt like we couldn't beat the Lakers. We [believed] the hype. We
knew they were on a roll. At the time, we had the best record in the
NBA. I think we succumbed to all the hype, the attention the Lakers
were getting. We came in like we were the underdogs and played like
it. And believed it."</TE>
<TE>   The question now, do they still believe it? And, even if they
don't today--with Shaquille O'Neal serving the last of his three-game
suspension and the Lakers utterly and momentarily vulnerable-- what
about tomorrow? What about June?</TE>
<TE>   "Realistically," Walker said, "I think they are a better team with
some of their new additions. But, I don't think there's ever an
answer for Shaquille and Kobe [Bryant]. I don't think they'll ever
come up with an answer.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the triangle offense is too powerful. When it's run right
on this team, when this team becomes the team we feel we can be in
playoff time, I don't think there's any team that can beat us, for
the simple fact that we have the guys in the offense that can make it
happen. I don't think they have the capabilities to stop us."</TE>
<TE>   Today's game has the potential to be a different matter.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have lost three of four, including once to the Chicago
Bulls and once to the Miami Heat, and now they'll have to win 46
consecutive games over three months to break the Bulls' record of 72
wins in a season.</TE>
<TE>   That seems unlikely, given they have to play the Bulls and Heat
again, not to mention Golden State and Memphis.</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs could present an even larger challenge, given the
Lakers' current lack of interior girth. But, no one is talking about
this as a playoff preview--though it almost certainly is, and no one
is hyping payback, though the Spurs most certainly are.</TE>
<TE>   "If this was March, we could maybe gauge ourselves," Laker forward
Robert Horry said. "But, it's not March."</TE>
<TE>   So, instead, perhaps only Walker will measure himself, against Tim
Duncan, his former practice matchup, and against his former team,
which did not feel him worth the money.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't downplay it," Walker said. "It's definitely a big game."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In his last four games, Derek Fisher has made 17 of 28 three-point
attempts. He is shooting 43.0 %, 20th in the league.... The Lakers
are 4-3 without O'Neal, 43-29 in the past six seasons.... LiquidSeats
and the Clippers have made tickets for Wednesday's Laker-Clipper game
available at StubHub.com.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<TE>   at San Antonio</TE>
<TE>   Noon, Channel 4</TE>
<TE>   Site--Alamodome</TE>
<TE>   Radio--KLAC (570)</TE>
<TE>   Records--Lakers 27-9, Spurs 27-10.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Spurs (2000-01)--2-2.</TE>
<TE>   Update--Bruce Bowen and Tony Parker are recovering from injuries,
forcing Coach Gregg Popovich to press the Spurs' depth. In his second
start of the season, Charles Smith had 19 points and six rebounds in
a four-point victory against Utah on Thursday night. He had 21 points
two nights before against Washington. Stephen Jackson and Antonio
Daniels also are getting more playing time. Parker, the rookie point
guard, sprained his ankle Monday against New Jersey. Bowen has a
broken finger.... Duncan, averaging 25.4 points and 12.9 rebounds,
scored 35 points Thursday. He has led the Spurs in scoring in 19
consecutive games.... David Robinson, at 36, has lost fourth-quarter
minutes in recent weeks to the younger, quicker Malik Rose.... Like
the Lakers, the Spurs have been spotty since a quick start. They were
20-4 and are 7-6 since.</TE>

<LD>Page 2 of Wednesday's sports section contained six of the most
frightening words in the sports world: "T.J. Simers is on
assignment."</LD>
<LD>   Where is he and what is he doing? Is he prowling the streets in
Philadelphia wearing a black turtleneck and smoking a cigar to see if
those guys are as tough as their e-mails? Maybe he donned a straw hat
and a corncob pipe and is at a 4-H rally in Omaha to see if those
rubes he skewered are really as backward as he claims.</LD>
<LD>   My guess is that he is down at the local phone company with a
made-up subpoena trying to get the unlisted home telephone numbers of
Steve Sample and Mike Garrett.</LD>

<HD>Shaq Attack Has Fans Punchy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I'm really moved by the outpouring of sympathy for Shaquille O'Neal.
He has been wronged for so long, yet we are only now beginning to
take notice. Afghan women oppressed by the Taliban had it easy--just
look at the grueling existence this man leads. First, the poor guy is
genetically cursed with a combination of size and athleticism never
seen. What a raw deal.</LD>
<LD>   Second, as a grown man, Shaq has had to endure the stress and
rigor of being paid nearly $200 million to play a game at which he is
immensely talented. Oh, but that's nothing.</LD>
<LD>   Can you imagine having to compete in the NBA for more than 60
hours in one calendar year [do the math], all the while absorbing
hard fouls with a scant 7-foot-1, 340-pound frame? And having such a
full plate as a cultural icon, who could find the time--or even
muster the desire--to perform a task as mundane as practicing free
throws? And opponents actually try to exploit this man's glaring
weakness at his and his team's expense? This is a travesty, indeed.</LD>
<TE>   Couple this with the wear and tear from trampling smaller
opponents on the way to the hoop, and who among us would not finally
one day throw a wild punch at a man whose back is turned?</TE>
<TE>   Shaq, you truly are the "Big Inspiration."</TE>
<TE>   Oliver Lang</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I can't believe it! Finally a Times sports columnist, Bill
Plaschke, who actually has the courage to be politically incorrect.
That is to correctly blame Shaquille O'Neal for throwing a sucker
punch at Bull center Brad Miller. Watch the letters today and see how
many will take the Kobe Bryant approach: "Hey, it's about time he
punched someone."</TE>
<TE>   You've got to love it when Plaschke tells O'Neal at some 350
pounds to lose weight.</TE>
<TE>   Keep it up, Mr. Plaschke!</TE>
<TE>   Ron Cooper</TE>
<TE>   La Crescenta</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Although Chick Hearn's streak has come to an end, Bill Plaschke's
is still alive. In all his years at The Times, not once has he gotten
it right when commenting on the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Leahy</TE>
<TE>   Santa Barbara</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The NBA should reassess how it treats Shaq. Not only should the
excessive pounding cease, but, in fairness, Shaq should no longer be
allowed to use his size and bulk to bump away defenders and get open
shots.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, this unofficial trade-off that has been going on for
years is no longer to Shaq's liking. The best way to resolve this,
however, would be for Shaq to start making free throws, thereby
discouraging the practice of hacking him.</TE>
<TE>   The good news in all this is that as a consequence of the
suspension, Shaq can rest his aching feet a little bit more.</TE>
<TE>   Fred Schor</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Instead of fining and suspending Shaquille O'Neal, the NBA should
give Shaq a Nobel Peace Prize. Any other human on earth would have
gone off a long time ago if they were hammered as often as O'Neal is
during a game.</TE>
<TE>   The NBA either needs to call the obvious flagrant fouls that are
administered to Shaq or change the name of the sport to "basket
brawl" and allow O'Neal to retaliate with his fists, and while he is
at it, maybe take a shot or two at the clueless referees.</TE>
<TE>   J. Scott Scheffer</TE>
<TE>   Victorville</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   J.A. Adande, your article today [Jan. 12] is as nonsensical as it
can get. Your logic is as warped as Osama bin Laden's that because
Shaq is fouled often, he has the right to swing a fist at his
opponents. Shaq swung a fist and he has to be punished! No ifs or
buts. Those are the rules.</TE>
<TE>   Henry Zee</TE>

<TE>   MEMO TO: All NBA Officials</TE>
<TE>   FROM: The Office of the Commissioner</TE>
<TE>   Gentlemen, er, and ladies [one or two, I can't remember now], our
league has fallen on somewhat harder times now since the departure of
our God, Michael Jordan. As you know, we had hoped for some sort of
parity in our league, but the last two years has all but wiped out
that goal for the foreseeable future.</TE>
<TE>   It is for these reasons that I am again reminding you to please
keep the current "Shaquille O'Neal Plan" in effect until further
notice. The recent rash of blowout victories has left little
incentive for our smaller-market teams to try to compete. In fact, I
would now like you to consider a new "Kobe Bryant Plan," one a little
more subtle in nature. You may just ignore making any calls his way
when he drives to the basket, or tries to penetrate the lane in any
way. You just call them as I see them, if you know what I mean.</TE>
<TE>   If we keep these policies in effect until the end of this season,
and our new zone defenses work out like I planned, we should be back
on top in no time.</TE>

<LD>Thank goodness USC defeated UCLA in basketball. According to Mr.
Simers, it was a slam dunk because the Bruins were looking forward to
Kansas. Just think of all the flak USC would have taken from him had
UCLA won that meaningless game. Now, for the February rematch, T.J.
indicates that the Bruins will be looking forward to that vaunted
East Coast powerhouse Villanova, which was 9-3 with a strength of
schedule of 293rd. Heck, it is USC that will be looking beyond UCLA.
The Trojans will be gearing up for their next game, against Arizona
State.</LD>
<LD>   In an attempt to drum up interest for his column, while putting
down USC in the same breath, did it ever occur to Mr. Simers that he
is as transparent as cellophane?</LD>

<TE>   USC occasionally defeats UCLA in basketball, and sometimes has
better teams. However, every season the Bruins play teams such as
Kansas, Duke, North Carolina, etc., while the Trojans consider Utah a
big game.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Henry Bibby claims he's a "pioneer" for USC basketball, but
the Trojans won't gain the national prestige they seek until they
upgrade their nonconference schedule.</TE>

<TE>   Am I missing something, or are you? Who is the best collegiate
basketball player around? Who scores outside and inside, makes great
assists, rebounds, plays great defense, can press and break a press,
and consistently plays huge in big games against the best big men in
the game?</TE>
<TE>   Matt Barnes exemplifies the type of player John Wooden used to
produce better than anyone else. I wonder what Wooden himself would
say?</TE>

<HD>Lions' Second-Half Rally Tops Portland</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC STEPHENS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a night when nearly everything in Gersten Pavilion malfunctioned,
Loyola Marymount didn't break down.</LD>
<LD>   Kent Dennis made a 30-foot three-point basket as the shot clock
expired to give the Lions an insurmountable five-point lead with 1
minute 11 seconds left, then they went on to an 85-77 West Coast
Conference victory Friday over Portland after trailing by seven at
halftime.</LD>
<LD>   Dennis was originally trying to pass to Greg Lakey, but the
forward was being closely guarded. Dennis continued to dribble, and
as the shot clock neared zero, he turned and shot.</LD>
<TE>   "We were supposed to get the ball to Greg and I didn't have a good
lane," Dennis said. "Everybody just started yelling at me to shoot
the ball. I got a good look and it went in."</TE>
<TE>   The Lions took the good fortune when bad things were happening all
around them. In the second half, a bank of lights went out twice and
the scoreboard repeatedly shut off in the 20-year-old gymnasium.</TE>
<TE>   Loyola Coach Steve Aggers said the many breaks in play helped his
team.</TE>
<TE>   "With Greg and Andy [Osborn] both with four fouls, I thought it
gave us a chance to rest our guys," Aggers said. "With all the media
timeouts, you're going to have a lot of stoppages in the game and
I've tried to get the team to look at it as four-minute games we have
to win."</TE>
<TE>   Lakey and Dennis each scored 14 points, Sherman Gay had 13 and
Osborn had 12 for Loyola (9-8, 2-1). Osborn also had 11 rebounds and
Lakey had nine.</TE>
<TE>   Portland (4-13, 0-3) built its lead to 50-39 with 16:51 remaining
but eventually lost its ninth consecutive game.</TE>

<HD>Marbury Finds Mark at Just the Right Time</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No matter how many shots he has missed, Stephon Marbury is more than
willing to take one at the end, and he usually makes it.</LD>
<LD>   Marbury overcame a poor shooting night by hitting a three-point
basket with 4.5 seconds to play in overtime to give the Phoenix Suns
a 103-100 victory over visiting Minnesota, ending the Timberwolves'
nine-game winning streak.</LD>
<LD>   It was only his seventh basket in 28 attempts on the night. This
was nothing new for Marbury. He was one for 11 against Boston on Dec.
27 before his 22-footer with two seconds left gave the Suns an 84-82
victory.</LD>
<TE>   "Every shot that I take, I think I'm going to make it," Marbury
said. "I don't ever think that I'm going to miss. That's just my
nature. If you don't have enough confidence in your shot, you
shouldn't shoot the ball."</TE>
<TE>   The Timberwolves made critical mental mistakes at the end of
regulation, when they failed to call a timeout to set up the
game-winning shot, and at the end of overtime, when they had a foul
to give but allowed Marbury to get off his three-pointer.</TE>
<TE>   "We've won because we've been smart," Minnesota Coach Flip
Saunders said. "Tonight we weren't smart. We made stupid plays, and
our shot selection was terrible."</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Garnett scored 24 of his 32 points in the second half but
none in overtime. Chauncey Billups scored 26 but only six after
halftime. Wally Szczerbiak had 22 points for Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   Shawn Marion had 26 points and 10 rebounds for Phoenix. Bo Outlaw
had a season-high 12 points, including four points and a crucial
steal in the overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Sun center Jake Voskuhl matched his career highs with 12 points
and nine rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento 121, Golden State 97--Chris Webber had 26 points, eight
rebounds and six assists before fouling out at Sacramento as the
Kings became the first team to win 11 consecutive games this season.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings have won 15 consecutive games at Arco Arena, where they
are an NBA-best 22-1. It was Sacramento's seventh consecutive victory
over the Warriors, who have lost eight of nine games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Denver 96, Seattle 90--Ryan Bowen had 12 points during a 38-7 run
that helped rally the Nuggets at Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Voshon Lenard and Avery Johnson each had 10 points during the
flurry, which erased a 13-point deficit midway through the third
quarter and produced an 18-point lead with 8:32 left.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 89, New Jersey 77--Vince Carter scored 23 points,
including six consecutive late in the fourth quarter at Toronto, as
the Raptors ended the Nets' six-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Kidd had 19 points and eight assists for New Jersey, which
was trying for its longest winning streak in 18 years.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 115, Orlando 110--Sam Cassell scored 26 points,
including a key three-pointer and four free throws in the last minute
for the victory at Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Houston 104, Boston 101--Steve Francis had the fourth
triple-double of his career and Moochie Norris made a critical
three-pointer with 27 seconds left as the Rockets won at Boston.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 96, Indiana 93--Jerry Stackhouse scored 32 points and
Cliff Robinson had 27 at Indianapolis as the Pistons' ended an

<HD>This All-Star Game Is No 76er Dream</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Philadelphia 76er Chairman Ed Snider said playing host to the NBA
All-Star game is a "nightmare" because the league keeps most of the
tickets, making the team look bad to its fans.</LD>
<LD>   "If I could give the game back, I would," Snider said. "I can tell
you this for sure: We will never apply for another All-Star [game]."</LD>
<LD>   Snider said the league keeps about 18,000 of the tickets available
at the 20,444-seat First Union Center, leaving many of the 76ers'
longtime season-ticket holders unable to get in. The 76ers have about
16,000 season-ticket holders and Snider said many of them want to go
to the game, which is scheduled for Feb. 10.</LD>
<TE>   "We don't need this aggravation with our fans that have supported
us," he said.</TE>
<TE>   NBA Deputy Commissioner Russ Granik said he sympathized with the
ticket supply problem. Nevertheless, he said, All-Star weekend is the
league's best opportunity to host its business partners, even if that
means the local fans can't attend.</TE>
<TE>   "This is our Super Bowl," Granik said. "It's our chance to
entertain."</TE>
<TE>   Besides the public-relations problem, Snider said the team
wouldn't make any money off the All-Star Game, either.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a league event," he said. "The revenue goes to the NBA."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A time-share entrepreneur is leading an investment group that
wants to buy the Orlando Magic and keep the team from moving.</TE>
<TE>   David Siegel will meet with Magic officials early next week. He
declined further comment.</TE>
<TE>   Magic owner Rich DeVos announced Monday the team is for sale,
which could lead to its relocation. Team officials say DeVos and his
family are selling because they are losing about $10 million a year,
and so he can engage in estate planning.</TE>
<TE>   Magic officials did not return phone calls.</TE>
<TE>   The Orlando Sentinel reported Friday that Siegel's group wants to
keep the team in its arena, the 17,248-seat T.D. Waterhouse Centre.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nick Van Exel, his jaw still visibly swollen, reiterated that he
still wants to be traded away from the Denver Nuggets.</TE>
<TE>   Van Exel took an elbow to the face from Utah's Karl Malone. The
pain and swelling forced him to miss Wednesday's game against
Sacramento. He had seven points in a 96-90 win over Seattle Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Van Exel first demanded to be traded after a Dec. 8 loss at
Cleveland. He said his agent has given him the impression that
something is in the works.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Washington forward Christian Laettner, who has missed the last 14
games because of a broken leg, was activated off the injured list and
is expected to play at Chicago today.... Police in Bellevue, Wash.,
plan to arrest former NBA star Dale Ellis after his wife said he hit
her during an argument. Ellis' wife, Monique, sustained minor
injuries, the police said, but was not hospitalized. There were no
weapons involved.</TE>

<HD>Russia's Butyrskaya Wins Short Program</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Maria Butyrskaya won the short program in the European Figure Skating
Championships at Lausanne, Switzerland, skating with ease Friday
while the other top Russian and Olympic gold hopeful made another
surprising fall.</LD>
<LD>   Butyrskaya's clean routine gives her the edge in confidence going
into the Feb. 8-24 Salt Lake City Games, where she and teammate Irina
Slutskaya are U.S. champion Michelle Kwan's main rivals for the gold.</LD>
<LD>   Slutskaya turned in another subpar performance, falling on a
triple flip in the short program, after a nasty sprawl on a double
axel in the qualifying round Wednesday. Though she had the best marks
for artistry, with five 5.9s, the fall dropped her to third place
overall.</LD>
<TE>   To retain her title, Slutskaya must win the free program today,
worth 50% of the final score, and someone has to defeat Butyrskaya, a
former European champion who defeated Kwan at the 1999 world
championships.</TE>
<TE>   That someone could be the third Russian skater, Victoria
Volchkova, who finished second with huge jumps, including a big
triple lutz-double toe loop combination to a pop version of
Beethoven's "Moonlight Sonata."</TE>
<TE>   Though Volchkova and Butyrskaya split the technical marks,
Butyrskaya was scored higher than Volchkova by every judge on
artistry, with one 5.9 and the rest 5.8s.</TE>
<TE>   "I was nervous, as always," Butyrskaya said. "I'm happy with this
program, it was well done."</TE>
<TE>   Slutskaya's falls have been on jumps that are normally routine for
her. She was landing both triple jumps smoothly in the last
run-through of her short program eight hours before the competition.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing really happened. I just fell," Slutskaya said. "Tomorrow,
I'll come back strong and win."</TE>
<TE>   France's Martina Anissina and Gwendel Peizerat won the ice dance
title, edging Italy's Barbara Fusar-Poli and Maurizio Margaglio.</TE>

<TE>   Tennessee's Phillip Fulmer became the highest-paid coach in the
Southeastern Conference, agreeing to a contract extension at $1.65
million a year.</TE>
<TE>   "The contract is a reflection of the success Coach Fulmer has
brought to our football program," Athletic Director Doug Dickey said.
"It also is a sign of the confidence we have in his continued
performance."</TE>
<TE>   Fulmer, 50, gets a $350,000 raise and a one-year extension to 2008
under a compensation package that puts him just ahead of the $1.6
million Louisiana State will pay Coach Nick Saban.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas running back Reggie Duncan failed to show up for a court
hearing concerning a shoplifting charge, and an arrest warrant was
issued for the player.</TE>
<TE>   But Duncan may avoid arrest if he appears in court Tuesday,
Municipal Court Supervising Prosecutor Jerry Little said. Little said
there may have been a miscommunication between Duncan and his lawyer
about the Thursday hearing.</TE>
<TE>   The warrant was issued after Duncan didn't show for a hearing to
consider revoking his diversion agreement on a shoplifting charge.</TE>

<TE>   Super-G world champion Daron Rahlves of the United States finished
fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Eberharter won in 1 minute 18.91 seconds for his second victory in
two World Cup super-G races this season. This was the first time in
12 years the Austrian won on the demanding Streif course.</TE>
<TE>   Rahlves was timed in 1:19.85, narrowly missing a top-three finish.
He was fourth in last year's super-G and third in the downhill.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ronny Ackerman of Germany won a Nordic Combined World Cup event at
Liberec, Czech Republic, for his fifth victory of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Another German, Georg Hettich, placed a second, the best of his
career; Daito Takahashi of Japan was third; and Bill Demong of the
United States fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Ackermann, seventh after the ski jumping portion, closed in on ski
jumping winner Hettich after several kilometers of the 7.5-kilometer
cross-country sprint. Ackermann wound up 9.5 seconds ahead of his
teammate.</TE>

<TE>   Pound will head a new commission charged with coming up with ways
to reduce the spiraling size and cost of the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   The Canadian lawyer said he received a fax from International
Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge confirming his appointment
as chairman of the panel, formally called the Olympic Games Study
Commission.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm happy to be appointed to the position and will do my best to
make it an effective commission," Pound said in a telephone interview
from Montreal. "We will look at ways the scope, the expense and the
size of the Games can perhaps be reduced."</TE>

<HD>They're a Step From Fat City</HD>
<DH>NFC: Bears, Eagles play for spot in conference final, which
neither has reached in more than a decade.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE PUCIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>It was the symbol for the season, the ultimate talisman for the
Chicago Bears.</LD>
<LD>   Keith Traylor, a 6-foot-2 defensive lineman for the Chicago Bears
who weighs about 320 ... or 330 ... or 340 pounds, found himself with
a football in his hands and open field ahead of him. Lots of open
field.</LD>
<LD>   In the regular-season finale against Jacksonville, Traylor
intercepted a pass. Then he ran for 67 yards. He looked for someone
speedier, lighter, to lateral to. No one was close. He huffed and he
puffed. TV viewers were alternately enthralled by this massive man
running slower and slower, and frightened that they would see some
sort of health crisis before Traylor either landed in the end zone or
was tackled.</LD>
<TE>   It was kind of like watching the Bears all season. In a city where
grade school children are singing "Fight on, Chicago Bears" right
after they sing "My Country 'Tis of Thee," it was captivating to see
the team challenge for the NFL playoffs for the first time since 1995
and challenge for the Super Bowl for the first time since 1985. It
was also frightening, waiting for the collapse, certain it would
come.</TE>
<TE>   Traylor didn't score his touchdown. He was tackled short of the
goal line. But his team scored a touchdown and went on to win the
game, which clinched the NFC Central Division title and, briefly,
even allowed the Bears to dream of home-field advantage through the
conference playoffs. But the Bears lost twice to Green Bay and almost
lost so many other times, winning twice in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Still, they did win enough games to host the Philadelphia Eagles
today, the winner advancing to the NFC title game.</TE>
<TE>   The Eagles had a seminal moment of their own this season. It did
not involve a giant man lumbering for his life. It involved beating
the New York Giants at their Philly home, Veterans Stadium, for the
first time in five years. The win, on Dec. 30, ended the sad streak
and gave the Eagles the NFC East title and a playoff spot. The Giants
were the ones who eliminated the Eagles from the playoffs last year,
in the conference semifinals. The Giants were the ones who have
hogged all the glory and titles over a decade.</TE>
<TE>   "It was," said Eagle quarterback Donovan McNabb, "an important win
on many levels."</TE>
<TE>   And a win in today's game will be important for either team on
many levels.</TE>
<TE>   Glory has not found the Bears or Eagles in many years. The last
time Philadelphia was in an NFC championship game was in 1981. The
Bears last appeared in that game in 1989. If the proudest moments of
both franchises are long past, both also tout an old-fashioned value.</TE>
<TE>   That is, both love to play defense.</TE>
<TE>   The Bears allowed the fewest points (203) and second-fewest yards
rushing in the league during the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   "I think our defense is one that just goes out and does its job,"
Chicago end Phillip Daniels said. "We haven't made a lot of mistakes
either, and that's the key to having a good defense."</TE>
<TE>   Traylor has done more than provide comic relief with his running.
He and fellow defensive tackle Ted Washington combine to weigh an
estimated 700 pounds. Give or take a few.</TE>
<TE>   Running up the middle against these guys is not easy. Neither is
getting a definitive answer to the weight question. Traylor and
Washington are close-mouthed about poundage, especially after a
Jacksonville radio announcer called Traylor's interception run this
way: "That fat cow just ran all the way down the field. He's got more
than one little bowl of jelly in his stomach."</TE>
<TE>   The Eagles allowed only five more points than the Bears, but
relied more on the pass rush and the secondary. Ferocious end Hugh
Douglas, who runs hard and hits harder, keys the rush. Veterans Troy
Vincent and Brian Dawkins anchor the secondary. In three playoff
games the last two seasons, the Eagles haven't allowed a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be a physical game," said Eagle defensive tackle
Corey Simon. "To be competitive at this level, you have to see this
as a challenge."</TE>
<TE>   Neither team wants to live in the past, but the past keeps
sticking its nose into the affair. That's because the last time these
two teams met in the playoffs, on Dec. 31, 1988, the game was made
nearly invisible by a dense fog that covered Soldier Field just
before halftime. People sitting in the 10th row couldn't see the
game. Players standing on the 20-yard line couldn't see the end zone.</TE>
<TE>   The Bears won the Fog Bowl, 20-12. At least that's what everybody
thinks happened.</TE>
<TE>   "Who knows?" says Eagle quarterback Donovan McNabb, the Chicago
native and Philadelphia's most dangerous offensive weapon. "Who could
tell what the final score was?"</TE>
<TE>   McNabb is a valuable cold-weather player because he has both a
strong arm and quick legs. He can throw or run.</TE>
<TE>   The Bears are a dangerous cold-weather team because they have
strong, young running backs--Anthony Thomas, a rookie with 1,183
yards, and James Allen, a fourth-year guy who has 469 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Soldier Field is a dangerous cold-weather place, an old stadium
standing on the edge of Lake Michigan with slippery turf and a
storied past.</TE>
<TE>   This might be the last game in the "old" venue. After the Bears'
final game this season, Soldier Field will close down for a year and
a $587-million makeover. If the Rams beat the Packers Sunday, the
Bears--if they win today--will play next week in St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   "The old field might have a trick or two left," Bear quarterback
Jim Miller said. "Let's hope the trick is on the Eagles and not us."</TE>

<HD>Warner Not a Smooth Talker Yet</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>St. Louis Ram quarterback Kurt Warner gave his voice more of a test
in practice Friday, and the team expects no problems in Sunday's
playoff game against Green Bay.</LD>
<LD>   Warner's vocal cords were bruised in the regular-season finale
Jan. 6 when he took a blow to the throat. He hasn't talked to
reporters since then, but has been speaking softly in the huddle and
on the line of scrimmage.</LD>
<LD>   His voice was inaudible from the sidelines on Thursday, and could
barely be heard Friday. He also began talking in meetings on
Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   "They evaluated him again last night and he's not quite completely
normal," Coach Mike Martz said. "But he's as close as you can get
without being normal.</TE>
<TE>   "They called it miraculous how well and how fast his throat has
healed."</TE>
<TE>   Against the Packers, Warner will wear an elongated facemask
designed to protect him against further injury.</TE>
<TE>   Offensive tackle Ryan Tucker has not practiced all week because of
a sprained ankle sustained in the season finale, and backup Rod Jones
likely will start in his place. Jones started one game, against the
Jets in Week 6, and has played as a reserve in five others.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time all season, Ram players will spend the night
before the game in a hotel. Martz said it will help eliminate
distractions for him as well.</TE>
<TE>   "In a game like this, there's so many friends and relatives in
town for the players and coaches alike that it gives them an
opportunity to get away from everything and stay focused on the
game," Martz said. "Even my own relatives, they don't fully
understand the day of the game or the day before the game, trying to
get yourself ready to play emotionally and mentally."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Green Bay Packer Coach Mike Sherman has decided to use Allen
Rossum on kickoff returns instead of Dorsey Levens in Sunday's
playoff game at St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Rossum hasn't returned a kickoff since Thanksgiving, but Levens
has a tender left shoulder. Tod McBride will be used as Rossum's lead
blocker.</TE>
<TE>   "Dorsey dinged that shoulder, and I really need him to help us on
the offensive side of the ball," Sherman said. "If, in fact, we need
him back there we'll put him back there. But right now, we're going
to go with Rossum and McBride back there."</TE>
<TE>   Rossum, in his first game since arthroscopic knee surgery in late
November, returned punts in Green Bay's first-round playoff victory
over San Francisco last week. But he also interfered with Levens on
two kickoff returns, which netted only 24 yards. Levens was injured
on the second return.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chicago Bear offensive guard Rex Tucker practiced for a second day
and expects to play in today's playoff game against the Philadelphia
Eagles.</TE>
<TE>   Tucker has been nursing a strained calf since the Bears'
regular-season finale against Jacksonville. He missed most of the
second half of that game.</TE>
<TE>   "It's taken longer than I wanted to, I think," Tucker said. "It's
feeling OK today."</TE>

<HD>Parcells Won't Coach Bucs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bill Parcells rejected the Tampa Bay Buccaneers--again.</LD>
<LD>   The two-time Super Bowl champion coach said Friday night that he
will not return to the sideline with Tampa Bay or any other team.</LD>
<LD>   "Bill Parcells, early this evening, told us that he would not be
returning to coaching," Buccaneer executive vice president Joel
Glazer said. "In our continued pursuit of a championship, we remain
confident that our new coach will utilize the solid foundation that
we have built to achieve our goals."</LD>
<TE>   Parcells, meanwhile, told CNNSI.com and Sporting News Radio that
he wasn't able to make the commitment necessary to do the job.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope that convinces everybody that I'm not coming back. Because
I'm not. This is it. I'm staying retired," Parcells told CNNSI.com
from his home in New Jersey. "The demands of the job and what it
would take for me to succeed were just too much."</TE>
<TE>   It's the second time in 10 years that Parcells has spurned the
Bucs, who also pursued him after the 1991 season only to be turned
down at the last minute.</TE>
<TE>   The first indication that the plan to hire Parcells was falling
apart came when the Jets announced Friday evening that Mike
Tannenbaum, thought to be Parcells' hand-picked choice to be Tampa
Bay's new general manager, was remaining in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Friday, the Buccaneers confirmed receiving a letter from
the NFL warning Parcells and the team that they could be punished for
trying to hire coaches and officials under contract to other teams.</TE>
<TE>   The tampering warning came in a letter from Jeff Pash, the NFL's
counsel, to Tampa Bay General Manager Rich McKay after reports that
Parcells was assembling a staff that includes people still under
contract to other NFL teams.</TE>
<TE>   The Parcells situation also has had an impact on the Pro Football
Hall of Fame ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Parcells, a finalist last season, is again among the 15 finalists
this year. But because a coach isn't eligible while he is still
coaching, he would be removed from the ballot were he to come out of
retirement.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former Buccaneer coach Tony Dungy was in Charlotte, N.C., to
interview for the Carolina Panthers' vacant head coaching job.</TE>
<TE>   Dungy, fired as Tampa Bay's coach earlier this week, had dinner
with team officials Friday night and was expected to remain in
Charlotte Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Dungy, also a candidate for the Indianapolis job, said Panther
founder and owner Jerry Richardson makes the Carolina job an
intriguing one for him.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the biggest thing I've heard is the ownership and how
it's first class and they've got great facilities and good people,"
Dungy said. "And I think that is what you want to be around."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   San Diego Charger General Manager John Butler said his interview
with Marty Schottenheimer went well, but offered little else as the
coaching search extended to nearly three weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a chance to visit and converse and really that is all I
can say," Butler said after returning from Las Vegas, where he met
with Schottenheimer on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Butler wouldn't say if he made an offer.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to say anything other than we had a conversation,"
Butler said.</TE>
<TE>   The general manager plans to interview New York Jets defensive
coordinator Ted Cottrell on Monday in Mobile, Ala., site of the
Senior Bowl. By then, Cottrell will have interviewed with
Indianapolis and Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota Viking tight end Byron Chamberlain and New England
Patriot receiver Troy Brown were selected as replacements for next
month's Pro Bowl. Chamberlain will take the place of Carolina's
Wesley Walls, who has an injured knee. Brown will replace Denver's
Rod Smith. It was not immediately known why Smith pulled out of the
Feb. 9 game in Honolulu.... Warren Sapp, Tampa Bay's all-pro
defensive tackle, underwent arthroscopic surgery to repair a slightly
torn rotator cuff in his left shoulder. The team said Sapp should
ready for contact work by early summer.... Arizona Cardinal left
guard Pete Kendall, who missed the season's final five games with a
foot injury, will undergo surgery Tuesday. The team said Kendall is
expected to be ready for training camp in July.</TE>

<HD>Hull Left Behind After Robitaille Goal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hall of famer Bobby Hull saw two of his records fall on Friday night
at Detroit--one to his son.</LD>
<LD>   Former King Luc Robitaille passed Hull to become the most prolific
goal-scoring left wing in NHL history and also had an assist as the
Detroit Red Wings defeated the Washington Capitals, 3-1.</LD>
<LD>   Brett Hull also scored to pass his father for third place on the
all-time list of game-winning goals with 99.</LD>
<TE>   Robitaille scored his 611th goal 1:50 into the game when he tipped
in a shot from the point by Kirk Maltby.</TE>
<TE>   It was Robitaille's 21st goal of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Hull watched the game from the Joe Louis Arena stands.</TE>
<TE>   "What are records for?" he asked. "And I'm glad to see these young
guys set them."</TE>
<TE>   Hull presented Robitaille with a cigar after the game for breaking
his record, one that Brett had given him.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know who to give it to, Brett or Luc," Bobby Hull said.
"I'll give Brett my love."</TE>
<TE>   Robitaille said the milestone was extra special because of Bobby
Hull's presence.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be meaningful once I retire," he said of the
record, "but I don't want to stop here. I want to keep going and win
a Cup here."</TE>
<TE>   Brett Hull got what turned out to be the game winner with 45.3
seconds left in the first period to break a 1-1 tie.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't realize there was a record for me to break," Brett Hull
said. "I'm excited for Luc. For you to go by someone of that status
and legendary stature, it's great."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Florida 3, Dallas 2--Marcus Nilson and Niklas Hagman had goals
5:36 apart in the second period and the Panthers ended a four-game
losing streak with a victory at Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   Viktor Kozlov also scored for the Panthers, who had been shut out
in their last two games and three of their previous six.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 3, Columbus 1--Filip Kuba had two power-play goals and
Manny Fernandez stopped 25 shots as the Wild defeated the Blue
Jackets at Columbus, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   Marian Gaborik chipped in with his 17th goal and an assist and
Andrew Brunette had two assists for the Wild, which ended a four-game
winless streak.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 2, Tampa Bay 2--Martin St. Louis had both goals for the
Lightning as it tied the Blackhawks at Tampa, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Sullivan had a goal and an assist for Chicago, which is
12-3-1 over its last 16 games.</TE>

<HD>Lawsuit Is Race's Latest Turn</HD>
<DH>Olympics: Smith says he was defamed when O'Hare accused him
of fixing a speedskating event at trials.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Short-track speedskater Rusty Smith of Sunset Beach, accused by
former teammate Tommy O'Hare of conspiring to fix a race at the U.S.
Olympic trials to keep O'Hare off the team and help Shani Davis
qualify, has filed a defamation suit against O'Hare.</LD>
<LD>   Smith's suit, filed Thursday in District Court in El Paso County,
Colo., contends O'Hare's charges have damaged his reputation and
caused him humiliation, pain and mental anguish, and could result in
a potential loss of sponsorships. It also contends Smith has
experienced "loss of concentration and appetite and other physical
suffering."</LD>
<LD>   No damages were specified. According to Colorado law, damages
would be requested at trial.</LD>
<TE>   O'Hare, a 1998 Olympian, claimed Smith and Apolo Anton Ohno agreed
to hold back in the 1,000-meter race Dec. 22 at the Utah Olympic Oval
so Davis could make the team for the Salt Lake City Winter Games. Ron
Biondo, who finished fourth, has also said he believes Ohno blocked
him from overtaking Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Biondo had to finish ahead of Smith to win a spot in the 1,000,
and Davis had to win the race to accrue enough points to finish among
the top six and earn the final spot on the team.</TE>
<TE>   Davis won, ending Ohno's seven-race winning streak, Smith was
second and Ohno was third. Ohno later said he "played it safe"
because he had secured an Olympic berth and wanted to avoid injury.
He denied colluding with Smith.</TE>
<TE>   O'Hare told the St. Louis Post Dispatch the supposed agreement
between Smith and Ohno was "a typical case of 'You scratch my back;
I'll scratch yours,'" and added, "Rusty needed Biondo blocked and
Apolo said, 'Sure, I'll help you out, but you have to let Shani
win.'"</TE>
<TE>   O'Hare filed a complaint last week with U.S. Speedskating--the
sport's national governing body--alleging a conspiracy to deny him a
spot on the team. He asked that Smith and Ohno be dropped from the
team for violating U.S. Speedskating's Code of Conduct and asked to
be reinstated to the roster.</TE>
<TE>   An arbitration hearing has been scheduled for Tuesday at the U.S.
Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, Colo. However, U.S.
Speedskating asked independent arbitrator John Holbrook to remove
himself from the case because it claims any suspicions about the race
should have been raised by the referees on the day of the race. The
referees took no action. Holbrook will decide next week whether he
has jurisdiction.</TE>
<TE>   O'Hare's attorney, John Collins, said he had received statements
from several people supporting O'Hare. However, only Biondo has come
forward.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, the Olympics are fake," Biondo, who made the team for only
the relay, told the Cleveland Plain-Dealer. "On one hand, I feel,
yeah, they should be on the team, they earned it. But if it was
football and they threw a game, they would be kicked out of the
sport. I am just glad I'm not the one to make the decision."</TE>
<TE>   Biondo also said he heard Ohno yell, "Don't pass! Don't pass!"
during the race, apparently to Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, reached Friday at the U.S. Olympic Training Center in
Colorado Springs, declined to comment on the advice of his attorney,
Ed Williams. He told The Times the day after the race that he hadn't
manipulated the outcome in any way. "Absolutely nothing happened," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement released by Williams, Smith said: "Any allegation
that there was a fix, conspiracy, understanding or any other word
between Apolo and me or anyone else to let Shani win the race is
completely false. Shani is a great, athlete [and] skated a great race
and deserves to be on the team."</TE>
<TE>   Smith has been on the U.S. senior national team since 1996. He and
Ohno are considered Olympic medal contenders and were the only
skaters to qualify at three individual distances and the 5,000-meter
relay.</TE>
<TE>   "He has been defamed. He has been accused, essentially, of a
crime," said Williams, a 1968 Olympic biathlon participant. "He has
been damaged.... He has been distracted and frustrated. It's an
anxious time for him. No one likes to be accused of a crime when
you're innocent.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very stressful time for athletes, when they're trying
for the Olympics, and there are a lot of emotions involved. It
happened to me the first time I tried to make the team. Athletes deal
with their disappointment in different ways. Some blame the coach,
some say the coffee wasn't hot enough, some blame the ice.
Unfortunately, in this case, Tommy O'Hare is blaming his former
teammate."</TE>

<HD>Pepperdine Packs More Punch, 88-79</HD>
<DH>College basketball: Waves get big lift from McGowan in
defeating No. 13 Gonzaga to take lead in West Coast Conference race.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROB FERNAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Instead of throwing punches, Glen McGowan is finally doing what his
Pepperdine coaches expected all along--playing knockout basketball.</LD>
<LD>   The Wave forward, playing in only his fourth game after serving a
suspension for instigating a fight with a teammate in the school
library, helped close the books on No. 13-ranked Gonzaga's 12-game
winning streak by coming off the bench Friday night to spark an 88-79
upset before a boisterous sellout crowd of 3,547 at Firestone
Fieldhouse.</LD>
<LD>   McGowan finished with 19 points and nine rebounds, and scored 15
in the second half when the Waves erased a two-point halftime
deficit. His fallaway jump shot from the baseline gave Pepperdine the
lead for good, 62-61, with 8:25 to play.</LD>
<TE>   "He doesn't even know the plays yet," Coach Paul Westphal said.
"He's got great athletic ability--he's a tank. He plays bigger than
his size."</TE>
<TE>   McGowan, a 6-foot-8, 220-pound sophomore, muscled inside for six
of Pepperdine's 24 offensive rebounds. Although Gonzaga entered the
game leading the nation with a plus-11.1 rebounding margin, the Waves
held a 47-33 rebounding edge.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought the key to the game was the student body and the way we
rebounded," Westphal said. "Gonzaga is one of the best rebounding
teams in the country and we dominated the boards."</TE>
<TE>   The Waves needed every rebound in a game they shot 40% (30 for
75).</TE>
<TE>   With its fifth consecutive victory, Pepperdine (10-6, 3-0) moved
into sole possession of first place in the West Coast Conference and
ended a three-game losing streak to Gonzaga (15-3, 2-1).</TE>
<TE>   The Waves defended well against point guard Dan Dickau, holding
the WCC's leading scorer to 15 points and forcing him into eight
turnovers, although Bulldog Coach Mark Few disputed that number.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman guard Terrance Johnson led Pepperdine with 21 points,
including a three-point basket for a 76-66 lead with 3:34 to play.
Forward Boomer Brazzle had 15 points and 12 rebounds, and Jimmy
Miggins scored 12, including the Waves' final field goal on a shot in
the key with three minutes left, making the score, 78-68.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine made 10 of 12 free throws in the final 1:55 to stave
off the Bulldogs and set off a on-court celebration by students at
the buzzer.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzaga, which got a game-high 25 points from center Zach Gourde,
closed the first half with a 7-0 run in the final 1:47 to take a
36-34 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine got off to a strong start with the help of some flashy
plays, getting an ally-oop dunk from Johnson and two blocks from
6-foot-11 center Cedric Suitt in the first six minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The Waves were more effective on the boards, getting 15 offensive
rebounds in the first half to create second chances.</TE>
<TE>   Dickau, who had five points in the first half, entered the game
leading the WCC in scoring with a 19.4 average.</TE>

<HD>UCLA Plays Team in a Zone</HD>
<DH>College basketball: Bruins must solve Wildcats' stifling
defense if they hope to end winless streak at Tucson.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TUCSON</DL>
<LD>It's a bit like the rookie who makes it to the World Series, takes it
for granted and never gets there again.</LD>
<LD>   On Feb. 13, 1997, two days after the interim tag was peeled from
Steve Lavin's title as UCLA coach, the Bruins swaggered into McKale
Center and knocked off national championship-bound Arizona, 66-64.</LD>
<LD>   Too bad it's nothing but an uplifting campfire story to current
Bruins. Even fifth-year seniors Billy Knight and Rico Hines know only
losses here, by margins of 12, 17, 15 and 25 points from 1998-2001.</LD>
<TE>   Those games are retold as horror stories. There's the loudest
crowd in the Pacific 10 Conference (Stanford's Casey Jacobson says
so). There's the most unflappable coach (Cool Hand Lute Olson). There
are Wildcat streaks that spread like wildfire.</TE>
<TE>   "They go on killer spurts, not 10-2 spurts, but 28-2 spurts with
dunks, layups and threes like a blur," Bruin guard Jason Kapono said.
"That's how they beat you."</TE>
<TE>   USC can add testimony. The Trojans fell behind, 34-7, and lost by
17 to No. 15 Arizona (12-4, 5-2 in the conference) Thursday night
while No. 9 UCLA (13-3, 5-1) slipped past Arizona State.</TE>
<TE>   The Wildcats' stifling 3-2 zone defense with long-armed 6-foot-8
Luke Walton in the middle swallowed up 5-10 Trojan point guard
Brandon Granville, who was scoreless. UCLA point guard Cedric Bozeman
is 6-6, so Walton might give him less trouble.</TE>
<TE>   But the Arizona junior whose father, Bill, was a UCLA legend, can
hurt in many ways. He had a career game against USC, with 27 points,
11 rebounds and 10 assists, making amends for losing his composure
last Saturday in a victory at Washington, when he received a
technical foul and sat much of the second half because of four
personals.</TE>
<TE>   "I apologized to everybody on the team," he said. "I lost my
composure and I can't do that. The team needs me in there."</TE>
<TE>   Olson said it was the best performance he has seen at McKale
Center.</TE>
<TE>   "Luke was great not only from the offensive standpoint, but he was
really key in the middle of the zone defense," he said. "I've seen
triple-doubles, but I'm not sure I've seen anyone do it better."</TE>
<TE>   Arizona, which upset then-No. 2 Maryland, No. 5 Florida and No. 5
Illinois early in the season, is hardly a one-man team, despite four
starters departing for the NBA after last season's NCAA final.</TE>
<TE>   Junior point guard Jason Gardner averages 21.2 points and 4.9
assists. Junior forward Rick Anderson, a longtime friend of Kapono
who grew up in Long Beach, averages 13.4.</TE>
<TE>   And the Wildcats have a freshman class that has been superior to
UCLA's trio of Bozeman, Dijon Thompson and Andre Patterson.</TE>
<TE>   Two are starters--guard Salim Stoudamire averages 12.1 points and
6-10 center Channing Frye averages 9.3 points and 6.7 rebounds. Guard
Will Bynum, forward Dennis Latimore and center Isaiah Fox get
generous minutes off the bench.</TE>
<TE>   The drawback of playing so many freshmen--as Lavin and Olson have
discovered--is that for every highlight there is a breakdown.</TE>
<TE>   "A big reason we play zone defense is to keep the older
guys--Walton, Gardner and Anderson--out of foul trouble," Olson said.
"Even so, we had four freshmen in the lineup against USC for a
stretch. Defensively, it takes time for them to get coordinated.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't do a great job of communicating switches with the
freshmen. It makes a big difference when Luke is out there with them.
He's like a security blanket."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA also plays a lot of zone. And plays a lot of freshmen. And
has a forward performing well enough to take over a game.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Barnes has scored 80 points in his last three games. But it
is his well-rounded game that impresses Olson.</TE>
<TE>   "Barnes is shooting the lights out and he's their leading assist
man," Olson said. "He's playing as well as anybody--period."</TE>
<TE>   So the teams are similar and about equal. The difference could be
the home-court advantage.</TE>
<TE>   "I told the freshmen to stay poised, it gets real loud during
their patented runs," Hines said.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA is 3-0 against ranked opponents (USC was not ranked when it
beat the Bruins). In fact, UCLA has not played better than in
victories against Kansas, Georgetown and Alabama. But two of those
games were at home and one was at the friendly Wooden Classic.</TE>
<TE>   "Winning on the road against a good team is important," Knight
said. "Winning at Arizona is like a mission. It's something we've
never done. It's something we want to do. And this is the last chance
for some of us."</TE>

<DL>TEMPE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>In preparing to face Arizona State today, how difficult will it be
for No. 18 USC to bounce back from Thursday night's 97-80 loss at No.
15 Arizona?</LD>
<LD>   Not very, at least for Trojan senior Sam Clancy.</LD>
<LD>   "For me, it shouldn't be too hard," he said. "I mean, I'm used to
getting my butt kicked down there [at Arizona] then going down to
Arizona State and kicking their butt. That's been the trend for the
seniors and I think we should be all right."</LD>
<TE>   While the Trojans have lost 17 in a row at Arizona, they are 10-7
at Arizona State since 1985. Clancy, who had 30 points and 11
rebounds against the Wildcats, is 2-0 in games played at the Sun
Devils' home. The power forward sat out USC's 93-81 loss there in
2000 because of a broken foot.</TE>
<TE>   USC Coach Henry Bibby said the Trojans, who fell into a
first-place tie in the Pacific 10 Conference with No. 9 UCLA and No.
23 Oregon at 5-1, would be more than happy to come home from the
desert with a split.</TE>
<TE>   But it might not happen if senior point guard Brandon Granville
has another disappearing act.</TE>
<TE>   "Brandon didn't show up [against Arizona]," said Bibby, who would
later give Granville and Clancy hugs for their troubles. "I mean, he
was 0 for 7 [from the field] and was not a factor in the game. We
can't go into places and have our guys that we depend on be
nonfactors."</TE>
<TE>   It was the fifth time, but the first since his sophomore year,
that Granville was held scoreless.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no rhyme or reason to it," the four-year starter said.
"I just missed some shots early and that was it. I've been there
before, so I can shake it off and not dwell over it."</TE>
<TE>   Said Bibby: "It's tougher once you're on top. We're 5-0 [in
conference] and it's tougher to keep that same edge, I guess. This
week, some of the guys didn't lift like they were supposed to, they
didn't shoot. You get a little fat. So this is good for us. This
humbles us and it should get us focused again.</TE>

<TE>   Update--Arizona State Coach Rob Evans is 0-22 against ranked teams
since coming to Tempe in 1998.... Sun Devil senior center Chad
Prewitt is averaging 20.9 points and 7.9 rebounds over the last eight
games.... Said Bibby: "We know Arizona State is physical. They grab,
they hold, they shove, they push, they come over your back. They'll
be the most physical team we've played. Let's see what we're made
of."</TE>

<HD>Offense Is His Bermuda Triangle</HD>
<DH>Lakers: Walker, still struggling to learn system, will play
a big role against his former team, San Antonio.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. ADANDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Samaki Walker saw the view from the other side last season, sitting
on the San Antonio Spurs' bench when the Lakers blasted them out of
the Western Conference finals in a four-game sweep. Actually it was
more like fore-gone; in other words, the outcome of the two games in
Los Angeles was a foregone conclusion after the Lakers won the first
two games in San Antonio.</LD>
<LD>   "You could read it in their faces," Walker said of the Spurs.
"'OK, let's go ahead and get it over with.'"</LD>
<LD>   After leaving the Spurs as a free agent and signing a two-year,
$2.94-million contract with the Lakers last summer, Walker quickly
learned the Laker attitude: "Expect to win," Walker said. "No matter
how many points we're down, expect to win."</LD>
<TE>   Now comes the hard part of Samaki's switch: guarding San Antonio
power forward Tim Duncan. Walker is back in San Antonio with the
Lakers today in a big Western Conference game. The matchup is less
appealing because Shaquille O'Neal is serving the final game of his
three-game suspension for throwing a punch at Chicago's Brad Miller a
week ago. And it makes Walker's task even more difficult, since he'll
probably get a heavy dose of Spur center David Robinson in addition
to Duncan.</TE>
<TE>   From his days in practice, he knows you have to make Duncan try to
beat you off the dribble instead of simply turning and shooting. He
knows Duncan likes to spin toward the middle. And he knows that, come
playoff time, it's going to be Duncan or Chris Webber or Kevin
Garnett or some all-star lined up against him at power forward.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers won the first two championships of the 2000s with A.C.
Green and Horace Grant--power forwards who peaked in the 1980s and
1990s, respectively. Now they have a player with upside--although six
seasons into his career, he's reaching the point where upside needs
to be converted into results.</TE>
<TE>   On a Laker team that's all about winning now, the coaching staff
still talks about Walker in terms of his potential.</TE>
<TE>   "He can continue to grow in a system where, obviously, he's not a
dominant player," assistant coach Jim Cleamons said. "He can come in
and be a role player. As his role grows, I think his skills will also
improve.</TE>
<TE>   "If he's patient with himself, if he continues to work hard every
day, he's going to have a good career."</TE>
<TE>   Walker enjoys the most success when he takes advantage of his
athleticism and his 6-foot-9 frame. He blocks shots, grabs rebounds
and dunks on people when O'Neal and Kobe Bryant pass him the ball.</TE>
<TE>   It's working the triangle offense that gives him the most
problems. An example from a recent game in Minnesota: Walker passed
the ball in the post to O'Neal. As O'Neal started to pass out to
Walker, Walker cut to the basket. The ball bounced past where Walker
had been standing and landed out of bounds.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got quite a ways to go before he finds that natural flow in
the offense where he knows what to do and how to get the team doing
what they have to do," Laker Coach Phil Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   "He's still kind of self-conscious about where he's at on the
floor. But his defense has been great, rebounding's been terrific.
Those are the things that really make up for whatever learning curve
he's still in.</TE>
<TE>   "We need him to participate. It doesn't mean he scores or
anything, it's just participate in the offense, keep the offense in a
fluid format."</TE>
<TE>   Walker calls it "a process."</TE>
<TE>   "The triangle itself takes some adjusting to," he said. "You have
to learn the offense and then you have to learn how to read the
offense, how the guys are playing it.</TE>
<TE>   "There are two different ways of approaching it. And then you're
the learning the guys you're playing with. Kobe and his
characteristics, Shaq and his characteristics, [Rick] Fox and [Derek]
Fisher. It's a process.</TE>
<TE>   "I get kind of comfortable with it, learning what I can do, how to
rebound out of the triangle offense. Sometimes I find myself on the
wing, and you've got to get yourself in position to get those
rebounds. Sometimes you've got to be a pressure-release guy to get
the easy baskets when guys are doubling Shaq and Kobe.</TE>
<TE>   "As of late, I've been finding ways to get the ball and get those
eight, nine, 10 points."</TE>
<TE>   One of the recurring sights is Bryant harping on Walker for one
mistake or another. But you have yet to see Walker respond with a
full-fledged argument.</TE>
<TE>   "Criticism, it's good," Walker said. "You've got to be able to
accept that. I want to get better. I want to learn this offense to a
T, where it's second nature. If you don't accept that criticism, then
there's no way possible you can expect to get better."</TE>
<TE>   It's easier to take on-court criticism when there's locker-room
harmony. This might be the most peaceful, single-agenda locker room
the Lakers have had.</TE>
<TE>   They know that if they all do what they're supposed to, it should
result in a championship.</TE>
<TE>   "I can taste it and I can feel it," Walker said. "I feel that
energy, I feel the vibe of this team."</TE>
<TE>   It's a team filled with players who know their roles. In Walker's
case, that's to figure out the offense, score when open and defend
against the elite power forwards in the league.</TE>
<TE>   Another example from that Minnesota game: Garnett going at and
around Robert Horry at will, but settling for jump shots against
Walker. That could turn out to be the real way to measure Walker's
success.</TE>

<LD>Dodger left-hander Odalis Perez, acquired from the Atlanta Braves in
the Gary Sheffield trade, agreed to terms on a one-year, $625,000
contract Friday. With shortstop Alex Cora secured to a one-year,
$625,000 deal earlier this week, the Dodgers will have no arbitration
cases this spring.</LD>
<LD>   Perez, who went 7-8 with a 4.91 earned-run average in 24 games
(951/3 innings) last season, is expected to compete for a rotation
spot, but the 23-year-old Dominican also can pitch in relief.</LD>

<HD>Fehr to Players: Talks With Owners Remain at Stalemate</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN BOLCH and JOHN KLIMA</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the start of spring training nearly a month away, Donald Fehr,
executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Assn., told a
gathering of about 30 players at the Manhattan Beach Marriott on
Friday that negotiations with owners on a new collective bargaining
agreement remained at a stalemate.</LD>
<LD>   But Fehr stressed afterward that it was too early to determine
whether a deal could be reached to avoid a work stoppage.</LD>
<LD>   "A work stoppage is the last thing players want at any given
time," Fehr said. "It's always the last resort that you get to, only
if there are important issues and all other reasonable efforts to
find a way to resolve them satisfactorily have failed."</LD>
<TE>   Dodger outfielder Shawn Green said he was cautiously optimistic
that an agreement could be reached, especially since Fehr did not
convey a sense of urgency.</TE>
<TE>   "[Fehr] just told us to be patient," Green said. "We're kind of
waiting to see what happens and where it's going."</TE>
<TE>   Wrapping up a week of meetings with players that also included
stops in Atlanta and Phoenix, Fehr did not indicate the status of the
negotiations, only that both sides were plowing ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "What you do is you go in each day and you hope that that's the
day you're going to find a way to make the breakthrough to reach an
agreement," Fehr said.</TE>
<TE>   Fehr's meeting came one day after he took the unusual step of
addressing owners in an attempt to improve the bitter relations that
have often divided players and owners since the 1994 player strike.</TE>
<TE>   Friday, Fehr was back to addressing his constituency, which was
eager to learn about the latest developments.</TE>
<TE>   "Players are cautious," Fehr said. "They want to be involved, they
want to be kept up to date and they want to know on an ongoing basis
what the circumstances are."</TE>
<TE>   Said Kansas City pitcher Jeff Suppan: "It's my first time going
through this. I just wanted to learn some of the history and get an
idea where this is going."</TE>
<TE>   Fehr also said there remained "a lot of uncertainty" regarding the
possible elimination of two teams.</TE>

<LD>The sophomore jinx almost struck Courtney Mathewson a week before
Christmas.</LD>
<LD>   Mathewson, an All-Southern Section Division I selection as a
freshman at Anaheim Canyon High last season, slammed her right hand
into a teammate's forearm as she followed through on a shot. The
impact split the webbing between her middle and ring fingers and
caused a frightful scene for those in the pool.</LD>
<LD>   "I thought I broke my fingers," Mathewson said. "But when I looked
there was blood running down my hand."</LD>
<TE>   Mathewson needed six stitches to close the wound. The Comanches
had no games over the holidays, but Mathewson was scheduled to play
for the U.S. youth national "B" team at the NorAm tournament in Los
Alamitos right after Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   Determined to play despite the injury, Mathewson had the stitches
taken out a few hours before the first game, taped her fingers
together and ignored the pain.</TE>
<TE>   "That didn't surprise me," said Courtney's sister, Lauren, who
also plays for Canyon. "Last year, she got her lip split open during
a game and kept on playing."</TE>
<TE>   Mathewson still tapes her fingers together, but the pain and
tenderness, which were most apparent when she caught a pass, have
subsided. Although she's not on pace to match the 96 goals she scored
last season, Mathewson is still the most dangerous player on a team
ranked ninth by The Times.</TE>
<TE>   "She's a trooper," Canyon Coach Matt Slevcove said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Headed east: Crescenta Valley goalkeeper Amy Brunton is on a
recruiting trip this weekend to Hartwick College in Oneonta, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Hartwick?</TE>
<TE>   "I've always wanted to go to New York," Brunton said. "And this
happened to be a good opportunity because they have water polo."</TE>
<TE>   Founded in 1797, Hartwick is a liberal arts and sciences college
with approximately 1,400 students, one-third of whom play sports. The
women's water polo team at Hartwick made its Division I debut in
2000; it is one of only two sports on campus that compete in the
NCAA's top division.</TE>
<TE>   Brunton was an All-Southern Section Division III selection last
year, leading Crescenta Valley into the section semifinals. She has
helped the Falcons to a 20-2 start this season.</TE>
<TE>   While Brunton has provided the defense, Jessie Stiles, Megan
Winchell and Laura Claessens have sparked the offense for the
Falcons, ranked second in Division III.</TE>
<TE>   "The girls are playing much better than they did three or four
weeks ago," Crescenta Valley Coach Peter Kim said. "We're feeding off
of our defense and executing much better on offense."</TE>
<TE>   Crescenta Valley plays host to Glendale in a Pacific League game
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking ahead: Some of the best matchups this week are today. No.
3 Santa Margarita travels to No. 6 Corona del Mar for a nonleague
game at 1 p.m. Two of San Diego County's top programs will travel
north, with No. 4 Santa Barbara playing Carlsbad at Carpinteria High
at 1 and Coronado playing at No. 8 Lake Forest El Toro at 2.</TE>

<HD>Santa Catalina Stakes Part of Siphonic Plan</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: The 3-year-old makes his Santa Anita debut as
he begins the road to Kentucky Derby.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Another race, another track. If someone in the country hasn't seen
Siphonic run by now, it's because he or she hasn't been paying
attention.</LD>
<LD>   Making his Santa Anita debut today, Siphonic will add another
sticker to his trunk when he runs against five rival
3-year-olds--none of them a stakes winner--in the Santa Catalina
Stakes. The 11/16-mile Santa Catalina is part of trainer David
Hofmans' three-race plan to prepare Siphonic for the Kentucky Derby
at Churchill Downs on May 4. Also on the colt's schedule are the San
Felipe Stakes on March 17 and the Santa Anita Derby on April 6.</LD>
<LD>   The well-traveled Siphonic, who is considered one of the early
favorites for the Kentucky Derby, has been described by his owners,
John and Jerry Amerman, as an "intelligent horse," and that may be a
good thing, so he knows where he has been and where he's going. His
first four starts have come over different tracks and today he'll be
tested by yet another surface.</LD>
<TE>   Siphonic's racing career began at Del Mar, where he beat maidens
on Aug. 26. Hofmans saw enough in that race to ramrod his horse into
two-turn stakes competition, and Siphonic dusted the opposition at
Keeneland, winning the Lane's End Breeders' Futurity by six lengths
on Oct. 6.</TE>
<TE>   After that, it was on to Belmont Park for the Breeders' Cup
Juvenile three weeks later. The inside of the track was a lost cause
that day, but despite drawing the No. 1 post Siphonic still ran
third, behind Johannesburg and Repent. He was beaten by 21/2 lengths.
Hofmans closed out the colt's 2-year-old year on Dec. 15 with the
Hollywood Futurity, a race that produced a 31/2-length win. That was
Siphonic's first race over the track on which he regularly trains.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got our fingers crossed that he'll continue to develop,"
said John Amerman, who bought the son of Siphon and Cherokee Crossing
for $210,000 at a Keeneland yearling sale. "He's maturing nicely and
has put on 50 or 60 pounds in the last couple of months. He already
seems to know what it's all about. He acts like he's a 4- or
5-year-old. When photographers come around and he hears the camera
click, he comes to attention and poses for them."</TE>
<TE>   Amerman Racing enjoyed an exceptional year, racing horses that
earned almost $3 million in 2001, but most of their successes came
with older horses, including Grade I winners Lido Palace and
Happyanunoit. With a coast-to-coast operation, they use six trainers
and turned to Hofmans, because of his reputation, to develop their
young horses. In 1997, Hofmans spoiled Silver Charm's Triple Crown
bid when he saddled Touch Gold to win the Belmont Stakes. Last year,
Hofmans had another precocious 3-year-old in Millennium Wind. That
horse won the Santa Catalina and the Blue Grass Stakes, but while
battling a skin infection dropped off the Triple Crown trail after
finishing 11th in the Kentucky Derby.</TE>
<TE>   The Florida-based Jerry Bailey, who set a record last year when
his horses earned more than $20 million, rode Siphonic in the
Breeders' Cup and the Hollywood Futurity and will be aboard again
today. Like other owners, the Amermans have been aware of Bailey's
skills for a long time, but there was an afternoon in August 2000
when it really hit home, up close and personal, just how talented he
is. Snow Polina, ridden by Bailey, had just beaten Happyanunoit by
one length in the Beverly D. Stakes at Arlington Park when John
Amerman turned to his wife and said: "We've got to get him to ride
some of our horses one of these days."</TE>
<TE>   That day came in 2001, with Lido Palace in the Whitney Handicap
and the Woodward, and with Siphonic in the Breeders' Cup. Chris
McCarron, who had ridden Siphonic for both his maiden win and the
victory at Keeneland, elected to ride Came Home--another undefeated
colt--at Belmont Park, freeing the Amermans to recruit Bailey. With
his new rider, Siphonic wasn't quite good enough against
Johannesburg, the powerful Irish entry, but when Bailey got off
Siphonic he said to Hofmans: "I want to ride this horse again. I'll
even pay my way there if I have to."</TE>
<TE>   A lot of good horses have won the Santa Catalina, but the last
horse to use this stake as a foundation for winning the Kentucky
Derby was Ferdinand in 1986. Today's edition is a potential break-out
race for all of the starters but Siphonic. National Park is running
on dirt for the first time, and his trainer, Bob Hess Jr., concedes
that he'll be happy with second money. Of the others, Labamta Babe
was fourth, 61/2 lengths behind Siphonic, in the Hollywood Futurity,
and Cottonwood Cowboy is wading into stakes company for the first
time after two fall wins at Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   The $100,000 Holy Bull Stakes, one of the preps for the Florida
Derby, has drawn a field of seven today at Gulfstream Park. The 8-5
morning-line favorite in the 11/16-mile race is Harlan's Holiday, who
finished a distant second to Siphonic at Keeneland, then won a stake
at Churchill Downs to finish his 2-year-old season. At 9-5 is Nokoma,
whose last start, on Nov. 24, was a second to Saarland in the
11/8-mile Remsen at Aqueduct.</TE>

<HD>Leniency Sought for Ohlund</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The NHL Players' Assn. and Swedish Olympic officials have asked the
International Ice Hockey Federation to show leniency toward Vancouver
Canuck defenseman Mattias Ohlund, who tested positive for the banned
drug acetazolamide and could lose his spot on the Swedish Olympic
hockey team at the Salt Lake City Winter Games.</LD>
<LD>   As part of his treatment after undergoing eye surgery Dec. 3,
Ohlund received from his surgeon the drug Diamox, which contains
acetazolamide. Ohlund nearly lost an eye two years ago after being
struck by a puck in an exhibition game, and the procedure last month
cleared scar tissue that had developed.</LD>
<LD>   Acetazolamide is not a performance-enhancing drug, but it can be
used to mask steroids and is on the International Olympic Committee's
list of banned substances. Ohlund submitted a urine sample during a
random, no-advance-notice test conducted by the World Anti-Doping
Agency on Dec. 11, but he did not tell WADA officials he had taken
the drug and said he didn't know it contained a banned substance.</LD>
<TE>   The NHL Players' Assn. resisted efforts to subject players to
random, no-advance-notice testing before the Games, almost
jeopardizing NHL players' participation. However, it eventually
agreed to allow such tests to be done after players were educated
about banned substances and told to avoid such potential dangers as
food supplements.</TE>
<TE>   The IIHF is expected to meet this weekend to review Ohlund's
situation.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't consider this a doping case, at least not with the
information we have now," said Bjorn Folin, a spokesman for the
Swedish Olympic Committee. "It was a mistake by him."</TE>
<TE>   Anders Hedberg, a former World Hockey Assn. and NHL standout who
is general manager of Team Sweden, said he anticipates Ohlund will be
allowed to compete at Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look into the circumstances in Mattias' case, I'm counting
on him playing for us," Hedberg said.</TE>

<LD>Darius Sanders scored 18 points and Gabriel Pruitt had 17 for Compton
Centennial, which moved into sole possession of first place in the
Ocean League boys' basketball race with a 55-44 victory Friday over
host El Segundo.</LD>
<LD>   Pruitt scored 10 points in the fourth quarter, including
consecutive three-point baskets that gave the Apaches a 53-42 lead
with 2:15 to play.</LD>
<LD>   "I was feeling it, so the coach went with that and ran plays to
get me the ball," said Pruitt, a sophomore point guard. "I was trying
to create things off the dribble, and when I couldn't, my teammates
set good screens to get me open looks."</LD>
<TE>   Centennial (17-0, 7-0), ranked No. 3 by The Times, led 39-38 after
three quarters.</TE>
<TE>   Dashawn Strong led the Eagles (17-3, 6-1) with 22 points. He
scored all 10 of El Segundo's points in the third quarter, but was
held scoreless in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Defending league champ El Segundo, ranked No. 16, led 14-11 after
one quarter. Jeramie Hopson finished with 14 points, including a shot
at the buzzer to tie the score, 28-28, at halftime.</TE>

at Hart.</TE>
<TE>   Rich, who quit football to concentrate on basketball, made two
free throws with 16 seconds left to give Hart (17-3, 4-0) a
three-point lead. Canyon (14-6, 2-2) twice got off three-point shots
in the final 16 seconds, but the last one by Richard Ratcliff missed

<HD>Americans Kick Off With Familiar Foe</HD>
<DH>Soccer: U.S.-South Korea Gold Cup game today at the Rose
Bowl is an opening act to their World Cup meeting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fewer than five months from today--on June 10, to be exact--the
national soccer teams of the United States and South Korea will
square off in front of a capacity crowd of 68,014 in Daegu, South
Korea.</LD>
<LD>   The stakes in that game will be enormous. The outcome almost
certainly will determine whether either country has a chance to
advance to the second round of the 2002 World Cup.</LD>
<LD>   Today, far less will be on the line at the Rose Bowl, where the
teams will stage a dress rehearsal of sorts.</LD>
<TE>   Their 3 p.m. game--which follows a 1 p.m. game between El Salvador
and Mexico--marks the opener for both teams in the sixth CONCACAF
Gold Cup. It provides U.S. Coach Bruce Arena and South Korea Coach
Guus Hiddink another opportunity to scout one of their World Cup
opponents at close range.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 9, just days after they had been drawn into the same World
Cup group with the U.S., Portugal and Poland, the South Koreans
defeated the Americans, 1-0, in front of a sellout crowd of 42,256 in
Seogwipo, South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   That was the fourth game between the countries, and the U.S. has
yet to win. South Korea leads the series, 3-0-1.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a little strange, certainly, that this will be the second
time we'll play Korea in about the last six weeks," Arena said.
Regardless of the results, both games are more valuable to the
Americans than the Koreans.</TE>
<TE>   That's because Hiddink is fielding what will be close to his World
Cup lineup. But as many as half of Arena's probable starters are in
Europe and not taking part in the Gold Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Among those missing are goalkeeper Brad Friedel and playmaker
Claudio Reyna, both in England; defender Tony Sanneh, who is in
Germany, and midfielders Earnie Stewart and John O'Brien, both in the
Netherlands.</TE>
<TE>   Several other first-choice players are injured, including central
defenders Eddie Pope and Carlos Llamosa.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not going to see the real U.S. team," Arena said. "On the
other hand, we get a pretty good feel for what Korea's about.</TE>
<TE>   "[South Korea is a] very fit and tenacious team. They defend quite
well and that's probably their strength."</TE>
<TE>   South Korea lost, 1-0, to the Galaxy in a scrimmage on Wednesday,
and afterward, Galaxy midfielder Pete Vagenas and defender Alexi
Lalas provided more insight.</TE>
<TE>   "What they do very well is they fight for every loose ball,
they've got tremendous energy," Vagenas said. "Technically, they all
seem to be very skilled. It's a team that's very organized and tough
to break down."</TE>
<TE>   Lalas, a veteran of the 1994 and 1998 World Cup tournaments,
offered a different perspective.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, they're not going to win the fair-play award," he said
after watching several Galaxy players being roughly shoulder-charged
off the ball.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so hard to judge this far out [from the World Cup] and
everyone's keeping everything pretty close right now. Even in this
[Gold Cup] tournament, no matter how many wins you get, the only
thing that matters for them is that first game against Poland [in
Busan, South Korea, on June 4] and for us against Portugal [on June 5
in Suwon, South Korea].</TE>
<TE>   "Asian countries on the whole have improved their soccer,
especially tactically. They've brought in foreign coaches and a lot
more [Asian] players are playing overseas.</TE>
<TE>   "It used to be the knock was, 'Yeah, they're fit and yeah they're
really, really quick, but they have absolutely no idea what to do
with that.' That's definitely started to change and will be reflected
in the years to come, if not this summer."</TE>
<TE>   In Gold Cup openers: Canada's Kevin McKenna scored twice in a 2-0
win over Haiti in front of 14,508 at the Orange Bowl in Miami. In the
first game, Costa Rica beat Martinique, 2-0. Hernan Medford and
Rolando Fonseca scored goals.</TE>

<HD>Bomb Plot Gets Olson 20 to Life</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles judge sentenced accused Symbionese Liberation Army
member Sara Jane Olson Friday to 20 years to life in prison for her role
in a failed bomb plot to kill LAPD officers in 1975.</LD>
<LD>   Moments later, Olson--who lived as a suburban Midwestern mom while on
the lam for more than two decades--pleaded not guilty to murder charges
in a 1975 Sacramento-area bank robbery that left a mother of four dead.</LD>
<LD>   Former SLA members Emily and William Harris also appeared in court
Friday, in Sacramento, to face murder charges in the same case. And in
Portland, Ore., Olson's brother-in-law Mike Bortin appeared on a fugitive
charge as California authorities attempt to extradite him.</LD>
<TE>   Friday's hearings launched the court proceedings for the four former
1970s radicals who were arrested Wednesday on suspicion of murdering
Myrna Opsahl, 42, as she entered the Carmichael bank branch to deposit
church offering receipts. Murder charges have also been filed against
Olson's former boyfriend, James Kilgore, who has remained underground for
a quarter of a century. Sacramento prosecutors say some of the $15,390
netted from the Crocker National Bank branch robbery paid for explosives
to be used by the SLA in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   During Olson's emotional hourlong hearing in Los Angeles County
Superior Court, the St. Paul, Minn., mother of three downplayed her role
in the attempted bombing of two LAPD vehicles and said she simply
provided support to her friends in the SLA. But then, for the first time
in court, Olson, 55, apologized for her actions a generation ago.</TE>
<TE>   "For any mistakes I have made, I accept responsibility," she said,
speaking softly but clearly. "For any pain I have caused, I accept
responsibility. And I am truly sorry."</TE>
<TE>   But an LAPD officer, who prosecutors said narrowly escaped death, was
unforgiving.</TE>
<TE>   "It horrifies me to think that the lives of dozens of innocent people
. . . would have ended in an instant had the defendant and her
conspirators successfully carried out their terrorist attack," Officer
John Hall told Superior Court Judge Larry Fidler. "As for me, I would
have died, leaving behind my wife and 3-month-old daughter. My other two
children would never have been born."</TE>
<TE>   Olson's tear-choked daughter, Leila Peterson, 15, called her mother
"one of the best mothers anyone could ever want," and said she was raised
"in a home filled with love and compassion."</TE>
<TE>   As she cried and hugged her mother, she told her, "I will always be by
your side no matter what."</TE>
<TE>   Later, outside the courtroom, Myrna Opsahl's son, Jon, said that it
was time for Olson to accept responsibility for her actions in the 1970s
and for justice to be served in his mother's murder.</TE>
<TE>   Her apology in court Friday was "too little, too late," said Opsahl, a
Riverside physician.</TE>
<TE>   Olson pleaded guilty in October to attempting to bomb LAPD cars in an
effort to kill officers. In exchange, prosecutors dropped conspiracy and
bomb possession charges. Because the laws have changed since the crime,
Olson's attorney, Shawn Chapman, believes the state Board of Prison Terms
will order her to serve just over five years of the 20-years-to-life
sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Fidler, who pronounced the sentence, which was based on a plea
agreement between Olson and the district attorney's office, said Friday
that Olson might serve the rest of her life behind bars.</TE>
<TE>Pipe Bombs Under Cars Didn't Explode</TE>
<TE>   In August 1975, two nail-packed pipe bombs were planted beneath police
cars but did not explode. Olson was indicted in 1976, but was not
arrested until June 1999, after officers received a tip following the
broadcast of a TV show about the SLA.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said Olson helped plant the bombs to help avenge the
deaths of six members of the SLA who died during a shootout with LAPD
officers a year earlier. The revolutionary group, which had as its logo a
seven-headed snake, gained notoriety with the kidnapping of newspaper
heiress Patricia Hearst and the assassination of Oakland schools chief
Marcus Foster.</TE>
<TE>   Six relatives and friends of Olson spoke Friday at the hearing before
Fidler.</TE>
<TE>   They gave emotional speeches about Olson's role as a mother and
community volunteer. Olson read to the blind, cooked for the homeless and
taught English to recent immigrants, they told the judge. Chapman
presented a stack of letters vouching for her charity work and church
activities.</TE>
<TE>   Elsie Soliah told Fidler that her daughter never joined the SLA, and
lived an upstanding life.</TE>
<TE>   Olson's husband, emergency room physician Fred Peterson, said he was
proud of his wife of 22 years. "My lovely wife Sara, California is now
entrusted to feed you, clothe you, shelter you and try you," he said.
"But this family of ours will not diminish our love for you, our respect
for you."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Hall, retired LAPD Officer Martin Feinmark testified
for the prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw a large pipe and a bunch of red wires and I froze," Feinmark
said, noting that the vehicle he looked underneath was a community
policing car that was often used to transport children and other
civilians.</TE>
<TE>   Feinmark said that he hoped Olson would learn a lesson while serving
time in prison.</TE>
<TE>   According to a probation report prepared for the sentencing, Olson's
actions in 1975 narrowly avoided creating a tragedy for many people.
"What the defendant did was huge," the report read. "It was too big to
let pass."</TE>
<TE>   The probation report also said that Olson's community involvement
showed that she is no longer a dangerous radical, but rather an "asset to
the political system she once helped attack."</TE>
<TE>   After the hearing, Fidler allowed Olson to meet with her family and
friends in the courtroom for half an hour. Dressed in a blue jail
jumpsuit, Olson's last words to the crowd as she was led away were,
"Thank you for coming. I love you," her attorney said.</TE>
<TE>   Olson was taken to Sacramento on Friday afternoon for the Carmichael
case and is due in court there Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The Carmichael robbery and murder case remained mostly dormant for 27
years. But the arrest and conviction of Olson, along with the persistence
of Jon Opsahl, revived the case.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they've gotten as much time off for good behavior as they're
going to get," he said outside the Los Angeles courtroom Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The Sacramento County district attorney's office said this week that
ballistics and fingerprint evidence uncovered by Los Angeles prosecutors
links the SLA to the robbery and murder.</TE>
<TE>   "The good that came out of this fresh-eyes approach has certainly gone
beyond our county," Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley said
Friday. "And I think that justice on other fronts will hopefully be
secured because of the work we've done down here."</TE>
<TE>   When Los Angeles prosecutors first traveled to Sacramento, Dist. Atty.
Jan Scully was reluctant to file charges. Scully said she wanted to see
how the Los Angeles case went and how Hearst did under cross-examination,
Cooley said. But Scully started a task force in March and filed charges
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley said Friday that Hearst's account of the robbery and murder,
which she detailed in her 1982 book, is corroborated by physical evidence
and witness statements.</TE>
<TE>Patricia Hearst Could Be the Key Witness</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Chapman, however, discounted the credibility of
Hearst, who could become the prosecution's key witness. Chapman said that
federal prosecutors who tried and failed to convict Olson's brother,
Steve Soliah, of the bank robbery in 1976 wrote a memo saying Hearst was
not believable.</TE>
<TE>   Chapman said Olson did not know anything about the bank robbery. "She
knew these people and helped them in small ways," she said. "But she was
never admitted into their inner circle, and never was asked to do
criminal acts."</TE>
<TE>   The Harrises and Bortin are also maintaining their innocence in the
Carmichael case.</TE>
<TE>   Emily Harris and her ex-husband, William Harris, stood side by side
Friday in Sacramento, wearing orange pants and restrained by waist and
ankle chains. Emily Harris, 54, appeared pale and nervous, constantly
rubbing her fingers together. William Harris, 56, was subdued.</TE>
<TE>   Their attorneys said after the brief hearing that they planned to
enter pleas of not guilty by the time their clients return to court Feb.
1 for their bail hearings. The attorneys said their clients are not
flight risks and deserve an affordable bail.</TE>
<TE>   The Harrises were married at the time of the robbery and homicide, and
both served time in prison for crimes related to SLA involvement, then
established middle-class lives.</TE>
<TE>   "Both the Harrises had a sense that this was coming," said attorney
Stuart Hanlon, who represents Emily Harris. "They've lived in their
community since they were released [on] parole in 1983. They did not run.
They had every opportunity to. They are not a flight risk."</TE>
<TE>   The defense attorneys called the charges unfair and made clear that
they expect prosecutors to portray the 1975 robbery and slaying as part
of a reign of terror by the SLA. "We hope the district attorney will try
this case as what it is--a homicide in a bank robbery case and not use
the label 'terrorist,' " said Hanlon. "This is not a time in our history
where one could guarantee someone charged with terrorism a fair trial."</TE>
<TE>   In Portland, Bortin, 53, appeared in court wearing a blue jail outfit
and glasses. He did not enter a plea on the fugitive charge.</TE>
<TE>   "I would like to state for the record that I am not a fugitive and
that I have been a legal resident of the state of Oregon for 12 years,"
said Bortin, who runs a hardwood flooring business and has four children.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Chuck French said the California governor's office
must request Bortin's extradition from Oregon to face the murder charge,
which could take as long as five weeks. The judge ordered Bortin, who is
being held without bail, to return Feb. 22.</TE>

<HD>Enron Chairman Urged Employees to Buy Stock</HD>
<DH>Probe: Comments came just weeks before the company filed the worst
results in its history.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL A. HILTZIK</AU>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay exhorted employees in September to
buy more Enron shares and reassured them that the company's upcoming
quarterly financial report was "looking great" only weeks before the
energy trader disclosed the worst results in its history and a
billion-dollar write-down that destroyed its public credibility.</LD>
<LD>   "Talk up the stock and talk positively about Enron to your family and
friends," Lay told employees via an electronic forum Sept. 26 with Enron
offices around the world. A transcript of the forum was obtained Friday
by The Times. "The company is fundamentally sound. At current stock
prices . . . this seems to be an incredibly cheap stock."</LD>
<LD>   Lay's comments came at a time when Enron employees still would have
been able to sell shares held in their retirement accounts, a window that
closed Oct. 26 when the company imposed a so-called lockdown on such
trades. The lockdown, which ended Nov. 14, resulted in huge losses for
many employee shareholders.</LD>
<TE>   Enron shares, already sharply down from their peak of $90 in August
2000, fell precipitously between the day of the e-mail forum and the
company's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing Dec. 2. They closed Sept. 26 at
$25.15. One month later, they were worth $15.40, and a month after that,
$4.01. The shares closed Friday at 51.5 cents in over-the-counter
trading.</TE>
<TE>   Lay's statements, which came at an internal company meeting, could
expose him to legal liability for misleading investors. His projections
of strong financial results came four days before the end of the third
quarter, which turned out to be its worst ever.</TE>
<TE>   Less than three weeks later, the company disclosed that it would take
$1 billion in charges for underperforming businesses and write down $1.2
billion in shareholder equity to reflect improper accounting.</TE>
<TE>   Lay's lawyer, Earl Silbert, did not return calls for comment.</TE>
<TE>   In the employee forum, Lay also claimed to have bought more Enron
stock himself "over the last couple of months"--an assertion that, though
marginally true, appears at least to have been misleading. An analysis of
Lay's publicly disclosed transactions performed by Thomson
Financial/Lancer Analytics for The Times indicates that he was a net
seller of Enron shares through 2000 and the first half of 2001, earning
about $146 million through options trades.</TE>
<TE>   He appears to be a net purchaser of shares in July and August, but
because the transactions were stock-option exercises, he acquired the
shares at a steep discount--a factor that he did not disclose to the
employees and that sharply limited his financial risk.</TE>
<TE>   Lay made several other statements during the e-mail forum that appear
to conflict with what is otherwise known about conditions at the company
at the time.</TE>
<TE>   He assured employees, for example, that the company's intricate
financing vehicles, which already had come under public criticism, had
been approved by "all of our internal officers" and by auditors at
Andersen, the company's outside auditing firm.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Lay already had met with Enron Vice President Sherron S.
Watkins, who expressed deep reservations about the propriety of those
vehicles. Enron had even commissioned a special investigation into her
concerns by Houston law firm Vinson &amp; Elkins.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Lay insisted that he and his fellow board members were
"convinced by all of our internal officers as well as our external
auditor and counsel that they were legal and totally appropriate."</TE>
<TE>   Lay's comments appear in a company transcript of the Sept. 26
electronic "town meeting," in which employees were invited to post
questions for reply by Lay. The full transcript, which confirms
recollections of the exchange by Clayton Vernon quoted Thursday by The
Times, was made available Friday by Eli Gottesdiener, Vernon's attorney.
Its accuracy was confirmed by an Enron spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Gottesdiener also is suing Enron on behalf of about 15,000 current and
former employees who were prevented from selling Enron shares in their
401(k) retirement plans because of an administrative "lockdown" late last
year. During the lockdown, which extended from mid-October through
mid-November, Enron shares lost two-thirds of their value.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously he has a lot of explaining to do," Gottesdiener said of Lay
on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The workers were likely to have been paying special attention to Lay's
statements because the company had been struggling through an unusually
difficult period.</TE>
<TE>   Accustomed to being glorified on Wall Street as an exemplar of the
"new economy," Enron had faced persistent accusations during the summer
that it was relying on elaborate financial maneuvers to mask failures and
record positive results.</TE>
<TE>   "What will happen in 10 years' time, when all the current MTM tricks
come home to roost?" one employee asks Lay, referring to "mark to market"
strategies aimed at valuing corporate assets at speculative prices. Lay
assured the questioner that the strategy would not affect Enron's income
growth.</TE>
<TE>   Employees also were concerned about the unexpected Aug. 14 resignation
of Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey K. Skilling, who had been regarded as
the architect of its financial success.</TE>
<TE>   Overhanging everything, however, was the steep fall in the stock, in
which workers were heavily invested through their retirement plans.
Executives had been large-scale sellers of Enron from 1999 through 2001,
provoking one employee to ask Lay why top management was not being
encouraged "with muscle" to buy shares.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure you can understand that many of our senior management, as
well as many of our employees, have been badly damaged financially by the
drop in Enron's stock price," he replied.</TE>
<TE>   Lay did spend about $3.6 million to acquire about 168,000 Enron shares
in July and August, according to public filings analyzed by Thomson
Financial. These involved the exercise of options that allowed him to buy
shares at as much as a 43% discount from open-market prices. It is
possible Lay exercised the options with the intent of selling the shares,
but he has not yet reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission if
and when he disposed of them.</TE>
<TE>   Some reports have suggested that he exercised some of the options to
repay a loan from the company.</TE>
<TE>   Any stock purchases by Lay would have been unusual among Enron
officers and directors. Since fall 1992, according to Michael Painchaud
of Market Profile Theorems, a Seattle firm that analyzes trades by
corporate insiders, sales by Enron executives outstripped purchases by a
ratio of 74 to 1. That is in contrast to the situation at most public
companies, at which purchases outnumber sales by an average ratio of 2.27
to 1.</TE>
<TE>   In the nine-year period, there were only 18 stock purchases by Enron
executives, of which four were represented by Lay's purchases in July and
August.</TE>
<TE>   Painchaud said that only 2.5% of U.S. public companies have as
concentrated insider selling as Enron, and that so much of it came in
2001 "was highly unusual even by the unusual standards of this company."
What is clear, Painchaud said, is that sales of stock by Enron insiders
rose dramatically last year, even for a company where so much stock had
previously been sold.</TE>
<TE>   Just as explosive as Lay's stock-buying exhortations may have been his
endorsement of the company's financing techniques, which have drawn
intense scrutiny in Washington because of evidence that they concealed
the company's huge liabilities.</TE>
<TE>   Not only were the transactions approved both "internally and
externally," Lay said, "I or the board also apply the concept of what
appears to be right, using a great deal of experience and common sense."
The result, he said, is "an abundance of safeguards that what is done is
totally appropriate and acceptable."</TE>

<HD>Pentagon Flies High on Drones</HD>
<DH>Future U.S. air campaigns will increasingly rely on unmanned craft
to gather intelligence and attack targets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the Central Intelligence Agency jury-rigged a
remote-controlled spy plane with missiles and then used them to take out
a Taliban target in Afghanistan, it was a first step in revolutionizing
air-to-ground combat.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of a pilot in a cockpit, a computer operator in an
air-conditioned trailer hundreds of miles away used a keyboard and a
joystick to fire the missile.</LD>
<LD>   As the dramatic mission was grabbing headlines, a much more deadly
drone was making its way down a runway at Dryden Flight Research Center
in Edwards, Calif. The taxi tests of the Boeing X-45A culminated a
decades-long effort to build the first stealthy robot planes that can
autonomously launch an attack and return to base.</LD>
<TE>   "Unmanned systems are the future of aerospace," said Jerry Daniels,
president of Boeing Co.'s military aircraft and missile unit.</TE>
<TE>   Developing robot planes has been a quest of military strategists since
biplanes were first used in World War I. They were envisioned as carrying
out missions that were otherwise deemed too dull--or too dangerous. But
they have faced intense resistance from pilots and aviation purists who
believe that no computer can replace the intelligence and quick reaction
of a human being.</TE>
<TE>   Robert C. Ettinger, former F-4 fighter pilot and now the flight test
manager for Northrop Grumman Corp.'s Global Hawk unmanned spy plane, said
other pilots give him a bad time about developing the aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   But Ettinger, who also was the chief test pilot for the F-16, says
that soon enough, unmanned aircraft not only will carry out dangerous
combat missions but will ferry people and cargo across the country.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was a kid, every time we went to a department store, there was
always an operator, and he ran the elevator up and down," said Ettinger,
who has been flying since 1961. "My kids have never seen a manned
elevator, and I think that's the way it's going to be with airplanes.
We're setting the stage for a new kind of aviation."</TE>
<TE>   Boeing formed a separate division in November, with its major
operation in Southern California, devoted entirely to pilotless aircraft.
Its rivals Northrop and Lockheed Martin Corp. also have focused their
development efforts at advanced research laboratories in Southern
California.</TE>
<TE>   The new drones combine the latest in composite plastic technology with
advanced electronics and powerful computers. Some would be able to make
autonomous landings on aircraft carriers, an aviation first. The
ambitious effort includes development of new precision bombs with
powerful warheads that weigh a fraction of current ordnance.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon envisions that eventually one-third of its air fleet will
consist of unmanned planes carrying out the most dangerous elements of
combat--knocking out enemy air defenses such as radar and antiaircraft
missiles so that piloted fighters and bombers can strike targets on the
ground and in the air.</TE>
<TE>   "There's great enthusiasm to accelerate" the programs, said Edward C.
"Pete" Aldridge Jr., undersecretary of defense for acquisition,
technology and logistics. "That is one of the primary considerations in
our fiscal year 2003 to fiscal year 2007 budget. I think you'll see some
positive things."</TE>
<TE>Contractors Compete to Devise Drones</TE>
<TE>   With the Afghanistan conflict putting flying drones in the limelight,
competition to develop so-called unmanned combat aerial vehicles, or
UCAVs, has begun to heat up.</TE>
<TE>   The CIA crudely modified an existing Predator spy drone to carry
antitank Hellfire missiles on its plank-like wings. But future unmanned
combat aircraft are being designed from the start to carry weapons and
make the first penetration of enemy targets.</TE>
<TE>   The X-45A, a radar-evading UCAV that Boeing is developing for the Air
Force, is designed to drop precision bombs. Boeing also is competing with
Northrop to build a UCAV for the Navy that can take off from and land on
an aircraft carrier. Lockheed Martin, the nation's largest defense
contractor, also is developing a UCAV at its legendary Skunk Works
facility in Palmdale.</TE>
<TE>   Lockheed Martin's UCAV, a highly classified program, reportedly is
small enough to be carried under the wing of a piloted jet fighter, which
would ferry it to a target area and release it. The UCAV would be far
more flexible than a cruise missile because it would be able to loiter in
the area and search for a moving target, which it would strike with its
weapons. It would return to its base when the attack were over.</TE>
<TE>   Some defense analysts have reservations about taking pilots out of the
loop.</TE>
<TE>   "The basic problem with the UCAVs is that they require the ability to
respond quickly to a very wide range of unforeseeable circumstances,"
said Loren Thompson, a defense policy analyst with the Lexington
Institute. "That's not the case with unmanned reconnaissance airplanes,
which fly pre-programmed paths that seldom deviate and rarely confront
hostile forces."</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the unmanned planes are smaller than their manned
counterparts, so "there is a still a lot of work to be done for
developing specific weapons that can do as much or more than the weapons
carried by manned fighter jets," said Michel Merluzeau, senior analyst
with Frost &amp; Sullivan, an aerospace research firm in San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   The Air Force, for instance, is working on a so-called small smart
bomb that weighs 250 pounds but has the same explosive effect as that of
the commonly used 2,000-pound bomb.</TE>
<TE>   Even before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the Bush administration
had proposed spending about $155 million in fiscal year 2002 for
continuing research and development of unmanned strike fighters, with the
goal of deploying such aircraft by the end of the decade. UCAV developers
believe the initiative will encounter less resistance in Congress as a
result of the Afghanistan war.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there is a great deal of excitement, and typically you see
the money follow the enthusiasm," said Mike Heinz, general manager for
Boeing's new unmanned systems division.</TE>
<TE>   Heinz believes his unit could generate about $1 billion in revenue by
the end of the decade.</TE>
<TE>   "We really believe that this is one of the systems that will transform
the battlefield," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Congress last year set a goal of making a third of deep-first-strike
aircraft in the U.S. fleet unmanned by 2010. Pentagon officials said
nearly $2 billion would be needed in the next seven years in engineering
development funds to meet that goal.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the
Pentagon's high-tech directorate, which is partly funding many of the
UCAV developments, is considering advancing by two years the selection of
a winner for the Navy UCAV. The Navy hopes to begin engineering and
manufacturing development by 2007.</TE>
<TE>   John Pike, military analyst with GlobalSecurity.org, an aerospace and
defense policy research firm in Alexandria, Va., said development of
unmanned aircraft has been fraught with failures, mainly because the idea
was pushing ahead of available technology.</TE>
<TE>   Although rudimentary systems were produced and used during the Vietnam
War, they relied on close radio contact with the operator and the range
was limited.</TE>
<TE>   In the last few years, however, advances in computing power, satellite
communications and composite materials are converging to make smart
combat robot planes possible.</TE>
<TE>   "It's only in the last couple of years," he said, that aerospace
companies "gained the confidence level to put together a program like the
UCAV," Pike said.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, executives at Boeing and Northrop say they plan to begin the
first flight tests of their prototype UCAV planes within a few months,
setting another aviation first.</TE>
<TE>Turning Heads on the Highway</TE>
<TE>   So far, the unmanned vehicles have proved to be something of a
curiosity.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop's X-47A UCAV, also know as the Pegasus, drew double takes one
night last summer when it was trucked from El Segundo to Mojave via the
San Diego Freeway and California 14.</TE>
<TE>   Engineers decided that the aircraft should make the trip uncovered,
fearing that the composite skin could be damaged by any wrapping. Dozens
of motorists called police and radio stations, mystified by the
alien-looking aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   The plane was built without welding or nuts and bolts. Composites are
bonded to the aircraft frame using a technique similar to skin grafting.</TE>
<TE>   The kite-shaped, tailless aircraft is controlled using two elevons and
two panels on the upper and lower surface of the wings.</TE>
<TE>   After initial flight tests, Northrop will build a larger version, to
be called the X-47B, that will have weapons bays capable of holding 4,000
pounds of munitions, similar to the carrying capacity planned for
Boeing's X-45A.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Spirits 6 Terror Suspects Out of Bosnia</HD>
<DH>Balkans: A Sarajevo court had ordered the release of the men, who

<DL>BERLIN
</DL>
<LD>U.S. forces flew six terrorist suspects out of Bosnia on Friday
after that country's Supreme Court ruled that it had too little evidence
to charge them, the first known instance of the United States casting its
anti-terror net beyond the homeland and Afghan war zone.</LD>
<LD>   The latest U.S. move to detain and prosecute terrorism suspects was
met with fierce protests by Muslims in Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina's
capital, where 300 family members and supporters tried to block the U.S.
military transport vehicles carrying the six men to an unknown
destination.</LD>
<LD>   "Arrangements were made to detain the six when Bosnian authorities
were no longer able to hold them according to their own laws," Navy Capt.
Brian Cullin confirmed from Stuttgart, Germany, the command center for
U.S. forces deployed in Bosnia. "U.S. forces have taken them into
detention. We are not disclosing where that location is, and we are going
to be moving them out very quickly."</LD>
<TE>   The hand-over came amid increasing criticism from human rights
organizations in Europe, which accuse U.S. authorities of trampling civil
liberties in the pursuit of terrorists since the Sept. 11 attacks in the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   A senior military source who spoke on condition that he not be
identified said the men--five Algerians and a Yemeni--would be
transferred by the end of the weekend to the U.S. detention facility at
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Already, 110 suspected Al Qaeda and Taliban
fighters from the Afghan campaign are being held there.</TE>
<TE>   "Bosnia-Herzegovina is still a developing democracy, to put it mildly,
and their rule of law is not quite mature enough to handle this issue,"
the officer said, explaining that Sarajevo had not been provided with all
the evidence gathered by U.S. intelligence against the suspects. "There
was a judgment by U.S. authorities that we would hold back a certain
amount of our intelligence from Bosnian authorities."</TE>
<TE>   The State Department commended the Bosnian government for handing over
the suspects. Spokeswoman Lynn L. Cassel called it "a significant
contribution to the war on terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   The six men, who had been held in Sarajevo since October, were
arrested by Bosnian police on U.S. reports that a credible threat existed
to coalition forces in the Balkan country. The U.S. and British embassies
in the capital were closed for several days because of the alleged
threat, about which no details were given.</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. military statement said Sarajevo and Washington remain
convinced that the six men "still pose a significant threat."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. military has about 9,100 troops in the region, part of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization peacekeeping force in Bosnia, Kosovo
and Macedonia.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Bosnia's Supreme Court ordered the men released, citing a
lack of incriminating evidence. The Helsinki Committee for Human Rights
also had criticized the men's detention without charges, and monitors for
the group in Sarajevo had warned against U.S. forces taking the men out
of the country.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo said in a statement Friday that the
suspects "will be treated humanely and in accordance with international
law," but it gave no further details of their whereabouts or
circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the men worked for Islamic humanitarian groups in Bosnia and
had been in the former Yugoslav republic since the 1992-95 siege by
Serbian and Croatian nationalists against Bosnian Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   All had obtained Bosnian citizenship through marriage or in
recognition of their roles in defending the republic against nationalist
aggression. About 200 Islamic warriors, or moujahedeen, remain in Bosnia,
many of them suspected of having links to Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda
network and other terrorist groups.</TE>
<TE>   Based on U.S. intelligence reports, Bosnian police and NATO-led
peacekeepers arrested more than 20 suspects in Bosnia after Sept. 11. The
other detainees have since been released or deported.</TE>
<TE>   Two international law experts were sharply divided on the wisdom of
the U.S. action Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "This is nothing short of a kidnapping," said M. Cherif Bassiouni, a
professor at DePaul University Law School in Chicago, who was chairman of
the U.N. Security Council commission that investigated war crimes in the
former Yugoslav federation.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a return to the Wild West and is surely likely to affect the
credibility of the U.S. as a country that adheres to the rule of law.
Worse yet, it will give great support to the claims of terrorists that
the U.S. lacks legitimacy in what it does," Bassiouni said.</TE>
<TE>   But Ruth Wedgwood, a Yale law professor, said the U.S. had acted
appropriately, out of "sheer wartime necessity."</TE>
<TE>   She said she believed that five of the six had been stripped of their
Bosnian citizenship after their arrests, which would be legally
significant, and that there had been "no violation of Bosnian
sovereignty," because Bosnian authorities did not resist Friday's action.</TE>
<TE>   "It does not surprise me that the Bosnian government thought [the six]
were too hot for Bosnia to handle," said Wedgwood, who is also a senior
fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. "These guys were casing the
U.S. Embassy."</TE>
<TE>   Mindful of the strains showing between Washington and its European
allies amid the U.S.-led campaign against terror, the chairman of the
House Judiciary Committee, Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.), paid
lightning visits to London and Berlin on Thursday and Friday to persuade
allies of the need for military trials of suspects.</TE>
<TE>   "As the principal author of the USA Patriot Act dealing with homeland
security, let me assure you, as I have assured our German and British
colleagues, that most of the fears that have been raised about these
tribunals are unfounded," Sensenbrenner told journalists here.</TE>
<TE>   But he acknowledged that European justice officials remain concerned
about U.S. plans for trying Sept. 11 suspects in a forum outside those
governed by the Geneva Conventions on the treatment of prisoners of war.</TE>
<TE>   Europeans are also staunchly opposed to capital punishment and have
put Washington on notice that they are bound by a Council of Europe
treaty to refuse extradition of suspects who could face the death
penalty.</TE>
<TE>   "If that happens, the State and Justice departments will really earn
their salaries until that is resolved," Sensenbrenner said of a
hypothetical standoff between the United States and Europe if Bin Laden
should be arrested on this side of the Atlantic.</TE>
<TE>   After his meetings with German Justice Minister Herta Daeubler-Gmelin
and senior police and intelligence officials, Sensenbrenner confirmed
German observations that the hunt is all but over for additional
operatives in the Hamburg terror cell that allegedly plotted the Sept. 11
attacks. Three of the four suicide pilots lived in Germany for years.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not only in Germany that the trail has gone cold, but in a lot
of places," Sensenbrenner said. "We think this is due to the fact that
the command and control in Afghanistan has been pretty much destroyed."</TE>

<HD>River of Lava Kills Scores, Chases Thousands in Congo</HD>
<DH>Disaster: Goma, a city of 350,000 on the Rwandan border, is
devastated. New eruptions feared.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GOMA, Congo
</DL>
<LD>A fast-flowing river of lava more than a mile wide sliced through
this border city Friday, a day after a towering nearby volcano erupted in
a torrent of molten flame. Scores of people were feared dead and about
half a million others were forced to run for their lives.</LD>
<LD>   Goma, a city of more than 350,000, and 14 surrounding villages were
devastated when 11,380-foot Mt. Nyiragongo erupted early Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Some initial estimates put the number of deaths at about 50, but
United Nations officials said it could be days before the final toll is
known.</LD>
<TE>   Late Friday, thousands of refugees lined the streets of Gisenyi,
across the border in Rwanda. Covered with blankets and tattered clothing,
they rested anywhere they could find shelter. Many slept in trees. Others
settled on patches of grass under a starless sky.</TE>
<TE>   At one gas station, masses of refugees huddled close together,
covering every available bit of ground.</TE>
<TE>   Even as they tried to sleep, Mt. Nyiragongo glowed and rumbled in the
background. Violent tremors shook the earth in five-minute intervals, a
reminder that more eruptions could be in store. Babies cowered next to
their mothers, shrieking every time the ground rocked.</TE>
<TE>   A 12-year-old boy named Eddie recounted how he and his six siblings
outran the fast-moving lava.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw my house go up in flames, so we started running," he said. "Now
we are sleeping outside. I don't know where my father or my mother is."</TE>
<TE>   One man said his home and other buildings near the Goma airport were
obliterated. "The lava floated into my home," said Jalume Souleousou.
"There's nothing left. Everything is charcoal, charcoal, charcoal.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll never be able to clean up this mess and organize our life," he
said. "When the lava becomes cold, it's going to be a wall of stone in
Goma."</TE>
<TE>   Entire banana plantations went up in flames in the lava's path. Gas
stations exploded as if to mimic the 2-mile-high volcano, only 11 miles
north of Goma in Virunga National Park.</TE>
<TE>   CARE International said it was mobilizing emergency services and
provisions, such as shelter, blankets, health care and sanitation, to
meet immediate needs.</TE>
<TE>   "Goma is flat, black and burning," said Anne Morris, CARE's director
in Rwanda, after a flight over the city. "At least 50% of housing is
gone, government buildings, schools, clinics, banks--all destroyed.
People are arriving empty-handed and in need of immediate assistance.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the large numbers of refugees in a small area, shelter,
sanitation, health and security issues are of paramount concern," Morris
said.</TE>
<TE>   Nyiragongo is considered one of Africa's most violent volcanoes and
has spewed quick-flowing lava in the past.</TE>
<TE>   In 1977, a lake of molten lava that had existed inside the crater for
more than 80 years suddenly drained through fissures that opened on the
mountain's flanks. The lava flowing down the mountain's flanks raced
along at up to 40 mph, killing about 70 people.</TE>
<TE>   In 1982, the lava lake began refilling in part of the crater and in
1994 it again spurred rapid flows through fissures.</TE>
<TE>   In Seattle, Chris Newhall, a geologist and volcanic expert with the
U.S. Geological Survey, said Friday that he doubts the lava was traveling
as fast this time as some reports indicated.</TE>
<TE>   "It spreads out and goes slower as it moves," Newhall said. But he
added that lava moving along at even 3 mph is terrifying to behold.</TE>
<TE>   Goma is on the shores of Lake Kivu, which has methane and carbon
dioxide in its depths. There is some fear that if the lake were invaded
by lava, the methane could rise to the surface, releasing a suffocating
cloud of gas over the city.</TE>
<TE>   Newhall said a catastrophic release of gas could be caused by a huge
lava flow into the lake, but he said the chances of that happening this
time were unlikely.</TE>
<TE>   Goma's population has fluctuated wildly in the last decade. In 1994, a
million Rwandan Hutu refugees, among them extremist militia members
responsible for the genocide in their country, engulfed the city as they
fled Rwandan Tutsi rebels.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the thousands of refugees who crossed the border into Gisenyi
on Friday made that same journey in the other direction in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Goma is now controlled by the Rwandan-backed Rally for Congolese
Democracy, or RCD, which in a Friday radio broadcast urged all residents
to leave town.</TE>
<TE>   "We are declaring a state of emergency and urge people not to return
to their homes because of the losses," the rebel group's Adolphe Onusumba
said in a broadcast from the devastated city.</TE>
<TE>   Most residents did flee, but some stayed behind to loot stores and
houses. Some refugees carried mattresses on their heads and live chickens
in their arms and whatever belongings they could salvage.</TE>
<TE>   Rwandan Interior Minister Jean de Dieu Ntiruhungwa called on the
international community for assistance.</TE>
<TE>   "The consequences for Rwanda are huge," he said, "but we are obliged
to help."</TE>
<TE>   Britain said Friday that it would give $2.9 million to help the
victims. International Development Secretary Clare Short said $1.4
million had been "immediately allocated" to humanitarian agencies on the
ground in Congo.</TE>

<DL>FRESNO
</DL>
<LD>Travelers at the airport here, on their way to Palm Springs or Las
Vegas, are encountering something new just beyond the security
checkpoint. It looks like a tube of King Kong's lipstick: six feet of
brushed aluminum.</LD>
<LD>   As the traveler approaches the device, a loudspeaker tells him to stop
and "look forward." A camera snaps a series of photographs, which are
instantly compared with pictures of known terrorists in a computer
database. If there's a match, a siren sounds.</LD>
<LD>   Terrorists in Fresno? As government officials have said, they could be
anywhere. Which means they must be sought out everywhere. Airports around
the country are preparing to install the facial-screening system being
tested at the Fresno Yosemite International Airport.</LD>
<TE>   The facial scans are part of a far-reaching shift in the nature and
purpose of American high technology, a change hastened by the Sept. 11
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   For two decades, high tech moved inexorably toward greater convenience
and personal empowerment. Hand-held organizers, satellite phones and
other digital devices embodied this ideal. They made it possible to get
stock updates by cell phone and to shop for groceries via Palm Pilot. The
trend was toward a decentralized system of ever-smaller, cheaper and more
powerful gadgets.</TE>
<TE>   These days, fear of terror is shifting the emphasis from wired
convenience to physical security, from decentralized technology meant to
make life easier to centralized surveillance meant to make America safer.</TE>
<TE>   Across the tech world, money and creative energy are flowing to
emerging technologies of vigilance, ranging from disposable surveillance
cameras to systems that read brain waves for signs of malevolent intent.</TE>
<TE>   Increasingly, the trend is to use technology to search and identify,
to mark boundaries and deny access. At airports and office buildings, in
supermarkets and stadiums, on computer networks and city streets, it will
observe and control--for our own safety.</TE>
<TE>   The elements of this new order go beyond software and servers.
Anti-terrorist legislation enacted by Congress after Sept. 11 expands the
FBI's authority to eavesdrop and search e-mail and phone records. In
California, Gov. Gray Davis is seeking similar powers.</TE>
<TE>   The new technologies will make such searches faster and more
extensive. They also will reduce the typical citizen's zone of privacy
and clash with deep-rooted American values.</TE>
<TE>   "Security and privacy are always in a balance, but since the attacks
the equation has changed," said Jonathan Zittrain, a professor at Harvard
Law School and an expert on information privacy.</TE>
<TE>   As in other national crises, from the Great Depression to Pearl
Harbor, political, legal and technological change is outpacing discussion
of its consequences.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't want to have a committee meeting when your house is on
fire," Zittrain said.</TE>
<TE>   In the forefront of this shift are two of the most successful and
influential chief executives in Silicon Valley: Larry Ellison of Oracle
Corp., the second-largest software company, and Scott McNealy of Sun
Microsystems Inc., a maker of powerful computers that operate networks.</TE>
<TE>   "Absolute anonymity breeds absolute irresponsibility," McNealy
declared in October. "If you get on a plane, I want to know who you are.
If you rent a crop-duster, I want to know who you are."</TE>
<TE>   Both men are calling for a high-tech national identification card.
Oracel and Sun could profit from the development of such an ID, which
would be electronically linked to government databases. Still, the
executives' stance is remarkable coming from an industry that
traditionally has viewed government oversight with disdain.</TE>
<TE>   Their view also reflects changing public opinion. Polls show that
Americans, who used to associate a national identity card with
totalitarianism, now strongly favor the idea.</TE>
<TE>   "We as a people are willing to trade a little less privacy for a
little more security," said Stewart Baker, former general counsel to the
National Security Agency, the largest U.S. spy agency. "If using more
intrusive technology is the only way to prevent horrible crimes, chances
are that we'll decide to use the technology, then adjust our sense of
what is private and what is not."</TE>
<TE>Scanning the Faces in the Crowd</TE>
<TE>   The Sept. 11 attacks may have lent impetus to the creation of a
national identity state, but the groundwork was laid long ago. Video
surveillance is so common as to have faded into the fabric of everyday
life.</TE>
<TE>   More than 2 million cameras in this country continuously scan street
corners and hotel lobbies, grocery stores and schools, subway trains and
sports stadiums. Every day, they capture billions of images.</TE>
<TE>   Those images are used mainly to identify criminals after the fact. The
next generation of watching technologies is designed to help police
intervene in real time.</TE>
<TE>   An embryonic version of this idea is being tested by the Bay Area
Rapid Transit commuter-rail system.</TE>
<TE>   Like most public transit agencies, BART came under pressure to
increase security after Sept. 11. Each of the 39 BART stations is getting
at least 30 high-resolution color cameras that can tilt and pan in a
complete circle. They can zoom in on a truck at the end of a large
parking lot or the brand logo on a suspect's shirt pocket. The images
will be transmitted instantly via high-speed fiber-optic cable to BART
police headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, dispatchers get calls of crimes in progress, but send in the
patrolman blind," because they can't see and describe the action
themselves, said John Davenport, an undercover officer and one of the
system's designers.</TE>
<TE>   With the new system, dispatchers can train a camera on a mugger in the
act, direct officers to the scene with precision and offer detailed
descriptions of the suspect.</TE>
<TE>   Davenport said the system helped thwart 15 assaults, robberies and
other crimes within a few weeks at the station near Oakland's sports
coliseum, the first to get the new cameras.</TE>
<TE>   BART is spending $2 million on its setup, but the price of a basic
surveillance system--a camera, wireless transmitter and connections to a
TV screen--is less than $100. Soon, cameras will be cheap enough to post
along miles of remote passages, like the BART tube under San Francisco
Bay, or on the back of every seat on every commercial airliner.</TE>
<TE>   "George Orwell underestimated our enthusiasm for surveillance," said
Baker, the former NSA counsel. "He correctly predicted that we'd have
cameras everywhere. What he failed to imagine is that we'd want them so
bad we'd pay for them."</TE>
<TE>Civil Libertarians Fear 'False Positives'</TE>
<TE>   Pictures, unlike words, numbers or even fingerprints, long were
considered too subtle and complex to search by computer. Human eyes, it
seemed, were needed to tell a mugger from a mother, a terrorist from a
tourist.</TE>
<TE>   The facial-recognition system being tested at the Fresno airport
represents an important step toward making such judgments instantly and
reliably by computer. Airports in Boston, Dallas and Providence, R.I.,
have begun to install the technology, and officials at others say they
plan to.</TE>
<TE>   A facial-recognition system breaks down the human face into 26 points
of bone structure. It then converts these points to numbers and compares
them with head shots in a databank.</TE>
<TE>   The Fresno system was installed in October by Pelco Inc., the world's
largest maker of video security systems, whose headquarters are about a
mile from the airport.</TE>
<TE>   About 1,800 travelers a day go through the airport's single security
checkpoint. Even with screeners monitoring the process, the
facial-scanning system fails to get a good photograph about 20% of the
time: The traveler looked down or to the side or simply didn't stop.</TE>
<TE>   Of those whose faces have been successfully "captured," the computer
has sounded an alarm in one case out of 750. When that happens, security
guards compare the traveler's face with the matching image found by the
computer. Usually, they are determined not to be the same.</TE>
<TE>   But in one instance, involving a middle-aged, bearded man with a
Middle Eastern appearance, guards agreed with the computer. The man's
bags were pulled from the plane and searched. The FBI was called in. It
took the man several hours to convince authorities that he was not a
terrorist. By then, he had missed the last flight to his destination.</TE>
<TE>   Pelco paid for his dinner and hotel room and took him back to the
airport in the morning.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a test," said Pelco Vice President Ron Cadle. "We owed it to
him. But if this was a hard-core installation, forget it. We're not
running the Hotel Pelco here."</TE>
<TE>   Critics of facial recognition say a nationwide system would result in
hundreds, if not thousands, of "false positives" each day.</TE>
<TE>   A facial-recognition system went into operation last summer in the
night-life district of Tampa, Fla., with 36 cameras searching a 16-block
area for any of 300 felons sought by police.</TE>
<TE>   The American Civil Liberties Union, using the Florida open-records
law, recently obtained police records on the system. The ACLU discovered
that during five weeks of operation, the system did not detect a single
criminal suspect among the faces it scanned but did regularly make false
matches.</TE>
<TE>   The ACLU concluded that the system was intrusive from a civil
liberties standpoint and useless for law enforcement. Tampa police
quietly shut the system down in August, later blaming software bugs and
other problems.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the ACLU's concerns, authorities are moving forward with an
expanded version of the system. The database is being enlarged with
photographs of 45,000 convicted and accused criminals, including rapists,
murderers, robbers and burglars and a few sexual predators under court
supervision.</TE>
<TE>   An unexplored aspect of facial profiling is what will happen to the
millions of images captured by the cameras. The Fresno system
automatically erases pictures that don't match any in its database. But
the computer could just as easily store them.</TE>
<TE>   Already, other databanks are being expanded beyond criminals and
terrorists. In Tampa, dozens of runaways are being added. Ernie Allen,
president of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children,
wants facial-screening systems to include pictures of the 2,000 children
his organization is looking for. "It could be of enormous benefit," he
said.</TE>
<TE>Has Privacy Lost Its Constituency?</TE>
<TE>   Embedded deep in the American soul is the importance of privacy. It's
enshrined in the Fourth Amendment, which forbids "unreasonable searches
and seizures," and in that most American of art forms, the western, which
often centers on characters who want to be left alone in the wilderness.
The image of an authority figure demanding "your papers, please" conjures
up 1930s Germany more than the United States in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Yet reaction to the specter of national ID cards, facial scans and
other forms of watching has been surprisingly muted.</TE>
<TE>   Some observers say the unpredictable nature of terrorism demands a
change in attitudes.</TE>
<TE>   "We need security before we can squabble about where to draw the
line," said Adam Keiper, president of the Center for the Study of
Technology and Society, a Washington think tank.</TE>
<TE>   Others wonder if privacy has simply lost its constituency.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a sense that privacy is a luxury we can no longer afford,"
said Jeff Ubois, co-founder of Omnivia Policy Systems, a San Francisco
software company that has struggled to find customers for
privacy-enhancing e-mail technology.</TE>
<TE>   "We may be heading for a time," he said, "when the only thing about us
that won't be tracked in government files will be our video rental
records"--shielded under the Video Privacy Protection Act of 1988--"and
our guns."</TE>
<TE>   Technology is moving America toward the transparent society he
fears--a world without anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to scanning faces, software can extract other information
from the reams of video recorded every day. Artificial-intelligence
systems convert pictures and sound into computer files. The software can
translate speech into text in at least eight languages, with more in
development. Voiceprints, the vocal equivalent of fingerprints, can be
recorded in any tongue.</TE>
<TE>   The technology was designed for media companies such as CNN that need
an efficient way to organize and search their video archives. But it is
well-suited to surveillance too.</TE>
<TE>   The images, text and voiceprints retrieved from video can be stored
like credit card numbers or addresses. Authorities could search such a
database to see if the face or voice of a terrorist had been recorded by
a security camera somewhere. As video surveillance becomes more
pervasive, such databases probably will become common.</TE>
<TE>   New software developed by Virage Inc. of San Mateo, Calif., seeks to
automate one of the most arduous aspects of video security: staring at
monitors. The software is designed to analyze video footage and activate
an alert if it detects something it has been programmed to recognize as
suspicious: a particular face, location, word or phrase.</TE>
<TE>   "Guards get tired. Machines don't," said technology analyst Paul
Saffo.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. intelligence agencies have used such software to evaluate the
footage shot by unmanned surveillance planes soaring over the Afghan
highlands, in which hours of empty landscapes might be punctuated by a
fleeting glimpse of an Al Qaeda enclave.</TE>
<TE>   This technology, combined with others, could be used to link widely
scattered security systems. If a terrorist avoided detection at an
airport, cameras at a bus station or toll plaza might spot him. Joseph
Atick, chief executive of Visionics, a maker of software for
facial-recognition systems, has spoken--with enthusiasm--of a "national
shield" linking every camera in the country.</TE>
<TE>Databases Take on Added Importance</TE>
<TE>   The emerging identity state relies not only on images but on billions
of bits of personal, financial and legal information--the data stream of
everyday life. Tools are being developed to mine and sift this data for
signs of criminal intent.</TE>
<TE>   For years, officials have been able to check thousands of online
databases that hold police files and public records. In the post-Sept. 11
world, those archives are growing dramatically, partly because of the
sweeping anti-terrorism laws pushed through Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Spy agencies now can demand access to Internet and phone records
without a subpoena. Surveillance software can capture a person's every
keystroke, including passwords that unlock encrypted files.</TE>
<TE>   Artificial intelligence software in development is designed to look
not just for obvious signs of suspicious activity, such as large bank
withdrawals but for gaps or subtle peculiarities in the data. It might
call attention to someone who has credit cards but no Social Security
number.</TE>
<TE>   By its very nature, such technology undermines traditional checks and
balances.</TE>
<TE>   "We're collecting data on everyone on the assumption that anyone may
be the next terrorist," said Deirdre Mulligan, director of the Law and
Technology Clinic at UC Berkeley. "This subverts our traditional notion
of the ability of the government to survey its citizens" only if there is
probable cause to suspect criminal conduct.</TE>
<TE>   Another concern is that authorities have a natural inclination to
believe what their computers collect, said Bruce Schneier, a computer
security expert.</TE>
<TE>   "You end up with a society in which the database is more important
than reality," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The possibility that innocents will come under suspicion is more than
theoretical. Ask Mark Deuitch.</TE>
<TE>   On the Saturday after the terrorist attacks, the investment banker
looked out his window and saw six FBI agents climbing from sport-utility
vehicles outside his home in Boone, N.C., a mountain resort area. Two
agents guarded his wife. The others interrogated Deuitch for two hours.</TE>
<TE>   They came carrying a dossier gleaned from online repositories of motor
vehicle, airline and credit information.</TE>
<TE>   Judged solely on this data, Deuitch seemed a threat. He conducts
business in the Middle East, the former Yugoslavia and other zones of
conflict. He was scheduled to fly on Sept. 11 using a ticket bought by a
Saudi client with a name similar to that of hijacker Mohamed Atta. And
Deuitch once rented a house in Pompano Beach, Fla., near the residence of
some of the hijackers.</TE>
<TE>   Deuitch cooperated fully--relieved, he said, that the FBI was so
aggressively pursuing terrorists. The agents left satisfied that he was
clean.</TE>
<TE>   But Deuitch's name was not immediately dropped from the bureau's list
of people to question. That list was leaked to the media and soon
circulated on the Internet--with Deuitch's name still on it.</TE>
<TE>   "I was being put at risk--myself, my family, my business reputation,"
Deuitch said. "I do a lot of very sensitive work, and background checks
are pretty much required. Potential clients don't always come back and
ask for clarification if there is something unusual on a record. It
taints me."</TE>
<TE>Using the Brain as a Lie Detector</TE>
<TE>   "Brain fingerprinting" sounds like something out of science fiction,
but some consider it a logical next step in security. In recent years,
the FBI, CIA, Secret Service and other agencies have contacted
neuroscientist Larry Farwell, who invented the technique.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the agencies concluded that brain fingerprinting, though
apparently feasible, had limited application, a Government Accounting
Office study concluded. Sept. 11 has stimulated a fresh round of
interest.</TE>
<TE>   Farwell, chairman and chief scientist of Brain Fingerprinting
Laboratories Inc. in Fairfield, Iowa, has developed what he says is a
superior lie detector: a sensor-equipped headband that measures brain
waves.</TE>
<TE>   While wearing the headband, a subject is shown material that includes
"irrelevants" and "probes." Information in the first category establishes
a baseline of response; in the second category are things known only to
the examiner and the subject. With a murder suspect, it might be a
picture of the crime scene. With an Al Qaeda member, it might be one of
the group's code words.</TE>
<TE>   In either case, recognition would cause a spike in the brain waves.
The guilty would be unmasked--in theory, at least. Though Farwell claims
100% accuracy in dozens of tests, brain fingerprinting hasn't undergone
rigorous independent evaluation.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Kirsch, who founded the search tool InfoSeek, one of the most
successful of the early Internet technologies, is a prominent proponent
of brain fingerprinting. He goes even further than Farwell, arguing that
it should be used not only to question criminal suspects but to screen
the public at large.</TE>
<TE>   Voluntarily, of course.</TE>
<TE>   "America's all about choice," Kirsch said. "If you have your skull
scanned and show you're not a terrorist, you get to go through the
fast-pass line."</TE>
<TE>   Assuming the technology is proved reliable, the choice might not be a
choice forever.</TE>
<TE>   "Once brain scanning becomes commonplace," Kirsch said, "people will
want to know: 'Is this flight 100% screened or not?' "</TE>
<TE>   The remark reflects a sense of inevitability that colors debate over
the technologies of vigilance. With the high-tech economy suffering its
worst recession in decades, companies are flocking to the security
business.</TE>
<TE>   They know that money will follow fear. A few skeptics worry that as
the identity society becomes an important source of jobs and profits, it
will begin to seem necessary, then normal, and finally invisible.</TE>
<TE>   Such fears were sharply expressed in an essay in the influential
Internet newsletter Nettime. How long will it be, the anonymous writer
wondered, before "protester" becomes synonymous with "terrorist"?</TE>
<TE>   There will be, he warned, "no piece of earth exempted from subjection
to the identity apparatus."</TE>

<HD>Israeli Forces Knocking at Arafat's Gate</HD>
<DH>West Bank: Army takes up positions across Ramallah and blows up
radio station after Thursday's deadly attack by a Palestinian militant.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>Boys gagging on tear gas lay sprawled in Yasser Arafat's driveway
Friday. Behind the closed black gate of his compound, Arafat's guards
sulked. About 200 feet away, Israeli soldiers in tanks and armored
carriers seized positions, closer to Arafat than ever.</LD>
<LD>   Retaliating for a deadly terrorist attack the night before, Israeli
forces Friday tightened their siege on the Palestinian Authority
president by a few more notches, closing in on his headquarters and
reoccupying large chunks of this most important of Palestinian cities.
And early today, Israeli forces blew up the Ramallah broadcasting offices
of the Voice of Palestine radio station.</LD>
<LD>   The reprisals came after six Israelis were killed late Thursday by a
Palestinian gunman who opened fire wildly on a bat mitzvah celebration in
the northern Israeli city of Hadera. The assailant, from a militia
affiliated with Arafat's Fatah movement, also was killed.</LD>
<TE>   On Friday, Israeli fighter jets leveled a Palestinian government
complex, including a prison, in the West Bank town of Tulkarm. One
policeman was killed and about 40 other people were wounded, among them
several prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   But it was in Ramallah that Israel attempted to drive home the point
that it holds Arafat responsible for the Hadera attack and the killings
of two Jewish settlers and an Israeli soldier by Palestinian gunmen
earlier in the week.</TE>
<TE>   "Israel reserves the right of self-defense," Defense Minister Binyamin
Ben-Eliezer said Friday, a day of consultations with military chiefs to
weigh further action. "We will retaliate in every way and when we find it
appropriate."</TE>
<TE>   In a show of force, Israeli armor and paratroopers thrust into this
city and took up positions near the homes of several key Palestinian
leaders. They also seized a hill above Arafat's headquarters. Israeli
forces previously had moved into some of the same areas, but on Friday
they came closer than before.</TE>
<TE>   About 2:30 this morning, about 20 tanks and armored vehicles
surrounded the five-story Voice of Palestine building, witnesses said.
Soldiers removed documents, then lay charges on the third floor, where
the main news offices were located. The explosion set the building on
fire and destroyed much of the interior.</TE>
<TE>   When the soldiers approached, the building was empty except for
guards, who fled. Israel has accused Voice of Palestine of airing
inflammatory and anti-Israeli broadcasts. Palestinians counter that
Israel is trying to silence them. The station resumed broadcasting around
dawn, apparently using an alternative site.</TE>
<TE>   An Israeli army spokeswoman early today would only confirm "army
activity" in the radio station's vicinity.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat has been under virtual house arrest in Ramallah for the last
six weeks, confined largely to his stone-and-concrete compound, since a
spate of deadly attacks in early December.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian men and boys rushed to the street in front of Arafat's
compound after Friday noontime prayers. They hurled stones at the tanks
and burned tires, sending black acrid smoke into the sky. Israeli forces
periodically fired stun grenades, punctuating the air with loud thuds,
and rounds of tear gas that sent the youths fleeing back to the shelter
of Arafat's driveway.</TE>
<TE>   Four or five people were reported injured, mostly by rubber-coated
steel bullets.</TE>
<TE>   The clashes were mild by recent standards. But the fact that they
erupted on Arafat's doorstep--something not seen in the last 15 1/2
months of conflict--was further sign of the deterioration of the aging
leader's grasp on power and the intensity with which Israeli Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon wants to be rid of him.</TE>
<TE>   Many Palestinians believe that Sharon wants to reoccupy territory that
the Palestinian Authority gained control over in the landmark Oslo peace
accords more than eight years ago. And it is no secret that several of
the prime minister's top generals are advocating just that.</TE>
<TE>   Maj. Gen. Moshe Yaalon, the deputy chief of staff and leading
contender to become the army's supreme commander, said wider deployment
of Israeli troops is essential to ending Palestinian attacks. In an
interview published in an internal military publication, Yaalon said
seizing back the territories that Israel vacated and handed over to the
Palestinians may become necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "It could be that we will have to return to the territories that we
withdrew from in the Oslo accords," Yaalon told the Intelligence Corps
newsletter.</TE>
<TE>   In a marathon Cabinet session that began Wednesday at midnight,
military commanders argued for permission to carry out a full-scale,
open-ended invasion and seizure of Palestinian territories, according to
sources familiar with the discussion. It was a hotly argued debate, the
sources said, and the idea was ultimately shelved.</TE>
<TE>   The plan, dismissed by most analysts as impractical, may now be
revisited, especially as Sharon's options seem ever more limited. He has
been unable to stop the violence and make Israelis feel safe again--the
promise that secured him a landslide electoral victory nearly a year ago.
Arafat has been unable or unwilling to end Palestinian attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon's aides have stated that it is not the prime minister's
intention to harm Arafat. And deporting or expelling Arafat would in no
way guarantee the rise of a more malleable Palestinian leadership. Some
here fear a free-for-all among Palestinian gangs, militias and security
forces in the power vacuum that would ensue.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli government has declared Arafat "irrelevant," and his
credibility has been substantially eroded among even his erstwhile
foreign supporters. Under enormous international pressure, he ordered a
halt to Palestinian attacks Dec. 16, and violence dropped off
significantly. But the militant Islamic movement Hamas claimed that it
killed four soldiers near the Gaza Strip last week.</TE>
<TE>   Then, after the killing Monday of its leader in an explosion widely
attributed to Israel, the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, a militant offshoot of
the Fatah movement, ended its observance of the truce. The militia has
claimed responsibility for all slayings of Jews by militants this week.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian officials blame Israel and its policies undermining Arafat
for the erosion in his status and ability to govern.</TE>
<TE>   "All Palestinians are like in a prison--the Palestinian Authority, the
people, the president," Marwan Barghouti, Fatah leader for the West Bank
and one of Arafat's key lieutenants, said Friday as he stood outside
Arafat's compound and watched the clashes.</TE>
<TE>   "It is very difficult and very frustrating" for Arafat, he
acknowledged.</TE>
<TE>   "But I've said it a thousand times: Israelis will not achieve security
this way. It's impossible," Barghouti said, adding that only with an end
to military occupation and with political concessions can Palestinians
feel sufficiently invested in the process to make peace. "I hope there
will be moves to stop this disaster, because it will be a disaster for
the Palestinians and a disaster for the Israelis too."</TE>

<HD>Dance of Death Continues for Israelis, Arabs</HD>
<DH>Violence: The bullets that snuffed out joy and lives at a girl's
birthday party are but the latest outrage in a seemingly unbreakable
cycle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HADERA, Israel
</DL>
<LD>The camera follows the beaming 12-year-old in the glittering gown
as she dances with friends to fast-paced music. It stays on her as she
turns, puzzled, when the crack of gunfire rings out.</LD>
<LD>   For a moment, the band plays on, the sound of shots mingling with the
music. Then come screams as the elegantly dressed revelers realize that
they are under attack. They dive for cover. The footage stops.</LD>
<LD>   The video was shown on Israeli television Friday night, capturing the
moment that Nina Kardashova's bat mitzvah, a joyous Jewish coming-of-age
celebration, became the latest outrage in the seemingly unbreakable cycle
of Israeli-Palestinian violence.</LD>
<TE>   The dance and dinner at the Palace of David banquet hall in this
northern Israeli city began as a perfect evening, Nina told the newspaper
Maariv. It ended in chaos and terror and the shattering of her family.</TE>
<TE>   There are images that Nina, who emigrated with her family from Russia
several years ago, took away from the evening that the camera didn't
capture: She saw a man "dressed in a uniform" and carrying a weapon walk
past one of her uncles and open fire.</TE>
<TE>   "My best friend, Liran Hasson, made me lie down and said to me: 'Let's
lie here quietly. We must not die. You must not die at your bat mitzvah
celebration. Let's stay alive,' " Nina said.</TE>
<TE>   She watched as her grandmother "took a chair and threw it" at Abed
Hassounah, the 26-year-old gunman, and as her mother "beat his head into
the floor and said to him, 'You ruined the party.' "</TE>
<TE>   After family members rushed her out a back door, Nina learned that her
grandfather, Edward Bakshayev, 48, and a cousin, Anatoli Bakshayev, 63,
were among the six people killed before the gunman was beaten and then
shot to death.</TE>
<TE>   On the videotape is a scene of Nina's grandfather giving her a pair of
diamond earrings for her birthday.</TE>
<TE>   The Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, a militia affiliated with Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat's mainstream Fatah movement, claimed
responsibility for the attack. The group said it was to avenge the death
of a militia commander on Monday in what Palestinians say was an Israeli
assassination.</TE>
<TE>   The revelers at Nina's party exacted their revenge on the spot.</TE>
<TE>   After Hassounah's M-16 rifle jammed, they jumped him as he fumbled
with the weapon. The crowd knocked him to the ground, where they kicked
and beat him severely before dragging him out onto the sidewalk.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli police officers arriving on the scene said they saw Hassounah
reach for what they feared were explosives strapped to his body. A
policeman and an Arab serving in Israel's Civil Guard shot Hassounah in
the head, killing him. Police later said Hassounah had a grenade clipped
to his belt but no other explosives.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw the whole thing from beginning to end," said Rahel Rehamim, a
25-year-old mother of three who was visiting a sister across the street
from the banquet hall. "I saw the terrorist running with his gun. I saw
the guard get shot. I saw the people dragging the terrorist out. I saw
them pounding him, kicking him, hitting him with purses."</TE>
<TE>   She saw people do "some shocking things" to Hassounah, Rehamim said.
"But I enjoyed every single groan of pain and also when I heard the gun
clip being emptied into him. They paid him back. In front of me, I kept
seeing the injured people and the survivors screaming, 'Help me! Help
me!' " she said. As the mob beat him, "I felt a sense of relief, a sense
of victory."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Rehamim went to Hille Yaffe hospital, where eight of the 38
people injured were still being treated. She wanted to see the people she
had tried to help before paramedics arrived.</TE>
<TE>   "I just had to see them," she said. "I had to see what happened to
them."</TE>
<TE>   She stood outside the room of Vladimir Yusuposove, 51, a guest at the
party and one of those who had attacked the gunman. Yusuposove, a truck
driver, said he was sitting at a table with friends when he realized that
they were being shot at. He said he lunged at the gunman, knocking him to
the ground.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew it was either him or me, that either I kill him or he will
kill everybody," Yusuposove said. In the chaos that followed, someone cut
Yusuposove's neck with a knife.</TE>
<TE>   Like most of the 180 guests, Yusuposove is an immigrant from the
Russian republic of Dagestan. The sister of one victim said that most
arrived in Israel within the last decade, looking for a place "where we
can live as Jews."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, many of the uninjured party-goers spent the day at funerals
and at the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   The plate-glass windows of the banquet hall were plastered with
placards and a death notice for the slain guard, Avi Yazdi, who had been
married in the same hall just a few months earlier.</TE>
<TE>   At the banquet hall, passersby stopped to peer through the locked
glass doors at the darkened, cluttered room inside. One man raised an
Israeli flag on a pole outside. Another set up a table and opened a
prayer book, inviting others to join him in praying for the dead.
Bouquets of flowers were placed next to the building, along with dozens
of candles.</TE>
<TE>   People in the small but angry crowd expressed hope that the government
would take some decisive action and put an end to the bloody fighting
that has raged since September 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to separate Jews and Arabs," said Golan Badash, 27. "I live
near Netanya, and I find myself walking fast around cars, because I
remember that there are car bombs. You look at people differently. You
look at people with suspicion."</TE>
<TE>   A few blocks away, at the Gan Zohar banquet hall, another Jewish
ritual went on as scheduled Friday morning. Members of the Richter family
were celebrating the circumcision of their week-old son Alon, with about
70 friends and relatives.</TE>
<TE>   A guard outside said arriving guests questioned him closely.</TE>
<TE>   "They wanted to know about security, about whether I have a gun. Of
course I do," he said. The guard, who also volunteers with the Hadera
Police Department, had helped in the rescue work at the Palace of David
the night before.</TE>
<TE>   He had trouble, he said, with this celebration going on Friday. "You
must live," he said. "But I am not celebrating right now. I am just doing
my job. I can't forget the victims, how they looked lying there on the
floor."</TE>

<HD>Tensions Easing in Kashmir Dispute</HD>
<DH>South Asia: Powell leaves New Delhi, buoyed by India and Pakistan's
conciliatory messages and a decrease in clashes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL WATSON</AU>
<AU>TYLER MARSHALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NEW DELHI
</DL>
<LD>With tensions easing slightly between India and Pakistan, Secretary
of State Colin L. Powell said Friday that the two nuclear powers appear
to be heading toward a peaceful resolution of their dangerous military
standoff over Kashmir.</LD>
<LD>   After talks here with Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee,
Powell said he was leaving India "very encouraged that we can find a
solution to this troubling situation."</LD>
<LD>   India accuses Pakistan-based Kashmir separatists of launching a brazen
raid on its Parliament on Dec. 13 that killed 14 people, including the
five gunmen. Powell said Friday that he supports India's demand for
further action from Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf against
terrorism.</LD>
<TE>   "I think we are on a path that could lead to the restoration of
dialogue, and the kind of confidence-building activity that the [Indian]
prime minister spoke of," Powell told reporters. "But it will take
further action before we can really start walking down that path more
aggressively."</TE>
<TE>   He called for patience and asked both sides "to remain committed to
the diplomatic track" as hundreds of thousands of soldiers face off on
the front lines.</TE>
<TE>   "And we also have to be mindful that there are probably people out
there who might want to create another incident to cause a
conflagration," Powell warned. "We have to be sensitive to that."</TE>
<TE>   A bomb blast that killed at least one person and injured about 10
others Thursday night in Jammu, the winter capital of the disputed Indian
state of Jammu and Kashmir, was a terrorist attack, Indian Foreign
Minister Jaswant Singh said. But India's official response to it was
muted, and its military says that clashes with Pakistani troops are
decreasing along the 1972 cease-fire line known as the Line of Control,
which divides the Himalayan region between India and Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   In Islamabad, the Pakistani capital, Musharraf delivered a similarly
conciliatory message, saying he believes that a conflagration with India
can be avoided. "I'm confident there won't be war," he told a conference
of religious leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Although he included some harsh rhetoric in his speech, declaring that
his nation has the ability to counter any Indian military offensive and
launch its own counteroffensive in Kashmir, those comments were viewed
more as necessary posturing to head off accusations of weakness from
hard-liners at home than an attempt to escalate the crisis.</TE>
<TE>   In Pakistan, there is a growing feeling that a week-old government
crackdown against several Islamic militant groups has helped diminish any
immediate prospect of an armed conflict. The crackdown followed a major
speech by Musharraf a week ago in which the Pakistani leader condemned
extremist groups, accusing them of endangering the country's stability
and damaging its international reputation.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani Interior Ministry officials claim that more than 2,000
people suspected of ties to the groups have been detained in a nationwide
police roundup. Javed Iqbal Cheema, a senior Interior Ministry official
involved in coordinating the massive sweep, said this week that about
5,000 people were being targeted in the action, which could last several
months.</TE>
<TE>   But India has repeatedly said it won't start talking peace with
Pakistan until Islamabad stops the infiltration of separatist fighters
across the Line of Control. New Delhi also insists that Pakistan must
hand over 20 suspected terrorists and criminals for trial in India.</TE>
<TE>   "We will know when things stop happening over the Line of Control when
things stop happening over the Line of Control," Powell said. But the
secretary of State said India's prime minister had welcomed "some
important words said and important actions taken" by Musharraf.</TE>
<TE>   "And if we continue to see progress in that regard, then I expect we
will see steps taken on the part of the Indian government," Powell added.</TE>
<TE>   India's wanted list of 20 men, which includes 14 Indian citizens
accused of bombings and other terrorist attacks, "is an issue of
continuing discussion between India and the Pakistani government," Powell
said.</TE>
<TE>   India has provided additional details on the suspects to Pakistan and
given a copy of the information to the U.S. delegation, Powell added.
Musharraf said last Saturday that he will never extradite Pakistani
citizens to India but didn't rule out sending Indian nationals.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope that President Musharraf, as he has said in the past, will
examine all that information and do what is the appropriate thing to do
in the case of each one of those 20 individuals," Powell said.</TE>
<TE>   Indian intelligence sources claim that several of the men have been
living under Pakistani government protection in Karachi, the country's
main commercial center. Singh, the Indian foreign minister, said
Pakistani authorities shouldn't have any difficulty finding them.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not as if they are hiding in some cave in Karachi," Singh added,
bringing a restrained smile to Powell's face. "There are, alas, no caves
in Karachi. And so they are in fact visible to the Pakistani
establishment."</TE>
<TE>   Restoring confidence between India and Pakistan is essential before
direct negotiations can begin, Singh said. That requires action from
Musharraf, such as extraditing the 20 men for trial in India, the foreign
minister added.</TE>
<TE>   "Once confidence is restored between the two countries, everything
else will fall in place," Singh said.</TE>
<TE>   Sounding relatively conciliatory, Singh said he was "very hopeful that
there will be distinct movement toward a situation similar to what
existed before Dec. 13."</TE>
<TE>   Powell said he discussed several ideas with Vajpayee and other Indian
officials that could ease tensions further. They included toning down the
rhetoric from both sides.</TE>
<TE>   "But these were just suggestions of ways we could move forward,
without trying to get any agreement on them at this time, because
agreement will come in due course as confidence is restored," Powell said
before heading to Nepal.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we're off to a pretty good start over the last week," he
said.</TE>

<HD>Crackdown Not a Bow to the West, Musharraf Tells Clerics</HD>
<DH>Asia: Pakistani leader says he wants religion and progress to
coexist.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TYLER MARSHALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>Six days after announcing a major crackdown against militant
Islamic extremist groups in the country, Pakistani President Pervez
Musharraf tried to reassure a gathering of Muslim religious leaders
Friday that the move wasn't an attempt to Westernize Pakistani society.</LD>
<LD>   "We want progress but not Westernization," he told the meeting of
clerics. Musharraf said his vision for Pakistan is neither what he termed
an "ultramodern" state nor one ruled by religious extremists. Instead, he
said, he wants to create a society that follows a middle ground.</LD>
<LD>   "We can be both progressive and religious at the same time," said
Musharraf, who came to power in a 1999 coup.</LD>
<TE>   Musharraf's comments at the meeting, which was arranged by the
country's Ministry of Religious Affairs, was clearly an attempt to reach
out to powerful clerics after his government's move against militants.</TE>
<TE>   Police sweeps have so far led to the detention of about 2,000
suspected militants and the closure of the offices of five extremist
groups. Together with Musharraf's embrace of the West in the wake of the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the United States, the move has deeply
unsettled some conservatives here.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Musharraf had harsh words for militant Islamists,
describing them as people who "did not want to learn anything other than
religion and wanted to impose their views on others."</TE>
<TE>   "We need to end this culture of violence, hatred, terrorism, extremism
and sectarianism," he told the conference.</TE>
<TE>   Some religious leaders voiced support for Musharraf's comments.</TE>
<TE>   "It's what I stand for and the bulk of Pakistanis stand for," said
Khurshid Ahmad, vice president of Jamaat-i-Islami, Pakistan's largest
religion-based political party. "What he said is perfectly all right."</TE>
<TE>   Jamaat-i-Islami supported the former Taliban government in Afghanistan
and played a relatively minor role in the anti-American, anti-government
street demonstrations last fall in Pakistan's major cities. It rejects
violence as a political tactic.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf cited educational reform as a key to social reform and any
movement toward the envisioned middle ground between Westernization and
Islamic militancy. Pakistan's current educational structure includes a
small number of expensive English-language private schools that cater to
an urban elite; a far larger system of Urdu-language public schools
attended mainly by middle-class students; and a growing number of
religious schools, or madrasas, that offer a free but extremely narrow
education, mainly to boys from poor families.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, a growing number of madrasas have begun preaching an
aggressive kind of anti-Westernism. The tone of this message helped fuel
the initial convulsion of anti-American sentiment that swept the country
in the first days after Sept. 11. Musharraf said the religious school
curriculum should be revamped.</TE>
<TE>   "We want the students who are educated in the madrasas to be useful
and productive members of society," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf also told the religious leaders to stay out of Pakistan's
standoff with India over Kashmir--a face-off that has led to a major
military buildup on both sides of the 1972 cease-fire line that divides
the disputed Himalayan region.</TE>
<TE>   "You people should trust the government on it," he told them.</TE>

visit to China, reports have surfaced that the U.S.-made presidential
plane for Chinese President Jiang Zemin has been found to be bugged with
at least 20 listening devices.</LD>
<LD>   The Financial Times and the Washington Post reported today that the
newly outfitted Boeing 767 was planted with tiny bugging devices,
including one bug embedded in the headboard of the presidential bed on
board the aircraft, according to unidentified sources. The devices were
sophisticated models that could be operated by satellite, the Financial
Times reported.</LD>
<LD>   The British newspaper said Jiang was apparently furious at the
discovery, made after aircraft personnel heard a strange whining noise
during test flights last September.</LD>
<TE>   The Chinese Foreign Ministry had no immediate comment. A U.S. Embassy
spokesman in Beijing also declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   However, the spokesman said that preparations for the president's Feb.
21-22 visit to Beijing were still underway, including the arrival here
today of a White House "pre-advance team" to do some initial scouting and
setup for the summit.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Bush came to China last October and was feted in Shanghai during
a meeting of regional leaders even after the bugs aboard Jiang's plane
were reportedly found. Since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the World
Trade Center and the Pentagon, Beijing has been generally supportive of
the American-led war on terrorism and regarded Bush's upcoming visit as
another step to solidify bilateral ties.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the incident could prove embarrassing and adverse for Sino-U.S.
relations.</TE>
<TE>   The two nations' last major contretemps also involved concerns over
espionage. In April, a U.S. spy plane collided with a Chinese fighter jet
off the southern Chinese coast and was forced to make an emergency
landing on China's Hainan island. The 24-member crew of the downed EP-3
reconnaissance plane was detained on the island for 11 days before being
allowed to go home. Sino-U.S. relations plunged to their lowest level in
two years.</TE>
<TE>   Yet during that strained time, the Boeing 767 bought by the Chinese
government for Jiang's use was still being refitted in Texas. The
airliner, originally destined for use by Delta Air Lines, was watched 24
hours a day by unarmed Chinese guards at San Antonio International
Airport, according to a Sept. 29 report in the San Antonio Express-News.</TE>
<TE>   The newspaper said that the plane was being outfitted as a luxury
airliner able to accommodate up to 100 passengers, divided into different
sections according to official rank.</TE>
<TE>   Jiang, as president, had his own bedroom, bathroom with shower,
48-inch television and red carpet "fit for a king," the newspaper said.</TE>
<TE>   During the flap over the downed U.S. surveillance plane, the Chinese
appeared worried that the U.S. would seize the aircraft in retaliation
for the detention of the EP-3's crew, but that did not happen, the
newspaper said.</TE>
<TE>   How and when the listening devices were installed remains unexplained
because the plane was fenced off and under constant watch while in San
Antonio. It was flown to China via Hawaii last August, the Texas
newspaper said.</TE>
<TE>   In its report today, the Financial Times quoted Chinese military
officials as saying that 20 Chinese air force officers have been held for
questioning about the bugging and could face arrest. Two officials with
the Chinese company charged with importing the plane also are being
questioned, the report said. An official investigation has been launched
into potential negligence on the Chinese side.</TE>
<TE>   Espionage has become an increasingly contentious issue between
Washington and Beijing in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the diplomatic tussle over the EP-3, Sino-U.S.
relations were dragged down by U.S. allegations that Wen Ho Lee, a
scientist at Los Alamos, stole important nuclear secrets and passed them
to China.</TE>
<TE>   Beijing also officially discounts U.S. assertions that faulty
intelligence led to the 1999 bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade,
Yugoslavia, by North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces during the air
war in Kosovo. Three Chinese were killed in the attack.</TE>
<TE>   But there has also been increasing cooperation on the intelligence
front where the two countries have found it helpful. Since Sept. 11,
Beijing has offered to share intelligence with Washington in its war on
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, intelligence-gathering lies at the very root of Washington's
relationship with Communist China. In the early 1970s, before formal
diplomatic ties were established, Beijing allowed the CIA to set up a
listening post in China to monitor the Soviet Union.</TE>

<DL>SAO PAULO, Brazil
</DL>
<LD>The Roman Catholic Church on Friday ended a schism that had divided
it for three decades, as followers of the late Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre
were welcomed back into the fold.</LD>
<LD>   Vatican representative Cardinal Dario Castrillon Hoyos declared the
dispute officially over during an evening ceremony in Campos, 430 miles
northeast of Sao Paulo.</LD>
<LD>   Followers of the ultraconservative Lefebvre, known as
"traditionalists," rejected the liberalizing reforms of the 1962-65
Second Vatican Council. The reforms include allowing priests to face the
congregation and to celebrate Mass in languages other than Latin.</LD>
<TE>   In 1976, Pope Paul VI officially suspended Lefebvre, who founded the
Society of St. Pius X order. The maverick bishop was excommunicated in
1988 after having ordained four bishops in defiance of Rome. He died in
1991. Friday's ceremony lifted that excommunication.</TE>

<HD>Putin Aide Defends Tally in Chechnya</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Kremlin aide denied Friday that his office had issued orders to
underreport troop casualties in Chechnya. Meanwhile, rebel attacks
continued with a car bombing and an assault on a Chechen mayor.</LD>
<LD>   Human rights groups have long accused the military of hiding losses in
the 28-month-old war in the breakaway republic.</LD>
<LD>   The Izvestia newspaper on Friday cited an unnamed source in the
federal military command for Chechnya as saying he and colleagues had
orders from Sergei Yastrzhembsky, an aide to President Vladimir V. Putin,
to report only a limited number of losses.</LD>
<TE>   Yastrzhembsky denied the claim Friday, telling reporters it was
"complete nonsense."</TE>
<TE>   There have been conflicting reports in recent days about casualties
from rebel ambushes and mine blasts of Russian convoys.</TE>
<TE>   Yastrzhembsky's office said seven troops had been killed in incidents
Wednesday and Thursday. But an official with the pro-Moscow
administration in Chechnya said 20 troops had been killed during that
period in the province. Izvestia put the figure at 30.</TE>
<TE>   Official estimates of Russian losses in Chechnya since 1999 are about
3,500 dead and more than 11,000 wounded. The Soldiers' Mothers of Russia
group estimates that the figures are more than double that, based on
information from wounded troops and soldiers' relatives.</TE>
<TE>   Civilian and rebel casualties are even harder to pin down.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, a car bomb went off as a military convoy passed it in the
capital, Grozny, an official with the pro-Moscow administration in
Chechnya said. Two officers were wounded.</TE>
<TE>   Rebels opened fire on the mayor of the Chechen town of Argun, which
saw intense fighting recently, the official said on condition of
anonymity. The mayor was unharmed, but his driver was killed and his
bodyguard was wounded.</TE>

<HD>Court TV Denied Bid to Air Trial</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A federal judge Friday denied a request for televised coverage of
the trial of Zacarias Moussaoui, the only person charged in connection
with the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema said she would not set aside a ban
on photographing and broadcasting federal criminal proceedings. The ban
"does not violate the constitutional rights of either the public or the
broadcast media," she said.</LD>
<LD>   Brinkema also cited security concerns in denying the request by the
Court TV cable network to televise the trial in Alexandria, Va.</LD>
<TE>   "Given the issues raised in the indictment, any societal benefits from
photographing and broadcasting these proceedings are heavily outweighed
by the significant dangers [that] worldwide broadcasting of this trial
would pose to the orderly and secure administration of justice," the
judge wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui's lawyer, Edward MacMahon Jr., told an earlier hearing that
his client supported a televised trial, though with some restrictions.
Television, he said, would provide Moussaoui with "an added layer of
protection" for a fair trial. The defense did not want replays during
each trial day unless the jury was sequestered.</TE>
<TE>   MacMahon had no comment concerning the order, citing a request by his
client. Moussaoui is accused of six conspiracy counts of being an
accomplice to the Sept. 11 attacks. He could face the death penalty if
convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Court TV spokeswoman Betsy Vorce said the network would decide early
next week whether to appeal. Court TV chief executive Henry Schleiff said
he is optimistic that Congress will soon pass legislation permitting
cameras in federal courts, subject to the trial judge's discretion.</TE>
<TE>   C-SPAN, the public affairs cable network that joined the Court TV
motion, said it will not join any appeal but will continue to fight such
bans in the future.</TE>

<HD>Military Balks at Security Flights Over U.S. Cities</HD>
<DH>Patrols: Pentagon officials say that the round-the-clock operations
are straining resources and budgets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ESTHER SCHRADER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Air Force and Air National Guard are pushing to cut back
round-the-clock air patrols over some U.S. cities, saying the
unprecedented security flights are straining their planes, pilots and
crews, senior Pentagon officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "That was never intended to be a permanent thing," said Air Force
Secretary James Roche, referring to the 24-hour-a-day homeland defense
flights being flown since Sept. 11 over Washington, New York and other
cities.</LD>
<LD>   "The question is, at what point can we come back . . . to something
that may be more easily managed."</LD>
<TE>   The comments by Roche at a breakfast with defense writers were the
latest and most public of a drumbeat of complaints about the program
within the Air Force and National Guard. Commanders managing the flights
have told senior Pentagon officials in recent weeks that they are
straining aging jets, maintenance crews and budgets.</TE>
<TE>   The military has flown more than 13,600 air defense flights since
Sept. 11 at an estimated cost of $324 million. Military officials say
continuing the missions indefinitely would tax defense resources and,
ultimately, require an additional congressional appropriation.</TE>
<TE>   Roche said Friday that, besides the wear and tear on the aircraft, the
daily patrols are taking away from time that pilots and crews need to
train for overseas combat missions.</TE>
<TE>   Rear Adm. John D. Stufflebeem, deputy director of operations for the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, also said this week that the Pentagon was
evaluating the long-term feasibility of the patrols.</TE>
<TE>   "We're watching carefully to see, are we putting undue stress on a
system that can't accept it?" Stufflebeem said. "If you overuse military
equipment, or you don't give crews time to train, they may not be ready"
for the next mission.</TE>
<TE>   Pilots flying the air patrols make the same complaint.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to do some training to keep the sword sharp," said 1st Lt.
Gil Acosta, a 27-year-old fighter pilot from Orlando, Fla., who was
reassigned from combat missions over Iraq to fly the combat air patrols.
"Now you're flying around every day. The sword isn't getting any
sharper."</TE>
<TE>   Defense officials said the Air Force had begun discussions with the
new office of homeland security on limiting the number of flights. "Yeah,
it's being discussed, but we haven't got it figured out yet," a Pentagon
official said.</TE>
<TE>   But even as they negotiate with homeland defense officials to cut down
the Pentagon's commitment to aviation safety, Air Force officials
acknowledge that keeping the skies safe is not easy.</TE>
<TE>   Since the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the
Pentagon, Air Force and NATO Airborne Warning and Control Systems
aircraft have patrolled U.S. skies. And Air Force F-15 and F-16 fighter
jets have flown continuously over New York and Washington. Altogether,
more than 250 planes have flown on the homeland defense missions,
including fighter jets, AWACS planes, C-130 transport planes and tanker
aircraft, which refuel the fighters in mid-flight.</TE>
<TE>   The air patrols have responded to Federal Aviation Administration
concerns 266 times since they were instituted, but none of the incidents
proved to be threatening, said Barry Venable, a spokesman for the North
American Aerospace Defense Command, which manages the missions.</TE>
<TE>   Some military experts have argued that the new security measures
imposed by Congress and the FAA make the combat air patrols unnecessary.</TE>
<TE>   Others say the fighter jets are more useful for making people feel
secure than for their potential to actually bring down a plane hijacked
by a suicide bomber.</TE>
<TE>   The jets were not able to do anything recently when a 15-year-old
student pilot took off alone in a private plane, violated military
airspace and crashed into a Tampa, Fla., office building.</TE>
<TE>   "Quite frankly, the place to stop incidents in the air is on the
ground before they happen," a Pentagon official said. "There's many
levels that need to be worked through before you call in the guys with
the guns."</TE>
<TE>   Roche said that the FAA should begin to take more responsibility not
just for improved airport security but also for "tracking and
pinpointing" suspicious planes.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're trying to look at is, can we maintain the confidence of
the government and the American people--recognizing that much has been
done with airlines, much has been done on airport security--and can we
start to have a less burdensome posture," he said.</TE>

<HD>To Some, War Zones Beckon Like a Tourist Destination</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>They mean well, mostly, arriving in war-torn capitals with good
wishes and strong backs and, sometimes, muddled minds. Some are
missionaries toting Bibles, looking for converts. Others are "war
tourists" seeking adventure, delighting in the danger. Still others are
former notables, eager to recapture the spotlight of world attention.</LD>
<LD>   But like Clark Russell Bowers, the Alabamian whose family said on
Tuesday that he had been kidnapped by an Afghan warlord and on Friday
that he had been released, those who flock to danger zones are vulnerable
to the very pangs of war that drew them in the first place.</LD>
<LD>   "Americans have big hearts that often lead them to want to do good
where good is most needed," said one State Department official who asked
not to be named for fear of offending any U.S. citizen. "Unfortunately,
the places where good is most needed are often the places that are the
most dangerous."</LD>
<TE>   "As much as we might want to, we can't expect people to stop behaving
as human beings," said Alan Lipman, a psychologist who directs Georgetown
University's Center for the Study of Violence. "The wish for change, for
excitement--none of these are suspended in a time of war."</TE>
<TE>   War zones tend to attract colorful characters, anyway. In addition to
the soldiers, journalists and aid workers who make their living in it,
there are their shadows: mercenaries who fight for hire, amateur
photographers, solitary Samaritans who offer charity.</TE>
<TE>   During the Nigerian civil war in the late 1960s, a journalist named
Freddy Forsyth left the British Broadcasting Corp. and joined the Biafran
army as a Col. Acheson, an expert on guns--or at least that's how the
Biafrans introduced him to former Times foreign correspondent Stanley
Meisler. Later, of course, Forsyth became famous as the author of "The
Day of the Jackal," in which an expert on guns tries to kill French
President Charles de Gaulle.</TE>
<TE>   During the civil strife in Beirut in the late 1970s, a West Point
cadet decided to visit Lebanon on his summer vacation, to write a paper
on what a real war was like. U.S. Embassy officials, mindful of the
bonanza for Hezbollah forces in taking hostage a West Point cadet,
quickly squired him out of the country.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, two young men from Pasadena said they made their way to
Afghanistan to offer their photographic insights on a Web site. Former UC
Santa Barbara students Todd Ruiz and Adam Prentiss, with no professional
experience, said they hoped their work would offer a perspective
different from the establishment press on "marginalized, forgotten and
misunderstood" parts of the world.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a certain set of people who are driven by an idealist
bent," said Dr. Frederick Burkle, a psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins
University who directs program development for the school's Center for
International Emergency, Disaster and Refugee Studies. "They may feel
some omnipotence, that bad things won't happen to them. They are driven
by adventure. We are always testing out our mortality."</TE>
<TE>   Many are drawn to war zones to be part of history's drama. Like
autograph seekers who follow Hollywood celebrities, they hope the
excitement of the encounter will add glitter or gravitas to their own
lives.</TE>
<TE>   An aid worker recalled a woman who showed up at an airport after the
Kosovo war, asking to be directed to the shopping district. She was sent
home. But when a contractor showed up offering woodworking services, he
was put to work.</TE>
<TE>   Or they are "true thrill seekers, in the most direct sense," Lipman
said.</TE>
<TE>   Four American hikers--Tommy Caldwell, Beth Rodden, John Dickey and
Jason Smith--ignored State Department warnings against travel to
Kyrgyzstan. They were kidnapped in the summer of 2000 by the Islamic
Movement of Uzbekistan. They escaped six days later.</TE>
<TE>   Still others are, perhaps, a bit eccentric.</TE>
<TE>   A California man bearing a 15-foot cross said he had visited 60
countries and walked 22,000 miles "praying for peace" when he walked into
war-torn Beirut with his 11-year-old son in 1982.</TE>
<TE>   These adventurers sometimes have an innocent charm about them. But
naive assumptions about war and travel--Bowers told his wife to put his
$25,000 ransom on their credit card--can lead to deadly outcomes.</TE>
<TE>   An American missionary couple, Gracia and Martin Burnham, were
kidnapped last May by Muslim extremists in the Philippines. They are
still in captivity, while another American, Guillermo Sobero, was
beheaded by his captors.</TE>
<TE>   And two Christian aid workers, Heather Mercer, of Vienna, Va., and
Dayna Curry, of Thompson's Station, Tenn., were arrested by the Taliban
in Afghanistan and accused of promoting Christianity in August, before
their much-publicized release three months later.</TE>
<TE>   For some, trouble begets trouble. In the case of Bowers, news coverage
prompted friends to publicly question his emotional health. It also
brought to light discrepancies in his resume: He didn't play basketball
for Pepperdine or manage the election campaign of Rep. Dana Rohrabacher
(R-Huntington Beach), as claimed.</TE>
<TE>   Associated Press quoted an FBI spokesman in Alabama on Friday as
saying Bowers was in Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Professional relief workers, whose numbers have swelled in a decade of
strife in Somalia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Rwanda, Kosovo and Afghanistan,
dread the complications from loose-cannon visitors.</TE>
<TE>   Bob MacPherson, a former Marine colonel who now trains the CARE staff
on safety and security, noted that the expanding web of nongovernmental
organizations closely coordinates its work to avoid duplication and
maximize effectiveness. It's dicey, he said, "to put a wild card in there
who may not quite be aware of local sensibilities."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the adventurers come.</TE>
<TE>   Linda Adams was kidnapped by Rwandan rebels in Uganda in 1999. An
American couple were killed during the ordeal. Adams escaped by faking an
asthma attack. She told the BBC that her father had warned her against
the trip but she told him, "It wasn't going to happen to me."</TE>

<DL>MONTGOMERY, Ala.
</DL>
<LD>An Alabama man who said he was kidnapped by a tribal warlord in
Afghanistan and held for $25,000 ransom has been released after 10 days
of frequent torture, his wife said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Clark Russell Bowers' wife, Amanda, said he called Friday morning from
Pakistan and told her of being tortured by his captors. She didn't say if
any ransom had been paid.</LD>
<LD>   "He did suffer some torture, and that has taken some of the joy," she
told reporters at her home in Harvest, Ala.. "But he is in a safe
location. He needs peace."</LD>
<TE>   In Birmingham, Ala., FBI spokesman Craig Dahle said the agency had
confirmed Bowers was in Karachi, Pakistan. "We're still trying to hook up
with him," he said. "That hopefully will happen in the near future."</TE>
<TE>   Bowers, 37, was on a privately arranged humanitarian mission to
Afghanistan when he called his wife Jan. 9 and said he and his Afghan
interpreter had been taken hostage.</TE>
<TE>   According to his wife, Bowers said his flight from Istanbul to Kabul,
the Afghan capital, landed safely but that he and the interpreter were
abducted, blindfolded and driven for several hours.</TE>
<TE>   His wife said he called again Monday and explained how the ransom for
him was to be paid.</TE>
<TE>   A family friend, Karen Allen, said it was uncertain when Bowers might
return home. There was no information about the interpreter.</TE>
<TE>   "I know you all have a lot of questions and they will be answered in
good time," Amanda Bowers told the reporters. "Now's not the time."</TE>

<HD>Musharraf Says He Suspects Bin Laden Is Dead</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>Pakistan's president said in an interview broadcast Friday that he
believes Osama bin Laden is dead, the victim of kidney failure during the
U.S. bombing campaign against Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   "I think now, frankly, he is dead for the reason that he is a patient,
a kidney patient," President Pervez Musharraf said in a CNN broadcast.</LD>
<LD>   Two dialysis machines were donated to Afghanistan, one of which was
"specifically for [Bin Laden's] personal use," Musharraf said.</LD>
<TE>   However, U.S. officials have no evidence that Bin Laden has had severe
kidney problems, much less died of them, one official said, speaking in
Washington on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Gen. Tommy Franks, commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, said he
was aware of the Musharraf statement, adding, "I haven't seen anything in
intelligence that would confirm or deny that.</TE>
<TE>   "We really don't know where he is, whether he's in Afghanistan or
whether he may have left. But we know this: The world is not a large
enough place for him to hide. He might today, he might hide tomorrow, but
it's not large enough for him to hide in," Franks said.</TE>
<TE>   White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said Friday that U.S.
officials do not know whether Bin Laden has died, but added, "I don't
think the president would view that as an unwelcome event."</TE>
<TE>   However, U.S. intelligence has some evidence that Bin Laden survived
the destruction of many of Al Qaeda's camps and caves, American officials
said. The United States hopes that prisoner interrogations and other
intelligence sources will warm up the trail to Bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   Bin Laden has long been rumored to be suffering from several
illnesses, including kidney and heart trouble. None of the ailments has
been confirmed.</TE>
<TE>   Bin Laden, reportedly about 44 years old, last appeared in a videotape
broadcast Dec. 26, during which he praised the perpetrators of the Sept.
11 terror attacks in the United States. Bin Laden looked pale and gaunt
on the tape.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if he has been getting all that treatment in Afghanistan
now," Musharraf said of Bin Laden. "And the photographs that have been
shown of him on television show him extremely weak."</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf did not indicate whether he had intelligence reports to back
up his suspicions. Musharraf said he believes Bin Laden is in Afghanistan
if he is alive.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Musharraf told Chinese television there was a "great
possibility" that Bin Laden had been killed by U.S. bombing.</TE>

<DL>BOSTON
</DL>
<LD>A man allegedly trained by Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist
network pleaded not guilty Friday to trying to blow up a transatlantic
flight with bombs hidden in his shoes.</LD>
<LD>   Richard C. Reid, a 28-year-old British citizen, shuffled into a
federal courtroom in shackles and answered "not guilty" to eight charges,
including the attempted murder of 197 passengers and crew members aboard
an American Airlines flight last month. A judge also entered a not guilty
plea on his behalf to a ninth charge.</LD>
<LD>   Reid was initially charged with interfering with a flight crew. New
charges issued this week accuse him of having been trained in Afghanistan
and of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction.</LD>
<TE>   Reid was subdued by flight attendants and passengers on the
Paris-to-Miami flight Dec. 22 after he allegedly attempted to light a
fuse protruding from his shoes.</TE>
<TE>   "If it weren't for them, this most definitely would have been a
disaster," Charles Prouty, special agent in charge of the Boston FBI
office, said after the hearing.</TE>
<TE>   The case is being prosecuted in Boston because the plane was diverted
to the city's Logan International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   Among the charges is attempted wrecking of a mass transportation
vehicle, which was enacted by Congress after the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Reid's attorney, Tamar Birckhead, asked U.S. Magistrate Judge Judith
Dein to enter a not guilty plea on Reid's behalf, questioning whether the
American flight would qualify as mass transportation.</TE>

<LD>About 30 cars of a 112-car train carrying fertilizer derailed near
Minot, sending a toxic gas cloud over a neighborhood. One resident died
after inhaling the gas, and about 100 people were treated for respiratory
problems; 15 were admitted to a hospital.</LD>
<LD>   By evening, three cars still were leaking but the affected area was
confined to a square mile, Fire Chief Bob Wetzler said.</LD>
<LD>   The fertilizer, anhydrous ammonia, is transported as a liquid but

<HD>'Black Hawk' Uplifts Military Crowd</HD>
<DH>Film: The Pentagon is pleased with what it considers an accurate
portrayal of the 1993 Somalia incident.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A movie theater on Connecticut Avenue this week took on the jarring
flavor of a combined Hollywood premiere and military officers' bash.
Cinema heartthrobs in T-shirts and leather jackets huddled with
muscle-bound Delta Force and Ranger vets.</LD>
<LD>   The seats held more brass than the Glenn Miller Orchestra: Defense
Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, Army Secretary Thomas E. White Jr. and rows
of beribboned generals and soldier heroes who sat with Josh Hartnett,
William Fichtner and other actors who portrayed them.</LD>
<LD>   Even Vice President Dick Cheney's location was disclosed that night:
the Uptown Theater.</LD>
<TE>   The occasion was the Washington opening of "Black Hawk Down," a film
with a particular resonance in the five-ringed corridors of the Pentagon,
where an open gash from the Sept. 11 terrorist attack remains--and where
military strategists are plotting a return to Somalia, scene of the
disastrous 1993 incident that gave rise to the best-selling book that
inspired the movie.</TE>
<TE>   "Black Hawk Down" is an unrelenting recounting of the botched U.S.
attempt to nab several lieutenants of Somali warlord Mohammed Farah
Aidid. The outcome was the destruction of two Black Hawk helicopters, the
deaths of 18 Americans and the still-haunting scene of a dead U.S.
soldier being dragged through the streets of Mogadishu by an angry mob.</TE>
<TE>   Most of America finally gets the chance to see the $90-million movie
this weekend, when it goes into wide release some weeks earlier than
initially planned in order to capitalize on the nation's current
patriotic fervor.</TE>
<TE>   The film benefited from unusually close cooperation between the
filmmakers and the Pentagon, which saw "Black Hawk Down" as a way to
reclaim the Somali disaster as a proud moment for the military.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon can only hope that any new incursions in the terrorist
haven of Somalia turn out better than the last one. But the film, like
the book by journalist Mark Bowden, focuses not on the debacle but on the
heroism of the soldiers put in harm's way. It spotlights the Delta Force
and Ranger troops who have played such a central role in the current
campaign in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   In the film, Delta and Ranger soldiers stagger through Mogadishu's
maze of alleys, picked off one by one by Somali fighters who rocket past
them in Jeeps, assault rifles blazing. The stunned Americans muddle
through, drawing on each other for survival over a day and a night,
uncertain if any of them can last until morning.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, this depiction has won the unqualified praise of
soldiers. That's not always the case when Hollywood dons battle fatigues,
although Sept. 11 has generally buffed up the relationship.</TE>
<TE>   None of those at the premiere seemed able to find fault, certainly not
a weeping Chief Warrant Officer Rodney "Sam" Shemp, who spent 18 hours in
a helicopter during the Somali battle depicted on the screen.</TE>
<TE>   "Powerful," Rumsfeld declared.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a very good portrayal of urban war fighting. It is like that,"
said Sgt. Maj. Phil Prater, who served in Panama. "The training and the
togetherness, the oneness, the teamwork in that type of environment was
just shown through. You do rely on the person next to you, your battle
buddy. And if you don't take care of each other, nobody's going to come
back."</TE>
<TE>   The military and filmmakers both used the gathering to poke fun at
war-spooked politicians. Sony Chairman Howard Stringer recalled his
mid-1960s Army stint in Vietnam, while Army Secretary White mentioned the
Army's cooperation with the filmmakers, which allowed director Ridley
Scott to film real soldiers and government-delivered Black Hawk
helicopters on the Moroccan set.</TE>
<TE>   Bowden said he wrote the story with little formal help from the
Pentagon and carefully annotated it because he expected the military to
criticize it.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to make sure I constructed that book like a fortress," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   But he also came away feeling the Pentagon had failed to convey its
own story, leaving only the tarnish of a mission that resulted in the
U.S. withdrawal from Somalia and a newfound military caution by a
chastened Clinton administration. Many believe the U.S. flight from
Somalia helped persuade Osama bin Laden, the alleged mastermind of the
Sept. 11 attacks, that Americans had no stomach for war.</TE>
<TE>   "The men who fought there, even though they were honored in the
military, were tainted by the broader brush of failure," Bowden said.
"These military men and women did something very difficult and dangerous
at a tremendous cost. And for them to be portrayed as bumblers and
incompetents is deeply unfair, on top of all the losses they sustained."</TE>
<TE>   The tone of cooperation between the Pentagon and Hollywood was set
when producer Jerry Bruckheimer arrived at the Pentagon office of Army
Vice Chief of Staff Gen. John M. Keane and said, "General, I'm going to
make a movie that you and your Army will be proud of."</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon usually declines to help in movies made abroad. But this
time it pulled out all the stops for a four-month shoot in Morocco,
sending 139 soldiers from Ft. Benning, Ga., and Ft. Campbell, Ky., and
eight helicopters from bases in Europe and the United States. Army
aviators pilot the movie's Black Hawk helicopter gunships. The soldiers
shown rappelling from them were on loan from Ft. Benning's 75th Ranger
regiment. Last February, Hartnett, Ewan MacGregor, Tom Sizemore and a
handful of other actors learned Army culture and weapon handling at Ft.
Campbell and Ft. Benning.</TE>
<TE>   The studio reimbursed the Army $2.2 million for soldiers'
transportation, food, housing and laundry.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Priest Guilty of Fondling Boy in '91</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH GETLIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>In a case that shed harsh light on how the Roman Catholic Church
deals with pedophilia in the clergy, a Cambridge, Mass., jury on Friday
convicted a defrocked priest of fondling a boy 10 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   John Geoghan, 66, could face up to 10 years in prison when he is
sentenced next week. He also faces two other criminal cases involving
similar allegations and 84 civil lawsuits accusing him of sexual abuse of
children over the last 30 years.</LD>
<LD>   As he had for the entire trial, Geoghan sat impassively as the verdict
was read. He did not testify in his defense, and his attorney, Geoffrey
Packard, did not call witnesses. Geoghan, who pleaded not guilty, said he
was merely helping the boy out of a swimming pool when the incident
occurred, according to Packard.</LD>
<TE>   More than 130 people have claimed that Geoghan either raped or fondled
them during the three decades he worked in several Boston-area parishes.
Additionally, 118 people have sued Bernard Cardinal Law, the archbishop
of Boston, for failing to discipline or remove Geoghan from the clergy,
even after numerous allegations about inappropriate behavior had
surfaced.</TE>
<TE>   Geoghan finally was ejected from the priesthood in 1995, but not
before Law had employed what is called the "geographic cure,"
transferring Geoghan from one parish to another as allegations surfaced
against him. Earlier, Law offered a public apology, asking for prayers
"for those who bear the pain of these acts" and also for himself,
acknowledging that he has been struggling with how to confront the issue
as a leader of the church.</TE>
<TE>   Law pledged that the archdiocese of Boston would have "zero tolerance"
for sexual abuse by priests. The archdiocese already has paid $10 million
to settle about 50 such cases, and Law conceded last week that his
handling of Geoghan's case was "in retrospect, tragically incorrect."</TE>
<TE>   During Geoghan's trial, the victim, now a 20-year-old college student,
testified that the priest had fondled him at the Waltham Boys and Girls
Club in 1991 and that "it was kind of like bells went off. I got really
nervous. I got away as fast as possible." The victim's mother also
testified about the incident. Their identities were withheld by the
court.</TE>
<TE>   The case received widespread publicity, and Superior Court Judge
Sandra L. Hamilton went to great lengths to ensure a fair jury. One man
who was rejected as a juror said the case "is shattering my faith in the
priesthood."</TE>
<TE>   Packard argued that the plaintiff's case was driven by a desire to
make money, noting that he did not come forward with his allegation until
eight years after the incident. Packard also noted that the victim's
attorney filed a civil lawsuit soon after the victim went public with the
story.</TE>
<TE>   The two other criminal cases Geoghan faces involve allegations of
child rape and child molestation. His next trial is scheduled for Feb.
20.</TE>

<HD>Scientists' Panel Endorses Cloning to Create Stem Cells</HD>
<DH>Medicine: The influential National Academy of Sciences says
producing human clones should be illegal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN GARVEY</AU>
<AU>RICHARD T. COOPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Cloning to reproduce humans is currently unsafe and should be
illegal, but cloning to produce stem cells for medical research has
"considerable potential" and should be permitted, a National Academy of
Sciences panel said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The recommendation by some of the nation's top scientists could prove
influential as senators, many of whom are undecided on human cloning,
prepare to debate whether to join the House in banning the technique for
any purpose.</LD>
<LD>   Most lawmakers want to ban cloning as a way to produce children, but a
moral and political debate has flared over its use in the hunt for
disease cures.</LD>
<TE>   President Bush continues to favor a blanket ban on human cloning, his
spokesman said Friday. "As the president has stated, 'We should not, as a
society, grow life to destroy it,' " said Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer.
He said the president "looks at these issues from a scientific and moral
standpoint."</TE>
<TE>Presidential Council to Consider Report</TE>
<TE>   As the academy released its report, based strictly on scientific
considerations, the President's Council on Bioethics, created last summer
to weigh the moral implications of new biotechnologies, was meeting to
consider possible restrictions on embryonic cloning.</TE>
<TE>   Council Chairman Leon R. Kass, a University of Chicago bioethicist,
said he would circulate the academy report to members of his panel and
invite representatives to discuss it with the council.</TE>
<TE>   Compared to reproductive cloning, Kass said, "therapeutic cloning is a
much more complicated issue" in moral terms, in part because of its
potential for preserving life and alleviating suffering.</TE>
<TE>   The National Academy of Sciences report was embraced by advocates for
sufferers of diseases such as Parkinson's and diabetes, which many hope
will prove susceptible to treatments developed from stem cells derived
from cloned embryos. The broadest patient advocacy group said the
recommendations from the academy "could not have come at a better time."</TE>
<TE>   "We feel strongly that the American public would support biomedical
research using [therapeutic cloning] to produce lifesaving embryonic stem
cells if they are given a chance to fully understand the difference from
reproductive cloning," said Michael Manganiello, president of the
Coalition for the Advancement of Medical Research.</TE>
<TE>   Cloning opponents, by contrast, blasted the scientists'
recommendations.</TE>
<TE>   "It is deeply disturbing that the National Academy of Sciences feels
they can divide humanity into two different classes and condemn one class
of humans to destruction--creating a human embryo for the express purpose
of destroying it," said Sen. Sam Brownback (R-Kan.), a leading opponent
of cloning research.</TE>
<TE>   The issue of human cloning, which has prompted references in Congress
to "Frankenstein" scenarios, has proved extremely sensitive for lawmakers
and scientists alike.</TE>
<TE>   In Friday's report, the academy panel referred to cloning for research
purposes not as "therapeutic cloning" but as "nuclear transplantation to
produce stem cells."</TE>
<TE>   Douglas Johnson, the legislative director for the National Right to
Life Committee, called the language shift a "smoke screen of euphemisms."</TE>
<TE>   "The word games are disturbing," Johnson said. "It's clear that what
these scientists want is to permit these labs to mass-produce human
embryos for the purpose of killing them."</TE>
<TE>Analysis Could Have 'Tremendous Impact'</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of therapeutic cloning argue that it could be permitted
without a "slippery slope" to the creation of a cloned human baby
occurring.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Perry, head of the Alliance for Aging Research, predicted the
academy analysis would "have a tremendous impact on shaping the terms of
debate: whether Americans are prepared to take the unprecedented step of
imposing criminal penalties on researchers who are trying to find
treatments for diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's."</TE>
<TE>   In cloning, scientists remove the DNA from an egg and replace it with
genetic material from another person--the procedure referred to as
nuclear transplantation. The result is an embryo with the genetic makeup
of only one parent instead of a combination of two.</TE>
<TE>   Some researchers say the ability to produce genetically identical stem
cells--cells in the earliest form of development that still have the
potential to become any part of the body--has great potential. An organ
that could be grown using a individual's own genetic material would not
be rejected as a foreign object, a common problem in transplant
surgeries.</TE>
<TE>   Still, scientists caution that research is far from that stage, and
cloning opponents argue that advances can be made in science using stem
cells derived from sources other than cloning.</TE>
<TE>   The National Academy of Sciences report said any ban on reproductive
human cloning should be reviewed within five years if new science
indicates the procedure would be safe and a national dialogue on the
"societal, religious and ethical issues" warrants reconsideration.</TE>
<TE>   One "potential benefit" of reproductive cloning, the report said, "is
that it offers one solution for complete infertility."</TE>
<TE>   The president's bioethics committee, meeting for the second time
Friday, took up the question of when scientific exploration should be
restricted.</TE>
<TE>   Council member Janet Rowley, whose pioneering research on chromosomes
led to advances in leukemia treatment, said more research is needed
before restrictions can be seriously considered.</TE>
<TE>   "We are asked to make judgments without the most basic information
necessary to make an informed judgment," she said. "The question of how
important this may be for medicine is very much unresolved. So it is
extremely important that we not erect barriers to American scientists
exploring it."</TE>
<TE>   In her own work, she said, it took about 30 years for her discoveries
about chromosomes to be translated into effective treatment. "We cannot
be impatient about this."</TE>
<TE>   Some members argued, however, that as a practical matter it would be
impossible to prevent embryos created for research from being used to
produce cloned babies.</TE>
<TE>   "The path from therapeutic cloning to reproductive cloning is clear
and I think inevitable," said Charles Krauthammer, a council member and
columnist for the Washington Post.</TE>
<TE>   And Stanford biologist William B. Hurlbut said, "There are many good
scientific reasons to do stem cell research. The morality of it is a
different question."</TE>

<HD>Cheney's Role Draws Scrutiny</HD>
<DH>Policy: Vice president's actions to help the energy giant in a
power plant dispute in India are backed by White House.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Vice President Dick Cheney sought to help Enron Corp. last year in
a multimillion-dollar dispute over a power plant in India, but his only
goal was to advance U.S. interests, the White House said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The vice president's actions--documented in retrieved White House
e-mails--brought no immediate allegations of wrongdoing, but a spokesman
for Democrats on the House Government Reform Committee called for more
details of Cheney's advocacy for the Houston-based energy trading firm.</LD>
<LD>   "This deserves a closer look," said Phil Schiliro, chief of staff for
Rep. Henry A. Waxman of Los Angeles, the panel's top Democrat.</LD>
<TE>   It is not unusual for administration officials to promote U.S.
business interests when traveling overseas, as Cheney was when he
broached the power plant issue to a leading politician in India. But
Enron's financial collapse late last year has focused attention on the
extensive political ties between the Bush administration and the company.</TE>
<TE>   Enron executives contacted Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and
Commerce Secretary Don Evans last autumn about the company's financial
troubles, but the Cabinet members have said they did not attempt to
intervene on its behalf.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney's involvement in the power plant dispute occurred in June,
before signs of Enron's problems had surfaced. Enron owns a 65% interest
in a $2.9-billion natural gas-fueled power generator built in Dabhol.</TE>
<TE>   The electricity board fell behind in payments for the plant, and Enron
launched arbitration proceedings in April. Enron claims it is owed $63.9
million.</TE>
<TE>   Also at stake in the dispute are more than $300 million in loans and
risk insurance put up by the Overseas Private Investment Corp., a federal
agency that provides political risk insurance to help U.S. firms invest
in developing countries.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney inquired about the status of the power plant when he met June
27 with Sonia Gandhi, head of India's Congress Party, White House Press
Secretary Ari Fleischer said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   One of the White House e-mails, written by a National Security Council
aide June 28, said: "Good news is that the veep mentioned Enron in his
meeting with Sonia Gandhi yesterday."</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer said that Cheney, in bringing up the matter, was simply
doing his job.</TE>
<TE>   "It is an important project to create jobs in America, and there's
also a taxpayer exposure as a result of the work that's being done
through the Overseas Private Investment Corp.," Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   He also noted that three of President Clinton's Commerce secretaries
made efforts to promote the Dabhol energy project.</TE>
<TE>   The White House e-mails indicated that President Bush was urged by
some advisors to bring up Enron's case in the financial dispute over the
plant when he met with Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee in
Washington on Nov. 9.</TE>
<TE>   But another e-mail, dated the day before the Oval Office meeting,
warned: "President Bush cannot talk about Dabhol."</TE>
<TE>   White House officials were not able to elaborate on this message
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   At least one administration official was cautioned to avoid playing
any role in the power plant matter because of previous connections to
Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer said Friday that White House economic advisor Lawrence B.
Lindsey received an ethics ruling from White House lawyers last year
advising him to have "no direct involvement in the Dabhol plant."</TE>
<TE>   Lindsey once served as a consultant to Enron, earning $50,000.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the political fallout of the Enron debacle took another
victim Friday as Texas' top utility regulator, a former Enron executive,
resigned.</TE>
<TE>   Max Yzaguirre, a former chief of Enron's operations in Mexico, led the
Texas Public Utility Commission in its initiative to deregulate the
electricity market. He has been under attack for failing to detail his
Enron duties on his application for the state post.</TE>
<TE>   Yzaguirre was appointed to the job in June by Texas Gov. Rick Perry,
who served as GOP lieutenant governor under former Gov. George W. Bush.
Texas Democrats have raised questions about hundreds of thousands of
dollars in political donations Enron executives have made to Perry's
campaigns since 1994, including a $25,000 contribution made by Enron
Chairman Kenneth L. Lay the day after Yzaguirre's appointment.</TE>
<TE>   Also Friday, congressional investigators met in Houston with Enron's
chief accounting officer, Richard A. Causey, and in New York with Michael
C. Odom, an Andersen partner who was relieved of management duties after
the destruction of Enron-related documents.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen, which was fired Thursday as Enron's auditor, has come under
criticism for not sounding alarms about the energy trader's questionable
financial practices.</TE>
<TE>   In other developments:</TE>
<TE>   * A plan to revive Enron's core trading operation through a cashless
sale to UBS Warburg, the New York investment banking arm of Swiss
financial services firm UBS AG, was approved by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Arthur Gonzalez, who said it was in the "best interest" of the company.
In court testimony, Enron financial consultant Steven Zelin said that
Enron, which would get a share of any future profits, could earn $1
billion to $2 billion over the next several years.</TE>
<TE>   * Connecticut Atty. Gen. Richard Blumenthal called for an
investigation into possible wrongdoing by Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   * The Florida attorney general's office subpoenaed documents from
Enron as part of a racketeering investigation into the sale of the energy
company's stock to the state pension fund while the share price was
plunging.</TE>

<DL>HOUSTON
</DL>
<LD>Politicians eager to dump their campaign contributions from
beleaguered Enron Corp. are pumping money into a Houston organization
seeking to help the bankrupt energy giant's laid-off employees.</LD>
<LD>   The Greater Houston Community Foundation had been informally
discussing how to help many of the 4,500 employees who found themselves
jobless in early December after Enron filed for bankruptcy.</LD>
<LD>   "We had great ideas and no funding," said Emelda Douglas, director of
donor services. "Since Wednesday, all of a sudden, someone has discovered
our idea and is willing to fund it."</LD>
<TE>   On Friday, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.) said she would donate
nearly $8,000 in campaign contributions from Enron and its accounting
firm, Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   New York Gov. George Pataki said he'd add a $5,000 campaign
contribution from the wife of Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas) said Thursday she plans to give

<DL>ATLANTA
</DL>
<LD>The pastor and 10 members of an Atlanta church that backs the
corporal punishment of children were charged with child abuse Friday for
allegedly beating two boys during services last year.</LD>
<LD>   The aggravated assault and child cruelty charges are the latest
development in the highly publicized investigation of the 130-member
House of Prayer church.</LD>
<LD>   Those indicted include the Rev. Arthur Allen Jr., 69, and 10 parents
of children who were taken into protective custody during the
investigation. Allen said he and members of his congregation will plead
innocent.</LD>
<TE>   "I will call for a trial by jury," Allen said at his church Friday.
"I'm delighted for the opportunity to face these charges, to resolve
everything one way or another."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutor Paul Howard said the spankings left both boys with open
wounds near vital organs. He said the boys were beaten after refusing to
cooperate and just "being kids."</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a normal whipping," Howard said. "These are severe and
extreme beatings."</TE>

<HD>Pfizer Loses Second Rezulin Suit</HD>
<DH>Courts: A Texas woman died after taking the diabetes drug. A jury
decides the company must pay up.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>EDINBURG, Texas
</DL>
<LD>Pfizer Inc.'s Warner-Lambert Co. unit must pay $23.4 million in
compensatory damages to the family of a woman who died after taking the
company's Rezulin diabetes drug, a Texas jury decided Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Jurors in state court in Edinburg deliberated more than four hours
before finding Rezulin was responsible for Beatrice Herrera's death. The
80-year-old woman died of liver failure after taking the diabetes drug
for three months.</LD>
<LD>   The case is among nearly 5,000 lawsuits scheduled to go to trial on
allegations that Warner-Lambert officials hid or sought to minimize
Rezulin's health risks. The drug was pulled off the U.S. market last year
after being blamed for at least 63 deaths tied to liver problems. Pfizer,
the world's largest drug maker, bought Warner-Lambert last year.</LD>
<TE>   "This corporation has no compassion, no soul and no shame," said
Joseph Chapa, a lawyer representing Herrera's family. "This corporation's
only motivation is greed."</TE>
<TE>   Warner-Lambert's lawyers countered that Rezulin didn't cause Herrera's
death and that the Food and Drug Administration found the drug was a safe
way to help diabetics regulate their insulin levels.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no evidence that this medicine was a poison," said Jack
Urquhart, a lawyer for New York-based Pfizer. The FDA found that
Warner-Lambert officials "thoroughly, carefully and completely" tested
the drug before putting it on the market, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The jury voted, 10 to 2, to order Pfizer to pay the $23.4 million as
compensatory damages to Herrera's family. That's more than half of the
$41.5 million the family's lawyers asked jurors to award in the case.</TE>
<TE>   Pfizer spokesman Bob Fauteux said the company will appeal the verdict.</TE>
<TE>   The jury is expected to begin deliberating punitive damages Tuesday if
a settlement isn't reached in the case over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   It's the second jury verdict handed down against Pfizer in a recent
wave of trials of individual lawsuits accusing Warner-Lambert executives
of covering up Rezulin's health risks.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, a Texas jury ordered the company to pay $43 million in
damages to a woman who said Rezulin destroyed her liver.</TE>
<TE>   The company later settled that case for more than $30 million, people
familiar with the agreement said. Pfizer officials dispute the number
while refusing to disclose the actual settlement amount.</TE>
<TE>   The company has settled at least two other cases for undisclosed
amounts.</TE>

<HD>Grand Canyon Rail Plan Urged to Curb Auto Use</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>FLAGSTAFF, Ariz.
</DL>
<LD>A tourist railroad that travels to Grand Canyon National Park is
proposing to run an express train as a way to reduce the number of autos
traveling to the canyon.</LD>
<LD>   Park officials have been trying to establish a light-rail system to
eliminate traffic congestion on the canyon's South Rim, which among other
things is contributing to a pollution problem at the park.</LD>
<LD>   The plan by the Grand Canyon Railway would compete with proposals
being explored by the National Park Service, which is considering banning
private vehicles from the South Rim and shuttling park visitors from
Tusayan to the canyon.</LD>
<TE>   Instead of park visitors boarding buses or light rail in Tusayan, six
miles away, the railway's plan would have visitors board trains 65 miles
away in Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Up to 1 million passengers could be accommodated during the
three-month peak summer season, according to railway officials.</TE>
<TE>   "The train would leave Williams and arrive at our existing depot in
the park right now," said W. David Chambers, Grand Canyon Railway
president. "We think because of that there will be less need for an
in-the-park transit system."</TE>
<TE>   The railway's existing depot is in the heart of Grand Canyon Village
on the South Rim.</TE>
<TE>   Unloading passengers within walking distance of most attractions would
eliminate the need for increased bus service within the park, Chambers
said.</TE>
<TE>   But the Flagstaff Innkeepers Assn. isn't ready to support the proposal
yet.</TE>
<TE>   The group's president, Ash Patel, said the innkeepers have a number of
questions, including whether the railway plans to build a new hotel on
property it owns in Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Canyon Forest Village, a proposal to build a hotel and restaurants in
Tusayan, was defeated by Coconino County voters in 2000 thanks to efforts
by the innkeepers, other professional associations and the communities of
Tusayan, Flagstaff and Williams.</TE>
<TE>   It would have been built next to a transit staging area that would see
visitors park their vehicles and board either trains or buses for the
trip to the South Rim.</TE>
<TE>   One of the main concerns was the new hotel and its 900 rooms would
siphon revenue from existing hotels in the gateway cities.</TE>
<TE>   Patel fears a new hotel associated with an express train would do the
same to Flagstaff hotels.</TE>
<TE>   Grand Canyon Railway currently runs a hotel at its depot in Williams,
but Chambers didn't say whether the company plans to build a new
facility.</TE>
<TE>   According to the railway's figures, the express train would bring
millions of dollars in new tourist revenue to both Flagstaff and
Williams.</TE>

<HD>A Big Piece of the Big Island, Maui Being Put On the Market</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HONOLULU
</DL>
<LD>C. Brewer &amp; Co. said Friday it has put all its land holdings--more
than 70,000 acres on the Big Island and Maui--on the market as another of
Hawaii's original Big Five sugar and pineapple plantation powers moves
toward liquidation.</LD>
<LD>   J. Alan Kugle, Brewer's real estate chief executive, said the company
hopes that a Hawaii company or organization will purchase the properties
as a package. But he said Brewer also could sell individual parcels to
small farm lessees and is giving first option to some leaseholders.</LD>
<LD>   The lands are among the most valuable and beautiful in Hawaii, and are
being put on the market for the first time in 140 years, he said.</LD>
<TE>   The lands being offered include about 30,000 acres in the Big Island's
Kau district, about 20,000 acres along the Big Island's Hamakua Coast and
about 20,000 acres through Maui's Central Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The Maui lands stretch from the south shore at Maalaea to the north
shore beyond Waihee, and include Iao Valley.</TE>

<HD>Ashcroft Visits Winter Olympics Site</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY
</DL>
<LD>Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft visited the site of next month's Winter
Olympics on Friday and applauded what he said is an unprecedented level
of cooperation among national, state and local law enforcement agencies
assigned to keep the Games free of terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   "I expect this to be a safe Olympics," Ashcroft told reporters shortly
after receiving separate security briefings from the Salt Lake Organizing
Committee and law enforcement officials.</LD>
<LD>   "We're not only doing as well as anything that's been done before, but
what's happening here has never happened before," he said. "This will set
a new standard, a model of [interagency] cooperation and integration."</LD>
<TE>   Since the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, the
federal government has contributed an additional $55 million to the
Olympics security budget, increasing it to $300 million--three times the
amount spent on security for the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. Sixty
federal, state and local agencies will police the Salt Lake Games.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft indicated there have been no threats directed at the 17-day
event, which begins Feb. 8.</TE>
<TE>   "If there are credible threats, we will share those with the public,
with the view of minimizing the risks," Ashcroft said.</TE>
<TE>   His aides said he will inspect and fine-tune security measures at each
of the 11 sports venues spread throughout the Salt Lake City region. He
will also visit the various law enforcement command posts.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankly, I intend to be very thorough," Ashcroft said. "I believe
this is among the most important security concerns we have."</TE>
<TE>   His tour Friday began in a driving snowstorm, leading him to remark on
its "champagne powder" qualities before adding, "I'm not sure champagne
is that popular here." Utah's population is dominated by Mormons, who
generally avoid alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   "People will look back at the Salt Lake Olympics and say what a
wonderful time it was," said Ashcroft. "The greatest snow on Earth will
become the greatest show on Earth."</TE>
<TE>   The attorney general arrived Thursday night and will leave Tuesday.
Verdi White, deputy commissioner of the state Department of Public
Safety, said he was glad Ashcroft came to visit.</TE>
<TE>   "It's great for him to see firsthand how we are using the resources
that the federal government has provided us," White said. "He's going to
see a level of integration and cooperation that we've never before seen
in Utah."</TE>
<TE>   Homeland Security Director Thomas J. Ridge also visited earlier this
month to express confidence in the safety of the Games. "I believe one of
the safest places on the globe from the beginning to the end of February
will be Salt Lake City."</TE>

<HD>Buying Toll Lanes Might Be Way to Go</HD>
<DH>Transit: After this week's $4-million payout, OCTA officials say
they'd rather buy the tollway than be hit up again for right to improve
the 91.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After agreeing to pay $4 million in public funds to a private
toll-lane operator for the right to widen the traffic-clogged Riverside
Freeway, Orange County transportation leaders now say they must buy the
tollway or risk being nickeled and dimed for years to come.</LD>
<LD>   The Orange County Transportation Authority board agreed this week to
pay the $4 million to the owners of the 91 Express Lanes for the right to
improve a 1,000-yard stretch of the freeway where traffic bottlenecks
just east of Coal Canyon Road.</LD>
<LD>   The owners of the toll lanes--which run down the middle of the freeway
for 10 miles--have the state-granted power to challenge improvements to
the Riverside Freeway or be compensated for the possible loss of paying
customers.</LD>
<TE>   Even though they agreed to the $4-million payout, OCTA officials say
they'd rather buy the entire toll operation than spend millions each time
they want to reduce congestion on one of the busiest state highways in
Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   "There's the frustration of having to shell out money whenever we need
to make an improvement," said Cypress City Councilman Tim Keenan, vice
chairman of the OCTA board. "If we could get control of the Express
Lanes, the dominoes would fall."</TE>
<TE>   Transportation officials face a similar situation in other areas of
Orange County, where OCTA could be forced to compensate operators of the
Eastern, Foothill and San Joaquin Hills toll roads. The Transportation
Corridor Agencies, which oversees the operation of these turnpikes, also
has a protection clause that could force OCTA to pay for the right to
improve freeways near the toll roads.</TE>
<TE>   The $4-million payment to owners of the 91 Express Lanes marks the
first time such a compensation clause has been exercised. Keenan and his
OCTA colleagues say the only way to avoid more payments is to purchase
the tollway.</TE>
<TE>   Although OCTA has no immediate plans for widening the freeway,
authority officials say there is the potential for future projects
because of the region's explosive population growth, particularly in the
Inland Empire.</TE>
<TE>   Standing in the way, however, is the 30-year franchise agreement
between Caltrans and the California Private Transportation Co., the owner
of the turnpike.</TE>
<TE>   The contract grants the Express Lanes the right to veto freeway
improvements and new road construction if those projects threaten to take
away motorists, who pay up to $8 for a round-trip during rush hour. The
agreement covers 30 miles of the Riverside Freeway from the Los
Angeles-Orange county line to Interstate 15.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the tollway say that without protections from
competition, no private company would have been willing to build the
Express Lanes.</TE>
<TE>   The same reasoning is behind franchise agreements with the TCA--a
governmental body that operates 51 miles of toll roads. Although the
agency does not have veto power over nearby highway projects, it must be
compensated for potential losses of business.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA officials say the agency's agreement might force OCTA to hand
over tax dollars just for the right to undertake five chunks of roadwork
along the San Diego and Santa Ana freeways.</TE>
<TE>   Of the two tollway systems, the most controversial agreement involves
the 91 Express Lanes, which opened in 1996. Although the four-lane
turnpike has provided some relief to motorists, critics say it is a
stumbling block for future attempts to reduce congestion.</TE>
<TE>   Riverside County has gone to court to overturn the tollway's
protection agreement with the state. The lawsuit, which could go to trial
later this year, claims the agreement is unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   On a second front, OCTA is trying to buy the lanes to regain
government control of the Riverside Freeway. Negotiations are set to
begin in the weeks ahead and price will be a key factor. There has been
speculation that the lanes are worth $200 million to $300 million. They
were built for $135 million.</TE>
<TE>   For now, the only way for a public agency to get around the agreement
is to compensate the owners of the Express Lanes for customers who might
shift to the free lanes if traffic conditions are improved.</TE>
<TE>   For OCTA's current bottleneck project, authority and Express Lanes
engineers calculated what they thought would be the potential loss in
tollway traffic from adding a sixth lane on the westbound side of the
highway. The lane would extend 1,000 yards east of Coal Canyon Road.</TE>
<TE>   After negotiations, they settled on a $4-million loss in business for
the tollway. The total cost of the project, including the payment, is
about $12 million.</TE>
<TE>   "This is proving to be a very costly way to go," said Riverside County
Supervisor Bob Buster, an opponent of the Express Lanes. "To have an
impact on the 91, OCTA has to either purchase the lanes or buy back the
franchise bit by bit."</TE>
<TE>   Buster said Orange County should consider joining the Riverside
lawsuit or at least monitor its progress before making a commitment to
buying the turnpike. If Riverside County prevails, Buster believes the
purchase price might be far lower than what Orange County is able to
negotiate.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA officials say there is a good possibility of closing a deal if
buying the lanes turns out to be cheaper and more effective than doing a
series of small projects to relieve congestion. They also say the lawsuit
could take five to 10 years to resolve.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA board Chairman Todd Spitzer, who is also a county supervisor,
contends the authority has considerable leverage against the Express
Lanes to keep the asking price down. Pressure is coming from Riverside's
lawsuit, he said, as well as from anti-toll road sentiment and a proposal
to build a highway through the Cleveland National Forest to better
connect the counties.</TE>
<TE>   "We have the clout to get them to the table," Spitzer said. "We are
not going to be taken by these folks. I'll be first to walk away if they
are going to exploit us."</TE>
<TE>   Although they are willing to discuss a possible sale with OCTA, the
managers of the Express Lanes contend the cheapest and quickest way to
improve the freeway is to extend their pay road into Riverside County.
They say they are also willing to negotiate other highway projects that
could further relieve congestion on the Riverside Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   For the lane addition, "We were able to reach a compromise that
everyone is happy with," said Greg Hulsizer, general manager of the
Express Lanes. "The $4-million payment recognizes the importance of our
franchise and the need to make improvements to the 91."</TE>

<HD>O.C. Considers Buying Tollway to Escape Payments to Operator</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After agreeing to pay $4 million to a private toll lane operator,
Orange County transportation leaders now say they must buy the toll lanes
or risk paying millions each time they want to improve the chronically
congested Riverside Freeway.</LD>
<LD>   The Orange County Transportation Authority board agreed this week to
pay the $4 million in public funds to the owners of the 91 Express Lanes
for the right to improve a 1,000-yard stretch of freeway where traffic
bottlenecks just east of Coal Canyon Road.</LD>
<LD>   The owners of the toll lanes, which run down the center of the freeway
for 10 miles, have the state-granted power to challenge improvements to
the Riverside Freeway or be compensated for the possible loss of
customers.</LD>
<TE>   Even though they agreed to the $4-million payout, OCTA officials say
they'd rather buy the entire toll operation than spend seven figures each
time just for the right to reduce congestion on one of the busiest state
highways in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   "There's the frustration of having to shell out money whenever we need
to make an improvement," said Cypress City Councilman Tim Keenan, vice
chairman of the OCTA board. "If we could get control of the Express
Lanes, the dominoes would fall."</TE>
<TE>   Transportation officials face a similar situation in other areas of
Orange County, where OCTA could be forced to compensate operators of the
Eastern, the Foothill and the San Joaquin Hills toll roads. The
Transportation Corridor Agencies, which oversees the operation of all
three turnpikes, also has a protection clause that could force the OCTA
to pay for the right to improve freeways near the tollways.</TE>
<TE>   The $4-million payment to owners of the 91 Express Lanes marks the
first time such a compensation clause has been exercised. Keenan and his
OCTA colleagues say the only way to avoid such payouts in the future is
to purchase the tollway.</TE>
<TE>   Although OCTA has no other immediate plans for widening the freeway,
its officials say there is the potential for other projects in the future
because of the region's explosive population growth, particularly in the
Inland Empire.</TE>
<TE>   Standing in the way, however, is the 30-year franchise agreement
between Caltrans and the California Private Transportation Co., owner of
the turnpike.</TE>
<TE>   The contract grants the Express Lanes the right to veto freeway
improvements and new road construction if those projects threaten to take
away motorists, who pay up to $8 for a round-trip during rush hour. The
agreement covers 30 miles of the Riverside Freeway from the Los
Angeles-Orange county line to Interstate 15.</TE>
<TE>   Managers of the Express Lanes say that they're willing to discuss a
sale, but that the cheapest and quickest way to improve the Riverside
Freeway is to extend their pay road into Riverside County. They say they
are also willing to negotiate other highway projects that could further
relieve congestion.</TE>
<TE>   For the lane addition, "we were able to reach a compromise that
everyone is happy with," said Greg Hulsizer, general manager of the
Express Lanes. "The $4-million payments recognize the importance of our
franchise and the need to make improvements to the 91."</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the tollway say that without protections from
competition, no private company would have been willing to build the
Express Lanes.</TE>
<TE>   The same reasoning is behind franchise agreements with the
Transportation Corridor Agencies, a governmental body that operates 51
miles of toll roads. While it does not have veto power over nearby
highway projects, the agency must be compensated for potential losses of
business.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA officials say the transportation agency agreement might force
them to hand over tax dollars just for the right to undertake five
roadwork projects along the San Diego and Santa Ana freeways.</TE>
<TE>   Of the two tollway systems, the most controversial agreement involves
the 91 Express Lanes, which opened in 1996. Although the four-lane
turnpike has provided some relief to motorists, critics say it is a
stumbling block for future attempts to reduce congestion.</TE>
<TE>   Riverside County has gone to court in an attempt to overturn the
tollway's protection agreement with the state. The lawsuit, which could
go to trial later this year, claims that the agreement is
unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   On a second front, OCTA is trying to buy the lanes to regain
government control of the Riverside Freeway. Negotiations are set to
begin in the weeks ahead and price will be a key factor. There has been
some speculation that the lanes are worth $200 million to $300 million.
They were built for $135 million.</TE>
<TE>   For now, the only way for a public agency to get around the agreement
is to compensate the owners of the Express Lanes for toll-lane customers
who might shift to the free lanes if congestion is eased.</TE>
<TE>   For OCTA's current bottleneck project, authority and Express Lanes
engineers calculated what they thought would be the potential loss in
tollway traffic from adding a sixth lane on the westbound side of the
highway. The lane would extend 1,000 yards east of Coal Canyon Road.</TE>

<HD>Plan to Remove Principal Plays Up District Dilemma</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SOLOMON MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Roosevelt High School Principal Henry Ronquillo had toyed with the
idea of retiring for years. His family life tugged at him--and so did the
fairways.</LD>
<LD>   But Roosevelt had its own gravity. A school like Roosevelt--long a
port of entry for successive waves of immigrants--needs more than a
principal. It needs a face. For 18 years, Ronquillo was that--a
spokesman, an advocate, the unofficial "mayor of Boyle Heights," as some
called him.</LD>
<LD>   Recently, as Roosevelt's test scores plateaued, Los Angeles Unified
School District and state officials quietly moved to replace
Ronquillo--but not quietly enough. The principal learned about his
planned removal just as he finished negotiating with the district to
retire on his own terms.</LD>
<TE>   State auditors said Ronquillo's administration did not observe
classroom instruction frequently enough and failed to institute
schoolwide plans to improve reading and writing.</TE>
<TE>   The affair has tarnished Ronquillo's reputation and has complicated
district efforts to remove him while allowing him to save face. It is
also a reminder of one of the difficulties that awaits the district as it
embarks on an ambitious restructuring plan for Roosevelt and nine other
under-performing schools: Replacing longtime administrators, many of whom
have become darlings of their communities, has considerable pitfalls. The
removal of figures like Ronquillo is the kind of drastic staff change
that L.A. Unified has been reluctant to make in the past, fearing
protests from administrators and teachers unions.</TE>
<TE>   Said district Supt. Roy Romer, who removed principals at four other
high schools and middle schools on the list of under-performing campuses:
"This is a substantial change in the way we operate, and we need to bring
people along with us."</TE>
<TE>   While Ronquillo told a meeting of students, teachers and parents this
week that he was staying on, Romer said--and Ronquillo confirmed--that
the principal will leave Roosevelt by June and is helping to find his
successor.</TE>
<TE>   The district's moves at Roosevelt--which, with 5,100 students, is
consistently ranked as one of the nation's most heavily populated--have
bred skepticism and defiance among students and teachers. Some signed a
petition this week demanding the district keep Ronquillo in his job.</TE>
<TE>Students Had Planned to Walk Out in Protest</TE>
<TE>   Many students also were planning to walk out of classes in protest of
their principal's removal until Ronquillo announced over the school's
public-address system Thursday morning that the protest was canceled.</TE>
<TE>   Three days earlier, area Supt. Bonnie Rubio met with teachers about
state-mandated changes to the curriculum to promote literacy, and was
sharply criticized. Some teachers said they were furious with Roosevelt's
inclusion in the list of 10 under-performing schools.</TE>
<TE>   "We chewed that woman out," said Will Adams, a Japanese-language
teacher. "We told her that we were already meeting many of the benchmarks
the state set out for us."</TE>
<TE>   Other teachers said they complained that Rubio had not visited the
campus often enough to know what was needed. Rubio did not return several
calls made to her office for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever happens to Ronquillo, he will be remembered for his long
association with Roosevelt. He graduated from the school in 1954, when
Boyle Heights was a mix of Jewish, Japanese and Latino Americans.
Ronquillo still emphasizes Roosevelt's importance to immigration, calling
the Boyle Heights campus a "common thread" that has pulled 75 alumni back
to Roosevelt to teach.</TE>
<TE>   "What brought them back was the attachment, the pride in their
school," Ronquillo said in an interview last week.</TE>
<TE>   Even Ronquillo's critics say he has successfully cleaned up the
campus. Students say there are hardly any fights and graffiti is wiped
away within days. And the school sends more Latinos to college than any
other in the district.</TE>
<TE>   Yet even Ronquillo acknowledged that more needs to be done to improve
academic achievement. Most students enter Roosevelt reading below a
fourth-grade reading level; one-third still are learning to speak
English.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we should have been on that list" of 10 schools, he
said. "But the state is right, we didn't make adequate progress on
reading scores. We made progress but not enough." The district has
promised the state a variety of initiatives such as revamping curriculum
and retraining teachers.</TE>
<TE>   Ronquillo said Roosevelt's scores are low because students were
unprepared before they entered high school. "Why doesn't the state have a
middle school or elementary exam so they have to meet requirements before
they come here?" he demanded.</TE>
<TE>   Frustrated teachers say they had implemented some of the remedies
outlined by the recent audits--such as breaking Roosevelt up into smaller
units. Three years ago, Roosevelt had created several such "houses"--or
schools within the school--each with 120 students and four teachers.</TE>
<TE>   "The house teachers met one period every day to discuss kids'
problems," said Cheryl Smith, a literacy coach at Roosevelt. "They
couldn't slip through the cracks."</TE>
<TE>   The program faltered, however, when the state imposed new
teacher-student ratios. The house program had 30 students to each
teacher. The state mandated a 20-to-1 ratio for some English classes,
disrupting the house schedule.</TE>
<TE>   "We just didn't have the teachers or the resources," said Ronquillo.
"If we had been able to keep the houses the state probably wouldn't be
looking at us now."</TE>
<TE>Critics Say Ronquillo Should Have Tried More</TE>
<TE>   Ronquillo's critics on campus said he should have worked harder to
maintain the houses that seemed to raise test scores and led to better
attendance rates. There still are several smaller programs in place, but
some teachers said they were not enough.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a lot of creative teachers," said teacher Ron Kendrick, "but
a leader would be able to pull them all together to form a strategic
plan."</TE>
<TE>   Another teacher who requested anonymity said Ronquillo's strengths
might not be suited to the job at hand.</TE>
<TE>   "In the past, a principal's been a kind of public relations
guy--someone who makes sure there is a warm and family atmosphere," said
the teacher. "Ronquillo has done that--but sometimes that's not enough."</TE>

<HD>Stepped-Up Baggage Screening Causes Few Problems</HD>
<DH>Security: Despite more stringent procedures, airline traffic moves
smoothly and delays are no worse than usual in most places.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Predicted logjams failed to materialize at airports in Southern
California and across the nation Friday as air traffic moved smoothly
despite the imposition of new baggage screening procedures.</LD>
<LD>   Lines at many airports were long, but in spite of the start of a
three-day holiday weekend, delays usually were no greater than they have
been since the September terrorist attacks. Most passengers had
anticipated delays and few missed their scheduled flights.</LD>
<LD>   Some travelers complained about the inconveniences imposed by
heightened security, but most accepted the changes with grace.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm not surprised and not a bit upset," said Gaylord Foreman, one of
the passengers who was selected at random for extra screening at John
Wayne Airport in Orange County. "I like knowing that I will get there in
one piece."</TE>
<TE>   That attitude would have pleased U.S. Transportation Secretary Norman
Y. Mineta.</TE>
<TE>   "I think in today's world, patience is a new form of patriotism,"
Mineta said Friday morning on CBS's "The Early Show."</TE>
<TE>   Under interim requirements that went fully into effect Friday,
airlines are using a combination of measures to screen checked baggage,
all prescribed by Congress after the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The basic screening technique, called bag matching, is intended to
ensure that no luggage gets into a cargo hold unless the passenger who
checked it is on the plane.</TE>
<TE>   If a passenger does not take a seat, his flight must be held until his
bags are pulled from the plane. By late Friday afternoon, there were no
reports of substantial delays caused by the procedure.</TE>
<TE>   But experts agree that "bag matching" is far from fail-safe. In many
cases, the bags of passengers who transfer to other flights will not be
rematched for each leg of the journey. Rep. James L. Oberstar (D-Minn.)
calls that gap an "Achilles' heel" of the security system.</TE>
<TE>   Bag matching also does not protect against suicide bombers willing to
step onto a plane after checking a bomb into the cargo hold.</TE>
<TE>   In compliance with the Friday deadline, more bags were being searched
by hand, by machines that can detect explosives and by specially trained
dogs, according to the airlines. But the carriers have kept their
procedures confidential and completed the checks in secure areas, outside
public view.</TE>
<TE>   The measures are said to be considerably more stringent than the
previous system, under which only a tiny proportion of bags checked on
domestic flights were screened for explosives.</TE>
<TE>   Mineta said the interim plan will remain in effect until Dec. 31, by
which time 429 U.S. airports must have sophisticated explosive-detection
equipment running to mechanically screen every piece of luggage.</TE>
<TE>   But many observers worry that deadline won't be met. U.S. Sen. Barbara
Boxer complained Friday that "bureaucratic foot-dragging" is delaying
installation of the machines.</TE>
<TE>   "Congress has already appropriated $3 billion for the purchase of
these scanners," the California Democrat said during a news conference at
Los Angeles International Airport. "But the Department of Transportation
has not entered into a contract with either of the two companies in the
United States that manufacture the machines . . .</TE>
<TE>   "They have the money," she said. "We need those machines."</TE>
<TE>   At LAX, several flights were delayed early Friday. But the new
security procedures weren't the problem; nasty winter weather in Chicago
was to blame.</TE>
<TE>   Concerned that the new screening laws would lead to longer lines,
Melba Harris arrived at LAX four hours early to fly home to Houston after
attending a seminar in Los Angeles. The 53-year-old independent school
administrator breezed through the line outside Terminal No. 1 in less
than 10 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "This is easy," she said.</TE>
<TE>Some Are Irritated at Security Screening</TE>
<TE>   At Burbank Airport, flights arrived and departed on schedule. Much of
the irritation that passengers felt was over screening at security
checkpoints that has been in place for weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Before boarding an 8:25 a.m. Southwest Airlines flight to San Jose,
Joan Francione had to endure two hand-wand searches by security
personnel. The agents rummaged through her bags and asked her to take off
her boots and jacket and spread her arms.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand what they're trying to do, but as far as stripping me in
front of all these strangers, I don't like that," said Francione, 64, of
Arcadia.</TE>
<TE>   Shirley Carroll, a bartender at the tavern next to the area where
travelers are checked by security screeners, said she has seen other
passengers placed in even more awkward positions.</TE>
<TE>   "Young girls who are into body piercing have a particularly hard
time," said Carroll, 47.</TE>
<TE>   As a contract security inspector sorting through carry-ons at
Southwest's Burbank gates, Akop Semerdzhvan received the brunt of
travelers' frustrations Friday.</TE>
<TE>   To the sound of sighs, curses and grumpy mumblings, he unzipped bags
full of baby bottles, college sweatshirts, undergarments and toiletries.</TE>
<TE>   Extra scrutiny often is assigned randomly by computers, not by
security personnel, Semerdzhvan said. Many travelers become offended
anyway, he said, complaining that the screeners think they look like
terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   However, most travelers Friday were philosophical. At John Wayne
Airport, Eric Leyrer was checking in for a flight to Ohio when he was
asked to take his bag to an inspection table.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes you have to give up some civil liberties for safety,"
Leyrer said.</TE>
<TE>   At Ontario International Airport, most departures were on time, with a
handful of arrivals 10 to 15 minutes behind schedule.</TE>
<TE>   One Southwest Airlines flight that originated in Hartford, Conn.,
pulled in 85 minutes late after the plane was diverted to Oklahoma City
to let off an ill passenger and remove his luggage.</TE>
<TE>   Some Southwest lines were long, including the one at Sacramento's
Metro Airport, but in general, the airline's operations were going well,
Southwest spokeswoman Linda Rutherford said.</TE>
<TE>Airline Reports Little Trouble</TE>
<TE>   Some travelers had feared the carrier might be particularly hobbled
because of its frequent short-haul flights and fast turnaround times at
airports.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been surveying our stations [airports] almost hourly," and the
"implementation of these new procedures has been very smooth," Rutherford
said. Other airlines said their operations generally were trouble-free
too.</TE>
<TE>   At Baltimore-Washington International Airport in Maryland, the lines
Friday were a bit longer than usual, but not much.</TE>
<TE>   Passengers traveling on American, Delta and US Airways around midday
faced the longest waits--up to 60 minutes in queues that twisted into
long switchbacks and extended around a corner into a waiting area.</TE>
<TE>   At Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport in Georgia, things were no
busier than normal.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody at work said 'you'd better go now, you'd better go now,' "
said frequent flier Lonna Mathison, 39, of Minneapolis. "But the lines
were nothing unusual for this time of day."</TE>

<HD>Jurists Vote to Overturn Davis' Veto of Parole</HD>
<DH>Prisons: Ruling that the governor exceeded his authority opens the
door to challenges by more than 40 inmates.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A state appeals court ruled Friday that Gov. Gray Davis does not
have absolute power to overturn a parole recommendation made by the state
Board of Prison Terms.</LD>
<LD>   The court held 2 to 1 that Davis exceeded his authority in rejecting
the board's recommendation to release Robert Rosenkrantz, who has been
imprisoned 15 years for second-degree murder.</LD>
<LD>   Davis' attorneys had contended that under Proposition 89, passed by
California voters in 1988, the governor had veto power over board
decisions.</LD>
<TE>   "The flaw in the governor's argument [is] the assumption that, in
adopting Proposition 89, the voters elevated the governor's authority to
review parole decisions to an absolute and unreviewable height," Justice
Miriam A. Vogel of the 2nd District Court of Appeal wrote for the
majority. "There is no support for the governor's assumption."</TE>
<TE>   The majority upheld a June ruling by Van Nuys Superior Court Judge
Paul Gutman that Davis had unlawfully denied parole to Rosenkrantz, who
is incarcerated at the California Men's Colony in San Luis Obispo. Gutman
said the governor had shown no evidence that Rosenkrantz represents a
continuing threat to society, and ordered him freed immediately.</TE>
<TE>   Rosenkrantz's release, however, was stayed by the California Supreme
Court pending appeal. On Friday, his attorneys said they expect the stay
to remain in effect while the governor's lawyers appeal to the state high
court.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tremendous victory for Mr. Rosenkrantz and a minor miracle for
prisoner litigation," said Donald Specter, director of the Prison Law
Office in San Rafael. "You have a prisoner suing the governor on a parole
matter, a very difficult case. . . . The court completely and utterly
rejected the governor's assertion that he is a law unto himself in this
area."</TE>
<TE>   Specter said the decision means that more than 40 other inmates whom
Davis refused to parole, despite a favorable recommendations from the
state Board of Prison Terms, can challenge those decisions in court.</TE>
<TE>   Robert D. Wilson, a deputy attorney general who represented the state,
said that he was disappointed with the ruling and that he would seek a
review from the California Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the majority's opinion does what we have been arguing against
all along: It denies the governor his constitutional authority to decide
whether a convicted murderer is safe to be released back into the
community."</TE>
<TE>   Rosenkrantz, 34, was convicted in the 1985 killing of schoolmate
Steven Redman, who exposed him as a homosexual on graduation night.
Fearful that his father would disown him after learning of his sexual
orientation, Rosenkrantz confronted Redman, demanding that he retract his
statement. When Redman refused, Rosenkrantz shot him 10 times with an Uzi
submachine gun outside Redman's Malibu residence.</TE>
<TE>   Sentenced to 17 years, Rosenkrantz has maintained a spotless
disciplinary record in prison, while earning a college degree and
tutoring other inmates. Prison psychiatrists have said there is a low
risk that he will commit other crimes if released.</TE>
<TE>   But in October 2000, Davis spurned parole, saying Rosenkrantz still
poses "a significant risk of danger to society."</TE>
<TE>   That decision has been cited by Davis' critics as the prime example of
what they contend is an unjust, inhumane parole policy.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after he became governor in 1999, Davis said he would take a
rigid position when considering parole applications from murderers.</TE>
<TE>   "If you take someone else's life, forget it," he said in a 1999
interview with The Times.</TE>
<TE>   Davis remained implacable Friday. "Mr. Rosenkrantz committed a heinous
act, pumping 10 rounds from an Uzi into his victim at close range--the
last three while he was lying helplessly on the ground," the governor
said in a statement released from his Sacramento office.</TE>
<TE>   Since Davis has been in office, the Board of Prison Terms has denied
about 99% of the 4,800 parole applications it has received. It has
recommended that 48 inmates be granted parole and Davis has rejected all
but one of those recommendations.</TE>
<TE>   Gutman ruled last June that in effect Davis had a no-parole policy for
murderers and that the application of the policy violated Rosenkrantz's
due process rights.</TE>
<TE>   That conclusion was challenged by the California attorney general's
office, representing Davis on appeal.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, only Justice Reuben A. Ortega sided with the governor. "The
record fails to support a finding that the governor has a no-parole
policy for murderers that deprived Rosenkrantz of due process," Ortega
wrote in dissent.</TE>
<TE>   In the majority opinion, Vogel, joined by Justice Robert M. Mallano,
said it was not necessary to reach a decision on whether Davis has a
no-parole policy. However, Vogel wrote a separate opinion in response to
Ortega's dissent and said the record was clear that Davis does have a
no-parole policy.</TE>
<TE>   "Rosenkrantz's due process rights include the right to 'individualized
treatment' and 'due consideration' of all relevant factors, and the
governor's decision cannot stand if it was made without due regard to the
appropriate post-conviction, as well as pre-conviction, factors," Vogel
wrote.</TE>
<TE>   He said Davis had no evidence to support his conclusions that
Rosenkrantz did not commit the murder "under stress significant enough to
offset the serious nature of the crime." Davis also said Rosenkrantz
continues to lie about aspects of the crime and his excellent prison
record "is no more than that which the state . . . expects of all
prisoners."</TE>
<TE>   Those conclusions, Vogel wrote, are an affront not only to
Rosenkrantz, whose progress in prison was "undisputedly exemplary, but
also to the Department of Corrections," which provided the programs in
which Rosenkrantz participated. Vogel said "the governor's readiness to
make a decision so at odds with the record supports Rosenkrantz's claim
and the Superior Court's finding that the governor does in fact have a
no-parole policy."</TE>
<TE>   Rosenkrantz's other lawyer, Rowan Klein of Los Angeles, said, "I'm
gratified for the victory. It demonstrates that even the governor is not
above the law."</TE>

<HD>Unions Reluctantly Endorse Reforms at Problem Schools</HD>
<DH>Education: Leaders of L.A. Unified teachers, administrators groups
urge the district to act carefully in its effort to improve 10 campuses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DOUG SMITH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A hastily launched program to turn around 10 under-performing Los
Angeles city schools is angering some union members, who warn that the
district will face labor strife if it does not proceed carefully.</LD>
<LD>   Despite their protests, however, leaders of the teachers and
administrators unions have tentatively endorsed the reform plans
submitted to the state Friday. They mostly fault the district for seeking
quick solutions to problems that they say have been ignored for years.</LD>
<LD>   The district has promised the state a variety of initiatives, such as
revamping curriculum and retraining teachers.</LD>
<TE>   "We're not fighting it," said Eli Brent, president of Associated
Administrators of Los Angeles, the union of 2,300 school administrators.
"We're supporting anything that will help kids to learn."</TE>
<TE>   Although leaders of the 43,000-member teachers union also are
extending wary support, some hard-line members say the plans impinge on
the teachers' contract and should be formally negotiated.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope this does not blow up, that the district will sit down with
us," said Mike Cherry, a vice president of United Teachers-Los Angeles,
which shut the district down in a 1989 strike and threatened a strike
last year to gain a pay increase averaging more than 15%. "If not, I do
see a fight."</TE>
<TE>   The reform plans were prompted by state audits that found the 10
schools substandard in academics, as well as health and safety.
Principals at about half of the schools are being transferred, demoted or
forced into retirement. So far, one teacher has been transferred, and
district officials said other teacher transfers are being considered.</TE>
<TE>   Already, the district's reforms have resulted in the filing of one
grievance by a teacher. Union officials said they are prohibited from
discussing individual cases, but they pledge to fight any staff changes
that violate contract requirements.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll go to the full extent of our legal right to make sure our
members are treated fairly in all these situations," said UTLA President
Day Higuchi.</TE>
<TE>   The agreements for the 10 schools put both unions in the delicate
position of trying to balance their oft-repeated support for reform with
their traditional role in protecting members' rights. Some of the
provisions require significant concessions from teachers, for example,
forcing them to change the way they teach or adding days to the school
year for professional development.</TE>
<TE>   The dilemma hits the teachers union at a particularly sensitive time.
UTLA is in the final stages of an election for new officers. The first
round of voting for four candidates who are seeking to succeed Higuchi is
next month.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a huge issue," said Joshua Peshtalt, an English teacher at
Manual Arts High School who writes an opposition newsletter that is
supporting a hard-line candidate for president.</TE>
<TE>   Peshtalt dismisses the state audits and the district's follow-up as
"scapegoating for much more serious problems the state has been unwilling
to address, such as funding and class size."</TE>
<TE>   Current UTLA leaders, who have long been pushing their own version of
reform, are still miffed that the district never pursued a similar
proposal that they made jointly with the administrators several years
ago. It would have created intervention teams of teachers and
administrators to shape up troubled schools.</TE>
<TE>   "Had we been engaged in a cooperative effort with the schools that are
showing signs of stress, we wouldn't be looking at these 10 schools now,"
Higuchi said.</TE>
<TE>   His counterpart at the administrators union had the same complaint.</TE>
<TE>   "The part that hurts us, that is disappointing and almost insulting,
is that we have been alerting the district as to schools that need help,
and nothing has been done," Brent said.</TE>
<TE>   Supt. Roy Romer said he consulted the unions in shaping the plans and
believes he can count on continued support.</TE>
<TE>   "I expect the unions to be cooperative in this because this is what we
need to make the schools better," he said.</TE>
<TE>   State and national teachers union leaders are watching the reforms in
Los Angeles as a precursor of actions soon to come to other districts
under California's school accountability plan and the new national law
requiring standardized testing and evidence of improvement in every
state.</TE>
<TE>   Past efforts at such radical reform have often turned out badly, they
said, because schools were overhauled too fast, with inadequate
follow-up.</TE>
<TE>   Wayne Johnson, president of the California Teachers Assn., said the
Los Angeles reforms look "arbitrary and egregious" to him.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't look like there has been a major effort to sit down with
the teachers and say, 'What is wrong here and how can we work together to
fix it?' " said Johnson, who, as former UTLA president, led the union
through the 1989 strike.</TE>
<TE>   Sandra Feldman, president of the American Federation of Teachers, is
reserving judgment. She has spoken out in favor of school redesign, but
said, "It's very hard to do it right. You have to involve all the
constituencies, be sure that people get all the information that's
available and that they feel involved in being part of the solution."</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, representatives of both unions sat in on the talks as
the agreements were drafted and made suggestions.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement for Mt. Vernon Middle School originally required all
teachers to reapply for their jobs or be transferred. Based on UTLA's
objection, the final language reads that the teachers must sign a
"commitment letter."</TE>
<TE>   But there were no formal negotiations, and the unions did not sign off
on the documents.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Romer acknowledged that some of the provisions
probably conflict with elements of the unions' contract and must be
negotiated.</TE>
<TE>   He said he expects the unions to cooperate because their leaders know
that the actions are necessary to avoid more drastic reforms, such as
breaking up the district.</TE>
<TE>   "If we don't improve, we're out of here," he said, "us and the
unions."</TE>

<HD>Hoffman, Parks Trade Accusations at Forum</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Roughing each other up over housing, campaign contributions and who
is the better leader, Thousand Oaks supervisorial candidates Randy
Hoffman and Linda Parks faced off for the first time Friday at a business
forum.</LD>
<LD>   The candidates used the hourlong session to make a case for why they
should succeed retiring Supervisor Frank Schillo, whose 2nd District
includes the Conejo Valley and Point Mugu.</LD>
<LD>   Before a receptive audience at the Thousand Oaks-Westlake Village
Regional Chamber of Commerce, Hoffman, 48, emphasized what he called his
ability to bring people together and his background as founder of a
successful technology company.</LD>
<TE>   He portrayed Parks as a divisive naysayer known more for identifying
problems than developing solutions.</TE>
<TE>   Parks, 44, meanwhile, called herself a grass-roots leader whose
slow-growth credentials are well known. The Thousand Oaks councilwoman
criticized Hoffman as a rich man with no real record who is trying to buy
the election with help from well-to-do backers.</TE>
<TE>   The primary election is March 5. Parks and Hoffman are the only
competitors, so the ballot will determine who succeeds Schillo in January
2003.</TE>
<TE>   The candidates didn't hold back as they attempted to portray
themselves in the most flattering light--and their competitor as unworthy
of voters' support.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman accused Parks of being a hypocrite for criticizing his
donations after she had unsuccessfully solicited money from many of the
same wealthy contributors.</TE>
<TE>   "My opponent solicited [businessman] David Murdock and [financier]
Bill Dallas," said Hoffman, who has raised $152,000 to finance his
campaign compared with Parks' $64,000. "She solicited almost all of my
contributors."</TE>
<TE>   Parks, who has pledged not to accept any money from developers, denied
seeking contributions from Murdock--builder of the luxury Lake Sherwood
estates.</TE>
<TE>   Parks agreed she had called Dallas seeking financial support but said
she would not have accepted more than $500--her voluntary contribution
limit--if he had agreed.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas turned her down, giving $25,000 to Hoffman instead.</TE>
<TE>   Murdock, Hoffman's biggest backer, has given the businessman $66,000.</TE>
<TE>   Parks delivered her own blows, condemning Hoffman for implying that
people who can't afford to live in Ventura County should go somewhere
else.</TE>
<TE>   That exchange came as the candidates answered a question on how they
would address the county's lack of affordable housing.</TE>
<TE>Where to Put Housing Projects</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman agreed more housing is needed but said it should not be built
if it means more traffic, pollution and crowding.</TE>
<TE>   "If it affects our quality of life it has to go elsewhere," Hoffman
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Put [housing] elsewhere?" Parks shot back. "I suppose if you can
afford to live in North Ranch and send your kids to private school . . .
that's OK. But telling someone to move if they can't afford to live here
is not the right answer."</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman later clarified his comment, saying he opposes runaway
development but not housing aimed specifically at low-income families.</TE>
<TE>   On other areas the candidates agreed, both saying they would work to
protect the county's farmland, open spaces and ridgelines.</TE>
<TE>   Both emphasized they would make public safety a priority for county
government funding.</TE>
<TE>   When questioned about a union push to make benefits enjoyed by spouses
of government employees available to domestic partners, both said they
would oppose it.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman, however, repeatedly said he is a "clear choice" from Parks
because he would solve problems in a collaborative fashion.</TE>
<TE>   His competitor is known for combative politics, Hoffman said.</TE>
<TE>   "My opponent's reputation for divisiveness and personal attacks are
very well-documented," he said. "Most people that have come into contact
with her are endorsing me because I am a consensus-builder."</TE>
<TE>   Parks, meanwhile, called Hoffman untrustworthy.</TE>
<TE>   He is cloaking himself as a slow-growth champion with no record to
back it up, Parks said.</TE>
<TE>   Parks accused Hoffman's campaign manager, Joel Angeles, of following
her around and snapping photos that she said will be used in attack ads
later in the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "The comments you are going to hear are going to be an incredible
attack," Parks said.</TE>
<TE>   Angeles later said he had never taken a picture of Parks until Friday,
when he snapped shots at the candidates' forum. He declined to discuss
Hoffman's campaign strategy.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether or not we will go negative, I can't really answer that," he
said.</TE>

<HD>UC Irvine Suspends Beta Theta Pi for Two Years Over Alleged Hazing</HD>
<DH>Education: The fraternity and 13 members have been sued by a
student who says he suffered a seizure after abuse in December 2000.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF GOTTLIEB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>UC Irvine on Friday suspended a fraternity for two years for
violating policies against hazing and serving alcohol to minors. It's the
first time since the school opened in 1965 that UCI has revoked
recognition of a student group.</LD>
<LD>   The discipline was handed down seven weeks after a student sued Beta
Theta Pi and 13 of its members, saying he suffered a grand mal seizure
and was hospitalized after a weekend of hazing in Big Bear.</LD>
<LD>   Jeff Warden contends in his suit and in an interview that he was made
to exercise in freezing temperatures and had beer forced down his throat
while being subjected to continuous verbal abuse during initiation in
December 2000.</LD>
<TE>   Along with the fraternity suspension, nine Beta Theta Pi students
present during the hazing have been disciplined. Randy Lewis, executive
associate dean of students, said none of them were expelled, but he would
not provide details. Their names were not released.</TE>
<TE>   The students who led the hazing have graduated or left the university
for reasons unrelated to the incident, Lewis said.</TE>
<TE>   David J. Salvin, Warden's attorney, said that though he and his client
are pleased the university had found wrongdoing, they are disappointed
that the fraternity was not banned from campus permanently.</TE>
<TE>   The fraternity's national headquarters in Oxford, Ohio, already had
suspended the chapter. Tom Olver, spokesman for the national office, said
the fraternity could take its own final action soon--including revoking
the charter--perhaps at this weekend's board of trustees meeting in
Denver.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always unfortunate when the actions of one member or several
members of any chapter causes a university to revoke recognition," Olver
said. "Beta Theta Pi's policy is not to challenge a university's decision
to revoke recognition if there is good reason. I think we would welcome
the opportunity to return in two years."</TE>
<TE>   Edwin Steen, president of the UCI chapter, did not return phone calls.</TE>
<TE>   The California Education Code bans hazing, as do laws in more than 40
states. Nearly all fraternities and sororities prohibit the practice.
Still, incidents crop up each year across the country when students are
pledging.</TE>
<TE>   For example, just three days before Warden and the UCI chapter went to
Big Bear, San Diego State expelled its Beta Theta Pi chapter for forcing
four 18-year-olds to drink; one was hospitalized for alcohol poisoning.</TE>
<TE>   Warden's suit, filed in Orange County Superior Court, seeks
unspecified damages for assault, battery, intentional infliction of
emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress.</TE>
<TE>   Warden's suit also names 13 of the fraternity's 23 members; not all of
the members were present during the hazing, Lewis said.</TE>
<TE>   The Betas, which have been at UCI for 26 years, have a reputation as
one of the top fraternities academically and had the highest grade-point
average the last two quarters.</TE>
<TE>   Fraternity members do not live together.</TE>
<TE>   Warden, 20, said one reason he wanted to join the Betas was because
fraternity brothers assured him they did not haze.</TE>
<TE>   Warden, a sophomore film studies major from Colorado Springs, Colo.,
said he discovered differently the weekend of Dec. 8, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   He said he and two other pledges were told they were going to Big Bear
to snowboard. But once in the mountains, he said, he had beer forced down
his throat, was subjected to scores of push-ups and sit-ups and was
allowed little sleep.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, Warden said, he felt his field of vision narrowing. When
he awoke, he was in leg and arm restraints at Bear Valley Community
Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   He said he had suffered a grand mal seizure. He said fraternity
members and fellow pledges told him he had been foaming at the mouth and
his eyes had rolled back in his head.</TE>
<TE>   Warden said he had not had a seizure before and hasn't had one since.</TE>
<TE>   Tests at Bear Valley and at UCI Medical Center in Orange showed no
abnormalities.</TE>
<TE>   Before learning of Warden's charges, the university did not require
fraternities and sororities to take part in anti-hazing presentations.
Lewis said UCI is now planning seminars and other presentations. The
Warden incident "raises concern," he said. "It's one of those things we
have to keep hammering at."</TE>
<TE>   Beta Theta Pi can apply for UCI recognition after Jan. 1, 2004, if it
meets certain conditions. Among them is that none of the members
disciplined can associate with the chapter.</TE>

<HD>Both Tears, Smiles Honor an O.C. 'Marine's Marine' Killed in Crash</HD>
<DH>Remembrance: 'He was a mentor to us all,' said a fellow gunnery
sergeant of Stephen L. Bryson, who died when his plane went down in
Pakistan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE ANTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stephen L. Bryson died serving his country in the war on terrorism.
On Friday, the Marine Corps gunnery sergeant was remembered for that and
for his other roles: husband, son, brother and friend. And as a man who
embraced God throughout his 36 years.</LD>
<LD>   In a highly charged 2 1/2-hour service at Yorba Linda's Friendship
Baptist Church, Bryson's family, friends and fellow Marines described a
career military man who never feared death because he always tried to
live life to its fullest.</LD>
<LD>   "You made sure I knew how much you loved me every day. Not just with
presents, but with your presence," said Katrina Bryson, the high school
sweetheart from Alabama who became his wife.</LD>
<TE>   "You were everything I wished I could be," she said, quoting lyrics
from a Bette Midler song. "Now I can fly higher than an eagle. You are
the wind beneath my wings."</TE>
<TE>   Bryson and six other Marines were killed last week when their KC-130
Hercules slammed into a mountain in Pakistan while attempting to land.
The cause of the crash has yet to be determined.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, a somber ceremony for the dead was held at the Marine
Corps Air Station in Miramar, where their squadron was based.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's memorial for Bryson, who lived in Rancho Santa Margarita, was
somber as well. But the tears were mixed with laughter and inspiration. A
slide show documented Bryson's life, while the church choir in which he
had sung belted out gospel music that had the congregation of several
hundred on its feet, dancing and singing.</TE>
<TE>   "We know that he is with the Lord," said the Rev. James D. Carrington,
pastor of the church where Bryson was also on the board of trustees. "And
because he is with the Lord, we are going to have a good time."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm on the battlefield soldiering for the Lord," the choir sang.
Within minutes, three rows of stoic Marines in dress uniforms rose in
unison and began clapping too.</TE>
<TE>   Bryson's comrades remembered "Peabo," who joined the Marines in 1985
right out of high school, as a man of intelligence and integrity who was
quick to laugh but never angered.</TE>
<TE>   "He was the calmest in the eye of the storm," said Gunnery Sgt.
Michael Grace, who served with Bryson in Pakistan and Afghanistan.
"That's why he was a mentor to us all."</TE>
<TE>   Master Sgt. Terry O'Neil recalled awakening early one morning in
Afghanistan and looking over to see Bryson sitting on his cot, a Bible
open in his lap. He was quietly jotting notes.</TE>
<TE>   Bryson didn't openly push his faith, O'Neil said. Rather, he promoted
it by example.</TE>
<TE>   "He brought his faith and religion with him and he shared it with the
Marines that were out there," O'Neil said. "He had a leadership skill and
a leadership style that many Marines would like to aspire to. Stephen was
a Marine's Marine.</TE>
<TE>   "I miss him," he said, choking back tears. "To lose him . . . it's
hard."</TE>
<TE>   Maj. Floyd Means Jr. flew overnight from Japan to be at the service.
"There is nothing I wouldn't do for Stephen Bryson because there is
nothing he wouldn't do for me," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bryson was Means' video game competitor. He was the voice in his ear
during missions, providing answers to difficult questions. He and Katrina
introduced Means to his future wife.</TE>
<TE>   Once, Means found himself laboring most of a day to remove an exhaust
system from his car. Bryson came along, "and a within two seconds, he had
the answer," Means said.</TE>
<TE>   "Steve knew it all," he added. "And he gave it all freely."</TE>
<TE>   When Maj. Kolan Hairston went to Bryson's home to comfort his widow,
it was Katrina who ended up comforting him.</TE>
<TE>   "She explained to me how lucky we were to have Stephen for the time we
had," Hairston said. "He set the watermark for how we should live.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a Marine. But more than that, far more than that, he was a
dear friend."</TE>

<HD>2 More Bodies Found in Castaic Lake</HD>
<DH>Accident: A fourth man remains missing in the capsizing of a
speeding luxury boat during a test run Jan. 11.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KARIMA HAYNES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Divers pulled two bodies from Castaic Lake on Friday, but were
unable to retrieve the other body that has been missing since a
high-powered family boat capsized a week ago.</LD>
<LD>   Sheriff's Department officials identified the two recovered as Steve
Coulombe and Charles Wiseman. The body of Nelson Brinkman has not been
found. Ken Lane, 41, of La Crescenta, was found dead immediately after
the accident.</LD>
<LD>   Wiseman's body was retrieved Friday afternoon from an area about half
a mile from the wreckage and 250 feet beneath the surface. Coulombe's
body was recovered at 7:40 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   Gary Allen, vice president of Friends of Castaic and a close friend of
Wiseman, said he was with authorities when the discoveries were made.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a good day today," Allen said. "No more ifs, ands or buts.
Everybody's going to take a big sigh of relief tonight and get a good
night's sleep. It brings a little peace knowing everybody's going to be
recovered."</TE>
<TE>   The bodies were found with the aid of a robotic sonar device brought
from Canada to help a team of volunteer divers. Homicide detectives in
helicopters had tried to re-create the accident visually, working to
determine why the twin-engine speedboat flipped and sank.</TE>
<TE>   Friends and co-workers kept vigil on a bluff overlooking the lake
Friday as the divers made several attempts.</TE>
<TE>   Lane and Brinkman worked for Coulombe's Agua Dulce-based boat design
and manufacturing firm, High Torque Marine, and were experienced racers.</TE>
<TE>   They were testing the unfinished luxury craft when, witnesses say, it
tilted left and rolled over. Wiseman, a concrete subcontractor, was a
High Torque Marine customer and boat enthusiast.</TE>

<HD>Judge Overturns Firing of Officer Accused by Perez</HD>
<DH>LAPD: Humberto Tovar was the first to be terminated as a result of
the corruption probe. Court orders him reinstated.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has overturned the termination
of an LAPD officer who was implicated in police misconduct by corrupt
former Officer Rafael Perez, authorities said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Humberto Tovar, who was the first Los Angeles police officer fired as
a result of Perez's allegations of widespread corruption, is expected to
be reinstated within weeks, attorneys said.</LD>
<LD>   Tovar had appealed his August 2000 termination from the LAPD, alleging
that the evidence presented at his departmental disciplinary hearing did
not support a finding of guilt. He further alleged that Perez's testimony
was not credible and that the disciplinary panel acted improperly during
its deliberations.</LD>
<TE>   Last week Judge Dzintra Janavs ruled in favor of Tovar, ordering the
LAPD to reinstate him. The decision is expected to be formalized later
this month. Once reinstated, Tovar may face disciplinary hearings
relating to other acts of misconduct alleged by Perez.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department declined to comment
on the judge's decision.</TE>
<TE>   The case that led to Tovar's termination involved the March 1996 drug
arrest of Toby Semick, a suspected gang member.</TE>
<TE>   In interviews with investigators, Perez said he planted marijuana on
Semick to frame him. He said Tovar, his partner at the time, was aware of
what he was doing.</TE>
<TE>   "I made it very obvious to him that, you know, we're going to do
[Semick] for something," Perez told authorities. "We just couldn't figure
out what. Then later on, after we had gotten back to our car . . . I told
[Tovar] we were gonna plant marijuana on him."</TE>
<TE>   Perez testified to that version of events at Tovar's disciplinary
hearing. Semick also testified at the hearing that he was framed, but he
did not place Tovar at the scene, attorneys said.</TE>
<TE>   In his defense, Tovar testified at his hearing that the information in
Semick's arrest report was true.</TE>
<TE>   The captain who presided over the hearing said the fact that Perez was
a convicted felon and admitted perjurer did not mean he was "devoid of
any credibility."</TE>
<TE>   The captain and the two other members of the disciplinary panel said
they were unable to find a plausible motive for Perez to lie about
Tovar's involvement in the arrest, noting that each officer expressed
admiration for the other during his respective testimony and that there
was no evidence of animosity between them.</TE>
<TE>   The judge, however, cited concerns about credibility in overturning
Tovar's termination, attorneys in the case said.</TE>
<TE>   Perez agreed to identity officers he said were corrupt in exchange for
a five-year sentence on his cocaine theft conviction.</TE>
<TE>   In November, Perez entered into another agreement, this time with the
U.S. attorney, in which he pleaded guilty to charges stemming from the
shooting and framing of an unarmed gang member in exchange for two years
in federal prison.</TE>

<HD>A Role Model for Foster Teenagers</HD>
<DH>Services: Sabrina Biggs, who runs a youth advocacy group in Ventura
County, has won the respect of her superiors and the trust of her
charges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The pros advised her not to get too close to the kids. Help them
sort out their problems and go home, social service veterans cautioned.</LD>
<LD>   Sabrina Biggs never did listen.</LD>
<LD>   When she started an advocacy group for Ventura County foster teens two
years ago, her mentors were people who insisted on caring--and made a
difference.</LD>
<TE>   "All of my social workers when I was in foster care had a relationship
with me," Biggs said. "And that's what made me want to do good in life. I
try to project that onto my kids."</TE>
<TE>   As the county's liaison between foster care youths and the social
services bureaucracy, Biggs is making impressive strides.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County's chapter of the California Youth Connection has been
named the best in the state for two years running, beating out 23 others.
Run by foster teens, the organization lobbies for changes in laws to
benefit children who are being raised in foster care.</TE>
<TE>   Under Biggs' guidance, the Ventura group has grown to nearly 40
members--rivaling the chapter in much larger Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   The Ventura chapter will host a conference in April, drawing teenage
foster children from across the state. And most important, supporters
say, the 29-year-old Biggs has earned respect and trust from kids used to
eyeing anyone in authority with suspicion.</TE>
<TE>   Foster teens identify with Biggs because she knows first hand how
childhood abuse and betrayal can color a person's world, said 19-year-old
Heather Stubbs, who has been with the group from the start.</TE>
<TE>   "Her own experience with being in our shoes brings her on the same
level," Stubbs said. "She understands what we are going through better
than someone who's had a sheltered life."</TE>
<TE>   Biggs was 15 when she decided she could no longer shoulder caring for
herself and three younger brothers and sisters. Her mother was using
drugs and her father was in prison, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Here I was entering high school and I was the parent," she said. "No
matter how hard I tried, I couldn't keep things together. It just fell
apart. So I left. I didn't want that lifestyle."</TE>
<TE>   She bounced around to four foster homes before being taken in by a
sympathetic therapist. After high school, she began working as a
counselor at group homes where foster children are housed.</TE>
<TE>   Her enthusiasm caught the attention of Ventura County Human Services
Agency Director Barbara Fitzgerald, who was looking for someone to fill a
newly created position coordinating activities for foster teens.</TE>
<TE>   Though Biggs "hit the ground running," it hasn't all been upbeat,
Fitzgerald said.</TE>
<TE>   "She had some ups and downs," she said. "Some of the foster kids pull
through and are wonderful successes. Others have a much more difficult
time."</TE>
<TE>   Biggs gives the kids her pager and cell phone number so she can be
reached any time. She pleads with group home operators to bend rules so
teens can attend California Youth Connection meetings, which take place
at night when the homes restrict activities.</TE>
<TE>   And sometimes, all it takes is a well-timed hug, Biggs said.</TE>
<TE>   "You can feel how much they need love when they hug me," she said.
"That's what's making it successful--because it's real."</TE>
<TE>   Her latest project is raising enough money to send 10 foster teenagers
to Sacramento in the spring to meet with legislators and press their case
for changes in law. The trip will cost about $3,000 for all 10.</TE>
<TE>   The teens are worried that legislators might gut a new law that allows
foster care payments to continue through age 21, instead of 18, if youths
are going to college or learning a trade. Five teens traveled to the
Capitol last year and found it an empowering experience, Biggs said.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't want to complain, they want to solve problems," she said.
"They want to create an easier path for the younger ones so they don't go
through what they've gone through."</TE>
<TE>   Much like Biggs herself.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like I'm going to know them for a couple of years, and then
they're on their own," she said. "If they go away and come back, I will
be there."</TE>

<HD>Cahuenga Pass May Be Cut From City</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The head of the agency studying Valley cityhood recommended Friday
that Cahuenga Pass be removed from the proposed city's borders and that
there should be a nine-month delay in the start of any municipal
operations.</LD>
<LD>   Larry Calemine, executive director of the Local Agency Formation
Commission, made the recommendations in the first of a series of reports
outlining the terms and conditions of a municipal divorce.</LD>
<LD>   Many of the toughest issues, including the division of assets and
liabilities, remain unresolved in the report sent Friday to LAFCO for
consideration at its meeting Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   Calemine also recommended that a transition period for the new city be
cut to 19 months from the three years proposed by secessionists, and that
Los Angeles not be required to give a start-up loan to the new city.</TE>
<TE>   Calemine said Cahuenga Pass residents have requested to be removed
from the proposed Valley city, and proponents of a Hollywood city have
sought to include the area in their boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   "Fabulous," said Joan Luchs of the Cahuenga Pass Neighborhood Assn. "I
have always thought of the Cahuenga Pass as being the north end of
Hollywood."</TE>
<TE>   Calemine also recommended that the starting date of the new city be
delayed until July 1, 2003, to coincide with the start of Los Angeles'
fiscal year and thus avoid some cash-flow problems. If Valley secession
is placed before voters, officials expect the issue would appear on the
November ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Calemine's report also recommended that the secessionist group Valley
VOTE provide LAFCO with three choices for the name of the proposed city
by March 1 so they can be put on the ballot for a voter decision.</TE>
<TE>   Calemine plans additional reports, which will address assets and
liabilities, and revenue neutrality. His final report, due in April, will
recommend whether the issue should go before voters.</TE>

<HD>Political Map Redrawn for Independent Valley</HD>
<DH>Districts: New legislative boundaries for proposed municipality
avoid splitting communities, but irk some Latinos.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A revised plan for legislative districts in a potential San
Fernando Valley city released Friday avoids splitting some communities
and concentrates Latino voters.</LD>
<LD>   The first change satisfied North Hills residents, but the second was
not enough to avoid a probable legal challenge by the California Latino
Redistricting Caucus.</LD>
<LD>   Under the new maps, Warner Center would not be split between council
districts and most of Sherman Oaks would be moved into a single district.</LD>
<TE>   "That was probably the No. 1 issue discussed at the public hearing,"
said Richard Close, who is president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn.
and chairman of the secession group Valley VOTE.</TE>
<TE>   The plan also adjusted boundaries to eliminate an area of the Cahuenga
Pass that has been claimed by Hollywood secessionists for their proposed
city.</TE>
<TE>   The new boundaries make only slight changes in the Latino populations
of two districts.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the plan, like the original one released in November, creates
five council districts in which Latinos would be the majority of the
population and four districts in which they would be the most populous
ethnic group. There would be 14 districts in all.</TE>
<TE>   But Alan Clayton of the Latino Redistricting Caucus said the key test
is voting power, or Latino voter registration in each district. The draft
included majority Latino registration in three districts, while Clayton,
who hasn't yet reviewed the new plan, contends that four can be drawn.</TE>
<TE>   "If the plan is basically the same, we will obviously challenge it,"
Clayton said. A challenge would be filed with the U.S. Justice
Department.</TE>
<TE>   Clayton's alternative proposal to boost Latino voting in some
districts would have split the community of North Hills, where residents
vigorously oppose his plan, according to a redistricting report prepared
by demographics experts William A. V. Clark and Patrick D. Quinlan for
the Local Agency Formation Commission, the agency with the power to place
Valley cityhood before voters.</TE>
<TE>   "The plan has maintained voting rights and preserved community
boundaries to the extent possible," the report states.</TE>
<TE>   The new districts would average 96,500 people each but would vary in
size geographically.</TE>
<TE>   "The new districts map reveals a structure of districts that are
geographically smaller in the more densely populated neighborhoods and
communities in the eastern part of the San Fernando Valley, and are more
geographically extensive in the western parts of the Valley, where
single-family homes and lower densities predominate," the report states.</TE>
<TE>   LAFCO will consider the new map and plan at its meeting Wednesday.</TE>

<HD>City Rejects Offer to Settle Suit Over Sunshine Canyon</HD>
<DH>Dispute: At neighbors' request, council will look into health
concerns related to landfill expansion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles City Council on Friday rejected a settlement of a
lawsuit challenging the expansion of Sunshine Canyon Landfill, but agreed
to give further consideration to health concerns over the dump.</LD>
<LD>   The North Valley Coalition had offered to drop its lawsuit if the city
agreed to order a study of the dump's health implications for surrounding
neighborhoods. The residents also wanted the city to keep the dump 50
feet below a ridgeline in the portion that lies within Los Angeles, and
asked for an analysis of alternatives, such as taking trash to the desert
by rail.</LD>
<LD>   The council rejected the offer on a 10-3 vote, with Councilmen Hal
Bernson and Dennis Zine, who represent parts of the Valley, joined by
Councilman Nate Holden in favoring an agreement.</LD>
<TE>   "I was disappointed, but I won't say I was surprised," said Bernson,
adding that a majority of his colleagues rejected the same requests from
the coalition in 1999 when the council approved expansion of the landfill
into Granada Hills from an unincorporated area of the county.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been the trend of the council, not to care that much about
the San Fernando Valley," Bernson said.</TE>
<TE>   A Superior Court judge has dismissed the coalition's lawsuit, but it
has been appealed.</TE>
<TE>   The council authorized its attorneys to negotiate a counterproposal
that might offer more air-quality monitoring in the area, but such a deal
would fall far short of the comprehensive health study the coalition
requested. In approving the expansion in 1999, the council relied on a
university study that found no significant increases in cancer near
Valley landfills. At the time, the council agreed to monitor air quality
at nearby Van Gogh Street Elementary School.</TE>
<TE>   Arnie Berghoff, a spokesman for landfill operator Browning Ferris
Industries, said the council was right to reject the settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Coalition members "have lost in court, and they have minimal chance of
winning on appeal," Berghoff said. The council looked at health issues in
1999 and at alternative dumping locations, officials said. But Wayde
Hunter, president of the North Valley Coalition, said those analyses were
superficial.</TE>
<TE>   The current design for the landfill allows it to peak in 25 years just
above a ridgeline overlooking neighborhoods, but mostly keeps trash below
the ridgeline, Berghoff said. The coalition's demand to keep the landfill
50 feet below the ridgeline might jeopardize a design that was approved
with the aim of minimizing negative environmental effects, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Browning Ferris hopes to begin work in the city part of the dump this
summer.</TE>

<HD>Plant to Mine Water Under Oxnard Plain</HD>
<DH>Environment: Agencies say $50-million purification facility would
reduce expensive imports from the Sierra and recycle waste water for use
on local crops.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN F. SHERRY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A coalition of Ventura County water agencies plans to spend</LD>
<LD>   $50 million during the next five years to build a plant to pump water
from beneath the Oxnard Plain, remove its salts and make it safe to
drink.</LD>
<LD>   Groundwater Recovery Enhancement and Treatment, which supporters call
the GREAT program, recently received $1.6 million in state and federal
grants to help cover the $4.5 million needed to design a
20,000-square-foot purification facility.</LD>
<TE>   Along with creating a new source of tap water for 170,000 Oxnard
residents, the project would clean up millions of gallons of waste water,
which would be used for agricultural irrigation.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the epitome of reuse or recycling," said Ken Ortega, Oxnard's
water superintendent. "The benefits outweigh the costs."</TE>
<TE>   Planned for completion by 2007, the program would help local water
agencies reduce their dependence on expensive water carried by aqueduct
from Northern California. Imported water that Oxnard buys from the
Calleguas Municipal Water District in Thousand Oaks costs about five
times as much as the water it pumps locally, Ortega said.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard spends about $600,000 a year to collect water from its own
wells, and buys $1.6 million worth of water from the Santa Paula-based
United Water Conservation District, which mostly serves agricultural
customers. The city spends an additional $9 million annually to purchase
water from the Calleguas district.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously we're interested in saving money, but we're also interested
in stabilizing our rates," Ortega said.</TE>
<TE>   The west county's four water agencies--Oxnard, Calleguas, United Water
and the Port Hueneme Water Agency--support the Groundwater Recovery
Enhancement and Treatment project.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1996, the Port Hueneme Water Agency has operated a test facility
to treat salty water. After studying three methods of removing salts and
other impurities, project officials opted to employ a process known as
reverse osmosis in the new filtration plant that would pump ground water
and squeeze it through plastic membranes with microscopic holes. Those
openings are just large enough to allow water molecules to pass through,
but small enough to block salts and other particulates.</TE>
<TE>   "All of the nasties are on the other side of the membrane, and are
backwashed out of the system," Ortega said.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining briny water, which is still less salty than ocean water,
would be discharged into the Pacific or used to restore coastal wetlands
in the Ormond Beach area.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard now discharges about 25 million gallons of treated, salty waste
water into the ocean daily. Under the new project, the city's waste water
treatment plant would give this discharged water an additional filtering
before sending it on to the Port Hueneme facility for desalination. Once
free of salt, the water would then be used on crops.</TE>
<TE>   During rainy months, when farmers rely more on the weather for
irrigation, the treated waste water would be pumped into the ground on
the Oxnard Plain to create an underground barrier to prevent sea water
from leaching into the system.</TE>
<TE>   The Port Hueneme Water Agency, with 50,000 customers, supports the
project in concept but has not yet committed to the full plan, said
Douglas Breeze, the city's public works director.</TE>
<TE>   Breeze also said the program could benefit the 220,000 water customers
in Oxnard and Port Hueneme by potentially lowering their water bills.</TE>
<TE>   Water agencies are always looking to enhance water quality and
increase local reserves, said Donald Kendall, general manager of
Calleguas, which provides water from the Sierra Nevada range in Northern
California to more than 500,000 customers from Oxnard to Simi Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Kendall said there is a reason why Calleguas in the east county would
support an expensive project in Oxnard: When local water agencies buy
less water from Northern California, the overall costs go down.</TE>
<TE>   Once Oxnard produces more of its own drinking water, that would free
up water for customers elsewhere. Although Calleguas would lose some of
Oxnard's business, it would have additional water available to sell to
other customers.</TE>

<LD>Ventura resident Eric Borgeson and his 14-year-old son, Logan,
share a love for the ocean and riding waves. But they aren't traditional
surfers.</LD>
<LD>   For eight years, Borgeson has been using wave skis, a combination
surfboard and kayak with footholds, a seat, seat belt and paddle.</LD>
<LD>   "It's easier to catch waves on them than board surfing," said
Borgeson, 44, who brought his son into the sport. The paddle and curve of
the board give riders more speed and agility, he said.</LD>
<TE>   Logan said wave skis are easier to balance and maneuver than
surfboards.</TE>
<TE>   "You can do so much more stuff," he said. "On a surfboard you have to
lean your weight," whereas on a wave ski, a rider can simply dip a paddle
to make a quick turn.</TE>
<TE>   The Borgesons will be among dozens of men and women taking part in a
two-day wave ski and kayak competition that begins today at Surfers Point
in Ventura. Contestants will compete for up to $2,500 in cash prizes.</TE>
<TE>   The four categories of competition are wave skis, sit-on-top kayaks,
standard international kayaks and closed kayaks, which conceal the lower
half of a rider's body.</TE>
<TE>   In each competition, riders have 19 minutes to catch three waves and
show their stuff. They are judged by type of wave, maneuvers and length
of ride.</TE>
<TE>   Competitor Nick Fisher of Port Hueneme, who has been surfing since he
was 7, stumbled upon kayak surfing. He bought a kayak in 1994 but didn't
have surfing or competing in mind.</TE>
<TE>   "I got it, frankly, to paddle around the harbor and drink beer," he
said. One day, while out at sea, Fisher felt too fatigued to paddle to
shore. Instead, he caught a wave, rode it back and discovered a different
kind of sport.</TE>
<TE>   He said he prefers kayaking to board surfing because he is "closer to
the wave."</TE>
<TE>   "I honestly feel it's the intimacy to the wave," said Fisher, 53, who
will compete in the sit-on-top kayak category. "When you're sitting down
and you pull a barrel, it's fun."</TE>
<TE>   Roger Adams of Ventura will compete against Borgeson in the expert
wave ski category. He applied his skills as a white-water kayaker to
waves on the Atlantic Ocean when he lived on the East Coast.</TE>
<TE>   "For the effort that you put into it, you get so much back," said
Adams, 46. "You get more bang for your paddle stroke. . . . It's like
riding a bobsled."</TE>
<TE>   The competitors take a laid-back approach to events like the one this
weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "They're more like a get-together," Borgeson said. "I've done it
mostly to see my own friends."</TE>
<TE>   With this weekend's event, kayak and wave ski riders hope their sports
will gain more popularity.</TE>
<TE>   "When you first paddle out, everyone thinks you're a kook," Fisher
said. But "some of these guys in the little boats are going to be able to
rip it."</TE>
<TE>FYI</TE>

p.m. today and Sunday at the west end of Surfers Point, adjacent to

<HD>Water Agency Adopts Tough Runoff Rules</HD>
<DH>Pollution: Government officials say the new regulations for north
and central O.C. will be costly. Environmentalists say they are too weak.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State water officials unanimously approved tough new regulations on
storm water runoff in northern and central Orange County on Friday, a
plan that local leaders say will cost $14 million a year.</LD>
<LD>   "It's going to cost all of us more money," said Vicki Wilson, director
of the county's Public Facilities and Resources Department. "We want to
make sure we're spending it wisely and getting improvements."</LD>
<LD>   Runoff--water containing car oil, pet waste and other contaminants
that flows from streets and lawns into waterways and eventually the
ocean--is the No. 1 cause of coastal pollution, according to the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency.</LD>
<TE>   New requirements include strict inspections of construction sites,
carwashes and other businesses that produce runoff; a ban on discharges
from storm drains polluting water beyond state limits; and the adoption
of civil and criminal penalties for violations.</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Ana Regional Water Quality Control Board--an arm of the
state that enforces state and federal water-quality laws in northern and
central Orange County--is trying to make a dent in the local runoff
problem by imposing strict new rules in a five-year permit issued to the
county and cities in its jurisdiction.</TE>
<TE>   The permit, required by the federal Clean Water Act, was approved by
the regional water board on a 6-0 vote.</TE>
<TE>   Two board members, John Withers and Jose Solario, abstained because of
potential conflicts of interest.</TE>
<TE>   Board members and staff said they tried to improve local water quality
while offering local officials flexibility.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to reach a balance," board member William Ruh said.</TE>
<TE>   The permit has been through countless drafts and revisions. In
December, the water board delayed taking action on it after local
officials objected to dozens of revisions they had not had a chance to
review.</TE>
<TE>   Testimony during Friday's one-hour hearing was restricted to those 49
changes.</TE>
<TE>   No one--not environmentalists, builders or cities--truly likes the new
permit.</TE>
<TE>   "If everyone's mad at you, then we've done something right," said
board Chairwoman Carole Beswick.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists say the rules offer too many concessions to
developers and are vaguer and less effective than storm water permits
adopted for Los Angeles and San Diego counties.</TE>
<TE>   "This permit is a salute to the building industry at the expense of
citizens who recreate on the beach," said Bob Caustin, founder of Newport
Beach-based Defend the Bay.</TE>
<TE>   David Beckman, a senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense
Council, added, "It's the water-quality weakling along the coast."</TE>
<TE>   Other permits in the region require developers to plan most new
construction with built-in mechanisms to slow and cleanse the "first
flush" of runoff.</TE>
<TE>   The first flush--typically a little less than an inch of rain to fall
in Southern California--is the dirtiest, picking up pollutants that have
been accumulating on streets and lawns for weeks or months, and sending
them into waterways and eventually the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   The permit approved Friday gives local officials until March 2003 to
come up with a regionwide approach for the first flush of runoff.</TE>
<TE>   That could mean diverting runoff to artificial wetlands that would
naturally clean the water.</TE>
<TE>   If they fail to come up with a broad plan, a first-flush standard
similar to those in Los Angeles and San Diego counties will be imposed.</TE>
<TE>   However, developments that have tract maps in place by that date will
be exempt--which environmentalists call a gaping loophole in a county
that approves 7,932 building permits annually.</TE>
<TE>   Local activists also say public education, street sweeping and other
requirements are vague, and that self-audits of municipal yards and other
facilities are "laughable."</TE>
<TE>   Builders and cities say the permit is more reasonable than those found
elsewhere in the region, but still too costly.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very workable permit," said attorney Paul Singarella,
representing Leisure World. "I think they sent everybody away a little
less than perfectly satisfied, so therefore, I think they struck the
right balance."</TE>
<TE>   According to a cost analysis prepared by the county, the cities were
already spending $52 million to meet existing storm water regulations in
northern and central Orange County this fiscal year. Meeting the new
permit requirements would cost an additional $14 million, the analysis
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We will spend more on water quality than we do on police protection,"
said Robert Ring, a Laguna Woods councilman.</TE>
<TE>   Others said the new regulations are impractical and will lead to
higher housing costs.</TE>
<TE>   "A permit like this will cause developers . . . to look to other parts
of the state to build affordable housing," said Matt Petteruto of the
Apartment Assn. of Orange County, which represents more than 3,000
apartment owners and management companies.</TE>
<TE>   A more stringent permit is under consideration for South County, which
is under the jurisdiction of the San Diego Regional Water Quality Control
Board.</TE>
<TE>   It is modeled after the permits adopted for Los Angeles and San Diego
counties and is expected to be voted on Feb. 13 in the Mission Viejo City
Council chamber.</TE>

<HD>Huntington Beach Massagers No Longer Need HIV Testing</HD>
<DH>Law: Police concede to therapists and strike a requirement they say
was from a bygone era when prostitutes regularly used massage parlors as
fronts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MONTE MORIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Huntington Beach police announced Friday that they will scrap a
17-year-old vice-squad requirement that all city massage therapists be
tested regularly for sexually transmitted diseases--a requirement that
critics claimed is outdated and illegal.</LD>
<LD>   Facing the ire of national and local massage therapists, city police
said they will no longer demand that massage therapists submit to annual
testing for HIV, syphilis and gonorrhea.</LD>
<LD>   The decision followed an extensive lobbying effort on the part of
local massage therapists, who harshly criticized the requirement.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm feeling very pleased and vindicated," said Mark Dixon, a 14-year
sports massage specialist who spearheaded an effort to eliminate the
requirement. "Finally, our profession is being respected as the fine
healing tradition that it is."</TE>
<TE>   Dixon and other massage therapists, including the president of the
American Massage Therapy Assn., complained it was degrading to demand
such testing of therapists, because it implied they were providing more
than massages.</TE>
<TE>   Dixon, who was approved to attend the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake
City as a massage therapist, said no such testing was required by the
FBI, which handled the approval process.</TE>
<TE>   "I was outraged at the whole premise," Dixon said of the Huntington
Beach requirement. "I'm not going to have sex with my clients."</TE>
<TE>   The requirement also ran afoul of the law by requiring test results
for HIV. Doctors are legally barred from revealing the results of HIV
tests.</TE>
<TE>   Therapists had planned to assemble in force at next week's city
council meeting and demand that officials eliminate the requirement. City
police, however, relented Friday and agreed to scrap the requirement
unilaterally after reviewing the policy.</TE>
<TE>   "We decided that the policy was outdated and had to be removed," said
Huntington Beach Police Lt. Preston Linker.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an old ordinance that we approved in 1985, when we had a
significant problem with massage parlors acting as fronts for illicit sex
businesses. . . . That's not the problem today, however."</TE>
<TE>   Although officials are removing the HIV testing condition, therapists
must still be tested for TB and Hepatitis B and C, similar to other
health workers.</TE>
<TE>   Massage therapists must also prove they have had at least 500 hours of
schooling and that they are certified by a national professional
organization.</TE>
<TE>   Linker said those requirements, as well as aggressive policing by the
department's vice unit, had served to keep illicit massage operations out
of Huntington Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd say it's been a year or two since we've had a documented incident
of sexual misconduct occurring under the guise of legitimate massage,"
Linker said.</TE>
<TE>   Removal of the testing requirement is effective immediately, Linker
said.</TE>
<TE>   Among those people who called for the elimination of testing was
retired Huntington Beach Police Vice Detective Tim Chambers.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter sent to the city council, Chambers said the training and
certification requirements were adequate to ensure the city licensed
legitimate therapists.</TE>
<TE>   "When prostitutes operated in Huntington Beach, disguised as massage
therapists, this [testing] requirement did nothing to solve the problem,"
Chambers said. "Not one house of prostitution was shut down, nor one
potential prostitute kept out of the city by this code section."</TE>

<HD>Fire on Bus Injures 8 Kids, 1 Adult</HD>
<DH>Accident: Lost tire sparks blaze on vehicle carrying 55 people on
San Diego Freeway. None seriously hurt.</DH>

<LD>Eight middle-school students and one adult were hospitalized
briefly Friday after their chartered bus caught fire in Costa Mesa on the
way to a weekend field trip, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   None of the 55 students or chaperons from Yavneh Hebrew Academy in Los
Angeles was seriously injured, investigators said. Those sent to local
hospitals were treated for minor smoke inhalation and released.</LD>
<LD>   The students were on their way to the Palace Park entertainment center
in Irvine to begin a weekend getaway. About 11 a.m., as the bus was
traveling south on the San Diego Freeway near Harbor Boulevard, a right
rear tire came loose and flew in the air, said Capt. Scott Broussard of
the Costa Mesa Fire Department. Sparks began to fly, igniting one side of
the bus, he said.</LD>
<TE>   The driver, Bob Herron of First Class Charter, stopped the bus on the
right shoulder, and the students scrambled off.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought it was going to blow up," said Elan Javanfart, 13, of Los
Angeles. "We were screaming for everyone to hurry up and get off."</TE>
<TE>   Gabriel Siegal, 12, of Los Angeles said he was listening to music on
his headphones in the rear of the bus when he heard a loud pop, smelled
fumes and saw flames along the side of the vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   "It was scary," he said. "The seats were shaking and everyone was
screaming."</TE>
<TE>   When firefighters arrived, they escorted the children 200 yards away,
where the group waited for another bus. They watched as firefighters
removed backpacks, sleeping bags and luggage from the damaged bus.</TE>
<TE>   Said Rabbi Moshe Amster, who was riding in a van accompanying the bus:
"Thank goodness everyone is safe."</TE>

<HD>Shooting Prompts Tighter Security</HD>
<DH>Compton: The City Council gets added protection after a member
escapes a brush with gunfire.</DH>

<LD>Security for the Compton City Council was bolstered this week after
a council member and her sister were shot at as they returned from a
meeting late Tuesday, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Councilwoman Leslie Irving and her sister, council liaison Kellie
Irving, were entering a gate next to their home at 11:59 p.m. Tuesday
when two men in a black sport utility vehicle stopped and fired several
shots at them before driving off, according to the Los Angeles County
Sheriff's Department. Neither Irving, who took office in July, nor her
sister was injured.</LD>
<LD>   Sheriff's detectives were investigating the shooting and "security was
stepped up for the entire council," said Sgt. Scott Anger.</LD>
<TE>   The department also is providing "extra security checks" for the
councilwoman and her sister, he said.</TE>
<TE>   At Tuesday's meeting, Irving, Councilwoman Yvonne Arceneaux and Mayor
Eric Perrodin voted to overturn the Planning Commission's approval of a
proposed swap meet across the street from Compton Fashion Center on Long
Beach Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   "I do believe it's politically motivated," Arceneaux said of the
shooting. "I'm not sure what the motive was, but we did reject [the
Planning Commission vote]."</TE>
<TE>   Arceneaux said residents voiced strong opposition to the swap meet at
the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   But Councilwoman Delores Zurita said she saw no connection between the
vote and the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think so, no," she said. "God knows [Irving] hasn't been on
the council long enough to make any enemies. I just don't know why anyone
would want to shoot at her."</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Amen Rahh called the incident "a tragedy," saying, "Every
citizen in Compton is worried about shootings." Rahh would not speculate
about any possible motivation.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know why," he said. "My hope is that we offer a reward for
the arrest of the people who did it. Let the police figure out who and
why."</TE>
<TE>   Irving would not comment on the incident, saying she did not want to
hamper the investigation. Perrodin was unavailable for comment.</TE>

<HD>Man Sought in Beating, Abduction of Children</HD>
<DH>Violence: His 4-year-old daughter is found safe a day after she was
taken; her younger sister remains hospitalized.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles man who allegedly beat his 16-month-old daughter and
then abducted her 4-year-old sister remained at large Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The abducted girl, Majesta Miranda, was found by a man about 6 p.m.
Friday in a San Pedro neighborhood, a day after she disappeared. But
police with tracking dogs continued to scour the neighborhood for her
father, Harry Lee Perez, 36.</LD>
<LD>   Police said Perez violently shook his toddler, Katarina Miranda, then
threw her on a bed, where she bounced off and hit her head on a chest of
drawers Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   Perez drove Katarina to Gardena Memorial Hospital and then fled with
his 4-year-old, said Lt. Daniel Mulrenin of the Los Angeles Police
Department.</TE>
<TE>   The girls' mother, Muriel Miranda, 29, told police that Perez had
abused Katarina in the past and sometimes put her in the freezer, annoyed
with her crying.</TE>
<TE>   Perez, who was released from prison in November after serving time for
domestic abuse and robbery, is believed to be affiliated with the Mexican
Mafia, Mulrenin said. "We're concerned about his penchant for violence,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Perez and Miranda lived with their two daughters in a Southeast Los
Angeles apartment.</TE>
<TE>   Katarina, who suffered severe head injuries, was in fair condition at
Miller Children's Hospital in Long Beach. Police said Majesta appeared to
be in good condition.</TE>
<TE>   Police found Perez's Honda Civic on Friday near the 1500 block of West
21st Street in San Pedro.</TE>
<TE>   Perez is 5-foot-11 and weighs 190 pounds. He has "PEREZ" tattooed on
his back, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone with information is asked to call the LAPD's Abused Child Unit
at (213) 485-4220 during business hours or (877) 529-3855.</TE>

<HD>Sheriff's Arson Unit Probes 16 Recent Fires</HD>
<DH>Crime: Series of blazes in Paramount and Compton appear to follow
the same pattern.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ F. KAY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investigators said a fire in east Compton on Thursday night may be
the latest in a series of arson cases in Paramount and Compton since
October.</LD>
<LD>   Details of Thursday's fire matched the others, said Sgt. Larry
Krookshanks of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's arson unit. As in
previous cases, small items were stolen from the home at 4929 E. San
Marcus St. before the fire was set, he said.</LD>
<LD>   Seven cases have been reported in Paramount, nine in Compton. Of the
16 fires, "we are relatively positive that at least 15 of them fit the
serial arsonist M.O.," Krookshanks said. Eight have occurred since Jan.
1.</LD>
<TE>   "He's been very active and brazen," Krookshanks said. The perpetrator
took "small carryable items--anything he could stick in his pockets."</TE>
<TE>   Those involved are "committing the burglary, and as a parting gesture,
setting a fire inside the location and leaving it to burn," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The crimes have all taken place within a three- to four-mile radius,
Krookshanks said.</TE>
<TE>   Some single-family homes and vacant houses were hit, but most
incidents occurred in apartment complexes, he said. Entry was gained
through windows despite security bars, Krookshanks said. The intruder
either bent the bars to gain access or defeated the security mechanism
entirely.</TE>
<TE>   No one has been injured in the fires. Damage to the homes ranged from
very minor to rather extensive, estimated at several thousand dollars,
Krookshanks said.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the fires were set between 6 and 8:30 p.m. when the apartments
were empty, he said. People were in other units in the buildings,
however.</TE>
<TE>   A victim saw the suspect as he fled the scene of a fire Dec. 25. The
man is described as a Latino in his mid-20s, between 5 feet 5 and 5 feet
8 and weighing 160 to 180 pounds.</TE>

<LD>Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski said Friday that she will revive a
proposal to generally ban all new billboards in the city.</LD>
<LD>   She will also fight a plan to trade new freeway signs for the removal
of thousands of existing billboards in neighborhoods.</LD>
<LD>   Miscikowski said at a news conference earlier this week that she will
launch a campaign to ban new billboards and propose a voter initiative to
tax billboard firms to pay for enforcement of city regulations on
existing signs.</LD>
<TE>   "It would essentially kill the freeway deal," she said.</TE>

<LD>Police cordoned off an apartment complex Friday in the southwest
area of the city after discovering possible evidence linked to the body
of a decapitated man found in a trash bin the previous night.</LD>
<LD>   Detectives would not say what they found at the complex in the 4000
block of Palmwood Drive.</LD>
<LD>   The body was discovered about a block away, but the head has not been
found. The man's name was not released pending notification of his
family.</LD>
<TE>   "We're protecting the area as a possible crime scene," Det. Jeff Nolte
said, adding that police are not close to making an arrest.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Nine Greenpeace protesters were sentenced to one year's probation
by a federal judge Friday for trying to disrupt a "Star Wars" missile
defense test at Vandenberg Air Force Base in July.</LD>
<LD>   In a deal with federal prosecutors earlier this month, Greenpeace
agreed to pay a $150,000 civil fine and refrain from conducting any
further acts of civil disobedience at U.S. military installations
involved in the antimissile program.</LD>
<LD>   In exchange, 16 Greenpeace activists were allowed to plead guilty to
misdemeanors, averting a trial on felony charges.</LD>
<TE>   The government did not seek jail time for the nine sentenced Friday,
but may do so for seven others scheduled to be sentenced in mid-April,
the U.S. attorney's office said.</TE>

<LD>An ex-convict who kidnapped and robbed a 21-year-old woman, then
burned her to death, was sentenced Friday in Superior Court to life in
prison without parole.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Lynn Crosby, 38, abducted Katrice Whitfield of South Los
Angeles on July 9, 1999, from Figueroa Street and Imperial Highway in
South-Central Los Angeles and killed her so she could not identify him,
Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeffrey Jonas said.</LD>
<LD>   At a machine shop on Inez Avenue in South Whittier he doused her with
gasoline and set her afire, according to the district attorney's office.
She was the mother of a 2-year-old girl.</LD>
<TE>   In a separate court hearing involving the same case, Crosby's stepson,
Raymond Avery Willis, 18, pleaded guilty to attempted robbery and
kidnapping. He is expected to be sentenced April 26 to the California
Youth Authority until he is 25 years old.</TE>

<HD>Traffic Is Key Roadblock to School's Plans</HD>
<DH>Education: Opponents of Hillcrest Christian's expansion bid worry
about rush-hour congestion in Granada Hills.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAIRE LUNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Traffic flow was the main concern at a hearing Friday on the
proposed expansion of a Christian school in Granada Hills.</LD>
<LD>   The expansion would add five acres and 400 students to Hillcrest
Christian School, doubling the acreage of the campus at Rinaldi Street
and Shoshone Avenue.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly 350 people--evenly supporters and opponents of the
project--packed a ballroom at the Airtel Plaza Hotel in Van Nuys for the
six-hour session.</LD>
<TE>   The school's expansion would add to the rush-hour traffic on Rinaldi
Street, a popular alternative to the Ronald Reagan Freeway, opponents
said.</TE>
<TE>   But supporters countered that the area's overall growth should not be
blamed solely on the school.</TE>
<TE>   "The traffic problem is not from Hillcrest," said Don Cosby, 75, who
lives half a block from the campus. He said there are three other schools
in the neighborhood and hundreds of new homes have been built there in
the last few years. "Times change and we have to change with them."</TE>
<TE>   Some opponents were suspicious of the modifications the school has
made to its plans since buying the land five years ago. A proposal to
increase enrollment by 600 students was reduced to 400, and a football
field with stadium lighting was eliminated, Hillcrest representative
Peter Elias said.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel C. Lavery, 62, who lives next to the site, said he worries that
the school will expand on its plans at a later date. "They're going to
come back in five years or less and ask again, ruining our neighborhood
piecemeal rather than all at once."</TE>
<TE>   The hearing was postponed last week when the scheduled meeting room
proved too small to hold the hundreds of people who showed up.</TE>
<TE>   At Friday's hearing, opponents were rowdier than supporters--clapping,
snickering and commenting on speakers' testimony. Both sides advertised
their feelings on their shirts: the sunshine yellow "I love Hillcrest"
buttons of supporters vied with the neon yellow cards reading "N.O.P.E.
Neighbors Oppose Planned Expansion" worn by opponents.</TE>
<TE>   Zoning administrator Lourdes Green, who mediated the hearing, said she
will make a recommendation on the expansion to the city Planning
Commission by Feb. 18.</TE>

<HD>Dog Who Takes Matters Into Her Own Paws Is Saved by a Good

<LD>Karen Sortito of Hollywood was cruising down Little Santa Monica
Boulevard on Friday morning when one of her Shiba Inu dogs hit the power
window button in the back seat and leaped into traffic.</LD>
<LD>   Sortito didn't realize this until a woman drove up next to her
signaling frantically. "I thought she was telling me what a beautiful day
it was," Sortito said. "But then I noticed she was screaming, 'Your dog!
Your dog!' Next thing I know she had gotten out of her own car, run into
the traffic after my dog and brought her back to me."</LD>
<LD>   Then, just as quickly, the good Samaritan sped away. "I didn't even
get this wonderful person's name," Sortito said. "I was yelling, 'Thank
you! Thank you! Bad dog! Bad dog!' But it's just nice to know there are
people out there like her."</LD>
<TE>   Concluded Sortito: "I've learned my lesson. My dogs are going to be in
seat belts from now on."</TE>
<TE>   The fugitive pooch's name, by the way, is Carmela. "I named her after
Tony's wife [in TV's 'The Sopranos']," Sortito said. "She's just like
Carmela: feisty."</TE>
<TE>   Businesses that catch the eye: Ray Paul Klimek of Sherman Oaks found a
sign that would appeal to anyone doing any soul--or sole--searching,
while Thomas Sroczynski of Torrance came upon a company in New Jersey
with specially prepared vehicle parts (see photos).</TE>
<TE>   College daze: At Cal State Long Beach, T.R. Conn found a signpost that
left him in a state of confusion (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Still pecking away: The Freeway Chicken population in L.A. seemed to
peak a quarter-century or so ago when two tribes lived a few offramps
apart in Hollywood. One colony began after a poultry truck crash. The
other was apparently related to pets set free in the area.</TE>
<TE>   I've always considered the chickens one of the great Hollywood
survival stories. But it's been awhile since I've heard of any sightings
there.</TE>
<TE>   But they haven't vanished from the Southland. Last year, reader Kathy
January saw a motorist tossing breakfast to a couple of chickens on the
San Bernardino Freeway in the East L.A. area.</TE>
<TE>   And now Denise Skaggs of Long Beach writes that she has spotted a
rooster that lives on the transition ramp from the San Gabriel to the
Santa Ana Freeway in Downey. "He is there every day, patrolling his
little patch of green," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Waiting perhaps for a lift to East L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Picture this: "I noticed a headline that read, 'Hahn to Seek U.S.
Grants for LAX,' " writes Jim Maxwell. "Why is he limiting his appeal to
$50 bills?"</TE>
<TE>   Hey, let's just hope the government doesn't try to limit Hahn to
George Washingtons.</TE>
<TE>   To each his own: Kate Nelson of Escondido saw a Mercedes with a
license plate that read: I (Heart) SNAIL.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson isn't sure whether the owner loves escargot or the freeway
commute.</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: After I mentioned the movies, books and songs about people
escaping from L.A., David Daniel of Encino came up with an exception: the
Eagles' "Hotel California." All together now: "You can check out any time
you like, but you can never leave." (But what's the hurry with a
three-day weekend here?)</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A police chase involving a man who allegedly stole a car in Fontana
ended early Friday at a California Highway Patrol roadblock on the
Riverside Freeway when Riverside police shot the driver after he smashed
his vehicle into a CHP car.</LD>
<LD>   The westbound lanes of the freeway were closed for eight hours at the
Adams Street exit, causing severe traffic congestion on some Riverside
surface streets until noon.</LD>
<LD>   The man was not immediately identified. His wounds were not
life-threatening, said Riverside Police Lt. John Wallace.</LD>
<TE>   He was taken to a hospital for treatment and could be charged with
felony evading of pursuing officers, grand theft auto and assault with a
deadly weapon on a police officer, Wallace said.</TE>
<TE>   The chase began shortly before 3 a.m. when police tried to stop the
man on surface streets in Fontana and continued for 45 minutes, part of
the time as he drove the wrong way on the freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace said that at one point the man got off the freeway on McKinley
Street, then veered back onto the freeway and drove east in the westbound
lanes, finally striking the CHP car. The shooting is under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   During the chase the man was also involved in a minor collision with
another motorist.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace said Riverside police were assisted by the CHP, which set up
the roadblock.</TE>

<HD>Loving Tears Mixed With Laughter and Inspiration</HD>
<DH>Memorial: His widow and fellow Marines reflect on Stephen Bryson,
killed last week in a plane crash in Pakistan, as a man of quiet,
rock-solid faith, intelligence and integrity.</DH>

<LD>Stephen L. Bryson died serving his country in the war on terrorism.
On Friday, the Marine Corps gunnery sergeant was remembered for that, and
for his other roles: husband, son, brother and friend. And as a man who
embraced God throughout his 36 years.</LD>
<LD>   In a highly charged 2 1/2-hour service at Friendship Baptist Church in
Yorba Linda, Bryson's family, friends and fellow Marines told the story
of a career military man who never feared death because he always tried
to live life to its fullest.</LD>
<LD>   "You made sure I knew how much you loved me every day. Not just with
presents, but with your presence," said Katrina Bryson, the high school
sweetheart from Alabama who became his wife. "You were everything I
wished I could be. Now I can fly higher than an eagle. You are the wind
beneath my wings."</LD>
<TE>   Bryson and six other Marines were killed last week when their KC-130
Hercules slammed into a mountain in Pakistan while attempting to land.
The cause of the crash has yet to be determined.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, a somber ceremony for the dead was held at San Diego's
Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, where their squadron was based.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's memorial for Bryson, who lived in Rancho Santa Margarita, was
somber as well. But the tears were mixed with laughter and inspiration. A
slide show documented Bryson's life, while the church choir with which he
sang belted out gospel songs that had the several hundred people in the
congregation on their feet dancing and singing.</TE>
<TE>   "We know that he is with the Lord," said the Rev. James D. Carrington,
pastor of the church, where Bryson was also on the board of trustees.
"And because he is with the Lord, we are going to have a good time."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm on the battlefield soldiering for the Lord," the choir sang.
Within minutes, three rows of stoic Marines in dress uniforms with stiff
collars rose in unison and began clapping too.</TE>
<TE>'Peabo' Joined Marines Right Out of School</TE>
<TE>   Bryson's comrades remembered "Peabo," who joined the Marines in 1985
right out of high school, as a man of intelligence and integrity who was
quick to laugh but never angered.</TE>
<TE>   "He was the calmest in the eye of the storm," said Gunnery Sgt.
Michael Grace, who served with Bryson in Pakistan and Afghanistan.
"That's why he was a mentor to us all."</TE>
<TE>   Master Sgt. Terry O'Neil recalled awakening early one morning in
Afghanistan and looking over to see Bryson sitting on his cot, a Bible
open in his lap. He was quietly jotting down notes.</TE>
<TE>   Bryson didn't openly push his faith, O'Neil said. Rather, he lived it
by example.</TE>
<TE>   "He brought his faith and religion with him, and he shared it with the
Marines that were out there," O'Neil said. "He had a leadership skill and
a leadership style that many Marines would like to aspire to. Stephen was
a Marine's Marine. I miss him," he said, choking back tears. "To lose
him. . . . It's hard."</TE>
<TE>   Maj. Floyd Means Jr. flew overnight from Japan to be at the service.
"There is nothing I wouldn't do for Stephen Bryson, because there is
nothing he wouldn't do for me," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bryson was Means' video game competitor. He was the voice in his ear
during missions, providing all the right answers to difficult questions.
He and Katrina introduced Means to his future wife.</TE>
<TE>   Once, Means found himself laboring most of a day to remove an exhaust
system from his car. Bryson came along "and within two seconds, he had
the answer," Means said. "Steve knew it all. And he gave it all freely."</TE>
<TE>   When Maj. Kolan Hairston went to Bryson's home to comfort his widow,
it was Katrina who ended up comforting him.</TE>
<TE>   "She explained to me how lucky we were to have Stephen for the time we
had," Hairston said. "He set the watermark for how we should live. He was
a Marine. But more than that, far more that, he was a dear friend."</TE>

<HD>9 Briefly Hospitalized After Bus Catches Fire</HD>

<LD>Eight middle school students and one adult were hospitalized
briefly Friday after their chartered bus caught fire in Costa Mesa on the
way to a weekend field trip, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   None of the 55 students or chaperons from Yavneh Hebrew Academy in Los
Angeles was seriously injured, investigators said. Those sent to local
hospitals were treated for minor smoke inhalation and released.</LD>
<LD>   The students were on their way to the Palace Park entertainment center
in Irvine. About 11 a.m., as the bus was traveling south on the San Diego
Freeway near Harbor Boulevard, a right rear tire came loose and flew into
the air, said Capt. Scott Broussard of the Costa Mesa Fire Department.
Sparks ignited one side of the bus, he said.</LD>
<TE>   The driver, Bob Herron of First Class Charter, stopped the bus on the
right shoulder, and the students pushed their way off.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought it was going to blow up," said Elan Javanfart, 13, of Los
Angeles. "We were screaming for everyone to hurry up and get off."</TE>
<TE>   Gabriel Siegal, 12, of Los Angeles said he was listening to music on
his headphones in the rear of the bus when he heard a loud pop, smelled
fumes and saw flames along the side of the vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   When firefighters arrived, they escorted the children 200 yards away,
where the group waited for another bus.</TE>

<HD>State OKs Tough New Regulations to Reduce Runoff</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State officials Friday unanimously approved tough new regulations
on storm-water runoff in northern and central Orange County, a plan that
local leaders say will cost $14 million a year.</LD>
<LD>   "It's going to cost all of us more money," said Vicki Wilson, director
of the county's Public Facilities and Resources Department. "We want to
make sure we're spending it wisely and getting improvements."</LD>
<LD>   Runoff--the car oil, pet waste and other contaminants washed off
streets and lawns into waterways and eventually the ocean--is the No. 1
cause of coastal pollution, according to the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency.</LD>
<TE>   New requirements include strict inspections of construction sites,
carwashes and other businesses that often are the sources of runoff;
requirements that discharges from storm drains will not pollute water
beyond state limits; and the adoption of civil and criminal penalties for
violations.</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Ana Regional Water Quality Control Board, an arm of the
state that is charged with enforcing state and federal water-quality laws
in northern and central Orange County, is trying to make a dent in the
local runoff problem with new rules under a five-year permit issued to
the county and cities in its jurisdiction.</TE>
<TE>   No one--not environmentalists, builders or municipalities--truly likes
the new permit, required under the federal Clean Water Act.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists say the rules offer too many concessions to
developers and are vaguer than storm-water permits adopted for Los
Angeles and San Diego counties.</TE>
<TE>   "This permit is a salute to the building industry at the expense of
citizens who recreate on the beach," said Bob Caustin, founder of Newport
Beach-based Defend the Bay.</TE>
<TE>   David Beckman, a senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense
Council, added, "It's the water-quality weakling along the coast."</TE>
<TE>   Other permits in the region require developers to plan most new
construction with built-in mechanisms to slow and cleanse the "first
flush" of runoff. The first flush, typically a little less than an inch
of water to fall on an area in Southern California, is the dirtiest,
picking up car oil, pet waste, fertilizer and other pollutants that have
been accumulating on streets and lawns for weeks or months, and sending
it into waterways and eventually the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   The permit approved Friday gives local officials until March 2003 to
come up with a regionwide approach for the first flush of runoff, such as
diverting runoff to artificial wetlands that would naturally clean the
water, for example. If a broad plan is not devised, a first-flush
standard similar to those in Los Angeles and San Diego counties will be
imposed. But developments that have tract maps in place by that date will
be exempt, which environmentalists call a loophole in a county that
approves 7,932 building permits annually.</TE>

<HD>Harding Lawrence, 81; Led Braniff Airways</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Harding L. Lawrence, an airline industry maverick whose unorthodox
strategies took Braniff Airways out of obscurity in the 1970s and into
bankruptcy in the 1980s, died of pancreatic cancer Wednesday at his home
on the Caribbean island of Mustique. He was 81.</LD>
<LD>   Lawrence became president and chief executive of Braniff in 1965, when
it operated routes in the Midwest and Southwest. He had spent the
previous 10 years at Continental Airlines, where he built a reputation
for daring and flamboyance.</LD>
<LD>   During his 15 years at the helm of Braniff, it became the
eighth-largest airline in North America. For 11 of those 15 years,
Dallas-based Braniff led the industry in its rate of traffic growth and
nearly doubled its share of the passenger market.</LD>
<TE>   Emboldened by federal deregulation of the industry, Lawrence led
Braniff in a major expansion in 1978 and 1979, grabbing up routes that
had been dormant. He added 16 cities in one day alone. He increased
service to 22 other destinations and began flying to Europe, the Pacific
and the Far East.</TE>
<TE>   Braniff became the first U.S. airline to fly the Concorde, in 1979,
when it covered the domestic leg of the Dallas-Washington-Paris-London
run.</TE>
<TE>   While the rest of the industry was going to wide-bodied jets, Lawrence
converted Braniff's fleet to the narrower Boeing 727s. He put leather
seats in first class and turned his cabin attendants into fashion plates,
dressing them in multilayered uniforms by designer Emilio Pucci. By
shedding layers, the flight attendants-mainly women-changed costume as
many as six times a flight, a feat Lawrence teasingly called the "air
strip.'</TE>
<TE>   He hired renowned artist Alexander Calder to turn two jets into flying
artworks by painting abstract multicolored designs on them. He had been
counseled by New York advertising executive Mary Wells, who urged him to
scrap Braniff's stodgy colors in favor of planes decked out in
psychedelic purples, oranges and yellows. The transformation was heralded
in a successful campaign conceived by Wells called "The End of the Plain
Plane." Wells later became Mrs. Harding Lawrence.</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence's unconventional tactics succeeded for awhile. In 1979,
Fortune magazine reported that Braniff had the highest percentage of
business travelers-70%-and was nearly unrivaled in the size and
consistency of its operating margins.</TE>
<TE>   'There's not madness in what we're doing," he told the Washington Post
in 1979. "It's very calculated, very thought-out. Admittedly, it's
ambitious, but I think we will make it successful.'</TE>
<TE>   He soon had to eat those words.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said Lawrence had taken Braniff too far too fast. Challenged
by spiraling fuel prices and a slowdown in the economy, Braniff began to
fall apart. By late 1979, its losses reached $44 million. By 1980, it was
retrenching at home and abroad, cutting back domestic flights by 20% and
retreating from the Pacific, the Far East and some parts of Europe. The
Calder jets were painted over in traditional Braniff colors.</TE>
<TE>   Just before Christmas in 1980 the airline's senior lenders forced
Lawrence to step down.</TE>
<TE>   Braniff ceased operations in 1982, buried under $1 billion in debt.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Oklahoma and raised in Texas, Lawrence started in aviation as
assistant director of the No. 1 British Flying Training School in
Terrell, Texas, in 1942. In 1946, he joined Pioneer Air Lines in Houston
as an assistant vice president. When Continental merged with Pioneer in
1955 he became Continental's vice president of traffic and sales.</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence is survived by his wife, five children and seven
grandchildren.</TE>

<LD>John Buscema, a revered comic book illustrator whose pencil
breathed life into Spider-Man, the Mighty Thor and Conan the Barbarian
for a half century, died Jan. 10 in Port Jefferson, N.Y., after a bout
with stomach cancer. He was 74.</LD>
<LD>   'There are very few people in our industry who have escalated to
living legend status. John is among those few people," said Joe Quesada,
editor in chief of Marvel Comics.</LD>
<LD>   He may not have written the book on how to draw comics, but he did
illustrate it, namely the popular "How to Draw Comics the Marvel Way,"
published in 1976.</LD>
<TE>   Despite being considered one of the master draftsmen of his trade,
relatives and colleagues said he was a reluctant comics superstar.</TE>
<TE>   'Comic books for him just provided a very good living, but his passion
was the fine arts," said his son, John Jr. of South Salem, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Buscema attended the High School of Music and Art in Manhattan by day
and studied life drawing and design at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn by
night. With dreams of becoming a painter, Buscema spent countless hours
visiting museums and observing the works of the Masters.</TE>
<TE>   In 1948, he responded to a classified ad placed by Timely Comics,
which would become Marvel Comics, and went to work as a staff illustrator
earning $75 a week before being laid off in 1950.</TE>
<TE>   Buscema later entered advertising, illustrating paperback covers and
textbooks.</TE>
<TE>   In 1966, Buscema's former boss Stan Lee asked Buscema to return to
work at Marvel. "When things picked up, he was one of the first people I
called because he was so good," said Lee, former Marvel editor in chief
and co-creator, with Steve Ditko, of Spider-Man. "He was one of the best
artists I have ever known."</TE>
<TE>   Buscema would work for Marvel for the next 30 years, along the way
working on a who's who of superpowered luminaries.</TE>
<TE>   At heart, Buscema always considered himself a creator of the fine arts
and preferred more rustic, earthly characters such as Thor and Conan the
Barbarian, which he illustrated for two decades.</TE>
<TE>   Along with Conan, Buscema earned much of his recognition in the comic
book community for his work on "The Silver Surfer" and "The Avengers,"
featuring a pack of superheroes.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1970s, Buscema founded his own art school, teaching a small
group of students the Buscema style in a New York City hotel for a few
years.</TE>
<TE>   Buscema retired from Marvel in 1996, but soon found himself tackling
several projects, including commissioned work that sold for several
thousand dollars, and he released a book of his sketches.</TE>
<TE>   Buscema reunited with his former boss, Lee, for his final comic, which
was published by DC Comics late last year.</TE>
<TE>   Besides his son, Buscema is survived by his wife, Dolores, of Port
Jefferson; daughter Dianne Buscema-Gerogianis of Port Jefferson; and four
grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   A funeral service was held Monday.</TE>

<HD>Bertalan de Nemethy, 91; Coached U.S. Equestrians</HD>

<LD>Bertalan de Nemethy, the legendary former coach of the U.S.
Equestrian Team who exerted enormous influence on modern riding and show
jumping, has died.</LD>
<LD>   De Nemethy, 91, developed pneumonia after he was hospitalized last
week with an arm injury. He died Wednesday at his home in Sarasota, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   A former Hungarian cavalry captain who came to the United States in
1952, he coached the show jumping squad of the U.S. Equestrian Team from
1956 to 1980, when he retired.</LD>
<TE>   He continued to give clinics nationwide and rode well into his 80s.</TE>
<TE>   He also designed courses for world-class show jumping events,
including those at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games.</TE>
<TE>   'He brought with him all the cavalry traditions of classical
horsemanship that he had learned under a system that no longer exists,
and tailored them to the American riding scene," said Paula Rodenas of
Merrick, N.Y., an equestrian journalist and author of "The De Nemethy
Years," a 1983 book on his career.</TE>
<TE>   De Nemethy introduced riding methods that emphasized skill rather than
strength.</TE>
<TE>   "He raised the standards of the sport of show jumping throughout the
world, but particularly in the United States," said Raul DeLeon, a
freelance riding instructor and clinician, who arranged clinics for De
Nemethy in Virginia and Long Island.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Gyor, Hungary, De Nemethy grew up in a well-to-do family and
was inspired to go into the cavalry by his uncle, who was an officer.</TE>
<TE>   De Nemethy spent four years at the Ludovica Academy in Budapest and
graduated in 1932 as a lieutenant, later becoming a captain. He was a
member of the Hungarian equestrian team slated to ride in the 1940
Olympics, but the Games were canceled because of the war.</TE>
<TE>   De Nemethy was put in charge of cavalry cadets at the military academy
in 1944, and he led them to safety when the Russian army invaded
Budapest.</TE>
<TE>   After teaching in Denmark, he came to the United States in 1952. He
was recruited to coach the equestrian team in 1956 and became an American
citizen in 1958.</TE>
<TE>   Under his stewardship, the equestrian team, which was formed in 1950,
emerged as a top competitor in world-class show jumping, winning medals
at the Olympics, the Pan-American Games and European World Cup events. De
Nemethy won the U.S. Equestrian Federation's lifetime achievement award
and was installed in the Show Jumping Hall of Fame in Kentucky.</TE>
<TE>   Funeral arrangements were incomplete. His wife, Emily, whom he married
in 1965, died several years ago.</TE>

<HD>Richard Boeken, 57; Won Largest Tobacco Lawsuit</HD>

<LD>From a Times Staff Writer</LD>
<LD>   Richard Boeken, a lung cancer victim who won a record $100-million
damage award against cigarette maker Philip Morris last year, died
Wednesday at his home in Topanga. He was 57.</LD>
<LD>   The cause of death was cancer.</LD>
<TE>   Boeken began to smoke as a teenager more than 40 years ago, when
warning labels on cigarette packages were not common practice and TV ads
portrayed smokers as virile and cool.</TE>
<TE>   A self-employed dealer in oil and gas securities, he was diagnosed in
1999 with lung cancer that later spread to his brain.</TE>
<TE>   He sued Philip Morris, which made his favorite brand, Marlboro. Last
June, a Los Angeles jury ordered the tobacco giant to pay more than $3
billion in damages. A few months later, a judge reduced the award to $100
million, while upholding an additional $5.54 million in compensatory
damages. The $100 million is the largest judgment against a tobacco
company in a lawsuit by a single smoker.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for Philip Morris argued that Boeken should have been aware
of the dangers of smoking because of widespread anti-smoking publicity.
The company is appealing the award.</TE>
<TE>   But in his ruling, Superior Court Judge Charles W. McCoy Jr. said the
tobacco company's efforts to hide scientific information about the health
risks of smoking were "reprehensible in every sense of the word."</TE>
<TE>   He wrote that Philip Morris had failed to accept responsibility for
the "devastating and widespread" consequences of its conduct on people
like Boeken.</TE>
<TE>   Boeken is survived by his wife, Judy; their son, Dylan; stepsons
Damien and David Petralli; and three grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial will be held at 10 a.m. Monday at Kehillat Israel
Synagogue, 16019 Sunset Blvd., Pacific Palisades. The family requests
that any donations be made to the American Cancer Society.</TE>
