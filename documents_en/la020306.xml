<LD>On a recent afternoon, Peter Bogdanovich held court at the Peninsula
Hotel in Beverly Hills to talk about his new movie. Dressed in denim
and a blue and white checked shirt with a blue kerchief tied loosely
around his neck, Bogdanovich received a steady stream of journalists
and handlers at his corner table in the hotel's downstairs lunch
area.</LD>
<LD>   "It started 32 years ago," the director began the tale of "The
Cat's Meow," an "intimate thriller" that opens next month. Legendary
filmmaker Orson Welles told Bogdanovich the story of director Thomas
Ince's death in 1924 aboard the Oneida, a yacht owned by newspaper
tycoon William Randolph Hearst.</LD>
<LD>   Though Ince's death was attributed to natural causes, legend has
it that he was actually shot by Hearst, who mistook him for Charlie
Chaplin, the man he believed was having an affair with his longtime
mistress, Marion Davies. (Patricia Hearst's 1996 novel "Murder at San
Simeon" recounted the story of Ince's death aboard her grandfather's
yacht.)</LD>
<TE>   Although Bogdanovich thought it was an interesting story, he
forgot about it until years later, when, during a cruise on the Queen
Elizabeth II, he told movie critic Roger Ebert about it and suddenly
realized it might make a good movie.</TE>
<TE>   When he got back to New York, he was surprised to find an
unsolicited script about what had happened aboard the yacht waiting
on his desk.</TE>
<TE>   "Fate was telling me something," Bogdanovich said. And he decided
to make the movie.</TE>
<TE>   At first, he wanted Marlon Brando to play Hearst, but the actor
refused, saying simply, "I don't want to go up against Orson,"
referring to Welles' movie "Citizen Kane" based loosely on Hearst's
life.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Edward Herrmann was cast as Hearst--a character who is
"kind of a monster" and, at the same time, a "lovesick boy," said
Bogdanovich, adding that Herrmann makes him entirely likable.</TE>
<TE>   The movie took only 31 days to shoot and was primarily done in
Greece. "I love the Greeks," he said, although "they haven't really
gotten over the death of Homer."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to promoting "The Cat's Meow," Bogdanovich, 62, is at
work on a book about his encounters with motion picture greats.
Chaplin, whom he met briefly in 1972, "wasn't particularly funny in
conversation," he revealed. Brando, whom Bogdanovich met while the
actor was shooting "On the Waterfront," was "the first and only
person I've asked for an autograph."</TE>
<TE>   Formula for Success</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be big," said publisher Jason Binn about his new
publication when reached on his cell phone en route to Miami. Binn,
who's behind three upscale East Coast glossies, will launch his West
Coast vision, Los Angeles Confidential, on March 18, a week before
the Academy Awards.</TE>
<TE>   The 34-year-old Long Island native was slightly giddy as he
described his target demographic: "People in their mid-30s with a
high disposable income. The influencers," he revealed. "It's a great
time to target that group. The most glamorous, important [people]."</TE>
<TE>   With the recent demise of Talk and the resulting blow to synergy,
not to mention the uneven economy, this might seem like a risky time
to unveil a new magazine. But Binn's unfazed. Synergy? "How does that
apply to me?" he barked before patiently explaining that, unlike
Talk, he is not beholden to Miramax, though Los Angeles Confidential
will cover many Miramax parties--the hardest in town to get into, he
added. In addition, he plans to have "meaty features. Fun stuff,
gossipy stuff. Getting great people on the cover."</TE>
<TE>   His oeuvre already includes Hamptons Magazine on Long Island,
Ocean Drive in Miami and Gotham in New York, publications that, he
said, "celebrate the community."</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, I've created these brands that have been, kind of, the
local community Scotch tape."</TE>
<TE>   Gotham "has become a big thing," Binn said. "We're in all the
windows of Barneys," he added by way of explanation. That magazine
has a team of investigative journalists in addition to its fashion
correspondents, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Binn plans to be "continuing a formula I know and love" with his
L.A. magazine, which is envisioned as a monthly.</TE>
<TE>   What's the formula? "Taking what people know and love, and making
it hip or sexy. Taking stuff, that people, y'know, giving it, er,
making it, er, sexy and cool. And hip. You know what I mean. It's
kind of unique."</TE>
<TE>   Enough said.</TE>
<TE>   Welcome to L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Antidote to Despair</TE>
<TE>   "'I love you,'" Sting said by phone from his home in Britain, "is
a very profound statement when people are trying to kill each other."
He was talking about writing his Oscar-nominated love song, "Until
... " from the movie "Kate &amp; Leopold."</TE>
<TE>   "The fear and despondency we all felt [after Sept. 11]--the movie
was a total antidote to that. It's a very lighthearted romance, and I
was quite taken with it."</TE>
<TE>   Sting, who comes to Los Angeles next week to take part in events
leading up to the Academy Awards, said he was struck by a scene from
the film in which actors Meg Ryan and Hugh Jackman dance, and decided
to write an old-fashioned waltz.</TE>
<TE>   "Normally, when you're asked to do this kind of thing, it's part
of their marketing." This song, he said, was "radio proof"--he didn't
think it would get any airplay. And it didn't.</TE>
<TE>   It did win a Golden Globe award, and received an Oscar nomination.
"I'm thrilled," he said. "It's nice to be invited to the parties."</TE>
<TE>   Sting, who just completed a tour, is busy at work on his memoirs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not going to be one of those 'as told to,'" he said, adding,
"it's fascinating. Every memory dredges up another one. It's a stream
of consciousness, and I try to [translate] it into the English
language."</TE>
<TE>   The songwriter and former English teacher should be supremely
qualified.</TE>
<TE>   The Breakup File</TE>
<TE>   Edward James Olmos has filed for divorce from "The Sopranos" star
Lorraine Bracco in L.A. Superior Court, according to the New York
Daily News.</TE>
<TE>   Sightings</TE>
<TE>   Benicio del Toro, walking at the Santa Monica Promenade on
Saturday afternoon, with a companion whom he showered with affection.
According to an observer, "he was kissing her up and down the
Promenade."</TE>

<LD>It's March, and in case you didn't spot her, some kid is dressed like
a Girl Scout cookie and dancing along the boulevard, trying to drum
up sales of Thin Mints, Do-si-dos and Samoas. The dancing Samoa waves
to passing cars, a lesson in marketing and America, all in one
cookie.</LD>
<LD>   It's March, and in case you haven't noticed, it hasn't rained in
L.A. for about 40 days and 40 nights, and there's a fine layer of
dirt in the inlays of your front door and window panes, another sign
of global dusting.</LD>
<LD>   It's March, and the apple trees have blossomed a month too soon.</LD>
<TE>   It's March, and in case you haven't noticed, they're holding
tomato classes down at the gardening center, where the topics of the
hour are compost and gypsum.</TE>
<TE>   "Is this the tomato class?" asks my friend Shaughnessy, who
wanders in late, like a leprechaun headed for algebra class.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, it ain't the Super Bowl," I tell him.</TE>
<TE>   It's March, and in case you didn't see him, my friend Paul was
pricing baseball gloves the other day and ran across a deerskin
model, soft as clover. The price: $229. Which ought to buy you Bambi.</TE>
<TE>   "I could afford that," Paul says, "if we just went without food
for a couple of weeks."</TE>
<TE>   "Eating is overrated," I assure him.</TE>
<TE>   It's March, and the rains will resume soon, probably on Opening
Day.</TE>
<TE>   It's March, and as you might've heard, they had the Grammys
recently, reminding us that the music world is increasingly inhabited
by one-hit wonders and that those Alicia Keys CDs will probably wind
up on the bargain rack in two years, along with the Lauryn Hill and
Fiona Apple ones no one buys.</TE>
<TE>   It's March, and L.A. sometimes seems like a singles' club with 15
million members, all waiting to meet that special someone, preferably
with a special car and a special sitcom deal.</TE>
<TE>   It's March, and Britney Spears has a new movie out, further reason
to stay out in the sun and break in your new baseball glove.</TE>
<TE>   The deerskin one, 229 bucks.</TE>
<TE>   It's March, and in case you haven't noticed, we haven't had a fire
in the fireplace in about a month, and the only thing burning late
into the night is the kids' homework, which gets harder every week.</TE>
<TE>   So I sit on the couch going over the battle of Lexington and
Concord with some kid who doesn't seem as enthralled with this
historic gem as she should be.</TE>
<TE>   "But you've got Paul Revere," I remind the little girl.</TE>
<TE>   "So?"</TE>
<TE>   "You've got 'One if by land,'" I say.</TE>
<TE>   "So?"</TE>
<TE>   "Wasn't that a Sandra Bullock movie?" her mother says.</TE>
<TE>   "Your mother really knows her history," I say.</TE>
<TE>   It's March, and while you were sleeping, your teenager grew 3
inches taller, 10 pounds heavier and now has three stomachs, one each
for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</TE>
<TE>   It's March, and no one has the time to look anyone in the eye
anymore, which probably isn't anything to worry about. Probably not
important at all.</TE>
<TE>   It's March, and for the first time in memory, no one I know is
discussing the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition or the Los Angeles
Dodgers--two lost causes, the naked and the dead.</TE>
<TE>   It's March, and don't you wonder what Chick Hearn has to say about
Kobe right now, and what is Larry Bird up to these days anyway, and I
don't care if Michael Jordan plays till he's 80, he'd still be a
better draw than some punk rookie two months out of grade school.</TE>
<TE>   It's March, and "Monday Night Football" has never seemed more
promising, with Al Michaels and John Madden as America's latest dream
team. Do you believe in miracles?</TE>
<TE>   Yes.</TE>
<TE>   It's March, and in case you haven't noticed, the full moon last
week was the kind they used to write songs about, and even days
afterward it still hits your eye like a big pizza pie, that's amore.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to go there sometime," says the little girl.</TE>
<TE>   "Where?"</TE>
<TE>   "The moon," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "Lotsa luck," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "I really want to go there, Dad," she insists.</TE>
<TE>   It's March, and in case you haven't noticed, a lot of the children
are sounding a little like Jimmy Stewart, optimistic but in a
pleasant sort of way. That's not such an awful thing, a little Capra
in a kid.</TE>
<TE>   "Want to play some catch, Dad?" the boy asks, an old baseball
glove in his hand, 39 bucks and soft as clover.</TE>
<TE>   "Always," I say.</TE>
<TE>   In case you haven't noticed, it's spring.</TE>

<HD>Traffic Has Flair for Dramatic</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY McNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you don't have a fondness for hyperbole, or, at the very least,
superlatives, then you're living in the wrong city. And certainly,
you're driving in the wrong city. Because if nothing else, driving in
L.A. forces even the least literary among us to stretch their poetic
borders. Metaphor and simile, hyperbole, narrative omniscience and
anthropomorphism are as necessary as brake lights, turn signals and
A/C when it comes to surviving the average commute.</LD>
<LD>   "Around me rages an inferno of brake lights," one friend told me
over his cell phone. "It's brake and bake out there," my brother said
of a particularly bad summer's eve. Traffic is typically
"unbelievable," "horrendous," "unbearable," or, on the other side of
the descriptor list, "miraculous." The 10 is a parking lot, 3rd
Street is a nightmare, the 605 the seventh level of hell. Our fellow
drivers are sometimes maniacs, lunatics, kamikazes, but often they
are simply identified by whatever type of (expletive deleted) car
they're driving. "I gotta Beamer on a cell phone with a latte in his
lap who will not let me pass," says another friend from the 405.
"I'll call you back."</LD>
<TE>   And that's just the extemporaneous. Our local vernacular is
already littered with SigAlerts (for years I thought this meant
traffic so bad that if you didn't have cigarettes, you better get
some), carbeques (a car on fire), slow and go, and freeway locations
known as the Orange Crush, the South Bay Curve, the Four Level and
the El Toro Y.</TE>
<TE>   "Here, if anywhere, I seem to hear the coming footsteps of the
muses," W.B. Yeats said on a visit to Los Angeles. That was in 1925,
15 years before the first freeway opened. A few decades later and he
would have known it was the coming four-wheel drive of the muses that
he heard.</TE>
<TE>   No other literary device is as overused as the superlative.
According to conventional wisdom, if not the actual data, Los Angeles
has the worst traffic in the country. (Not so. Commuters in New York,
Chicago and San Francisco have it worse, according to the Census
Bureau.) And every driver seems to know the best cross-town route,
the easiest way to get to Long Beach, the worst time of day to be on
the 101.</TE>
<TE>   Part of this is the natural human tendency to "know" what's best,
worst and impossible, but it's also a very Angeleno tendency toward
the dramatic. Most of us need to smite the dashboard once a week or
so and utter sweeping statements such as, "My God, I cannot bear to
live in this sun-scorched town for one more minute" while all around
the sky is a Fragonard blue, the jacaranda is in bloom and the
traffic on Santa Monica is just a little slow like it always is.</TE>
<TE>   I recently found myself striking my steering wheel in deliciously
self-righteous frustration and announcing to the empty car seats
behind me that the left-hand turn off 3rd Street onto Fairfax Avenue
is the absolute worst in the city. Possibly the world. Despite the
constant onslaught of traffic, there is no green arrow, which means
that only one car--two if a daredevil is at the wheel--can make the
turn per light. I have sat for as long as 20 minutes. And I still
defy anyone to beat it. If you know of a worse one, e-mail me. I will
personally test the top three candidates I get. And if I'm wrong
about 3rd and Fairfax, I'll cop to it, and the winner will receive
the quiet satisfaction of having proven a newspaper columnist wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, we'll all find solace in our own vivid diatribes, our
own climactic monologues, our own shreds of poetry dragged from the
white glitter of windshields, the opera-length string of headlights,
the hot gasp of a city moving into the future.</TE>

<LD>Many of you are familiar with the nursery rhyme "Baa, Baa Black
Sheep." You probably have even heard that counting sheep helps you
fall asleep. But have you ever touched a sheep and felt its soft,
woolly coat?</LD>
<LD>   If not, you can visit the Los Angeles Zoo where the newest
residents of the Winnick Family Children's Zoo are four sheep named
Meg, Beth, Jo and Amy. They have joined the zoo's goats in a contact
yard where you can get up close to these domesticated animals.</LD>
<LD>   The sheep are adjusting nicely to their new home and beginning to
make friends with the goats. Like the goats, they are friendly if
visitors remember to be gentle while touching them. They can get
frightened if people grab at them or startle them by moving too
quickly.</LD>
<TE>   The four female sheep were born last August and have been
hand-raised by zoo animal keepers. They were bottle-fed with goat's
milk the first few months, then switched to a diet of alfalfa hay and
herbivore pellets. These youngsters, fed twice a day, will weigh
about 90 pounds when they become adults at 2 to 3 years of age.</TE>
<TE>   Domestic sheep originated in Europe. They were brought to this
country by Christopher Columbus during his second trip to the New
World in 1493. They have local wild relatives called desert bighorn
sheep that are native to the mountains of Southern California. The
male bighorn have horns that are three times bigger than that of the
male domesticated sheep.</TE>
<TE>   If you visit Meg, Beth, Jo and Amy at the Los Angeles Zoo, you can
see the desert bighorn sheep exhibit to see how these two species of
sheep compare. Learn more about the zoo by visiting its Web site at
www.lazoo.org.</TE>
<TE>   This information was provided by Judy Shay at the Los Angeles Zoo,
located in Griffith Park at the juncture of the 134 and 5 freeways.
For more zoo information, call (323) 644-6400.</TE>

<HD>Have We Been Giving Short Shrift to Loyalty?</HD>
<DH>Some say that if we don't show that we value that virtue,
it will cease to exist.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL OLLOVE</AU>
<BD>BALTIMORE SUN</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you've been paying attention to the news, you've no doubt noticed
that one virtue in particular has been taking a drubbing lately. To
say the least, these have not been proud days for loyalty, and
American Taliban John Walker Lindh is only one glaring example.</LD>
<LD>   Enron, the "Mommie Dearest" of corporations, treated its employees
like dupes in a con game. And some companies have no shame about
squeezing localities for handouts in good times while shipping jobs
overseas in bad.</LD>
<LD>   According to a recent survey, fewer than half of the employees of
American companies believe their employer merits loyalty. The mania
for the better deal has become the Holy Grail of an era. Hot young
MBAs jump from company to company with the fidelity of a lothario.
Doctors and patients barely stay together long enough to get lab
results back.   Hey, even American spies aren't what they used to be.
Julius Rosenberg, remember, was at least a true believer in the cause
of communism. What did Aldrich Ames and Robert Hanssen sell out for?
Nothing but money, baby.</LD>
<TE>   What's going on here? Moral malaise? Mass commitment phobia? Or is
it, as in the view of Robert P. Lawry, director of the Center for
Professional Ethics at Case Western University, a generalized
shallowness, a shared attention-deficit disorder that results in
"this whole lack of stick-to-itiveness?"</TE>
<TE>   No and no and no.</TE>
<TE>   It's far too simple to suggest that we're not the men and women we
were, that, for instance, we're not worthy to occupy the same
ecosystem as the Greatest Generation, supposedly the paragons of
loyal behavior. Before we sell our own corner of eternity short on
the loyalty meter, think no further back than Sept. 11 and the
extraordinary acts of selflessness and devotion on that terrible day.
"The premise of diminished loyalty has some appeal but is seriously
flawed," says J.F. Watts, dean of humanities and the arts at the City
College of New York.</TE>
<TE>   Look around, Watts notes; acts of loyalty are apparent everywhere.
Does anyone  believe parents today are any less self-sacrificing when
it comes to their children? Are alumni less passionate about their
colleges? Are citizens of New York--or many other locales--any less
fervent about their city?</TE>
<TE>   OK, so let's accept that we're still capable of loyalty. Great. Or
is it great? If someone is described as "loyal," the assumption is
that a compliment has been made. But sometimes, loyalty is not all
it's cracked up to be.</TE>
<TE>   Loyalty is one of our more complicated virtues. It cannot be
evaluated without context, unlike, say, some of the other
characteristics of the archetype Boy Scout. Like bravery. It's hard
to imagine how courage could be deemed anything but an unalloyed,
positive attribute. Same with kindness. And when are courtesy,
cheerfulness or cleanliness unwelcome?</TE>
<TE>   But loyalty demands qualification. Loyalty to whom or to what?
Didn't those who herded the innocent into gas chambers regard
themselves as loyal soldiers of National Socialism?</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing that makes loyalty logical is a set of principles
and the people and the institutions who embody those principles,"
says Frederick Reichheld, a sort of guru of loyalty in the business
world. "You don't stay married to a spouse who beats you up every
morning. That's abuse. Unthinking loyalty to a leader who is cheating
customers and investors, that makes no sense at all."</TE>
<TE>   But for the right cause, loyalty can be a ferocious incentive.
Just ask the soldiers on whom the story of "Black Hawk Down" was
based.  They risked everything to rescue their comrades in Somalia.
Less dramatically,  Reichheld argues in his book "Loyalty Rules!"
that loyalty--to customers and to employees--is the pathway to
prosperity.</TE>
<TE>   The companies thriving today, even in this sluggish economy, are
those who elevate loyalty to a fundamental business practice.
According to Reichheld, companies such as Southwest Airlines and Dell
Computers place the utmost importance on lasting, mutually beneficial
relationships with employees and customers. Loyalty, he says, breeds
success for all.</TE>
<TE>   Reichheld says far too few companies understand the link between
loyalty and success. And they fail to understand how powerful the
impulse for loyalty is in human nature.</TE>
<TE>   "Loyalty hasn't changed in this country," says Eugene C.
Grochowski, a Johns Hopkins medical professor who teaches at the
school's Bioethics Institute. "What has happened is that the cost of
maintaining loyalty has become so enormous that loyalty can't win."</TE>
<TE>   Some worry that if the rules become so weighted against loyalty
and commitment, then loyalty  will become devalued as a virtue.</TE>
<TE>   As Grochowski says, "If we say we can't afford loyalty because it
costs us millions of dollars, then the next stop might be to say
loyalty isn't all that important anyway."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, if we don't value loyalty, it'll cease to exist.</TE>

<HD>Exploring the Landscape of the Mind</HD>
<DH>Books*  Novelist  Susan Minot's  'Rapture' takes place
during a sex act but examines the  characters' recollections.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHLEEN CRAUGHWELL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Susan Minot likes to quote novelist and famous wit William Gass when
discussing the challenge of her recently published novella,
"Rapture," which painstakingly describes an intimate act between two
former lovers: "Words become embarrassed in the presence of sex."</LD>
<LD>   Words, it turns out, aren't the only ones. A bespectacled woman of
a certain age, who is among those who have gathered at Book Soup in
West Hollywood recently to hear Minot read from "Rapture," gingerly
asks the author if all her books are about sex. Minot gently explains
that the book, like her four previous works, is more about
relationships than sex.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier that day, relaxing poolside at the Santa Monica cottage of
her sister, film producer Dinah Minot Hubley, Minot, 45, laughs when
recounting the reactions she's gotten to "Rapture."</LD>
<TE>   "There's this little frisson around sex that people sort of blush
about. When people discover that the book takes place during the time
that two people are having sex, they get all sort of titillated and
embarrassed and then they read it and they think, 'Oh, well, it's not
really pornographic at all.'"</TE>
<TE>   The book, you see, takes place during a single act of oral sex,
but the bulk of the narrative is composed of the separate and, at
times, conflicting recollections of Kay and Benjamin, the two parties
involved.</TE>
<TE>   "I chose that particular act because both the characters can be in
a pensive state of mind. If they were doing a different kind of sex
they wouldn't be able to follow thoughts in this sort of drifting
way. It's really about what's going on in their minds and how they're
trying to justify their behavior."</TE>
<TE>   The landscape of the mind is not unfamiliar territory for Minot.
Her last novel, the critically acclaimed "Evening," focused on the
reverie and melancholy memories of a woman on her deathbed recalling
her one true love. Even as "Evening" paired so well with Minot's
debut work, the autobiographical "Monkeys," about the devastating
effect of a mother's death on a close-knit Massachusetts family,
Minot agrees that "Rapture" continues the theme of her second book,
"Lust and Other Stories."</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely a furthering. You could have taken some of those
['Lust'] characters, who were in their 20s, and moved them up into
their 30s and saw where they had not progressed" in terms of their
approaches to romantic relationships.</TE>
<TE>   And for Minot, writing about sex and, as the title indicates,
sexual rapture was akin to writing about the physical pain of disease
that she described in "Evening."</TE>
<TE>   "They're both sort of unspeakable," she says. "One of the impulses
to write is to try to put words around something that's out there in
my experience, and the effort to do that, when you can nail [the
experience] down, is very satisfying. It not only stops it in time
but it, a little bit, transforms it. And that is one of the
pleasures, one of the few pleasures, of writing."</TE>
<TE>   Minot (pronounced MY-nut), a lithe blond with a penchant for
unfussy silver jewelry, was born to a large, well-to-do Boston family
and was raised in Manchester, a seaside Massachusetts town. She
attended the prestigious Concord Academy (Minot was one of schoolmate
Caroline Kennedy's bridesmaids) before studying creative writing at
Brown and then, as a graduate student, at Columbia.</TE>
<TE>   Although known as a thoroughly modern writer, Minot has some
old-fashioned quirks. She not only writes her first drafts longhand,
but she also uses a quill and dipped ink--"It sort of looks nicer,
and it makes my words look better"--and then types the second and
many other drafts (Minot will typically revise a book 10 or even 15
times) on a manual typewriter.</TE>
<TE>   It's a low-tech habit that suited her early bohemian writer's life
of working in borrowed apartments and cabins and beach bungalows.
Minot, who has a 3-month-old daughter, lives on an island in Maine
with the baby's father--she has to take a ferry to the mainland to
shop. She is working these days on a theatrical adaptation of "The
Little Locksmith," a 1943 memoir by Katharine Butler Hathaway that
has recently been reissued by Feminist Press.</TE>
<TE>   The play takes the form of a monologue told by Katharine, who was
born in 1890. She was diagnosed with tuberculosis of the spine at age
5 and, as treatment, was strapped to a bed for 10 years. "The
treatment worked for the most part, except that she didn't grow
beyond the size of a 10-year-old, but she ends up having this
interesting literary life, she gets married and she has sort of a
bohemian life in Paris," Minot says.</TE>
<TE>   In May, Minot's first poetry collection, "Poems 4 a.m.," will be
published. "I've always written poems, and I had so many that were
piled up, I started to feel like, 'Maybe I can put some of these
together,' though I definitely was kind of intimidated by the poetry
that I would read. You know, it's very sophisticated, the poetry
being written today. There's a certain, I would say, obtuseness, to
it, and most of the poems I write are very easily graspable."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Minot has experimented in almost every genre of writing.
She wrote the screenplay for Bernardo Bertolucci's 1996 film
"Stealing Beauty" and has adapted her "Evening" for the screen (the
project is currently with the New York film production company Hart
Sharpe). She also writes travel stories, but her most recent
nonfiction work was a harrowing account for the quarterly journal
McSweeney's of children in northern Uganda being kidnapped from their
villages by rebel forces and conscripted.</TE>
<TE>   Still, literary fiction remains her favorite outlet. "One of the
reasons I write, and it's not necessarily true with all writers, is
to get away from myself.</TE>
<TE>   And there is a kind of disappearance of the self when you're
really concentrating on whatever it is you're working on. The less I
recognize myself and the more it goes away from me, the more pleased
I am."</TE>

<HD>'Push Parenting' Your Kid Right Over the Edge</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETH COONEY</AU>
<BD>STAMFORD ADVOCATE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You may be the kind of parent who is content with your perfectly
imperfect children. It may actually be OK for you that your
preschooler can't read yet or your high school junior barely broke a
1,000 on the SATs. Maybe all you want is for them to be reasonably
smart, healthy and to occasionally clean their rooms.</LD>
<LD>   Yet sometimes a nagging voice creeps in, asking if I'm doing
enough. Especially when the parents in your 2-year-old's preschool
are lobbying for computers in the classrooms. Or the other soccer
moms compare notes on shuffling their A-plus offspring from ballet to
tutors to cello lessons.</LD>
<LD>   "Even when you are OK with normal, you can't help but feel the
pressure," says Elisabeth Guthrie. "You may be a perfectly
well-adjusted parent. But it's going to make you doubt yourself if
everyone else around you seems to be pushing their kids."</LD>
<TE>   Guthrie, clinical director of the Learning Diagnostic Center at
the Blythedale Children's Hospital in Valhalla, N.Y., urges parents
to avoid the traps and pressures of expecting their kids to
overachieve in her new book, "The Trouble with Perfect" (Broadway
Books).</TE>
<TE>   Guthrie, who co-wrote the book with Kathy Matthews, says she has
become increasingly concerned about the number of burned out,
distressed kids she is treating. She views them as victims of what
she calls "push parenting."</TE>
<TE>   They include teenagers such as Maya, a 14-year-old whom Guthrie
counseled after her mother gave the teen a nose job for her birthday.
Maya didn't want the surgery but was afraid of disappointing her
family. Then there  was the mom who wanted to write her son's college
essays.</TE>
<TE>   Even though Guthrie thinks they are doing their children a
disservice, the mother of three says she empathizes with the
pressures to push and prod. "I didn't write this book to make parents
feel guilty or encourage them to let their kids do nothing but play
video games," says Guthrie. "I just wanted to let parents know
there's nothing wrong with you if your instinct is to let your
children be who they are."</TE>
<TE>   Guthrie says she was inspired to write the book by a group of
parents of children she treats at Blythedale, some of whom have
suffered serious trauma and have disabilities that limit their
academic and physical potential. "I find it remarkable that these are
parents who are able to find balance and fulfillment," she says.
"They still have the ability to see their children's special gifts
and make their kids fell great about themselves."</TE>
<TE>   This positive parenting was in marked contrast to the parents of
so-called normal kids Guthrie was seeing in her private practice,
who, she says, "were struggling with so much doubt and low
self-esteem."</TE>
<TE>   To help parents sort through some of the dilemmas they are facing,
Guthrie deals with perfection pressures that begin during gestation
and continue through the college years. Here are some of her
observations:</TE>
<TE>   * Birth and infancy: Guthrie encourages parents of newborns and
toddlers to let their kids develop at their own pace. She takes issue
with prospective parents blasting Mozart at their pregnant bellies
and signing their infants up for developmental classes.</TE>
<TE>   She says studies looking at the benefits of the so-called Mozart
effect are shaky at best, and movement and music classes for babies
are "more for the benefit of the parents than the child." "If you
recognize that those classes are parent-centered rather than
child-centered, that's fine. But if you go expecting your child to
perform, you're already in trouble."</TE>
<TE>   * The toddler years: Guthrie says many parents start to worry,
needlessly, if their child is the last in a play group to walk or
talk. Yet they are buying French tapes for their 2-year-olds and
vying for spots in the "best" preschools. Guthrie says worries about
school readiness are premature. "The focus should be on whether
[preschools and day-care centers] are safe, well-supervised and
happy," Guthrie says. "They should be playing, not doing algebra
yet."</TE>
<TE>   * The grade school years: While Guthrie supports parents
introducing their children to sports and enriching activities such as
dance and music lessons, she urges parents not to be too intense. "If
your child wants to quit piano, it should be OK," she says. "The most
important question you should be asking about any activity they
engage in is, are they developmentally appropriate," advises Guthrie,
who says grade-school kids, with the exception of self-motivated
prodigies, should be spending no more than 15 minutes of their free
time each day practicing sports, music or dance.</TE>
<TE>   * Middle and high school years: It's an unfortunate fallout of
push parenting that your high schooler really can't take the SATs
these days without taking some kind of preparatory course, says
Guthrie. "I don't like that it's become an industry, but I wouldn't
say don't do it," she says. "I can't give any advice that would put
your child at a distinct disadvantage."</TE>
<TE>   That said, Guthrie urges parents to relax, noting in her book that
as college admissions become more competitive, it will only enhance
the cachet of second- and third-tier schools. "We really have to get
that not all of our kids are headed for the Ivy League," she says.</TE>

<LD>In the 1950s, secretary Bette Nesmith Graham was fed up with the new
electric typewriters at the office. When she put her fingers on the
keys, the machine jumped into action, typing lots of letters she
didn't want. Erasing the mistakes created a big mess. But she was in
her 20s, and since her divorce, she needed her job at Texas Bank and
Trust in Dallas to support herself and her young son. Graham was also
an artist. She worked part time painting windows at the bank.</LD>
<LD>   One time she brushed paint in the wrong spot. What to do? Wash it
off? Start over? Why not just paint over it, she thought. So she did.
And then she got the idea: Why not just paint over mistakes at the
office too? Her challenge was to create a quick-drying paint. It
later became known as Liquid Paper.</LD>
<TE>   After reading books at the library and talking to her son's
chemistry teacher, she experimented at home. When she first took her
paint to work, it was her secret. Then one of her bosses noticed and
asked her not to put any of that "white stuff" on his letters. The
other secretaries thought differently. They wanted some for
themselves. While continuing at her job, she improved her paint and
also began selling it to her co-workers and to office supply stores.
To fill orders, she and her son, Michael (who would later become part
of the musical group the Monkees), mixed up the batches of paint in
their kitchen, poured it into small bottles and trimmed the tiny
brushes, all by hand. Since she couldn't afford a patent, she gained
a trademark to protect her product.</TE>
<TE>   By 1957 she was selling several hundred bottles per month. In 1962
after she married Robert Graham, a man with experience in sales, she
traveled with him selling her product across the Southwest. Six years
later the company broke a record with an order for 40,000 bottles in
one week. In 1979 Bette Graham sold the company to the Gillette Co.
for $47.5 million. The next year, when she died, she left half her
money to her son and the other half to foundations that award grants
to women in business and the arts. She was aware of the difficulties
people face in starting and running a business. "I think anyone who
is making progress faces fear," she once said. "Overcoming fear is
all there is to success."</TE>

<DH>L.A. youngsters take cameras to South Africa and return
with a sobering view of world problems and an appreciation for life
in America.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEVERLY BEYETTE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With cameras around their necks and a mandate to photograph whatever
intrigued them, they went off for two weeks to document life in South
Africa from their perspective--that of 8- to 16-year-old urban Los
Angeles kids.</LD>
<LD>   They came home with stunning images--of AIDS orphans, the
homeless, anti-American protesters, abject poverty. Not the stuff of
tourist brochures. They came home, too, with a renewed appreciation
for what they have and how they live--and a surprisingly mature take
on excessive consumerism and the shallowness of looking good and
wearing the right labels.</LD>
<LD>   The six youngsters were among 7,000 delegates from 166 countries
at the Third World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination,
Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, held in August and September in
Durban, a seaport on the east coast of South Africa. Now they are
sharing what they learned and saw by participating in community photo
exhibits and school programs.</LD>
<TE>   The Los Angeles kids, chosen for their photographic skills and
their ability to work with others, represented the Venice Arts Mecca,
a nonprofit organization that brings volunteer artists together with
youngsters from low-income families to nurture their creativity in
areas ranging from literary arts to photography.</TE>
<TE>   They looked. They listened. They photographed. And they took notes
for their journals.</TE>
<TE>   I interviewed a guy from Sri Lanka. His name was King Ratnaw. He
was with the Young Asia Television. He is in the minority community,
so they get kicked around a lot. In his country, kids don't fight
with words, they fight with guns.</TE>
<TE>   --Eamon Wright, 13, Lincoln</TE>
<TE>   Middle School, Santa Monica</TE>
<TE>   Before embarking on their adventure, the kids--who were joined by
two young people from Washington, D.C., and accompanied by adult
mentors--studied the sociopolitical history of South Africa,
including apartheid. All were Latino or African American or a mix of
the two, and were encouraged to think about their own identity, their
own experiences with racism.</TE>
<TE>   One of my favorite parts was when we saw an albino. All the black
people (Zulu dancers at the opening ceremony) were letting him in the
group. They weren't leaving him out.</TE>
<TE>   --Rae Wright, 8, Canyon</TE>
<TE>   Elementary School,</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Palisades</TE>
<TE>   At the conference exhibit hall, the L.A. kids mounted a photo
exhibition showing the underbelly of America. There were bleak images
of life on an Indian reservation, of the homeless in Los Angeles. It
was an eye-opener to some South Africans, who thought everyone in
America was rich. "They were absolutely shocked," said Lynn
Warshafsky, executive director of Venice Arts Mecca</TE>
<TE>   In turn, the L.A. group was surprised at the degree of
anti-American sentiment, something they had to process. "They had to
ask themselves questions they'd never asked before" about how others
see them, Warshafsky said.</TE>
<TE>   I am a very lucky kid. I have a nice house and a good family. What
else could a kid want?</TE>
<TE>   --Michael Linarte, 11, Coeur</TE>
<TE>   D'Alene Elementary</TE>
<TE>   School, Venice</TE>
<TE>   An exhibition of their photographs will open Thursday  at Los
Angeles City Hall in the rotunda adjacent to the council chambers.
Another exhibition is planned at the Social Public Art Resource
Center in Venice in late April. The Los Angeles Human Relations
Commission, primary funder of the trip, is printing a catalog of the
South Africa photographs together with L.A. images--among these Skid
Row, a Culver City mosque, Chinatown--shot by the six and others who
have since joined the project. It will have limited distribution in
late April.</TE>
<TE>   The concept behind the trip and the subsequent exhibits, said
Warshafsky, was "not only to educate this small group of kids, but to
bring that back to create dialogue." Through school assemblies and
workshops, they "will help others explore issues of community."</TE>
<TE>   They returned home shortly before Sept. 11. For some, the
terrorist attacks put the trip in focus because they had seen
firsthand evidence of anti-American passions. On their return, they
were dismayed by the lack of interest shown by schoolmates in their
South African adventure. But after Sept. 11, with renewed classroom
emphasis on current events, they saw that change somewhat.</TE>
<TE>   I said, "Guess where I went--South Africa," and they said, "So?"
Now they're finally interested. "You went to South Africa? That's
really cool." Still, they can't show how interested they really are
because they're afraid what other people will think of them.</TE>
<TE>   --Eamon Wright</TE>
<TE>   For Delisa Alejandra, 13, the most abiding memory of the trip was
a visit to an open market and "how they chopped up [livestock] in
front of everybody." Delisa was amused when people "asked us what we
were. They didn't know we were Mexican. They were like, 'What?' and
surprised to learn [we] were not black."</TE>
<TE>   For Eamon, the highlight was hearing Fidel Castro speak. "I had
thought of him as seriously evil. I realized he's not evil, he's
doing what he thinks is best. He has this sort of demeanor about him.
Whether you like him or not, you respect him. It opened my eyes."</TE>
<TE>   Security was tight at the conference site--lots of barbed wire and
soldiers with assault rifles and machine guns. Michael remembers
"when the riot control people let us into their armored vehicle. It
was kind of cool. They were really nice."</TE>
<TE>   He recalls, too, being caught up in a heated argument that broke
out among a Palestinian, a Hasidic rabbi and a Holocaust survivor
from Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Justin Hill, 16, a student at Westside Leadership Magnet School in
Marina del Rey, also walked into that conflict and introduced himself
to a Hasidic Jew. "He told me his group is against Zionism, which
means he's against the Israeli treatment of Palestinians. Then an
Israeli woman sort of pushed me to the side and called him a traitor,
and said it was his parents and grandparents who were killed by
Hitler."</TE>
<TE>   One early afternoon, the group happened upon a men's drinking
party in a garage in a Zulu township. The Americans were astonished
when one of the men came forward and asked, "Why isn't Colin Powell
coming--because he doesn't want to come or George Bush doesn't want
him to come?" (President Bush did not send the first African American
secretary of state, even though Powell had said he wanted to go.)
Fielding the question were Justin Hill and mentor-chaperon Tom
Wright, father of Rae and Eamon.</TE>
<TE>   "We were trying to say it wasn't his decision to make, that he was
appointed by Bush. We talked about that for a long time."</TE>
<TE>   In Kwa-Mashu township, the L.A. youngsters partnered with young
South Africans, tutoring them in photography. Selena Vargas, 17, a
student at Venice Skills Center, partnered with a young woman named
Sia. She took Selena with her to a friend's wedding. It was a
bittersweet occasion. The bride's father had died just days before
but, in keeping with Zulu custom, the wedding went on.</TE>
<TE>   For all, the visit to the Ark, a homeless shelter in a township
near Durban, which also cares for AIDS patients, was a riveting and
sobering experience.</TE>
<TE>   They had two AIDS rooms and one sick room. The smell was so
intense, 10 times worse than on Skid Row. I saw a lady who'd had both
of her legs amputated.</TE>
<TE>   --Delisa Alejandra, St. Anne's</TE>
<TE>   School, Santa Monica</TE>
<TE>   Eamon described it as "really shocking. People had been swept off
the streets just for the conference and would be kicked out of the
place after it was over. There were kids that were just months old."</TE>
<TE>   In the middle of "all this weird darkness," he saw a kitten
playing with a ball of yarn. "After all this gloom and sadness, there
was a good side."</TE>
<TE>   The young photographers were surprised at how polite everyone was
to them as they traveled from township to township.</TE>
<TE>   Once, they stopped to ask directions to their bed-and-breakfast
inn, and strangers spent half an hour directing them there. "If you
asked in L.A.," said Delisa, "they'd give you wrong directions."</TE>
<TE>   But they also came home with impressions of a different kind. They
saw drugs being sold openly on the streets. And there was what Delisa
calls "the bathroom incident. A guy tried to touch me. He was old and
ugly and he was touching my thigh."</TE>
<TE>   She learned how young girls are being raped by HIV-positive Zulu
men, who "think if they have intercourse with a virgin, [the virus]
will go away."</TE>
<TE>   The young Angelenos were surprised at how, thanks largely to the
Internet, most South Africans are up to date on what's going on in
the world--in sharp contrast, they noted, to many of their
self-absorbed schoolmates at home.</TE>
<TE>   Delisa said the trip "opened my eyes to how much the United States
has. We overdo it and we buy stuff we don't need." It brought home to
Rae that "we're not the only people in the world."</TE>
<TE>   Selena said, "I don't take anything for granted anymore. You see
so many people struggling. Everything they've gone through, I don't
think we could go through over here."</TE>
<TE>   The kids have been invited back to Kwa-Mashu township in December,
and Venice Arts Mecca leaders hope to raise the funds to send a
group.</TE>
<TE>   They are also exploring the possibility of having a performing
arts group from Kwa-Mashu come here.</TE>
<TE>   Human Relations Commission project director Michelle Marsh, who
was on the trip, said of the young ambassadors, "Going to South
Africa almost made them more American. They were not seen as what
they're labeled as here," Latino or African American or whatever.
"There's no stigma."</TE>
<TE>   The commission paid about half of the $27,000 cost of the trip,
with the rest being made up through fund-raisers and grants. It does
not look at the trip as a single event, Marsh said, but as the
starting point for a yearlong program.</TE>
<TE>   "They will have this rich, rich wealth of a journey that they will
savor and treasure the rest of their lives," said Warshafsky. "And
now they have a thirst for it."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The world's car makers, and their customers, no longer are satisfied
with the basics: passenger car for people, truck for cargo and
towing, and an off-road model or two for the few brave souls who
aren't afraid that gravel will ding their paint.</LD>
<LD>   Today's market requires luxury and near-luxury cars and trucks,
crossovers, sporty wagons, wagony-coupes, hatchbacks and
high-performance versions of all.</LD>
<LD>   As usual, the annual Geneva auto show, which opens to the public
Thursday and runs through the 17th, and the New York auto show,
running from March 29 to April 7, are good for a glimpse of things to
come.</LD>
<TE>   And Porsche on Tuesday finally let us in on what its first SUV,
the Cayenne, will look like.</TE>
<TE>   Two vehicles sharing the limelight at Geneva are Volkswagen's
Phaeton and Chrysler's topless PT Cruiser. The first is the answer to
a question few have asked: When is VW going to do a luxury car? The
second hopes to answer one that is frequently asked: How do you stoke
new interest in a fading pop star?</TE>
<TE>   And at the New York show, Nissan will show what it is doing to
move beyond fast passenger cars and supercharged trucks and SUVs. We
have only a rendering to share, but it clearly illustrates that
Nissan's stylists are having a field day with the 2004 Murano, a
large crossover sport wagon built on the same platform as the new
2003 Altima and the upcoming '04 Maxima and Quest.</TE>
<TE>   Chrysler's convertible Cruiser is a bid to rebuild interest in a
retro-styled car-cum-panel truck that buyers at first couldn't get
enough of but that now is seen by some as growing tired and
predictable. With Chrysler already supplying a flame-bedecked hot-rod
Cruiser and a faux-wood-covered beach buggy Cruiser, a factory
convertible (two Orange County companies already do custom Cruiser
convertibles) was only a matter of time.</TE>
<TE>   Chrysler officials say they expect the topless PT Cruiser to help
the company boost its 15% share of the U.S. convertible market.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, Chrysler officials used the Geneva show to announce
that the company plans to build 20,000 boat-tailed, two-seat
Crossfire sport coupes for release next year as a 2004 model.
Although the car will be built in Germany as part of a
platform-sharing program with Mercedes-Benz, the other half of
DaimlerChrysler, most will be sold in the U.S., officials said.</TE>
<TE>   At Volkswagen, they are heading in the opposite direction of the
Beetle and other cars that made the brand an icon of affordability.
The German auto maker's Phaeton is a $50,000 to $85,000 VW intended
to take the once-humble brand to stratospheric heights.</TE>
<TE>   It will be VW's most muscular car, available with a W-12 gasoline
engine (think of side-by-side V-6s) or a V-10 that is the world's
most powerful passenger-car diesel engine. Four-wheel air suspension
and a four-zone climate control system are standard, and VW's 4Motion
four-wheel-drive system will come with the 10- and 12-cylinder
versions when the cars go on the market in Europe beginning in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Bernd Pischetsrieder, VW's chief executive-designate, said Monday
at the Geneva show that he doesn't expect the Phaeton to be a
high-volume car. Instead, it is being offered "to attract the
customers who have grown with Volkswagen and to offer them adequate
products in the upper segments as well."</TE>
<TE>   Critics say VW's move into the ultra-luxury sector is
self-defeating because it pits VW against its own luxury division,
Audi, which does not have an equivalent of the Phaeton.</TE>
<TE>   Phaeton buyers can initially choose a 3.2-liter, 241-horsepower
V-6 or a 6.0-liter, 410-horsepower W-12 engine. Later comes the
diesel powerhouse, a 4.5-liter V-10 with 313 horsepower.</TE>
<TE>   And speaking of power, Porsche said its Cayenne SUV will come with
a standard 4.5-liter V-8 rated at 340 horsepower and 310 pounds-feet
of torque, with an optional twin-turbo version boosted to a
mind-numbing 450 horsepower and 457 pounds-feet of wheel-turning
torque.</TE>
<TE>   In its first official photos, the Cayenne looks more like a sport
wagon than an SUV, with a relatively low roofline (66.9 inches tall)
and long (188.4 inches) body. Porsche says it will build 25,000
Cayennes during the first full year of production. The vehicles are
scheduled to begin showing up at Porsche dealerships in the U.S. this
summer.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>

<LD>Be honest--how many of you have fibbed about the miles you drive,
hoping for lower premiums on your auto insurance?</LD>
<LD>   Under California law, insurers must consider mileage, so  in
theory, the fewer miles driven, the lower the insurance premium.
Temptation for drivers to underestimate mileage is certainly there.</LD>
<LD>   How many drivers do it--in California or nationwide--is unknown.
But James Quiggle, president of the Coalition Against Insurance
Fraud, says "fudging your mileage on your auto insurance application
or renewal is a major headache."</LD>
<TE>   It may seem like "small scams committed by normally honest people,
but the scams add up collectively to millions of dollars a year that
honest policyholders end up paying for in higher premiums," says
Quiggle, whose Washington-based watchdog group includes consumers,
insurance companies and policymakers.</TE>
<TE>   But what if insurers discovered ways to closely monitor drivers
and their habits?</TE>
<TE>   It sounds futuristic, but one insurance company already has tested
the notion of keeping tabs on its policyholders for the sake of lower
premiums.</TE>
<TE>   Progressive Insurance Corp. conducted a pilot project in Texas
beginning in 1998 in which more than 1,000 of its customers' vehicles
were equipped with global-positioning systems and cellular
technology.</TE>
<TE>   Participation in the project was voluntary.</TE>
<TE>   The purpose was to gather information about how much, when and
where the vehicles were driven and then to charge accordingly, says
Leslie Kolleda, spokeswoman for the Ohio-based insurer.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the first time consumers ever had control over their
ultimate auto insurance cost. They loved it," Kolleda claims.</TE>
<TE>   Progressive says the insurance bill for the average customer in
the program fell by about 25%.</TE>
<TE>   It's the same concept as "switching your lights off when you leave
a room to help keep down the costs of your electricity," says
Kolleda. "You can decide not to make that unnecessary trip in your
vehicle" to keep down insurance costs.</TE>
<TE>   Fraud fighters such as Quiggle also see such programs as a way to
curb insurance fraud. And others believe that offering drivers
financial incentives to drive less will result in less traffic and
pollution.</TE>
<TE>   But some fear that monitoring raises invasion of privacy issues
and that the high cost of the technology makes the plan prohibitive.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the costs of retrofitting vehicles in the Texas experiment
ultimately put the brakes on the project, which ended last year.
Nevertheless, Progressive remains committed to finding a more
affordable and convenient way to calculate vehicle mileage and usage
in order to offer drivers lower rates, Kolleda says.</TE>
<TE>   When the pilot project was first introduced in 1998, "we were
optimistic that original equipment manufacturers would be building
more of this telematic equipment into vehicles on the assembly line,"
she says. "Well, it didn't catch on like we thought. We were a little
bit ahead of our time."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Texas passed legislation last year that would allow
insurers to offer customers policies with mileage-based rates.</TE>
<TE>   Insurers could sell premiums in 5,000- and 10,000-mile allotments.
When the mile limit is reached, the policy would expire. So far,
though, no insurers are offering the policies, says Jerry Johns,
president of Southwestern Insurance Information Service in Austin,
Texas.</TE>
<TE>   "While we are not, as an industry, opposed to it, we are still
trying to figure out how to price it," says Johns. "There are obvious
flaws. How do we address the issue of someone running out of miles in
the middle of the Mojave Desert?  Some insurers, such as Allstate,
are skeptical about mileage-based insurance policies. Though the
company has recently begun to closely check odometers and to review
auto repair bills to better determine how many miles and where
vehicles are driven by customers, Allstate has no plans to offer
specifically mileage-based rates, according to spokeswoman Lisa
Wannamaker.</TE>
<TE>   "Under a mileage-based policy, your policy period expires based on
mileage as opposed to a time period," and coping with that would
require costly technology and a major overhaul of the company's
system, she says.</TE>
<TE>   As for keeping customers honest about mileage, the day may come
when technology "will give insurance companies the ability to sniff
out small-time scams," Quiggle says.</TE>
<TE>   That would be especially welcome to insurers in California--the
only state, according to the Insurance Information Institute, that
now requires insurance companies to use mileage as one of the
important factors in determining rates. Right now, California
insurers use customers' estimates of mileage, a system that can lead
to abuse by those seeking to artificially reduce their premiums.</TE>
<TE>   Lacking a way to accurately track their customers' vehicle usage,
though, insurers must weigh "the need to crack down on serious
criminal enterprises like staged accident rings versus the time it
takes to track down individual scams like fudging mileage," Quiggle
says.</TE>

<HD>With Its Tiburon, Hyundai Has Just About Arrived</HD>
<DH>South Korean car maker is anticipating that its '03 GT V-6
sports coupe will appeal to the younger, wealthier buyer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>South Korea's Hyundai Motors has been making remarkable strides in
the U.S., its sales soaring as its products improve.</LD>
<LD>   The latest example is the 2003 Tiburon GT V-6 sports coupe.</LD>
<LD>   Although not up to Japanese competitors' standards in all aspects,
it is a powerful package, priced thousands less than the competition,
and it suggests that Toyota, Mitsubishi and others interested in
hanging on to their share of the youth performance market best start
looking over their shoulders.</LD>
<TE>   The Tiburon has been evolving for years and for 2003 almost gets
the lean, mean profile its name--Spanish for "shark"--demands. Only
the softly rounded nose harks back to the pudgy lines that made
previous models look as though they traced their lineage to the
guppy.</TE>
<TE>   Tiburon this year also gets an all-aluminum 2.7-liter V-6 engine
with 181 horsepower and 171 pounds-feet of torque and a six-speed
manual, a combination that lets the GT V-6 swim with the big fish.</TE>
<TE>   A dedicated platform would help put it out in front, but Hyundai
still sells on price and to keep it low as possible for the Tiburon
the company told its engineers to stretch and pull the Elantra sedan
platform to fit the body of the sporty coupe.</TE>
<TE>   That makes it a heavy car for its type, acknowledged David
Ossenmacher, product planning director for Fountain Valley-based
Hyundai Motor America.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a [Porsche] Boxster-killer, but a fun-to-drive sporty
coupe," he said at a recent Tiburon preview at the Las Vegas Motor
Speedway--calling into question the wisdom of launching the car on a
race track, where its inadequacies were easy to spot.</TE>
<TE>   The big V-6 adds a little too much weight to the front end, so the
car tends to under-steer in tight turns, and the steering
itself--while no problem in normal driving--seemed a bit slow for
racetrack work</TE>
<TE>   Although it is not likely to win many races without an assist from
aftermarket additives (and, believe it or not, there is a growing
aftermarket for Hyundai performance parts), in everyday use the
Tiburon can keep up with the rest of them.</TE>
<TE>   In the hills and valleys around Las Vegas, on freeway and on
twisty, narrow state and U.S. park roads, the Tiburon proved easy to
handle and satisfying to drive, with crisp steering responses,
powerful acceleration, little body roll and a nice balance between
engine and six-speed transmission. The only difficulty was keeping
speeds below the limits set in the parks.</TE>
<TE>   Just as the stylish and well-received Santa Fe sport-utility has
broadened Hyundai's appeal among grown-ups who can afford pricier
SUVs, the Tiburon is intended to boost Hyundai's profile in the
important youth--and youthful--market.</TE>
<TE>   Tiburon's two previous generations had a decidedly female
audience--about 55% of 2001 Tiburon buyers were women--but the new
model is expected to attract a heavily male audience. Hyundai expects
the V-6 models to account for about 75% of sales, and for males to
buy about 65% of those six-cylinder models.</TE>
<TE>   That's critical, said Larry Ashley, marketing director for
Corona-based APC Inc., a manufacturer of aftermarket styling
equipment for youth market brands such as Honda, Toyota, Mitsubishi
and, yes, Hyundai. "The performance scene is dominated by males, and
the more young male buyers you have, the more visibility and
credibility you get," he said. "We think the new Tiburon is going to
be a home run" for Hyundai.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the car maker expects to sell 28,000 of its 2003 model
Tiburon, a 46% gain from 2001 model sales--there is no '02 Tiburon
because Hyundai wanted to get a jump on the competition with the
newest model-year designation.</TE>
<TE>   Hyundai also expects buyers to be younger, with an average age of
32 versus 37 for the '01 version, and wealthier, with an average
household income of $65,000 versus $55,000 last year.</TE>
<TE>   Hyundai has priced the Tiburon GT V-6 to appeal to the
budget-conscious and equipped it to appeal to the performance
enthusiast.</TE>
<TE>   The base model--including sport-tuned suspension, 17-inch alloys,
leather seating, anti-lock brakes, a 360-watt sound system and a
five-speed manual transmission--carries a $17,999 sticker, plus
Hyundai's $495 destination charge.</TE>
<TE>   An $18,249 "tuner" version bumps up to the six-speed manual and
adds a rear spoiler and sporty aluminum pedals for gas, brake and
clutch, but eliminates the leather upholstery.</TE>
<TE>   The priciest package, at $19,997, adds a moon roof and restores
the leather.The "starter" Tiburon, with a 2.0-liter, 140-horsepower
inline-4, 16-inch tires and wheels and five-speed manual (no
six-speed available), is $15,999.</TE>
<TE>   Hyundai also has a four-speed automatic available with both
engines in various packages.</TE>
<TE>   Although the cabins aren't made for the very tall or the very
wide, the Tiburon is a comfortable car with grippy front seats
(forget the rears--they're good for gym bags, CD holders or
skateboards, but not much else) and well-placed controls.</TE>
<TE>   And while the exterior styling is the best ever from Hyundai , a
few details are a bit overdone. The faux rivets and locking ring on
the gas cap might work on the forthcoming Ford GT40, for instance,
but they don't belong on a street-going coupe. And the wasp-waist
indents in the bodywork just behind the doors is more sculpture than
the package needs.</TE>
<TE>   Final words: A competitive car for the youth market from a company
that still is looking to make its mark. Unfortunately, "I've got a
new Honda" still is far more pleasing than "I've got a new Hyundai"
to most in the target audience. The '03 Tiburon can help, but its
going to take a few more years of fine-tuning for Hyundai to overcome
the image handicap.</TE>

<LD>It has been seven decades since Ford Motor Co. first stuck a V-8
engine in a car, but those 70-year-old vehicles still have lots of
fans. Nearly 3,000 of them showed up Saturday for Deuce Day, a
celebration of the 1932 Ford, at the Petersen Automotive Museum.</LD>
<LD>   Tom Gale, the former Chrysler Corp. design chief who flew in from
Michigan just for the event, called it "awe-inspiring."</LD>

produced in 1932, ranging from unrestored stock models to
extravagantly custom hot rods.</LD>

<HD>Koppel, Walters Rally to 'Nightline's' Relevancy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG BRAXTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The ABC anchors are fighting back.</LD>
<LD>   Just a few days after reports surfaced that ABC had taken steps to
woo CBS' David Letterman and his late-night show to replace
"Nightline" in an effort to boost its late-night revenue, two of ABC
News' biggest stars, Ted Koppel of "Nightline" and Barbara Walters of
"20/20," lectured the network and its corporate owner, the Walt
Disney Co., about their responsibility as broadcasters.</LD>
<LD>   Walters lashed out at ABC during Tuesday's installment of her
daytime series "The View," comparing the "Nightline" controversy to
her frustration last year when ABC bumped "20/20" from its
long-standing Friday time period in order to make room for the
Disney-produced dramatic series "Once and Again."</LD>
<TE>   Walters, who executive-produces "The View," noted that she can
"understand why a program might need to be changed, moved or even
replaced," but  that "to be treated as dispensable and irrelevant is
thoughtless and hurtful."</TE>
<TE>   Citing the veteran status and prestige of other ABC News stars
such as Koppel, Peter Jennings and Sam Donaldson, Walters said, "We
have seen entertainment programs come and go. News used to be
considered a public trust. It was, and perhaps still is, what gives
the networks its dignity and integrity. It deserves respect, and so,
I think, do we."</TE>
<TE>   Koppel, meanwhile, in a New York Times opinion piece published
Tuesday, called eulogies for his show "wonderful but premature."
Addressing questions about the show's value to ABC, he wrote that
"conservatively speaking, 'Nightline' has earned well over half a
billion dollars for a succession of corporate owners over the years.
The program continues to be profitable to this day."</TE>
<TE>   The anchor also acknowledged that ABC's owner, Disney, has an
incentive to "meet its obligations to investors. Particularly in
these difficult economic times, it is perfectly understandable that
Disney would jump at the chance to increase earnings by replacing
'Nightline' with the more profitable David Letterman show."</TE>
<TE>   "</TE>
<TE>   Still, Koppel took issue with anonymous ABC executives quoted last
week as saying that "Nightline" is "irrelevant" because of all-news
cable channels.</TE>
<TE>   "I would argue that in these times, when homeland security is an
ongoing concern, when another terrorist attack, may, at any time,
shatter our sense of normalcy ... when, in short, the regular and
thoughtful analysis of national and foreign policy is more essential
than ever--it is, at best, inappropriate, and at worst, malicious to
describe what my colleagues and I are doing as lacking relevance,"
Koppel wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Executives at ABC did not return phone calls seeking reaction to
Koppel's or Walters' comments. The network made an undisclosed offer
to Letterman, whose "Late Show" contract is up in August, raising the
specter of displacing "Nightline," which Koppel has anchored at 11:30
p.m. for more than 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   On a separate front involving changes within ABC News, Cokie
Roberts confirmed plans to step down at the end of the year as
co-host of the Sunday morning program "This Week," which she
co-anchors with Sam Donaldson--something she told her bosses she
intended to do, Roberts said, when she signed her last two-year
contract. She said she has had "very good conversations" with
management about what to do next.</TE>

<HD>Carey Angered by ABC's Response to a Plot Line</HD>
<DH>Television* The comedian and the network disagree about how
to depict airport security in an upcoming episode.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As if ABC wasn't having enough trouble with its news division stars,
Drew Carey is fuming over what he described as a threat by ABC
censors to halt production of his self-titled comedy series this week
due to objections regarding the manner in which an episode poked fun
at heightened airport security.</LD>
<LD>   The upcoming installment of "The Drew Carey Show" features the
title character's nitwit friends Lewis (played by Ryan Stiles) and
Oswald (Diedrich Bader) getting jobs as airport security guards. ABC
expressed concerns that at least one character working in security be
presented as competent and, according to Carey, on Monday intimated
that the entire script would be thrown out if the producers didn't
comply. "I've never had a threat like that from the network....
Everybody was kind of in shock," said Carey, who is also a producer
on the show, adding, "If you can't satirize authority institutions,
what's the point?"</LD>
<LD>   Producers of the program, which is produced by Warner Bros.
Television, agreed to amend some of the humor and proceeded with
preparation for the episode, which will be taped on Thursday for
broadcast next month.</LD>
<TE>   An ABC spokesman declined comment. A network source said that the
network's concern was that it would be irresponsible to depict all
the airport security employees as incompetent.</TE>
<TE>   ABC is owned by the Walt Disney Co., which has a strong interest
in the tourism industry, but Carey noted that dealings with ABC's
standards and practices department--the unit that oversees broadcast
content--have been especially difficult throughout the current
season, the show's seventh year on the network. As for the humor
potentially being irresponsible, Carey said, "I think we have a
pretty good track record of not being serious on the show."</TE>

<LD>When it comes to ferreting out sneak previews, premieres and test
screenings of highly anticipated motion pictures, Southern California
movie buffs are fortunate indeed.</LD>
<LD>   All one need do is survey the newspaper ads on any given Friday,
be the second cousin or neighbor of the stunt coordinator or stroll
through Old Town Pasadena, where audience wranglers recruit
volunteers to sit through rough cuts of upcoming films. Just swear
you're not a member of the press, and you, too, can tell directors
how you think their movie should have ended.</LD>
<LD>   Or attend one of the many comic book and sci-fi conventions held
seemingly every weekend, and filmmakers will hop in their SUVs to
come to you. Such was the case a couple of Sundays ago, when several
key members of the creative team behind DreamWorks' updating of "The
Time Machine" participated in a panel discussion and preview
screening at the Shrine Auditorium.</LD>
<TE>   If you happen to live in Flyover Country, however, being the first
person on your block to see a potential Hollywood blockbuster--"Ice
Age," for example--is a little more complicated, although not
impossible.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Fox is holding what it bills as the world's first
Outdoor Frozen Movie Premiere, to which it has invited a select group
of Minneapolis-St. Paul viewers. Because, in all likelihood, most of
those attending the nocturnal screening also partake of such seasonal
pursuits as ice fishing, snowmobile marathons and dogsled races,
sitting outside for 90 minutes to see a movie should be a breeze.</TE>
<TE>   "I think only Minnesotans can appreciate sitting outside, at
night, in the winter," allowed Alan Cohen, president of domestic
theatrical marketing for 20th Century Fox. "There even will be a
section with seats made of ice, where members of the Polar Bear Club
will sit in their bathing suits."</TE>
<TE>   And you wondered how Jesse "The Body" Ventura came to be governor
of the state.</TE>
<TE>   The premiere caps a monthlong campaign at the sprawling Mall of
America--which, technically, is in nearby Bloomington, and outside
which the preview is scheduled--that included lots of "Ice Age"
signage and trailers in the local mega-plex.</TE>
<TE>   Folks in less frigid parts of the country, however, could hardly
have missed seeing the digitally enhanced characters that populate
the animated feature, considering the barrage of commercials and
billboards Fox purchased.</TE>
<TE>   "The buzz started last summer, with trailers and all the other
viral platforms," Cohen added.</TE>
<TE>   Viral marketing? Is there a doctor in the house? Viral marketing
involves the placement of a character or aspect from a movie into
different TV programs or Web portals.</TE>
<TE>   "We took Scrat, one of the characters that doesn't talk, and
placed him virally into the programming at 12 different cable
channels, and on the Olympics medals-count board. You'll be a
watching a program, and, all of a sudden, there will be Scrat running
across the bottom of the screen ... or he'll pop up during the Storm
Watch segment on the Weather Channel."</TE>
<TE>   He added, "Sometimes, we'd take a break, then come back with
something bigger. Even when we came back with our full-fledged media
campaign, we still were looking for other platforms to extend that
buzz."</TE>
<TE>   The marketing team at DreamWorks began its stealth campaign for
"The Time Machine" at last summer's Comic-Con International in San
Diego. The nearly 50,000 fans in attendance were encouraged to poke
and prod props from the film, including the time machine itself, and
watch some early footage.</TE>
<TE>   Within hours, photos of the time machine and other reports from
Comic-Con were posted on Web sites around the world, including Ain't
It Cool News and Dark Horizons, both of which cater to genre-specific
audiences.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a huge fan base for science fiction, and the experience
we've had--especially at Comic-Con--tells us that everyone's pulling
for us to make a good movie," said Simon Wells, co-director of the
"The Time Machine" and great-grandson of H.G. "These are the people
who actually go to the movies, and, for their $8 or $9, want to see
something they'll like."</TE>
<TE>   Although the Web sites that cater to these fans sometimes take
heat for revealing too much of the story line of a film that's still
in production--even to the point of critiquing working
scripts--studio marketers have embraced them as valuable tools.</TE>
<TE>   "In the last two years, we've gotten quite a lot of support from
the studios," said Garth Franklin, editor of the Sydney-based www
.darkhorizons.com, in a trans-Pacific e-mail interview. "I make the
call as to what coverage goes up on the site each day, but, every now
and then, I get in touch with the studios, in regards to confirming
articles or obtaining publicity material. Occasionally, I'll get
notes from them asking if I'd like to help launch things like a
poster or trailer."</TE>
<TE>   Franklin estimates his daily audience at 500,000, and "our
tracking software indicates a lot of visitors work at the major
studios. Fans from the U.S., U.K., Australia, France and Germany are
the ones who most frequently check out the site, but we'll also get
mail from places like Ecuador and Cambodia."</TE>
<TE>   It's been widely reported as well that studios and individual
filmmakers often will fly Ain't It Cool News' Harry Knowles--and his
dad--to far-flung locations and Hollywood sets, in order to lay on
the hard schmooze and curry favor with visitors to www.aintitcool
news.com. Critics of Knowles suspect that appealing to his ego helps
gain favorable coverage, although it didn't sway him from trashing
John McTiernan's updating of "Rollerball" in advance of its release.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to contributions from the makers of "The Time
Machine," other Hollywood goodies offered at Comic-Con included
previews of "The Lord of the Rings," "Planet of the Apes," "Ghosts of
Mars," "Spider-Man" and "Star Wars: Connections," the first
presentation by LucasFilm detailing the links among all of the "Star
Wars" movies. In addition to Wells, directors John Carpenter ("Ghosts
of Mars") and Sam Raimi ("Spider-Man") appeared in person.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's fun being challenged by the fans and having to
justify how we do certain things ... like design the time machine,
for instance," said the movie's visual-effects supervisor, Jamie
Price. "I got into this business because I was doing illustrations
for science-fiction paperbacks in Germany. I've been on the other
side of the podium many times, as a fan, and met graphic artists I
admire.</TE>
<TE>   "I found these panels to be very informative. Now, I'm trying to
do the same thing."</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who worked in this town before the arrival of stadium
seating and nacho machines will remember when impresarios, such as
the late Allan Carr, would use any tool at their disposal to promote
a picture, especially if it didn't cost much.</TE>
<TE>   In 1976, for example, Carr and Robert Stigwood picked up a
low-budget Mexican film, "Survive!," which documented how a group of
athletes survived a plane crash in the Andes. The reality-based movie
couldn't have been any cheesier, but Carr thought he could drum up
enough opening-weekend business by instructing local exhibitors to
have an ambulance strategically placed outside their theaters, in
case anyone fainted at scenes of cannibalism.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, people keeled over with surprising regularity on
opening day. The gag helped build word of mouth, and, before
audiences smelled a rat, the picture took in something north of $40
million.</TE>
<TE>   But those were the days when stealth marketing was simply called
promotion.</TE>
<TE>   Today, very few movies are put into release unless they're vetted
before test audiences and given an opportunity to generate "buzz"
among key interest groups.</TE>
<TE>   "We tested 'Dragonfly' before a general audience, just to see how
it would play," said Tom Shadyac, who directed the supernatural
thriller, which opened two weeks ago. "However, to create some word
of mouth we went to groups of people who believe in certain forms of
spirituality. We also went to a gentleman named Richard Bach, who has
a newsletter that goes to 3,000 different churches, and we screened
it for Betty J. Eadie, who wrote about her own near-death experience
in 'Embraced by the Light.'"</TE>
<TE>   Banner ads for "Dragonfly" appeared on the Web site for USA
Studios' Sci-Fi Channel, and www.scifi.com/johnedward, which promotes
"Crossing Over" and its host, psychic medium John Edward.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, there are practically as many Web sites and
individualized marketing campaigns as there are movies.</TE>
<TE>   Fox has been successful marketing movies targeted at African
American audiences by enlisting the help of the First Friday Group.
Preview screenings helped propel "Waiting to Exhale," "Soul Food" and
"Men of Honor."</TE>
<TE>   "The mission of the First Friday Group is to support African
American films," explained Jeffrey Godsick, executive vice president
of publicity and promotion for 20th Century Fox. "They know that if
African Americans support these movies, there will be more of them.
Members are required to attend recommended movies on opening
weekend." Hence the name First Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "Men of Honor" also benefited from a screening sponsored by the
secretary of Defense, and a reception where Carl Brashear, who is
portrayed in the film by Cuba Gooding Jr., was honored for his
service to the Navy. Fox then held screenings on military bases, for
veterans groups and other black organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Like "Pearl Harbor," Fox's "Behind Enemy Lines" was screened on an
aircraft carrier, the USS Carl Vincent, which was on active duty in
the Persian Gulf.</TE>
<TE>   "'Moulin Rouge' had separate campaigns in the fashion, art, music
and design communities," said Godsick. "They were strong
stealth-marketing, grass-roots efforts that fed into the general
campaign. Stealth marketing is nothing more than penetrating the
culture through means other than hard advertising and pure publicity.</TE>
<TE>   "If 'Ice Age' is to be successful, it has to reach beyond kids and
their parents. If we don't leave any stones unturned, we can amp up
the perception that this is an event."</TE>
<TE>   This brings up another question, however. If members of the Twin
Cities Polar Bear Club have a "frosty" reaction to "Ice Age" next
week, will Fox's marketing team interpret their response as positive
or negative?</TE>

<HD>Networks Struggle With 9/11 Programs</HD>
<DH>Television* Producers must consider matters  of taste and
the feelings of victims' families in preparing documentaries.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>As the six-month anniversary of Sept. 11 approaches, the first of
many documentaries about the brutal events of the day are about to
appear on America's television sets. Hunched over video editing
machines in darkened rooms, network executives and filmmakers are
sifting through hours of disturbing video and grappling with just how
graphic to be.</LD>
<LD>   Producers are walking a fine line between portraying the events
honestly without being insensitive to viewers and victims' families.
But even the decisions to broadcast any footage of the events has
angered some victims, who say the films, which are being done largely
without profits for anyone involved, are coming too soon.</LD>
<LD>   In CBS' two-hour "9/11," which is set to air Sunday night,
cameraman Jules Naudet enters New York's chaotic World Trade Center
and sees two people on fire but doesn't film it. "No one should see
this," Naudet is heard to say. The filmmaker, with his brother
Gedeon, got dramatic footage of the day, including the only known
image of the first plane to hit the towers, because they were already
at work on a film about a probationary New York firefighter.</LD>
<TE>   "We gave our word to the firefighters that this would be something
good and positive," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But in an unfinished version of HBO's May 26 "In Memoriam," still
frames taken from video show victims plunging to their deaths, their
bodies caught against the familiar World Trade Center facade in
eerily balletic poses. Subsequent pictures show the aftermath when
someone hit the ground: a pool of blood, a mangled hand.</TE>
<TE>   Sheila Nevins, HBO's executive vice president for original
programming, said the images will be "diffused," some may be removed
from the final version, and no one will be recognizable. "I don't
think any kid is going to look at this film and say, 'That's my
father.' It's just not going to happen," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Nevins said: "I think that you certainly don't want
to offend or cause trauma to any individual, [but] at the same time,
you don't want to euphemize history, so that the reaction is
ameliorated by the extensive editing of what is a horrible, visceral,
disgusting event."</TE>
<TE>   "I think it would be irresponsible for educational purposes for
generations to come, to not see the reality of what happened and to
learn from it," said Brad Grey, the producer of such series as "The
Sopranos," who brought the project to HBO.</TE>
<TE>   The filmmakers say their projects are meant to pay tribute to the
rescue workers, raise money for the families of victims or, at the
least, serve as historical documents.</TE>
<TE>   HBO's film, which follows New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
through the day and incorporates video from more than 100 mostly
amateur sources, is headed for the Museum of the City of New York.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Schnall embarked on "New York Firefighters: The Brotherhood
of September 11th" for the Discovery Channel just two days after the
attacks, "because we live here, this is our city, this is where the
attack happened, and we all felt very overwhelmed. This is the best
way we could do something, to help people understand."</TE>
<TE>   But representatives of some victims' families say noble motives
aren't enough. "The timing will be good in some period of time, just
as it's fine now to talk and view footage of the Holocaust," said
Roderick MacLeish Jr., president of the Massachusetts 9/11 Fund. "But
the public's interest in knowing needs to be weighed against the
traumatic impact on those affected. For these victims of trauma, who
are just starting to get into therapy and treatment, it is enormously
upsetting and disturbing."</TE>
<TE>   Families already have searing images of the planes and crashing
towers "indelibly etched into their memories," MacLeish said, "and
they just don't want to see any more visions of this again right
now."</TE>
<TE>   Susan Zirinsky, an executive producer of CBS' film, counters that
the timing is right. "We can't forget what drove this country to be
at war, which we are in right now," she said, suggesting that the
"9/11" broadcast "is about strength and courage, as well as about
remembering the pain."</TE>
<TE>   For HBO, "Memorial Day seemed an appropriate commemorative day,"
Nevins said, adding that "history needs to be recorded at the moment
of impact and what lives on tells the truest story. If you wait 10
years to tell the story, it's not going to work."</TE>
<TE>   Audience reaction to the first projects--Discovery's can be seen
Friday--could determine how later projects evolve. Sept. 11 was so
unprecedented, "They haven't written books about [people's ability to
deal with] this stuff; everything we do, we wing it," said Lt. Gerard
Murtha, whose Rescue 3 squad, which lost eight men, allowed Schnall's
cameras in its firehouse just weeks after the attacks. He said the
firefighters and the victims' families are pleased with the result.</TE>
<TE>   There will be many more projects. Showtime has given grants to New
York University student filmmakers to create short films about the
events. In the last two weeks, a firefighter has been offering
networks previously unseen footage. Schnall is contemplating a new
project about the city's police force. Networks are already debating
how to mark the one-year anniversary, with one floating a plan to air
a full 24 hours of programming.</TE>
<TE>   For CBS, language was one issue, as the Naudets' cameras captured
firefighters using blunt words not allowed by CBS' standards and
practices department. Some profanity not normally permitted will be
included, as actor Robert De Niro notes in the introduction.</TE>
<TE>   But much of the internal debate has been about the images.
Schnall's film interviews survivors about their trek down the stairs
and documents the emotional return of children to the firehouse where
their fathers had been based. But it includes no pictures of the
planes entering the trade center.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't want to punctuate the horror in a manner that felt
cheap," he said. "The plane felt a little too much."</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, HBO's documentary, as currently constructed, has
video after video of the second plane hitting the trade center's
Tower 2, from several angles. Nevins said the final film will
probably include three such versions. "This is what New Yorkers saw,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   The Naudets' CBS film is unique in that it captures the chaotic
scene inside the trade center as the Fire Department responds. Many
firefighters are shown heading up the towers, where some eventually
died. Chaplain Father Mychal Judge is seen praying, followed later by
firefighters retrieving his lifeless body.</TE>
<TE>   James Hanlon, a firefighter who narrates the film, painstakingly
tracked down families of all the men shown in the lobby who later
died and offered them video of their loved ones. The film will also
include a homage with names and pictures of all 343 firefighters who
died, CBS said.</TE>
<TE>   The victims who jumped or fell from the top floors of the trade
center are to some extent the untold story of the day. Many witnesses
recall them as providing the most disturbing images, but U.S.
television largely cut the pictures from their broadcasts almost
immediately. (Some European television channels aired the footage
repeatedly.)</TE>
<TE>   Schnall avoided those images altogether. "It felt insensitive and
would be television at its worst," he said. At some point, he said,
"we have to come to terms with it, to understand it so we can move
on," but not now.</TE>
<TE>   CBS' film deals with the subject in a roundabout way. Early on, in
a version screened for reporters Monday night, a firefighter is heard
saying, "Those are jumpers." Later, the film includes loud "thunks"
that cause firefighters inside the trade center to flinch, the noise
caused by bodies hitting a canopy. CBS chose to edit out some of
those sounds.</TE>

<LD>The low, growling chants are otherworldly, eerie yet soothing,
punctuated by bells, drums and cymbals.</LD>
<LD>   These are the sounds of Tibetan Buddhist monks, the sounds of
religious ritual, but in the U.S., they reverberate from a stage, or
a CD player, not from a sanctuary or a monastery.</LD>
<LD>   "We're just doing part of the ritual[s], as a show, mainly
vocalizing," says Thupten Donyo, who performs with the touring
Tibetan Tantric Choir. "Most of the time, life is devoted to
spiritual practice instead of worldly activity, [but] as long as one
has faith and devotion, it's OK to offer a show to the West [about]
the monks' lifestyle."</LD>
<TE>   This month, in a coincidence of bookings, Los Angeles will be able
to compare and contrast three sets of performing Buddhist monks. Each
has added theatricality to ritual and created touring shows that
bring Eastern traditions to Western audiences.</TE>
<TE>   Donyo and 13 of his brethren from Gyuto monastery, headquartered
in Dharamsala, India, make up the Tibetan Tantric Choir. They will
perform at UCLA's Royce Hall Saturday and at the Cerritos Center for
the Performing Arts later in the month, and starting today, they will
also be in residence at the Hammer Museum, creating an intricate sand
mandala meant as a blessing as the museum embarks on a redesign later
this year.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in two separate productions, some 40 Shaolin monks from
China--practitioners of kung fu--will perform martial arts
demonstrations, choreographed, costumed and staged, in Cerritos and
at the Universal Amphitheatre.</TE>
<TE>   The Gyuto monks, performing under the auspices of the Dalai Lama
and to benefit the monastery in India, have toured the world. Their
music has proven so popular that the group has recorded a handful of
CDs, joined on some tracks by such luminaries as composer Philip
Glass and Grateful Dead percussionist Mickey Hart, who also produces
the discs. A new CD is slated for release next month.</TE>
<TE>   What makes their sound so distinctive is that each of the monks
vocalizes a chord--that is, each can sing two or three tones
simultaneously. In Tibetan Buddhism, such sounds are thought to arise
only from the throat of a person who has realized "selfless wisdom,"
which emanates from the trancelike state of pure consciousness,
Samadhi.</TE>
<TE>   Donyo, 40, acts as a translator and spokesman for the choir.
Shortly before the tour began, he talked by phone from San Jose,
where he lives with three other monks in an offshoot of the Gyuto
monastery that opened last year.</TE>
<TE>   "In 1974, when I was 12, my parents sent me to India from Nepal to
become a monk," Donyo recalled. "Whenever we chant or do prayers in
the monastery, we're not supposed to use normal voice. All the monks
have to use the deeper voice. You have to practice, try very hard.
For me, it took a long time."</TE>
<TE>   Donyo is well aware that Buddhist monks are a little out of the
ordinary as touring musicians in the West. They follow strict
disciplines and diets, and after the tour, they will return to a
relatively cloistered world. Still, the culture clash is negotiable.</TE>
<TE>   "We are easygoing," he says, laughing. Consider food. "Most of us
are not vegetarians, although we're not allowed to have 'black'
foods--meat, alcohol, garlic, onions. On the road, I eat whatever is
possible. This morning, I bought bagels from Costco. With cheese
cream. We never had something like that in [India]."</TE>
<TE>   Donyo even admits to trading his traditional robes for blue jeans
from time to time, for tasks like driving. "They're not very
comfortable, though," he says, laughing.</TE>
<TE>   However adaptable the monks may try to be, Donyo says their staged
rituals are little changed from what goes on in the monastery. The
primary difference is time. If they were done at the usual length,
people would get bored. "There is nothing to see, nothing exciting,"
he says.</TE>
<TE>   But the intention is the same:</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal is to achieve enlightenment, to reach the Buddhist
state," Donyo says. "If I was enlightened, I wouldn't be like this,
talking with you. I wish I achieved enlightenment, but I think it'll
take another couple of lifetimes."</TE>
<TE>   The 1,500-year-old Shaolin tradition, now carried on by a temple
in China's central Henan province, expresses spirituality on a
decidedly more physical plane. By meditating on movements of animals,
the first Shaolin monks developed kung fu, a system of self-defense.
While Buddhism is generally nonviolent, Shaolin monks continue to be
trained in the use of 18 types of weaponry. Isn't that at odds with
their own philosophy?</TE>
<TE>   No, says Xiugin Wang, an English-speaking promoter from Beijing,
who is handling the 28-city tour of the Shaolin Warriors, a group of
monks contracted from the main temple and sponsored by the Chinese
government. Their appearance next week in Cerritos is already sold
out.</TE>
<TE>   "By practicing martial arts," Wang explains by phone from a tour
stop in Iowa, "they learn to concentrate. That kind of concentration
purifies your mind [and] makes it peaceful."</TE>
<TE>   The 20-plus performers execute astonishing feats by any standards.
Included is one performer who appears to break an iron bar with his
head; another is able to put his feet behind his ears. Wang says the
show is meant to represent temple life, where monks practice
meditation as well as martial arts. "But mainly," he adds, "the show
is a demonstration of kung fu that has been [theatrically enhanced
by] a choreographer, director, music composer and lighting designer."</TE>
<TE>   Reviews have been favorable. The Chicago Tribune wrote, "the show
is fascinating ... because of the paradox of watching peaceful,
serene men and boys move so quickly into fighting mode." Notes Wang:
"If we present the best part of Shaolin martial arts, we feel it is a
further step for cooperation between the U.S. and China."</TE>
<TE>   Another Shaolin production lands here first on public TV, airing
Thursday, and then arrives for one performance at the Universal
Amphitheatre. "Wheel of Life" is the most lavish of the three monk
productions. It began in London and has been touring for the past two
years, a sort of "Riverdance" meets "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"
spectacle in which an emperor, invading warlords and monks come
together. Among the highlights: a monk who performs two-fingered
handstands and a fearless soul who lies on a block of nails as
another monk crushes a cement slab on his chest with an ax.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't try that at home," says London-based producer Steve Nolan,
who managed rock 'n' roll tours before he was asked by a Chinese
entrepreneur to help produce a one-night benefit for the Shaolin
temple. As Nolan researched the sect's history, he realized he could
fashion something more than a one-night stand. He put together a
creative team, including a director and costume designer, then went
to China to cast 25 monks under an agreement with the temple's
abbot--the temple, he says, gets one-third of the show's gross
profits.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the reasons we tried to make this into a theatrical
[event] is to explain why these monks do what they do," says Nolan.
"They're human beings like you and I, and through dedication and a
never-ending self-belief, you can achieve anything you want."</TE>
<TE>   Chungliang "Al" Huang, 65, who grew up in China, taught theater
and dance at UCLA in the 1960s, and now heads a cross-cultural
organization, the Living Tao Foundation, expects the Shaolin shows to
do well. He hasn't seen the Shaolin Warriors, but he recently watched
"Wheel of Life" on TV.</TE>
<TE>   "After the popularity of 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,'
Westerners are fascinated in this kind of spectacle. Because the
[Shaolins] are trained as monks in a meditative way, they can attain
high-skilled performances. The parallel would be a great athlete
needing concentration. It's theater, but based on sound spiritual
tradition."</TE>
<TE>   For the Gyuto monks, that tradition is the key.</TE>
<TE>   "We get worried and attached to possessions, but this is not
important," says Donyo. "What is important is to do something that is
a benefit for others. If you did something good [during] the day, you
rejoice and do more the next day."</TE>

<HD>Much Has Changed Since Carson Was King</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When producer Don Mischer approached the most legendary host in
television history four years ago about participating in the 50th
annual Emmy Awards telecast, Johnny Carson responded that he would
"rather sit [at home] in Malibu and watch the hummingbirds mate."</LD>
<LD>   The hummingbirds are still flitting around, if the recent high
jinks pertaining to late-night television are any indication, which
is just another reminder of how remarkable it is that Carson has held
fast to his lofty perch near the shoreline--happily removed from the
incredibly public seat he occupied for three never-to-be-equaled
decades.</LD>
<LD>   To many, Carson's final installment of "The Tonight Show," when he
fought back tears as he bid America "a very heartfelt goodnight,"
might not seem as if it was all that long ago; however, changes to
the television landscape since that night in May 1992 have been
seismic--and that was before the marauding Mouseketeers running ABC
tried to get their paws on David Letterman.</LD>
<TE>   I should admit at this point having never met Carson, although I
have developed a sort of "same time, next year" relationship with his
assistant, Helen. On a near-annual basis since the so-called king of
late night set aside his crown, I have made the obligatory call to
Carson's production company asking if he would agree to discuss his
historic 30-year tenure as America's foremost political humorist and
entertainment career-maker. Short of that, I would settle for any
thoughts he might have about the current state of television, or
perhaps what he had for lunch.</TE>
<TE>   Each time, I have been politely told no, that Mr. Carson isn't
doing any interviews. There's no reason to take it personally, and
Helen has become pretty adept in the art of gentle rejection. After
all, Carson has shunned virtually all public appearances since his
farewell episode.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, don't look for Carson when NBC commemorates its 75th
anniversary with a splashy prime-time special in May (reportedly
despite a direct pitch from NBC Chairman Bob Wright), just as the
onetime host sat out the network's "50 Years of NBC Late Night"
special in September. And while the 10-year anniversary of that last
"Hi-yo!" from sidekick Ed McMahon will inevitably give rise to
various reminiscences about Carson in print and on television, NBC's
recognition of the late-night baton pass will perhaps not
surprisingly focus on successor Jay Leno, who will celebrate his 10
years of loyal service with his own prime-time special.</TE>
<TE>   "He just has no desire to [perform]," said Jeff Sotzing, Carson's
nephew and a former "Tonight" producer who oversees Carson
Productions. "He's happy with the decision that he made to retire
when he did."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, friends and associates say Carson--now 76, and by all
accounts in good health after recovering from a 1999 heart attack and
subsequent bypass surgery--made a decision not to linger beyond his
prime, as some renowned comics who preceded him (including people
Carson grew up admiring, like Jack Benny) were perceived to have
done.</TE>
<TE>   "Johnny once said to me, 'Listen, Fred, I did it,'" Fred de
Cordova--Carson's executive producer for more than two decades, who
died last year at age 90--told me in 1997. "I think he's very happy
the years were so good, and why take a chance on not being as good as
he was?</TE>
<TE>   "There's no arrogance in this. It's just him saying, 'I had a hell
of a run. Leave it alone.'"</TE>
<TE>   Yet while Carson has let his voice stay silent and kept out of the
spotlight, his image still casts an enormous shadow--perhaps even
more so given the manner in which the television business has been
reshaped since his well-timed exit.</TE>
<TE>   For starters, with more channels slicing up the viewing audience
into smaller pieces, few TV personalities today become so ingrained
or widely embraced in the public consciousness as to create the
tumult caused when the undisputed late-night champ opted to hang up
his gloves--an announcement that Bob Hope at the time likened to "a
head falling off Mt. Rushmore."</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, it has become increasingly difficult for talent in the
entertainment industry to enjoy the kind of career longevity required
to qualify as an institution, in part because of the unabashed
emphasis on reaching younger demographics. The fallout of that
economically driven mandate has made ageism so blatant and prevalent
that the trade paper Daily Variety made reference this week to
Letterman, 54, being "in the home stretch" of his career, whereas
Carson, at the same age, had a dozen years of hosting "The Tonight
Show" ahead of him.</TE>
<TE>   Carson also successfully negotiated for ownership of his show in
1980, back before the networks were almost uniformly part of major
studios that, in the wake of government deregulation, have made
control of content on their airwaves a top priority. (Letterman, who
possessed inordinate leverage when he jumped to CBS from NBC in 1993,
enjoys a similar arrangement on his current program, while "Tonight"
is produced through NBC Studios.)</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Carson has the intangible power of being ever-present in
the minds of Letterman, Leno and virtually every comic in their peer
group, a generation raised on the notion that Carson's approval could
make or break them--giving rise to an almost comic jockeying to earn
his anointment.</TE>
<TE>   So even though Leno has made "The Tonight Show" his own over the
last 10 years and consistently drubs Letterman in the ratings, he
still lives with petty slights (being left off Entertainment Weekly's
list of "the 50 funniest people alive," for example) as well as
slings and arrows from those who want to cast him as an impostor, a
pretender to the throne, with Letterman--who has at times sought
Carson's counsel and clearly earned his respect--representing the
true heir apparent.</TE>
<TE>   It's all rather silly in the bigger scheme of things, of course,
but when did royal succession--in Hollywood or anywhere else--ever
amount to more? And while he may have nothing to publicly say about
all this, Johnny Carson knows the hummingbirds haven't slowed down a
bit since the day he signed off, and one way or another, every one of
them is still dancing to his version of "The Tonight Show" theme.</TE>

<LD>   Crow Targets Industry's 'Sleazy' Promotion</LD>
<LD>   Is the pot calling the kettle black? Sheryl Crow, who came to the
Grammys in the barest of mini-outfits and appears scantily clad on
the cover of this month's Stuff magazine, is lashing out at the
lascivious promotional campaigns for singers Britney Spears and
Christina Aguilera.</LD>
<TE>   "They're being marketed like porn stars," Crow, 40, told Stuff. "I
don't mean to sound like a fuddy-duddy, but the images are pretty
sleazy.... Where do you go after you've been 19 and you've stuck your
crotch on a camera lens in front of 20,000 people?.... They're baring
it all like that's what has to be done to make it as a musician. It's
not fair to them. They're really not old enough to know any better."</TE>
<TE>   ENTERTAINMENT</TE>
<TE>   Judge: Hollywood Not Culpable for Columbine</TE>
<TE>   A Denver judge dismissed a lawsuit claiming that video games and
filmmakers shared responsibility for the Columbine High School
massacre. The action had been filed by the family of slain teacher
Dave Sanders on behalf of Columbine victims.</TE>
<TE>   During the April 1999 incident, police found a videotape that
showed one of the killers with a sawed-off shotgun he called "Arlene"
after a character in the video game "Doom." The plaintiffs also said
the perpetrators, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, had watched the
Leonardo DiCaprio movie "The Basketball Diaries," in which a student
kills his classmates.</TE>
<TE>   Motions to dismiss had been filed by Time Warner Inc., Palm
Pictures and video game manufacturers Sony Computer Entertainment
America, Activision and Id Software--the maker of "Doom."</TE>
<TE>   In his ruling, Judge Lewis Babcock said there was no way makers of
violent games and movies could have reasonably foreseen that their
products would cause the shooting or any other violent acts.</TE>
<TE>   MOVIES</TE>
<TE>   'Potter,' 'Rings' Scoring in Global Ticket Sales</TE>
<TE>   "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" and "The Lord of the
Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" already are among the worldwide
top 10 highest-grossing films of all time, the Hollywood Reporter
says.</TE>
<TE>   "Potter," the top-grossing 2001 release domestically, was reported
to have pulled in $941.7 million globally so far and is now second
only to "Titanic" (at $1.8 billion) in the all-time world market. It
benefited from the broadest overseas release ever for a Warner Bros.
picture and was translated into 43 languages. "Rings" has catapulted
into the eighth spot, with a worldwide box-office total of $749.6
million.</TE>
<TE>   TELEVISION</TE>
<TE>   New Chief Revamping 'Sesame Street'</TE>
<TE>   "Sesame Street" just went through its biggest overhaul ever, and
now it's getting a new executive producer, who will be adding even
more educational material to the preschool series next season.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis Bernstein, vice president of the show's global productions,
replaces Michael Loman, who has overseen "Sesame Street" for the last
nine years. He'll remain as a consultant.</TE>
<TE>   Bernstein, who started at parent Sesame Workshop 25 years ago in
the research department, was tapped to continue revitalizing the
show's curriculum material--incorporating segments on teaching
children thinking skills, for example, in addition to the rote A-B-Cs
for which the program is known.</TE>
<TE>   THE ARTS</TE>
<TE>   Ads Aim to Cultivate Arts Appreciation</TE>
<TE>   "Art. Ask for More." That's the mantra of a new ad campaign
produced by the advocacy group Americans for the Arts.</TE>
<TE>   The three-year effort includes public-service announcements
currently running on NBC, CNN, VH1 and other networks, plus ads in
the print media, radio and the Web. The goal: to make parents aware
that arts education is needed not only to produce artists but also to
turn out well-rounded human beings.</TE>
<TE>   Narrated by Alec Baldwin, the TV spots paint a grim future full of
"Stepford"-like children who'd rather listen to stock reports than 'N
Sync, the Dallas Morning News reports. One of them shows a bored
youngster at a birthday party, refusing to acknowledge that a balloon
animal is a giraffe.</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Annette Bening, Tyne Daly and Swoozie Kurtz are among those set to
star in "Talking Heads," solo pieces by British dramatist Alan
Bennett to be directed by Michael Engler ("Sex and the City").
Previews begin on March 12 for a three-week run at West Hollywood's
Tiffany Theatre, which will close its doors shortly thereafter....</TE>
<TE>   Vanessa Williams, currently seen in the Ahmanson's "Into the
Woods," will star in a concert version of "Carmen Jones"--Oscar
Hammerstein II's adaptation of Bizet's "Carmen"--at the Kennedy
Center in Washington next season. Placido Domingo will lead the
National Symphony Orchestra. The Royal Shakespeare Company is also
part of the lineup, having signed a five-year partnership with the
venue....</TE>
<TE>   Shuffling of the season at International City Theatre in Long
Beach has resulted in the addition of David Hare's "Amy's View,"
starring Carol Lawrence, in the Sept. 6-29 slot and the moving of
"Master Harold ... and the Boys" to the June 21-July 14 slot, bumping
"Chaim's Love Song" off the season.</TE>

<LD>Fifty years ago "An American in Paris" scored one of the bigger
upsets in Oscar history at the end of a race that looks spookily like
the current one. Could "Moulin Rouge" turn out to be this year's "An
American in Paris"--another songfest along the Seine that pulls off a
stunning best picture win?</LD>
<LD>   "Moulin Rouge's" top award from the Producers Guild of America on
Sunday suggests that's at least in the realm of possibility; in the
past 12 years, the guild has correctly predicted Oscar's best picture
champ nine times.</LD>
<LD>   The parallels between the 1951 film "An American in Paris" and
"Moulin Rouge" are remarkable: Both are romances set to retro music
(retooled George Gershwin, warmed-over Elton John) that initially
were shrugged off as serious Oscar rivals because they were
considered lightweight affairs--interesting experiments with the
musical form and not much more.</LD>
<TE>   "An American in Paris," just like "Moulin Rouge," however,
suddenly surfaced as a formidable rival at the Golden Globes when it
won best musical/comedy picture. Before that most of the attention
was focused on the Globe winner of best picture/drama, "A Place in
the Sun," because, just like the most recent recipient of that award,
"A Beautiful Mind," it seemed like an inevitable Oscar winner. Its
director, George Stevens, much like Ron Howard, was a veteran
considered long overdue for major awards.</TE>
<TE>   Neither "A Place in the Sun" nor "An American in Paris" entered
the Oscar race with the most nominations. "A Streetcar Named Desire"
was "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" of its day,
leading with 12 bids, followed by nine for "A Place in the Sun" and
eight for "An American in Paris." That compares closely to this
year's tallies: 13 for "Lord of the Rings" and eight each for "A
Beautiful Mind" and "Moulin Rouge."</TE>
<TE>   At first the awards derby proceeded as everyone expected. After
"Sun" nabbed the top Golden Globe, Stevens received the Directors
Guild of America award. Variety surveyed 15% of the 1,700 academy
members and reported that "Sun" was ahead in the best picture race
"by a comfortable poll margin."</TE>
<TE>   On Oscar night, many gala attendees griped that there was little
drama surrounding the event as they arrived at the Pantages Theatre.
Once the ceremony began, however, it was clear that the show was not
going according to script. Marlon Brando--much like Russell Crowe
this year--was considered a front-runner for best actor despite his
bad-boy reputation. The winner turned out to be the Denzel Washington
of that year--that is, an actor considered long overdue for a victory
in the lead actor category: Humphrey Bogart ("The African Queen").</TE>
<TE>   But as the Oscar evening wore on, it looked as if "A Place in the
Sun" was safe in its reach for the top prize, especially when George
Stevens won best director.</TE>
<TE>   There was such a broad assumption that "Sun" would prevail as best
picture, that, just as the last envelope of the night was about to
the opened, "some of the audience had begun to file out silently,"
reported Variety. "The retreating crowd was stunned into a momentary
silence" when the winner was revealed. Variety overheard a "gasp from
every section of the house" as "An American in Paris" was revealed to
be the winner.</TE>
<TE>   Could "Moulin Rouge" pull off the same huge upset 50 years later?
The movie has two serious strikes against it: no nominations for its
director or script writers. In the 73 years of Oscar history, movies
that won best picture also won the director's trophy 54 times. Only
three films prevailed in the top race without their directors being
nominated: "Wings," "Grand Hotel" and "Driving Miss Daisy." But two
of those contenders--"Wings" and "Grand Hotel"--won despite failing
to score screenplay bids, too.</TE>
<TE>   Musicals Haven't Been</TE>
<TE>   Favored in Recent Years</TE>
<TE>   "Moulin Rouge" faces another bad omen: No musical has won best
picture since "Oliver!," a victory that marked the end of a heyday
for the genre. Between 1958 and 1968, five musicals earned the top
prize: "Gigi" (1958), "West Side Story" (1961), "My Fair Lady"
(1964), "The Sound of Music" (1965) and "Oliver!" (1968). After that,
musicals continued to be nominated for best picture: "Hello, Dolly!"
(1969), "Fiddler on the Roof" (1971), "Cabaret" (1972) and "Beauty
and the Beast" (1991). Other movies that were best picture nominees
in recent years could be defined, if not as musicals, then as
music-driven films: "Nashville" (1975), "Bound for Glory" (1976),
"All That Jazz" (1979), "Coal Miner's Daughter" (1980) and "Tender
Mercies" (1983). One of them even won best picture: "Amadeus" (1984).</TE>
<TE>   In its favor, however, "Moulin Rouge" has something strongly in
common with a movie that recently pulled off a stunning upset in the
best picture showdown: "Shakespeare in Love" (1998). Both films are
unabashedly, fabulously romantic, and they're about performers
exulting in the thrill of hey-let's-put-on-a-show. It's a spirit that
may prove seductive to actors who make up the largest bloc--23% of
Oscar voters.</TE>
<TE>   If "Moulin Rouge" gets spurned in the top race, it's possible that
its support could pop up in another top category, thus mirroring what
happened to 1998 best picture nominee "Life Is Beautiful," which also
dramatized an overtly sentimental love story. Voters divvied up the
top awards to "Saving Private Ryan" (best director, Steven Spielberg)
and "Shakespeare in Love" (best picture) and gave "Life Is Beautiful"
star Roberto Benigni the best actor trophy, even though he received
no film critics' awards earlier that year and hadn't even been
nominated at the Golden Globes.</TE>
<TE>   "Moulin Rouge" star Nicole Kidman did win a Golden Globe this
year, but there will be no foreshadowing of her possible victory as
best actress at the Academy Awards, because she can't do what Benigni
did a few weeks before the Oscars: win at the Screen Actors Guild
Awards on Sunday. She's not nominated--probably because her votes got
split between "Moulin Rouge" and another of her films of 2001, "The
Others."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Kidman's Oscar chances must be taken seriously,
because her role in "Moulin Rouge" is certainly in the Oscar-winning
tradition of other song-bursting best actresses Julie Andrews ("Mary
Poppins") and Barbra Streisand ("Funny Girl"). Kidman even portrays
the same diva role that Oscar-winner Liza Minnelli did in
"Cabaret"--a hooker (or courtesan) with a heart of gold and lungs of
steel. There is one key difference: Kidman can't really sing, but her
admirable effort makes her character seem all the more real and worth
caring about.</TE>

<HD>Valenti Sees Healthy Film Industry</HD>
<DH>Movies* Production costs in 2001 dipped, ticket sales rose
and dire predictions after Sept. 11 proved false, the MPAA president
says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNN SMITH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>Major movie studios spent significantly less on making movies last
year, but used more of the shrinking budget for marketing their
films, according to Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture
Assn. of America. Meanwhile, he noted, movie ticket sales soared to
the highest total in more than 40 years.</LD>
<LD>   Valenti said studios spent an average of $78.71 million making and
marketing a major film in 2001, 4% less than in 2000. Production
expenses averaged $47.7 million, a 13% decrease from 2000 and the
most significant cutback in the last 20 years. Valenti attributed the
cost cutting to one of the industry's "periodic fits of cost control"
as well as "all sorts of financial innovations." The production of
many movies, he said, have been delayed because they could not stick
to their budgets.</LD>
<LD>   Valenti presented his annual address on the movie industry's
financial health Tuesday to the nation's theater owners at ShoWest,
the annual gathering of about 3,000 exhibitors, studio
representatives and concession vendors here. Despite a worldwide
recession and dire predictions about post-Sept. 11 moviegoing, the
movie industry continued to thrive, Valenti's figures showed.</LD>
<TE>   Intense and increasingly expensive advertising and marketing
campaigns were in part responsible for another record-breaking year
of box-office receipts and ticket sales, Valenti said. He said the
studios spent an average of $31.01 million on marketing a film in
2001, $3.7 million more than the previous year. Raking in $8.41
billion in box-office receipts, 2001 was the "greatest box-office
year in film history," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Good marketing cannot help a poor film, he said, but it can get
people in to the first weekend to sample the film, Valenti said.
After that, advertising and word of mouth bring in more people.</TE>
<TE>   Theater owners have been hurt by short-running films--exhibitors
get the smallest percentage of the gross in the first week of
release, with the percentages increasing as the film continues to
play. In particular, the exhibitors are not thrilled with the growing
trend of advertising campaigns that focus on opening weekend, said
John Fithian, president of the National Assn. of Theatre Owners, a
trend that was especially apparent last summer when there was a new
box-office champion practically every week.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a bizarre tendency for everybody to be focused on the
opening weekend. The numbers come out on Sunday night, and everybody
is reaching for their Palm Pilot [to see what they are]," Fithian
said. He conceded theater owners are also partly responsible for
short-running films by having overbuilt new theaters in recent years,
with the subsequent increasing demand for new blockbuster films every
week. While the number of screens is thinning out now, he said, "We
would like to see things change on both sides so movies have legs."</TE>
<TE>   The theater owners, who rely on sales of candy, soda and popcorn
for much of their profits, were interested more in admissions figures
than box-office receipts. Those also continued a decade-long rise,
reaching 1.5 billion ticket sales, the largest number since 1959, he
said. Sales also rose in Japan, the U.K. Germany and France.</TE>
<TE>   The positive figures came as a surprise, Fithian said. After
terrorists attacked on Sept. 11, it was widely thought that Americans
would turn away from movie theaters, and as Valenti said, "stay home
to nurse their raw and abused nerve edges." Instead, Valenti said,
"Going to the movies is the American remedy for the anxieties of
daily life."</TE>
<TE>   Valenti also applauded the entertainment community for its
response to the tragedy of Sept. 11. Hollywood's war efforts include
sending cassettes and DVDs to American troops overseas, supporting
movie stars who traveled to the war area to be with the troops,
producing TV and radio messages to encourage the soldiers and airing
TV and radio messages "affirming the nation's determination."</TE>
<TE>   In other remarks, Valenti noted the industry had been commended by
the Federal Trade Commission for progress on its efforts to ensure
that studios weren't marketing adult-themed movies to minors. He said
the MPAA has improved its voluntary system by inserting in newspaper
ads and on the Internet "reasons for the rating." The reasons are
also posted on http://www.filmratings.com.</TE>
<TE>   Theater owners are also now making progress in showing
appropriately themed trailers, geared to the main attraction, Fithian
said. However, he said theater owners still need to improve their
efforts at checking IDs at the box office.</TE>

<HD>Fox's 'Titus' Seeking Some Stability</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SACHS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was two years ago this month that comedian Christopher Titus
became the lemons-to-lemonade poster boy, parlaying his tumultuous
upbringing in a dysfunctional household into a Fox sitcom that plays
the same dark themes of his life for laughs.</LD>
<LD>   As "Titus" began trying to find its audience, however, the
audience started having problems finding "Titus."</LD>
<LD>   Fox shifted the show from one day to another, and just when it
seemed to be settling in, the network began tinkering with its time
slot. Sometimes the show would be preempted altogether as the network
auditioned other series in its place.</LD>
<TE>   Fox executives have assured the star that the juggling is all part
of a master plan to nurture the offbeat series, and tonight at 9:30,
viewers can see how the project is coming along.</TE>
<TE>   In an uneven episode titled "The Session," Titus (Chris Titus) and
the show's main players (Cynthia Watros as girlfriend Erin; Stacy
Keach as his alcoholic father, Ken; Zack Ward as his brother, Dave;
David Shatraw as friend Tommy; and Rachel Roth as niece Amy) gather
for a group-counseling powwow that's part of Erin's grad school
program.</TE>
<TE>   Early on, the episode feels like an underwritten comedy sketch
that's being played a bit too broadly. But it picks up some steam
when the session begins unraveling and the participants storm out one
by one, only to realize that they can watch those remaining in the
room through a one-way mirror.</TE>
<TE>   The show rolls out its familiar tricks of childhood flashbacks and
Titus' black-and-white confessionals into the camera to keep things
moving. But if "Titus" wants Fox to halt its own habit of keeping
things moving, namely the show's day and time slots, it will focus on
stronger writing and not the gimmicks.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A first wave of midseason series followed the dousing of the Olympic
flame, with NBC generating respectable tune-in for two new comedies,
the Julia Louis-Dreyfus showcase "Watching Ellie" and "Friends"
companion "Leap of Faith," while CBS' launch of the fourth "Survivor"
combined with the Grammy Awards to end NBC's winning streak at three
weeks, based on viewing estimates issued Tuesday by Nielsen Media
Research.</LD>
<LD>   CBS' "Survivor: Marquesas" made its debut to a slightly smaller
audience than the last go-round, as the big Thursday story was
another record for "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation," which drew more
viewers than NBC's "ER" did in the following hour. Grammy ratings
dove more than 25% compared to 2001 but still provided CBS a rare
Wednesday night victory.</LD>
<LD>   HBO premiered the second season of "Six Feet Under" on Sunday,
drawing an estimated 6.2 million viewers--an impressive number given
that the program plays on a channel received by less than one-third
of U.S. homes.</LD>
<TE>   Another critically acclaimed drama, Fox's "24," has been a bit of
a ratings disappointment but exhibited stronger life signs last week,
attracting its highest rating among adults ages 18 to 49.</TE>

<HD>Gina Goes to the Bake-Off</HD>
<DH>She doesn't win, but she does meet Marie Osmond.</DH>

<LD>The clock was ticking, the counter space was minimal, and the
appliances were something less than state-of-the-art. None of it
seemed to faze Gina De Roma as she bustled around her boyfriend's
Eagle Rock kitchen, putting the finishing touches on her
prize-winning samosas. Let's see now, where was that leaf-shaped
platter? The green chiles? Check. The yogurt-cilantro sauce? Check.</LD>
<LD>   It was the last Friday in February, and De Roma was hurrying to
get ready for an interview at KCBS-TV Channel 4, one of several media
engagements she has had in recent weeks.</LD>
<LD>   "I can't believe you're going to be on TV today," said De Roma's
boyfriend, Bogie, a rock drummer, as he scarfed down another of the
plump, triangular little potato pastries De Roma had made.</LD>
<TE>   To be sure, it did seem a bit strange that De Roma, a
free-spirited 39-year-old L.A. massage therapist, yoga practitioner
and pro wrestling fanatic, was suddenly being cast in the role of a
middle-class domestic goddess.</TE>
<TE>   But De Roma's life has been spinning in unexpected ways since she
was chosen in November as one of the 100 finalists in the 2002
Pillsbury Bake-Off Contest.</TE>
<TE>   For four months, she was on an experimental cooking odyssey, which
ended only a few days ago, 2,000 miles from Los Angeles at the
Bake-Off in Orlando, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Regarded by haute cuisine-istas as simply too Main Street for
words, Pillsbury's amateur competition has grown into a sort of
Middle-American culinary Olympics since its inception in 1949.</TE>
<TE>   Emphasizing creativity and convenience on a limited budget, the
Bake-Off solicits original recipes that generally combine
rib-sticking, no-nonsense food with a minimum of preparatory muss and
fuss.</TE>
<TE>   The use of (Pillsbury-made) convenience ingredients such as
Progresso bread crumbs and Green Giant frozen vegetables is not only
allowed but required.</TE>
<TE>   Though De Roma had never entered a cooking competition before, the
Hawthorne native decided to try her luck one day after leafing
through a recipe book of previous Pillsbury winners. The chance to
compete for the $1-million top prize was enticing, she says, so she
sent in her entry and waited hopefully.</TE>
<TE>   "I got a call back in mid-November, and I almost said I wasn't
there because I thought they just wanted to sell me a newspaper, or
something like that," she recalled.</TE>
<TE>   "And then the woman said, 'I'm from the Pillsbury Bake-Off,' and I
said, 'Aaa-yaaay!'"</TE>
<TE>   For placing in the final 100, De Roma received a new GE Advantium
oven and advanced to the bake-off round of the biannual competition.
The contest culminated last Wednesday with a nationally televised
ceremony in Orlando, Fla., hosted by Marie Osmond.</TE>
<TE>   De Roma, who took Bogie along for the trip, was looking forward to
meeting Osmond, whose teen-idol brother, Donny, had been her distant
love-object in the early 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   As a schoolgirl, De Roma was president of a short-lived fan club,
Donny's Purple Cap, which once celebrated his birthday by baking
purple cupcakes.</TE>
<TE>   De Roma's unconventional presence among the Pillsbury finalists is
an indication of how the Bake-Off has changed over the years.</TE>
<TE>   The contest, which draws tens of thousands of entries (the company
won't say how many exactly), has been a barometer not only of
evolving tastes but of social transformations affecting how much time
Americans spend in the kitchen, says Pillsbury spokeswoman Kathy
Newton.</TE>
<TE>   "It [the contest] was a promotional effort, and that's how it's
continued through the years," Newton says. "But it's grown from kind
of a homemaker's contest to kind of an illustration of the trends of
the time."</TE>
<TE>   The very first Bake-Off winner, one Mrs. Ralph E. Smafield of
Rockford, Ill., triumphed with a nutty sweet roll called
"Water-Rising Twists."</TE>
<TE>   One of the recipe's claims to notability was that somehow "its
dough was allowed to rise underwater," Newton says, though some
details may be lost to history.</TE>
<TE>   Held in New York City, the first Bake-Off was attended by no less
a personage than Eleanor Roosevelt.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the Bake-Off has retained something of a white-bread
image. In actuality, Newton says, it's been evolving constantly,
folding in new ethnic influences and being reshaped by modern baking
methods.</TE>
<TE>   For example, this year's list of eligible Pillsbury products
(contestants must use at least one) included Old El Paso taco sauce
and refried beans and Green Giant Mexicorn.</TE>
<TE>   Several of this year's submitted recipes called for dulce de
leche, the caramelized milk sauce that's popular in Latin American
countries. Two years ago, a salsa couscous chicken dish carried off
Pillsbury's top prize.</TE>
<TE>   The contest's emphasis on relatively quick and easy meals suits De
Roma's cooking style. Between her massage practice, her yoga practice
and her time with Bogie and her cats, Carmine and Luigi, she's as
busy as any other 21st century single career woman.</TE>
<TE>   Not so long ago she was even busier, working as an account
executive for a major cosmetics company.</TE>
<TE>   "I had the briefcase and the pantyhose and the whole deal," she
says. "Then I found myself at a place where I wanted to do something
different ....I always had a little hippie inside me. I wanted to
stop and smell the roses."</TE>
<TE>   De Roma gives the impression of someone who likes to keep her feet
firmly planted in the pleasures of the moment, which includes one of
her passions, pro wrestling.</TE>
<TE>   "I just got to go to my first smackdown," she enthused, referring
to the World Wrestling Federation's televised spectacles of
meticulously staged mayhem.</TE>
<TE>   "We were sitting near the ramp and it was great. I could see the
sweat coming off Kurt Angle."</TE>
<TE>   De Roma said her love of cooking began in childhood, when she
threw a birthday party for her pet cats, complete with party hats. "I
think I took Bisquick and a can of tuna and made them cupcakes." As a
little girl, she said, she dreamed of being a chef.</TE>
<TE>   Gradually, she assembled a serviceable repertoire of meals, snacks
and miscellaneous treats. One of her current favorites is a burly
sandwich that she and Bogie nicknamed "the Sopranwich," inspired by
HBO's mob melodrama, "The Sopranos."</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, the Sopranwich is the bomb!" De Roma says. "It's ground
turkey and feta cheese and herbs, inside hollowed-out French bread.
So it's definitely not light, but it is a big hit."</TE>
<TE>   Cooking and massage therapy really aren't all that different, De
Roma believes.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was little, I had an astrological chart done for me and it
said I'd be a good nurse. I don't think I could handle all the icky
parts. But massage and cooking are both nurturing. There's nothing
more comforting than good, comfort food--you know, like baked ziti?
And massage, I think it's preventive medicine."</TE>
<TE>   De Roma created the samosa recipe last summer, for the birthday
party of a friend's children. Her recipe calls for making a stew that
includes a can of chopped green chiles, a can of whole new potatoes,
a can of peas and curry power.</TE>
<TE>   This mixture gets rolled up in triangular pieces of Pillsbury
Crescent Dinner Roll dough and baked.</TE>
<TE>   "She made 'em like a couple times over the summer and everybody
was like, 'These are really awesome,'" says Bogie, a South Carolina
native whose real name is Hargrove Bowles IV and whose band is called
Rokstar--at least for now.</TE>
<TE>   This year's Bake-Off finalists represented a cross-section of the
country. The youngest was 11 and the oldest was 76. Ten were men.</TE>
<TE>   Four other contestants were from Southern California: Prati Parekh
of Corona, who'd entered her Corn Pilaf in the Luscious &amp; Lighter
category; Pamela Norris of Santa Barbara, whose Easy Three-Cheese
Broccoli Couscous was in the same category; Steve Greiger of
Oceanside, whose Sticky Chewy Chocolate Pecan Rolls were in the
dessert category; and Mary Capone of Long Beach, whose Parmesan
Chicken with Pasta Rags was competing under Easy Weeknight Meals.</TE>
<TE>   The bake-off took place in a giant hotel ballroom in Florida
equipped with 100 miniature kitchen/food preparation stations. De
Roma later described it as "a blast": so much activity, so much
camaraderie, with dozens of volunteer assistants scurrying to and
fro.</TE>
<TE>   One of her fellow contestants was pregnant, De Roma said. "Her
hormones were raging and she was having a little trouble with her
dish, so I was helping her out."</TE>
<TE>   Seeing all those different cooks in one room, all those recipes
with their casual hints of homelands left behind, was inspiring, De
Roma says. She had gotten that feeling even before the trip, while
checking out the official Bake-Off Web site (www.bakeoff.com). "It
kind of touched me," she says. "We're all American, and that's the
beautiful thing about it."</TE>
<TE>   The next day, during the awards ceremony, De Roma even got to chat
briefly with Marie Osmond. "Marie's a pro," she says. "I told her at
one time I was going to be her sister-in-law."</TE>
<TE>   But her other hopes were dashed. The $1-million grand prize was
awarded to Denise Yennie of Nashville, who wowed the judges with her
Chicken Florentine Panini, described on the Web site as "flavorful
Italian-inspired chicken sandwiches." Nor was De Roma among the three
runners-up or the other prize winners.</TE>
<TE>   "It was really pleasant, other than not winning," she said a few
hours later. And she had a souvenir cookbook of all the contestants'
recipes, a Pillsbury Doughboy bean bag and some great memories. "I
probably would enter again, just for the trip," she said. "They
really, really showed us a good time."</TE>
<TE>   When De Roma got back to L.A., she found numerous phone messages
of congratulations.</TE>
<TE>   That night she and Bogie took a break from cooking and went to get
a burger at In-N-Out.</TE>

<HD>Onion Compote? It's Stewable</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FAYE LEVY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With careful, slow cooking, you can turn the ordinary onion into a
stew of delectable sweetness. Known as compote, marmalade or jam,
it's a cousin of the famed French onion soup, with the onions cooked
to a thick, almost jam-like consistency.</LD>
<LD>   To make compote, simply cook sliced onions gently in butter or
oil. They soften, then gradually brown as their natural sugars
caramelize. It's up to you to decide what shade of brown you want.
The onions taste good at all stages, from tender and pale to light
golden to deep brown, when their bittersweet flavor is the most
intense.</LD>
<LD>   Don't let them begin to blacken, though, or they will have an
acrid, burnt taste. Be sure to use a heavy pan and check your onions
frequently.</LD>
<TE>   To slice an onion, cut it in half lengthwise, from its stem end
through its root end. Put the halves on your cutting board cut side
down and hold one half lightly with your fingers slightly curled.
Hold the knife against your fingers and slice the onion crosswise in
half-circles, moving your fingers back on the onion after each slice
to guide the knife to cut even slices. When cut crosswise, the onions
soften and almost melt to a sauce as they cook. If you prefer a
chunky compote with more distinct pieces, slice them lengthwise
instead.</TE>
<TE>   Following the French, you can season the onions subtly with thyme
and a bay leaf. A splash of wine vinegar is a pleasant accent for the
compote. For a sweet-and-sour note, add a teaspoon of sugar as well.
For spicy onions, stew them North African-style with chiles, paprika,
cayenne and a few chopped tomatoes.</TE>
<TE>   Onion compote makes a delicious relish alongside grilled meat or
chicken or in a bun with sausages and sauerkraut. Try it as a
change-of-pace pizza topping in the Alsatian fashion. Most often I
turn the compote into a savory-sweet onion sauce for pasta or enjoy
it with warm fresh bread.</TE>

<TE>   Pasta Spirals With Onion Compote</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 20 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 40 minutes
* Vegetarian</TE>
<TE>   Common brown-skinned onions are fine for compote--when cooked,
they're actually sweeter than "sweet" varieties such as Vidalia or
Maui onions. For ease in cooking and the best flavor, don't skimp on
the butter. If you do want a leaner dish, use a total of 2 or 3
tablespoons butter or oil and add vegetable broth or water by
tablespoons as necessary to prevent burning. You can cook the onions
2 or 3 days ahead and keep them in a covered container in the
refrigerator. To add color, use tomato or spinach pasta or stir in 2
or 3 tablespoons of chopped parsley at the last minute. Serve the
pasta as a first course, a partner for steak or roast chicken or an
entree with broccoli, green beans or zucchini.</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon vegetable oil or olive oil</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup (1/2 stick) butter, divided</TE>
<TE>   2 large onions (1 pound), halved and thinly sliced</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves or 3/4 teaspoon dried</TE>
<TE>   1 bay leaf</TE>
<TE>   1/2 pound fusilli, rotini or other spiral pasta</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for
serving, optional</TE>
<TE>   Cayenne pepper, optional</TE>
<TE>   Fresh thyme sprigs, optional</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oil and 3 tablespoons of butter in a large, heavy skillet
over medium-low heat. Add the onions, salt and pepper to taste, the
thyme and bay leaf. Cook, stirring often, 10 minutes. Cover and
continue cooking until the onions are very tender, about 15 minutes.
Raise the heat to medium-high and cook the onions uncovered,
stirring, until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Discard the bay leaf.</TE>
<TE>   Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add salt. Add the pasta,
stir and cook uncovered over high heat until tender but firm to the
bite, about 7 minutes. Drain the pasta, reserving a few tablespoons
of cooking liquid.</TE>
<TE>   Add the pasta and remaining tablespoon of butter to the onions.
Toss gently over low heat until the butter melts. Add 2 tablespoons
of cheese and a dash of cayenne pepper and toss again. If the sauce
is too thick, add 1 or 2 tablespoons of pasta cooking liquid. Add
salt and pepper, if needed. Garnish with thyme sprigs and serve with
extra cheese.</TE>

<HD>All About Allspice</HD>

<AU>CHARLES PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So you know that pimento is a red bell pepper, and then one day you
find out that in Italian pimento (like the word piment in French)
means allspice. How did that happen?</LD>
<LD>   It started in the Middle Ages, when Spanish cooks used so much
pepper in cooking that it colored the dishes, and they took to
calling pepper pimiento, or pigment. With the discovery of the
Caribbean, the Spanish started calling chile peppers pimientos, and
then they found another spice growing there, allspice, and called it
pimiento too.</LD>
<LD>   Eventually they took to calling black pepper pimienta, red pepper
pimiento (or pimienton) and allspice pimiento de Jamaica. French and
Spanish unfortunately came aboard before that was sorted out. We can
be grateful for having the word allspice, which spares us the whole
mess.</LD>
<TE>   The reason we call it allspice is that its scent is said to
resemble a mixture of cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg. (That's why
Lebanese cooks, who used complicated spice mixtures in the Middle
Ages, now mostly use allspice.) Probably it smells more like cloves
than anything else, because it's related to cloves, and also to
guavas and a lot of obscure tropical fruits with names like
grumichama and lilly pilly.</TE>
<TE>   Its closest relative is the West Indian bay, a tree whose leaves
are distilled into the old-fashioned men's cologne called bay rum.
Incidentally, in the West Indies, the leaves of that tree are used in
cooking, too, for that right-out-of-the-barber-shop flavor.</TE>

<DH>One of the best Dutch cheeses in the world is made in
Riverside County.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMILY GREEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WINCHESTER, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Jules Wesselink was 15 when an American B-17 was shot down near his
home in Haarlem, the Netherlands, in 1944. He was 21 when he and his
wife, Corrie, left Holland to join the Dutch dairymen of Southern
California. He was 64 when he finally learned the fate of the crew of
the B-17 and 66 when he went back to the Netherlands to celebrate the
liberation by the Allies. On that trip he happened to buy an amateur
cheese-making kit.</LD>
<LD>   Today, at 73, he is a keen amateur historian of the U.S. 100th
Bomb Group and one of the best cheese-makers in California. His
Winchester Gouda is one of a small number of authentic Goudas now
made anywhere in the world, including Holland. It is served at top
restaurants, including Artisan, Tribeca Grill and the Gramercy Tavern
in New York.</LD>
<LD>   "Isn't it amazing what you can do by accident?" he says, beaming.</LD>
<TE>   That smile. Those twinkling blue eyes. The man could have invented
merriment. Go to his farm in a rock-strewn patch of Riverside County,
meet Wesselink, and his life seems more a feat of attitude than
accident. He reeks of bonhomie even when he's complaining about his
pronounced limp. "Everything hurts," he laughs. "If it doesn't hurt,
it doesn't work any more."</TE>
<TE>   It is impossible to separate the way Wesselink approaches making
cheese from the way he approaches life. A good day is one in which
family is near, something expensive in a store can be made
economically at home, and there is food on the table, preferably a
cheese sandwich. A bad day? Wesselink grew up under the bombs of
World War II. His teenage years in Haarlem were spent hungry.</TE>
<TE>   "All we did at the end of the war is get our food and stay alive,"
he says. "Today you see people in the grocery store. They don't like
something, they throw it down. I tell them, 'Never throw food away.'
During that war, you couldn't find a cat on the street."</TE>
<TE>   His family worked for the resistance, he says; "Everyone did."
Their job was to help downed Allied airmen to a port where British
boats would collect them. When that B-17 was shot down near Haarlem,
one of 177 lost to enemy fire by the 100th Bomb Group, he became
obsessed by the fate of the fliers, all of whom were eventually
captured by the Germans. He kept a photograph of the wrecked B-17.</TE>
<TE>   When the war ended, he joined the Dutch army, served in Indonesia
and returned to Holland, where he married his childhood sweetheart,
Corrie van Loon. In 1951, they followed two of Corrie's brothers to
Artesia, where Dutch immigrants ran most of the dairy farms. By 1958,
he had his own farm and eight of Corrie's 11 siblings had also
emigrated to California. "We made sure California would be
populated," he says.</TE>
<TE>   As suburbs crowded the old L.A. dairies, Wesselink's family moved
first to Chino in 1968 and then, in 1978, to Winchester, a part of
Riverside County so barren that it seems to be more rock than earth.
Winchester's not everyone's cup of place. Even developers seem to
have left it alone.</TE>
<TE>   But from Wesselink's perspective, a craggy patch off Route 79 was
ideal. The fewer people around, the fewer people to complain about
the kind of farm smells that happen when you have herds the size of
Wesselink's, which at its peak swelled to 960 cows.</TE>
<TE>   Though Winchester might sound like a good place to leave,
Wesselink's family stayed near. Most of his wife's family settled
close by. His brother-in-law Piet Van Loon made his dairy equipment.
His sons, Leo and Jules Jr., formed allied businesses clipping cattle
hoofs and fermenting oats to make livestock feed. One daughter,
Valerie Thomas, and her husband, David, joined his cheese-making
business. His other daughter, Pauline, invested in the business.
There are 11 grandchildren. At any one time, there will likely be
three generations of Wesselinks and van Loons around the place.</TE>
<TE>   The turn to cheese-making was part accident, part economic forces
and part tradition. "The whole dairy business went kind of kerplunk
in the late 1980s," says Wesselink. As he accumulated more and more
cows but got less and less for money for their milk, a fortuitous
meeting awakened his fighting spirit. During a holiday in
Albuquerque, he spotted someone wearing a B-17 bomber jacket. The man
was from the 99th Bomb Group. In no time, the stranger had all five
crew members of the downed B-17 from the 100th Bomb Group on the
phone.</TE>
<TE>   "We were so excited, we were shaking," says Wesselink. A meeting
was held in Cleveland, where Wesselink finally heard stories about
how they had been slowly picked up by Germans. One, a gunner named
John Seaman, turned himself in, says Wesselink, when he feared a
Dutch child had been killed for having helped him and more people
might be executed.</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, Wesselink returned to Haarlem for the 50th
anniversary of the liberation of Europe. He rode in tanks with
British veterans. Canadians were put up in the homes of Dutch
families. "It was absolutely unbelievable!" he says.</TE>
<TE>   Outside of the celebrations, Wesselink preoccupied himself with
milk. His wife's family had long made Gouda. "I stayed with relatives
that make cheese," he says. "For about a week, I made cheese."</TE>
<TE>   Before leaving Holland, he bought a do-it-yourself Gouda kit. "It
had a little deal with a knife, and two 2-pound molds, another little
deal with a culture and another little deal with rennet," he says. "I
made two baby wheels of cheese. I don't think we waited two months
before eating it, but it was good."</TE>
<TE>   Gradually a cheese plant was fashioned out of what he could afford
and what worked. Wesselink bought 30 molds for 2-pound cheeses from
the Hollandia Dairy in Escondido, then large ones from Holland. With
the help of Van Loon, a trailer was converted into their first cheese
room. "So much of what you see is self-invented," he says. This
includes the shelves, the cutters and the succession of interlocking
trailers (now up to three) that serves as the cheese-making area.</TE>
<TE>   The family quickly graduated from using a 60-gallon tank per batch
to a 250-gallon one, then to 600, to 1,250. Now that the tank is big
enough for Wesselink to swim a lap in, Valerie and David make the
cheese.</TE>
<TE>   While building up the cheese business during the last six years,
Wesselink wound down the dairy. He let the herd of Holsteins dwindle
to 400, then sold the cows. "It was too much," he says. Their buyer
was a Dutch neighbor, who still keeps the herd in the same
neighboring paddock. He still supplies the milk.</TE>
<TE>   So the Wesselink Dairy became the Winchester Cheese Co. The
Wesselinks use the old Dutch term "boere kaas" to describe their
product. It means "farm-made cheese." At their dairy, milk is pumped
into the cheese-making tank minutes after leaving the cow. It is not
pasteurized. The first step is adding a culture of beneficial
bacteria and enzymes to curdle the milk.</TE>
<TE>   After 45 minutes or an hour, Wesselink says, "the milk is like
yogurt. Val comes in and tests the curd for firmness by drawing her
arm through it. If it breaks in a straight line, it's ready, and if
it breaks in a jagged line, it's not.</TE>
<TE>   "Then you put the knives in," he says, pointing to a rig that
slowly draws two large paddles faced with open blades the length of
the tub. "The curd goes to the bottom and the whey goes to the top."</TE>
<TE>   The whey, he says, carries the lactose. "It's real sweet, like
sugar water," he says. After draining the main part of the whey, the
curd is turned by a propeller-type blade, called an auger, to remove
yet more whey.</TE>
<TE>   But you don't want to remove it all, Wesselink cautions: "You want
some sweetness left. So when Val is making cheese, she is constantly
tasting. There will be cups of whey everywhere."</TE>
<TE>   The whey siphoned off is pumped back to the barn, combined with
feed and given to the cows. "They love it," he says. Once the curd is
ready, a tray is hooked up to the side of the tub to hold net-lined
molds and the curd is "hooped"--scooped into the molds. Then Valerie
will crumble it by hand to fine pieces. This is another
labor-intensive step foregone by factories, says Wesselink. "It
leaves many tiny holes in the cheese. You want those tiny holes. They
allow air and good fumes to travel in the cheese as it ages."</TE>
<TE>   Now it's time for pressing. The cheeses are stacked under a weight
to create a tight texture. Halfway through pressing, the cheeses are
flipped and reversed in order of the stack, so the pressure is equal
for each side of each cheese.</TE>
<TE>   Quotes for a factory-made press came in at $15,000, says
Wesselink. He and Van Loon made theirs out of piping, T-joints and
weights from Home Depot. It cost $150.</TE>
<TE>   After pressing, the young cheeses go into brine tanks. Unlike many
cheeses, Wesselink's Gouda is not salted as the curd forms. The only
salt it sees is when it is submerged in salt water for two days. Not
all types of cheeses are brined. Cheddar isn't. Cheese-makers who do
brine offer many mystical explanations about its benefits. In the
case of Gouda, the important factor is that it helps the soft cheese
form a rind to see it through at least two months and as much as a
year of aging.</TE>
<TE>   From the brine tank, the young Goudas are dried and then given a
light vegetable extract coating. This allows them to breathe as they
age. After a year of aging, a 15-pound cheese will end up weighing
about 11 pounds. By contrast, a factory Gouda with a red plastic
coating will not breathe, which goes a long way to explain its wet,
rubbery texture.</TE>
<TE>   Wesselink's own attitude toward authenticity is flexible. On the
echt side, he is adamant about the use of raw milk. Cooking the milk
destroys flavor and his aging of the cheese kills any pathogens.
Crumbling curd is essential. Factory waxes are unacceptable.</TE>
<TE>   With age and evaporation of water comes flavor. His mild
(2-month-old), medium (3-month), sharp (6-month) and "super-aged"
(year-old) cheeses could all come from Holland, except that real
Gouda has become rare there too. It is nothing like bland, flaccid
factory cheeses, but surprisingly like a top-notch
Parmigiano-Reggiano: nutty with a pleasing tang and crumbling
texture.</TE>
<TE>   But in a nod to the eclectic tastes of the Californian market,
Wesselink also makes young Goudas with all manner of special
flavorings, including garden herbs, jalapenos and cumin. The demand
from foodies, however, has been for the un-enhanced versions,
particularly the super-aged.</TE>
<TE>   Prices range from $5.95 a pound for the mild Gouda to $11.35 a
pound for the super-aged.</TE>
<TE>   It began when Wesselink saw cheese expert Steven Jenkins'
description of aged Gouda being hard to make in his book "The Cheese
Primer." "My dad contacted him and said, 'No, it's not,'" says
Valerie. "'We're making it right here.'"</TE>
<TE>   As Jenkins and others spread the word among New York foodies, the
cheese went on the menus of top restaurants and was sold in Murray's
Cheese Shop in Greenwich Village. In Southern California, ironically,
it has slipped beneath the radar. The Beverly Hills Cheese store puts
it in gift baskets at Christmas. But the rest of the year, this
superb cheese receives decidedly humble merchandising. The main
Southern California outlets are farmers markets stalls manned by two
friends of Wesselink's, both named Joe (Van Der Valk and Legler).</TE>
<TE>   And Wesselink encourages visits to Winchester. By way of
highlighting the farm as an attraction, Wesselink's family rigged an
incongruous covered wagon near Route 79. The family also makes a
practice of having school groups in, though these are time-consuming
and don't make any money. "Kids need to know how farms work," he
says. "One day the kids saw the miracle of birth. Two cows calved.
You could have heard a pin drop, except for one girl, who cried."</TE>
<TE>   In a small pen near the trailers, there is a quirky collection of
llamas, exotic goats and ostriches. "When people want to get rid of
animals, they bring them to us," says Wesselink with a laugh. "I made
them into a petting zoo."</TE>
<TE>   Inside one of the trailers, a gift shop has been set up. There are
blue ribbons from fairs, murals by Corrie, a model windmill,
clog-shaped fridge magnets and, best of all, cheese set out for
tasting, and more for sale. Jack Lieberman, a friend of Wesselink's,
mans the phones and endures jokes about how old they both are.
Valerie packs special orders for a Bay Area cheese shop.</TE>
<TE>   Wesselink disappears rooting around for something. Finally he
finds it. It is a dish towel commemorating the 100th Bomb Group.
"Isn't it beautiful?" he asks, then murmurs to himself, "Just
beautiful."</TE>

<HD>Veggie Sandwich: Cuttin' It Thin</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A sandwich like this could be laden with fat, but there are a few
things you can do to change that. First, slice the bread thin--though
many breads contain no fat, some sun-dried tomato breads are made
with olive oil. Then skip any butter and instead make a zesty garlic
spread with low-fat mayonnaise. Use only a few slices of avocado,
which is high in fat, per sandwich. And make the filling a mix of
fresh vegetables for a variety of flavors and textures.</LD>
<LD>   You'll wind up with a sandwich that's light and substantial.</LD>
<LD>   It's fun to experiment with different sandwich breads, because
good, fresh bread can make all the difference. I especially like the
sun-dried tomato bread made in the bakery of my local Pavilions
grocery store.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It took the new Hollywood Media District farmers market a bit longer
than planned to open due to problems with permits, but it finally
debuted with much hoopla and a strong roster of farmers Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps the most intriguing stand was staffed by Sarah Cascante,
an 11-year-old student at the nearby Hollywood Schoolhouse. She sold
lettuce, radishes and cilantro from the school garden--a distant echo
of times past when Hollywood farmers grew oranges, cherimoyas and
even pineapples.</LD>
<LD>   Santiago Morelos, a vendor for Maggie's Farm of Agoura Hills, had
tender, sweet mache, lemony sorrel and a new mix, winter mesclun,
which included tarragon, mint, radicchio, frisee, arugula and
spinach. From Lompoc, Suncoast Farms--as the former Green Farms is
now called--sold small purple artichokes, broccoli, cauliflower and
slender asparagus.</LD>
<TE>   James Birch of Three Rivers displayed beautiful organic fennel,
tender Savoy spinach, Red Rib dandelion greens and tasty cavalo nero,
black kale. Givens Organic Farm of Goleta had fine leeks, carrots and
sugar snap and English shelling peas. Jamie Gean of Harry's Berries
in Oxnard sold Seascape and Gaviota strawberries; on this occasion,
the Gaviotas were sweeter.</TE>
<TE>   David Ha of Tehachapi had small but crisp and sugary Fuji apples.
Will Stehly of Sycamore Hill Ranch, from Fillmore, sold excellent
organic Washington navel oranges, Eureka and Lisbon lemons and
seedless Pixie mandarins. Vicki Bernard had Rio Red grapefruit,
Oroblancos and Moro blood oranges, along with Washington navels from
Riverside grown on sour orange rootstock, which were as sweet,
flavorful and juicy as navels get.</TE>
<TE>   Betty and Truman Kennedy of Dinuba had always wondered about the
lumpy, sour citrus, which they called "ugly lemons," from an
unidentified tree that grew from rootstock. At Friday's market, Reza
Marashi, an L.A. County agricultural inspector of Persian descent,
readily identified the fruits as sour oranges, used for flavoring
rice dishes, and described a folk tradition: Just before their New
Year (which falls on March 20 this year), Persians like to put a sour
orange in water. Just as the new year starts, the orange is said to
revolve.</TE>
<TE>   The market is sponsored by the Media District business improvement
organization and the organizers behind the big Sunday Hollywood
market.</TE>

Santa Monica Boulevard and Lexington Avenue, Fridays 10:30 a.m. to 3

<LD>Flexible and forgiving--that's this warm cabbage salad.</LD>
<LD>   Inspired by the classic French frisee aux lardons, but with
cabbage in my fridge instead of chicory, I made this main-dish
"salad" on a cool evening when I wanted something warm. Cabbage is
hearty and sweet, especially when boiled briefly before sauteing to
remove the sulfurous smell.</LD>
<LD>   Medium-boiled eggs are easier to make than poached and still have
slightly runny yolks to enrich the dressing. But if yours turn out
hard-boiled, no matter.</LD>
<TE>   Same with the cabbage and onions; a longer cooking time just makes
them sweeter. This dish is equally good without meat. Serve with
thick slices of toasted country bread.</TE>
<TE>   Warm Cabbage Salad</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 15 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 30 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Core the cabbage, if desired.</TE>
<TE>   Sea salt</TE>
<TE>   1 (1 3/4-pound) green cabbage, halved, each half cut into 6 wedges</TE>
<TE>   3 to 4 tablespoons fruity olive oil, divided</TE>
<TE>   1/4 pound thick-sliced ham or slab bacon, cut into 1/2-inch cubes,
optional</TE>
<TE>   1 red onion, thinly sliced</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   5 eggs</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons lemon juice</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon water</TE>
<TE>   Bring water to boil in a wide, shallow pot. Add 1 tablespoon of
salt and the cabbage, and cover. Once the water returns to a boil,
cook the cabbage just until its color brightens, about 2 minutes,
then drain.</TE>
<TE>   Dry the pot, add 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and heat it over
medium-high heat. Add the ham, if using, and cook until browned,
about 2 minutes. If using the bacon, skip the oil and cook the diced
bacon until crisp, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the onion, turn the heat to
medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion softens, 3 to
4 minutes. Add the drained cabbage and salt and pepper to taste, and
stir, scraping up any brown bits (there'll be enough moisture in the
cabbage to do this). Cook, uncovered, until the cabbage is tender and
lightly browned, or until you finish making the rest of dinner or
about 10 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, place the eggs in a covered saucepan of water, bring to
a boil and boil 2 minutes. From start to finish, this should take
about 10 minutes if the eggs are cold. Drain the eggs, run under cold
water and peel.</TE>
<TE>   In a small bowl, whisk together the mustard, lemon juice, 3/4
teaspoon of salt, generous grinds of pepper and the tablespoon of
water until well blended. Whisk in 2 to 3 tablespoons of olive oil.
Place the cabbage mixture in a shallow serving bowl or on a platter.
Roughly chop the eggs (the yolks should be a little runny) and place
them on top of the cabbage mixture. Pour the dressing over all. Add
salt and pepper if desired.</TE>

<LD>"A brandy made by Germain-Robin. They make several very nice alambic
brandies. This was a single barrel V138, that's a brandy made 100%
from Pinot Noir. It's very interesting because it has very nice and
elegant fruit, and it has extraordinary balance overall and finesse
on the palate. It's something special. You would probably have to pay
quite a bit more if you want something in that league from Cognac. I
had it after dinner, just sitting with friends. This is where brandy
is really a wonderful thing."</LD>

<LD>DEAR SOS: Quite a few years ago you printed a recipe for shrimp in
pepper that was awesome. It was sauteed in butter, garlic and two
kinds of pepper. I remember that the sauce was great soaked up with
French bread, and that the shrimp was spicier if cooked with shells
off.</LD>
<LD>   CARRIE ZELLER</LD>
<LD>   Lake Elsinore</LD>
<TE>   DEAR CARRIE: This recipe ran in 1987. And yes, the sauce is great
soaked up with bread, and the shrimp will be spicier if the shells
are removed before cooking.</TE>

<HD>Souvlaki: Smoke and Sizzle</HD>
<DH>The Irresistible Charms of Greece's National Fast Food</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE KOCHILAS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>ATHENS</DL>
<LD>The craving for souvlaki comes over me about once a month. I am
usually in the center of town when that irresistible waft--the scent
of grilled meat (either pork or lamb), garlic and oregano, coupled
with the smell of warm, doughy pita bread--hits. The Greeks have a
word for it: tsikna, the meaning of which encompasses both sound
(i.e., the sizzle) and smell (that of pleasantly charred meat).</LD>
<LD>   I usually give in to temptation at one of several favorite holes
in the wall. These are places where the atmosphere is decidedly
minimal but where some inevitably gruff yet skilled grill man turns
out beautiful pita wraps filled with coal-roasted meat and dripping
with tzatziki (the yogurt-cucumber-garlic sauce), warm tomatoes,
thinly sliced onions and the juices of all of them combined. In
Greece, they say that you can learn to cook but that you have to be
born with the talent to grill.</LD>
<LD>   There is no other street food that casts its spell on me like
good--and, yes, greasy--souvlaki. What hot dogs are to the streets of
Manhattan and fries and mayo to Amsterdam, souvlaki and its equally
tempting sister, gyro, is to Athens.</LD>
<TE>   Gyros, which are frequently mistaken for souvlakia, are made by
stacking thin sheets of various meats on an upright skewer about 2
feet high and grilling the whole thing in a sort of vertical
rotisserie for hours until all the meats meld indistinguishably
together. Gyros don't come in cubes, like souvlaki. Rather, the
browned meat is masterfully sliced off so that it falls like shards
into the pita wrap. The tomato-tzatziki-onion accompaniments are the
same for both.</TE>
<TE>   Prosaic but satisfying, souvlaki is probably the best-known Greek
dish. It is certainly one that has been exported the world over. In
the process, both at its source and abroad, it is sometimes
transformed from hand-held, stand-up street food to a full mounded
platter overflowing with cubes of tangy, tender skewered and grilled
meat set over soft pita and served with fries, Greek salad and
tzatziki.</TE>
<TE>   It is a dish indelibly tied to the remotest past, to the tradition
of roasting whole animals skewered on a spit, the stuff of mythic
heroic feasts. Spit-roasting is a custom that survives to this day,
in the form of the whole lamb savored throughout the country at
Easter.</TE>
<TE>   The word "souvlaki" is the diminutive of "souvla," skewer. The
"little skewers" were traditionally made from a kind of reed but
nowadays are more likely to be made from metal or wood. The metal
skewers, often complete with a heat-proof handle for serving, are
usually used to make larger meal-size portions in which the cubed
lamb or pork is interspersed with slices of green peppers, onions and
tomatoes. The small wooden skewers are for individual, hand-held
snacks.</TE>
<TE>   The meat can either be removed and wrapped in a pita with all the
preferred accompaniments or savored alone, plucked bite by bite
straight off the little skewer, which usually is proffered with a
slice of bread stuck onto its pointy tip.</TE>
<TE>   Souvlaki has evolved to include not only lamb and pork, but also
chicken, turkey, veal and beef, and certain types of fish, those that
are meaty enough to be threaded and to hold up over a grill.
Swordfish souvlaki has been a longtime favorite in Greek fish taverns
and restaurants. In recent years, Greek chefs have presented skewered
and grilled octopus, too. In light of all the meat scares in Europe,
vegetarian souvlaki is also beginning to appear here.</TE>
<TE>   Tradition dies hard among Greeks, though, so pork and lamb still
remain the favorites. Some grilling aficionados prescribe marinating
the meat first, especially if lamb is being used. Olive oil, fresh
lemon juice, garlic and oregano make the most typical marinade,
although sometimes wine is used too.</TE>
<TE>   There are variations on all the trappings as well. For example,
the traditional tzatziki might be replaced with a more esoteric
recipe of thick, strained yogurt mixed with shredded carrots as
opposed to cucumbers. In any event, garlicky tzatziki is always
optional, and raw onions are not to everyone's liking either.</TE>
<TE>   If the souvlaki cook happens to hail from the north of Greece, or
from the Greek diaspora around the Black Sea, he is more than likely
to sprinkle a hearty dose of cayenne over the meat once it is grilled
and wrapped, or to serve up a long metal skewer of marinated lamb or
pork, without any vegetables but topped with a heap of paper-thin
slices of raw onion. Cumin is another spice that sometimes finds its
way into either the marinade or the end product just before serving
it. More than a few souvlaki stands also fit four or five thin French
fries between the pita, the meat and the vegetables.</TE>
<TE>   The pita itself is also part of the art. In Greece, hand-held
souvlaki is wrapped in a doughy kind of pita bread, not in the thin
kind of pita bread with a pre-cut pocket. The bread can be grilled
over coals with or without any fat or it can be cooked on a griddle,
in which case it turns out slightly more cushiony.</TE>
<TE>   As all the elements come together, the souvlaki should be
assembled with lightning speed, the pita filled and rolled and then
swaddled in pre-cut sheets of wax or parchment paper, so that all
those savory juices stay safely within. When it is made to be served
as a whole meal, though, the meat is sometimes removed from the
skewer and placed over a piece of warm pita on a large plate. The
tzatziki and fries are on the side.</TE>
<TE>   All of this, of course, can more or less be replicated at home,
provided that you have that innate knack for grilling. A good
barbecue or a broiler will work. The only requirement is that it will
get hot enough. While souvlaki may be simple to make, real tsikna
doesn't come easily.</TE>

and pepper to taste in a bowl and toss in the lamb cubes. Cover and
refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 3 hours.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the grill to medium-high or the broiler.</TE>
<TE>   Alternately thread the meat, peppers, onions, tomatoes and bay
leaves onto the skewers. Brush the skewers with the marinade. If
broiling, place the skewers on a rack over a pan to keep the juices
from dripping into the oven and broil about 4 inches from the heat
source or place the skewers on the grill. Brush occasionally with a
little of the marinade. The souvlaki will need about 6 to 7 minutes
per side for rare, about 8 to 10 minutes for medium, and about 12 for
well-done.</TE>
<TE>   While the skewers are cooking, lightly brush the pita bread with
some of the remaining 3 tablespoons of oil and either pan-fry
lightly, preferably in a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat, or
place on a cast-iron griddle or directly on the grill rack. Turn,
brush the other side with the oil and grill lightly, 1 to 2 minutes
total. The bread should not toast, but rather should be soft and
pliant.</TE>
<TE>   Serve the souvlaki on the skewer over the bread, accompanied if
desired with Tzatziki and Greek Pan-Fried Potatoes.</TE>

<TE>   Active Work Time: 35 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 45 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Greek kefalotyri or kefalograviera cheese can be found at Greek
markets.</TE>
<TE>   Olive oil</TE>
<TE>   8 large white boiling potatoes or Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   1 to 1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano, preferably Greek</TE>
<TE>   3 to 4 tablespoons grated Greek kefalotyri or kefalograviera
cheese, optional</TE>
<TE>   1 lemon, cut into quarters, optional</TE>
<TE>   Cut the potatoes into 1/8-inch-thick slices and pat dry.</TE>
<TE>   Heat about 1/2 inch of olive oil in a large, preferably cast-iron,
skillet over high heat. The oil should be hot but not smoking. Test
it by dropping in one potato slice; it should "boil," as the Greeks
say, throwing off lots of bubbling foam. Add just a handful of
potatoes at a time, no more than can fit in one layer in the skillet.</TE>
<TE>   Cover the skillet and reduce the heat to medium. This is a
particularly Greek home-cooking technique. The potatoes fry and
"boil" in the oil, thus cooking on the inside thoroughly.</TE>
<TE>   After about 6 or 7 minutes, carefully lift the lid, and with a
two-pronged long fork check the bottom of the potatoes. They should
have begun to acquire some color. Gently turn the potato slices, one
by one if possible, to fry on the other side. Fry until deep
golden-yellow and just lightly browned. Remove with a slotted spoon,
drain in a colander or on paper towels and continue, adding more
olive oil to the skillet if necessary, until all the potatoes are
fried.</TE>
<TE>   To serve, place the potatoes on a large platter and toss with salt
to taste, the oregano and grated cheese, if using. If you like your
potatoes crunchy, do not squeeze lemon over them; if you don't mind a
soft fry and like the tang of lemon, then douse them according to
taste.</TE>

<HD>Like California Syrah? Try Its French Ancestor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES E. OLKEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California Syrahs are becoming popular, but we shouldn't overlook
their French parents. It is interesting to taste the two side by side
and see how they compare.</LD>
<LD>   Syrah's home in France is the northern Rhone Valley. For much of
the 20th century, these wines--particularly Hermitage and Cote
Rotie--were mentioned in the same breath as the reds of Bordeaux and
Burgundy. Today, for the most part, they are overshadowed.</LD>
<LD>   Still, there are a few northern Rhones that can command the same
prices as all but the most highly prized wines from Bordeaux and
Burgundy. Producers such as Guigal, Chave and Jaboulet are making
outstanding wines in Hermitage and Cote-Rotie, as well as in hitherto
less well-known villages such as Cornas, St. Joseph and
Crozes-Hermitage</LD>
<TE>   How do these Syrahs compare with the Californians? Generally, they
are less rustic than their New World counterparts. They may be less
full in body and lower in alcohol, but they yield nothing to
California in terms of intensity and complexity.</TE>
<TE>   ** 1998 Chapoutier Hermitage "La Sizeranne," $50. This full-scaled
Syrah certainly lives up to our expectations for Hermitage. Unlike so
many of its California kin, it is able to find weight and plenty of
fruit without resorting to high alcohol and searing heat. It was one
of the few Rhones in our tasting to exhibit the gamy edge that is so
common in California and Washington Syrahs.</TE>
<TE>   1999 Bernard Chave Crozes-Hermitage, $12. Chave is poorly
represented by this inexpensive offering, which heads off into herbs
and earth rather than the more typical spice and blackberry fruit of
Syrah. This wine reminds us that, despite occasional successes,
Crozes-Hermitage is a flatland appellation, and its wines bear little
resemblance to the real Hermitage from the hillsides above it.</TE>
<TE>   ** 1999 August Clape Cornas "Renaissance," $40. Cornas, in the
rugged hillsides south of Hermitage, can have much the same power as
its storied neighbor, though usually with less finesse. Nevertheless,
this rich, flavorful bottling from so-called "younger" vines (about
20 years old) is actually less coarse and gruff than the Chapoutier
Hermitage above. It is filled with solid fruit and complex notes of
smoke and spice. If not up to decades of aging, it still offers lots
of potential for those who would like to lay some away.</TE>
<TE>   $** 1999 Philippe Faury St. Joseph, $24. From an appellation that
is even farther south and embraces a variety of growing settings,
this wine is so ripe and rich that it challenges its more expensive
neighbors. It carries a bit more flesh than they do, and is
reminiscent of California in that regard, though it is less tannic
and coarse in construction. California producers could take a lesson
here.</TE>
<TE>   * 1998 E. Guigal Cote Rotie "Chateau d'Ampuis," $80. This exciting
effort and the Bernard Guy wine that follows are examples of the
depth and richness found in Cote Rotie. For Chateau d'Ampuis, Guigal
blends fruit from several of his top vineyards. In this vintage, the
wine takes on extracted, ripe blackberry flavors with seasonings of
cocoa, vanilla and dark roasted coffee. Its tannins are substantial
and some of the typical Cote Rotie raciness is lost to oak and
ripeness and for the moment that keeps it from a second star. Still,
this wine may soften into great beauty with aging.</TE>
<TE>   ** 1999 Bernard Guy Cote Rotie, $38. Some Syrah lovers insist that
the grape can combine the sinew of the best Cabernet Sauvignons and
the suppleness of the best Pinot Noirs, and this is one wine that
bears that out. This is a Syrah of remarkable elegance. Its perfume
of raspberries, violets and sweet spices are followed on the palate
by a wine that is wholly lacking in coarseness yet has a solid spine
of integrated tannins.</TE>
<TE>   1998 Paul Jaboulet Aine Hermitage "La Chapelle," $70. This vintage
of a fabled combination of producer and vineyard winds up
surprisingly overdeveloped and somewhat enervated, even while
displaying the weight and density of Hermitage. Its first notes of
fruit and roasted spice are right on course, but then the wine's
acidity butts in and its early fruit gives up a bit too easily.</TE>
<TE>   $ 2000 Earl Georges Vernay Vin de Pays des Collines "Rhodaniens,"
$10. This is an example of the values that can occasionally be found
when good grapes are planted in areas with little pedigree but much
potential. It is a mid-sized, plummy wine with a bit of varietal
black pepper spice and a bit more richness in body and texture than
it has in flavor.</TE>
<TE>   1998 Alain Voges Cornas, $30. This is Cornas as it has been known
forever. Bold, tough, ripe, deep and very much wanting polish, it's
more rustic than coarse or crude. Its pleasing fruit and evident
tannin come without the heat that accompanies many West Coast wines.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Symbols</TE>
<TE>   ***A world-class wine, superb by any measure, the top 1% to 2% of
all wines tasted.</TE>
<TE>   **An exceptional wine, well worth the effort to find, 10% to 12%
of wines tasted.</TE>
<TE>   *An admirable wine, tasty, focused, attractive, about 25% of wines
tasted.</TE>
<TE>   No Rating: The best are quite pleasant and can be good buys when
moderately priced.</TE>
<TE>   $Good value for the money.</TE>
<TE>   Below average quality, to be avoided.</TE>

starting Friday and is available only on Sundays. Haifa makes it with
beef roast, white beans, potatoes and hard-boiled eggs. The eggs are
colored brown with onion skins.</LD>
<LD>   Orders of hamin come with pita bread and three salads: marinated
beets, cabbage and carrot, and a Turkish salad that is more like a
spicy tomato salsa. To order in advance, call on Friday before 3
p.m., when the restaurant closes.</LD>

<HD>Coconut-Infused Curries, Brilliant Vegetable Dishes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA HANSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It seems odd that south Indian food has made so little headway in
Southern California, where northern tandoori cooking and Mogul
curries predominate. True, a few restaurants serve dosais, idlis,
vadais and such, but the broad range of southern cooking, with its
exciting coconut-infused curries and brilliant vegetarian dishes, is
largely unknown.</LD>
<LD>   Aside from traveling in south India, or having south Indian
friends, the only way to access this food is through cookbooks. The
latest of the few that have trickled onto the market is "Healthy
South Indian Cooking" by Alamelu Vairavan and Patricia Marquardt
(Hippocrene Books, $24.95).</LD>
<LD>   Vairavan was born in Chettinad, south of Chennai (Madras), and has
included recipes from that little-known area in the book. She now
lives in Milwaukee. Marquardt heads the classical languages program
at Marquette University and became Vairavan's collaborator because
the two are neighbors and friends. Adding to the book's informal
charm are photographs of recipes and ingredients by Vairavan's
husband.</LD>
<TE>   The word "healthy" in the title is not used lightly. Vairavan is a
health information management supervisor at a long-term care facility
in Milwaukee and has taught cooking at hospitals there. Nutritional
analyses accompany the recipes. Most are vegetarian. Just a handful
involve meat, seafood or eggs.</TE>
<TE>   The recipes will intrigue anyone fond of vegetables for they offer
a new approach to seasoning. Glossaries explain spices, dals
(legumes) and other essentials, as well as south Indian food terms
such as poriyal, kootu and kulambu.</TE>
<TE>   You can't generalize about south Indian "cuisine," because it
comes from such a large area--the states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala,
Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh--and even within those states it varies
from place to place and among different communities. What could be
complex becomes relatively simple in Vairavan's approach, which
concentrates on common vegetables and seasonings that are readily
available, as long as you're willing to visit an Indian market.</TE>

<HD>Wine of the Week</HD>
<DH>Henriques &amp; Henriques Madeira Verdelho 15 years, Madeira,
Portugal</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. Irene Virbila</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Madeira has fallen out of fashion, but in the 18th and 19th centuries
it had cachet. In fact, this sweet fortified wine from an island in
the Atlantic was the one used in 1776 to toast the signing of the
Declaration of Independence, according to the "Oxford Companion to
Wine." Today, most of us only know cooking Madeira, the cheap kind
often thrown into sauces.</LD>
<LD>   To get to know Madeira better, consider this 15-year-old bottling
made from the Verdelho grape. Amber in color, with a scent of toasted
hazelnuts, a taste of deep brown sugar and a flush of warmth in the
finish, it's every bit as complex and compelling as a great vin santo
from Tuscany. A decade and a half of aging has muted its sweetness
and taken its flavors down a tone.</LD>
<LD>   Savor a small glass after dinner with a cookie, and save a splash
to make a sauce to see what a difference a good Madeira can make.
(The same producer also makes a 10-year-old Verdelho.)</LD>

<HD>Out of Step, but With a Big Swagger</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Americans love swagger. Or many do. It's part of our collective
character. Our entertainments, our fashions, our heroes and
antiheroes draw from the common well. No matter how diverse and
discordant we become, which is to say plenty these days, swagger is
tradition shared.</LD>
<LD>   It also explains one of the curiosities of American politics.</LD>
<LD>   On paper, George W. Bush is out of step with America, in important
places way out of step. But his gait is good. He gets away with it
and prospers by swagger.</LD>
<TE>   The country, for instance, has changed in 30 years. Polls show
that strong majorities of citizens view themselves as
conservationists. Science and common sense tell us there is little
time to dally and no good reason to. Bush laughs in the face of this
and pursues polluting, consumption policies more in tune with half a
century ago. And he remains resiliently popular.</TE>
<TE>   The greatest business scandal of the age swallows up the hopes of
thousands of Americans and the trust of millions. Who was cozy with
the top cats who brought Enron down? Back-slapping buddies, Texas
oilmen in the cause; our president and vice president argue for still
bigger tax breaks for the well-off and more wide-open freedom for
business. They swagger on a cushion of public approval.</TE>
<TE>   Democracy isn't supposed to work this way, at least in the
operator's manual they give us in civics class. But politics isn't
purely mechanical, is it? Self-interest and shared values do not
necessarily add up to a winner's score. Far from it. Politics, like
love, answers to the dizzy side of the cerebrum.</TE>
<TE>   The man who did not earn the popular vote just 16 months ago now
commands wartime loyalty. When citizens of other countries object to
American highhandedness and call the president a cowboy, they are not
entirely incorrect. They should have learned by now that vast numbers
of Americans, including those lightly ballasted multitudes whose
support floats up and down whimsically in the polls, tend to view the
arena of foreign affairs as either someone else's problem or the OK
Corral.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's uncompromising approach to domestic affairs is much the
same, and so far without contrary results.</TE>
<TE>   An astonishing four out of five Americans disagree with the
president on the big--let's say, defining--issues of Social Security
and tax cuts, according to the Los Angeles Times Poll. Even
Republicans, by more than a two-thirds margin, would rather cancel
the later stages of the president's tax-rate reduction to preserve
Social Security revenue.</TE>
<TE>   By a margin of 50% to 30%, the nation believes environmental
protection should outweigh economic growth. Nearly seven out of 10
Americans want to know the details of meetings between industry
barons and administration officials to devise Bush's energy plan.</TE>
<TE>   Yet when asked directly whether Bush's policies will move the
country in the wrong direction, only 19% of the country said yes,
according to a survey last month by the Gallup organization.</TE>
<TE>   I am not an insider, so I don't know how this is officially
explained in Washington. From time to time, I hear the gloaters argue
that it's as simple as "you gotta stand for something" and people
will back you, even if they are, poor things, disposed to stand for
something else. In the marketing idiom of pollsters, we hear that
Bush is a leader in the authoritarian Daddy mold, in contrast to the
solicitous Mommy image of the Democrats, so shut up and eat your
spinach. Perhaps. Or maybe these are just different ways of
describing swagger.</TE>
<TE>   The late Lee Atwater, the hard-boiled GOP consultant behind Bush's
father, taught me the important lesson that politics, contrary to
what the nearsighted believe, isn't local but cultural.</TE>
<TE>   For a time in the late 1980s before his health failed, Atwater and
I would escape the campaign trail to talk about books or take walks
in the sunshine along the beach path in Venice. John Wayne and the
Oakland Raiders displayed one kind of swagger, but Atwater identified
it elsewhere, and almost everywhere, in Americana--in the Dust Bowl
folk music of Woody Guthrie, in the ghetto novels of heroin junkie
Donald Goines and in the poseurs at Muscle Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Atwater never said as much to me, but I sensed his frustration
with the elder Bush's incapacity to shed his genteel skin and stride
like he knew how in those hand-tooled cowboy boots. I am pretty sure
that Atwater would have been proud of the old man's son.</TE>
<TE>   For all the day's fury over issues and ideology, domestic politics
sometimes is about the kick in your step rather than where you're
going.</TE>

<HD>First Test of the Biotech Age: Human Cloning</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM KRISTOL and JEREMY RIFKIN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The prospect of a Brave New World creates strange new bedfellows,
including us, a hawkish Reagan Republican and a dovish left
intellectual and activist. But the issues of the biotech age invite
all of us to think anew.</LD>
<LD>   Issue No. 1: human cloning, to be debated in the U.S. Senate in
the next few weeks. Will we be content to frame the discussion in the
old terms of religion versus science or "pro-life" versus
"pro-choice"? Or are we willing to see that the debate is over two
distinct views of human life and the good society?</LD>
<LD>   On one side are the utilitarians, who range from libertarians on
the right to biotech companies in the center to nonjudgmental
liberals on the left. These advocates of cloning see life in terms of
markets, patents and progress; individual autonomy, profits and
personal choice.</LD>
<TE>   On the other side are those who believe in the intrinsic value of
human life. Some are religious and moral conservatives, others
economic and ecological progressives. But all share a respect for the
human and the natural and oppose efforts to reduce human life and its
various parts and stages to the status of mere research tools and
manufactured products.</TE>
<TE>   The utilitarians want to proceed with the production of embryonic
human clones to be used for experiments and then destroyed. They
argue that the potential medical advances of harvesting stem cells
from cloned human embryos for medical research justify going ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Those of us who hold to the intrinsic value of life--whatever we
may think about a woman's right to have an abortion--believe that
creating embryonic clones for research and eventually for the
creation of spare body parts is unethical. However, we strongly
support continued research on adult stem cells, which has proved
promising in recent clinical trials.</TE>
<TE>   Legislation sponsored by Sens. Sam Brownback (R-Kan.) and Mary
Landrieu (D-La.), almost identical to what passed the House last year
265 to 162, would ban all human cloning, including the creation of
cloned human embryos for medical experiments--so-called therapeutic
cloning.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, bills introduced by Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.)
and Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) would ban only "reproductive cloning"--the
implantation of cloned embryos with the intent of initiating a
pregnancy. In fact, the widespread practice of "therapeutic" cloning,
which would be allowed in the Feinstein and Harkin bills, would make
a ban on reproductive cloning virtually unenforceable because there
would be so many cloned embryos available. These bills would, in
effect, authorize the creation of human clones and then mandate their
destruction.</TE>
<TE>   If using a 12-day-old cloned embryo for producing cells and
tissues is morally acceptable, what about harvesting more developed
cells from, say, an 8-week-old embryo? Or harvesting organs from a
5-month-old cloned fetus, if it were found to be a more useful
medical therapy?</TE>
<TE>   What's more, creating cloned embryos for research would require
donated eggs. This is a dangerous procedure, which could lead to the
exploitation of young and poor women, who might be wrongfully seduced
by offers of payment for their eggs.</TE>
<TE>   Most important, cloning of a human raises fundamental questions
that go to the very nature of what it means to be human.</TE>
<TE>   Humans have always thought of the birth of their children as a
gift bestowed by God or a beneficent nature. In its place, the new
cloned progeny would become the ultimate shopping experience,
designed in advance, produced to specification and purchased in the
biological marketplace. A child would no longer be a unique creation
but rather an engineered reproduction.</TE>
<TE>   Human cloning opens the door to a commercial eugenics
civilization. Life science companies already have patented both human
embryos and stem cells, giving them ownership and control of a new
form of reproductive commerce with frightening implications for the
future of society.</TE>
<TE>   As the Senate prepares to debate, we should not be fooled about
the stakes. This is the first major test of the biotech age, a moment
of decision for a civilization that may have gone too far already in
the commercialization and destruction of the human and ecological
worlds.</TE>
<TE>   Do we have the wisdom and the political and moral will to say
stop?</TE>

<HD>Don't Cut Off Prisoners From Their Families</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRY A. KUPERS and CASSIE PIERSON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three-year-old Michael regularly visits his mother in prison. He
plays with her on the floor, gets reassuring hugs while sitting on
her lap and kisses her goodbye when it's time to leave. But if the
California Department of Corrections gets its way, Michael will be
able to visit his mother only through a glass partition and talk to
her over a telephone--no touching, no kisses.</LD>
<LD>   The Corrections Department has scheduled public hearings in
Sacramento about proposed changes to visiting regulations that would
profoundly affect prisoners, their families and the communities to
which most will someday return. These proposed "tough on criminals"
regulations would cause tremendous hardship on thousands of children,
family members and friends of people in prison.</LD>
<LD>   Under the new visiting rules, prisoners convicted of "possession
for sale and/or manufacture" of drugs would be forbidden contact
visits for the first year of their confinement. This would
particularly affect California's women prisoners, 42% of whom serve
time for drug-related crimes and at least 80% of whom are mothers. In
addition, all visitors, children included, would have to undergo
criminal background checks before being approved for visiting. Male
prisoners, regardless of their crimes, would be forbidden from
holding children older than 7 on their laps during visits.</LD>
<TE>   Under the new regulations, only immediate family and attorneys
would be able to visit prisoners who are in so-called security
housing units--confined to their cells 23 hours a day because they
are accused of violating prison rules. Corrections does not recognize
domestic partnerships or same-sex relationships as family.</TE>
<TE>   Consider the extreme psychological damage to a person denied
contact with the outside world for years at a time. According to
Corey Weinstein of the watchdog group California Prison Focus,
secure-housing prisoners "already live under excessively harsh
conditions as stated by the United Nations Committee Against Torture.
It is cruel to deny them visits with friends and loved ones."</TE>
<TE>   How much punishment is enough?</TE>
<TE>   There is strong consensus among mental health professionals that
maintaining family and community ties through visitation increases a
prisoner's chance at rehabilitation.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, quality visitation between children and their parents
increases the likelihood that families can heal and move beyond the
prison experience.</TE>
<TE>   Because of separation from their parents, children of prisoners
are six times more likely to get caught up in the criminal justice
system themselves. The proposed new policy would only make children's
relationships with their imprisoned parents more fragile.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed changes in visiting rules amount to cruel and inhuman
punishment for both prisoners and their loved ones. And by lessening
the chances for rehabilitation and consigning another generation to
the system, the rules are not in the long-term interests of the rest
of us.</TE>

<HD>Now Isn't the Time to Lose 'Nightline'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TARA SONENSHINE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The tension in the air was palpable that day. It was March 1985 and
television history was about to be made. In a small church in
Johannesburg, South Africa, Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu fidgeted
nervously in his chair.</LD>
<LD>   Hundreds of miles away in Cape Town, in another mock studio, South
African Foreign Minister Pik Botha adjusted his tie. At an anchor
desk at the South African Broadcasting Corp., Ted Koppel looked into
the monitors that displayed his two guests--men who had never really
talked to each other, let alone publicly debated.</LD>
<LD>   Back in the U.S., "Nightline" viewers were about to see a live,
unedited debate between a leading anti-apartheid activist and a South
African government minister at the height of tensions between blacks
and whites in that country. The next day, South African citizens
would see the same program.</LD>
<TE>   Not only was it riveting television, it was a pivotal moment in
the unfolding story of apartheid. The Tutu-Botha debate on
"Nightline" was the first in a weeklong series of television programs
from South Africa that ABC News boldly aired in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   It was one of many high-quality, pioneering "Nightline" programs
that have been broadcast from hot spots around the globe over the
past two decades.</TE>
<TE>   But now "Nightline" finds itself in the middle of a debate about
its own fate. Top executives from the Walt Disney Co., which owns ABC
and its news division, have signaled that they may be prepared to
dump "Nightline" to make way for more lucrative programming, even if
Disney can't snare David Letterman from CBS.</TE>
<TE>   Such a move would not only deprive viewers of an important source
of news and information and a deeply respected anchorman, it would be
a troubling sign of media disengagement from the world at this very
dangerous time in our history.</TE>
<TE>   How ironic that Disney's top brass would consider removing a
serious news program from America's news diet in the middle of a war
on terrorism. And that the program they would choose to target would
be "Nightline," which was born out of the Iranian hostage crisis in
1979.</TE>
<TE>   Our nation awakened to a harsh reality Sept. 11. We are not safe
from those dark corners of the globe where terrible things happen in
countries whose names we cannot remember. Just as the world has grown
increasingly interconnected, Disney risks cutting us off from a
program that takes us to pivotal, faraway places where events and
strangers affect our security.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, "Nightline" traveled to Congo for a weeklong series of
programs on that war-torn nation in a part of the world where few
Americans go but all need to understand.</TE>
<TE>   As this public spat between ABC News and Disney is unfolding in
New York and California, a "Nightline" producer and correspondent are
traveling throughout Kazakhstan and other former Soviet republics,
many of whose names we cannot pronounce but where American soldiers
are becoming deeply engaged.</TE>
<TE>   Disney is considering yanking "Nightline" at a moment when the
Middle East is boiling over. Koppel's program returned again and
again over the years to the seemingly intractable problems of the
Middle East, bringing clarity and understanding to one of the most
persistent of global conflicts.</TE>
<TE>   Disney may replace a serious news broadcast with a comedy show
just at the time when the United States is sending troops to places
like the Philippines, about which Americans know so little.</TE>
<TE>   There is a vital need for context and perspective on these issues
and places.</TE>
<TE>   For years, with the steady decline of international news coverage,
we have gotten little more than a snapshot of the world in which we
live, with the exception of programs like "Nightline." Fewer and
fewer overseas bureaus, fewer and fewer foreign correspondents and
less and less time devoted to international stories. Our field of
vision has narrowed, eroding public interest in the lives and
cultures of others.</TE>
<TE>   But, after Sept. 11, we know that we can no longer afford the
luxury of insularity. The price of ignorance is simply too high.</TE>
<TE>   One final irony: It is Disney that brought us a theme park
designed to remind us that "it's a small world, after all."</TE>
<TE>   Precisely the point.</TE>

<HD>Internet Venture Putting Squeeze Play on Baseball</HD>
<DH>Tech: RealNetworks will offer quick-hit highlights of major
league games in a new compressed format.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Major League Baseball and RealNetworks Inc. said Tuesday that they
are teaming up to deliver condensed online replays of baseball games,
adapting the deliberate pace of the national pastime to the short
attention spans of the Internet.</LD>
<LD>   The 20-minute digital videos provide less than a complete game but
more than a highlights package, enabling viewers to see all the plays
but none of the buildup.</LD>
<LD>   No price has been set for the games, which will be available only
to subscribers of premium online services from Major League Baseball
or RealNetworks. The condensed versions will debut on opening day and
will be available about 90 minutes after the last pitch is thrown in
each game on the field.</LD>
<TE>   The new offering is the latest attempt by a major sports
organization to wring more revenue out of the Net. Baseball, the NBA
and NASCAR all have joined forces with Real to charge fans for access
to audio or video feeds online, replacing free services with
subscription-based offerings.</TE>
<TE>   Major League Baseball and RealNetworks struck their first deal
last year, a three-year pact that was to deliver $20million in cash
and services to baseball. Any revenue generated by the condensed
games would be split between the two and would come on top of the
$20million, said RealNetworks spokeswoman Lisa Amore.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball officials charged $9.95 last year to listen to a season's
worth of games online, and RealNetworks included the games in its
$9.95 monthly package of online audio-visual services. The condensed
games are expected to command an additional fee.</TE>
<TE>   The condensed games take to an extreme efforts by Major League
Baseball to speed the game. Although total attendance at ballparks
has risen, the audience for televised games has declined
significantly, and the league has been under pressure from some
quarters to increase the pace of the contests.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Bowman, who runs the league's interactive media arm, said the
condensed games should coexist peacefully with their live
counterparts simply because there are far more games than the typical
fan can attend or watch on TV.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel that this is merely a morsel, an appetizer, and the fans
will come to appreciate even more the beauty, the elegance, the sheer
pageantry of the game of baseball," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Rob Glaser, chief executive of RealNetworks and a minority owner
of the Seattle Mariners, said baseball was responding to a need.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been a long-term trend where people have been saying,
[despite] our hyper-fast-paced lifestyle, baseball games have gotten
longer over the past 20 years, not shorter," Glaser said. "So a lot
of people say, 'That's not the direction that I either want to go in
or I can afford to take the time to go in given my busy life.' So
we're providing another choice."</TE>
<TE>   He added: "There are going to be all these baseball
traditionalists who will liken this to the designated hitter ... or
whatever is your favorite act of blasphemy. But to me, one of the
beauties of this is we haven't touched the product on the field. The
sanctity of the church has not been disturbed in any way, shape or
form.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just giving people the ability to gain access to that and
make it more accessible. We'll find out whether this is something
that appeals to kids, because they like things more fast-paced, or it
appeals to busy businesspeople or busy parents. I think it will find
an audience."</TE>
<TE>   Ken Hirdt, a researcher with the Elias Sports Bureau, said the
condensed games pose no threat to baseball. "People will still want
to watch a whole game," he said, although they might turn to the
online versions to catch up quickly on a game they missed.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Bob Gorman, a baseball historian who is the top reference
librarian at Winthrop University in South Carolina, was troubled by
aspects of the condensed games.</TE>
<TE>   The online versions will show only action that produces outs or
moves baserunners, eliminating much of the context for those events.
Gorman said a viewer would see a batter whiffing on a fastball but
not the pitch before it that set him up for the strikeout.</TE>
<TE>   "This goes along with how we're presented with the news," he said.
"People no longer have the patience for the analysis. That just plays
into the whole 'I want it fast and I want it now' kind of attitude we
have in this country."</TE>

<HD>Get Loan Rate Based on Your Credit Score</HD>
<DH>Money: Web site is first to let consumers see how lenders
determine interest for mortgage, car financing. Some say it won't
help most targets of predatory practices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Consumers for the first time can see how their credit scores affect
the interest rates they're offered on mortgages and auto loans,
thanks to an Internet tool unveiled Tuesday by leading credit-scoring
company Fair, Isaac &amp; Co.</LD>
<LD>   Consumers who know their three-digit credit score can go to
www.myfico.com to see what rates are being offered to people in their
state with similar credit scores.</LD>
<LD>   San Rafael-based Fair Isaac said it hoped the information would
help consumers evaluate loan terms and avoid predatory lenders
charging exorbitant rates.</LD>
<TE>   Although several other Internet sites, including Bankrate.com,
offer comparative interest rate information, none sorts that
information by credit score.</TE>
<TE>   "A consumer who is wondering if a particular loan offer is fair
... could check the posted interest rates on our site and compare
those rates to the lender's offer," said Craig Watts, spokesman for
Fair Isaac.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer advocates, however, said most consumers targeted by
predatory lenders don't have easy access to the Internet and don't
understand the importance of credit scores or how to determine what
their score is.</TE>
<TE>   "Just looking at the Web site, it's not written for financially
unsophisticated people," said Consumer Action's Guadalupe Aguilar, a
consumer advocate who deals with predatory lending issues.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure it serves a good purpose for a limited audience, but it
would not serve the people who we might want it to serve."</TE>
<TE>   Credit scores are three-digit numbers, typically ranging from 500
to 850, that are used by lenders to determine credit-worthiness and
set interest rates paid by borrowers.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers sometimes can learn their credit scores from a lender
after they have applied for a loan. People also can find out their
scores by paying $12.95 to the MyFico Web site, a joint venture
between Fair Isaac and credit bureau Equifax.</TE>
<TE>   According to Fair Isaac's Web site, lenders are offering someone
with the best credit score--in the 720-to-850 range--an average
interest rate of 6.556% for a 30-year mortgage in California.</TE>
<TE>   Someone with a lower score, in the 620-to-674 range, would be
offered the same mortgage at an 8.508% rate. Consumers with scores of
500 to 559 would face rates averaging 11.164%.</TE>
<TE>   The site's interest rate information is provided by Informa
Research Services Inc., a Calabasas-based financial research firm
that surveys lenders daily for interest rate information. Informa is
a division of London-based Informa Group.</TE>

<HD>Economic Signs Pointing to End of U.S. Recession</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The biggest part of the U.S. economy expanded in February at the
fastest pace in 15 months, an industry survey showed.</LD>
<LD>   The Institute for Supply Management's index of service companies,
builders and other non-manufacturing companies rose more than
expected. That adds to reports of factory growth for the first time
in 19 months, a rise in construction and increases in income and
spending that show the economy is rebounding from the recession that
began last March.</LD>
<LD>   "We were looking for a single, but we got a home run," said Scott
Brown, an economist at Raymond James &amp; Associates in St. Petersburg,
Fla. The services index has risen to "the kind of level that we were
seeing a couple of years ago when the economy was booming."</LD>
<TE>   The institute's index of nonmanufacturing business, which accounts
for about four-fifths of the U.S. economy, rose to 58.7 from 49.6 in
January. A reading above 50 signals expansion, and the index hasn't
been this high since November 2000. Analysts on average had expected
it to rise to 51.</TE>
<TE>   Orders at service companies also were the highest in 15 months,
reflecting rising sales at retailers. The new-orders index rose to
57.3 in February, the highest since November 2000, from 49.4 in
January. Nonmanufacturing inventories increased for the first time
since October 2000. Export orders rose for a third straight month,
Tuesday's report showed.</TE>
<TE>   The institute's index of prices paid, a measure of costs for
purchased materials and services, rose to 50 from 49. Costs increased
for construction, health services and real estate.</TE>
<TE>   A separate report showed the number of job cuts planned by U.S.
employers dropped in February to the lowest level in eight months.
Businesses announced plans to eliminate 128,155 positions, down 40%
from a month earlier, according to the job-placement firm Challenger,
Gray &amp; Christmas Inc.</TE>

<HD>Pacts With Enron May Be Loans in Disguise, Judge Says</HD>
<DH>Energy: J.P. Morgan's deals are questioned. Its request for
immediate payment of $1 billion in surety bonds is denied.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A federal judge said Tuesday that there was evidence J.P. Morgan
Chase &amp; Co. had extended a "disguised loan" to Enron Corp., which
could prevent Morgan from collecting on nearly $1 billion in surety
bonds.</LD>
<LD>   In a strongly worded ruling, U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff denied
J.P. Morgan's bid for a summary judgment to force 11 insurance
companies to immediately pay $965 million in bonds guaranteeing Enron
oil and natural gas contracts. He set a trial on the issue for Dec.
2.</LD>
<LD>   Legal experts said the judge's opinion was noteworthy for its
unusually blunt tone and because it reflected an independent judicial
analysis of a Wall Street firm's relationship with Enron.</LD>
<TE>   Rakoff said the oil and gas contracts between Enron and J.P.
Morgan "now appear to be nothing but a disguised loan."</TE>
<TE>   "The language is strikingly forceful," said David Skeel, a
University of Pennsylvania law professor. "This is a significant
ruling."</TE>
<TE>   Congress and federal regulators are seeking to determine whether
Wall Street firms such as J.P. Morgan helped Enron hide its weakening
financial position from investors, in part by disguising loans as
revenue-generating energy trades.</TE>
<TE>   The bank has argued that the insurers must pay off on bonds issued
to guarantee energy contracts between Enron and Mahonia Ltd., a J.P.
Morgan-affiliated entity. The bank says the claims were triggered
when Enron defaulted on its obligations after filing for bankruptcy
protection Dec. 2.</TE>
<TE>   The insurers have argued that Mahonia's contracts with Enron were
actually loans cloaked in the form of energy contracts, which were
structured to keep large amounts of debt from showing up on Enron's
balance sheet.</TE>
<TE>   The insurance companies said they never would have issued the
bonds if they had known the nature of the Enron agreements.</TE>
<TE>   They said that while Enron was selling gas and oil to Mahonia, it
was secretly buying it from entities controlled by Mahonia. The
ultimate effect, the firms claim, is that Enron borrowed money from
Morgan without selling any gas and oil.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Golden, a J.P. Morgan spokesman, denied that the contracts
were a sham and said that the case will prove that the insurance
companies must make good on the surety policies.</TE>
<TE>   "The good faith of the insurance companies will be on trial,"
Golden said. "Every client or counter-party to them will need to
question their ability or willingness to honor plain-vanilla
contracts."</TE>
<TE>   Keith Anderson, a spokesman for Travelers Property Casualty Corp.
in Hartford, Conn., declined to comment other than to say the judge's
words were "sufficiently eloquent."</TE>
<TE>   It is unusual for a judge to issue such a forcefully worded
opinion so early in a case, said two legal scholars who reviewed the
ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "With only a fraction of the evidence in, he feels comfortable
stating that there was a fraudulent scheme in the form of a disguised
loan," said Gordon Klein, a corporate law expert at UCLA's Anderson
business school. "These are very strong words indeed for a judge to
utter at this stage of a dispute."</TE>
<TE>   Citing evidence filed by the insurance companies, Rakoff labeled
as "suspicious" the way Enron traded gas back and forth.</TE>
<TE>   For example, on the same day that Enron sold gas to Mahonia, it
agreed to buy identical quantities from an entity called Stoneville
Aegean Ltd.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, Mahonia and Stoneville appear to be related, having
been set up by the same company and sharing the same director and
same shareholders, Rakoff wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Mahonia paid Enron $330 million, but Enron paid Stoneville $394
million, Rakoff wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The insurance companies claim that the payments were a way for
J.P. Morgan to advance cash to Enron and receive back what amounted
to its initial principal plus interest.</TE>

<HD>Ford Europe Regains Profit</HD>
<DH>Autos: Firm sees improving performance as a harbinger for
its U.S. business. GM still lags in turning around its operations in
a tough market.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRUCE STANLEY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>GENEVA</DL>
<LD>Ford Motor Co. has clawed its way back to profitability in Europe
even as it predicts the regional market will shrink for the second
consecutive year, company executives said Tuesday at Europe's
premiere auto show.</LD>
<LD>   General Motors Corp., meanwhile, acknowledged that it lags in
turning around its money-losing European business, but said it
expects fresh models from its Opel and Saab brands will boost its
share of the market and help it break even in Europe in 2003.</LD>
<LD>   Both auto makers portrayed Europe's fragmented market as one of
the toughest, especially during the current downturn when motorists
are thinking twice before buying. Ford sees its improving performance
in Europe as a harbinger for its U.S. business, whereas GM--satisfied
that its North American business has regained lost momentum--is
hoping this thrust will carry over into its European operations.</LD>
<TE>   "Ford of Europe is absolutely a bright spot for our company in a
difficult period. It's blazing a trail that the rest of the company
is trying to follow," Ford Chairman William Clay Ford said at the
media preview of the 72nd International Motor Show in Geneva.</TE>
<TE>   After losing about $1.2 billion in Europe in 2000, Ford began
slashing its production capacity to cut costs. It also set about
rejuvenating its product line. The average age of Ford's European
models now is 2.9 years, almost half what it was a few years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The company began regaining some of its lost market share, and
last year it broke even.</TE>
<TE>   "Ford of Europe is profitable again. It's been awhile since we
could say that," said the European unit's president, David
Thursfield.</TE>
<TE>   Ford's newest model is the Fusion, introduced in Geneva as an
"urban activity vehicle" targeted at young families. With a design
Ford said was inspired in part by modern athletic shoes, the Fusion
is a taller, chunkier version of the Fiesta passenger car.</TE>
<TE>   The Fusion should make a "significant" contribution to Ford's
profit in Europe, Thursfield said.</TE>
<TE>   Ford expects total European vehicle sales to slip this year to
16.9 million from 17.3 million in 2001. Last year's sales were down
from 17.8 million in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   GM sees an even more dramatic decline in regional sales this year
of as many as 1 million vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts note that GM, which has done better than expected in its
U.S. business, has been slower than Ford to make necessary
adjustments in its European operations. However, GM now is in the
midst of a plan called Project Olympia aimed at cutting costs and
boosting profit in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   GM Europe President Mike Burns dismissed negative comparisons with
Ford.</TE>
<TE>   "When Ford was losing money, GM was making money. We're just at a
different point in the [business] cycle," he said. "When these things
go bad, they take a long time to fix."</TE>

<HD>Global Sues Rival to Restore Service</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Carrier XO Communications had cut access to its
network. Key U.S. customers are affected, plaintiff says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Many of Global Crossing Ltd.'s key U.S. customers have been without
long-distance service since Friday, when a rival phone carrier cut
off Global's access to its network as part of an escalating dispute
between the two firms.</LD>
<LD>   The move by XO Communications Inc. marks the first major service
disruption for Global Crossing customers since the Bermuda-based
company filed for bankruptcy protection Jan. 28. If services are not
restored quickly, the dispute could further spook Global Crossing
customers and undermine efforts to resuscitate the telecommunications
company.</LD>
<LD>   Global Crossing fought back Tuesday with a lawsuit against XO that
seeks an immediate injunction from a bankruptcy judge ordering XO to
reinstate service to the affected customers. Global Crossing said
more than 120 U.S. customers--including several unidentified "key"
customers--were hooked up to Global Crossing services through lines
provided by XO, according to the lawsuit.</LD>
<TE>   Neither company responded to questions about the lawsuit. In court
papers, Global Crossing said XO was acting in retaliation for a
decision by Global Crossing to halt services to XO on Feb. 28 for
nonpayment of a delinquent bill of more than $600,000.</TE>
<TE>   Without the court's intervention, the affected customers would
have to wait up to 45 days for substitute connections to Global
Crossing or seek service from a competitor, the company said. Other
customers, fearing a similar disruption, probably would seek
alternative service as well, causing irreparable harm to Global
Crossing, according to the suit.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Tuesday, Rep. Louise McIntosh Slaughter (D-N.Y.) said she
received word that a House Financial Services subcommittee would hold
hearings examining the accounting practices at Global Crossing and
other companies. The telecommunications firm's accounting methods are
under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
FBI.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Citizens Communications Co. sued Global Crossing on
Tuesday, saying that it stood to lose more than $400 million if the
fiber-optic telephone network operator wasn't ordered to abide by an
agreement between the two companies.</TE>
<TE>   Stamford, Conn.-based Citizens agreed in July 2000 to buy most of
Global Crossing's local phone business, Frontier Corp., for about
$3.5 billion. Citizens said in a lawsuit filed in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in Manhattan that it could suffer the loss if Global Crossing
didn't make certain Internal Revenue Service filings agreed to by the
two companies.</TE>
<TE>   Neither company returned phone calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Continuing a string of changes on the boards at both Global
Crossing and subsidiary Asia Global Crossing, Global Crossing Chief
Executive John Legere resigned from the Asia Global Crossing board.
He was replaced by Carl Grivner, chief operating officer of the
parent company. Asia Global Crossing also named a new board member,
Jose Antonio Rios, as president of Global Crossing International.</TE>
<TE>   Also Tuesday, the judge handling Global Crossing's bankruptcy case
postponed a Thursday hearing that would have addressed concerns about
a proposed investment by Hutchison Whampoa and Singapore
Technologies. The hearing, which also will address procedures for
competing bids for Global Crossing, will be held March 13.</TE>

<HD>Homestore Board Member Resigns</HD>
<DH>Real estate: The departure of Cendant executive Richard
Smith reduces the number of directors to seven.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE WEDNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In another sign of eroding investor confidence in Homestore.com, the
chairman and chief executive of Cendant Corp.'s real estate unit
resigned Tuesday from the board of the struggling Westlake Village
Internet company.</LD>
<LD>   Cendant, Homestore's biggest shareholder, is the franchiser of
Coldwell Banker, Century 21 and ERA residential brokers. The New
York-based company owns an 18.5% stake in Homestore, or about 14
million shares, which it acquired when it sold its Move.com division
to Homestore in February 2001 for $575 million. Cendant wrote down
the value of its Homestore holdings to zero last month.</LD>
<LD>   Richard Smith's departure reduces the number of Homestore
directors to seven and, analysts say, signals a lack of confidence in
Homestore's ability to right itself amid a host of problems,
including nearly 20 lawsuits claiming the company and its former
executives enriched themselves at the expense of other shareholders.</LD>
<TE>   "This doesn't send a good message to Homestore's investors," said
Safa Rashtchy, a U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray analyst. "Smith's move is
symbolic that Homestore has problems that Cendant doesn't want to be
associated with."</TE>
<TE>   Homestore and Cendant declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Homestore tumbled 54% in November after the company
announced that its projected 2002 revenue would fail to meet
analysts' estimates. Shares fell 2 cents Tuesday to $1.14, down from
a 52-week high of $36.48 in July. Nasdaq is threatening to delist the
stock.</TE>
<TE>   Homestore, the leading home-sale listings provider on the Web,
announced in December that its board was looking into its accounting
practices. The company later said that it overstated revenue by as
much as $45million during 2000 and as much as $113 million in the
first three quarters of 2001. The inquiry led to the resignation of
Chief Executive Stuart Wolff.</TE>

<HD>HP Wins Key Support in Merger Fight</HD>
<DH>Deals: Advisor to major investors endorses proposed
acquisition of Compaq over Walter Hewlett's dissident plan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hewlett-Packard Co. on Tuesday scored the biggest victory so far in
its hard-fought campaign to take over Compaq Computer Corp., winning
the endorsement of an influential advisor to big investors.</LD>
<LD>   Institutional Shareholder Services said the $22-billion merger was
a better bet than a plan by dissident HP director Walter Hewlett for
the company to go it alone and reinvest in its profitable printing
business.</LD>
<LD>   "We believe that the Compaq merger provides a better means of
maximizing long-term value by exploiting the potential of all of HP's
assets, rather than just a single crown jewel," ISS said.</LD>
<TE>   With about 20% of HP shares committed to opposing the deal and a
much smaller number publicly in favor, opposition by ISS could have
left the merger's prospects all but dead. Now, HP's management may
have a slight edge ahead of a March 19 vote.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be very close. We're going to be down to examining
the chads," said J.P. Morgan analyst Daniel Kunstler. He said he
expected ISS to endorse the merger, but was surprised how unequivocal
the endorsement was.</TE>
<TE>   Hewlett and David Packard, both sons of the iconic Silicon Valley
company's founders, have led fierce opposition to the combination.
They say that HP, which is losing money in the computer business,
shouldn't tie itself to a rival even more deeply involved in personal
computers.</TE>
<TE>   HP contends that adding Compaq will give it a dominant position in
multiple markets, vastly increase HP's small services arm and allow
it to compete better in the big-computer arena against IBM Corp. and
Sun Microsystems Inc.</TE>
<TE>   ISS analysts met repeatedly with Hewlett, HP Chief Executive Carly
Fiorina and others involved in the costly and contentious proxy fight
during the last few months. About 23% of HP shares are held by ISS
clients, some of whom automatically follow the firm's
recommendations.</TE>
<TE>   Of the HP investors that are ISS clients, Barclays Bank is the
largest, with more than 3% of shares. Barclays had committed to
voting as ISS recommended because its CEO sits on the HP board and
recused herself from voting on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   About 10% of HP shares are estimated to be in the hands of index
funds, which typically follow ISS' lead. The remainder will weigh
Tuesday's report but could come to different conclusions.</TE>
<TE>   Compaq shares fell 7 cents to $10.58 on the New York Stock
Exchange in regular trading, then rose to $11.20 in after-hours
trading after the ISS news. HP shares rose 5 cents to $20.60 in
regular NYSE trading and fell to $20.12 after hours.</TE>
<TE>   In the report, ISS said HP's projected cost savings of $2.5
billion a year were achievable. And it picked the company's
projection of a 4.9% loss in sales over Hewlett's estimate of triple
that amount.</TE>
<TE>   "ISS concludes that management offers a reasonable prediction
about what the future may hold,'' the report said.</TE>
<TE>   ISS said it was satisfied that HP's work had been thorough and
that the company's board had been actively involved in weighing the
Compaq plan and alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   The deciding factor for ISS may have been the amount of effort HP
and Compaq already have invested in planning the implementation of
the merger.</TE>
<TE>   More than a half-million hours have been spent by managers
plotting the integration of products and employee teams, making
HP-Compaq "one of the most exhaustively planned combinations ever,''
ISS said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're pleased that ISS, who is a truly independent expert,
recognizes that this merger serves the best interests of our
shareholders," Fiorina said. "We think this is a significant vote of
confidence."</TE>
<TE>   Hewlett said he disagreed with the ISS decision and observed that
the Maryland firm is better known for its handling of corporate
governance issues.</TE>
<TE>   "ISS clearly has a predisposition to support management and makes
a general presumption that boards do the right thing," Hewlett said.</TE>
<TE>   ISS took both sides to task for some of the high-pitched and
personalized rhetoric of the last few weeks in mailings to
shareholders, news releases and full-page ads.</TE>
<TE>   In one recent spat, Hewlett released board committee meeting
minutes and a letter from HP's counsel to Compaq's, showing that the
companies had contemplated giving Fiorina options valued at more than
$50 million. The agreement wasn't finalized, but ISS agreed with
Hewlett that it should have been disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   HP bears the brunt of the blame for the nastiness, ISS said. And
Hewlett's arguments about the inherent risks of technology mergers
and the difficulty of competing in markets for PCs and low-end
computer servers probably forced HP to do such diligent work on
planning the merger's details.</TE>
<TE>   "Many boardrooms across the country could benefit from the kind of
sincere, courageous independence that Mr. Hewlett has displayed," the
analysts wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Be that as it may, with the contest in a dead heat and only two
weeks to go, few expect the tone of the debate to grow more refined.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd be surprised," said Merrill Lynch analyst Steve Milunovich.
"In political campaigns, the bickering tends to get dirtier the
closer you get to the end."</TE>

<HD>ImClone Announces Revised Erbitux Deal</HD>
<DH>Pharmaceuticals: New terms reduce the upfront cash payment
of Bristol-Myers, its cancer-drug partner.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEENA BEASLEY</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and ImClone Systems Inc. on Tuesday revised
terms of their deal to develop the experimental cancer drug Erbitux,
including a lower upfront payment from Bristol-Myers and a cap on
ImClone's potential share of future profits.</LD>
<LD>   The companies also said they agreed to expand the clinical and
strategic role of Bristol-Myers in the drug's development program, a
significant demand of Bristol-Myers, which had threatened to pull out
of the deal.</LD>
<LD>   The revised terms cut Bristol-Myers' upfront cash payment to
ImClone to $140 million at signing of the revised agreement and $60
million on the one-year anniversary of the signing, compared with the
first deal's call for a $300-million payment when the drug was
accepted for review by the Food and Drug Administration.</LD>
<TE>   Bristol-Myers will pay ImClone the originally agreed $500-million
milestone payment, based on approval of the drug by the FDA, in two
parts: $250 million when the drug is approved to treat one type of
cancer and $250 million when it is approved for a second type.</TE>
<TE>   ImClone's profit share will be capped at a flat rate based on 39%
of product revenue in North America, compared with the original
provision for the rate to increase with certain sales targets. The
agreement will continue to run through 2018.</TE>
<TE>   The companies said Andrew Bodnar, senior vice president of medical
and external affairs at Bristol-Myers, and a member of ImClone's
board, will oversee a joint team implementing a single clinical and
regulatory plan for Erbitux.</TE>
<TE>   Bristol-Myers Chief Executive Peter Dolan threatened earlier this
month to walk away from the development deal.</TE>
<TE>   Dolan made his demands after the FDA in December surprisingly
refused to accept ImClone's marketing application for Erbitux, citing
inadequate data.</TE>
<TE>   Both New York-based firms met last week with FDA officials, who
signaled they might be willing to reconsider the marketing
application if it was accompanied by separate clinical trial data for
Erbitux. The new data would come from Germany's Merck KG, ImClone's
European marketing partner.</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, Bristol-Myers paid $1 billion for a 20% stake in
ImClone and an additional $200 million on signing of the partnership
deal.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's announcement came after markets closed. ImClone fell
$2.15 to $23.82 in regular Nasdaq trading. Bristol-Myers rose 63
cents to $48.43 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Sales of Life Insurance Lethargic Last Year</HD>
<DH>Policies: Despite a slight increase after the events of
Sept. 11, levels are expected to remain below those of late 1990s.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Life insurance sales fell last year despite a small uptick in
consumer interest after the Sept. 11 attacks, according to figures
released Tuesday by LIMRA International, a life insurance research
group.</LD>
<LD>   The number of policies sold dropped 5% compared with 2000, and the
average face amount of policies fell 7% and total premiums paid
declined 3%, said LIMRA analyst Elaine F. Tumicki.</LD>
<LD>   Life insurance sales have declined in recent years as insurance
agents sold fewer small policies and instead focused on selling
larger policies to richer clients, industry analysts said.</LD>
<TE>   That strategy caused problems last year because of a volatile
stock market and estate tax repeal.</TE>
<TE>   Once-popular policies including variable universal life and
variable life, which combine insurance with an investment component,
suffered sharp sales declines.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Tumicki said, sales of survivorship life
policies--typically used to pay estate taxes--fell by more than 25%.</TE>
<TE>   Last year's terrorist attacks did seem to prompt more insurance
sales in the fourth quarter, Tumicki said.</TE>
<TE>   The number of policies sold in October through December rose 5%
from a year earlier, and the increase may continue into the first
quarter this year.</TE>
<TE>   Life insurance applications at U.S. insurers rose 8.5% in January
compared with a year earlier, according to MIB Group Inc., an
insurance information company.</TE>
<TE>   But even with an increase, Tumicki cautioned, sales probably would
remain below the levels of the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Although fourth-quarter sales were higher than a year ago, late
2000 was "particularly weak" for life insurance, Tumicki said.</TE>
<TE>   Last year's fourth-quarter sales were down 8% compared with the
same period in 1999 and down 9% compared with the fourth quarter of
1998.</TE>

<HD>Profit-Taking Caps Strong 2-Day Rally</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: Stocks end mixed after a sell-off in some blue
chips. Nasdaq manages a modest gain. Experts expect market's positive
tone to stay.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wall Street ended mixed Tuesday after the powerful rallies of Friday
and Monday, as some investors took profits.</LD>
<LD>   In other trading, crude oil prices continued to rise amid
expectations that global supplies will stay limited this year.</LD>
<LD>   On Wall Street the Dow Jones industrials fell 153.41 points, or
1.5%, to 10,433.41, giving back less than one-third of the 480-point
surge of the previous two sessions.</LD>
<TE>   The Nasdaq composite index managed a modest gain, inching up 6.97
points, or 0.4%, to 1,866.29. Nasdaq rose 4.1% Friday and 3.1%
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the sell-off in some blue chips, winners had a modest edge
over losers overall on the New York Stock Exchange and on Nasdaq.
Trading was active.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just normal profit-taking after a fairly strong run in
stocks," said Bill Barker, investment consultant at RBC Dain
Rauscher.</TE>
<TE>   The market began to soar on Friday on news that manufacturing
activity in February rebounded at a surprising pace. Buyers continued
to pour into the market on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, a new report showed a strong recovery in the services
segment of the economy last month. Nonetheless, blue-chip shares were
under pressure for most of the day, though Nasdaq rallied as much as
27 points early in the session.</TE>
<TE>   Still, "The mood in the market is substantially better than it was
just two weeks ago, when there was a lot of gloom around," Barker
said. "People are getting their hopes back up again."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts noted that the tech-dominated Nasdaq index had lagged the
advance of other market sectors in recent weeks, so tech is playing
catch-up.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow index is up 4.1% year to date. Nasdaq is down 4.3%.</TE>
<TE>   Growing belief that the recession has ended is expected to keep a
positive tone in the market in the near term, many experts say.
Meanwhile, the Enron Corp. debacle is fading a bit in the headlines,
reducing some of the concern about corporate accounting in general.</TE>
<TE>   But the rally in stocks in recent sessions already is raising
questions about stocks' valuations relative to expected earnings per
share this year. Many money managers view the market as fairly valued
or overvalued, but not cheap, historically speaking.</TE>
<TE>   The market showed no apparent reaction Tuesday to President Bush's
decision to impose tariffs on imported steel. Major steel stocks
generally closed lower, as some investors apparently were hoping for
higher tariffs than Bush ordered.</TE>
<TE>   In the bond market, longer-term Treasury yields were mostly
unchanged. They have been creeping higher since last week, amid
stronger economic data.</TE>
<TE>   In commodities trading, crude oil futures rose more than 3% after
OPEC Secretary-General Ali Rodriguez said he was convinced that
Russia will keep its export limits in place through June.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez said the Russian government and oil company officials he
met with in Moscow will decide on their policy by the end of March,
Bloomberg News reported.</TE>
<TE>   Russia was among the exporters that helped the Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Countries reduce supply and boost prices this
year. OPEC kept cutting output last month, a Bloomberg survey showed,
and most exporters say they will keep limits on supply at least
through June.</TE>
<TE>   "Russia has been the big worry," said Chester Irvin, a crude oil
broker at ABN Amro in New York. "The Mexican oil minister is going to
Norway and Russia this week to discuss coordinating their policy,
which adds momentum to the rally."</TE>
<TE>   Near-term oil futures in New York rose 72 cents to $23.17 a
barrel, the highest since Oct. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Among Tuesday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Retail stocks pulled back. Many have rallied strongly in recent
months as consumer spending has remained robust. Wal-Mart fell $2.22
to $60.76, Target slid $1.90 to $41.50 and Home Depot lost $2.40 to
$47.50.</TE>
<TE>   * Drug stocks also were weak. Abbott Labs fell $2.35 to $55.02 and
Merck was off $1.20 to $61.81.</TE>
<TE>   * Some heavy-industry and transportation shares fell after soaring
in the previous two sessions. General Motors eased 9 cents to $58.61,
Delta Air Lines sank $2.94 to $35.65 and Caterpillar fell $1.08 to
$58.</TE>
<TE>   Among tech leaders, many semiconductor stocks continued to
advance. Broadcom gained $2.50 to $40.50 and PMC-Sierra rose $1.26 to
$18.72.</TE>

<HD>Firm Acquires Doctors' Contracts</HD>
<DH>Health care: Under the deal, NAMM will manage seven
physician groups in Southern California.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Ontario-based medical company has acquired the management
contracts of seven independent doctor groups in Los Angeles and
Orange counties, making it one of the largest managers of physician
groups in California.</LD>
<LD>   The deal announced Tuesday will give North American Medical
Management ownership or management responsibilities over doctor
groups serving 517,000 patients in California. The company already
owns nine independent medical practice associations, mostly in San
Bernardino and Riverside counties.</LD>
<LD>   Medical group management companies such as NAMM are an
increasingly important element of the nation's restructuring
health-care system. They handle administrative responsibilities of
physicians' groups, including patient claims and purchasing of
supplies, allowing doctors to focus on the practice of medicine.</LD>
<TE>   They also represent doctor groups in contract negotiations with
managed-care companies in return for a fee or a percentage of the
doctors' income.</TE>
<TE>   Many of these medical groups failed when they were unable to
master the management duties on their own and because of low fixed
payments from HMOs and other managed-care companies.</TE>
<TE>   Some industry officials said NAMM may face similar challenges in
California, where reimbursement rates for medical care are among the
nation's lowest.</TE>
<TE>   NAMM also may have trouble overcoming negative perceptions of its
parent company, PhyCor Inc., a Nashville-based company that at one
time was the nation's second-biggest manager of doctors' practices.
PhyCor filed for bankruptcy protection in January.</TE>
<TE>   NAMM's prospects in California "are worse than they would be in
other states and overall medical practice expenses rose faster than
inflation and the economy at large last year," said Dr. William
Jessee, president and chief executive of Colorado-based Medical Group
Management Assn., a trade group.</TE>
<TE>   Jessee added that medical practice revenues are down and that many
in California "are already operating on a razor-thin margin. It will
be tough to find success in California."</TE>
<TE>   NAMM Chief Executive Rene Moret, however, said the acquisition is
"a good move for us" that will help give the company greater clout in
negotiations with health plans over payment rates.</TE>
<TE>   "It put us into L.A. and Orange counties. It was a growth
opportunity," Moret said.</TE>
<TE>   Under the deal, NAMM acquired certain California-based assets and
management contracts of Medical Pathways Inc., a Cerritos-based
health-care management company. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.</TE>

<HD>Microsoft Dispute Enters Final Phase</HD>
<DH>Antitrust: Judge seeks sanctions that would prevent the
software giant from abusing its monopoly power.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>After nearly four years of litigation and legal brinkmanship that
reverberated from Silicon Valley to the European Union, the landmark
antitrust case against Microsoft Corp. is entering its closing phase
today.</LD>
<LD>   The antitrust dispute between the world's largest software company
and the federal government, 18 states and the District of Columbia
has been a seesaw battle that has defied resolution--even after a
federal court declared Microsoft an illegal monopoly in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   But today, U.S. District Court Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly begins
an unusual set of parallel proceedings to finally determine how to
punish Microsoft. Her goal is to find sanctions that prevent the
software giant from abusing its monopoly power by leveraging its
flagship Windows software--which runs more than 90% of all personal
computers.</LD>
<TE>   Experts say resolution of the biggest antitrust case since the
breakup of Standard Oil a century ago could establish important legal
precedents and influence the development of Information Age
technology.</TE>
<TE>   "The Windows platform is not only a platform for how we work our
computers but, increasingly, for how we communicate with each other,"
said Blair Levin, a former chief of staff of the Federal
Communications Commission and now a technology analyst for Legg Mason
Wood Walker Inc.</TE>
<TE>   The quest for closure starts with a hearing today to examine a
settlement reached in November between the Justice Department, half
the states and the Redmond, Wash.-based software giant.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Kollar-Kotelly is scheduled to begin a separate
proceeding with nine dissenting states, including California, and the
District of Columbia that say the settlement is full of loopholes.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Microsoft asked for a delay in those proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   How Kollar-Kotelly will take these two conflicting paths to reach
a resolution has legal scholars scratching their heads. Besides the
two proceedings, the judge also must consider about 30,000 public
comments on the settlement accord.</TE>
<TE>   "We are talking uncharted territory here," said Ernest Gelhorn, an
antitrust professor at George Mason Law School in Fairfax, Va. "This
case is going to be a challenge to resolve."</TE>
<TE>   The antitrust case dates back to 1998, when the Justice Department
and state regulators filed their suit against Microsoft.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson presided over the case
and, after nearly two years of trial, issued findings that Microsoft
was in violation of antitrust laws.</TE>
<TE>   In the penalty phase of the trial, Jackson ordered the company
broken into two.</TE>
<TE>   After a year of more legal maneuvering, the U.S. Court of Appeals
in Washington threw out Jackson's breakup ruling and ordered a new
penalty phase.</TE>
<TE>   It also disqualified Jackson from presiding over the proceedings
because of "repeated, egregious and flagrant" violations of judicial
ethics. Judge Kollar-Kotelly was named in August to replace Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   In November, the Justice Department and nine states agreed to
settle the antitrust case. But nine other states and the District of
Columbia refused to join the accord, arguing for tougher antitrust
penalties.</TE>
<TE>   Now, it is up to Kollar-Kotelly to resolve the conflict. In court
today, lawyers for Microsoft and the Justice Department's antitrust
chief, Charles A. James, will urge Kollar-Kotelly to endorse their
settlement as the best way to ensure competition and innovation in
the software industry.</TE>
<TE>   Under the federal Tunney Act, the judge must find the accord is in
the "public interest."</TE>
<TE>   The settlement calls for Microsoft to disclose the technical
details of the Windows computer code that enables the PC operating
system to work with products from rival software developers.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Microsoft no longer will be able to bar computer
makers from installing or displaying certain non-Microsoft
software--such as Web browsers and a few other programs--on the
Windows desktop computer screen or start menu.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft also must license its software on uniform terms and is
barred from retaliating against any rival for "developing,
distributing, promoting, using, selling or licensing" certain
software that competes with Windows.</TE>
<TE>   The Tunney Act hearing on the settlement accord is expected to be
wrapped up in a matter of days.</TE>
<TE>   But Kollar-Kotelly has penciled in more than five weeks of
hearings on the additional antitrust sanctions the nine dissenting
states are seeking.</TE>
<TE>   With a reputation as a careful jurist, Kollar-Kotelly is likely to
reserve final judgment in the Microsoft antitrust case until late
spring or early summer, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   The dissenting states say the Justice Department settlement
doesn't go far enough in reigning in Microsoft's monopoly power.</TE>
<TE>   They want the company to produce a modular version of Windows that
would allow PC makers and consumers to substitute rival software
products for Microsoft programs without impairing the Windows
computer operating system.</TE>
<TE>   "The revisions don't change the fundamental nature of the
settlement--nor the fundamental flaws so many have found in it," Iowa
Atty. Gen. Tom Miller, one of the leaders of the dissenting states,
said after the modifications were announced.</TE>
<TE>   To press their case in the trial with the dissenting states,
Microsoft has hired former Iran-Contra prosecutor Dan K. Webb.</TE>
<TE>   The high stakes of the proceeding with the dissenting states also
are reflected in the breadth and high profiles of scheduled
witnesses. The witnesses range from academicians to telephone and
computer executives and also may include Microsoft Chairman Bill
Gates.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to the first antitrust trial, during which he did not
take the stand, Gates recently has indicated his eagerness to
testify.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft executives have acknowledged their need to change their
business practices. But they staunchly defend their ability to add
new features to Windows as crucial to the vitality of the personal
computer industry.</TE>
<TE>   "The proposal put forward by the non-settling states would not be
a decree that I would know how to comply with," Microsoft Chief
Executive Steven A. Ballmer said in a deposition last month. "I
actually think we would need to withdraw the Windows product from the
marketplace."</TE>

<HD>PG&amp;E Reports 4th-Quarter Profit on Drop in Prices</HD>
<DH>Energy: The delayed earnings show net income of $529
million. The firm's utility also was able to cover costs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NIGEL HUNT</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>PG&amp;E Corp., parent of bankrupt utility Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co., on
Tuesday reported a fourth-quarter profit compared with a massive
year-ago loss in a turnaround driven by a sharp drop in power prices.</LD>
<LD>   The company reported fourth-quarter net income of $529 million, or
$1.45 a share, reversing a net loss of $4.12 billion, or $11.34 a
share, in the year-ago quarter.</LD>
<LD>   Wholesale electricity prices skyrocketed in 2000, forcing the San
Francisco-based company to take a charge of $4.11 billion, or $11.32
a share, in the fourth quarter of 2000 for money spent on buying
power at higher prices. California's deregulation laws had prevented
the company from passing the higher prices on to retail customers.</LD>
<TE>   A year later, the drop in wholesale prices linked partly to an
economic recession meant the company's utility unit not only managed
to cover its costs but also recovered some of the money spent the
previous year.</TE>
<TE>   The company's fourth-quarter earnings of $1.45 a share included 92
cents related to the collection of previously written-off costs as
well as several other one-time items including a 10-cent loss for the
termination of certain contracts with bankrupt industry giant Enron
Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding one-time items the company reported a fourth-quarter
profit of 95 cents a share versus earnings of 38 cents in the
year-ago quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The company, which last month delayed its fourth-quarter earnings
report after discovering accounting problems related to the treatment
of leases, posted operating revenue of $4.98 billion, down 38% from
$8.08 billion in last year's fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E shares gained 43 cents to close at $22.97 on Tuesday on the
New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   The stock rose 26.6% during the fourth quarter as lower wholesale
power prices sharply reduced the utility's costs.</TE>
<TE>   Looking ahead, PG&amp;E forecast 2002 earnings from operations in the
range of $3.00 a share, little changed from $3.02 a share for 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The 2002 projection included an expectation for lower earnings
from PG&amp;E National Energy Group, the unit's chief executive, Tom
Boren, told an analysts conference call.</TE>
<TE>   The unit builds and operates power plants and natural gas
pipelines as well as trading in energy.</TE>
<TE>   Boren said PG&amp;E's financial problems, which included a bankruptcy
filing by the utility unit in April 2001, prevented PG&amp;E NEG from
signing as many forward power deals as it would have liked when
prices were high early last year.</TE>

<HD>Improving Economy Increases Specter of Rising Interest
Rates</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The recent spate of positive economic news is making it more likely
that long-term interest rates will creep up this year--and that bond
investors will have a tough time matching the stellar returns they
enjoyed the last two years.</LD>
<LD>   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which dipped to
4.83% last week, had risen to 5% by Tuesday--about the middle of the
fairly narrow range in which it has traded since early December.</LD>
<LD>   Mortgage rates have edged up as well, although at an average of
just less than 7% they still are below where they started the year.</LD>
<TE>   The important question for investors who stormed into bond mutual
funds over the last two years, as well as for home buyers, is whether
a "spring surprise" of sharply higher rates could be in store.</TE>
<TE>   That would make homes less affordable and hammer bond investors,
who see the value of their investments decline when interest rates
rise.</TE>
<TE>   So far, most experts are betting against that scenario, saying
that with consumers maxed out and business capital-spending budgets
still depressed, the economic expansion will be slow and inflation
tame.</TE>
<TE>   "The recovery is real, but it's a feeble one," said Bill Gross,
chief strategist for Pimco, a fixed-income manager in Newport Beach,
whose bond fund assets have swollen from $185 billion at the end of
1999 to $251 billion currently.</TE>
<TE>   Gross is betting that quiescent inflation will keep the Fed from
raising short-term rates for the next six to 12 months. That should
mean modest profits for bond investors--although probably nothing
like the recent run that saw them handily beat stock investors two
years in a row.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, the average government bond mutual fund had a total
return--interest plus price appreciation--of 10.4%, contrasted with a
9.1% loss for the benchmark Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock index. Last
year, the average government bond fund returned 6.7%, contrasted with
an 11.8% loss for the S&amp;P 500.</TE>
<TE>   Returns like that on bonds "are generally not what to expect" this
year, said Mario DeRose, a fixed-income strategist at Edward Jones
brokerage in St. Louis. Although the market isn't likely to
experience a bust like the one that occurred when rates soared in
1994, the recent boom clearly is over, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll eventually see losses in bond portfolios--maybe not this
year, but it will happen. Investors should be wary and diversify,"
DeRose said. He said he's already seeing signs that investors are
selling shorter-term Treasuries and investing the proceeds in the
rebounding stock market.</TE>
<TE>   In the inverted logic of fixed-income securities, economic
strengthening can be bad news for bonds because it can spark
inflation and sway the Fed to raise short-term interest rates.</TE>
<TE>   And the economic news in recent weeks has been surprisingly good.
Investors were especially encouraged last week when the Institute for
Supply Management reported increased manufacturing in February--the
first rise in 19 months. The institute said Tuesday that activity in
the service sector, which accounts for four-fifths of the U.S.
economy, surged to its highest level since November 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill said Tuesday that "our
economy maybe never suffered a recession." The National Bureau of
Economic Research--generally accepted as the arbiter in such
matters--had decreed that the economy's record 10-year expansion
ended last March.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the positive news, most bond watchers for now agree with
Gross that this expansion will be slow at least until late in the
year. If that's the case, a 10-year Treasury note yield of about 5%
and 30-year fixed-mortgage rates in the 7% range make sense, said
Keith Gumbinger, a vice president at HSH Associates in Butler, N.J.,
a data firm that surveys lenders.</TE>
<TE>   Rates could quickly shoot higher if Friday's unemployment report
proves more robust than expected. But Gumbinger said most in the
mortgage business expect a slowly accelerating economy to push rates
up by just a quarter-percentage-point or so this spring.</TE>
<TE>   A Freddie Mac rate survey put the national average at 6.8% for a
30-year fixed-rate mortgage as of Friday. Gumbinger's survey showed
an average of 6.91% for conventional fixed 30-year home loans.</TE>
<TE>   The low rates and rising home prices across most of the nation
have been a major reason that--despite record consumer debt loads and
bankruptcies--consumer spending has held up well through stock market
declines and economic adversity.</TE>
<TE>   As mortgage rates fell to the 6.6% range at year-end, "consumers
were able to extract huge savings," said Tom Atteberry, a Los
Angeles-based bond analyst and co-manager of FPA New Income Fund.</TE>
<TE>   "You could significantly lower your mortgage payment or pull money
out of your home equity and use it to pay off higher-interest
debts--or spend it," Atteberry said. "Consumer balance sheets were
improved."</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, as Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress
last week, consumers' unabated spending makes it unreasonable to
expect them to lead the economic recovery. Greenspan said business
must lead the way.</TE>
<TE>   Although lower interest rates allowed many businesses to
strengthen their balance sheets by issuing long-term bonds cheaply
last year, companies also retrenched by drastically drawing down
their inventories, as the less-than-full shelves at many retailers at
Christmas demonstrated.</TE>
<TE>   Atteberry thinks the recent uptick in business activity reflects
rebuilding of those inventories. Without a pickup in consumer
spending, however, that buildup could drop off sharply this year,
leaving the economy growing sluggishly into 2003, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Atteberry worries that investors could get squeezed if bond
yields jump unexpectedly.</TE>
<TE>   His recommendation: Buy mortgage-backed securities, which
generally pay higher yields than Treasuries with almost as much
safety, and high-yield corporate bonds, which should benefit as the
economy improves and are currently are paying about 6 to 8 percentage
points more than Treasury securities.</TE>
<TE>   Gross also expects companies to expand slowly, noting that there's
little sign that businesses are preparing to make the major
investments in new markets, acquisitions and equipment that would
signal an impending boom.</TE>
<TE>   "During a reality check, you will see that we have [business
capital spending] that's still anemic, a consumer that is basically
tapped out in terms of savings and an unemployment rate that
continues to climb," Gross said. "That doesn't leave a lot of room
for growth."</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Staples Inc. and OfficeMax Inc. raised earnings forecasts for this
year while the office supply retailers reduce costs and increase
sales to small-business customers as the U.S. economy rebounds.</LD>
<LD>   Staples said profit will increase to 76 cents to 80 cents a share
from 40 cents in the year ended Feb. 2. OfficeMax will be profitable
after reporting eight quarterly losses. Analysts had forecast
earnings of 76 cents for Staples and a loss of 27 cents for
OfficeMax, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.</LD>
<LD>   The companies said they are selling fewer computers to make room
for products that have wider profit margins. Both companies' shares
have plunged from record highs during the last three years amid a
glut in office supplies and a slowing economy.</LD>
<TE>   The companies also reported fiscal fourth-quarter results. Staples
had net income of $93.8 million, or 20 cents a share, contrasted with
a year-ago loss of $111.7 million, or 23 cents. OfficeMax's loss in
the quarter ended Jan. 26 widened to $229.5 million, or $1.95 a
share, from $85 million, or 76 cents, a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Sales fell 6% to $2.93 billion, with sales at stores open at least
a year falling 4%, Staples said.</TE>
<TE>   Office Max said fourth-quarter sales fell 10% to $1.27 billion.
Sales at stores open at least a year dropped 3%.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Framingham, Mass.-based Staples fell 32 cents to $19.68
on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   OfficeMax, based in Shaker Heights, Ohio, rose 64 cents to $5.06
on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Enron Corp. will pay $5 million in additional severance to employees
fired after the former top energy trader filed for bankruptcy
protection in December.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez approved the payments.
The money will be equally divided among about 4,500 former employees
who worked at Enron's Houston headquarters. Each will receive about
$1,100 before taxes.</LD>
<LD>   Fired employees previously received a one-time payment of $4,500
before taxes.</LD>
<TE>   Enron interim Chief Executive Stephen F. Cooper approached the
company's creditors about the additional severance payments after
addressing 250 former employees at a town hall meeting last week at
the request of Rep. Sheila Jackson-Lee (D-Texas).</TE>

<LD>Costco Wholesale Corp.'s fiscal second-quarter earnings rose 9% as
the biggest U.S. chain of warehouse clubs opened more stores and
boosted sales of items such as electronics.</LD>
<LD>   Net income rose to $192.6 million, or 41 cents a share, from
$176.6 million, or 38 cents, in the year-earlier period, the company
said. Sales, including membership fees, climbed 13% to $9.38 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Costco and discount chains such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. have
benefited from consumers who want to stretch their budgets in a
recession, analysts said. Sales were helped by the 21 stores Costco
opened since the fiscal year began in September, Chief Financial
Officer Richard Galanti said.</LD>

<LD>Japanese firms pared spending on factories and equipment for the
first time in two years in the fourth quarter in a bid to cut costs
as profits fell by almost one-third.</LD>
<LD>   The 14.5% drop in capital spending in the fourth quarter from a
year ago suggests that the world's second-biggest economy may have
shrunk more than forecast, economists said. In a sign that companies
have been slow to trim costs and might have to make further cuts,
profits fell 31.4% on a 3.8% slide in sales, Ministry of Finance
figures showed.</LD>

<HD>Judge OKs Settlement for Sears Retirees</HD>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A judge has approved a settlement granting about $28 million in life
insurance benefits to 56,000 Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. retirees whose
benefits were cut in 1997.</LD>
<LD>   The money is to be split among the retirees based on the previous
value of their company life insurance plans.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge James Moran in Chicago approved the
settlement.</LD>
<TE>   Peter Wasylyk, a Providence, R.I., attorney representing the
retirees, said Sears did not restore all the benefits the plaintiffs
were requesting, but he called the settlement fair nevertheless. He
could not immediately say what the total would have been if all
employees had received their entire benefits.</TE>
<TE>   The Hoffman Estates, Ill.-based company quit granting life
insurance as a retirement benefit in 1997 and announced it would
reduce the plans for retired employees to $5,000 over 10 years. That
meant the loss of only a few thousand dollars in benefits to some
employees, but Wasylyk said others had policies worth up to $100,000.</TE>
<TE>   Sears spokeswoman Peggy Palter said the company was pleased with
the settlement.</TE>

<LD>Dillard's Inc.'s fiscal fourth-quarter profit rose 55% as the
department store chain trimmed expenses, cut prices and sold more
profitable private-label goods such as women's shoes.</LD>
<LD>   The company also adopted a "poison-pill" plan to prevent a hostile
takeover. The move was not in response to an acquisition attempt,
Dillard's said. The death last month of founder and Chairman William
T. Dillard raised speculation the firm may be bought, analysts and
investors have said.</LD>
<LD>   Net income beat analysts' estimates, rising to $102 million, or
$1.21 a share, from $66 million, or 78 cents, a year earlier,
Dillard's said. Sales in the period ended Feb.2 fell 4.8% to $2.53
billion.</LD>

<LD>Formica Corp., whose countertops decorated U.S. homes for much of the
20th century, filed for bankruptcy protection as top shareholder
Credit Suisse First Boston offered $51 million to help restructure
$533 million of debt.</LD>
<LD>   CSFB's private equity business, a Formica investor since 1998,
leads a group offering Formica's bank lenders $100 million to pay
down secured debt.</LD>
<LD>   Chief Executive Frank A. Riddick III said he met with more than
600 employees at the company's Evendale, Ohio, plant to assure them
that Formica will operate without interruption as it negotiates with
its creditors.</LD>
<TE>   The company's debt is almost equal to its $576.9 million in
revenue over the first nine months of 2001, when the company had
losses of $34.4 million, according to the Chapter 11 filing in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Credit Suisse's plan has no provision for payments to shareholders
and note holders, the Warren, N.J., company said.</TE>

<LD>Kohl's Corp.'s fiscal fourth-quarter profit rose 31% as the retailer
opened new stores and added children's clothing from OshKosh B'Gosh
Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Net income rose to $233.8 million, or 68 cents a share, compared
with the same period a year ago. Sales in the quarter ended Feb. 2
climbed 23% to $2.72 billion, the company said.</LD>
<LD>   Kohl's added 62 stores last year and plans to open 70 stores in
the coming year as it expands into the U.S. Northeast and Midwest.
The retailer's low prices and national brands such as OshKosh B'Gosh,
which it introduced in the fourth quarter, pulled customers away from
department stores, investors said.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Menomonee Falls, Wis.-based Kohl's fell $3.28, or 4.7%,
to $66.16 on the NYSE. Results were released after the close of

<LD>Southern California Edison Co., California's second-largest utility,
had its corporate credit rating raised 10 notches to "BB" by Standard
&amp; Poor's after developing a recovery plan to pay off past defaults.</LD>
<LD>   The utility, a unit of Edison International, on Friday used cash
on hand and $1.8 billion of borrowing to erase $5.5 billion in debts
it ran up during the state's energy crisis in 2001. The rating fell
to "D" last year, the lowest level by Standard &amp; Poor's, after the
utility missed payments on $930 million of notes and commercial
paper. The new rating is two notches below investment-grade.</LD>

<HD>Toyota Settles State Suit Over Smog Equipment</HD>
<DH>Courts: The car maker will pay $7.9 million toward
California clean-air programs, ending a possible recall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY POLAKOVIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Toyota Motor Corp. has agreed to pay $7.9 million to settle a lawsuit
with California over smog- control equipment on thousands of cars
plying state highways.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement announced Tuesday reverses an earlier order by the
California Air Resources Board for a massive recall of cars in
California but leaves pending a similar lawsuit brought by U.S.
regulators who alleged 2.2 million cars nationwide may be polluting
the air without the auto owners' knowledge.</LD>
<LD>   Under the terms of the settlement, the Japanese auto maker
acknowledges no wrongdoing but agrees to pay millions to state
clean-air programs and hasten the introduction of low-polluting,
advanced-technology cars. The agreement settles a 4-year-old recall
order and subsequent lawsuit.</LD>
<TE>   "There was never any extra emissions or pollution here. No defect
was ever established nor were any vehicles recalled and none will be
recalled, so customers need have no concerns about their cars," said
Mike Michels, spokesman for Toyota Motor Sales USA. "This was about a
technicality of the computer program and how it diagnosed itself."</TE>
<TE>   At the heart of the dispute, state regulators charged that
computer systems on board 330,000 Toyota cars from model years
1996-98 lacked the ability to check for vapor leaks in hoses, gas
caps and engine components.</TE>
<TE>   So-called evaporative emissions are not insignificant; they can
account for up to 25% of a car's emissions, according to the ARB.</TE>
<TE>   But the auto maker contended that the smog-control systems
complied with state requirements, and the two parties agreed to
submit the case to an administrative law judge.</TE>
<TE>   The judge concluded that ARB testing did not conclusively
demonstrate Toyota vehicles were out of compliance with California
regulations, but the judge agreed that Toyota failed to fully
disclose required sufficient information to alert the ARB to the
problem before Toyota received approval.</TE>
<TE>   Under terms of the settlement, Toyota agreed to fund a package
valued at $7.9 million.</TE>
<TE>   A $1.2-million contribution will go to the California Air
Pollution Control Fund. The state uses this fund to educate the
public and provide programs to minimize the output of smog-forming
emissions from various sources.</TE>
<TE>   And $4.3 million will go toward supplemental environmental
projects, to be agreed upon jointly between ARB and Toyota.</TE>
<TE>   Those funds could be used for projects including the purchase of
low-polluting lawn mowers, research into clean technologies and
pollution cleanups in low-income neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   "We are pleased that we have reached an agreement in this case. We
believe that this settlement will not only benefit the owners of the
vehicles but all Californians," said ARB Executive Officer Michael
Kenny.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Toyota will extend warranties for defects that may occur in
the evaporative emission control system of the Toyota model year cars
in question from three years to 14 years or 150,000 miles.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota agreed to accelerate development and introduction of
near-zero-emission cars, from the gasoline-electric hybrid Prius to
cars that produce virtually no air pollutants. The extended warranty
and the early compliance efforts are valued at $2.4 million.</TE>

<HD>Acquisition Spree Leads to Big Loss for Vivendi</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>copy editor/bayer ext.70798</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vivendi Universal on Tuesday reported an $11.8-billion loss for 2001,
the largest in French corporate history, as it wrote down the costs
of a string of acquisitions that built it into the world's
second-largest media company.</LD>
<LD>   The loss contrasts with a net profit of $2 billion in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   In the last 18 months, Vivendi Chief Executive Jean-Marie Messier
has turned a sewage disposal and water company into a rival of AOL
Time Warner Inc. by acquiring Universal and European cable TV giant
Canal Plus. Vivendi is close to buying the TV and film assets of USA
Networks Inc.</LD>
<TE>   But as the 149-year-old Vivendi shifts to U.S. accounting rules
this quarter to build its profile here, the company has faced growing
scrutiny by analysts and investors who have grown impatient with its
complex balance sheet and the French accounting methods it uses. Wall
Street analysts also have started to complain that Vivendi needs to
show how the various pieces of its expanding empire will fit
together.</TE>
<TE>   American accounting rules now require companies to immediately
write off "goodwill"--the difference between the price paid for an
asset and its book value--if it is clear that the asset's value has
declined significantly.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi said it wrote off $13 billion in goodwill last year,
reflecting lowered values for various acquisitions. Vivendi "is
cleaning up their house after having overpaid when valuations were
sky-high," said Valerie Cazaban-Levy, an investment manager at
Stratege Finance.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi shares closed down 44 cents Tuesday to $41.25 on the New
York Stock Exchange. The stock has fallen 23% this year.</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference Tuesday in Paris, Messier downplayed the
significance of the write-down, calling it a "bookkeeping concept."
The company's books are "totally transparent," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Messier added that it is "unacceptable that hedge funds should
really make a bundle off our shareholders just by circulating
[rumors] in the marketplace....To avoid that, we're going to full
disclosure."</TE>
<TE>   "Messier is making a better effort in terms of addressing
investors' concerns, but the company's debt level is still a concern
... [and] it limits their strategic options," J.P. Morgan analyst
Mark Harrington said.</TE>
<TE>   Messier said in an interview that he planned no additional
acquisitions this year and that he would reduce the company's  debt,
about $16 billion for media and communications, to maintain its
credit ratings.</TE>
<TE>   The 2001 write-off skewed an otherwise strong year driven by gains
in telecom and film, Messier said. Vivendi's earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in its media and
communications businesses rose 34% last year to $4.4 billion.
Universal Studios was helped by such box-office hits as "Bridget
Jones's Diary" and strong video and DVD sales for "The Grinch" and
"The Mummy Returns."</TE>
<TE>   Declines in attendance at the company's theme parks in Universal
City and Orlando, Fla., after Sept. 11 were offset by a strong debut
for its park in Osaka, Japan. And best-selling albums from artists
such as Shaggy and Limp Bizkit helped Universal Music Group gain
market share in a down market, Messier said.</TE>
<TE>   He predicted that the company would boost operating cash flow to
$5.2 billion and achieve 10% revenue growth in 2002, citing gains in
music, publishing and theme parks, which have seen a slight increase
in attendance this year.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it will be difficult for Vivendi to meet such ambitious
sales and [earnings] targets, particularly considering the weakness
in music, pay television, theme parks and the retail business,"
Harrington said.</TE>
<TE>   Since moving to New York last September, Messier has been working
to win over U.S. investors to his ambitious strategy of building a
global media giant. He also has bought American book publisher
Houghton Mifflin, online music company MP3.com and announced plans
for an 11% stake in satellite TV provider EchoStar Communications
Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Messier's strategic plays in the U.S. have failed to win
converts on Wall Street. In January the company's plan to raise $3
billion from a stock placement stumbled as underwriters were unable
to find institutional buyers for all 55 million shares.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi's woes have been compounded by a series of complex
transactions that have made the company's balance sheet even harder
to understand. Under French accounting rules, companies can reduce
their debt with various credits, including treasury shares, vendor
financing and short-term loans. Such offsets are not allowed under
generally accepted U.S. accounting rules.</TE>
<TE>   The different accounting rules have yielded substantial balance
sheet adjustments, said Michael Nathanson, an analyst with Bernstein
Research. For example, Vivendi reported a total net debt of 23.5
billion euros as of June 2001, when the debt figure by U.S. standards
would have been closer to 33 billion euros, Nathanson said.</TE>
<TE>   Times wire services were used in compiling this report.</TE>

<HD>SEC Seeks Greater Resources for Enforcement Cases</HD>
<DH>Regulation: Backed by a study, the agency will ask Congress
for a bigger 2003 budget to handle post-Enron demand.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Securities and Exchange Commission, demoralized by budget
constraints imposed by Congress and the Bush and Clinton
administrations, says it will be unable to handle a record number of
enforcement cases spawned by the collapse of Enron Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Armed with a new General Accounting Office study that backs the
SEC's need for more resources, agency officials are taking their case
to Congress this week.</LD>
<LD>   "We're stretched to the limit," SEC Enforcement Director Stephen
Cutler said. "There are some lower-priority cases we just have to
devote less time to than we'd like."</LD>
<TE>   The SEC brought 112 enforcement actions in 2001, up 42% from 1998.
During the same period, departures reduced the agency's staff by
about 5%.</TE>
<TE>   Chairman Harvey Pitt said in January the SEC couldn't afford to
replace the 140 people who left last year.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, demands by lawmakers for more scrutiny of accounting
practices since Enron collapsed prompted the SEC to double the number
of new investigations into financial reporting this year.</TE>
<TE>   Though some lawmakers accuse the SEC of overstating its need for
resources, the new GAO report provides the agency with more firepower
for its battle.</TE>
<TE>   The GAO, Congress' investigative arm, said Tuesday that the
decline in staffing, combined with an increase in new probes of
companies such as Global Crossing Ltd. and Computer Associates
International Inc., are creating substantial delays and may force the
SEC to forgo some investigations.</TE>
<TE>   "They're going to have to quietly drop a number of cases unless
they get additional resources," said William McLucas, who led SEC
enforcement from 1989 to 1998 and is now a partner at the law firm
Wilmer, Cutler &amp; Pickering.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt, the agency's head since August, is slated Thursday to
present a budget proposal to Congress. President Bush's budget plan
for the next fiscal year contains no money for additional staff jobs
at the SEC. Filling the current vacancies would cost $11 million,
according to SEC data.</TE>
<TE>   "Our enforcement division is working at a pace that is
exponentially above what it has been in previous years," Pitt said at
an SEC conference in New York on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The surge in new cases is being fueled in part by demands from
investors that the SEC reexamine accounting practices and standards
since the collapse of Enron. Since then, the SEC has initiated
investigations into Hanover Compressor Co. and Enterasys Networks
Inc., among others.</TE>
<TE>   Some Republicans and Democrats in Congress have called for
allocating more money so the SEC can beef up enforcement and raise
pay. One House bill would boost the agency's budget nearly 50%.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Bush's budget request for fiscal 2003, starting in
October, would give the SEC $467million, a 6.6% increase over this
year's budget. Most of the increase is for keeping up with inflation,
computer improvements and security, not for adding staff or boosting
pay, officials have said.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. John J. LaFalce, a New York Democrat, said Bush's failure to
add money to raise SEC staff pay to parity levels with other federal
regulatory agencies means that "with respect to the war to defend
American investors he hasn't even come to the plate."</TE>
<TE>   Pitt, who came into office seeking to be more attentive to
companies' needs and issues with the SEC, now is emphasizing the need
to hold corporate wrongdoers accountable. Pitt said the agency will
take the lead in restoring investors' confidence in the financial
system.</TE>
<TE>   "My first priority is to see if we can't persuade the
administration to fund pay parity," he said Monday. "My second
priority is to finish my assessment of what our personnel needs are
and attempt to make a presentation for additional resources."</TE>
<TE>   Pitt reviewed the budgets for fiscal 2001 and 2002 and decided
around Jan. 1 that the SEC didn't have enough money to fill 140
vacancies authorized by federal law, a spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   SEC department heads were told in January they wouldn't be able to
fill the empty job slots, further stretching resources that had
failed to keep pace with explosive growth in agency cases in the last
decade.</TE>
<TE>   From 1991 to 2000, the number of open cases increased 65% while
enforcement staff rose 16%, according to the GAO.</TE>
<TE>   The 2-1 vote by the agency's non-management lawyers, accountants
and support workers to be represented by the National Treasury
Employees Union in July 2000 "was a big signal" of an unhappy staff,
said David M. Walker, comptroller general of the GAO.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the first professional services organization that I'm
familiar with that unionized," he said.</TE>
<TE>   After surveying SEC employees, the GAO concluded that pay was the
first reason cited for quitting and a lack of opportunities for
advancement was the second.</TE>

<HD>Lessons in Leading a School District</HD>
<DH>The Eli Broad academy recruits business or education
executives for free training to lead big urban districts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOE MATHEWS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Let's continue our journey to self-understanding," says Tim Quinn,
looking out over a downstairs ballroom at the Ritz Carlton Hotel in
Marina del Rey. "What are the five characteristics of peak performing
leaders?"</LD>
<LD>   Twenty-five men and women, all hotel guests for a four-day
weekend, answer back. They discuss the words of Mohandas Gandhi and
Lao Tzu. Quinn quotes Robert Frost, Rudyard Kipling and the movie
"Pay It Forward." Before declaring a five-minute break, Quinn urges
his students to be "dedicated masters of self" and says: "Seize the
day. Carpe diem."</LD>
<LD>   The class has the feel of an encounter session and the content of
a New Age management seminar. It is neither.</LD>
<TE>   This is the first meeting of a much-ballyhooed new academy to
train urban school superintendents.</TE>
<TE>   The 25 students, selected from more than 200 applicants, all want
to head urban school districts. And Quinn, the group's leader, works
for the foundation of Eli Broad, the academy's sponsor.</TE>
<TE>   Billed as a first of its kind, the Broad Urban Superintendents
Academy is an effort to apply the norms of corporate life to the
management of public schools.</TE>
<TE>   That idea reflects the personal belief of Broad, founder of
multibillion-dollar businesses in housing and financial services,
that a good manager can manage anything. Corporate-style governance,
he argues, is needed to fix America's large, ailing school districts.</TE>
<TE>   That notion already has been embraced by school districts in a
handful of cities, including Los Angeles, San Diego, Chicago and
Seattle, which in recent years have hired superintendents from
outside education.</TE>
<TE>   Broad wants to build on those examples. According to the program's
written goals, by the end of 2004, graduates of his foundation's
academy will lead 25 of the nation's 75 largest urban districts.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone who runs a large urban school district truly is a CEO,"
says Broad. "If we could help to train leaders for those districts,
and train them well, I think it could make a big impact on quality."</TE>
<TE>   Broad and his wife, Edythe, launched the foundation in 1999 with
$100 million. Focused on kindergarten through 12th-grade education in
large cities, the foundation makes grants to improve governance and
management. Planning for the superintendents academy began 18 months
ago.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the foundation has spent $1 million on developing the
academy and recruiting the first class of 25 "fellows." The 25
students, who gathered for their first session in Marina del Rey last
month, will meet on five additional weekends in Miami, Atlanta,
Houston, Detroit and Washington, D.C., before year's end. Topics
range from "Politics of Urban School Leadership" to "Planning and
Leading Systems Change" to "Securing a Job as an Urban
Superintendent." There is no tuition and all expenses are paid, at an
estimated cost of $28,000 per person.</TE>
<TE>   After those sessions and eight days of "independent learning," the
25 will be considered graduates. In materials handed out to them,
Broad indicates that his goal is to have at least 25% of fellows
serving as superintendents within 18 months and 40% within 30 months
of their graduation.</TE>
<TE>   That is a tall order, particularly for an academy that recruits
some executives with little or no experience in education. Broad and
the foundation have pitched the school as a place that will turn
corporate executives into superintendents.</TE>
<TE>   But a visit to that first class suggests that promoting such
mid-career changes will be more difficult than imagined. The group
includes only four people from outside education: recently retired
vice presidents from Eastman Kodak and AT&amp;T, a Philadelphia
consultant, and a former publisher of the Los Angeles Times. And two
of them taught earlier in their lives.</TE>
<TE>   The other 21 are veteran education professionals: four current
superintendents, 11 others who hold top positions in school
districts, a charter school president, the leader of a Philadelphia
education fund, the president of a for-profit educational company,
and two administrators from higher education.</TE>
<TE>   Though Broad calls the concept new, the academy actually parallels
research and programs performed by the Michigan Leadership Institute,
the billionaire philanthropist's home state. Quinn, managing director
of the Broad superintendents academy, also is president of the
Michigan group.</TE>
<TE>   Quinn leads the classes. He has served as superintendent of
schools in Green Bay, Wis., as a deputy state superintendent in
Wisconsin, and as president of a Michigan college, but he never led
one of the large urban school districts that academy graduates seek
to reach.</TE>
<TE>   He does not see that as a liability. "Vince Lombardi never played
professional football," he says.</TE>
<TE>   The academy relies heavily on guest speakers who have that
top-level experience. A former president of the Maryland Board of
Education and superintendents from Seattle, Oakland, San Francisco
and Detroit all have spoken to the students.</TE>
<TE>   The first session concludes with job-hunting advice from the
president of a Seattle-area executive search firm. The academy's
"faculty," as the Broad Foundation calls it, also includes academics
and researchers. Ben Perez, an education consultant, discusses the
Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, an instrument that measures a person's
personality traits.</TE>
<TE>   Though the discussion is leadership and education, Quinn steers
the session repeatedly to the personal; students are urged to share
stories from their lives. "Self-understanding" is the stated goal.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the soft side of leadership we're covering right here,"
says Quinn. "If you don't establish that understanding, you won't
know who you are and the people you want to lead won't know who you
are."</TE>
<TE>   Quinn sometimes breaks the students into groups of five. In one
session, they are asked to share their answers to personal questions:
What is your favorite keepsake? Which person most influenced you?
Name something nobody knows about you.</TE>
<TE>   Marti J. Smith, who recently retired from a vice presidency at
Eastman Kodak, talked about her difficult childhood and a typing
teacher who inspired her to go to college. Smith, 52, taught for a
few years after college but switched to the business world, working
at Coors, Miller Brewing Co., Tyson Foods and U.S. West
Communications. She began thinking of a career shift after the death
of her mother eight years ago. "There was more to leave on this Earth
than a bank account for my nephews," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, she posted her resume on monster.com, and Quinn sent
her an e-mail. "Becoming a superintendent wasn't a thought to me
before that," she says. But she likes the open and warm approach of
Quinn and the academy.</TE>
<TE>   "I love it," she says. "Being a superintendent is something I know
I'm going to love."</TE>

<HD>Herbert Houck, 86; Ace Helped Sink Yamato</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Herbert Houck, a Navy pilot who led the final assault that sank
Japan's behemoth battleship Yamato in the World War II struggle for
Okinawa, has died. He was 86.</LD>
<LD>   Houck, an ace who shot down six Japanese planes and earned three
Navy crosses, died Feb. 24 in Cape Coral, Fla. The cause of death was
not announced.</LD>
<LD>   The Yamato was one of only two 72,000-ton battleships and carried
the largest guns ever sent to sea--nine of them, each of which could
hurl 3,200-pound armor-piercing shells.</LD>
<TE>   Once American troops began landing on Okinawa in April 1945, the
Yamato, along with an accompanying cruiser and eight destroyers, was
sent to thwart the invasion. Its mission was regarded as a kamikaze
effort, with only enough fuel to get there. A 1954 book later quoted
its captain as saying, "What a glorious way to die! The last banzai!"</TE>
<TE>   But Lt. Cmdr. Houck, as head of 43 fighter, dive and torpedo
bomber planes flying off the aircraft carrier Yorktown the afternoon
of April 7, 1945, turned the glory to the American side.</TE>
<TE>   Houck later wrote that his group's primary target was the escort
ships. But seeing the Yamato listing at 20 degrees as a result of
bombing by other U.S. fighter planes, he gave the order to send some
of his torpedo bombers toward the Yamato.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioned shortly after Pearl Harbor, the Japanese juggernaut
had its armor increased during the war and participated in both the
Battle of the Philippine Sea and Leyte.</TE>
<TE>   "I approved" the attack on the Yamato, he said, "providing the
torpedo depth was changed from 10 feet to 20 feet. That done, the
torpedo would hit below the thicker armor plate. I saw the runs and
figured they got at least five hits. With the 20-degree listing, the
torpedoes exploded right into the belly of the ship. A couple minutes
later, the Yamato rolled over and blew up."</TE>
<TE>   Only about 300 sailors were rescued, and nearly 2,500 officers and
crew died, mostly in the explosion. Destroying the Yamato effectively
crippled the Japanese navy.</TE>
<TE>   "The explosion was horrendous," Houck wrote, "sending a huge
smoke-and-fire ball up to my flying altitude of 1,000 feet."</TE>
<TE>   Long after the war, the Japanese remained fascinated by the ship
and in 1985 located the wreckage at a depth of 1,100 feet.</TE>
<TE>   Houck, from Cromwell, Minn., attended the University of Minnesota
for three years before joining the Navy in 1936.</TE>
<TE>   He became known for leading carrier-based bomber flights during
the war, including flying in the first wave of a mass strike on Tokyo
in 1945. His squadron shot down 120 enemy planes in a nine-month tour
of duty, believed to be a record for a carrier-based squadron at the
time.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy flier was promoted to captain in 1956 and appointed
commander of the aircraft carrier Shangri-La in 1960. He retired in
1968.</TE>
<TE>   Survivors include his wife, Jeannette; a son, Robert; two
daughters, Mary Tatman and Susan Houck; one sister; and five
grandchildren.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Mahmoud al-Brekan, 73, the Iraqi poet who was a pioneer of free verse
in Arabic literature, died Saturday at his home in Basra, Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   The Al-Thawra newspaper reported Sunday that he was killed by
thieves who broke into his house.</LD>
<LD>   Al-Brekan is remembered both for the quality of his verse and for
his reluctance to publish it.</LD>
<TE>   He never gave a reason for why he stopped publishing after a few
years.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, photocopies of his free verse circulated widely in
Arabic literary circles.</TE>
<TE>   Among his best-known works are the collections of verse titled
"The City's Depth and the Silent Starvation," "The Slaves Market" and
"Dancing in Graveyards."</TE>
<TE>   The exiled Iraqi writer Hussein Shaban said that al-Brekan, a
teacher, preferred not to publish in order "to avoid political,
ideological and literary bickering" and "as a protest against
coercion."</TE>

<LD>James Jenkins, 79, a retired Navy officer who served as an aide to
Ronald Reagan both in the California governor's office and the White
House, died Feb. 28 of congestive heart failure in Rocklin, Calif.</LD>
<LD>   When Reagan was governor, Jenkins wore three hats: as the state's
chief lobbyist in the nation's capital; as director of public affairs
in the governor's office; and as secretary of the Health and Welfare
Agency (now Health and Human Services Agency).</LD>
<LD>   Jenkins served as a Navy officer for 22 years after graduating
from the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy.</LD>
<TE>   He retired as a captain in 1966 having served as public relations
officer for four secretaries of the Navy.</TE>
<TE>   When he left the Navy, he was hired by the city of San Diego as
its lobbyist in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, Reagan persuaded Jenkins to join his staff as
California's lobbyist in the nation's capital.</TE>
<TE>   During Reagan's first term as president, Jenkins was chief deputy
to Edwin Meese when he was presidential counselor.</TE>

<HD>C. Wagner, 89; Longtime Napa Wine Producer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RUSS PARSONS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Charles F. "Charlie" Wagner, the force behind the legendary Caymus
Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignons and one of the Napa Valley's crustiest
characters, died in his sleep Wednesday at his home in Rutherford. He
was 89.</LD>
<LD>   Wagner was a bridge between the old and new Napas. He was born in
Rutherford--only a couple hundred yards from where he died--to a
fruit-growing family. In 1942 he bought a 60-acre farm on part of the
old Rancho Caymus land grant and established a vineyard on part of
it, selling the grapes to wineries such as Inglenook.</LD>
<LD>   In the fashion of Napa in those days, he also grew prunes and
potatoes. As the valley became more wine oriented, so did he. In
1972, at age 60, he grew tired of getting low prices for grapes that
wound up in other people's expensive wines. So he began making his
own, with the help of his wife, Lorna, son Charles J. "Chuck" Wagner
and their first winemaker, Randy Dunn.</LD>
<TE>   This put Caymus in the first wave of high-quality wine production
as the Napa Valley began shifting from bulk to boutique. In 1975, he
released the first of Caymus' "Special Selection" Cabernet
Sauvignons, an intensely flavored wine made from carefully selected
grapes. It was an almost instant success and helped ignite the craze
for so-called cult Cabernets that continues today.</TE>
<TE>   "What Charlie did for the business was push for quality and set a
standard," said David Breitstein, owner of the Duke of Bourbon wine
store in Canoga Park, since 1967 one of Southern California's prime
retailers of California wines.</TE>
<TE>   "And he did it without flaunting. He was never one of the guys you
saw at the [Napa Valley] wine auction. He wasn't flamboyant. He was
just a good sound businessman, and he knew how to grow great grapes."</TE>
<TE>   Wagner never did consider himself a winemaker. He was a farmer, he
insisted. And the high quality of his wines came not from any winery
magic but from the many hours he spent on the seat of his tractor.</TE>
<TE>   "There's more work than glory in being a farmer, but I get a lot
of satisfaction out of it," he told an interviewer several years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The first Special Select Cabernet, along with a handful of other
wines, including Heitz Vineyards' "Martha's Vineyard," Beaulieu
Vineyards' "George de la Tour" and the Robert Mondavi "Reserve,"
helped prove that great--not just good--wines could be made in the
Napa Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "Rarely if ever has a Cabernet struck me with as much impact,"
then-Los Angeles Times wine writer Dan Berger wrote of the 1985
Special Selection, calling it "one of the most intense wines ever
made in California."</TE>
<TE>   The Special Selection, current vintages of which now sell for more
than $100 a bottle, was twice named the best wine in the world by
Wine Spectator magazine. Characteristically, a cover story on Wagner
in that magazine bore the headline "The Best Damned Cabernet in
California."</TE>
<TE>   "What he did, along with guys like Joe Heitz, Andre Tchelistcheff
and Louis Martini, was establish the idea of the Napa Valley,"
Breitstein said. "They really started our business."</TE>
<TE>   All the attention never did make much of an impression on Wagner.
Until the last few years, he could be found from time to time in the
winery's ramshackle tasting room, dressed in overalls, pouring
samples.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't like to brag about it, but we think we do a good job
here," he would say. "And if people like the wine, well, that's
great."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his wife and son, Wagner is survived by his
daughters, Marlene Wagner Fisher of Napa and Connie Wagner Beitler of
Medford, Ore., and nine grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Amazon's Finance Chief to Step Down This Year</HD>
<DH>Internet: CFO Warren Jenson helped guide the online
retailer to achieve its goal of profitability last quarter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT HILLIS</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>Amazon.com Inc. said Tuesday that Chief Financial Officer Warren
Jenson, who helped guide the online retailer to its first profit amid
widespread doubt it could ever make money, would resign later in the
year.</LD>
<LD>   Jenson, who has served as CFO since September 1999, said he had
taken the job with the aim of bringing Amazon to profitability, a
goal the Seattle-based company hit last quarter with a surprise net
profit.</LD>
<LD>   Amazon did not give a precise date for Jenson's departure, saying
only that he would stay on for several months and help in the search
for his successor. Amazon shares, which fell nearly 3.1% on Nasdaq on
Tuesday, slid an additional 4% in after-hours trading to $15.30.</LD>
<TE>   Jenson, 45, said he laid the groundwork for a possible departure
about a year ago in a talk with Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.</TE>
<TE>   "I sat down with Jeff and told him my first objective for the
company was to work to drive to profitability. I told him at that
point it would be a logical time to take a step back and assess the
next set of challenges that I wanted to take on," Jenson said.</TE>
<TE>   The departure would not affect Amazon's goal of generating
positive operating cash flow in 2002, Bezos, who also is Amazon's
chief executive, said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Amazon has said it aims to generate operating cash flow and
possibly free cash flow for all of 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Jenson tried to soothe the market's worries by sounding a note of
confidence in Amazon.</TE>
<TE>   "For investors, I would say this company is in great shape. I
don't think I could have left had it not been in great shape," Jenson
said. "Investors should feel very comfortable with that."</TE>
<TE>   He declined to say what other opportunities he was interested in
pursuing, saying only that once his successor was in place, "We'll
see what's out there."</TE>

<HD>Plan to Speed Up Merger Reviews Angers Senator</HD>
<DH>Antitrust: Hollings says pact between Justice Department
and the FTC is a violation of appropriations law.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Antitrust enforcers at the Justice Department and Federal Trade
Commission moved ahead Tuesday with their new plan for dividing
merger reviews over the angry objections of Senate Commerce Committee
Chairman Ernest F. Hollings (D.-S.C.).</LD>
<LD>   The Justice Department would get authority over all deals in the
media and entertainment business as part of the deal, which the
agencies said was aimed at speeding up reviews.</LD>
<LD>   Originally planned for January, the initiative got sidetracked by
criticism from Democrats at the FTC and in Congress.</LD>
<TE>   The department and the FTC said they had been engaged in extensive
consultation with lawmakers, but Hollings said that dialogue had not
finished and hinted that he could wield his funding power over the
agencies.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe this is in violation of appropriations law, which
states that we be consulted," said Hollings, who also is chairman of
the Appropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction that includes the
Justice Department and the FTC.</TE>
<TE>   The heads of the FTC and the Justice Department's antitrust
division signed a memorandum that gives each more clear-cut authority
over a variety of U.S. industries.</TE>
<TE>   "Allocating industry sectors in a more rational manner will enable
the department to investigate more efficiently possible
anti-competitive conduct affecting consumers and will provide greater
certainty to the business community, all of which is good for
consumers," said Justice Department antitrust chief Charles James.</TE>
<TE>   The FTC is run by an independent, bipartisan board of
commissioners. The Justice Department is an agency of the executive
branch.</TE>
<TE>   FTC Chairman Tim Muris said the department will get jurisdiction
over media and entertainment because "its expertise in this area far
outweighs that of the FTC."</TE>
<TE>   Critics such as FTC Commissioner Mozelle Thompson had said ceding
that authority to the Justice Department "may deprive consumers of
the benefit of the commission's independence, expertise and
knowledge."</TE>
<TE>   Muris fanned the flames of the dispute even further last month
when he decided to cede to the department the review of Comcast
Corp.'s bid to buy AT&amp;T Corp.'s cable operations.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement gives the Justice Department authority over
aeronautics, agriculture and associated biotechnology, avionics,
beer, computer software, cosmetics and hair care, defense
electronics, financial services, insurance and stock, option, bond
and commodity markets, flat glass, health insurance, industrial
equipment, media and entertainment, metals, mining and minerals,
missiles, tanks and armored vehicles, naval defense products,
photography and film, pulp, paper, lumber and timber,
telecommunications services and equipment, travel and transportation,
waste.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement gives the FTC authority over airframes, autos and
trucks, building materials, chemicals, computer hardware, energy,
grocery manufacturing, the operation of grocery stores, health care,
industrial gases, munitions, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology,
professional services, the operation of retail stores, satellite
manufacturing and launch vehicles and textiles.</TE>

<HD>Disney Signs Kwan to Endorsement Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Walt Disney Co. signed Olympic figure skating bronze medalist
Michelle Kwan to a three-year contract to endorse the company's
products, including its theme parks, restaurants and movies.
Financial terms of the contract weren't disclosed.</LD>
<LD>   The partnership continues Kwan's relationship with Disney. The
21-year-old Californian starred in television specials for Disney and
its ABC network, and contributed to figure skating-related books
published by the company. The contract is the first for Kwan since
her third-place finish at the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, a
performance many marketing executives said might hurt her chance at
lucrative endorsements.</LD>

<HD>Granite May Miss Payments Over TV Sale</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Granite Broadcasting Corp., a television broadcaster with stations in
New York and California, said it may miss interest payments due in
the second quarter if it can't complete the sale of San Francisco
affiliate KNTV to General Electric Co.'s NBC unit.</LD>
<LD>   The company agreed to sell KNTV to NBC on Dec. 17 for $230 million
to pay debt. KNTV became NBC's San Francisco affiliate Jan. 1,
helping NBC expand in the No. 5 U.S. media market. The station
broadcasts on Channel 11 from San Jose.</LD>
<LD>   New York-based Granite expects the sale to close May 2. Paxson
Communications Corp. filed a petition to deny the sale with the
Federal Communications Commission as a result of a legal dispute with
NBC, Granite said.</LD>
<TE>   KNTV carried NBC's coverage of the Winter Olympics in the Bay
Area.</TE>
<TE>   Granite has interest payments of $8 million and $1.6 million due
May 15 and June 1, respectively, and won't be able to make them if
the transaction isn't completed, the company said.</TE>

<HD>Average Cost of Studio Film Down 13% in 2001</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hollywood studios spent an average of $47.7 million to produce a film
in 2001, down 13% from the previous year, Motion Picture Assn. of
America President Jack Valenti said.</LD>
<LD>   Marketing costs for the typical studio movie last year rose 14% to
$31 million, he said. Valenti, the U.S. film industry's chief
spokesman and lobbyist, said the higher expenses came from increased
television advertising. Combined production and marketing costs fell
4.1% to an average of $78.7 million.</LD>
<LD>   Last year's lower costs stand in contrast to the trend of the
1990s, when production and marketing expenses more than doubled for
the major Hollywood studios. Valenti's figures are based on data from
MPAA members, including AOL Time Warner Inc.'s Warner Bros., Walt
Disney Co., Viacom Inc.'s Paramount Pictures and News Corp.'s 20th
Century Fox.</LD>

Electronics Corp. and gaining control of the U.S. market for
satellite television service, Missouri Atty. Gen. Jeremiah Nixon
said.</LD>
<LD>   The proposed $33-billion combination would give one-third of
Missouri residents a single choice for pay television or fast
Internet access, Nixon said in written testimony prepared for a
subcommittee hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee today.</LD>
<LD>   EchoStar says buying DirecTV parent Hughes from General Motors
Corp. will provide competition to cable monopolies, more local news
and fast Internet access. The Justice Department and Federal
Communications Commission must approve the combination.</LD>

<HD>Lilly to Offer Discount Card to Some Medicare Recipients</HD>
<DH>Pharmaceuticals: Low-income patients will be able to buy
any of the firm's prescription medicines for $12 for a month's
supply.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eli Lilly &amp; Co. said Tuesday it will offer some low-income Medicare
patients a discount card for the purchase of any company prescription
medicine at a fixed cost of $12 for a month's supply, a price lower
than that offered by other large drug makers.</LD>
<LD>   Lilly's move follows announcements of discount cards in the last
year by U.S. drug giant Pfizer Inc. and European drug makers Novartis
and GlaxoSmithKline, which also are geared for low-income and
disabled Medicare patients who have no drug coverage.</LD>
<LD>   Indianapolis-based Lilly said its LillyAnswers card will save
patients an average of about $52 per monthly prescription. But to
qualify, seniors must have an annual income of less than $18,000 per
individual or $24,000 per household--the same income caps set for
Pfizer's card.</LD>
<TE>   Lilly's drugs include antidepressant Prozac, diabetes treatment
Humulin, Zyprexa for schizophrenia and Evista for osteoporosis.</TE>
<TE>   Pfizer's card, unveiled in January, allows patients to pay $15 for
each prescription filled with its medicines, for a savings of about
$50 a prescription, the firm said.</TE>
<TE>   The drug makers have introduced their cards amid a long delay by
Congress in reforming the Medicare program for seniors and the
disabled to include coverage for prescription drugs. The federal
program typically reimburses enrollees for drugs only if they are
taken in a hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Lilly spokesman Ed West said as many as 12 million people in the
Medicare program have no drug coverage from other sources, but only
about 5 million of them would qualify for his company's discount
card.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to do something to help the most needy, but we can't
offer discounted Lilly drugs to every person in America because we
can't afford that. We have to stay in business," West said.</TE>
<TE>   West acknowledged consumers might be confused by the crazy quilt
of discount cards being offered by large drug makers, saying that was
why Lilly set income limits identical to Pfizer's.</TE>
<TE>   Medicare enrollees can apply for the Lilly card by calling (877)
795-4559.</TE>
<TE>   Lilly shares fell $1.25 to $77.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Here is a chronology of the antitrust actions involving Microsoft
Corp.:</LD>
<LD>   June 1990: The Federal Trade Commission secretly investigates
possible collusion between Microsoft and IBM Corp. but ultimately
takes no action and closes the investigation after commissioners
deadlock.</LD>
<LD>   Aug. 1993: The Justice Department takes over the Microsoft
investigation, getting the company to sign a consent decree in 1994
agreeing to change contracts with PC makers and eliminate some
restrictions on other software makers.</LD>
<TE>   Oct. 1997: The Justice Department sues Microsoft, alleging that it
violated the consent decree.</TE>
<TE>   May 1998: The Justice Department and state regulators file a
landmark antitrust suit against Microsoft.</TE>
<TE>   Oct. 1998: Antitrust trial begins before U.S. District Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   Nov. 1999: Jackson releases preliminary findings, labeling
Microsoft a monopoly that has used its position to harm competition
and consumers.</TE>
<TE>   April 2000: Settlement efforts collapse. Jackson finds Microsoft
in violation of antitrust laws. The Justice Department urges the
court to split Microsoft into two companies.</TE>
<TE>   June 2000: Jackson orders the company be split into two companies.</TE>
<TE>   June 2001: A federal appeals panel reverses Jackson's breakup
order but rules that Microsoft violated antitrust laws. The court
orders a new penalty phase and disqualifies Jackson from presiding
over the case because of "deliberate, repeated, egregious and
flagrant" violations of judicial ethics during trial.</TE>
<TE>   Aug. 2001: U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly is named to
preside over the new penalty phase of the antitrust case.</TE>
<TE>   Nov. 2001: The Justice Department reaches a tentative settlement
with Microsoft. Nine of the 18 states that joined in the suit refuse
to agree to the pact.</TE>
<TE>   March 2002: So-called Tunney Act hearings begin to determine the
settlement's fairness to the public. The lawsuit by the nine states
opposing the settlement is scheduled to begin.</TE>

<HD>Moody's Cuts Qwest's Rating</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Phone company says it's on better footing, but
rating firm brings it to one notch above 'junk.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>ORLANDO, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Rating company Moody's Investors Service cut Qwest Communications
International Inc. to one notch above "junk" status even as Qwest
said that it was on track to meet its financial forecasts and that
demand from business customers might be firming.</LD>
<LD>   Moody's cut its long-term rating on Qwest and its units and warned
it might downgrade the Denver voice and data services company further
if it was unable to renegotiate its $4-billion credit pact and raise
funds to pay off its nearly $25-billion debt load.</LD>
<LD>   "The warning is not to be taken lightly," said Wayne Schmidt, who
helps invest $1 billion for Advantus Capital Management in St. Paul,
Minn.</LD>
<TE>   Qwest, the dominant local phone company in 14 states from
Minnesota to Washington, has been in talks with its lenders about an
extension or relief of the cash-flow requirements in its lending
agreement, Moody's said. Qwest President Afshin Mohebbi reiterated
Tuesday that the company expected to be fully funded through early
next year.</TE>
<TE>   Qwest also is weighing the sale of certain assets to raise cash.</TE>
<TE>   "The downgrades reflect concerns about Qwest's ability to resolve
substantial near-term debt maturities, including the need to
negotiate a covenant waiver under its $4-billion bank facility and
repay $850 million of maturing long-term debt in July," Moody's said.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking at a Credit Suisse First Boston investor conference in
Orlando on Tuesday, Mohebbi said the company was on track to be
cash-flow positive in the second quarter and to post $19.4 billion in
sales for 2002.</TE>
<TE>   "We're seeing some rays of hope in terms of enterprise demand,
which is very important, coming back," Mohebbi, who also is chief
operating officer, said at the CSFB Telecoms conference.</TE>
<TE>   Fund managers attending the conference said they weren't sure what
to believe.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to believe this management team is made up of fools, or
you have to believe fear has taken hold of the marketplace and people
have extrapolated Enron into everything," said one fund manager, who
declined to be named.</TE>

<HD>Sabre Makes Hostile Travelocity Bid</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sabre Holdings Corp. on Tuesday began a $345-million hostile offer
for the 30% of Travelocity .com Inc. it doesn't own after the
second-biggest U.S. online travel agent rejected the bid.</LD>
<LD>   Travelocity.com said Sabre's tender offer of $23 a share for 15
million shares is "inadequate."</LD>
<LD>   The online company was spun off by Sabre two years ago and
combined with Preview Travel Inc., whose shareholders got 30% of the
new company. The stock has traded as high as $51.88, double the offer
price. Sabre, the biggest U.S. travel-reservation company, needs to
boost its stake to 90% to force remaining investors to tender shares.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Fort Worth-based Travelocity.com, ranked second by value
of travel sold on its site, fell 44 cents to $26.16 on Nasdaq. They
had traded as low as $9.92 in September. Southlake, Texas-based Sabre
rose 1 cent to $48.05 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   The offer was 20% higher than the share price at the time of last
month's announcement. Travelocity.com stock surged 39% after the bid,
a signal that investors want Sabre to increase its price, analysts
say.</TE>
<TE>   Sabre spokesman Michael Berman wouldn't comment on whether the
company will increase its offer price. Executives from Sabre declined
to be interviewed.</TE>
<TE>   Travelocity.com and Sabre have the same chairman, William
Hannigan.</TE>
<TE>   A committee of outside Travelocity.com directors, led by
investment firm Salomon Smith Barney Inc., found that Sabre's offer
was an "opportunistic attempt to acquire Travelocity at a time when
its stock price is temporarily depressed," Travelocity.com said.</TE>
<TE>   If it acquires the rest of Travelocity.com, Sabre plans to add
travel services to boost sales, analysts said.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cray Inc., the Seattle-based supercomputer company, said Chief
Executive Michael Haydock resigned because of differences with the
board over the company's future. Chairman and former CEO James
Rottsolk has taken over Haydock's post. Haydock had worked for IBM
Corp. from 1989 to 2001, last serving as a vice president in its
computer services unit.</LD>
<LD>   Haydock's resignation follows disagreement with board members over
how to return Cray to profitability, the company said without
providing details. Cray plans to finish development of the SV2
computer and begin selling the machine in the second half. The
company also wants to boost sales of its SX-6 computers, used to
predict weather and handle industrial jobs. Cray shares fell 33
cents, or 14%, to $2.04 on Nasdaq.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Deutsche Telekom, Europe's biggest phone company, had a
fourth-quarter loss of $2.17 billion on costs tied to the purchase of
VoiceStream Wireless Corp. and new mobile-phone licenses. The loss
was little changed from a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, the
loss almost doubled to $1.65 billion.</LD>
<LD>   With debt at $54.1billion, interest payments and goodwill costs
related to the purchases will remain a drag on earnings, investors
said.</LD>
<LD>   The fourth-quarter deficit gave Deutsche its first annual loss
since the company sold shares to the public in 1996. Deutsche lost
$3.1billion, contrasted with a profit of $5.1billion the previous
year. Excluding one-time items, the company had a loss of
$4.1billion. Its stock fell 3%, giving the company a market value of
about $61billion.</LD>

<LD>One of the vanity license plates singled out on the knx1070.com Web
site this month is W M P R, owned by Jackie Martin of Corona.</LD>
<LD>   She explained: "No, this isn't a radio station's call letters. It
stands for 'World's Most Perfect Relationship.' My husband and I have
been married 14 times in 14 states--with 36 to go! And we've never
had a cross word between us."</LD>
<LD>   I'll bet the caterer is even happier.</LD>
<TE>   Food for thought (and confusion): Today's servings (see
accompanying) include:</TE>
<TE>   * A restaurant that Paul Daniels of Huntington Beach figured was
either "bragging that they're down to one location or that they
expanded from zero"--he wasn't sure which.</TE>
<TE>   * A credit card receipt from Vicki Momary of Torrance, who noticed
that another eatery didn't seem to know its location.</TE>
<TE>   * A chef whose fame seems to know no boundaries, or does it? (from
Francesca Gard of Long Beach).</TE>
<TE>   * And, finally, in another of those weird-science experiments that
seem so common, a delicacy that could be half chicken and half bear
(from Marion Graff of L.A.).</TE>
<TE>   Animal owners who belong in cages: It's been quiet in Laguna Beach
for city animal services officer Joy Lingenfelter, but she calls it
"the lull before the storm."</TE>
<TE>   Spring is coming--the birthing season for critters such as
raccoons, who, Lingenfelter said, think nothing of "tearing shingles
off roofs and ripping open vents" to find places to start families.</TE>
<TE>   Then comes the summer--exotic animals season. Crowded beach areas
often attract characters showing off eye-catching pets, and
Lingenfelter has made some notable rescues.</TE>
<TE>   One man would smuggle monkeys in from Mexico and take them to
public places, such as Laguna Beach, "to meet women," she said. "He
even tied one to the roof of his car while he was at the Laundromat."</TE>
<TE>   Not-so-humane humans (cont.): Lingenfelter also recalled these
cases:</TE>
<TE>   * A guy trying to sell leashed tigers out of the back of his red
sports car near the beach. He got away but was later apprehended
while displaying them at Newport's Fashion Island.</TE>
<TE>   * A 2-foot long Cayman alligator found in a creek in Laguna. "He
[the gator] had probably lost his entertainment value for the owner,
so he was abandoned," Lingenfelter said. "That happens a lot with
exotic animals."</TE>
<TE>   * Then there was the lion cub that was flown in from the Midwest
in a dog cage. The animal belonged to two women.</TE>
<TE>   Said Lingenfelter: "They wanted to use him in their strip show in
Long Beach."</TE>
<TE>   Support issues: L.A. School Board member David Tokofsky called to
say he spotted a billboard of curvaceous Angelyne next to the stalled
Belmont Learning Complex project. Commented Tokofsky: "I'm not sure
which is a bigger bust, Angelyne or Belmont."</TE>
<TE>   MiscelLAny: The discovery of the day was made by Phil Azelton of
Westwood, who bought a doorstop at a drugstore and read these not so
hard-to-follow instructions:</TE>
<TE>   "Wedge doorstop between floor and door until tight."</TE>

<LD>Man's Abduction May Be Drug-Related</LD>
<LD>   Authorities on Tuesday searched for a 30-year-old man and the
group of men who apparently abducted him in a possibly drug-related
act, police said. Shortly before 3 p.m., five or six men forced
Calvin Hardy from his mother's Long Beach home in the 100 block of
West Mountain View Street, said Long Beach police Officer Jana Blair.</LD>
<LD>   The assailants, who were unarmed, apparently knew Hardy, police
said. They beat him as they dragged him into a white van, Blair said.</LD>
<TE>   Hardy is 6 feet, 1 inch and weighs 170 pounds, she said. Anyone
who has seen the suspects, the van or Hardy was asked to call police
at (562) 435-6711.</TE>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>People who watch illegal street races could be slapped with a $500
fine under a motion approved Tuesday by the Los Angeles County Board
of Supervisors.</LD>
<LD>   "Illegal street racing is a dangerous, reckless activity that
threatens the lives of our young people. This ordinance will decrease
the number of spectators at these events and help reduce street
racing overall," said county Supervisor Mike Antonovich.</LD>
<LD>   Violation of the ordinance will constitute a misdemeanor. In
addition to a fine, spectators at races face jail terms of up to six
months.</LD>
<TE>   "There have been numerous deaths over the years connected to
illegal street racing," said Tony Bell, an Antonovich aide.
"Hopefully, this helps remove one of the incentives for having street
races."</TE>

<LD>More students are enrolled this semester at Cal State Northridge than
at any time in the campus' 44-year history.</LD>
<LD>   Enrollment has reached a record high with 31,681 full- and
part-time students attending the San Fernando Valley's only four-year
university, spokeswoman Carmen Ramos Chandler said. The number tops
the previous record enrollment set in fall semester 1988 by 233
students.</LD>
<LD>   However, increased enrollment and demand for classes has prompted
administrators to close fall admissions to freshman and sophomore
transfer students, and to all post-baccalaureate applicants who are
not in a degree program, officials said. Admissions for those seeking
graduate degrees remain open.</LD>

<LD>A felony charge was dismissed against some defendants in the
videotaped assault on a 19-year-old college student in Isla Vista but
a judge let the remaining four counts stand.</LD>
<LD>   The videotape shows members of the group offering the former
freshman shots of rum, writing on his naked body and placing garbage
on the unconscious student as he lay on a couch in the street.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge Frank Ochoa ruled that there was insufficient
evidence that Scott James Carter, Matthew Francis Blessing, Charles
Lawrence Anderson and Joshua Matthew Burns gave the victim alcohol to
imprison him. But he let stand charges, including a sexual battery
count, against three of the men.</LD>

<LD>Indicted Hells Angels leader George Christie Jr., who is being held
under house arrest on drug and racketeering charges, will be allowed
to attend his mother's funeral.</LD>
<LD>   Christie, 54, obtained a court order permitting him to attend the
services this week. He will be escorted by his attorney.</LD>
<LD>   Christie, his ex-wife, their 25-year-old son and several members
of the Ventura chapter of the Hells Angels motorcycle club were
indicted last year. Christie spent 11 months in jail before posting
$1 million bond in January. Under the terms of his release, he cannot
leave his Ventura residence except to attend court appearances.</LD>
<TE>   Georgia Christie died last week of complications of pancreatic
cancer. She was 82.</TE>

<LD>A 7-year-old girl kidnapped from her bedroom early Tuesday escaped by
jumping from her abductor's car when he stopped to look for his lost
wallet, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Police found a wallet in front of the girl's home and waited for
the suspect at the San Bernardino address on his driver's license,
said Chip Patterson of the San Bernardino County Sheriff's
Department.</LD>
<LD>   Police arrested Dennis Martin Castro, 24, when he arrived about
three hours after the 3:30 a.m. abduction. The girl "is unharmed,
aside from being frightened," Patterson said.</LD>

<LD>Palestinian suicide bombers kill Israelis on street corners. Israel
retaliates with helicopter gunship attacks. Israeli troops search
door to door in Palestinian refugee camps. A sniper kills seven
Israeli soldiers and three settlers. The assaults and counterattacks
in the worst violence in Israel and the occupied territories in 17
months now threaten to blend into a seamless tapestry of death. That
increases the burden on nations with influence in the region,
particularly Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United States, to push the
combatants toward a cease-fire as a first step toward peace talks.</LD>
<LD>   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met with President Bush Tuesday,
with both men praising Saudi Arabia's proposal to have Israel
withdraw from territories it has occupied since the 1967 Middle East
war in return for recognition by Arab nations. The proposal is
essentially a vague restatement of the long-standing "land for peace"
vision. But it gets noticed because no better alternatives have
appeared.</LD>
<LD>   Mubarak arrived in Washington urging Israeli Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon to meet with Palestinian Authority chief Yasser Arafat in
Egypt. Israel quickly rejected the suggestion.</LD>
<TE>   Israel has confined Arafat to his headquarters at Ramallah for
months. That virtual house arrest has certainly not quelled the
violence, and Israel should at least let Arafat attend an Arab summit
in Lebanon later this month. Arab leaders are more likely to talk
honestly with Arafat face to face.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration, which has seldom criticized Sharon, took
both sides to task Tuesday. Presidential spokesman Ari Fleischer said
the recent violence had killed both "innocent Israelis and innocent
Palestinians," and Bush talked of families on both sides "shattered"
by gunfire and bombings. The president also restated the goal of a
Palestinian state coexisting with Israel, both enjoying secure
borders.</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer last week suggested that the Clinton administration's
unsuccessful peace initiative in the region led to the latest
violence. He later acknowledged he was wrong and apologized. The
incident is indicative of the Bush administration's fear of getting
bogged down in the Mideast conflict. But Bush should realize that
many Arabs blame the United States for arming Israel and not pushing
to end the violence. Washington needs the help of Arab nations not
just in the Mideast but in the worldwide fight against terror. That
of course does not mean withdrawing support for Israel. A tough line
to walk, indeed.</TE>
<TE>   Vice President Dick Cheney should concentrate more on peace in the
region during his Mideast visit next week than on toppling Iraqi
leader Saddam Hussein. First things first. Bush also promised to send
Mideast envoy Anthony C. Zinni back to the region "when appropriate,"
which should mean as soon as there is a lull in the violence.</TE>

<LD>There are names for adults who prey upon the innocence of children
for their own sick gratification: predator, pedophile, pervert....
And because the Catholic Church has been so lethargic in dealing with
this tragic phenomenon in its ranks, people increasingly associate
"child molester" with another word: "priest."</LD>
<LD>   This is not fair. The majority of Catholic priests are no doubt
drawn to their calling out of compassion and a commitment to serve
their God. But the public can hardly be blamed for a distorted
perception, given the church's refusal to aggressively address the
scandals that have rocked it. A priest's abuse of a minor is not just
a matter among parents, children and the church hierarchy. One of
society's sacred duties is to protect its most vulnerable members. To
fulfill that responsibility demands that law enforcement investigate
each credible allegation of child abuse and that those prosecuted and
found guilty be punished for their crimes.</LD>
<LD>   As reported in The Times this week, Cardinal Roger M. Mahony has
quietly directed as many as a dozen Southern California priests
suspected of past sexual abuse to retire or leave their ministries.
That's good as far as it goes. But police agencies told Times
reporters Larry B. Stammer, William Lobdell and Richard Winton that
none of those cases appear ever to have been referred for criminal
prosecution.</LD>
<TE>   Under state  law, anyone who knows of molestation must report it
to authorities; priests are not shielded from the law unless they
hear it in confession. Failure to report such a crime is a
misdemeanor. Thus there is a legal as well as a moral imperative for
Mahony to come forward and let criminal investigators know who these
accused child molesters are and where they are going. The bishop of
Orange, Tod D. Brown, did just that and did it in the open, even
allowing the priest accused of molesting a teenage boy 19 years ago
to say goodbye to parishioners at services last weekend.</TE>
<TE>   In that case, the victim has never filed criminal charges, making
it very unlikely that authorities will prosecute. Many parents opt to
file civil suits, which does not necessarily protect the next child
an abusive priest might encounter. That pattern needs breaking.
Catholic parents, priests and lay leaders should report accusations
of abuse to law enforcement at the same time they complain to the
church, and police need to investigate church-related allegations
with the same determined detective work as any other hint that
someone has molested a child.</TE>
<TE>   In past statements, the Los Angeles Archdiocese has promised to
cooperate fully with civil authorities, and Mahony himself was a
member of a national bishops  committee that called for  such steps.
What's he waiting for?</TE>
<TE>   There's a name for a priest who molests a child: criminal. Society
must demand that such men leave their positions, not by being nudged
into retirement, but in handcuffs.</TE>

<LD>Re "Students, Then Teachers," editorial, March 4: Your criticism of
having teachers make decisions on what to teach--such as those on
textbooks, reading requirements in English and multiplication tables
in math--is like criticizing our practice of having rocket engineers
make decisions on how to design a rocket. Who else do you think
should make such decisions--the governor, politicians, media or the
students themselves?</LD>
<LD>   As for the argument on the approach of "older reading teachers" in
teaching reading versus the phonetics-based approach proven by
"scientific research," let us leave it to those specialists who are
responsible for the education of teachers, pre-service as well as
in-service. By the way, researches in education are never
"scientific." They are, at best, selective statistic surveys.</LD>

<TE>   Regarding your misguided condemnation of AB 2160, the reality is
that with the state Department of Education, individual school
districts and so-called educational professionals (professional
bureaucrats) the main concern is, in fact, promoting their own
political agenda. Make no mistake about it, such "educational
reforms" as the SAT 9, the Open Court reading program, new math or
whole-language learning are essentially political remedies designed
to protect an agenda or special interest.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, textbook publishers make a bundle every time a new
educational fad is invoked as the savior of the educational process.
And who is never consulted in all these reforms? The teacher!</TE>

<LD>Re "7 Members of an Israeli Family Are Buried After Weekend Attacks,"
March 4: Nine people--three of them children, mothers with their
babies--leaving a synagogue in Jerusalem were killed by a suicide
bomber from the military wing of Yasser Arafat's Fatah terrorist
movement.</LD>
<LD>   How can anybody compare this massacre with the IDF (Israeli
Defense Forces) attacking terrorist camps, precisely in order to
prevent this same cowardly murdering of innocent civilians from
happening? Only people refusing to see the reality can continue to
consider both acts as equal. If Israel had stopped defending itself,
without any doubt, this precious island of democracy, culture and
peace would have already been destroyed and replaced by the
well-known hate, ignorance and fanaticism predominant in that part of
the world.</LD>

<LD>"Left and Right: Enron, Monica and Blue-Light Specials" (Opinion,
March 3) demeans Ann Coulter, a conservative political journalist
with a sexist reference to her as a "blond Republican babe." With
that description, who can take her seriously?</LD>
<LD>   None of the many male political journalists quoted has been given
any such description, sexist or otherwise, nor has any mention been
made of their political affiliations except for, of course,
conservative David Horowitz, who is described as a "leftie turned
rightie." Shouldn't we have been told that the quoted Noam Chomsky is
a left-wing extremist?</LD>

<LD>Re "Physicians Fold Under Malpractice Fee Burden," March 4: So
physicans in Nevada and other states are closing their practices and
hospitals are closing their trauma centers due to increases in the
cost of malpractice insurance. Insurance cost increases are due in
large measure to a glut of lawsuits. Obviously, this makes the public
worse off: There will be fewer physicans and trauma centers to
provide vital services. Of course, the physicans are worse off as
well. But at least the rapacious lawyers are better off--thanks once
more to our bottom-feeding friends in the legal profession.</LD>

<LD>Re "Frustration Voiced Over 'Just Say No' Sex Education Plan," March
3: The Republicans and other religious fanatics never cease to amaze
me. Abstinence has not worked in centuries and will not work now
unless someone finds a way to neutralize Mother Nature.</LD>
<LD>   Someone should inform the person with the Lamborghini analogy that
if his son got the urge to drive it, he would, whether he leaves the
keys or not. If the urge were great enough, he would even settle for
a Geo. Just telling him "don't" will not stop him, in either case.</LD>

Let's try that, maybe.</LD>

<TE>   It seems as though the conservative agenda is racing, not
creeping, back into national policymaking. The announcements that we
will spend millions on teaching abstinence only and millions more
promoting marriage as a way out of poverty are dangerous policies
that miss the basic issues while offering a value-loaded quick fix to
long-standing social issues. What happens to the millions who won't
reap the alleged benefits of these policies?</TE>
<TE>   We know what happens to the teenager who practices abstinence and
then one day makes a different choice. With little or no information
on birth control, the consequences could be devastating and life
changing.</TE>
<TE>   And what about the millions of residents who can't--or maybe make
healthy choices not to--marry? Will the new policy now make gay
marriages legal so that they too can benefit from the riches to be
realized with a marriage certificate? And let's not forget the
millions of victims of domestic violence who may wish to terminate
their marriages to protect themselves and their families.</TE>
<TE>   Offering ill-conceived solutions to long-standing problems is not
the answer; however, it seems that anything goes now under cover of
the "axis of evil" rhetoric so prevalent in Washington at this time.</TE>

<LD>Re "Letterman Bid Reflects ABC's Shift from News," March 2: Yes,
let's keep America stupid. We don't need intelligent, thoughtful and
incisive news shows like "Nightline" on at 11:30 p.m. when we can
watch stupid pet tricks and sophomoric dillydallying on David
Letterman's talk show. We have far too many serious things going on,
like the World Trade Center bombing and the wars and worldwide
terrorism running rampant. We need more Disney entertainment to keep
our minds simple so we can absorb, like-minded, our president's
simple-minded conception of evil.</LD>
<LD>   I mourn in advance any cancellation of the velvet-rope grandeur of
"Nightline" and its incredibly creative and aesthetic format, which
has enriched me and kept me informed for years. The threat of
"Politically Incorrect" going off the air drops the American IQ a few
more notches too, I might add. I think it's time for me to move to
Canada or Europe.</LD>

<LD>Re "Bush Again Pushes Stock Investments for Social Security," March
1: I read that President Bush has presented his latest proposal to
boost Social Security--401(k)s. I guess Enron and Global Crossing
haven't registered with the White House yet.</LD>
<LD>   As one of those recipients of Social Security, I am not prone to
having any of my money tampered with by so-called experts who seem to
prove, every time they turn around, how dumb they really are. I guess
that the workers at Enron losing their life savings means we should
continue with the same process that cost them their savings.</LD>
<LD>   The White House should quit dipping into Social Security for
bailouts every time it can't balance a budget. Then maybe the program
might last past 2035.</LD>

<LD>Re "Billy Graham Apologizes for '72 Remarks," March 2: Billy Graham's
apology for--and his claim to have "no memory" of--his remarks on the
Nixon White House tapes about the Jewish "stranglehold" on the media
that would take the country "down the drain" ring hollow. Such
remarks "do not reflect my views," he now says, so why did he make
them? Perhaps because he thought former President Nixon would enjoy
hearing them? Either way, the same picture is painted: a hypocritical
phony.</LD>
<LD>   I do believe he's sorry that his comments have come out, but
someone who refers to his "great friends" who are Jewish as a "swarm"
and suggests to the president that they could "do something" about
them doesn't sound like the bridge builder Graham professes to be. If
he had stated that he meant what he said 30 years ago but has since
seen the error of his ways, I might give his apology more credence,
but he seems to me just one more in a long line of smiling,
self-styled seraphs who present one face to the public and another
when they think the cameras (or tape recorders) are turned off.</LD>

<TE>   Is there anyone in the U.S. who benefited more, both personally
and professionally, from exposure in the "Jewish-controlled" media
than Graham? He was a country preacher virtually unknown outside the
Deep South until Leonard Goldenson, head of ABC, offered him a
network television show. "The Hour of Decision" made Graham into a
national and international star. After a few years, however, when his
show's ratings sagged, ABC declined to renew Graham's contract.</TE>
<TE>   Goldenson was Jewish. Is that why Graham encouraged Nixon to
somehow end "Jewish control" of America's media? (I'm the co-author
of Goldenson's autobiography, "Beating the Odds.")</TE>

<TE>   I am afraid that my previous admiration for Graham has forever
disappeared. As a fellow Christian, I am appalled that such a
prominent figure of my faith would knowingly spew forth such bigotry.
I know I am supposed to follow Jesus' example of forgiveness, but
given the deliberate and caustic nature of his remarks and the fact
that he took 30 years to repudiate them, well, it's going to be
awfully tough to forgive in this case.</TE>

<HD>Simon's Turnabout</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Democratic Gov. Gray Davis got his wish Tuesday night. By injecting
himself into the Republican primary, using millions of dollars worth
of attack ads, Davis prevented former Los Angeles Mayor Richard
Riordan from being his reelection opponent in November. Wealthy
conservative neophyte Bill Simon Jr., virtually unknown only a few
months ago, brushed aside both Riordan and Secretary of State Bill
Jones in the GOP gubernatorial primary.</LD>
<LD>   It wasn't just Davis' unorthodox but effective meddling in the
opponents' primary that brought Simon to this double-digit victory.
Simon, 50, came across as more vigorous and focused than the
71-year-old Riordan. He appealed to core conservatives who usually
dominate GOP primaries in California, especially when there is a low
turnout.</LD>
<LD>   Only weeks ago, Riordan was the overwhelming favorite based on his
record as mayor, his moderate positions on issues important to a
majority of Californians and his unscripted personal style. Riordan
claimed to be the candidate Davis feared most for his appeal to the
middle of the political spectrum. As a far-ahead front-runner, he ran
his campaign against Davis, not his GOP opponents.</LD>
<TE>   Newcomer Simon seemed personally stiff and touted a familiar list
of conservative themes--opposition to abortion, taxation,
environmental regulation and big government. After the first GOP
debate, one Sacramento political pro wondered whether Simon was
running for president of the yacht club.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan's rambling campaign failed to respond crisply to attacks
by Davis and Simon. In the end, Riordan accused Simon of being
"extreme," a last-gasp tactic that didn't work against Ronald Reagan
in 1966 and didn't work this year.</TE>
<TE>   A word about Bill Jones, a highly effective secretary of state.
Jones, a moderate former legislator, had more experience and was
better prepared to be governor than either foe. Alas, he couldn't
raise enough money--or excitement--to wage an effective campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Simon has a big mountain to climb: to broaden his message
so he can appeal to a majority of voters. Because of this
ridiculously early primary, he has more than eight months to do
that--or to make a fatal mistake.</TE>
<TE>   Davis will try to paint Simon into a far-right corner, but the
governor cannot take victory on Nov. 5 for granted.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has demonstrated his skill at infighting and fund-raising.
What he needs to do in the next eight months is to convince
Californians he can really govern, something he failed to do in
dealing hesitantly with the energy crisis and the state budget
deficit. Gov. Davis' actions in the next eight months will speak
louder than candidate Davis' words in campaign ads.</TE>

<LD>Re "Bush Began 'Shadow Government' Hours After Sept. 11 Attacks,"
March 1: If the danger of a terrorist nuclear attack on Washington is
so clear and present as to require a shadow government residing in
underground bunkers, does not President Bush have the obligation to
evacuate all civilians and nonessential personnel from the city? The
shadow government raises the question: Are the terrorists running
scared from Bush or is Bush running scared from the terrorists? It
also raises the question whether the hundreds of billions Bush wants
to spend on the Strategic Defense Initiative--an antiballistic
missile defense system--are worthless against the real threat.</LD>

<LD>Although there are still 10 months to go, my candidate for most
demoralizing story of the year is the recent account of U.N. famine
relief officials in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone refusing to
distribute food to starving families unless their children consented
to having sex with them (Feb. 28).</LD>
<LD>   The notion of starving, desperate adolescent girls being coerced
to perform sex acts in exchange for food is horrendous enough, but
for the men involved to be part of an official United Nations
humanitarian mission is almost incomprehensible.</LD>

<HD>County Crime Lab to Expand</HD>
<DH>Forensics: Officials OK a $5.2-million project that should
help facility win national accreditation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County leaders approved a $5.2-million expansion of the
sheriff's crime lab, a much-needed project that should help it win a
key national accreditation.</LD>
<LD>   More than 20 years old and cramped, the lab has a pending
application for accreditation with the American Society of Crime Lab
Directors, said Cmdr. Brent Morris in the department's special
services division.</LD>
<LD>   Such certification is not required for crime labs, but lends
credibility to evidence that is analyzed when a case goes to trial.</LD>
<TE>   "Not having it probably makes our lab employees undergo more
scrutiny on the stand, and makes the D.A.'s job harder," Morris said.
"Having it makes a stronger presentation in court."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the funding for the expansion will come from a $3-million
state grant that Ventura County supervisors accepted Tuesday, about
$500,000 of which must be used for lab equipment.</TE>
<TE>   The remainder will come from a $1.3-million, tax-free loan and
money seized from narcotics busts, Morris said.</TE>
<TE>   Renee Artman, crime lab manager, said the expansion will help
ensure the facility wins national accreditation.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County's lab is one of a handful in the state without that
rating.</TE>
<TE>   Space has been the primary roadblock, Artman said. The national
group recommends 1,000 square feet of work space per scientist to
prevent contamination of samples.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County's lab has 258 square feet.</TE>
<TE>   The crowded conditions have caused a backlog of
evidence--particularly in the narcotics, DNA and firearms
sections--slowed work and hurt employees' morale, Artman said.</TE>
<TE>   Construction could begin within the next six months.</TE>

<HD>'Predator' Sentenced for Abuse</HD>
<DH>Court: Former teacher Paul Alphonse Kreutzer will serve at
least 19 years in prison for molesting 10 girls in the Valley.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former teacher Paul Alphonse Kreutzer smiled at his sobbing victims
Tuesday after he was sentenced to prison for molesting 10 girls in
the San Fernando Valley between 1968 and 1996.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Barry A. Taylor ordered
Kreutzer, 63, to serve 16 years in state prison plus nine consecutive
terms of one year to life. The unusual sentence means that Kreutzer
will not be eligible for parole for 19 years.</LD>
<LD>   Kreutzer pleaded no contest last month to 15 counts of lewd
conduct with a child under 14.</LD>
<TE>   Six of his victims urged Taylor to impose a lengthy prison term.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a predator, and if he is ever set free, God help little
girls and their families, because he will never stop" molesting
children, sobbed one of the victims in the Van Nuys court.</TE>
<TE>   She is one of three sisters who say Kreutzer molested them when
they were students at Our Lady of Peace School in North Hills.</TE>
<TE>   The sisters and other victims spoke to authorities after Kreutzer
was arrested by the FBI in March 2000 for downloading child
pornography onto his computer. He pleaded guilty in federal court
last year on the child pornography charge and was sentenced to 30
months in federal prison.</TE>
<TE>   Kreutzer, who was teaching at Liggett Elementary School in
Panorama City at this time of his arrest, was fired by the Los
Angeles Unified School District after his guilty plea.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Kreutzer, a former president of the Santa Clarita
Historical Society, asked forgiveness for the pain he caused his
victims.</TE>
<TE>   "I express sorrow for any such pain I have caused," he said in a
brief statement to the court.</TE>
<TE>   Kreutzer turned his chair to look directly at each of the women
who testified against him. Most are now in their 30s.</TE>
<TE>   Another one of the three sisters was 10 when she said she told
school officials about her ongoing sexual relationship with Kreutzer.</TE>
<TE>   She testified last year at his preliminary hearing that the
principal at Our Lady of Peace, a nun, spanked and derided her until
she said she was lying.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the woman looked directly at Kreutzer and told him,
"You took my innocence and my emotional well-being."</TE>
<TE>   Despite dramatic testimony, Kreutzer has maintained a strong core
of support among friends near his Canyon Country home. Two women
testified on his behalf.</TE>
<TE>   "I cannot tie the Paul that I know with the things that have been
said about him. Love you, Paul," one said.</TE>
<TE>   But their words were overshadowed by the tears and testimony of
his victims. Mary Anne Seifried met Kreutzer in 1968 at a Saturday
folk dance class he organized at Holy Redeemer Catholic Church in
Montrose.</TE>
<TE>   In court, Seifried, who agreed to the publication of her name,
said she believes that Kreutzer abused more girls over the years.</TE>
<TE>   She said was concerned about two other victims, sisters who came
to the United States from Vietnam with their family in 1975.</TE>
<TE>   They met Kreutzer through Holy Redeemer Church and moved into his
home to learn to speak English. They testified that they took turns
sleeping in the bed of the man they called "Daddy."</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Kreutzer's attorney, Rose Reglos, said he changed his
plea to spare his so-called adopted daughters, the Vietnamese women,
from testifying against him.</TE>
<TE>   "He loves those girls," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But Seifried, 44, rejected that explanation. "Don't say you love
us," she told Kreutzer. "You are confusing love and sex. You don't
know the meaning of love."</TE>
<TE>   After the sentencing, Seifried hugged one of the Vietnamese women
who sat alone in the back of the courtroom crying.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Andrea Thompson called this
a case about a teacher's breach of trust, a theme that resonated
throughout the hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the victims said Kreutzer befriended their unsuspecting
parents to gain unlimited access to their young daughters.</TE>
<TE>   "He took advantage of the trust he had built," Thompson said.</TE>
<TE>   The third of the three sisters said her parents trusted Kreutzer
with her and her siblings.</TE>
<TE>   "We were supposed to trust our elders," she told the judge. "How
am I supposed to teach my daughter to trust her elders?"</TE>

<HD>School Board Approves $51-Million Cut</HD>
<DH>Education: Spending on supplies will be reduced, and funds
taken from accounts intended for low-income schools.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIKA HAYASAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles school board voted Tuesday to cut its spending for
this fiscal year by $51 million, mostly by trimming back on school
supplies and taking money from accounts earmarked for low-income
schools.</LD>
<LD>   Tuesday's cuts are the second wave of reductions that the massive
Los Angeles Unified School District has made this year in response to
a midyear budget crisis. In January, the board voted to cut $56
million, mostly from maintenance and administration funds.</LD>
<LD>   "We went to schools and their [local] superintendents and said,
'Give us the kind of cuts [that will cause] the least harm,'" Supt.
Roy Romer said.</LD>
<TE>   However, Romer added that this year's reductions are not as
painful as what the district will face next year. "I look at this in
light of a $400-million shortfall next year," he said. The district's
total annual budget is about $9 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Board President Caprice Young agreed. "These are the toughest cuts
for this fiscal year because we were running down to the bare bone,"
she said. "These cuts today are not affecting people. But next year
you're looking at increasing class size and laying off staff."</TE>
<TE>   Among Tuesday's cuts, $2.2 million came from funds for supplies
and equipment for local and central district offices. An additional
$14 million came from school accounts, which would have been used for
supplies, and $4.9 million came from an unspent reserve that schools
could have used at their discretions.</TE>
<TE>   The board also voted to take $29.9 million in federal and state
reserve funds that could have been used for supplies, programs and
classroom aides at low-income schools, and apply it toward other
programs for low-income students. Of that, about $7 million will go
to the district's secondary math and literacy programs, while about
$19 million will go toward intensive academic support programs.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's cuts came in four board votes, two of which were
unanimously approved. Board member David Tokofsky voted no on two
measures and Jose Huizar and Genethia Hayes voted against one
because, they said, the cuts would harm students.</TE>
<TE>   Huizar said the elimination of the $4.9 million in discretionary
funds will punish 170 schools that managed to finish with a surplus
last year.</TE>
<TE>   "That $4.9 million is supposed to supplement those schools in
high-poverty areas," he said. "Some of those schools already need
those funds. It is unjust to cut from low-income schools."</TE>
<TE>   But Romer said that was the least disruptive choice.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not easy to make budget cuts," Romer said. "But I think one
of the traditional ways to go about it is [to look at] who has money
they are not yet using or not going to use," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The cuts come in response to higher-than-expected spending as well
as to state budget cuts.</TE>
<TE>   January's reductions included $25 million in unspent funds for
utilities, insurance and legal fees; $15 million for district office
supplies; and $7 million for a counseling program that will instead
be funded by Medi-Cal.</TE>

<HD>Garvey Is Accused of False Claims</HD>
<DH>Trial: Former Dodger is being sued by FTC for endorsing
weight-loss products in infomercials.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former baseball star Steve Garvey made "flagrantly false and
deceptive" claims when he touted a weight-loss product that promised
dieters they could eat all the fatty foods they desired, a government
attorney charged in Los Angeles federal court Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Trade Commission is suing the former Dodger for the
$1.1 million he made from endorsing the Enforma weight-loss system on
two widely disseminated infomercials in 1999 and 2000. The FTC
contends that Garvey should be held accountable because he endorsed
the Enforma system.</LD>
<LD>   On the opening day of the non-jury trial, FTC lawyer David P.
Frankel quoted Garvey as telling viewers in one infomercial:</LD>
<TE>   "Look at all these delicious supposedly forbidden foods--barbecued
chicken and ribs, buttered biscuits. Foods you can eat when you crave
them, without guilt, without worry, and it's all because of a few
little capsules."</TE>
<TE>   Frankel told U.S. District Judge Gary A. Feess, "Any reasonable
person stating these claims should have known they were fantastic."</TE>
<TE>   The Enforma system consists of two dietary supplements: a product
called Fat Trapper, which purportedly prevents the absorption of
dietary fat; and Exercise in a Bottle, which is supposed to increase
the body's capacity to burn fat.</TE>
<TE>   Enforma Natural Products Inc., the Woodland Hills-based company
that markets the products, settled a deceptive advertising lawsuit
with the FTC two years ago. Without admitting wrongdoing, the company
agreed to pay the government $10 million and promised to refrain from
making any deceptive weight-loss claims.</TE>
<TE>   Garvey did not attend Tuesday's court session.</TE>
<TE>   Feess made clear that his decision would hinge not on whether Fat
Trapper and Exercise in a Bottle were effective, but whether Garvey
made any serious effort to substantiate his claims.</TE>
<TE>   Harvey I. Saferstein, one of Garvey's lawyers, protested to Feess
that it is unfair to "tell spokespeople for products that they have
to be scientists as well."</TE>
<TE>   Saferstein contended that such a requirement would have a chilling
effect on commercial free speech.</TE>
<TE>   Someone who persuades others to "part with their money" better be
careful about what they say, Feess retorted.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Edward F. Glynn Jr. told the judge that Garvey
substantiated the products' efficacy by trying them himself. So did
Garvey's wife, Candace, owner of Garvey Management Group, a
co-defendant in the FTC lawsuit, Glynn said.</TE>
<TE>   Dietary supplements are not subject to the same efficacy standards
as pharmaceutical drugs. They can be banned only if they are found to
be dangerous. There has been no such finding with the Enforma
products. Supplement makers are, however, prohibited from making
false claims.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Grey, Enforma's chief executive, said in a telephone
interview that his company has sold more than 7 million bottles of
the supplements since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "Our product is backed by years of scientific research," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Enforma no longer employs Garvey to promote its products.</TE>

said about him. Love you, Paul," one said.</TE>
<TE>   But their words were overshadowed by the tears and testimony of
his victims. Mary Anne Seifried met Kreutzer in 1968 at a Saturday
folk dance class he organized at Holy Redeemer Catholic Church in
Montrose.</TE>
<TE>   In court, Seifried, who agreed to the publication of her name,
said she believes that Kreutzer abused more girls over the years than
authorities have identified.</TE>
<TE>   She said she was concerned about two victims, sisters who came to
the United States from Vietnam with their family in 1975.</TE>
<TE>   They met Kreutzer through Holy Redeemer Church and moved into his
home to learn to speak English. They testified that they took turns
sleeping in the bed of the man they called "Daddy."</TE>
<TE>   After the sentencing, Seifried hugged one of the Vietnamese women
who sat alone in the back of the courtroom crying.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Andrea Thompson called this
a case about a teacher's breach of trust, a theme that resonated
throughout the hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the victims said Kreutzer befriended their unsuspecting
parents to gain unlimited access to their young daughters.</TE>
<TE>   "He took advantage of the trust he had built," Thompson said.</TE>
<TE>   The third of the three sisters said her parents trusted Kreutzer
with her and her siblings.</TE>
<TE>   "We were supposed to trust our elders," she told the judge. "How
am I supposed to teach my daughter to trust her elders?"</TE>

<LD>This morning, the day after the primary, Gregory Salcido will be back
at El Rancho High, teaching his 8 o'clock history class.</LD>
<LD>   By now he will know, and his students will, too, that he won't be
leaving in January to go to Washington, D.C., won't be raising his
hand and swearing to preserve, protect and defend, so help him God.</LD>
<LD>   I am not inviting "Dewey Defeats Truman" headlines by writing this
before the polls closed on Tuesday. But we're realists here, and a
realist knows that Grace Napolitano, the Democrat running for her
third term in the 38th Congressional District, is not likely to be
knocked out by a young Pico Rivera City Council member, however smart
and thoughtful he is--and Salcido is unquestionably those
things--because on the hard-to-do list, unseating a member of
Congress ranks up there with un-haloing a canonized saint (any
resemblance purely unintentional).</LD>
<TE>   So why would Salcido even try?</TE>
<TE>   To figure it out, I started election day with him. I followed him
the three blocks from home to the high school he once attended, where
he now teaches. Around him, kids too young to vote slogged to class
in "Salcido for Congress" T-shirts. One puffed out his chest as
Salcido passed him on his way into the polling place in the school
library, to cast his vote for himself.</TE>
<TE>   Salcido is 33 years old, a Pico Rivera kid since before he was old
enough to pronounce it. His dad used to read five papers a day, but
back then Salcido tossed aside everything but the sports page. It was
only when he went to Whittier College--a big deal for a kid whose dad
kept saying, "You gotta go to college, don't work with your hands
like me"--that the lights came on. News. Politics. History. The
world. He decided to teach. His students have gone on to Berkeley,
Princeton, Notre Dame; their pictures are on his campaign Web site.
"I'm in the business of turning the lights on in those kids' heads
the way that mine was."</TE>
<TE>   And if you care to look at it that way, public office is just
teaching in a bigger classroom.</TE>
<TE>   There are Grace Napolitano's lawn signs, orange and flourishing
like California poppies, but turn down Salcido's street and there are
his signs, demure blue and white. His only other election was in
1999, for City Council, and in a couple of weeks he'll take his turn
as mayor. Wal-Mart and Starbucks will soon open their doors in Pico
believe-it-or-not Rivera, and that tickles him because he wants his
town to be "as American as Scranton, Pa.--anything anyone expects
there, is what should be accessible here." But Congress, after three
brief years on the City Council? The teacher of American history
wants to wade into America's concerns--living wage, health care,
"issues that really stir my passion."</TE>
<TE>   He had a sure-thing chance to climb the Sacramento ladder when
some power brokers came to him about running for Assembly, but he
told them that's not for him. You get elected, and right away you
begin angling for something bigger, and you wind up no different from
the rest of them.</TE>
<TE>   So it was Congress for Salcido, and a bargain-basement $30,000
campaign with just one mailer, and a campaign about him, not about
Napolitano, because cynicism starts when campaigns are "so
cutthroat.... You should talk about what you bring to the table."</TE>
<TE>   The Salcido Strategy for March 2002 was to do well in Pico Rivera
and, as for everywhere else, Pomona to Santa Fe Springs, "just hang
in there. I don't need to win; I just need to hang in there."</TE>
<TE>   Salcido is a patient man. He plans. He and his wife were engaged
for eight years. "I understand the concept of investment. This is an
investment."</TE>
<TE>   His is only 33, and Primary 2004--it's only a couple of
high-school graduations away.</TE>
<TE>   Each classroom bears the mark of its teacher. Salcido's has
newsmagazine covers taped to the 50-year-old walls. So is the Bill of
Rights, which came up in class Tuesday because Imperial Showgirls
came up at the City Council meeting the night before--a big set-to
over the strip club that Pico Rivera doesn't want but a judge said it
must allow.</TE>
<TE>   Of course Salcido's against it--"I mean, who says, 'Strip clubs,
yeah!' But I will back up their right to exist as long as they go
through the proper permit process. And I have a right not to go, and
a right to protest."</TE>
<TE>   And that's the incredible thing about America, he tells the kids.</TE>
<TE>   "They put this stuff together--these guys in funny wigs and funny
pants and buckles on their shoes. They weren't thinking about a strip
club in Pico Rivera--I don't think they were--but 200-some years
later the judge says they can do this, because of this Constitution.
It's amazing how it all works. I'm amazed. My job is to see that you
guys get amazed by it."</TE>

<HD>It's No Act for Erstad to Turn White as Ghost</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TEMPE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>There is nothing wrong with your television set. Yes, Darin Erstad
warns you, he really is that pale.</LD>
<LD>   Erstad is a star in one of the Angels' new television commercials,
coming soon to Southern California. In the ad, part of a humorous
campaign designed to showcase the players, Erstad is shown hustling
to a Laundromat between games of a doubleheader, rushing to take off
his dirty uniform and toss it into the washing machine.</LD>
<LD>   "They had me strip down to my sliding shorts," Erstad said.
"There's a lot of my body showing. I don't have much of a tan [being]
from North Dakota."</LD>
<TE>   In another spot, Tim Salmon, Troy Glaus and Garret Anderson help a
kid struggling to hit off a tee. A third ad highlights the starting
rotation, with Manager Mike Scioscia playing in a card game and
saying, "I've got five aces."</TE>
<TE>   The campaign also includes a spot filmed in English and Spanish,
with Bengie Molina helping a child swing away and break open a pinata
and Benji Gil collecting the falling candy.</TE>
<TE>   Erstad said the Angels need not worry about him abandoning
baseball for a career in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "I debuted my acting career and retired all in one day," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For the first time in Jeff DaVanon's eight-year pro career, he
came to spring training with a chance to win a major league job. That
chance is fading with each passing day, however, since DaVanon has
been unable to play. The outfielder strained his left hamstring in
December, while playing winter ball in the Dominican Republic, and
the injury has been slow to heal.</TE>
<TE>   "I just can't think about it, or it would drive me crazy," DaVanon
said.</TE>
<TE>   DaVanon was expected to compete with Clay Bellinger and Jose
Nieves for a bench job. The Angels are uncertain when DaVanon will be
able to play, but for now Scioscia insists it is too soon to rule out
his chances of making the team.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we're at that point yet," Scioscia said. "It will
become a concern if it lingers."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels fielded what could be their opening day lineup--in
2003--for Tuesday's 6-3 Cactus League victory over the San Francisco
Giants. Alfredo Amezaga, whose speed and defense dazzle the Angels,
played shortstop, with David Eckstein moving to second.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels plan to start the season with Eckstein at shortstop and
Adam Kennedy at second, but if Amezaga, 24, forces the issue by
hitting well at triple A--he hit .250 there last year--the team might
not wait until next year to promote him.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Schoeneweis, whose sinkerball produces plenty of ground
balls, would become a better pitcher with Amezaga at shortstop.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not pinning our hopes to win on Alfredo Amezaga having to
step up and be this superstar shortstop," Scioscia said. "He's going
to step up on his own time."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Schoeneweis pitched two scoreless innings, but Aaron Sele,
scheduled to throw two innings and 30 pitches, threw 43 pitches
before the Angels removed him with one out in the second inning. He
faced 10 batters, giving up two runs, two walks and four hits....
With his spot in the starting rotation secure, Schoeneweis vowed to
use the spring to master a changeup he sometimes would not throw last
season. "I have to prove I'm a much better pitcher than what I've
shown," he said, "and do those things I need to do to not be a .500
pitcher with a 5.00 [earned-run average] ERA for the rest of my
career."</TE>

<HD>NBC Finds New Arena</HD>
<DH>Pro football: Network and Arena Football League reach
agreement to televise games beginning in 2003.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NBC, less than a year removed from its XFL fiasco, is ready to get
back into pro football.</LD>
<LD>   The network announced Tuesday that it has formed a revenue-sharing
partnership with the Arena Football League to begin televising indoor
games on Sundays in the spring of 2003.</LD>
<LD>   The deal could provide a major boost to the league, which folded
four teams after last season and has 16 ready to begin play when the
league opens its 16th season next month, one of them the Los Angeles
Avengers. The league hopes to have 20 teams for the 2003 season, 23
by 2004.</LD>
<TE>   Most televised arena league games have appeared on the National
Network and ESPN2, with a few on ESPN and ABC. This is the first
big-time network contract for the league.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tremendous," said Avenger owner Casey Wasserman, chairman of
the league's television and properties committee. "We've always said,
and our research shows, that 30% of the people out there know what
arena football is, and, of that 30%, 90% love it. Our challenge has
always been to grow that 30%, and there's no better way to do that
than network TV."</TE>
<TE>   Wasserman helped broker the deal, which does not involve rights
fees but allows the league and network to share revenues. It's a
two-year deal, but NBC has the right to extend it indefinitely.</TE>
<TE>   NBC, which lost the NFL in 1998, is in the final year of its
contract with the NBA. Pro basketball moves to ABC and ESPN next
season. Left in Tthe NBC Sports lineup are the Olympics, through
2008; NASCAR stock car racing, Notre Dame football, and various golf
and tennis tournaments.</TE>
<TE>   To help fill the winter-spring schedule, arena football will start
its season two months earlier than it has, in February, beginning
next year. Besides 15 regular-season games, NBC will televise the
league's entire postseason schedule, and the Arena Bowl, the
championship game. The network will televise four regional games each
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "NBC is the ultimate fan builder, and I believe we have some
passionate people who believe what we believe," AFL Commissioner
David Baker said.</TE>
<TE>   Dick Ebersol, chairman of NBC Sports, said the deal with the arena
league is far less risky than was the XFL, a joint venture between
the World Wrestling Federation and NBC that fizzled and folded after
one season.</TE>
<TE>   "Arena football is a completely developed, legitimate sport,"
Ebersol said. "We don't have to worry about operating teams, finding
players, the rules and regulations of the game. They're all there.
They're there with 16 years of terrific execution."</TE>
<TE>   WWF Chairman Vince McMahon declined to comment on the NBC-AFL
venture, other than to say: "I wish NBC and arena football my best."</TE>
<TE>   The XFL was heavily promoted, and its debut drew a surprisingly
large TV audience. But its ratings plummeted once viewers discovered
it was little more than traditional football with watered-down
talent. Ebersol, citing the popularity of off-beat extreme sports at
the Olympics, said arena football is an entirely different game, one
that will be compelling even to an audience coming off the NFL
season.</TE>
<TE>   "This is football, but it's a truly different extension of
football," he said. "They're not going to be watching the same game
as they are August through the Super Bowl.... You'll have a
meaningful option here."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the XFL, which encouraged trash talking and had cameras in
the cheerleaders' locker rooms, the AFL plans to market its football.</TE>
<TE>   "This is about the sport," Wasserman said. "They're going to
provide access, but they aren't going to be gratuitous about it.
Players will be miked, coaches will be miked, all that stuff is good.
[But] this is about football."</TE>
<TE>   Later this month, NFL owners will vote on whether to exercise
their option to buy 49.9% of the league.  NFL owners Jerry Jones of
the Dallas Cowboys and William Clay Ford of the Detroit Lions also
own AFL teams, and several other NFL owners are planning to join the
AFL.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Former NBA star Charles Barkley is accusing Augusta National Golf
Club of "blatant racism," saying the reason behind recent changes to
the course was to keep Tiger Woods from winning the Masters.</LD>
<LD>   "Jack Nicklaus won the Masters six times, and he was hitting it
past everybody else, and they never made a change," Barkley said in
this week's issue of Sports Illustrated. "What they're doing to Tiger
is blatant racism."</LD>
<LD>   Augusta National spokesman Glenn Greenspan said the club had no
comment.</LD>
<TE>   Recent renovations, which include nearly 300 additional yards,
were announced by chairman Hootie Johnson the day before last year's
Masters began.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Joe Kerrigan was fired Tuesday as manager of the Boston Red Sox and
replaced on an interim basis by third-base coach Mike Cubbage.</LD>
<LD>   It was the second major personnel move made by the Red Sox since
John Henry's ownership group bought the team Feb. 27.</LD>
<LD>   A day after the sale, Dan Duquette was fired as general manager
and replaced on an interim basis by Mike Port, a former Angel general
manager.</LD>
<TE>   "This kind of decision is always difficult to make," Port said.
"We have the utmost respect for Joe, and admire his work ethic and
his achievements as a pitching coach."</TE>
<TE>   Duquette had promoted Kerrigan late last season after he fired
Jimy Williams on Aug. 16.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland Indian outfielder Alex Escobar is out for the season
after tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during
an exhibition game Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Escobar, the key player in the trade that sent All-Star Roberto
Alomar to the New York Mets, will undergo reconstructive surgery.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rick Ankiel will sit out his next scheduled spring training start
for St. Louis because of tightness in his left elbow.... Colorado
will be without right-hander Scott Elarton for at least several days
because of inflammation and tendinitis in his rotator cuff. Elarton
is a candidate for the No. 5 spot in the rotation.... Colorado
Manager Buddy Bell returned to the team, five days after leaving
spring training for follow-up tests on the back surgery he underwent
Dec. 11. Bell has been experiencing pain in his left leg. Tests in
Denver revealed he had scar tissue remaining from the disk surgery,
and the tissue was impinging on a nerve.</TE>

<LD>THE SHOT BLOCKER</LD>
<LD>   STANFORD CENTER CURTIS BORCHARDT</LD>
<LD>   The latest in a long line of Stanford trees clogging the lane,
Borchardt took shot-blocking to a new level for the Cardinal.</LD>
<TE>   With 77 blocks (2.9 a game), the oft-injured junior has stayed
healthy enough to obliterate Tim Young's five-year-old school record
of 50.</TE>
<TE>   "I take a lot of pride in blocking shots because I think it
changes the flow of the game," Borchardt said. "Especially if teams
are penetrating on you and getting a lot of easier baskets.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm the ultimate help defender because I can slide over and go
after and change their shot."</TE>
<TE>   Purdue and Michigan State were the guests of honor at his block
party this season; Borchardt blocked six shots against each team,
tying his personal record set as a freshman against Cal State
Bakersfield.</TE>
<TE>   He had at least three blocks in 14 games and, despite missing 28
games his first two seasons because of injuries, his 138 career
blocks rank second on the Cardinal all-time list.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, standing 7 feet and being somewhat athletic also helps.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of it is anticipation, but having long arms and being able
to anticipate what the other guy's going to do helps a lot too,"
Borchardt said.</TE>
<TE>   THE SCORER</TE>
<TE>   STANFORD FORWARD CASEY JACOBSEN</TE>
<TE>   The ways and means by which Jacobson scores are prettier than the
frosted tips of his hair. He can take defenders off the dribble,
drive to the basket and get to the free-throw line or stop and shoot
from outside.</TE>
<TE>   "From an early age," Jacobsen said, "scoring in basketball games
has always been so much fun. And now, I think, my teammates really
need me to put the ball in the hoop.</TE>
<TE>   "Scoring is important to me, but I definitely would trade some of
the points for a win."</TE>
<TE>   He has scored at a league-leading 22.2 average overall, 23.1 in
Pacific 10 games.</TE>
<TE>   After going for a career-high 49 points in a 90-81 victory against
Arizona State on Jan. 31, Jacobsen scored 41 seven days later in a
90-87 overtime victory against eventual conference champion Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobsen, from Glendora, said a scorer is not necessarily born but
can be created.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't born with amazing talent," Jacobsen said. "But I have
some talent and with work and work and work and with the little
talent I do have, I have a desire to make shots."</TE>
<TE>   THE REBOUNDER</TE>
<TE>   USC FORWARD SAM CLANCY</TE>
<TE>   Clancy never thought much about grabbing rebounds ... until NBA
scouts told him last summer at a pre-draft camp that he needed to
work on that aspect of his game if he wanted to succeed at the next
level.</TE>
<TE>   "This year I really made an effort to get more rebounds," Clancy
said. "Before I'd just let the ball bounce around and not really care
about it. I'd think, 'Who cares about rebounds?' Obviously, some
people do."</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-7, 250-pound Clancy cared enough to average a
career-best 9.8 rebounds, 2.3 better than last season's figure.</TE>
<TE>   The surge on the boards has left Clancy, who equaled his
single-game high of 14 rebounds three times this season, 25 rebounds
away from taking over the No. 2 spot on the Trojans' all-time list.</TE>
<TE>   Already an accomplished scorer, Clancy's newfound affection for
rebounding enabled him to rack up a conference-best 17 double-doubles
this season, and his late-season run of 11 consecutive double-doubles
was a national best and the most at USC since Ron Riley had 13 in a
row in 1970-71.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard constantly fighting around your guy [for a rebound],"
Clancy said. "It's not so much skill. It's just who wants it more."</TE>
<TE>   THE SHOOTER</TE>
<TE>   UCLA FORWARD JASON KAPONO</TE>
<TE>   He has been knocked for everything from being slow to having bad
taste in headwear to being unable to create his shot.</TE>
<TE>   But set a screen for the Bruin sharpshooter or let him fire a
three-point shot from the wing to finish a fastbreak and, when he's
on, there's not a more dangerous long-range threat in the Pac-10.</TE>
<TE>   "If you start off well, then you keep shooting it," Kapono said.
"If you don't start off well, then you keep shooting it. The only way
to break out of a slump is to shoot out of it. You've got to keep
shooting it or you have no chance of making any."</TE>
<TE>   Kapono has 248 career three-point baskets, more than any shooter
in UCLA history, having passed Toby Bailey (171) and Tracy Murray
(197) this season.</TE>
<TE>   He is within 76 of passing Arizona State's Stevin Smith as the
Pac-10's all-time leader. But Kapono's yearly flirtation with the NBA
draft is drawing near.</TE>
<TE>   But his three-point shooting percentage in conference games has
gotten worse through the years. He shot 49.5% (52 for 105) as a
freshman, 43.2% (41 for 95) as a sophomore and 43.0% (49 for 114)
this season.</TE>
<TE>   THE FREE-THROW SHOOTER</TE>
<TE>   ARIZONA GUARD SALIM STOUDAMIRE</TE>
<TE>   Stoudamire said he's not a superstitious sort, so he was more than
willing to talk about his charmed life on the line.</TE>
<TE>   "Every point counts, right?" he said. "So I try to focus on every
shot. That's all."</TE>
<TE>   He has been focused enough to have made 83 of his 89 free throws,
93.3%. . In league games, the freshman missed only four free throws,
going 68 for 72, 94.4%, the third-best percentage in Pac-10 history.</TE>
<TE>   Only the 100% (28 of 28) UCLA's Gary Cunningham made in 1959-60
and the 95% (95 of 100) UCLA's Rod Foster made in 1981-82 are better.</TE>
<TE>   Stoudamire, a cousin of former Arizona standout and current
Portland Trail Blazer point guard Damon Stoudamire, said he has
always been a decent free-throw shooter in the 80% range.</TE>
<TE>   "I try to extend myself all the way through [on the shot]," he
said. "I don't expect to make every shot, so I don't put any pressure
on myself."</TE>
<TE>   THE BALL HANDLER</TE>
<TE>   OREGON GUARD LUKE RIDNOUR</TE>
<TE>   The flashy yet consistent Ridnour has been compared to John
Stockton of the Utah Jazz and Jason Williams of the Memphis
Grizzlies. But the Oregon point guard prefers to be compared to the
late Pete Maravich of Louisiana State.</TE>
<TE>   "I think my game has a little flair like his did," Ridnour said.
"I like that I can do a lot of things with the ball and still be in
control of the game. When you make a play, you get the crowd
involved."</TE>
<TE>   A hoops junkie, Ridnour carried a basketball with him everywhere
he went growing up, even on a date. His whip-like passes around the
perimeter and his lightning-quick bounce passes in traffic draw the
most oohs and ahhs.</TE>
<TE>   But it's his assist-to-turnover ratio that has the Oregon coaches
smiling and letting go of the reins.</TE>
<TE>   Ridnour's overall ratio of 1.88 was second in the league, as was
his 2.00 ratio in league games.</TE>
<TE>   And when he's not dazzling opponents with his skills and
unselfishness, he's scoring. Ridnour is averaging 15.1 points a game.</TE>
<TE>   THE PASSER</TE>
<TE>   ARIZONA FORWARD LUKE WALTON</TE>
<TE>   Depleted by NBA draft defections, the Wildcats have turned to
Walton, who is on track to become the first frontcourt player to lead
the Pac-10 in assists since the league began tracking the stat in
1974-75.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-8, 241-pound forward, who had started only six of the 36
games he played as a sophomore, is averaging 6.44 assists. This after
starting the season with a 3.51 career average.</TE>
<TE>   Walton posted the league's only triple-double this season--27
points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists in a 97-80 rout of USC in Tucson
on Jan. 17.</TE>

<HD>Kennedy Steps Down as Coach at DePaul</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After five seasons, Pat Kennedy has resigned as coach of the DePaul
Blue Demons.</LD>
<LD>   "If you finally get to the point where the passion and drive is
not there, it might be best to just step away," Kennedy said Tuesday.
"I thought the timing was right. How do you know the timing is right?
I don't know. It just felt right."</LD>
<LD>   Kennedy's departure follows a 9-19 season. The Blue Devils won
only two Conference USA games and failed to qualify for the
conference tournament.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bradley fired Coach Jim Molinari after the team completed a 9-20
season, its worst since his first year at the school in 1991-92.
Molinari had a 174-152 record in 11 seasons at Bradley, including one
NCAA tournament berth and five National Invitation Tournament
appearances.... Jeff Capel, a former Duke standout, was hired as
coach at Virginia Commonwealth, becoming the youngest Division I
coach in the nation at age 27. He replaces Mack McCarthy, who
resigned after the Rams lost to North Carolina Wilmington on Monday
in the championship game of the Colonial Athletic Assn. tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Arkansas said it will respond to Nolan Richardson's letter seeking
an explanation of why he won't coach the team next season. Since
Chancellor John White announced Friday that Richardson was fired,
Arkansas has offered no explanation beyond citing a
no-excuses-necessary clause under the "Termination at Convenience of
the University" section of Richardson's seven-year,
$1.03-million-a-year contract.... Eastern Washington Coach Ray
Giacoletti has taken himself out of contention for the job at Long
Beach State.... Liberty Coach Mel Hankinson was fired after a 5-25
season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Washington State women's Coach Jenny Przekwas was fired after the
team closed with 24 consecutive losses.... Lamar will not extend the
contract of women's Coach DeAnn Craft.... Maryland women's Coach
Chris Weller retired.... Joanie O'Brien will not return as women's
coach at Massachusetts after a 12-18 season, her 11th at the
school.... Utah State, which hasn't fielded a women's team since
1987, will reintroduce it as a scholarship sport in the 2003-04
season.</TE>

<HD>Knight Is Still the Chairman of the Boors</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mal Florence</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Texas Tech Coach Bob Knight's chair almost gave way beneath him
during a news conference Monday, he quickly tossed it aside.</LD>
<LD>   "That's the furthest [it's farthest, Bob] I've thrown a chair in a
long time," Knight quipped, alluding to an infamous chair-tossing
incident in 1985 when he was Indiana's coach.</LD>
<LD>   Knight threw a plastic chair across the court after he was called
for a technical foul against Purdue. He let the chair go as a Purdue
player stepped to the line to shoot the technical. Knight was ejected
from the game.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More Knight: John Feinstein, the author of "A Season on the
Brink," a best-selling book on Knight, is not pleased with
television's version, which will be shown on ESPN and ESPN2 on
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "They turned it into a cartoon," he told Ed Sherman of the Chicago
Tribune.</TE>
<TE>   Wrote Sherman: "Feinstein, though, did give credit to Brian
Dennehy for his portrayal of Knight. Not surprisingly, the veteran
actor gives a riveting performance.</TE>
<TE>   "Dennehy portrays Knight in full throat. He doesn't look or sound
like the former Indiana coach, but he does capture his intensity and
rage."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the NBA record for shooting percentage in a
season?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Loyalty: Jon Saraceno in USA Today: "New Washington Redskin Coach
Steve Spurrier traded for his former college quarterback at Florida,
Danny Wuerffel. Who does Coach Visor think the Redskins are opening
against, Louisiana Monroe?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The demise of Dennis: Mike Bianchi in the Orlando Sentinel:
"Dennis Miller has been booted out of the 'Monday Night Football'
booth. Poor Dennis. He must feel as if he's been thrown off Hadrian's
Wall, had his head cut off by the Sword of Damocles, then been sent
to a 17th century Benedictine monastery."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Not surprising: From comedy writer Earl Hochman: "According to the
National Center on Addiction and Substance abuse at Columbia
University, young people ages 12-20 accounted for 25% of all
alcoholic beverages consumed in the U.S., with the remaining 75%
being consumed by Oakland Raider fans."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1987, UCLA defeated Arizona State,
99-83, in the Pacific 10 basketball tournament. The Bruins
established a tournament record for most points scored in a game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Wilt Chamberlain of the Lakers, 72.7% in 1972-73.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: The Associated Press reports that the basketball
coach known for his sticky defense is promoting his own sticky food.</TE>
<TE>   Connecticut Coach Jim Calhoun and his family launched what they
hope will become a line of fancy-food labels, Coach's Pride. Leading
off is Caramel Nut Clusters, which hit the shelves Monday at grocery
stores in Connecticut. Other products will follow, with an emphasis
on "heart-healthy" foods.</TE>
<TE>   A portion of each sale will go to the Connecticut Children's
Medical Center for its work in pediatric cardiac care.</TE>
<TE>   Calhoun said he hopes his company will help many other businesses
throughout the state, but the charity donations are the most
important to him.</TE>

<HD>Penn Gives the Ivy a Three-Way Tie</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Now, the Ivy League has a postseason tournament.</LD>
<LD>   Andrew Toole scored 19 points and Ugonna Onyekwe scored 16, and
Pennsylvania defeated Princeton, 64-48, Tuesday night at Philadelphia
to finish in a three-way tie with the Tigers and Yale for first place
in the Ivy League.</LD>
<LD>   Princeton (16-10, 11-3) plays Yale (19-9, 11-3) at The Palestra on
Thursday. The winner faces Penn (24-6, 11-3) at Lafayette on Saturday
for an automatic berth into the NCAA tournament.</LD>
<TE>   "It's great for the league," Penn Coach Fran Dunphy said. "It's
terrific for Yale and Princeton to have another opportunity. I'm
anxious to see the game on Thursday. We live for another day."</TE>
<TE>   Penn won the three-team tiebreaker because of its 3-1 record
against Yale and Princeton.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first time in the conference's 46-year history that
three teams finished in a tie for first. Either Penn or Princeton has
won at least a piece of the league title 14 consecutive seasons and
31 of the last 33.</TE>
<TE>   Ahmed El-Nokali scored 18 and Will Venable added 10 for Princeton.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely a bad loss, but we'll be back," El-Nokali said.</TE>
<TE>   OTHER TOURNAMENTS</TE>
<TE>   Horizon--Cedrick Banks made a turnaround jump shot with four
seconds left in overtime, giving Illinois Chicago a 76-75 victory
against Loyola of Chicago in the championship game of the Horizon
tournament at Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   The Flames (20-13) earned Horizon's automatic berth in the NCAA
tournament. They'll be making their second tournament appearance.</TE>

<LD>If Coach Alvin Gentry's recent prediction that it will take at least
45 victories to make the playoffs is correct, the Clippers, a .500
team through 60 games, must go 15-7 or better in their final 22
games. Can it be done?</LD>
<LD>   "We better believe we can," he said. "The one thing we did last
year, and we've got to concentrate on doing again this year, is
making sure we play our best basketball in March and April."</LD>
<LD>   The Clippers defeated the Golden State Warriors on Saturday, so
they are undefeated in March.</LD>
<TE>   However, they begin a four-game trip tonight against the Bucks at
Milwaukee and will be without at least two key players for the rest
of the regular season. Small forward Corey Maggette, who has an
injured right hand, and backup point guard Keyon Dooling (sprained
left ankle) are not expected to play again.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, their most versatile player, Lamar Odom, probably
won't play for at least another month because of a sprained right
wrist and ankle. Both were still in casts as of Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers (30-30) were ninth in the Western Conference before
Tuesday's games, three games behind the Seattle SuperSonics, who
occupy the eighth and final playoff spot.</TE>
<TE>   Gentry remains hopeful.</TE>
<TE>   "It's come down to the fact that there's no magic, no secret to
it," he said. "We've got to win some games now. It doesn't matter
where they are played. There's a team ahead of us and we've got to
catch it. There's also a team right behind us [Phoenix].</TE>
<TE>   "I like our position, our predicament. We have something tangible
to play for. Our goal from Day 1 has been to make the playoffs. It's
still in sight."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shooting guard Eric Piatkowski sat out Monday's practice because
of what Gentry called "a little tweak" in a groin muscle. Piatkowski
is expected to play tonight. He was injured during the Clippers'
victory Saturday over the Warriors.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Michael Jordan, who had knee surgery last Wednesday, almost
certainly will not play against the Clippers when the Washington
Wizards visit Staples Center on March 13. Coach Doug Collins said
Tuesday it would be "stretching it" for Jordan to play again before
the Wizards return from their six-game West Coast trip on March 21.</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>
<TE>   at Milwaukee, 5 PST</TE>
<TE>   Site--Bradley Center.</TE>
<TE>   Radio--KXTA (1150).</TE>
<TE>   Records--Clippers 30-30, Bucks 34-25.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Bucks--1-0.</TE>
<TE>   Update--Tremaine Fowlkes signed a second 10-day contract Tuesday.
The Clippers begin their final lengthy trip of the season against the
Bucks, who lost to the Knicks, 102-89, Tuesday in New York. A victory
would give the Clippers their first series sweep of the Bucks since
1996-97. They have lost three in a row in Milwaukee, however. The
Clippers' trip continues Friday at Chicago, a homecoming for Elton
Brand, who played his first two seasons with the Bulls. The Clippers
acquired Brand last summer and he's become their leading scorer and
rebounder, averaging 18.7 points and 11.8 rebounds.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VERO BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Eager to "finally get into some games," Dodger right fielder Shawn
Green said Tuesday that his left shoulder has improved and he plans
to play this weekend.</LD>
<LD>   Green, sidelined in the club's first six exhibitions because of
tendinitis in his throwing shoulder, said he could be in the starting
lineup as early as Friday against the Atlanta Braves at Dodgertown.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not going to throw out anybody right now, but I'll be happy
as long as I can hit the cutoff man and get some at-bats," the Gold
Glove outfielder said. Manager Jim Tracy has proceeded cautiously
with the club's top everyday player, monitoring Green's throwing
program. Green said he doesn't need many at-bats to be ready for
opening day but that he wants to start his regular routine as soon as
possible. "I'm very antsy," he said. "I want to win and I want to go
to the postseason really, really bad. The longer you play without it,
the more you yearn for it. I'm at the point where I feel like we're
on the threshold; it's just a matter of us staying healthy.</LD>
<TE>   "The organization has a good focus and that's something that's
very encouraging. It has taken a couple of years to get the focus to
where it needs to be. Finally, it's on pitching and defense. In the
past, everyone said it was on pitching and defense, but it wasn't. It
is now."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It's only spring training, so left-hander Omar Daal is not
concerned about his shaky performance in two starts.</TE>
<TE>   After giving up nine hits and five runs in 11/3 innings during a
6-2 exhibition loss to the Houston Astros last Friday, Daal got
pounded for six hits and two runs in three innings in Tuesday's 4-4,
10-inning tie with the St. Louis Cardinals at Holman Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Daal, who gave up consecutive solo home runs to Placido Polanco
and Eduardo Perez in an 18-pitch first inning, said he's right on
schedule.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt real good today," he said. "It was much better than my
last time, when I was overthrowing and leaving the ball up too much
[in the strike zone]."</TE>
<TE>   Daal was 13-7 with a 4.46 earned-run average in 32 starts for the
Philadelphia Phillies last season, but had a 6.02 earned-run average
in 15 starts from June 15 through Sept. 9. The Dodgers hope to trade
Daal, whom they acquired for two pitching prospects Nov. 9, because
they have seven starting pitchers for five rotation spots.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Second baseman Mark Grudzielanek, sidelined because of a right
hamstring injury that has slowed him since last season, will undergo
a second MRI exam today.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers hope to determine whether Grudzielanek, who has not
played in exhibition games, also has suffered a hip or back injury
that might be slowing his recovery. "I suffered a little setback the
other day, so I'm not really sure what's going on," Grudzielanek
said. "There's really no timetable on anything right now."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Longtime broadcaster Ross Porter, who sat out the rest of the
season after undergoing sinus surgeries in late August, is back in
top form.</TE>
<TE>   "I rested for all of September and part of October, then I took a
couple of trips after that," said Porter, beginning his 26th season
with the club. "In November, I started playing golf, and that was the
key to me. It showed me that I had the endurance [needed to return to
work]."</TE>

<HD>Ducks Trade McInnis</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Mighty Ducks traded right wing Marty McInnis to the Boston Bruins
on Tuesday for a third-round pick in the June draft.</LD>
<LD>   The Ducks, who were "close" to being a playoff contender,
according to General Manager Pierre Gauthier, seem to have taken a
step back from that alleged status with Tuesday's trade. They gave up
a veteran, who had struggled this season, for a draft pick.</LD>
<LD>   McInnis has nine goals, and only two in the last 30 games.</LD>
<TE>   "We're going to make changes and you start to look where to make
the changes," Gauthier said. "We have a lot younger players who are
keepers. Marty has been good for us. Lately we have not been getting
a lot for our money."</TE>
<TE>   That being the criteria, there may be a lot of changes during the
off-season for the Ducks, some possibly off the ice. The Ducks have
had 62 players and three head coaches in the last three-plus seasons.
Only five players remain from the 1998-99 team that made the
playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously I'm disappointed because I don't get to finish what I
started," McInnis said. "But I kind of like where I'm going so that
makes it a little easier. I look back on this as a positive
experience. We didn't win as many games as I would have liked, but
there are good people there."</TE>
<TE>   McInnis was a fixture in the Duck lineup since he was acquired
from Calgary during the 1998-99 season. He scored 18 goals that
season, helping the Ducks reach the playoffs. He had 10 goals in
1999-2000, but was slowed by a groin injury that required off-season
surgery. He had 20 goals last season.</TE>
<TE>   Gauthier saw McInnis as part of the Ducks' future last season when
he signed him to a three-year contract extension worth $5 million.</TE>
<TE>   But as this season began to unravel, McInnis, 31, and others s
fell out of favor. He was among 10 players Gauthier put on the
trading block in January.</TE>
<TE>   McInnis is going home; he was born in Hingham, Mass., and played
at Boston College. The Ducks recalled forward Timo Parssinen to
replace him..</TE>

<HD>Proposed New Tour Sets June Deadline</HD>
<DH>Golf: A TV deal with Fox reportedly hinges on as many as
two-thirds of 35 eligible players giving up PGA Tour cards.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Major Champions Tour has set an early June deadline for players
to give up their PGA Tour cards and commit to the proposed new tour.</LD>
<LD>   It is believed that as many as two-thirds of the 35 eligible
players must commit to the new tour to satisfy Fox's requirements to
go forward with a multi-year TV deal--and without it, there is no
tour.</LD>
<LD>   If the numbers are right, then it appears that Fox is ready to put
together a deal to televise at least six events on the new tour
designed for pros between 37 and 55 who have won at least one major
championship, sources say.</LD>
<TE>   Fox is the only network that has entertained the proposal from
independent television heavyweight Terry Jastrow and is also the only
network with airtime available on Saturday and Sunday, when golf
would follow the network's highly rated NASCAR telecasts.</TE>
<TE>   According to insiders, while Fox is prepared to make a run with
the proposed tour that would begin in 2003, it is not going to repeat
its mistake from the so-called World Tour in 1994, when it announced
its involvement even though no players had committed toit.</TE>
<TE>   "They feel they got a black eye before," said one source. "It's
going to come down to the players committing."</TE>
<TE>   Greg Norman, the leader on that failed tour proposal, is now one
of the headliners who would be invited to play on the planned tour.
The list of eligible players also includes Nick Faldo, Fred Couples,
Bernhard Langer, Mark O'Meara, Nick Price, Paul Azinger, Curtis
Strange, Mark Calcavecchia, Steve Elkington and Tom Lehman.</TE>
<TE>   So far, none of the players in the group of 35 has signed a
document giving up their PGA Tour card. Players will soon receive
letters notifying them that they must drop their PGA Tour cards if
they want to participate in the new tour. They must respond before
the U.S. Open in June.</TE>
<TE>   However, sources say that other players, including Hal Sutton,
Davis Love III and Fuzzy Zoeller are not interested. Sutton recently
agreed to serve a new term on the PGA Tour Policy Board and Zoeller
apparently believes his fortune can be found playing the Senior PGA
Tour. Both Norman and Faldo gave up their PGA Tour cards this year,
so their decision to join the new tour presumably would not be based
on factors other than what benefit it would be to remain on the PGA
Tour.  Couples, who turns 43 in October, has been the most outspoken
proponent of the new tour and believes it will happen.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a couple of little snags, sure, and we see them, but
we'll see," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The PGA Tour's response has consisted of a one-page statement from
Commissioner Tim Finchem, who seemed to point to the failed World
Tour as a reason for players to reject this new planned tour.</TE>
<TE>   "We agree with those players who have rejected these type of
proposals in favor of the long-term health of professional golf,"
Finchem said in the statement.</TE>
<TE>   Couples disagrees. "There are enticements," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed tour calls for each 72-hole event to have a minimum
purse of $2 million with a winner's share of $600,000. After the cut
to the low 20 and ties, 20th place would be worth $50,000. Sources
say that the proposed tour has scheduled meetings with
representatives from Pinehurst, Merion and East Lake Golf Club.</TE>

<LD>Laker announcer Chick Hearn will be going home from the hospital
today.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Herbert Huddleston of the Southern California Orthopedic
Institute, who performed hip surgery Feb. 19 on Hearn at Valley
Presbyterian Hospital in Van Nuys, said, "There has not been the
slightest problem or complication. His recovery could not have been
better or quicker."</LD>
<LD>   Huddleston said Hearn walked 200 feet without a walker or cane
Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   "He has been a model patient," the surgeon said. "He has a strong

<LD>What the Kings have been through this season is beyond compare.</LD>
<LD>   The deaths of scouts Ace Bailey and Mark Bavis in the terrorist
attacks on Sept. 11. The severe injuries Coach Andy Murray suffered
in an automobile accident on Feb. 15. Those incidents would test any
team.</LD>
<LD>   Yet the Kings begin their final 20 games four points behind
first-place San Jose in the Pacific Division.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a character team," King captain Mattias Norstrom said.
"Any of those things would have been good excuses not to perform on
the ice. That is where character comes into play, that we have been
professional in what we do. That showed in December when we turned
out season around."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings are 21-7-5-1 since Dec. 9.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings have also suffered key injuries. They lost defenseman
Mathieu Schneider for 23 games, right wing Ziggy Palffy for 19 games
and defenseman Aaron Miller for eight games. Center Eric Belanger has
been out 16 games and counting.</TE>
<TE>   Murray's automobile accident added to the adversity. But the Kings
have been able to turn difficult times into strengths.</TE>
<TE>   "That's from Ace and Mark," center Ian Laperriere said. "We knew
they wanted us to keep going. Their goal was for the Kings to be
successful. It's in the back of everyone's mind, like extra
motivation, because those two guys meant so much to the organization.</TE>
<TE>   "Injuries are part of the game. Andy's accident came out of
nowhere. We've had obstacles all year and the guys have responded.
That shows the character of everyone in this [dressing] room."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Kings are still battling to make the playoffs, but they
certainly are looking forward, not backward.</TE>
<TE>   Of the Kings' final 20 games, 17 are against teams that are either
locks for the playoffs or are in the race for a playoff spot.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the fun part of the game, the challenge down the
stretch," interim Coach Dave Tippett said. "It pushes your team to
play to its capabilities. We're very much in contention for a
division title here, and that's what we're pushing toward."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings have three games remaining with San Jose and two with
Dallas, the first tonight.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings have been chasing San Jose, which has led the Pacific
Division since Nov. 1. Dallas, which has won five consecutive
division titles, is one point behind the Kings. San Jose has one game
left with Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   "All the teams around us are in the same situation, where you
control your own fate," Norstrom said. "That's where you want to be
in this time of the year. If you play well, good things can happen.
It's in our hands."</TE>

<TE>   Update--The Kings recalled center Adam Mair from minor league
Manchester. Mair has one goal in nine games with the Kings this
season. The Stars' three-game winning streak has been spurred by
center Pierre Turgeon. Turgeon has four goals in six games after
having only three in his previous 31 games, which included a
career-high 22 games without a goal.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Magic Johnson has been on the trash-talk firing line. He knows what
it's like to be the superstar target of taunts and mind games.</LD>
<LD>   Over the years he learned how to win that game within the game,
and now he plans on sharing that knowledge with Kobe Bryant, who
Tuesday night completed a two-game suspension for fighting. Bryant
punched the Indiana Pacers' Reggie Miller on Friday, the culmination
of a running verbal battle.</LD>
<LD>   "I am going to tell him, 'You are the man everybody loves,'" said
Johnson, who has a minority ownership stake in the Lakers. "I am
going to tell him, 'Everybody wants to be in your shoes. You've got
to have thick skin.'</LD>
<TE>   "I took plenty of verbal abuse. But when the game was over, I
would just tell [opposing players], 'Look at the scoreboard. Get in
your Winnebago because you're going on vacation.' I would take it out
on them by winning championships. It hurts them more if you don't
respond."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said he is not concerned by Bryant's recent behavior,
which has included two punching incidents in as many weeks, the other
involving teammate Samaki Walker. But Johnson said he will be if it
continues.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm concerned about the fighting and the technical fouls," he
said. "I don't want to see him start to get quick whistles. Pretty
soon, the refs will look at him differently."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Walker, who had hoped to back on the floor Tuesday night, is now
shooting for Sunday's game against the New York Knicks.</TE>
<TE>   The power forward, who has missed nine games since hyperextending
his elbow against the Portland Trail Blazers, did not accompany the
Lakers to Utah for tonight's game, staying behind to continue his
rehabilitation.</TE>
<TE>   "I have broken up some scar tissue in the last two days," said
Walker, who continues to have swelling and pain in the elbow joint.
"But I am able to get range of motion and it looks good for me."</TE>

<HD>A Cakewalk for Lakers, O'Neal</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Center, who turns 30 today, scores 40 to
help L.A. beat Nets and tie for NBA's best record.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Before the game, the Laker girls presented Shaquille O'Neal a
birthday cake with purple and gold icing and three candles. One for
each decade.</LD>
<LD>   O'Neal turns 30 today.</LD>
<LD>   Neither age nor any opposing center show any signs of catching up
with O'Neal, who on Tuesday night at Staples Center led his team to a
101-92 victory over the New Jersey Nets, owners of the best record in
the Eastern Conference at 39-20, and into a tie with the idle
Sacramento Kings for first place in the Pacific Division and the best
record in the NBA at 42-17.</LD>
<TE>   The way O'Neal is playing these days, his sore right toe seemingly
much improved, those three candles might also come to symbolize three
NBA titles for the Lakers' dominating center.</TE>
<TE>   Taking advantage of the absence of teammate Kobe Bryant, serving
the second half of his two-game suspension for fighting, and of the
Nets' starting center, ToddMacCulloch, out with an injured left foot,
O'Neal was at times unstoppable, scoring on dunks with either hand
and showcasing his increased mobility since his return from the
injured list.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal scored 40 points, hitting 16 of 21 field-goal attempts, and
added 12 rebounds, four assists and a blocked shot.</TE>
<TE>   If only he could hit those darn free throws. O'Neal made only
eight of 20 as the Nets reverted to that old standby when all else
fails, the Hack-a-Shaq.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though I missed a lot of them," O'Neal said, "all of them
were right there, they were just popping in and out."</TE>
<TE>   But as many problems as he had at the line, O'Neal caused more
problems for the Nets. Both Jason Collins and Aaron Williams, the two
men assigned to guard him, fouled out in the closing minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "We've ridden Shaq's coattails the last two games," said Laker
Coach Phil Jackson, referring to the games Bryant missed. "Now it's
time to play the team game."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson is also worried that his Lakers, in catching the Kings,
are peaking to early.</TE>
<TE>   Net Coach Byron Scott would love to have such concerns.</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks ago, Jackson's biggest concern was O'Neal's sore toe.</TE>
<TE>   In last week's Laker game against the Timberwolves, a Minnesota
television station referred to O'Neal as "a big, fat liar" for
claiming he was injured.</TE>
<TE>   He is certainly big and he has been known to add a few unwanted
pounds to his massive frame, but anyone who has seen O'Neal soaking
his aching toe in ice water after every game knows he was being
honest about the injury. And anyone who has seen him move in recent
games knows that he is feeling better.</TE>
<TE>   Given the unenviable task of trying to stop the 7-foot-1,
335-pound O'Neal Tuesday were the 7-0, 260-pound Collins and the 6-9,
225-pound Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Before attending Stanford, Collins played his high school ball at
Harvard-Westlake in North Hollywood. Back then, he could only dream
of playing on the same floor as O'Neal, the hometown hero. Tuesday
that dream became a nightmare.</TE>
<TE>   "I need to gain about 100 pounds and increase my bench press by
about 200 pounds," Collins said, describing how he could become
capable of stopping O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets, playing without star forward Kenyon Martin, serving a
one-game suspension for amassing six flagrant-foul points, spent most
of the night chasing the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey shot only 35.2% from the field, hitting 32 of 91.</TE>
<TE>   "If we shoot 41 percent," Scott said, "we win the game. That's how
well I thought we playing."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers surged in front by 18 in the third quarter, but the
Nets, using deadly outside shooting, kept edging ever closer, until
they moved ahead, 77-75. But it was all Lakers down the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   For New Jersey, Jason Kidd had a team-high 19 points, 10 assists
and eight rebounds, but he made only eight of 25 shots. The Nets'
Keith Van Horn had a game-high 14 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   But none of it was enough to offset old man O'Neal, who blew out
the candles on his cake and then blew away the Nets.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<TE>   Second-Half Surge</TE>
<TE>   During the last two championship seasons, the Lakers have had a
better record over the last two months of the season than the first
four. And they are continuing that trend this season:</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>There was little agreement on how much former Rocket franchise player
Hakeem Olajuwon affected the start of Houston's game with Toronto.</LD>
<LD>   But there was no question how much current Rocket franchise player
Steve Francis affected the outcome, scoring 17 of his 35 points in
the third quarter Tuesday and leading Houston from 17 points down to
a 112-109 victory.</LD>
<LD>   The Raptors lost their 12th consecutive game.</LD>
<TE>   It was the first game back in Houston for Olajuwon since being
traded to Toronto last August after 16 seasons with the Rockets.
Olajuwon, who played 1,177 games for Houston, was given his customary
"Hak-e-e-em the Dre-e-e-a-m" introduction, and the crowd went wild
during a one-minute, 15-second standing ovation before the game.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very nice for the fans to do that and I'm very happy they
did," Olajuwon said. "It was what I expected, but I'm still very
happy to get the warm welcome. Ever since I left Houston to go to
Toronto I thought about what coming home would be like and this was
very nice."</TE>
<TE>   But Olajuwon, 39, didn't figure much in the outcome, scoring only
seven points and getting seven rebounds in 25 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The Raptors were led, as usual, by Vince Carter. On his way to
tying his season high with 43 points, Carter made his first five
shots. Jerome Williams made seven of his first eight as the seemingly
inspired Raptors led by as many as 16 in the first half. They
stretched the lead to as many as 17 early in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto's losing streak ties Miami and Cleveland for the
second-longest in the NBA this season. Houston has the worst, losing
15 in a row at one point.</TE>
<TE>   Miami 93, Detroit 91--Eddie Jones' baseline jumper as time expired
won it for the Heat at Auburn Hills, Mich., after Rod Strickland tied
the game by making a wide-open 17-footer with eight seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit's Jerry Stackhouse lost the ball out of bounds with 2.8
seconds to go. Then Jones took Strickland's inbounds pass and scored
at the buzzer.</TE>
<TE>   Jones led the Heat with 24 points. Stackhouse had 22 points for
the Pistons, who lost for the second time in 10 games.</TE>
<TE>   New York 102, Milwaukee 89--Kurt Thomas had 29 points and a
career-high 20 rebounds for the Knicks at New York.</TE>
<TE>   New York won for only the second time in nine games. Sam Cassell
had 18 for the Bucks, who had their three-game road winning streak
snapped.</TE>
<TE>   The Bucks' frustration boiled over late with Cassell and Anthony
Mason being ejected for arguing with officials.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 97, Minnesota 83--Vladimir Radmanovic scored a career-high
21 points and Rashard Lewis made a pair of key three-point baskets as
the SuperSonics outscored the Timberwolves, 16-3, over the final 7:39
to pull away at Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Payton had 18 points, 12 assists and six rebounds for the
SuperSonics.</TE>
<TE>   Payton and the SuperSonics got a reprieve when Payton was called
for his second technical foul at the end of the first quarter.
Official Michael Smith called a double technical foul on Payton and
Anthony Peeler. Smith changed his call after conferring with fellow
official Tom Washington, and a technical foul was only assessed to
Peeler.</TE>
<TE>   Peeler led Minnesota with 20 points.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 81, Phoenix 77--Dirk Nowitzki had 30 points and 20 rebounds
as the Mavericks used a 25-8 fourth-quarter run to win at Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   Jake Tsakalidis led Phoenix with 15 points.</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio 109, Golden State 88--David Robinson had 13 points,
passing 20,000 career points, in the Spurs' victory at San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson became the 27th NBA player to surpass that point total as
the Spurs extended their win streak against the Warriors to 16 games.</TE>
<TE>   Antawn Jamison led the Warriors with 24 points.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana 111, Orlando 98--Jamaal Tinsley had a career-high 30
points and added 12 assists as the Pacers won at Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   The rookie, whose previous high was 29 points, had 22 in the first
half.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando Coach Doc Rivers was ejected with his second technical
foul late in the game. Guard Darrell Armstrong was also ejected.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando's Tracy McGrady was held to 13 points on five-of-21
shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Washington 115, Chicago 90--Reserve Courtney Alexander scored 26
points as the Wizards won their second consecutive game without
Michael Jordan, beating the Bulls at Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Alexander was instant offense, making nine of 11 shots in 28
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Jalen Rose scored 31 to lead the Bulls.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 103, Atlanta 96--Lamond Murray scored 17 of his 23
points in the second half at Cleveland to help the Cavaliers end a
four-game losing streak against the Hawks.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Terry had 29 points for Atlanta.</TE>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite a dismal record as coach of the New York Knicks, Don Chaney
will return next season.</LD>
<LD>   The last-place Knicks announced Tuesday that they have extended

<HD>Report: Williams Handled the Gun</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former NBA player Jayson Williams, charged in the shooting death of a
limousine driver at his New Jersey mansion, tried to put the victim's
palm print and fingerprints on the gun, Sports Illustrated reported.</LD>
<LD>   Around the time the shooting was reported to authorities as an
apparent suicide, Williams and two men also disposed of the bloody
clothes the former New Jersey Net forward was wearing, a witness told
the magazine in an article published this week. The magazine did not
identify the witness.</LD>
<LD>   Williams, 34, is charged with second-degree manslaughter in the
Feb. 14 shooting death of Costas Christofi.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors have said Williams' adopted brother, Victor Santiago,
initially reported the death as a suicide.</TE>
<TE>   Christofi, 55, was hired to drive Williams' friends from a Harlem
Globetrotter game at Bethlehem, Pa., to a restaurant, and then to
Williams' estate 30 miles northwest of Trenton, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   Not including Williams and Christofi, a dozen other people were at
the house. They included Williams' brother, two children and four
Globetrotters.</TE>
<TE>   Neither the prosecution nor the defense has described the events
leading up to the shooting or identified those inside the mansion at
the time.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the article, Steven C. Lember, acting Hunterdon County
prosecutor, noted that authorities took the 911 call at 2:54 a.m.,
not 2:38 a.m. as the magazine reported.</TE>
<TE>   "So that just proves that you can't believe everything you read in
an article," Lember told the Associated Press.</TE>
<TE>   Williams' attorney, Joseph Hayden, told AP he would "address the
relevant issues when we have our day in court."</TE>
<TE>   Williams' agent, Sal DiFazio, refused to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The magazine reported that the Globetrotters in the home were
Chris Morris, Benoit Benjamin, Paul Gaffney and Curley Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Williams made an initial court appearance Monday on the
manslaughter charge. He did not enter a plea and is not required to
do so until a grand jury delivers an indictment.</TE>

<TE>   Exhausted by the demands that followed her stunning gold medal
triumph at the Salt Lake City Olympics, Sarah Hughes has withdrawn
from the World Figure Skating Championships, which will be held March
18-24 at Nagano, Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Angela Nikodinov of San Pedro, who finished fourth at the U.S.
championships, is the first alternate for the world team. However,
her coach, Frank Carroll, said Nikodinov injured her arm during
training and might not be able to step in for Hughes.</TE>
<TE>   "She's skating, but it's difficult for her to pull in [to rotate
on jumps] on one side," Carroll said. "The problem is getting in
enough run-throughs. We can't make a decision right away. We have to
take a couple of days."</TE>
<TE>   Hughes, 16, is the third Salt Lake City gold medalist to pull out
of the world competition. Pairs co-gold medalists Jamie Sale and
David Pelletier of Canada, also in high demand, withdrew last week.
So did dance champions Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat of
France.</TE>
<TE>   The men's Olympic medalists--Alexei Yagudin and Evgeny Plushenko
of Russia and Tim Goebel of the U.S.--are scheduled to compete.</TE>
<TE>   Olympic women's bronze medalist Michelle Kwan of Torrance will
defend her world title at Nagano. Olympic silver medalist Irina
Slutskaya of Russia is also expected to compete. Fourth-place
finisher Sasha Cohen of Laguna Niguel will make her world
championships debut.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike 1998 Olympic gold medalist Tara Lipinski, who left
Olympic-eligible skating after her victory, Hughes plans to stay in
the competitive ranks.</TE>
<TE>   "I plan to spend the summer working to improve my skating
performance and look forward to competing next year at the highest
level possible," she said in a statement released by the U.S. Figure
Skating Assn.</TE>
<TE>   The British Olympic Assn. said skier Alain Baxter, a 28-year-old
Scot who won the bronze medal in men's slalom at Salt Lake City,
tested positive for methamphetamine after the Feb. 23 race and could
be stripped of the medal.</TE>
<TE>   The International Olympic Committee said it would hold a hearing
on the case early next week.</TE>

<HD>Leetch Cashes In Wild Mistake</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Minnesota Coach Jacques Lemaire made a mistake, and Brian Leetch and
the New York Rangers used it for a much-needed victory.</LD>
<LD>   Leetch scored the tying and winning goals to rally the Rangers
past the Wild, 3-2, in overtime Tuesday night after overcoming a
two-goal deficit early in the third period at St. Paul, Minn.</LD>
<LD>   The Wild controlled Eric Lindros in regulation by having center
Jim Dowd and left wing Pascal Dupuis cover him. But less than a
minute after Minnesota goalie Dwayne Roloson made a stellar save of a
shot by Mike York, Lindros found Leetch on a crossing pass from the
corner to win it with 1:16 left.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm mad at myself, because I didn't have the right guys on the
ice," Lemaire said. "Jimmy and Dupuis, they did well against Lindros.
But it's a different game, four-on-four. I felt they could do the
job. I was wrong."</TE>
<TE>   New York had lost four of five and seven of 10.</TE>
<TE>   Radek Dvorak's short-handed goal on a pass from Petr Nedved 2:17
into the final period pulled the Rangers within one.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Andreas Johansson lost control of the puck on an attempt at
a wraparound shot, but it slid to Leetch, who sent it sailing past
Roloson's glove with 6:22 left to tie the score, 2-2.</TE>
<TE>   "That was just a lucky break," Leetch said. "I took a chance by
staying in there."</TE>
<TE>   Dan Blackburn made 25 saves in relief of Mike Richter, who could
be traded before the March 19 deadline.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 6, Florida 5--Alexei Kovalev scored his second goal of
the game with 1:37 left in overtime at Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   Darius Kasparaitis kept the puck alive in the zone for Pittsburgh
and Kovalev fired a shot past Roberto Luongo from 30 feet for his
25th goal. Randy Robitaille also had two goals for the Penguins.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix 4, New Jersey 1--Sean Burke stopped 26 of 27 shots at
Phoenix and the Coyotes extended their unbeaten streak in regulation
time to six games.</TE>
<TE>   Carolina 2, Chicago 1--Sean Hill scored from the slot 1:36 into
overtime at Chicago and the Hurricanes extended their winning streak
to three games.</TE>
<TE>   Nashville 2, San Jose 0--Mike Dunham turned away 26 shots for his
third shutout this season and the Predators ended San Jose's
five-game winning streak at home.</TE>

<DH>Ducks' Success May Signal New Order in Pac-10: Second-Level
Teams Can Be First</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the longest time, it was as if the Pacific 10 championship were
kept locked in a safe.</LD>
<LD>   But only Arizona, Stanford and UCLA knew the combination.</LD>
<LD>   Oregon's Ernie Kent, USC's Henry Bibby and California's Ben Braun
were plotting to crack the code.</LD>
<TE>   Last week, Oregon got there first.</TE>
<TE>   Over the previous 16 years, the only team other than the powerful
top three to win even a share of the Pac-10 title was Oregon State in
1990.</TE>
<TE>   "UCLA, Stanford, Arizona, they were so dominant," Kent said.
"Bigger at all the positions. Stronger. More athletic. More skilled."</TE>
<TE>   While Kent and the rest of the conference's second tier were
working to bridge the talent gap, a dramatic thing happened.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, there was an opening: NBA defections and graduation
after last season left Arizona and Stanford weakened.</TE>
<TE>   "Teams like Arizona, UCLA, Stanford that have those top, top
players--if they go out early, it drops everybody back down
together," Bibby said.</TE>
<TE>   That ushered in the wildest Pac-10 race in memory, with six teams
in contention in the final week and a record six Pac-10 teams almost
certainly on their way to the NCAA tournament.</TE>
<TE>   It also set the stage for this week's revival of the Pac-10
tournament, where the word upset will be rendered irrelevant in a
field with six teams--maybe seven--with a legitimate chance to claim
the conference's automatic bid.</TE>
<TE>   How did Oregon manage to win the regular-season title, and are the
doors thrown open wide for years to come? Or will the familiar
triumvirate return to the top next season?</TE>
<TE>   Let's start with this understanding: Oregon is very, very good.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks are ranked No. 9 in the nation and you can forget their
reputation as a team that was great at McArthur Court but couldn't
win on the road.</TE>
<TE>   When all was said and done, Oregon won at Arizona, USC and UCLA
and lost in overtime at Stanford and double-overtime at Cal.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks have a player in Freddie Jones whose mind-blowing
athleticism might be about to take viewers by storm if Oregon
advances far in the NCAA tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "He is the most gifted athlete, I think, in the country that
people have really missed the boat on back East," Kent said. "To see
the things he has done has been incredible.... I've been in this a
long time, and I'm still shaking my head."</TE>
<TE>   Combine Jones, a senior, with terrific point guard Luke Ridnour
and versatile Luke Jackson--both sophomores--and the Ducks have a
perimeter trio UCLA Coach Steve Lavin calls the best in the West.</TE>
<TE>   They also have a complementary forward in Robert Johnson, as well
as center Chris Christoffersen, the biggest player in the conference
at 7 feet 3 and 305 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   What Oregon did to reach the top was elegantly simple: Kent and
his staff copied what has worked before.</TE>
<TE>   "We stepped back and we looked at Stanford's blueprint and
Arizona's blueprint," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Not so much UCLA's, despite the Bruins' success.</TE>
<TE>   "UCLA's had so much talent, they're so gifted on the floor and
everything, that they could afford to just go and play, because they
were just so doggone good," Kent said.</TE>
<TE>   What Kent, a former Stanford assistant, saw when he studied
Arizona and Stanford was a stable of big, skilled, versatile players
that always seemed to replenish itself.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of using a small forward inside, Arizona and Stanford were
playing with big swingmen whose skills made them extraordinarily
valuable, from the outside in.</TE>
<TE>   Think of Casey Jacobsen at Stanford and Luke Walton at Arizona, or
Mike Dunleavy at Duke.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember Arizona when I first got here [in 1997], and Stanford
too, they would just kill us because they could get from the wing to
the paint, and you couldn't stop them," Kent said. "I would just say,
wow, we've got to get that.</TE>
<TE>   "They all had the 'three' man that was big--6-7. [Richard]
Jefferson, [Ryan] Mendez, Jacobsen--they were good-sized, they were
skilled, they could shoot, they were rebounders. They were always big
at that position, and they always overmatched you at that spot."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson is the least talked about of Oregon's perimeter trio, but
he is that valuable 6-7 swingman--a shooter who can make the
three-point shot, push the ball upcourt on Oregon's relentless
fastbreak, and rebound too.</TE>
<TE>   That's only one piece.</TE>
<TE>   Kent likes his true big men big: There are two 7-footers
redshirting in the Oregon program. Kent--who coached 7-foot-3 Brad
Millard at St. Mary's--is waiting for his next project player to pay
off.</TE>
<TE>   He couldn't have gotten close on a player such as UCLA's Dan
Gadzuric out of high school, but Kent could sign Christoffersen--who
is nowhere near as skilled, but has made more progress in four years.</TE>
<TE>   But make no mistake, it's those perimeter players who are the key
to what Oregon does.</TE>
<TE>   "They've got those three guys, specifically on the perimeter, that
are very good," Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery said. "One night, one
guy gets numbers. The next guy another night. Any one of those three
guys is capable of putting up pretty good numbers."</TE>
<TE>   There's something else Kent identified at Arizona and Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   "They all had that really good point guard," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Think Brevin Knight, Arthur Lee and Mike McDonald at Stanford.
Think Mike Bibby, Jason Terry and Jason Gardner at Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   Think Ridnour.</TE>
<TE>   He wore down late in his freshman season. This season, he's
averaging 15 points and almost five assists a game and shooting 45%
from three-point range.</TE>
<TE>   "He was perfect for what we need," Kent said. "The way we play our
offensive scheme, the way we get up and down the floor, that point
guard is the one who drives the machine, who gets you out and
running.</TE>
<TE>   "But the key to our system is versatility. Luke Jackson and
Freddie Jones, they bring the ball up the floor 15% or 20% of the
time. That way, we can rebound and we don't have to find the point
guard. We can take off down the floor quicker."</TE>
<TE>   Oregon has gotten this far. Now the question is whether the Ducks
will stick around, or whether they're just a flash in the pan.</TE>
<TE>   They've got their coach. Kent, 46, came home to the school he led
to a No. 7 ranking in 1977 as one of Oregon's Kamikaze Kids, and he's
not the sort likely to leave if the Ducks make a postseason run and
people come knocking.</TE>
<TE>   They'll lose Jones and Christoffersen after this season, but the
"Two Lukes" are sophomores.</TE>
<TE>   Kent understands it's lightning in a bottle.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of scary--anyone could have won this thing," he said.</TE>
<TE>   If Jones didn't make those game-winning shots against USC and UCLA
last week, everyone might be talking about Bibby and his blueprint.</TE>
<TE>   Bibby went out four years ago and found two winners from
Westchester High: Brandon Granville is his savvy point guard, and
David Bluthenthal is the 6-7 guy who can make a three-point shot,
drive to the basket and rebound.</TE>
<TE>   Then of course there's power forward Sam Clancy, the Pac-10
player-of-the-year candidate.</TE>
<TE>   But this was Oregon's year. Whether the Ducks have enough to win
the Pac-10 tournament too is another question. And next year?</TE>
<TE>   "We still have to match the continuity of those other programs,"
Kent said. "That's winning multiple Pac-10 titles, going to multiple
NCAA tournaments, going deep into those tournaments, Final Fours.</TE>
<TE>   "But for right now this year, we've accomplished a stage. We've
won that Pac-10 championship."</TE>

<LD>Whew. Finally. All even.</LD>
<LD>   Forty-two wins each. Twenty-three games remaining for both.</LD>
<LD>   Amid the dust stirred by the swatting of another irrelevant
Eastern Conference gnat Tuesday night, an old friend appeared.</LD>
<TE>   This wasn't about the New Jersey Nets, it was about the Sacramento
Kings.</TE>
<TE>   For the next six weeks, it's about the Sacramento Kings.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers defeated the Nets on Tuesday, 101-92, in a game that
sounded like a starter's pistol.</TE>
<TE>   Not because the Lakers blew an 18-point lead and needed late,
lofted three-pointers from Derek Fisher and Devean George to catch
their breath.</TE>
<TE>   Not because the Nets kept scratching and pulling on the giants
with the likes of Aaron Williams and Lucious Harris.</TE>
<TE>   And not, finally, because Shaquille O'Neal welcomed home Net Coach
Byron Scott by telling him where to stuff his Hack-a-Shaq, making six
of 10 free throws in the final minutes to cinch it.</TE>
<TE>   No, the game was a beginning because it pulled the Lakers into a
dead tie with the Kings for the best record in the league and
homecourt advantage throughout the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "Really?" asked O'Neal earlier when told about the possibility. "I
didn't know that. Thank you."</TE>
<TE>   Ah, but he did know that. Coach Phil Jackson talked about it
Tuesday morning.</TE>
<TE>   "I mentioned to the team the fact that we had an opportunity,"
Jackson said. "We want to take advantage of the opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   Then the Lakers thought about it Tuesday night, when they went
into their desperation no-Kobe offense.</TE>
<TE>   Dump it to Shaq. Pass it to Shaq. Hand it to Shaq.</TE>
<TE>   With Kobe Bryant serving the second and final game of his
suspension for fighting, the Laker attack was as typical as it was
inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   And the Nets, the team with the best record in the East?</TE>
<TE>   Just like every other team over there.</TE>
<TE>   Good shooters. Can't stop Shaq.</TE>
<TE>   Lots of offensive rebounds. No earthly idea how to stop Shaq.</TE>
<TE>   Tough mentality. No earthly idea how to stop Shaq.</TE>
<TE>   "The big guy, like I said before, he's unstoppable," Scott said.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal scored 40 points and missed just five of 21 shots to
compensate for the loss of Bryant, while the Nets could not overcome
the loss of their own slugger, Kenyon Martin.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Kidd is supposed to be an MVP candidate, but he looked like
that same guy the Lakers used to embarrass in Phoenix, missing 17 of
25 shots.</TE>
<TE>   Fans jeered him by filling the Staples Center with "M-V-P" chants
for, you guessed it, O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   "They're at home and he's well deserving of those chants," Kidd
said.</TE>
<TE>   Keith Van Horn, their renewed forward who outrebounded O'Neal,
looked like the only Net who could give the Lakers matchup problems
this spring.</TE>
<TE>   But the Lakers already knew their biggest hassle will not come
from the East.</TE>
<TE>   Which brings us back to Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   A team which, given the right conditions and inspiration, could
figure out a way to beat the Lakers this spring.</TE>
<TE>   The only team in the league with that chance.</TE>
<TE>   If the Lakers wind up meeting the Kings in the playoffs, as they
have in the last two seasons, it is imperative that the series begins
and ends in our palace, not their barn.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers didn't need homecourt advantage last season against San
Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   But make no mistake, they will need it now.</TE>
<TE>   If they didn't have it two years ago against Sacramento, they
likely would have never made it out of the first round.</TE>
<TE>   This is a better Kings' team. From top to bottom, this may be an
equal Kings' team.</TE>
<TE>   They have played each other twice this season, each winning on
their home court, with the Lakers outscoring the Kings by just two
points in the two games, 184-182.</TE>
<TE>   They played each other twice more, once in Sacramento on March 24,
and then in the season finale here April 17.</TE>
<TE>   Catching them is bigger than just avoiding the extra game in the
loudest, tightest arena in the league.</TE>
<TE>   Catching them is huge.</TE>
<TE>   As in, 7-foot-1, 335 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers would love to be able to get a couple of games on the
Kings so O'Neal can take one more break before the playoffs and rest
his feet.</TE>
<TE>   "We've ridden Shaq's coattails now the last two games and now it's
time for us to start getting this whole team game together," said
Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   For that to happen, one thing definitely needs to not happen.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant, as mentioned here earlier this week, cannot be suspended
for something silly again.</TE>
<TE>   How much did the Lakers miss him Tuesday night? With three minutes
remaining and the Lakers leading by nine, an exhausted O'Neal trudged
to the bench.</TE>
<TE>   About a minute later, the Lakers led by only four, and Jackson was
shaking his head, and O'Neal was walking back to the scorer's table.</TE>
<TE>   If it wasn't for a resurfacing of the Laker role players, things
could have been much worse.</TE>
<TE>   There was Robert Horry, playing big defense and grabbing 13
rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   There was Fisher, scoring eight of the team's final 13 points.</TE>
<TE>   There was the same familiar bench buzz that helped carry the
Lakers through their toughest nights of the last two springs.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though they have one guy who's pretty good in Kobe being
out, they tend to play a little bit better when everybody moves the
ball and everybody knows they're going to get shots," Kidd said.
"I've seen it done in previous games."</TE>
<TE>   And, then, in the end, there they were.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers and Kings, together again.</TE>
<TE>   Precisely where they started the season.</TE>
<TE>   Undoubtedly where they will end it.</TE>

<HD>San Clemente Finds a Few, Proud Fans</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN HENDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Moments before San Clemente played Newhall Hart in the Southern
Section Division I-A girls' basketball championship game Saturday,
senior guard Kim Buffum got a message from a fan.</LD>
<LD>   "This guy with gold teeth, I don't know his name, but he said,
'You gotta make five three-pointers tonight,'" Buffum said. "And I
said, 'I'll try.' And sure enough, it happened."</LD>
<LD>   The guy with the gold teeth is Lance Cpl. Roosevelt Erving, a
member of San Clemente's biggest group of fans--the Marine Corps at
Camp Pendleton. Erving was rewarded when Buffum made five three-point
baskets--three of them in the fourth quarter--to lift top-seeded San
Clemente to a 67-60 victory over Hart, giving the Tritons their
second consecutive section championship.</LD>
<TE>   It also helped the Tritons to a No. 4 seeding in the Southern
California Regional playoffs, which begin tonight for boys and girls
with games from Fresno to San Diego. The Tritons play at Oceanside El
Camino in the only girls' matchup in Southern California between
section champions.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel really good because I knew we were going to have to be on
the road," said Coach Mary Mulligan, whose victory Saturday over Hart
was her 301st at San Clemente. "Oceanside's only 30 minutes away.
We'll get a good crowd there, and it's next to Camp Pendleton."</TE>
<TE>   Oceanside and San Clemente are separated by Camp Pendleton, and
several Marines have adopted San Clemente as their home team. Twenty
to 30 Marines travel to the Tritons' games--home and away--providing
plenty of moral and vocal support.</TE>
<TE>   One of the officers at Camp Pendleton is Gunnery Sgt. Dennis
Housley, father of San Clemente senior Ashley Housley. Ashley plays
basketball with some of the men on base, and her father invited
members of his Headquarters Company 5th Marines to an early season
game. Three or four Marines grew into 20-30, and it has become quite
the social event.</TE>
<TE>   "We had people showing up at our games just to see the Marines,"
Mulligan said. "The first game they came to, they were really giving
the referee a hard time and chanting '10 seconds.' I had to send my
assistant down there to let them know there was no 10-second
[half-court] rule in girls' basketball.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's really neat. We've never had something like that
before."</TE>
<TE>   There has been a learning curve, though. When the Marines get
rolling, sometimes they don't know when to stop.</TE>
<TE>   "They showed up one night at Dana Hills, which we beat fairly
easily, and at a certain point, it's not appropriate for them to be
so involved in the game if the score's not competitive," Mulligan
said. "But for the Troy game [a 66-62 victory] or a playoff game,
it's really fun to have them around."</TE>
<TE>   In San Clemente's victory over Hart, 25 Marines who arrived by bus
sat on the San Clemente side of the arena--directly behind the Hart
bench.</TE>
<TE>   "They're boisterous," Hart Coach Dave Munroe said. "They were
loud, but that's all in the spirit of the game."</TE>
<TE>   The atmosphere is evident on the floor.</TE>
<TE>   "As a team, we get a little more rowdy during the games," said
Buffum, a senior. "It helps us get more pumped up during the game.
Before they started coming, we would be composed, we would be
excited, but we wouldn't really celebrate. But now, we feed off their
energy."</TE>
<TE>   Gunney Housley admits he is surprised at the  enthusiasm his men
have developed for the basketball team.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of these guys are at an age where they haven't been out of
high school for too long," he said. "This is all too familiar to them
back in their hometowns in Iowa, Minnesota and Illinois. It's an
opportunity to do something in their community without going 30 or 40
miles away."</TE>
<TE>   Before the playoffs, Mulligan joked, "If we make the state
playoffs, the trip to Narbonne will be a lot more fun this year."</TE>
<TE>   San Clemente's only chance to play City champion Narbonne a second
year in a row will be if the teams meet in the regional finals on
March 16 at the Long Beach Arena.</TE>
<TE>   San Clemente (27-3), led by Buffum, 6-foot-3 sophomore Lindsey
Pluimer, and junior guard Sara Brown, must first beat El Camino
(20-9), which defeated Poway in the San Diego Section final, 48-29.</TE>
<TE>   The second-round opponent will be either top-seeded Lynwood
(29-0), the Southern Section Division I-AA champion, or with a major
upset, Chatsworth (22-8), the City Section's runner-up.</TE>
<TE>   On the other side of the bracket, second-seeded Narbonne (25-3) is
playing host to Hart (25-6) in the first round, and the winner of
that game will play either third-seeded Long Beach Poly (32-1) or its
first-round host, Central Section champion Fresno Clovis West (24-5).</TE>
<TE>   Gunney  Housley thinks an important bond has been established
between the community and military, especially on the north end of
the base, which is home to the infantrymen who often engage in the
most serious Marine battles.</TE>
<TE>   He thinks the Marines will follow the Tritons "long after my
daughter and I move on," and that the Marines will try to go as far
as San Clemente does.</TE>
<TE>   "We take it a little bit at a time," Gunney Housley said of
attending a potential second-round matchup Saturday at Lynwood.
"We're doing some field training this week, so we'll have to see
where we're at training-wise.</TE>
<TE>   "We're pretty busy these days."</TE>

<HD>There Are Signs of Thaw in Bibby's Cold Heart</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T.J. Simers</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There was never any problem with USC enjoying success in basketball
because you could always count on Coach Henry Bibby coming off like
some cold-hearted, unapproachable, old-school loon, which certainly
wasn't going to endear him to the alumni and administration of any
other school, so Bibby wasn't going anywhere.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, for example, there was a rumor that our cold-hearted,
unapproachable, old-school loon was headed to Las Vegas, as if the
glad-handing gambling capital of the country would ever consider
someone with all the charm of a ticket-quota-driven meter maid.</LD>
<LD>   And, in fact, Nevada Las Vegas never made a move to talk with
Bibby, hiring instead uncle Charlie Spoonhour, who was out of work
but was the easygoing kind of guy you'd expect to find swapping
cigars with the heavy rollers.</LD>
<TE>   By all accounts, after all the job openings were posted, no one
called Bibby last season after the Trojans finished 24-10, which
tells me local reporters did a great job of portraying Bibby as the
menacing monster who would never fit in elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Three things have happened this year, however, to suggest our
resident ogre could become someone else's godsend:</TE>
<TE>   USC continues to be successful under Bibby despite the handicap of
playing games in a rat trap and playing second fiddle to John
Wooden's school.</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Knight has proved that hiring a monster is not necessarily a
bad thing.</TE>
<TE>   I wouldn't rule out a new and more image-conscious Bibby sitting
down for Oprah or a Barbara Walters' interview, and crying.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FOR THE record, I like Bibby, obviously making allowances because
he's connected with USC, but like Henry Fonda in "On Golden Pond,"
I've always thought our grumpy old Henry was more engaging than he
wanted to let on.</TE>
<TE>   And to be honest, I don't want the eccentric one going anywhere
because he's our very own eccentric one, and for that matter, pretty
darn good at what he does.</TE>
<TE>   Our grumpy old Henry is probably one of the best things going for
USC--if not the only thing (couldn't help myself)--because the
records show this school is not an easy place to win 44 of the last
62 basketball games played. The records also show USC has been
promising a new arena forever, and yet the site of this potential
big-time recruiting tool at Jefferson and Figueroa still remains a
parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   But more than all that, Bibby is someone who has paid his dues
over a well-traveled career of trying to make it as a coach, and when
this guy tells you he's seen it all, he really has coached games in
buildings with no walls and just a leaky roof. That explains why he's
at home in the Sports Arena.</TE>
<TE>   He has his faults, of course. If he doesn't remind everyone once,
he reminds us a hundred times a season that Mike Garrett was the only
one who took the risk of hiring him, as if anyone else would want to
work for Garrett.</TE>
<TE>   The old stories about his estranged relationship with his son,
Mike, who plays for the Sacramento Kings, are probably always going
to register as a ding against him, no matter the explanation. But a
lot more wins than losses has a way of making everything right, as
Knight demonstrated at Texas Tech.</TE>
<TE>   I'm also constantly at odds with ogre Henry because he gets his
jollies playing mind games with his athletes in the name of
old-school discipline, tearing them down like a drill sergeant before
building them back up in his own likeness. I call that abusive, and
he says, "That's not abusive--that's love.... Abusive is the way you
write about your wife in your column."</TE>
<TE>   And I thought no one at USC read Page 2.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   AFTER MAKING a point to say none of his three seniors has shown
leadership this season, and he doesn't expect that to change, I
suggested he was playing mind games again with his players in
preparation for the Pacific 10 Conference tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't play mind games," he said. "I just push the buttons that
have to be pushed with the players to get the best out of them."</TE>
<TE>   Semantics, I said, and Bibby grinned. "Absolutely," he said.</TE>
<TE>   You have to like someone who knows he's giving you a bunch of
bunk, and honest to admit as much if caught, while still sounding
defiant and surprised you would ever think he would give you a line
of bunk until caught red-handed.</TE>
<TE>   But this is also a more mellow Henry Bibby, although he disagreed.
I see a kinder and more embraceable coach, and I think he knows now
why UNLV or no one else called last season.</TE>
<TE>   He still wears a USC baseball cap two sizes too big that swallows
not only his bald head but his ears as well, but the chip on the
shoulder no longer seems so obvious, which has to be a real concern
for anyone who wants to keep this guy in town working wonders with
the Trojans. If the Trojans continue to win, and duplicate or better
last year's showing in the NCAA tournament, he's going to have to do
something really stupid or say something really offensive now to turn
off the suitors.</TE>
<TE>   USC could lose an outstanding coach, and then what else would the
school have going for it?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in an e-mail from Jimmy Fraser:</TE>

<LD>The U.S. women's soccer team has won two world championships and gold
and silver medals at the Olympic Games, but there's a tournament in
Portugal that causes it nothing but grief.</LD>
<LD>   The annual Algarve Cup did so again on Tuesday, when the Americans
were knocked out of medal contention, surrendering a goal in the
final five minutes and losing to Norway, 3-2, in Lagos, Portugal.</LD>
<LD>   That sent the Norwegians into Thursday's championship game against
China and consigned the U.S. to a fifth-place game against Denmark.
The Americans have won the 12-nation Algarve Cup only once in seven
attempts.</LD>
<TE>   Shannon MacMillan scored both U.S. goals Tuesday, extending her
scoring streak to four games, but defensive errors led to the team's
downfall.</TE>
<TE>   MacMillan had given the U.S. the lead on a tremendous 30-yard shot
in the 14th minute, but goalkeeper LaKeysia Beene fouled Norway's
Monica Knudsen, and Hege Riise tied it on the resulting penalty kick
in the 23rd minute.</TE>
<TE>   Six minutes later, Beene miss-kicked a back pass by U.S. defender
Cat Reddick and the ball fell to Dagny Mellgren, who steered it into
the open net to put Norway on top.</TE>
<TE>   MacMillan made it 2-2 when she scored her 43rd international goal
off a pass from Kristine Lilly 15 minutes into the second half, but
the U.S. was unable to hang on to the tie.</TE>
<TE>   In the 85th minute, Linda Ormen's cross from the right wing
bounced off a U.S. defender's shin and the ball rebounded to Solveig
Gulbrandsen, who scored from seven yards out.</TE>
<TE>   It was Norway's fourth consecutive victory over the defending
world champions since its 3-2 triumph in the gold medal game at the
Sydney Olympics.</TE>

<HD>Don't Blame It on Rios</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Chilean player fueled controversy when he said
women's tour lacks depth, but even if he's right, does it matter?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Marcelo Rios isn't the Chilean version of Bobby Riggs or, for that
matter, Richard Krajicek.</LD>
<LD>   To clarify matters, Rios didn't say women's tennis is dull. He
didn't slide his foot into his mouth and disparage the physiques of
the women, the way Krajicek did so artlessly at Wimbledon in 1992.
And he never crept near the always-lively topic of equal prize money.</LD>
<LD>   All Rios did was enliven an otherwise quiet first weekend at the
Australian Open in January by sparking an intense debate about the
depth of women's tennis. His take was that the top women generally
had little opposition in the first few rounds of the Grand Slams
until the quarterfinals. Using the phrase "a joke" might not have
bolstered his argument, however.</LD>
<TE>   Jennifer Capriati and Martina Hingis shot back for the defense,
Hingis offering to hit with Rios. Venus Williams responded with
eloquence, staying above the messy fray. Stefan Koubek supported
Rios, and Rios claimed "everyone" in the locker room agreed with him.</TE>
<TE>   Behind the back-and-forth rhetoric, the question remains: Is Rios
right? And if he is, so what?</TE>
<TE>   An examination of the Grand Slams since the open era started in
1968 shows that the top two seeded women are rarely upset early,
hardly a revelation. The top two seeded players have reached at least
the fourth round at the U.S. Open, with one exception, since 1968.
Still, upsets do happen. At least one of the top two players has lost
before the final 16 six times each at the Australian Open, French
Open and Wimbledon.</TE>
<TE>   Hingis is responsible for two of those at Wimbledon, losing to
129th-ranked Jelena Dokic in the first round in 1999 and No. 83
Virginia Ruano Pascual in the first round in 2001. Coincidentally,
Grand Slam officials started seeding 32 players at the 2001 Wimbledon
to give the top players additional protection.</TE>
<TE>   That occurred after second-seeded Venus Williams lost to
25th-ranked Barbara Schett in the first round at the French Open in
May.</TE>
<TE>   "Every round you have to take seriously," Hingis said. "It's
changed a little bit. You have the 32 seeds now. You don't play a
seeded player until the third, fourth round. That makes it a little
easier nowadays. I thought it was quite interesting to have the top
16 [seeded], and every now and then have a tough first round."</TE>
<TE>   But Hingis maintained she got no breaks in the draw, mentioning a
first-round opponent at the Australian Open, 18-year-old Virginie
Razzano of France, the former French Open junior champion.</TE>
<TE>   "I had my junior there, Razzano, and she was the No. 1 junior in
the world in the past. I didn't think I had the easiest first round.
I just came prepared and played well. Now you just always have to be
ready."</TE>
<TE>   And she was, dispatching Razzano, 6-2, 6-2. In her next three
rounds, Hingis beat Greta Arn, 6-1, 6-2; Barbara Rittner, 6-1, 6-0,
and Amanda Coetzer, 6-1, 6-0. That's what got Rios talking about
depth.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course he's right," said ESPN commentator Patrick McEnroe, who
is also the U.S. Davis Cup captain. "He's totally right. It's not
right to say women's tennis is not exciting. Women's tennis is doing
great. That doesn't mean it's not as exciting, it's just different."</TE>
<TE>   Darren Cahill, now Andre Agassi's coach, provided a clear-headed
view of the situation in his newspaper column for the Melbourne Age.
Cahill said he believed Rios was right.</TE>
<TE>   "He is simply stating an opinion and one that can be well-argued,
that compared with the men, most early-round [women's] matches tend
to be easier assignments," Cahill wrote.</TE>
<TE>   McEnroe gets weary of the inevitable comparisons.</TE>
<TE>   "I think women's tennis is getting deeper," he said. "But it's
certainly not as deep as men's tennis, that's obvious. To me, I get
sort of frustrated with constantly comparing men's and women's
tennis. What other sport does that? To me, it's one game.</TE>
<TE>   "Men's tennis has a lot more depth. But women's tennis has a lot
of excitement. Ten years ago, it was [Steffi] Graf or [Monica] Seles,
and [before that] it was Martina [Navratilova] or Chrissie [Evert]
that was basically going to win the majors. Now it's at least four or
five when you go into a Grand Slam, maybe even six or seven, if you
throw the Belgian girls in there."</TE>
<TE>   Although Venus Williams and Jennifer Capriati have dominated
recently, having won the last seven majors, there has been a
difference at the very top. In the last five months, four players
have been ranked No. 1--Hingis, Lindsay Davenport, Capriati and
Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Five of the top 10 players, and two of the top three in the world,
are missing from the Pacific Life Open, which starts today with
main-draw action at Indian Wells. In the old days, that would have
been a crippling blow. But the event still has marquee players in
Hingis, Seles, 2001 French Open finalist Kim Clijsters of Belgium and
2001 Wimbledon finalist Justine Henin, also of Belgium.</TE>
<TE>   An outside observer contends that safe passage of the stars into
the later rounds is a good thing. Bob Williams, president of Burns
Sports, which matches athletes with companies for endorsements,
believes the lack of great depth gives women's tennis an edge over
men's tennis and, for that matter, golf.</TE>
<TE>   "There [are] five or six players that can win at any time," he
said. "I think it's improved dramatically. There's some great
rivalries building--Martina and Jennifer Capriati the last two years
in the Australian, Venus vs. Jennifer, and Jennifer vs. Serena. There
are a lot of permutations that are good for the sport.</TE>
<TE>   "In particular, that's why I think it's much more popular than the
men's game right now."</TE>
<TE>   For Williams, a new winner each week is a negative.</TE>
<TE>   "Golf is a great example of that," he said. "They normally have
six to 12 first-time winners on the PGA Tour. You're rarely seeing
anyone outside of Tiger Woods win more than one tournament a year."</TE>
<TE>   The depth issue cut the other way for the men at the Australian
Open. The players in the quarterfinals were completely different from
those in the final eight last year. Lleyton Hewitt and Gustavo
Kuerten, the top two seeded players, lost in the first round and No.
4 Yevgeny Kafelnikov lost to 234th-ranked Alex Kim in the first
round.</TE>
<TE>   "In some sense, men's tennis is actually helped and, at the same
time, hurt by how much depth there is," McEnroe said. "What I always
tell people, when you are talking about a Grand Slam, the first week,
you get to see the best matches in men's tennis. You are guaranteed
that you're going to see great matches. In the women's game, you're
not guaranteed. You're maybe going to see a couple of good matches in
the opening week. But people still want to see Venus Williams go out
and win, 6-1, 6-1."</TE>

<LD>It was like elementary school recess, playful and invigorating. So
much fun, in fact, Coach Steve Lavin plans to repeat it.</LD>
<LD>   For more than five minutes against Oregon on Saturday, he employed
a lineup consisting of four freshmen and sophomore T.J. Cummings. The
score didn't change much while the group was on the floor, but the
high level of intensity and tempo exhibited by the youngsters was a
noticeable change from the more plodding senior-dominated starting
lineup.</LD>
<LD>   "There is a strong possibility we'll use that combination again,"
Lavin said. "The chemistry that group has together is excellent, not
to generate a lot of points, but they play defense with so much
energy.</LD>
<TE>   "Sometimes when we integrate them, the younger players defer to
the older players. But as a group, they just play basketball."</TE>
<TE>   Lavin said he might include center Dan Gadzuric with four of the
younger players because he wants Gadzuric to play as many minutes as
possible.</TE>
<TE>   He's not exactly holding out an olive branch, but Matt Barnes
wouldn't mind a trouble-free game Thursday against California.</TE>
<TE>   The last time UCLA faced the Bears, the 6-foot-7 senior forward
drove a forearm into the chest of 5-10 Cal guard Shantay Legans,
sending him to the floor head-first. Legans suffered a concussion and
Barnes was suspended for one game.That game happened to be at
Stanford, and the always inventive Cardinal student section had a
field day, passing out a photo of what looked like Barnes in a police
lineup, with the words: Penal Code: Assaulting a Midget.</TE>
<TE>   Legans, a personable junior from Santa Barbara Dos Pueblos High,
is an acquaintance of Barnes and a good friend of Gadzuric. There is
no ill will as far as Barnes is concerned.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to go out like any other game," he said. "I'll talk to
Shantay before the game. Once the game begins, we are all enemies,
but I'm not going to play dirty and I don't expect them to either."</TE>

<HD>He's a Substitute for Success</HD>
<DH>College basketball: Farmer can provide the punch off the
bench the Trojans need--if he rights his erratic play.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's a fine line between a player who is fearless on the court and
one who becomes the court jester by being foolishly out of control.</LD>
<LD>   It's a line Desmon Farmer has walked often this season.</LD>
<LD>   The USC sophomore guard's season of frustration may very well be
of his own doing, but after a feel-good breakout-type game against
Oregon State on Saturday, Farmer insists he has turned the corner.</LD>
<TE>   And that's a good thing for the 22nd-ranked Trojans. Farmer, who
can score in bunches when he's in the right frame of mind, is USC's
biggest X-factor off the bench in its quest to duplicate the success
it enjoyed last March, when the Trojans advanced to the Elite Eight
of the NCAA tournament under Coach Henry Bibby.</TE>
<TE>   "Until Saturday night, I wasn't really performing like Bibby
wanted me to," said the left-handed shooting Farmer, who seemingly
exorcised his demons by going for 17 points, six rebounds and three
steals in 20 minutes without a turnover.</TE>
<TE>   "Coach has been getting in my tail about that. This has been a
learning experience for me this year."</TE>
<TE>   Farmer came into the season expecting to take the starting
shooting guard spot vacated by the departed Jeff Trepagnier. Farmer
did, after all, average 8.5 points in 16 starts with Trepagnier
serving a suspension.</TE>
<TE>   But after starting five of USC's first seven games this year,
Farmer began reverting to his erratic ways. And with the emergence of
steady freshman Errick Craven, a reluctant Farmer was relegated to
the bench.</TE>
<TE>   It was a blow to his pride. Yet he said the right things publicly,
assuring everyone that he was accepting his role, that he was
comfortable taking in the beginning of a game and getting a feel for
it from the bench before coming in to impart his brand of instant
offense.</TE>
<TE>   But Bibby doles out playing time on a merit system, rewarding
those who practice hardest, especially at the beginning of the
season. Farmer apparently wasn't cutting it in the North Gym and his
minutes began to reflect Bibby's thinking.</TE>
<TE>   After Farmer started USC's first three games, in which he scored a
combined 19 points, Bibby took him on the road to Bradley to teach
him an old-school lesson.</TE>
<TE>   Down on Farmer's work ethic, Bibby sat the sophomore for the
entire game, knowing that a dozen members of Farmer's family had made
the trek from not-so-nearby Flint, Mich., to see him play. Bibby
later acknowledged that while he thought of leaving Farmer in Los
Angeles as punishment, he purposely benched Farmer in front of his
family to drive the point home.</TE>
<TE>   "That hurt because I had my people there," Farmer said. "But I'm
cool now."</TE>
<TE>   He would have more time to cool out and go into a slow burn while
his minutes fluctuated.</TE>
<TE>   Consider: Farmer played 24 quality minutes at Oregon and followed
that with four minutes at UCLA. He then played seven minutes against
Arizona State, 18 against Arizona, 11 at Stanford, 16 at California
and four against Oregon before his 20-minute outing against Oregon
State.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, his average in minutes played took a precipitous
fall. After averaging 23.9 minutes in the Trojans' first 11 Pacific
10 Conference games, Farmer averaged 10 minutes in their next six.</TE>
<TE>   His ever-present smile, accentuated by the mouthpiece he wears,
was gone and he looked disinterested during team huddles when he
wasn't in the game.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been hard on him and it's hard to see him go through it as
an older brother but I've been telling him to just work harder," said
Tim Farmer, USC's director of basketball operations. "I tell him that
he came here for a reason, that if he's deserving, he'll get the
playing time."</TE>
<TE>   Said the younger Farmer, dismissing rumors that he was considering
a transfer: "I wasn't thinking that this wasn't the place for me, but
I was struggling with my minutes going up and down. I was wondering
what [Bibby] was thinking.</TE>
<TE>   "With my time going up and down comes droughts and the confidence
just goes away. I'm just going to stick it out and ... hopefully my
role will grow next year.</TE>
<TE>   "But I'm hungry for the tournament this year."</TE>
<TE>   That's fine with the Trojans, who begin Pac-10 tournament play
Thursday against Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   "He's going to be huge for us in [tournament] games," senior
forward Sam Clancy said of Farmer. "We're going to need a guy off the
bench to get us that offensive spark. When he comes in looking to
pass first he's struggled. He needs to come out and look for his
shot."</TE>
<TE>   Bibby agreed, to a degree.</TE>
<TE>   "I want my subs to come in and kind of be out of control," he
said. "We've had some of the subs come in and just be on the floor.
You can't be that as a sub. Desmon Farmer has to come in and be out
of control where I either leave him in the game to play five more
minutes or I'm going to take him out then."</TE>
<TE>   Farmer, who's averaging 7.5 points in conference, had a sit-down
with Bibby last weekend and, combined with his performance against
Oregon State, insists his confidence is back.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll just go in there and play," Farmer said. "If I mess up, I
mess up. If I don't, I don't. Just roll."</TE>

<LD>USC seniors Sam Clancy and Brandon Granville had a competition to see
who would finish with more steals.</LD>
<LD>   Too bad they let freshman Errick Craven in on the contest.</LD>
<LD>   While Clancy and Granville tied with 33 steals apiece in Pacific
10 Conference games, Craven led the league with 51 thefts.</LD>
<TE>   "I used to listen to them and in my mind I was like, 'They don't
really know that I'm going to beat both of them,'" Craven said with a
smile.</TE>
<TE>   "Defense is kind of my forte. I told them that and they kind of
just laughed at me."</TE>
<TE>   Craven is the first freshman to lead the Pac-10 in steals since
California's Jason Kidd in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Having started 17 conference games and averaging 12.9 points and
4.0 rebounds, Craven is also a leading contender for the Pac-10's
freshman of the year award, along with Arizona's Salim Stoudamire and
Channing Frye. The Pac-10 announces its year-end awards tonight.</TE>
<TE>   While Clancy, a front-runner for league player of the year, has
joined USC Coach Henry Bibby in voicing a disdain for the Pac-10
tournament, essentially saying that the Trojans have nothing to gain
NCAA seeding-wise from the three-day affair, senior forward David
Bluthenthal did not agree with them.</TE>
<TE>   "Absolutely not. Coach Bibby's getting a paycheck and Sam's
probably going to the [NBA] anyway," Bluthenthal said, grinning. "For
me, I need as many games as I can get."</TE>
<TE>   Bibby and Clancy, however, reiterated that they would have
preferred to play in the tournament were they still a lower-echelon
team.</TE>
<TE>   When Clancy was asked, then, if it was a chance for Arizona State
and Washington to make some noise, he was blunt.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good idea for them," he said, "but they're probably going
to lose in the first round."</TE>
<TE>   On the eve of postseason play, Bibby's season-long search for a
team leader has come to an end. "I'm the leader of the team," he
said. "They follow me."</TE>

<HD>Connecticut Has Easy Time in Big East Final</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Connecticut is not only heading into the NCAA tournament with a
perfect record, it's going there after two games of near-perfect
play.</LD>
<LD>   The Huskies (33-0) made their first six shots and 10 of 11 in
defeating No. 20 Boston College, 96-54, Tuesday night at Piscataway,
N.J., in the most lopsided championship game in the history of the
Big East Conference women's tournament.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't know if we can play any better," Connecticut Coach Geno
Auriemma said. "I said that last night but I thought we played better
at times tonight, especially defensively."</LD>
<TE>   Ashja Jones, the tournament's most valuable player, had 19 points
and 11 rebounds and Tamika Williams had 18 points for Connecticut,
which won its ninth consecutive conference tournament and secured its
14th consecutive berth in the NCAA tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Conference player of the year Sue Bird scored 16 points, sophomore
Diana Taurasi had 14 points and eight assists, and Swin Cash had 10
points for the Huskies, who extended their conference tournament
winning streak to 27 games.</TE>
<TE>   "They keep going for 40 minutes," Boston College forward Nicole
Conway said. "That's what makes them so difficult. Some teams are
satisfied only being up by 20. But UConn, they want to beat you by
50. They just want to put you away."</TE>
<TE>   The 42-point margin of victory topped the previous tournament
record of 36, set by Connecticut in an 85-49 win over Seton Hall in
1995. The Huskies, who shot 59% against Boston College (23-7), also
set a record for the biggest margin of victory in the three games,
winning by an average of 38.7 points.</TE>
<TE>   Connecticut held the previous record, winning by an average of
32.3 points in 1995, the year it won its first national championship.</TE>
<TE>   "I sense right now we have not a sense of urgency but a sense of
confidence going into the tournament," Cash said. "We came out ready
to play. We wanted to win another championship."</TE>

<LD>On paper, today's pick six at Santa Anita, which has a carryover of
$202,790, looks like a pick five.</LD>
<LD>   Love At Noon, one of three horses leading trainer Bob Baffert will
send out, will be a very short price to beat only four opponents in
the seventh race.</LD>
<LD>   A 4-year-old Afternoon Deelites filly owned by Mike Pegram, Love
At Noon is dropping from four consecutive graded stakes races in
search of her third victory.</LD>
<TE>   After breaking her maiden at Santa Anita last April 7 and winning
an allowance race on the Kentucky Derby undercard at Churchill Downs
on May 5, Love At Noon was second in the Grade III Dogwood at
Churchill, second in the Princess Stakes at Hollywood Park, third in
the La Brea Stakes on Dec. 29 and fourth in the El Encino on Jan. 20.</TE>
<TE>   Sprinting again, she should be able to handle Madame Pietra,
Harvest Girl, Filigree and Farah Love.</TE>
<TE>   Four days ago, she went half a mile in 454/5, the best of 32
workouts at the distance that morning.</TE>
<TE>   The other pick six races are a route for 3-year-old
California-bred maidens, a mile event for $12,500 fillies and mares,
an allowance sprint (61/2 furlongs) for 3-year-old fillies, a
six-furlong dash for 4-year-old fillies competing for a
$10,000-claiming price and a six-furlong race for $40,000 maiden
3-year-old fillies.</TE>
<TE>   Making her comeback in the fifth is September Secret. In her only
start, June 10 at Hollywood Park, the Our Emblem filly beat a field
that included eventual stakes winner Ayanna and Tempera, who went on
to win the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies. September Secret is
trained by Mike Machowsky for the Lo Hi Stable.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The pick six sprint for 4-year-old fillies is
wide open. Those playing the six are advised to spread in the field
of 12 and hope for the best.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Gabe. The Devil On Ice gelding has won his last two and
will try to keep his roll going in today's sixth at Golden Gate
Fields.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Bob Hess Jr. The trainer is on an 0-for-31 streak at
Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking:  A pick four using Saint Bernadette and
September Secret in the fifth, Prospective Angel, Penteli De Gras,
Continental Issue, Billary's Syns and Cafe Del Mar in the sixth,
singling Love At Noon in the seventh and Greeley Creek, Miss Guts and
Grade Nine in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous Day/Meet Total: 3/143. Money: Previous Day/Meet
Total: $18.40/$850. Total money bet: $858.</TE>

<LD>Larry Wein, football coach at Westchester High since 1982, said
Tuesday he has not been invited back to coach next season.</LD>
<LD>   Wein, 59, who has been a head coach for 27 seasons, planned to
retire from teaching this year but asked to continue coaching the
Comets.</LD>
<LD>   "My principal was not comfortable with that," Wein said. "I'm
disappointed."</LD>
<TE>   Westchester hasn't lost a Western League game since 1998. The
Comets won the City 3-A title in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   Principal Dana Perryman said Wein decided to retire and insisted
the coach had not been fired.</TE>

<LD>UCLA hired Tom Fitzgerald as men's soccer coach Tuesday over a field
of candidates that included former national team coach Steve Sampson.</LD>
<LD>   Fitzgerald spent parts of six seasons as coach of Major League
Soccer's Columbus Crew. He was 70-67-7 with the Crew and led it to
three Eastern Conference finals before being fired six games into the
2001 season. He coached 10 seasons at Division II Tampa and guided
the Spartans to the 1994 NCAA title.</LD>
<LD>   Sampson, the national team coach from 1995-98, interviewed last
week and was thought to be a favorite.</LD>
<TE>   The Agoura Hills resident played at UCLA and San Jose State and
coached for five years at Santa Clara. Loyola Marymount Coach Paul
Krumpe, a former UCLA player and assistant, was the other finalist.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to mince words here; I'm very disappointed with
their decision," Sampson said.</TE>
<TE>   Fitzgerald, 51, said he was "pleasantly surprised" when he got the
call from UCLA. He replaces Todd Saldana, who resigned Jan. 31
because his diploma was from an unaccredited university.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UC Irvine senior Jerry Green was selected Big West Conference
men's basketball player of the year for the second consecutive
season, while Long Beach State's Travis Reed and Cal State
Northridge's Markus Carr were chosen to the first team. Green is the
first repeat player of the year since Larry Johnson of Nevada Las
Vegas in 1990 and 1991.</TE>
<TE>   UC Santa Barbara junior forward Mark Hull and Desmond Penigar and
Tony Brown of Utah State rounded out the team. Utah State's Stew
Morrill was selected coach of the year for the second time in three
years. Northridge guard Ian Boylan was chosen freshman of the year.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cal State San Bernardino (26-1), the top-ranked men's basketball
team in Division II, will play host to the NCAA West Regional at
5,000-seat Coussoulis Arena. The Coyotes earned a first-round bye and
will play Friday against the winner of Montana State Billings and Cal
State Bakersfield, which meet Thursday in a first-round game.</TE>
<TE>   Defending Division II women's champion Cal Poly Pomona (23-4) also
got the nod to play host to a regional. The Broncos open play Friday
and will face either Bakersfield (22-5) or Seattle Pacific (22-5).</TE>
<TE>   Chapman College advanced to the Division III women's basketball
round of 16 for the first time after defeating Carleton (Minn.),
87-74, Saturday night in the second round. It will play Pacific
Lutheran (Wash.) either Friday or Saturday at a site to be
determined.</TE>

<TE>   This week's national college baseball rankings were influenced
heavily by the outcome of the four-team, round-robin Kia Baseball
Bash at Cal State Fullerton. Houston (9-4), ranked No. 25 by Baseball
America before the tournament, vaulted 15 spots to No. 10 after
sweeping Cal State Fullerton, USC and defending national champion
Miami, all of which finished 1-2.</TE>
<TE>   Miami (9-6), ranked No. 6 going into the weekend, dropped to 11.
Fullerton (10-6) fell from 11th to 13th and USC (6-7) dropped from

<HD>Dentist Cleared on Most Counts</HD>
<DH>Trial: Jury acquits Pasadena doctor accused of
over-sedating children on dozens of charges but deadlocks on three.
D.A. may seek a retrial.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Pasadena pediatric dentist accused of over-sedating her patients
and causing brain damage to one was acquitted Tuesday on five dozen
criminal charges. But the jury deadlocked on three counts.</LD>
<LD>   After an often emotional four-month trial, Drueciel Ford, 50,
smiled broadly and hugged one of her attorneys as the court clerk in
Los Angeles Superior Court read the final not-guilty verdict.</LD>
<LD>   "Thank you, God," she said as she later hugged her husband.</LD>
<TE>   District attorney's prosecutors, who appeared shocked, declined to
speak to reporters, citing the prospects of a retrial on the three
counts.</TE>
<TE>   The panel deliberated for 21/2 days before acquitting Ford of
charges ranging from child endangerment to using unlicensed
assistants. Those charges involved more than 30 children.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors could not reach a verdict on two counts of child
endangerment and one of conspiracy. Judge Lance Ito declared a
mistrial on those charges.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys said they will ask Ito to dismiss the charges,
noting that not more than two jurors favored guilty on the counts. If
convicted of all the counts, Ford had faced up to 30 years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   "I am just so happy, totally happy.... I would never have been
able to make it through this if not for my friends, family and my
faith in God," Ford said outside court, about two years after her
arrest.</TE>
<TE>   "The big thing I want to make clear is that my prayers go out to
Melissa McGrath's family," she said.</TE>
<TE>   McGrath had been undergoing treatment at Ford's Pasadena clinic in
March 1999 when she suffered a heart attack that left her brain
damaged and unable to write or do such tasks as tie her shoes or
shower on her own.</TE>
<TE>   It was McGrath's heart attack that drew police to Ford's clinic
and led them to interview dozens of parents who alleged their
children had been over-sedated.</TE>
<TE>   The case revived a larger debate over whether, and when, it is
appropriate to charge a medical professional with a crime for
problems that occur during treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Ford's attorneys said prosecutors lacked evidence to support its
allegations of child endangerment.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a vindication for Dr. Ford and proves it should not have
been in the criminal system at all," said Robert McNeill, one of her
attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   During the trial, where dozens of parents, several expert
witnesses and Ford's dental assistants testified, prosecutors
insisted she was driven by greed. Her practice, they said, resembled
a production line, where the misuse of oral sedatives caused patients
to leave in a rag-doll state and caused McGrath's brain damage.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses called by Deputy Dist. Atty. Albert MacKenzie alleged
that McGrath received six times the maximum dose of the sedative,
chloral hydrate, while having a tooth pulled. They said she suffered
a heart attack and was clinically dead in Ford's office for 28
minutes before paramedics resuscitated her.</TE>
<TE>   McNeill and co-defense lawyer Edi Faal, however, portrayed Ford as
a caring dentist victimized by a misfortune that was turned into a
criminal case.</TE>
<TE>   "From the onset, we knew Dr. Ford did nothing wrong. There was a
medical misadventure," Faal said of the McGrath incident.</TE>
<TE>   A cardiologist from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center testified for the
defense that McGrath's heart attack was not caused by the sedative
but was a result of her fainting. Another defense expert testified
that it was not unusual for children to leave a dentist office
sleepy.</TE>
<TE>   Ford's attorneys exploited that expert testimony and apparent
problems with evidence. Under their cross-examination, a dental board
investigator testified that neither he nor Pasadena police had
obtained samples of McGrath's blood taken at the hospital and never
sought a test for levels of chloral hydrate.</TE>
<TE>   In closing arguments, Faal accused Pasadena police and dental
investigators of persuading witnesses to give statements favorable to
the prosecution. A dental board investigator initially had testified
that Dana Harmon, a Ford assistant, told him she gave McGrath a few
teaspoons of chloral hydrate, within the allowable dosage of 2,000
milligrams.</TE>
<TE>   Based on that statement and other evidence, a prosecutor who
headed the medical case unit for the county district attorney
rejected the case in October 1999.</TE>
<TE>   But the investigator testified that in December 1999, Harmon told
him she had lied, and that McGrath actually had received a large cup
of the sedative, about six times the recommended dose.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys noted that Harmon by that time had filed a
workers' compensation claim against Ford's practice for job stress.</TE>
<TE>   Another key witness was McGrath's mother, Jan McGrath, who told
investigators her daughter had been given two half-cup doses.</TE>
<TE>   But it was revealed that in a separate case, prosecutors had
charged Jan McGrath with perjury in a case involving welfare
benefits. That case is pending.</TE>
<TE>   Ford's license had been suspended pending the outcome of the
criminal charges.</TE>
<TE>   McNeill said the next step is to get back Ford's four children,
whom social workers had removed from her home. He said, "The jury has
given those children back to her."</TE>

<HD>No-Show Poll Workers Leave Some Unable to Cast Ballots</HD>
<DH>Primary: Shortages of supplies at 27 county locations also
hinder the process.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN L. MITCHELL and KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Election officials scrambled Tuesday to staff, reopen and resupply
more than two dozen polling places where voters were turned away or
faced long delays because a troubling number of poll workers didn't
show up.</LD>
<LD>   The shortages forced officials to dispatch election workers and
emergency supply kits containing ballots, voting rosters and other
equipment to 27 of the 4,865 polling locations throughout Los Angeles
County, from Valencia to Long Beach to Montebello.</LD>
<LD>   "We normally have cancellations, but this was unusually high,"
said Conny B. McCormack, the county's registrar-recorder/county
clerk. "This election was tremendously complicated anyway, but this
time an unprecedented number of precinct inspectors didn't show up."</LD>
<TE>   At a polling place in Los Angeles' Mount Olympus district,
would-be voter Joann Leonard was locked out and indignant.</TE>
<TE>   "We get constantly told to go out and vote, go out and vote. And
when people turn out to vote, what happens? No ballots. This makes
you feel disenfranchised," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials were dealing with a number of election complications:
changes in the primary system; new rules reducing by almost half the
number of days to register voters; and redistricting that eliminated
the polling places of 11,626 voters who were told they would be
forced to use absentee ballots this time.</TE>
<TE>   The first indication of problems came over the weekend when 150
poll workers opted for various reasons not to work, McCormack said.
"We scrambled to replace them, but it wasn't easy."</TE>
<TE>   She said most poll workers are retirees who are not always
comfortable with the growing complexities of the election system.
Finding replacements hasn't been easy because the job has increasing
responsibilities and the pay is low. An election inspector earns $75
for 14 hours of work.</TE>
<TE>   "There is not a cadre of people coming behind" the aging and dying
poll workers, McCormack said. "It's a national problem."</TE>
<TE>   She said the county has pressed many new people into service at
the last minute. "They showed up, but we have had a number of polls
where precinct workers didn't show or some showed up and found they
were alone. They panicked and went home."</TE>
<TE>   At Moffet Elementary in Lennox, there were no supplies when poll
inspector Lana Burnett arrived. "I showed up, but the equipment
didn't," she said. "It's frustrating. I turned away 30 people and
told them to come back before the polls close. I hope they do."</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Taylor, a poll worker, had a similar experience at
Crescent Heights Boulevard Elementary. A shortage of supplies forced
her to turn away 75 to 100 voters before more supplies arrived and
the polling place was finally opened. "It's been very exasperating,"
Taylor said. "I kept asking myself why am I doing this."</TE>
<TE>   "I kept thinking this is worse than Florida," said Joanne Boye, a
voter. "At least [in Florida] they allowed you to punch things out."</TE>
<TE>   At the Beverly Plaza Hotel, voters were delayed two hours before
the polls opened. But in La Puente, a polling place never opened.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really surprised--we have had a polling place here for over
10 years," said Esther Romo, who works as a secretary at Latin
American Bible Institute, where the polling place is based. "We
opened a special room [for voting], but no [poll workers] came. They
called to confirm they were coming, but no one showed up."</TE>

<HD>Young Scientist Lonely at the Top</HD>
<DH>Honors: Alhambra High senior is state's only contestant in
the Intel Science Talent Search.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOE MATHEWS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This week, 17-year-old Tim Dong is visiting Washington, the first
time in his life he's been to the East Coast.</LD>
<LD>   "From where I started, I never had any idea I'd get to this
point," he said. The Alhambra High School senior will dine with
leading researchers, chat with politicians and compete for $530,000
in college scholarships in the finals of the nation's most
prestigious contest for budding young scientists. He will be
representing California.</LD>
<LD>   All by himself.</LD>
<TE>   It's an off year for the Golden State, a longtime powerhouse in
the Intel Science Talent Search that has produced at least four of
the 40 nationwide finalists each of the last four years. Each winter,
the finalists are selected from thousands of high school seniors
nationwide who conduct original scientific research.</TE>
<TE>   Previously known as the Westinghouse for its first sponsor, the
60-year-old contest has a proven record of identifying groundbreaking
thinkers. Finalists have earned five Nobel Prizes, two Fields Medals
(the Nobel of the math world) and 10 MacArthur grants.</TE>
<TE>   This year, however, America's most populous state has produced
only one finalist in the contest, which is sponsored by a
California-based company. By contrast, Illinois has five and Maryland
has four. New Jersey and Texas have two each. And New York, long a
dominant force in the contest, has 15. There are more finalists--
two--from Manhasset High School on Long Island than from all of
California.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm happy for Tim," said Duane Nichols, the Alhambra High science
teacher who has supported Dong's prizewinning chemistry project. "But
it's embarrassing for the state to not be better represented."</TE>
<TE>   In the state's defense, California also sent a lone finalist to
Washington in 1994 (though it produced more semifinalists then than
it did this year). Nonetheless, California's poor showing this time
around has added to worries about the quality of the state's science
education. Last year, California's eighth-graders tied for last among
40 states on the National Assessment of Educational Progress science
test.</TE>
<TE>   "What we've seen in California over the last few years is a
de-emphasis of the kinds of hands-on science that encourages people
to go into science," said Christine Bertrand, executive director of
the 3,600-member California Science Teachers Assn. "When you see the
results of the Intel talent search, you see that we reap what we
sow."</TE>
<TE>   Education officials cite a lack of opportunity for California
students to do laboratory work. Many teachers blame the state's
assessment tests, which focus on reading and math skills to the
exclusion of science. Others say California's 4-year-old standards
for teaching science cover so many subjects that they leave little
time for the lab.</TE>
<TE>   "The standards de-emphasize investigation and experimentation,"
said state Supt. of Public Instruction Delaine Eastin.</TE>
<TE>   Other teachers and experts discount the significance--and the
relevance--of the science contest. Mike Aiello, a science teacher at
San Luis Obispo High who helped draft the state science standards,
argues that California faces far more basic problems than its yield
of Intel finalists. It has too many needy students who speak too many
different languages to worry about science contests, which remain the
purview of well-off high schools and science magnets, he said.</TE>
<TE>   And the state's top students, others argue, prefer to devote their
energies to Advanced Placement classes and the sports, entertainment
and extracurricular activities available in a state so blessed by the
sun.</TE>
<TE>   But the story of Dong belies such arguments.</TE>
<TE>   The son of immigrants, he attends an ordinary public high school,
with test scores that rank slightly below state averages. He found an
opportunity to perform high-level research through initiative, rather
than privilege or connections. Devoted to his science project, Dong
has not been defined by it. He has found time to serve as class
treasurer, write for the school paper and take part in the election
for homecoming king--which he won.</TE>
<TE>   "Tim is extraordinary in many ways, but in others he's a regular
teenager," said Nichols, his teacher.</TE>
<TE>   Dong said his research "certainly didn't take all my time. I don't
think I missed anything."</TE>
<TE>   Dong's parents, Dawson and Suli Dong, are natives of Taiwan who
settled in Alhambra 20 years ago. Dawson Dong, an engineer, found a
job at the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. Suli Dong works
as a management analyst for the Los Angeles Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   The Dongs sent Tim, the elder of two children, to a private
Lutheran school through the seventh grade. With finances tight, they
transferred him to public school in the eighth grade.</TE>
<TE>   At Alhambra High, he applied for a special science program run by
Nichols. "I had an interest in science and math," Dong said. "But I
didn't really have the preparation."</TE>
<TE>   Nichols, a 60-year-old who has taught at Alhambra High for three
decades, started the program called "biomedical research" 20 years
ago at the behest of eager students.</TE>
<TE>   The program's 90 participants meet before school three days a week
for 45 minutes. Dong's father usually drops him off just before 7
a.m. on his way to work.   Nichols requires his students to seek out
research projects.</TE>
<TE>   Near the end of his freshman year, Dong walked the halls of the
Physical Science Building at Cal State L.A., handing out his resume.
Outside a chemistry lab on the seventh floor, he met Matthias Selke,
an assistant professor of chemistry.</TE>
<TE>   "He was about 14 at the time, but he looked even younger," said
Selke. "He hadn't taken any chemistry yet, but I felt sorry for the
kid."</TE>
<TE>   Selke agreed to let Dong work in the lab six to eight hours a
week. At first, Dong was limited to designing Web pages, but he soon
received an assignment.</TE>
<TE>   Selke asked him to investigate the chemistry of phosphorus
compounds, which are often used to fine-tune catalysts used in
certain reactions. In particular, Selke wanted to know the rate at
which oxygen combined with phosphorus compounds. Oxidation--the union
of a substance with oxygen--is something that chemists typically try
to avoid because it destroys catalysts. But Dong persisted for two
years. Eventually, he presented some of the first experimental
evidence for the existence of a very unstable and previously unknown
compound.</TE>
<TE>   His findings might be applied to the preparation of catalysts that
resist oxidation--making reactions more efficient. Selke said the
research also may assist in the search for oxidizing agents that
derive from the air and are nontoxic. Today, common commercial
oxidants often are toxic compounds such as chromium 6.</TE>
<TE>   Selke sent Dong to San Francisco to present his work at an
American Chemical Society conference, where the appearance of the
baby-faced student caused a minor stir. Dong eventually published his
results in Organic Letters, a peer-reviewed journal. "Most students
publish their first paper in the second or third year of graduate
school," said Selke.</TE>
<TE>   Dong also won the Project of the Year award at the California
State Science Fair last year. He found that he had a talent for
explaining complex chemistry. "I like to talk about science," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   In the Intel contest, two of Dong's classmates made the list of
300 national semifinalists. That gave Alhambra three of the 14
semifinalists from California.</TE>
<TE>   "To tell the truth, I've been very surprised by all this--and
particularly surprised that Tim is the only Californian," said Dawson
Dong. Even as an engineer, "I can't keep up with this level of
chemistry. I'm just his driver."</TE>
<TE>   Tim Dong said he is sure there are plenty of other students who
could do what he did. He has applied to Harvard, Yale and Johns
Hopkins, but is also looking at UCLA. "If you look, there are a lot
of great places to study science," he said, "right here in
California."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Microsoft Corp. has agreed to pay more than $100,000 and change its
billing practices to settle a consumer protection suit alleging that
the company continued to charge California customers for Internet
service they tried to cancel, prosecutors announced Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement ends a 3 1/2-year probe into complaints that
Microsoft failed to promptly close Internet accounts when customers
tried to end their service. Microsoft refused to cancel a
subscription unless the customer could provide the credit card number
used to bill the account.</LD>
<LD>   During the investigation by the Orange County district attorney's
office, Microsoft produced two dozen complaints from angry customers
in Orange County and throughout California.</LD>
<TE>   But prosecutors said the number of affected consumers could be
much higher, and under the settlement, California subscribers who
believe they were overcharged can seek compensation from the company.</TE>
<TE>   Last Wednesday, the district attorney's office filed a consumer
protection lawsuit alleging that Microsoft's practice of billing
customers who asked to terminate their service amounted to "unlawful
or unfair business practices."</TE>
<TE>   "It was apparent that the people who complained were very upset,
so we decided there had to be some change in [Microsoft's]
procedures," Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. Andrea L. Burke said.</TE>
<TE>   While admitting no wrongdoing, Microsoft promised to reimburse
consumers as part of the settlement and to scour records from as far
back as 1998 to find others who might have been improperly charged.
Company officials also agreed to make it easier for customers to end
Internet service.</TE>
<TE>   The case is the latest in a series of legal claims filed on behalf
of customers against the software company.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft is in the midst of trying to settle more than 100
consumer antitrust lawsuits, including the high-profile claim filed
by the U.S. Department of Justice. In addition, nine states,
including California, and the District of Columbia continue to press
for tough court sanctions against the company over alleged monopoly
practices.</TE>
<TE>   In the Orange County case, prosecutors said that any overcharging
by Microsoft was probably not deliberate. Rather, it occurred because
of the company's billing policies.</TE>
<TE>   Subscribers to the Microsoft Network who telephoned the company to
cancel their Internet service were asked for credit card information
as proof of identification. Sometimes, a customer's credit card had
been upgraded or replaced due to theft, so the card no longer matched
the number listed in Microsoft records.</TE>
<TE>   When the numbers did not match, customers were asked to produce
bank records to prove they were the account holder, prosecutors said.
Meanwhile, Microsoft allegedly continued to bill them for  service
they no longer wanted.</TE>
<TE>   The monthly cost of the services ranged from $4.95 to $19.95, with
some customers being overcharged for up to four months' service,
Burke said.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft was "trying to make sure they were dealing with the
correct customer," she said, "but the effect on consumers was that
they couldn't immediately terminate their account."</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft officials said they are willing to compensate anyone who
was overcharged.</TE>
<TE>   "Our intention has always been to make account changes convenient
but also secure," company spokesman Matt Pilla said. "We apologize if
this created any inconvenience for customers." The settlement, which
was also signed by the California attorney general's office, was
approved Monday by Orange County Court Commissioner Dennis Keough.</TE>
<TE>   Under the agreement's terms, Microsoft will pay $75,000 in fines
and reimburse prosecutors $25,000 for the cost of their
investigation. The company will pay back subscribers with free
Internet access or credit card reimbursements.</TE>
<TE>   In the future, company officials will refer subscribers with
similar credit card problems to a supervisor, who will try to resolve
the problem.</TE>
<TE>   "This addresses an issue that customers were concerned about,"
Burke said. "It should give them some immediate relief."</TE>

<HD>Davis Names Former Edison Chief to PUC</HD>
<DH>Energy: Consumer groups are angered by appointment of
industry insider. Governor defends his choice.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM REITERMAN and NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>To a chorus of protests from consumer groups, Gov. Gray Davis on
Tuesday appointed Michael R. Peevey, a former head of Southern
California Edison, to the state panel that oversees utilities.</LD>
<LD>   Peevey, 64, an economist and entrepreneur who made millions of
dollars during the state's failed deregulation effort, was named to
the California Public Utilities Commission, effective Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   "With more than three decades of experience in the energy and
environmental industries and academia, Michael Peevey brings a broad
background of knowledge to the PUC," Davis said in a statement. "His
insight on the ever-changing electricity market will be invaluable to
the commission as it makes decisions about California's energy
future."</LD>
<TE>   Peevey served as a special energy advisor to Davis during the
energy crisis, acting as intermediary with utilities and the energy
industry.</TE>
<TE>   He replaces Republican Richard Bilas, who resigned last week and
whose term expires at the end of the year. Peevey's appointment gives
Davis four commissioners on the five-member panel.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' appointees, especially PUC President Loretta M. Lynch, have
not always moved as fast as he wanted or in the direction he wished.</TE>
<TE>   Peevey said he has a good working relationship with Davis. "To the
maximum extent possible, I want to work in concert with him."</TE>
<TE>   But consumer groups that had urged Davis not to appoint someone
with connections to the energy industry or utilities were angered.</TE>
<TE>   "Gov. Davis has once again placed the power industry ahead of the
public," said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer
Rights in Santa Monica. "It's outrageous that the governor would make
someone with such long-standing ties to the energy industry one of
the state's chief energy regulators."</TE>
<TE>   Matt Freedman, an attorney with the Utility Reform Network, said
consumer groups also fear that Davis eventually will strip Lynch of
the PUC presidency and bestow it upon Peevey.</TE>
<TE>   "We think that would be a disaster for consumers," Freedman said.</TE>
<TE>   Peevey, who is recovering from lung cancer surgery, said it is
unfair to stereotype him because of his associations and past jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "I am doing this thing at some sacrifice to me because I feel I
can represent the public interest in good fashion," he said. "I want
to see the economy in California improve, rates come down, and I want
to enhance and promote green energy."</TE>
<TE>   Associations of energy providers and large industrial users
immediately hailed the appointment of Peevey, whose experience ranges
from utility executive to chief of an energy-saving software company.</TE>
<TE>   "He knows how the real world works, which would be a welcome
change at the PUC," said Jan Smutney-Jones, executive director of the
Independent Energy Producers Assn.</TE>
<TE>   D.J. Smith, consultant and lobbyist for several energy interests
who has known Peevey for more than 15 years, said, "He is very
independent. I don't expect him to agree with my clients on every
issue. But I would much rather deal with someone who understands the
issues, which are arcane, complex and controversial."</TE>
<TE>   Peevey, a UC Berkeley graduate and father of three, is married to
Assemblywoman Carol Liu (D-La Canada Flintridge).</TE>
<TE>   He left Edison in 1993. He then did consulting work for about 18
months before starting an energy service company, New Energy Ventures
in Los Angeles. He sold it for about $100 million in 1999 to AES
Corp. He sold his AES stock  for about $12 million.</TE>
<TE>   Peevey said he disposed of other energy holdings to avoid any
conflicts with his wife's job as lawmaker. And he sold additional
stocks, including Enron Corp. stock, last year before signing on as
an advisor to Davis.</TE>
<TE>   PUC spokeswoman Terrie Prosper said the commission was pleased
that the governor acted so quickly to appoint a successor.</TE>
<TE>   And Henry Duque, the lone Republican on the panel, said he has
known Peevey since his days at Edison and praised him as a "sound
businessman. He understands what businesses do."</TE>
<TE>   Consumer groups accused the Davis' office of timing the
appointment so that it would get lost in election news. But Steve
Maviglio said the governor's office wanted to act quickly because of
the  business before the commission.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Voting Goes Smoothly Despite Late Write-In Change</HD>
<DH>Polls: Officials deliver signs saying a list of rivals of
an accused judge is available. County workers fill precinct staffing
gaps.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA BORGATTA and CHRISTINE HANLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County election officials reported no major snafus at the
polls Tuesday, despite recent court rulings that changed voting
procedures.</LD>
<LD>   A last-minute push ensured that all precincts were equipped with a
sign in three languages notifying voters that a list of write-in
candidates for a judicial post was available and could be taken into
the voting booth.</LD>
<LD>   The effort came after a recent ruling in a lawsuit by challengers
to Judge Ronald C. Kline, who faces molestation and child pornography
charges.</LD>
<TE>   The signs were delivered as ordered, officials said, but there was
confusion at some polling places about what rules to follow.</TE>
<TE>   There also was a last-minute effort to staff the county's
precincts. More than 300 county employees helped fill the gaps.</TE>
<TE>   Some longtime volunteers backed out of serving in this primary,
Orange County election officials said, citing confusion over recent
statewide changes in voting procedures. The court-ordered changes
also led to complaints from voters who were hoping to switch party
affiliations or vote across party lines.</TE>
<TE>   "We had people say that it was getting too complicated and they
didn't want to participate anymore," said Terri Niccum, a spokeswoman
for the county's registrar of voters.</TE>
<TE>   Bonnie Smith, an unaffiliated voter in Modjeska Canyon, said she
had to declare a party affiliation--a surprise to her. She chose the
Democrats, but was disappointed she couldn't also vote for some
Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   "They're limiting me," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   Poll worker Misha Koshimizu said she and fellow workers had to
shush several people who complained loudly about incumbent Gov. Gray
Davis, saying they wanted to vote for Republican Richard Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   In Fountain Valley, some Republicans voting early at Los Amigos
High School were unable to cast ballots for members of the party's
central committee because the available ballot cards didn't have the
candidates' names.</TE>
<TE>   By early afternoon, however, precinct workers said a fresh batch
of ballots had been delivered to the polling place.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in Tustin, voters in one neighborhood were surprised to
learn that their precinct had been limited to mail ballots only.</TE>
<TE>   Voter Susan Selman said she didn't know what to think when she
received a mail-in ballot weeks ago. She saved it, however, and
dropped it off at her former polling place Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   She said many of her neighbors, thinking the notification was junk
mail, discarded their ballots and were unable to vote in person.</TE>
<TE>   "They said they had lots of complaints," Selman said of the poll
workers she talked to. "Apparently, it's a mess."</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, election officials scrambled Tuesday to
staff, reopen and resupply more than two dozen polling places where
voters were turned away or faced long delays because a number of poll
workers didn't show up.</TE>
<TE>   The shortages forced officials to dispatch election workers and
emergency supply kits containing ballots, voting rosters and other
equipment to 27 of the county's 4,865 polling locations.</TE>
<TE>   At a polling place in Los Angeles' Mount Olympus district,
would-be voter Joann Leonard was locked out and indignant.</TE>
<TE>   "We get constantly told to go out and vote, go out and vote. And
when people turn out to vote, what happens? No ballots. This make you
feel disenfranchised," she said.</TE>

<LD>He presumes to speak for no one but himself, a priest in a parish
trying to make people's lives better. He's willing to give an
interview but fears that anything he says might make him sound like
an apologist for brethren whose sexual misconduct in parishes across
America has jolted the Catholic Church.</LD>
<LD>   This is no time for apologists, Father John McAndrew says.</LD>
<LD>   To my ears, he doesn't sound like one. What I hear during the hour
we talk in a church office on the grounds of St. Angela Merici in
Brea is a soft-spoken priest who's saddened by the scandals that
indirectly touch all priests, but resolute in supporting new policies
in the Diocese of Orange that would root out the offenders.</LD>
<TE>   "I want to make it eminently clear my primary concern is for those
who have been wounded," McAndrew says. "That's what this whole policy
is about. It's long overdue."</TE>
<TE>   I sought out McAndrew, a ponytailed 47-year-old who's been a
priest for about 15 years, to get a feel for how the budding scandal
affects other priests. My job and McAndrew's life intersected three
years ago on an unrelated story, but I remembered him as an
introspective and committed man of God.</TE>
<TE>   I figured the scandals within the priesthood, which have reached
from Boston to Southern California, must be killing him.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a lot more aware today of the damage that's inflicted on
people by those in positions of leadership, whether it's a teacher,
parents, priests," he says. "When somebody is given spiritual
leadership and ... that trust is abused, that wound cuts so deeply
for many people, they may never find their way to any healing."</TE>
<TE>   The Orange diocese's zero-tolerance philosophy might sound harsh
to a flock of priests who believe in redemption, but McAndrew says
it's sound policy.</TE>
<TE>   But even as he endorses without question the high standards
priests must maintain, he adds a wry twist.</TE>
<TE>   "We know ourselves to be sinners," he says, referring to biblical
doctrine. "Priests are not the holiest people in the parish."</TE>
<TE>   While the percentage of offending priests in America may be small,
it is the church's historic secrecy and denials that, ironically, now
unfairly may make more of its members suspect.</TE>
<TE>   I ask McAndrew about that trust. "The title of father is not one
we come by easily. Implicit in that is great trust. The people of God
give us a tremendous amount of responsibility and dignity, and they
know us very well."</TE>
<TE>   Does he fear that he and other priests, untouched by scandal
themselves, will lose that trust? "I don't fear it, I don't expect
it," he says, but adds that he'd welcome a meeting where parishioners
could come to church and speak their minds, "to ask questions, to
vent, whatever they need to do."</TE>
<TE>   I ask if he's angry at the church. He pauses for several seconds
before answering: "Deep sadness. I know my own self, my own foibles,
my sinfulness. I know that my church is far from perfect, but
somewhere in the midst of all this is still the opportunity for</TE>
<TE>   grace."</TE>
<TE>   True believers must hope the twisted path of scandal ultimately
will bring redemption and grace, pillars of Roman Catholics' faith.
They also must know the church has much work to do in repairing its
credibility.</TE>
<TE>   "The good [that will come] is that we're being very clear that
we're listening to those who have been victimized," McAndrew says.
"That this won't happen again. That our primary concern as a church
is not to save face but to serve."</TE>
<TE>   And even as that happens, someone will tend to the less popular
task of helping the fallen priests. Their plight also saddens the
family of priests left behind, McAndrew says. But for now, such
grieving for them likely will be done in private.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so hard not to make it sound like anything I'm saying is
defensive," McAndrew says. "Of course it's defensive. It hurts when a
brother gets punished. If my own brother were sent to prison, he
wouldn't stop being my</TE>
<TE>   brother."</TE>
<TE>   With all that has happened, I ask if in some way, McAndrew has
lost faith in what he does.</TE>
<TE>   "No," he says, "because we understand ourselves. We are called to
holiness. Priests are called to a specific way of serving people, a
specific ministry. And we know our failures well."</TE>

<HD>Mourners Recall Granville as True Public Servant</HD>
<DH>Memorial: The clerk- recorder, who died last week at 72,
spent 20 years in county government after a journalism career.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HICKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the night before his death, Orange County Clerk-Recorder Gary L.
Granville was busy hatching plans to counter the negativity he
believed was plaguing county politics, a longtime friend told fellow
mourners Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "Gary was upset ... with too much phony baloney," political
colleague Stan Oftelie said of his final talk with Granville on Feb.
27. "He wanted us to write a [newspaper] opinion piece about it
together. He was competitive to the end."</LD>
<LD>   More than 500 people crowded into the Salvation Army Church in
Tustin to remember the many facets of Granville's life: journalism,
public service, church and family.</LD>
<TE>   All five county supervisors attended, as did County Executive
Officer Michael Schumacher, his predecessor Jan Mittermeier and
former county Sheriff Brad Gates. Former Supervisor William G.
Steiner drove from his home in Arizona to speak about Granville, for
whom flags were flown at half staff at county offices on news of his
death last Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to be here; Gary was one of the really, really good guys in
government," Steiner explained.</TE>
<TE>   Schumacher told the audience of Granville's determination during
last summer's rolling blackouts that they not affect service to the
public.</TE>
<TE>   "He set up a card table in the yard outside the office, and when
the power went down, he took care of the public out there,"
Schumacher said. "He set the pace for innovation and service to his
customers, the taxpayers."</TE>
<TE>   Granville, 72, had served in county government for about 20 years.
Before that, he was one of the most respected journalists in Orange
County.</TE>
<TE>   Granville had run his own machine shop in Orange for 20 years. But
at age 40, with three daughters at home, he got his degree in
journalism from Cal State Fullerton to fulfill a lifelong dream to be
a writer.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County Register editor and writer Larry Welborn, one of the
memorial speakers, told the audience that Granville's first job was
with the Fullerton News-Tribune. "I know it couldn't have paid much,
but to Gary, it was the greatest job in the world," Welborn said.</TE>
<TE>   Granville moved on to the Daily Pilot and later became city editor
at the Register.</TE>
<TE>   Oftelie, a fellow reporter in those years, said he once told
Granville in frustration that he found himself having to rewrite his
stories three and four times to get them right. Granville replied
that he often rewrote his own pieces 30 times.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1980s, Granville went to work for then-county
Supervisor Ralph B. Clark and in 1985 accepted an appointment as
county clerk. His first major act was to tell the county supervisors
that his job should be eliminated, to save taxpayers money.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors eventually joined the clerk's job with the recorder's
office, and Granville won election to that position handily.</TE>
<TE>   Granville also became well known for his charity work. He raised
funds for the Salvation Army. He also donated all his fees from
performing marriages to local charities aimed at helping troubled
youths. Granville often spent lunch hours tutoring some of those same
teenagers at Santa Ana's Youth Guidance Center.</TE>
<TE>   "He quietly chipped away at the problem of literacy," Schumacher
said. "He said getting them to read was the best way to get them
straight."</TE>
<TE>   Father Brad Karelius, rector at the Messiah Episcopal Church in
Santa Ana, told of Granville and his wife, Joanne, founding the
outreach ministry Heart to Heart for the chronically ill and shut in.</TE>
<TE>   "He always lifted my spirits and reminded me that there is no
greater honor than to be a servant," Karelius said.</TE>
<TE>   Many commented on how appropriate it was that the memorial service
came on election day, because Granville was a passionate believer
that everyone must vote.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, he announced that he would not seek reelection this
year. He recently said he wanted to get past his health problems and
spend more time with his eight grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Three of them spoke at Tuesday's service. Kevin Mitchell, a
linebacker for the University of Oregon, spoke through tears about
his grandfather coming to see the UCLA-Oregon game in a wheelchair,
determined not to miss it.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody has a backbone in the family," Mitchell said. "He was
ours."</TE>

<HD>Man Faces Burglary, Forgery Charges in Stolen Mail Case</HD>
<DH>Crime: Huntington Beach resident's behavior at a bank
aroused the manager's suspicions and triggered a police
investigation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Huntington Beach man was charged with burglary Monday after police
found more than 50 pieces of stolen mail and chemicals used to alter
checks in his pickup truck, police said.</LD>
<LD>   William R. Shelton, 24, was arrested last week after arousing a
bank manager's suspicions by trying to cash a check that was written
in two colors of ink. He is being held at the Orange County Jail in
Santa Ana in lieu of $50,000 bail, said Huntington Beach Det. Patrick
Ellis.</LD>
<LD>   Shelton tried to cash a check Thursday at Bank of America in the
5800 block of Edinger Avenue, Ellis said.</LD>
<TE>   A manager became suspicious because it looked as if someone had
written over the name of the recipient and the amount. Additionally,
the original check was written in blue ink, and the new information
was in black.</TE>
<TE>   The manager called the woman who had written the check, and she
said it had been addressed to AT&amp;T, not Shelton, Ellis said.</TE>
<TE>   Ellis said Shelton became nervous and left, but the bank manager
called police and wrote down the license plate number of the white
pickup truck Shelton was driving.</TE>
<TE>   Police staked out the owner's house, but Shelton did not return
that day.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, a patrolman noticed the truck outside the house, and
arrested him.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the truck, police said they found more than 50 pieces of
stolen mail and a chemical used to alter checks.</TE>
<TE>   Police also found a pipe used to smoke an opium-based substance,
Ellis said.</TE>
<TE>   Shelton was charged Monday with forgery, commercial burglary,
receiving stolen property, possession of drug paraphernalia and
committing a crime while on bail.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation is ongoing, but police suspect there are at
least 30 victims in Huntington Beach and surrounding cities.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the tip of the iceberg," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach police said mail theft has been increasing in
recent years, and warned residents and businesses to secure incoming
mail as soon as possible.</TE>
<TE>   Outgoing letters should be mailed at a postal facility rather than
left in an unmonitored mailbox, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone with information about mail theft is asked to call the
Huntington Beach Police Department at (714) 960-8843.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The public has until April 29 to comment on a plan to temporarily
store partly spent nuclear fuel in large concrete vaults at the San
Onofre nuclear power plant.</LD>
<LD>   Plant officials want to wrap the waste in two layers of steel and
put it in reinforced concrete casks. Spent fuel is now being stored
in temporary cooling ponds, but "dry casking" is considered safer
because it requires less maintenance and is less susceptible to
accidents caused by human error.</LD>
<LD>   Two nuclear reactors at San Onofre provide energy for 2.2 million
homes from Santa Barbara to San Diego.</LD>

<HD>Cal State Northridge Posts Record Enrollment</HD>
<DH>Education: CSUN has 31,681 students this semester, marking
its recovery from the sharp decline in the aftermath of the 1994
earthquake.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL CHAMBERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More students are enrolled this semester at Cal State Northridge than
at any time in the school's 44-year history.</LD>
<LD>   Enrollment at the San Fernando Valley's only four-year university
has reached a record high with 31,681 full- and part-time students,
spokeswoman Carmen Ramos Chandler said. The number tops by 233
students the previous record enrollment set in the 1988 fall
semester.</LD>
<LD>   "The university's reputation today is that we are a destination
university--not a second choice," Chandler said.</LD>
<TE>   Increased enrollment and demand for classes has prompted
administrators to close fall admissions to freshman and sophomore
transfer students and to all post-baccalaureate applicants, Chandler
said. Admissions for those seeking graduate degrees remain open.</TE>
<TE>   The average CSUN student is employed and female, about 26, lives
in the Valley and carries a full-time course load of 12 to 15 units
per semester, Chandler said. About 26% of students are taking fewer
than 12 units.</TE>
<TE>   CSUN has rebounded from a significant dip in enrollment brought on
by the 1994 Northridge earthquake, which caused more than $400
million in damage to the campus.</TE>
<TE>   "No building on campus was unscathed," Chandler said, adding that
quake damage at CSUN was the most extensive ever incurred at any
public institution in U.S. history.</TE>

<HD>Oakmont Vote Imminent</HD>
<DH>Glendale: Hundreds of residents crowd into City Hall and
the Civic Auditorium as the council considers the fate of the
572-home project in the Verdugos.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KRISTINA SAUERWEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hundreds of Glendale residents packed City Hall and the Civic
Auditorium on Tuesday night to speak out against plans to build 572
luxury homes in the Verdugo Mountains, a project that has preoccupied
the community for years.</LD>
<LD>   The hearing stretched into the night as the City Council prepared
to render a final vote on the Oakmont View V development. To
accommodate the crowds, the city provided a televised link between
City Hall and the Civic Auditorium, where homeowners and
environmentalists testified.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, the city's Planning Commission unanimously recommended
that the council reject Oakmont.</LD>
<TE>   Developer Lee Gregg said Tuesday that he probably would file a
lawsuit if the council voted against his project. "We would have no
choice," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit would contend that the city denied him the right to
build on the property, even though he followed all the planning
rules, Gregg said.</TE>
<TE>   The developer proposed Oakmont in 1992, a year before the council
adopted a hillside-protection ordinance that would have limited the
project to about 50 homes. Gregg sued the city over the law.</TE>
<TE>   Preservationists have persuaded state lawmakers to allocate $8
million to purchase the 238-acre tract. But Gregg says the land was
appraised at $46 million more than a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   "The courts might have to decide the price," said Gregg, vice
president of Gregg's Artistic Homes. "I'm hopeful the City Council
will fully evaluate the issue."</TE>
<TE>   Oakmont opponents argued Tuesday that the project would drain city
services, burden schools and destroy the environment.</TE>
<TE>   "Building on open spaces is not the answer," said Joanne Hedge of
Glendale's Rancho Homeowners Assn. "The mountains offer a titanic
presence."</TE>
<TE>   As it did during last week's commission hearing, staff members
from the city's Planning Division presented a 24-page report that
found that the project is "inconsistent with the city's General Plan"
and "poses a significant public safety hazard."</TE>
<TE>   The report cautioned that building homes on the steep, rocky
slopes could trigger landslides or rockslides.</TE>
<TE>   Gregg disputed that claim, saying that debris basins would be
installed to prevent slides.</TE>
<TE>   "We would be improving public safety," Gregg said.</TE>
<TE>   But the city report also found that Oakmont would pose
"substantial environmental danger" to oak and sycamore trees,
wetlands and wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   Proposed federal legislation calls for a study of expanding the
Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area to include the
Verdugos. That would allow the Oakmont land to be set aside for
recreation.</TE>

<HD>Totten Routs Bamieh for D.A.; Hoffman, Parks in Tight Race</HD>
<DH>Election: Bamieh's huge fund-raising advantage fails to
sway voters. Early returns show Lane staying close to Mikels for
supervisor's post.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT and TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Veteran administrator Greg Totten won a commanding victory Tuesday
night over prosecutor Ron Bamieh in the race for Ventura County
district attorney, ending a bitter contest that shattered local
campaign spending records.</LD>
<LD>   "This shows that the electorate believes law enforcement is doing
a good job, and that includes the district attorney's office," Totten
said to supporters' wild cheers, with late returns showing him with a
2-1 lead over Bamieh. "And it shows that they value experience and
integrity. That was our message throughout this campaign and that is
the kind of office we are going to run."</LD>
<LD>   Hosting what was supposed to be a celebratory victory party at the
Pierpont Inn in Ventura, Bamieh said he was "dumbfounded" by the
returns.</LD>
<TE>   But Bamieh stopped short of conceding.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not happy," Bamieh said as the numbers flashed on a nearby TV
screen. "But there's no quit in me right now."</TE>
<TE>   Millionaire businessman Randy Hoffman and Thousand Oaks
Councilwoman Linda Parks were locked in a tight contest for the
Thousand Oaks supervisor's seat. Hoffman took an early edge in
returns but Parks overtook him slightly as more votes were counted.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Judy Mikels led in her quest for a third term in the
Simi Valley-based 4th district. But her rival, Moorpark fraud
investigator John Lane, was within striking distance with a long
night ahead.</TE>
<TE>   In the county clerk-recorder's race, Asst. Recorder Phil J. Schmit
was cruising with a comfortable lead at the top of a six-candidate
field. Schmit was endorsed by incumbent Clerk-Recorder Richard Dean,
who is retiring at the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Totten's commanding lead came as election officials predicted that
the number of voters casting ballots in the primary could be the
lowest in years. Dean said turnout could rival a 33% historic low set
in 1994, another off-year election.</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh attempted to win voters over with a costly cable TV
advertising blitz that started late last year. Bamieh's ads ran
frequently as he tried to overcome Totten's endorsement by virtually
the entire law enforcement community and the candidates' boss, Dist.
Atty. Michael D. Bradbury.</TE>
<TE>   But that strategy appeared to backfire with some voters, who said
they were turned off by Bamieh's relentless ad campaign. Voters also
said they were concerned about the fat-wallet campaign bankrolled by
the candidate's father, wealthy San Mateo businessman and frequent
GOP contributor Sam Bamieh.</TE>
<TE>   "I have heard the Bamieh TV ads for months," said Adrienne Moore,
71, of Westlake. "I just got sick of hearing them. That's entirely
too much money to put into winning a race." Tuesday capped an
electoral season marked by record spending in two county races and by
accusations of sleazy tactics.</TE>
<TE>   With no limits on campaign contributions, spending in the district
attorney's race swelled to $1.5 million this week, while the
Hoffman-Parks battle approached $600,000.</TE>
<TE>   The fight for district attorney was the first contested race for
that office since 1978 and was the most expensive ever for a single
county seat.</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh, a 36-year-old senior deputy district attorney, ran on a
platform of bringing change to the prosecutors' office. He touted his
trial experience and called his opponent a bureaucrat unwilling to
fix problems in how the office handles criminal cases.</TE>
<TE>   Totten, the 47-year-old chief assistant district attorney, vowed
to improve on his boss' tough-on-crime legacy by hiring more
minorities and seeking grants for new programs. He won early support
from Bradbury, Sheriff Bob Brooks and every local police chief.
Supporters described Totten as a proven leader with integrity and
administrative experience.</TE>
<TE>   But Totten had to put his endorsements up against Bamieh's money.</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh spent more than $1 million on mailers, signs and television
and radio ads, as well as the services of a New York-based campaign
advisor and pollster known for his work on U.S. Senate races.</TE>
<TE>   In the final days of the campaign, Sam Bamieh made eight
contributions totaling $262,000 to his son's campaign pay for a
flurry of last-minute ads.</TE>
<TE>   Altogether, the candidate's father donated $1,024,719, more than
any single donor has ever given to a Ventura County race.</TE>
<TE>   Totten raised less than half that amount, about $400,000, and
spent much of it on television ads and mailers, some of which struck
even his supporters as nasty and negative. Totten defended his
tactics, saying the campaign had to respond to misleading ads aired
by his rival.</TE>
<TE>   Accusations of mudslinging were frequent during the race.</TE>
<TE>   In mid-February, Totten called a news conference to criticize
Bamieh for running a TV ad that featured a 72-year-old Santa Paula
supporter who was convicted in 1989 of selling cocaine. Bamieh said
he was unaware of the man's criminal past.</TE>
<TE>   Totten said the slip-up showed his opponent's lack of judgment.
Bamieh, however, said the publicity stunt made clear that Totten was
willing to "destroy people's lives" to gain his boss' seat.</TE>
<TE>   In Thousand Oaks, the contest to replace retiring Supervisor Frank
Schillo was hard-fought and costly. The same divisions that have
balkanized city politics for a decade reared their head during the
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Parks, 45, hammered repeatedly on her record of opposing nearly
all growth in the city and promised to fight the 3,050-home Ahmanson
Ranch development at the county's eastern fringe if elected.</TE>
<TE>   She "walked the walk" while her opponent was only paying lip
service in support of slow-growth policies to get elected, Parks told
voters. She pounced on Hoffman's contributions from developers and
others in the construction industry as evidence that, once in office,
Hoffman would support development that residents oppose.</TE>
<TE>   Parks limited her contributions to $500 per individual and raised
about $106,000 from retirees, attorneys, and slow-growth advocates.
Hoffman, meanwhile, raised nearly five times that amount even though
he announced his candidacy months after Parks.</TE>
<TE>   As of this week, Hoffman had raised about $450,000 and was
spending it as fast as it came in. Most of his contributions came
from the Conejo Valley's business elite, including $91,000 from Dole
Foods CEO and Lake Sherwood developer David H. Murdock.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman, 48, sought to portray Parks as a divisive, single-issue
politician who does not have the breadth to solve the complex
problems that come before the Board of Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman has emphasized his business credentials throughout the
race, reminding audiences that he helped found Magellan Systems, a
successful technology company. But those credentials were tarnished
last month by news reports that one of his recent business ventures
has teetered on bankruptcy and left a trail of debts.</TE>
<TE>   In the Simi Valley supervisor's contest, Mikels ran hard against
Lane as she sought a third term. The incumbent said she was forced to
raise more money than she had anticipated, about $117,000, because of
Lane's financial backing and endorsements by the county's law
enforcement unions</TE>
<TE>   Lane raised about $90,000, largely through contributions from the
deputies' union and loans to himself.</TE>
<TE>   The deputies and county firefighters backed Lane because Mikels
has stood fast with the Board of Supervisors in refusing to grant the
unions a costly increase in retirement benefits. In her previous two
campaigns, the deputies had supported Mikels.</TE>
<TE>   Mikels, 56, ran on her record as a fiscal conservative and a
no-nonsense approach to county business. Lane, 54, positioned himself
as a slow-growth advocate, criticizing Mikels for supporting the
Ahmanson Ranch development and a highway-widening project in her
district.</TE>
<TE>   He drew support from environmentalists and slow-growth advocates,
as well as Somis residents who don't want California 118 near their
homes widened.</TE>
<TE>   Mikels did not believe her financial backing from business
executives and developers, including $27,500 from Murdock, would hurt
her standing with voters in the conservative district, which also
includes Moorpark and Somis.</TE>

<HD>Deputy City Attorney Accused of Luring Teenage Boy for Sex</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAURA LOH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A deputy city attorney for Los Angeles was charged Tuesday with
attempting to lure an underage boy over the Internet to meet him for
sex.</LD>
<LD>   Richard Bruce Coplen, 49, who has been with the city attorney's
office for more than two decades, was arrested Sunday in Duarte
during a sting by the Los Angeles Police Department.</LD>
<LD>   "Such alleged actions are intolerable, especially if they involve
a minor," City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo said in a statement. "[The]
LAPD and the district attorney have my full support and cooperation
in investigating this matter."</LD>
<TE>   Coplen was arrested "at the location where he believed he was
going to meet the boy," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Christina Fleming.
Coplen was charged with attempted oral copulation of a minor and
attempted sexual penetration of a minor.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Coplen had sex with the teenager in December after he
sent him an "instant message" over the Web offering to pay him
$150,000 for sex. That alleged encounter took place at Coplen's
Highland Park home after he picked up the boy at a park, police said.
"We understand there was some money, but it wasn't $150,000," said
Lt. Daniel Mulrenin.</TE>
<TE>   After the teenager went to the LAPD in January, investigators
assumed his online identity and arranged a second meeting.</TE>
<TE>   After the arrest, police served a search warrant at Coplen's home
and seized two computers.</TE>
<TE>   Coplen is scheduled to be arraigned next Tuesday. He has been
placed on paid leave pending an administrative hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Coplen joined the office in 1978 and once headed the anti-gang
unit. He now works in the office's real property and environment
division.</TE>
<TE>   Police asked other potential victims to call Det. Dale Barraclough
at (213) 485-2883 during work hours or (213) 485-2504 in the evenings
and on weekends.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Indicted Hells Angels leader George Christie Jr., who is being held
under house arrest on drug and racketeering charges, will be allowed
to attend his mother's funeral.</LD>
<LD>   Christie, 54, obtained a court order permitting him to attend the
services this week. He will be escorted by his attorney.</LD>
<LD>   Christie, his ex-wife, their 25-year-old son and several members
of the Ventura chapter of the Hells Angels motorcycle club were
indicted last year on charges of running a narcotics ring that sold
prescription pills to teenagers.</LD>
<TE>   Christie spent 11 months in jail before posting a $1-million bond
in January. Under terms of his release, he cannot leave his Ventura
residence except to attend court.</TE>
<TE>   Christie's son, George Christie III, remains jailed in lieu of $1
million. He also asked to attend the funeral services but later
abandoned his request.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia Christie died last week of complications of pancreatic
cancer. She was 82.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Oxnard school district officials have agreed to study the possibility
of converting one of their elementary schools into a
kindergarten-through-eighth-grade campus.</LD>
<LD>   The format, popular in private schools, could relieve overcrowding
in the district's three middle schools and provide a different
environment for adolescent students, Supt. Richard Duarte said.</LD>
<LD>   The board will convene a task force to study the concept and how
it could be applied to any of the district's 14 elementary schools.</LD>
<TE>   Duarte said grouping elementary and middle school students seems
to help the older students make better connections with their school
environment.</TE>
<TE>   The district is still negotiating to buy 27 acres behind Oxnard
High School on which it hopes to build an intermediate school. That
campus would be needed to meet enrollment demands even if a K-8
school were created, Duarte said.</TE>

<HD>Worker Hopes Graffiti Vandals Get the Message</HD>
<DH>Ventura: Responding to city hotline calls, Warren Gaston
paints over the markings--again and again. Still he says he isn't
discouraged.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARRI KARUHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Warren Gaston meandered along the Ventura River bottom in his pickup,
on the lookout for graffiti.</LD>
<LD>   When he found some scrawled along the rocks and support beams of a
Highway 33 overpass, Gaston jumped out of his truck and, with a sweep
or two of his power sprayer, covered the markings with paint.</LD>
<LD>   "It's fast," said the maintenance worker for Ventura's Public
Works Department. "That's why I love it."</LD>
<TE>   Gaston, 54, is the muscle behind Ventura's graffiti hotline, the
phone number the city's property owners can call to have graffiti
removed for free.</TE>
<TE>   But Gaston also goes on regular patrols in search of graffiti,
cleaning it off buildings, telephone poles and utility boxes. He uses
chemicals to wipe marker scribblings off street signs and paint to
cover symbols sprayed onto walls. He has even climbed onto roofs to
remove writing visible from the Ventura Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Some graffiti vandals and gang members spray notes on walls,
saying: "You can't stop us." But Gaston paints over such messages,
returning to a site each time graffiti reappears.</TE>
<TE>   His work has had an effect. Average monthly calls to the city's
hotline dropped from 150 in 1995 when the program began to about 75
last year.</TE>
<TE>   "Kids get discouraged," said Rick Herriott, who supervises the
Public Works Department. "He's painted over areas so many times that
he has deterred them from coming back."</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard, Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks have similar hotline
programs. In 1993, Simi Valley hired a private contractor to remove
graffiti daily. Since then, the number of cases reported to the
city's hotline dropped from 4,038 to 768 in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   In Thousand Oaks, which began keeping records in 1995, the number
of graffiti incidents stayed around 350 until last year, when 569
cases were reported.</TE>
<TE>   Police say graffiti should be removed immediately to curb gang
activity and prevent a drop in property values.</TE>
<TE>   "Certain gang members will go into someone else's territory. They
will spray paint the walls and say they were here, what are you going
to do about it?" said Brian Bishop, graffiti investigator for the
Oxnard Police Department. "It's basically a challenge to the other
gang."</TE>
<TE>   Gaston starts his day at 6:30 a.m., working weekdays--except every
other Friday--until about 4 p.m. On his days off, other public works
employees cover for him.</TE>
<TE>   Each morning, Gaston checks messages on the hotline, then arranges
to visit each location reported within 24 to 48 hours. He also
patrols city streets, visiting frequently targeted areas.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent day, he checked a culvert off Anacapa Street,
inspected the sound walls along Highway 126 near Mound Elementary
School, and removed a racial epithet from a flood control channel
along Telegraph Road.</TE>
<TE>   The graffiti often reappears soon after he cleans it. Gaston said
he doesn't get discouraged.</TE>
<TE>   "There's always going to be teenagers. And as they grow up and
quit and grow out of it, there's always someone else who's going to
come and take their place. With the graffiti, at least we can clean
it up, and we can do it pretty quick."</TE>
<TE>   Gaston also works closely with the Ventura Police Department,
taking pictures of each graffiti vandal's name or symbol. Police can
then use that information as evidence in court.</TE>
<TE>   In Simi Valley, a youth was ordered to pay $9,200 in restitution
after being caught spray painting a number of places in town.</TE>
<TE>   It costs Ventura $74,000 annually to run the graffiti program,
including paint, brushes, rollers and other supplies, as well as
Gaston's salary and the maintenance of his city-owned truck.</TE>
<TE>   Gaston uses tan, white or gray paint to cover the markings. He
said he tries to work with property owners to match their buildings'
color when possible. To prevent a patchwork of squares, he often
paints an entire wall one color and then uses the same color to cover
graffiti that might later appear.</TE>
<TE>   He said most owners don't mind him painting their buildings. They
would rather see the graffiti cleaned up.</TE>
<TE>   Young Yun, owner of Westside Market on Ramona Street in Ventura,
is one of them. He calls the hotline at least once a month to have
graffiti removed from the side of his store. He said the removal
program helps his business.</TE>
<TE>   "When there is a lot of graffiti on the building, everybody is
scared. [They think] something's wrong," Yun said. "When the building
is clean, they are comfortable to come in here."</TE>

<HD>Larvae Infestation Forces Early Closure of Reservoir in
O.C.</HD>
<DH>Water: Warm weather hastens assault by the worm-like
midge. Shutdown is for 2 weeks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY ALLISON and SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Newport Beach has temporarily stopped using water from Big Canyon
Reservoir after several residents found midge larvae in their tap
water.</LD>
<LD>   Officials said the reservoir will be out of commission about two
weeks--the normal life cycle of the tiny, translucent insects.</LD>
<LD>   The worm-like creatures are no strangers to the reservoir as the
weather warms. The city usually closes the 22-million-gallon
reservoir in the spring when the larvae hatch. But the unseasonably
warm winter has caused the insects to arrive early, city officials
said.</LD>
<TE>   "This really does happen every year" as the weather gets warmer,
said Assistant City Manager Dave Kiff.</TE>
<TE>   The larvae, harmless to humans, appear as tiny drops in a glass of
water. Midge larvae, which infest water supplies worldwide, are 1/16-
to 1/8-inch long, smaller than a grain of rice.</TE>
<TE>   An adult can lay a gelatinous mass of up to 3,000 eggs, which
attach to various surfaces, such as the sides of reservoirs. After
the eggs hatch, the larvae sink to the bottom and feed on algae.</TE>
<TE>   City officials stopped using the reservoir Feb. 25 after residents
reported seeing the larvae in their tap water and toilets.</TE>
<TE>   "The only long-term solution is to have a cover, which won't allow
the cycle to start up in the first place," said City Manager Homer
Bludau.</TE>
<TE>   For five years, Newport Beach has been seeking outside sources for
the $4.5 million it would cost to put plastic over the reservoir.
Recently, officials enlisted the help of Rep. Christopher Cox
(R-Newport Beach) to secure federal funding for the cover.</TE>
<TE>   When the city initiated talks with Cox, "it wasn't our highest
priority. It's our highest priority with him now," Bludau said.</TE>
<TE>   Bludau said the Orange County Health Care Agency has urged that
the reservoir be covered. "It's only a matter of time before we have
to put a cover on," Bludau said.</TE>
<TE>   After Sept. 11, there was increased urgency to cover the reservoir
to protect the water from a possible bioterrorist attack, officials
said.</TE>

<LD>An Algerian detained with a former roommate of two Sept. 11 hijackers
was charged Tuesday with immigration document fraud.</LD>
<LD>   Samir Abdoun, 35, was detained Sept. 22 by agents of the FBI and
Immigration and Naturalization Service as he rode in a car with
Yazeed Al-Salmi. Al Salmi is a native of Saudi Arabia who rented a
room in the same Lemon Grove house as two of the men named as
terrorists who hijacked an American Airlines jet and crashed into the
Pentagon.</LD>
<LD>   A check of records showed that Abdoun had been ordered out of the
United States after the Border Patrol stopped him Nov. 7, 1998, at
the San Clemente checkpoint and found that he was traveling on a
fraudulent and expired tourist visa.</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. Attorney for San Diego charged Abdoun with five counts of
using fraudulent documents to enter, live and work in the United
States.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>REDWOOD CITY, Calif.</DL>
<LD>A Minnesota doctor accused of stabbing her son to death blurted out
in court Tuesday that she is guilty, saying she planned to commit the
murder and wanted to be punished for it, and asked for a death
sentence or life in prison, prosecutors said.</LD>
<LD>   A San Mateo County Superior Court judge did not accept the
outburst as a guilty plea, and instead had Donna Anderson removed
from court when she refused to stop talking during the hearing. He
granted a defense attorney's request to have a psychiatrist evaluate
Anderson.</LD>
<LD>   Anderson, 48, is being held in the San Mateo County Jail's medical
ward on charges that she stabbed her son, Stephen Burns, to death on
Feb. 24 in her ex-husband's Burlingame home. She also is accused of
stabbing her ex-husband, Frank Burns, while he tried to restrain her.</LD>

may pursue an insanity defense.</TE>

<HD>Device Speeds Up Border Crossings</HD>
<DH>Technology: Demand is rising for system that IDs
pre-screened motorists, allowing them to avoid long post-Sept. 11
lines.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEN ELLINGWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Long lines resulting from tighter border security since Sept. 11 have
created a big surge in demand for a high-tech device that allows
pre-screened motorists to avoid lengthy delays as they enter the
United States.</LD>
<LD>   Making use of a transponder, the fast-pass system, which was
introduced at the border several years ago, is similar to one used on
Southern California toll roads. But perhaps nowhere has the
computerized device received such a warm welcome as at the border,
where waiting times in the weeks after the terror attacks soared to
four hours or more.</LD>
<LD>   The waits have diminished to less than two hours during the
morning commute. But the scramble to apply for the $129-a-year
passes, which can cut the crossing time to a few minutes, has risen.</LD>
<TE>   Applicants must undergo a criminal background check and prove that
they can enter the United States legally. A car, outfitted with a
transponder, signals a computer at the inspection booth and the
screen flashes a photograph of the subscriber and information about
the vehicle. The prior screening means that the inspector has less
need to ask questions, a time-consuming prerequisite for crossing the
border.</TE>
<TE>   Enrollment in the program, known as SENTRI, has grown to more than
13,700 in San Diego. The number of new applications has more than
doubled since September, to about 7,000.</TE>
<TE>   In El Paso, the only other spot on the Southwest border with such
an express-lane system, pending applications have risen sixfold to
about 1,200, officials said. About 8,000 motorists are enrolled
there.</TE>
<TE>   Frequent crossers who once considered the passes an intriguing
novelty now view them as essential.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to get it. We're not thinking about it any more--we're
going to get it," said Alma Belloso, a Chula Vista resident who
stopped by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service office in
Otay Mesa recently for an application.</TE>
<TE>   Belloso said she, her husband and their two children had stopped
visiting relatives in Tijuana since September out of fear of long
border delays.</TE>
<TE>   Though SENTRI subscribers make up a slim portion of the about
41,000 cars entering daily at San Ysidro, immigration officials see
the high-tech system as a key part of a strategy to ease ever-growing
border traffic. They are considering doubling the number of the
specially outfitted lanes at San Ysidro from two to four.</TE>
<TE>   The sudden demand has swamped the INS border office and, to the
dismay of some express commuters, produced slightly longer waits in
the special lanes. Inspectors at San Ysidro said the early morning
wait has grown to about 15 minutes, longer than before Sept. 11, but
still barely a fraction of the delays facing commuters in the 22
remaining lanes for cars and buses.</TE>
<TE>   Adele J. Fasano, director of the INS office in San Diego, has
proposed expanding the number of commuter lanes at San Ysidro. She
said a proposed new port of entry near Otay Mesa probably would
include such technology. The system was introduced two years ago at
San Ysidro, the nation's busiest entry point. It was put in place at
the crossing at Otay Mesa in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Fasano said current facilities can accommodate as many as 30,000
subscribers. "The focus now is getting as many people as possible.
We're trying to strike a balance," she said.</TE>
<TE>   At the INS office, 11 enrollees waited to receive the plastic
transponders, which resemble garage-door openers.</TE>
<TE>   Tijuana resident Maria Escobar, who drives her son to private
school on the U.S. side, said the delays have taken a toll on both of
them. Escobar, 31, was eager to join other parents in the fast lane:
"The other mothers at my son's school say your life changes after
SENTRI."</TE>

<HD>Payment of Ex-Compton Mayor's Legal Fees, Back Wages
Challenged</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE BERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A lawsuit aimed at blocking the public payment of $840,000 in legal
fees incurred by former Compton Mayor Omar Bradley was filed Tuesday
in Los Angeles Superior Court.</LD>
<LD>   The suit, challenging the recent Compton City Council vote to pay
Bradley's fees for fighting the city's June election results, also
seeks to prevent Bradley from receiving $43,000 in back pay.</LD>
<LD>   "The city can't just give $840,000 in attorney fees to anyone
without a legal obligation to do so," said Pasadena lawyer Glenn
Rothner, who filed the suit on behalf of Compton Fire Department
employee Margaret Mitchell.</LD>
<TE>   Rothner said the legal fees and back wages amount to "an unlawful
gift of public funds."</TE>
<TE>   Bradley's attorney, Bradley Hertz, who is listed as a defendant in
the suit, could not be reached for comment. Rothner also named the
city of Compton as a defendant.</TE>
<TE>   Bradley, who was defeated in his reelection bid last year by Eric
Perrodin, returned to office for a brief stint last month after he
successfully challenged the election results in Los Angeles County
Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   Days later, the state's 2nd District Court of Appeal reinstated
Perrodin, pending the outcome of his appeal. That same day, the City
Council voted 3 to 1 to pay Bradley's legal fees and back wages.
Perrodin has said one of his goals in office would be to address the
council's decision to make the payments.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit says Bradley is not entitled to legal fees because the
electoral challenge is pending in court. Further, by awarding the
fees, the council has illegally taken Bradley's side in the court
challenge to Perrodin's election, the suit said.</TE>
<TE>   Rothner also challenged the back pay because he says Bradley "made
no valid claim" for it. He noted that the court, in overturning
Perrodin's election, did not order the council to provide Bradley
with pay for the period in which he did not serve as mayor.</TE>

<HD>Hatching of Condor Egg Eagerly Awaited</HD>
<DH>Nature: Emergence of chick in Ventura County cave would
show the birds can breed without human aid.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CHAWKINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Unbridled passions, misplaced love, betrayal, murderous cruelty, the
other woman: Nobody ever said courtship was easy, but for California
condors in Ventura County's rugged back country, just hatching an egg
is a saga of Shakespearean intensity.</LD>
<LD>   Even so, mom, dad and condor-to-be are said to be doing fine. If
all goes well, the incipient chick will be only the second hatched in
the wild since the start of the government's breeding program for the
huge, all-but-extinct birds in the mid-1980s. The blessed event is
due in mid-April.</LD>
<LD>   Jubilant biologists for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service this
week disclosed their discovery of the pale-blue egg, equal in size to
about four hen's eggs, and the surprising commitment of the parents
to hatching it.</LD>
<TE>   "They don't have any role models," said Bronwyn Davey, a
spokeswoman for the wildlife agency. "We didn't even know whether
they knew enough to nest in caves."</TE>
<TE>   If the chick thrives, it will send scientists a clear message,
Davey said: "It would mean we'd be less likely to do any manipulation
in the future. We'd monitor but not interfere. This would give us
more confidence that the condors can do these things on their own."</TE>
<TE>   The egg comes from the union of a female named R8 and a male,
W-Zero. But the story really starts before their relationship had
matured, a time in a Santa Barbara County condor refuge when W-Zero
had a thing going not just with R8 but also a certain female called
R11.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the breeding program, the three had been born in
captivity and set free in the arid wilderness seven years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the two females each coupled with W-Zero and laid an
egg. But according to scientists, their menage a trois was a disaster
for all.</TE>
<TE>   "The three of them shared incubating duties but seemed to be
confused about which egg to sit on," Davey said.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, one egg dried up. The other was snatched by
biologists, who substituted a counterfeit the same color and size.
The real egg was placed in an incubator at the Los Angeles Zoo and
was placed back into the nest shortly before a chick pecked its way
out of the shell.</TE>
<TE>   The deception ended in tragedy, though, with the young bird
apparently bitten to death by R11.</TE>
<TE>   This year, scientists kept the murderous mom in a holding pen
during breeding season.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the two others had winged their way to the Hopper
Mountain National Wildlife Refuge outside Fillmore. The condors are
nesting in a cave on a sandstone cliff.</TE>
<TE>   Watching them for several weeks through telescopes, biologists
worried that W-Zero had no interest in putting in time on the egg, a
customary duty for male birds.</TE>
<TE>   But on Feb. 18, when one of the scientists rappelled 75 feet down
the cliff to grab the egg and replace it with a phony, W-Zero was
plopped on the nest. Shaking out his massive wings, he refused to
leave.</TE>
<TE>   "He made this deep hissing sound, this kind of defensive grunt,"
said Mike Barth, an agency biologist who was peering down the rock
face as another scientist hopped into the cave. "It's real
intimidating when they're in that posture. You don't want to try to
reach in and get the egg."</TE>
<TE>   Biologists will keep an eye on the nesting couple from afar, Barth
said.</TE>
<TE>   The largest birds in North America, condors can have a wingspan of
more than 9 feet. By 1982, only 22 California condors were left,
prompting the government to collect chicks and eggs for its breeding
program.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the condor population includes 64 at wilderness sites in
California and Arizona, with an additional 100 in facilities in Los
Angeles, San Diego and Boise, Idaho.</TE>

<HD>State Ordered to Not Collect Doctor Data</HD>
<DH>Court: A judge rejects HMO regulators' argument that
financial information is needed so the public can know if medical
groups are near insolvency.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Superior Court judge in Sacramento has ruled that the state's HMO
regulators cannot collect or distribute information on the financial
stability of medical groups.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Gail D. Ohanesian rejected the state's argument that the
public has a right to know if doctors' organizations are on the verge
of insolvency, calling the state's regulations arbitrary and
capricious.</LD>
<LD>   She sided with the California Medical Assn., which filed a suit in
September. The ruling marks the latest in a string of legal defeats
for the Department of Managed Health Care, which has been criticized
by doctors and health plans for exceeding its authority.</LD>
<TE>   The department's director, Daniel Zingale, said the decision is a
stinging defeat for consumers. Without data, patients will be left
unprepared if their doctors' group folds, he said. The ruling, dated
Feb. 28, was released Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The order "essentially puts us back to where we started--without
any regulation or oversight of medical groups," Zingale said. "I
thought there was broad agreement that this was not a good situation,
certainly not for patients."</TE>
<TE>   The California Medical Assn. said it was not seeking to prevent
Zingale's agency from collecting the data for its own use, nor was it
trying to prevent regulators from disclosing in general terms whether
individual medical groups passed solvency standards.</TE>
<TE>   It simply objected to detailed disclosures of proprietary
information, said President Dr. John M. Whitelaw of Sacramento. If
such data were released, health plans would be able to manipulate
groups during contract negotiations, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Privately owned groups have a right to keep their detailed
financial information private," Whitelaw said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Whitelaw's insistence that the medical association was
only objecting to disclosure, the judge ruled that the information
could not even be collected. Attorneys for the Department of Managed
Health Care had argued that state law prevented the agency from
keeping data it collected secret.</TE>
<TE>   Bill's Intent Called Unclear</TE>
<TE>   In her ruling, Ohanesian said it was not entirely clear what the
Legislature intended in 1999 when it passed Senate Bill 260, which
regulated medical groups' financial solvency. The judge said she was
swayed, though, by a letter from state Sen. Jackie Speier
(D-Hillsborough), which supported the California Medical Assn.'s
position.</TE>
<TE>   "It flew in the face of what we were trying to do," Speier said
Tuesday, explaining that the bill's purpose was to give regulators
the tools to help medical groups, not to expose their weaknesses
publicly.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last few years, physician group failures have disrupted
care and caused confusion for millions of patients statewide. In the
most publicized of those failures, Anaheim-based KPC Medical
Management went bankrupt in November 2000, leaving 250,000 people in
Southern California temporarily without medical care.</TE>
<TE>   Data collected by the state last year indicated that the problem
has not gone away. Nearly a quarter of California's physicians groups
fell far short of the state's financial solvency requirements in the
first months of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer Groups Condemn Ruling</TE>
<TE>   Zingale has said on several occasions that he can't understand
opposition to public disclosure given the high-profile collapse of
several medical groups in the state. If doctors see that their group
is having problems, perhaps they will take more aggressive steps to
shore up its financial health, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer groups condemned the ruling, saying that if medical
groups want to take on financial risk like insurers, then they are
obligated to prove that they can handle it.</TE>
<TE>   "The decision guts the law that protects consumers from failing
medical groups," said Anthony Wright, a spokesman for Health Access,
an umbrella organization in Sacramento promoting health-care reform.</TE>
<TE>   Insurance industry representatives agreed that the state needs to
review information on medical group finances to protect the public.
"It's hard to see how it can carry out the function of consumer
protection and early warning about financial difficulty in medical
groups if it can't collect information from them," said Walter
Zelman, president of the California Assn. of Health Plans.</TE>
<TE>   The 21-month-old Department of Managed Health Care has lost
several lawsuits that challenged its authority over the managed care
industry. In January, a judge in Sacramento ruled that the agency
could not force Blue Shield of California to provide a weight-loss
drug to an obese member. In July 2001, another judge said the state
could not require Kaiser Permanente to cover Viagra or other
sexual-dysfunction drugs.</TE>

<HD>Back to Basics for College Buildings</HD>
<DH>Policy: L.A. district's 'green' construction plan includes
windows that open and trees that offer cooling shade.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART SILVERSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What will new college buildings look like in the technology-mad early
21st century?</LD>
<LD>   Maybe not as space-agey as you think. As envisioned by the leaders
of the Los Angeles Community College District, cutting-edge and
environmentally friendly campus architecture will embody about as
much old-fashioned practicality as high-tech gadgetry.</LD>
<LD>   A plan expected to be approved by the district's Board of Trustees
today to guide the use of $1.2 billion in school-bond funds for 40 to
50 new buildings would encourage such design wizardry as:</LD>
<TE>   * Windows that actually open and close.</TE>
<TE>   * Trees that shade buildings and help keep them cool.</TE>
<TE>   * Roofing made from light-reflecting recycled materials--including
old toilet bowls and sinks.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of it is common sense. But a lot of our campuses are so old
that common sense is visionary," said Kelly Candaele, a trustee of
the nine-campus college district.</TE>
<TE>   Even if some of the proposed techniques sound old hat, the
district already is winning praise from many environmentalists for
its "sustainable building," or "green building," plan.</TE>
<TE>   The design specifics have yet to be spelled out for the new
buildings to be financed with the $1.2 billion from voters' passage
last year of Proposition A. Construction is expected to start next
year on the first of the projects, which are likely to include a
media arts building and library at Valley College, a science building
at Los Angeles City College and a student center at West Los Angeles
College.</TE>
<TE>   But the proposed approach reflects the nation's "sustainable
community" movement, with its emphasis on conserving resources and
placing as gentle a burden as possible on the environment.</TE>
<TE>   The aim also is to ensure that new buildings provide healthy
workplaces, free of such ills as indoor air pollution.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Templeton, a project manager for the U.S. Green Building
Council, a nonprofit group that certifies buildings meeting key
environmental standards, called the community college district's plan
perhaps the most environmentally ambitious by any higher education
system in the country.</TE>
<TE>   If a room needs to be cooled, there will be options besides
turning on electricity-gobbling air conditioners. You could just open
a window--or, in a concession to high-tech, windows might
automatically open when temperatures hit a certain level.</TE>
<TE>   Also, to save precious water, more athletic fields might be
covered with artificial turf, and landscaping will feature
drought-resistant plants. Meanwhile, restrictions on the use of
paints that emit toxic fumes would be tightened.</TE>
<TE>   If board members approve the sustainable building plan, "they are
voting to give students a healthier learning environment and to save
taxpayer dollars in lower energy costs in the long term," said Matt
Petersen, president of Global Green U.S.A., a Los Angeles-based
environmental group.</TE>
<TE>   But not everyone is ready to embrace the plan. One touchy point is
that the standards in the plan are expected to raise construction
costs an estimated 8% to 10%.</TE>
<TE>   That, in turn, may mean that voters won't be getting as many
buildings as they anticipated when they approved Proposition A, said
Kris Vosburgh, executive director of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers
Assn. The district, he said, "may be skating on very thin legal ice."</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, district trustee Nancy Pearlman, a longtime
environmental activist, said she doesn't think the district's plan
goes far enough.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, she would like it to do more to ensure that new
buildings are made with recycled materials. "I want to be sure we're
not cutting down the rain forest," she said.</TE>
<TE>   District Chancellor Marshall "Mark" Drummond defends the use of
taxpayer money for sustainable building standards on two grounds. For
one thing, he said, voters were never promised that a specific number
of buildings would be put up with funds from Proposition A.</TE>
<TE>   Secondly, he said, the savings from sustainable buildings that use
less electricity and water will enable the district to recover the
extra construction expenses in five to seven years.</TE>
<TE>   Assuming that most buildings will have a life span of about 30
years, he said, "you've got 23 years of good news, because you're
saving money all of those years."</TE>
<TE>   Sylvia Scott-Hayes, board president, echoed that view. "For too
long, because educational institutions have not had the money, they
really have not had the luxury of doing what's in the best interest
for the future.... We're trying to do things a little differently."</TE>

<HD>Dogs in Fatal Attack Called Friendly</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The two dogs that mauled a San Francisco woman were normally
friendly, calm and well-behaved, according to witnesses who testified
as the defense began presenting its case Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   One defense witnesses described the dogs as sweet and beautiful.
Several witnesses said they never saw the dogs growl, bite or lunge
at anyone.</LD>
<LD>   "They didn't behave in any way different than a normal, friendly
dog would," said Allan Paul, owner of a brew pub that the dogs'
owners, defendants Marjorie Knoller and Robert Noel, frequented with
the two Presa Canarios.</LD>
<TE>   The testimony offered a picture of the dogs that contrasted
sharply with what jurors had heard during the first two weeks of the
trial.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of prosecution witnesses described terrifying encounters
they had with the massive dogs. Several testified that the dogs had
jumped at them, and one reported a dog had bitten him on the
buttocks.</TE>
<TE>   Diane Whipple, a 33-year-old lacrosse coach, died Jan. 26, 2001,
after being attacked by the dogs in the hallway of her apartment
building. The dogs, Bane and Hera, have been destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   Knoller and Noel, who were Whipple's neighbors, are being tried in
Los Angeles County Superior Court on charges of involuntary
manslaughter and keeping a mischievous dog. Knoller, 46, also faces a
second-degree murder charge and could receive a prison sentence of 15
years to life. Noel faces a possible sentence of four years.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors argue that the couple knew the dogs were vicious and
did not heed advice to put muzzles or choke chains on them.</TE>
<TE>   But defense attorneys maintain that Knoller and Noel were
responsible owners who kept their dogs under control. The attack on
Whipple was unexpected, they say.</TE>
<TE>   Paul, owner of the San Francisco Brewing Company, told jurors that
Noel and Knoller came to his pub two or three times a week and often
had one or both of the dogs by their side.</TE>
<TE>   Paul said that the couple usually sat by the main entrance with
the dogs outside and that the dogs never misbehaved.</TE>
<TE>   When asked by Noel's attorney, Bruce Hotchkiss, whether the dogs
got along with his customers, Paul said, "Always ... or I would have
asked them to leave."</TE>
<TE>   Another witness, a veterinarian who conducted a physical exam and
vaccinated Hera in April 2000, described the dog as very calm.</TE>
<TE>   Stephanie Flowers, the veterinarian, said Hera did not bite or
lunge at her or a technician during a 25-minute session. Flowers
added that she was able to clean Hera's ear without sedating the
animal.</TE>
<TE>   "I praised her for tolerating the procedure as well as she did,"
Flowers said.</TE>
<TE>   The dog had a heart murmur and was emaciated at the time of the
examination, Flowers said.</TE>
<TE>   Bonnie Seats, a longtime friend of the couple, testified that she
first encountered Hera in August 2000 when she visited with Knoller
and Noel in front of their apartment building on Pacific Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   Seats said she knelt down, rubbed Hera's ears and stroked her fur.
"She is just a sweet girl," she testified she had told the couple.</TE>
<TE>   During a brief cross-examination, the witnesses acknowledged they
did not know how the dogs behaved inside the apartment building where
Noel, Knoller and Whipple lived.</TE>

<HD>3 Storms May Hit Area by Sunday</HD>
<DH>Weather: The rain would follow one of the driest Februaries
on record.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC MALNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two Pacific storm systems are expected to bring much-needed rain to
Southern California tonight and Thursday, and there's a chance of
more rain from a third storm Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   None of these high-altitude storms looks big enough to put a
serious dent in the prolonged winter dry spell, "but at least they're
coming in a series, and that's the first time that's happened in
quite a while," said Bruce Rockwell, a National Weather Service
meteorologist.</LD>
<LD>   The first two storms should move down the coast, one right behind
the other, arriving in the Southland this afternoon and early
Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   "Right now, the air here is so dry that rain from the first storm,
which is pretty high, might just evaporate on the way down," Rockwell
said. "But sometimes, it takes the first storm to get the air moist,
and then the rain from the second will reach the ground."</TE>
<TE>   He said about a quarter of an inch of rain should fall in the Los
Angeles area by Friday, with snow in the mountains above 4,500 feet.</TE>
<TE>   Skies should clear Friday and Saturday, with a return of the dry
offshore winds so familiar this winter, before the arrival of the
third storm Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still too early to tell how much rain we'll get from that
one," Rockwell said.</TE>
<TE>   Vagaries in the high-altitude jet stream winds that propel storm
systems across the Pacific are making it difficult to anticipate
exactly what will happen, forecasters said. The stream is currently
split, and the southern branch is picking up tropical moisture that
is being funneled toward Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   If the arrival of this moisture coincides with the arrival of the
storms, rainfall could increase. Some of the Weather Service's
computer models say that will happen; some say it won't.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, total rainfall for the season, which runs from
July 1 through June 30, currently stands at 3.95 inches. That
compares with a normal for the date of 11.31 inches.</TE>
<TE>   Last month was one of the driest and warmest Februaries on record.</TE>
<TE>   In downtown Los Angeles, it only rained one day--Feb. 17--and only
0.29 of an inch of rain fell. That compares to a normal total for the
month of 3.55 inches. In the record-setting February 1998, 13.68
inches of rain fell on the Civic Center.</TE>
<TE>   The average temperature in Los Angeles last month was about 60
degrees, about eight degrees warmer than normal.</TE>

<HD>O.C.'s Anti-Airport Measure W Leads; Supervisor Coad Trails</HD>
<DH>Races: The park initiative is way ahead; chairwoman's loss could be
2nd airport setback.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT MARTELLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After years of acrimonious debate and three prior ballot showdowns,
Orange County voters Tuesday appeared to block plans for an international
airport at the former El Toro Marine base by rezoning the 4,700-acre site
as parkland, according to early election returns.</LD>
<LD>   In a further display of anti-airport sentiment, Board of Supervisors
Chairwoman Cynthia P. Coad was trailing in her reelection campaign, which
threatened to reverse the panel's long-standing pro-airport majority.</LD>
<LD>   The early Measure W results elated anti-airport activists as
pro-airport forces began discussing possible next steps--including a
legal challenge and yet another initiative to undo Measure W.</LD>
<TE>   Barring those efforts, passage of the ballot measure would make it
exceedingly difficult for pro-airport forces to realize their vision of
an international hub in the heart of Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be very hard for it to proceed," said Jack Pitney, a
Republican analyst and professor of government at Claremont McKenna
College. "In politics you never say never, but sooner or later political
reality can block any project. . . . My sense is that one should not
place a lot of money on the El Toro airport being built."</TE>
<TE>   On a sparkling late-winter day, Orange County's voter turnout was
light--about 22.5% by early evening--but in keeping with past off-year
primaries, despite the high-profile statewide Republican gubernatorial
primary.</TE>
<TE>   There was plenty of electoral drama. In a rematch from four years ago,
Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas took an early lead and claimed victory in his
tough reelection fight against one of his deputies, Wally Wade. And in
one of the day's odder races, a bevy of write-in candidates appeared to
have forced accused child molester Ronald C. Kline into a runoff election
for his Orange County Superior Court seat.</TE>
<TE>   The key issue of the day, though, centered on what to do with the
former El Toro Marine base--the fourth time the issue has gone before
voters.</TE>
<TE>   "I voted yes to kill the airport idea once and for all," said Jim
King, 34, of Seal Beach, who supported Measure W even though he doubted
El Toro is suitable for a park. "I think there is a lot of toxic waste
there and an airport is one of the only things that land can be used for.
But that's not a good enough reason to build an LAX here in O.C."</TE>
<TE>   Airport supporters said Measure W does nothing to address the region's
pressing need for air capacity.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we need a regional airport at El Toro, with the development
of South County and the tremendous increase in population," said Jane
Atencio, 60, a Newport Beach Republican. "John Wayne [Airport] can't
handle it."</TE>
<TE>   Measure W would rezone the 4,700-acre former base for use primarily as
a large urban park, undoing the initial 1994 measure that zoned the area
for a commercial airport and launched waves of political bickering.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday night, Measure W supporters packed into a Laguna Hills Holiday
Inn ballroom reacted jubilantly as absentee returns showed an early and
comfortable lead.</TE>
<TE>   "This will kill the airport, and hopefully we can get onto other
issues that are important to Orange County," said L. Allan Songstad Jr.,
a Laguna Hills Councilman.</TE>
<TE>   He urged the county to unite as it accepts the air base from the U.S.
Navy.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the Navy is going to see that we have a plan to move forward,
and that the property is not going to be in limbo," Songstad said. "There
is an end to this issue for them, too."</TE>
<TE>   Len Kranser, spokesman for Citizens for Safe and Healthy Communities,
the group that raised money for Measure W, said its passage leaves the
airport proposal "politically dead."</TE>
<TE>   "The Board of Supervisors might as well stop wasting money on it," he
said. "This vote will be the final nail in the coffin for the airport."</TE>
<TE>   At Newport Beach's Villa Nova restaurant, airport supporters waited
for election results with a sense of resigned foreboding. Bruce Nestande,
a former county supervisor and director of the pro-airport Citizens for
Jobs and the Economy, fretted about the amount of money the anti-airport
forces spent to push the measure.</TE>
<TE>   "The ability to get your message out increases your chance of
winning," Nestande said.</TE>
<TE>   The debate has largely pitted south against north, with South County
residents opposing plans to make a commercial airport out of the air
base, built during World War II amid bean fields adjoining what is now
Irvine, Tustin and Lake Forest.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly $100 million--most of it public money--has been spent on
advertising and lobbying over the years, making El Toro one of the
nation's most expensive land-use battles.</TE>
<TE>   More battles are likely. The Airport Working Group of Orange County,
based in Newport Beach, has threatened to challenge Measure W in court as
it seeks an El Toro airport to relieve pressure for expansion of John
Wayne Airport, whose flight paths carry jets over Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   The tenor of the El Toro debate changed last year with the appointment
of Newport Beach billionaire George Argyros as President Bush's
ambassador to Spain. Argyros' departure bled the pro-airport group of
both energy and money as the anti-airport coalition raised nearly $2.5
million to mount a nonstop campaign touting the "Great Park" Measure W
alternative to an airport.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's vote came on the eve of the U.S. Navy's release of an
environmental review of plans to convert the base from military use. It
was not immediately clear how passage of Measure W would affect the
Navy's handing-off of the property to Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   The five-member Board of Supervisors, which favors an airport by a 3-2
majority, will determine how the base is redeveloped. But Measure W's
approval would bar the supervisors from building an airport.</TE>
<TE>   The composition of the board--and its pro-airport majority--hung in
the balance Tuesday, with 4th District Supervisor Coad trailing Fullerton
Councilman Chris Norby in a race affected by both El Toro and
redistricting. Norby opposes the airport; Coad favors it.</TE>
<TE>   Redrawn boundaries after the 2000 Census removed Anaheim and parts of
Anaheim Hills and Orange--Coad strongholds--from the 4th District and
added Fullerton, Norby's home base.</TE>
<TE>   Some Fullerton voters, though, turned their backs on Norby.</TE>
<TE>   "I voted for Coad because she's the incumbent and I'm pleased with the
job she's done," said Greg Eyre, 42.</TE>
<TE>   As the vote counts went on, Norby and his supporters watched as he
shifted from trailing to leading. The pace of excitement picked up as the
time slipped past.</TE>
<TE>   Norby, a teacher at Brea Olinda High School who had taken February off
to campaign, said he'd given it everything he had. "The voters will
decide, but I don't know what more I could have done."</TE>
<TE>   After the polls closed, Coad and her husband, Tom, who also is her
campaign manager, thanked her campaign staff at a dinner in Anaheim. By
late evening, Coad, tired and foot-sore from walking precincts in the
campaign's final days, debated whether to attend an election party hosted
by county Republicans at a Newport Beach hotel.</TE>
<TE>   "Look, I plan to go to bed and wake up tomorrow and find out who won,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Even if Coad prevailed, it might not be good news for airport
supporters. Coad and fellow Supervisor Jim Silva--two of the
three-pro-airport votes--have said they will drop the issue if Measure W
passes.</TE>
<TE>   "I think everybody is looking at this to be the final decision," Coad
said. "If Measure W passes, it changes the zoning. The only way to get
that changed back would be to have another vote."</TE>
<TE>   Measure W wasn't the only emotion-driven issue on the ballot. In the
race for Orange County district attorney, a contentious battle exposed
deep rifts among the more than 200 prosecutors in the office and led to
the defection of challenger Wade's campaign manager.</TE>
<TE>   About 10:30 p.m., Rackauckas--holding a comfortable lead--delivered a
brief acceptance speech to about 200 supporters gathered in an expansive
suite at the Sutton Place Hotel in Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just very gratified and humbled by the vote of confidence you
have given me and the voters have given me," Rackauckas said.</TE>
<TE>   Wade struck a note of conciliation and said he wanted to be able to
work with his boss in the future.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope he's going to realize that our office can't function unless
we're unified," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, the race was a rerun of the 1998 campaign in which
Rackauckas, then a Superior Court judge, won 62% of the vote to 38% for
Wade, a top assistant under departing Dist. Atty. Mike Capizzi.</TE>
<TE>   In the current race, Rackauckas raised twice as much money as Wade,
but a spate of controversies within the district attorney's office kept
the race close. A Times poll had the race in a dead heat with more voters
undecided than committed to either candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Not all the ballot issues were lightning rods. In the little-noted
Measure V election, early returns showed voters approving a subtle but
fundamental shift in the way county government works.</TE>
<TE>   Most of California's 58 counties--including Orange County--operate
under authority of the state Legislature. The rest operate under
voter-approved charters, which give county officials more freedom in how
the administration works, such as filling job vacancies and other
housekeeping issues.</TE>
<TE>   The driving element behind Measure V, though, was county Supervisor
Todd Spitzer's desire to wrest the filling of vacant seats--most likely
his--from the governor's office and give it to voters in the local
district. Spitzer is seeking election to the 71st Assembly District seat,
and if he wins, he wants voters in his county supervisorial district to
select his successor. Beyond the overt issue of who should fill the
vacancy runs the subtler issues of party politics and El Toro. Under the
existing format, Democratic Gov. Gray Davis could appoint a pro-airport
Democrat to replace Spitzer, an anti-airport Republican.</TE>
<TE>   In one notable municipal election, incumbent Seal Beach Councilman
Shawn Boyd, representing the Old Town and Surfside districts, appeared
destined for a runoff in his attempt to win reelection in a four-way race
clouded by conflict-of-interest allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Early returns showed Boyd running second to challenger Charles Antos,
though neither had enough votes to win outright.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County district attorney's office is investigating
complaints that Boyd voted on the city-financed purchase of a mobile home
park by a nonprofit group despite having a business relationship with the
park's owner, Richard Hall.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation focuses on $104,000 that Hall paid Boyd for other
business dealings but that Boyd allegedly failed to disclose as required
by law.</TE>
<TE>   Boyd admitted during several campaign appearances to making mistakes
but asked voters to overlook those problems and focus on his record of
service to the city. While the campaign had the potential for
mudslinging, Boyd's opponents--Antos, Beverly Pearce and Walt
Miller--refrained from attacking him on the allegations.</TE>

<HD>Bush to Impose Tariffs on Steel in Rescue Move</HD>
<DH>Trade: Plan to save U.S. industry could have major economic and
political repercussions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WARREN VIETH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush announced plans Tuesday to impose tariffs of up to
30% on imported steel products, a protective move that will ripple
through the U.S. economy and roil domestic and international politics.</LD>
<LD>   The rescue plan, which takes effect March 20 and phases out after
three years, is designed to buy time for struggling U.S. steelmakers to
retool themselves to compete more effectively against heavily protected
foreign producers.</LD>
<LD>   But it will do so by inflating costs for manufacturers and consumers
of finished products from road graders to waffle irons and could wind up
endangering more jobs in those industries than it preserves in U.S. steel
mills.</LD>
<TE>   "I take this action to give our domestic steel industry an opportunity
to adjust to surges in foreign imports, recognizing the harm from 50
years of foreign government intervention in the global steel market,"
Bush said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said his plan would not harm the U.S. economy. But administration
officials acknowledged that it would cause steel prices to rise, perhaps
as much as 10%. At least some of the increase will be passed to consumers
in the form of higher prices on autos, appliances and other durable
goods.</TE>
<TE>   The political consequences are likely to be substantial. Bush's
decision is expected to improve the prospects of pending trade
legislation in Congress and might influence the outcome of elections in
key steel-producing districts. But it could anger steel consumers,
alienate free-trade advocates and trigger retaliatory moves by exporting
countries.</TE>
<TE>   "President Bush, who pledged to lead the world to free trade . . . has
departed from his principles to curry political favor," said Jon Jenson,
chairman of the Consuming Industries Trade Action Coalition, a
Washington-based manufacturers group. Jenson said the tariffs and quotas
constitute "a new tax on American manufactured products."</TE>
<TE>EU Threatens to Erect Its Own Barriers</TE>
<TE>   Bush's intervention was condemned as well by government and industry
officials in steel-exporting countries. The European Union said it would
file an immediate complaint with the World Trade Organization and
indicated that it might erect barriers to protect its own steelmakers
until the matter is settled.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. decision to go down the route of protectionism is a major
setback for the world trading system," EU Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy
said in a statement. "We will take whatever measures are necessary to
safeguard our own market."</TE>
<TE>   Lamy said the action would scuttle ongoing negotiations among members
of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to
voluntarily eliminate excess steel production capacity.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's plan will apply temporary tariffs of 8% to 30% on many
categories of imported steel. It exempts steel produced by Canada and
Mexico, America's partners in the North American Free Trade Agreement, as
well as imports from smaller developing countries.</TE>
<TE>   It will hit hardest at big exporters, including Japan, South Korea,
Germany, Brazil, China, Taiwan and France--each of which shipped more
than $500 million worth of steel products to the United States last year.</TE>
<TE>   The plan falls short of the 40%, across-the-board tariffs sought by
U.S. steel companies, many of which are struggling to survive in an
environment of depressed prices, chronic overproduction and cutthroat
competition. Imports currently account for roughly one-fourth of overall
U.S. steel consumption.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last four years, 31 steel companies have entered bankruptcy
proceedings. Most are aging, high-cost integrated producers, such as
Bethlehem Steel Corp., that process iron ore into finished products. The
administration's plan is unlikely to restore them to profitability, but
it could provide them with more breathing room to restructure and
consolidate.</TE>
<TE>   Newer, more efficient "mini-mill" operators, such as Nucor Corp., that
recycle scrap metal also will benefit from the import restrictions.
Industry analysts say the tariffs could enable them to expand operations
and capture even more market share from the integrated companies.</TE>
<TE>   The administration also rebuffed a request by the big companies to
pick up a portion of the $13 billion in "legacy costs" associated with
generous health and pension benefits they are obligated to pay their
retirees.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the decision was applauded by U.S. steelmakers and their
supporters on Capitol Hill, particularly lawmakers representing Steel
Belt constituents in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland and
West Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   Industry advocates cautioned that the plan, by itself, may not be
enough. "The American steel industry is drowning 40 feet offshore," said
Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.). "The president has thrown them a 30-foot
rope."</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials are gambling that the political benefits of
coming to the aid of an embattled industry and its workers will outweigh
the costs, which may diminish if the United States enjoys a robust
economic recovery. But its calculations could go awry if prices soar,
downstream job losses multiply or exporting countries embark on a trade
war.</TE>
<TE>Globalization Seen as Detriment to Industry</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick said the rescue effort was
consistent with the administration's free-trade objectives and addressed
some of the excesses of globalization.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of this change frightens people, and it leads to anxiety,"
Zoellick said. "If we're going to promote a free-trade agenda around the
world and have support for it at home, we have to be willing . . . to
help those industries that have really gotten flattened."</TE>
<TE>   A study by the nonpartisan Institute for International Economics in
Washington estimates that a package of tariffs in the 20% range would
cause the average price of imported steel to rise 6.6% and domestic steel
2.6%.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Morici, former chief economist at the International Trade
Commission, the U.S. government agency that recommended tariffs, said the
extensive involvement of foreign governments in global steel production
had distorted the forces of supply and demand to the detriment of U.S.
steelmakers.</TE>
<TE>   "In the steel market, the laws of economics don't work," said Morici,
who now teaches international business at the University of Maryland.
"The reality is this industry is not competing on a level playing field.
They are really at a competitive disadvantage on account of government
policy, not on account of economics."</TE>
<TE>   The protective tariffs and quotas are being imposed under a trade law
provision known as Section 201, which allows the government to erect
trade barriers if a domestic industry is threatened with serious injury
as a result of rising imports.</TE>
<TE>   During the 2000 presidential campaign, Bush promised to protect U.S.
steelmakers and their workers from unfair foreign competition, and he
initiated the Section 201 process after taking office. The U.S.
International Trade Commission conducted an investigation and concluded
that protective measures were justified.</TE>
<TE>Biggest Levies on 'Flat Products'</TE>
<TE>   "We're a free-trading nation," Bush told reporters after a meeting
with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. "In order to remain a free-trading
nation, we must enforce the law, and that's exactly what I did."</TE>
<TE>   The biggest tariffs, 30% of the import price, will be applied to
cold-rolled, plate-rolled and coated sheet steel, the "flat products"
that account for the largest share of the domestic steel market. Imports
of bar and tin mill steel also will be subject to 30% levies.</TE>
<TE>   Imported slab, a semi-processed product that is transformed into
finished steel by "re-rollers" concentrated on the West Coast, will be
subject to a tariff-rate quota that would impose a 30% levy only if
annual imports exceed 5.4 million tons. Slab imports totaled 5.7 million
tons last year, suggesting that re-rollers will be largely exempt.</TE>
<TE>   Smaller tariffs of 15% will be imposed on steel tube, bar, rod and
rebar, 13% on fittings and flanges and 8% on stainless steel wire.</TE>
<TE>   The effect of the trade barriers on average steel prices is expected
to be much smaller than the amount of the tariffs. Foreign producers are
likely to absorb a sizable portion of the import levy, and domestic
companies risk losing market share if they try to boost prices
aggressively.</TE>
<TE>   Although estimates vary, studies by industry experts have suggested
that average steel prices are likely to rise no more than 5% or so.</TE>
<TE>   The trade barriers would prevent the loss of about 3,500 steel
industry jobs, the Institute for International Economics study said, but
at a cost to consumers of about $2 billion, or more than $500,000 per job
saved. The beneficial effect could be more than offset by job losses in
downstream manufacturers, whose production tends to decline when prices
rise. Affected industries include cars, trucks, farm equipment,
industrial machinery, home appliances, furniture and fixtures.</TE>
<TE>Gains Could Override Losses in U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The overall effect on the U.S. economy is expected to be relatively
small because losses in one area would largely be offset by gains in
another.</TE>
<TE>   "In relation to the size of the U.S. economy, it's not a huge thing,"
said Ben Goodrich, co-author of the study. "It's not a good idea as
you're trying to emerge from a recession, but it's probably not going to
keep you from emerging."</TE>

<HD>Japan's Houses of Horror</HD>
<DH>Shoddy construction and government policies that discourage resale
saddle many buyers with worthless property.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SANBUCHO, Japan
</DL>
<LD>Homeowner Nagako Itoga lifted up a tatami mat to reveal a corner
beam of her $250,000 house almost completely detached from the
foundation. Then she pointed out the unsound roof supports, tilting
hallways and floorboards so rotten the ground is visible below.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm so angry with this atrocious construction I considered lighting
myself on fire with kerosene in front of the government building," she
said. "But my daughter pointed out that it would be far better to stay
alive and fight those responsible for this mess."</LD>
<LD>   In any country, the family house is the bedrock of emotional and
financial security, but it has turned into an albatross for many here.
It's bad enough that deflation has eaten at land values over the last
decade. Now, many thousands are finding that government policies and
construction industry practices leave their houses worthless in as little
as 15 years.</LD>
<TE>   The wake-up call was the magnitude 7.2 earthquake that slammed into
Kobe in early 1995, killing 6,400 people. As workers cleared the rubble
left by about 440,000 collapsed buildings, it soon became apparent that
many new houses built by name-brand Japanese developers had collapsed
while older houses, including many using foreign construction materials
and methods, stood firm.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, the Japan Consumer Information Center received more than
3,400 housing-quality complaints, a doubling of pre-earthquake levels,
and the phones haven't stopped ringing. Tokyo last April opened a
dedicated housing court where more than 300 cases are pending.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a country where well-made Japanese buildings made by master
craftsmen are still standing 1,300 years later," said Gaku Itoh, director
of Gaku Architectural Institute, a consumer watchdog group. "But
developers are only interested in cutting costs and driving up profit so
quality's gotten worse and worse." And the Construction Ministry, he
added, is in league with the builders.</TE>
<TE>   Regulations and industry practices encourage homeownership, but they
also channel buyers to new homes rather than pre-owned ones. New-house
buyers get mortgage deductions and other tax breaks not available to
second or third owners. Only 11% of home sales in Japan are for pre-owned
houses, compared with 76% in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Once houses start to fall apart, generally within a couple of decades,
they're essentially thrown away. In some cases, the mortgage outlasts the
house. The average life of a Japanese house is 26 years, compared with 44
years in the U.S. And aggressive government-backed lending policies for
new homes--as low as 2.75% for the first 10 years of a 35-year term--make
it easy for buyers to get in over their heads.</TE>
<TE>Feeling Like 'Prisoners With No Escape'</TE>
<TE>   In the U.S., buyers can hand the keys to the bank if the value
plummets. Borrowers in Japan don't have that option; they are personally
liable for the full amount.</TE>
<TE>   Homemaker Yumiko Uchida, 41, living in a defective house in Itoga's
neighborhood near Tokyo's Narita Airport, lays a golf ball on her floor
that quickly picks up speed on the 2.8% slope before slamming into the
opposing wall. Upstairs, a plumb line hanging from the top of the doorway
is two inches askew by the time it reaches the floor.</TE>
<TE>   The Uchidas paid $280,000 for their house in 1992 and owe $146,000 on
the mortgage. "It's now worth maybe $38,000 if anyone would even buy it,"
said the mother of two. The trauma over their failed investment has left
her husband, who commutes four hours a day, physically and mentally weak.
"He spends his weekends in the hospital," she said. "We feel like
prisoners here with no escape."</TE>
<TE>   Often, as houses approach their 20th birthday they're worth less than
zero given the $10,000 cost of breaking down and carting away structures
nobody wants.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a continuous cycle of scrap and build," said Fumio
Shinohara, senior researcher with NLI Research Institute, a think tank.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers who complain about sagging walls and faulty construction
soon hit a wall. Consumer complaints are frequently channeled into an
industry-government committee. The construction industry is a huge
national employer, a major political fund-raiser and often hires
Construction Ministry bureaucrats after retirement. As if that didn't
stack the deck, consumer groups say the industry has traditionally had a
major role in writing the regulations governing its practices.</TE>
<TE>   Once consumers lodge their complaint with the committee, they give up
their right to sue, further undermining their leverage. The Construction
Ministry, meanwhile, doesn't disclose to prospective buyers which
developers are the subjects of frequent buyer complaints on the grounds
that this would undermine the company's privacy rights.</TE>
<TE>   "Individuals may need privacy, but huge companies don't. That's
ridiculous," said Mitsuru Toyoda, owner of a condominium near Yokohama
who is involved in a lawsuit with developer Mitsui Real Estate Co. "It's
like an ant trying to fight against an elephant."</TE>
<TE>   Those such as Toyoda and wife Hitomi who take their grievances to
court find themselves in expensive, time-consuming fights that leave the
burden of proof on the consumer.</TE>
<TE>   Under Japan's civil law, consumers have only five years to sue, even
though structural flaws may not show up for a long time. There's no
discovery process, which allows both sides to gain access to key facts,
leaving consumers to fight against corporations with their armies of
engineers, technical details and expert mumbo jumbo.</TE>
<TE>   Construction Ministry officials and developers concede there are
systemic shortcomings but deny any special relationship with each other.
They point to recent improvements, including a quality assurance law
enacted in 2000 and a new inspection system. There are few penalties on
developers for noncompliance.</TE>
<TE>   "In Japan, not just in the housing industry, there's been a tendency
to support the companies, not the consumers, and to focus on quantity
over quality," said Shin Honto, secretariat head of the Land,
Infrastructure and Transport Ministry's dispute committee.</TE>
<TE>   "There wasn't really any mechanism to hear or reflect consumer voices.
It's not a good system, so we're trying to change it."</TE>
<TE>   Add these factors up, said Keio University professor Haruo Shimada, an
economic advisor to Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, and you have a huge
reason Japanese aren't spending and don't feel confident about their
future.</TE>
<TE>   "People are really scared about being unable to sell their houses," he
said. "They're afraid of losing their entire fortunes. It's a disaster."</TE>
<TE>   Even those with well-built homes face a tough time reselling. Sale
prices aren't public, there's no multiple listing service, no tradition
of independent inspections and no public tax records, making it difficult
to gauge the market.</TE>
<TE>   Although exact comparisons are difficult given the difference in land
prices, Tokyo residents pay more than twice what their Los Angeles
counterparts do for a house that's 25% smaller. The gap for condo
purchases is even greater. The average city dweller has a $760,000
mortgage outstanding on a property worth half that.</TE>
<TE>   Rigid rules lock people in, preventing the growing elderly population,
for instance, from moving into smaller units closer to hospitals and
public transportation.</TE>
<TE>   Those who complain face a tough road. The Toyodas bought their
top-of-the-line condominium from Mitsui for $1 million in 1990. Within
months, the balcony on the unit advertised as a "home for life" started
separating from the exterior wall, the ceiling and windows were leaking,
huge concrete chunks had fallen from the ceiling, and wind was blowing
through the walls.</TE>
<TE>   The Toyodas say Mitsui initially tried to ignore them, then attempted
a cover-up and finally turned their neighbors against them by accusing
them of being "troublemakers" in a nation where group harmony is
paramount. When the problems became too obvious to ignore, Mitsui offered
to have its subsidiary do a quick patch job the Toyodas say was designed
to destroy the evidence.</TE>
<TE>   "They keep changing their story like a chameleon, trying to wear us
down financially and emotionally," said Hitomi Toyoda. "This was supposed
to be our dream house. Instead, it's turned into the biggest mistake of
our lives."</TE>
<TE>   Mitsui officials say they understand the Toyodas' frustration at not
getting much initial response to their complaints. But they maintain that
the separating balcony and other problems aren't structural.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not denying all responsibility," said Jun Kanai, Mitsui's
deputy communication manager. "But this is not the end of the world.
We're working to improve our efficiency."</TE>
<TE>   Itoga, meanwhile, said she realized almost immediately after buying
her house and a second $184,000 building for her home-based business that
there were major problems. Her first clue was when her bank balked at the
loan, forcing her to borrow from relatives. Only later did she realize
the bank had seen the construction documents and run in the opposite
direction.</TE>
<TE>   Within days of her 1995 closing, problems surfaced. It soon became
apparent her two houses along with the Uchidas' and those of most others
in the subdivision were shifting and sagging after being built on a soggy
rice field. Despite claims that the houses used renown cedar from the
Akita region, they'd been slapped together by unskilled laborers using
cheap ply board covered with a plastic veneer.</TE>
<TE>   Septic tanks started tipping over, gas pipes exploded, front doors no
longer opened, and foundations sank. Resident Minoru Isaka, a retiree,
uses a window-washer's belt to go out on his shifting balcony. An expert
hired to inspect houses in the complex determined that 40% were
dangerous, 30% seriously defective and 20% had significant problems. Just
as the residents in 1997 started realizing how bad things were, the
quasi-government Akita-based developer declared bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>Most People Prefer to Suffer in Silence</TE>
<TE>   But most people are afraid to speak out in a nation where people are
taught to endure and avoid confrontation. Only 17 of the 256 homeowners
in the subdivision have joined the Itoga-initiated lawsuit against the
Akita government, the project auditors, and its bankers and individual
executives. The rest prefer to suffer in silence, viewing their more
defiant neighbors as troublemakers.</TE>
<TE>   After she filed the suit, Itoga's children were bullied in school.</TE>
<TE>   "They taunt them about the defective house, as though it were
something about their own character," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The struggle for justice has become an obsession for Itoga. Her house
is a museum of defects replete with ripped-out flooring and ceilings cut
open to reveal twisted or missing beams. Many of her walls are painted
with arrows to highlight adjoining defects. Her back hurts from walking
on the sloped floors, and she complains of the oily smell emanating from
the earth below.</TE>
<TE>   Itoga's second building was supposed to spur the efficiency of her
home-grown plastic parts business, but it's had the opposite effect.
Business is down because she's stressed and more clients are rejecting
orders contaminated by dust falling from the ceiling. She advises her
four employees to get out at the first hint of an earthquake. "Even a
thunderstorm or a passing car makes it shake," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I've lost 38 pounds from all the anxiety, and I've thrown up blood,"
she said, tears streaming down her face. "I feel betrayed. There are no
words to describe such frustration and pain."</TE>

<HD>Simon Trounces Riordan, Storms to GOP Nomination</HD>
<DH>Primary: The political newcomer badly trailed former L.A. mayor
until recently. He'll take on Gov. Davis in November.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK Z. BARABAK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Businessman Bill Simon Jr., making his first try for public office,
capped a meteoric rise to political power by toppling Richard Riordan on
Tuesday in the GOP primary for governor.</LD>
<LD>   The emphatic victory--which seemed improbable as recently as 10 days
ago--will pit Simon against Democratic incumbent Gray Davis in November's
general election. Simon went after the governor immediately, blaming
Davis in his acceptance speech for botched state policies on energy, the
budget, education and water.</LD>
<LD>   "So many of these crises could have been avoided," Simon said, "if we
had leaders with ideas and principles. I don't believe that Gray Davis
planned to fail; I just think he failed to plan."</LD>
<TE>   He also exulted over his double-digit win and suggested the
conservative ideas that powered him past Riordan would fuel a similar
upset over Davis in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   "We know that our ideas can move mountains," Simon told a cheering
crowd at the state GOP's headquarters hotel near Los Angeles
International Airport. "That's why we're here tonight and that's why
we're going to win in November."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan called Simon to concede less than three hours after the polls
closed. Smiling gamely as he addressed supporters late Tuesday night,
Riordan pledged to "join eagerly in our crusade to get rid of Gray
Davis."</TE>
<TE>   "We must back Bill Simon," Riordan said, abandoning the animus that
marked the closing days of his campaign. "Bill Simon is the hope to bring
back glory to the Golden State."</TE>
<TE>   But Riordan also renewed his assertion that the California GOP needs
to reach out to disaffected voters to win statewide elections--despite
the problems that message caused his own campaign. The former Los Angeles
mayor trailed Simon across the state, even running weaker than expected
on his Southern California home turf.</TE>
<TE>   "We must expand the vision of our party," he declared. "My campaign
carried a message worth fighting for: the Republican Party will become
more powerful by becoming inclusive."</TE>
<TE>Davis Had Big Impact on GOP Race</TE>
<TE>   Davis ran largely unopposed in the Democratic primary, but played a
significant role in swaying the Republican race. The $10 million he spent
on advertising in the primary--the bulk of it savaging Riordan--was about
as much as the Riordan and Simon television budgets combined.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking to a ballroom full of chanting supporters in downtown Los
Angeles, a gleeful Davis joined the crowd in shouts of "four more
years!"--at one point offering a smiling Spanish translation.</TE>
<TE>   After congratulating Simon, the governor promised "a spirited and
hard-fought campaign" over the next eight months and previewed some of
his lines of attack.</TE>
<TE>   "Bill Simon is a true-blue think-tank conservative. I am a practical
problem-solver," Davis said. "I believe many of his ideas are out of step
and out of touch with most Californians. We need to keep moving
California forward. Not backward--and certainly not to the right."</TE>
<TE>   The third major GOP hopeful, Secretary of State Bill Jones, could
afford only a modest ad campaign and was running third.</TE>
<TE>   About 45 minutes after the polls closed, Jones spoke to roughly 100
supporters at the Lime Lite Restaurant in his hometown of Fresno. The
mood was somber, but Jones--surrounded by his wife, Maurine, and his two
grown daughters and son-in-law--made no concession. He later telephoned
Simon to privately offer his congratulations and concede the contest.</TE>
<TE>   The governor's race topped an election day menu of eight statewide
races, along with ballot measures involving term limits, environmental
protection and the state's gasoline tax.</TE>
<TE>   In another anticipated race, scandal-plagued U.S. Rep Gary Condit was
ousted by his former protege, Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza of Merced, in
their battle for the Democratic nomination in the 18th Congressional
District.</TE>
<TE>   Among the ballot measures, Proposition 42, which would permanently
dedicate state gasoline tax money for transportation projects, appeared
headed for passage. Proposition 45, a measure to amend the state's
legislative term limits, was losing by a considerable margin. Proposition
40, a $2.6-billion bond measure to improve the environment and protect
open space, was leading by a narrower, but consistent margin.</TE>
<TE>   The turnout for Tuesday's unusually early primary was low--perhaps
even lower than the 36% that was forecast.</TE>
<TE>   The Republican primary vote was strongly conservative, which seemed to
benefit Simon, who aimed his appeal at the party's most ideological
voters. Roughly six in 10 GOP voters described themselves as conservative
in a Los Angeles Times exit poll.</TE>
<TE>   Moments after the polls closed, state Democratic Party Chairman Art
Torres hinted at the rough going the 50-year-old Simon will face.</TE>
<TE>   "The Republican Party has nominated for governor--to use Dick
Riordan's own words about Bill Simon--an unelectable extremist and
sanctimonious hypocrite," Torres said.</TE>
<TE>   The gubernatorial race was hardly a record-setter in terms of money
spent. That distinction goes to the $63-million Democratic primary four
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   That said, the GOP contest was remarkable for its volatility, for
Davis' brazen intervention and for the souffle-like collapse of Riordan's
candidacy in, literally, a matter of days.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan, 71, had reason for confidence, at least starting out. He
entered the race as a commanding favorite--in early surveys leading by as
much as 40 points.</TE>
<TE>   He enjoyed the backing of President Bush--who helped persuade him to
run--along with others in the Republican Party establishment. To them,
Riordan's moderate stance on social issues and his appeal to women and
minority voters in Los Angeles suggested a different brand of
Republicanism that could overcome the state party's hard-edged image.</TE>
<TE>   Encouraged by those blandishments, Riordan ran against Davis from the
start, treating the GOP primary as a technicality. He never used the word
"Republican" during his announcement tour--until a questioner brought it
up the second day--and he even included former President Clinton in one
of his TV ads.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan ignored the jabs of his opponents and, worse, from the
perspective of GOP activists, seemed to almost go out of his way to
antagonize the party faithful. Riordan not only touted his support for
legal abortion, but lectured Republicans on the need to adopt his view or
face extinction as a party.</TE>
<TE>   He showed up at events featuring gay rights activists and honoring
Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Oakland), who cast the lone vote in Congress against
the use of force after last year's terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   He also was emphatic in refusing to spend any of his own personal
fortune on the race, mitigating one of the attractions of his candidacy
for Bush and others who urged him to run.</TE>
<TE>   But the key tactical blunder may have come at the end of January, when
Davis launched his first attack spot, a 30-second television ad that
criticized Riordan for his past support of antiabortion candidates and
organi The Riordan camp responded that same night with a generic
spot--filmed weeks earlier--that expressed his disappointment at Davis'
tone but did not dispute the facts.</TE>
<TE>   Strategists for Riordan wagered that in a post-Sept. 11 environment,
voters would have little patience for the sharp-elbowed tactics of the
past.</TE>
<TE>   But Davis persisted. He pounded Riordan as a flip-flopper on abortion
as well as the death penalty and assailed his record as mayor. The GOP
front-runner's lead began steadily eroding.</TE>
<TE>   That convinced Simon, who had husbanded his own fortune, to foot the
kind of multimillion-dollar advertising campaign that is needed to get
voters' attention in the vast and diverse state.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Simon was the first candidate to announce his intentions to
run for governor, forming an exploratory committee in February. He
entered the contest with the encouragement of Riordan--a friend and
fellow parishioner at St. Monica's Catholic Church in Santa Monica, whose
own candidacy was still months from conception.</TE>
<TE>   For well over a year, Simon traveled the state in obscurity, speaking
to one small conservative klatch after another. He outlined plans to
address the state's energy problems, water and transportation, called for
tax cuts and touted himself as "the candidate of ideas."</TE>
<TE>   Simon finally took to the television airwaves in late January with a
spot featuring former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. Simon had
served as an assistant U.S. attorney for a few years under Giuliani.
Seeing one of the heroes of Sept. 11 on their TV screen was enough to
make voters start paying more attention to Simon.</TE>
<TE>   He triumphed at last month's straw poll at the state GOP
convention--after Riordan boycotted the popularity contest--and built on
his momentum by expanding his meager TV advertising campaign.</TE>
<TE>   A tongue-tied, fumbling performer at first, Simon turned in a credible
performance in the final two of three gubernatorial debates. More
important, he consolidated the conservative GOP base and established
himself over Jones as the alternative candidate to the more centrist
Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, meantime, continued to pillory Riordan in his
advertising--including one audacious ad that featured the words of former
Republican Gov. George Deukmejian, who actually was stumping for Jones.</TE>
<TE>Jones Had Experience but Little Money</TE>
<TE>   The secretary of state, who got into the race last spring, had the
most political experience of any of the major Republican candidates. But
he spent his eight years in statewide office promoting largely
nonpartisan issues, such as voter participation, and did not lay much
groundwork for a gubernatorial run. Indeed, he was badly hurt by a
decision in 2000 to withdraw his earlier endorsement and switch to
Arizona Sen. John McCain over then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush in the GOP
presidential primary.</TE>
<TE>   That dried up Republican cash and left Jones running a hand-to-mouth
effort that never seriously threatened Riordan or Simon.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, with Davis shaping the dynamic, a Los Angeles Times poll a
week ago showed the two rivals running neck and neck; that pierced
Riordan's aura of inevitability and caused the White House and its allies
to start reaching out to Simon.</TE>
<TE>   After months of staying above the tussle, the beleaguered Riordan
began attacking Simon. He suggested their friendship was over and
launched an attack spot questioning Simon's party loyalty.</TE>
<TE>   Simon responded in kind, citing Riordan's generous campaign
contributions to Democrats over the years and his past praise for former
President Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, without the money to seriously compete on television, faded
into irrelevancy. Despite last-minute revelations that Simon failed to
register as a Republican during his years in New York and contributed,
through a business partnership, to liberal San Francisco Mayor Willie
Brown, his momentum appeared too strong for Riordan to overcome.</TE>

<HD>Cut-Rate Welfare Jobs in Bush Plan</HD>
<DH>Policy: Administration says the minimum wage law would not apply.
Proposal is assailed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN PETERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration is moving to allow states to place welfare
recipients in jobs that pay less than the minimum wage--a reversal of
federal policy that is sparking ire among public employee unions and
advocates for the poor.</LD>
<LD>   The White House idea is that such cut-rate jobs could provide work
experience for many thousands of welfare recipients who have not moved
into the labor force. Such work could take the form of community service,
including tasks like cleaning up at parks and helping out in offices.</LD>
<LD>   The Bush administration has concluded that this "supervised work
experience" does not amount to a real-world job and should not be
governed by the Fair Labor Standards Act, which sets the national minimum
wage at $5.15 an hour, officials said this week. Some states, including
California, have higher minimums.</LD>
<TE>   "It's intended to give them some work experience and give them an
understanding of work," said Andrew Bush, a welfare official in the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services. "That is not something that
should be subject to minimum wage laws."</TE>
<TE>   The proposal is part of the administration's push to impose much
stricter work rules on welfare recipients, as Congress reexamines the
sweeping welfare overhaul of 1996. The law expires later this year, and
political leaders are starting to debate how to change it, with initial
disputes emerging on the work rules that states would be required to
follow.</TE>
<TE>   "You need to have a program that's very well-focused, and you need to
have your clients very focused--and that focus needs to be on
employment," said Bush, who heads the Office of Family Assistance.</TE>
<TE>   The welfare rolls, which peaked at 5 million families in 1994, have
dropped by more than 50%.</TE>
<TE>   Today, 1 in 3 welfare recipients holds a job. The Bush administration
wants to increase that figure significantly, to 7 in 10. But welfare
recipients who seek to enter the work force face a weaker economy than in
the booming mid- and late-1990s. In addition, many of the most readily
employable welfare recipients found jobs during those robust years, in
many cases leaving behind those with fewer job skills.</TE>
<TE>   One way states could achieve the big gains sought by the White House
would be to expand community service jobs for welfare recipients,
creating opportunities for some of the hardest to place.</TE>
<TE>   "What you're really trying to do is inculcate regular work habits and
expectations," said Jason Turner, who formerly ran New York City's job
program for welfare recipients.</TE>
<TE>   Government has been in the business of creating jobs for many years,
notably in efforts to help unemployed victims of the Great Depression in
the 1930s. But the federal strategy of designing work experience in
return for welfare checks is more recent, gaining attention in the 1990s
when political leaders agreed to make the goal of work the centerpiece of
welfare.</TE>
<TE>   While the Bush administration would leave states various options to
meeting its work requirements, it is placing a new emphasis on
government-designed work experience.</TE>
<TE>   But whether such jobs should pay less than minimum wage, as the Bush
administration would allow, is stirring a debate over fair treatment of
society's least able workers. Already, the White House proposal is
starting a backlash among those who claim that sub-minimum-wage welfare
jobs inevitably displace real jobs held by low-income workers. More
broadly, critics argue, sub-minimum-wage jobs threaten to pull down wage
levels and working conditions for other workers who toil at the bottom
rungs of the wage ladder.</TE>
<TE>   "Our view is that if someone is doing work, and they're a worker, they
ought to be treated like any other worker," said Nanine Meiklejohn, a
lobbyist for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal
Employees in Washington. She added that placing welfare recipients in
jobs "shouldn't be used as an excuse to pay people sub-minimum wages."</TE>
<TE>   "We will certainly fight it," she said of the Bush administration
plan.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration would require that most welfare recipients
work for at least 24 hours a week. It also would tighten the definition
of allowable work for those hours. For example, welfare recipients would
no longer be able to count time spent in vocational education and job
searches as substitutes for the 24-hour work requirement.</TE>
<TE>   Given the tougher hurdles, some experts say states that spend less
money for their welfare programs could face significant new pressures to
create jobs for welfare recipients, particularly if the economy remains
weak.</TE>
<TE>   "Many states will have to consider creating or expanding [community
service programs] to meet the new requirements," said Sheri Steisel,
director of human services policy at the National Conference of State
Legislatures.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, scattered programs, including those in Wisconsin and New
York City, emerged to provide public work activities for welfare
recipients. In 1997 and again in 1999, the Clinton administration made
clear that most such jobs--frequently referred to as "workfare"--were
generally covered by federal laws on the minimum wage. Under the Clinton
policy, which remains in effect, a person's welfare and food stamp
benefits could be counted as the compensation. The Bush administration
plans to use welfare reform legislation as the way to enact its minimum
wage provision.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Benjamin L. Cardin (D-Md.), who has introduced a major Democratic
proposal on welfare reform, questioned in an interview whether the White
House emphasis on publicly created work experience would ultimately
benefit those who do it. As for sub-minimum wages, he said: "It's just
not right. It's not fair to people involved that they should not have
these protections."</TE>
<TE>   California and other states are only just learning details of the Bush
welfare plan, and few were prepared to give substantive reaction Tuesday.
But Andrew Roth, a spokesman for the California Department of Social
Services, said the state "would pay at least the prevailing minimum wage"
of $6.75 an hour for such work.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, relatively few states have established large public work
programs for their welfare recipients, in part because the private
economy generated so many jobs during the 1990s. Also, less-affluent
states that tend to spend less on welfare programs would face difficulty
in setting up large-scale work programs if they are required to pay
minimum wages, some pointed out.</TE>
<TE>   Community service jobs would be just one way that states could satisfy
the stiffer work requirements proposed by the Bush administration.
Private-sector jobs, publicly subsidized jobs and on-the-job training
could meet the standards. According to one administration document, the
minimum-wage provision applies to "supervised work experience" and
"supervised community service."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, administration officials maintain that there are
many ways a welfare recipient can enter the work force, with traditional
private-sector jobs remaining a real possibility even in a weaker
economy.</TE>
<TE>   In a recent meeting with reporters, HHS Secretary Tommy G. Thompson
maintained that the economy continues to generate many low-wage
opportunities for welfare recipients, such as in health care. "I think
there's plenty of opportunities like that in every state in America."</TE>

<DL>GARDEZ, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>As U.S. aircraft pressed a bombing campaign against several hundred
Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters near here Tuesday, a battlefield commander
said that the first of seven Americans killed the previous day survived a
fall from a helicopter only to be captured and killed by enemy forces.</LD>
<LD>   The incident was captured on streaming video transmitted from a
surveillance aircraft. At a remote site, Maj. Gen. Frank L. Hagenbeck
watched helplessly.</LD>
<LD>   The Chinook helicopter had just touched down. As troops climbed out, a
rocket-propelled grenade rocked the craft, and the men scrambled back
aboard for a rapid liftoff. In the confusion, apparently no one noticed
that the attack had sent Navy SEAL Neil C. Roberts of Woodland, Calif.,
tumbling to the ground.</LD>
<TE>   "We saw him . . . being dragged off by three Al Qaeda men," Hagenbeck
said.</TE>
<TE>   By the time rescuers reached Petty Officer 1st Class Roberts, he had
been fatally shot.</TE>
<TE>   The firefights intensified Tuesday, with U.S. forces targeting groups
as small as three and others larger than 100 in a broad, mountainous
region. As additional Afghan and U.S. troops were moved into position to
strengthen the offensive, Afghan commanders allied with the U.S.
predicted that it was just a matter of time before all resistance to
Afghanistan's new interim government was crushed.</TE>
<TE>   "Where can they escape?" asked Taj Mohamad Wardak, governor of Paktia
province, where the fighting is taking place. He was referring to the Al
Qaeda and Taliban holdouts who have gathered in the mountains. "They are
surrounded."</TE>
<TE>   Still, no one knows how long it will take. The offensive has become
the largest of the Afghan war and the bloodiest for U.S. troops. On
Tuesday, troops involved in the fight and local Afghans described the
ongoing battle as extremely intense. Despite initial setbacks that seem
to have prompted a more cautious approach, U.S. troops and local Afghans
reported that they have killed many more suspected Al Qaeda holdouts in
the snow-capped mountains of southeastern Afghanistan than the Pentagon
had previously disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   "On Tuesday we caught several hundred of them with [rocket-propelled
grenades] and mortars heading toward the fight. We body-slammed them . .
. and killed hundreds of those guys," Hagenbeck said.</TE>
<TE>   But U.S. strategists believe that hundreds of Al Qaeda fighters
remain, Air Force Brig. Gen. John W. Rosa Jr., deputy director of
operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at a Pentagon briefing.</TE>
<TE>   About 1,000 U.S. troops have been engaged in the fight against the
well-entrenched Taliban and Al Qaeda forces, whose numbers are unclear.</TE>
<TE>   As the assault in the Shahi Kot area began Saturday, the infiltrating
troops met more force than expected, compelling a 450-man Afghan unit led
by a local commander, Gen. Zia Lodin, to abort its advance toward a key
town south of Gardez.</TE>
<TE>   Mortar fire killed two of his men and injured 24, prompting the
general to retreat and call for continued air power.</TE>
<TE>   The same day, elements of the 10th Mountain Division were pinned down
after taking fire from the town of Marzak. Lt. Col. Frank LaCamera and a
force of about 40 troops were caught in a 12-hour battle. Mortar rounds
and rocket-propelled grenades landed as close as 15 yards to their
position, and 13 U.S. soldiers were wounded.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we knew what we were getting into this time, but I
think we're beginning to adjust," said Sgt. Maj. Mark Nielsen, 48, of
Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Fazlullah, governor of neighboring Lowgar province, said Tuesday that
the initial assault may have failed because the Americans had not chosen
the most experienced local fighters for the campaign. "Those that they
got were fighters for rent, not the pros," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But the recruitment may have been difficult, he said, because in the
areas surrounding Shahi Kot, Al Qaeda has proclaimed that anyone
supporting foreign forces or the interim Afghanistan government "will be
seriously punished."</TE>
<TE>   Fazlullah said he had no doubt of the final outcome. "The Al Qaeda
people will fail, because they have no logistical supplies and no way to
get more. They will be finished in one week, or at the most, two." But he
said he could not rule out that undiscovered enclaves of resistance
remain.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, residents of Gardez, a rugged city nestled between majestic
mountains, stood on their rooftops in their tunics and turbans to watch
the air show.</TE>
<TE>   Evidence of Al Qaeda is easy to find in the area. Upon entering one
compound, troops found recoilless rifles, mortar equipment, a state
identification card from Saudi Arabia, a Koran and receipts from
businesses, including one from a hotel in Mashhad, Iran, near the Afghan
border.</TE>
<TE>   "It was unbelievable; in the mud hut where these guys slept, the beds
were still warm and tea was still brewing," one U.S. serviceman said. "We
also found lots of AK-47 ammunition and medicine along with night vision
devices and radios."</TE>
<TE>   At the Pentagon on Tuesday, Rosa tried to clear up
sometimes-contradictory reports in the aftermath of two fatal helicopter
incidents. According to his account:</TE>
<TE>   About 3 a.m. local time Monday, Roberts' MH-47 Chinook helicopter was
hit. It managed to lift off and set down half a mile away after
mechanical problems made it difficult to keep flying. It remains unclear
whether those on board saw Roberts being dragged away, as Hagenbeck did
via remote video.</TE>
<TE>   A second Chinook that had been accompanying the first rescued the crew
and passengers from that spot, without dropping off its own crew. It
later returned to recover Roberts' body and deliver Rangers to the battle
area.</TE>
<TE>   Three and a half hours later, at 6:30 a.m., two more Chinooks were
descending to drop off another group of troops a few miles from the first
drop-off point when one was struck by machine gun fire and a
rocket-propelled grenade, sending it into either a crash landing or a
"hard landing," Rosa said.</TE>
<TE>   The second helicopter dropped its men, leaving the damaged Chinook on
the ground. There, six American special operations troops were killed and
11 were injured while exchanging fire with suspected Al Qaeda fighters.
The dead and wounded were on the ground as long as 12 hours before help
arrived.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're going to go do a rescue operation, things have to be just
right. You have to be very careful, because [otherwise] you have another
one or two helicopters down," Rosa said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Roberts, the Pentagon identified the slain servicemen
as Army Sgt. Bradley S. Crose, 27, of Orange Park, Fla.; Army Sgt. Philip
J. Svitak, 31, of Joplin, Mo.; Army Spc. Marc A. Anderson, 30, of
Brandon, Fla.; Army Pfc. Matthew A. Commons, 21, of Boulder City, Nev.;
Air Force Tech. Sgt. John A. Chapman, 36, of Waco, Texas; and Air Force
Senior Airman Jason D. Cunningham, 26, of Camarillo.</TE>
<TE>   A C-17 transport jet brought the remains of the seven men, plus an
eighth killed over the weekend, to Ramstein Air Base in Germany. The
caskets will be flown to the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Hendren reported from Washington and Daniszewski from Gardez.</TE>

<HD>Simon's Conservative Image Could Play Into Davis' Hands</HD>
<DH>Race: Voters' perceptions will turn on how the rivals take
advantage of each other's vision.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The struggle to define Bill Simon Jr. started just hours after the
polls closed Tuesday night. Is he a former prosecutor and successful
businessman who can pull the state from its fiscal morass and fix its
broken school system? Or a rich, right-wing extremist who opposes
abortion rights and gun control?</LD>
<LD>   The battle over which portrait of Simon voters embrace will be crucial
in determining whether Democrat Gray Davis becomes the first California
governor since 1966 to lose a bid for reelection.</LD>
<LD>   If Davis persuades swing voters that Simon is an extreme conservative,
the governor stands a better chance of overcoming his own anemic poll
ratings. In his victory speech Tuesday, Davis began that effort. He
called Simon "out of touch" and cited their views on abortion as a key
difference between them.</LD>
<TE>   If Simon convinces voters that he's a capable, mainstream fiscal
manager with a soft spot for education, he may be able to take votes away
from Davis, who faces a $17-billion budget shortfall and a skeptical
public.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's main task is to stop Davis from focusing the race on
hot-button social issues, where Davis' views are more in line with those
of the state electorate.</TE>
<TE>   "If they can pull that off--and it's easier said than done--maybe they
can make it competitive," Democratic strategist Bill Carrick said. "If
they don't, they're going down. Big time."</TE>
<TE>   To many voters, Simon, a first-time candidate for public office, is
largely a blank slate. That could help the chipper Pacific Palisades
businessman appeal to voters dissatisfied with Davis' record on
education, energy and the economy.</TE>
<TE>   But Davis, a tenacious veteran of statewide campaigns, has already
displayed his willingness to define a rival candidate on his own terms.
The governor's $10-million television ad campaign against GOP primary
hopeful Richard Riordan effectively ruined the former Los Angeles mayor's
image, especially among Northern Californians, before Riordan was able to
define himself.</TE>
<TE>   Davis is open about his plan to wage an aggressive, perhaps brutal
campaign. Last month, he warned potential GOP challengers: "You're in for
the fight of your life."</TE>
<TE>   Even before the polls closed Tuesday night, Garry South, the chief
architect of Davis' reelection campaign, was dismissing Simon as "a
garden-variety right-winger."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Davis' investment in the Republican primary was made precisely
because the governor and his strategists believed they would fare better
against Simon than against Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   "By appealing in the primary to the most conservative Republican
voters, [Simon] has painted himself into a very tiny and ultimately
untenable corner," South said. "From all appearances, it looks more like
Bill Simon is running for governor of Utah or Kansas than California."</TE>
<TE>   Simon described himself as "a conservative Republican" during the
primary race. He touted his "A" rating by the National Rifle Assn. and
his endorsement by Gun Owners of California.</TE>
<TE>   He also promoted his endorsement by the California Pro-Life Council, a
group that seeks to outlaw abortion. On Simon's Web site, Pro-Life
Council leader Brian Johnston says the GOP candidate "wants the
government out of the abortion industry."</TE>
<TE>   In short, Simon faces a classic problem of a candidate in a hotly
contested Republican primary: He appealed to the party's conservative
base to get the nomination, but faces a more moderate electorate in
November.</TE>
<TE>   On abortion, for example, two out of three Simon voters in the GOP
primary want to outlaw the procedure, according to a Times survey of
voters leaving the polls Tuesday. But among all California voters, only
one in three want to ban abortion.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's advisors acknowledge he must adapt to the broader electorate,
but say there's precedent for such a move. They point to the 1966
governor's race. Democratic incumbent Edmund G. "Pat" Brown interceded in
the Republican primary to help a staunch conservative, Ronald Reagan,
beat moderate GOP rival George Christopher. But in November, Reagan still
tossed Brown out of office.</TE>
<TE>   "You can change the names, and you can write the story already," Simon
consultant Sal Russo said.</TE>
<TE>   Reagan, though, was far better known in California than Simon is.
Reagan also faced a vastly different political climate, including campus
riots and social upheaval that improved prospects for a conservative
candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats point to more recent history to make the opposite point. In
New Jersey, conservative Bret Schundler defeated moderate Bob Franks in
the GOP gubernatorial primary last year, but was beaten by Democrat James
E. McGreevey in the fall. McGreevey used Schundler's opposition to
abortion rights and gun control, along with his support of school
vouchers, to undermine him, particularly with women and independent
voters.</TE>
<TE>   "Once you tie those three issues together for people, it defines the
candidate as out of touch with mainstream values," said McGreevey
pollster Joel Benenson.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Davis used the same tactic against then-Atty. Gen. Dan
Lungren, a conservative Republican.</TE>
<TE>   Lungren overwhelmingly lost to Davis in the general election that year
after a race in which Davis highlighted his rival's views on abortion,
tobacco, the environment and guns.</TE>
<TE>   To offset the Davis attacks on social issues, Simon will take full
advantage of a key supporter, Rudolph W. Giuliani.</TE>
<TE>   The former New York City mayor--Simon's boss when Giuliani was the
Manhattan U.S. attorney in the 1980s--has appeared regularly with Simon
during the primary campaign. As a moderate Republican who supports
abortion rights and gun control, Giuliani, some consultants think, could
blunt Davis' attacks by vouching for Simon on those issues.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, Rudy Giuliani is Babe Ruth, John Wayne and the Beatles
rolled into one," said GOP consultant Ken Khachigian. "If Rudy Giuliani
gives you the official Good Conduct pass for the campaign, that's hard to
combat."</TE>
<TE>   Giuliani will be in California this week and might campaign with Simon
on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Simon plans--to the extent possible--to avoid talking about
abortion and guns. Instead, he will try to keep the campaign focused on
issues such as his proposed tax cuts and education. Schools are a key
issue for women and other swing voters; Simon's first campaign stop this
morning is at a Los Angeles school.</TE>
<TE>   "He's made it very clear he's not running for governor to talk about
social issues," said Rob Stutzman, a state Republican Party spokesman.
"You'll see he'll consistently talk about the issues that he wants to
talk about."</TE>
<TE>   For Davis, one big problem ahead is the state's projected $17-billion
budget shortfall. He faces the painful choice of raising taxes--he has
pledged only that he will not "advocate" a tax hike--or cutting popular
programs.</TE>
<TE>   "There is not one program he can cut that won't hurt someone who has
supported him--or an industry that supported him," said political
scientist Sherry Bebitch-Jeffe of USC.</TE>
<TE>   In the Times Poll last month, Davis' job approval rating was 47% among
registered voters. For an incumbent seeking reelection, strategists
consider anything under 50% to be within a danger zone.</TE>
<TE>   Simon plans to focus relentlessly on Davis' "failed leadership." And
on the stump, the novice Republican candidate has already displayed a
knack for the same kind of strict self-discipline that has become a
hallmark of Davis' campaign style. "If there's anything you should have
learned about Bill Simon in this campaign, it's that he is consistent,"
Russo said. "What he says in one place, he says in another, and what he
says one day, he'll say another day."</TE>

<HD>Davis' Brash Tactician Grabs National Notice</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN FIELDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Garry South leans back in his oversized leather desk chair, one
lanky arm folded behind his head, his lips curling in satisfaction.</LD>
<LD>   Each day brings him more claps on the shoulder, handshakes and
breathless testaments to his brilliance as California's political chess
master of the moment.</LD>
<LD>   For the last three months, he has set the terms of the Republican
primary for governor, even though his candidate, Democratic Gov. Gray
Davis, isn't even in it.</LD>
<TE>   They have all played his game.</TE>
<TE>   South's bold decision to have Davis spend $10 million targeting
Richard Riordan refocused the primary on issues like abortion, guns and
conservative credentials. Experts said the campaign was particularly
effective because it goaded Riordan--South's longtime nemesis--into
repeatedly stressing his pro-choice views while trying to attract
conservative Republican votes.</TE>
<TE>   South even outmaneuvered the White House, which had encouraged Riordan
to run, forcing the administration into a last-minute scramble to court
businessman Bill Simon Jr., who cemented a solid victory over Riordan on
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a hall-of-fame move," UC Berkeley political scientist Bruce
Cain said about South's strategy. "Prior to 1998, even, [South] was
barely a blip on the radar screen. It has really been a meteoric rise."</TE>
<TE>   In less than 10 years, South has rocketed from obscurity to stardom
among the elite of political strategists in California and, thus, in the
nation.</TE>
<TE>   He's a man who revels in the limelight. About the most fun he's had
lately, South confesses, was paying a surprise visit to an event for
Riordan at the former mayor's downtown Los Angeles restaurant, the
Original Pantry. With South, 50, holding court out front, Riordan, 71,
was forced to slip in through the back door.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't eat the food," South said before sauntering away, alluding to
the eatery's one-time shutdown for health-code violations.</TE>
<TE>   But the same South who relished the confrontation spends his spare
time designing liturgical vestments. His latest work, an altar frontal
made from gold velvet, with gold and red brocade, gold crosses and
chalices, should be ready in time for Easter.</TE>
<TE>Shoot-From-the Hip Alter Ego to Davis</TE>
<TE>   Nothing, however, matches his passion for politics.</TE>
<TE>   "I've often asked myself, 'Could I run a shoe store? Could I manage a
Dairy Queen?' " South said. "I never found anything as interesting to me
as politics. I never found anything I was as good at as politics."</TE>
<TE>   With his ruddy, barroom brawler's face and pale surgeon's hands, South
serves as the ultra-deliberate Davis' shoot-from-the-lip alter ego and
trusted confidant.</TE>
<TE>   Davis hired South to oversee his 1994 campaign for lieutenant governor
and kept him on to be the architect of his 1998 run for governor.</TE>
<TE>   Their relationship had an unusual candor from the start. South was not
intimidated by Davis, known for being temperamental and demanding in
private. Even now, South speaks to the governor in the same utterly
certain voice he uses with everyone, his questions never seeming to end
in question marks.</TE>
<TE>   "Garry is very honest and direct with Gray," said Bill Carrick, a
political consultant who observed them while helping the Davis campaign
stage mock debates in 1998. "He'll say, 'That's totally wrong.' "</TE>
<TE>   The relationship deepened during the arduous '98 gubernatorial
campaign, in which Davis at one point trailed not only Republican Dan
Lungren, but also two Democrats, millionaire newcomer Al Checchi and Rep.
Jane Harman.</TE>
<TE>   South stuck by Davis through waves of staff defections and managed to
shore up the candidate's fragile backing from unions and financiers. The
long hours and skipped meals eventually put South in the hospital with
bleeding ulcers.</TE>
<TE>   "There's something in the relationship that I don't understand, but
Garry is loyal to Gray Davis in a way few people are," said Phil
Trounstine, Davis' former communications director who is now a
consultant. "It's almost like brothers."</TE>
<TE>   After Davis won the 1998 race, South says he was asked to serve as the
administration's chief of staff. Instead, he opted to remain outside
government, able to sling the sort of political invective that would
compromise a state official's dignity.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure the governor has rolled his eyes plenty when he's picked up
the paper, but Garry can say things the governor can't," Davis spokesman
Steve Maviglio said. "He's got to be out there stirring the soup."</TE>
<TE>   South's tie to Davis helped him land a lucrative--he won't say exactly
how lucrative--consulting gig with public relations giant
Burston-Marstellar from mid-1999 to mid-2001. He says he could have made
more money if he had agreed to lobby for individual clients rather than
providing the firm with more general advice on California issues.</TE>
<TE>   "I've done well, but I could've cleaned up," he said. "I could have
retired."</TE>
<TE>   For a serious power player, he lives pretty modestly, driving a small
white Honda ("my wife gets the Mercedes"), long legs wedged beneath the
steering wheel, holding it steady with his knees as he gesticulates with
his hands. His '70s-era helmet of hair, gently feathered on the sides
with an asymmetrical centerish part, seems deliberately unfashionable.</TE>
<TE>   As Davis' full-time reelection campaign manager, South says he splits
his time three ways, between "candidate control, message control and
damage control."</TE>
<TE>   He rarely travels with Davis and--despite encouraging the governor's
relentless fund-raising--seldom goes to fund-raisers.</TE>
<TE>   "The wealthier people are, the more prone they are to tell you
everything you're doing wrong in the campaign," he said.</TE>
<TE>   His typical day features a conference call with Davis and his brain
trust that starts at 8:30 a.m. and can run for more than two hours, then
rounds of calls to the media and opinion-makers.</TE>
<TE>   He rarely stops talking.</TE>
<TE>   Blunt, often profane and effortlessly quotable, South has a special
talent for driving his opponents crazy. He provokes and distracts them
until their agendas give way to his, said Dave Puglia, political director
for Dan Lungren's 1998 gubernatorial run.</TE>
<TE>   South sometimes compares his strategic process to police profiling. He
does his homework, keeping a storage unit full of files on every
conceivable subject, from his high school papers to his research on
political opponents.</TE>
<TE>   But he also stalks his adversaries, shadowing them from event to event
to observe mannerisms and body language. In the 1998 campaign, he
followed Checchi, reading in the jut of his jaw that he could not
withstand being goaded.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Checchi blew up in a televised debate, blaming South for
forcing him to go negative with his advertising. "I got under the skin of
the 113th richest man in America," South said with relish.</TE>
<TE>A Man Who Revels in Bare-Knuckles Politics</TE>
<TE>   Though adversaries and allies alike call South a pro whose tactics
fall within the modern norm, South himself makes no secret of enjoying
the bare-knuckle quality of political races. Not for nothing, "The
Guinness Book of Poisonous Quotes" sits on his office bookshelf.</TE>
<TE>   He seldom regrets even his most insult-laden attacks on opponents:</TE>
<TE>   Calling Controller Kathleen Connell "a viper" and "one of the most
vile people I've ever known in politics," for example. Or responding to
Arnold Schwarzenegger's public ruminations on a gubernatorial run by
spreading copies of a magazine article accusing Schwarzenegger of groping
women, with a note suggesting that his piggish behavior might be
explained by pig valves falsely rumored to be implanted in his heart.</TE>
<TE>   Though South maintains that Schwarzenegger had it coming for
criticizing Davis, he acknowledges that some of his attacks are pure
gamesmanship designed to suss out how opponents will react: Will his
accusations throw them off stride? Will they, like Schwarzenegger,
threaten to sue?</TE>
<TE>   "His reaction showed me he wasn't ready to get into the public arena,"
South said.</TE>
<TE>   There may be yet another motive for South's incessant provocation.</TE>
<TE>   "Garry loves attention," said Rob Stutzman, spokesman for the state
Republican Party.</TE>
<TE>   Moments after the three leading Republican gubernatorial candidates
concluded their debate at the party's semiannual convention last month in
San Jose, South appeared in the hallway outside.</TE>
<TE>   "Here's a guy who can't control what comes out of his mouth," he said
scornfully of Riordan, monopolizing a pack of riveted reporters. "Now, I
can't control what comes out of my mouth--but I'm not running for
governor."</TE>
<TE>   South reserves his most personal animus for Riordan, and not just
because Riordan easily defeated Mike Woo, South's candidate, in the 1993
mayoral election.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought he was an utter embarrassment as mayor," South said.</TE>
<TE>   To the California electorate, the primary pitted Riordan against Simon
and Secretary of State Bill Jones. To South, it was a grudge match
between himself and the ex-mayor.</TE>
<TE>   "He knows me," South said. "He knows he's not at the top of my fan
list. He knows I've got the goods on him."</TE>
<TE>   After watching South mix it up in the primary, even admiring fellow
political strategists wonder if at some point his appetite for nasty
public scraps will hurt Davis eventually.</TE>
<TE>   "[Garry's] love of throwing a punch means he won't delegate that to
someone else," Puglia said. "His love of the battle is too strong at
times for him to resist. He wakes up every morning and says where's my
two-by-four?"</TE>
<TE>   South says he struggles to balance a personal life with his dual role
as Davis' campaign chief and top advisor. His mother went into the
hospital just before Thanksgiving for hip replacement surgery, and work
demands kept him from visiting the entire two months she remained there.
"I felt terrible," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The youngest of four brothers, South grew up in Miles City, Mont., a
sparse, often frigid town featured in "Lonesome Dove" that was shrinking
for lack of prospects. His father was a carpenter, his mother a maid.</TE>
<TE>   Mostly he remembers the isolation of living where virtually no
one--not rock bands, not presidential candidates--had reason to pass
through. As a teenager, he saved up money earned working alongside his
father to buy train tickets to Chicago or Denver or St. Louis, eager to
taste city life.</TE>
<TE>   His political genes trace back to his great-grandfather, Stephen
South, a Missouri pioneer elected justice of the peace in 1864. Garry's
career as a political strategist began at 25, when he managed statewide
campaigns for his brother and others, then was drafted to run Jimmy
Carter's presidential campaign in Montana.</TE>
<TE>   South moved on to regional fund-raising for the Democratic Party,
helped on an unsuccessful campaign for a U.S. Senate seat in Illinois,
then relocated to Washington for a stint as spokesman for the National
Assn. of Realtors. In the late 1980s, he joined the staff of
scandal-plagued Ohio Gov. Dick Celeste until Celeste left office.</TE>
<TE>   South's subsequent move to California was his first not motivated by
politics in decades. He arrived in Los Angeles in 1991 with no political
patron in sight, thinking he might try writing a book or a screenplay.</TE>
<TE>   After a break, however, he slid back into politics, running Republican
Gordana Swanson's unsuccessful campaign for the Los Angeles County Board
of Supervisors. His next job, as press spokesman for Woo's 1993 mayoral
campaign against Riordan, won him Davis' attention.</TE>
<TE>   He met his wife, Christine Wei-Li, on the job, when they both worked
for Woo's campaign. Their courtship began like a screwball comedy: He
thought she was a Riordan operative; she thought he was gay and had
little regard for his professional spin-doctoring.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate what you do," she told him.</TE>
<TE>   She got over it.</TE>
<TE>   Now they live in a Brentwood condominium, not far from Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   "Not a stone's throw away, exactly, but not that far either," South
said, grinning. "I'd love to live closer so I could wave to him."</TE>
<TE>   Two decades ago, South started designing liturgical vestments in his
off hours, partly to still the hamster-wheel of politics whirling in his
mind.</TE>
<TE>   He has created more than two dozen of them, elaborately decorated with
gold-bullion thread and rich brocade, pinning drafts to his living room
wall and donating finished versions to local churches.</TE>
<TE>   It's a hobby that reflects his lifelong study of religion and his
belief that it is perhaps the best way to learn about human nature. But
South also revels in its sheer weirdness.</TE>
<TE>   Even his wife thinks it's bizarre, he says, and goes right on smiling.</TE>

<HD>Bush, Mubarak Vow to Redouble Efforts for Peace</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Meeting in Washington, the leaders back a recent Saudi
initiative on the Arab-Israeli conflict.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Expressing "great alarm" at the level of hostilities engulfing
Israelis and Palestinians, President Bush said Tuesday that the United
States and Egypt have pledged to redouble their peacemaking efforts.</LD>
<LD>   Bush's comments came after he met at the White House with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak. At a news conference, both leaders also
expressed support for a recent Saudi Arabian proposal advocating full
recognition of Israel by Arab states in exchange for Israel's withdrawal
from Arab territories seized during the 1967 Middle East War.</LD>
<LD>   Bush called the Saudi initiative, which is not a formal peace plan, a
very positive development, saying that ending the violence would depend
on a "vision of peace." The president also lauded Mubarak's offer to
invite Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat for talks at the Egyptian resort of Sharm el
Sheik.</LD>
<TE>   "I appreciate any efforts, any ideas that will lay out a vision for a
peaceful resolution," Bush said. "And so I appreciate the efforts of both
leaders [Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah and Mubarak], and I applaud those
efforts of those willing to explore opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   The United States has been touting the Saudi idea in advance of Vice
President Dick Cheney's extensive tour through the Middle East, which
begins next week, a senior State Department official said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We're talking it up with people to say, here's a major Arab country
that's saying at a time of great violence that the goal is resolution and
peace with Israel. That's very important, even if this vision doesn't
solve the obstacles, even if it doesn't avoid the potholes," said the
official, who did not want to be named.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney's mission had been expected to focus on U.S. intentions
concerning Iraq, but the cycle of violence has put the Arab-Israeli
conflict, once again, at the top of the agenda.</TE>
<TE>   The Saudi idea appeared to receive a boost in the Arab world Tuesday
after talks in Jidda, Saudi Arabia, between Abdullah and President Bashar
Assad of Syria. Syria has often played the spoiler in peace efforts, and
it is widely expected to be the last of Israel's neighbors to make a
formal peace.</TE>
<TE>   The state-controlled news agencies in both Arab countries reported
full agreement between the two leaders. "Their views were identical on
all issues and ideas," according to a statement by Syria's presidential
palace.</TE>
<TE>   Arab consensus behind the Saudi idea, which is an updated form of a
proposal put forward by Saudi King Fahd in 1982, is considered critical
to converting it from an idea to a more tangible offer backed by all Arab
states. Its prospects are expected to be the subject of an Arab League
summit in Lebanon at the end of the month.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the glimmers of light provided by the Saudi initiative,
however, Bush underscored the hard reality when he emphasized Tuesday
that no peace is possible until there is a maximum effort to stop the
escalating hostilities.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said that process can't begin until Palestinian attacks against
Israeli targets end. Similar appeals to Arafat have been an almost daily
refrain for weeks out of both the White House and the State Department.</TE>
<TE>   The Egyptian leader, in turn, called on Israel to end punitive
measures toward Palestinians. "The closure of roads, the siege of towns
and villages, the demolition of houses, the collective punishment that
make progress more difficult should stop," he said. "Nothing can be
achieved through violence or resolved by force."</TE>
<TE>   Mubarak came to Washington to appeal for more active U.S. intervention
to stop the rapidly escalating violence between Palestinians and
Israelis--even if both sides resist, he said in a major address shortly
before the White House talks.</TE>
<TE>   "They should sit, whether they like it or not. We have to find a
solution. They have to break the vicious circle and sit and exchange
views with the help of the United States and Egypt and other countries,"
the Egyptian leader said Tuesday in a luncheon address to the Council on
Foreign Relations.</TE>
<TE>   But reflecting the deepening frustration here, neither U.S. nor
Egyptian officials expressed any confidence that the bloodshed would end
any time soon. In fact, the talks between Bush and Mubarak underscored
the virtual diplomatic paralysis that surrounds Israeli-Palestinian
hostilities.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said Tuesday that the United States is prepared to send special
envoy Anthony C. Zinni back to the region, but not until there was a
cease-fire and something to talk about. Zinni returned to the U.S. in
early January.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Works to Secure Southern Border</HD>
<DH>Latin America: Plan would also ease flow of people, commerce. But
Mexico is hard-pressed to pay for its part of any high-tech upgrades.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY
</DL>
<LD>U.S. Homeland Security Director Thomas J. Ridge, in Mexico to push
for a high-tech overhaul of the U.S.-Mexico border, said Tuesday that the
presidents of the two countries may embrace such an initiative at an
upcoming summit.</LD>
<LD>   The plan, dubbed the "smart border" agreement, would use technology
and data-sharing to boost security and trade. It would be modeled after a
similar plan to which the United States and Canada agreed in principle in
December.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking to reporters, Ridge and Mexican Interior Minister Santiago
Creel said they had made progress on the issue during a two-day visit by
Ridge's delegation. High-level customs, diplomatic, law enforcement and
immigration officials from both sides met.</LD>
<TE>   Ridge's visit underscored the importance to the Bush administration of
improving border controls in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks. President Bush is also under pressure from U.S. business
interests hurt by lengthy delays and inspections at border checkpoints.</TE>
<TE>   Tighter inspections have caused long waits, especially in Texas,
hurting businesses on both sides of the border. The Bush administration
is eager to improve the flow of people, vehicles and commerce.</TE>
<TE>   Declaring current border administration hopelessly outmoded, Ridge
said the plan would include new technology to instantly identify border
crossers and their vehicles, and cargo verification measures to speed
inspections. Better sharing of information also could improve security
and speed the flow of goods, vehicles and people along the 2,000-mile
border. About 300 million people and 80 million vehicles cross the border
annually.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican President Vicente Fox told reporters Tuesday after meeting
with Ridge that he would extend the cooperative spirit that his
administration has fostered with Bush to border security.</TE>
<TE>   "We have already a framework for coordination and teamwork on
migration and drugs. And we will on this subject too," Fox said.</TE>
<TE>   Using "fast lanes," in which cars are electronically identified with
cameras and computers, and data-sharing could reduce border waits, Fox
said.</TE>
<TE>   However, increasing the use of fast lanes, now used in San Diego
border crossings, would cost millions of dollars. Mexico is hard-pressed
to pay for its part of any new border infrastructure projects. Ridge, a
former Pennsylvania governor picked by Bush to lead domestic security
efforts after Sept. 11, suggested Tuesday that private enterprise might
be tapped to pay for some of the costs.</TE>
<TE>   Some Mexicans have resisted the idea floated in the Bush
administration of stationing U.S. customs and immigration officials on
Mexican territory, seeing it as an infringement of Mexican sovereignty.
Also, U.S. officials want Mexico to clamp down on its southern border,
although Mexico lacks the funds.</TE>
<TE>   Jorge Santibanez, president of the College of the Northern Border in
Tijuana, said border modernization calls for serious study, cautioning
that "a more automated border is not necessarily a more efficient one."</TE>
<TE>   "All the mechanisms that I have heard about are potentially negative
to local Mexicans who regularly cross the border," Santibanez said.
"Ultimately, we have to recognize there is a contradiction between
security and efficiency."</TE>
<TE>   Ridge said there was a good chance the plan would be embraced by Bush
and Fox when they hold their summit March 22 in Monterrey.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to have a joint vision. We can't wait for one side of the
border to solve the problems we have in common," said Creel, the Mexican
interior minister.</TE>

report.</TE>

<HD>Mideast Attacks Leave 10 Dead</HD>
<DH>Conflict: Three top militia commanders are among eight Palestinians
slain in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Two Israeli soldiers also die.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>Israel on Tuesday killed three top commanders of a militia loyal to
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat, and Palestinians fired
long-range rockets for the first time into an Israeli city, amid shrill
cries for revenge and growing despair, fear and hate.</LD>
<LD>   In rapid-fire succession, Israelis and Palestinians attacked each
other throughout the day and night and braced for more violence as
fighting here escalated to its deadliest level yet.</LD>
<LD>   The Israeli air force bombarded Palestinian targets in at least six
West Bank and Gaza Strip towns after five Israelis were killed in two
shootings--at a Tel Aviv restaurant and on a road used by Jewish
settlers--and in a suicide-bomb blast on a bus. The Al Aqsa Martyrs
Brigade, affiliated with Arafat, claimed responsibility for the attacks.
Five Palestinians and two Israeli soldiers were killed early today as
Israeli tanks and troops thrust into five areas of the Gaza Strip.</LD>
<TE>   More Israelis and Palestinians have been killed in the past week than
at any time in the last 17 months of raging bloodshed, and at a pace not
seen since the days of regional war.</TE>
<TE>   The nature of this conflict has shifted markedly. After months of
tit-for-tat violence, Israel is now engaged in a sustained military
campaign aimed at inflicting massive damage. And on the other side, the
well-organized, well-armed Al Aqsa brigade has assumed the lead in
Palestinian fighting, aimed at exacting the maximum price through
guerrilla operations.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders on both sides have clearly opted to pursue a military
solution, even though public support for one is uncertain. A poll
published in Tel Aviv on Tuesday shows that a majority of Israelis are
convinced that more military force will not improve their security and
that a significant number long for a diplomatic initiative.</TE>
<TE>   But Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said that there is "no
diplomatic horizon" to speak of and that inflicting as much damage as
possible on the Palestinians is the only way to stop the violence. Sharon
has given short shrift to two recent Arab peace initiatives--one from
Saudi Arabia's crown prince and the other from Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak.</TE>
<TE>   And Palestinian officials demanded international intervention but made
it clear that they will not act to rein in gunmen and militants, despite
requests from Washington, Europe and Israel that they do so. Militia
commanders declared that they will increase their attacks.</TE>
<TE>   For four stormy hours, Israel's deeply divided Cabinet met Tuesday to
debate additional measures against Arafat and the Palestinians. The
Cabinet decided to ban all Palestinian traffic on West Bank
roads--trapping more than a million residents in their cities or towns.
The decision on how to tighten a siege on Arafat was left up to the
military. Sharon advocated sending tanks back to Arafat's doorstep, but
his defense minister opposed the move.</TE>
<TE>   With the government considering complete reoccupation of the
Palestinian territories and the dismantling of the government that Arafat
heads, dovish Foreign Minister Shimon Peres hinted broadly Tuesday that
he will quit--a step that would further destabilize Sharon's ruling
coalition.</TE>
<TE>   Fearing new attacks, Israel put all its security services on maximum
alert today and deployed additional armed guards to gasoline stations,
bus depots, wedding halls, hotels and entertainment centers throughout
the country.</TE>
<TE>   After nightfall Tuesday in Beitunia, a suburb of the West Bank city of
Ramallah, an Israeli helicopter gunship fired a missile into a car
carrying Mohammed abu Halaweh, a senior commander of the Al Aqsa brigade,
and two other militia leaders, Fawzi Murar and Omar Qaddan. All three
were killed, and a fourth man with them was seriously wounded.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials said the men were responsible for at least 10 deadly
attacks on Israelis, including Saturday's suicide bombing in an
ultra-Orthodox Jewish neighborhood that killed 10 Israelis. The military
said Abu Halaweh was behind a December 2000 shooting that killed Binyamin
Kahane, son of the late anti-Arab rabbi Meir Kahane, and his wife.</TE>
<TE>   The Al Aqsa brigade, a militia affiliated with Arafat's Fatah
movement, emerged when the current uprising erupted in September 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Abu Halaweh previously served as bodyguard to top Fatah leader Marwan
Barghouti but dropped that job after being wounded in an assassination
attempt last year. He had also served for years in Force 17, Arafat's
presidential guard.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking Tuesday night on an Arab satellite television network,
Barghouti praised Abu Halaweh and demanded swift revenge. "His loss will
have an impact on the organization, but I'm sure his comrades will fill
his spot again and the response will come very soon," Barghouti said. The
"situation will deteriorate in the most horrible way you have ever seen,"
he later told Israeli television.</TE>
<TE>   Also Tuesday night, Palestinians fired long-range Kassam-2 rockets
into Israel, hitting an apartment building in the Negev desert town of
Sderot. It was the first time Palestinian militants who have been
carrying out trial runs with the rockets had managed to hit a target in
an Israeli city. A 1-year-old child was hurt.</TE>
<TE>   Israel immediately retaliated, dispatching fighter jets, helicopters
and warships to shell Arafat's security compound in Gaza City, his
parking lot, a police headquarters and a police academy. Early today, a
massive incursion was underway in Gaza, with dozens of tanks and armored
vehicles taking positions on the edge of Gaza City and in the northern
and southern sectors of the strip.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials had previously warned that the firing of the Kassam
rockets would be viewed as an escalation and would not be tolerated. The
missile has a range of about three miles but is not very precise.</TE>
<TE>   In another incident, eight Arab children were slightly hurt early
Tuesday when a bomb went off in their school playground in East
Jerusalem's Sour Baher village. Israeli police who arrived to investigate
ended up clashing with the students in the kind of rioting that is
typical in Palestinian-controlled areas but rare in traditionally Arab
East Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   A previously unknown Jewish extremist group claimed responsibility for
the bomb in calls to Israeli reporters. Calling itself "Revenge of the
Infants," it said it was avenging the killings of Jewish children by
Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Villagers were shocked that the region's violence had reached them.
And they were furious at what they said was the slow response time by the
Israeli police, who were called after pupils arriving at the all-boys
school discovered the explosive device. The boys said it had been
disguised to look like candy.</TE>
<TE>   Police said they arrived about 20 minutes after they were called--and
five minutes after the bomb exploded. Principal Musa Fawake said it took
a full hour before the explosives experts arrived.</TE>
<TE>   It is a sign of how badly the situation has deteriorated here that
both the police sent in to protect the people and the people who needed
the police saw each other as an enemy. The village has had rather
friendly relations with neighboring Jewish communities and has even voted
in Jerusalem elections.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the anger at experiencing what villagers saw as second-class
treatment boiled over. School officials and parents complained that they
have begged for security guards for the school--all West Jerusalem
schools have guards--but been denied.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli mayor of Jerusalem, Ehud Olmert of the right-wing Likud
Party, arrived at the school to speak to the students and parents, but he
was heckled and decided not to address the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Jerusalem Police Chief Mickey Levy said the possible role of Jewish
extremists in planting the bomb would be investigated.</TE>

</DL>
<LD>A government audit of Mexico's state-owned oil company has found
that an additional $53 million is missing, bringing to $173 million the
amount that President Vicente Fox's administration says was improperly
diverted to the oil workers union in the year before he took office.</LD>
<LD>   Federal investigators said in January that they suspected that union
leaders passed on most of the cash to the Institutional Revolutionary
Party, the former ruling party, to finance its losing presidential
campaign in 2000. The PRI, as the party is known, and union officials
have denied any wrongdoing.</LD>
<LD>   The probe of Petroleos Mexicanos, or Pemex, being conducted by the
federal auditor general is the biggest corruption case to date for Fox,
who rode into office promising to clean up the government. Authorities
said Tuesday that three officials are under house arrest in the case, but
they declined to identify them. No charges have been filed.</LD>
<TE>   PRI officials have denounced the allegations as a smear campaign with
no substantive evidence, a charge reiterated by a party spokesman
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no proof, no documentation, no communication," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although other PRI officials have said the public disclosure of the
probe amounted to a declaration of war, new party President Roberto
Madrazo, installed Monday, has said he favors a complete airing of the
charges.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation covered a two-year period, tracing the movement of
millions of dollars out of Pemex coffers to the oil workers union, known
by its Spanish initials, STPRM. The union has long been a stalwart
supporter of the PRI. The auditor general's office said it has asked the
attorney general to bring criminal charges in the case.</TE>
<TE>   Former PRI leader Dulce Maria Sauri recently called Fox's probe of
Pemex part of a campaign to discredit the state-run oil monopoly in order
to soften public opinion over privatizing the firm.</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference Tuesday, Deputy Auditor General Eduardo Romero
Ramos said former Pemex General Director Rogelio Montemayor authorized
the cash payments to the union without obtaining the board of directors'
approval or making budgetary provisions. There is no proof that the cash
was meant as a loan or that it reached the union rank and file, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been no apparent effort to recover these [funds]," Romero
Ramos said, adding that the money still has not been accounted for.
"There is no rationality whatsoever in these kinds of figures. In no
cases did the Pemex officials have the right to transfer these funds."</TE>
<TE>   Asked whom he blamed for the cash transfers, Romero Ramos said those
responsible included Montemayor, former Pemex Finance Director Juan Jose
Domene Berlanga and union chief Carlos Romero Deschamps. There was no
immediate comment from the three, but union officials have said it was
common practice for Pemex to make loans to the union.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 10, the auditor general's office presented a complaint to the
attorney general's office alleging improper transfers of about $120
million to the union. On Tuesday, Romero Ramos said that further auditing
turned up three more transfers totaling about $53 million.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman at the attorney general's office said the investigation
of the cash disappearance was continuing.</TE>

<HD>Political Violence Surges Ahead of Zimbabwe Vote</HD>
<DH>Africa: Opposition supporters tell of killings, torture. Militant
ruling party backers are blamed.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HARARE, Zimbabwe
</DL>
<LD>A gang of youths grabbed Trymore Midzi one night in December as he
was walking home. They ferried him to a secret location and, using
sticks, stones, knives, iron bars and bicycle chains, they tortured him.</LD>
<LD>   Mangled and writhing in pain, the 24-year-old was found the next
morning, dumped in a yard near his family's home in Bindura, 54 miles
north of this capital city.</LD>
<LD>   Midzi was hospitalized with a severe head injury, a broken arm and
leg, and a horrific trail of wounds from his skull to the soles of his
feet. He died a week later.</LD>
<TE>   His assailants told him his crime was simple: He was a regional
chairman for the youth league of the Movement for Democratic Change,
Zimbabwe's main opposition party. Led by Morgan Tsvangirai, a former
trade boss, the party is presenting the most formidable challenge ever to
the 22-year rule of President Robert Mugabe and his party in elections
this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   The day after Midzi was buried, his uncle was slain, apparently
because he visited the grave. Pro-government militants chased his family
members from their home and warned them that they would be killed if they
returned.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel angry. I cry every day," said Sylvia Chikuwanyanga, 42,
Midzi's mother. "They killed two people in my family, and now they are
staying in my home. What am I going to do with my family?"</TE>
<TE>   The tale of Midzi's family is not unique. The Movement for Democratic
Change says at least 107 of its members and supporters have been killed
in political violence in the last two years. Hundreds of others have been
tortured, raped or forced to flee their homes.</TE>
<TE>   Local human rights groups, political commentators and foreign aid
organizations say militant ruling party supporters are pursuing a
campaign of terror to scare people away from voting, or into voting for
their group. Mugabe himself has been accused of condoning attacks on
civilians and of using the police and the judiciary to advance his party,
the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front, or ZANU-PF.</TE>
<TE>   Government officials have denied that there has been any large-scale
violence and have blamed Movement for Democratic Change supporters for
instigating attacks. At a rally in Harare on Sunday, Mugabe called on
supporters to refrain from violence. "There must be peace," he said. "We
must vote peacefully. We have a tradition here of democracy."</TE>
<TE>   But concern has mounted as a stream of recent incidents indicates that
the bulk of the violence has been organized.</TE>
<TE>   "When it started two years ago, it was just random injuries," said Dr.
Frances Lovemore of Armani Trust, a Harare-based group that provides
medical treatment and other aid to victims of violence. "Now there is a
pattern of systematic torture."</TE>
<TE>   Lovemore said that in the last several weeks she has treated burned
and branded skin, ruptured eardrums caused by blows to the head, facial
cuts and bruises, beaten soles, and buttocks hit until they were raw.
Sexual assaults also are increasing, she said.</TE>
<TE>   A recent report by the Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum, a local rights
umbrella group, said that in most cases, victims have been abducted and
taken to bases where they are tortured, then released. The bases--places
such as school halls and community centers--are believed to number at
least two dozen, the report said, and ZANU-PF youth brigades allegedly
gather at these sites to stage attacks on opposition supporters.
Statements from victims increasingly indicate that the youth militias
involved in the violence appear to have received formal training in
methods of torment, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   "If this isn't state terrorism, then there is no definition of state
terrorism that succinctly describes what is going on," said the Rev. Tim
Neill, an Anglican priest who runs the Harare-based Zimbabwe Community
Development Trust, which assists victims of violence. "No government
should ever train its young people to attack its own citizens."</TE>
<TE>   Lovemore said her group has been treating five to 20 victims of
violence a day, a significant increase since the beginning of the year.
At least 95% of the victims said they were tortured for supporting the
opposition party, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Neill said at least 100 victims of political violence have been
referred to his organization each week for assistance. But humanitarian
aid workers acknowledge that many victims know their assailants and are
afraid to report their abuse to the police. In other instances, the
authorities have simply ignored complaints.</TE>
<TE>   "I know the men who killed my brother," Roy Midzi, 20, said as he
recalled how a mob of youths attacked friends and relatives at his
brother's grave. "They also wanted to kill me and my dad. They were
shouting, 'You are going to die [in the same way] as we did to your
brother!' "</TE>
<TE>   The family reported the case to the police, but the men have never
been questioned, much less charged, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, new laws have put curbs on political gatherings,
free speech and the right to strike. The Movement for Democratic Change
said that since the beginning of the year, 83 of its rallies have been
canceled largely because of police interference and disruptions by
ZANU-PF militants. And opposition officials have constantly been
harassed.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Mubaiwa, 26, an opposition party worker in Harare, spent five
nights in jail with her month-old son last week for participating in a
party meeting. While she was in prison, ZANU-PF militiamen went looking
for her husband, an opposition party board member. He heard them coming
and fled his house. They burned it down, but not before stealing the
family's life savings, piles of opposition fliers and several party
cards. The visibly shaken family now lives at a safe house in Harare.</TE>
<TE>   "I am willing to go and vote, but I am frightened because [ZANU-PF
militias] have said that if they see me there, they are going to kill
me," said Charles Mubaiwa, 30.</TE>
<TE>   His wife has already been disenfranchised because government
supporters recently confiscated her identification card--a prerequisite
for casting a vote.</TE>
<TE>   That tactic is being widely employed in rural areas, human rights
monitors said, as youth brigades roam the countryside seizing the
identity documents of people they suspect of supporting the opposition.</TE>
<TE>   Violence in the countryside has spiraled since March 2000, when
ruling-party militants and veterans of Zimbabwe's independence war began
occupying commercial farms owned by whites, who hold about 70% of the
country's best farmland. Mugabe's government has targeted about 5,000
such farms for redistribution to largely landless blacks.</TE>
<TE>   Although many white farmers have been forced to flee, black farm
laborers have borne the brunt of the torment. Hundreds have been forced
out of their homes and away from their voting areas.</TE>
<TE>   Scores now live in barns, and many said they were ordered to attend
meetings arranged by ruling-party supporters. If they failed to pledge
allegiance to ZANU-PF, they said, they were beaten.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, I'm afraid to go and vote, because how can I vote [like] I
really want to?" said William, 42, a farm manager in the eastern region
of Marondera who has been forced to take refuge in a barn with 180 other
laborers. He refused to give his last name for fear of retribution.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the fear, a degree of defiance has arisen. Many people said
they had purchased ZANU-PF party cards to ensure their protection but
would ultimately vote for the opposition. Others said that being
assaulted had simply increased their determination to fight for their
beliefs.</TE>
<TE>   "Beating me is only going to make me braver," said a tractor driver
known as Big Boy who was displaced from a farm in Marondera. "And I'm not
going to vote for someone who beats me."</TE>

<HD>Military Lands Exactly Where It Didn't Want To</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: The ground war is taking U.S. forces into rocky
terrain and thin air, the sort of conditions that felled the Soviets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ESTHER SCHRADER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The fierce combat unfolding in the mountains of eastern Afghanistan
is just what the Pentagon had hoped to avoid in this campaign: a battle
in which superior air power and technology aren't trump cards and
hundreds of U.S. troops are fighting hardened guerrillas in rocky
terrain, thin air and brutally cold weather.</LD>
<LD>   The large ground assault near the town of Gardez is taking the U.S.
military into precisely the sort of conditions that felled the Soviets in
Afghanistan during the 1980s--and precisely the sort of battle the
Clinton administration assiduously avoided in Kosovo.</LD>
<LD>   It is also the ground war Al Qaeda apparently wanted.</LD>
<TE>   "Cities and mountains are two places where you don't want to fight,"
said one defense official who has been involved in planning the Gardez
operation. "But if you're a terrorist and you hear that, that's where you
want to go."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the heaviest U.S. combat casualty tolls of the war--eight
servicemen dead and about 40 injured in the fighting to date--officials
said the U.S.-led force of more than 2,000 will continue battling Al
Qaeda and Taliban forces until the militants are either dead or captured.</TE>
<TE>   But Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld told reporters Monday that
the Gardez combat is not likely to mark the end of the war. Indeed, he
said future battles are expected to look more like this large-scale
operation than the air campaign that marked the war's early months.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be other battles of this type" against "sizable pockets"
of resistance scattered across the Central Asian nation until the Afghan
government can assert full control, Rumsfeld said.</TE>
<TE>Soldiers Plunging Into Vulnerable Situations</TE>
<TE>   In opting for this strategy of heavy U.S. troop deployment, the
Pentagon hopes to seal off escape routes and avoid the problems that
plagued earlier battles, when friendly Afghan forces did the heavy
fighting but let hundreds or thousands of militants flee.</TE>
<TE>   But the U.S. is knowingly plunging ahead in areas where it is most
vulnerable.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon is using MH-47 Chinook helicopters flying low to the
ground, even though it knows from hard experience in Somalia--where 18
U.S. soldiers died in an ill-fated 1993 battle that saw two Black Hawk
helicopters shot down--that the aircraft is highly susceptible to ground
fire.</TE>
<TE>   Special operations forces are engaged in risky combat and searches in
and around caves--something Pentagon officials said in the early days of
the war they wanted to avoid at all costs.</TE>
<TE>   And ground troops are fighting in rugged, snow-covered mountains at
elevations as high as 11,000 feet, where temperatures have dipped to
about 15 degrees at night, even though only a few U.S. military units
still engage in extensive cold weather training. Most U.S. troops are
using cold weather gear first designed in the 1950s, rather than the new,
high-tech materials and technologies widely available in the private
market for cold weather activities.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. forces do not have much recent experience fighting in such
conditions.</TE>
<TE>   "We're best trained for the last war that we've fought, and if you
look at the last wars, you had Somalia, the [Persian] Gulf War, back to
Vietnam," Marine Corps Capt. Ken Walker said. "All of those are very hot
environments. There are not a lot of guys who can talk about what it's
like to fight in cold weather. It is one of the hardest environments to
fight in, but it just has not been a real focus in a long time."</TE>
<TE>   The tactics and difficulties U.S. forces are facing in Gardez are
already raising some concerns among current and former military
commanders.</TE>
<TE>   "It pretty much follows the trajectory of the Soviet campaign in
Afghanistan, which was very successful at the beginning and then dragged
on for years," said retired Marine Corps Gen. Joseph P. Hoar, commander
from 1991 to 1994 of the U.S. Central Command, which has responsibility
for operations in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "If it were easy, our proxies could do it," Hoar said. "I don't think
we have any choice."</TE>
<TE>   Richard K. Betts, director of the Institute of War and Peace Studies
at Columbia University, said he hopes the Gardez fight turns out to be an
anomaly.</TE>
<TE>   "If it looks like there might be an indefinite problem of suppressing
guerrilla operations and raids by small, surviving groups of these
people, it will raise all the questions of whether this was risking
suffering the fate of the Soviets," Betts said.</TE>
<TE>   With eight U.S. servicemen dead already in the battle, a debate has
begun among current and former officers over the decision to mount a
large ground assault.</TE>
<TE>Use of Ground Forces Rejected in Kosovo</TE>
<TE>   In the 1999 effort to drive Yugoslav forces from Kosovo, Army Gen.
Wesley K. Clark called repeatedly for the use of ground troops supported
by Apache attack helicopters but was overruled by policymakers in
Washington afraid to risk casualties.</TE>
<TE>   The thinking in the current campaign by advocates of ground force is
that the only way to prove the usefulness of infantry troops is to
overcome the fear of taking casualties.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there was an element of guys wanting to see this kind of
fight," said a recently retired senior military officer. "There's a whole
school of thought that wants to get U.S. ground forces engaged. They are
afraid that if they don't get them engaged and show their utility, that
people are going to start questioning how much [money] should be
allocated to ground forces."</TE>
<TE>   But military officers said the U.S. will adapt as it goes along. While
AC-130 gunships, which attack ground forces, were never used in Somalia
to help the besieged Black Hawk choppers, they are being used extensively
in Gardez.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to learn a hell of a lot out of this engagement, so when
we go on to other projects we will do things differently," said retired
Gen. Ronald R. Fogleman, Air Force chief of staff until 1997. "I don't
think anybody will be taking people in Chinook helicopters in the same
circumstances. They may have learned a lesson from that. We'll adapt."</TE>

<DL>WOODLAND, Calif.
</DL>
<LD>Neil Roberts grew up in this dusty Central Valley town, spending
his teen years immersed in wrestling and rock 'n' roll before finding a
niche as a Navy SEAL.</LD>
<LD>   Airman Jason Cunningham was reared in New Mexico, but he called
Camarillo home. He spent holidays with his wife's family there and
planned to return to the West Coast to live.</LD>
<LD>   Matthew Commons was an altar boy as a youth, then taught Sunday school
at St. Andrew's Catholic Church in Boulder City, Nev. When college didn't
quite take, he became an Army Ranger.</LD>
<TE>   And so they came together, part of a cadre of eight troops from three
services who fought and died in the bloodiest battle of America's war on
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   In the snowcapped Afghan mountains harboring Al Qaeda and Taliban
holdouts, they came under fire Monday while being ferried into battle
aboard two helicopters.</TE>
<TE>   Details remain murky, but authorities confirmed that Roberts, 32,
survived a fall from his aircraft only to be captured and killed by enemy
fighters. Cunningham, 26, and Commons, 21, were aboard another helicopter
that was hit by rocket and small-arms fire.</TE>
<TE>   The other dead were Army Sgt. Bradley S. Crose, 27, of Orange Park,
Fla.; Army Sgt. Philip J. Svitak, 31, of Joplin, Mo.; Army Spc. Marc A.
Anderson, 30, of Brandon, Fla.; and Air Force Tech. Sgt. John A. Chapman,
36, of Waco, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   They left behind wives and young children, family and friends.
Roberts, a petty officer, left an 18-month-old son at his Norfolk, Va.,
base. Senior Airman Cunningham left his wife, Theresa, 27, of Camarillo,
and two daughters, Hannah, 2, and Kyla, 4.</TE>
<TE>   An American was killed Saturday by enemy mortar fire in the current
U.S. assault. Army Chief Warrant Officer Stanley L. Harriman, 34, of
Wade, N.C., left behind his wife, Sheila, and two children, Darbi, 6, and
Christopher, 3.</TE>
<TE>   Pfc. Commons was single. He was just settling on a plan for life.</TE>
<TE>   In Boulder City, southeast of Las Vegas, Commons excelled in soccer
and earned academic honors in high school. Math teacher Alison York
recalled a student council leader, a youth who was well-liked and
happy-go-lucky. "He was fun to have in class," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But at the University of Nevada-Reno, he struggled during freshman
year and dropped out. He joined the Army in July 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "He was searching around, confused about what he wanted to do with his
life," said his father, Greg Commons of Alexandria, Va. "We always talked
about the Marines, since his grandfather was a Marine in World War II and
I was a Marine--an embassy guard in Prague.</TE>
<TE>   "One day he called me and said: 'Well, Dad, you talked me out of being
a Marine. I joined the Army.' "</TE>
<TE>   Commons chose a risky job: airborne Ranger.</TE>
<TE>   His father was incredulous. "I said: 'What? Why?' And he said, 'Well,
Dad, this is what I want--to be the best.' "</TE>
<TE>   He talked to his son about a week ago. "He was happy with what he was
doing," Commons said. "He was proud. He was talking about making it his
career. He was a great young man."</TE>
<TE>   Cunningham was part of an elite Air Force unit that provides combat
search and rescue. He had been in Afghanistan for just a month.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't come from Camarillo, but he always considered himself a
member of the community," wife Theresa said from their home in Valdosta,
Ga., near Moody Air Force Base, where Cunningham was based.</TE>
<TE>   Cunningham met his wife while both were serving in the Navy in Naples,
Italy. He enlisted in the Air Force two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The couple spent holidays at her family's Camarillo home. His
father-in-law, 59-year-old Lito Decastro, recalled Cunningham as a quiet
and serious man, but also a loving husband and father.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a good dad, and I know that he was a good husband," Decastro
said. "My daughter is absolutely devastated. When you are in the military
you don't think you're not coming back from a mission. Jason was too
young to think he was going to die."</TE>
<TE>   Roberts grew up on Harley Street in Woodland, a farm town fast
becoming a suburb of Sacramento. His family, including 11 children, was
in seclusion Tuesday. His parents, Jan and Chris Roberts, had taken in
numerous foster children.</TE>
<TE>   "They have such a sense of family," said Gaye Pencin, a neighbor.
"Neil was just a great kid. . . . You couldn't ask for a better soldier."</TE>
<TE>   Roberts was a welterweight wrestler and set a school record for
pinning his opponent the fastest, "something outlandish like in 9
seconds," said Rick Nichols, 27, who grew up on the same street as
Roberts.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts joined the Navy right out of high school and became a
SEAL--the elite special operations unit--in 1992. For the last decade, he
was stationed on the East Coast.</TE>

<HD>A Secret Hub for the U.S. in Afghan War</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>RICHARD T. COOPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>In October, when U.S. military personnel were first spotted at
Pakistan's sprawling Shahbaz air base a short flying distance from the
Afghan border, the Pakistani government hastened to assure militant
Islamic protesters that the Americans were there for purely logistical
and defensive purposes--not for combat.</LD>
<LD>   In reality, however, the U.S. installation at Shahbaz has become the
secret hub for Special Forces commando raids, covert CIA operations and a
host of other activities aimed at rooting out Taliban and Al Qaeda
fighters in Afghanistan and developing intelligence to thwart future
terrorist attacks against the United States, according to military and
other sources familiar with the operation.</LD>
<LD>   Behind its screen of secrecy, the base appears to have played a
central role in the air war in Afghanistan. Its proximity to the Afghan
border has enabled U.S. commanders to react faster and keep planes in the
air over targets longer than would otherwise be possible.</LD>
<TE>   "Nothing beats turnaround time. Even planes flying off of aircraft
carriers have hours of flying time before they are over targets in
Afghanistan," said William M. Arkin, a military analyst at the Johns
Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies who has been studying
the Shahbaz operation.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon would neither confirm nor deny the use of Shahbaz as a
base for offensive operations. "We can't discuss specifics of our ongoing
operation," Navy Cmdr. Daniel Keesee, a spokesman for the U.S. Central
Command in Tampa, Fla., said Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   In the current assault on Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters in eastern
Afghanistan, combat search-and-rescue units based at Shahbaz have
apparently played a key role. They are the only such teams stationed
close enough to aid downed helicopters and crews in the area, a source
familiar with U.S. deployments in the region said.</TE>
<TE>   The Air Force's MC-130 Combat Talon planes from Shahbaz also have
taken part in the current fighting.</TE>
<TE>   Although media attention has focused on the U.S. use of bases in
Uzbekistan, which also borders Afghanistan, the Shahbaz facilities are
much better equipped to handle modern warplanes.</TE>
<TE>   A tent city has sprung up at the base, near the southeastern city of
Jacobabad, to house about 1,500 elite troops, according to Defense
Department sources. Army, Air Force, Marine and CIA aircraft swarm the
runways and crowd scores of fortified revetments.</TE>
<TE>   Among them are the Air Force's AC-130 gunships; the Army's MH-60L
Direct Action Penetrator helicopter, which is specially armed to support
ground assaults day or night, in all weather; the CIA and Air Force
fleets of unmanned Predator drones, which conduct aerial surveillance and
fire laser-guided missiles; and a covey of reconfigured Air Force
MC-130s.</TE>
<TE>   The MC-130s have been operating inside Afghanistan since nearly the
start of bombing Oct. 7, dropping leaflets, ferrying U.S. and coalition
commandos in and out of Afghanistan and refueling covert helicopters.</TE>
<TE>   Even the psychological warfare units that drop propaganda leaflets and
run the "Commando Solo" airborne radio broadcasting program are using
Shahbaz.</TE>
<TE>   The ability to use Shahbaz as a base for gunships appears to have been
particularly important for the U.S. campaign in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "If you can mount gunships out of Pakistan instead of more distant
bases, you have a tremendously powerful force," Arkin said.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan keeps a small guard force and a liaison officer at the base
but otherwise has withdrawn.</TE>
<TE>   At the core of the U.S. effort at Shahbaz are what the Pentagon calls
"direct action" missions: short-duration strikes by planes, gunships and
ground troops intended to seize or destroy a specific target or person.</TE>
<TE>   Some of these actions have been at the center of recent controversies
over civilian casualties, including the incident at Oruzgan, where up to
21 Afghan men were killed in a nighttime assault by U.S. troops targeting
what they thought were Taliban or Al Qaeda fighters.</TE>
<TE>   Officials say covert missions are necessary to root out the
substantial number of Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters still dispersed in
remote areas of Afghanistan and along the border with Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Operations out of Shahbaz and other bases have gathered valuable
intelligence on terrorist activities outside Afghanistan, they say.
Information from such operations led to the arrest of an entire Al Qaeda
cell in the Philippines, according to Pentagon sources.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Several dozen Israeli students have been deported since last year
under a cloud of suspicion over possible espionage, but U.S. authorities
said Tuesday that they are confident the youths were art peddlers, not
spies.</LD>
<LD>   Rumors of espionage by Israeli students have circulated for months
only to be denied by law enforcement officials, but new reports Tuesday
in the French media revived the issue, prompting Israeli officials to
dismiss the articles as "nonsense."</LD>
<LD>   The allegations were triggered by an internal memo last year at the
Drug Enforcement Administration describing "suspicious" activity by
Israeli students.</LD>
<TE>   Employees at several federal buildings around the country had noticed
dozens of young Israelis selling artwork and toys outside their
facilities.</TE>
<TE>   "The nature of the individuals' conduct," along with other factors,
"leads [DEA security] to believe the incident may well be an organized
intelligence-gathering activity," the memo said, according to a law
enforcement official familiar with the document.</TE>
<TE>   The memo cited an unconfirmed report that the students had visited
homes of government employees, apparently to peddle their art.</TE>
<TE>   But the DEA memo said there was no reason for immediate concern.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI also looked into the issue, but "we determined that there was
no counterintelligence issue here. There was no spying," according to a
bureau official who asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   No one was ever charged with espionage, but some members of the group
were deported for selling artwork without a proper work visa.</TE>
<TE>   Although he did not have an exact figure, Immigration and
Naturalization Service spokesman Russ Bergeron said that in the last year
or two, several dozen Israeli students on student or visitor visas have
been deported.</TE>
<TE>   "Their cases were handled routinely and they were removed, and that's
it," he said. There was no allegation of espionage, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Regev, spokesman for the Israeli Embassy in Washington, said the
allegation of espionage by Israeli students "is baseless."</TE>

<LD>Children riding in the rear seat of compact extended cab pickups
are almost five times as likely to be injured in a crash as children
riding in the back seats of other vehicles, a study said.</LD>
<LD>   The disparity is because of the lack of legroom and shoulder belts in
backseats, according to a study by the Children's Hospital of
Philadelphia that appears in the Journal of the American Medical Assn.</LD>

<HD>Senate Torn Over Cloning</HD>
<DH>Medicine: Prominent voices for and against using the technique on
humans speak before lawmakers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AARON ZITNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>His 13-year-old daughter at his side, Hollywood director Jerry
Zucker lamented the fact that Congress might pass a law "stopping us from
trying to save my daughter's life."</LD>
<LD>   Across Capitol Hill, Douglas Johnson, the spokesman for a leading
anti-abortion group, warned that the cure Zucker seeks for his daughter,
Katie, who has juvenile diabetes, would lead to "human embryo farms."</LD>
<LD>   And so it went Tuesday, as the Senate moved closer to a vote on
whether to ban human cloning. In dueling news conferences and a Senate
hearing, lawmakers heard emotional debate about how comprehensive a ban
should be.</LD>
<TE>   There is broad support in Congress for outlawing cloning as a way to
produce children. But some scientists and patients, including actor
Christopher Reeve, pleaded Tuesday to exempt researchers from a ban so
that they can use cloning as part of research into cures for disease or
disability.</TE>
<TE>   The House voted last year to bar cloning for any purpose, including
research, and President Bush praised that action. A Senate vote is
expected within weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, the balance in the Senate is very, very much in doubt,"
said Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.), who supports cloning for disease
research, sometimes called therapeutic cloning.</TE>
<TE>   The vision for this type of cloning, which at best is years away from
reality, is to clone a patient and dissect the resulting embryo at about
five days for its stem cells. The stem cells, in turn, would be grown
into new heart, brain or insulin-producing cells--whatever that patient
needs.</TE>
<TE>   Made this way, the cells would match the patient's genetic makeup and
would presumably be readily incorporated into the patient's body. By
contrast, transplants are currently hampered by tissue rejection, in
which the patient's body treats new tissue as foreign material to be
expelled.</TE>
<TE>   But starkly different views of the ethics for this type of
cloning--and its prospects of success--emerged at the hearings Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Some opponents said that therapeutic cloning is over-hyped and
unethical, because it turns human life into a commodity. "Creating life
simply for the purpose of destroying it is immoral, unethical and should
be illegal," Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) told the Senate Health,
Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. "The human body is not a product
to be mass produced and stripped for parts."</TE>
<TE>   Opponents also said that improved cloning techniques would inevitably
lead doctors to offer "designer babies," with specific traits selected by
parents. "The parent becomes the architect; the child becomes the
ultimate shopping experience," said Jeremy Rifkin, a noted technology
critic and liberal, at a news conference.</TE>
<TE>   Yet others predicted that a large demand would develop for human eggs,
which are required in cloning. Poor women might try to make money by
repeatedly donating their eggs, even though "adequate long-term safety
data" on donations is lacking, said Judy Norsigian, executive director of
the Boston Women's Health Book Collective, author of the book "Our
Bodies, Ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the research say that a 5-day-old embryo is not
equivalent to a human being. They argued Tuesday that, with adequate
regulation, no embryo would leave the laboratory or be implanted in a
woman's womb to produce a child.</TE>
<TE>   Cloning might "relieve the suffering of millions," said Reeve, whose
1995 horseback-riding accident left him paralyzed from the shoulders down
and unable to breathe without a ventilator.</TE>
<TE>   Barring the research, Reeve told the Senate panel, would be
"condemning a lot of people to unnecessary suffering and death."</TE>
<TE>   There is some chance that the Senate will fail to pass any measure.
Johnson, of the National Right to Life Committee, said that no law is
preferable to a law that permits therapeutic cloning.</TE>
<TE>   A therapeutic cloning law, he said, would allow the creation of cloned
embryos and then mandate their destruction, since bringing those embryos
to term would be illegal.</TE>
<TE>   Zucker and several other Hollywood figures recently formed a group to
promote stem cell research and other related technologies. Some members
were in Washington to lobby senators.</TE>
<TE>   The new National Stem Cell Research Coalition includes Zucker, his
wife, Janet, and producer Doug Wick and his wife, Lucy Fisher, the former
vice chairman of Sony Pictures. Like the Zuckers, Wick and Fisher have a
daughter with diabetes.</TE>
<TE>   Wick said the group was created about a month ago and had raised
$600,000.</TE>

<HD>Clergy Abuse Settlement Is Reported Near</HD>
<DH>Law: Boston Archdiocese is said to agree to pay $20 million to $30
million to 86 adults in molestation cases involving former priest
Geoghan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON
</DL>
<LD>After 11 months of secret negotiations, the Boston Archdiocese of
the Catholic Church was poised Tuesday to sign an agreement to pay $20
million to $30 million to 86 adults who say they were sexually abused by
defrocked priest John J. Geoghan, according to parties close to the
discussions.</LD>
<LD>   A proposed settlement comes on the eve of a scheduled deposition of
Cardinal Bernard F. Law, the most senior Roman Catholic prelate in the
United States. As a result of the agreement, Law will avoid a deposition
in which he would have been asked questions about what church officials
knew about pedophilia in the clerical ranks--and what they did or did not
do about it.</LD>
<LD>   Law and the archdiocese here have been at the center of a storm over
clerical sexual abuse that has swept across America since Geoghan was
convicted in January of molesting one boy 10 years ago.</LD>
<TE>   From Trenton, N.J., to Tucson, Ariz., allegations have surfaced that
dozens of parish priests abused hundreds of victims. Most priests have
been removed from duty, and many face criminal charges.</TE>
<TE>   In Boston alone, lawyers for the archdiocese have provided prosecutors
with the names of more than 90 priests accused of sexual misconduct over
at least 40 years.</TE>
<TE>   Though the issue of pedophilia in the clergy is not new, the current
crisis has reached new proportions. Based on information from the Geoghan
case showing that church officials knew of the abuse and did not protect
parishioners, devout Catholics across the country have expressed serious
doubts about the spiritual backbone of their church, the priesthood.</TE>
<TE>   "We are suffering collectively," said Father Robert Silva, president
of the National Federation of Priests' Councils in Chicago. "Our
credibility and our profession are suffering."</TE>
<TE>   A party involved in the Geoghan case negotiations, who asked not to be
named, said Tuesday that awards to claimants will be determined by an
arbitrator. Some awards will go to parents of victims, but most will go
to men and women who say they were molested as children.</TE>
<TE>   The archdiocese here has admitted paying about $15 million since the
mid-1990s to an additional 100 of Geoghan's alleged victims.</TE>
<TE>   Geoghan is serving a nine- to 10-year sentence following his January
conviction. He faces additional criminal charges in two cases.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed figure in Boston of $20 million to $30 million follows a
pattern of high settlements in similar cases. In Dallas, $23.4 million
was paid to nine altar boys. In New Mexico, the archdiocese paid about
$50 million to settle about 45 suits.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell Garabedian, the attorney for the 84 victims covered by the
new settlement, said Tuesday that since 1994 he has represented "118
individuals claiming to have been molested by Father James J. Geoghan,
over 28 years in five parishes."</TE>
<TE>   The biggest legal obstacle, according to Garabedian, is the church's
position that the 1st Amendment protects the free exercise and expression
of religion.</TE>
<TE>   "For decades," Garabedian said, they have been saying, don't bother us
in a legal sense because of the 1st Amendment, don't bother us in a moral
sense because we are people of God and don't bother us in a spiritual
sense because we will still celebrate Mass on Sunday."</TE>
<TE>   Garabedian also said alleged victims are confronted with such
questions about their credibility that many fail to come forth--or wait
many years before bringing charges.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, pursuing such claims becomes even more difficult because
of the enormous authority of the Catholic Church.</TE>
<TE>   "You start out looking like the bad guy in these cases. You're not
even treated seriously at first," Garabedian said.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson Rogers Jr., an attorney for the archdiocese here, did not
return calls for comment.</TE>
<TE>   A statement released Monday by the archdiocese said: "Our objective is
to bring healing and justice to all of the victims. As the church, we
have a moral obligation to do what is right and just, and that is our
objective as we strive to reach fair resolutions to these cases."</TE>
<TE>   An agreement had been expected Tuesday, but late in the day, both
sides were still meeting in secret negotiations with a mediation service.</TE>
<TE>   Among U.S. Catholics, said Silva, the Boston archdiocese carries
special weight. That may help explain why a single case involving one
priest unleashed such an avalanche.</TE>
<TE>   "Boston was a pillar of the church in this country," said Silva.
"Boston has the cardinal who stood . . . for right and good. We've held
Boston in such esteem."</TE>
<TE>   When "the plug was pulled in the Geoghan case"--confirming in legal
documents that church officials were aware of that priest's pattern of
abuse--"that opened the floodgate," Silva said.</TE>
<TE>   Since the policies involving Geoghan came to light, Law has lamented
the "tragically flawed" decision to move the priest from parish to
parish. The cardinal also has publicly apologized.</TE>
<TE>   Law has convened a task force of experts to help guide the archdiocese
as it navigates the pedophilia scandal. He has urged parishioners to
speak out about the problem.</TE>
<TE>   But Garabedian, for one, remained skeptical.</TE>
<TE>   "Asking the archdiocese of Boston to purge themselves of pedophiles is
like asking a pedophile to cure himself. It's not going to happen.
There's a subculture of darkness within the archdiocese."</TE>

<HD>Research Links Air Pollution to Lung Cancer</HD>
<DH>Health: People in the smoggiest U.S. cities are said to face a
malignancy risk 20% greater than those living in cleaner areas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY POLAKOVIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a new study of air pollution, scientists Tuesday reported a link
between hazy skies over U.S. cities and life-threatening illnesses,
including lung cancer.</LD>
<LD>   A link to cancer had long been suspected but not established. Now a
team of researchers from Canada, New York and Utah has found that people
living in hazy cities across the nation are more likely to die of lung
cancer, heart attacks and respiratory failure than people in communities
with cleaner air.</LD>
<LD>   They found that for every 10 micrograms of tiny particles swirling in
the air, the risk of dying of lung cancer increased by 8%. Someone living
in heavily polluted Bakersfield or Rubidoux, Calif., faces a risk 20%
greater than someone living in Pueblo, Colo.</LD>
<TE>   While the threat pales in comparison with cigarette smoking or
exposure to toxic chemicals in factories, it is comparable to the hazard
posed by secondhand smoke, according to the American Lung Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "This study provides the most definitive epidemiological evidence to
date that long-term exposure to air pollution is associated with lung
cancer deaths," said George Thurston, a co-author of the study and
associate professor of environmental medicine at New York University.</TE>
<TE>   The report is being published today in the Journal of the American
Medical Assn. It followed more subjects, about 500,000 adults, for 16
years, longer than any other study of its kind and included 156 cities,
ranging from Buffalo to Los Angeles and from Pittsburgh to Huntington,
Ala.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers from Brigham Young University, the University of Ottawa,
NYU and the American Cancer Society participated in the study. It was
funded by grants from the National Institutes of Health and other
government agencies.</TE>
<TE>   The study comes during a time of intense political debate over the
future of air pollution controls, and clean-air advocates seized upon it
to challenge the Bush administration's recent attempts to alter the
nation's clean-air regulations.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, the White House unveiled a new anti-smog strategy for
industrial and power plant emissions, but environmentalists and many air
quality officials rejected it as an attempt to roll back pollution
controls.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the EPA's chief of air pollution enforcement resigned in
protest over Bush administration policies he said are weakening clean-air
rules, particularly those that require power plants to install the most
modern emission control equipment. Emissions from power plants are a
major source of haze in national parks and in the eastern half of the
country.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes no sense to weaken the Clean Air Act in light of this
important new evidence. It raises urgency to moving forward to reduce
fine particles," said A. Blakeman Early, a consultant to the American
Lung Assn.</TE>
<TE>   The new study will likely lend support to maintaining the nation's
standard for regulating fine-particle pollution.</TE>
<TE>   The standard, which was approved in 1997 and affirmed by the U.S.
Supreme Court, targets particles that are 2.5 microns or smaller. Health
experts say the latest study reinforces the need to retain that air
pollution standard and hasten air pollution cleanup.</TE>
<TE>   "This study is good news because it shows our efforts in the past and
current efforts to improve our air quality are not in vain but will in
fact result in significant improvements in public health," said C. Arden
Pope, the lead author of the study and an environmental epidemiologist at
BYU.</TE>
<TE>   For years, air pollution cleanup has focused on ways to reduce ozone,
a gas that reduces respiratory function. Yet, more and more studies
implicate microscopic particles that form haze as a serious health risk.
While ozone levels are generally in decline nationwide, and dramatically
so in Southern California, progress against particle pollution is more
modest.</TE>
<TE>   Haze comes from dust and soot. Significant sources include farm
equipment, dust blowing off unpaved roads, diesel trucks and buses and
portable generators.</TE>
<TE>   The most dangerous particles are the smallest specks, which can float
in the air for weeks, circumnavigate the globe and bypass the body's
defenses to lodge deep in the lungs. Those particles come primarily from
fossil fuel combustion, and some are formed when emissions from power
plants, factories and vehicles react with sunlight to form microscopic
bits.</TE>
<TE>   California has some of the nation's highest particle pollution levels,
due in part to its geography. Valleys surrounded by mountains tend to
trap the haze created by cars and factories.</TE>
<TE>   "We recognize it [particle pollution] as a major problem," said
Shankar Prasad, health advisor to the California Air Resources Board.</TE>
<TE>   Yet even in the latest study, scientists remain puzzled over which
component of particle pollution is most injurious to health. Some say it
may be a specific component while others say the sheer volume of
particles in the air is dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   "It may just be the insult of particles and the reaction they
instigate in the lung," said Morton Lippmann, director of the Particulate
Matter Health Research Center at NYU.</TE>

<LD>A Kentucky judge has refused to hear the appeal of a woman who was
fined $100 for returning to her husband after she had obtained a
restraining order against him.</LD>
<LD>   Fayette Circuit Court Judge Rebecca Overstreet dismissed the case late
last month, saying the woman could not pursue an appeal because she had
paid the fine--or rather, an advocacy group for battered women had paid
it on her behalf. Paying the fine amounted to "an admission of guilt,"
and so the appeal was moot, Overstreet ruled.</LD>

<LD>United Airlines mechanics and aircraft cleaners approved a contract
that will give them their first raise since 1994 and end a bitter
two-year dispute.</LD>
<LD>   The contract was ratified by 59% of the voting membership. Under the
new contract, senior mechanics' pay would go from the current $25.60 an
hour to $35.14, or about $73,000 a year. For top-scale aircraft cleaners,
hourly pay would increase 19% to $19.76 an hour, or about $41,000 a year.</LD>
<LD>   The approval averted a strike that could have started as soon as 9:01

<HD>Despite Less Worry Over Finances, Americans Are Saving More</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEAN GILL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Americans are saving more and spending less as a result of the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, but most are less worried about their
finances than they were a year ago, according to a consumer survey
released Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Younger and less affluent people and families were most likely to
worry that they had too much debt and too little savings, the survey
reported. It was commissioned by the Consumer Federation of America and
Bank of America.</LD>
<LD>   In light of the findings, the organizations announced the expansion of
a major educational campaign to help individuals save and build wealth.</LD>
<TE>   "The events of Sept. 11 have caused Americans to reassess their
priorities and take steps to shore up their balance sheets," said Lynn
Reaser, chief economist for Banc of America Financial Services.
"Individuals seem less willing to take financial risks and are adopting a
more conservative approach to spending and living."</TE>
<TE>   Conducted in mid-February, the survey asked 1,000 adults how Sept. 11
had affected their thinking about their personal finances.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty-three percent said they had more interest in personal savings
and 36% said they were less interested in luxury purchases.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate question, 46% said they were less willing to invest in
stocks and mutual funds after the collapse of energy giant Enron Corp.
The margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage points.</TE>
<TE>   Reaser said the terrorist attacks had made Americans less likely to
purchase big items or make large financial commitments, a "sobering
effect" contrasting speculation that Americans would want to spend more
freely. But somewhat surprisingly, she said, a belief that the economy is
improving had made them less worried about their financial security.</TE>
<TE>   Lower tax rates, lower energy costs related to a mild winter,
refinancing opportunities and rising home prices contributed to the
increase in consumer confidence, Reaser said. Increased financial
prudence and low levels of credit debt have also made people more
confident, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Reaser said she believes the trend toward increased saving will endure
because a shift in values has lessened Americans' emphasis on
accumulating material goods, particularly among young people.</TE>
<TE>   The survey supports forecasts of a modest economic recovery, she said.</TE>
<TE>   One-third of Americans worry about their financial status, said
Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the Consumer Federation, a
nonprofit association of about 300 consumer advocate groups. Young
adults, ages 18 to 34, were most worried about the amount of debt and the
adequacy of their savings.</TE>
<TE>   Brobeck announced the expansion of the America Saves program, a
financial literacy campaign offering motivational workshops, hotlines,
newsletters and savers clubs.</TE>
<TE>   "The America Saves campaign encourages and persuades Americans to save
and build wealth more effectively," Brobeck said.</TE>
<TE>   People enrolling in the program work to define and achieve savings
goals. The program makes no-fee savings accounts available and will soon
offer free financial consultations. More information, including a
personal finance calculator, is available online at
http://www.americasaves.org.</TE>

<HD>Steel Decision Could Firm Up GOP Political Foundation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Though fine-tuned to the complexities of a single industry,
President Bush's decision on steel tariffs could become a factor in
national politics with control of Congress at stake this year and the
White House in 2004.</LD>
<LD>   Generally an advocate of free trade, Bush faced a dilemma on this
issue. U.S. steelmakers argued that heavily subsidized foreign
competition was victimizing their industry. If he disregarded them, the
president might have paid a price politically in several states important
to his chances for reelection.</LD>
<LD>   His decision to impose a range of tariffs on some imported steel
products did not give the domestic industry all the protection it had
sought, but it pleased many of the industry's allies--including the
politically important steelworkers' union--and bought the GOP a large
measure of goodwill in those swing states.</LD>
<TE>   Many Republicans asserted with satisfaction that Bush had in one
stroke done more to help the industry than his Democratic predecessor had
in eight years--a contrast they will undoubtedly drive home in
steel-producing states such as West Virginia and Pennsylvania in upcoming
elections.</TE>
<TE>   "It's clear that putting Bush on the side of steelworkers and U.S.
jobs and working-class Americans is a political plus," said Stuart
Rothenberg, a Washington political analyst. "It's a clear political win
for Bush, to be able to go into those states, go to members of Congress
and say, 'Look what I did for you and your folks.' "</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, there were critics of the steel decision. Some Democrats
said Bush did not go far enough. Many Republicans would have preferred
little or no action. But their objections were muted.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly what the president did could have been worse," said Sen.
Phil Gramm (R-Texas), an ardent free-trader. But the allegiance of
Gramm's state to Bush, former governor of Texas, is not in doubt.</TE>
<TE>   The president stands to gain from Tuesday's action in West Virginia, a
traditionally Democratic state, where he scored an upset over Democratic
candidate Al Gore in 2000 by capturing 52% of the vote. And Bush is
seeking to wrest Pennsylvania, which Gore won with 51%, into the
Republican column. Both states have been hit hard by the decline of the
U.S. steel industry.</TE>
<TE>   "Those West Virginians and Pennsylvanians are not unimportant to
[Bush's] political objectives in the longer haul," said Thomas Mann, a
scholar of the presidency and Congress at the Brookings Institution. For
Bush loyalists, every state matters as the president seeks to build on
his narrow electoral victory in 2000 after losing the popular vote.</TE>
<TE>   The sensitivity of the steel issue in presidential politics was
recognized in 1992, when Democratic presidential candidate Bill Clinton
visited a steel plant in Weirton, W. Va., promised to keep foreign
companies from selling cheap steel in the United States and won the
state.</TE>
<TE>   There was bitterness eight years later after Clinton pursued
free-trade policies that allowed the overseas competition to continue. So
in October 2000, GOP vice presidential candidate Dick Cheney showed up in
the same city and declared, "If our trading partners violate trade laws,
we will respond swiftly and firmly and enforce our laws." Steel was not
the only issue in the state at the time, but it was crucial--and Bush and
Cheney carried the state by 40,000 votes.</TE>
<TE>   The effect of Tuesday's action on congressional politics is less
clear. The issue is not likely to play heavily in the Senate because this
year's competitive contests lie outside the Midwestern and mid-Atlantic
Steel Belt.</TE>
<TE>   In the House, only a few dozen of the 435 races this year are expected
to be truly competitive, and only some of those are in steel states.
Bush's action could boost the fortunes of Republican candidates in
Maryland, Indiana, Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania who have
steelworker constituencies.</TE>
<TE>   But some Democrats were gearing up to challenge Bush for failing to do
enough for steel. Democratic operatives cited the candidacy of Ed
O'Brien, a steelworker who is challenging Rep. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.),
as evidence that they could turn the argument to their benefit.</TE>
<TE>   The steel decision also appeared likely to play a role in debate on a
major trade bill moving through Congress. Last December, by a one-vote
margin, Bush won House approval of the bill that allows him to negotiate
trade deals on behalf of the United States. Under the bill, Congress
would give up its right to amend trade deals the president may reach in
the next few years and would be able only to approve or reject them in
up-or-down votes.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation is pending in the Senate, where it is expected to
pass. But the House may be forced to vote again on the legislation after
differences between the House and Senate versions are reconciled. If
another House vote is taken, about three dozen Republicans from
steel-producing states who provided crucial support for Bush's trade bill
in December would be able to point to the tariff decision to justify
another vote for the president's position.</TE>
<TE>   "Politically, this will probably give some comfort to Republicans who
want to stick with the administration," said Bill Samuel, a lobbyist for
the AFL-CIO, which opposes the trade bill.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Robert W. Ney (R-Ohio), who cast a difficult vote for the
president's trade bill in December, told reporters Tuesday that "we would
have had a lot of trouble" politically if Bush's steel decision had gone
against the industry.</TE>

<HD>Daschle Warns He'll Extend Sessions on 'Soft Money' Bill</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Thwarted again in his attempt to bring campaign finance legislation
to a final vote, Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle on Tuesday threatened
all-night sessions to overcome any filibuster by opponents.</LD>
<LD>   Daschle (D-S.D.) said he is committed to sending the bill to the White
House before Congress leaves for its two-week Easter recess at the end of
this month.</LD>
<LD>   Even if supporters gain the 60 votes needed to limit debate, Senate
rules provide opponents with 30 hours to debate the measure. Daschle said
he is prepared to keep the Senate in session all night if necessary.</LD>
<TE>   The legislation would ban corporations, unions and individuals from
making unregulated "soft money" donations to national political parties
and would restrict, in the final days of a campaign, "issue ads" that are
often thinly disguised means to attack candidates.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate passed its bill last April, and the House passed a similar
measure last month. Senate supporters want to pass the House bill,
avoiding a House-Senate conference, and send the measure directly to
President Bush. He is expected to sign it.</TE>
<TE>   With no resolution on campaign reform, the Senate Tuesday moved on to
work on a major energy bill.</TE>

<HD>Anti-Semitism Charge Taints Illinois Congressional Race</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO
</DL>
<LD>With two weeks left before the Democratic primary, the
congressional race featuring ex-Clinton aide Rahm Emanuel has taken a
nasty turn, with personal attacks and accusations of anti-Semitism.</LD>
<LD>   The latest dust-up involves remarks made Monday by a supporter of
candidate Nancy Kaszak about Emanuel, who is Jewish.</LD>
<LD>   At a celebration honoring a Polish general of the Revolutionary War,
Polish American Congress President Ed Moskal said that Emanuel was a
citizen of Israel and served for two years in the Israeli army.</LD>
<TE>   He also called Emanuel, 42, a "millionaire carpetbagger who knows
nothing about our values, our causes, our expectations or our heritage."</TE>
<TE>   The comments about Emanuel's background are untrue; Kaszak repudiated
the remarks as well as the support of Moskal and his group.</TE>
<TE>   But Emanuel, the former top advisor to President Clinton, contends
they reflect a "whispering campaign" of anti-Semitism against him in the
district.</TE>
<TE>   Emanuel called the comments "garbage," and his campaign noted that
although Kaszak was in the audience when they were made, she did not
repudiate them until hours later.</TE>
<TE>   Kaszak, a 51-year-old Polish American who has received strong support
from the large Polish community, said she has never sensed an
undercurrent of anti-Semitism on the campaign trail. The former state
lawmaker said she would rather focus on Emanuel's record in the White
House and the private sector, which she says has hurt working Americans.</TE>
<TE>   EMILY's List, a national political network for Democratic women who
support abortion rights, is backing Kaszak.</TE>

<HD>Spacewalkers Prepare for Risky Hubble Fix</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.
</DL>
<LD>Spacewalking astronauts prepped the Hubble Space Telescope on
Tuesday for its riskiest surgery yet: a power-unit replacement that has
been likened to a heart transplant.</LD>
<LD>   If the operation fails, the $2-billion-plus telescope could be
crippled or rendered useless.</LD>
<LD>   "Any major surgery entails a certain degree of risk," cautioned
Hubble's project scientist Dave Leckrone.</LD>
<TE>   Surgery was scheduled for this morning during the third spacewalk in
as many days for shuttle Columbia's astronauts.</TE>
<TE>   Assigned to the task: John Grunsfeld, an astrophysicist who has
operated on Hubble before, and Richard Linnehan, a veterinarian who has
cut into animals but not a 43-foot telescope.</TE>
<TE>   NASA said it had little choice but to replace Hubble's original power
control unit, a long, narrow box with 36 connectors jammed together.</TE>
<TE>   The 12-year-old unit has a loose screw that is hampering its ability
to circulate electricity through the telescope. The problem has occurred
on and off for eight years.</TE>
<TE>   If the power trouble worsened, astronomers would be able to use only
one of Hubble's scientific instruments at a time. In the worst case, some
of the telescope's batteries could overheat, rupture and wreck Hubble.</TE>
<TE>   Before the repair work could begin, power to the telescope had to be
turned off completely for the first time in orbit. NASA could not
guarantee that all of Hubble's systems would come to life once the new
power control unit was plugged in and the telescope turned back on.</TE>
<TE>   Ground controllers will be racing against the clock; the systems
cannot be without power too long, otherwise they could be damaged by the
cold.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, spacewalkers James Newman and Michael Massimino loosened
bolts on the doors leading to the power control unit and batteries. The
men also installed Hubble's second new solar wing and replaced an
unreliable steering mechanism.</TE>

<HD>Crematory Operator Faces 56 New Counts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LAFAYETTE, Ga.
</DL>
<LD>Authorities filed 56 additional charges Tuesday against a northwest
Georgia crematory operator accused of discarding hundreds of corpses he
was paid to cremate.</LD>
<LD>   The new charges bring to 174 the number of counts of theft by
deception against Ray Brent Marsh, who remains in Walker County Jail. A
magistrate denied Marsh bond Monday, noting that investigators were
likely to file further charges.</LD>
<LD>   So far, 339 bodies have been discovered dumped in pits, left in sheds
and stacked in vaults at the Tri-State Crematory. Officials said 100
bodies have been identified.</LD>
<TE>   "Hopefully we have found all of them," Walker County Emergency
Management Agency Director David Ashburn said Tuesday. "We are scaling
back now."</TE>
<TE>   Ashburn said all but about one acre of pine grove has been cleared and
the ground scraped several feet deep.</TE>
<TE>   The draining of a lake at the back of the 16-acre crematory grounds is
expected to be completed by the end of the week. A torso and skull that
were previously spotted in the lake have not been recovered, Ashburn
said.</TE>
<TE>   He said inspections of areas around the edge of the lake as the water
level started dropping turned up no bodies. Officials said the silty lake
bottom would have to dry for an additional week before they could finish
inspecting it.</TE>
<TE>   The charges against Marsh accuse him of taking payment to cremate the
dead but then passing off cement powder and dirt as ashes.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators have said Marsh told them the incinerator was broken.</TE>
<TE>   But on Monday, authorities disclosed for the first time that the
incinerator is working properly. State emergency agency spokeswoman Lisa
Ray said the machine's manufacturer successfully tested it last week.</TE>
<TE>   In another disclosure, prosecutor Buzz Franklin said investigators had
discovered photos of decomposed bodies on Marsh's office computer.
Franklin did not say why Marsh was storing the photos and declined to
elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Magistrate Judge Jerry Day, noting more charges were likely, denied
Marsh bail for a third time. Prosecutors said they were worried Marsh
might be killed if he is released.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff Steve Wilson testified that at a victims' meeting one woman
said she wanted to hang Marsh, and the threat was met with thunderous
applause.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Ken Poston criticized the prosecution for discussing
the threats.</TE>
<TE>   "If that isn't inviting trouble and torches and ropes, then I don't
know what is," Poston said.</TE>

<HD>Cheney Records Must Be Released, Judge Rules</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A federal judge Tuesday rebuffed the Bush administration on a
lawsuit concerning Vice President Dick Cheney's energy task force and
ordered six federal agencies to release records within the next two
months.</LD>
<LD>   Ruling in a case filed nearly a year ago, U.S. District Judge Paul
Friedman said the Bush administration has had sufficient time to collect
thousands of pages of material from its files. Also covered by Friedman's
order is the White House Office of Management and Budget.</LD>
<LD>   The agencies must release the material promptly or itemize the
documents they want to keep confidential so that the lawsuit filed by the
conservative group Judicial Watch can proceed, the judge said.</LD>
<TE>   OMB found 374 documents in its files on the Cheney task force and has
released six of them, saying the rest should remain secret because they
are internal agency memorandums.</TE>
<TE>   Friedman's decision is the second in two weeks by a federal judge
setting a timetable for the prompt release of materials on the Cheney
energy task force. The Bush administration is trying to keep confidential
the names of industry executives and lobbyists who met with the White
House as it formulated national energy policy a year ago and what the
participants discussed.</TE>
<TE>   "The administration has never disputed the necessity of producing
information required by law to be made public," said Justice Department
spokeswoman Barbara Comstock.</TE>
<TE>   "The process of sorting through thousands of documents to determine
which the law requires federal agencies to disclose and which Congress
has protected from public disclosure, is often laborious and
time-consuming," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The administration argued that the case before Friedman should be
dismissed because it was filed a week too soon. But Friedman refused to
throw out the case, saying that some agencies still haven't responded to
the document requests.</TE>
<TE>   "In these circumstances, it would be putting form over substance to
dismiss the complaint" and require Judicial Watch "to start all over
again by filing a new complaint," Friedman wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The judge said the Environmental Protection Agency is withholding
19,500 pages on the Cheney task force. The EPA's deadlines are March 25
for releasing documents and April 25 to identify documents it seeks to
keep secret.</TE>
<TE>   Other agencies involved in the order are Interior, Agriculture,
Energy, Transportation and Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   The Commerce Department has 9,000 pages of documents regarding the
Cheney task force, and the Transportation Department has 6,000 pages.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler ruled Feb. 21 that the Energy
Department must release records relating to the Cheney task force
starting March 25 and must provide a list by late April of the documents
it intends to keep secret. The Energy Department says it has 7,500 pages
relating to the task force.</TE>
<TE>   The General Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm, also has
filed a lawsuit against Cheney, trying to force disclosure of the
material.</TE>

<HD>Yates' Mother Fights Tears, Defends Daughter at Trial</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON
</DL>
<LD>Andrea Yates' elderly mother choked back tears Tuesday while
defending her daughter as a wonderful parent, and testified that her
"baby daughter" was not the same woman who drowned her five children.</LD>
<LD>   Jutta Kennedy took the stand in her daughter's defense for a very
brief time, providing emotional punctuation to days of testimony from
psychiatric experts in Yates' capital murder trial.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier in the day, a noted psychiatrist testified for the defense
that Yates knew drowning the children was illegal, but said Yates thought
it was the right thing to do because it was the only way to save them
from the fires of hell.</LD>
<TE>   Yates, a 37-year-old former nurse and high school valedictorian, cited
a long history of mental problems in pleading not guilty by reason of
insanity. Yates, who could face the death penalty if convicted, has
confessed to drowning her children methodically in the bathtub of their
Houston home on June 20, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy has come to all of her daughter's court dates, but this was
the first time she testified.</TE>
<TE>   "She's my baby daughter," Kennedy said, her voice catching as tears
streamed down her face, when asked by defense lawyer George Parnham to
describe her relationship with the defendant.</TE>
<TE>   "She was a wonderful mother, a wonderful daughter," Kennedy answered,
locking eyes with her child.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy choked back tears and dabbed her eyes throughout her 10
minutes on the witness stand, while her daughter sat motionless, as she
has throughout much of the trial.</TE>
<TE>   Parnham also asked Kennedy about the death of her husband last year,
which the defense has suggested triggered Yates' downward mental spiral.</TE>
<TE>   "She was very attached to her father," she said. "It hit her pretty
hard."</TE>
<TE>   Parnham asked Kennedy her reaction when she learned what her daughter
had done.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't believe it," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Was this the Andrea you knew to be a loving mother?" Parnham asked.</TE>
<TE>   "No," she replied.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors declined to ask her any questions.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Wife, 2 Others Killed at Michigan Courthouse</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MOUNT PLEASANT, Mich.
</DL>
<LD>A man shot and killed his ex-wife and two other people in a
courthouse parking lot Tuesday, then holed up for several hours inside
his home before surrendering, police said.</LD>
<LD>   The shooting was a "domestic-type of deal," said police officer
Charles Lyon.</LD>
<LD>   The three victims had been headed to a probation hearing at the
Isabella County Courthouse. Lyon said authorities believed they were
going to testify against the suspect, Thomas Wendt.</LD>
<TE>   It was not immediately known why Wendt was on probation, but Lyon said
he had been in court before for a domestic violence case, among other
charges.</TE>
<TE>   "He has a long history in the court," Lyon said.</TE>
<TE>   Police said they believe Wendt waited in his car, then used a shotgun
to kill his ex-wife, Vicki Sue Keller-Wendt, Brandie Keller and Douglas
McCoy. It was not clear how the victims were related.</TE>
<TE>   The shooting occurred about 10:30 a.m. Police later surrounded Wendt's
home in nearby Weidman, where authorities negotiated with him, said
William Yeagley, public safety director of the Mount Pleasant police.</TE>
<TE>   He surrendered shortly after 5 p.m. and was taken into custody. He was
charged with one count of murder.</TE>
<TE>   Mount Pleasant, population 26,000, is 60 miles north of Lansing. It is
the site of Central Michigan University and a casino that draws thousands
of visitors a day.</TE>
<TE>   "Crime happens in Mount Pleasant, but not shootings in broad daylight
in front of the courthouse," said Denise Walton, owner of a small
business.</TE>

<HD>Riordan Is Gracefully Stoic in Defeat</HD>
<DH>The former L.A. mayor's optimism turns to resignation as he comes
face to face with his first election loss.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETH SHUSTER</AU>
<AU>SCOTT GLOVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan first faced voting day
Tuesday with the outward optimism of someone never before defeated and
then with the resignation of a candidate on the brink of his first--and
perhaps last--loss.</LD>
<LD>   Before he formally conceded the race and announced his support for
Pacific Palisades businessman Bill Simon Jr., Riordan sat quietly
watching television election coverage in a posh suite at the LAX Westin
Hotel.</LD>
<LD>   "It's negative for me," said Riordan, who badly trailed Simon in the
Republican gubernatorial primary. At one point in the evening, he hoped
that things might improve after all the ballots were counted, but he soon
came to doubt that.</LD>
<TE>   "It's still negative for me," Riordan said.</TE>
<TE>   Surrounded by supporters who have backed him since he ran for mayor
nine years ago, Riordan ended his evening as the apparent loser with a
graceful stoicism.</TE>
<TE>   As he prepared to meet a ballroom of disappointed but cheering
supporters, the 71-year-old businessman and lawyer offered upbeat sound
bites about his determination to resume his longtime interest in
education and other statewide issues such as housing and transportation.</TE>
<TE>   "My wife and I have more mountains to climb," he said. "We are very
interested in helping disadvantaged kids. . . ."</TE>
<TE>   He said he had no regrets.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel good," Riordan said. "I haven't done anything to make myself
feel worse."</TE>
<TE>   For much of the day, Riordan appeared relaxed--even jovial--as he
displayed the goofy enthusiasm that has distinguished him from a field of
otherwise buttoned-down candidates.</TE>
<TE>   "People are going to look at my good looks, my youth, and say you're
the guy we're going to vote for," Riordan quipped as he emerged from his
Brentwood home shortly after 7 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   "Good morning, governor!" one wishful thinker shouted.</TE>
<TE>   Heading off with a huge entourage to his neighborhood polling place,
Riordan told reporters: "I'm going to decide when I get in the booth who
I'm going to vote for."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan emerged a few minutes later and announced his choice.</TE>
<TE>   "Reluctantly, myself," he said with a smile.</TE>
<TE>   With a series of similar one-liners, Riordan attempted to set the tone
for the last day in a race in which his once clear front-runner status
eroded.</TE>
<TE>   Conservatively dressed in a dark blue suit and red tie, Riordan
repeatedly urged people to vote.</TE>
<TE>   "Get out there and vote--your country depends on you," he said,
pointing into the lenses of television news cameras, a few seconds after
casting his ballot. 'Oh," he added, following a well-timed pause, "and
vote for Dick Riordan."</TE>
<TE>   After voting in Brentwood, Riordan and his wife, Nancy Daly Riordan,
went to downtown Los Angeles, where they greeted several dozen supporters
at a pep rally in his Original Pantry restaurant. Supporters cheered on
the sidewalk and waved Riordan-for-Governor signs.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the restaurant, Riordan walked from table to table, greeting
patrons eating pancakes, bacon and eggs.</TE>
<TE>   He also shook hands with cooks, dishwashers and waiters before sitting
down for breakfast with his wife and about a dozen campaign staffers and
volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan thanked the volunteers for working on what he called "a tough
campaign." While he avoided criticizing Simon and the other Republican
opponent, Secretary of State Bill Jones, Riordan sharply criticized Gov.
Gray Davis. The former mayor bitterly described Davis' attack ads against
him as evil.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan said he was buoyed by some recent polls showing Davis' support
had declined.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody would have guessed that for the first time in history . . .
[Davis] would come out against someone from the other party in the
primary," Riordan said. "It's evil politics.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope Gray Davis is not around for four more years. The state needs
someone with character and good leadership."</TE>
<TE>   Later, Riordan went to a Burbank phone bank, where he called voters as
he was surrounded by photographers.</TE>
<TE>   "Hi, this is Dick Riordan, I'm running for governor," he told a
potential voter. "I'd like to ask for your vote. . . . Oh, that's great.
OK, if I win by one vote, I'll be over at your house tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether he should have done anything differently in this race,
Riordan said, "I'm the one responsible. There's probably 1,000 things we
could have done differently."</TE>
<TE>   He tried to keep up the spirits of his supporters. "You're just here
because you love this state and you love me," he said. "From the bottom
of my heart, thank you."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan spent the afternoon relaxing at his home with his wife, City
Atty. Rocky Delgadillo and a former City Hall aide.</TE>
<TE>   At sunset, Riordan and his entourage headed to his campaign
headquarters at the Westin to wait out the rest of the evening. He later
emerged from his 12th-floor suite and headed downstairs to make the
speech that seemed unthinkable only a few weeks earlier.</TE>

<HD>Effort to Loosen Term Limits Trails</HD>
<DH>Other ballot proposals lead in early returns, including earmarking
gas tax for road projects.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO
</DL>
<LD>Early election returns found voters inclined to bolster parks,
crack down on insurance fraud and dedicate gas sales taxes to
transportation, but a proposal to relax term limits for state lawmakers
was trailing.</LD>
<LD>   Another measure, to ensure that all votes are counted, was leading
easily, while a bond measure to replace voting equipment was narrowly
leading.</LD>
<LD>   Of the six measures on the ballot, Proposition 45, which would allow
legislators to seek four more years in office, garnered the most
attention. With about a third of the ballots counted, it was trailing
badly.</LD>
<TE>   The contest pitted Senate Leader John Burton (D-San Francisco) and
many of his fellow Democrats against some Republicans and other
term-limit backers. The Legislature is controlled by Democrats, with
Burton in charge of the Senate and Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City)
holding the reins in the Assembly. Without Proposition 45, each man would
be forced to leave office in 2004, though Wesson could seek a Senate
seat.</TE>
<TE>   "By rejecting the attempt by career politicians to kill term limits,
Californians have sent a message to career politicians across the
country: Mess with term limits, and we'll mess with you," said Dan
Schnur, manager of the No-on-45 campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an uphill battle to begin with," countered Bob Mulholland,
campaign advisor for the California Democratic Party. "Once $1 million in
anonymous money came in from the Midwest for the 'no' side, it made it
harder for us to win."</TE>
<TE>   The measure would allow lawmakers to run for an additional four-year
term in the Senate and two more two-year terms in the Assembly by
securing signatures of 20% of the voters who cast ballots in their
districts in the prior election. Currently, senators are termed out after
two four-year terms and Assembly members must move on after three
two-year terms.</TE>
<TE>   Voters were also deciding Tuesday whether the state gasoline sales tax
should be earmarked for transportation projects. The measure was leading
in early returns. Under current law, proceeds from the tax will be used
to relieve urban gridlock from July through June 2008, but would return
to the general fund afterward.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 42 would extend use of the tax for transportation projects
beyond July 2008, and would make it more difficult for lawmakers to
tinker with the existing plan.</TE>
<TE>   "It's off to a promising start," said Nick DeLuca, a spokesman for the
Yes-on-42 campaign. "Nobody needs to be sold on the fact that we have a
terrible transportation mess in the state."</TE>
<TE>   Proponents contend the measure is necessary to begin addressing
California's multibillion-dollar transit and road-construction backlog.
Two of the state's most powerful unions, however, dumped $3 million into
a last-minute television advertising blitz to defeat Proposition 42.</TE>
<TE>   The California Teachers Assn. and the Service Employees International
Union contend the measure would divert money from other state services,
including education and health care.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's ballot measures also tested voters' willingness to dig into
their pockets to bolster parks and purchase new voting equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 41 would raise $200 million through bond sales to help
purchase new voting equipment. Supporters contend the measure is a
crucial step to help cash-strapped counties replace punch-card voting
systems. The measure was leading narrowly in early returns.</TE>
<TE>   A federal judge recently ruled that California must replace its
punch-card voting machines by the 2004 presidential election.</TE>
<TE>   Another bond measure, Proposition 40, would raise $2.6 billion to
improve and purchase property for state and local parks; conserve land,
air and water; and preserve historic and cultural resources. The measure,
which was also leading in early returns, is supported by environmental
groups.</TE>
<TE>   Both Propositions 40 and 41 are opposed by Lew Uhler, president of the
conservative National Tax Limitation Committee.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, the 'yes' sides had all kinds of virtually unlimited
funds to campaign," Uhler said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the bond measures, another ballot proposal to rise from
Florida's "hanging chad" debacle is Proposition 43, which would amend the
state Constitution to say that all votes legally cast in an election
shall be counted. The measure would also allow county election officials
to petition the courts for an extension of any deadlines so votes can be
tallied or recounted.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents warn the measure will invite needless postelection
litigation. Early returns showed the measure leading, and the same for
Proposition 44.</TE>
<TE>   That measure asked voters to decide whether the state's 15,000
licensed chiropractors should be subject to the same penalties as
doctors, including the possibility of having their licenses revoked for
10 years for second or multiple offenses.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents contend the measure would help prevent insurance fraud.
Opponents say it goes too far by revoking chiropractors licenses.</TE>

<HD>A Mixed Vote for Familiar Faces Seeking Old Jobs</HD>
<DH>Former insurance chief John Garamendi is ahead, while March Fong Eu
trails in effort to regain secretary of state post.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIGUEL BUSTILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO
</DL>
<LD>California voters cast ballots Tuesday on an array of statewide
primary races, including Democrat March Fong Eu's campaign to recapture
the secretary of state job she held for two decades.</LD>
<LD>   Eu, the first Chinese American elected to statewide office in
California, was trailing in a tight race with San Francisco Assemblyman
Kevin Shelley, who enjoyed strong party support. Napa Valley winery owner
Michela Alioto, who came within a whisker of beating Republican incumbent
Bill Jones four years ago, was running third. Jones, who had to vacate
the office because of term limits, was a GOP candidate for governor.</LD>
<LD>   Voters also selected party nominees in six other statewide
contests--three of them open. In the race for insurance commissioner,
three well-known Democrats--Montebello Assemblyman Tom Calderon, former
Orange County Assemblyman Tom Umberg and former Insurance Commissioner
John Garamendi--sought their party's nomination to succeed Republican
Chuck Quackenbush, who resigned almost two years ago in a wide-ranging
scandal.</LD>
<TE>   Political experts predict the regulator's job will go to a Democrat in
the November general election, in part because lingering fallout from the
Quackenbush affair is expected to taint GOP candidates. Financial
contributions from insurers became a major issue in the campaign. Only
Calderon took the companies' money--more than $1.5 million.</TE>

<TE>   Garamendi took a strong early lead, trailed by Umberg and Calderon. On
the Republican side, attorney Gary Mendoza appeared to be in a close
contest against Stefan "Watchdog" Stitch, a man who legally changed his
name to promote himself as a consumer advocate.</TE>
<TE>   "In this job, the public cannot accept another Quackenbush, who is put
into office by the insurance industry and then turns his back on
consumers," Garamendi said.</TE>
<TE>   Prominent Republicans and Democrats waged expensive primary fights for
the state controller job being vacated by Democrat Kathleen Connell. On
the Republican side, early returns showed state Sen. Tom McClintock
(R-Thousand Oaks) with a narrow lead over Board of Equalization member
Dean Andal in a battle of anti-tax fighters. On the Democratic side,
former EBay executive Steve Westly held an early lead against Board of
Equalization member Johan Klehs.</TE>
<TE>   The fight to succeed Delaine Eastin as superintendent of public
instruction, a nonpartisan office, featured three candidates expected to
be headed for a runoff. State Sen. Jack O'Connell (D-San Luis Obispo) and
Assemblywoman Lynne Leach (R-Walnut Creek) received their party's backing
in the race, and O'Connell took an early lead, but Anaheim Union High
School District President Katherine Smith was commanding a significant
portion of the vote.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a head start," O'Connell said Tuesday night from the
Democrats' election party at the Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles. "If the
trend continues, we will finish first, and finish first in November."</TE>
<TE>   With the Legislature's recent redistricting, many Republican and
Democrat incumbents are safely ensconced in state Senate and Assembly
seats. As a result, many candidates waged a series of tough primary
fights.</TE>
<TE>   That included a particularly bitter San Fernando Valley campaign to
replace former Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg, which pitted Democrats
Andrei Cherny and Lloyd Levine against one another. Early returns showed
the race in a dead heat.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the most significant statewide offices featured only minimal
competition because they are held by well-known Democratic incumbents
with considerable campaign treasuries.</TE>
<TE>Some Candidates Run Unopposed</TE>
<TE>   Democratic Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer faced only a token primary
challenge from Emeryville attorney Michael Schmeier, while on the
Republican side, state Sen. Dick Ackerman (R-Irvine) was running
unopposed for the GOP nomination. Despite his relatively safe position,
Lockyer continued to raise large sums, fueling speculation that he is
preparing a run for governor in 2006.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Treasurer Phil Angelides--who holds more than $4 million in
campaign cash and also is a presumptive candidate for governor in
2006--was running unopposed in the Democratic primary.</TE>
<TE>   In the Republican primary, early returns showed former Public
Utilities Commission President P. Gregory Conlon with a slight lead over
former deputy Treasurer Mary Toman in the race to face Angelides in
November.</TE>
<TE>   In the race for lieutenant governor, incumbent Democratic Cruz
Bustamante ran unopposed in the primary. State Sen. Bruce McPherson
(R-Santa Cruz) held a commanding lead over Thousand Oaks songwriter Ellie
Michaels for the GOP nomination.</TE>
<TE>   In San Francisco, in one of the city's most watched races for public
defender--Jeff Adachi, the 42-year-old former chief attorney in that
office, appeared to have defeated Kimiko Burton, the 37-year-old daughter
of California state Senate President John Burton. Burton was appointed
public defender last year when her predecessor left before his term was
up.</TE>

<HD>Condit Loses Reelection Bid to Former Protege</HD>
<DH>House: Dennis Cardoza beats scandal-plagued incumbent. In southeast
L.A. County, Linda Sanchez leads in the Democratic primary for the
state's added seat.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Rep. Gary Condit on Tuesday resoundingly lost his uphill bid to
hold onto his Central Valley congressional seat, his successful political
career ended by his relationship with missing intern Chandra Levy.</LD>
<LD>   Condit's defeat, at the hands of a onetime friend and protege,
Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza, marked the end of a 30-year political career.
Cardoza was one of several Democrats who challenged Condit for a seat
that, until Levy disappeared last spring, was considered a sure bet for
the incumbent. Instead, Condit became one of the few entrenched
incumbents to lose a primary contest.</LD>
<LD>   Although police have said they do not consider him a suspect in the
case, questions about the married congressman's relationship with the
24-year-old intern derailed his career and brought the unwelcome glare of
the national spotlight to his conservative agricultural district. For
most of Tuesday, Condit avoided reporters and reportedly stayed at home
to await word of his fate.</LD>
<TE>   "Today the people of the Central Valley stood up for their values, the
values that are central to their lives," Cardoza said in a victory speech
shortly after 10:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   About the same time, Condit emerged from his house in Ceres, dressed
in a purple fleece sweatshirt and blue jeans. The congressman avoided
conceding, but thanked the voters of the 18th District and the people who
worked on his reelection bid.</TE>
<TE>   "I appreciate their support, their love," he said. "I will never
forget that."</TE>
<TE>   About 15 minutes after his statement, the sprinklers went on, dousing
a gaggle of television reporters and cameramen staked out in front of his
house.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in the working-class suburbs of southeast Los Angeles
County, three top contenders in a crowded Democratic primary vied to
represent the 39th Congressional District. The seat was added after the
2000 Census and was fashioned for a Latino to reflect California's
changing demographics. It is one of just two open congressional slots in
the state.</TE>
<TE>   With more than two-thirds of the vote counted, lawyer and labor union
official Linda Sanchez, sister of Rep. Loretta Sanchez (D-Garden Grove),
was leading South Gate Councilman Hector de la Torre and Assemblywoman
Sally Havice of Cerritos.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, it looks good at this point," Linda Sanchez said. "It's
like a dream come true. It's hard to grasp right now."</TE>
<TE>   Although he was running behind Sanchez, De la Torre said he was
pleased with the campaign he ran.</TE>
<TE>   "We ran a clean campaign focused on my experience, my roots in the
community and ability to do the job," De la Torre said Tuesday night.</TE>
<TE>   These two races were among the few real contests for the House of
Representatives on Tuesday's state ballot. In that sense, the primary
offered a preview of the November election, when nearly all 51 incumbents
seeking reelection are expected to cruise to victory thanks to a
redistricting plan that preserved the status quo in California's
congressional delegation.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, Democrats hold 32 congressional seats, while Republicans
claim 20.</TE>
<TE>   Condit kept a low profile on the day of his reckoning, ducking the
media as he toured his district in a last-ditch effort to win support.
Dogged by his relationship with Levy, he faced the toughest battle of his
three decades in politics. A conservative Democrat who long espoused
family values, the seven-term congressman had seemed assured of yet
another easy reelection victory a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   But things changed when Modesto native Levy vanished from Washington,
D.C., in May, just as she was about to return to USC to accept her
master's degree. Relatives of Levy, who had completed a federal
internship as part of her studies, said she had had an affair with the
53-year-old Condit, who has two grown children.</TE>
<TE>   Condit has repeatedly refused to discuss details of his relationship
with Levy except to acknowledge that they were close. For several months,
until Sept. 11, he was the subject of intensive media coverage and became
grist of late-night television talk and comedy shows.</TE>
<TE>   As Condit's once-loyal constituents showed signs of anger with him,
party leaders abandoned the congressman, who had once been a trusted
confidant to Gov. Gray Davis. State legislators even redrew his district
to make it harder for him to win the Democratic nomination. Republicans
indicated that they would probably target the strongly Democratic
district if Condit survived the primary. Four Republicans, including
state Sen. Dick Monteith of Modesto, filed for the race in a district
where Democrats have a 52% to 35% registration edge.</TE>
<TE>   Cardoza outdistanced Condit and the other Democratic candidates in
fund-raising, endorsements and public opinion polls. But Condit fought
back, stumping with his family through the district and using his own
money to help finance his campaign. Cardoza will face Monteith in
November.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, residents in Modesto waited for the election results that
many hoped would take the Central Valley town out of the national
spotlight.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's a liar, and he abused his power," said Terri Richey, 40,
as she shopped at a florist's a few doors down from Condit's office. She
said she voted for one of his challengers.</TE>
<TE>   But others were supportive.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, you know, he's done a lot for this area," said Shannon
Gonzalez, 29, a Republican. "I tend to be one of those people who likes
to judge people on what they've done and try to keep their personal life
out of it."</TE>
<TE>Race Turned Nasty at Times</TE>
<TE>   Another hard-fought battle occurred in the 39th District of southeast
Los Angeles County. Among the three main contenders in the six-way
Democratic primary, Sanchez traded on her sister's famed fund-raising
skills to win the money race. The race in the U-shaped district turned
nasty at times. Havice and De la Torre, along with other candidates,
demanded, unsuccessfully, that Sanchez pull her negative cable television
ads. Last weekend, the Sanchez campaign delivered a mailer blasting De la
Torre.</TE>
<TE>   Latino leaders split on endorsements but largely stayed out of the
fray. De la Torre picked up the endorsement of retiring Rep. Steve Horn
(R-Long Beach), whose 38th District was obliterated in last year's effort
to create the new 39th District.</TE>
<TE>   To make up for the loss of Horn's seat, a new district with a GOP
majority, the 21st, was drawn to encompass Tulare County and parts of
Fresno County, including the farming communities of Clovis and Reedley.
There, Assemblyman Mike Briggs, former Fresno Mayor Jim Patterson and
dairy farmer Devin Nunes were among seven vying for the GOP nomination.</TE>
<TE>   Few of California's incumbents are seriously threatened in the
November election because of the incumbent-protection plan the
Legislature passed as part of the once-a-decade redrawing of district
lines.</TE>
<TE>   The new maps were drawn by Democrats, who dominate the Legislature.
They ensured that their party would win California's one added seat,
bringing Democrats' numbers in the congressional delegation to 33.
Republicans, reassured that they would maintain their current number of
seats, went along with the plan.</TE>
<TE>   Most of those seeking to oust incumbents of their own party Tuesday
were succumbing to the long odds against unseating an entrenched
office-holder. Investment broker Kevin Feldman of West Hollywood, for
example, trailed far behind Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) in the
redrawn 30th District, which stretches from Los Angeles' Westside into
the west San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   In the redrawn 37th District, which encompasses almost 80% of Long
Beach, Rep. Juanita Millender-McDonald (D-Carson) was turning back a bid
by government professor Peter Mathews, who has sought an area
congressional seat several times before.</TE>
<TE>   In last year's redistricting, Long Beach's port and affluent coastal
neighborhoods were put into the 46th District of Rep. Dana Rohrabacher
(R-Huntington Beach), who was unopposed Tuesday for his party's
nomination and is heavily favored to win in November, leaving the state's
fifth largest city without one of its own in Congress in nearly a decade.</TE>

<HD>All School Bond Measures Poised to Pass</HD>
<DH>Education: The new, lower threshold for approval appears likely to
net seven districts more than $730 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A flurry of bond proposals that would pump more than $730 million
of construction funds into six Orange County school districts and the
North Orange County Community College District were all edging toward
approval Tuesday, thanks to a new state law lowering the threshold of
votes needed for passage.</LD>
<LD>   Previously, districts needed to get a two-thirds majority for approval
of bond measures. That changed in 2000, after voters statewide passed
Proposition 39. Now districts need just 55% of the vote to pass a bond.
The change has spawned a spate of bond elections statewide.</LD>
<LD>   "In the past, it was the tyranny of the minority," said Dennis Smith,
superintendent of the Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District. "It
took two yes votes for every no vote and became so onerous that people
stopped trying."</LD>
<TE>   "We're going to see improved public schools as a result of this," he
said of Proposition 39.</TE>
<TE>   Late Tuesday, his district appeared headed toward approval of $102
million in bonds that will pay for two new elementary schools, a middle
school, a high school and improvements at most of its 31 campuses.</TE>
<TE>   When Anaheim City School District officials went to voters with a
$48-million bond measure in 1998, they lost, despite winning 56% of the
vote. Tuesday, however, a $111-million bond measure was poised to pass.
District officials say they plan to build five new schools and make
improvements to most of the 23 campuses. The district is one of the most
overcrowded in the state.</TE>
<TE>   District spokeswoman Suzi Brown said the change in the percentage of
votes needed has made bond measures "a hurdle that most districts can now
make it over."</TE>
<TE>   She said voters are also more willing to approve bond measures because
the new state law puts caps on how much districts can ask for and
requires a local bond oversight committees made up of community members.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere in the county, the Anaheim Union High School District was
heading toward passage of a $132-million bond to build a new junior high
school and for modernization projects, and Fullerton Joint Union High
School District was looking to receive $67.9 million in bonds for new
buildings at each of its six campuses and improvements at existing ones.</TE>
<TE>   The Fullerton School District was apparently headed to victory in its
efforts to pass a $49.7-million measure for a new elementary school and
facilities upgrades.</TE>
<TE>   The Huntington Beach City School District, which wants to make
improvements at its 10 campuses, was looking likely to pass a $30-million
bond measure.</TE>
<TE>   And finally, the community college district, with campuses in
Fullerton and Cypress, has a $239-million bond measure for various
construction projects, including new libraries and improved parking.</TE>
<TE>   The bonds are paid with increased property taxes in the districts and
range from $18.41 per $100,000 of assessed value in the college district
to $32.20 per $100,000 in Placentia-Yorba Linda.</TE>
<TE>   The measures that pass will qualify for matching funds from a
statewide bond measure likely to go to voters in November. If the state
fails to pass its bond or if the money runs out, districts will have to
scale back or delay their projects.</TE>

<HD>Voters in O.C. Could Thwart Airport Plans</HD>
<DH>Races: Measure W, which would zone the base for a park, leads in
early returns. Pro-airport Supervisor Cynthia P. Coad was trailing a
Fullerton councilman.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT MARTELLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After years of acrimonious debate and three prior ballot showdowns,
Orange County voters Tuesday appeared to block plans for an international
airport at the former El Toro Marine base by rezoning it as parkland,
according to early election returns.</LD>
<LD>   In a further display of anti-airport sentiment, Board of Supervisors
Chairwoman Cynthia P. Coad was trailing in her reelection campaign, which
threatened to reverse the panel's long-standing pro-airport majority.</LD>
<LD>   The early Measure W results elated anti-airport activists as
pro-airport forces began discussing possible next steps--including a
legal challenge and yet another initiative to undo Measure W.</LD>
<TE>   Barring those efforts, passage of the ballot measure would make it
exceedingly difficult for pro-airport forces to realize their vision of
an international hub in the heart of Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be very hard for it to proceed," said Jack Pitney, a
Republican analyst and professor of government at Claremont McKenna
College. "In politics, you never say never, but sooner or later political
reality can block any project. . . . My sense is that one should not
place a lot of money on the El Toro airport being built."</TE>
<TE>   Measure W supporters who packed a Laguna Hills Holiday Inn ballroom
Tuesday night reacted jubilantly as absentee returns came in. "This will
kill the airport, and hopefully we can get onto other issues that are
important to Orange County," said L. Allan Songstad Jr., a Laguna Hills
councilman.</TE>
<TE>   At Newport Beach's Villa Nova restaurant, airport supporters waited
for election results with foreboding. Bruce Nestande, a former county
supervisor and director of the pro-airport Citizens for Jobs and the
Economy, fretted about the money the other side had spent.</TE>
<TE>   "The ability to get your message out increases your chance of
winning," Nestande said.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County's turnout was light, about 22.5% by early evening, but
in keeping with past off-year primaries despite the high-profile
statewide Republican gubernatorial primary.</TE>
<TE>   The key issue of the day was what to do with the 4,700-acre Marine
base, the fourth time the issue has gone before voters.</TE>
<TE>   "I voted yes to kill the airport idea once and for all," said Jim
King, 34, of Seal Beach, who supported Measure W even though he doubts El
Toro is suitable for a park. "I think there is a lot of toxic waste there
and an airport is one of the only things that land can be used for. But
that's not a good enough reason to build an LAX here in O.C."</TE>
<TE>   Measure W would undo the initial 1994 measure that zoned the area for
a commercial airport. The debate has largely pitted south against north,
with South County residents opposing plans for a commercial airport on
the base built during World War II between what is now Irvine, Tustin and
Lake Forest.</TE>
<TE>   A total of nearly $100 million, most of it public money, has been
spent on advertising and lobbying by both sides over the years, making El
Toro one of the nation's most expensive land-use battles.</TE>
<TE>   More battles are likely. The Airport Working Group of Orange County,
based in Newport Beach, has threatened to challenge Measure W as it seeks
an airport to relieve pressure for expansion of John Wayne Airport, whose
flight paths carry jets over Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   The tenor of the debate changed last year with the departure of
Newport Beach billionaire George Argyros, whom President Bush appointed
ambassador to Spain. That bled the pro-airport group of energy and money,
as the anti-airport coalition raised nearly $2.5 million to mount a
campaign touting the "Great Park" alternative.</TE>
<TE>   The five-member Board of Supervisors, which favors an airport by a 3-2
majority, will determine how the base is to be redeveloped. But Measure
W's approval would bar the supervisors from building an airport.</TE>
<TE>   The board's pro-airport majority hung in the balance Tuesday, with 4th
District Supervisor Cynthia P. Coad trailing Fullerton Councilman Chris
Norby. Norby opposes the airport; Coad favors it.</TE>

<LD>   Judge Ronald C. Kline, who spent election night under house arrest in
Irvine with an electronic monitoring bracelet strapped to his ankle,
needed a majority of votes to win outright reelection to another six-year
term.</LD>
<LD>   But returns showed the 11 write-in candidates who jumped into the race
shortly after his arrest could nab enough votes to prevent that.</LD>
<TE>   If Kline falls short of 50%, one of those write-ins will face him in
the November election. The victor will not be known until county
elections officials hand-count thousands of write-in ballots, an arduous
process expected to begin Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Kline was the only candidate listed on the ballot, an edge expected to
land him enough votes to qualify for a runoff.</TE>
<TE>   Among his challengers were a former Los Angeles County sheriff's
deputy, a Costa Mesa City Council member and several lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   All knew they were longshots, even after a Superior Court judge Friday
ordered elections officials to post signs at polling places telling
voters they could receive a list of the write-in candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the tendency of voters to reelect incumbents and not pay
attention to low-profile "down ballot" races, the only real hope for
Kline's opponents was to force a runoff election.</TE>
<TE>   "There's not a little picture of a child molester on the ballot. All
people see on the ballot is 'Kline, incumbent.' Usually, that's enough,"
said Mark Petracca, chairman of the political science department at UC
Irvine. "The reality is we're asking voters to do something they
virtually never do."</TE>
<TE>   Still, many voters said they were well aware of the allegations
against Kline. Some said they didn't vote for anyone in that race because
they knew so little about Kline's challengers.</TE>
<TE>   "If the information I have read is true, I do not think he should have
a judgeship," said Jane Atencio, 60, a Newport Beach Republican. "I'll
skip it. I'm not informed otherwise."</TE>
<TE>   Others picked among the write-ins, preferring an unknown over a man
accused of possessing child pornography.</TE>
<TE>   "I was more voting against Kline," said Jason Burk, 24, of Fullerton,
who wrote in candidate John Adams, a Dana Point attorney.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm surprised they weren't able to remove him from the ballot. I
didn't really have a lot of time to find out about the write-in
candidates. But I didn't want to vote for Kline."</TE>
<TE>   Peter Trejo, 34, of Fullerton learned about the charges against Kline
only after he voted.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm disappointed," Trejo said. "I'm surprised his name was still on
the ballot. You would think with something like this there would be a lot
more publicity."</TE>
<TE>   Until last fall, Kline enjoyed an impeccable reputation and was
expected to win reelection easily. That changed Nov. 9, two days after
the filing deadline for judicial candidates, when he surrendered to
federal authorities after being charged with downloading photographs of
children in sex acts.</TE>
<TE>   After hearing of Kline's arrest, a former neighbor accused Kline of
sexually abusing him four times between 1976 and 1978. The Orange County
district attorney's office filed molestation charges against the judge in
January.</TE>
<TE>   Paul S. Meyer, Kline's attorney, would not comment Tuesday on the
charges or on Kline's activities on election day. The federal child
pornography case is set for trial in June. No trial date has been set in
the sexual abuse case.</TE>
<TE>   "This case is being defended in the court system, where it was
brought, not in the press," Meyer said.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Tina Borgatta, Evan Halper, Christine Hanley and
Jack Leonard contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Greuel Leads Cardenas in Council Race</HD>
<DH>Vote: Early returns show the film executive has edge over state
legislator for the bitterly contested 2nd District seat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Capping a costly and bitter contest, voters went to the polls
Tuesday to choose between film industry executive Wendy Greuel and state
lawmaker Tony Cardenas for the San Fernando Valley's 2nd District seat on
the Los Angeles City Council.</LD>
<LD>   Greuel led Cardenas in early returns.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles city voters also were deciding Proposition Q, a
$600-million bond measure for police and fire facilities, while county
voters were deciding on competing proposals to relax term limits.</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca and county Supervisor Gloria
Molina faced light opposition and jumped out to big leads in early
returns. Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky was unopposed.</TE>
<TE>   The fiercest local contest was the race to fill the Los Angeles City
Council seat vacated by Joel Wachs last year. The two candidates spent a
combined $1.7 million on the race.</TE>
<TE>   In mailings and television ads, Greuel, an executive with the
entertainment firm DreamWorks SKG, characterized her opponent as a
Sacramento politician who moved into the district to run with the backing
of interests such as Indian gaming groups.</TE>
<TE>   Cardenas, who is being forced by term limits to leave the Assembly,
sent mailers depicting Greuel as a tool of downtown special interests,
including the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   "I think my chances are very good," Cardenas said after the first
returns came in. "People want to vote for a candidate who speaks to the
issues as I did."</TE>
<TE>   He said he got his message out "even though it was clouded by the
heavy innuendo put out there by my opponent."</TE>
<TE>   Greuel was exhausted but encouraged. "I feel good," she said. "I think
people really believe in my commitment to getting the Valley our fair
share."</TE>
<TE>   Greuel, a 40-year-old Van Nuys resident, watched the election returns
come in with supporters at a party at Kaffe Mirage in North Hollywood.
Cardenas, 38, gathered with supporters at La Sirenita restaurant in
Panorama City to wait for returns.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters who attended an election-day rally for Cardenas included
police union President Mitzi Grasso and City Council President Alex
Padilla. Padilla once worked as an aide for Cardenas and campaigned hard
for his former boss, whose election would shore up his support on the
council. Greuel, who was backed by nine council members, was seen as a
potential new member of an anti-Padilla bloc.</TE>
<TE>   Greuel proposed increasing the police force by 1,500 officers, and
expanding the L.A.'s Best after-school program.</TE>
<TE>   Cardenas, who until recently was chairman of the Assembly Budget
Committee, called for an expansion of the police force to 10,000
officers.</TE>
<TE>   The race captured the attention of Hollywood as few local contests
have. DreamWorks founders Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David
Geffen held fund-raisers for Greuel, while Walt Disney Co. executives,
including Chief Executive Michael Eisner, held a fund-raiser for
Cardenas.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition Q, which would provide $600 million for new police and
fire facilities, requires a two-thirds majority vote for passage and was
close to that margin in early returns.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters, including the police and firefighter unions, said the
measure is needed to address cramped and aging conditions at many city
police stations.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Close, chairman of Valley VOTE, headed a group of
secessionists and taxpayer activists in opposing Proposition Q, saying
the city needs more police officers and firefighters, not buildings.</TE>
<TE>   There was less heat over the only other city ballot measure, Charter
Amendment R, which would set the city primary in March in future years
and move the runoff election to June.</TE>
<TE>   In the Los Angeles County election, Molina was the fund-raising leader
over opponent David Sanchez, a community college professor, in the race
for the 1st Supervisory District. Baca was fending off challenges in the
sheriff's race from sergeants Patrick Gomez and John Stites.</TE>
<TE>   Agoura Hills voters were considering a controversial measure that
would ban any retail building larger than 60,000 square feet. Residents
and hardware merchants proposed Measure H in part to stop construction of
a Home Depot on prominent Ladyface Mountain, a city landmark. It was
losing in early returns.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Assessor Rick Auerbach was leading for reelection.</TE>
<TE>   Also on the ballot, and winning in early returns, was county Charter
Amendment A, which would allow county elected officials, including the
supervisors, district attorney and sheriff, to serve three four-year
terms, replacing the current law limiting officials to two four-year
terms.</TE>
<TE>   A second term limits measure, Charter Amendment B, would apply the
three-term limit only to the supervisors. It, too, was winning in early
returns.</TE>
<TE>   The third measure on the county ballot, Charter Amendment C, would
allow the sheriff to reorganize his department. It also had support in
early returns.</TE>
<TE>   Staff writers Beth Shuster, Zanto Peabody, Andrea Perera and Jennifer
Sinco Kelleher contributed to this report.</TE>

<CX>   L.A. County term limits--A story Wednesday in Section A incorrectly
stated that a law had limited Los Angeles County elected officials to two
four-year terms. There is no such law. Charter Amendment A, adopted
Tuesday, limits newly elected and reelected officials to three four-year
terms.</CX>
