<HD>At-home defibrillators: Proceed with caution</HD>
<DH></DH>

<LD>The recent government approval of an at-home defibrillator could
reasonably be expected to save lives. After all, 61 million Americans
have heart disease and most cardiac arrests happen at home.</LD>
<LD>   But the device, which shocks a heart back into normal rhythm,
might do more harm than good, some experts say.</LD>
<LD>   "It hasn't been demonstrated that untrained family members can use
them effectively," said Dr. Vinay Nadkarni, chairman of the emergency
cardiovascular care committee of the American Heart Assn. in Dallas.
And distracted family members may wait too long before calling the
paramedics.</LD>
<TE>   "People may think just having the machine at home is enough," said
Nadkarni, and might not call 911 immediately. Each year, 250,000
people die of sudden cardiac arrest. Unlike a heart attack, which
cuts off blood flow to the muscle, cardiac arrest is triggered by an
erratic heartbeat that stops the heart from pumping. The only thing
that can restore the heart's natural rhythm is a jolt of electricity,
known as defibrillation.</TE>
<TE>   The window for successful resuscitation is 10 to 12 minutes, and
for every minute of delay, chances of survival drop by 10%. Since it
can take six minutes or more for paramedics to respond to 911 calls,
an external defibrillator can provide treatment before they arrive.</TE>
<TE>   There's been a widespread drive to place these life-saving devices
not only in ambulances, firetrucks and police cars, but in airports,
planes, stadiums, health clubs, shopping malls and schools. But 70%
of cardiac arrests occur at home, which is why the devices have been
adapted for home use. The Food and Drug Administration earlier this
month approved the first such device, Philips Electronics' HeartStart
Home Defibrillator, which will be available with a prescription.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty years ago, only physicians used defibrillators, but
advances in technology have made it possible for someone with no
medical expertise to use them. Unlike older devices, which required a
doctor to determine heart rhythm, the new models are programmed to
detect irregularities. "That's the key change that makes it possible
to use them at home," said Dr. L. Bing Liem, an electrophysiologist
at Stanford University School of Medicine in Palo Alto.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, a New England Journal of Medicine study of
defibrillator use at three Chicago airports found that untrained
people can indeed save lives.</TE>
<TE>   HeartStart, which was tested for ease of use by a group of
sixth-graders, walks people through the resuscitation process. Once
users pull back the handle, they are given step-by-step voice
instructions, accompanied by written directions on where to place the
paddles. "If you need extra help, it will pause with you and provide
coaching comments," said David M. Freeman, a vice president with
Philips Electronics in Andover, Mass.</TE>
<TE>   The system does weekly self-checks, and chirps like a smoke
detector if the battery runs down. Users can't zap someone
accidentally--the device is programmed to detect rhythms and will
only jolt hearts that need it.</TE>
<TE>   Although sudden cardiac arrest can strike people at any age, the
most likely victims are men in their 60s, which means the
defibrillator will be most often used by their wives or someone else
living in their home.</TE>
<TE>   But even though the device has been tested on sixth-graders,
Nadkarni said, "sixth-graders are not the spouses of sick patients,
and we don't know how people will act in a true emergency situation."</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, the $2,295 cost for the HeartStart Home Defibrillator
may be prohibitive for retirees on a fixed income, since it's unclear
whether insurers or Medicare will pay for them</TE>
<TE>   The National Institutes of Health is beginning a study to
determine if these at-home devices increase survival rates among
people at high risk of cardiac arrest. But results won't be known for
four years. In the meantime, says Nadkarni, family members who want
the device should get proper training from their local Red Cross.</TE>
<TE>   CVS pharmacy, a major drugstore chain in many parts of the
country, is expected to stock the machines in about six weeks; in
California, they can be ordered via the Internet at www.heart
starthome.com.</TE>

<HD>Fish oil's multiplying benefits</HD>
<DH>It not only helps the heart, brain development and
depression, researchers say, but goes a step further than other 'good
fats.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jane E. Allen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The fish oil story keeps getting better.</LD>
<LD>   British researchers last month reported that eating fish cut the
risk of dementia among a group of elderly people living in France.
Those who ate fish or seafood at least once a week significantly
lowered their risk of being diagnosed with the memory disorder. The
British study was one of a series of reports this year that have
helped bolster the case for increasing our consumption of certain
types of fish. Consider:</LD>
<LD>   Researchers in Scotland and England reported that fish oil
supplements helped alleviate depression in patients who had not
responded well to prescription antidepressants.</LD>
<TE>   A major Italian study published found that fish oil supplements
reduced the chance that heart-attack survivors would suffer sudden
death from a cardiac arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Several infant formula companies have begun adding a particular
type of fat found in fish to their products based on research that
links the fat to enhanced brain development in children.</TE>
<TE>   This research centers on the health benefits of fats found in the
flesh of deep-sea fish such as cod, salmon, shrimp, tuna, mackerel
and herring.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike some of the other so-called good fats found in olive oil or
avocados, these fish fats have anti-inflammatory and other properties
that can potentially improve many aspects of our health.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers say they are truly "heart healthy" because they fight
inflammation, reduce irregular heart rhythms and help maintain
flexibility in blood vessels that stiffen with age. In revised
guidelines being released today, the American Heart Assn. recommends
these fish fats to protect healthy people's hearts.</TE>
<TE>   Scientifically rigorous studies have shown these fats can slow the
progression of heart disease and help prevent the buildup of
artery-clogging plaque leading to a heart attack.</TE>
<TE>   Fish oil fats also can lower levels of two blood fats associated
with heart disease: triglycerides and the very low-density
lipoproteins, called VLDL, a component of LDL or bad cholesterol.</TE>
<TE>   They also thin the blood and make platelets less apt to clump,
reducing the risk of strokes or tiny strokes that can create a type
of dementia.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, the magnitude of these effects isn't strong enough to
substitute fish eating or fish oil pills for proven anti-clotting
therapies, such as aspirin and the prescription drug heparin, said
Dr. Mary Hardy, head of integrative medicine at Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center in Los Angeles. Fish and fish oil contain two Omega-3 fatty
acids: docosahexaenoic acid, or DHA, and eicosapentaenoic acid, or
EPA. They belong to the same family as the alpha-linolenic acid, or
ALA -- found in flaxseed oil, canola oil, soybeans and walnuts --
which the liver converts into DHA and EPA.</TE>
<TE>   However, if you follow the typical American diet, heavy in the
Omega-6 fatty acids found in corn, safflower, sunflower and soybean
oils, it's harder for your liver to break down the ALA into the fats
you can easily get by eating fish.</TE>
<TE>   While scientists are encouraged by many of the fish oil studies,
some doubt remains about how strong the link is between increased
consumption of fish and some diseases.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the British researchers studying fish consumption and
dementia could not tell whether fish had direct effects on the brain.
They know that fish oil can reduce inflammation and plaque in the
arteries, both of which are known Alzheimer's risks.</TE>
<TE>   In the study, published in the British Medical Journal, the
authors cautioned that fish eaters might have less dementia because
they were better educated and took better care of themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Although it's likely that anti-inflammatory properties of fish oil
could account for improvements in conditions such as arthritis, the
results are more mixed for psoriasis, an inflammatory skin disorder.
Scientists continue to study whether fish oil is beneficial for
mental health conditions, including depression, schizo- phrenia and
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and some lung conditions
including cystic fibrosis.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors and nutritionists recommend making fish a regular part of
your diet by eating at least two 3- to 6-ounce servings of fish
weekly. For a meaty fish, such as a salmon steak, the appropriate
serving size is about the size of a deck of cards. For thinner fish,
such as trout, the serving size is about the size of a checkbook,
said Joan Carter, a registered dietitian at Baylor College of
Medicine in Houston. However, because cold-water fish such as tuna
often are contaminated with mercury and other toxins such as PCBs,
pregnant or nursing women and young children are advised to limit
their fish eating, and questions have begun being raised about risks
to healthy people.</TE>
<TE>   Simply heating up a package of frozen fish sticks or reaching for
a jar of picked herring is not a good option. The partially
hydrogenated fats often used in fried foods can boost your heart
disease risk, and salty pickled fish boosts your intake of sodium.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, stick to grilled, broiled, baked, sauteed or poached
fish. And don't rule out canned salmon, which is wild salmon that
contains more Omega-3s than the farm-raised salmon often found in
your supermarket.</TE>
<TE>   Vegetarians and people who dislike fish can get Omega-3s from eggs
laid by chickens fed Omega-3-rich diets, which boosts the amount of
the fatty acids in their yolks. You can find these in the egg section
of your supermarket; the labels specify they've been enriched with
Omega-3s. However, a dozen can cost twice as much as conventional
eggs.</TE>
<TE>   The American Heart Assn. recommends that healthy people get an
average of 650 milligrams of combined EPA and DHA each day from their
diet; some experts recommend from 800 to 1,000 milligrams. With fish
oil capsules containing 300 to 500 milligrams of the fatty acids
combined, that translates into two to three capsules a day.</TE>
<TE>   Although the heart association has not formally recommended fish
oil supplements for healthy people, its revised guidelines suggest
that those with high triglycerides or cardiovascular disease may need
more than they can get through diet alone, so they should talk to
their doctors about fish oil supplements.</TE>
<TE>   But they should be cautious. Anyone taking blood thinners, such as
Coumadin, should avoid fish oils because of bleeding risks. Diabetics
should monitor sugar levels because fish oil might interfere with
glucose levels.</TE>
<TE>   By choosing fish rather than fish oil supplements, said Carter,
you avoid some uncertainties, such as the content of certain
products, which the U.S. government does not regulate for safety or
effectiveness. Also, the quality of the supplements may vary.
ConsumerLab.com, an independent product-testing firm, found that six
of 20 fish oil products it sampled had levels of DHA ranging from 50%
to 83% of the amount stated on the label; two of those six contained
less than stated amounts of EPA. Also, some people who take fish
capsules complain of a lingering fishy taste and indigestion, or
diarrhea.</TE>

<HD>Years of research bring hope with a melanoma vaccine</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Shari Roan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No one can question Dr. Donald Morton's tenacity. For 42 years, the
medical director of the John Wayne Cancer Institute in Santa Monica
has been working on a vaccine to prevent a relapse of malignant
melanoma, the most deadly form of skin cancer.</LD>
<LD>   He began developing his vaccine, Canvaxin, in the early 1960s.
Then working at the National Cancer Institute, he saw a patient whose
cancer "just went away," even though it had spread to her liver and
lungs. Such remissions, which tend to occur after the patient
develops a bacterial infection, happen in about 1 in 2,000 to 5,000
patients with melanoma that has spread.</LD>
<LD>   "We think the reason this happens is the immune system has been
activated" by something like an unrelated infection, he said. "I
said, if it happens spontaneously, maybe we can make it happen at
will."</LD>
<TE>   Based on his most recent study,  Morton says his vaccine may cure
about one-third more people with melanoma that has spread, or
metastasized, than existing therapies.</TE>
<TE>   Advanced melanoma is usually treated with surgery to remove the
tumor, followed by chemotherapy to kill cancer cells that may have
escaped to distant parts of the body. But chemotherapy is toxic and,
in such cases, often unsuccessful; the vaccine is intended as a
replacement.</TE>
<TE>   With the largest collection of melanoma cancer cell lines in the
world, Morton was able to identify three lines rich with specific
antigens, substances that produce a strong immune response. The cells
were treated with radiation so that, although still alive, they could
not divide and cause more cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Because the vaccine has so many target antigens, it is considered
a "generic" vaccine that could be given to any melanoma patient,
regardless of the person's particular type of tumor. Other
researchers around the world also are working on "therapeutic
melanoma vaccines," Morton said.</TE>
<TE>   Traditional vaccines prevent a disease by rallying the immune
system to recognize an invader and attack it. The same concept,
however, can be applied to prevent recurrence of a disease. The
handful of melanoma vaccines in development operate on this premise,
although they are in various stages of progress and differ in how
they're made. Some of them target an individual's unique tissue type.</TE>
<TE>   In a paper published last month, 49% of 935 patients who received
the Canvaxin vaccine were alive after five years compared with 37% of
1,667 patients who received standard chemotherapy. Side effects
include small sores on the skin (a reaction to the vaccine) that take
about a month or two to heal and temporary flu-like symptoms.</TE>
<TE>   Canvaxin, which is manufactured by CancerVax Corp. in Carlsbad,
Calif., is administered five times in the first two months after
surgery, monthly for 10 months and then sporadically for up to five
years.</TE>
<TE>   The success of the most recent study, published in the October
issue of the Annals of Surgery, prompted the National Cancer
Institute to issue a $29-million grant for a phase-three, randomized,
controlled trial at 55 centers around the world. Results from this
trial of 1,200 patients are expected in about three years.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the Food and Drug Administration's concerns is that,
because of John Wayne Cancer Institute's expertise in treating
melanoma, our results won't be duplicated at less specialized
centers," Morton said.</TE>
<TE>   Morton said he's confident the vaccine's success can be replicated
because of his experience -- not in spite of it. "In terms of
tenacity, 42 years is probably a record."</TE>

<TE>   Facts about melanoma</TE>
<TE>   Melanoma is the most serious form of skin cancer, affecting about
51,000 people in the United States each year.</TE>
<TE>   Rates of the disease have increased about 3% a year since 1981.</TE>
<TE>   Risk factors include exposure to ultraviolet light (including a
single, severe sunburn); exposure to coal tar, arsenic compounds or
radium; family history; and having multiple moles.</TE>
<TE>   Rates are 10 times higher in whites than in blacks.</TE>
<TE>   About 7,800 people die each year of melanoma.</TE>
<TE>   Signs of melanoma include any change on the skin, especially in
the size and color of a mole or a darkly pigmented spot.</TE>

<HD>The belly dances, the muscles follow</HD>
<DH>A fertility ritual, a childbearing aid or simply a form of
entertainment? For a woman who's seven months pregnant, it's
low-impact exercise.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hilary E. MacGregor</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Out of the darkness, we entered the patio through a tiny bamboo
grove. Shards of light filtered through the intricate carvings of an
Oriental screen. Women of all ages, we had come to a private dance
studio on an anonymous suburban street on the Westside to learn the
art of the belly dance.</LD>
<LD>   I had belly danced before. Now I was nearly seven months pregnant.
I was here because I'd once been told that belly dancing originated
in rituals of childbearing, and helped strengthen muscles needed in
labor. I didn't know if it was true, but my low-impact exercise
options were narrowing and my body growing more unwieldy by the day.
My doctor had mentioned dance as a fitness option during pregnancy,
so I sought something a little more exotic. The studio had mirrors on
three walls, and artifacts placed around the room: rolled-up Persian
carpets, a giant brass urn, a Moroccan lamp. Lights were dimmed to
smoky hues, evocative of a Cairo casbah. We stood in a V, in this
room perfectly sized to fit 10 dancers. Middle Eastern dance maven
Aisha Ali, her long mane of hair cascading down her back, stood
before us.</LD>
<TE>   On this night, Ali wore simple black leggings, and a cropped black
top with sheer material around her waist so we could watch her belly.
A silver medallion hung from her neck, silver earrings dangled from
her ears, and gold bangles clinked on her wrists. Her hip scarf was
embroidered with hundreds of coins that jingled when she moved and
caught the light, shimmering. For the next hour and a half we would
follow her as if in a trance -- jiggling, shimmying and undulating.</TE>
<TE>   The music began, a transporting mix of folk oboes, drums, cymbals
and exotic rhythms. For five minutes we warmed up with stretches and
bends you might do before a gym workout, except we fluttered our
hands and moved to the beat.</TE>
<TE>   Then we began to isolate our muscle groups. And this was where
things got difficult: How do you make that specific part of your body
do that thing she is doing?</TE>
<TE>   "We are isolating below the waist," Ali said. "Everything is below
the waist. We are not moving our shoulders, our arms or breathing
heavily."</TE>
<TE>   We did figure eights with our hips. We did vertical figure eights,
flowing up and down from one foot to the other. We constantly wiggled
our knees to keep our hip scarves jingling and our bodies jiggling.
To a beat, during a 90-minute class, it's a real workout.</TE>
<TE>   Ali's face looked impassive, like a mannequin's, or else broke
into a calm smile. We grimaced with concentration and effort. Some of
us moved like spasmodic marionettes.</TE>
<TE>   We worked on isolating our chests, then our bellies.</TE>
<TE>   Ali could control every inch of her belly with astounding
accuracy. The effect was mesmerizing.</TE>
<TE>   She had us puff out our stomachs like beach balls, then pull them
in. "You want that shape, that cadaverous shape," she coaxed. She
went around the class and critiqued the forms. (I couldn't pull in at
all.)</TE>
<TE>   I noticed some of the belly and pelvic moves were remarkably
similar to those we used to strengthen our bodies in my prenatal yoga
class. One was even called a kegel.</TE>
<TE>   When I told friends I was taking the class, their reaction was
mixed: Some thought the baby would love the swaying motions. Others
worried that all that shaking and jiggling would be bad for the baby.</TE>
<TE>   For me, dancing among these women was a relief. For 90 minutes I
forgot about my ever-enlarging form, and instead could relax into
feeling graceful and feminine.</TE>
<TE>   I imagined my baby rocking to the rhythm, and coming into the
world dancing.</TE>
<TE>   There is no written record of how belly dance started, but dancers
and anthropologists say it is one of the oldest forms of dance,
dating back thousands of years to pre-biblical times, when it was
part of goddess worship, fertility rites and religious rituals
associated with childbirth.</TE>
<TE>   Ali has taught dance since 1967. She has traced the roots of belly
dance to tiny villages in the Middle East and performed at nightclubs
in Cairo and Luxor. With her own dance troupe, she once performed all
over the world, and trained dancers for decades here in Los Angeles.
She believes that belly dancing was always a form of entertainment
and celebration. While women in villages dance among themselves, she
says, it was the prostitutes and courtesans who performed publicly.</TE>
<TE>   "I know there are a lot of women who claim it is a fertility
ritual, but I don't think that is accurate," she says. "It is a basic
voluptuous movement which makes it ideal for conditioning for
birthing, but that is not its reason for existence. That is a side
effect."</TE>
<TE>   But other teachers of dance say ties to childbearing rituals are
clear. A 62-year-old dancer who goes by the name of Morocco and runs
a studio in midtown Manhattan has researched the dance for 43 years.
She says that as late as the 1950s the dance was performed in parts
of the Middle East around the bedside of a woman in childbirth by a
circle of fellow tribeswomen. Some of the movements, she said, can be
traced to imitating the movements of labor and childbirth.</TE>
<TE>   "The unexpected side effect is that [the dance] does help
strengthen those muscles," Morocco said. "That was unintended. But it
works. And it sure beats a Lamaze course."</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the class we just danced. Song after song we
followed Ali. We watched her until the moves melted into our psyches,
becoming natural.</TE>
<TE>   I was not exhausted the way I am after I run, or swim, but I could
tell I was strengthening muscle groups that not even a full circuit
on Nautilus machines could ever reach.</TE>
<TE>   The women in the class all came for different reasons -- for fun,
for fitness, for sisterhood.</TE>
<TE>   "It has brought a lot of joy into my life," said Elizabeth
Hedberg, 69, who began dancing nearly three years ago because she
wanted a fun form of exercise. "It is like a girl's night out. It is
just the fun of being with a lot of other women. It is like a soul
dance."</TE>
<TE>   My thighs and buttocks were sore the next day. Who knows if the
dance would help me in labor, but I loved rocking my belly to the
beat, getting a heady dose of female bonding, and working out a bit
in the process.</TE>

<HD>A chasm of need in geriatrics field</HD>
<DH>The population of the U.S. is aging, yet fewer new doctors
are choosing to specialize in the care of seniors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jane E. Allen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dr. Jim Ericson is torn.</LD>
<LD>   As a third-year resident in internal medicine, he knows his skills
are desperately needed in geriatrics. But he would be poorly
reimbursed for long hours working through the multiple health
problems of older patients, and he needs to repay large medical
school loans. If he headed into cardiology or gastroenterology, he
says, he'd be "fantastically paid."</LD>
<LD>   Thousands of young doctors like Ericson face the same dilemma. And
most of them are choosing to bypass geriatrics, even as the field's
need for specialists increases.</LD>
<TE>   By 2030, 20% of the U.S. population will be 65 and older; up from
12.4% in 2000. Yet the number of certified geriatricians in this
country -- internists or family practice doctors with additional
certification in geriatrics -- will fall from 9,256 in 1998 to fewer
than 6,200 by 2004, according to authors of a study that appeared
last week in the Journal of the American Medical Assn.</TE>
<TE>   The study, conducted by researchers at the University of
Cincinnati Medical Center, included a survey of geriatrics program
directors at U.S. medical schools. It was prepared for the Assn. of
Directors of Geriatric Academic Programs, which seeks to improve
geriatrics training.</TE>
<TE>   Geriatricians provide more comprehensive care to older patients
with complicated conditions than most primary care doctors and
specialists. That kind of care translates into better physical
functioning and better survival for elderly patients, some studies
have shown. In addition, geriatricians are trained not just to seek
cures but also to manage chronic disease, and they tend to be the
doctors who deal with patients and families in the last years before
death.</TE>
<TE>   But several major obstacles stand in the way of young doctors who
might otherwise choose geriatrics.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no financial incentive," said Ericson, 37, who attended
medical school after an eight-year engineering career. Doctors are
paid to spend just a few minutes with patients, yet geriatrics
patients need more time.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody can get to know an 80-year-old patient in eight to 10
minutes, even in an hour," said Ericson, who is instead considering
general internal medicine. He said he might specialize in geriatrics
later if it becomes more financially feasible.</TE>
<TE>   Geriatricians rely in large part on Medicare payments because most
seniors are covered only through the federal health insurance program
for those 65 and older and the disabled. Medicare payments to
doctors, which were reduced in 2002, are slated to be cut further in
coming years, deterring young doctors like Ericson, the journal
report said. Even some veteran geriatricians have stopped taking
Medicare patients, said Dr. David B. Reuben, director of UCLA's
multi-campus program in geriatric medicine and gerontology. That's
especially true with geriatric psychiatrists, who are reimbursed at a
lower rate than other physicians participating in Medicare.</TE>
<TE>   Another problem is the basic difficulty of dealing with very sick
patients, often suffering from Alzheimer's disease.</TE>
<TE>   "Older people, particularly those who are frail or have cognitive
impairment, are tough," Reuben said. "I was with a resident about two
weeks ago. I had this very sweet lady in her 80s who was incredibly
demented and kept asking me the same things over and over again. The
resident said, 'I can cross geriatrics off the list. It's too much
work and it's too difficult.' "</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Reuben said, doctors trained to make patients better
may not feel comfortable with patients they're unlikely to cure.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very difficult compared to taking out a cataract or
repairing a broken hip," Reuben said. "It's the lack of a quick fix."</TE>
<TE>   Geriatrics combines internal medicine, family practice, neurology,
psychiatry and rehabilitation. Practitioners deal with problems
common in later years, including confusion and dementia, depression,
falls and physical instability, incontinence, chronic pain and
end-of-life care. While other specialists may do their work in the
office or a hospital, geriatricians also see patients in their
houses, retirement and nursing homes, day care and hospices.</TE>
<TE>   Medical centers are the key places to teach geriatrics. More than
60% of the heads of academic geriatric programs at U.S. medical
schools who responded to a survey cited too few geriatrics
researchers on their faculties, too few doctors pursuing advanced
geriatrics training, poor reimbursement and a lack of institutional
support as barriers to establishing stronger programs in geriatric
medicine.</TE>
<TE>   Academic geriatricians not only have a key role in contributing to
the standards of care for seniors, they also should serve as role
models for younger doctors, said Reuben, who was part of a national
oversight panel for the study.</TE>
<TE>   At Loma Linda University School of Medicine, where Ericson is in
his third year, Dr. James P. Larsen not only works with the
residents, he also lectures third-year medical students about
evaluating memory loss, preventing bed sores and determining when a
patient can be taken care of at home.</TE>
<TE>   Such early instruction is one of many opportunities to build
expertise among future doctors who most likely will not choose the
specialty. Because primary care doctors and specialists without
geriatric certification treat the vast majority of senior citizens,
academic geriatricians like Larsen, along with the study authors,
stressed the importance of making every med student, resident and
practicing doctor, regardless of their specialty, better able to
handle the unique problems of seniors.</TE>
<TE>   "I do think that education and getting at them at an early stage
does make a difference because it filters out to the community,"
Larsen said. "You get the medical students involved, the residents
involved and when residents graduate, many practice in the local
community and continue some of those habits they've learned."</TE>
<TE>   The field of geriatrics will never be like pediatrics, where
everyone of a certain age automatically goes to a geriatrician,
Reuben said. However, there are patients who could benefit from the
perspective and skills of a geriatrician. But they often can't find
one. Reuben cited the example of his own mother-in-law, one of the
25,000 seniors living at Leisure World in Laguna Woods, an Orange
County community with few geriatricians.</TE>
<TE>   Ericson said he recognizes the need for more geriatricians, but
that would require an extra year of fellowship before he can get back
on his financial feet. Right now, he said, "I'm wrestling with it."</TE>

<LD>Squat jumps help develop strength and power in your legs for a
variety of sports and fitness activities. Here are the ground rules
for keeping squat jumps safe and effective.</LD>
<LD>   1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Bend your knees
directly over your toes and sit back, moving your hips behind your
heels. Exhale as you swing your arms behind your hips.</LD>
<LD>   2. Inhale, sweep your arms overhead and push off your legs to jump
up. Extend your body upright. As you come down, be sure to land with
your weight on your toes then immediately transfer weight to the
heel. Use your entire foot as a rocker to spread the impact over a
greater surface. Try to keep your knees in line with your toes and
bend your ankle, knee and hip joints to help absorb the shock.</LD>

<HD>Test may predict coronary survival</HD>
<DH>An easy examination of blood looks for levels of hormone
that rise when the heart is damaged. The lower the level, the more
likely a patient will live.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jane E. Allen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A simple blood test may be able to predict the likelihood that a
patient will survive after being admitted to a hospital with a heart
attack.</LD>
<LD>   The quick and inexpensive test detects levels of a hormone, B-type
natriuretic peptide (BNP), that rises when the heart is damaged.
Doctors had been using measurements of the hormone to diagnose heart
failure and to determine the extent of damage after heart attacks or
severe chest pain, which can be an indication of major blockages in
the arteries.</LD>
<LD>   But a team of Swedish researchers looked at how well the test
could predict both initial survival and how the patients would do in
the long run.</LD>
<TE>   The scientists focused on part of the hormone, called the
N-terminal fragment, or N-BNP.</TE>
<TE>   They studied 609 patients admitted to the coronary care unit of
Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Goteborg, Sweden, from 1995 to
2000 and tested for the hormone fragment.</TE>
<TE>   The patients were followed for several years. Researchers found
levels of the hormone were significantly lower in patients who
survived than in those who died, according to findings published in
last week's online issue of Circulation: Journal of the American
Heart Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Both BNP and N-BNP more strongly predict short-term and long-term
survival than current tests, such as those for cardiac muscle
proteins called troponins that rise within hours of heart damage, the
authors said.</TE>
<TE>   However, while agreeing that levels of BNP and N-BNP appear to be
better predictors of long-term risk, Dr. James A. Lemos of the
University of Texas Southwestern Medical School in Dallas and Dr.
David A. Morrow of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston wrote an
editorial in the same journal calling for additional research into
using the test in patients admitted with a heart attack or chest
pain, and in determining the optimal time to perform the test.</TE>

<HD>Crankiness may be worse than other factors in heart disease</HD>
<DH>Deep-seated pessimism could be even more dangerous for men
than once thought.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hostility may make men more prone to heart disease than such
well-established risk factors as smoking cigarettes, excessive
alcohol intake and being overweight, new research shows.</LD>
<LD>   Defined as a deep-seated pessimism and mistrust of others,
hostility had been linked previously to heart disease.</LD>
<LD>   However, scientists thought that it was simply connected to a
lower socioeconomic status (a risk factor in itself) and that it
triggered unhealthy behaviors, such as smoking and greater
consumption of alcohol and food.</LD>
<TE>   But in a study of 774 healthy white men, in which 45 developed
heart disease within a three-year period, hostility turned out to be
a "more significant predictor of heart disease" than anything other
than cholesterol levels, said Raymond Niaura, a study coauthor and
psychiatry professor at Brown University Medical School in
Providence, R.I.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists don't understand the physiological reasons why
hostility increases risk, Niaura said, but these results suggest that
hostile people should seek counseling to manage their negative
feelings.</TE>
<TE>   The study was conducted by researchers from Brown University
Medical School, Boston University School of Public Health, the
University of Memphis and Harvard Medical School.</TE>

<LD>Some cancer patients and their doctors believe that positive thinking
and a determined spirit can help people in their battle with the
disease.</LD>
<LD>   A small British study done more than 20 years ago found that
having a fighting spirit improved a woman's chances of surviving
breast cancer, launching a wave of research and public interest in
the healing power of positive thinking.</LD>
<LD>   Now a team of researchers that systematically reviewed 26 of these
studies has concluded that there is no scientific proof that having a
positive attitude improves patients' odds at overcoming cancer. They
also found no proof that cancer patients who feel a sense of
helplessness or hopelessness have less chance of a cure.</LD>
<TE>   "There is little consistent evidence that psychological coping
styles play an important part in survival from or recurrence of
cancer," the researchers from Britain and Canada write in a study
published in the Nov. 9 edition of the British Medical Journal. The
results of this review raise a concern about efforts by physicians
and support groups to encourage positive thinking. According to the
researchers, trying to persuade a cancer patient to be positive or be
more of a fighter is not only inappropriate but also adds to the
psychological burden the patient faces.</TE>
<TE>   "We already knew that psychological factors have little influence
in causing cancer: Cancer does not cause cancer, for example," says
Mark Petticrew, a co-author of the study and public health researcher

<HD>A face lift for the second or third time may be as safe as

<LD>A face lift can push back the hands of the clock, but it obviously
doesn't stop the aging process.</LD>
<LD>   Eventually, the question arises: Is it safe to do it again? A new
study concludes that having a second or third procedure is no less
safe than the first.</LD>
<LD>   A study presented earlier this month at the annual meeting of the
American Society of Plastic Surgeons looked at 113 cosmetic surgery
patients, ages 40 to 81, who had second and third face lifts. Only
two patients had complications. One developed an infection in the
incision, and another, who had traveled from the West Coast,
developed a blood clot after the flight home.</LD>
<TE>   A repeat face lift does demand some modifications to avoid
complications, says Dr. Alan Matarasso, a New York City plastic
surgeon who presented the study. For instance, the skin and
underlying tissues are manipulated and moved less, less fat is
removed and care must be taken not to move an already-high hairline
even higher.</TE>
<TE>   Special precautions may be needed for an older patient, he says.
Those with hypertension, for example, must have their blood pressure
under control before surgery.</TE>
<TE>   The 2% complication rate for second and third procedures reported
in the study is comparable to that of a first face lift, Matarasso
says.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Much of what is known about bone loss comes from studies comparing
sedentary people with those participating in vigorous exercise
programs, and obese people compared with normal weight ones. Until
now, little has been known about bone loss in people who do routine
physical activities, such as walking, and who are a little
overweight.</LD>
<LD>   Researchers at Johns Hopkins University studied healthy men and
women older than 55 who fit this description to find out what helped
them retain bone and what didn't. Their finding, published in the
November issue of the Journal of Internal Medicine: Of all the
factors studied, carrying a little weight around one's midsection was
associated with less bone loss.</LD>
<LD>   The unexpected finding shouldn't prompt people to give up on
losing weight, caution the researchers. There are too many other
health risks, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, that are
associated with abdominal fat.</LD>
<TE>   The relationship between fat and bone deserves further study, the
researchers say.</TE>

<HD>For disabled, Medicare doesn't fill prescription gap</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Trudy Lieberman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Zonia Acosta takes eight prescription drugs each month to keep her
diabetes and related medical complications in check. The 52-year-old
Alameda County woman lost part of her right leg and has impaired
vision because of the disease. After paying rent and other household
expenses, she finds that her $1,104 monthly income -- from Social
Security disability payments and a small pension from her job as a
licensed family therapist -- leaves only $170 to pay for food,
medicine and transportation. She belongs to a Medicare HMO, which
pays for prescription drugs, but those benefits cease if her drug
expenses exceed $1,000 a year.</LD>
<LD>   Acosta reached her $1,000 maximum in September and will have to
pay for the drugs herself until January. Two of her medications -- an
insulin-control drug and test strips to monitor her blood sugar --
together cost $159 a month. She has refilled only three of the eight.
"I don't have the money to fill them," she says. "I am trying to get
help."</LD>
<LD>   Finding help can be difficult for Acosta and others among the
312,000 Medicare beneficiaries in California -- and 5.8 million in
the United States -- who are disabled. This group, the
fastest-growing segment of the Medicare population, is expected to
reach 7.6 million nationwide by the end of the decade.</LD>
<TE>   Paying out of pocket</TE>
<TE>   The typical disabled person on Medicare is a man about 50 years
old, although this group ranges in age from the very young to the
elderly. As a group, the disabled Medicare population is sicker, has
lower incomes, requires more prescription medications and pays more
out of pocket for them than Medicare recipients age 65 and over.</TE>
<TE>   "These people are very ill and in tough straits. They need a drug
benefit more than anybody," says Becky Briesacher, a research
director at the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy who
recently completed a study about the drug needs of disabled persons.
Despite the large number of disabled people, little attention was
paid to their specific problems during last summer's debate in
Congress about whether to provide a drug benefit for all Medicare
recipients. (The traditional, non-HMO Medicare program does not cover
prescription drugs.) Though efforts have been made to make drug
coverage more available to the disabled, the programs often come up
short, and people fall through the cracks.</TE>
<TE>   The difficulties begin with the Medicare program itself, which
requires that only people with a serious disability be eligible for
benefits. So someone must first apply for Social Security disability
payments, meet strict rules, then wait 29 months before receiving
Medicare benefits. In the meantime, they must pay for their own care.</TE>
<TE>   After the waiting period, a person can buy a Medigap policy that
covers prescription drugs. In Los Angeles County, for example,
premiums for the most generous policies covering drugs cost at least
$3,500 a year. It's unlikely that disabled people, three-fourths of
whom have annual incomes of $17,000 or less, can pay such a hefty
price.</TE>
<TE>   For a lower premium, they can join an HMO that offers drug
benefits. But these plans usually offer limited coverage that may
prove inadequate for seriously ill people, such as Acosta, who need
several expensive medications. Most Medicare HMOs have a $1,000
yearly cap on drug benefits, though some set the maximum at $2,000.
With drug prices rising quickly, however, even the more comprehensive
plans are scaling back benefits in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   No HMO option for some</TE>
<TE>   Also, the HMO option is unavailable to disabled people living in
24 California counties, most of them rural areas, in which no health
plans offer Medicare programs. Nationwide, nearly 30% of disabled
beneficiaries live in rural areas.</TE>
<TE>   Disabled people face another problem: Although their incomes tend
to be fairly low, they are often too high to qualify for Medi-Cal,
California's version of Medicaid, the federal-state program that pays
medical expenses for the poor. Medi-Cal provides drug coverage, but a
single person typically must have income of $969 a month or less to
qualify for free drugs. Pharmaceutical companies sometimes have
special programs to provide free medication to the poor, but those
programs have strict income limits. Not long ago I interviewed a
house painter in Michigan who needed a $42 inhaler to ease symptoms
of emphysema. One drug company he contacted said he didn't qualify
because his $12,000 annual income exceeded the company's $9,000
income limit.</TE>
<TE>   If people applying for free drugs are covered by any insurance
program, including Medicare, they don't qualify either. That leaves a
1999 California law that requires pharmacies to offer Medicare
beneficiaries the same discounted price for drugs that the state pays
to buy drugs for Medi-Cal recipients.</TE>
<TE>   Although the program was expected to allow Medicare recipients to
purchase drugs at discounts of up to 20%, the savings have not panned
out, says David Lipschutz, a staff attorney at the Center for Health
Care Rights, a Medicare advocacy group in Los Angeles. "Sometimes the
savings is pennies," he says. "Sometimes there's no savings. It's not
a viable option."</TE>
<TE>   Difficult to get discount</TE>
<TE>   And there's evidence that some California pharmacists are not
complying with the law, making it difficult for people to obtain the
discounts. Earlier this year a study in the New England Journal of
Medicine reported that only 36% of the pharmacies in Los Angeles
County volunteered information about discounts before researchers
specifically asked about them.</TE>
<TE>   The study also found that discounts were more likely to be offered
at pharmacies in higher-income neighborhoods than lower-income areas,
where many disabled people live.</TE>

<DH>A new 24-hour walk-in clinic offers quick help for those
with schizophrenia, depression, drug addiction and other mental
disorders.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Shari Roan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For years, after-hours medical clinics have helped people with
urgent, but not life-threatening, physical problems. Now, the concept
is being applied to mental health needs.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of high fevers, sprained ankles and sore throats,
county-funded Mental Health Urgent Care Center in Long Beach treats
schizophrenia, depression, drug addiction and other mental disorders.
The 24-hour center -- which may be the first of its kind in the
nation -- is desperately needed, county health experts say.</LD>
<LD>   While someone with a minor physical ailment might be able to put
off seeing a doctor, a worsening mental illness can rapidly become
dangerous. County health officials have long bemoaned the number of
people with mental illness who end up homeless, jailed or
hospitalized because they lacked routine mental health care or
couldn't wait until office hours to see their doctors.</LD>
<TE>   "Normally these folks go to the emergency room or get picked up by
police," said Dr. Debbie Innes-Gomberg of the L.A. County Department
of Mental Health. "Here they can get an evaluation or a prescription
or a meal or, sometimes, just a clean pair of pants and a shirt. That
is so unique."</TE>
<TE>   Many counties have mental health crisis centers or daytime
clinics. But the concept of an all-hours, walk-in clinic for the
mentally ill, although new and untested, holds particular promise.</TE>
<TE>   The Paramount Boulevard clinic, which opened in May, is not for
everyone. People who are a danger to themselves or others legally can
be confined to a mental hospital. But, treatment at the center is
voluntary, says Ed Bienkowski, a clinical psychologist and
administrator of the center.</TE>
<TE>   The center's small staff, which includes a psychiatrist and a few
psychiatric nurses, aims to apply a Band-Aid -- with medication,
counseling or a referral for specialized treatment -- to problems
that could quickly escalate. So far, the center has drawn a variety
of clients from throughout Los Angeles County, from a college student
grief-stricken over a busted romance to a disoriented, homeless woman
fresh off a bus from the Midwest.</TE>
<TE>   William Barfield, 48, went to the center one night after he began
hearing voices. He was in a residential treatment program for drug
and alcohol abuse at the time and worried that telling someone might
result in his removal from the residence.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt a little embarrassed about saying anything," he said,
sitting in the clinic's lounge the next morning. "I'm the type of
person who doesn't feel comfortable talking to just anyone."</TE>
<TE>   He confided in a social worker who had helped him in the past,
however, and she brought him to the Mental Health Urgent Care Center.
The doctor there reassured Barfield, prescribed medication and
referred him to the Long Beach Mental Health Center for follow-up
treatment.</TE>
<TE>   "This was very convenient," said Barfield, a Los Angeles native
who said he has worked as a firefighter and bus driver. "I've gone to
[the hospital] before and have waited 16 to 20 hours before being
seen. Here, I didn't sit more than 30 minutes."</TE>
<TE>   Studies show that 75% to 90% of people who seek emergency
room care for mental illnesses are hospitalized, often because there are
no other alternatives, Bienkowski said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're the other way around," he said. "Hospitalization is usually
our last option. This [center] should save money in hospital beds,
psychiatric emergency room care and, indirectly, save the police
money."</TE>
<TE>   Since its opening, only 6% of the roughly 500 clients seen at the
center have been referred for hospitalization.</TE>
<TE>   That's an admirable rate, Bienkowski said, since most of the
center's clients (they must be at least age 18) have already been
diagnosed with depression, manic depression, schizophrenia, severe
anxiety or drug or alcohol problems that coexist with a mental
illness. Many are indigent or receive publicly funded care in the
county's overburdened mental health clinic.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, Bienkowski said, the center provides a day of "respite
care" to a person who is having problems getting along with family
members or in a board-and-care facility. "We had a man whose mom
called the police because she said her son pulled a knife on her,"
Bienkowski recalled. "The police didn't feel they could legally hold
him and brought him here. He spent the night and the next morning his
mom was willing to take him back in."</TE>
<TE>   Clients can stay at the center for 24 hours -- usually enough time
to provide initial treatment and a referral for follow-up care, he
says.</TE>
<TE>   The county views the center as a pilot project that could be
expanded if it proves successful, Bienkowski said. He is conducting a
study to see if the center meets its objective of reducing
incarcerations and hospital emergency room visits in Long Beach,
where three-quarters of the clients reside. In the meantime, a
similar center was recently opened in Alameda by Telecare Corp.,
which also operates the Mental Health Urgent Care Center for the
county.</TE>
<TE>   In researching plans for the clinic, county mental health
officials conducting a nationwide review could find nothing like it.
"This is something I think people will look at as a new model,"
Bienkowski said, adding that people have already begun to ask him
"when someone will open a center like this in a town near them."</TE>

<LD>Anyone who has ever gotten on -- and fallen off -- a skateboard,
snowboard or surfboard knows that keeping one's balance is essential
for a successful ride. That's why Carolyn Perrier and Rob Rosborough
developed the Pivit, a balancing device that consists of a board and
a barrel-shaped wheel (called a "rock") that rides on a track. It's
meant to help board aficionados get better at their sports, and
fitness buffs improve their balance.</LD>
<LD>   Pivit: Users stand on the board and rock back and forth -- a task
more challenging than it sounds. First-timers are advised to hold on
to something, such as a wall or a counter, until they feel
comfortable going it alone. After mastering the basics, bolder souls
can try tricks such as jumping, turning and walking on the board.</LD>
<LD>   As to whether the Pivit and its ancestors -- including the Bongo
Board (still around) and the homemade wood-plank-and-wheel version --
are necessary for mastering board sports, opinions are mixed. Danny
Lewin, a skateboarder and event director for the New Jersey-based
United Skateboarding Assn. (which promotes skaters and skate events),
said he's seen people try them out in stores, but doesn't know anyone
who owns one. "The best practice [for skateboarding] is to do it," he
said.</LD>
<TE>   But Tom Collins, executive director of the Truckee, Calif.-based
United States of America Snowboard Assn., a nonprofit group that
promotes the sport, said snowboarders do use such devices. "They can
help you maintain your balance, and that's very important in board
sports," Collins said. "You can also use them to train indoors as you
get closer to the season -- kind of like having a treadmill or a
rowing machine."</TE>
<TE>   Price: Retails for about $80 and is available online at
www.gopivit.com or at select Sharper Image stores.</TE>

<HD>Ways to fend off that pain in the side</HD>

<LD>Are there any ways to prevent side-stitches when I exercise?</LD>
<LD>   Although many people experience these pains -- sometimes sharp,
sometimes dull and nagging -- in the side of their abdomens, experts
aren't sure of the exact cause. The best theories include muscle
spasms in the diaphragm or trapped gas pockets (caused by exercising
too soon after eating). Because we aren't sure of the cause, it's
hard to say exactly how to prevent them. But recent research from New
Zealand found a few things that may help reduce the risk of
side-stitches:</LD>
<LD>   After a meal, wait 30 to 90 minutes before exercising.</LD>
<TE>   Instead of high-intensity workouts, try longer, lower-intensity
workouts.</TE>
<TE>   Do a long warmup at a slow, easy pace.</TE>
<TE>   If these prevention strategies fail, slow down and breathe deeply
to alleviate the pain. Press your fingers to your side, giving the
painful area a sort of "pressure massage."</TE>
<TE>   But the researchers, at the New Zealong Academy of Sport in
Auckland also found that as aerobic fitness increases, side-stitches
seem to diminish. So my best advice is to be consistent with your
workouts and exercise at an even pace. As your endurance and
cardiovascular fitness improve, the less likely you are to have
annoying side-stitches.</TE>
<TE>   At the gym the other day, I overheard a trainer tell his client
they were going to work her deltoids. What are deltoids and how do
you work them?</TE>
<TE>   The deltoids aren't a mysterious body part -- they're the muscles
covering the shoulder joints -- but they are often neglected when we
work out.</TE>
<TE>   For muscle balance and strength, we should work all our shoulder
muscles, not just the front. These exercises are quick, easy and
target the front (anterior deltoid), middle (deltoid) and rear
(posterior deltoid) shoulder muscles These muscles need to be strong,
not only for sports but also for everyday tasks.</TE>
<TE>   Shoulder presses (work the mid- and top shoulder):</TE>
<TE>   Sit on a chair or a bench, holding weights in each hand. Keep your
back straight with both feet flat on the floor. With palms facing
forward, raise your arms to shoulder level and bend your elbows so
that your arms have a 90-degree angle.</TE>
<TE>   Press the weights overhead until your arms are almost straight.
Bend your arms and slowly lower the weights to the starting,
90-degree position.</TE>
<TE>   Lateral raise (works the middle of the shoulder):</TE>
<TE>   Holding a weight in each hand, stand with your feet hip-width
apart and your knees slightly bent. Keep your arms at your sides with
your palms facing in.</TE>
<TE>   Bend your arms slightly and raise them up and out to the sides
until they're just below shoulder height. Slowly lower to the start.</TE>
<TE>   Rear shoulder fly (works the rear part of the shoulders):</TE>
<TE>   Holding a weight in each hand, sit on the edge of a bench or
chair. Keep your feet flat on the floor. With arms straight down at
your sides (palms facing inward), bend over at the hips so your chest
is over your thighs and you feel a stretch through the back of your
shoulders.</TE>
<TE>   While bent over, lift your arms up and out to the sides. Keep
elbows slightly bent as you lift. Once your arms reach shoulder
height, lower the weights to the start.</TE>
<TE>   Do this shoulder workout twice a week, preferably with three sets
of each exercise.</TE>
<TE>   Stretch: To help prevent injuries, add a shoulder stretch between
sets. Stand or sit (back straight) with your hands clasped behind
your back. If you're flexible enough, press your palms together,
fingers pointing backward. Stretch your arms up as far as you
comfortably can as you lift your arms, your chest and shoulder
muscles will expand and stretch. Keeping your palms together, stretch
your arms up.</TE>
<TE>   Relax and repeat between each shoulder set.</TE>

<LD>Thyroid disease -- A graphic that accompanied a Health section story
on Oct. 14 gave some incorrect information. The graphic stated that
patients with hypothyroidism (underproduction of thyroid hormones in
the body) should avoid products containing ephedra and caf- feine.</LD>
<LD>   On the contrary, such advice is recommended for patients with
hyperthyroidism (overproduction of thyroid hormones.)</LD>
<LD>   Also, the graphic listed two "common treatments" for
hypothyroidism -- a lifelong regimen of prescription hormone therapy
and dietary changes. The graphic should have explained that hormone
therapy is the recommended conventional medical treatment, and that
health professionals recommend dietary changes as a supplemental
treatment.</LD>

<HD>The power of regret</HD>
<DH>Painful recollections can become a positive force for
change, therapists say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Benedict Carey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Regret is as old as conscience itself, a staple of Bible stories and
barroom confessions through the ages. Yet only recently have
researchers begun to clarify its emotional impact, and learn how it
affects our health and behavior.</LD>
<LD>   "Especially after middle age, regret can become a very powerful
factor in the way people think about themselves," said Dr. William
Callahan, an Irvine psychiatrist. "I hear it all the time: 'I never
got close to my children' or 'I promised myself I'd never be the
reincarnation of my father, and I've become him.' "</LD>
<LD>   They are the kind of laments, therapists say, that can turn us
against ourselves for the rest of our lives.</LD>
<TE>   Yet the common response -- to look away, to move on -- is neither
psychologically healthy nor realistic, some psychological researchers
say. Regrets can be emotional billboards, announcing who we are and
what we most want. By changing the way we think about regrets, we can
even alter their emotional impact. This evolving view is based partly
on research, partly on the experience of psychiatrists caring for
older adults. For these therapists, patients' regrets are not
necessarily a sinkhole of misery but a reservoir of personal history
that can be used to relieve symptoms of depression and anxiety,
especially in older adults.</TE>
<TE>   Regret, said Dr. Daniel Plotkin, a geriatric psychiatrist in Los
Angeles, "is a natural part of having lived a full and rich life,"
often reflecting a history of many dilemmas and complex choices.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Learning from the past</TE>
<TE>   Regrets are one form of the endless loop of what-might-have-beens
that braids itself into the ongoing life narrative that runs in our
heads, psychological researchers say. Some of these thoughts are
benign and directly useful: The observation "I should have studied
harder for that last test" can motivate people to work hard and score
better the next time, research has shown.</TE>
<TE>   It is the larger self-betrayals that permanently crimp our
narrative tape: a marriage ended too soon, or too late; an
educational degree left unfinished; a move across the country, away
from aging parents. "Imagining what might have been is usually
healthy; it's one way we learn from the past," said Neal Roese, an
associate professor of psychology at the University of Illinois in
Urbana-Champaign who studies how thoughts like regret influence
behavior. "But there's a big difference when something awful happens
and we cannot repair it. That's when we can get stuck in the negative
emotions of serious regret."</TE>
<TE>   In some severely depressed patients, these memories can be
overwhelming, and are best left alone, experts say. Probing regrets
may only deepen their despair, and could prompt suicidal thoughts,
said Dr. Joel Streim, a geriatric psychiatrist at the University of
Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   But many people swimming in self-blame are likely making
themselves ill. Preliminary evidence from an ongoing study of 120
older men and women suggests that serious regrets are associated with
physical symptoms, such as migraine headaches and gastrointestinal
problems, according to Carsten Wrosch, a researcher at Concordia
University in Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   In a study published this June, Wrosch and Jutta Heckhausen, a
psychologist at UC Irvine, reported that the specific way we think
about our regrets can significantly affect our emotional well-being.
The healthiest approach varies with age, they found. The pair
administered questionnaires on regret and mental health to 122 adults
ranging in age from 20 to 87. Younger adults who scored high on
measures of mental health tended to blame themselves for the behavior
they regretted; they assumed they had full control of the situation.
This makes sense, the researchers conclude: When we're young, we
still have plenty of opportunity to repair damage we've done, and
regrets can motivate us to do so.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, older adults scoring high on the tests were more
likely to give themselves a break. With little or no ability to take
action to remedy the consequences of their mistakes, they apparently
adapted by altering their perception of the regret; they no longer
shouldered all the blame. If an estranged father had died before they
could repair the relationship, for instance, these people told
themselves, "I tried, but Dad never gave an effort"; or that Dad's
second wife "never wanted us to be close," according to Wrosch.
Spreading blame in this way defanged the memory and allowed them to
think about their father without needless self-loathing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sharing the blame</TE>
<TE>   It's certainly possible that they're deluding themselves,
researchers say; but it's preferable to excessive self-blame. The
shadow of regret can hang so heavily that it obscures the many
practical, even courageous decisions people did make when they were
busy passing on their grand ambition or neglecting to save much
money, psychiatrists say. According to Roese, studies of memory have
found that people who consider multiple scenarios and explanations
when recalling an event -- maybe Dad was afraid to reach out -- can
more accurately reconstruct what happened. "In regret, you're
imagining only how your life could have been better," he said. "You
could just as well ask how it might have been worse. OK, so you
didn't write the novel. You decided to spend more time with your
family instead. What would happen if you'd neglected your family? How
would you feel then?"</TE>
<TE>   In older adults this pondering over paths not taken is a natural
and healthy part of reminiscence, in which people begin to see
themselves as mortals doing their best to navigate uncertainties,
rather than fools or villains, psychiatrists say. One of Plotkin's
patients, a former newspaper reporter in her 70s, lived for decades
regretting that she hadn't been a better mother. In the 1950s and
1960s, as her three daughters were growing up, she'd spent long hours
at the office. The sensation of having neglected her children was so
raw that she felt unworthy of moving with a daughter and family to
Pennsylvania, despite an open invitation to do so. She hadn't cared
for them properly; why should they have to care for her? In therapy
Plotkin helped her appreciate the value of the choices she had made:
Her commitment to work was no substitute for being at home, but her
success later stood as an inspiration to her daughters.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1917 essay on the subject of loss, Sigmund Freud
distinguished between two kinds of grief: mourning, the natural and
psychologically protective sadness of letting go; and melancholia,
the pathological self-flogging that occurs when people refuse to let
go. Some psychiatrists view regret as a kind of grieving over lives
unlived. "One way to think about it is that by nudging people off
self-blame you can move them toward a life review that is more
bittersweet and wistful, more sad than angry -- more like mourning
than melancholia," Plotkin said. In reviewing her life, the former
news reporter was better able to forgive herself. She eventually
moved east, spending her final years with her daughter and family.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Remorse as motivator</TE>
<TE>   Because they so richly express the things we most want for
ourselves, regrets can also move people to make changes they would
otherwise never consider. In a recent study, psychologists Abigail
Stewart and Elizabeth Vandewater analyzed in-depth interviews with
some 200 female graduates of the University of Michigan and Radcliffe
College. The graduates answered questions about regrets and life
satisfaction in their 20s, again in their mid-30s, and then in their
late 40s. Almost all of them had regrets, often about missed career
opportunities. By their late 40s, about 65% of the women had acted to
resolve that regret by taking night classes, completing a degree or
doing part-time work, the researchers found. Compared to the other
35%, those who'd made life changes were significantly less likely to
report symptoms of anxiety or depression, such as difficulty sleeping
and feelings of worthlessness. "One woman told us in the first survey
she married the wrong guy, and by the second survey she'd found
someone else," said Vandewater. "Now, that definitely counts as
taking action."</TE>
<TE>   While getting a night-school MBA or remarrying may not be a
solution for most of us, that doesn't prevent psychiatrists from
using patients' regret to prompt more subtle but equally powerful
life changes. One of Streim's patients in Pennsylvania is a
94-year-old woman who withdrew from her grown children's lives
because she felt it best not to intrude. Discussing her regret over
this decision, she saw that her instinct not to "impose" was denying
her the kind of social contact and close personal connection she
actually craves.</TE>
<TE>   She has recently become close to several nurses, caregivers and
others in the home where she lives. "She's made the very best friends
of her adult life, right now," Streim said, "and she says she's
happier than she can remember."</TE>

<TE>   What people regret the most</TE>
<TE>   Several research studies have surveyed middle-aged and older
adults about the topic of regret. Based on those surveys, here are
the top five most commonly cited regrets. (The quotations are
examples of the types of regrets expressed by people).</TE>
<TE>   1. Education: "I should have finished school"; "I should have
learned Spanish."</TE>
<TE>   2. Career: "I never should have left that job"; "I never should
have gone into medicine."</TE>
<TE>   3. Romance: "I married the wrong person for me"; "I should never
have left my first husband."</TE>
<TE>   4. Family: "I should have spent more time with the kids."</TE>
<TE>   5. Spirituality: "I should have been more involved with my church
or synagogue."</TE>
<TE>   Others frequently mentioned:</TE>
<TE>   Health: "I should have quit smoking sooner"; "I should have taken
better care of myself."</TE>
<TE>   Self-improvement: "I should have been more assertive"; "I should
have been less stubborn."</TE>
<TE>   Finance: "I should never have sold my parent's home"; "I should
have bought that stock back then."</TE>
<TE>   Altruism: "I wish I had done more to help others."</TE>

<LD>Taste may not be the only reason garlic appears in so many dishes
around the world. The bulb has long been valued for its medicinal
qualities. Hippocrates treated infections and intestinal disorders
with it, and Muhammad used it to relieve pain from wounds. More
recent research has confirmed that the compound allicin in garlic has
therapeutic properties.</LD>
<LD>   Uses: Garlic is perhaps most popular as a remedy to lower high
cholesterol and high blood pressure. Some people believe it improves
blood flow, enhances immunity and prevents infection.</LD>
<LD>   Dose: Typically, 4,000 micrograms a day (about one clove).</LD>
<TE>   Precautions: Garlic supplements should not be used for at least
three days before surgery because they can increase postoperative
bleeding. They can also interact with blood-thinning drugs and alter
the effectiveness of some diabetes medications. Like the cloves
themselves, garlic supplements can produce an odor (on the breath or
through the skin). Stomach upset is possible.</TE>
<TE>   Research: The federal government is conducting an early phase
study to determine whether garlic helps lower cholesterol and
triglycerides in HIV-infected patients. Garlic is also being studied
for its possible effects on cancer and arthritis.</TE>
<TE>   Dietary supplement makers are not required by the U.S. government
to demonstrate that their products are safe or effective. Ask your
health-care provider for advice on selecting a brand.</TE>

<HD>In the grip of an obsession</HD>
<DH>Compulsive exercising can lead to guilt and depression over
missed workouts, a study of male college students shows.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Martin Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The idea of college-age men overindulging in unhealthy behavior has
received a good workout in everything from popular culture to
scientific study. From "frat house" summer films to psychological
research, campus men are almost always depicted as more likely to
abuse drugs and alcohol than women are.</LD>
<LD>   Now, an unexpected vice may be joining the list -- exercise, not
in moderation, but to the point of becoming an addiction. Researchers
at the University of Florida in Gainesville found that male students
were twice as likely to exhibit signs of exercise dependency, such as
guilt, irritability and depression over a missed workout as women
were. The find was somewhat surprising because research has
traditionally shown that women are more susceptible to body image
problems than men are.</LD>
<LD>   Two percent of college males exhibited symptoms of exercise
dependency, researchers found, compared to 1% of college women. The
study, published recently in the Psychology of Addictive Behaviors,
is among the first to determine the rate of dependency, what some
sports medicine experts call exercise addiction, among men and women.</LD>
<TE>   "A person with exercise-dependent symptoms may plan to exercise
for an hour," said Heather Hausenblas, an assistant professor of
exercise and sport sciences at the University of Florida and a study
coauthor. "Yet they exercise for three hours instead. It's exercising
to an extreme."</TE>
<TE>   The problem, which is thought to afflict less than 1% of the
general population, is far from being an epidemic on campuses,
researchers caution. Instead, experts hope the study will lead to a
better understanding of gender and exercise dependency.</TE>
<TE>   "There's so little solid information with regard to the condition
that just about everything is new information," said Dr. Cedric
Bryant, chief exercise physiologist at the American Council on
Exercise, a nonprofit San Diego-based organization that promotes
national fitness. "Part of the problem is that exercise is generally
viewed as a healthy habit, so people have a hard time believing it
could become a serious problem."</TE>
<TE>   The reasons for extreme workout habits varied dramatically. The
men most at risk for exercise dependency were those motivated by a
desire to improve both their mental and physical well-being, such as
by boosting their energy level. Those who exercised primarily to
improve their physical appearance could still become hooked on
exercising, Hausenblas said, but were less likely to do so than the
other group. The women most likely to become dependent on exercising
were indeed those whose primary concern was body image, the study
found.</TE>
<TE>   As with more serious addictions, people who exercise excessively
put their obsession first, often ignoring family, work and their own
health.</TE>
<TE>   In the study, 408 students enrolled in sports and fitness classes
at the University of Florida were asked questions about their
exercise habits and attitudes, such as what imagery they associated
with exercise ("I imagine a leaner me from exercising") and their
dependence risk ("I would rather exercise than spend time with family
or friends").</TE>
<TE>   The researchers said one of the primary signs of exercise
dependency is a "playing through the pain" attitude, such as a runner
with bad shin splints who maintains or even increases his or her run
distances.</TE>
<TE>   Other red flags include guilt over missed workouts, consistently
joyless workouts, sports-related injuries that don't seem to heal and
an inability to cut back on exercise despite repeated attempts.</TE>
<TE>   The study's authors, however, cautioned against generalizations
based on their findings, and said much more research is needed for a

<KH>NEW YORK, N.Y. GERALDINE BAUM</KH>
<HD>Men's magazines go at it like gladiators</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GERALDINE BAUM</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Spilling from newsstands on every corner here, magazines reveal a
world that is aggressive and glossy, bursting with talk of sex and
beauty, BVDs and DVDs, mountains of chocolate cake and rivers of lip
gloss. And on every cover a celebrity -- J-Los and Toms cruising
everywhere.</LD>
<LD>   Yet this vivid and varied world is born inside a few office towers
along 15 blocks of midtown Manhattan. It is here that magazines are
conceived and created; here they are tested and marketed; here their
editors and acolytes live, lunch and trade jobs; here that
conglomerates Conde Nast and Hearst, AOL Time Warner and
Hachette/Filipacchi exist side by side, warring states in a Balkan
empire.</LD>
<LD>   These days, the men's books are getting attention for sparring
with an undisguised hostility worthy of gladiators.</LD>
<TE>   A couple of hundred people run the entire magazine industry, and
primarily they watch each other all day. It's a very internal
conversation: They are all driven by the same market research; they
are all under the same pressure to be hip and to confront the reality
that most of their readers are spending an increasing amount of time
on the Internet; they all read Page Six gossip and Keith Kelly's
media column in the New York Post; and they all eat lunch at about a
dozen restaurants including Michael's, the Palm, and DB Bistro, where
they regularly scarf down $28 hamburgers.</TE>
<TE>   And what about the rest of the country? Who cares. As one wise
media man says, "When one touches an ice cube, the other twitches.
That's what they care about."</TE>
<TE>   A secret aching for sameness creates bizarre competitions among
these magazine people. And so dozens of fashion-obsessed editorial
assistants at Elle, Vogue and Harper's Bazaar -- young, female and
starving -- vied last spring to own (get ready) a pair of green,
Balenciaga cargo pants that at full price would have cost about $900.
This is all part of the illusion magazine divas perpetuate, that they
alone can keep America up to speed on what is the best/hippest thing
-- be it pants, sex, couches, CDs or emotional crises.</TE>
<TE>   A rare emissary among the rivals is the Post's columnist Kelly.
Twice a week, he chronicles this world in several short items that
are read first thing in the morning and analyzed over lunch. Often,
he reports job changes before the departing editor has a chance to
announce to his staff he's defecting.</TE>
<TE>   Five years ago, Mark Golin, a funny, chain-smoking editor in his
late 30s, left a smallish publishing company in Allentown, Pa., to
work in this capital of cheeky cover lines and vodka ads. First,
Golin worked for Hearst's aggressively submissive Cosmopolitan; then
he went over to upstart Dennis Publishing to run testosterone-pumped
Maxim; eventually, he upgraded to Conde Nast's slightly fey Details.</TE>
<TE>   But before Golin even had a chance to tell the frat boys at Maxim
he was jumping ship to lead the stylish boys at Details, columnist
Kelly described his departure in his column. (Golin has since moved
to AOL and is now on loan to Time Inc., home of about 130 magazines,
to dream up a new template for men's magazines. As if.)</TE>
<TE>   "My theory is in some ways I cover a small town, its ins and outs,
winners and losers," Kelly said. "And every now and then there's a
real juicy murder."</TE>
<TE>   Although he's just a beer-drinking guy from Brooklyn who wouldn't
be caught dead summering in the Hamptons, Kelly relishes setting
swank insider scenes. He was the first to report a lunch in April at
the celebrity-populated Da Silvano (think Uma, Gwyneth and Calvin)
between Art Cooper, GQ's editor, and John Huey, the editorial
director of AOL Time Warner's magazines. Cooper wanted Huey to
cooperate with a GQ writer assigned to write a profile of him; Huey,
who hadn't been in his job even a year, wanted Cooper to delay the
piece. Neither got what he wanted; Kelly described the meeting in
absorbing detail in the next day's paper, and a scathing profile of
Huey, who runs one of Conde Nast's chief competitors, appears in the
December issue of Conde Nast's GQ.</TE>
<TE>   And so it has gone for years, with magazines nibbling at each
other's advertising revenues, flanking each other by coming in
younger and hipper month to month, and slavishly courting advertising
agencies located in office towers along another 15 blocks of midtown
Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, however, somebody does do something, well, sort of
different.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, for example, the men's competition heated up when Felix
Dennis, an eccentric British publisher, sent a scout to New York to
investigate whether so-called British laddie boy magazines, anchored
by busty blonds and goof-ball humor, would make it in the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   In no time, Maxim had rented a purposely un-GQ office suite
decorated with fish tanks and girly posters, and the new magazine was
blanketing newsstands with more attitude, more sex, more style and of
course lots more almost-naked chicks. The literate and respected GQ
and Esquire looked stuffy by comparison. And really, it wasn't the
sex that was most threatening to these great men's glossies and
appealing to the advertisers. It was the message -- we're hipper and
we serve up surprises every month. Maxim's circulation now surpasses
GQ's and Esquire's combined.</TE>
<TE>   At lunch this week, Maxim Editor in Chief Keith Blanchard, who is
36, drank two rum and Cokes and dug through a hefty bowl of pasta
while explaining Maxim's success and constantly taking shots at GQ,
its prime competitor.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't consider ourselves journalists like they do at GQ," he
said. "We're entertainers and we know guys have short attention spans
and rather than fight that, we want to affirm it. We're not trying to
impress anybody at an awards luncheon. We're trying to have fun."</TE>
<TE>   With a 2.5-million circulation and more than $150 million in ad
revenues last year, Maxim has clearly found enough 20-something guys
with attention deficit syndrome to read, as its cover announces,
about "sex, sports, beer, gadgets, clothes."</TE>
<TE>   Over at the Conde Nast tower with its Frank Gehry-designed
cafeteria, no one at the very sleek GQ was willing to talk on the
record about the competition. Although GQ remains satisfied with its
756,000 circulation and growing ad revenues, a highly placed Conde
Nast source did find just a few minutes before speeding off to a
black-tie dinner to provide a copy of Maxim with a dozen yellow
Post-its on pages he found notable for being misogynistic. Some of it
is ugly. Mostly, it's tasteless. "When the Maxim readers grow out of
this trash," he said, "GQ will be there as it has been for 45 years
to show them the way."</TE>
<TE>   But Jon Katz, media critic and author, doesn't think the
self-absorbed magazine industry is doing its readers nor itself any
favors with this feuding.</TE>
<TE>   "The regular Joe is bald, fat, horny and pissed off at his boss
and henpecked by his wife," said Katz. "The average guy is not
one-tenth as stylish as a GQ guy or a Maxim guy."</TE>
<TE>   Katz thinks the magazines will do themselves in someday if they
don't leave those 15 blocks and start asking important questions
about men.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody is sitting around those restaurants asking how can we
really serve men better, how can we find out what they are really
worried about. Instead, these guys are just marketing hipness. In the
long haul, they'll be sacrificed to their own obsessive love at being
temporal."</TE>

<HD>Speaking exclusively for himself</HD>
<DH>'Violet Hour' star Hamish Linklater is the son of a
legendary voice teacher, but he has his own distinctive voice.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Boehm</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In Richard Greenberg's "The Violet Hour," the young 20th century and
its possibilities stretch before John Pace Seavering. At 25, just
back from the Great War and armed with a Princeton diploma, a
patrician's pedigree and the confidence that comes with class, cash
and connections, he sets out to make his mark as a publisher of fine
literature.</LD>
<LD>   Hamish Linklater, 26, who plays Seavering in South Coast
Repertory's world premiere production, has a pedigree of his own.</LD>
<LD>   His mother, Kristin Linklater, chairs the graduate theater program
at Columbia University; her name is synonymous with a widely used
method for training actors to get the most out of their voices.</LD>
<TE>   Hamish was 2 when his Scottish mom co-founded Shakespeare &amp;
Company in Lenox, Mass. He grew up surrounded by theater people, and
he watched pros do the Bard night after night. By age 8, he was
getting Shakespearean child roles; by 19 he was a pro on the regional
theater circuit.</TE>
<TE>   "He has this amazing combination of youth and maturity," Greenberg
said from his New York City home. "Actors his age aren't usually
geared to the theater in quite the way he seems to be. I've heard
people compare him to Jimmy Stewart. He's in that tradition of
likable American intelligence."</TE>
<TE>   For most of the play -- and he is onstage for all but a few
minutes -- Seavering is a trampoline for other characters seeking a
bounce. They plead, threaten and stake their very lives on getting
him to publish their books. Linklater says his challenge is to
register aplomb under pressure, even as a strange intrusion that Rod
Serling would have appreciated darkens the mood in Seavering's
manuscript-littered office high above Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   "He's going to be a poster boy for the gilded age. He sort of
epitomizes that optimism," Linklater says, his 6-foot, 2-inch frame
folded into an orchestra seat in SCR's new Argyros Stage. "That's a
perfect setup for what happens in the second act, because then he
sees all the evidence to the contrary. The tricky part is that you
need to hold up the tone of the piece and the character, which is
affable and graceful."</TE>
<TE>   A waggish streak</TE>
<TE>   Deep-voiced and hyper-articulate, Linklater is full of muted
chuckles and the occasional husky, hawing donkey laugh. He has enough
of a waggish streak to say that the secret to his onstage affability
is the big roast beef sandwich and espresso jolt he treats himself to
as a pre-curtain ritual. "That keeps me perky and hopefully keeps
John Pace perky too."</TE>
<TE>   He says no Seavering-like indecision ever shadowed his choice of
career: "This is always what I loved the most."</TE>
<TE>   Linklater tried studying English for a year at Amherst College,
then lit out for the New York stage. He was accepted at Juilliard and
his mother's alma mater, the London Academy of Music and Dramatic
Art. But good parts kept coming, and he decided he would rather act
than be schooled to act. Linklater's on-the-job training during his
early 20s included playing Romeo on tour for six months in 1998 with
the Acting Company as well as being directed by Peter Hall in
"Measure for Measure" and "A Midsummer Night's Dream" at the Ahmanson
Theatre in 1999, and by Andrei Serban in a 2000 turn as Laertes in
"Hamlet" at New York's Public Theater.</TE>
<TE>   Linklater played a doctor in the short-lived TV series "Gideon's
Crossing" in 2000-2001, which led to his transplantation to L.A. By
then he was affianced to playwright Jessica Goldberg (they married in
January). Linklater says his connubial rights include parts in
everything she writes, including last year's Taper, Too production of
"Good Thing" and "Sex Parasites," commissioned and recently
workshopped by the Mark Taper Forum in its New Work Festival.</TE>
<TE>   Training 'by osmosis'</TE>
<TE>   One credential Linklater can't claim is formal training in the
Linklater Method.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever I do have from her, I got by osmosis. I do a bastardized
version of her warmup every day before the show. I know the method,
but I don't want to say I'm a representative of it, because if I
sound tinny or stupid or lose my voice, I don't want to reflect badly
on my mom."</TE>
<TE>   Kristin Linklater says there's no danger of that. "Most actors
need training, but he's developed his own individual natural ability,
and if it can happen like that, that's the most exciting kind of
actor. I think our relationship as mother and son is more important
than me trying to pull a teacher-authority number on him."</TE>
<TE>   Hamish says he is not entirely lacking in motherly acting advice:
"She's always very proud of my performances, but after being proud
for about a half-hour, she gives me a few notes on my diction and
tells me to avoid those cheap moments [of] hammery."</TE>
<TE>   Landing screen roles is his priority now; he'll be seen starting
Dec. 7 playing reporter Richard Roth in "Live From Baghdad," a
fact-based HBO movie about CNN crews covering the Persian Gulf War.
Like many actors, Linklater figures he'll continue to do theater out
of love while emphasizing film and television because that's where
the money is. "If a great play comes around or you get a chance to
work with a great director, you jump at it."</TE>
<TE>   His wife, the Bard and the creator of John Pace Seavering top the
list of playwrights whose worlds he wants to keep inhabiting.</TE>
<TE>   "Goldberg, Greenberg and Shakesberg. I want to do the whole
canon."</TE>

<HD>Updike the artist draws a woman as real as Rabbit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Merle Rubin</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amaster craftsman of language, John Updike also studied as a young
man to become a painter. His writing has always reflected his keen
eye for the visible world but now, in his 20th novel, his sense of
the visual achieves its apotheosis.</LD>
<LD>   "Seek My Face" is the story of a female painter whose life --
artistic and personal -- has made her a key figure in the history of
American postwar art. A respected artist in her own right, Hope
Chafetz is equally famous as the wife of art legend Zack McCoy, the
hard-drinking, dazzlingly original Abstract Expressionist whose fiery
life was extinguished in a car crash. Hope later married the central
figure of Pop Art, Guy Holloway, before finding a more conventional
kind of marital bliss with businessman and art collector Jerry
Chafetz, now deceased.</LD>
<LD>   The story unfolds within the confines of a single chilly April
day. Hope is being interviewed by an artsy young woman from New York
who has driven up to her rustic home in Vermont. "Interviews and
critics," Hope feels, "are the enemies of mystery, the indeterminacy
that gives art life."</LD>
<TE>   Yet, here she is, at 79, somewhat to her own surprise, telling the
interviewer more about her private life than the interviewer has
asked to know. The young woman's pointed questions spur Hope into
hitting back with even more provocative answers. Yet she does not
tell all, not only because of a certain residual reticence but also
because the interviewer does not seem to need quite as much material
as Hope has to offer.</TE>
<TE>   Consumed, as an artist and a woman, by the desire to give of
herself, Hope "has never learned how little the world needs us to
give...." We as readers, however, are privy to all that Hope leaves
unspoken.</TE>
<TE>   Although it is impossible not to see "Zack McCoy" as Jackson
Pollock (almost every detail about Zack's life and work comes from
Pollock's), it is not especially rewarding to read this novel as a
roman a clef. The parallels are suggestive but do not match. Pop icon
Guy Holloway may have a place in the city like Andy Warhol's
"Factory," where he films the sexual antics of drugged-out youth
(Holloway's is amusingly called the "Hospice"), but he also has
attributes of other Pop artists, like Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper
Johns.</TE>
<TE>   And Hope, like Pollock's wife Lee Krasner, plays a vital role in
supporting her husband's work and is herself a noted artist, but the
resemblance ends there. Krasner, the daughter of a Russian Jewish
immigrant family in New York, did not remarry, and she seems to have
been a less tentative personality than Hope, the child of
Pennsylvania Quakers. Indeed, apart from her gender, the real-life
person whom Hope most resembles is her creator, Updike.</TE>
<TE>   Hope's reflections on the course of American art in the latter
half of the 20th century express her sympathetic understanding of the
passions and ideals that motivated these artists and movements, but
they also reveal the degree of her estrangement from them.</TE>
<TE>   "There are times," she tells her interviewer, "when this whole art
business, which has been my life of course, seems terribly transitory
and disposable. I go to museums now and look at the oversize,
boastful canvases by Zack and Phil and Jarl and it all seems so
tired...." Unlike the Old Masters, or even Picasso, their colors have
shifted, dulled or faded: "Zack and the others got away from
permanence, they didn't grind their own pigments or have apprentices
do it for them, they took what materials were for sale around them."</TE>
<TE>   As for the playful Pop Art that came tripping lightly in the wake
of the Abstract Expressionist Sturm und Drang, Hope appreciates its
nimble wit and genuine craftsmanship, but she can scarcely revere it.
In Pop icon Holloway, a detached and disciplined man with a keen
sense of the ever-changing art market, Updike has created a character
who embodies the creeping sense of cynicism that dogs the
contemporary art scene.</TE>
<TE>   Hope's own artistic vision is different from Zack's or Guy's. It
involves a spiritual dimension, a sense of how precious -- perhaps
even sacred -- a gift is consciousness itself: "[H]ow marvelous ...
the incredible biological machinery that gives us consciousness, and
how we mostly just throw it away, even if we don't commit suicide, we
presume to find life dull and be bored most of the time, and
discontented, and just waste it." Art, for Hope, is the quest to lend
permanence to the transitory radiance of life.</TE>
<TE>   Hope's paintings are her attempts to embody this radiance.
Updike's deeply felt portrait of Hope's consciousness is his. For
perhaps the first time in his long career as a novelist, Updike has
created a female character as complex and fully credible as his
Rabbit Angstrom.</TE>
<TE>   Whether as a little girl encountering her first pictures or as an
elderly woman looking at the afternoon landscape, Hope has a
poignancy and luminosity that will linger in the readers'
consciousness long after they have finished the book.</TE>

<LD>It's a tough job trying to become the next "American Idol." But an
estimated 6,000 amateur singers are willing to do it.</LD>
<LD>   A throng of aspiring stars -- most of whom spent the weekend
sleeping on the ground and dining on fast food -- were expected to be
lined up outside the Rose Bowl in Pasadena today when the last round
of national auditions for the second edition of Fox's hit talent
show, "American Idol," kicks off.</LD>
<LD>   Numerous wannabes started arriving as early as Thursday to be
first in line for the tryouts, which will continue until Friday.
Their goal is to be the next Kelly Clarkson, the winner of the first
"American Idol," who scored a million-dollar recording contract and a
No. 1 single.</LD>
<TE>   By Sunday morning, a vast river of sleeping bags, air mattresses
and tossed pillows wrapped around the surrounding fields and parking
lots at the stadium as contestants lounged, played cards and launched
into impromptu -- and sometimes unwelcome -- performances.</TE>
<TE>   Christina Lewis, 19, who drove in from Mesa, Ariz., reclined on a
mattress just outside the bowl near the front of the line. "This is
something I just have to try," said Lewis, who plans to perform
Mariah Carey's "You're So Cold." "I know my chances may be slim with
all these people, but I just wanted to have fun."</TE>
<TE>   Jesse Clark, 21, who came from Stockton, wasn't intimidated: "I'm
turning a negative into a positive. I just want to sing." His
dedication to music was illustrated by his sideburns, which were
shaved in the shape of a treble clef.</TE>
<TE>   Tens of thousands of novices in Detroit, New York, Atlanta,
Nashville, Miami and Austin, Texas, have already tried out for the
upcoming edition of the series, which is expected to start early next
year on Fox.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, "American Idol" became a cultural phenomenon whose
popularity caught even Fox network executives by surprise. They had
expected it to be just a low-cost, youth-oriented summer series.</TE>
<TE>   But the show, with its fresh-faced contestants, a harsh British
judge and call-in polling that let viewers vote for their favorites
in elimination rounds, grew in viewership until it became the
most-watched TV show in its final weeks.</TE>

<HD>Bell a match for Brits' talent</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daniel Cariaga</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This season, the British ensemble the Academy of St. Martin in the
Fields is sending out three touring groups. The United States edition
reached the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts on Thursday night
with American violinist Joshua Bell at the helm.</LD>
<LD>   Bell's gifts and achievement certainly match those of the English
players. His fastidious and elegant playing is on the same
wavelength, and his effortless, glowing tone is mirrored in their
strong accomplishment.</LD>
<LD>   Their joint program offering two concertos with Bell as conducting
soloist, and Mahler's transcription for string orchestra of
Schubert's "Death and the Maiden" Quartet, balanced careful and
articulate playing with contained dramatic contrasts. A full house
greeted these performances enthusiastically.</LD>
<TE>   Leading from the first desk of violins, Bell the conductor kept a
low profile, barely signaling. Yet the ensemble's playing emerged
passionate and tautly controlled, all the low and high points in
Schubert's massive canvas clearly delineated and realized.</TE>
<TE>   As soloist, Bell never grandstanded, keeping his attention on
eloquent music-making. Bach's familiar A-minor Concerto began a bit
quickly, and perfunctorily, but soon settled into an expressive
dialogue between solo and orchestra. Haydn's wondrous Violin Concerto
No. 1 in C sang forth with authority and a contagious bounce.
Throughout, the small string orchestra resounded splendidly, living
up to its long reputation.</TE>

<HD>Saving voices of a generation</HD>
<DH>The Pacifica radio network is in a race against time to
salvage its disintegrating library of historic tapes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Carney</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, Eleanor Roosevelt, Abbie Hoffman,
Cesar Chavez -- these and other famous figures from American history
may be gone, but their voices live on in a massive library of
recordings at the Pacifica radio network. But those are in danger of
fading away too.</LD>
<LD>   Housed at the network's local affiliate, KPFK-FM (90.7) in North
Hollywood, most of the 47,000-tape collection resides in a packed
storage room, cooled by an air conditioner meant for a space half the
size.</LD>
<LD>   Faced with inadequate facilities and deteriorating acetate and
magnetic recordings, Pacifica's five-station network, which includes
stations in Berkeley, Houston, New York and Washington, D.C., is
planning a daylong pledge drive Tuesday to raise $200,000 to help
restore, preserve and house the tapes.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a recorded history of the 1st Amendment," said J. Brian
DeShazor, the Pacifica archives manager. "Every American should
understand it and appreciate it and help fund it. It is our
collective history."</TE>
<TE>   Among the selections from the network's 53-year history is a
recording of King's 1968 jailhouse visit with Joan Baez, imprisoned
in Northern California during an antiwar protest. A Pacifica reporter
was there and taped the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "That tape has already deteriorated in sound quality. We could
lose some of those rare, valuable recordings that represent our 1st
Amendment," DeShazor said.</TE>
<TE>   The recordings are significant not just because of the speakers
and the messages they convey, he said, but also because of the power
of the voices themselves -- greater than simply words on a printed
page. For example, DeShazor described a recording of civil rights
leader Fannie Lou Hamer, who was brutalized by police for leading
voter registration efforts in Mississippi.</TE>
<TE>   "You hear in her voice how she had been beaten for so many years,
but you can also hear how she had been empowered," he said. "You can
hear all of her struggle. It's very powerful."</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's programming will feature selections from the archives,
focusing on topics including civil rights, civil liberties, women's
studies, Native American rights and the peace movement, and donors
can receive excerpts as premiums.</TE>
<TE>   "They are sitting on a treasure," said Ruth Seymour, general
manager at KCRW-FM (89.9), who was arts director at KPFK in the early
'60s and program director in the 1970s. "If you really wanted to go
back and do a compendium on American life, they have stuff that
boggles the mind. It's very valuable."</TE>
<TE>   But the recordings aren't all political rhetoric and firebrand
speeches.</TE>
<TE>   The library also includes landmarks of arts and literature, with
performances by jazz great Duke Ellington, folk singer Pete Seeger,
blues singer Big Mama Thornton and pianist Bill Evans, among many
others. Ernest Hemingway reads "In Harry's Bar in Venice," Bette
Davis discusses youth and age in Hollywood, and Maya Angelou recites
a poem about womanhood.</TE>
<TE>   And in a nod to the radio drama that had been a staple of Pacifica
programming, the network commissioned a remake of the classic
thriller "Sorry, Wrong Number," starring Shirley Knight and Ed Asner.
That will air at 4 p.m. Tuesday on KPFK.</TE>

<LD>As a dance style, butoh is full of possibilities. You might be
rewarded for following a slow, enigmatic process that seems to unwrap
mysteries. It can also be an exercise in empty enigmas.</LD>
<LD>   What took place Friday night at Venice's Electric Lodge during
"Gig/Earthbeat 2002," an hourlong performance featuring two dancers
and a guitarist, was a lot of stillness and some inching along to a
rambling, atmospheric electronic score.</LD>
<LD>   The audience sat in two lines opposite each other. In the center,
Oguri and Jamie Burris lay in a line of stuffed forms. Eventually,
they moved. Eventually, they crawled past each other like partly
unconscious bodies, with hips and shoulders rising and sinking in
slow motion.</LD>
<TE>   At one end, G.E. Stinson stood amid black boxes, blinking lights
and pedals, playing or tapping the strings of his guitar and
manipulating machine noises. A pulse gave the static scene some
intelligent life after 20 minutes or so. On his feet, Oguri played
with stooping and wavering. Burris circled behind muslin, making
shadows. Oguri ran back and forth at the end. By then, the audience's
expressions had become the most fascinating part.</TE>

<HD>Shelton adds luster to 'Philomel'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard S. Ginell</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lucy Shelton remains one of our most enterprising new music sopranos,
with a stack of commissions from major league 20th century composers
on her shelf, ready for anything that a Boulez or a Carter or a Henze
might put in front of her. Those fortunate enough to have noticed
that Shelton was giving a free concert at CalArts on Saturday were
rewarded with a rare live performance of Milton Babbitt's 1963
electronic cantata "Philomel."</LD>
<LD>   More than just a demonstration of Babbitt's serial-rooted
virtuosity on the hulking RCA synthesizer, "Philomel" had sensuality
and dramatic shape as Babbitt's multi-channel tape -- superbly
reproduced in the Roy O. Disney Music Hall -- burbled and commented
on John Hollander's text. Shelton sang with luster and expression.</LD>
<LD>   Shelton also could be heard in Joshua Cody's folk-music
transcription "Ya No Me Peino Pa II," where despite the use of
microtones and the fizzing, scraping violin of Mark Menzies, the
tonality was always well defined. Though Earl Kim's "Earthlight"
struck me as tedious and fragmented, Shelton sailed through what must
have been a difficult succession of spoken and vocalise episodes, in
league with Menzies and pianist Peter Miyamoto.</LD>
<TE>   Elsewhere, Menzies performed solo pieces by Bob Clendenen -- the
lyrical "Summer Variations" and astringent "Affirmation" -- and
carried on parallel dialogues on viola with bass clarinetist Jim
Sullivan in Jim Gardner's "Burr."</TE>

<LD>George Harrison: "Brainwashed"</LD>
<LD>   Capitol</LD>
<LD>   ***</LD>
<TE>   In songs for this final musical statement, the quiet Beatle
approached death last year with a firm belief that it was not the end
but a transition, with a yearning for deeper understanding, with a
critical eye for the material world and even with a sense of humor.</TE>
<TE>   Of course that describes almost any Harrison album. Remember, he
wrote "All Things Must Pass" and "My Sweet Lord" 30 years earlier.
The reality of dying has only made his convictions more concrete.</TE>
<TE>   As co-producers, his son Dhani and Jeff Lynne keep Harrison's
distinctively deft slide guitar and jaunty ukulele the sonic
signatures, with just a few subtle nods backward to the Beatles as
poignant punctuation.</TE>
<TE>   The kicker is a sprightly take on Harold Arlen and Ted Koehler's
"Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea," with Harrison's uke
chiming and a mischievous sparkle in his craggy voice. A love song to
life, to music, to his wife and family, it's as much of a prayer as
the Hindi chant with which he and Dhani close this warm collection.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   lbums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair),
three stars (good) and four stars (excellent). The album is due in
stores Tuesday.</TE>

<HD>Beyond the lightning, there was Franklin the superstar</HD>
<DH>We're a society of quickened pulses, our impatience
incompatible with historical perspective.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOWARD ROSENBERG</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Blame much of it on TV. Just as most entertainment shows fix all
problems before the closing credits, so do news programs rev up
facile answers prematurely, dismissing context as musty and
irrelevant. These self-proclaimed lords of information are not so
much architects of learning as carpenters who hammer in minutiae
relentlessly.</LD>
<LD>   So cheer "Benjamin Franklin," a very smart PBS biography from the
production team that five years ago delivered the even more
intoxicating "Liberty! The American Revolution." No tidy endings or
team coverage here: Something chewable has been added to TV's menu of
gruel.</LD>
<LD>   "Ben Franklin" doesn't shimmer like "Liberty!" Yet once again
filmmakers Muffie Meyer and Ellen Hovde, along with executive
producer Catherine Allan, set the U.S. in a global landscape that
enables us to better picture ourselves in relationship to others.
Once again they dust off and energize events most often found
hibernating in books and brains.</LD>
<TE>   You'll be surprised to learn, by the way, that Franklin did not
leave his mother's womb in 1706 as the balding, avuncular old man we
see on $100 bills and elsewhere. Prior to finding a link between
lightning and electricity when putting a key to a kite during a
storm, and before entering geezerdom as one of America's founding
fathers, he actually had a youth.</TE>
<TE>   "It's easy to forget that he had hair once, that he was a little
kid," says one historian here. And as a young man in London, adds
another, "he sowed wild oats with abandon." This new film is a
hybrid. Think docudramamentary, a mingling of lively comments from
experts with superbly filmed reenactments and costumed actors
(notably Richard Easton as Franklin) addressing the camera while
speaking words from letters and diaries. They're a talky bunch, and
"Benjamin Franklin" at times buckles under the weight of its own gab.</TE>
<TE>   Yet expect smirky wit as well as gravity. There's truth to that
old saw about those who ignore history being destined to repeat it.
Beyond that, "Benjamin Franklin" makes history flat-out fun.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd of scholars here attests to a wide and enduring interest
in Franklin, whose amazing life has generated lore for storytelling
around the campfires of all generations. No current U.S. public
figure is remotely like him.</TE>
<TE>   He was born a candle maker's son in Boston, rising from "impotence
to importance, from dependence to independence," he's quoted as
saying about himself.</TE>
<TE>   His great mental acuity fit the Age of Enlightenment in which he
lived. He was a self-made businessman and prominent publisher who by
age 35, we hear, was one of the richest men in Philadelphia. He was a
slaver turned abolitionist, standing apart from his fellow founding
fathers -- whose concept of liberty excluded blacks. He was a writer
and a passionate inventor, credited with creating not only aphorisms
galore but also bifocals, the Franklin stove, a system for street
lighting, a more efficient post office and, most famously, the
lightning rod.</TE>
<TE>   The consensus is that Franklin generated his own sparks. "That
blasted kite with its key," as one historian calls it, "made him a
celebrity." Not that he wouldn't have reached stardom without it.</TE>
<TE>   Two trips abroad are recalled here as pivotal in his growth as an
epic American. The first, in 1757, has him returning to England on
behalf of Pennsylvania to squeeze money from its founder's son, the
aristocratic fop Thomas Penn. Fat chance. "Mr. Franklin's fame means
nothing here," Penn sniffs.</TE>
<TE>   A supporter of the realm whose eyes light up like Union Jacks when
he says "the British Empire," Franklin stays in England nearly 18
years. His loyal wife, Deborah (Roberta Maxwell), remains at home,
and his readiness to sever her from his life for so long hints, we're
told, that he was less a saint in private than in public. While in
London he also somehow wangles the New Jersey governorship for his
son, William (James True-Frost), even though his raging Anglophilia
later fades after Parliament imposes the repressive Stamp Act on the
Colonies. When Franklin finally sails home, he's firmly for the
revolt that's already underway, putting him in conflict with the
royalist William.</TE>
<TE>   Franklin is off to Paris a year later on a second seminal journey,
"the master publicist," as some call him, this time secretly cajoling
France to join the battle against the British. He plays the French
like chess pieces ("You learn caution, not to make your move too
quickly ... "), while visiting the salons of poufed, perfumed and
powdered aristocrats whose own revolution waits in the wings.</TE>
<TE>   The wheel of history does turn, doesn't it? In a bit of a role
reversal from today, England was America's antagonist then, France
the ultimately supportive friend. And Franklin's Paris period --
leading to a treaty with the French that was critical in forcing the
British to their knees -- is described here as "the culmination, the
pinnacle of his entire life." Still, his homecoming is modest
compared with the euphoric hero worship accorded George Washington.
"When you pick your heroes to revere, you're picking the myth about
yourself that you want to tell," observes historian Carol Berkin.</TE>
<TE>   Just how exciting were these times of great transition? You wonder
if living at the epicenter of history is overrated, and how it ranks
with stepping back and viewing events through the microscope of
another epoch, as "Ben Franklin" does so effectively. Whatever the
case, his story is well worth this chunk of TV time, as American
history continues to be a PBS signature as big and looping as John
Hancock's.</TE>
<TE>   First "Liberty!," then "Ben Franklin," evidence anew that
lightning strikes twice. Almost.</TE>

<HD>Jennings to remain as anchor of ABC's 'World News Tonight'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Jensen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Peter Jennings has signed a contract to remain as anchor of ABC's
flagship "World News Tonight" for an additional three years. Jennings
and ABC News, which is in discussions to merge with CNN, also reached
an agreement to form an independent news production company, PJ
Productions. The company will have a commitment to produce at least
four prime-time hours of the "Peter Jennings Reporting" documentary
series per year, a series previously produced by the network. That
deal runs five years.</LD>
<LD>   ABC sources had said earlier that Jennings, whose contract expired
this fall, had reached an agreement to stay, but that final details
hadn't been worked out. There was speculation that financially
pressured ABC News had asked Jennings to take a pay cut, as it has
demanded of many other employees, but an insider insisted that the
subject "wasn't an issue." Details of his pay weren't disclosed.</LD>
<LD>   PJ Productions also has the right to produce programming for
entities outside ABC. Jennings' recent documentaries for ABC have
covered such topics as the historical facts about Jesus and marketing
policies of the pharmaceutical industry.</LD>
<TE>   Jennings took over as solo anchor of ABC's nightly newscast in
1983. Since then, he has squared off against CBS' Dan Rather and
NBC's Tom Brokaw. Brokaw has said that he plans to step down as
anchor of the "NBC Nightly News" after the 2004 elections. Rather
recently extended his contract and says he has no plans to retire.</TE>

<HD>Dancehall on edge of going mainstream</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Randy Lewis</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Can Jamaican DJ and singer Sean Paul do for dancehall music what Bob
Marley did for reggae?</LD>
<LD>   We'll get an indication this week when Paul's sophomore album,
"Dutty Rock," debuts on the pop album chart. It's projected to sell
70,000 to 75,000 during its first week, which should allow it to
enter the chart in the Top 20 -- respectable by overall pop music
standards, but spectacular in the reggae and dancehall world.</LD>
<LD>   The album's sales are driven by the hit single "Gimme the Light,"
which has logged six months on Billboard's Hot 100 singles chart and
is still gaining steam, moving to No. 9 last week.</LD>
<TE>   The record's long life is attributed to the tenacity of the team
at Jamaica's V.P. Records, and to the recent partnership between V.P.
and Atlantic Records, which is providing the major-label push
considered essential to turn an urban radio hit into a mainstream pop
success.</TE>
<TE>   "It broke out of a few radio stations and continued to build, and
now that Atlantic has signed the deal with V.P., they've taken it to
the next level," says Anthony Acampora, director of charts for the
Radio &amp; Records trade publication. "It's Top 5 on [R&amp;R's] rhythmic
chart, Top 5 on the urban chart and rising fast on the pop chart. If
a record makes Top 5 on two charts, that's pretty good."</TE>
<TE>   It may be just the beginning for Paul in particular and dancehall
music -- a fast-paced, often bawdy style in which DJs rap over reggae
records -- in general.</TE>
<TE>   "We're big believers in V.P. as a label and in the amazing growth
of the dancehall reggae scene," says Atlantic co-president Craig
Kallman. "In the last 12 months, that scene has started to hit an
amazing groundswell in the underground and is now percolating on a
mainstream level bigger than it ever has."</TE>
<TE>   Dancehall has been around since the 1970s but has remained on the
margins of the wider pop music scene. What does it need to penetrate
the mainstream?</TE>
<TE>   "Without question, the single most important ingredient is having
an artist who can carry the torch," Kallman says. "The same way Bob
Marley was that icon to lead reggae into the global mainstream
marketplace, dancehall needs that superstar to carry it."</TE>
<TE>   Clearly Atlantic is hoping 27-year-old Kingston native Sean Paul
Henriques is that person.</TE>
<TE>   "He's definitely everywhere right now," says Violet Brown, urban
music buyer for the Wherehouse Entertainment retail chain. "Other
rappers are starting to use him on their records, and that's always a
good sign.... There are definitely other songs [with hit potential]
on the album so he should be around for a while."</TE>

<HD>A fragile legacy, handled gently</HD>
<DH>The negotiations were delicate, but in the end Japan agreed
to loan treasured theater robes and masks to LACMA.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Irene Lacher</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles County Museum of Art's chief costume curator had to
call on several skills to assemble the first major American museum
exhibition surveying the history of Japanese Noh and Kyogen theater
robes and masks, but perhaps the most important was patience. Indeed,
doing business in Japan parallels its counterpart in Hollywood in at
least one respect -- everything turns on relationships. And when it
came to mounting a definitive show on Noh theater, the art of gentle
persuasion was just as crucial as scholarly credentials in persuading
Japanese cultural officials to part with some of the country's most
fragile treasures.</LD>
<LD>   Sharon Sadako Takeda, head of LACMA's costume and textiles
department, remembers early discussions with the Bunkacho, Japan's
agency for cultural affairs, about borrowing the objects that would
make up the exhibition "Miracles &amp; Mischief: Noh and Kyogen Theater
in Japan," which opened Nov. 10. Takeda arrived with a wish list of
90 masks, enough to illustrate twice over the range of variations in
a 600-year-old art form.</LD>
<TE>   That number would allow the museum to replace the masks halfway
through the three-month show, necessary because Noh objects are so
light-sensitive that they're never displayed for more than one month
at a time in their own country. For the LACMA exhibition, the
Bunkacho has even assigned its own watchdog to check the light and
humidity meters every day they're on display. And because the objects
are so fragile, L.A. is the only American stop for the show.</TE>
<TE>   Even with all the special handling required, Takeda was stunned by
the Bunkacho's opening offer -- only four masks. "I said, 'Four? If
you make me rotate it, that's two masks up at a time. You can't do a
comprehensive exhibition about Noh with just two masks up.' "</TE>
<TE>   Five hours of hemming and hawing later, Takeda had managed to save
the exhibition. "I submitted 50, and in the end they came back with
35, and they don't need to rotate," she says. The Bunkacho ultimately
decided the masks were better off with less handling.</TE>
<TE>   Takeda ended up with an array of masks illustrating such esoterica
as Heian period (794-1185) standards of beauty, which required women
to blacken their teeth. Some masks display curiously universal
images, such as the Muromachi period (1392-1568) face worn by the
character Hannya, a ghost with horns signifying his jealous and
demonic nature.</TE>
<TE>   The lives of ghosts</TE>
<TE>   Noh drama, an art form cultivated by the ruling classes, largely
explored the inner lives of ghosts. A typical Noh marathon would be
interspersed with performances of Kyogen, comedies for commoners.
Kyogen actors wore costumes of dyed hemp, which the Japanese used for
clothing before they appropriated Chinese silk and embroidery during
the Southern Song Dynasty (1127-1279).</TE>
<TE>   Noh costumes could be as elaborate as the most sumptuous
aristocrats' robes. Some actually were; audience members showed their
appreciation by stripping off items of clothing and tossing them
onstage.</TE>
<TE>   Costumes made specifically for Noh performances tended to be
louder than everyday wear; their brighter colors and bolder patterns,
visible from a distance, were equivalent to contemporary stage
makeup, which is too garish for ordinary life. A Momoyama period
(1568-1615) robe in the exhibition, deemed an Important Cultural
Property by the Japanese government, is identifiable as a costume
because its pattern of herons and reeds is bigger and more dramatic
than would be seemly on an aristocrat. Takeda, who collaborated on
the show with professor Monica Bethe of Kyoto's Otani University, had
never seen the robe in person until she unwrapped it for the
exhibition.</TE>
<TE>   That was true of several pieces in the show, despite five years of
biannual trips to Japan to examine collections around the country.
Some shrines were impossible to get into, at times because they
lacked the staff to pull the robes out of storage.</TE>
<TE>   Important relationships</TE>
<TE>   Other times, Takeda found that cultivating relationships opened
doors. The Bunkacho advised her that the Hayashibara Museum might be
more inclined to lend its Momoyama period robes if LACMA offered its
director a trip to L.A. "Then the director changed, and I said, 'Do
we still have to honor that?' And they said no. So we were still able
to get quite a number from them."</TE>
<TE>   Takeda also tapped her network of colleagues to get behind closed
doors. When another scholar visited the Noda shrine in Yamaguchi
prefecture, she was able to tag along.</TE>
<TE>   "You climb up these dusty stairs, and they unlock the storage
house," Takeda says. "I met the head priest, who was a very cool guy,
and some colleagues had done an inventory of their collection, so I
started off with some photographs and just started limiting it down."</TE>
<TE>   Takeda examined the robes, which had been folded, placed in an
envelope and stored in a wooden chest, and selected a white silk
happi coat, an outer garment worn by warriors, demons and bandits.
The Edo period (1615-1868) coat struck her because of its unusual
pattern of holly-like leaves made of gold leaf.</TE>
<TE>   The show also features robes from LACMA's collection, including a
recently acquired 18th century garment that is on view for the first
time. The karaori with snow-laden camellias and Genji clouds,
signifying the joys of spring, has an elaborate design of silk twill
weave with silk and gold-leaf patterning.</TE>
<TE>   The 100 costumes in the exhibition, which includes mid-show
replacements, are organized according to tailoring, weave, patterns
and use. Paintings, scrolls and tools show how the fabrics were dyed
and woven. Musical instruments and props are on display, as well as
monitors showing clips of Noh dramas.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Noh's origins in the 14th century, many of the objects
seem oddly contemporary.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this exhibition will be popular with artists and fashion
designers," Takeda says. "There's so much here in terms of material
and pattern and color."</TE>

<HD>Eva Ayllon steals Los Hijos show</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ernesto Lechner</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Think of the voluptuous Eva Ayllon as an uncontrollable force of
nature, wondrous and potentially devastating. A human tornado. A
woman whose hip movements can make any man blush like a little boy
and whose throaty, potent, chocolaty voice recalls the passion and
intensity of Celia Cruz and Cesaria Evora.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, Ayllon is a world music diva in the making. And her
appearance Friday at UCLA's Royce Hall as the vocalist with a
revamped Los Hijos del Sol, the seminal group founded by
percussionist Alex Acuna, was a revelation for those domestic fans of
Afro-Peruvian music who believe the genre begins and ends with the
mercurial Susana Baca.</LD>
<LD>   In her native Peru, Ayllon is a household name. For decades her
eclectic repertoire has drawn equally from the folklore of her land
and contemporary pop idioms. Her talents are ideally suited for
Acuna's band, which seeks to bring Peruvian music into the 21st
century.</LD>
<TE>   Hijos was formed in 1989 and disbanded three years later, leaving
behind two albums still considered cult items. Acuna's decision to
resurrect the group with a new record and tour makes sense,
considering that stylistic cross-pollinations are de rigueur in
today's Latin music.</TE>
<TE>   Joined by Ayllon and a 13-piece ensemble, Acuna delighted the
capacity crowd with airy, mystically tinged sonics that were South
American at heart while venturing freely into jazz, rock and funk
territory. The bandleader shone on the drums, toying with tricky time
signatures, unexpected accents and brief pyrotechnical solos.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the evening belonged to Ayllon. Her rendition of Chabuca
Granda standards such as "El Surco" and "Un Barco Ciego" were
remarkably soulful. And the salsified "Animo y Aliento," marked by
Arturo Velasco's excellent trombone work, demonstrated that this
powerhouse diva can also shine in the realm of Afro-Cuban dance
fever.</TE>

<LD>You'd think a band would be feeling pretty chipper after selling
nearly 5 million copies of its debut album.</LD>
<LD>   Not the Escatawpa, Miss., heavy-rock band 3 Doors Down. On "Away
From the Sun," the follow-up to 1999's multi-platinum "The Better
Life," singer-lyricist Brad Arnold expresses his grand ennui with
such regularity that one of the quintet's "Better Life" hits,
"Loser," practically sounded celebratory by comparison when it rolled
around Saturday at House of Blues in Anaheim, first stop on a new
tour.</LD>
<LD>   The new album is a virtually relentless exploration of bad vibes.
Nearly every song offers some dour pronouncement on life -- and not
in the existentially sad, spiritually cathartic or illuminating way
that, say, Leonard Cohen does on his treks through the dark night of
the soul. Instead, Arnold often comes off as if he's grousing.</LD>
<TE>   The newer material also misses the rhythmic jolt the band injected
to mix things up on "The Better Life," in particular the propulsive,
double-time drumbeat of the breakthrough single "Kryptonite."
Fortunately, Arnold is a confident and charismatic, if not yet fully
commanding frontman. His stage presence, along with the more varied
songs from "The Better Life" woven into the 80-minute set, made the
concert a richer way to experience this band.</TE>
<TE>   Also from rock's aggro camp was the opening act, Breaking
Benjamin. Its set sounded almost wholly descended from Blue Oyster
Cult's "Don't Fear the Reaper," during which singer Ben Burnley
delivered an uncanny impression of Jim Carrey fronting a rock band.</TE>

<HD>Armenia's tragedy was long in coming to the movie screen</HD>
<DH>Before Atom Egoyan's 'Ararat,' attempts to raise funds for,
and interest in, a film about the 1915 genocide met with no success.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lorenza Munoz</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As producer Robert Lantos rose to introduce his friend, director Atom
Egoyan, inspiration struck. Lantos was fresh from a trip to his
native Hungary, where he had filmed the story of his family --
actually the story of Hungarian Jews from the turn of the century
through communist rule -- in the epic movie "Sunshine."</LD>
<LD>   As he spoke at a function at the Armenian Community Center in
Toronto, Lantos turned to Egoyan and said, "If and when the day comes
when you are ready to tell the story of your people, as your friend
and producer, I will stand by you."</LD>
<LD>   "It occurred to me that day that there was an important, almost
magical moment or a parallel with Atom," Lantos said, and that
afternoon three years ago nudged Egoyan into writing about his
Armenian heritage. The resulting movie, "Ararat," opened Friday to
favorable reviews and grossed an estimated $162,000 in five theaters.</LD>
<TE>   Although many ethnic and racial groups in America have told their
story -- Jews, African Americans, Asian Americans, Latinos, Italians,
Irish and Greeks -- Armenians have never seen their story dramatized
on the big screen. Egoyan's "Ararat" is the first theatrically
released feature film about the Armenians and the genocide.
Historians estimate that 1.5 million Armenians from eastern Turkey
perished from 1915 to 1923. Denying the genocide took place, the
Turkish government maintains that the violence was precipitated by
the outbreak of World War I.</TE>
<TE>   Egoyan said he struggled to find a way to tell such a sweeping
story.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people have a hard time generally depicting history. Why
do we need to witness atrocity?" he said. "How do you make people
want to see that? The way you do that is to make it contemporary and
to show that this can actually affect our contemporary lives."</TE>
<TE>   "Ararat" has prompted many Armenian Americans in Hollywood to ask
themselves why it took so long to tell this story. Sylvia Minassian,
founder of the Arpa Film Festival, an Armenian and international
festival held annually in Los Angeles, estimates there are several
hundred Armenian Americans working in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Heavyweights in the community include MGM owner Kirk Kerkorian,
Oscar-winning screenwriter Steven Zaillian ("Schindler's List"),
producer Arthur Sarkissian ("Rush Hour"), manager Aleen Keshishian
and her brother Alek, who directed Madonna's "Truth or Dare" concert
tour documentary.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1935, attempts at making a film about the genocide have been
either quashed by appeals from the Turkish government or turned down
by studios leery of the controversy and unwilling to risk money on a
historical epic.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, the rights to Franz Werfel's novel about the genocide,
"The 40 Days of Musa Dagh," are owned by German producer and director
Ottokar Runze, but the script has been floating around for 10 years
and is still in development. Mexican director Salvador Carrasco ("The
Other Conquest") hopes to direct another Armenian story, "Vergeen,"
about a young girl who survives the genocide and comes to America to
begin a new life.</TE>
<TE>   Producer Howard Kazanjian ("Star Wars: Episode VI -- Return of the
Jedi") said he has tried half a dozen times over the last 30 years to
get a studio on board, to no avail.</TE>
<TE>   "We have not been able to raise the financing," said Kazanjian,
noting that even Steven Spielberg had a hard time raising the money
to make "Schindler's List." "People are moving on -- they are looking
for the next 'Spider-Man.' "</TE>
<TE>   The Armenian community itself has not been responsive to his
attempts to raise money, Kazanjian said.</TE>
<TE>   "As generous as Armenians are in giving to the church and
philanthropic organizations, I have not been able to get them to put
up one dime to make this movie," he said. "They want it, but they
don't want to support it. Their fathers and mothers and relatives
were killed -- they want it, but they don't want to see it."</TE>
<TE>   Alex Yemenidjian, who is Armenian and the chief executive of MGM,
passed on "Ararat" when Egoyan brought him the script.</TE>
<TE>   "I liked the script, but economically it did not make much sense,"
Yemenidjian said. "You have to look at the above-the-line costs,
below-the-line costs.... While your heart says one thing and your
mind says another, I have a fiduciary responsibility to my
shareholders."</TE>
<TE>   It was Miramax Films founder Harvey Weinstein who decided to
distribute the film in the U.S. Lantos' Serendipity Point Films and
Telefilm Canada produced the $11-million movie with Miramax pitching
in.</TE>
<TE>   Weinstein said he had never really heard of the Armenian genocide
until Egoyan brought him the script. Once he read it and did his own
research, he felt it was time to tell the story. Having lost eight
relatives at Auschwitz, Weinstein related well to the subject,
although he said he expects to lose money on the film.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was way too compelling to ignore," said Weinstein,
who doesn't mind losing money on a film as long as Miramax continues
to make it up on others. "Financially it doesn't make sense, but so
what? It makes common sense, which is more important."</TE>
<TE>   Zaillian said he has wanted to write a story about the Armenian
American experience but, as a third-generation Californian, felt
somewhat disconnected from his grandparents' homeland. Like many
Armenian Americans who are fully assimilated into American culture,
he said he had relatively little contact with other Armenians when he
was growing up in a Los Angeles suburb in the 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   "Experience isn't always necessary, of course -- research can
sometimes make up for it -- but in this case, the lack of it has ...
produced a lack of confidence in myself to do it well," Zaillian
said. He said he was excited and even a little jealous when Egoyan
sent him the "Ararat" script to read. "So much time had gone by
without anyone having done it, I'd let myself get complacent,
thinking, 'One of these days I'll get to it.' "</TE>

<HD>'Secrets' out, at $87 million</HD>
<DH>The second installment in the Harry Potter series is on
pace for the all-time third-best debut.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>R. Kinsey Lowe</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hogwarts is back in session and new wizardry is afoot as "Harry
Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" conjured up an estimated $87.7
million over the weekend -- an impressive if not quite magical
opening for the "Potter" sequel.</LD>
<LD>   If studio estimates hold up when actual figures are calculated
today, the second in the series based on J.K. Rowling's books will
have posted the third-best opening weekend, behind only "Spider-Man"
and the first "Potter" film, "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,"
and ahead of previous third-place holder "Star Wars Episode II:
Attack of the Clones."</LD>
<LD>   Playing in a record 3,682 theaters (slightly more than the first
film did) "Chamber of Secrets" averaged a robust $23,816 per
location. Warner Bros. issued a record 8,500 prints, 381 more than
were issued for the first.</LD>
<TE>   Even though estimates were down a tad from the original's
spectacular $90.3-million debut exactly a year ago, Warner Bros.
president of theatrical distribution Dan Fellman said exit polls
indicate better audience response to "Chamber of Secrets" than to the
original, boding well for the long haul. Fellman, as well as
observers at competing studios, suggested the film may ultimately
perform better than the original, which took in $317.6 million in the
U.S. and $649.6 million internationally. Meanwhile, last weekend's
box office smash "8 Mile," starring rapper Eminem, dropped an
estimated 58% to second place with $21.3 million, by Universal
Pictures' estimates. The decline is steeper than would ordinarily be
considered healthy for a second weekend and puts into question
whether the film will be the blockbuster some had predicted. Its
10-day total is about $86.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   On the "Potter" front, fans seem to be getting younger even if
Harry himself is getting older. The boy wizard is 12 in "The Chamber
of Secrets," but there appeared to be few 12-year-olds inside
Grauman's Chinese in Hollywood on opening day.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly Leonard, an 11-year-old from Van Nuys, was older than most
of the kids in the audience. Wearing a red "Harry Potter" T-shirt,
Kelly gave the new film his stamp of approval. "There was a lot more
action than in the first movie, and it was a lot darker," he said.</TE>
<TE>   More typical of the crowd was Kelly's 6-year-old sister, Caitlin,
who claimed to have watched the whole movie without closing her eyes,
despite the much-discussed scarier content of the sequel.</TE>
<TE>   Although attendance at the Chinese fell shy of last year's
comparable opening-day matinee, turnout was higher at the AMC 14 in
Burbank on Saturday afternoon. Both screens showing "Chamber of
Secrets" were sold out. Despite capacity crowds of young children and
the film's two-hour, 41-minute running time, the Burbank theaters
were surprisingly quiet. Nine-year-old Kelly Lane had no problem with
the movie's length. "They had to put all the stuff that was in the
book in it," she explained.</TE>
<TE>   In its simultaneous opening in the United Kingdom and seven other
European and Asian markets, "Chamber of Secrets" took in an estimated
$54 million.</TE>
<TE>   Among noteworthy limited openings, Samuel Goldwyn Films'
controversial "El Crimen del Padre Amaro" ("The Crime of Father
Amaro") took in $476,440, a healthy average of $11,080 per theater in
43 locations. The film that depicts priests behaving badly endured
protests at home to become Mexico's highest-grossing domestic movie.</TE>
<TE>   In the U.S., the Catholic League denounced the film and another
group has waged a mail protest campaign, which doesn't appear to have
hurt it in the five major markets where it opened. Samuel Goldwyn
Films will add 10 markets Friday, for a total of 100 theaters.</TE>
<TE>   "Far From Heaven," Todd Haynes' critically acclaimed paean to
glossy '50s melodramas, expanded from five to 54 theaters, grossing a
lustrous $17,238 per location and weekend total of $930,872, Focus
Films reported. Its cumulative gross is just under $1.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   Artisan Entertainment's critically lauded Funk Brothers
documentary, "Standing in the Shadows of Motown," debuted with
$125,000 in 23 theaters, averaging a respectable $5,434. United
Artists reported that "Bowling for Columbine" had grossed $1.35
million in 11th place, averaging $5,443 in 248 theaters, bringing its
six-weekend total to $8.8 million and making it the highest-grossing
non-concert documentary.</TE>
<TE>   There are still chills aplenty in "The Ring." At No. 4, the film,
for which DreamWorks reported an estimated $11 million, had a total
of $101.6 million in its fifth weekend. Debuting in fifth place,
Sony/Screen Gems' "Half Past Dead" garnered an estimated $8.2
million. Sony positioned the film as an urban action picture with a
focus on Morris Chestnut and Ja Rule, and a studio representative
indicated the company was happy with the performance of Steven
Seagal.</TE>
<TE>   Box office tracker Nielsen EDI estimated business for all films
was $174 million, up 8% from the same "Harry" weekend last year. For
the year, the cumulative box office is an estimated $7.785 billion
versus $6.937 billion at the same point in 2001.</TE>

<HD>Talks underway on Latin Emmys</HD>
<DH>TV academies on both coasts are considering launching such
a show, even in the wake of the woes of the Latin Grammys broadcast.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Brian Lowry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite the difficulties that have faced the Latin Grammys, plans are
being discussed about the feasibility of establishing a Latin Emmy
Awards, with talks underway between the television academies in New
York and Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, based in New
York, is enthusiastically backing the idea and has engaged in
conversations with the two major Spanish-language U.S. networks,
Univision and Telemundo, about sharing the broadcast.</LD>
<LD>   The New York academy wants to position the event as a joint
venture between the two nonprofit organizations, which split
acrimoniously in the 1970s but have been exploring areas in which
they can work together more closely since the death of the eastern
academy's longtime president, John Cannon, last year.</LD>
<TE>   "We realize the fastest-growing area of the television business,
Spanish-language television, is underrepresented in our awards and
underrepresented in our business," said Peter Price, president of the
national academy.</TE>
<TE>   However, officials at the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences in
North Hollywood are approaching the idea with caution, saying they
are still "in the fact-gathering stage," determined to ensure that
such an event can work logistically in terms of exercising control
over judging procedures and awards criteria.</TE>
<TE>   Industry sources, in fact, say the New York academy has been
pushing its Los Angeles counterpart to take action for several
months. Price -- apparently hoping to jump-start the proposal --
offhandedly referenced the new Emmys show in a news release last
week, saying the goal is to have it up and running by next year.</TE>
<TE>   The tentative plan would be for the awards to recognize
Spanish-language programs in a full range of categories, including
prime-time soap operas (or telenovelas), news and sports.</TE>
<TE>   Among the concerns privately expressed is whether creating a
specialized Latin Emmy marginalizes Spanish-language programs, which
compete alongside English-language newscasts in local Emmy
competitions. Price noted that no award has been presented to a
Spanish-language production on the national level since 1998,
underscoring the need for separate recognition.</TE>
<TE>   Ratings are also an issue, with the future of the Latin Grammys
uncertain after this year's low-rated telecast on CBS.</TE>
<TE>   A Telemundo spokeswoman said the network has "no plans at this
time" to broadcast the Latin Emmys, and Univision officials could not
be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The New York academy hands out Emmys each year for outstanding
news, documentary and sports programs, while the West Coast academy
orchestrates the nighttime Emmys. The daytime Emmys are also
presented in New York, but with the L.A. academy's cooperation.</TE>

<LD>South Gate is an unremarkable little city surrounded by other
unremarkable little cities in southeast Los Angeles County. The
difference between them, however, is that the other little cities
manage to exist in peace and boredom and are rarely heard from. When,
for instance, was the last time you read of scandal, corruption,
political recall, gunfire or firebombings in Cudahy? South Gate has
had them all.</LD>
<LD>   Once proclaimed the Latino-dominated city of the future, it has
dissolved into a surreal world of cutthroat politics, racist
accusations and acts of violence. By comparison, politics in Compton,
often in a state of calamity, are beginning to look like the
scholarly debate of philosophers at a Greek forum.</LD>
<LD>   South Gate is a city of about 96,000, where the median income is
far below the county average. Eighty-three percent of the population
is Latino, and they're at each other like roosters at a cockfight.
Activists working to throw out the mayor and three others call them
corrupt, self-serving and insensitive to the needs of the community.</LD>
<TE>   The mayor, Xochilt Ruvalcaba, calls her enemies racist whites and
Anglicized Latinos who are locked in the old ways and can't accept
the town's new and progressive leadership. "It is the old regime
clinging to shreds of power," she says, then adds that South Gate's
biggest problem is the media. "You never hear of the good things."</TE>
<TE>   While I am certain there are many happy families in South Gate who
picnic together, work hard at their jobs, value their children and
love their puppies, there is also the fact that one progressive
council member was shot in the head by an unknown assailant and a
recall activist had three of his plumbing vans firebombed. I forgot
to mention that City Treasurer Albert Robles is facing trial for
allegedly threatening to kill two legislators and a police
lieutenant. Mayberry this ain't.</TE>
<TE>   What has riled reformers is a combination of factors that include
the city hiring of a disbarred attorney caught stealing from his
clients, members of the City Council tripling their salaries and an
acting police chief whose first hire was a cop once fired for tipping
off suspects in a drug investigation. And, oh, by the way, after
Robles was arrested on suspicion of making death threats, he was
appointed deputy city manager. Even if convicted, he stands to
collect $180,000 in severance pay.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a system gone totally wrong," says Joe Ruiz, the plumber
whose vans were firebombed. "We never thought it would happen here,
but it has. Even if the recall wins, it will still take 20 years to
clean up the mess."</TE>
<TE>   Ordered to hand over control</TE>
<TE>   After reformers gathered 8,000 signatures to recall Treasurer
Robles, Mayor Ruvalcaba and two other members of the City Council,
things got so bad that the state ordered the city to hand over
control of its special elections to the county. The order emerged
from the usual chaos. City officials rejected the recall petitions as
flawed, the reformers went to court and won, the city filed an appeal
and lost, and the state said enough is enough. Secretary of State
Bill Jones, citing electoral fraud and voter intimidation, has said
that compared with South Gate, elections are more lawful in
Nicaragua.</TE>
<TE>   Space forbids a recitation of all the events that have brought the
city under scrutiny. The mayor contends that it's a fight between
"the old Anglos" who once controlled the city and the young Latinos
who are in tune with what the community needs. She is scornful of her
Latino opponents as " 'good' Latinos who marry white and give up the
language." All she wants, she says, is unity and peace.</TE>
<TE>   One of two council members not being recalled is Henry Gonzalez.
He recovered after being shot in the head during the last election,
an act of violence he attributes directly to his political activity.
No one has been arrested either in that shooting or in the
firebombing of the vans owned by Ruiz.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all Latinos," Gonzalez said. "The majority of those who
signed the recall petitions are Latinos. And it's mostly Latinos who
pack the council meetings. The mayor tries to cut me off from even
speaking. She says, 'This is my meeting and I do what I want,' but
the city attorney tells her she has to let me talk. I'm ashamed to
say that I'm a member of this council."</TE>
<TE>   The recall election is set for January. The trial of Albert
Robles, often referred to as "the perceived political boss" of South
Gate, is also scheduled for January. God knows what might happen
between then and now, but it wouldn't be a bad idea to send in
international inspectors to reassure Cudahy and all the rest of us
that someone in South Gate isn't trying to develop weapons of mass
destruction.</TE>

<LD>Producer Marc Abraham believes there couldn't be a more appropriate
time for the release of his new prep school drama, "The Emperor's
Club."</LD>
<LD>   In the film, which Universal Pictures will release Friday), Kevin
Kline portrays a highly principled classics professor who discovers
that his rebellious new student -- the son of a U.S. senator -- has
cheated on a major exam.</LD>
<LD>   A quarter century later, there are ramifications.</LD>
<TE>   Abraham, who co-produced the Michael Hoffman-directed film with
Andrew Karsch, said that with corporate scandals involving Enron,
Tyco, WorldCom and Adelphia roiling Wall Street, the message of this
film will strike a chord with audiences. That message: Character
counts, and the seeds of deceit can be sown years before executives
ascend the corporate ladder.</TE>
<TE>   What the film doesn't do, he points out, is wrap up the plot in a
tidy package by the ending credits. "What it says is, 'Justice
doesn't always prevail,' " he said.</TE>
<TE>   The challenge for the studio is getting people into the seats.
While the film, rated PG-13, is expected to register with moviegoers
ages 27 and up, a major hurdle is attracting younger audiences, who
are much more inclined to see rapper Eminem's new film, "8 Mile," or
the action-packed James Bond movie, "Die Another Day," which opens on
the same day as "Emperor's Club."</TE>
<TE>   But Abraham isn't expecting "The Emperor's Club" to rack up
blockbuster numbers. Nor does it need to. "When you make a movie for
$12 million," he said, "you don't have to have a giant opening."</TE>

<HD>Writing off the writers?</HD>
<DH>Mexico's law ending tax exemptions for writers and
publishers has sparked debate about egalitarianism, the future of
intellectuals and the rising cost of books.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sergio Munoz</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Should writers be placed on the level of the archangels or the humble
bricklayer? It sounds like a Byzantine question, but in Mexico, it's
at the center of a bread and butter issue, a dispute for beans and
tortillas.</LD>
<LD>   Until recently, writers have occupied an exalted -- and tax-free
-- plane in the culture, which has traditionally treated its
intellectuals with the utmost respect. They are, Octavio Paz has
written of his fellows, "the critical conscience of the people."</LD>
<LD>   Some, like Carlos Fuentes and Elena Poniatowska, continue to enjoy
high status in some sectors of society, but their tax-free ride ended
this year. A new law imposed a series of taxes on the literary
community and set off a debate in the media, on the floor of the
Mexican Congress and in the offices of the Treasury that threatens to
go on indefinitely.</LD>
<TE>   Along with eliminating the writers' long-standing tax exemption,
President Vicente Fox's administration also reversed a policy that
reimbursed publishers for the taxes they pay on paper, ink and other
materials needed for manufacturing books, thus prompting an increase
in the price of books, which were already more expensive in Mexico
than in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Was this an attack on the country's intellectual life and ideals?
Or was it an egalitarian reform aimed at benefiting the average
Mexican by erasing an entitlement for an increasingly irrelevant
elite? Both arguments, as they play out in the political arena and in
discussion in the online version of one of Mexico City's highbrow
intellectual magazines, have vocal backers. And in those arguments is
an unfolding description of how Mexico sees the future of its
intellectual and artistic class.</TE>
<TE>   Favoring tradition</TE>
<TE>   Lining up in favor of tradition and against the new law is a
coalition of left-wing politicians and old-time intellectuals. From
the comfort of his house in Mexico City's posh Lomas de Chapultepec
district, Homero Aridjis, current president of PEN International,
decried the change in writers' tax status. "They treat us as if we
were bricklayers," he said, with a bluntness that pushed him into the
headlines.</TE>
<TE>   Never mind the gaffe, it's likely that Aridjis, a poet and
novelist who has written about archangels, was trying to speak for
the vast majority of Mexican writers, who find it hard to make a
decent living practicing their craft. In his "bricklayer" interview
with cultural reporters from the newspaper Reforma, Aridjis also
mentioned that most writers in Mexico have no medical insurance, no
retirement fund and no access to the social benefits to which other
workers are entitled.</TE>
<TE>   A few privileged Mexican intellectuals can live a very good life
teaching full time at an academic institution, their earnings
supplemented by a weekly column in the local press, a monthly
magazine piece or commentary on radio or TV. But they're the rare
exception. The rest will feel the impact of the income tax, which is
being imposed on those who make more than $3,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   It's their cause that the leftist Party of the Democratic
Revolution, or PRD, and the left wing of the Party of the
Institutionalized Revolution, or PRI, will make when they push to
rescind the new taxes in the Mexican Congress.</TE>
<TE>   But the "don't tax us, we're writers" argument doesn't fly with
some of the country's younger intellectuals. In a column in a local
newspaper, Jesus Silva-Herzog Marquez, one of the top guns in the
more youthful group, took Aridjis to task. Affirming that no group
should be granted a tax privilege, Silva-Herzog, a newspaper and
television columnist, professor and third-generation member of an
illustrious family of economists, poked fun at Aridjis, suggesting
that he had pictured himself as one of the archangels he has written
about.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. intellectuals</TE>
<TE>   In the United States, the idea of granting a tax privilege to
intellectuals may sound ludicrous. Intellectuals do not enjoy the
same prestige in the U.S. that they do in other parts of the world.
(In Ireland, for example, the government has exempted writers and
artists from paying income tax since 1969, in hopes of creating "a
sympathetic environment here in which the arts can flourish by
encouraging artists and writers to live and work in this country,"
wrote then-Minister for Finance Charles J. Haughey. The Irish law
shelters not only those who write books and plays but also those who
compose music, paint and sculpt, as long as their work has "cultural
or artistic merit.")</TE>
<TE>   The current discussion on tax versus culture in Mexico is part of
a larger battle between modernity and tradition.</TE>
<TE>   "In modern Mexico there should be no room for exemptions, as these
foster disputes for privileges," says Hector Aguilar Camin, a
novelist, essayist and television anchor for an influential and
popular weekly talk show.</TE>
<TE>   "There are traces here of old-style politics," he says. "My fight
for the guild, whichever union it may be, whether it's carpenters or
writers, makes me a hero, because the members of the guild want
privileges. That's wrong. Intellectuals, who must be demanding
accountability from authorities, should also be accountable, and what
renders more accountability than paying taxes?"</TE>
<TE>   These are sweet words to Fox, who signed the new taxes into law
and who is -- not incidentally -- desperately seeking ways to improve
tax revenues. This particular approach to meeting the fiscal needs of
the country, however, has stirred a bitter debate that pits culture
providers against the Fox administration.</TE>
<TE>   A press release, circulated by the PRD on behalf of a group of
relatively famous movie stars, called on Fox to solve what they
perceive as contradictions between his tax and cultural policies:
"Fiscal exemptions to writers, publishers and books should be
considered an investment in education. To say, like the government
says, that they are promoting reading while imposing taxes on books
is incongruous."</TE>
<TE>   Political analyst Luis Rubio has a different take. "The real
problem is that Mexicans do not read. That's why the government is
right emphasizing tax collection from writers and everyone else in
order to create literacy and 'love to read' programs in Mexico."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, reading is not a favorite pastime in Mexico. Although
statistics on the number of books read by Mexicans are hard to
compile, the consensus among analysts is that, on average, Mexicans
read less than one book a year. In Mexico City and its suburbs, where
more than 18 million people hardly manage to thrive, the
highest-circulation newspaper sells about 100,000 copies. And the two
top national intellectual magazines each sell perhaps 15,000 copies
monthly.</TE>
<TE>   Fox is well aware of the reading deficit in the country, and that
is why he has just launched a $140-million program to turn Mexico
into a country of readers. The program includes the goal of placing a
mini-library in every classroom in Mexico, so students can read and
take books home on loan. Another presidential initiative is to build
a $60-million state-of-the-art national library in Mexico City.</TE>
<TE>   Predictably, the announcement of the "mega-library," coming on the
heels of the tax discussion, caused another controversy. "This is
sheer nonsense," says social critic and prolific author Carlos
Monsivais. "Are we going to have a 'mega-library' without books?"</TE>
<TE>   Beyond financial issues, the debate over the new taxes highlights
a dramatic change in the government's perception of the role of
intellectuals in society. In the 1920s, a young
intellectual-turned-politician named Jose Vasconcelos facilitated the
birth of a Mexican school of painting by lending support and ceding
the walls of public buildings to painters such as Diego Rivera and
Jose Clemente Orozco. A hundred years before Vasconcelos, politicians
sought advice from former mentors and teachers, who were repaid with
jobs in the government. The Secretariat of Foreign Affairs was a
haven for poets and writers who found ways to pursue their craft
while representing their country abroad.</TE>
<TE>   A majority of the most respected intellectuals found no fault
working for the government. Enlightening government was a moral duty
for "the best and the brightest" and served to root out corruption.
It also provided them with the steady income their craft denied them.
The great Mexican poet Jaime Torres Bodet served as minister of
foreign affairs in the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   Paz, who joined the foreign service in 1944, was ambassador to
India until the massacre of Mexican university students in 1968 made
him break with the government of President Gustavo Diaz Ordaz. Until
that time, the job had a price, and those working for the government
had to give up their freedom to confront those in power.</TE>
<TE>   But that generation is vanishing. With limited exceptions,
including Mexican Foreign Minister Jorge Castaneda and Adolfo Aguilar
Zinser, Mexico's ambassador to the United Nations, intellectuals are
no longer sought in government. Now they seek new niches not only in
academia but also in the market and the media.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, they are discovering that although they once were paid
to be silent, now it pays to speak out critically. Open
confrontations between intellectuals and the government have become
daily occurrences.</TE>
<TE>   In a country like Mexico, where more than half the population
lives in poverty, whether intellectuals pay taxes is neither a
relevant nor a popular topic. But to most people, having to pay more
for the few books they might buy does matter, especially to the young
urban generation.</TE>

<HD>Growing, growing, gone</HD>
<DH>Onetime youth pop fledglings Justin Timberlake, Christina
Aguilera and Nick Carter take flight from the genre that nurtured
them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Geoff Boucher</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Isn't it amazing how quickly they grow up? Just five years ago, the
Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync were still new kids on the pop block,
reviving the tradition of heartthrob harmonies with a fancy dance.
Then in 1999 along came teen queens Britney Spears and Christina
Aguilera. The music charts were crowded with Mickey Mouse Club
alumni, and the future of youth pop looked as glittery as a prom
dress.</LD>
<LD>   That was then. Now, the whole youth pop thing seems so, like, 20th
century to many of the scene's own stars. That's especially clear
with the release of three new albums that together offer a story line
that's pitch-perfect for the WB Network: "Can our young stars --
Christina, Nick and Justin -- grow up and find happiness?"</LD>
<LD>   Aguilera has just released her first English-language pop album
since the 1999 debut effort that won her the Grammy for best new
artist. She is resolute this time that she not be viewed as a kid.
Her definition of an adult performer? The title of the album,
released on Oct. 29, says it all: "Stripped."</LD>
<TE>   Aguilera's raunchy new video, "Dirrty," is a declaration that in
2002 what a girl wants is to be a two-fisted stripper in a nasty
nightclub. The cover of the new Rolling Stone magazine, meanwhile,
features Aguilera wearing, well, a guitar.</TE>
<TE>   The same week Nick Carter became the first Backstreet Boy to dance
off on his own with a solo album. Justin Timberlake set the same
precedent a week later for 'N Sync. Each is the blond, blue-eyed star
of his group, but their new music is hardly interchangeable. Carter
trades in dancing partners for a backup band on "Now or Never," but
despite the extra guitar, the music is only an alley or two removed
from the Backstreet sound. Timberlake drifts further, offering old
school R&amp;B with a new textbook of hip-hop beats.</TE>
<TE>   Who is at the front of this graduating class?</TE>
<TE>   Music fans have weighed in. Aguilera's album has sold a healthy
499,000 copies in two weeks, debuting at No. 2 on the chart and then
sagging a bit to No. 4 in the second week. Those may not be
spectacular numbers, but Carter's solo project opened at No. 17 and
then tumbled to No. 63. His two-week total is 90,000 sold.
Timberlake, meanwhile, only needed a week to sell 439,000, debuting
at No. 2.</TE>
<TE>   In question is not only their solo efforts' commercial prospects
but also their impact on the singers' pop groups. "With Nick and
Justin, they're both like Sting coming out of the Police, and that
could mean, 'See ya,' " says Roy Laughlin, regional vice president
for Clear Channel, the national radio titan. No one, though, is
likely to compare Carter or Timberlake to Sting when it comes to
artistic heft, not yet and maybe never.</TE>
<TE>   After performing in lock-step with others for so long, Carter and
Timberlake are hungry to be seen as individuals, but the same may be
said of Aguilera. Always linked to Spears by timing and Mariah Carey
by approach, Aguilera yearns to define herself.</TE>
<TE>   "All three of them are trying to grow up; that's clear," says Jeff
Pollack, a leading consultant for radio, MTV and Hollywood. "Nothing
is automatic for any of them. There's no free pass for teen idols to
become more adult, mainstream artists. It will be interesting to
watch."</TE>
<TE>   A lot of people have been watching Aguilera with their jaws on the
ground. "Sometimes, when kids want to seem like they're grown up,
they start wearing less clothes. And that looks what Christina is
trying to do."</TE>
<TE>   That nugget of wisdom is delivered, with a laugh, by Jimmy Jam,
the veteran music producer who, with partner Terry Lewis, has worked
with Janet Jackson, Carey and many others. Jam says Aguilera is not
the first diva to flash flesh, but he's not sure she needs to be the
newest one.</TE>
<TE>   "I think when you've got the goods and then you go in a shockingly
different direction, it can be jolting for the public," says Jam.</TE>
<TE>   "Dirrty" has not cleaned up with radio programmers as well as was
hoped. But the video has been the talk of the town. In it, the
scantily clad Aguilera writhes, vamps and slugs her way through a
gritty club.</TE>
<TE>   Aguilera, 21, seems like a girl looking to dirty-dance her
troubles away. Despite the advice of many at her label, RCA Records,
she opted for "Dirrty" as the first single from "Stripped" instead of
the more radio-friendly ballad "Beautiful," and the album veers
wildly from style to style, like a kid playing dress-up.</TE>
<TE>   But Pollack says "Stripped" will be a hit because it has more than
sex appeal. "It's like with Cher or Madonna through the years -- they
walk out wearing something and it's the topic of conversation and
everybody notices, but there also has to be music," Pollack says.
"And there are a lot of good songs, including the next single,
'Beautiful.' "</TE>
<TE>   Jam says Timberlake, also 21, might be trying on a new persona as
well, albeit a less jolting one than Aguilera's.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing I always liked about 'N Sync and especially Justin was
he never really seemed to take himself seriously," Jam says. "That
was what made them different than the Backstreet Boys. Now Justin
seems a lot more serious. That can be overdone. If I was going to
give him advice, I'd say, 'Have fun.' "</TE>
<TE>   Timberlake's new disc, "Justified," goes for a purer R&amp;B groove
than the infectious froth pop crafted for 'N Sync. Michael Jackson
also guest stars -- well, not really, but Timberlake's solo work is
such an ode to his childhood hero that it sometimes feels like it.</TE>
<TE>   That's no surprise to Louis J. Pearlman, the music mogul who was
the early guiding force behind the Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync.</TE>
<TE>   "Justin has to be careful not to copy Michael Jackson's style too
much, and he has to go more into his own style," Pearlman says. "And
he will."</TE>
<TE>   Pearlman parted ways with the two groups after lawsuits and
accusations that he strip-mined their careers. The suits were
settled, the groups went their own ways and Pearlman, quite wealthy
from the ride, says he has nothing but affection for his onetime
proteges.</TE>
<TE>   Pearlman now predicts the groups will survive for years and that
Timberlake and Carter will "become like Phil Collins with Genesis,
solo but still in a group." If not, he says, no one in the two
quintets has a greater chance of solo stardom than Timberlake.</TE>
<TE>   For 22-year-old Carter, the challenge of standing alone may be
more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "Nick has always been a little shy," Pearlman says. "Nick has to
remember it's Nick Carter and his band up onstage, as opposed to Nick
in a band. He has to rely on himself and make himself a front guy.
And that's going to be hard for him."</TE>
<TE>   On "Now or Never," Carter leans toward the power ballads of
pop-metal. He had tracks from his new album premiered last weekend on
Radio Disney, the network that was among the chief beneficiaries of
the youth pop phenomenon.</TE>
<TE>   The core of the Radio Disney core audience is 3 million kids
between ages 2 and 11 and their mothers, and they won't be hearing
new songs from Timberlake or Aguilera, says Robin Jones, the
network's senior director of operations. It's an issue of growing up.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't fit in right now in lyrical content," Jones says.
"Because Radio Disney brings music to kids with lyrics that parents
have told us are appropriate, when artists try and 'grow up' by
becoming more sexual, they disappear from our playlist."</TE>

<LD>The Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra drew from its own ranks as well as
showcased guest artists for an impressive program of concertos
Saturday at the Alex Theater in Glendale.</LD>
<LD>   LACO violinists Josefina Vergara, Jennifer Munday, Susan Rishik
and Connie Kupka reveled in the unexpected combinations of
Locatelli's Concerto Grosso in F minor, Opus 7, No. 12. Concertmaster
Margaret Batjer joined guest violist Roland Kato for the West Coast
debut of Britten's Double Concerto, written in 1932 when he was a
student, but not published until more that two decades after his
death in 1976.</LD>
<LD>   Alisa Weilerstein, who was born in 1982, was the guest soloist in
Schumann's Cello Concerto in A minor. Music director Jeffrey Kahane
conducted.</LD>
<TE>   Weilerstein made her Southern California debut in March in Irvine
as part of a trio that included her mother, pianist Vivian Hornik
Weilerstein, and her father, violinist Donald Weilerstein. Now, as
then, she proved to be a fluent, accomplished player who applied a
lot of body English to her part, although, again, the sound she
produced didn't reflect that degree of expressivity. The Prelude from
Bach's Third Suite for Solo Cello was her encore.</TE>
<TE>   Britten's piece captured the imagination from the initial horn
call that signaled the arrival of a new musical voice -- one that is
strong and assured , and eager to explore new territory. Batjer and
Kato confidently took us on the journey through pastoral idyll to
whirligig tarantella until the return and transformation of the
opening motif.</TE>

<HD>Embodying the Hindu spirit</HD>

<AU>Lewis Segal</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In "Sarpagati: Dances of the Rising Serpent," Ramaa Bharadvaj
enlisted her considerable talents as a classical Indian dancer and
choreographer to illuminate profound concepts in Hindu philosophy.</LD>
<LD>   Presented Friday at the Norton Simon Museum, the six-part program
offered vibrant, artful performances attempting to fuse images from
sculptures in the museum's collection with ideas from a text read
with care and grace by Nimmi Raghunathan.</LD>
<LD>   However, when slides of the sculptures popped up during the
dances, the event veered dangerously close to the literalism of the
Pageant of the Masters. And when the dances failed to express the
texts but merely provided a decorative garnish, the project's
ambitions seemed misguided.</LD>
<TE>   In "Ananda Tandavam," perhaps the clearest, most effective
segment, Ramaa and Swetha Bharadvaj (her daughter) strongly embodied
the feminine and masculine energies of the Hindu deities Sakthi and
Shiva. Contrasts in force and deployment of weight, facial expression
and stance conveyed exactly what the narration described along with
an extra dimension of dancer radiance.</TE>
<TE>   But the audience had to take on faith the spirituality of "Prema
Geetam." Ramaa Bharadvaj mimed degrees of worry and petulance with
great flair, and Shivali Panchal added another layer of charm, but
union with the divine seemed at most an adjunct to this scene, never
its essence.</TE>
<TE>   Here and elsewhere, the dancers skillfully portrayed colorful
characters, but only the narration made them into something more.</TE>
<TE>   Swetha Bharadvaj, for instance, coiled and rippled her limbs
effectively in "The Rising Serpent," but it would take a different
kind of choreography to make an audience see her as "Kundalini
power." Any dance can be made metaphorical by narration; the best
ones do it themselves, wordlessly.</TE>

<LD>We don't ice skate much here in California, where I live. So before
my Great-Aunt Gretchen visited from Minnesota, I had never thought
about ice skating.</LD>
<LD>   But one day during her visit she took me to an indoor ice rink in
Los Angeles. We rented skates, and she tied my laces good and tight
so my ankles wouldn't sag.</LD>
<LD>   We had a good time, but to tell the truth, I was disappointed.
When I started out I didn't know that it was going to be so hard to
stay standing.</LD>
<TE>   No matter how slowly and carefully I moved, I kept falling. Hard.</TE>
<TE>   Finally we sat down on a bench to rest.</TE>
<TE>   "Would you like to hear a story, Karen?" Great-Aunt Gretchen
asked.</TE>
<TE>   I nodded.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was a girl in Minnesota many years ago," she began, "we
skated on a frozen pond in a park near our house. My first skates
were plain, black hand-me-downs from my brother, Rolf. But I dreamed
of having a pair of figure skates like the older girls wore as they
whirled and twirled gracefully over the ice.</TE>
<TE>   "Finally the day came when I received a pair of new figure skates.
How beautiful they were! They had firm, white leather shoe tops and
shiny steel blades with saw-tooth tips. I was sure that as soon as I
put them on I would whirl and twirl with grace and style too.</TE>
<TE>   "The next day was vacation. But it was especially cold and frosty.
Rolf was going to meet his friends at the ice pond, and I wanted to
go too.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe you should wait for better weather," my mother said.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't wait to try to my new skates," I insisted. "I'll be fine.
I promise."</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday: Will Gretchen be able to whirl and twirl on her new
skates?</TE>

<HD>By George and son</HD>
<DH>Harrison's last album is also his child's loving tribute.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Phil Sutcliffe</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>London</DL>
<LD>London</LD>
<LD>   Harrisongs, the business offices of the late George Harrison,
occupies a suave building in a rich West London square dating from
1810-ish. It also houses the Beatles' company, Apple, and the old
Moptops' spirit is pervasive.</LD>
<LD>   On the stairway wall, black-and-white photographs from Hamburg,
1960 -- grease-and-leather Harrison with Lennon and ill-fated "fifth
Beatle" Stuart Sutcliffe. All of them gone....</LD>
<TE>   A movement catches my eye. I look up -- and nearly fall down.</TE>
<TE>   George Harrison is standing at the top of the stairs, and time's
gone all back-to-the-future.</TE>
<TE>   Until George says, "Hello, I'm Dhani."</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, the former Beatle's son is used to startled looks. He
offers a handshake and a cup of Earl Grey tea. Later he mentions that
reactions to his appearance trouble him only when they carry twisted
implications that the resemblance is somehow a career move. "It's
genetic!" he insists, not unreasonably. "He's my dad!"</TE>
<TE>   It's hardly surprising that his father crops up in the present
tense often, because Dhani has spent much of the past year immersed,
with George's old Traveling Wilburys pal Jeff Lynne, in co-producing
his father's new album, "Brainwashed," which will be released
Tuesday, 10 days before the first anniversary of George's death from
cancer in Los Angeles. (See accompanying review.) U.S. retailers were
hesitant to predict a sales figure but suggested that it might debut
in the Top 10.</TE>
<TE>   Dhani, 24 and still living at his parents' home (his mother is
Harrison's second wife, Olivia Arias Harrison), has never done
interviews before. He talks fluently, joking about his motor mouth,
yet it's obviously not easy for him. "If I felt the way I do now, I
wouldn't have attempted to finish the record," he admits. "I'm sort
of worn out and sad."</TE>
<TE>   His consolation is his father's philosophy and conduct in extreme
adversity.</TE>
<TE>   Dhani points out that George wrote and recorded a song called "Art
of Dying" way back in the early '70s. Reflecting his study of Eastern
religions, chiefly Hinduism and Buddhism, George said years ago that
the lyric was about being able to "consciously leave the body at
death" and rising above the distraction of mundane thoughts.</TE>
<TE>   Well, spiritual exercises are one thing but, says Dhani, his
father's faith held, from the 1998 cancer diagnosis until the end:
"He never flinched. He never felt sorry for himself. He never lost
his sense of humor. He wasn't afraid of death, his own mortality,
although he was very aware of it. He wasn't even attached to his
body, if you know what I mean. We'd be in the kitchen and he'd say,
'Dhan, you know we are not these bodies, don't you?'</TE>
<TE>   "And that carried over to the final stage where you have to lose
your loved ones. As everyone in the world has to. But the more
prepared you are the better. It's like training for the Olympics.
That's what he did mentally his whole life ... and he pulled it off,
happily and in the most exemplary way you ever could."</TE>
<TE>   The album grew directly from the home-based life George Harrison
chose for his last 10 years -- especially from his close relationship
with his only child, built across what might have proved a wide
generation gap between the Liverpool bus driver's son, who used to
take his weekly bath in a tin tub in front of the living-room fire,
and the superstar's son, who grew up in a mansion.</TE>
<TE>   George showed Dhani the rudiments of guitar when he was 9: "He
never pushed me, just left me to learn or not. The main thing was he
was always around the house, playing his ukulele and smiling. I'd
come home from school and he'd be standing in the doorway playing his
uke.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd play together all the time. And listen to records. Hoagy
Carmichael, Cab Calloway, Nina Simone, Big Bill Broonzy. Bix and
Bing. Stuff you wouldn't ordinarily play to kids. I loved it. He
wasn't a big fan of contemporary music -- Massive Attack or Tricky,
who I like a lot -- but we could listen to Beck together. My friends
got into all that music too because ... my dad was very cool with
them."</TE>
<TE>   In the early '90s, George grew sick of both the music and movie
businesses. (His production company, HandMade Films, declined after a
run of successes beginning with Monty Python's "Life of Brian.") His
previous solo album was 1987's "Cloud Nine"; his last tour was with
Eric Clapton in Japan in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   He'd say things like, "In my garden I feel great, then if I go
outside the gate I wonder what the hell I'm doing there."</TE>
<TE>   But Dhani reckons his father's reclusive reputation was
misleading. George remained a prolific traveler. To him, "home" was
not only Friar Park in leafy Berkshire, but also houses in Hawaii,
Australia and Switzerland.</TE>
<TE>   "Although he did feel like a big outsider to the entertainment
industry, he wasn't hiding, he was just doing what he wanted to do --
planting trees and making music," says Dhani. "Trees replaced music
as his work. Japanese maples. We bought a couple of thousand of them.
He'd be out in the garden digging, on his hands and knees planting
every night until the light went. My mother and me too, we were a
real team."</TE>
<TE>   But the music never stopped. He strummed, he wrote songs; second
nature. Then, when he was remastering 1970's "All Things Must Pass"
in 2000, he decided he would like to put a new album together.</TE>
<TE>   "He used to say, 'Oh, you're going to have to finish all these
songs.' I'd be like, 'Well, not if you do it first -- get off your
arse and finish them!' " Dhani laughs. "We had a lot of time where we
were very close. We talked about everything. And we'd played the
songs together and discussed them so much that I had a very good idea
of what he wanted."</TE>
<TE>   George recorded until two months before he died and left tapes of
his vocals and guitar (and ukulele, of course), plus a track listing
and even a recording schedule with a November 2002 release date.
After his death, Dhani and Jeff Lynne decided to stick to the plan.</TE>
<TE>   They settled in at Lynne's Los Angeles studio to add and edit.</TE>
<TE>   "The energy and momentum was there," says Dhani. "It was like, oh
... we love him so much and we just tried to do it the way he would
want it. So some days it was, 'OK, that's exactly right! Keep that!'
Other days it was, 'Naaah, not sure. Chuck it away. Start again.
Let's get this right.' "</TE>
<TE>   After the Royal Albert Hall, London, memorial concert on Nov. 29
featuring Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Lynne, Clapton and more,
Dhani's off on vacation. Then he makes a start with a design company
he co-founded (he's a Brown University design and physics graduate).</TE>
<TE>   "The record may not change your life, but it certainly changed
mine," he concludes, relieved, his task complete. Filial duty, honor
and love all satisfied.</TE>

<HD>Scandinavian angst, Japanese-style</HD>
<DH>With Salonen stuck in traffic, assistant conductor
Shinozaki steps in to lead the Philharmonic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Swed</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Esa-Pekka Salonen did not show up in time for his Los Angeles
Philharmonic concert at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion on Friday
night. A conductor's nightmare, perhaps, to be stuck on the freeway
as the orchestra files onstage. But there was also something
curiously comforting about the realization that it can happen to
anyone. And more comforting still is the fact that the Philharmonic
keeps a spare set of white tie and tails on hand. With about five
minutes' notice, assistant conductor Yasuo Shinozaki was in them.</LD>
<LD>   Having Shinozaki lead Grieg's "Peer Gynt" Suite No. 1 actually
added an intriguing Japanese element to an all-Scandinavian program,
which also included Sibelius' Violin Concerto, with Midori as
soloist, and Nielsen's Fifth Symphony. There is a myth about
Scandinavians, Salonen quipped to the audience later (he arrived in
time to take over for the Sibelius and the Nielsen), that beneath
their imperturbable veneer is "an abyss of angst." Well, it's true,
he said, as he confessed that he had unleashed a string of Finnish
swear words while sweating in the car.</LD>
<LD>   Not to make too much of it, but Shinozaki impressed with just the
opposite: an unflappable account of the popular Grieg Suite.</LD>
<TE>   Unexpected situations like this can be exciting, the orchestra
suddenly jarred out of its routine, not knowing what to expect. From
Shinozaki's warmly eloquent way with the Suite's beginning section,
"Morning Mood," it was clear that the day was saved.</TE>
<TE>   "Unflappable" barely begins to describe Midori's authoritative
certainty. She is a violinist who, to my taste, went from being a too
blandly polished player in her teens to too compensatingly assertive
in her 20s. However, in the Sibelius Violin Concerto, Midori, now in
her 30s, got the balance just about right.</TE>
<TE>   Full-blown Sibelian angst arrived a bit later than early in his
turn-of-the-century Violin Concerto, once wickedly described as
Tchaikovsky's best. And there was no hint of irony in Midori's
straight-ahead, energetically expressive playing, or in her enormous
tone and amazing intonation. But by emphasizing the orchestra's
subtly shaded dark wind colors and undercurrents of conflicting inner
rhythms, Salonen inventively used Midori's strength to underscore
fascinating tensions in a score often thought Romantically
one-dimensional.</TE>
<TE>   Written in 1922, Nielsen's Fifth Symphony is, on the other hand,
an outright reflection of the insecurity that pervaded Europe and
Scandinavia in the aftermath of World War I. A snare drum sits before
the orchestra, and a percussionist obsessively beats a rhythmic
tattoo dozens of times during the first of the symphony's two long
movements. The snare interrupts the violas, which want nothing more
than to rock back and forth between two notes. It throttles easygoing
dialogues between woodwind players, which are a hallmark of the
Danish composer's style. The insistent drum so profoundly disturbs
the wonderful, humane cello-led melody of the movement's second half
that the whole work is thrown into chaotic disarray.</TE>
<TE>   Nielsen picks up the pieces in the second movement with a new
obsession for order, but nothing, and most notably a central fugue,
fits into place. There is a final outburst of desperate joy, as if
Nielsen were saying, I've just shown you the alternative, so you
better rejoice in life as it is. The composer was not called a Danish
Mahler for nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Fifteen years ago, Salonen made an impressive recording of this
score with the Swedish Radio Symphony, in which he demonstrated a
gift for capturing Nielsen's distinctive sound and for accentuating
his unsettled forms. But a younger Salonen had less to say about the
music than he does now. Friday's performance was a real-life journey
from bleak depression to mature appreciation of what Nielsen referred
to as the inextinguishable life force. And on this occasion, not even
L.A. traffic could quench it.</TE>

<HD>A new word order in poetry's pantheon</HD>
<DH>Harryette Mullen's innovative, experimental collection is
an unexpected National Book Award finalist.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Renee Tawa</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Her mind is whirligig-ing again, and, within the space of a few
minutes, 49-year-old Harryette Mullen has recited lines from a Lord
Byron poem and a Wynonie Harris jump blues song and a hand-clapping
chant that she remembers from her childhood in Texas. Oh, yes, and if
she is to list her wordplay influences, then Mullen, a finalist for
the National Book Award in poetry and associate professor at UCLA,
must burst into song: "Payless shoe stores so complete, keeps
customers walking on happy feet, " she sings with a laugh.</LD>
<LD>   Mullen's latest poetry collection, "Sleeping With the Dictionary"
(UC Press), was inspired by the influences that pinball through her
consciousness, from the 20-year-old shoe-store jingle to the Crenshaw
neighborhood of Los Angeles to an African American courtship ritual
exchange. Her poems fool with anagrams -- words made by rearranging
letters such as "tan" and "ant" -- and echoing, or riffs on words
that sound alike: "Ocean Potion odd jobs Oingo Boingo okey-dokey old
gold/googa-booga/Only the Lonely oodles of noodles ... " she writes
in "Jinglejangle."</LD>
<TE>   Last month, "Sleeping With the Dictionary" and four other books
were named as finalists in the National Book Awards' poetry category,
in which 134 titles had been submitted. The winning poet, along with
the winners in the competition's three other writing categories, will
be announced Wednesday in New York. Other poetry finalists are Sharon
Olds, Alberto Rios, Ruth Stone and Ellen Bryant Voigt, a stellar
group in which Mullen never expected to be included.</TE>
<TE>   "Not the way I write, no," said Mullen, who almost didn't return
the call about her nomination because she thought organizers were
going to ask her to be a judge. "Once I decided to go down the
so-called experimental, innovative path, you don't expect to win
those kinds of awards."</TE>
<TE>   Previous winners have included more traditional or well-known
poets such as Robert Penn Warren, Stanley Kunitz and Adrienne Rich.
"Looking through the list of winners," said UC Press poetry editor
Laura Cerruti, "yes, they often pick poets who are very established,
or [who have] major books of selected works or collected works."</TE>
<TE>   But even the nomination will spin Mullen into a new light, she
said. "I think general readers don't read a lot of the more
experimental poetry.... This kind of award does pull people in. It
picks a poet and says this is someone you should be reading."</TE>
<TE>   Mullen's nomination sends a message, said poet Toi Derricotte, a
past judge in the National Book Award's poetry division. "I think the
National Book Awards are trying consciously to make this a statement
about the vitality in poetry today.... Harryette is bringing a new
kind of voice."</TE>
<TE>   Derricotte is a co-founder of Cave Canem, an East Coast-based
nonprofit organization that cultivates new voices in African American
poetry. Mullen is a Cave Canem faculty member. "Everyone is feeling
that this is absolutely the right thing and, at the same time, how
validating it is to us to have someone from Cave Canem recognized,"
Derricotte said. "It has something to do with all of us, and we're
proud and happy."</TE>
<TE>   In her English classes at UCLA, Mullen talks about the days when
she used to drive hundreds of miles to read for six people, including
the organizer, the days when publishers paid her with a box of her
own poetry books.</TE>
<TE>   Mullen's work had not attracted widespread acclaim until "Sleeping
With the Dictionary," her first hardcover book, was published earlier
this year. In a starred review, Publishers Weekly said, "this
volume's visibility and accessibility should make it a breakthrough.
Look for some prize nominations." The Christian Science Monitor's
review noted: "This is avant-garde territory."</TE>
<TE>   "Sleeping With the Dictionary," Mullen's fifth volume of poetry,
also is her most experimental (Her previous book, "Muse &amp; Drudge,"
was written in mostly rhymed quatrains.) The new book reflects the
kind of playful word transformation associated with Lewis Carroll's
"Jabberwocky" and the French-based literary experimentalists Oulipo,
an international group of writers and mathematicians who apply
innovative literary devices -- such as dictionary games -- to poetry,
novels and other forms of creative writing. Mullen first began
listening to Oulipian poets as a graduate student at UC Santa Cruz,
on forays into San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Growing up in Fort Worth, Mullen discovered wordplay on the
playground, where second-grade boys and girls recited flirtatious
exchanges: "What's cookin' good looking?" "Ain't nothin' cookin' but
the beans in the pot, and they wouldn't be if the water wasn't hot."
She was raised by a single mother, who was a schoolteacher, and other
relatives including her grandfather, a Baptist minister.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember the bookcase with the glass front, my grandfather's
books. I remember sitting on his knee, and he's reading to me from
Mother Goose, and I can still picture the cow jumping over the moon,
and the crooked man with the crooked stick.... All of that is still
there," she said, tapping her forehead.</TE>
<TE>   These days, Mullen, who is divorced and lives in West Los Angeles,
still falls asleep on some nights with her American Heritage
Dictionary poking her in the side like a muse -- a situation that
partly inspired the title of her book -- and she's still trying to
keep up with the work of new poets. She is taken aback and distracted
by her newfound attention, by the upcoming black-tie awards dinner in
New York.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent afternoon, in her seminar on contemporary African
American poets, Mullen discussed the work of emerging poet Honoree
Fanonne Jeffers, whose first collection, "The Gospel of Barbecue," is
about as thick as a slice of bread.</TE>
<TE>   A student who had volunteered to give a presentation on Jeffers
explained that she had sent the Oklahoma poet an e-mail. Jeffers
responded in detail, explaining the motivations behind her work,
including her heritage as the great-great-granddaughter of slaves.</TE>
<TE>   Mullen's face brightened. "We want to hear it all," she said.</TE>

<HD>Snappy and sassy, 'One on One' finds ratings success the
quip way</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Sachs</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It looks as if the father-and-daughter sitcom "One on One" has come
of age in this, just its second season on UPN. The show is among the
network's top ratings-grabbers each week, and last month, one episode
racked up UPN's highest numbers for the 8:30 p.m. Monday time slot in
six years.</LD>
<LD>   So what's the secret ingredient? In a word, it's sassiness. The
dialogue, the attitudes, the relationships, it's all sassy squared.
Everyone's a hipster-quipster here, and even when the lines pack
something less than a punch, the actors keep flinging 'em just the
same.</LD>
<LD>   In tonight's show, Breanna (Kyla Pratt) turns 16, but the tone is
anything but sweet. She wants a car as her gift, but because of the
limited budget of her single dad, Flex (Flex Alexander), they must
take their chances at Big Sal's discount lot, where Flex has an old
pal he thinks he can squeeze for a good deal.</LD>
<TE>   But Breanna and Flex are the ones who lose out when (as sitcom
formula demands) the car breaks down the very next day. Flex returns
to the lot and demands satisfaction from his buddy Duane (Kelly
Perine), but he runs into a stone wall.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't seen a travesty like this since Mariah Carey in
'Glitter,' " says a disgusted Flex.</TE>
<TE>   Realizing that only one person could possibly possess the wisdom
and skill to resolve the heated dispute -- syndicated TV's legal
heavyweight Judge Joe Brown, in a fun guest shot -- the warring
parties adjourn to his courtroom to have it out once and for all.</TE>
<TE>   Directed by Brian Roberts from a script by Arthur Harris,
tonight's snappy birthday episode shows a series doing what it does
best. And at UPN, it takes a back seat to no other show in that
regard.</TE>

<HD>Air Bag Lawsuits Blame Nissan for Eye Injuries</HD>
<DH>Safety groups, alleged victims say the passenger-side bags
in certain Altimas have caused blindness in minor crashes. The
automaker denies a defect.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Myron Levin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ali Warsome is blind. This is how it happened:</LD>
<LD>   In April, he was riding in a car that hit a divider on a roadway
in Washington, D.C. It wasn't much of a wreck; the '94 Nissan Altima
didn't even need a tow.</LD>
<LD>   But the air bag struck his face with such force that Warsome's
battered left eye had to be removed. Surgeons were unable to restore
the vision in his right eye because "the retina was completely
shredded," according to his medical records.</LD>
<TE>   "I cannot see the sky anymore," said Warsome, 74, a Somali
immigrant, speaking through an interpreter. "I cannot cook, I cannot
walk, I cannot help my grandchildren.... I don't know what to do."</TE>
<TE>   To do their job properly, air bags must inflate at lightning
speed, so there always is a chance they can cause an injury. But
safety groups and alleged victims say the passenger-side air bags in
certain Altimas -- the 1994 and early '95 models -- can inflict a
terrible sort of damage.</TE>
<TE>   They say the air bags are responsible for at least 40 cases of
severe eye injury, including permanent blindness in one or both eyes
in some instances. Often, these injuries to passengers have occurred
in crashes so minor that the drivers of the cars were unharmed.</TE>
<TE>   Nissan staunchly denies that the air bags are defective, saying
the frequency and severity of eye injuries from them are similar to
those in other cars. "We know it's a high-quality bag ... and
performs well in the field," said Scott Vazin, a spokesman for
Torrance-based Nissan North America Inc.</TE>
<TE>   But consumer groups are pressing the matter hard. "People should
not lose their vision because a driver hits a curb or has a
fender-bender," said Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen,
which has demanded a recall.</TE>
<TE>   Added Clarence Ditlow, who heads the Center for Auto Safety, a
consumer group based in Washington: "I've never seen a defect like
this, which has such a singular injury mode -- which is physically
blinding someone."</TE>
<TE>   The air bags are the focus of a long-running investigation by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which could demand a
recall of nearly 200,000 cars if it finds they are defective.</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence Baron, a Portland, Ore., lawyer who has sued Nissan on
behalf of more than a dozen alleged victims, contends that videos
obtained from Nissan during legal discovery reveal the unusual danger
the air bags pose.</TE>
<TE>   Baron said that unlike most air bags that unfold laterally in a
pillow-like shape, the Altima air bags in question deploy rearward
like a fist into the passenger area. He and others have compared the
effect to that of a boxing glove thudding into a passenger's face at
close to 160 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Nissan switched to a new air bag design midway through the '95
model year. Consumer groups say this was a quiet decision to scrap an
air bag the company knew was unsafe.</TE>
<TE>   But Bob Yakushi, Nissan's senior manager of auto safety
engineering, said the design change had long been in the works and
was not prompted by safety concerns. As for the boxing-glove
comparison, Yakushi said the air bag "deployment pattern" in the
early models is similar to that in some other vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't just look at shape [of the air bag] and come to the
conclusion that that's the cause of the injury," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Clouding the debate is the lack of thorough, widely accepted data
on rates of air bag-related injuries in various models of cars and
trucks. However, information gathered by NHTSA in the investigation
does suggest that Altimas are different.</TE>
<TE>   The agency asked Nissan and 12 other manufacturers to disclose the
number of reports of eye or facial injuries from passenger-side air
bags. There were 75 such reports involving the nearly 249,000 Altimas
produced in '94 and early '95. There were 57 complaints for about 3.5
million vehicles produced by other manufacturers. For each 100,000
vehicles, there were 30 reports of Altima injuries and 1.5 for the
other vehicles -- a ratio of 20 to 1.</TE>
<TE>   But in a case of dueling statistics, Nissan has cited a New York
state database that it says shows the Altima with an above-average
record of avoiding air bag injuries to the face and eyes. Opponents
contend that the New York data are too vague and incomplete to allow
useful comparisons.</TE>
<TE>   NHTSA began investigating the air bags in March 2001. The length
of the probe may be due to the complexity of the case and the
agency's big workload. But impatient safety advocates charge that the
case also has been prolonged by the role of former agency officials
in defending the air bags.</TE>
<TE>   Erika Z. Jones, NHTSA's top lawyer from 1985 to '89, has
represented Nissan in the defect probe. Paul Jackson Rice, who
followed Jones as NHTSA chief counsel, has weighed in on behalf of
the air bag supplier, Takata-Gerico Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Said Ditlow of the Center for Auto Safety: "I have never seen an
investigation where you have two former chief counsels working to
block a recall."</TE>
<TE>   Jones said in an interview Friday that there are "strict rules
governing the conduct of former government employees working on
matters at their former agencies, and I have always complied with the
letter and spirit of those rules." Moreover, she said, officials at
NHTSA "are neutral and objective and are unlikely to be unduly
influenced by the fact of my participation."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the Center for Auto Safety filed a lawsuit against
NHTSA, accusing it of violating the federal Freedom of Information
Act. According to the lawsuit, the agency has failed to respond to
repeated requests for details of a private meeting this June between
Jones and other Nissan representatives and NHTSA staff.</TE>
<TE>   NHTSA officials have declined to discuss the investigation, and
spokesman Tim Hurd said Friday that the agency had not seen the
lawsuit and could not comment. Jones also declined to comment on the
suit.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, air bags have saved 9,325 lives, according to a
NHTSA estimate. But 215 people have been killed since 1990 as a
result of air bags inflating in low-severity frontal crashes. Most
were children or small adults, and most were riding without seat
belts -- so their heads or chests were far forward as the air bag
began to inflate.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a wonderful technology, but as with any sophisticated
technology -- particularly one that introduces energy into a vehicle
-- you have to be very careful about how you balance the protective
benefits against the potential to harm people," said Susan Ferguson,
vice president for research at the Insurance Institute for Highway
Safety.</TE>
<TE>   Although the number of air bags continues to grow, casualty
figures have dropped sharply. There were 103 air bag fatalities in
1997-98, but only eight last year. Experts credit design changes in
1998 and later models that made air bags inflate with less force.
Another factor has been the success of educational efforts aimed at
keeping children out of front passenger seats.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, more than 1.2 million vehicles have been recalled this
year because of air bag-related defects -- typically involving bags
that inflate when they shouldn't or don't inflate when they should.
NHTSA is involved in several other air bag investigations, in
addition to the Nissan probe, involving various makes and models.</TE>
<TE>   As for Nissan, it has been sued by at least 30 people claiming
severe eye injuries from the Altima air bag. The company is believed
to have settled most of the cases but won't say how many.</TE>
<TE>   Among those settling was Norma Brainerd, the victim of an air bag
injury in a low-speed crash of an Altima in December 1995.</TE>
<TE>   She was en route to the Oregon coast when the '94 Altima in which
she was riding struck the curb on a highway overlook. Brainerd, who
was wearing her seat belt, said she recalled intense pressure on her
face and everything going black.</TE>
<TE>   The air bag broke Brainerd's nose. For several days, she was
completely blind. Brainerd was a single mother with two young
children, and in addition to the physical pain was the terror of
wondering how she would make a living.</TE>
<TE>   Although her condition improved over time, she remains legally
blind in her left eye, has impaired vision in the right and still
suffers severe headaches.</TE>
<TE>   Brainerd said in an interview that although her lawsuit was
settled, "to me, it's a public awareness issue at this point.... If
I'm supposed to be here for a purpose, making a difference, I kind of
want to be able to do that."</TE>
<TE>   "I just hate that it's still out there," she said of the Altima
air bag. "That's the part that just makes me very angry."</TE>
<TE>   The lights went out for Ali Warsome on April 28 on a trip from his
home in Falls Church, Va., to Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The driver, one of Warsome's sons, was attempting a sudden lane
change when his Altima struck the barrier. The air bag inflated, and
Warsome has lived in darkness ever since.</TE>
<TE>   In June, his lawyers filed a lawsuit in federal court in
Washington accusing Nissan of "outrageous indifference" to the risk
posed by the air bags. "No other vehicle has a track record of
blinding so many passengers due to a deployment of air bags," the
lawsuit stated.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than recall the vehicles, Nissan has sought to hide the
dangers, "hoping that as time passes and the vehicles come off the
roads, the blinding of innocent victims will silently go away," the
complaint said. "Nissan's plan to deal with these incidents is to
settle every claim made against it."</TE>
<TE>   In its answer to the lawsuit, Nissan denied wrongdoing and said it
was not responsible for the injury.</TE>
<TE>   Abdirizak Kulmie, one of Warsome's sons, said his father had been
an extremely active man who enjoyed regular meetings with other
Somali emigres at a local coffeehouse. Kulmie, who said he had polio
as a child, recalled how he relied on his father's help to steady him
when he walked.</TE>
<TE>   Now, he said, Warsome is a shut-in who mopes about the house.
Kulmie remembered the day of his father's unsuccessful surgery, a
last-ditch attempt to restore his vision. Warsome asked if he would
ever see again. "But the doctor said, 'There's no hope,' " Kulmie
recounted.</TE>
<TE>   "My father ... was crying, and I was crying," Kulmie said.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried to calm down my father. I told my father I'm handicapped
too."</TE>

<HD>Asia Global Crossing Files for Bankruptcy</HD>
<DH>The company's reorganization plan will put a major crimp in
ailing Global Crossing's available cash.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James S. Granelli and Elizabeth Douglass</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Asia Global Crossing Ltd., a key asset of ailing Global Crossing
Ltd., filed a Chapter 11 petition itself Sunday to reorganize its
debt and sell its assets to a new venture formed by a Chinese
telecommunications company.</LD>
<LD>   The long-expected petition, filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New
York, would turn over control of 24,200 miles of a sophisticated
underwater high-speed, fiber-optic network to Asia Netcom, created by
government-owned China Netcom Communications Group Corp., for $120
million in cash.</LD>
<LD>   Joining in Asia Netcom are venture firms Newbridge Capital and
Softbank Corp.'s Softbank Asia Infrastructure Fund. Asia Netcom also
would have a $150-million bank line of credit under the deal.</LD>
<TE>   Asia Global listed $2.6 billion in debt and $2.3 billion in
assets, both as of Dec. 31.</TE>
<TE>   The deal, if approved by the court, would represent the first
overseas investment by a Chinese telecom firm and one of the few
investments by any government-run enterprise. Asia Global, based in
Bermuda, owns or operates lines connecting eight Asian countries and
the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Asia Global was operated mainly out of Los Angeles, but since
Global Crossing's bankruptcy filing in January, it has increasingly
moved operations to Hong Kong. With few assets left in the U.S., Asia
Global doesn't expect to need any federal regulatory approval for the
deal. Of Asia Global's 425 employees, 17 are based in Los Angeles and
will stay through the transition, which the company expects to
complete by the end of March.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been able to achieve our desired objective of ensuring
our company's ongoing--and uninterrupted--operations in the future,
without compromising customer service," said John M. "Jack" Scanlon,
Asia Global's chief executive. "Once approved, this transaction will
mark the successful completion of the restructuring process we began
in early 2002."</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's filing also is expected to sever Global Crossing's 59%
stake that it has maintained in Asia Global since the unit's public
offering two years ago. And it will put a major crimp in Global
Crossing's available cash, which it needs to fund operations until it
can emerge from bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Asia Global's $252 million of cash on hand amounts to about half
of the parent company's total $557 million in cash at the end of
September. Global Crossing has been running through about $60 million
of its cash a month, according to operating statements it files with
the Bankruptcy Court.</TE>
<TE>   Also losing big chunks of Asia Global are Microsoft Corp. and the
investment arm of Softbank, each of which holds a nearly 15% in the
company. Asia Global's stock, traded over the counter, closed
unchanged at 5 cents a share Friday. It has lost 96% of its value
this year.</TE>
<TE>   Relations between Global Crossing and Asia Global have grown
increasingly tense since late last year, when the parent company
hired the unit's chief executive and then refused to fund a promised
$400 million in lines of credit for Asia Global.</TE>
<TE>   Early this year, Asia Global embarked on a restructuring plan to
cut costs and find new investors. It settled with two vendors over
$266 million in overdue bills, though terms remained secret. It also
raised $120 million in April by selling its share of three joint
ventures to partner Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., giving the Hong Kong
conglomerate a local phone carrier, an Asian data center and
e-commerce operator ESD Services.</TE>
<TE>   Hutchison, run by Hong Kong's wealthiest billionaire, Li Ka-shing,
is one of two Asian firms that is awaiting federal and court approval
to bring Global Crossing out of bankruptcy. Hutchison and Singapore
Technologies Telemedia jointly bid $250 million for Global Crossing,
whose bankruptcy filing in January was the nation's fifth largest.</TE>
<TE>   In both deals, analysts say, Hutchison-STT and China Netcom are
getting stellar assets for a pittance. And with an abundance of
capacity on their systems, they said, the companies can easily swap
space to complete worldwide networks.</TE>
<TE>   "Global Crossing spent billions to build the network, and all
Hutch has to do is operate it," said analyst Jay Pultz at research
firm Gartner Inc. "Basically, it's a free network for Hutchison."</TE>
<TE>   In picking up Asia Global, China Netcom will get a 12,120-mile
network of undersea cables that link the largest business centers in
Asia. A troubled partnership, Pacific Crossing Ltd., operates two
lines that connect Japan to the U.S. But Pacific Crossing also is in
bankruptcy, and Asia Global's stake probably will be wiped out.
However, both Asia Global and Global Crossing could continue to use
the lines under capacity agreements with new owners.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement issued late Sunday, Global Crossing said that its
"customers will not experience any changes in their service."</TE>
<TE>   Asia Global has been focusing on selling communications and data
services to customers in and around Asia. The company said about 80%
of the region's fiber-optic network traffic travels among Asian
nations.</TE>
<TE>   The Asia Global-China Netcom deal comes at a time when Chinese
political leaders, working to stoke the country's economy, are trying
to promote Chinese companies and create a degree of competition in
one of the world's largest markets for telecom services.</TE>
<TE>   "China is trying to develop companies within the country and
[previously] hasn't shown any great inclination toward overseas
investments," said industry watcher David Webb, editor of
Webb-site.com, an Asian telecom site.</TE>
<TE>   Asia Global operates the most modern and extensive private network
in Asia. Its lines carry voice and data traffic from California to
Japan, China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Malaysia, the
Philippines and Singapore. A major goal of the intra-Asia links,
completed in August, is to provide more direct routes for voice and
data, which in the past traveled first to the U.S. before heading
back to Asia.</TE>
<TE>   The operation is part of the worldwide network put together for
more than $10 billion by Global Crossing under Los Angeles financier
Gary Winnick.</TE>
<TE>   The highflying telecom sector in the late 1990s made top
executives wealthy beyond expectations. Winnick cashed in more than
$575 million worth of Global Crossing stock before the industry began
sinking last year.</TE>
<TE>   As network builders, Global Crossing and Asia Global began
transforming themselves into telecom service providers as demand was
slowing and prices were plummeting. The subsidiary never accounted
for much of the total revenue of the consolidated operation -- a mere
6% in September -- but it has been a big contributor to Global
Crossing's losses, making up 22% of the parent's $138-million loss in
September.</TE>
<TE>   Pultz and others believe that Asia Global is "the key strategic
asset" of Global Crossing. They figure that with a worldwide glut of
capacity, falling prices and a stagnant industry, Asia Global has
less competition and can charge customers more.</TE>
<TE>   Some, however, doubt that Asia Global has much to offer the new
Global Crossing under Hutchison-STT.</TE>
<TE>   Companies bidding for Global Crossing last summer generally wrote
off the stake in Asia Global, figuring the subsidiary would
eventually go bankrupt to fix its own financial problems.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, it's now cheaper to lease capacity than own and operate a
long-haul carrier, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "Asia completes the picture for Global Crossing, but Global
doesn't need it this year or next," said analyst Brownlee Thomas at
Giga Information Group Inc. in Cambridge, Mass.</TE>
<TE>   Hutchinson would have been a likely suitor for Asia Global. But
Hutchison's owner Li is one of China's biggest private investors and
close to the country's governing elite. Experts figure it was
unlikely he would bid against a company controlled by the Chinese
government.</TE>
<TE>   "He's already cut his deal with the Chinese government," Thomas
said. "Nobody's walking away from money. If the key to Asia is China,
Li's trading for access to other opportunities."</TE>
<TE>   More important, she noted, Global Crossing's main revenue stems
from its North America and Europe lines, not the new Asia lines.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have said Asia Global is a key element, but given the
economic situation, with the recovery considerably slower than
expected and war with Iraq making progress even slower, the business
for Global Crossing is North America and Europe," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But it's unclear what the effect will be on the industry from a
price hike imposed by the Chinese government last week. Ignoring the
world's telecom problems, China staggered the industry by raising the
price for access to China's telephone customers from 2 cents a minute
to 17 cents a minute. Webb, for one, doesn't believe that China can
maintain such a huge increase.</TE>
<TE>   In May, the Chinese government split up the monopoly held by China
Telecom Corp., the national phone company. It created China Netcom to
cover 10 provinces and gave China Telecom the remaining 20 provinces.</TE>

<HD>CalPERS to Vote on Offshore Status Plan</HD>
<DH>State pension fund will decide whether to ask firms in
which it owns stakes to incorporate in the U.S., to increase
accountability.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California Public Employees' Retirement System, the largest U.S.
public pension fund, is expected to vote today on whether to ask
companies it owns stakes in to give up their offshore addresses.</LD>
<LD>   CalPERS' investment committee will decide whether to ask McDermott
International Inc., Tyco International Inc. and Ingersoll-Rand Co. to
become U.S.-based companies, the pension fund said in a posting on
its Internet site.</LD>
<LD>   The fund, with $143 billion in assets on June 30, said moving the
companies' country of incorporation to the U.S. would help
shareholders hold executives accountable for their actions. Public
scrutiny of offshore operations increased after accounting scandals
at companies such as WorldCom Inc., and after Tyco's former chief
executives was charged with fraud.</LD>
<TE>   "Events over the past 12 months demonstrate how crucial it is
that, in the event of legal violations by officers or directors,
shareholders have the ability to pursue legal recourse," CalPERS
staff wrote in the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Former Tyco Chief Executive L. Dennis Kozlowski and former Chief
Financial Officer Mark Swartz have been charged under a New York
indictment of stealing from Tyco $170 million in unauthorized
compensation and $430 million through stock fraud. Both pleaded not
guilty.</TE>
<TE>   The American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees
Pension Plan asked CalPERS to co-sponsor resolutions asking the
companies to reincorporate in the United States. CalPERS' opposition
to a plan by tool maker Stanley Works to change its legal address to
Bermuda prompted the company to drop the move.</TE>
<TE>   Companies may avoid some U.S. taxes by incorporating elsewhere.
Ingersoll-Rand and Tyco are incorporated in Bermuda, while McDermott
is in Panama.</TE>
<TE>   About 20 companies have moved their addresses to tax havens while
keeping U.S. operations, U.S. Assistant Treasury Secretary Pamela
Olson told a congressional panel last month.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Ingersoll-Rand, McDermott and Tyco didn't return
telephone voice-mail messages left after work hours seeking comment
on CalPERS' proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Colleen Beamish, a spokeswoman for California Treasurer Phil
Angelides, also didn't return a telephone call to her office.
Angelides is a member of CalPERS' board.</TE>

<HD>Personal Devices Touted at Comdex</HD>
<DH>Gates showcases a new software platform with wireless
connectivity that he hopes will help end the tech slump.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Joseph Menn</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates kicked off the annual Comdex
computer show Sunday with a prediction that the same high-volume,
low-cost economics that put a PC in most U.S. homes will soon give
consumers new varieties of inexpensive and useful gadgets.</LD>
<LD>   In a keynote speech dedicated to debunking gloomy expectations for
the beleaguered technology industry, Gates demonstrated a new
category of Microsoft software for what he called "smart personal
object technology," or SPOT.</LD>
<LD>   The software platform can be used for applications that provide
information to timepieces, pens and key chains, Microsoft said. Gates
showed a travel clock that connects wirelessly to the Internet,
returning with traffic updates, weather reports and other data
relevant to where the traveler has landed.</LD>
<TE>   Microsoft said the software had been under development for two
years and that the clock will be available sometime in the next year
from an unnamed manufacturer. The programs don't rely on the global
positioning system, so presumably they base location information on
where the Internet connection is made.</TE>
<TE>   "People are dramatically underestimating all the innovation going
on in our industry, all the great products that are on the way, and
the positive contribution that technology is making to our economy,"
Gates said. "New devices and technologies will help bring about the
next computing revolution: the shift from personal computers to truly
personal computing that's available anywhere people need it."</TE>
<TE>   Previous Internet-connected watches, refrigerators and the like,
touted by the software arms of Hewlett-Packard Co., Sun Microsystems
Inc. and others, haven't taken the world by storm, and some of Gates'
previous Comdex predictions have yet to appear in the real world.</TE>
<TE>   One major hurdle for SPOT is that the percentage of people within
range of a wireless connection to the Net is as low as 7%. SPOT
products "assume a wireless connection, and they assume a low-cost
chip set," a Microsoft official said. The chips are from National
Semiconductor Corp., which focuses on specialty, low-cost silicon
instead of the more powerful, multipurpose chips from Intel Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Even Web-enabled "smart phones," which start with everyone
connected to a network, are years behind where industry mavens
thought they would be, giving rise to some skepticism about the
future of smart pens and smart toasters.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the speech showed Microsoft's commitment to a new area
beyond operating systems for personal computers, the larger computer
servers that control functions on multiple machines, and such
hand-held devices as the Pocket PC, which runs a smaller version of
Windows. The SPOT operating system is a new architecture and not
based on Windows at all, making it the first new system from
Microsoft in a decade.</TE>
<TE>   Gates used the demonstration to argue that the $5 billion
Microsoft spends yearly on research and development, and lesser
amounts spent by its less successful rivals, will pull the industry
out of its slump. The remarks had special resonance at Comdex in Las
Vegas, where attendance was expected to be down dramatically for the
second year in a row.</TE>

<HD>A Rising Voice for Investors at SEC</HD>
<DH>Chairman Harvey Pitt's exit has enhanced the stature of
reform- minded Commissioner Harvey Goldschmid.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Walter Hamilton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>On the morning of a critical Securities and Exchange Commission vote
late last month, Commissioner Harvey Goldschmid got a phone call from
David Ruder, who had run the agency in the late 1980s.</LD>
<LD>   The commission was bitterly split on a plan to name William H.
Webster as the chairman of the nation's new accounting oversight
board, and Ruder implored Goldschmid not to oppose the candidate
publicly nor to voice grievances about the behind-the-scenes
selection process.</LD>
<LD>   Goldschmid politely refused, Ruder said. And in a passionate
speech at the meeting, Goldschmid criticized Webster's selection and
indicated that SEC Chairman Harvey L. Pitt had abruptly withdrawn
support for a competing candidate who was expected to take a much
tougher approach to accounting reform.</LD>
<TE>   "I knew this was a step some people would object to, and only a
compelling circumstance of this type would force me to come forward,"
Goldschmid said in an interview. "I consider it one of the least
favorable days of my life, though I didn't have a second of
reservation. In my view, I did the right thing."</TE>
<TE>   With that speech, both supporters and detractors say, Goldschmid
let it be known that he intended to play a forceful role at the SEC,
the chief U.S. financial regulator.</TE>
<TE>   And with Pitt's resignation from the SEC on Nov. 5, Goldschmid's
stature was further enhanced among those who believed Pitt was
following an agenda that undermined the agency's image.</TE>
<TE>   Goldschmid, 62, is a Columbia University law professor and a
former SEC general counsel. President Bush appointed him in April as
one of two Democrats on the five-member commission, and the Senate
confirmed him in July.</TE>
<TE>   As a top aide to former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt in the late
1990s, Goldschmid helped craft a host of pro-investor initiatives.
Supporters say he'll be a powerful voice for investor interests at
the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   "Investors are extremely lucky to have him at the commission at
this point in time," said Nancy Smith, director of
RestoreTheTrust.com, an advocacy group for shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pivotal Player</TE>
<TE>   As SEC general counsel in 1998 and 1999, Goldschmid was a driving
force behind several of Levitt's reform measures, including an
attempt to limit accountants from doing consulting work for companies
they're auditing -- a proposal the accounting industry beat back.</TE>
<TE>   Goldschmid also wrote Regulation FD, which prohibits companies
from giving key information to favored investors without also
releasing it to the general public.</TE>
<TE>   And he has been a vocal opponent of a 1995 law intended to limit
lawsuits by aggrieved investors against companies. As SEC general
counsel, he argued two federal appellate court cases to ensure that
investors still could bring suits on charges of recklessness in
addition to intentional fraud.</TE>
<TE>   But Goldschmid's burgeoning profile is stirring anxiety among
political opponents who worry that he will press an activist agenda
even to the point of fomenting dissension at the normally collegial
SEC if he doesn't get his way.</TE>
<TE>   "He's very ambitious," said Laura Unger, a former Republican
commissioner. "I get the feeling he is someone who thinks 'Regulation
at any cost.' "</TE>
<TE>   Goldschmid dismisses such concerns. "Individual commissioners
can't have agendas, and I don't think of myself as aggressive," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   What is certain is that Goldschmid will be a pivotal player in
shaping the SEC and the financial markets at a time when both are at
a crossroads.</TE>
<TE>   Among the key decisions he and his colleagues will make is the
choice of a replacement for Webster, who resigned last week following
controversy over his work as a director for a small company that has
been sued by shareholders alleging fraud.</TE>
<TE>   The commission also will face major decisions in implementing the
landmark corporate and accounting reform law signed by Bush in the
summer. The law gives the SEC wide latitude in translating Congress'
intent, and Goldschmid is expected to press for a tough
interpretation of the new regulations.</TE>
<TE>   The commission also must sign off on a myriad of enforcement cases
against alleged corporate wrongdoers. Those cases include a proposed
settlement with Wall Street brokerages over alleged tainted advice by
their stock analysts during the bull market.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond any legal settlements with brokerages, Goldschmid suggested
that he is likely to press for hard-hitting industrywide rules
governing analysts' conduct.</TE>
<TE>   "The basic goal would be to increase the honesty, accuracy and
credibility of analysts," he said, though he declined to be more
specific about his plans.</TE>
<TE>   On some issues, Goldschmid may be unable to cast a vote: While at
Columbia, he also worked as a part-time attorney at Weil, Gotshal &amp;
Manges, a New York law firm, where he did work for the National Assn.
of Securities Dealers and the Nasdaq Stock Market as well as for
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and Lehman Bros. At the SEC, he has recused
himself for one year on matters involving all of them, he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pitt's Counterweight</TE>
<TE>   Goldschmid said he is motivated by the need to restore public
faith in financial markets, which has been shaken by the pandemic of
corporate misconduct, and the need to restore faith in the
commission, whose image has been tarnished by the Webster furor,
Pitt's resignation and other controversies.</TE>
<TE>   In person, Goldschmid is soft-spoken and low-key. Born in a
rough-and-tumble section of the Bronx, the lifelong New Yorker is a
married father with three sons, two of whom have followed his path by
enrolling at Columbia law school.</TE>
<TE>   Though well-known in legal circles, Goldschmid has only come into
wide public view since he was named an SEC commissioner, where he
immediately was seen by some as a counterweight to the Republican
Pitt.</TE>
<TE>   Observers often framed issues in terms of the positions staked out
by the "two Harveys."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout his 15-month tenure, Pitt -- who in private law
practice in the 1980s and '90s served a long list of Wall Street
clients -- was dogged by criticism that he favored the accounting and
securities industries over investors. Pitt forcefully rejected those
allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Despite their philosophical differences, Pitt and Goldschmid had
not publicly clashed until the fight over Webster's appointment.</TE>
<TE>   According to Goldschmid and others, Pitt initially pledged to
support John Biggs, a New York pension fund executive. Then suddenly
he changed course.</TE>
<TE>   Critics said Pitt's reversal came after the accounting industry
and congressional Republicans grew worried that Biggs would push for
strong reforms. Pitt has disputed that claim, saying Biggs never was
offered the chairmanship.</TE>
<TE>   When the divide on the issue became clear, Goldschmid asked that
the SEC's vote on the accounting board's members be held in a public
meeting rather than in the private session that was planned. It was
an unusual step, because the commission has historically sought to
prevent internal disputes from flaring into the open.</TE>
<TE>   "This was the most important thing we would be doing," Goldschmid
said. "We just couldn't have a vote of this magnitude and do it in
the shadows."</TE>
<TE>   A week after the partisan 3-2 vote approving Webster -- with Pitt
joined by fellow Republican commissioners Paul Atkins and Cynthia
Glassman and Goldschmid joined by fellow Democrat Roel Campos --
damaging information surfaced. It was revealed that in 2001, Webster
had served as head of the board audit committee at U.S. Technologies
Inc., which had fired its accounting firm shortly after questions
were raised about the company's internal financial controls.</TE>
<TE>   Webster said he had told Pitt about the controversies involving
the company, according to published reports. But Pitt did not inform
Goldschmid nor the other SEC commissioners before the vote on
Webster.</TE>
<TE>   The revelations sparked public outrage, resulting first in Pitt's
resignation, then Webster's.</TE>
<TE>   Goldschmid declined to comment further on either man. At the Oct.
25 meeting, even as he argued against Webster's nomination,
Goldschmid praised the former federal judge's integrity. But he said
Biggs' financial background made him a superior choice.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Temperament Question</TE>
<TE>   Goldschmid's future effectiveness at the SEC may rest on two
factors, many observers believe: the influence he can muster among
the three other current commissioners and the regulatory philosophy
of whomever Bush chooses to replace Pitt as chairman.</TE>
<TE>   "If you bring in an ideologue on the other side of table, I don't
see Goldschmid as anything other than one of two voices on the losing
side," said Lynn Turner, a Goldschmid ally and former SEC chief
accountant.</TE>
<TE>   Critics worry how Goldschmid would react if that happens.</TE>
<TE>   "I fret that his actions at the meeting at which he so vocally
disagreed with Chairman Pitt indicate that he has a personality that
would not accept defeat easily," said Ruder, who now is a law
professor at Northwestern University. "If he wants to publicly
disagree, he should be articulate and reasoned, rather than blowing
it up into a big issue. I don't know whether he will or not."</TE>
<TE>   Goldschmid rejects those concerns. He stressed that he likes the
other commissioners and that he expects they will make decisions
jointly.</TE>
<TE>   He spoke up about Webster's selection because there was a
"critical principle" involved, Goldschmid said.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why you come to Washington, and what the public would
expect of you," he said.</TE>

<HD>Homestore Execs Key to Lawsuit</HD>
<DH>Amended class action by shareholders reflects trio's
version of alleged conspiracy with AOL and other firms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. Scott Reckard</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The former Homestore Inc. executives who have linked AOL Time Warner
Inc. to a massive accounting fraud were a study in stress last month
while waiting to plead guilty in Los Angeles federal court.</LD>
<LD>   John M. Giesecke Jr. sat with his face reddened, his jaw clenched.
Giesecke's protege, Joseph J. Shew, was ashen-faced and subdued.</LD>
<LD>   The two, highly regarded for their accounting knowledge, had built
tandem careers since the 1980s, working side by side in ever more
responsible roles.</LD>
<TE>   From the accounting firm now known as PricewaterhouseCoopers, they
moved to top jobs in Walt Disney Co.'s controller's office, then to
Westlake Village-based Homestore, the Internet's No. 1 real estate
site.</TE>
<TE>   But when U.S. District Judge Percy Anderson accepted their guilty
pleas to fraud and conspiracy charges, Shew and Giesecke took on new
roles as government witnesses with the potential to send their former
bosses and business partners to prison; provide fresh evidence of
wrongdoing by media giant AOL; and perhaps help recover more than $1
billion that shareholders lost when Homestore revealed that its
founding executive team had fabricated nearly $200 million in
revenue.</TE>
<TE>   The former executives are in this position because of a deal
between defense attorneys and federal officials interviewing
Giesecke, Shew and John DeSimone, another former Homestore executive
who pleaded guilty to lesser charges of insider trading.</TE>
<TE>   With the government's blessing, the lawyers are sharing the trio's
version of events with attorneys for Homestore shareholders,
according to people involved in the Homestore criminal case and
investor litigation.</TE>
<TE>   That version portrays a constellation of online companies
struggling to pump up one another's revenues in 2000 and 2001 as the
Internet craze faded -- and often clashing in distrust even as they
conspired together.</TE>
<TE>   The clearest picture yet of Giesecke and Shew's account emerged
Friday, when the nation's third-largest pension fund, the California
State Teachers' Retirement System, amended its class-action lawsuit
in Los Angeles federal court on behalf of Homestore investors.</TE>
<TE>   The 244-page suit seeks damages from Homestore and 16 other firms
with large Internet presences, notably deep-pocketed defendants AOL
and Cendant Corp., the franchiser of real estate brands Century 21,
ERA and Coldwell Banker.</TE>
<TE>   AOL has restated its books to eliminate $190 million in revenue it
acknowledges should not have been recorded. However, it has portrayed
the Homestore deals as the work of a rogue former employee at its
America Online unit.</TE>
<TE>   AOL has declined to comment on the new suit, which contends that
at least four America Online executives knew about the fraud,
including Joseph A. Ripp, who was then America Online's chief
financial officer and is now a vice chairman of the Internet unit.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission
already are probing AOL's accounting practices. The teacher pension
fund lawsuit, with its wealth of detail, provides clues to the areas
that government investigators are looking into.</TE>
<TE>   A Cendant spokesman said Sunday that the allegations in the suit
-- that the New York company helped arrange improper deals to boost
Homestore's revenue -- "are meritless and reckless." He said the
company intends to "aggressively defend against this spurious and
egregious lawsuit."</TE>
<TE>   The professional path that led Giesecke and Shew to the L.A.
courtroom where they admitted their crimes Oct. 21 began during the
six years the two accountants worked at the Century City offices of
the accounting firm then known as Price Waterhouse. When Giesecke
left Price Waterhouse for Disney in 1994, Shew followed seven months
later, according to a Homestore SEC filing.</TE>
<TE>   Giesecke aspired to be Disney's chief financial officer, according
to the lawsuit, but when that failed to materialize, he joined what
was then Homestore.com in 1998. Shew followed two months later.</TE>
<TE>   When Homestore promoted Giesecke from chief financial officer to
chief operating officer, Shew became Homestore's CFO. That was in
February 2001, just as Homestore began concocting the
revenue-inflating deals that led to the criminal charges against
Giesecke and Shew.</TE>
<TE>   Shew resigned in December, followed a month later by the firings
of Giesecke and other top managers. Shew also was first to strike a
plea bargain with federal prosecutors, receiving a five-year maximum
prison sentence. Giesecke was given a 10-year maximum sentence. By
cooperating with investigators, the men hope to earn reduced
sentences.</TE>
<TE>   The suit alleges a number of schemes, including barters disguised
as sales, stock issued to business partners so they would buy ads and
Homestore services, and the use of small companies as intermediaries
in deals that in reality were just Homestore passing cash back and
forth with AOL and other partners.</TE>
<TE>   It could take years for attorneys and juries to decide whether to
accept Giesecke and Shew's version of events. If they are caught
lying or obstructing justice, the sentencing limits come off and they
could be sent to prison for decades.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, many of the executives they have implicated in
their statements have yet to tell their side of the story in public.</TE>
<TE>   They include Homestore founder Stuart H. Wolff, who made $33.7
million on allegedly illegal stock sales, and his former No. 2 at the
company, business-development executive Peter B. Tafeen, who
allegedly made $18 million on what the suit calls illegal insider
trading. Sources involved in the criminal investigation said
prosecutors have met with attorneys for Wolff and Tafeen, explaining
evidence against them and raising the prospect of stiff prison
sentences if they don't cooperate.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for Wolff and Tafeen have maintained their clients, an
engineer and a deal-maker respectively, weren't accounting experts
and were unaware of any improper recording of revenue. They couldn't
be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Tafeen was closely involved with two other defendants in the civil
suit: former America Online deal-makers Eric Keller and his boss
David Colburn, both of whom have been fired over questionable
accounting. The suit says the three men devised suspect transactions,
called "Peter specials," to be used when it appeared Homestore would
fall short of its all-important quarterly revenue target -- known as
the "bogie." Keller and Colburn didn't return phone calls.</TE>
<TE>   The suit suggests the revenue inflation was nearly exposed in late
2000, when Homestore called off an improper deal with GlobeXplorer
Inc., a seller of satellite and aerial photos that is one of the
defendants in the suit. GlobeXplorer in response threatened to reveal
the deals at an investor conference sponsored by Robertson Stephens
Inc. in San Francisco, at which Shew was scheduled to appear.</TE>
<TE>   "To avoid the threat of exposure," the suit contends, $100,000 to
$200,000 changed hands "to appease GlobeXplorer."</TE>
<TE>   Shew then attended the conference without any questions raised
publicly, the suit says. GlobeXplorer couldn't be reached for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   As the Nov. 14 deadline approached for filing Homestore's
third-quarter financials for 2001, bigger cracks were appearing in
the company's facade.</TE>
<TE>   PricewaterhouseCoopers auditors wanted proof that L90 Inc., a
small marketing company that is a defendant in the suit, was spending
a huge chunk of its budget on Homestore ads, and "Shew was caught
off-guard and did not know the answers," the suit says.</TE>
<TE>   When L90's founder balked at signing a confirmation letter,
Giesecke told Shew he should get help from Tafeen, the "Prince of
Deals," who had quit as head of business development and was working
for Homestore in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Tafeen replied that "it was not his job anymore," according to the
suit.</TE>
<TE>   Shew got the documents from L90 the night before the financials
were due, but told Giesecke the next morning he had reservations
about signing the quarterly report, the suit says.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Shew signed the report. Three weeks later, he
resigned from Homestore, and two weeks after that Homestore announced
to investors that it was conducting an investigation of its
accounting practices and would have to restate its revenue.</TE>

<HD>State Could Face Gasoline Price Hikes</HD>
<DH>Some energy experts say the phase-in of an environmental
rule coupled with a U.S.-led war on Iraq may double the cost of fuel.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Evelyn Iritani</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California consumers could see gasoline prices shoot as high as $4 a
gallon next year if a U.S.-led war on Iraq disrupts the flow of
Middle East oil at the same time the state introduces a new
environmental regulation that is likely to create supply problems,
some energy experts warn.</LD>
<LD>   Though many analysts strongly disagree that things are so dire for
consumers, West Coast traders are bracing for problems in January
when California begins phasing out gasoline containing methyl
tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE. The controversial additive has been
banned because of environmental concerns. The state, meanwhile, is
shifting to gasoline made with ethanol, another clean-air additive.</LD>
<LD>   The fragile situation could then get worse if the U.S. attacks
Iraq because the West Coast's reliance on imported petroleum leaves
it "extremely vulnerable" to a global oil disruption, said Philip
Verleger, an energy analyst with the Council on Foreign Relations in
New York.</LD>
<TE>   He is convinced that a war with Iraq at least for a time could
push crude oil prices above $40 a barrel, up from about $25 now. And
if that happened as ethanol-related supply troubles kicked in,
Verleger contends, Californians could face a doubling of prices at
the pump.</TE>
<TE>   Such a scenario would not only depress an already shaky economy
but also could spark a backlash against the U.S. effort to disarm
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, he warned.</TE>
<TE>   "No one is thinking about this," Verleger said after a
presentation Saturday at the annual meeting of the Pacific Council on
International Policy, a foreign policy organization based in Los
Angeles. "We haven't done anything to prepare for it."</TE>
<TE>   John Kingston, director of global oil for Platts, an energy
information service, believes that California's transition to ethanol
will trigger gasoline shortages and steep price hikes regardless of
what happens in the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   He predicts that producers outside of California will initially
shy away from shifting to gasoline with ethanol because of the
uncertain demand and higher costs of production and transportation.
That could create reductions in supply and price hikes of as much as
30 cents a gallon a day in California by early spring, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Traders are not nonchalant about this," Kingston said. "Think
chaos."</TE>
<TE>   Others are skeptical, however, that the West Coast faces such a
grave threat.</TE>
<TE>   Amy Jaffe, a senior energy analyst at Rice University in Houston,
said there are enough oil suppliers in Asia and Latin America to keep
California refineries supplied if the Mideast oil supply is
disrupted.</TE>
<TE>   In a severe situation, Jaffe said, California officials could
temporarily lift environmental restrictions that limit the types of
gasoline drivers can use. And she believes that U.S. refineries will
move relatively quickly to ethanol because the California market is
too big to ignore.</TE>
<TE>   "You may have to pay 50 cents more to get a barrel from Asia, but
people in California already pay more for gasoline than elsewhere in
the country because of your environmental restrictions," Jaffe said.
"Somebody's not going to have to turn off a California refinery
because there's no oil."</TE>
<TE>   Crude oil prices, which jumped more than 40% earlier in the year,
have dropped in recent weeks because of increased production by OPEC
and progress in the United Nations' campaign to disarm the Iraqi
government. Oil prices fell a dollar a barrel last week after Hussein
agreed to U.N. weapons inspections. West Texas Intermediate crude
closed at $25.53 a barrel Friday, up 25 cents over the previous day.</TE>
<TE>   Yet though gasoline prices have held steady or dropped recently in
other parts of the country, they have risen here.</TE>
<TE>   In California, the average price of a gallon of regular self-serve
gasoline on Nov. 11 was $1.59, a 3-cent increase over the previous
week, according to the Energy Department. The nationwide average was
$1.44 a gallon, a 9-cent-per-gallon decrease from the previous week.</TE>
<TE>   The West Coast's dependence on imported oil and distance from key
providers drastically increases the region's economic vulnerability,
according to Verleger.</TE>
<TE>   During the first Gulf War, he noted, the region was an exporter of
Alaskan oil, but a decline in production has changed that picture
dramatically.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the West Coast imports 1 out of 3 barrels of oil it
consumes. Nearly 10% of those imports come from the Middle East, and
about half of that is supplied by Iraq under the U.N.-administered
oil-for-food program.</TE>
<TE>   To add to the pressure, financially strapped West Coast energy
companies have depleted their oil inventories, which are at half the
level of 1990.</TE>
<TE>   The West Coast also can't depend on the U.S. government's
emergency cache of oil for a quick fix, according to Verleger. The
Energy Department recently announced that its Strategic Petroleum
Reserve had reached 592 million barrels, the highest level in the
program's 25-year history.</TE>
<TE>   But getting that oil to the West Coast would be costly and
time-consuming because it is stored in more than 50 underground
caverns along the coast of Texas and Louisiana. The quickest way to
California would be through the Panama Canal, but that is limited to
smaller tankers because of the canal's size.</TE>
<TE>   And under the Jones Act, a 1920 federal law aimed at protecting
domestic shippers, only U.S. flag carriers can deliver cargo between
two U.S. ports. Verleger said there are only a few U.S.-flagged
tankers, and they already are busy transporting oil from Alaska to
the lower states.</TE>
<TE>   Though OPEC countries have increased their output lately, most of
the extra reserves are being held in the Caribbean and in tankers
outside the Pacific because those areas are considered less
vulnerable to attack.</TE>
<TE>   As an insurance policy, Verleger suggests that West Coast
officials strike a deal with Japan. In the event of an oil crisis,
Japan, which currently has 180 days of reserves, could agree to use
its emergency supply and allow crude oil headed for that country to
be diverted to the West Coast.</TE>
<TE>   Verleger pointed out that though the U.S. government has treated
the country as an "economic whole" in devising its energy strategy,
the "interests of the West Coast are more linked to the Pacific Rim
than the East Coast."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. defense secretary also can issue a temporary waiver of
the Jones Act shipping restriction if national security is in danger.
The last time the U.S. government granted a security waiver was
during the 1990-91 Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   "This is all doable, but it shouldn't be left until the last
minute," Verleger said.</TE>
<TE>   California Energy Commission officials could not be reached Sunday
for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Jane Harman (D-Venice), a member of the House Energy and
Commerce Committee, agrees that the West Coast energy supply could be
endangered by war with Iraq or terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   But she said local and state officials would have difficulty
developing emergency response plans until the Bush administration
provided a thorough assessment of the possible damage, from the oil
well to the gas pump.</TE>
<TE>   "We are vulnerable," said Harman, the ranking Democrat on the
House Subcommittee on Terrorism and Homeland Security. "Our energy
supply is vulnerable."</TE>

<HD>Housing Starts May Stay Above Year's Average</HD>

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Key economic reports this week are expected to show that home
construction in October stayed above this year's average as builders
worked to keep pace with record demand that has been a linchpin for
the economic recovery. Meanwhile, prices consumers pay for goods and
services probably rose slightly.</LD>
<LD>   Housing starts, which will be reported Wednesday, probably ran at
a 1.71-million-unit annual rate last month, based on the median of 36
forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey of economists. That would be
down from the record 1.843 million pace the Commerce Department
reported for September and faster than this year's average 1.699
million, fueled by record-low mortgage rates.</LD>
<LD>   The October consumer price index probably rose 0.3% last month
after a 0.2% rise in September, economists expect the Labor
Department's report Tuesday to show. Services such as PacifiCare
Health Systems Inc. and automobile insurer Geico Corp. have raised
prices in an environment in which competition or weak demand has kept
companies in most industries from doing so.</LD>
<TE>   With economic growth "now slowly reaccelerating in response to
monetary accommodation, inflation should bottom late this year," said
Mickey Levy, chief economist at Banc of America Securities in New
York. "The chances of general deflation emerging in the U.S. remain
low."</TE>
<TE>   Consumer prices excluding food and energy probably rose 0.2% in
October after a 0.1% rise.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the Conference Board is likely to report that its
index of leading economic indicators fell in October for a fifth
straight month amid lower consumer confidence and stock prices. The
0.1 decrease would follow a 0.2 decline in September.</TE>
<TE>   Sluggish demand is restraining manufacturing. A minus 3 reading
for the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's November manufacturing
index is expected, suggesting declining factory activity. In October,
the index was minus 13.1.</TE>
<TE>   Also Tuesday, the Commerce Department probably will report that
the nation's trade deficit in goods and services narrowed to $37.3
billion in September from $38.5 billion in August.</TE>

<HD>No Settlement Seen on Stock Analyst Conflicts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eliot Spitzer, New York state's top prosecutor, said there would be
no settlement this week with Wall Street firms over conflicts of
interest in stock research and recommendations, seen as responsible
for billions of dollars in investor losses.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not going to be this week. That would be a false
expectation," New York State Atty. Gen. Spitzer said on ABC-TV's
"This Week" program. He also criticized Congress, the Bush
administration and federal regulators for not taking enough steps to
clean up the industry.</LD>
<LD>   His comments came as talks have been underway among Wall Street's
biggest firms, the Securities and Exchange Commission and state
regulators to resolve high-profile conflicts of interest in the
investment banking industry.</LD>
<TE>   But a recent stir over corporate accounting scandals helped lead
to the resignations of SEC Chairman Harvey L. Pitt and William H.
Webster, the designated chairman of a newly formed federal accounting
oversight panel. Those departures have left investors, lawmakers and
others concerned about the effectiveness of federal policing of Wall
Street.</TE>
<TE>   "I would prefer that these issues be dealt with by Congress, by
the SEC. But they didn't," Spitzer said.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer vowed to help clean up the industry by requiring that
firms provide investors access to independent research and
recommendations on stocks.</TE>
<TE>   He is presiding over several high-profile cases with Wall Street
investment banking firms, including the latest allegations involving
the stock ratings of Jack Grubman, the former star analyst at Salomon
Smith Barney, a division of Citigroup, on AT&amp;T Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Though he would not talk specifically about that case, Spitzer
said evidence was mounting against many firms, that big fines would
be paid and that criminal charges have not been ruled out.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Companies plan to hire slightly more people in the first few months
of 2003 than a year ago even as they remain highly uncertain about
the economy, a survey to be released today shows.</LD>
<LD>   The improvements in companies' hiring intentions are moving at a
marginal pace for the second straight quarter, according to the
Manpower Inc. quarterly survey of 16,000 businesses.</LD>
<LD>   About 20% of the companies surveyed by Manpower expect to hire
more people in the January-March quarter, and 12% plan to cut
workers, according to the survey. The remainder said they expected to
maintain their staffing or were uncertain.</LD>
<TE>   When seasonally adjusted, the first quarter's hiring intentions
are slightly above those of the last two quarters.</TE>
<TE>   Employers also are a bit more optimistic than they were for the
first quarter of 2002, when 16% expected to hire more workers and 16%
planned to reduce staff.</TE>
<TE>   Manpower, based in Glendale, Wis., is the nation's largest
staffing company. It has conducted the survey for 27 years.</TE>

<HD>SBC to Offer Bundled Service to Stem Losses</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SBC Communications Inc. will announce today it will combine local,
long-distance and wireless calling with Internet access on one bill
to stem customer losses and increase sales and profit, which have
fallen in five straight quarters.</LD>
<LD>   SBC, the parent of Pacific Bell, will not be allowed to offer the
bundled service in California, although the San Antonio, Texas-based
company is seeking to enter the state market by year's end.</LD>
<LD>   Regional phone companies such as SBC can't sell long-distance in
states where they dominate local calling before proving that their
networks are open to use by rivals. SBC has received U.S. approval to
sell long-distance in six states.</LD>
<TE>   Customers can cut their bills by as much as $575 a year when
purchasing bundled services. The move will boost sales and profit,
Chris Sanborn, SBC's vice president of consumer marketing, said in an
interview. Sanborn declined to elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. phone companies are seeking to sell more services amid
increasing competition and slower U.S. economic growth. SBC's
third-quarter net income fell 15% to $1.77 billion on a 6.9% sales
decline, excluding a wireless joint venture. The phone lines SBC
serves fell 4.3% to 57.6 million in the quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Customers who receive multiple services from a company are less
likely to leave, analysts say. Verizon Communications Inc., the
biggest U.S. local-phone company, announced a similar offer in
August.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of SBC, which operates in the U.S. Midwest, Southwest,
California and Connecticut, rose 79 cents to $25.19 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading Friday. They have dropped 36% this year.</TE>

<HD>Shipping Lines Steer Through a Sea of Losses</HD>
<DH>Ocean carriers face too much competition in a sluggish
global economy. Debt burden from vessel shopping binge adds to
trouble.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Marla Dickerson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Labor negotiations at the West Coast ports have been a bare-knuckles
brawl. But the ocean carriers' worst enemy may be themselves, not
10,500 swaggering dockworkers.</LD>
<LD>   The global shipping industry is in financial straits, thanks in
part to a glut of new ships ordered during the economic boom. Freight
rates have tumbled. Carriers are bleeding red ink. Yet shipping lines
continue to add gigantic vessels to their fleets as part of an arms
race to grab market share.</LD>
<LD>   In a year when cargo on the Asia-North America trade lanes has hit
record levels, major transpacific carriers are projected to lose a
combined $2 billion in 2002. Losses on other global trade routes are
mounting as well.</LD>
<TE>   "The state of the industry can be summed up in one word: 'dismal,'
" said John Gurrad, vice president of business planning for Mitsui
O.S.K. Lines, a Japanese carrier whose net income plunged 60% in the
first half of its fiscal year ending in September.</TE>
<TE>   In theory, shipping lines should be riding high on a wave of
globalization. Ocean carriers deliver a service so vital to the U.S.
and world economies that President Bush stepped in to reopen West
Coast ports last month, ending a 10-day management lockout. What's
more, steamship companies enjoy an exemption from U.S. antitrust law,
which allows them to discuss pricing and set rate targets on their
American routes.</TE>
<TE>   But the confederacy of ocean carriers has proven even leakier than
the OPEC cartel.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of standing firm on rate hikes and holding the line on new
ships, they tend to undercut each other when the going gets tough,
industry experts say. Burdened with too much debt and too many
players chasing too few shipping containers in a sluggish global
economy, the industry is facing troubles that extend well beyond the
squabble at the West Coast ports.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a healthy industry, and it hasn't been for some time,"
said London-based analyst John Fossey of Drewry Shipping Consultants.
"We're looking at a relatively low freight rate environment for at
least the next couple of years."</TE>
<TE>   Ocean shipping is a cyclical business that rises and falls with
the global economy. Still, many of the industry's troubles are of its
own making.</TE>
<TE>   For starters, the world simply has too many carriers. Hundreds of
small fry serve niche markets around the globe, with dozens of bigger
players duking it out on the major trade routes linking the United
States, Asia and Europe. Barriers to entry are low. Competition is
fierce. Companies that exit the business rarely take their vessels
with them.</TE>
<TE>   "If a steamship line goes belly up, those ships don't sink," said
port consultant Peter Vandermat, vice president of Oakland-based JWD
Group. "A competitor picks them up for 25 cents on the dollar, paints
a different symbol on the stack and on we go. There is just as much
capacity as before."</TE>
<TE>   And it's growing. International trade accelerated in the late
1990s, particularly on Pacific routes linking Asia and the United
States. Among the factors driving the trend: a booming U.S. economy,
China's rise as a manufacturing powerhouse and its neighbors'
eagerness to export their way out of the Asian economic crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Giddy over the surging cargo volume and enticed by bargain prices
from shipbuilders, ocean carriers rushed to order new vessels. Many
of those orders were for leviathan "post-Panamax" ships, so named
because they're too wide to fit through the Panama Canal. The largest
are capable of carrying upward of 7,000 20-foot shipping containers,
known as "20-foot equivalent units" or TEUs in industry parlance.</TE>
<TE>   Bigger ships have helped add to the industry's capacity, which has
been growing faster than cargo volume for several years. The
disparity only got worse during last year's economic downturn.

that in 2002 alone, the capacity of the world fleet will grow by
nearly 14% to 6.1 million TEUs, while demand has grown only 4%.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a huge supply-and-demand imbalance," said managing
editor Matthew Beddow. "They ordered too many ships."</TE>
<TE>   Stormy market conditions sunk South Korean carrier Cho Yang
Shipping Co. last year, and industry watchers are predicting more
casualties. But consolidation hasn't come as quickly as many had
expected.</TE>
<TE>   The United States lost two of its major flagship carriers in the
late 1990s. One was Oakland-based APL Ltd., which merged with
Singapore-based Neptune Orient Lines. The other was Sea-Land Service
Inc. of Charlotte, N.C., which was acquired by Maersk Line, a
division of the Danish conglomerate A.P. Moller.</TE>
<TE>   But other countries haven't been so willing to surrender their
flags.</TE>
<TE>   Some foreign governments nurture their shipping lines as a matter
of pride, economic development or national security. China Shipping
Container Line, for example, the world's 17th-largest carrier, is a
wholly state-owned enterprise. China Ocean Shipping Co. or Cosco,
which ranks seventh, has subsidiaries controlled by the Chinese
government. Other Asian nations are closely allied with their
home-grown carriers as well.</TE>
<TE>   Governments don't have the same profit motive as private
enterprises. Observers say China's shipping industry exists largely
to support a booming export trade, the key to that nation's
breathtaking growth and development.</TE>
<TE>   The transpacific shipping routes have become the world's busiest
on the strength of Chinese exports to the United States -- more than
$100 billion worth last year alone. But steamship competitors
complain that China is more concerned about keeping its factories
humming than about turning a profit on its shipping enterprises.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in the business to maximize our bottom line," groused a
U.S.-based industry veteran. "It's not clear that the Chinese lines
are in business to do the same thing. It's in their interest to keep
rates low to support their export policy."</TE>
<TE>   Carrier "discussion agreements" established to smooth ruffled
feathers and hammer out price strategy have met with only limited
success.</TE>
<TE>   The United States allowed steamship lines to enter into
price-fixing agreements beginning in 1916 to eliminate "destructive"
competition and encourage rate stability. Critics have lambasted the
antitrust exemption and have long lobbied to have it revoked.
Congress has weakened the shipping industry's protection somewhat in
recent years. Carrier groups are allowed to set pricing "guidelines"
for their members. However, individual steamship lines are free to
negotiate their own rates with customers in private.</TE>
<TE>   Even with its antitrust exemption, the shipping industry has had
difficulty coordinating its actions.</TE>
<TE>   Carriers routinely break ranks and slash rates to preserve market
share at the slightest hint of slowdown.</TE>
<TE>   That behavior cost transpacific carriers a bundle this year.
Spooked by last year's U.S. recession and the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks, many steamship lines cut bargain deals with their biggest
customers in early 2002, only to watch cargo volume surge by early
summer because of strong spending by U.S. consumers. The latest
figures from Containersation International show the average rate for
all commodities traveling from Asia to the U.S. slipped to $1,463 in
the second quarter, the lowest level seen since the 1997-98 Asian
crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Although carriers managed to pass along some peak-season
surcharges and congestion fees after the shutdown of the ports, those
increases won't be enough to make up for the losses they sustained
during the closure, coupled with the rock-bottom rates many of the
shipping lines locked themselves into early in the season.</TE>
<TE>   "We have missed a golden opportunity this year," said Gurrad of
Mitsui O.S.K. Lines. "All the carriers basically panicked. Everyone
was trying to protect market share, so we all ended up cutting
rates."</TE>
<TE>   With labor talks at the ports looking to produce an agreement
soon, carriers can at least take solace in winning long-awaited
improvements in technology that should reduce their operating costs
and boost productivity in coming years.</TE>
<TE>   International Longshore and Warehouse Union spokesman Steve
Stallone said carriers will save tens of millions of dollars
annually. He isn't buying the industry's pauper talk.</TE>
<TE>   "Every business cries poverty when it comes time to negotiate a
contract," Stallone said. "Last year was a bad year. But cargo volume
is going to soar over the next 10 years ... and rates are going to
recover."</TE>
<TE>   Scott Dailey, spokesman for shipping line APL, hopes Stallone is
right.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't seen rates this low in a long time," said Dailey,
whose Singaporean parent company lost $151.4 million in the first
half of this year. "If it continues like this, a lot of carriers
aren't going to survive."</TE>

<HD>Finding Room for Family and Friends</HD>
<DH>Visitors to L.A. bunk more often at private homes than at
hotels. The shift supports a nationwide trend toward cocooning since
Sept. 11, experts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bonnie Harris</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>These days, the hottest place to stay in Los Angeles also has the
best room rates, the most comforts of home and plenty of perks for
favorite guests.</LD>
<LD>   But take note: There also may be less privacy, limited
availability and strained relationships by checkout.</LD>
<LD>   For the first time, more visitors are bunking with friends and
relatives rather than in hotel rooms -- a trend that falls under what
experts have coined the "nature-nurture movement" and is being
mirrored in cities across the country.</LD>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, more than half of U.S. visitors to the city --
about 10 million people -- stayed in private homes this year and
spent more than in years past.</TE>
<TE>   The trend appears to be helping to offset the slump in foreign
tourism and business travel to Los Angeles for now, but if it
continues it could be difficult to reverse and thereby keep cities'
visitors spending depressed.</TE>
<TE>   This year was the first time Carolyn Ferguson of Long Beach hosted
her parents for their annual visit, a stay that lasted two weeks and
went "better than expected," according to the 36-year-old mother of
two. Ferguson, a police officer, said she wanted her parents to spend
uninterrupted time getting to know her 3-month-old son, and didn't
want to keep driving back and forth between her house and a hotel.</TE>
<TE>   When it was over, Ferguson said she and her husband -- who gave up
their bedroom for her parents because it has a private bath -- were
less stressed than they thought they'd be.</TE>
<TE>   "I figured it'd be a total lack-of-space type thing, where we were
constantly bumping into each other and had no downtime," she said.
"But it actually went OK.</TE>
<TE>   "We had the usual stuff where they told us what to do all the time
and I think they got a little restless in the end. They were probably
ready to go home."</TE>
<TE>   Ferguson's mother, Mae Boyer of Annapolis, Md., said with the
exception of "a few housekeeping issues," the visit was a success.</TE>
<TE>   "They stay up way too late, first of all, and I wish I could have
organized their cupboards because you can't find a thing anywhere,"
Boyer said. "But all in all, we had a lovely time. I don't know how
much money we saved, though. We were buying stuff right and left,
usually for their kitchen."</TE>
<TE>   Nationally, travel experts said the shift from hotels to homes
climbed higher than ever in 2002, supporting the widespread theory
that Sept. 11 and a slowing economy have prompted families to
reconnect with loved ones and take shorter trips closer to home.</TE>
<TE>   Such cocooning has shown up in other areas too: Campground
reservations have been running at least 15% ahead of last year and
annual RV rentals are up 35%. Attending family reunions and taking
multigenerational trips account for more leisure travel than ever
before, according to the U.S. Tour Operators Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "People have been getting back to the basics -- visiting parks,
camping, vacationing by car -- and the overall focus has been
spending time with family and friends," said Skip Hull, president of
CIC Research in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   "That in itself may not be very surprising, given the emotional
climate of our country. But the fact that it's continuing, and that
the numbers show it having a fairly dramatic impact, is definitely
noteworthy."</TE>
<TE>   For Los Angeles, the stay-with-family trend is helping to
alleviate the severe drop-off in business travel, because spending
among those staying in private homes jumped to $3 billion, or about a
third of all visitor spending and up from a quarter in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "It is definitely a solid trend, and it's resulting in a larger
number of dollars for us," said David Sheatsley, a researcher for the
Los Angeles Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, L.A. visitor spending among those staying in hotels
has dropped steadily since 2000, from $6.5 billion to $5.5 billion
this year. The number of visitors who stay in L.A. hotels is expected
to drop 4% in 2002, with international hotel visitor volumes falling
8% and domestic 2.9%.</TE>
<TE>   To track the number of guests staying in private homes, 2,400
households in Los Angeles County are randomly polled throughout the
year. Respondents are asked whether they had overnight visitors stay
with them within the last two months, how long the visit lasted, what
attractions or activities they took in and about how much they spent
during the trip.</TE>
<TE>   The challenge for L.A. and other cities in the long term will be
to persuade visitors with friends or family to stay in hotels instead
and not wait for foreign tourism and business travel to recover.
Hotel guests account for the bulk of visitor spending, and the L.A.
visitors bureau is forecasting about 20 million people will visit the
region this year, about the same as 2001, and they will be spending
3% less.</TE>
<TE>   "We've found that it's extremely difficult to reverse this kind of
trend and convert these visits into hotel room nights," said Peter C.
Yesawich, president of Orlando, Fla.-based Yesawich, Pepperdine &amp;
Brown, a marketing firm specializing in travel research.</TE>
<TE>   "You cannot underestimate the power of family ties, especially in
these uncertain times.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have seven out of 10 adults saying they wish they could
spend more time together as a family right now, you're bound to see
some changes in travel habits," said Yesawich, referring to his
firm's latest travel survey.</TE>
<TE>   Many hotels already have added "homey touches" to help make guests
feel more at ease since Sept. 11, said Bjorn Hanson, who runs
PricewaterhouseCooper's lodging-consulting practice.</TE>
<TE>   Some large chains -- such as Marriott and Starwood -- have
experimented with warmer color palettes, different menu items and
plusher linens, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course they've had to be very subtle about it," Hanson said,
"because hotels don't want to say, 'Our guests are skittish about
traveling so now we have to pile on some good, old-fashioned
nurturing to get them back.' "</TE>
<TE>   Still, Hanson doubts the efforts make much difference either way.</TE>
<TE>   "For the guests who have already decided to stay in a hotel,
seeing a different shade of paint isn't going to matter," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "And for the visitors who plan to stay with friends or relatives,
the thought of a softer pillow at the Sheraton up the road isn't
going to change their mind."</TE>

<HD>Union Trash Haulers Reject Contract Offer</HD>
<DH>Waste Management says Teamsters local has authorized a
possible strike that could affect South Bay-area homes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter Pae</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Waste Management Inc. said Sunday its unionized truck drivers who
collect trash from more than 110,000 homes in the South Bay area
rejected a company-proposed contract offer over the weekend and
authorized a possible strike.</LD>
<LD>   The nation's largest garbage hauler said Teamsters Local 396,
representing 500 drivers in Los Angeles, rejected a company offer to
increase salaries and benefits by 38% over the next five years,
raising the average base salary to $58,000 from $45,000 a year.</LD>
<LD>   The union, whose officials could not be reached for comment
Sunday, is seeking a 70% wage and benefit increase, the company said.</LD>
<TE>   No strike deadline has been set, but a Waste Management official
said the company was concerned that some drivers would begin striking
immediately, possibly disrupting trash collection in Carson,
Huntington Park, Lynwood, Manhattan Beach, Rancho Palos Verdes and
Redondo Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "Union officers are not yet prepared to authorize a strike, but
we're concerned that some drivers will strike on their own," said Bob
Coyle, a Waste Management spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Waste Management and the union have been negotiating since Aug. 1
for a new contract. The current contract expired Sept. 30 and was
extended to Nov. 17. The company said it remained "hopeful that we
can continue our talks" with the union.</TE>
<TE>   But if a strike were to take place, the Houston-based company said
it would make staffing adjustments, including bringing in employees
from other local regions to minimize disruption to trash pickup.</TE>
<TE>   Trash service for hospitals, health clinics and restaurants would
not be affected by the strike, the company said.</TE>

<HD>United Plans to Cut 9,000 Additional Jobs, Make Profit in
2004</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>United Airlines, racing to avoid bankruptcy, Sunday released more
details of a business plan aimed at getting a $1.8-billion federal
loan guarantee, including shrinking itself by about one-quarter and
making an operating profit in 2004.</LD>
<LD>   The No. 2 U.S. airline said it expects about 9,000 more job cuts
from its staff of about 83,000, but gave no details about a timetable
or where they would originate. Before the Sept. 11 attacks threw the
airline industry into havoc, United had about 100,000 workers.</LD>
<LD>   United's parent, UAL Corp., posted billions of dollars in losses
last year and in 2002 as the industry remained mired in a historic
downturn.</LD>
<TE>   The carrier said it will be cutting its flight schedule, also
known as capacity, by an additional 6% in 2003, leaving the airline
about 23% smaller than it was before Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   United, the biggest airline operating at Los Angeles International
and San Francisco airports, did not say where it plans to cut
flights.</TE>
<TE>   In details submitted in a financial recovery plan to the Air
Transportation Stabilization Board, UAL also said it expected to
retire an additional 49 aircraft. The company is based in Elk Grove
Village, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   The airline has asked the ATSB to guarantee $1.8 billion of a
$2-billion loan. The carrier released details to the public at the
same time it got the word out to employees, United spokesman Rich
Nelson said Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The key to an expected turnaround is $2.5 billion in annual profit
improvements, including $1.1 billion in annual labor cost savings and
an additional $1.4 billion a year in non-labor cost savings and
revenue enhancements, United said.</TE>
<TE>   The airline is engaged in an all-out public relations campaign to
win approval of the loan backing, but sources familiar with the
matter say it might backfire or the government may delay a decision,
in effect putting the airline into bankruptcy anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, United confirmed it was talking to major banks about
getting $2 billion in "debtor-in-possession" financing to keep
operating in the event of a bankruptcy filing.</TE>
<TE>   Many Wall Street analysts have said United's plan may not be
enough to persuade the government to back the loan.</TE>
<TE>   "The odds are still against an approval," Blaylock &amp; Partners
airline analyst Ray Neidl said. "Are the concessions all 'hard
dollars' is the question that the ATSB and analysts are asking."</TE>
<TE>   United has cash on hand, but is burning through it so quickly that
a debt payment of $375 million due Dec. 2, which cannot be
renegotiated, would push its reserves too low.</TE>
<TE>   Among big labor groups, the leaders of the pilots and flight
attendants unions recently agreed to take pay cuts and are having
their memberships vote on the tentative deals. But machinists,
represented by the International Assn. of Machinists, have not struck
a deal.</TE>
<TE>   Friday, UAL stock closed at $2.95, down 17 cents, on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<LD>Israeli sky marshals foiled a hijacking attempt on an El Al flight
from Tel Aviv to Turkey on Sunday, overpowering a man armed with a
pocketknife, witnesses and officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Flight 581 landed safely in Istanbul and none of the 170
passengers was hurt, an El Al official said. A Turkish airport
official said one "terrorist" was being held after the incident.</LD>
<LD>   Witnesses said the passenger tried to storm the cockpit before
security guards on board caught him. A news agency identified the man
as Tawfiq Fukra, 23, an Arab with an Israeli passport.</LD>

<LD>The influential literary magazine Poetry has rejected Ruth Lilly's
verse for decades, but it's not about to snub her latest offering: a
multimillion-dollar gift.</LD>
<LD>   The ailing billionaire heiress to the Eli Lilly Co. pharmaceutical
fortune will give the Chicago publication, which frequently has had
less than $100 in its till, millions of dollars a year.</LD>
<LD>   Lilly started sending in poems in the 1970s. The editor thought
they were good, but not to Poetry standards.</LD>
<TE>   Over the years, Lilly said, she warmed to the handwritten
rejection notes of editor Joe Parisi.</TE>

<LD>Bobby Fischer, the chess prodigy who won a world title in 1972, was
investigated by FBI agents who suspected his mother was a Communist
spy, according to FBI files obtained by the Philadelphia Inquirer.</LD>
<LD>   After years of reading her mail and studying her canceled checks,
the FBI concluded Regina Fischer was not a spy.</LD>
<LD>   A pediatrician who spoke eight languages, Regina Fischer died in
1997. Bobby Fischer, 59, now rarely appears in public. In interviews,
he praised the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, saying the U.S. should be
"wiped out."</LD>

<HD>Ridge Downplays Latest Warnings of Attacks</HD>
<DH>Move follows reports of a possible Al Qaeda assault on U.S.
Official won't say whether he'll be new Homeland Security secretary.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nick Anderson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The White House advisor for homeland security Sunday played down
warnings of new attacks on New York or Washington and sidestepped
questions about whether he would take the reins of a new Cabinet
department meant to counter terrorist threats.</LD>
<LD>   Tom Ridge, who has been President Bush's homeland security
director since shortly after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, appeared
on television talk shows to respond to recent reports that the Al
Qaeda terror network is preparing for fresh assaults against the
United States.</LD>
<LD>   "There are no new threats," Ridge told "Fox News Sunday." "There
are the same old conditions. It's just part of the continuing threat
environment that we assess. It's really nothing new."</LD>
<TE>   Questions about the terrorist organization were renewed after a
correspondent for the Arab satellite TV station Al Jazeera said he
had received a six-page document from Al Qaeda on Wednesday, after
the station had broadcast an audiotape thought to be the voice of Al
Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. government holds Bin Laden and his network responsible
for last year's attacks that destroyed the World Trade Center in New
York and damaged the Pentagon outside Washington, killing more than
3,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   Ridge said the administration was uncertain of the source of the
new document. But he acknowledged, as many administration officials
have in recent months, that the United States remains a target.</TE>
<TE>   "The war on terrorism has come to our shores," Ridge said. "We
have to deal with it."</TE>
<TE>   Ridge's appearances came as Congress is moving toward final
approval of legislation to create a Department of Homeland Security,
drawn from 22 federal agencies. It would be the most significant
government reorganization in half a century, affecting roughly
170,000 employees. Senate approval of the bill is expected early this
week, following House approval last week.</TE>
<TE>   Some news organizations, quoting unnamed administration officials,
have reported that Bush has settled on Ridge to be the first
secretary of the new department. But Ridge refused to confirm or deny
the reports.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm prepared to serve the president however he feels that I can
serve him best," Ridge told CNN's "Late Edition." "Why don't we just
leave it at that?"</TE>
<TE>   Ridge's assessment of the terrorist threat level was echoed Sunday
by Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), the incoming House minority
leader.</TE>
<TE>   Asked on NBC's "Meet the Press" to respond to warnings of possible
"spectacular" attacks, Pelosi said: "Much of what is in public domain
about these threats ... is real."</TE>
<TE>   She added: "It's important for us to know that we are in better
shape now than we were last year, in that there is an increased
awareness and a heightened scrutiny to the actions of people."</TE>
<TE>   Responding to a New York Times report that intelligence agencies
are monitoring Iraqi nationals and Iraqi Americans in the United
States, Pelosi said the government should be careful to protect both
the public and civil liberties.</TE>
<TE>   "As we protect and defend our country, we must also protect and
defend our Constitution, and we want to be smart about how we go
forward," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Ridge said the government would be mindful of civil liberties.
"Obviously, military action in Iraq would require additional action
to be taken domestically," he said. "We're not going to comment on
intelligence-gathering in our country."</TE>

<HD>An Icy Day Across New England</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>New England's first major ice storm of the season spread freezing
rain across the region Sunday, downing trees and knocking out power
to thousands of homes.</LD>
<LD>   More than half an inch of ice had accumulated in parts of northern
and western Connecticut, and more than 130,000 customers of Northeast
Utilities were without power at the height of the outages there.</LD>
<LD>   Several towns in the northwestern part of the state set up
emergency shelters while more than 100 utility crew members worked to
restore power.</LD>
<TE>   About 76,000 customers remained without electricity Sunday night.</TE>
<TE>   "It's ice, it is wind, it is branches hitting lines," said utility
spokesman Mitch Gross.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to take some time."</TE>
<TE>   Most parts of Maine had 3 to 5 inches of snow by the afternoon,
and trees were sagging under the weight of ice.</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 15,000 Central Maine Power Co. customers were without
electricity by Sunday afternoon, said company spokesman Kevin Howes.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of cars slid off highways and speed limits were reduced to
45 mph on the Maine Turnpike and Interstate 95.</TE>
<TE>   In Massachusetts, more than 10,000 outages were reported in
central and southeastern parts of the state overnight after ice
weighed down limbs and broke power lines.</TE>
<TE>   State police reported dozens of minor accidents and at least one
serious accident, in Andover, north of Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Police in Colchester, Conn., were investigating whether a fatal
accident Saturday night may have been related to the storm. State
Police Sgt. Gregory Kenney said there had been numerous minor
accidents and several roads closed by downed trees.</TE>
<TE>   Connecticut Gov. John Rowland toured areas hit by the storm
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "All the affected towns have been advised that the Office of
Emergency Management is ready to help if they need any assistance,"
said Dean Pagani, the governor's chief of staff.</TE>
<TE>   The northeaster swept a large part of the New England states,
dropping from 3 to 6 inches of snow in New Hampshire's northern
mountains and blowing cold rain across New York's Long Island.</TE>
<TE>   Wind gusted up to 35 mph on Long Island, where 7,000 homes and
businesses lost power, according to the Long Island Power Authority.</TE>

<HD>Replay of Reagan-Era Voting Patterns Is Not Good News for
Democrats</HD>

<LD>Walter F. Mondale on the ballot. Bruce Springsteen on the record
charts. And Republicans popping champagne on election night.</LD>
<LD>   Almost everything about the 2002 election season felt retro --
like 1984, in fact. The Republican triumph this year didn't approach
the scale of that year, when Ronald Reagan rolled to a 49-state
victory over Mondale, then the Democratic presidential nominee. But
the debate between the parties this fall -- and the ways that
competition divided the electorate -- often seemed to reprise the
early 1980s. Which is not good news for Democrats.</LD>
<LD>   Understanding exactly what happened and why in this month's
election is more difficult than usual because technical problems have
prevented the release of the Voter News Service exit poll, the
principal tool in recent years for assessing how the electorate
aligned and which issues moved voters.</LD>
<TE>   But revealing data are still available, both in the
county-by-county results and in election day polls by Republican Bill
McInturff and Democrat Stan Greenberg. And much of this evidence
advances a trend that first emerged in the 1998 congressional
election: the resurfacing of problems that plagued the Democrats
through the 1980s, when Republicans dominated the White House and the
national debate.</TE>
<TE>   Compared with the 1980s, Democrats are stronger today on several
fronts. Under Bill Clinton -- with his socially liberal, fiscally
moderate "New Democrat" message -- the party expanded its reach among
white suburbanites and moderates outside the South. For the most
part, it has held those gains.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1980 and 1984 presidential races, the Democratic nominee
lost independent voters by more than 20 percentage points each time.
But according to the Greenberg and McInturff surveys, Democrats ran
at least even with Republicans among independents in the 2002
congressional vote, just as Al Gore split independents almost evenly
with George W. Bush in the 2000 presidential contest.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats also continue to run much better today than in the 1980s
with white women, many of whom are attracted to the party's support
for gun control and legal abortion.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the South, Democrats still look strong in the big suburban
communities immediately around the major cities. Once reliably
Republican, suburbs such as Oakland County in Michigan, Bergen County
in New Jersey and Montgomery County in Philadelphia all backed Gore
in 2000 -- and Democrats in 2002. Overall, Greenberg's poll showed
the two parties running even in the suburbs this year.</TE>
<TE>   But on other electoral battlegrounds, the GOP is reestablishing
the advantages that produced its dominance in the Reagan era. Key
among them:</TE>
<TE>   White men: They were the backbone of the Reagan coalition -- in
1984, they gave Reagan a staggering 35-percentage-point margin over
Mondale. In his two presidential races, Clinton reduced that deficit
to around 10 points or less (partly because Reform Party candidate
Ross Perot siphoned many white men away from the GOP). Now the gap is
widening again: White men gave Republicans a 21-point margin in the
2002 vote, according to Greenberg's poll.</TE>
<TE>   The resurgent GOP advantage among white men is so powerful that it
could threaten one of the most important Democratic assets: the labor
movement's turnout machine. Greenberg found that Democrats led
Republicans this year among all union households by just 14 points --
half the margin of 1998--and only by six points among white union
households. That's sufficiently reminiscent of Reagan's blue-collar
appeal that it may soon be time to start talking about Bush
Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Married women: They leaned Republican in the 1980s, which helped
the GOP moderate the gender gap. (Then, as now, single women, who
tend to be more liberal on social issues, voted mostly Democratic.)
Clinton made progress here too, carrying married women in 1996 with a
message built around "tools" for parents.</TE>
<TE>   Now, values and security issues are nudging married women back
toward the GOP. Republicans carried married women comfortably in the
1998 congressional race, ran even in the 2000 presidential race and,
Greenberg found, posted a 10-point advantage in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Rural voters: They gave Reagan and President George Bush big
margins in the 1980s, then divided almost evenly in the Clinton
years. Now, Democrats are down on the farm again. Big gains in small
places have been key to the recent Republican upsurge: GOP
congressional candidates this year carried rural voters by more than
20 percentage points, just as Bush did in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The solid South: This region is resurfacing as the cornerstone of
GOP strength. In the 1990s, Democrats enjoyed a mini-revival through
Dixie, capturing several states with Clinton, adding two Senate seats
and winning six governorships. But in the 2000 presidential race,
Bush won every Southern state. And in 2002, Republicans recaptured
three governor's mansions, ousted Sen. Max Cleland (D-Ga.) and easily
held four open Southern Senate seats that had been in GOP hands.</TE>
<TE>   Driving these demographic and geographic tilts are shifts in the
debate between the parties. Values issues such as guns and abortion
-- following the backlash against the Clinton scandals in the late
1990s -- have been central to the GOP surge, especially in the South
and the countryside.</TE>
<TE>   Even more important this year was a reversion to the 1980s pattern
where the Democrats appear to be the "Mommy" party, preferred on
issues of caring and compassion, and Republicans the "Daddy" party,
trusted to defend the nation. In Greenberg's election day poll,
voters gave Republicans a 40-point advantage over Democrats on
keeping America strong. It doesn't take much more to understand the
stampede of white men back to the GOP.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats compounded their problem by failing to articulate a
comprehensive alternative vision for defending the nation. Indeed,
Democratic candidates lacked overarching messages this year on almost
any subject -- from economic opportunity to government reform.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, in a final echo of Mondale in the 1980s, most Democrats
tried to patch together majorities by wooing individual
constituencies with targeted programs, such as prescription drug
coverage for seniors. That was a recipe for disaster in the Reagan
years. And based on this month's results, it's no more appetizing for
voters today.</TE>

<HD>Protest of Military Program at Georgia Base Ends in Arrests</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>COLUMBUS, Ga.</DL>
<LD>More than 90 people, including at least six nuns, were arrested for
marching onto Ft. Benning grounds Sunday during an annual protest of
a U.S. military program that trains Latin American soldiers.</LD>
<LD>   "I feel anger at the deliberate teaching of violence," Caryl
Hartjes, a nun from Fond du Lac, Wis., said as she entered the
compound, where she was arrested.</LD>
<LD>   About 6,500 protesters gathered for the 13th annual demonstration
by the School of the Americas Watch, which continues to protest the
Nov. 19, 1989, killings of six Jesuit priests in El Salvador.
Protesters said they demonstrate because people responsible for the
killings were trained at the School of the Americas, a Ft.
Benning-based program that was replaced last year by a new institute.
Protesters say the change was only cosmetic.</LD>
<TE>   The protesters passed through the base's gates. Inside, a line of
military police guided them up a hill where they were arrested.
Illegally entering base property is a federal offense that can lead
to a six-month prison term.</TE>

<HD>Journalist Gets a Peek Inside Hussein's E-Mailbox</HD>
<DH>A freelancer says access was easy and that U.S. firms
proposed business deals to the Iraqi leader.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DURHAM, N.H.</DL>
<LD>Even Saddam Hussein gets spam.</LD>
<LD>   He also gets e-mail purporting to be from U.S. companies offering
business deals, and threats, according to a journalist who figured
out a way into an Iraqi government e-mail account and downloaded more
than 1,000 messages.</LD>
<LD>   Brian McWilliams, a freelancer who specializes in Internet
security, says he hardly needed high-level hacking skills to snoop
through e-mail addressed to Hussein.</LD>
<TE>   While doing research late one October night, the Durham resident
navigated his way to the official Iraqi government's Web site,
www.uruklink.net/iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The site, which worked last week but was offline Sunday, included
links that allowed visitors to send e-mail to Hussein and allowed
users of the government-controlled site, which is hosted in Dubai, to
check their own accounts.</TE>
<TE>   That mail-checking feature caught McWilliams' eye. On a whim, he
typed in the address for Hussein, press@uruklink.net, using "press"
for president, and tried "press" again as a possible password.</TE>
<TE>   Then he waited while his data bounced around the world.</TE>
<TE>   "It took a long time. I was about to hit stop, but then, boom! The
inbox appeared," McWilliams said.</TE>
<TE>   There's no way of knowing whether Hussein ever received any e-mail
addressed to him. The messages that filled McWilliams' screen were
sent between mid-June and mid-August, when the mailbox apparently
reached capacity. None of them had been read or replied to,
McWilliams said.</TE>
<TE>   "Whoever was responsible for checking the mail -- I'm sure it
wasn't him -- had fallen behind," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He has described his find in an October article on Wired News
online and has been written about in the International Herald
Tribune, but so far McWilliams hasn't heard anything from U.S.
authorities. He also has no plans to share his findings with the
government.</TE>
<TE>   Rob Nichols, a spokesman for the Treasury Department, which
enforces trade sanctions against Iraq, wouldn't comment on the
e-mails McWilliams found.</TE>
<TE>   The most disturbing messages appeared to be business proposals
from American companies, despite U.S. prohibitions against such
transactions, McWilliams said.</TE>
<TE>   He also found interview requests from journalists and obscene
messages from angry Americans.</TE>
<TE>   But the account also attracted admirers, including some who
requested signed photographs.</TE>

<HD>Last Battle in Bruising Political Season</HD>
<DH>Louisiana runoff for Senate seat is significant because the
GOP's new majority is so slim.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nick Anderson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>While the battle for control of the Senate ended Nov. 5 in Republican
triumph, a runoff election in Louisiana next month will punctuate the
tumultuous political year.</LD>
<LD>   Victory for the Democratic incumbent would raise a question mark
for the slim new GOP majority; victory for the Republican challenger
would give it an exclamation point.</LD>
<LD>   At stake in the Dec. 7 contest between Sen. Mary Landrieu, the
Democrat, and Republican Suzanne Haik Terrell is whether the GOP will
gain a crucial additional seat or whether Democrats will solidify
their minority with an important consolation win in the South.</LD>
<TE>   So far, Republicans are assured of 51 Senate seats when the new
Congress convenes in January and the Democrats of 47, plus the
support of a 48th who is independent.</TE>
<TE>   With the margin so close, and with Senate control seesawing in
recent years through deaths and political defection, the Louisiana
race for the 100th seat is all the more significant.</TE>
<TE>   Both parties are pouring money into the state in a final binge of
campaign spending for 2002, unchecked in this instance by the new ban
on unregulated "soft money" that affects all other national party
activities. The campaign finance law, which took effect Nov. 6,
exempts runoff elections.</TE>
<TE>   But despite the intense partisan warfare, Landrieu and Terrell are
fighting over relatively narrow political terrain.</TE>
<TE>   In a nationally televised debate Sunday, the two clashed over who
would provide a stronger voice for Louisiana in Washington -- a
Democratic moderate who frequently aligns with President Bush on
taxes, defense, social policy and foreign affairs or a Republican who
fully embraces the president's agenda.</TE>
<TE>   Questioned by Tim Russert on NBC's "Meet the Press," Landrieu
refused to rule out, or rule in, a vote next year to support making
Bush's tax cut permanent, one of the most vital economic and fiscal
issues facing the next Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, the $1.35-trillion tax cut, which Landrieu supported in
2001, is due to expire at the end of the decade.</TE>
<TE>   "I will vote to extend the tax cut if we can afford to do it,"
Landrieu said. But she added: "I don't know what we can afford right
now based on the fact that we don't know what this war on terrorism
is going to cost."</TE>
<TE>   Terrell said she would vote to remove the expiration date of Dec.
31, 2010, but she declined to say how much further tax cuts would
cost. She praised, however, a Bush proposal to privatize a portion of
the federal work force and save billions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   "Those are the kinds of things we're going to have to look at,"
Terrell said.</TE>
<TE>   The two candidates head into the runoff after Louisiana voters
sent conflicting signals in the Nov. 5 election. Under the state's
unusual laws, which allow the major parties to field multiple
candidates in a so-called jungle primary, the top two vote-getters in
a crowded field were forced into a second contest after none captured
a majority.</TE>
<TE>   Landrieu, who won 46% of the votes in a nine-candidate field, was
able to stake a solid claim as the front-runner. But Terrell, who got
27% and led two other GOP candidates, was able to make a credible
counterclaim: A majority of voters chose one of the Republicans over
the first-term incumbent.</TE>
<TE>   Landrieu, 47, is experienced in hard-fought campaigns. She beat a
Republican for an open seat in 1996 by only about 6,000 votes. Her
opponent appealed the result to the Senate, alleging election fraud,
but the claim was dismissed.</TE>
<TE>   Terrell, 48, is the state election commissioner. She was backed
this year by national Republicans as their best chance to unseat the
vulnerable incumbent. But GOP Gov. Mike Foster has so far declined to
endorse Terrell and has criticized her sharp-edged campaign attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Asked in the debate whether she would forgo further negative
television advertisements, Terrell said: "Mary has a negative record
for Louisiana. And that's what this is about."</TE>
<TE>   She contended that a vote for Landrieu would be a vote for
Democratic obstruction. "You don't have to be a roadblock with
[Democratic Sens.] Tom Daschle and Hillary [Rodham] Clinton to do
right by Louisiana," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Landrieu said she has given the state influence through service on
the Armed Services, Appropriations and Energy committees. She said
she had worked with Bush, toward the political center, without being
co-opted by Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to be a rubber stamp for any national party," she
said. "The president doesn't need ... another senator. Louisiana
needs another senator."</TE>
<TE>   The debate underscored friction points on cultural and economic
issues. On trade, for instance, Terrell was forced to explain how she
would handle a possible decision by the Bush administration to allow
greater imports of Mexican sugar into the United States --
potentially damaging a key Louisiana industry.</TE>
<TE>   On abortion, a difficult issue in a state with a strong Catholic
heritage, Terrell sought to establish herself as firmly against
abortion rights even though her name was listed some years ago as a
backer of a Planned Parenthood event.</TE>
<TE>   Terrell said she would support a constitutional amendment to ban
abortion. "I've never been pro-choice," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Landrieu gave a more nuanced position. She said she supports the
Supreme Court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade ruling upholding the legality of
abortion. But she said she would vote for a ban on the late-term
procedures that critics call partial-birth abortions.</TE>
<TE>   Landrieu contended that Terrell had flip-flopped on the issue.
Terrell, she said, "was pro-choice and now she is pro-life."</TE>
<TE>   The clash was significant because, with Republicans in control of
the Senate, Bush's judicial nominees are expected to have an easier
time getting through the nomination process. The president and Senate
Democrats would likely have an intense battle over the Supreme Court
if any of the nine justices retires.</TE>

<HD>Casino Builder Plays High-Stakes Game</HD>
<DH>With 10 homeowners refusing to sell, Steve Wynn says he'll
work around them as he builds the extravagant Le Reve resort.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tom Gorman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>Master resort builder Steve Wynn has little patience for people who
get in his way.</LD>
<LD>   Stephanie Swain has dared to, and now may be paying for it.</LD>
<LD>   She lives in Desert Inn Country Club Estates -- once one of the
most prestigious and pampered residential addresses in Las Vegas,
home to doctors and lawyers, entertainers and executives, politicians
and mobsters. Today she is one of 10 remaining homeowners who have
refused to sell their homes to Wynn to make room for his new resort
hotel and adjoining golf course.</LD>
<TE>   Earth movers already have begun churning up parts of the site's
existing golf course, revamping it for the resort. Wynn said he plans
to simply work around the 10 homes that sit alongside the distant
fairways.</TE>
<TE>   "For years, it was like we were living in Central Park, next door
to the Tavern on the Green," said Swain, the widow of a former casino
executive who was one of the estate's first homeowners in 1959. "If
[Wynn] continues at this [development] pace, he'll make these homes
uninhabitable."</TE>
<TE>   So be it, says Wynn, because what's at stake is the $2-billion,
45-story, 2,700-room Le Reve, expected to be the most extravagant and
expensive resort along the already over-the-top Strip. When it opens
in spring 2005, the resort will feature, among other highlights, a
Ferrari and Maserati dealership, a fine-arts gallery featuring
Picasso's Le Reve ("The Dream") and a tree-topped mountain nearly 100
feet high that will teasingly shield the hotel from the Strip and
serve as a backdrop for elaborate water and light shows for its
guests.</TE>
<TE>   The project is so highly anticipated here -- Las Vegas' economy is
driven by resort construction -- that both of Nevada's U.S. senators
attended Le Reve's Oct. 31 groundbreaking and sung Wynn's praises.</TE>
<TE>   For two years, Swain and other homeowners have been slapping Wynn
with lawsuits in an attempt to protect their homes and what remains
of their neighborhood. In the end, the remaining homes may end up
sandwiched between the existing brick walls that block busy streets
50 feet away and 20-foot-high landscaped berms being raised behind
their backyards to add dramatic topography to the links. A
greenskeeper's maintenance shed also may be constructed alongside one
of the homes.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't need her property. I don't want her property," Wynn said
of Swain. "We'll build the golf course around it. We can do anything
we want with the [remaining] property. We own it and have the
zoning."</TE>
<TE>   Wynn has a history of overcoming such obstructions -- one way or
another. When he bought land to build the side-by-side Mirage and
Treasure Island hotels, Wynn refused to pay an apartment building
owner the "gazillions of dollars" he said the man demanded for his
property on the site. So Wynn built around it and today the apartment
building is incongruously surrounded by parking structures and
asphalt.</TE>
<TE>   In a deposition for the homeowners' lawsuits, Wynn said the
apartment owner -- and now the homeowners alongside his golf course
-- are "a perfect example of blind greed, that if [a developer] with
money is your next-door neighbor, there must be a way to shake him
down for the bread."</TE>
<TE>   To build his new resort, Wynn bought the once-distinguished but
tired Desert Inn casino, resort and golf course for about $270
million in 2000. It's his first major project since selling his
Mirage Resorts casino corporation. While its chairman, he became the
most important developer of Strip hotels.</TE>
<TE>   There was some early outcry when he announced that he would buy
the properties adjoining the Desert Inn golf course and reconfigure
the land for the new resort, but most of the acquisitions went
smoothly.</TE>
<TE>   Among 60 homes, 29 already were owned by the Desert Inn and
included in the sale to Wynn. Fifteen homes were critical to Wynn
because they were along a cul-de-sac that penetrated the golf course.
He offered each homeowner $2 million, and each accepted.</TE>
<TE>   He told the remaining homeowners along the periphery of the course
that he would pay them 10% more than the higher of two appraisals of
their homes. All but 10 agreed, and theirs are the only homes still
standing today.</TE>
<TE>   Wynn said that he offered Swain a fair price for her house and
that Swain demanded much more. Swain acknowledges that she would sell
if the price was right, but won't discuss details.</TE>
<TE>   Among the issues in the pending lawsuits is whether Wynn, by
purchasing most of the homes in the subdivision, now controls its
homeowners association. The matter won't reach a judge until spring.
Making such a claim, Wynn has discontinued street cleaning and
landscaping of what little common grass areas still exist. The
homeowners can claim at least one small victory, however: A court
decision forced Wynn to help pay for the neighborhood's guarded gate,
which he had tried to dismantle.</TE>
<TE>   Wynn's chief counsel, Marc Rubinstein, considers the homeowners'
allegations a moot issue, in any event, because the residents concede
that Wynn now owns the golf course, which they had enjoyed for its
lush greenery just a block off the Strip.</TE>
<TE>   As construction gets underway, Swain and the others decry the
erection of a fence that they say maliciously blocks their views.
Rubinstein says the fence is required for safety.</TE>
<TE>   Some homeowners worry now that they've run out of options. "He's
not buying any more houses," said Sharon Greenbaum, who recalls the
days of living near Bobby Vinton, Engelbert Humperdinck, Louis Prima,
Harry James and Betty Grable. "This used to be such a prestigious
neighborhood, just a block off the Strip."</TE>
<TE>   Swain, who serves as the neighborhood spokeswoman, said she
doesn't object to having Le Reve as a neighbor. "I wouldn't mind
staying here and having Le Reve as a neighbor," Swain said. "But I
don't want to lose my view or our amenities," she said. "Steve Wynn
has forced me into a corner."</TE>

<HD>A Reckoning for Harm to Jews</HD>
<DH>The Vatican must repair damage from its hate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daniel Jonah Goldhagen</AU>
<BD>Daniel Jonah Goldhagen, an affiliate of Harvard's
Center for European Studies, is the author of "A Moral Reckoning: The
Role of the Catholic Church in the Holocaust and Its Unfulfilled Duty
of Repair" (Alfred A. Knopf, 2002).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Acknowledgment of wrongdoing in public life is hard to come by,
whether from culpable individuals or institutions. And it is rarely
accompanied by a principled discussion of what the culpable people or
institutions must do to repair the harm.</LD>
<LD>   Typically an apology is deemed sufficient. Pope John Paul II
offered words of remorse for the Catholic Church's role in the
Holocaust. Yet only in an amoral world, where the powerful set the
terms, would a few words be accepted as sufficient repair for
enormous crimes and injustices.</LD>
<LD>   Although the church did not cause the Holocaust, Pope Pius XII and
clergy across Europe inflicted catastrophic injuries on Jews.</LD>
<TE>   They spread the anti-Semitism from which Nazi anti-Semitism grew,
and that led millions to support the Nazis' criminal assault on the
Jews.</TE>
<TE>   They supported the criminal race laws and policies of Germany and
its allies.</TE>
<TE>   The Slovakian Catholic Church was complicit in the deportation of
Jews to Auschwitz. In Croatia, priests murdered Jews.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, the Vatican helped Adolf Eichmann, Dr. Josef
Mengele and many other Nazi mass murderers escape to South America.
The future Pope Paul VI helped lead the effort.</TE>
<TE>   The church owes a substantial duty of repair to Jews.</TE>
<TE>   Church doctrine supports this notion, holding, according to the
official Catechism of the Catholic Church, that "one must do what is
possible in order to repair" a wrong against one's neighbor: "return
stolen goods, restore the reputation of someone slandered, pay
compensation for injuries." The fullest repair is a "must," an
unavoidable moral duty.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from compensation, what are the universal principles of
repair? When applied to the Catholic Church, what concrete measures
do they produce?</TE>
<TE>   * Tell the full truth. The church must stop its aggressive
cover-up of 60 years, open its archives across Europe and commission
studies from independent scholars so the truth becomes known.</TE>
<TE>   * Combat the continuing effects of the harm. Despite some
progress, the church is still responsible for an enormous amount of
anti-Semitism. Research shows that tens of millions of European
Catholics still believe even the most damaging of age-old Christian
libels, that Jews today are guilty or cursed for the death of Jesus.
The church must institute extensive education programs in all
countries at all levels of schooling and for adults. It must teach
the falsity and perniciousness of such bigotry. It must, in the words
of the catechism, "restore the reputation of [the people] slandered."</TE>
<TE>   * Transform all the unwholesome internal features that led to the
harm so that the phrase "never again" is backed up by the necessary
changes. The church must stop being a political institution embodied
in the Vatican state, because that is antithetical to being a moral
institution. Its politics to extend its sovereignty over all Jews and
all humanity led it to harm Jews who only wanted to worship God in
their own way.</TE>
<TE>   The church also must stop spreading anti-Semitism in the Christian
Bible and its liturgy. Imagine if a book, given to 2 billion people
as the word of God, vilified blacks or Christians as children of the
devil, incapable of hearing God, guilty and cursed for all time for
the death of the son of God. People would be up in arms. Why should
it be different when the victims are Jews?</TE>
<TE>   The church must cease to pretend that its Bible does not spread
anti-Semitism, and it must take measures to ensure that it no longer
imparts such damaging prejudice.</TE>
<TE>   We need to make moral reckonings a standard part of our public
life and politics. The universal principles of repair are simple, yet
like many moral principles they have thoroughgoing good consequences.</TE>
<TE>   Applying this model of repair not just to the Holocaust but to all
instances where repair, especially by the powerful, is owed would
change the way many contemporary social and political issues -- not
only regarding the church but also, for example, the debts the United
States owes African Americans -- are approached. It would lead to
greater justice for the victimized, reduce ongoing harm and prevent
future injury.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Turns Its Back on Afghans, Again</HD>
<DH>Despite lofty talk, aid is nowhere to be seen outside
Kabul.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Andrew Lawler</AU>
<BD>Andrew Lawler is Boston correspondent for Science
magazine.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The governor of Ghazni, an Afghan province south of Kabul, is just
the kind of leader Washington should like. He's young, educated and
progressive. Haji Hassadullah Khalid studied political science before
the Taliban shut down Kabul University, speaks passable English and
dreams of studying in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   He is a striking contrast to the warlords, such as Abdul Rashid
Dostum, recently implicated in the deaths of Taliban prisoners, or
Ismail Khan, who pays little heed to Kabul's diktats.</LD>
<LD>   But Khalid gets no help from the U.S. One year after coming to
power, he says his people still must walk an average of three miles
just to get drinking water. He has no tax money to pay teachers. And
there is little support from the central government in Kabul.</LD>
<TE>   "This job is very difficult," he said, taking a break from the
endless stream of supplicants who come to his reception room.</TE>
<TE>   What about support from the United States? He shakes his head,
sighs and lights up another cigarette. "We've talked to USAID [U.S.
Agency for International Development], but we haven't received any
help yet."</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration pledged this month to try to do more to
rebuild Afghanistan, but help so far has been too little and too
late.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the heavily guarded walls of Khalid's residence, the burnt
fields, destroyed irrigation systems and virtually nonexistent roads
are mute testament to his helplessness. The drive from Kabul, once
smooth and easy, is now a harrowing four-hour ride. When Khalid
travels it, he does so only by day in a convoy with soldiers and
machine guns.</TE>
<TE>   He is struggling to control sporadic fighting across the
desperately poor province, often between rival Pashtun and Hazara
ethnic militants. In August, he was forced to place soldiers around
the United Nations relief ministry in his own provincial capital
after an armed robbery.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush last month ballyhooed the $588 million in
humanitarian assistance and reconstruction showered on Afghanistan
during the last year. Now the Pentagon promises to bring in a few
hundred more civilians to help. But put that in perspective: The
Pentagon spent nearly $15 billion on the war in that same period.</TE>
<TE>   The truth on the ground is even more alarming. Kabul is full of
European and Japanese aid workers, while American GIs are largely
confined to a military base north of the city.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond Kabul and its environs, there are few signs of foreign
assistance. In a recent two-week trip through central and south
Afghanistan, outside the relative safety of Kabul and the surrounding
area, I saw few signs of foreign aid.</TE>
<TE>   Groups of armed men, some in fatigues, some not, block what's left
of those roads between the major cities, demanding money. The only
road work I saw outside Kabul was being done by hundreds of people --
almost all children -- along desolate portions of the rutted roads.
As drivers approach, they throw a spadeful of dust into the ruts and
then hold out their hands for money.</TE>
<TE>   Given enough political and economic willpower, the U.S. could
rebuild the main roads, sink thousands of new wells and help
revitalize the devastated school and university systems. Instead, the
U.S. is training a much-needed national army but turning a blind eye
to broader reconstruction.</TE>
<TE>   We did it for Germany, but Afghanistan is yesterday's problem.
American statesman George Kennan foresaw the problem during World War
II, when he was assigned one summer to Baghdad. "Our government is
technically incapable of conceiving and promulgating a long-term
consistent policy toward areas remote from its own territory," he
wrote. The problem, he added, is that "our actions in the field of
foreign affairs are the convulsive reactions of politicians to an
internal political life dominated by vocal minorities."</TE>
<TE>   It was that lack of a long-term policy that led us to walk away
from Afghanistan in the early 1990s, after we had pumped the country
full of weapons to defeat the Soviets, leaving it in chaos and
eventually to Mullah Mohammed Omar and Osama bin Laden. Now we are
again moving on to other things, such as Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   A media darling just a few months ago -- remember reading about
his fabulous wardrobe? -- Hamid Karzai is out. Kurds are in. And
Khalid is left on his own.</TE>
<TE>   Didn't we learn the first time?</TE>

<HD>China Inc. Is Now Open for Business</HD>
<DH>New leaders confront daunting challenges amid rapid growth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kenneth Lieberthal</AU>
<BD>Kenneth Lieberthal, a professor of political science at
the University of Michigan, was senior director for Asia on the
National Security Council from 1998 to 2000.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>China's 16th Communist Party Congress has ended after anointing a new
group to lead the world's most populous and rapidly developing
country for the coming five years. Foreign media have noted the
significance of the first orderly, peaceful turnover of power at
China's top level in a century but have otherwise suggested that
little of importance has actually occurred. Yet, in fact, the
congress was the completion of Deng Xiaoping's victory over Mao
Tse-tung. This congress cleared away the remaining policy underbrush
from China's past communist aspirations.</LD>
<LD>   Mao spearheaded a revolution, while Deng sought a politically
viable way for China, like Japan and South Korea, to achieve
state-directed economic development.</LD>
<LD>   I heard a leading Chinese ambassador declare at a conference more
than a year ago that foreigners were mistaken to view China as
building socialism because the country now sought nothing so much as
to build capitalism.</LD>
<TE>   The 16th congress officially sanctified this goal, albeit to build
the kind of state-directed capitalism common in Asia and to wrap this
in a thin cloak of socialist rhetoric.</TE>
<TE>   The political succession is also notable. There is a broad
consensus among the leaders over the importance of economic
development and the overall need to strengthen market forces and
China's interaction with the international economy. But in the last
four months, the expected succession arrangements have changed
significantly.</TE>
<TE>   The basic shift was to stack the new nine-man Politburo Standing
Committee with Jiang Zemin proteges, two of whom (the recent heads of
Beijing and Shanghai municipalities) are surprise promotions. Jiang
apparently sees himself as emulating Deng's strategy of resigning
from top posts but continuing to guide policy for years to come. In
this sense, this succession is incomplete.</TE>
<TE>   Like Deng, Jiang is retaining his leadership of the Chinese
military. But Jiang lacks Deng's level of prestige and unquestioned
obedience. His touch will be less certain as he tries to maintain his
influence through his protege majority on the standing committee and
seriously hem in the few others, including new General Secretary Hu
Jintao, future Premier Wen Jiabao and head of domestic security Luo
Gan.</TE>
<TE>   Jiang's maneuvering has increased the chances of an unstable
leadership dynamic. Because Jiang will try to meddle from afar but
cannot simply dictate, there is now greater potential for political
infighting. For example, Hu has been a careful consensus builder, but
now that he has the top job he is likely to seek opportunities to
build real power to go with his title.</TE>
<TE>   Zeng Qinghong, who has been Jiang's key strategist since 1989, is
now in a position on the standing committee to spread his own
political wings. How Zeng plays the power game will markedly affect
both Hu and overall leadership cohesion.</TE>
<TE>   The leadership dynamics are important because China faces such a
daunting set of domestic challenges in the immediate future. The 16th
party congress has effectively declared that the main business of
China is business, and it stipulated continued rapid growth as its
top priority. Yet the new leaders face issues that will demand
extremely difficult trade-offs concerning speed, priorities and
approaches.</TE>
<TE>   Addressing the key issues China faces will in the short run make
economic growth more difficult and popular discontent more worrisome.
Those issues include implementing World Trade Organization-mandated
reforms to enhance the openness of China's market, reducing the size
and improving the efficiency of state-owned enterprises, absorbing an
additional 100 million migrants from the countryside in the coming
decade, developing a social safety net, addressing the huge overhang
of nonperforming loans in the state banks, bailing out largely
bankrupt county and township governments, reducing pervasive
corruption and investing in major environmental projects to meet
pressing needs. The concern must be that debates over how to deal
with these matters will become caught up in the leadership's own
maneuvering over power and position, reducing the cooperation
necessary to reach and implement good decisions.</TE>
<TE>   In this situation, the quality and cohesion of the new leadership
can make a decisive difference. The incompleteness of this peaceful
and orderly leadership succession may yet come back to haunt Beijing.</TE>

<HD>What Does It Profit a Man to Gain an MBA?</HD>
<DH>Business schools must stress ethics, and saying 'Stop.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas K. Lindsay</AU>
<BD>Thomas K. Lindsay is provost of the University of
Dallas. E-mail: lindsay@udallas.edu</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's becoming a regular feature on the news to see handcuffed
executives being carted off to face criminal charges. Why, we wonder,
was no one along the chain of command at Enron, WorldCom, Global
Crossing, Tyco, Arthur Andersen or any of the others able to muster
the moral courage to say "Stop"?</LD>
<LD>   For many, including President Bush, the cure for our ethical ills
is education. Bush is right that there is much more that we in the
academy can do to foster ethical leadership.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, however, business education in this country is
devoted overwhelmingly to technical training. This is ironic, because
even before Enron, studies showed that executives who fail --
financially as well as morally -- rarely do so from a lack of
technical expertise. Rather, they fail because they lack
interpersonal skills and practical wisdom; what Aristotle called
prudence.</LD>
<TE>   Aristotle taught that genuine leadership consisted in the ability
to identify and serve the common good. To do so requires much more
than technical training. It requires an education in moral reasoning,
which must include history, philosophy, literature, theology and
logic; that is, a liberal arts education.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last half-century, we academics have forgotten a
centuries-tested truth: A liberal arts education fosters ethical
leadership as no other training can because it gives students the
life-transforming exercise of engaging in conversations with
history's greatest thinkers and doers.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, one thing that has distinguished those great leaders has
been their ardent study of those who preceded them. Alexander the
Great was a passionate student of the exploits of his role model,
Homer's Achilles. In turn, Julius Caesar patterned his ambitions
after those of Alexander the Great.</TE>
<TE>   Among the members of the founding generation of the United States,
Plutarch's "Lives of the Noble Greeks and Romans" was second only to
the Bible in readership. Lincoln credited the Bible, Shakespeare and
the Declaration of Independence as his teachers.</TE>
<TE>   As a young man, Winston Churchill read and embraced Aristotle's
"Nicomachean Ethics." This work contains the famous description of
the "magnanimous man," whose vision is so grand that for him, even
great honors are a "small thing." Such greatness of soul explains
Churchill's moral capacity in the 1930s -- when he was out of office,
discredited and ridiculed -- to stand up and rouse a slumbering world
to the coming danger of Nazism.</TE>
<TE>   History's great authors and leaders do not always agree on what
constitutes leadership. But it is in studying the disagreements that
students can gain the maturity necessary to become genuine leaders.</TE>
<TE>   What is the just society? What is human excellence? What do the
individual and the community owe each other? Wrestling with the
greats over these questions forces students to examine and defend
their own beliefs and thus develop the breadth, depth, creativity and
vision to face today's complex ethical dilemmas.</TE>
<TE>   These exercises find their analogy in athletics; you play just as
you practice. Currently, business education compels students to spend
95% of their time learning how to calculate with a view to maximizing
wealth. Just 5% of their time -- usually no more than a half-semester
course -- is spent developing their moral capacities. Should we be
surprised at students' priorities after they graduate?</TE>
<TE>   At the University of Dallas, we have begun a business degree
program that marries technical courses with the liberal arts. At the
heart of this novel marriage stand the intellectual and ethical
exercises I've just described. We hope the program will not remain
novel for long.</TE>
<TE>   Most of all, we hope that if, somewhere down the road, one of our
graduates finds herself in the midst of a potential Enron, she
remembers her Aristotle and cries "Stop."</TE>

<LD>The flippant conversations of energy company employees caught on tape
just weeks before the California energy crisis exploded underscore
the painfully obvious: Energy-generating and trading companies used
deception, half-truths and outright lies to rig the power market and
boost corporate profit.</LD>
<LD>   The telephone recordings -- in which Williams Cos. employees seem
well aware that generating plants were being taken offline just to
raise prices -- are described in a troubling Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission report released Friday. The recordings
illustrate why federal regulators must abandon the hands-off policies
that allowed the California energy meltdown -- and could easily allow
another one.</LD>
<LD>   Energy company executives and federal regulators ridiculed Gov.
Gray Davis last year for describing energy traders as "gougers" and
"pirates." But it's increasingly simple to connect the growing number
of dots to prove Davis right.</LD>
<TE>   Start with in-your-face trading schemes with such names as Death
Star and Fat Boy that energy traders used to manipulate the markets.
Consider the lawsuits California and Nevada recently filed against
natural gas companies for allegedly restricting supplies in order to
push up energy prices.</TE>
<TE>   Think of the Enron Corp. trader who on Oct. 17 pleaded guilty to
conspiring to inflate power prices. Keep tracking the federal grand
jury investigation into the energy crisis that already has produced
subpoenas for Williams, Enron, Dynegy, Duke Energy and other energy
traders.</TE>
<TE>   Go online (www.ferc.gov) and read the troubling report that
chronicles conversations a Williams employee had with a power plant
operator about methods of boosting profit. The conversations describe
the long plant shutdowns and continuous repairs as "weird," "pretty
wild" and "kinda interesting."</TE>
<TE>   As the paper trail grows, so does the list of highflying energy
trading companies that have crashed. Pacific Gas &amp; Electric's energy
trading operation is on the ropes. El Paso Corp., Dynegy and Williams
are eliminating or cutting back their trading arms. One electric
industry observer quipped that "it's like economic McCarthyism out
there: 'I am not now nor have I ever been an energy trader.' " What
may also be true is that stand-alone energy traders can't make money
in an honest market.</TE>
<TE>   But identifying the villains isn't enough. California has to build
more power plants and fix its flawed attempt at deregulation.
Prosecutors must continue to track down those who manufactured the
crisis. FERC should be active in policing the power industry and
vigorously help California get refunds for expensive, long-term power
contracts that were negotiated while the state was in the
stranglehold of cheaters.</TE>
<TE>   Now that would be kinda wild.</TE>

<LD>Jerel Shaffer and Earl Goen, two American citizens working at an oil
rig in Venezuela, were kidnapped for ransom in 1997 by the Marxist
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. Shaffer was brutally
tortured and freed only after paying his captors a million dollars.
Goen was released shortly after the kidnapping. The following year,
four American bird-watchers were kidnapped and killed by the same
guerrilla group. And while these despicable acts were taking place,
Jorge Briceno, the top military commander of the FARC, was allegedly
conspiring to export cocaine to the United States.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft has issued three separate
indictments against people accused of crimes against Americans, just
the latest in a series of U.S. indictments of Colombians. Carlos
Castano, the head of the right-wing United Self-Defense Forces of
Colombia, was indicted in September.</LD>
<LD>   It would have been better if the Colombian justice system had made
arrests in these extremist crimes. After all, the FARC has been
inflicting mayhem for nearly 40 years. Drug trafficking, and all the
violence it entails, has bled Colombia for decades. And only last
year more than 3,000 people were taken hostage. Most of the criminals
remain at large due to inefficient law enforcement and corrupt or
intimidated judges.</LD>
<TE>   In the last four years, the U.S. government has shown strong
interest in helping Colombia to break free from the drug cartels and
end the scourge of lawlessness. A new chapter of U.S. aid to Colombia
in prosecuting those who attack American citizens is now being
written, and so far Washington's tactics seem to have produced
positive results.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of Castano, the paramilitary commander, the U.S.
indictment has deepened divisions within the paramilitary groups,
mainly between those who want to profit from the drug trade and those
who might severe their ties to drug dealers because of fear of
extradition to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Some in Colombia have criticized the American indictments, arguing
that they effectively close the door to future peace negotiations
between the government and the FARC. We beg to differ.</TE>
<TE>   For almost four decades, many Colombians have naively lived under
the illusion that the FARC will eventually find a reason to sit down
and discuss peace. History has proved them wrong. The only way to
make the FARC negotiate a lasting peace is by making the cost of war
too high. Reminding extremists that a possible trial and prison time
awaits them in the U.S. may be the only way to make them cry uncle.</TE>

<HD>The Heat Is on Iran's Clerics</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Iran is in ferment. Students and political reformers who oppose the
ruling hard-line Muslim clerics have been galvanized by the mullahs'
death sentence against a popular professor who challenged their
authority. The peaceful protests sweeping university campuses seem on
the verge of leading to something bigger. The United States needs to
be ready to welcome change in Iran, possibly sooner rather than
later.</LD>
<LD>   The sentence against Hashem Aghajari, a historian and politician
who is allied with reformist President Mohammad Khatami, has sparked
fury.</LD>
<LD>   In June, Aghajari delivered a speech in Hamadan, the historic
center of Iran, that asserted that interpretations of the Koran by
past clerics did not have to be seen as sacred--a direct challenge to
the Islamic rulers of Iran who insist on unwavering adherence to
medieval Islam.</LD>
<TE>   The clerics, who are constantly looking for ways to diminish the
elected Khatami, pounced, ruling it blasphemy against the prophet
Muhammad. In Iran, that's a hanging offense.</TE>
<TE>   The protests reflect widespread revulsion toward the iron-handed
clerics among those born after the 1979 Islamic revolution. In 1997
and 2001, reformers scored big in parliamentary elections. The hope
of the reformers is to ease Iran's international isolation, stimulate
the economy and soften stringent dress codes for women, but their
efforts have been blocked by the veto powers of the clerics.</TE>
<TE>   The often-timid Khatami has begun to go on the offensive,
introducing legislation last month challenging the broad, secretive
powers of the cleric-controlled judiciary, which has repeatedly
jailed politicians, journalists and others deemed subversive. One
bill would permit him to revoke any judicial decision he sees as
unconstitutional, including sentences like the one against his ally
Aghajari.</TE>
<TE>   Khatami's hand may be strengthened enough by the demonstrations to
force his enemies to accept curbs on their powers. Indeed, so
egregious is the sentence against Aghajari that even the Basik, or
volunteer Islamic militia, expressed doubts about it. Aghajari has
declined to challenge the verdict, putting additional pressure on the
government to repeal the sentence or face bigger protests.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling theocracy can't win. If it executes the courageous
professor, Khatami can claim him as a martyr. If the clerics back
down, reformists likewise will be strengthened. Either way, the
struggle reveals an Iran immensely more complex and hopeful than the
label "axis of evil" would imply.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Senate OKs Broad Waiver for Pentagon on Migratory Birds," Nov.
14: Neither President Bush nor those whom he surrounds himself with
have ever shown concern for the home we all share, planet Earth. But
now, in the guise of defense, comes another piece of legislation
proving not merely callousness but total blindness. The U.S. military
will be allowed to bomb areas on which migratory birds, some already
endangered, depend for survival.</LD>
<LD>   Kill, kill, kill is the refrain. Frogs, whales, dolphins, birds,
etc. The circle of life has been ripped and has given way to a
murderous ellipse, the apogee of which was reached when a nameless
government lawyer stated that the forthcoming bird kill should be
appreciated by bird-watchers who "get more enjoyment spotting a rare
bird than they do spotting a common one." I'm sick with disgust.</LD>
<LD>   Michele Mooney</LD>
<TE>   Van Nuys</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Judge Emmet G. Sullivan was justified in reprimanding the Defense
Department and its lawyer for using the argument that bird lovers
would benefit when the military kills birds because "bird-watchers
get more enjoyment spotting a rare bird than they do spotting a
common one." Is this really the level of thinking of our Defense
Department?</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the government lawyer should start hitting himself on the
head so he can realize the enjoyment when he stops.</TE>

<HD>Does Bin Laden Speak on Behalf of Islam?</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I am concerned that the recent recording by Osama bin Laden has been
greeted with silence throughout Islam (Nov. 13). When Christian
fundamentalists make statements that are far less incendiary, they
are faced with a barrage of condemnation from across Christianity and
often forced to publicly retract their statements. When Bin Laden
celebrates the mayhem he has financed, the entire Islamic world
apparently falls silent. Either Al Qaeda acts on behalf of Islam or
it does not; either Bin Laden speaks for Islam or he does not. Bin
Laden envisions establishing a new caliphate, and one senses all of
Islam holding its breath. Only those who believe in Islam can decide
this, and regardless of whether they affirm or condemn Bin Laden and
his minions, their silence reflects their fear at making the choice
-- their unwillingness to accept the consequences of either embracing
or rejecting Bin Laden. It is long past time for the choice to be
made. Made clearly. Repeatedly. Made loudly, no matter what that
choice may be.</LD>

<LD>In "Tech Invention, Shoplifting Trial Set Hedy Lamarr Apart" (Nov.

Czech movie "Ecstasy." Boy, that triggered memories. In my day,
ticket-takers at movie houses were less vigilant. One Saturday
afternoon, at age 7, a few of us shoeshine lads were allowed entry at
the old Joy in the Lincoln Heights area of Los Angeles for only 10
cents to see "Ecstasy." I have always wondered what rating it would
have received and what reviews it would have garnered.</LD>
<LD>   Anyway, we saw it four times. We asked for a partial refund since
we never saw the second feature, announced on the marquee: "For
Adults Only." Again, memories!</LD>

<LD>John Balzar's Nov. 13 commentary, "Sorry, but the Economy Is No
Longer in Service," completely misses the point. He's trying to
measure 21st century productivity by the standards of the Groucho
Marx era. It took me 58 seconds to find the address, phone number,
driving directions and links for special events at each location for
two outlets of a major book chain in Long Beach and one in Lakewood.
If I didn't need to have the book immediately, I could have placed an
order for the book online and had it delivered to my doorstep in as
little as one business day -- and I would have been immediately
advised of its availability.</LD>
<LD>   Now that is a clear improvement in productivity. The whole
approach to accomplishing the task has changed, and it is
counterproductive to use 1940s' techniques to measure 21st century
productivity. Yes, people with low levels of skills have been
replaced, but by fewer people with a much higher skill level and at
higher levels of compensation. Even Groucho Marx would have seen it
had he opened his eyes.</LD>

<HD>Flawed Argument on Indian Casinos as 'Reparations'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fred Dickey's Nov. 13 commentary, "Indian Casinos Open Way for Black
Reparations," had an interesting premise but distorts history and the
law in order to attack Indian gaming. As a professor of law, I have
taught that Indian law is a complex and fluid area of law, but to
claim that reservations and the right to have casinos are some kind
of gift from the non-Indian governments is incorrect.</LD>
<LD>   Reservations were what remained after Europeans stole the other
99% of the land. They were used to attempt to force sedentary and
agricultural lifestyles upon people who fished and hunted and traded
over large geographic areas. And most land on reservations today is
owned by non-Indians.</LD>
<LD>   Regulation of Indian affairs by local, state and federal
governmental entities varies according to such factors as the type of
commerce, the tribal status of the parties and the location of the
commerce. Indian sovereignty may be limited by conquest, but it is
alive and well, as it should be. I'd rather have casinos providing
free education, health care, housing and economic-development aid to
Indian people than have them on welfare.</LD>
<TE>   Jack Schwartz</TE>

<TE>   Dickey draws a false analogy between granting Indian tribes the
right to run casinos and paying reparations to African Americans.
Casinos are businesses, however socially harmful, not mere handouts.
A valid analogy would exist if the federal government had written
every American Indian a check for, say, $100,000.</TE>
<TE>   Barry Freedman</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dickey had better revisit history if he thinks that "the
reservation system was instituted to give tribes a haven from
exploitation by non-Indians." Is the ghetto a haven? If he wishes to
receive empathy for his cause he will not get it via lack of research
and insulting those who have endured.</TE>
<TE>   George A. Renville</TE>
<TE>   Claremont</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dickey's column is flawed. Only a small part of the Native
American population benefits from casino money. One only needs to
drive through Plains reservations to see widespread poverty,
alcoholism, etc., and the real truth. Native Americans have never
asked for reparations; they only want us to honor the treaties we
signed.</TE>

<HD>Message to Democrats: It's Still the Economy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I haven't had this much fun reading Letters to The Times since the
last presidential election. Back then it was all of the partisan
letters about Al Gore and George W. Bush. Now it's the Republicans
thinking they have a mandate and the Democrats thinking they have to
retool.</LD>
<LD>   If the Republicans think they have a mandate they are banking on
Bush's own "fuzzy math." If Sen. Paul Wellstone hadn't died just
before the election and if the Democrats could have pulled off just
one of the close elections they lost (e.g., Missouri), where would
the Republican mandate be? Of course that didn't happen, so now the
Democrats think they have to figure out something else to run on for
the 2004 elections. Let it be said here, and not for the first time,
that the Democrats have nothing to fear in two years: It will still
be the economy, stupid, regardless of what President Bush does with
regard to Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   I've been proven wrong before, but I just can't see the electorate
making the same mistake twice. Iraq or any terrorist group that
President Bush deems at fault won't be responsible for the continuing
decline of the American economy -- Bush will.</LD>
<TE>   Mark Skurnik</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In his Nov. 14 letter, Elmer Richardson uses the GOP's often-used,
supposedly damning, phrase "tax and spend" to bad-mouth the
Democrats. When it comes to true fiscal conservatism, I would wager
that any economist worth his salt would rate the Democrats far more
fiscally conservative than the Republicans and their years of "borrow
and spend." The $3-trillion national debt left by President Reagan
after his eight years in office still remains unpaid, and it's
obvious that President Bush is hell-bent on increasing it. True
conservatives pay their bills and do not borrow.</TE>

<TE>   Re "House Democrats Make History in Electing Pelosi," Nov. 15: San
Francisco Rep. Nancy Pelosi's ascendance to Democratic minority
leader in the House is the second shoe dropping in an ominous and
dangerous dance of national leadership spinning outward away from the
middle ground that is the bedrock of American values and
inclinations. The Democrats are refusing to aggressively confront the
perpetrators of global terrorism by moving further to the left, while
the Republicans refuse to inject fiscal medicine into a degenerating
economy. Meanwhile, the American public is so centrist that the
midterm elections were still another vote mainly for a 50/50 split.
Woe to the deserted center for common sense!</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nothing is so myopic as a partisan point of view. This is
evidenced by Michael Ramirez's political cartoon (Commentary, Nov.
14) depicting Pelosi as too far to the left. Obviously he has been
blind for years to the more-than-far-right position of House Majority
Whip Tom DeLay (R-Texas). This guy makes Pat Buchanan seem calm and
reasonable. But political cartoonists have to make a living, and who
would buy Ramirez's doodles if he bothered to check his memory banks?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Steve Lopez's Nov. 13 column, "Seeing the Light and Saying So Long to
All That Negativity," posed a question. My answer is that it's the
"smear squad." I am struck by the treatment given the Richard Riordan
and Eli Broad secret offer (is it really secret?) to Ted Mitchell,
the president of Occidental College, and Occidental College itself.
Lopez suggested that Riordan and Broad "believe so strongly they know
better than us rubes what's in our best interest, they're willing to
trample democracy to have their way." I don't know about rubes, but I
do know that everybody has the right, even Riordan and Broad, to
persuade someone to run for elected office. We still get to vote,
don't we? As a parent with children enrolled in the L.A. Unified
School District, I like the idea of the president of Occidental
College on the LAUSD board.</LD>

<HD>Samuel Neaman, 89; Retailer Backed Israel's Development</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Myrna Oliver</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Samuel Neaman, a philanthropist and former retailing manager of
department store chains who encouraged innovation by rank-and-file
employees and demanded devotion to the job, has died. He was 89.</LD>
<LD>   Neaman died Wednesday of unspecified causes at his home in
Oceanside, Calif., where he had lived in retirement for the last
decade.</LD>
<LD>   For the last quarter-century, Neaman had concentrated primarily on
charity. His major beneficiary was the Technion-Israel Institute of
Technology in Haifa, Israel, where he endowed the Samuel Neaman
Institute for Advanced Studies in Science and Technology in 1978. He
was president and board vice chairman of the American Technion
Society and was deputy chairman of the international board of the
institute, which five years ago awarded him the Technion Medal.</LD>
<TE>   Born in Israel before it was a country, Neaman lived in London and
served in the British Army during World War II.</TE>
<TE>   After Israel became independent from Britain, he came to the U.S.
selling bonds and seeking American investment to foster businesses in
the new state.</TE>
<TE>   "Our problem now is to make Israel self-supporting according to a
master plan. In a small country this is only possible with a very
efficient industry," he told The Times in 1949 when he came to Los
Angeles to meet with businessmen. "The only place we can come to
learn the know-how is the United States. This isn't a compliment; it
is a well-known fact."</TE>
<TE>   Neaman gained international business acumen managing his family's
knitting company in Paris, starting his own blouse-making company in
England and running a steel mill in Mexico. In 1962, he went to work
for Meshulam Riklis, a post-war takeover artist who controlled the
conglomerate Rapid-American Corp.</TE>
<TE>   As hands-on manager of Riklis' companies, Neaman ran such chains
of stores as McCrory's, S. Klein, Lerner's, Best &amp; Co. and J.J.
Newberry.</TE>
<TE>   Neaman made the McCrory's variety store chain essentially his own
-- turning loss to profit in his first year, cutting inventory by 50%
and challenging and prodding employees to take responsibility for
merchandising. A workaholic with a big ego, Neaman expected his staff
members to put the company before their personal lives.</TE>
<TE>   The manager's expertise -- and weaknesses -- were described at
length by author Isadore Barmash in his 1976 book "For the Good of
the Company" and cited in the 1982 best-selling book by Thomas J.
Peters and Robert H. Waterman Jr., "In Search of Excellence."</TE>
<TE>   Neaman stated his management philosophy in a 126-word credo
mailed, along with a photo of himself, to 3,000 McCrory's executives.
Barmash wrote that the statement smacked of "the kibbutz mentality,
of a socialistic approach to achievement ... of a Big Brother
attitude."</TE>
<TE>   The mission statement of sorts by Neaman included such wording,
for example, as : "We believe in the effectiveness of the multitude
-- a great many normal people with normal talents working together
supporting and compensating each other. We believe in guided
autonomy."</TE>
<TE>   As McCrory's and other pieces of the Riklis empire faltered in
1974, Neaman agreed to an arrangement, engineered by Riklis, to
resign and become chairman of Interstate Stores Inc., which was
trying to acquire parts of McCrory's and S. Klein. But the deal fell
through, and Neaman, then 61, simply faded from the front lines of
business.</TE>
<TE>   Widowed in 1999, Neaman is survived by a brother, Yfrah of London.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Natalie Grant Wraga, 101, a native of czarist Russia who became an
expert in unmasking Soviet deception methods for the U.S. State
Department, died Tuesday at her home near Washington, D.C.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Tallinn, the daughter of a judge, she fled with her family
to escape the Soviet revolution of 1917. After dropping out of
college, she worked with U.S. diplomats in Latvia from 1928 to 1939
and in Switzerland during World War II. Later, she moved to the U.S.
and worked as a Sovietologist at the State Department in the 1950s
and with the Hoover Institution at Stanford University in the 1960s.</LD>
<LD>   Widowed in 1968, Wraga settled in the Washington area and wrote
"Window on Russia," a book about the formation of U.S. foreign policy
toward Russia in the 1920s and 1930s. She remained a consultant to
the State Department and spoke widely on Soviet disinformation.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Hussein Bicar, 89, Egypt's popular portrait artist and painter, died
Saturday in Cairo of what his wife, Asema, described as old age.</LD>
<LD>   Born in 1913 in Alexandria, Egypt, Bicar graduated from Cairo's
School of Fine Arts in 1933 and taught in Morocco. From there, he
traveled extensively in Europe, gaining inspiration for his drawings.</LD>
<LD>   Adept at drawing for children, Bicar also became a foreign
correspondent who wrote and illustrated stories of his travels. He
produced sketches of news and feature subjects when photography was
not common in his homeland.</LD>
<TE>   In his later years, Bicar was better known for painting portraits,
particularly of women. He also wrote criticism and taught for many
years at Cairo's Fine Arts Academy, where he advised students that
the eye alone cannot catch the complex feelings in a painting. "You
must think to understand," he said. "You must go beyond the surface."</TE>

<HD>Charles Dupuis, 84; Publisher of Smurfs, Other Comic Strips</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Charles Dupuis, 84, whose family printing house was behind the
success of comic-strip characters including the Smurfs, died Thursday
of unstated causes in his hometown of Marcinelle, Belgium.</LD>
<LD>   In 1938, Dupuis' publisher father, Jean, created a comic book
called Spirou to compete throughout Belgium with such Disney imports
as Mickey Mouse translated into French.</LD>
<LD>   Charles Dupuis increased the production of comics by hiring
cartoonists who became stars in a country that reveres the comic
strip as a serious art form. Among those he encouraged were Peyo, who
drew the Smurfs; and Morris, who created Lucky Luke.</LD>
<TE>   Under Charles Dupuis' guidance, the family publishing company
expanded after World War II, moving successfully into comic-strip
albums and animated films for cinema and television. He retired in
1985 when the family sold the firm.</TE>

<HD>Jack Solomon, 89; Movie Sound Artist Won Academy Award</HD>
<DH>He worked with Barbra Streisand and Frank Sinatra, and did
sound for the film about jazz drummer Gene Krupa.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Myrna Oliver</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jack Solomon, who shared with Murray Spivack the first Academy Award
given to individuals for sound in 1969 for the motion picture version
of "Hello Dolly," has died. He was 89.</LD>
<LD>   Solomon died Nov. 8 in Los Angeles of complications following
heart surgery.</LD>
<LD>   Something of a legend in his industry, Solomon worked on sound for
60 motion pictures during his 50-year career. In 1992, he received
the Life Achievement Award from the Cinema Audio Society.</LD>
<TE>   Even after "talkies" replaced silent movies in the late 1920s,
sound was considered the poor relation of the movie-making process.
From 1929 until Solomon and Spivack broke the mold 40 years later,
Academy Awards for sound were handed out, not to the individuals who
did the work, but to the studio that produced the film.</TE>
<TE>   Solomon, who elevated sound-making and mixing to an art form,
worked on several films nominated for Oscars. But he finally won the
official recognition -- and the statuette -- along with Spivack in
1969 for Barbra Streisand's mega-musical film version of "Hello
Dolly!"</TE>
<TE>   The sound man seemed a favorite of musicians -- in addition to the
Oscar winner, he handled sound mixing for other Streisand movies,
including "Funny Girl," "The Way We Were" and "Funny Lady."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in his career, Solomon worked with Frank Sinatra in "The
Man with the Golden Arm" and "Four for Texas," and he handled the
sound for the biopic about the jazz drummer "The Gene Krupa Story"
starring Sal Mineo.</TE>
<TE>   Solomon also was in great demand for action films, working on at
least four with Burt Reynolds -- "Smokey and the Bandit II," "The
Cannonball Run," "Sharkey's Machine" and "Stroker Ace" -- and capping
his career with the 1992 "Patriot Games" starring Harrison Ford.</TE>
<TE>   Among Solomon's other notable feature credits were "The Graduate"
in 1967 and the 1976 remake of "King Kong."</TE>
<TE>   Solomon also did work for television, including movies and the
1985-86 series "Morningstar/Eveningstar" about a merged orphanage and
old folks' home, which provided him with the challenge of meshing
high-pitched children's voices with deeper tones from senior
citizens.</TE>
<TE>   Solomon is survived by two daughters, Kay Solomon and Trish Dunne;
and four grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Memorial services are scheduled at 11 a.m. Saturday at the First
Lutheran Church, 815 Venice Blvd. The family has asked that, instead
of flowers, memorial contributions be made to the Scripps Research
Institute, 10550 Torrey Pines Road, Mail Drop TPC2, La Jolla, CA
92037.</TE>

<HD>Bali Suspects Tied to Other Blasts</HD>
<DH>The techno-savvy group of six Indonesians has been linked
to deadly church attacks in 2000. The leader may have trained in
Afghanistan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard C. Paddock</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>KUTA, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>KUTA, Indonesia -- Last month's deadly bombing on the island of Bali
was carried out by a computer-savvy group of Indonesian Muslims with
links to previous anti-Christian terror attacks, police said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Providing the most comprehensive picture to date of the group
believed responsible for the Oct. 12 attack that killed 191 people,
police said the operational leader was a university-trained engineer
known as Imam Samudra, who probably learned to make bombs in
Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   Police Brig. Gen. I Made Mangku Pastika, who is heading the
investigation, released sketches and photographs of six suspects,
including Samudra, whom he described as the "highly mobile field
commander" of the attack.</LD>
<TE>   Pastika said he believes all six are still in Indonesia and
appealed to the public to report their whereabouts.</TE>
<TE>   The general said Samudra was a "calm" and "intellectual" man who
stayed in Bali for four days after the attack to see what police were
learning. He has almost always been seen wearing a hat and carrying a
laptop computer case, Pastika said.</TE>
<TE>   Other alleged participants in the plot include a "genius"
electronics expert and bomb maker, a teacher at an Islamic school who
buried a stash of automatic weapons in the woods near his village and
a graduate of an Islamic school in Malaysia who rented a room in Bali
for the group to assemble the bombs. Two of the six are Indonesians
of Arab descent.</TE>
<TE>   Samudra, who was born Abdul Azis, has used at least eight names,
police say.</TE>
<TE>   "They change their names every time," Pastika said. "For one
operation, one name."</TE>
<TE>   Samudra has been wanted by Indonesian authorities since early last
year for his alleged role in the bombing of two dozen churches on
Christmas Eve 2000. Nineteen people in 10 cities died in those
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Indonesian police have arrested radical Islamic cleric Abu Bakar
Bashir in connection with the same church bombings. Bashir denies any
part in terrorism but is accused of heading Jemaah Islamiah, a
regional terror network believed responsible for numerous attacks in
at least three countries.</TE>
<TE>   Police have yet to produce evidence that Bashir and Samudra know
each other, but Samudra's role in the Bali bombing could be pivotal.
Pastika said police are searching for the "missing link" that could
tie Bashir to the bombing participants.</TE>
<TE>   Police said earlier this year that Samudra had conspired to carry
out the church bombings with Riduan Isamuddin, a close associate of
Bashir better known as Hambali. He is believed to be Jemaah
Islamiah's operations leader and a top Al Qaeda operative who has
masterminded terror attacks in Southeast Asia for nearly a decade.</TE>
<TE>   In a February interview, police Brig. Gen. Saleh Saaf described
Samudra and Hambali as "one team."</TE>
<TE>   Pastika said Samudra went to Afghanistan during the Soviet
occupation and again during the mid-1990s. Samudra also reportedly
visited Malaysia while Bashir and Hambali were living there in
self-imposed exile and may have met them there.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'Soft' Targets</TE>
<TE>   Police suspect that Hambali initiated the Bali bombing. According
to a recent report in the Asian Wall Street Journal, he convened a
meeting of Jemaah Islamiah leaders in southern Thailand in January
and ordered them to attack "soft" targets, such as nightclubs
frequented by Westerners.</TE>
<TE>   Police say they got their biggest break in the Bali investigation
when they traced the chassis number of the minivan used in the attack
and arrested the owner, Amrozi, a co-founder and part-time teacher at
the Al-Islam boarding school in the East Java village of Tenggulun.</TE>
<TE>   Amrozi confessed that he participated in the Bali bomb plot and
told police that he began helping Samudra acquire materials to make
bombs in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   According to the police, Amrozi said the two first met to plan the
Bali attack on Aug. 2 in the Central Java town of Solo. Amrozi
reportedly said Samudra instructed him to buy the minivan and
chemicals for the attack and deliver them to Bali.</TE>
<TE>   The money to pay for the materials was delivered by a suspect
named Idris, also known as Jhoni Endrawan, who was the deputy leader
of the group and took charge of logistical arrangements and
disbursing cash, police say.</TE>
<TE>   This month, police focused their investigation on the Al-Islam
school in Tenggulun, which they said was the headquarters of the Bali
plot.</TE>
<TE>   But police now say the main suspects are seven militants from
different parts of Indonesia, including two affiliated with the
school -- Amrozi and his brother, Ali Imron, an Al-Islam teacher who
allegedly buried automatic weapons and ammunition in PVC pipes
nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Police are looking for at least two more of Amrozi's brothers
connected with the school, including Gufron, a radical Islamic
teacher who allegedly helped inspire Amrozi to embrace extremist
views. By some accounts, Gufron, also known as Mukhlas, is a top
Jemaah Islamiah leader.</TE>
<TE>   Pastika said police reconstructed the Bali attack and concluded
that three bombs went off within 11 seconds of one another, two in
the beach town of Kuta and one in the provincial capital, Denpasar.</TE>
<TE>   Three cellular phones allegedly were rigged as detonators and were
triggered by text messages from another cell phone.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators had said that Ali Imron was the one who detonated
the bombs, but police now believe it was a member of the group known
as Dulmatin, an electronics expert considered by his junior high
school teachers to be a genius.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Three Explosions</TE>
<TE>   Pastika said the first bomb was delivered to Paddy's Irish Club by
Umar, a Muslim from the island of Flores. He allegedly walked into
the bar with the bomb and left it there minutes before the attack. It
killed eight people when it exploded at 11:08 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Six seconds later, a huge bomb in Amrozi's minivan exploded across
the street outside the Sari Club, destroying both nightclubs and two
dozen nearby buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Five seconds later, a bomb exploded in Denpasar outside the
honorary U.S. Consulate there. Pastika said that the bomb might have
caused serious damage but that the bombers could not get close to the
consulate that evening because of a motorcycle race. The bomb
exploded outside the consulate wall, and no one was injured.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>North Korea's state-run radio reported for the first time that the
country has nuclear arms, but South Korean officials doubted the
report's credibility.</LD>
<LD>   Pyongyang Radio said the country "has come to have nuclear and
other strong military weapons due to nuclear threats by U.S.
imperialists," according to the South's Yonhap news agency, which
monitors the North's broadcasts.</LD>
<LD>   Yonhap played down the report, noting it was not repeated or
carried by the North's English-language news agency. Yonhap said it
was likely that the anchor erred or that the North was trying to sow
confusion.</LD>

<LD>Hundreds of Hindu protesters were arrested as police broke up a
banned rally in western India's Gujarat state, where religious
clashes have killed about 1,000 people this year.</LD>
<LD>   The 2-week-long rally planned by the Hindu nationalists was to
start in Godhra, where a Muslim mob's arson attack on a train
carrying mostly Hindus in February triggered India's worst religious
riots in a decade.</LD>
<LD>   The commission charged with holding elections in Gujarat next
month had banned the rally, saying it could reignite tensions and

<KH>ABBA EBAN 1915-2002</KH>
<HD>'Voice of the Hebrew Nation,' Eloquent Diplomat Dies at 87</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Laura King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Abba Eban, the Israeli diplomat and author whose career spanned the
Jewish state's turbulent founding and a generation of warfare with
Arab neighbors, and whose early views on conflict with the
Palestinians proved wrenchingly prescient, died Sunday at age 87.</LD>
<LD>   Eban, who died in a hospital outside Tel Aviv, was respected by
friend and adversary alike for his eloquence, intellectual rigor and
tireless advocacy of Israel's cause in the international arena. David
Ben Gurion, Israel's founding prime minister, once called him "the
voice of the Hebrew nation."</LD>
<LD>   "He was one of the symbols of the founding generation, a
generation that fought and believed in the just fight of the state of
Israel," his nephew Yitzhak Herzog, a former Cabinet secretary, told
Israel Radio.</LD>
<TE>   Eban's life story, with deep roots in several cultures, in some
ways mirrored that of 20th century Jewry.</TE>
<TE>   Born in South Africa -- in Cape Town, on Feb. 2, 1915 -- and
reared largely in England, he became an honor-winning student at
Cambridge. He subsequently served in the British army during World
War II, starting as a foot soldier and rising to major. Eventually,
he became a liaison officer for the Allies to the Jews of Palestine,
and stayed on there after the war.</TE>
<TE>   With Israel's independence in 1948, Eban, like many Zionists of
his generation, dropped his birth name, Aubrey Solomon Eban, in favor
of a Hebrew one. But he never seemed entirely at home in his adopted
land, where his personal style -- aloof, academic, impeccable in
dress and manner -- was always at odds with the rough-and-tumble
informality that prevailed in Israel's leadership circles.</TE>
<TE>   In the diplomatic arena, some of Eban's greatest challenges -- and
triumphs -- came at a young age.</TE>
<TE>   In his early 30s, he was handed the crucial task of lobbying the
United Nations to approve the creation of Israel. In stirring
speeches to the fledgling world body, he invoked the moral imperative
that a Jewish homeland must rise from the ashes of the Holocaust.
With the 1947 vote to partition Palestine, he succeeded, but by a
perilously narrow margin.</TE>
<TE>   Well-spoken and at ease in more than half a dozen languages, Eban
spent a decade as ambassador to the United Nations and made
diplomatic history by serving simultaneously as Israel's envoy to
Washington. There, he developed his trademark skill for mounting a
brilliant oratorical defense of Israeli policy, even when he harbored
private reservations.</TE>
<TE>   "He was not just a very eloquent speaker and skilled diplomat. He
was a man of deep convictions," said Itamar Rabinovich, a veteran
Israeli envoy.</TE>
<TE>   Eban's tenure as foreign minister, from 1966 to 1974, coincided
with a tumultuous period for Israel that encompassed two decisive
wars with Arab neighbors. He ably helped deflect international
concern over Israel's capture of the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Golan
Heights, Sinai Peninsula and East Jerusalem. But he worked hard
behind the scenes to try to convince successive Israeli governments,
with only partial success, that the negotiated return of war-seized
territory was the only path to peace and that, without it, relations
with the Palestinians would be plagued by violence.</TE>
<TE>   A longtime believer in the inevitability of Palestinian statehood
and its necessity to Israel's own interests, Eban nonetheless cast a
coldly critical eye on Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, famously
remarking in 1978 that he, among other Arab leaders, "never missed an
opportunity to miss an opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   Through the years, as Israel faced moral as well as military
challenges, Eban's idealistic view of his country dimmed. In later
years, he told interviewers that he could no longer have echoed with
conviction the language of his passionate appeals almost half a
century earlier for Israel's statehood. But he insisted that he saw
the creation of the Jewish state as one of the 20th century's noblest
experiments.</TE>
<TE>   Back home, in the realm of Israeli domestic politics, Eban never
attained the high regard in which he was held overseas. He once joked
that he could have been elected prime minister "if people abroad
could vote in Israeli elections."</TE>
<TE>   In 1988, after three decades in the Knesset, or parliament, he
suffered the ignominious loss of his seat because of procedural
changes spurred by internal politics in his fractious Labor Party.
With his political career effectively over, he devoted his time to
writing and teaching and was a visiting academic in the U.S. at
Princeton and Columbia.</TE>
<TE>   He narrated public television documentaries and wrote a number of
books, most of them on diplomacy and Israel's history, including "My
Country," "Abba Eban: An Autobiography" and "Heritage: Civilization
and the Jews."</TE>
<TE>   Eban was the recipient of many awards. In 2001, he was given his
country's highest honor, the Israel Prize, but was too frail to
attend the award ceremony. Family members said that, by then, he had
been in failing health for several years.</TE>
<TE>   His death was reported prominently in Israeli newscasts. The
television reports showed old photographs and still footage of him,
tall and bespectacled, formally dressed as always, captured in
mid-speech, mid-gesture.</TE>
<TE>   Even those who had felt the sting of Eban's acerbic tongue joined
in the accolades.</TE>
<TE>   Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whom Eban had criticized for
reluctance to negotiate the handing over of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip to the Palestinians, praised him as the "founding father of
Israeli diplomacy."</TE>
<TE>   Eban is survived by his wife, Susan, and a son and a daughter. He
was to be buried today in his hometown of Kfar Shmaryahu, outside Tel
Aviv, the family said.</TE>

<KH>DISPATCH FROM THE USS IWO JIMA</KH>
<HD>Military, Journalists Practice Working While Under Fire</HD>
<DH>Reporters in Pentagon's 'boot camp' program learn what to
expect from combat situations; service members learn how to deal with
media.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Carol J. Williams and Sam Howe Verhovek</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>ABOARD THE USS IWO JIMA</DL>
<LD>This 844-foot-long amphibious assault ship was coursing over choppy
waters 40 miles off the North Carolina coast when a sudden warning --
"Missile incoming, starboard side" -- roared through its cavernous
entrails.</LD>
<LD>   It was a nocturnal war drill that the ship's 1,500 sailors had
been through many times before. Alarms clanged, orders were shouted,
sailors manned gun turrets on the misty deck, and dozens of
firefighters sprang into action.</LD>
<LD>   But this time, the crew was operating under the gaze not just of
the ship's commanders but of 58 journalists, notebooks in hand and
cameras rolling.</LD>
<TE>   In an unusual experiment launched over the weekend by the
Pentagon, reporters, photographers and cameramen from 31 news
organizations are spending a week with the military in potential
combat situations. It is an exercise that defense officials describe
as an important part of their contingency planning for media access
to military operations if the United States makes good on threats to
invade Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from the drills aboard the Iwo Jima, the reporters,
including one from the Russian news agency Itar-Tass and another from
the United Arab Emirates, will visit the Marine Corps headquarters in
Quantico, Va. Among the matters to be covered there, Pentagon
officials say, are reactions to direct and indirect fire; protection
against nuclear, biological and chemical attack; and identification
of mine hazards. They also will take part in an overnight march with
25-pound backpacks and will board a helicopter with the war gear.</TE>
<TE>   Pledging to improve on what has become an increasingly adversarial
relationship with the press in times of hazard, the Pentagon is
running the "media boot camp" this week to expose journalists to the
rigors of war. Mock drills involving missile hits and enemy
encounters are designed to show reporters the complex interaction of
sea operations and front-line maneuvers, purportedly in anticipation
of media accompaniment of troops headed for the threatened Persian
Gulf confrontation.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying very, very hard to raise the comfort level of the
media and the military. We're trying to make it better," Pentagon
spokeswoman Victoria Clarke told reporters gathered for the first of
what are expected to be four media-military training sessions.</TE>
<TE>   The sessions could serve other public relations purposes for the
military as well, including conveying the sense to Iraqi leaders that
the United States is accelerating its war preparations. Whether the
program will actually clear the way for greater media access in the
event of war remains unclear.</TE>
<TE>   In any event, the rank and file clearly reveled in the
extraordinary attention being paid to their unsung roles in the
looming war's run-up.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad the media's here. I want people to know exactly what
we're capable of, how hard we work," said Gunner's Mate 3rd Class
Dave Richards, 21, from Jackson, N.J. "Our preparation is 24/7. One
minute you're in your rack, sound asleep. The next thing you know,
all hell's breaking loose -- even if it's only a drill."</TE>
<TE>   It was just such a test that exposed this troop-deploying craft to
a mock missile attack Saturday night -- a scenario that included a
botched interception effort to give damage-control crews some
practice.</TE>
<TE>   The exercise was eerily reminiscent of the October 2000 terrorist
attack on the U.S. destroyer Cole off Yemen. A small boat approaches
with unclear intentions, ignoring efforts at radio contact and
warnings to turn around or confront live fire.</TE>
<TE>   Such noncompliance prompts deployment of the Iwo Jima's 30-foot
inflatable launch to observe and engage the potentially hostile
craft. That involves bearing down on the intruding vessel to prevent
it from attacking the $1-billion Iwo Jima and its priceless human
cargo.</TE>
<TE>   "It's my job to protect the ship, and I have to look at it as a
cost-benefit analysis. It can be me and two or three other people who
get killed, or me and 2,000 people. It's a greater-good situation. I
have to look at it that way," said Boatswain's Mate 1st Class John
Obrien of Lima, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   A 29-year-old human shield between the ship and its suspected
enemy, Obrien would be expected to deflect the approaching vessel or
die trying.</TE>
<TE>   "There's always been that danger. I think I'm just more aware of
it now," Obrien said. "There's always that feeling that it can't
happen to me, but the Cole incident brought to the forefront that it
can."</TE>
<TE>   Most reporters seemed as glad as the crew members to go through
the exercises, though they were a bit skeptical that the program
presaged a greater willingness on the military's part to bring
journalists along during actual combat.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been an evolution over the last two decades," said Mike
Boettcher, a veteran CNN reporter who has covered U.S. military
action in the Persian Gulf, Afghanistan, Beirut and Grenada, as well
as wars in Kosovo, Central America and the Falkland Islands.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there is a significant section of the military that says,
'We're going to change the way we do things,' " Boettcher said. But
he added that another faction in the armed services remains highly
resistant to providing the media greater access. "It's going to be
interesting to see who wins out."</TE>
<TE>   Cmdr. Pat Menah, the ship's air boss, asked one journalist what
she might write. When told it would be a story about the media and
the military trying to learn each other's wartime needs, the New
Jersey native jokingly invoked Rodney King's plea: "You mean, like,
'People, can't we all just get along?' "</TE>
<TE>   Even the Iwo Jima's commander said he had yet to determine his
feelings about having reporters aboard should his ship be confronted
with peril.</TE>
<TE>   "I never did it, so I honestly don't know," said Capt. John
Nawrocki, a Navy officer for 28 years. "It could be limited access.
More likely you'd be frustrated with me than I'd be frustrated with
you."</TE>
<TE>   Use of satellite phones for transmitting stories could also be
circumscribed, Nawrocki noted, explaining the risk of the enemy's
locating his vessel by intercepting and tracking the communications
signals.</TE>
<TE>   When a reporter joked that sometimes simply getting a story filed
to the home office is a journalist's paramount concern, Nawrocki
deadpanned: "I admire your ethic, but you've got to give me credit
for mine."</TE>
<TE>   Service members preparing for their first extended sea duty on
this ship, which is expected to be at sea six to seven months next
year, confessed to mixed emotions about confronting danger and
proving their mettle. "I'm kind of nervous from all the biological
and chemical weapons drills, but I'm also looking forward to it,"
said Luke Warner of Chicago, a damage controlman second class.
Communication with his fretful grandmother and girlfriend via e-mail
may be restricted if the crew is compelled to observe "electronic
silence."</TE>
<TE>   Although U.S. forces from deckhands to the commander in chief
recite a single mantra -- that these shipboard drills are purely
theoretical and no actual war moves are in the making so far -- they
readily concede that a confrontation with Iraq is what's in their
preparatory cross-hairs.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to figure what will be your most likely scenario and
prepare for it. That only makes sense," said Lt. j.g. Christine
Komoroski, an engineering officer.</TE>
<TE>   If the week's worth of training is meant to raise comfort levels
on both sides, it is not completely designed to make the media
comfortable. Wake-up calls, for instance, were clearly much earlier
than some reporters were accustomed to. Komoroski knocked on
stateroom doors at 5:30 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The media did get what passes for VIP treatment aboard ship.
Reporters, for instance, got to sleep four to a room in officers'
quarters, unlike enlistees below deck, where as many as 147 are
assigned to bunks stacked three high in a room the size of a
3,000-square-foot ranch house.</TE>
<TE>   The one-week course is "designed to expose media members to the
potential rigors of work in a combat environment," according to the
government liability release form reporters were required to sign.</TE>
<TE>   Among those rigors were angry seas. On the media corps' departure
from dry land early Saturday, 6-foot waves undermined the
"air-cushioned" ride of the ship-to-shore transports and the gastric
equilibrium of a handful of the media trainees.</TE>

<HD>Skeletons of History in Russian Graves</HD>
<DH>Despite a lack of official data, activists say thousands of
Stalinist purge victims are buried at the site.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Daniszewski</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>TOKSOVO, Russia</DL>
<LD>Mikhail Pushnitsky, his long gray hair hanging down the side of his
head, jiggled the steel rod in his hand and pressed it down into the
brown soil again and again, until he heard the tell-tale thump. Like
a beating heart in a horror story, the hollow echo of the rod
striking bone lingered in the air: an accusation.</LD>
<LD>   Gingerly using a shovel and the kind of brush for getting snow off
a windshield, he soon exposed a skull, femur and shin bones, all of
which had taken on a rusty hue. For some reason, however, the enamel
of the victim's teeth still shone white.</LD>
<LD>   "As any normal person, the first time I saw this I was shocked,"
said Pushnitsky, 55, part of a small team investigating what it says
is a newly discovered Stalinist killing field outside St. Petersburg.
"But when you get to your 20th skull, you get angry. We understand
that this is a crime scene, and through this we have come close to a
hideous crime."</LD>
<TE>   "The perpetrators should not be able to get away," added Fyodor
Drozdov, Pushnitsky's colleague rooting in the dirt of the forest.
"If we cannot get the killers, at least let's bring the crime out
into the open."</TE>
<TE>   What drives the two men to anger is the tendency of many of their
fellow Russians, and the wider world, to rationalize, doubt or
somehow excuse the state-sponsored killing of tens of millions of
Soviet citizens from the earliest days of the Bolsheviks until the
death of Josef Stalin in 1953, and some even later.</TE>
<TE>   Even as Memorial, a nongovernmental organization that seeks to
uncover crimes of Communist terror and win redress for victims, was
announcing its find of the Toksovo execution grounds after a 14-year
search, politicians were calling for the reinstatement of a monument
to one of the chief killers, Felix Dzerzhinsky, founder of the first
Bolshevik secret police.</TE>
<TE>   The forest near Toksovo, Memorial estimates, could hold the bones
of 32,000 people executed from the late 1920s until the late 1930s,
on the eve of World War II. That would make it perhaps the single
biggest grave of Stalinist victims found in the former Soviet Union.</TE>
<TE>   And yet a monument that Memorial erected in St. Petersburg to the
victims of a Communist campaign of terror was defaced in September
with the words: "They should have killed more."</TE>
<TE>   Eleven years after the fall of the Soviet Union, the FSB -- the
successor agency to the NKVD, the KGB and other Soviet secret police
agencies -- is still stonewalling about how many people were killed
and exactly where they are buried, said Irena Flige, head of
Memorial's office in St. Petersburg.</TE>
<TE>   It took Memorial 14 years of deduction, investigation and
detective work -- initiated by Flige's husband, Veniamin Iofe, a
former political prisoner who died in April -- to find the first
remains. They were unearthed Aug. 20 in these woods controlled by the
Ministry of Defense and used as an artillery firing range since
czarist times.</TE>
<TE>   The very secrecy of the killings proves that the Stalinist regime
knew the executions were a crime, something to be kept hidden, Flige
said.</TE>
<TE>   Prisoners were loaded into Black Marias in the middle of the night
from St. Petersburg's Kresty Prison and the NKVD's "Big House"
headquarters and driven over a bumpy dirt track to a small access
road that led into the forest. The appearance of this road to nowhere
in aerial photographs dating to the 1920s was the first clue that led
Iofe to believe that graves would be found in this area, said Flige,
42, an anti-Soviet dissident since age 18.</TE>
<TE>   Now that more than 50 graves have been found, she said, there can
be little doubt that this was the NKVD's main graveyard in St.
Petersburg during the 1937-38 period known as the Great Terror. In
its work there, Memorial has dug down only about 3 feet. The group
presumes that there are many layers below, but it says it is not
interested in disturbing the dead by doing a complete excavation.</TE>
<TE>   Memorial's knowledge about the grave site is "fragmentary,"
according to Flige, because FSB authorities in the region are
refusing any detailed discussion with her group. The FSB is saying
only that it has no written records of a graveyard or of mass
executions near Toksovo.</TE>
<TE>   "We interpret this as a problem of crimes against humanity," Flige
said. "Since the FSB is the direct legal heir of both the KGB and
NKVD, we believe their categorical denial of assistance to us should
be considered as concealment of information."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Official Denial</TE>
<TE>   Although she does not know who all the victims are, she strongly
suspects that one is Father Pavel Florensky, a pre-revolutionary
Russian theologian, writer and scientist who refused to surrender his
philosophical opposition to Bolshevism. Documents from government
archives show that he was to be executed in the vicinity of Toksovo
in December 1937.</TE>
<TE>   The Defense Ministry, which has jurisdiction over the woods, said
it, like the FSB, knows of no grave site from its records. And now,
Flige said, the military is saying it will not renew a permit for
access to the site until Memorial provides archival evidence for the
graves' existence, something -- according to Flige -- that it knows
to be impossible.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, an explosion has left a huge crater on the road to the
site. Now it can be reached only by foot or bicycle, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Flige suspects that the FSB asked the military to blow up
the road, she says she is not discouraged.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing will stop us," she said. "We have not stopped our
excavations."</TE>
<TE>   Memorial's estimate of 32,000 victims in Toksovo is based on
subtraction. About 40,000 people in what was then Leningrad and its
surrounding region were killed in the Great Terror, but the one known
grave of the victims is believed to hold only about 8,000.</TE>
<TE>   The discovery of the graves has electrified sons and daughters of
victims, now in their 60s and 70s. Their lives were permanently
changed after nighttime visits of the secret police, which meant that
their fathers or mothers -- or both -- were to be consumed by the
Stalinist killing machine.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to go to Toksovo and go down on my knees there and take a
handful of earth home in a little bag and keep it on my desk, where I
can always look at it, touch it and maybe talk to it," said Mela
Lyubavskaya, 75, who lost her father -- a devoted party member -- on
the night of Feb. 19, 1937, when she was 10.</TE>
<TE>   Her father, Pavel Lazarevich Bulat, 36, was executed a few months
later.</TE>
<TE>   His wife, Nina, was sent to a camp. Mela and her sister, 3, went
to orphanages, where they were raised to detest their disgraced
father and worship Stalin, the constructor and master of the
apparatus of terror. It was an experience shared by millions, none of
whom could speak openly about their pain until decades afterward.</TE>
<TE>   Andrei Dybovsky, a St. Petersburg forensic crime expert, said he
examined 12 skeletons from the Toksovo site. Many of the skulls had
bullet holes ranging in diameter from 9 to 11.43 millimeters in the
back, which he said would match the killing style and weapons of NKVD
executioners of the time.</TE>
<TE>   The excavations and search for more graves would continue until
the first freeze, then resume in the spring with the aid of
archeologists and geophysicists, Dybovsky said.</TE>
<TE>   The remains that are unearthed are photographed, studied and then
put back into the ground.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Personal Interests</TE>
<TE>   Both Pushnitsky and Drozdov, the volunteer excavators, had
personal as well as historical interest in bringing forth the truth.
Pushnitsky's great-uncle was executed during the Great Terror.
Drozdov was born in a Stalinist labor camp.</TE>
<TE>   Drozdov, 55, a mathematician, said that at the least he would like
to see a sense of shame develop in Russia, where even today prominent
people are often slain but the killers are rarely brought to justice.</TE>
<TE>   "We should make sure that a person asked to do this in the future
would think about how his children and grandchildren will feel about
him someday.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody is shocked that the government ignores this," said
Drozdov, who wants those perpetrators still alive to be prosecuted.
"They do not want to deal with the people who committed this crime."</TE>
<TE>   The difficulty of getting Russia to deal honestly with its past
was shown by the recent proposal, by Moscow Mayor Yuri M. Luzhkov, to
re-erect the statue of Dzerzhinsky, and by the defacing of the
memorial to victims of Communist terror.</TE>
<TE>   The vandals also drew a swastika and a Star of David on the stone
and painted over verses by Anna Akhmatova about Soviet-era
repression.</TE>
<TE>   Memorial's monument to the victims was put in place in early
September. It was formed from a large rock from the Solovetsky
Islands, site of one of the first Communist labor camps beginning in
the 1920s.</TE>
<TE>   "We ... felt it was the right time," Flige said, "because the
rumors of having Dzerzhinsky put back up were already circulating."</TE>
<TE>   The toppling of the Dzerzhinsky statue in 1991 outside the KGB
headquarters in Moscow after the failed hard-line Communist coup
against Mikhail S. Gorbachev symbolically heralded the victory of
Boris N. Yeltsin, the end of one-party Communist rule and the demise
of the Soviet Union a few months later.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that Moscow's mayor now wants the statue put back --
purportedly for its artistic merit -- is seen by many here as a
clumsy attempt to curry favor with President Vladimir V. Putin, who
served as a KGB colonel and has installed many of his former
colleagues in important political posts.</TE>
<TE>   As Flige sees it, nothing fundamental has changed in Russia over
the last decade, and the Gorbachev-Yeltsin era was simply one of the
periodic thaws in an overall Russian political climate of repression.</TE>
<TE>   "And that seems now to be coming to an end," she said. "First we
get a president who is an ex-KGB colonel, then we move on to
[restoring] the Dzerzhinsky monument."</TE>
<TE>   Victor L. Masaytis, 76, the son of a Great Terror victim in St.
Petersburg, said he has difficulty understanding what is happening.</TE>
<TE>   "This is blasphemy," he said of the push to reinstall the
Dzerzhinsky statue. "This is utter blasphemy."</TE>
<TE>   Masaytis recalled the night they came for his father: Dec. 5,
1937. His father was a prominent engineer working on Leningrad's
water system.</TE>
<TE>   But in the mad logic of the Great Terror, the father, an ethnic
Lithuanian, was singled out to die for an alleged anti-state
conspiracy by Latvians.</TE>
<TE>   Masaytis was 11, and he recalls that he could not keep his eyes
open all night while strange men searched their apartment, standing
around, taking notes and seeking evidence.</TE>
<TE>   "I fell asleep. I did not see my father being taken away," he
said, 65 years after the event.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Masaytis recalls only "the shadow of a soldier, with a
rifle and a bayonet, standing behind our matte glass door. That image
I can remember very well."</TE>

<HD>Iran to Review Academic's Case</HD>
<DH>Student protesters claim a victory as the country's supreme
leader orders the judiciary to reexamine dissident's death sentence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>TEHRAN</DL>
<LD>Students who have staged a series of large rallies for free speech
and government reform claimed a victory Sunday as Iran's supreme
leader ordered a review of a death sentence handed down against a
dissident academic.</LD>
<LD>   The weeklong student rallies and strikes in support of history
professor Hashem Aghajari had raised political tension at a crucial
stage in the power battle between Iran's reformists and hard-liners.
Aghajari was sentenced to death for questioning the powers of the
hard-line clergy and for allegedly committing blasphemy against the
prophet Muhammad.</LD>
<LD>   The reformists, allied with President Mohammad Khatami, enjoy
popular support and dominate parliament but have run into stiff
resistance from conservatives, who oppose changing Iran's Islamic
system and control the judiciary and other key state bodies.</LD>
<TE>   The hard-line Jomhuri Islami newspaper reported Sunday that
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's most powerful figure, had ordered the
judiciary to review Aghajari's case.</TE>
<TE>   "Based on the request of hundreds of university professors, the
leader ordered the judiciary to carefully review this case," the
newspaper quoted an informed source as saying. The newspaper, seen as
being close to Khamenei, said the death sentence would likely be
overturned.</TE>
<TE>   Students greeted the news as a victory and said they would
consider ending their protests.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no need for the students to protest now. They presented
and reached their goal, which was the cancellation of the verdict,"
said a student leader who declined to be identified. "It's a big
victory for students in defense of freedom of expression."</TE>
<TE>   Even some prominent conservatives had criticized the Aghajari
verdict, and analysts said Khamenei's intervention revealed how
concerned the leadership was about the uproar.</TE>
<TE>   The judiciary -- which has been a major thorn in the side of
Khatami's reform efforts, closing liberal newspapers and jailing
pro-reform intellectuals and journalists -- emerges weaker from the
case, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "The judiciary will have to be more careful in future.... This was
a setback for them," said Hamid Reza Jalaipour, political science
lecturer at Tehran University.</TE>
<TE>   Parliament Speaker Mehdi Karroubi thanked Khamenei for
intervening. "I would particularly like to thank the leader for
taking into account the importance of blood and human life in Islam,"
he was quoted as saying by the state-run Islamic Republic News
Agency.</TE>

<HD>Former Premier Gets 24 Years in '79 Killing</HD>
<DH>The seven-time prime minister of Italy had been acquitted
three years ago.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>ROME</DL>
<LD>An Italian court sentenced former Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti to
24 years in prison Sunday on charges of complicity in the 1979 murder
of a muckraking journalist, overturning a previous acquittal.</LD>
<LD>   The shock ruling took Italy and the seven-time prime minister by
surprise.</LD>
<LD>   Andreotti, 83 and a senator for life, had been acquitted of the
charges three years ago, after accusations first leveled by a Mafia
turncoat.</LD>
<TE>   The court also convicted Gaetano Badalamenti -- a Mafia boss
already serving a prison term in the United States in a drug case --
for his alleged part in the murder conspiracy, the defendants'
lawyers said Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Andreotti will remain free while he appeals to Italy's highest
appeals court.</TE>
<TE>   Andreotti has always denied the charges relating to the killing of
Mino Pecorelli.</TE>
<TE>   "I have always believed in justice, and I continue to believe,
even if this evening I find it difficult to accept such an
absurdity," Andreotti, who had been waiting for the decision at his
apartment in Rome, said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   According to prosecutors, Andreotti's aides, in collusion with the
Mafia, conspired to kill Pecorelli because he was about to publish
revelations that could have ruined Andreotti's career.</TE>
<TE>   Pecorelli was shot four times by an unidentified gunman in Rome as
he was returning home from his newsroom.</TE>
<TE>   Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi condemned Sunday's decision,
arguing that it proved his frequent assertions that judges are
politically biased against conservatives.</TE>
<TE>   "The 24-year sentence imposed on Sen. Andreotti is the ultimate
stage of a judicial scheme through which politicized sectors of the
magistrature have tried to change the course of democratic politics
and try to rewrite Italian history," Berlusconi said.</TE>

<HD>Revisiting the Life and Crimes of a Murderer</HD>
<DH>Britain's hatred of child-killer Myra Hindley may have
overshadowed her real role in the crimes, supporters say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>William Wallace</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>During the 36 years she spent in prison, and now in death, Myra
Hindley has tormented Britain like no other murderer in memory, her
name a shorthand for the monstrous crime of child killing, her
bottled-blond 1960s mug shot still a provocation to fury.</LD>
<LD>   It is a spell that endures even as her body awaits cremation in a
hospital morgue under police guard. Since Friday, when her
tobacco-ravaged lungs apparently gave out at age 60, the British have
been revisiting the terrible details of her part in the murders of
five children -- and it is stomach-churning reading.</LD>
<LD>   She is so reviled that her funeral will be conducted in secret,
probably in the middle of the night, officials say.</LD>
<TE>   But there is also a nagging uncertainty among some that Hindley
was punished beyond what justice demanded. A small but devoted circle
of Hindley supporters argues that she was a victim of mob punishment,
left to die in prison because of a peculiarity of British law that
allows the government to keep some criminals locked up at its
discretion.</TE>
<TE>   The special measure was introduced in the mid-1960s at the time
that Britain outlawed the death penalty. It gives the home secretary
the power to indefinitely extend the sentences of prisoners whose
terms are designated "whole life" -- a form of assurance to those who
worried that the most heinous killers would do their prison time and
then return to the streets.</TE>
<TE>   Hindley was one of 23 people serving a whole life sentence,
despite the British parole board's having assessed her as a low-risk
prisoner five years ago, suggesting she be moved to a low-security
facility. She remained locked up, the law's critics say, only because
no politician would risk the popular backlash that would inevitably
follow her release.</TE>
<TE>   For evidence, the critics point to Hindley's treatment at the
hands of Britain's tabloid press. The papers never forgave her for
the murders, shouting down every legal attempt she made to win
release. To the tabs, she was beyond redemption. "The Final
Injustice: She Died Peacefully," was the Daily Mail's verdict this
weekend on Hindley's passing.</TE>
<TE>   "The tabloids ratcheted up the hatred for Myra to such a point
that it was impossible for any politician to give up the power to
keep this icon-ess of evil behind bars," said Geoffrey Robertson, a
London human rights lawyer who represented Hindley in one parole
application. "Perhaps her death will provide the opportunity for
politicians to realize they no longer need this antiquated power."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the House of Lords is expected to rule within months on
whether the power of a politician to overrule the judiciary on
sentencing is compatible with Britain's new Human Rights Act and its
legal commitments to European human rights conventions. If the House
of Lords does strike down the law, some observers noted, Hindley may
have been on the threshold of freedom when she died.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Hindley occupied a morally bewildering terrain, and
ascertaining her appropriate punishment has always been fuel for
argument. Her expressions of remorse were never widely accepted as
genuine. They were too great a leap, perhaps, from the evidence of
her deeds.</TE>
<TE>   The facts are chilling and undisputed. She and her lover, Ian
Brady, killed five children in the mid-1960s, Hindley luring them out
of their innocence and delivering them into his murderous, sexually
abusive hands.</TE>
<TE>   The pair took photographs of the gagged and nearly naked children.
Perhaps most damning to their defense, they tape-recorded the
desperate pleas of one of the victims -- 10-year-old Lesley Ann
Downey -- to be set free. Hindley's unforgettable response to the
child's begging: "Shut up or I will forget myself and hit you one."
They killed with nonchalance.</TE>
<TE>   The two were caught only when they brazenly murdered their last
victim, 17-year-old Edward Evans, while Hindley's brother-in-law
watched. He turned them in the next day.</TE>
<TE>   Neither killer showed much remorse during their 1966 trial,
although Hindley acknowledged that her failure to come to Downey's
aide was "indefensible" and "cruel." Both were sentenced to life in
prison.</TE>
<TE>   But it was Hindley alone who campaigned for an early release.
Brady lost a bid for the right to die, complaining in an open letter
in 1999 after Hindley suffered an aneurysm that "Myra gets the
potentially fatal brain condition whilst I have to fight simply to
die."</TE>
<TE>   Hindley's first approach was to portray herself as a victim too,
coerced by Brady's spell over her. And to many of her defenders, she
presented a compelling case: a Roman Catholic girl raised in a poor,
violent home, desperate for love, who had the misfortune to become
besotted with Brady, who tortured cats as a child and would
eventually move on to human prey. She said she had been manipulated
by her boyfriend, who kept her in line through beatings and rape.</TE>
<TE>   In prison, Hindley eventually rediscovered her Catholic faith and
helped police find one of the bodies that the killers had buried on a
desolate moor in northern England.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, she picked up high-profile campaigners for her
release, including the late Lord Longford, Britain's leading prison
reformer, who argued that she was truly haunted by her crimes.</TE>
<TE>   But most observers dismissed her 1994 claim to "have paid my debt
to society" as nothing more than an outrageous and cynical bid for
freedom.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, in 1974, she tried and failed to escape, and it was not
until 1987 that she and Brady admitted to two of the five murders.</TE>
<TE>   "The rhythm is all me, me, me, poor me, bright me, persecuted me,"
journalist Yvonne Roberts wrote in the Observer newspaper Sunday,
describing a one-hour prison conversation she had with Hindley 14
years ago. Roberts asked Hindley how she could take a 10-year-old
from a fairground and bring her to Brady to be tortured and raped.</TE>
<TE>   "The girl shouldn't have been out at that time of night," Roberts
said Hindley replied.</TE>

<HD>Why the Next 'Harry Potters' May Take a Spell</HD>
<DH>The film series' logistics offer challenges that a young
wizard would find hard to overcome.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Claudia Eller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Now that "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" has scared up
monstrous box-office numbers, just like the first movie, here's how
the plot thickens in coming episodes:</LD>
<LD>   Warner Bros. has been forced to hire a new director for the third
installment. The original one burned out after the breakneck pace of
back-to-back productions. The planned release date has been delayed
because the parents of the actor who plays Harry wanted him to attend
a prestigious school rather than being tutored on the set.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, the fourth J.K. Rowling adventure book is so fat -- 734
pages -- no one is sure it can be shaped into a single movie without
slicing scenes, which could alienate the protective author and her
fanatical young readers.</LD>
<TE>   As for book No. 5, it's still in the works -- and even longer than
the last one.</TE>
<TE>   On top of all this, the clock is ticking for the three young stars
of the "Potter" series, who already are beginning to outgrow their
roles, raising the dicey issue of whether adolescent audiences would
embrace a new Harry, Ron and Hermione.</TE>
<TE>   As successful as the "Potter" film series has been so far, it also
has become arguably the most complicated and uniquely unpredictable
movie franchise ever undertaken. Warner Bros. President Alan Horn
calls the effort "a Herculean task."</TE>
<TE>   No other long-running movie series -- not "Star Wars," James Bond
or "Batman" -- has been forced to juggle the competing interests of
literary loyalty, artistic license and commercial considerations on
such a grand scale.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a unique balancing act," studio Chairman Barry Meyer says --
one that gets trickier, not easier, as the franchise stretches toward
the end of the decade and possibly beyond.</TE>
<TE>   "Things you think may be a slam dunk may not be," says media
analyst Tom Wolzien of Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   In all, Warner Bros. plans on making seven movies based on
Rowling's completed and pending books about a bespectacled boy and
his pals at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where young
witches and wizards learn the finer points of potions and wands while
tumbling into frightening adventures.</TE>
<TE>   The studio got into the game early and cheaply. Just before the
first book -- "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" -- became an
international sensation, Warner Bros. paid Rowling a meager $50,000
for the right to keep rivals at bay. The following year, the studio
paid an additional $500,000, this time to exercise its option to make
a movie.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, "Sorcerer's Stone" has generated an estimated $1.5
billion in revenue for the studio and its corporate parent, AOL Time
Warner Inc., from worldwide box-office receipts and DVD, television
and merchandising sales. "Chamber of Secrets" appears headed down the
same road to riches, grossing an estimated $87.7 million in North
American theaters last weekend.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Movie a Year Planned</TE>
<TE>   The initial plan was to maintain a schedule that would allow the
studio to release a movie every year, keeping audience anticipation
high. For the first two films, the strategy worked. Not so for No. 3,
which won't be out until 2004 -- proving that nothing can be taken
for granted when working with young stars on an ambitious scale.</TE>
<TE>   Production on "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" was
delayed until February when the parents of leading boy Daniel
Radcliffe, 13, asked for a recess. They told the studio and
London-based producer David Heyman their son had been accepted into a
top-drawer school and they would like him to attend the first
semester. The parents of co-star Emma Watson, 12, who plays
precocious witch Hermione, wanted their daughter to study in a real
classroom too. For two years, the young actors had been tutored on
the set.</TE>
<TE>   "The kids wanted a break," studio chief Horn says. "We're talking
about real people here."</TE>
<TE>   Their director, however, wanted to drop out completely.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Columbus, whose works include the mainstream hits "Home
Alone" and "Mrs. Doubtfire," had planned on directing all seven
"Potter" pictures. But last summer, halfway through shooting "Chamber
of Secrets," he told the studio he was simply too spent to even
contemplate a third movie, let alone four more after that.</TE>
<TE>   The normally indefatigable Columbus has spent three years filming
in London, uprooting his wife and their four children (ranging in age
from 5 to 13) from their San Francisco home.</TE>
<TE>   After beginning production on "Chamber of Secrets" just three days
after the debut of "Sorcerer's Stone," Columbus says he couldn't
imagine starting another grueling regimen of 16-hour days.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't think I could give the actors the same amount of energy
... and I wanted to spend more time with my family," Columbus says.
"I had the insanely naive vision that I would direct all seven
movies. But ... I realized that if I even attempted to do the third
movie, I might not make it."</TE>
<TE>   Breaking the news to the studio was tough, but not nearly as
hard as telling the young actors with whom he had grown so close,
especially Radcliffe.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Columbus won't be heading back to the Bay Area soon. To
ensure a smooth transition for the youngsters and their new director,
Alfonso Cuaron, he agreed to stay on as a producer until "Prisoner of
Azkaban" is completed late next summer.</TE>
<TE>   "My only rule is that the set has to be a completely comfortable
place -- no screaming, no angry outbursts, no selfish behavior,"
Columbus says.</TE>
<TE>   The change in directors also could have a dramatic effect on the
look and tone of the franchise. Although Cuaron has been lauded for
his artistry, he has never shepherded a huge commercial success or
directed a big-budget, complicated production with lots of visual
effects. The first two "Potter" movies each cost about $140 million
to make.</TE>
<TE>   What the studio did see in Cuaron was his distinctive style and
range. He directed this year's sexually explicit Spanish-language
sleeper "Y Tu Mama Tambien," a coming-of-age story about two teenage
boys who become intimate with the same older woman. On the other end
of the spectrum, he directed Warner's visually enchanting but
financially disappointing 1995 children's movie "A Little Princess,"
which is set in a New York girls' school.</TE>
<TE>   "He has a great sense of magic, boundless imagination, a real
compassion for children and a keen understanding of teenage life and
its nuances," "Potter" producer Heyman says.</TE>
<TE>   Cuaron's biggest challenge may be one out of his control, one that
sets the "Potter" franchise apart from any other movie series.</TE>
<TE>   Although the young stars were supposed to age one year with each
movie -- as the characters do in the books -- the plan has gone awry.
With production delayed, their ages will be out of sync by the third
movie, a gap that is expected only to widen with each new
installment.</TE>
<TE>   "We're experimenting with cryogenic techniques to simply freeze
the actors until we're ready to go again, but so far there's no
scientific evidence to suggest that it's a workable plan," Horn
jokes.</TE>
<TE>   The child actors in the "Potter" franchise are unusual because
they have given face to literary characters cherished by millions of
young readers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Casting Challenges</TE>
<TE>   It will be tricky enough to replace Professor Albus Dumbledore,
portrayed in the first two "Potter" movies by Richard Harris, 72, who
died last month. But the thought of replacing Harry or his closest
cohorts is enough to unnerve Warner executives fearful of breaking
the spell with fans.</TE>
<TE>   Horn says he hopes he will not confront that decision. But if he
does, there'll be only one option. "We'd have to find new kids," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   At this point, Radcliffe, Watson and 14-year-old Rupert Grint, who
plays Harry's sidekick Ron, are under contract for only one more
movie. They have not been asked to sign up for No. 4, according to
Horn, because production isn't slated to begin until spring 2004.</TE>
<TE>   With so much money riding on the advancing ages of the children,
there is little room for the kinds of creative and strategic delays
that typically plague Hollywood productions. As a result, pressure is
mounting to keep the productions on track.</TE>
<TE>   The studio only recently closed a deal with screenwriter Steve
Kloves to begin adapting Rowling's lengthy fourth book, "Harry Potter
and the Goblet of Fire." If Kloves can't figure out how to squeeze
the material into one movie, the studio might have to make two, Horn
said. And that would further distance the actors' real ages from
those of their screen characters.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, condensing the voluminous book into one movie carries
its own problems. Harry Potter audiences expect to see every twist
and turn from Rowling's books leap from the page to the screen.</TE>
<TE>   The status of "Harry Potter" No. 5 is even murkier, raising
concerns about just how long the momentum can be maintained.</TE>
<TE>   Warner had hoped Rowling would be done writing "Harry Potter and
the Order of the Phoenix" by last summer because the studio wanted to
release the video and DVD of "Sorcerer's Stone" at the same time the
book was published.</TE>
<TE>   So when will Warner get a peek?</TE>
<TE>   "Zero idea," Horn confesses. When he saw the author at the London
premiere of "Chamber of Secrets," "she didn't mention it and I didn't
ask."</TE>
<TE>   According to a spokeswoman at Scholastic Inc., Rowling's U.S.
publisher, the author is "putting the finishing touches" on her fifth
book. And though that may be good news for the studio, Rowling has
told her publisher that book No. 5 will be "one chapter longer than
[No.] 4."</TE>

<HD>Body of Missing O.C. Man Found in Harbor</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The body of a 76-year-old Huntington Beach man was spotted in
Huntington Harbour early Sunday, two weeks after authorities say the
man fell overboard from his docked boat during stormy weather.</LD>
<LD>   A motorist on the 16000 block of Pacific Coast Highway saw the
body of James Ignacious Cormack about 8 a.m. about 100 yards from the
dirt shoulder.</LD>
<LD>   "There didn't appear to be any signs of foul play, and it is
believed the death was accidental," said Seal Beach Police Sgt. Tim
Olson.</LD>
<TE>   An autopsy will be performed today to determine the cause of
death.</TE>
<TE>   Cormack was found about half a mile from where he was last seen
Nov. 8.</TE>
<TE>   His wife, Pat, 67, called police after her husband didn't show up
for work at their travel agency. She looked for him on their boat,
which was docked at Sunset Aquatic Park.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew something was terribly wrong," she said. "I knew when the
coffee wasn't made and the reports weren't done."</TE>
<TE>   Divers searched the aquatic park but stopped after two hours when
stormy weather hit the shore.</TE>
<TE>   A neighbor who was at the beach Sunday morning when the body was
pulled from the water notified Pat Cormack that her husband may have
been found. The couple's son Michael identified his father.</TE>
<TE>   Pat Cormack said her husband of 43 years knew how to swim but may
have hit his head on the boat and drowned. The couple bought the boat
10 years ago and it became one of the passions of his life.</TE>
<TE>   "He got his work done at the office and he'd go out in the boat,"
Pat Cormack said. "He'd go out on the deck and read a book or watch
football, then come home for dinner. He loved that boat. It was his
love."</TE>
<TE>   Funeral arrangements are pending. Cormack leaves his wife,
daughter Anne, and sons Michael, Steven, Thomas and Joseph.</TE>

<HD>Officials Want Bombs Away</HD>
<DH>Parts of Orange County were a military practice range, and

<LD>For more than a decade after World War II, Navy pilots from the El
Toro Marine base dropped thousands of bombs and rockets on a large
swath of south Orange County.</LD>
<LD>   The target practice ended after the Korean War nearly 50 years
ago. But the legacy of those bombing runs continues to haunt the area
in the form of unexploded munitions hidden beneath open spaces.</LD>
<LD>   The Trabuco Bombing Range now consists of the housing tracts of
the city of Rancho Santa Margarita and the rolling ridges and
crevices of O'Neill Regional Park. About 70 tons of bombs and rockets
were excavated when the city was built, so few are believed to remain
there. However, countless others remain beneath the soil in parts of
the sprawling 3,100-acre county park, a popular spot for hiking,
mountain biking and picnicking.</LD>
<TE>   Local officials believe the munitions represent a public hazard
and are unhappy at the federal government's timetable for cleanup,
which would not begin for 21 years.</TE>
<TE>   "Quite frankly, 2023 is really unacceptable," said Rancho Santa
Margarita Councilman Gary Thompson. "We're talking about an area
utilized by the public. They certainly should put a priority on
that."</TE>
<TE>   There is no record of any injuries caused by people coming into
contact with the unexploded ordnance in Orange County, though federal
authorities have recorded dozens of civilian causalities at other
sites with unexploded munitions across the nation, including the
death of two San Diego boys in 1983. The bombs used for practice
contain only a fraction of the firepower of normal bombs, but the
government said they can still cause serious injuries.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like Russian roulette," said Lenny Siegel, director of the
Center for Public Environmental Oversight in Washington, D.C. "You
know most people won't be hurt."</TE>
<TE>   The 1,812-acre bombing range is one of more than 9,000 so-called
"formerly used defense sites" across the United States. About 2,500
need cleanup that will cost about $19 billion. However, federal
spending has hovered around $220 million annually, said Candace
Walters, a spokeswoman for the Army Corps of Engineers headquarters
in Washington. "That doesn't go very far."</TE>
<TE>   If that spending pace remains stagnant, cleaning up all the sites
will take nearly a century.</TE>
<TE>   An Oregon congressman has been pushing for years to focus more
attention on the issue of unexploded munitions and former defense
sites.</TE>
<TE>   "No one is really in charge of dealing with the problem of
unexploded ordnance, and there is not adequate funding to address
it," Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) said.</TE>
<TE>   According to a federal study that has yet to be published, at
least 67 civilians have been killed and 137 injured from unexploded
ordnance since World War I. Nearly half of those killed or injured
were minors.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most tragic and well-known accidents took place in 1983
in a northern San Diego subdivision built on a World War II artillery
range. Two 8-year-old boys were killed after coming across a live
mortar shell. A third boy was seriously injured.</TE>
<TE>   In other cases around the nation in recent years, bomblets
containing liquid sarin nerve gas were found in a national wildlife
refuge near Denver, and mortar shells containing a gas that explodes
when it comes in contact with air were discovered 2,100 feet from an
elementary school on Cape Cod in Massachusetts.</TE>
<TE>   At the Trabuco Bombing Range in south Orange County, Navy pilots
from the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station used the grazing land as a
bombing- and gunnery-practice range from 1944 to 1956. Aiming at a
mission-era adobe hut, the men bombarded the land with 3-, 4- and
25-pound practice bombs, as well 2 1/4-, 3 1/2- and 5-inch practice
rockets.</TE>
<TE>   The military removed all ordnance found on the surface, and 70
tons was excavated when Rancho Santa Margarita was built. The deepest
rocket was found eight feet underground. Some of the ordnance was
reburied 30 feet beneath the 8th hole of the Tijeras Creek Golf
Course.</TE>
<TE>   Construction workers in the city find one or two practice bombs or
rockets a year; the county's bomb squad is called out to dispose of
it. But the park was never graded, so it's unknown how many are
hidden by a few feet of eroding soil.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Buchman, the south district supervisor for the county's
Public Facilities and Resources Department, said park rangers haven't
found a practice bomb or rocket in two decades. But he urges park
visitors not to wander off trails into unexplored wilderness.</TE>
<TE>   The practice bombs contain an explosive charge designed to expel a
puff of smoke to let pilots know whether they hit their target. But
about 10% of the charges didn't detonate. Decades of age and exposure
have made these bombs unstable and more dangerous, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "It may not kill you, but you'll lose a finger or a hand," said
Debra Castens, a program manager with the Los Angeles district of the
Army Corps of Engineers, which is the lead federal agency overseeing
the former Trabuco Bombing Range.</TE>
<TE>   The corps is focused on cleaning up the most dangerous sites
first. On a scale of 1 to 5 -- with 1 being the highest priority --
the Trabuco Bombing Range is rated 2. In 1993, the corps concluded
that surface contamination no longer exists there, but underground
ordnance remained a concern.</TE>
<TE>   Cleanup is expected to cost $2.7 million, according to a 2001
General Accounting Office report to Congress. But there won't be
enough money in the corps budget to start the job until 2023. Plans
include surveying the ground with magnetometers and other types of
metal detectors as well as ground-penetrating lasers, removing any
ordnance that's found and sampling the soil for hazardous chemicals.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, state officials began combing unexploded-ordnance
sites in California. Most are in deserted areas, but the Trabuco
Bombing Range "grabbed our attention," said John Scandura, a branch
chief with the state Department of Toxic Substances Control office in
Cypress, which is working with the corps, city and county on public
education efforts near the old Trabuco Bombing Range.</TE>
<TE>   "The maps we had showed roads out there, and when staff followed
the roads to where the bombing range was supposed to be, it was right
smack in the heart of Rancho Santa Margarita," he said. "We think the
probability of encountering these kinds of substances in the areas
that were developed [is slim], but what we are concerned with is that
a big part of that practice bombing range was within O'Neill Regional
Park."</TE>
<TE>   The state agency plans to meet with the corps before the end of
the year to see if the cleanup can begin sooner than 2023.</TE>
<TE>   Though records indicate that the ordnance used at Trabuco was
practice bombs and rockets, state and federal officials confirm
government-watchdog charges that record-keeping was lax during the
time the bombing range was operated.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is because the records are so bad, there are some
places where everything is supposed to be practice bombs, and it's
not," Siegel said.</TE>
<TE>   Local, state and federal officials emphasize that the likelihood
of encountering a practice bomb or rocket is slim and that if one is
found, the explosive fuse was likely detonated when it hit its mark a
half-century ago.</TE>
<TE>   However, they warn anyone who sees ordnance to call police and to
avoid handling it.</TE>
<TE>   "Call 911. Don't touch it, don't kick it, don't bring it home,
don't move it," Castens said. "You walk away from it."</TE>

<HD>Full-Time Pay No Guarantee of Busy Legislature</HD>
<DH>The lawmakers ought to be locked down and not allowed to
leave until Christmas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>George Skelton</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>Sacramento</DL>
<LD>Sacramento</LD>
<LD>   Where is everybody? Where's the Legislature? The governor? The
Capitol's practically deserted.</LD>
<LD>   Didn't the voters put these lawmakers on full-time pay 36 years
ago?</LD>
<TE>   The idea wasn't just to jack up their salaries by nearly triple,
which I always suspected, but to enable legislators to be more
responsive to a constantly changing California. If this were a
"full-time" Legislature, it could move at top speed in times of
urgency.</TE>
<TE>   Also -- so the pitch went -- lawmakers, with their greatly
expanded staffs, wouldn't need merely to await signals from the
governor and implement his vision. They could act independently,
using their own expertise.</TE>
<TE>   Four decades later, legislative pay is up to $99,000. For leaders,
it's $113,850. Lawmakers also get $125 per diem, tax-free, seven days
per week while in session.</TE>
<TE>   Frankly, this bunch is no more responsive -- and it's less
independent -- than those old "part-time" legislatures. To be fair,
term limits has caused a gradual deterioration of the institution.
But that's another column.</TE>
<TE>   This column is about lethargic legislators moving at
quarter-speed, waiting for the governor's vision, while the state
goes belly up.</TE>
<TE>   What could be more urgent than staunching the bleeding of scarce
tax dollars and finding enough revenue to, say, keep health clinics
open, prisoners behind bars and disabled old people in nursing homes?
School kids in manageable class sizes and college students in
affordable universities?</TE>
<TE>   "We're very anxious," says David Janssen, chief administrative
officer for L.A. County. Already, he says, supervisors have cut $350
million in health services, closing 17 clinics. There's still a
$300-million shortfall. Hospitals in the Antelope Valley and Downey
are threatened with closure.</TE>
<TE>   Remember, 70% of the state's general fund flows to local
governments and schools.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis has agreed to call a special legislative session
on health care in January, concurrent with opening of the regular
session. A special session allows expedited action.</TE>
<TE>   Last week's stunning announcement by nonpartisan Legislative
Analyst Elizabeth G. Hill expedited everybody's budget thinking, if
not action.</TE>
<TE>   Hill announced that the $99-billion, presumably balanced state
budget Davis signed just 10 weeks earlier now is projected to run
$6.1 billion in the red.</TE>
<TE>   At this rate, she continued, the budget for the next fiscal year
will be $21.1 billion short -- for projected general fund spending of
$85 billion.</TE>
<TE>   That follows this year's original $23.6-billion shortfall, which
was papered over largely with gimmicks.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, Hill noted, spending is badly out of kilter with
revenues. She projected double-digit deficits far into the future
even after the economy turns around.</TE>
<TE>   The sooner this is resolved, the less pain for politicians and the
public.</TE>
<TE>   Definitely got to do something, the politicians agree. Maybe as
soon as January or February, say ruling Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   But why wait? "The governor ought to call us back into special
session and we ought to start dealing with this immediately," says
Senate GOP Leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga.</TE>
<TE>   OK, it's bad timing. The election was only two weeks ago and the
winners are tired. Besides, this is a lame-duck Legislature -- in
recess since Aug. 31 -- and the state Constitution forbids it from
passing a bill after Nov. 15. The Constitution does not, however,
forbid committees from delving and leaders from negotiating.</TE>
<TE>   The new Legislature convenes Dec. 2 for a brief swearing-in
ceremony. The lawmakers ought to be locked down and not allowed to
leave until Christmas. They're being paid. Get crackin'.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has chatted on the phone with legislative leaders and
invited them to meet with him this week to discuss options.</TE>
<TE>   Here are my suggestions:</TE>
<TE>   * Boost the vehicle license fee back to where it was before Davis
took office. That generates $3.8 billion. Democrats can do it on a
majority vote. A no-brainer.</TE>
<TE>   * Schools are being paid $1.9 billion more than they're entitled,
Hill discovered. Grab back the money.</TE>
<TE>   * Every couple with taxable income above $75,450 now pays the same
9.3% tax rate. Boost it to 10% at $260,000 and 11% at $520,000, as
advocated by Senate Leader John Burton (D-San Francisco). Raises $3.3
billion. But this requires a two-thirds vote and Republicans balk.</TE>
<TE>   * Medi-Cal recipients now update their eligibility annually.
Require it quarterly, weed out fraud and save $150 million,
Republicans contend. Fine. Do it.</TE>
<TE>   * Get bold. Apply the sales tax to services -- like auto repairs,
sports events, computer support. Engineering and lawyering. Political
consulting. Maybe lower the tax rate and still raise billions.</TE>
<TE>   This fiscal mess needs the attention of a full-time Legislature.
Now.</TE>

<HD>Bishops' Response Received Warily</HD>
<DH>Plan for dealing with sex abuse has many wanting more
accountability while reaffirming faith.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In adopting a final plan last week to deal with sexually abusive
priests, the nation's Roman Catholic bishops seemed certain they had
turned a corner on the debilitating scandal. But in parishes
throughout Southern California on Sunday, many parishioners called it
only the first step in a long road to recovery.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't think the church is past the worst of the scandal," said
Kevin Kane, a parishioner for 15 years at St. Monica Church in Santa
Monica. "The rooting out of the problem and the healing of the
betrayal of trust will take many years."</LD>
<LD>   Kane's remarks underscored the acute concerns that many Catholics
still have: While a uniform national plan may now be in place to
protect children and to deal with priests accused of sexually
molesting them, measures are still lacking to hold bishops
accountable or to force changes in the clerical culture of secrecy
that allowed abuses to go uncorrected for decades.</LD>
<TE>   The many good priests who have been smeared by the actions of a
few are still despondent and a severe crisis of trust in the church
hierarchy has emerged among many priests and laity alike.</TE>
<TE>   "The church has not necessarily turned the corner on the crisis,
but it has taken an important first step," said Father Jarlath
Cunnane, pastor of St. Thomas the Apostle Church in the Pico-Union
district of Los Angeles. "There is still the work of healing and
reconciliation that has to take place."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, visits to six Southern California parishes
Sunday also turned up forgiving attitudes toward fallible priests.
Some parishioners expressed suspicion of false abuse claims aimed at
financial profit. Others advocated an end to priestly celibacy -- or,
as 36-year-old auto worker Amado Jimenez put it, allowing priests to
live "normal lives [so] they wouldn't have to live secret lives."</TE>
<TE>   And parishioners, one after another, declared that the scandals
had not affected their faith at all.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to change my faith and what I believe because of a
few bad priests, like I wouldn't change who I am because of a few bad
African Americans," said Naiyma Huston, a parishioner at Holy Name of
Jesus Church in South-Central Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "We come here looking for God, not because of priests," said
Vicente Rodriguez, 52, a construction worker and parishioner at St.
Thomas the Apostle.</TE>
<TE>   However, it appeared that many parishioners were no longer paying
such close attention to the scandal, which ignited an international
furor in January with disclosures that Boston church leaders had
knowingly reassigned sexually abusive priests to several parishes.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, many parishioners approached were unaware that the
nation's Roman Catholic bishops had met last week in Washington to
hammer out revisions for a final sex-abuse policy. The lack of
awareness seemed particularly evident in largely immigrant churches,
such as St. Thomas the Apostle and Dolores Mission Church, in part
because the Spanish-language news media have not scrutinized the
scandal as closely, Cunnane said.</TE>
<TE>   The bishops met to revise their earlier plan, adopted in Dallas,
because the Vatican had demanded clearer due-process protections for
accused priests. Under the final plan adopted last week, an accused
priest would face judgment by a church tribunal made up of canon
lawyers serving as judges. If found guilty, the priest would be
permanently removed from the ministry and possibly defrocked.</TE>
<TE>   Before the Vatican intervention, the policy, as adopted in Dallas,
had pretty much left the process in the hands of the bishops. That
had caused great anxiety among priests, but many seem to be
cautiously backing the tribunal system as a more objective process.</TE>
<TE>   "We've all had to live with the reality that we are just an
800-number phone call away from the possibility of having to deal
with a very serious allegation," said Our Lady of the Assumption
Pastor Tom Welbers, referring to the Los Angeles Archdiocese's
sex-abuse hotline number. "A lot of priests were feeling very
uncertain as to whether there would be arbitrary action taken as a
result of allegations."</TE>
<TE>   Still, many priests are still depressed about the scandals. Just
recently, Cunnane said, a stranger accosted him at a fast-food
restaurant and began spewing expletives at him about priests and sex
abuse.</TE>
<TE>   "We've all lost something through this," he said. "There's been a
certain loss of public reputation ... and the rebuilding of that will
take time."</TE>
<TE>   Many say that major changes in the way the church governs itself
are still needed. At St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Church in Rowland
Heights, parishioners criticized everything from secrecy and poor
management to a lack of genuine consultation and collaboration
between the laity and clergy.</TE>
<TE>   At Holy Family Church in South Pasadena, parishioner and lawyer
Bob Carlson, 72, called on the church to be "much more open, much
more willing to debate and discuss and explain the various doctrines
people are concerned about."</TE>
<TE>   In short, many say, the church's work in moving toward redemption
has only just begun.</TE>
<TE>   "Broken trust doesn't get fixed with a few Band-Aids," said
Catherine Morris, 68, a parishioner at Dolores Mission Church in
Boyle Heights and member of the Los Angeles Catholic Worker. "Serious
work has to be done. Credibility will have to be earned."</TE>

<HD>How Do They Get to Carnegie Hall? Raise $180,000</HD>
<DH>Ojai band and choir students are invited to perform. Now
all they need is to fund the trip.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gail Davis</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Miles Davis played Carnegie Hall. So did Pablo Casals and
Tchaikovsky.</LD>
<LD>   But unlike Brad Halverson, who plays bassoon and saxophone in
Nordhoff High School's symphonic band, they didn't have to juggle
school work or pitch candy for a chance to play at the fabled New
York venue.</LD>
<LD>   Brad, 16, is among 120 Nordhoff band and choir students who have
been invited to join other award-winning choristers from across the
country in performing Mozart's Requiem at Carnegie Hall in April.</LD>
<TE>   Before the Ojai contingent starts packing, however, it must raise
$180,000 to make the trip. With the help of a parent booster group,
they are using everything from silent auctions to fund-raising
concerts and candy sales to meet their goal.</TE>
<TE>   These aren't the only Ventura County students invited to play in
some of the world's greatest concert halls.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura's Buena High School band played in Castellon, Spain, last
year and has been invited to perform in Rome. Westlake High School's
band will perform at the Sydney Opera House in Australia in July.</TE>
<TE>   Such high-profile music events have become more common in recent
years among high school students.</TE>
<TE>   For the last five years, Bill Wagner, Nordhoff's music director,
has used big performance trips to inspire and motivate his students.
April's trip will be the second he has organized to the Big Apple.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to paying their own way, Nordhoff's students must
master seven fugal choruses that Mozart was working on when he died.
But Wagner, 41, has a reputation for setting high standards for his
students, and Nordhoff's band and choir routinely place high in
competitions.</TE>
<TE>   Wagner weaves music theory into choir and band practices and
encourages private lessons. In fact, about half the band members and
a third of the choir receive private instruction. Many students also
perform in local theater productions, and several instrumentalists
play in jazz combos and other groups.</TE>
<TE>   Although a big event like the New York concert can be
intimidating, Wagner said he expects his students to perform like
professionals, whether it's at a local parish hall or Carnegie Hall.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a whole new venue," Wagner said of the famed New York
theater. "But in terms of their reaction when they walk out onstage,
I think it will be one of, 'Yes, we've been here before. We know what
to do.' "</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, his students are already compiling their sightseeing
lists. The Empire State Building and ground zero of the 9/11
terrorist attack rank high. Higher still is dinner and a Broadway
show. "The Producers," they say, would be cool, but it's sold out.</TE>
<TE>   But all this costs money, and the students must still pay their
own way. That means juggling school, homework, SATs and a social
life, while raising the princely sum of $1,400 each.</TE>
<TE>   Although some parents will help with the costs of their child's
trip, sharing in the financial responsibility is as important a
lesson for students as studying Mozart, Wagner said. So now, the work
begins.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman Emma North, a 14-year-old flutist, has staked out her
candy-selling table in front of a Vons supermarket.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Ruben Salinas, 17, who sings bass and plays saxophone, is
selling candy, giving private music lessons and performing in a jazz
group. He said he might even play sax some days next to Emma, by the
supermarket door.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Breann Keller, 17, is baby-sitting, and senior Das Baker,
17, plans a whole range of activities, plus, he says, "a wing and a
prayer."</TE>
<TE>   And of course, they all practice, practice, practice.</TE>
<TE>   "Somewhere in the weeks before, it's going to hit me," Brad said.
"I'm performing where Miles Davis and Tchaikovsky played."</TE>

<LD>Lucy Santana sees it every day: hundreds of young girls with little
hope for the future and seemingly nowhere to turn.</LD>
<LD>   She is the executive director of Girls Inc., an after-school and
outreach program for preteen and teenage girls that reaches about
1,200 youngsters in Orange County each year. But Santana worries
about the many who fall between the cracks.</LD>
<LD>   "We wish we could reach more," she said.</LD>
<TE>   From its Costa Mesa office, Girls Inc. serves 14 elementary,
middle and high schools with programs on topics such as career
counseling, leadership development, math and science instruction and
healthy and unhealthy relationships.</TE>
<TE>   Girls Inc. is aggressive in its mission to help girls become
"strong, smart and bold," Santana said.</TE>
<TE>   The agency received a $15,000 grant from last year's Los Angeles
Times Holiday Campaign. This holiday season, The Times is
highlighting Southern California agencies helped by its annual
fund-raising drive.</TE>
<TE>   In their presentations at schools, Girls Inc. counselors try to
get at-risk girls to interact with positive role models. They take
the students to workplaces such as courthouses, where they talk with
attorneys, judges and police officers.</TE>
<TE>   The counselors also tackle difficult subjects, Santana said. "We
need to address the realism of what's going on out there with our
teens," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "They are talking about sex, they are talking about drugs and
they're being exposed to [these things] in their schools, in the
neighborhoods and through the media."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the long odds against reaching all who need their
services, Santana said, the payoff is the many success stories the
agency records -- such as that of the shy young woman who came to
them as a high school freshman, newly arrived from Mexico and unable
to speak much English.</TE>
<TE>   She heard a Girls Inc. representative speak at her school and
signed up for tutoring. Her progress was so dramatic, Santana said,
that she was coaxed into speaking at a donors luncheon, where she
described -- in fluent English -- the difference the organization had
made in her life.</TE>
<TE>   She is now a student at San Diego State University, Santana said,
the first in her family to attend college.</TE>
<TE>   The Times Holiday Campaign, established in 2000, is part of the
Times Family Fund, a fund of the McCormick Tribune Foundation. The
McCormick Tribune Foundation matches the first $700,000 raised at 50
cents on the dollar.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the holiday appeal and matching funds from the
foundation raised $653,000, which was granted to 56 charities serving
Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura counties.</TE>

<HD>Jewish Defense League's Rubin Is Eulogized by Rabbi as a
Hero</HD>
<DH>Mourners gather in Sylmar for burial. Activist's family
again calls for probe of the events surrounding his death in custody.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeff Gottlieb</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Irv Rubin was eulogized Sunday as a hero who dedicated himself to
helping other Jews and to fighting anti-Semitism.</LD>
<LD>   "For the last three decades, Irv Rubin's name has been synonymous
with caring, with helping, with doing," Rabbi Tzvi Block told the 175
people who gathered at Sholom Memorial Park in Sylmar. "His entire
life was for the Jewish people. He was a Jewish hero, and it will be
noted for time to come."</LD>
<LD>   Although he wore a yarmulke in public, Rubin was not a religious
man, Jewish Defense League spokesman Brett Stone said. Still, he was
buried following Jewish traditions, in an unadorned pine casket. An
electric menorah behind it cast its light on the casket.</LD>
<TE>   Rubin died Thursday, nine days after authorities say he tried to
kill himself in the Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los
Angeles by slitting his throat with a jail-issue safety razor and
then jumping 18 feet to a concrete floor.</TE>
<TE>   Rubin, 57, had been held without bail for 11 months for allegedly
planning to bomb a Culver City mosque and the office of Rep. Darrell
E. Issa (R-Vista), who is Lebanese American.</TE>
<TE>   The JDL's leader for 17 years had pleaded not guilty, as had his
co-defendant and chief aide, Earl Krugel. Krugel remains in jail.
Krugel's brother, Barry, is the JDL's weapons instructor.</TE>
<TE>   Rubin never was known for his subtlety. He once offered $500 to
anyone who killed a member of the American Nazi Party and had fought
with Ku Klux Klan members on TV.</TE>
<TE>   Mainstream Jewish leaders denounced him and said his
organization's membership was minuscule.</TE>
<TE>   But the service portrayed a man dedicated to helping anyone who
needed him, and didn't mention his clashes with other Jewish leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Block, whose voice quavered with emotion at times, praised Rubin's
work. "Who else did anybody call in Los Angeles if they had a problem
or trouble?" the rabbi said.</TE>
<TE>   The most inflammatory language came in a statement from Krugel
that his lawyer read. Krugel denounced the Jewish establishment,
saying its leaders "gave new meaning to the words weak and timid,"
and called them "fearful myopic dwarfs."</TE>
<TE>   What seemed to be most on mourners' minds, though, was how Rubin
had died. In a statement distributed to the news media before the
funeral, his family continued to call for an independent
investigation into his death.</TE>
<TE>   There were whispers of conspiracy -- why didn't cameras inside the
jail record his leap? -- talk of prison enemies, such as Muslims and
members of the racist Aryan Nations who might have wanted to kill
him. People asked why someone known as a fighter, with a wife and two
children, would commit suicide, which Jewish law prohibits.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm saying he was killed," Bill Maniaci, a retired police officer
from Reno who is the new JDL leader, said after the funeral.</TE>
<TE>   Federal authorities have said no one was within 15 feet of Rubin
when he went over the balcony. Rubin's lawyer, Peter Morris, has said
Rubin had lost 60 pounds while imprisoned and had seen a prison
psychologist.</TE>
<TE>   The mourners were friends and family and some people who knew of
Rubin and wanted to pay their respects. One of those who attended was
conservative KABC radio talk show host Larry Elder. Rubin had once
led a demonstration to ensure that Elder's show remained on the air.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought of him as a courageous champion for what he believed
in," said Elder, wearing a lapel pin with the U.S. and Israeli flags.
"I thought of him as a hothead who often led with his mouth, but not
someone who would kill people."</TE>

<HD>Tribe Wrangles Over Burial Site</HD>
<DH>Ancient graveyard is to be site of O.C. school's sports
fields. Juaneno faction wants it left alone.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dave McKibben</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The one point on which everyone agrees is that the rugged, 29-acre
spread in San Juan Capistrano is a graveyard, most likely the resting
spot of early inhabitants of a tribal village known as Putiidhem.</LD>
<LD>   Beyond that, the land speaks of conflict.</LD>
<LD>   Indian tribal members who trace their ancestors to the land are
divided on what they'd like to see done with it. One faction wants it
left as is -- open and untouched. Another is willing to strike a
bargain with developers. A third group hopes an interpretive center
will someday be built on the land. There has also been talk of
building a casino on the property.</LD>
<TE>   The city-approved use -- an athletic complex for a Roman Catholic
high school -- has driven another wedge into the long-running dispute
over the property's fate.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of Junipero Serra High School intend to open the campus
next fall across the street from the burial site. Barring last-minute
obstacles, the tribal land itself will be used for tennis courts, a
gymnasium and playing fields. In a split vote, the San Juan
Capistrano City Council approved the plan last month.</TE>
<TE>   One faction of the Juaneno tribe is willing to live with the
athletic fields, as long as the administrators agree not to destroy
any burial sites and to erect monuments recognizing tribal leaders
and religious figures.</TE>
<TE>   "We've never made a statement supporting any development there,"
said Joyce Stanfield Perry, a tribal manager speaking for David
Belardes, a Juaneno leader who has monitored archeological sites in
the past. "But it's private land, and we don't control it. So we did
the best we could to preserve our culture."</TE>
<TE>   Two other factions of the tribe have come together in opposition
to the plan, though one wants the land left unspoiled while the other
has reluctantly agreed with a state preservation group that an
interpretive center should be built there.</TE>
<TE>   "To have a tourist attraction on my cemetery is offensive, but we
were backed into a corner," said Damien Shilo, a 45-year-old San Juan
Capistrano resident and leader of one tribal faction. Junipero Serra
High officials, whose search for a school site has spanned four
years, have tried to steer clear of the tribal dispute, while at the
same time proceeding with their plans.</TE>
<TE>   "We are trying to build a Catholic high school," said Marc
Spizziri, a founder of the school. "It's disconcerting to have all
this divisiveness."</TE>
<TE>   The school, across Junipero Serra Road from the burial site, is
scheduled to open in 10 months, welcoming an inaugural class of
freshmen and sophomores. School leaders have held prayer blessings.</TE>
<TE>   They've broken ground on a cafeteria. Parent-teacher nights have
been held.</TE>
<TE>   The Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange has been reluctant to get in
the middle of the land dispute. Bishop Tod D. Brown was scheduled to
attend a public blessing of the site three weeks ago, but the event
was abruptly canceled. School officials said the event was postponed
because of the threat of rain and because a school booster had a
change in his schedule.</TE>
<TE>   But Msgr. Lawrence J. Baird, press secretary for the Diocese of
Orange, said Brown never planned to attend the event.</TE>
<TE>   The blessing was held a week later and attended by Msgr. Paul
Martin, a priest at the city's historic mission.</TE>
<TE>   The land dispute may also have frightened off the Capistrano
Unified School District, which had been eyeing the land for years as
a site for a middle school.</TE>
<TE>   Supt. James A. Fleming recently announced that the district, which
could condemn the land and take it for public school property, is no
longer interested in the site.</TE>
<TE>   Archeologists have been studying the land in northern San Juan
Capistrano for years and have differed on what it holds.</TE>
<TE>   Pat Martz, an archeologist at Cal State Los Angeles, said the
tribal village dates to the 1400s when it was known as Putiidhem, the
ancestral home of the Acjachemen nation.</TE>
<TE>   Martz believes there might be as many as 175 burial sites on the
land.</TE>
<TE>   Henry Koerper, a Cypress College professor and expert on Orange
County prehistory, has studied the site for 20 years and puts the
number of burial plots at only seven.</TE>
<TE>   The Juanenos have broken ranks before over the land.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, the tribe split into three groups when some members
accused Belardes, then the tribal chairman, of negotiating an
agreement with Nevada investors that would have placed a casino on
the burial site.</TE>
<TE>   Though Belardes' group denied the accusation, Shilo, the leader of
a rival faction, said his group pulled out of the casino negotiations
after learning that the 29-acre parcel would be the site for the
gaming hall.</TE>
<TE>   According to Shilo, the deal called for a Nevada group to acquire
the land for a gambling and museum complex.</TE>
<TE>   In exchange, Shilo said, the group would lobby for the Juanenos to
get federal recognition, making them Orange County's first federally
recognized tribe.</TE>
<TE>   That recognition, which the tribe has sought for years, would make
the Juanenos eligible for various government programs and would give
them the right to offer certain forms of gambling.</TE>
<TE>   Perry said Belardes never considered the land as a site for a
gambling hall.</TE>
<TE>   "We were looking at a host of other sites,'' Perry said.</TE>
<TE>   "Twenty-nine acres would never be big enough for a casino anyway.
In fact, these days, it wouldn't even be big enough for the parking
lot."</TE>
<TE>   Sonia Johnston, who split from Belardes' group in 1993 and leads a
third faction of Juanenos, is adamantly opposed to anything -- casino
or sports fields -- on the land.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand the dilemma of the community, trying to sort all
this out," said Johnston, a Huntington Beach resident.</TE>
<TE>   "But people are trying to sensationalize the tribal disputes
instead of looking at the immorality of all this. Children should not
be playing on a cemetery."</TE>
<TE>   Shilo, whose father was a tribal council member, is grudgingly
endorsing a plan by Martz's group to build a Native American
interpretative center on the burial site.</TE>
<TE>   The San Juan Capistrano City Council approved the school, on a 3-2
vote, after striking a deal that would pay the city up to $200,000 a
year in a student "head tax" and cap enrollment at 2,000.</TE>
<TE>   Since the city cleared the way for the school, Johnston and
Shilo's group have held several protests outside the fenced property,
hoping to build public opposition to the plan.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from legal action, there is little else tribal members can
do to halt the project.</TE>
<TE>   Shilo believes support for the tribe is growing throughout the
community, especially when people consider that the school is named
after Junipero Serra, the Catholic missionary blamed by many Native
Americans for the destruction of much of their culture.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd be against any development," Shilo said. "But it's a little
more ironic with Junipero Serra seemingly coming back from the grave
to stomp on our ancestors."</TE>

<HD>Landers Mementos Going on the Block</HD>
<DH>Writings to advice columnist are the most significant
auction items, daughter says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John M. Glionna</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>For more than four decades, she was a fixture at America's kitchen
table, her daily advice column reaching 90 million readers through
1,200 newspapers around the globe.</LD>
<LD>   Now, fans have a chance to acquire a small piece of Ann Landers,
who died in June at 83. Personal property and mementos spanning the
career of Esther "Eppie" Lederer -- her real name -- will be for sale
Sunday at an auction at Butterfields here and via the Internet.</LD>
<LD>   Included will be an archive of Lederer's personal correspondence
with Presidents Kennedy, Carter, Reagan and Bush (the first) as well
as Hollywood celebrities and international figures.</LD>
<TE>   There are autographed photos, scrapbooks and speeches, as well as
paintings and furniture collected by Lederer, the daughter of Russian
immigrants who rose to become one of the nation's most influential
women of her time.</TE>
<TE>   Also on sale are a George III mahogany tea table valued at $1,000;
a Louis XV-style walnut piano, estimated at between $4,000 and
$6,000; an early 18th century George I gilt wood mirror ($6,500 to
$8,000); and a pair of Chinese carved ivory lanterns ($3,000 to
$5,000).</TE>
<TE>   In an essay written for the Butterfields sales catalog, available
at www.butterfields.com, Lederer's daughter Margo Howard writes that
her mother was really more of a collector of people than objects,
which is "borne out by her fascinating trove of correspondence with
politicians, celebrities and other luminaries. Even coming from a
generation of pre-e-mail letter writers, Mother stands out as one of
the last great correspondents of all time."</TE>
<TE>   An auction spokesman said he expects the auction to be popular
with professional collectors. But an Ann Landers biographer said
Lederer's throng of loyal readers also might find it appealing.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're a national columnist read by 90 million people, day
in and day out, there are those who might feel they want a little
piece of you, to break a small chip off the rock of the icon," said
David Grossvogel, a Cornell University professor who did a computer
analysis of 10,000 Lederer columns for a 1986 book titled "Dear Ann
Landers: Our Intimate and Changing Dialogue with America's Best-Loved
Confidant."</TE>
<TE>   Born Esther Friedman, she married Jules Lederer, founder of the
Budget Rent a Car chain. She began writing her column in 1955 at the
Chicago Sun-Times, and in 1987 moved to the competing Chicago
Tribune. For years, she competed head to head with her twin sister,
Pauline Phillips, better known as Abigail Van Buren, author of the
Dear Abby column.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, she became "an important figure in American pop
culture history," said Catherine Williamson, Butterfields' director
of books, manuscripts and memorabilia. "She brought about a pivotal
moment when the advice column went from Miss Lonelyhearts to this
real confessional mode of journalism.</TE>
<TE>   "She was a platform for all kinds of medical and political
issues," Williamson said. "And on top of that, every day she wrote
this incredibly entertaining column."</TE>
<TE>   In the Butterfields warehouse lies an Ann Landers treasure trove,
including paintings and period pieces that decorated her
5,500-square-foot co-op along Chicago's fashionable Lake Shore Drive.</TE>
<TE>   But there are also items that speak of Lederer's personal style,
including a collection of original cartoon drawings like Johnny
Hart's B.C. sketch in which the bird asks the turtle: "What do you
get if you cross the Godfather with Ann Landers?" The answer:
"Someone who gives you advice you can't refuse."</TE>
<TE>   There's also the IBM Selectric III typewriter on which Lederer
composed her columns. Howard said her mother resisted all later forms
of technology, such as computers and answering machines, and kept
several Selectrics on hand to pillage for parts after the company
discontinued the model.</TE>
<TE>   "She was mechanically challenged, a Luddite from the word go,"
said Howard, a columnist for the online magazine Slate who is writing
a book based on letters she received from her mother.</TE>
<TE>   Also available is the typed manuscript with annotations of the
early draft of Lederer's book "The Teenager and Sex," in which she
broke new ground by offering frank answers to questions on
masturbation, penile implants and homosexuality -- topics rarely
discussed in her era.</TE>
<TE>   Howard recalls that her mother was a fierce Democrat who advised
presidents and other politicians. "Bobby Kennedy came to her when he
was considering running for president," Howard recalled. "And she
told him straight out: Don't do it. It's not your turn."</TE>
<TE>   Lederer also kept up a running dialogue with then-Vice President
Hubert Humphrey about her objections to the Vietnam War. In 1967,
Howard recalls, her mother went to South Vietnam to prove to Humphrey
that America should get out of the war.</TE>
<TE>   The auction items include the journal, uniforms, photographs and
film from Lederer's visit. Among the entries she wrote to herself in
a small reporter's notebook is this image: "The Viet Cong women are
the body draggers -- they drag the dead so we can't count them. We
have found mass graves."</TE>
<TE>   Howard said she has kept for herself several items of sentimental
value once owned by her mother. She confessed that she was a bit
mystified by people's desire to own something from a famous person.</TE>
<TE>   "I really don't get it," she said. "I was married to someone in
the movie business, and I never understood this concept of 'Oh my
God, he touched me! I'll never wash this hand again!' But it's a
reality."</TE>
<TE>   Judy Quantz, a 45-year-old mother from Castaic, said owning a
piece of Ann Landers would be something special.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was growing up, I couldn't talk to my Mom and I didn't
have any sisters, but Ann Landers was there for me," said Quantz, who
contributed to a Chicago Tribune Internet chat room the day after
Lederer died.</TE>
<TE>   "She had this saying: 'Wake up and smell the coffee.' And I have
really tried to be that way and not let details get in the way.</TE>
<TE>   "I've passed her advice on to my own kids. So I think it would be
nice to have a piece of Ann."</TE>

<HD>Going, Going, Gone: A Tiny Piece of the Red Planet for Just
$1,000</HD>
<DH>An auction house is moving into the 'very trendy' sale of
natural history items.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bettina Boxall</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>People looking for something really different, something with that
timeless, not-just-off-the-shelf quality had a place to go Sunday
afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   At a natural history auction at the I.M. Chait
Gallery/Auctioneers, nearly 300 items were offered, including a tiny
chunk of Mars, a slice of the moon, a fossil of a big fish eating a
little fish 35 million years ago and a dinosaur jaw.</LD>
<LD>   It was the first natural history auction for Chait, which more
typically sells Asian art, but is branching into the small but
growing market of ancient bones and the extraterrestrial.</LD>
<TE>   "It's very trendy now," said dealer Thomas Lindgren, who noted
that clients want something solid and enduring in these worrisome
days of terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Huge jaw bones and the like can also help fill a place up, said
James Walker, one of the auction organizers. Along with casual
buyers, a few museums and connoisseurs, customers include
"international clients who literally have more money than sense" and
45,000-square-foot palaces to decorate, he added.</TE>
<TE>   The partial slice of Mars was probably not for the palace owners.
It weighs only .444 grams.</TE>
<TE>   Recovered, according to the auction catalog, by "a rockhound who
moonlit as an engineer with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory," it's
unclear exactly where the martian meteorite was found. When the man's
wife urged him to clean up the rock piles in the backyard, he took
some specimens to UCLA, which in 2000 confirmed that two of them were
from Mars.</TE>
<TE>   The piece sold for $1,000 to an Internet bidder who was not
identified.</TE>
<TE>   A comparatively large slice of the moon -- 17.54 grams -- went
unsold when no bid came in high enough. It had been valued at $45,000
to $60,000.</TE>
<TE>   Lunar and martian meteorites, Walker said, "are some of the most
exotically expensive real estate on the planet."</TE>
<TE>   Only about 20 pounds of lunar meteorites have been found, and half
of them are in government collections, which is why they are sold by
the thin slice on the private market.</TE>
<TE>   A much smaller, less expensive piece of the same lunar meteorite,
recovered in the Sahara Desert in 1999 by nomadic Berbers, went for
$3,500 to a unidentified resident of the Los Angeles area.</TE>
<TE>   Auctioneer Izzy Chait, garbed in a Hawaiian shirt and coifed in a
ponytail, said he was pleased with the bidding, which came by phone
and Internet from the Middle East and Europe as well as the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles attorney James Wohl didn't have that far to go. At the
auction, just 10 minutes from his house, he picked up a few things
for his wife.</TE>
<TE>   Along with some gems, he bought her a grapefruit-sized meteorite
that slammed into Africa thousands of years ago, a fossil of an
amphibian trapped in ancient mud and some prehistoric shark's teeth.</TE>
<TE>   "She loves to collect," explained Wohl after placing two plain
brown shopping bags of his purchases on the front seat of his car for
the drive home.</TE>
<TE>   He hadn't spent any more money than he could have a few streets
over on Rodeo Drive, but his presents should definitely outlast the
latest fashion rage.</TE>

<HD>Nursing Home Comparisons Start on Web</HD>
<DH>Federal, state agencies rank care at facilities. But
Ventura County officials say prospective residents should visit
centers themselves.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Massie Ritsch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The data on 17,000 nursing homes that the federal government put on
the Internet last week provide only a starting point for selecting
homes and may not accurately measure their quality, say health-care
administrators and watchdogs in Ventura County.</LD>
<LD>   The new Web site, accessible at www.medicare.gov, is like a guide
to picking a college or buying a car.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a good piece in the chain of making a decision. I don't
think it's the only piece," said Sylvia Taylor, executive director of
Long Term Care Services of Ventura County, a nonprofit organization
that counsels families and inspects nursing homes.</LD>
<TE>   Ventura County has 170 facilities that offer various levels of
long-term health care, Taylor said. But the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services compares online only 22 that provide skilled
nursing care.</TE>
<TE>   On average, compared to all California nursing homes, inspectors
found fewer deficiencies at Ventura County facilities. But the
typical county nursing home had slightly more problems than the
national average.</TE>
<TE>   California nursing home residents are more likely to have bedsores
and be physically restrained, according to the survey. In Ventura
County, 21% of residents were restrained -- more than twice the
national average.</TE>
<TE>   Residents in the county and state receive more nursing attention
than those in the rest of the country. On average, nurses and their
aides are able to spend about four hours with each resident each day.</TE>
<TE>   Last week's Web launch, with an accompanying phone number
(800-633-4227), is part of an initiative to improve the quality of
nursing homes. The initiative includes government-funded training for
nursing home personnel. Data on home health agencies, hospitals and
doctors may follow.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Wells, Beverly Healthcare's operations director for Victoria
Care Center in Ventura and Maywood Healthcare Center in Oxnard, said
he welcomes the release of the information but cautions consumers
against using it to rank nursing homes.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the Web site compares homes by the number of
residents with acute confusion or delirium. Many consumers might
prefer a low number, while those looking to place a loved one who has
those problems might prefer a facility skilled in handling them. Such
a home would naturally have a higher number in that category.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't mean that they're worse than another facility," Wells
said. "Facilities accept different kinds of patients."</TE>
<TE>   California has two other Web sites that compare the state's 1,400
nursing homes: www.nursinghomeguide.org and www.calnhs.org.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how much the public will actually use [the sites],"
Wells said. "A lot of our customers, obviously, do not surf the Net a
lot."</TE>
<TE>   After the Health and Human Services Department rolled out its new
directory last week, Congress' investigative arm said the report-card
system was released prematurely and might confuse consumers. The U.S.
General Accounting Office has questioned the validity of the data.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor, whose office functions as county ombudsman, said she has
similar questions, having only scanned the Web site since its
unveiling.</TE>
<TE>   "My concern is, where is all the information coming from?" she
said. The federal government receives data on nursing homes from a
variety of sources, including state agencies and the homes
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Inspections of nursing homes offer just a snapshot of their care
and may occur as infrequently as once a year. Staff turnover is high
among the industry's caregivers, so the quality can change daily,
Taylor said.</TE>
<TE>   "To get the latest, up-to-the-minute information in our county,
they need to call the local ombudsman office," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Volunteers in Ventura County's ombudsman program visit nursing
homes every week for several hours. "We knock on every door, and we
visit with every resident we are able to visit with," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Inspectors report evidence of gross abuse and neglect but
otherwise try to resolve residents' complaints at the nursing home.</TE>
<TE>   Prospective residents and their families should always do their
own inspections, Taylor said.</TE>
<TE>   "Just go in," she suggested, "and use all your senses to see how
you really feel about placing a loved one in this facility."</TE>

<HD>County Stands Firm on Cutting Down Tree</HD>
<DH>Antonovich says Santa Clarita road needs widening. Talks to
save oak occur without him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Fausset</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles County officials have not changed their minds about the
need to cut down a 400-year-old oak tree in Santa Clarita despite
meetings over the weekend between environmentalists and a developer
trying to come up with a way to save the tree.</LD>
<LD>   County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who represents the Santa
Clarita Valley, maintains that the tree must be cut down to allow the
widening of Pico Canyon Road, spokesman Tony Bell said Sunday. The
road would lead to the proposed Newhall Ranch subdivision and its
21,600 homes.</LD>
<LD>   "If there's going to be development, [the residents] will need
roads," Bell said. "To ensure public safety and to mitigate traffic
congestion, this action must be taken."</LD>
<TE>   County officials have told developer John Laing Homes, which is
building a nearby subdivision, that it must cut down the tree to
widen the road from two to four lanes.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, a Laing representative met with the environmentalists
who had recruited Pacific Palisades resident John Quigley to climb
into the tree earlier this month -- a move that at least temporarily
has saved the tree and generated a public relations windfall for the
valley's anti-sprawl forces.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists said they were unable to contact Antonovich to
invite him to the meeting. Laing officials could not be reached for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Quigley, who was spending his 14th day in the tree Sunday, said
the negotiations with the developer were positive but "pointless
unless we have the county at the table."</TE>
<TE>   Though he looked like he could use a bath, the 42-year-old
reiterated his determination to stay until the tree was saved -- even
though he could miss a crucial game in his amateur basketball league
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm holding tight," he said. "I feel like we have a real shot at
a solution."</TE>
<TE>   Other supporters seemed upbeat Sunday as they gathered near the
chain-link fence that developers had erected around the tree Thursday
night. Weekend motorcyclists and families in SUVs motored by to cheer
on the activists, and children passed donation jars. When a Native
American wasn't beating a tom-tom, folk singer Fred Starner was
serenading families with an original composition praising the man
whose "body protects the tree."</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica resident Sheila Laffey, who has made a number of
environmental documentaries, skipped a meditation session to bring
her film crew to shoot footage.</TE>
<TE>   Quigley demonstrated one of the reasons why he has become popular
even in this conservative neighborhood when Laffey asked his opinions
on President Bush's environmental record.</TE>
<TE>   He paused, then garnered applause when he shouted, "I'm gonna keep
the focus on this tree."</TE>
<TE>   Lynne Plambeck, president of the environmental group Santa Clarita
Organization for Planning the Environment, would not discuss many
details of the three-hour meeting with the Laing representatives.</TE>
<TE>   But, she said, Laing made it clear that it wants to keep trying to
save the tree.</TE>
<TE>   "John Laing Homes wants to solve this issue in a
nonconfrontational, negotiated settlement," Plambeck said. "But the
big problem is the person who can stop this was not present at the
table -- Antonovich. As long as he says to cut down the oak and
doesn't want to look at other options, it's hard to see how we can
make any progress."</TE>
<TE>   Ideally, Plambeck said, she would like to see the road stay at two
lanes, though she would support efforts to build the road around the
tree.</TE>
<TE>   Public works spokesman Ken Pellman said those options are not
feasible. Pico Canyon Road will eventually connect to California 126
to the north, and with the valley's rapid growth, Pellman said, it
needs to have four lanes for the traffic. He added that a road that
wide cannot be built around the tree because the canyon is too
narrow.</TE>
<TE>   Quigley talked about some of his challenges since pitching camp in
the tree. Early on, he worried that a gunshot might have been fired
by pranksters trying to scare him. Another night, kids threw eggs.
And there was the rainstorm that had the branches swaying three to
four feet.</TE>
<TE>   But eventually, he said, any acts of opposition were overtaken by
acts of generosity and camaraderie.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday night was particularly pleasant for Quigley because his
girlfriend, Susan Cox, had climbed up to spend the night with him.</TE>
<TE>   Cox, a 36-year-old environmental consultant from Venice, had to
find a baby-sitter for her two children before she could hoist
herself into the tree for the night.</TE>
<TE>   It was a cold night, she said, but worth it.</TE>
<TE>   "He's one of my heroes," she said.</TE>

<HD>Officer Kills Suspected Car Thief</HD>
<DH>It is the LAPD's fifth officer-related shooting and second
gunshot fatality in three days.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daniel Hernandez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles police officer on Sunday afternoon fatally shot an
unarmed suspected car thief, the fifth officer-involved shooting and
second gunshot fatality in a string of unrelated incidents since
Friday night.</LD>
<LD>   Police said a two-officer patrol unit followed a stolen car just
after 1 p.m. for a few blocks to West 59th Place at Wall Street in
South-Central Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The car, a 2003 Mitsubishi Eclipse, had been reported stolen from
Lancaster on Sunday morning. It stopped in mid-block and began
backing up toward the officers' car, police said.</LD>
<TE>   The officer driving the patrol car got out of his vehicle and
ordered the driver of the stolen car to stop. The officer, "fearing
for his life, fired one round at the suspect," said Sgt. John
Pasquariello, a Los Angeles Police Department spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   The shot apparently penetrated the rear window of the car and hit
the driver, Pasquariello said. Paramedics pronounced the victim dead
at the scene.</TE>
<TE>   Before the shooting, a passenger in the stolen car had jumped out
and had been caught after a brief foot pursuit, police said. He was
arrested on suspicion of grand theft auto, police said. No weapons
were found on the suspects or inside the stolen car, police said.</TE>
<TE>   The officers, whose names were withheld, were not involved in any
of the four other officer-involved shootings since Friday,
Pasquariello said.</TE>
<TE>   The five shootings have left two dead from gunfire and two
juveniles dead after a car fleeing from police slammed into a tree.
No officers were injured in the incidents.</TE>
<TE>   About 7 p.m. Friday, police shot and killed a man in a Wilmington
cul-de-sac after he allegedly rammed his pickup truck into a police
car several times.</TE>
<TE>   Two hours later, two Wilshire Division officers shot a man running
away from a carport where another man had been shot. Both men were
seriously wounded.</TE>
<TE>   At 1 a.m. Saturday, police shot at a white Lexus driven by
suspected car thieves near Central Avenue at 53rd Street. Police said
the driver of the Lexus allegedly tried to run over an officer,
missed and crashed at a nearby intersection. Two underage passengers,

<HD>Dive Survives the Stuff of Fame</HD>
<DH>Mention on a national magazine's list of bars brought
irregulars to Tustin's Swinging Door. But things are getting back to
normal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Claire Luna</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mission Viejo has been named one of America's safest cities.
Disneyland, the Happiest Place on Earth, is in Anaheim.</LD>
<LD>   And Tustin, a city normally snubbed by superlatives, is the home
of what the men's magazine Stuff calls one of the country's 20 best
dive bars.</LD>
<LD>   Nestled in Old Town Tustin between an architect's office and the
city's one-room history museum, the Swinging Door is usually the only
sign of life past nightfall in a city the magazine characterized as
an "unlikely backwater town."</LD>
<TE>   The distinction lured throngs of what regulars deride as "yuppie
types," transforming the bar last spring into a trendy scene that was
the antithesis of the dive-y allure that had merited the magazine's
honor.</TE>
<TE>   But in the months that have passed since the January listing, the
bar has regained its "Cheers" appeal, and the crowd has thinned to
the regulars and a few holdovers drawn by the Stuff listing.</TE>
<TE>   Heather, one of two bartenders hired to handle the post-Stuff
weekend surge of customers, now works by herself on the more placid
Tuesday nights. Although she appreciates how a busy bar makes her
shift go by faster, she conceded that a crowd made up of the Stuff
demographic reduced the bar's appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "It was insane," she said. "It stopped being a dive and became a
destination for people from L.A. or San Diego. Now it's back to the
mellow vibe that got us in there in the first place."</TE>
<TE>   In a bar where everyone is on a first-name basis and a second
visit elevates a person to regular status, the customers are
breathing a collective sigh of relief that their getaway has escaped
from the clutches of national fame with no permanent damage.</TE>
<TE>   The clientele, which includes people at every point in their legal
drinking years, resent the listing's perfunctory, flawed assessment
of the place -- "All the bartenders have implants! Everyone is on
Prozac!"</TE>
<TE>   They mourn that no editor or writer thought to set themselves down
on one of the worn brown stools, soaking up a 34-ounce mug of beer or
a rum and Coke (there's not much Chardonnay served here) while
soaking in the stories that give the place its character.</TE>
<TE>   They could have met Ray, married five times and each night sidling
up to fading middle-aged women in an attempt to meet No. 6.</TE>
<TE>   Or Rick, a custom-car buff whose salt-and-pepper Santa Claus beard
swings like a pendulum as he runs the pool table.</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe Frank, a Carlos Santana look-alike in a polo shirt and
khakis who first came to the Swinging Door on a Monday night in 1974.
One of the many happily married men who frequent the bar, he has
brought his in-laws in for Thanksgiving evening pool games from the
time his children were small until they were old enough to come, too.
(Many of the regulars shy away from giving their last names, saying
that getting into identifying details takes away some of the
oasis-like feel of their haven.)</TE>
<TE>   Men like these prop up the bar at every neighborhood drinking
hole, so it's unclear at first glance why this spot in what Stuff
described as "a comatose bedroom community south of L.A." was pulled
into a list with dives in state capitals and such cities as Chicago
and New York.</TE>
<TE>   Other notables included the Burgundy Room in Los Angeles, where
the bar lights up whenever Johnny Cash's "Ring of Fire" plays on the
jukebox. At Madam's Organ in the Adams-Morgan neighborhood of
Washington, D.C., redheads drink Rolling Rock beer for half price.</TE>
<TE>   The Swinging Door has no such shtick. There's nothing you can
point to in the weathered room, its ceiling plastered with alcohol
and sports team promotional posters and its walls cluttered with
street signs and an incongruous autographed photo of porn star Peter
North, that elevates it above any other neighborhood bar.</TE>
<TE>   But that may be the point.</TE>
<TE>   Defying description beyond being an unpretentious place that's
cool without trying, a good dive is like former Supreme Court Justice
Potter Stewart's definition of pornography: You know it when you see
it.</TE>
<TE>   Customers say they come to the Swinging Door for the people, both
those in front of and behind the bar. The patrons include
beer-softened men in softball uniforms relaxing after a weeknight
game, businessmen with rolled-up shirt sleeves avoiding rush-hour
traffic and twentysomething women in tight jeans and T-shirts folding
themselves over one of the three pool tables for a shot.</TE>
<TE>   The bar, which has been operating under various names for 30
years, didn't always have such a diverse clientele. When it changed
ownership almost five years ago, the new proprietor made a hiring
policy change that completely transformed the bar's customer base and
permanently solidified old-timers' loyalty.</TE>
<TE>   That hiring change had to do with the bartenders.</TE>
<TE>   These days, most of the bartenders come equipped with a Sunset
Strip intensity of beauty -- rumor says one posed in Penthouse -- and
a Midwestern level of kindness, making them an attraction on their
own. Bartender Heather, on a recent night sheathed in a white tank
top and a pair of blue shorts that could fit into a beer can, is the
enticement for Tim Heuermann to come in on Tuesdays.</TE>
<TE>   While taking in a Lakers game recently, Heuermann alternated
between throwing back mugs of Coors Light and trying to tempt Heather
into a dinner date.</TE>
<TE>   A restaurant manager who lives in Foothill Ranch, 34-year-old
Heuermann started coming to the Swinging Door six months ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Going to most bars is a total production. You have to dress the
part, and everyone is there to pick up people rather than relax," he
said. "This is a come-and-unwind kind of place."</TE>
<TE>   As each night wears on and singles supplant the happily wed, the
jukebox choices switch from Jethro Tull-esque classic rock to current
artists such as Janet Jackson and Coldplay. Come-hither looks are
exchanged with increasing frequency, but even the men pushing hardest
for dates shyly admit they don't care if they strike out.</TE>
<TE>   "Honestly, as long as I can play some pool and chill while I'm
here, it's been a perfect night regardless of whether or not I get
someone's number," said Alex Golden, 25, a Marine.</TE>
<TE>   Golden started driving up once a week from Camp Pendleton after
seeing the Stuff listing.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a place where you don't want to burn bridges with other
people because you're all regulars," he said.</TE>

<HD>PG&amp;E Plans Go to Court</HD>
<DH>A bankruptcy judge will consider whether the utility or the
state has the better idea for reorganizing the giant power provider.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Reiterman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>With the future of California's biggest utility and the rates of
millions of customers in the balance, the Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co.
bankruptcy case heads into the home stretch Monday after a year and a
half of arguments over energy politics, money and the law.</LD>
<LD>   But the final sprint will be a long one. The hearings that could
culminate in the bankruptcy judge choosing either the giant utility's
reorganization plan or an alternative proposed by state regulators
are expected to take about six weeks, spilling into 2003.</LD>
<LD>   The outcome of one of the largest bankruptcy cases in history will
determine the shape of PG&amp;E as it emerges from Chapter 11.</LD>
<TE>   "What is at stake is the ongoing operations of one of the largest
utilities in the country (and) the consistent or uninterrupted
delivery of gas and electricity at rates which are reasonable," said
Ivan Kallick, head of the bankruptcy unit at the law firm Manatt,
Phelps and Phillips in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   If PG&amp;E has its way, the utility will be streamlined into a power
delivery service, and its valuable hydroelectric facilities will be
spun off to a sister company outside the reach of California
regulators. If the state Public Utilities Commission prevails, PG&amp;E
and its generation assets will remain under the PUC's authority. Each
says that no rate increases will be necessary, and that creditors
will be paid in full.</TE>
<TE>   Under the weight of $9 billion in energy-related debts, PG&amp;E
sought protection from creditors under federal bankruptcy laws in
April 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the company has logged 13,000 claims from creditors
amounting to $13.5 billion. Approximately $1.5 billion of the debt
has been paid, mainly to alternative-energy producers.</TE>
<TE>   The case is huge. Scores of hearings have been conducted in a
courtroom in a financial district office building here. The docket
shows that about 11,000 filings of all sorts have been made with the
court, some hundreds of pages long.</TE>
<TE>   Billings for professional fees exceeded $65 million for PG&amp;E and
the court-sanctioned committee of the company's creditors through
July, the U.S. Trustee's office reported this month, noting that the
utility's parent intends to seek reimbursement for approximately $110
million. Some lawyers for PG&amp;E have billed $5,000 to $8,000 for
14-hour-plus days. Such fees would come out of the company's assets.</TE>
<TE>   Experts estimate additional fees paid by other parties, ranging
from government agencies and energy companies to PG&amp;E vendors and
retirees, could amount to hundreds of millions dollars more before
the case is over.</TE>
<TE>   The confirmation hearings will revolve around the feasibility of
the plans, each of which have legal hurdles and require billions of
dollars in outside financing and the confidence of Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Dennis Montali ultimately will decide whether the plans meet
legal requirements and which one would best restore the company's
health, repay creditors and protect utility ratepayers. Both sides
have threatened appeals if they lose.</TE>
<TE>   Although PG&amp;E's initial plan won much wider support than the PUC's
in balloting by rank-and-file creditors, the PUC has formed an
alliance with the official Committee of Creditors in proposing an
amended plan.</TE>
<TE>   To prepare for the final battle, both sides have taken aim at the
opposition in briefs and signaled their intention to call batteries
of financial experts and other witnesses to press their case.</TE>
<TE>   Despite an unfavorable district court ruling on the issue, the PUC
has maintained that PG&amp;E is illegally trying to preempt numerous
state laws by transferring many assets into subsidiaries of its
parent, PG&amp;E Corp. Specifically, the commission said that a state law
passed at the height of the energy crisis bars utilities from
disposing of in-state generation assets until 2006.</TE>
<TE>   The commission also contended the utility's plan would result in
"dangerous gaps" in environmental protection of PG&amp;E's vast land
holdings and does not assure reliable natural gas service.</TE>
<TE>   "The PG&amp;E plan is a direct assault on the (state's) ability to
manage a statewide energy crisis," the PUC said.</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E officials declined to be interviewed for this article, but
previously have disputed the PUC point by point. The company's
amended plan calls for keeping most of the land holdings under PUC
jurisdiction.</TE>
<TE>   The utility said in a brief filed this month that the PUC lacks
the authority to implement its plan to maintain PG&amp;E's electricity
rates at levels that would cover the utility's costs and its debt
service for decades. "The PUC has no authority to bind future
commissions," the company said.</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E questioned the PUC's "good faith," saying that the commission
has failed to conduct proper public hearings, as promised, before
pressing forward with its reorganization plan.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the company said the PUC plan is not feasible because it
calls for massive financing, including issuance of $8.3 billion in
new debt, but would fail to return the company to an investment-grade
rating that would allow it to obtain enough financing.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer groups are not keen on either plan. They say that PG&amp;E's
would result in consumers paying far more for hydroelectric power in
the future. They consider the PUC's plan a "bailout" that will be
financed by artificially high rates and billions of dollars
accumulated since the PUC passed record electricity hikes during the
energy crisis of 2000-2001.</TE>
<TE>   "The PUC plan is lesser of two evils, but evil all the same," said
Nettie Hoge, executive director of The Utility Reform Network. "My
feeling is neither [plan] should be confirmed."</TE>

<LD>The election's over, and you the voter, you the Californian, think
your job is done, don't you? That you can just kick back and relax
until the next round of campaign ads cross your TV screen, right?</LD>
<LD>   Not so fast.</LD>
<LD>   Sure, you passed bond measures and changed the state budget by
voting, but if you live in one of two Assembly districts, your
assemblyman wants more. He wants you to help draft new laws.</LD>
<TE>   A couple of years back, Assemblyman Joe Simitian (D-Palo Alto) got
the idea that people in his district -- which includes the very
bright environs of a little academic institution called Stanford --
probably had some fair ideas about what would make for a good law.</TE>
<TE>   So he put together a contest -- "There Ought to Be a Law" -- and
found three winners among the submissions:</TE>
<TE>   AB 2472, which would require the state to set up a demonstration
project to cut the pesticides and herbicides used on Capitol grounds
and environs ... AB 2473, requiring a business declaring bankruptcy
to keep accepting gift certificates it issued before it declared
itself bankrupt ... and AB 2474, requiring that any antifreeze sold
in California have a bitter agent to counter any sweetness in the
liquid, so wildlife, pets and children won't be accidentally
poisoned, as has happened to California condors released into the
wild.</TE>
<TE>   All three bills were passed by the Legislature and became law.</TE>
<TE>   Now Simitian's colleague Alan Lowenthal, a Long Beach/Palos Verdes
Peninsula Democrat, has decided to conduct his own contest: You too
can make laws (without the big per-diem legislator bucks)! See the
governor sign your bill! Get to keep the pen!</TE>
<TE>   Residents of his 54th Assembly District have until Dec. 20 to send
along their bright ideas. Winners get their bills put into the 2003
legislative hopper, as well as a chance to testify at hearings on the
bills' behalf -- and the capper, lunch with the assemblyman.</TE>
<TE>   (Under the rubric "Be careful what you wish for, it might come
true": If this catches on, legislators might put themselves out of
business.)</TE>
<TE>   Learning Political Fisticuffs From Colonial</TE>
<TE>   Britain's Labor Party had a secret weapon in the dirty-tricks and
confidential-files work of its covert Attack Unit -- a California
ingredient.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Mulholland.</TE>
<TE>   The Times in London reported recently that the unit, with its
computer Excalibur, dates back to a meeting at a 1995 Labor Party
conference, when future Prime Minister Tony Blair authorized a
delegation to travel to the U.S. to study Democrats' campaign
tactics.</TE>
<TE>   The newspaper said delegates met Mulholland, a former Vietnam
helicopter pilot, political director of the California Democratic
Party and author of myriad in-your-face political pranks and
knife-edged quotes. It said Mulholland's philosophy was simple: "Let
me give you an example. The Republicans, say, are running on family
values. Then you find out that, say, a candidate knocked up a woman
25 years ago and she had an abortion. Boom! Someone asks him about it
at some public forum."</TE>
<TE>   The Labor Party embraced the idea, the paper said, keeping track
of opponents via spying and digging dirt, and secret files in
Excalibur -- the name of King Arthur's legendary sword.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought the way Bob Mulholland did," the newspaper quoted
Richard Elsen, a former head of the unit.</TE>
<TE>   "It was about kicking them to the floor and keeping them down. It
was a bare-knuckle fight, and there was a lot of mischief on all
sides."</TE>
<TE>   The Times said Mulholland "remains close to senior Labor Party
figures" and visited their headquarters as recently as June.</TE>
<TE>   Gotta be the frequent flier miles.</TE>
<TE>   A Fine Mess He's Gotten Himself Into</TE>
<TE>   So shut up and pay the two dollars -- plus $7,498.</TE>
<TE>   Six years after he hid the fact that he took $10,000 from a
congressional candidate's sister to pay for a campaign mailing on her
brother's behalf, former Orange County Democratic Party Chairman Jim
Toledano has been ordered -- the second time -- to pay a $7,500 fine
for violating federal election laws.</TE>
<TE>   The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals order ripped the Santa Ana
attorney for "his persistent lapses of memory [and] his demonstrated
penchant for playing fast and loose with the truth."</TE>
<TE>   It was 1996, and Democrat Jim Prince was running in the primary
against now-Rep. Loretta Sanchez for the Santa Ana congressional
seat.</TE>
<TE>   Toledano said he created a separate bank account in the Democratic
Party's name, made himself the sole signatory, and produced the
mailer without telling anyone else in the party -- because he knew
they would have stopped him.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he insisted that what he did was merely a "political sin"
-- a "trivial" breach that didn't hurt anyone.</TE>
<TE>   The court concluded otherwise, and quoted the lower court ruling
against Toledano that found such arguments to be frivolous and
far-fetched.</TE>
<TE>   Just pay the money, the court said, "as a sanction for his
bad-faith conduct and abuse of the judicial process." Now -- when is
that check in the mail?</TE>
<TE>   These Messages Are Just a Bit Garbled</TE>
<TE>   Had the San Fernando Valley seceded, would we have been in for not
only Valley-speak but Valley-spell?</TE>
<TE>   A motion by Valley-based Councilman Dennis Zine refers to the
"long struggle to address the evils of vice in our communities," to
which end he proposed an ordinance requiring police permits from
certain "message parlors" -- later referred to correctly as "massage
parlors."</TE>
<TE>   And a news release announcing a community meeting Thursday about
possible double-decking of the Ventura and Hollywood freeways
summoned residents with the warning, "We have no time to loose!"</TE>
<TE>   Points Taken</TE>
<TE>   * Former L.A. Mayor Richard Riordan, a Republican in the
nonpartisan job, seemed to get along fine with Democratic President
Clinton. But after he read in a recent Times story that Clinton urged
Gov. Gray Davis to spend primary-election dollars trying to knock
Riordan out of the GOP gubernatorial primary, Riordan e-mailed
Clinton, "You dirty rotten scoundrel. Let's have lunch and play golf
next time you are in Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   * An invitation to a Los Angeles Free Clinic dinner on Dec. 2
honoring, among others, county Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, prints on
the front the irresistible promise to Angelenos who seem congenitally
determined to get home before midnight from even the most enjoyable
party: "Once again, you'll be out by 10."</TE>

<HD>Meteor Shower Expected to Dazzle</HD>
<DH>'Grandaddy' of Leonid displays will be visible from most
yards. It will peak early Tuesday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hugo Martin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Leonid meteor shower, described by one astronomer as "the
granddaddy of all meteor showers," will produce a spectacular light
show throughout California early Tuesday morning despite a nearly
full moon.</LD>
<LD>   Dark, remote locations far from bright city lights, such as the
Inland deserts, will provide the best view of the shower. Still,
astronomers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena said the
shower will be so intense that it will be clear in most urban
backyards.</LD>
<LD>   "The darker the sky the better," said Don Yeomans, an astronomer
at JPL. "The full moon is going to make the sky brighter anyway. You
will get a pretty good view from just about any backyard."</LD>
<TE>   This year's meteor shower was first seen early Monday morning over
Europe and North Africa. It will peak in California about 2:30 a.m.
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The Leonid shower gets its name from the constellation where it
appears to originate: Leo the lion, which will rise out of the
east-northeast sky. Astronomers recommend that stargazers face east
but try not to stare at any particular point.</TE>
<TE>   The Leonids are grains of dust from Comet Tempel-Tuttle colliding
with Earth's atmosphere. Every year in mid-November, Earth crosses
the comet's orbit and the Leonid shower becomes visible.</TE>
<TE>   The comet itself appears every 33 years, and the meteor shower is
most intense around those years.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike some previous Leonid showers that generated about 15
meteors per hour, this meteor storm will be so close to Earth that it
will produce several hundred meteors per hour, Yeomans said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the granddaddy of all meteor showers," he said. "They
don't get much better than this."</TE>
<TE>   Most Leonids will appear as fleeting streaks of light, but JPL
scientists recommend that stargazers watch for bigger ones that
generate fireballs and trails -- some of which will remain visible
for several minutes or more.</TE>
<TE>   Most particles are tiny and will vaporize very high in the
atmosphere due to their extreme speed.</TE>
<TE>   They pose no threat to people on the ground, but experts said
there is a slight chance that the meteor shower can damage sensitive
electronic components on satellites orbiting the Earth.</TE>

officers in the area.</LD>
<LD>   Eighty-six people have died so far this year, up from the 63
travelers killed last year, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   In many cases, drivers lulled by the monotony of the landscape
fell asleep, said Capt. Lisa Lawrence, commander of the CHP's Barstow

<HD>Student Protesters Face Hearings</HD>
<DH>Some say the activists at UC Berkeley are being targeted
for their pro-Palestinian stance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michelle Munn</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>BERKELEY</DL>
<LD>Though criminal charges against 32 campus protesters were settled
three months ago, UC Berkeley is set to proceed this week with
hearings to determine if the pro-Palestinian students violated
conduct codes by occupying a building and disrupting class.</LD>
<LD>   Members of Students for Justice in Palestine last April organized
a rally on Holocaust Memorial Day at Sproul Plaza, the epicenter of
much of the mid-1960s Free Speech Movement. But instead of taking the
traditional path down Telegraph Avenue, the protesters marched to and
occupied nearby Wheeler Hall, where police arrested 78 people -- 41
of them students -- who allegedly refused to leave. Students used
bullhorns and created such havoc that classes and midterm exams in
the lecture hall had to be canceled, university officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Officials say that the protesters ignored repeated warnings not to
enter Wheeler Hall, and that pressing charges is necessary to ensure
that the university's academic mission remains uncompromised.</LD>
<TE>   "No matter how noble a cause may be, no group has the right to
infringe on the rights of other students to pursue their education,"
said John Cummins, assistant chancellor.</TE>
<TE>   Alameda County prosecutors had considered bringing a criminal case
against the students, but issued a "finding of factual innocence"
after a settlement was reached in June, said Deputy Dist. Atty.
Stuart Hing. "I felt we could prove [the case], but in the interests
of justice this didn't seem worth it," he said. The students paid a
collective fine of $3,000 and the arrests were removed from their
records.</TE>
<TE>   The day those charges were dropped, the university launched
student code of conduct proceedings against the students, nine of
whom did not contest the charges and subsequently settled their
cases.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining students assert that the university is being
pressured to take action beyond the criminal court fines. They say
officials have received a barrage of letters and complaints from
students, parents, teachers and angry benefactors threatening to
revoke future donations unless the university convenes the
disciplinary panels.</TE>
<TE>   "If prosecution is not taken, I guarantee none of my family's
money will go to your alumni fund," reads one of about 100 letters
obtained by a student attorney's public-records request. "I support
the ability of the universities to teach, not to allow such
disruptions." Another benefactor writes: "We have both been annual
contributors to a variety of fund-raising drives on campus. We will
make no further contributions until we see a radical change in the
attitudes and actions of your administration toward the Jewish
students and the Palestinian faculty and persons who disrupt the
education process in the name of the Palestinian cause."</TE>
<TE>   University spokeswoman Janet Gilmore said it is customary for the
university to receive letters on divisive issues. She said the
university has received more than 1,000 letters or e-mails in support
of the pro-Palestinian demonstrators, and expressed confidence that
the Office of Student Judicial Affairs and the Office of Student Life
would proceed with the student conduct hearings in an unbiased
fashion. "I doubt that they're aware of any of those letters. They
are truly pursuing these cases as a violation of student conduct."</TE>
<TE>   On June 7, the university issued notice to the "Wheeler 32,"
charging them with unauthorized entry or use of university property,
obstruction or disruption of teaching and disturbing the peace.
Sanctions could range from written warnings to expulsion.</TE>
<TE>   The first proceedings began Sept. 30 against student Roberto
Hernandez, but were postponed when his lawyers asked an Alameda
County judge to block the use of certain evidence. The judge denied
the request on Oct. 30, and the code hearing was scheduled to resume
Wednesday. Hernandez, an undergraduate at the time of the protest,
faces additional charges of resisting arrest and assaulting a police
officer.</TE>
<TE>   The university is withholding his diploma and barring him from
registering for his doctoral classes, pending the outcome of the
disciplinary hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Fifteen National Lawyers Guild pro-bono attorneys are leading the
students' defense. "What's unusual is how hard the university is
pushing this. It really seems to us that the harshness is bound to
the content of the students' message," said Dan Siegel, one of the
students' attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   The hearings come at a time of escalating violence in the Middle
East. Students at Princeton, Harvard and scores of other campuses
have called on their schools to divest holdings in companies that do
business with Israel.</TE>
<TE>   For Mike Froehlich, an SJP member and Boalt Hall School of Law
student helping the students' defense, free speech is exactly what
makes the university the right venue for debate. "Student protests
are always at the vanguard of political justice," he said. "Our
democracy, our society depends on speaking out."</TE>

<LD>All the children were above average in Newport Beach on Sunday.
Perfect, in fact, to their adoring audience.</LD>
<LD>   Three hundred and nine violins, cellos and violas strong, they
bowed and plucked in the afternoon sunlight, sending ribbon candies
of sound through the big auditorium at St. Andrew's Presbyterian
Church.</LD>
<LD>   Ages 6 to 17, they arrived in their parents' SUVs and sedans from
across Orange County for the 32nd Suzuki Festival Concert.</LD>
<TE>   Shinichi Suzuki pioneered a new form of music lesson in Japan 60
years ago, stressing that no child is mediocre and that talent is
learned. He believed that, like speech, music could best be learned
through intensive listening to and memorization of that "mother
tongue." Nurturing and encouragement are as important as learning to
read music.</TE>
<TE>   There was plenty of encouragement Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Lee, 42, of Irvine smiled at his daughter Michelle, 6, as
they checked for her nametag.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll do 'Twinkie, Twinkie' today," he announced.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not a twinkie!" retorted Michelle, clad in a long, white
dress, fancy shoes and a bow floating in her hair. "I'm doing my
recital. I'm playing 'Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star'!"</TE>
<TE>   Inside, teachers moved like maternal muses, herding groups of
youngsters on and off the stage. All the works were short, and
enthusiastically received in spite of the occasional tin note.</TE>
<TE>   "Mommy, how do I know when do I go?" Peter Debannah, 10, whispered
nervously, adjusting his red tie. After a 40-minute wait, it was his
turn, and his mom waved proudly as he strode confidently onstage.</TE>
<TE>   One row up, Phyllis Streed, 72, in town from Minnesota, couldn't
stop beaming as her granddaughter, Greta Streed, played Mozart on the
cello.</TE>
<TE>   "My only grandchild. Special, huh?" she said. Tapping her toe in
time to the music, she said, "I love orchestra; I'll take it over
band any day."</TE>
<TE>   To her right, Kurt Richardson wore out his hands clapping as his
older son, Dylan, 10, finished playing Vivaldi's Concerto in A minor.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a difficult piece. I saw the smile on his face when he
finished. I think he nailed it. All the lessons, all the time
practicing, the times he didn't want to play -- this is the payoff,
right here. You can't help but be proud."</TE>
<TE>   Toward the end, all the young musicians gathered for the finale.
Six-year-olds clutching violins barely bigger than Barbie dolls
bumped their way shyly onto the stage.</TE>
<TE>   Michelle Lee was front and center in her white dress, her bow
raised at attention.</TE>
<TE>   What is the sound of 309 instruments playing "Twinkle, Twinkle,
Little Star"?</TE>
<TE>   Joy. Loud and pure.</TE>

<HD>Once Virtual Slaves, 71 Thai Workers Win U.S. Residency</HD>
<DH>Freed in a 1995 raid at an El Monte sweatshop, they have
forged new lives in the U.S.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>K. Connie Kang</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seven years after 71 Thai workers were freed from virtual slavery in
an El Monte sweatshop, they now have permission to live permanently
in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   The workers, who were allowed to remain here after trial
proceedings on special visas provided to witnesses whose testimony
could endanger their lives, were notified by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service of their new legal status -- much-awaited news
that made some shout for joy.</LD>
<LD>   "I am happy, happy, happy," Sirilac Rongsakare said outside a
South Los Angeles garment factory where she now works.</LD>
<TE>   No longer will she have to worry about traveling to Thailand to
visit her family, Rongsakare said through an interpreter. While her
legal status was in limbo, she could not leave the country without
special permission. Now, she can change jobs or look for other
opportunities -- options she hadn't dared consider while waiting for
permanent residency, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The workers -- some of whom sewed for as long as seven years
behind razor wire and around-the-clock guards in El Monte -- will
receive their official green cards in three to six months, said their
attorney, Julie A. Su, of the Asian American Pacific Legal Center.</TE>
<TE>   Much has happened since Aug. 2, 1995, when authorities raided the
San Gabriel Valley factory and freed the workers who made less than
60 cents an hour. Their plight made headlines around the world.</TE>
<TE>   Along with 22 Latina workers, who were not held against their
will, they fought in the courts to collect years of back pay --
winning more than $4 million in settlements from big-name firms such
as Tomato Inc. and Mervyn's that did business with the operators of
the sweatshop. Settlements for each worker ranged from $10,000 to
$80,000, depending on how long they were there.</TE>
<TE>   Since they were freed, 22 of the Thai workers have married and
given birth to 18 babies. Some have left Los Angeles to follow their
spouses to the East Coast. Several have returned to Thailand. But
most remain in the Los Angeles area, sewing, cleaning homes and
working at restaurants. Many hold down two jobs to support relatives
back home.</TE>
<TE>   Rotchana Sussman, who married USC professor Steve Sussman nearly
four years ago, lives a life in Pasadena that she could not have even
imagined.</TE>
<TE>   The former Rojana Cheunchujit, who spent five years hunched over a
sewing machine 18 hours a day and who slept in a room infested with
mice and cockroaches with seven others, lives in a lovely home with
her husband and three children. She has given birth to a baby boy
since her marriage and brought from Thailand two children from a
prior marriage whom her husband has adopted. Her parents now own a
convenience store, and her sister has a noodle stand -- thanks to the
money she sent them. Her mother has visited Pasadena once, and now
she hopes to have her father visit them, too.</TE>
<TE>   "My life is unbelievable," Rotchana Sussman said in fluent
English. "It's like a movie."</TE>
<TE>   Sutchai Chaisuni , among the sickliest during the confinement, is
now a healthy and busy licensed vocational nurse who travels between
two Kaiser Permanente medical facilities on the Westside.</TE>
<TE>   "I love taking care of patients -- especially old people," said
Chaisuni, who aspires to be a registered nurse.</TE>
<TE>   Another, one of four male workers held captive, owns the garment
factory where Rongsakare and eight other former El Monte workers are
employed.</TE>
<TE>   Portraits of Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej and Queen Sirikit
are displayed prominently inside the office of this entrepreneur, who
doesn't want his name or the name of his business mentioned. Two
other former captives -- Win and Sukanya Chuai-Ngan -- operate a Thai
restaurant in Van Nuys. They wed last year and threw a reception at
their restaurant. The couple were also awarded the 2001 Small
Business of the Year award from the Asian Pacific Islander Small
Business Program.</TE>
<TE>   The journey of the workers -- mostly young women from Thai
villages who were tricked into coming to the United States by
recruiters in Bangkok, where they had gone looking for work -- has
been remarkable at every turn.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving as tourists, they were met at Los Angeles International
Airport and taken directly to the El Monte apartment complex, where
their passports and valuables were confiscated. All had signed a
contract promising to pay back $5,000 in travel and other expenses.
They bought such necessities as toothpaste and soap at exorbitant
prices from the company store.</TE>
<TE>   Acting on a tip from the friend of an escaped worker,
investigators from the state Department of Industrial Relations
staked out the seven-unit apartment complex and gathered sufficient
information to obtain a search warrant.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 2, 1995, authorities raided the site. The working and
living conditions horrified even those professionals.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, the workers' story became a centerpiece of the
Smithsonian Institution's critically acclaimed exhibit on sweatshops,
"Between a Rock and a Hard Place: A History of American Sweatshops
1820-Present."</TE>
<TE>   Despite their ordeal, the workers appear to harbor no bitterness
toward the Thai family sweatshop operators, who included Suni
Manasurangkun, her five sons and two daughters-in-law.  Seven
defendants eventually pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy,
requiring indentured servitude and harboring illegal immigrants. In
1996, the ringleader, the matriarch of the family, was sentenced to
seven years in prison. Five others received sentences of two to six
years, and the seventh was deported to Thailand after cooperating
with the prosecution. All were ordered to be sent back to Thailand
after serving their sentences.</TE>
<TE>   Two other suspects are believed to have fled to Thailand.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles attorney Kathryn Morgan, a former Peace Corps
volunteer in Thailand who has befriended the workers, said she
admires their attitude.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been humbling to see them remain so positive through all the
struggles they've been through," she said. "They see good things in
everybody and everything."</TE>
<TE>   Chaisuni had only completed the fifth grade in Thailand, but her
desire to study could not be suppressed.</TE>
<TE>   Within 30 months of leaving El Monte, she had passed a high school
equivalency test, sewing by day and going to school by night. She
enrolled in a nursing program at a school in Koreatown and passed the
state test for licensed vocational nurses two years ago after a
fourth try, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Between her nursing job and a Christian ministry -- she conducts a
weekly Bible study in her apartment -- Chaisuni can't remember the
last time she had time to socialize with her friends from El Monte.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so busy nobody can reach me," she laughed.</TE>
<TE>   She hasn't visited her family in Thailand yet, but faithfully
sends money home.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, she married a computer technician, a fellow congregant
at Lake Avenue Church's Thai outreach ministry in Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   Even for those who haven't been able to get out of the garment
industry, life has improved immeasurably, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Buppha Chaemchoi, Rongsakare's roommate who works at the same
South Los Angeles factory, said they make it a point on Sundays to
relax, and on occasion visit a Thai temple in Hollywood or take in a
movie. They've even managed to visit Las Vegas, they said.</TE>
<TE>   They feel fortunate to work for an employer who understands what
it's like to be on the other side.</TE>
<TE>   "The owner makes rice for us," Rongsakare said.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 17, they turned the factory into a dance hall and
celebrated the seventh anniversary of their freedom from El Monte.</TE>
<TE>   About 50 former workers, including Latina colleagues, came -- some
accompanied by their spouses and children.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like a family reunion," said attorney Su, who was there
with her husband and a daughter.</TE>
<TE>   They dined and danced to karaoke music in Thai and Spanish until
late into the night, Su said.</TE>

<HD>A Pay Cut and a Homecoming to Santa Paula</HD>
<DH>New City Manager Wally Bobkiewicz left a good job up north
to return to his roots and to what he sees as a land of opportunity.</DH>

<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Before accepting a three-year contract to become Santa Paula's new
city manager, Wally Bobkiewicz said he did a little soul-searching.
Not only would he be leaving a job he really enjoyed, but there was
also the issue of taking a $22,000 cut in salary.</LD>
<LD>   Nevertheless, "It didn't take me long to decide that the
opportunity in Santa Paula was tremendous," said Bobkiewicz, who left
his four-year position as assistant city manager in Novato, Marin
County's northernmost city. "Like Marin County, Ventura County and
Santa Paula value the quality of life and cherish the environment.</LD>
<LD>   "I looked around the city and said, 'Look at all the potential.'
That's what sold me."</LD>
<TE>   Taking the $105,000-a-year job also represented a homecoming of
sorts for the 36-year-old administrator. Although born in Chicago,
Bobkiewicz's roots are firmly entrenched in Camarillo, where he spent
his youth. His parents still live there, and his sister resides in
Simi Valley with her husband and daughter.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea of living close to my family again was certainly a
consideration in accepting the job," said Bobkiewicz, who is living
with his parents while waiting for escrow to close on a home near
Santa Paula Memorial Hospital. "I like the idea of having Sunday
dinners together."</TE>
<TE>   Santa Paula Mayor Ray Luna said Bobkiewicz's county connection
worked in his favor when the City Council was interviewing candidates
for the post vacated last November by Peter Cosentini, who resigned
after nearly four years to take a job in Half Moon Bay. Santa Paula
Fire Chief Paul Skeels served as interim city manager until
Bobkiewicz took the reins Oct. 7.</TE>
<TE>   A number of things set Bobkiewicz apart from the other 20 job
applicants, Luna said.</TE>
<TE>   "Besides being highly qualified, he came on very strong with his
knowledge of local issues," Luna said. "He had been subscribing to
the local paper and followed city happenings online. Wally is also
very enthusiastic, very caring and is a great listener."</TE>
<TE>   Another point in his favor, said Vice Mayor Laura Flores Espinosa,
was Bobkiewicz's efforts to revitalize Novato's downtown and his
overhaul of the former Hamilton Army Airfield, which had closed in
1975. Under Bobkiewicz's guidance, affordable housing was
constructed, wetlands were restored and hangars were converted into
office space.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a consensus-builder, and his track record in economic
development made him the strongest choice," Espinosa said. "These are
two issues that are very important to Santa Paula right now."</TE>
<TE>   The city has been working toward a complete revitalization of its
downtown area for a number of years. Most recently it embarked on the
railway plaza project, which closed a portion of Mill Street and will
result in the addition of a public park.</TE>
<TE>   "The community wants the downtown to be vibrant, and there's a lot
of frustration over plans that haven't been implemented yet," said
Bobkiewicz, who earned a bachelor's degree from USC and a master's
from Syracuse University, both in public administration. "My job is
to take a leadership role in the community and move those plans
forward."</TE>
<TE>   He said the first step in accomplishing that goal is to meet with
members of the community, his staff and others involved with city
government.</TE>
<TE>   "The citizens of Santa Paula pay the bills, so customer service is
a top priority with me -- I want this to be a model city," said
Bobkiewicz.</TE>
<TE>   He would not say whether he favored development in Adams Canyon,
but said he isn't against development in general.</TE>
<TE>   "We have one of the most picturesque downtowns, with real historic
buildings, but there are a lot of empty storefronts, so there is a
lot of opportunity there," he said. "We need to build on the strength
of our business community."</TE>
<TE>   He views one of his biggest challenges as keeping Santa Paulans
from traveling elsewhere for dining and shopping.</TE>
<TE>   "I want the people of Santa Paula to shop and dine here,"
Bobkiewicz said. "Ventura County is a wonderful place, but not enough
people understand what a jewel Santa Paula is. Clearly, resources are
an issue, but I'm a firm believer that money should never stop you
from accomplishing your goals."</TE>
<TE>   He said he knew it would be a challenge to come from a larger city
with a budget three times the size of Santa Paula's, but council
members believe he's up to the task.</TE>
<TE>   "With him as city manager, we can create a 'we can do' attitude,"
Luna said. "I know he seems too good to be true, like a classic car
that looks so good you start looking for flaws. It's the same with
Wally -- I keep looking for a flaw or a weakness, but I haven't found
any yet."</TE>
<TE>   Added City Councilman Rick Cook, "He's got his work cut out for
him, but we plan on him being here for a long time."</TE>

<HD>Corporate Reform Has a New Ally</HD>
<DH>Fearing free-market backlash, business elites and GOP
conservatives champion an overhaul.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter G. Gosselin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>For almost a year now, the Bush administration has resisted becoming
deeply involved in tackling the corporate fraud and gimmickry that
have shaken the nation's financial markets and have demolished a
series of prominent companies.</LD>
<LD>   And with the GOP sweep of this month's congressional elections,
President Bush has been politically freed of the need to take
decisive new steps -- even as his Securities and Exchange Commission
has been set adrift by the departure of its embattled chairman and a
new accounting oversight board has been left similarly rudderless by
the exit of his choice to head that panel.</LD>
<LD>   But far from falling by the wayside, the cause of reform has been
embraced by a powerful coalition of conservative Republicans and
elite business leaders who fear that failure to follow through on a
promised overhaul of the nation's corporate sector could cause a
damaging backlash against the free-market system.</LD>
<TE>   "The cost of doing nothing is further erosion of investor
confidence," warned Sen. Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.), who vowed no
letup in reform as the president's party assumes control of the
Senate and Shelby takes the chairmanship of the Senate Banking
Committee. "We cannot go down that road anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials need to "keep challenging the [stock]
exchanges and corporate America to deliver on their promises of
transparency and integrity" or risk letting the reform drive falter,
said Larry W. Sonsini, chairman of the high-tech law firm of Wilson
Sonsini Goodrich &amp; Rosati in Palo Alto and a key member of the New
York Stock Exchange panel that produced some of the year's toughest
overhaul proposals.</TE>
<TE>   However, he added, "there is not any independent pressure coming
out of Washington anymore."</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, the administration has played a pivotal role at key
moments in the debate to date. White House officials have encouraged
federal prosecutors to seek indictments against top executives of the
most troubled companies. The president has advanced overhaul
proposals at several points during the year.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, administration officials have said they are
moving expeditiously to fill the vacancies at the top of the SEC and
its newly formed Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and they
have gone out of their way to tout the SEC's tough-minded approach to
the scandals, saying the agency has brought more enforcement actions
and forced the disgorgement of more funds than their predecessors in
the Clinton administration.</TE>
<TE>   But they have not detailed their plans, and Bush generally has
preferred to follow, rather than lead, on the issue. He waited more
than two months after Enron Corp.'s December collapse had destroyed
the jobs and savings of thousands -- many in the president's home
state of Texas -- before offering his first worker protection
measures. He pointedly refused to endorse the only major legislation
to emerge from the year's debacles, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, until
WorldCom Inc. declared the biggest-ever bankruptcy in late July.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'Bad Apple' Theory</TE>
<TE>   Motivated in part by his focus on war and terror, and in part by
his ideological objection to expanding Washington's power over
business, the president has hewed to the "bad apple" theory of the
scandals -- that a few rogue executives, accountants and analysts are
spoiling the corporate "barrel" and that little else is needed
besides removing and punishing them.</TE>
<TE>   But that is precisely the view that key reform figures now
dispute. "There are definitely some bad apples, but it's very hard to
sustain the belief that it's just bad apples," said Kim B. Clark,
dean of the Harvard Business School, which is widely viewed as a sort
of conscience of the nation's business elite. "We have some serious
problems with the barrel as well."</TE>
<TE>   In a recent letter to alumni, Clark warned that "mounting evidence
indicates the possibility of systemic flaws in our processes of
[corporate] governance and compensation as well as our accounting
standards." As a result of the flaws, he said, "the faith of people
around the world in the economic system that forms a crucial element
of our society has been damaged."</TE>
<TE>   Clark has called a series of five meetings between top executives
and senior faculty, two of which have already occurred, to hammer out
a comprehensive reform agenda. At its heart, according to takeover
defense lawyer Martin Lipton, is a call for "a tectonic shift in
power away from the imperial CEO and to outside directors" of
corporations.</TE>
<TE>   The reform advocates say that key ingredients for a thorough
overhaul already have been put in place.</TE>
<TE>   In June, for example, the New York Stock Exchange adopted
stringent new requirements for companies that want their shares
traded on the Big Board. These include having boards of directors on
which the independent directors -- people with no material ties to
the firm -- are in the majority. They also include having the boards'
audit, executive compensation and nominating committees dominated by
independents.</TE>
<TE>   A month later -- amid a new round of corporate scandals and a
steep new dive in stock prices -- Congress and the president settled
on the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation, which, among other things, sets up
a panel to regulate accountants.</TE>
<TE>   What the advocates fear is that -- with the stock market seemingly
stabilized and the Republicans victorious at the polls -- the
pressure to complete the reforms will vanish. If it does, they warn,
the result will be the loss of a rare chance to improve the
independence of corporate boards, the accuracy of corporate accounts
and the fairness of capital markets.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like anything in the political world. When a crisis strikes,
you respond. Afterward, you move on and forget what the crisis was
all about," said Leon E. Panetta, a former White House chief of staff
and co-chairman of the panel that drafted the NYSE reforms.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates say that early postelection signs have not been
promising:</TE>
<TE>   * In the two weeks since the Nov. 5 vote, both SEC Chairman Harvey
L. Pitt and chief accountant Robert Herdman resigned after
acknowledging they had withheld information about questionable
business dealings by William H. Webster, the White House's choice to
head the accounting oversight board. Webster also resigned. An
administration effort to quickly replace Pitt with Assistant Atty.
Gen. Michael Chertoff fell apart when Chertoff apparently decided he
did not want to leave his current job.</TE>
<TE>   The resignations have come at a particularly bad time for the SEC.
The agency must decide whether to approve the new NYSE rules for the
2,700 companies on that exchange, and whether to extend some or all
of the rules to the 12,000 other firms whose shares are publicly
traded. As important, it must organize the new accounting board, a
$50-million-plus operation that, by law, must be up and running by
April.</TE>
<TE>   * In signing the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in July, Bush agreed that the
SEC needs more money to do its job. But White House officials and
congressional Republicans blocked efforts last week to add money to a
temporary spending measure approved by Congress. SEC officials said
the agency can manage by drawing on special funds. But even with
these funds, its budget will be only two-thirds the size contemplated
by the new corporate reform act.</TE>
<TE>   "They've flat-lined the budget," complained Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes
(D-Md.), who co-wrote the new law and must now relinquish the
chairmanship of the banking panel to Shelby. "The SEC is limping
along with the resources to do its job."</TE>
<TE>   * Besides seeking to make corporate boards more independent and
corporate accounts more accurate, the other major element of the
reform agenda has been trying to rid the stock market of conflicts of
interest and self-dealing. And here too, there have been setbacks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brokering a Deal</TE>
<TE>   All year, the overlapping issues of research analysts tilting
their assessment of companies to sell shares and investment bankers
distributing hot stocks to favored clients have been handled not by
the administration or the SEC, but by New York state Atty. Gen. Eliot
Spitzer. Now, the big investment banks and brokerage houses are ready
to settle, but the administration and the SEC are unprepared to talk.
So Spitzer is leading the negotiations in closed-door sessions in New
York.</TE>
<TE>   Asked Sunday whether Washington shouldn't be handling the
bargaining, Spitzer, a Democrat, asserted that he would have
preferred it that way but that "the Bush administration failed to
step into this void."</TE>
<TE>   "I told them way back," Spitzer said on ABC News' "This Week,"
"you have to play the role of Teddy Roosevelt, that great Republican
who understood that when the market rules were not working properly,
[you] fixed them.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead, they're playing the role of Herbert Hoover," Spitzer
charged. "They're failing to seize the moment."</TE>
<TE>   Despite such setbacks, advocates predict that they will ultimately
be able to salvage the reform agenda for a simple reason: Without the
changes, the stock market and the economy won't rebound smartly.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, the American public has difficulty distinguishing
between Enron and Exxon," said NYSE Chairman Richard Grasso. "There
are thousands of companies who do it right every day and are being
tainted by the confusion with the few who don't." Investors have to
be able to tell the difference or they will continue to demand a
"trust discount" that will keep the markets from recovering, Grasso
said.</TE>
<TE>   "At the moment, there's been such an erosion of confidence in the
system that it puts a cloud on the economy," Shelby said. "We cannot
afford that."</TE>

<HD>Airport Security Arrives on Time</HD>
<DH>Federal screeners will be at all commercial facilities
today, a day ahead of schedule. Some lawmakers say the new agency is
overstaffed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The government's hurried, $6-billion overhaul of airport security
will meet a major goal today as white-shirted federal screeners take
over the job of checking passengers around the country.</LD>
<LD>   As recently as the summer, many doubted that the new
Transportation Security Administration could hire, train and deploy
more than 30,000 passenger screeners by a Tuesday deadline set by
Congress in response to last year's terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The TSA will meet that goal a day early, a spokeswoman said. The
turnaround, while welcome, is winning mostly guarded praise and an
incomplete grade. By the end of the year, the TSA must meet the
bigger challenge of screening all checked luggage with explosives
detection technology. Furthermore, there is still no system for
screening airline cargo, a glaring loophole.</LD>
<TE>   "The passenger screening system that we had before was unreliable
at best, and today our cargo screening system is certainly not in any
kind of shape," said Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, (R-Texas), new
chairwoman of the aviation subcommittee.</TE>
<TE>   With reports that Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden is at large and
still a threat, and with many security improvements yet to be
completed, some government officials don't want to overplay
accomplishments.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a positive, but wait-and-see attitude about TSA," said
Gerald Dillingham, director of aviation issues for the General
Accounting Office, the watchdog agency of Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Before the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the
Pentagon, passenger screening was a dead-end job. Screeners were
minimum-wage employees of private security companies, under contract
to the airlines. They typically stayed just a few months before
seeking better-paying work. There was little incentive to sharpen
skills or develop a commitment to the job.</TE>
<TE>   The federal screeners are better trained and earn $23,600 to
$35,400 a year, plus benefits. They are part of a law enforcement
organization that already spans the country. They have a career path
available that can lead to more senior jobs in the TSA or in
government.</TE>
<TE>   Frequent fliers say the early line on TSA screeners is that they
are polite, thorough -- and numerous. Travelers report airport
checkpoints swarming with white shirts.</TE>
<TE>   Todd Hauptli, an airline association lobbyist, recalled an
experience last week at a TSA-staffed checkpoint in the Salt Lake
City airport. He was asked to take his shoes off so they could be
tested for explosives.</TE>
<TE>   "They yelled for a bin runner and three guys bumped into each
other trying to get to me first," Hauptli said. "The staffing levels
can most charitably be described as generous."</TE>
<TE>   Some lawmakers are concerned about overstaffing at the agency.
"There's way too many of them," said Rep. Harold Rogers (R-Ky.), a
critic of the $6.6-billion TSA budget. "They have flooded these
airports with screeners and that work force needs to slim down
immediately."</TE>
<TE>   But TSA officials say many checkpoints are being simultaneously
used for training. New screeners get 60 hours of on-the-job training,
in addition to 44 hours in the classroom. The staffing level will
eventually go down to five or six per checkpoint lane, TSA spokesman
Robert Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   Many at the TSA believe the agency's accomplishments have not
gotten due recognition.</TE>
<TE>   "We put our first passenger screeners on the line April 30 in
Baltimore," Johnson said. "You have to give us a little bit of credit
here for the magnitude of the job we undertook and the things we've
accomplished so far. We are not done, but we are doing what we said
we were going to do."</TE>
<TE>   Federal passenger screeners already have taken over at Los Angeles
International and John Wayne airports. With 1,600 screeners, LAX has
the biggest force of any airport in the country. Both airports also
are on track to meet the Dec. 31 deadline for screening checked
luggage with explosives detection technology, which will require
22,000 more TSA screeners.</TE>
<TE>   Hiring staff does not seem to be a problem, but airline and
airport officials fear there will be long lines of passengers waiting
to have their luggage screened in ticket lobbies. The crowds could
become a target for terrorists, security experts warn.</TE>
<TE>   Crowding could arise because a significant proportion of checked
luggage will have to be opened for testing. This will be particularly
true at airports using a technology called Trace detection. A sensor
checks for explosives residue on a swab that a screener has applied
to the bag or its contents.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County's John Wayne is among a minority of airports that
will rely almost exclusively on another, more automated concept. CT
(computed tomography) scanners will be built into the airport's
baggage conveyor system. Akin to those used by doctors to diagnose
tumors, the scanners let operators see into a closed bag. Bags have
to be opened only if they trigger an alarm that the operator cannot
resolve with closer inspection.</TE>
<TE>   LAX plans to use a combination of Trace and CT scanners in all its
terminals, spokesman Paul Haney said.</TE>
<TE>   Both systems have drawbacks. Current CT scanners are notoriously
prone to false alarms, and Trace testing is time-consuming and
labor-intensive. Neither is viewed as an ideal, permanent solution.</TE>
<TE>   "From the models I've seen, people are going to be out to the
curbside at some airports," said Cathal Flynn, a former Federal
Aviation Administration security chief. "Having people for extended
periods of time in the lobbies subjects them to the risk of being
bombed right there."</TE>
<TE>   The homeland security bill pending in Congress would allow the TSA
to postpone the luggage deadline one year on an airport-by-airport
basis, provided that backup measures are in place. TSA director James
M. Loy has said that probably no more than 5% of the nation's 429
commercial airports will get extensions. However, they are likely to
be facilities with a high volume of passengers, such as Dallas-Fort
Worth International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   Luggage screening is far along, however, when compared with cargo.
Airlines transport mail and just about anything that can be safely
stowed in the belly of a plane, and cargo accounts for about 10% of
the cash-starved industry's revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Some precautionary measures have been taken. Mail is limited to
letters and parcels weighing less than 16 ounces. The TSA and the
airlines are working closely with shippers to improve internal
security procedures. A basic principle is that the airlines deal only
with "known shippers" that have an established track record.
Nonetheless, experts say the safeguards fall well short of the level
of screening accorded to passengers and their bags.</TE>
<TE>   "Cargo is probably the most significant gap there is," the GAO's
Dillingham said. "We screen all passengers and their carry-on bags,
but there is very little screening of cargo."</TE>
<TE>   The government also has yet to mandate the use of bomb-resistant
cargo and luggage containers that can go in the belly of an aircraft.
The FAA has tested and approved containers built by two U.S.
companies, but the airlines are unlikely to buy them without a
government requirement and funding. Overseas, Israel's El Al Airlines
uses bomb-resistant containers.</TE>
<TE>   Hutchison has tried to move legislation in the Senate to improve
cargo security, but final passage will have to wait until the new
Congress next year. "Cargo legislation will be our highest priority,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Other elements of the security system that still are under
development include a computerized profiling system for passengers, a
trusted traveler program for those who agree to background checks,
and the training of pilots to carry firearms for cockpit defense.</TE>
<TE>   Former FAA security chief Flynn says security spending may reach
$10 billion a year by the time all is said and done.</TE>
<TE>   Like many members of Congress, Rep. Peter A. DeFazio (D-Ore.), a
senior member of the House Transportation Committee, is constantly
jetting around the country. He analyzes airport security from the
vantage point of one who is privy to classified information about its
strengths and weaknesses.</TE>
<TE>   "I am very impressed with the consistency and the thoroughness of
the TSA screeners," he said. "The are doing a much better job than
the lackadaisical screeners of the past. [But] we've probably done
about 40% of what we need to do. On the other 60%, we're not as
vulnerable, but it's spotty."</TE>

<DL>MANY GLACIER, Mont.</DL>
<LD>When naturalists first hiked through Glacier National Park more than
a century ago, 150 glaciers graced its high cliffs and jagged peaks.
Today there are 35. The cold slivers that remain are disintegrating
so fast that scientists estimate the park will have no glaciers in 30
years.</LD>
<LD>   Boulder Glacier, once massive enough to contain a human-dwarfing
ice cave, was gone by 1998. Grinnell Glacier, beloved by tourists and
scientists alike, has lost 90% of its volume since 1850.</LD>
<LD>   The dwindling glaciers amid the deeply chiseled landscape of this
national park offer the clearest and most visible sign of climate
change in America. It is an omen even a child can grasp in an
instant: Ice that has lasted in these high alpine valleys since the
end of the Stone Age will soon vanish.</LD>
<TE>   "It's not just going to happen in my lifetime," said Dan Fagre, a
49-year-old ecologist who leads the U.S. Geological Survey team
working to chronicle climate change in this park known as the Crown
of the Continent. "It's going to happen during my career."</TE>
<TE>   The unexpected speed of the demise of the glaciers has left
scientists racing against time. They have only decades left --
nothing at all in geological time -- to understand these ancient
frozen beasts before they disappear. "The scariest thing to me is
realizing how fast these things are happening," said Blase Reardon,
39, an avalanche expert who has worked in the park for the last two
years. "Being here is like having a front row seat at the
Indianapolis 500."</TE>
<TE>   The melting here is being mimicked around the world, from the
snows of Mt. Kilimanjaro in Tanzania to the ice fields beneath Mt.
Everest in the Himalayas. Experts predict that glaciers in the high
Andes, the Swiss Alps and even Iceland could disappear in coming
decades as well.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to these more remote, high-altitude areas, the
accessibility of Glacier National Park gives scientists a chance to
get the most intimate view possible of a dying glacier.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1991, a team of scientists has measured the most ephemeral
details of the glaciers. They have analyzed the cycles of
precipitation and temperature that merge into the cold calculus of
every glacier. They have dragged ground-penetrating radar over
crevasses and risked skiing into avalanches to measure snowfall. They
have analyzed soil carbon and counted frog eggs to document the
unique ecology of glaciers and their meltwater streams.</TE>
<TE>   But for all the gigabytes of data the team has accumulated, they
realize they have only scratched the surface. The transformation of
the park has turned out to be far more complex than anyone imagined.
For example, even as most glaciers here race toward extinction, a
handful seem to effortlessly maintain their grip on mountain peaks.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes you question what you know," said Fagre, "which is the
real point of science."</TE>
<TE>   While the team has spent much of its tenure here talking about
stream flow data, snowfall records and vegetation dynamics, they have
started talking about something new: the loss of beauty. These
scientists know they are recording the last vestiges of a world that
may soon exist only in their computers, photographs and memories -- a
world their grandchildren may never see.</TE>
<TE>   "When the permanent parts of the landscape start disappearing,
that's unsettling," said Fagre, who has lived and worked in the park
for more than a decade. "It's still a beautiful mountain, but without
glaciers, an identity is lost."</TE>
<TE>   To glaciologists who thrill to see the groaning dynamics of ice in
real time, there still is beauty in the rocky new landscapes.
Glaciers often drip away into milky lakes of "unusual, gorgeous,
turquoise, practically indescribable color," said Jeffrey Kargel, a
USGS scientist who monitors many of the world's wasting glaciers from
space. The color is a product of light reflecting off "glacial
flour," or ground-up rock that floats in meltwater.</TE>
<TE>   The terrain left behind by a retreating glacier is like land
recovering from fire, Kargel said. It may look devastated, scarred
and littered with boulders. But soon, lichens, grasses and
wildflowers grow. Those who stand at the edge of retreating glaciers
are likely standing where no human has stood before. "It's not all
doom and gloom," Kargel said.</TE>
<TE>   Most casual visitors to these mountains have little idea that most
glaciers in the Lower 48 are on the way out. The handful of
"itty-bitty" glaciers in the Sierra Nevada "are glaciers only by the
most technical sense of the term," Kargel said. Most glaciers that
remain there are rock glaciers -- flowing fields of rock interspersed
with ice that don't look glacial at all. Alaska's glaciers are in
dramatic retreat as well.</TE>
<TE>   Some of this epochal change can be hard to detect, particularly
for those who have spent much of their lives in the park.</TE>
<TE>   The son of a seasonal ranger, Steve Frye spent his boyhood summers
exploring the park's forests and peaks. In 1970, on his first park
job, he sat in the Swiftcurrent lookout tower watching for fires out
across the Continental Divide. His view included several glaciers,
including Grinnell, the park's most famous.</TE>
<TE>   At 54, Frye is the park's chief ranger and one of 16 Type I
incident commanders charged with fighting the country's most complex
forest fires. This summer, in between stints at devastating fires
near Denver and in Oregon, Frye found time to make a nostalgic trip
back to the lookout he staffed 32 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The changes in Grinnell didn't stand out, especially because other
aspects of the timeless landscape looked so much the same. But when
he saw a series of before-and-after photos showing how much Grinnell
had changed since 1850, his response was different. "I wasn't
shocked," he recalled, "but I was overwhelmed."</TE>
<TE>   The pictures will do that.</TE>
<TE>   In most areas with vanishing glaciers, there are few historical
records documenting how the ice has responded to the warming of the
planet during the last century -- or even the last decade. Here, an
archive of 12,000 photos offers an unparalleled window into the last
century.</TE>
<TE>   The creation of this park, the nation's 10th, neatly coincides
with the rise of photography. Boxes of photos of the park date back
to the 19th century.</TE>
<TE>   They are of use to scientists only if they can be compared with
modern photographs taken from the same locations. So Fagre's team has
retaken many of the aging photographs. It is exacting work that
requires scouring topographic maps and hiking the backcountry for
days to reach the same viewpoints early park photographers used.</TE>
<TE>   "You get a little closer, you get a little further. You try to
line up the mountain ridges," said Karen Holzer, a 35-year-old USGS
scientist who has hiked, skied and kayaked around these glaciers for
five years to help shoot this new generation of glacier images. "We
get excited when we find a big rock that was up there 30 or 60 years
ago."</TE>
<TE>   Of 17 glaciers that have been rephotographed, Holzer said, four
small ones in the park's shadiest, north-facing recesses have not
changed at all. Twelve have shrunk considerably. And one, Boulder,
disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   A set of photos of Grinnell Glacier through time now hangs in the
park's Apgar visitor center. The images startle visitors who think of
climate change only as some distant, far-off threat, Frye said.</TE>
<TE>   The vanishing glaciers were among the first topics to come up
after Mick Holm took over as superintendent this summer. People
"wanted to know what I was going to do about stopping the glaciers,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Holm could offer no consolation. While dismissing suggestions that
Glacier National Park will need a new name once the glaciers go, he
admits the questions raise some disconcerting issues.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if people have taken the time to really think of
Glacier National Park without glaciers," the eastern Montana native
said. "We've always expected them to be here."</TE>
<TE>   Though the glaciers have existed through human history, they were
not always here. Today's mountain glaciers are about 7,000 years old
and grew to their largest extent during the Little Ice Age, a period
from 1450 to 1890 when temperatures were a few degrees colder than
temperatures in the 1900s.</TE>
<TE>   Even at their largest, today's glaciers were dwarfed by the
5,000-foot high rivers of ice that filled the park's valleys about
20,000 years ago at the end of the last great Ice Age. In that Ice
Age, the Earth was chilled by a combination of small changes in its
orbit and cyclic changes in levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide that
are still not fully understood.</TE>
<TE>   Glaciers take decades to respond to warming. Scientists say the
melting of the glaciers seen today is largely because of leftover
warming from the end of the Little Ice Age and global warming, the
recent heating of our planet by 1 degree. Most scientists agree the
recent warming is mainly a product of industrial activity.</TE>
<TE>   The loss of ice worldwide is a crisis on many levels. Glaciers are
natural water towers, providing steady flows of late-summer water to
the drier farms and valleys far below. These streams are the
lifeblood of mountain ecosystems. When warming is rapid, gushing
meltwater can quickly dam into large lakes and burst in flash floods.
Collapsing glaciers can crush small hamlets. In September, dozens of
people died when a Russian village in the Caucasus Mountains was
buried in ice.</TE>
<TE>   The park is safe from such disasters. The relatively small
glaciers here have no human settlements beneath them. In this
wildlife-rich ecosystem, the ice may not even be the most important
change rippling through the park, only the most visible.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the Piegan Glacier is one of the few in the park that
has not shrunk in recent decades. But a photo comparison shows the
landscape around the glacier is radically different.</TE>
<TE>   A high alpine meadow that once stood beneath the ice is now filled
with sub-alpine fir trees, which have been able to migrate to higher
elevations because of the slightly increased temperatures. Such
vegetation changes, along with the drier landscape expected to
accompany the warming, dramatically alter the potential frequency and
severity of forest fires.</TE>
<TE>   Fagre said recent climate change has begun to alter stream flow
and temperature, vegetation dynamics and soil content. Those small
and unglamorous details reveal patterns of change and adaptation that
will eventually play out in lower elevations where humans live and
could cause large scale changes in animal reproduction, forestry and
agriculture.</TE>
<TE>   For example, changes in soil chemistry and temperature already are
leading to changes in plant cover. Scientists expect the park's
cedar-hemlock forests will expand in the future and that the
distribution of one grizzly bear favorite -- huckleberry patches --
could change as well. Dwarf trees that cling to life at the tree line
are sending up tall, strong leaders for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   Changes to stream flow and temperature could alter the
reproduction of the damsel and caddis flies that provide food for the
fat Montana trout so coveted by fly fishermen.</TE>
<TE>   But even as the details reveal more about the ecosystem, they
frustrate Fagre's ability to understand the glaciers.</TE>
<TE>   For the first years of the study, the phenomena seemed a simple
matter of rising temperatures melting the ice. But closer analysis of
temperature data from nearby Kalispell didn't fit that picture.
Annual temperatures there have not warmed significantly in the last
century -- the time when glaciers have retreated most.</TE>
<TE>   Fagre's team recently started looking at the other half of the
glacial equation -- precipitation. They paid close attention to a
decades-long cycle called the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, an El
Nino-like Pacific Ocean pattern that can dramatically alter snowfall
patterns in the Pacific Northwest and the northern Rocky Mountains.</TE>
<TE>   Analysis showed that for much of the last century, the pattern has
been locked in a phase where there has been significantly less snow.
The lack of snow helped explain, in part, why the glaciers retreated.</TE>
<TE>   But the glaciers retreated even during periods with heavier
precipitation, said Fagre, indicating that warmer global temperatures
are likely to play a role in the loss of ice as well. The link
between ice loss and global warming caused by humans is not as strong
as in glaciers elsewhere, he said, but it still exists.</TE>
<TE>   "We're doing the same thing. We're just not in lock step with the
global trends," Fagre said. "That sloppiness is to be expected in a
complex system like our planet."</TE>
<TE>   It is a world of unexplained contradiction and complexity that
keeps Fagre going.</TE>
<TE>   He has routinely worked 60 hours a week since the project began
and has no plans to slow down -- the glaciers are disappearing too
fast to let him.</TE>
<TE>   As long as they last, he will keep teasing secrets from them,
measuring their size and monitoring the lakes of milky aquamarine
meltwater pooling beneath them. He will monitor the firs, track bull
trout populations and use powerful computers to model new forest fire
cycles.</TE>
<TE>   There is some comfort in the long columns of data he can generate,
some satisfaction in knowing the careful work could one day help
reduce ecological damage from retreating glaciers around the world.</TE>
<TE>   But as he hikes through the mountains, Fagre, the son of a
theologian, cannot shake his sense of loss.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm an ecologist who knows climate change is neither good nor
bad," he said as he hiked across a ridge overlooking a set of classic
U-shaped glacial valleys amid 10,000 foot peaks.</TE>
<TE>   "But I'm also a person who likes glaciers the way they are."</TE>

<TE>   `Vanishing Ice'</TE>
<TE>   "Vanishing Ice" is an occasional series investigating the effect
of global climate change on the Arctic and high mountain regions,
fringes of the Earth that have experienced the most dramatic warming
in recent decades.</TE>
<TE>   Previously, the series described how higher temperatures near the
Bering Sea are destroying an ancient way of life for Siberian
Eskimos. In coming weeks, the series will look at the increasing pace
of change to the economies, ecologies and cultures of the far north.

<LD>Dodger reliever Eric Gagne is such a hero in his hometown of Montreal
that one of the city's French newspapers, La Presse, put the news of
his wedding at a local church on its front page earlier this month.</LD>
<LD>   Not the front page of the sports section -- the front page of the
newspaper, with a sizable photograph of a formally dressed Gagne and
his wife, Valerie, in her white gown and veil.</LD>
<LD>   According to La Presse, Gagne told his wife, "Valerie, I pledge
you my heart and my arm," which it said was only fitting "for a

<TE>   Trivia time: Who was the quarterback of Penn State's national
championship team in 1986?</TE>
<TE>   Field of screams: Washington Post columnist Tony Kornheiser has
some words for those who are trying to turn football fields and
baseball diamonds into a participation sport.</TE>
<TE>   "This 'storming the field' nonsense is becoming a plague," he
wrote. "Almost every day somebody or some horde of somebodies are out
there running around, essentially daring the players to pop them.
It's rude and provocative behavior; it's the 'Jackassing' of America.</TE>
<TE>   " ... But the stadium field isn't a place where folks congregate
and schmooze. It's not a jogging trail, or a mall or a disco. While a
game is going on [and immediately after] it's private property. It
belongs to the players, coaches and officials. You enter at your own
risk."</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Mom: A new child? So what?</TE>
<TE>   Kentucky quarterback Jared Lorenzen, who is listed at 275 pounds
but reportedly is 300 pounds, hasn't passed up too many meals. He has
fit his newborn baby right into his daily -- and nightly -- schedule.</TE>
<TE>   "Getting up in the middle of the night for feedings at 1, 3, 5 in
the morning -- kind of like I do for myself," he said, joking.</TE>
<TE>   Matinee men: Tampa Bay Coach Jon Gruden is educating, and
motivating, his players through film footage of old.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been a connoisseur over the years of football and
nostalgia," Gruden told Katherine Smith of the Tampa Tribune. "When
you talk about great defenses, let's watch L.T. take on the isolation
and watch him rush a passer."</TE>
<TE>   Twenty years ago might as well be 100 years for some of his

<TE>   Said tight end Ken Dilger: "[Gruden] will bring out tape from as
far back as the mid-'80s. It's really grainy looking and you're
wondering what the heck is this?"</TE>

guaranteeing a win, just as he did before Cincinnati (1-9) beat the
Houston Texans. This time, his boldness backfired.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him there's nothing wrong with that, but some comments
you've got to keep to yourself," said Cleveland linebacker Earl
Holmes, who sought Johnson out on the field. "You can't guarantee a
victory. It came back to smack him in the face."</TE>
<TE>   Said Johnson: "I'll do it again. I'm not going to say when, but
I'll do it again. I'm not going to say we had it today, but we
competed. We had every chance to win."</TE>
<TE>   The Browns (5-5) stayed in playoff contention by stopping Dillon
from point-blank range.</TE>
<TE>   Brandon Bennett returned a kickoff to the seven-yard line with the
Browns leading, 27-20.</TE>
<TE>   Dillon ran the ball twice to get to the one, then was tripped up
by Holmes as he went off right tackle. On fourth and goal from a foot
away, the Bengals sent Dillon to the right once again behind tackle
Willie Anderson.</TE>
<TE>   Darren Hambrick hit Dillon first, and Holmes shoved him back for
no gain with 5:51 left. It was the same spot on the field where
Dillon tripped and came up inches short in a 30-24 loss to Tennessee
on Oct. 27.</TE>
<TE>   "We ran our best back behind our best blocker and didn't make it,"
Coach Dick LeBeau said.</TE>
<TE>   The Bengals got the ball again at their 11 with 1:41 to go and no
timeouts. They drove to the Brown 24, where Peter Warrick was tackled
after a catch, but the clock ran out before the Bengals could line up
for a throw into the end zone.</TE>

<KH>TAMPA BAY 23, CAROLINA 10</KH>
<HD>Buccaneer Defense Gets Wake-up Call</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TAMPA, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Warren Sapp and the rest of the Tampa Bay Buccaneer defense gathered
on the sideline and had a discussion about the Carolina Panthers.</LD>
<LD>   "They drove right down the field on us, and we kind of looked at
each other like, 'What's up? No more, no more," ' Sapp said after the
Buccaneers rebounded from the Panthers scoring on their first
possession for a 23-10 victory that gave them sole possession of
first place in the NFC South.</LD>
<LD>   "This is the same team we played three weeks ago, and they ain't
got nothing but a new quarterback in there with a little bit more
pocket savvy, so let's go get 'em. And we went to work."</LD>
<TE>   After Rodney Peete led the Panthers on a 12-play, 68-yard
touchdown drive, the NFL's top-ranked defense forced four turnovers
and allowed only 161 more yards.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay (8-2) is off to its best start after 10 games. With New
Orleans losing, 24-17, at Atlanta, the Buccaneers are alone atop the
division heading into games the next three weeks against NFC North
leader Green Bay, New Orleans and surging Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   "We've just got to keep pushing right now, because we've put
ourselves into a position to win this division," Sapp said. "Now
we've got to go do it."</TE>
<TE>   Carolina (3-7) has blown fourth-quarter leads five times during a
seven-game losing streak, but Tampa Bay took care of this one before
it got that far.</TE>
<TE>   Brad Johnson threw a one-yard touchdown pass to Keyshawn Johnson
in the second quarter, then broke a 10-10 tie with a 22-yard scoring
pass to Keenan McCardell late in the third quarter. Martin Gramatica
added field goals of 20, 32 and 41 yards.</TE>
<TE>   The Buccaneers had defeated the Panthers, 12-9, without scoring a
touchdown last month. Neither team's starting quarterback played that
day, with Peete recovering from arthroscopic knee surgery and Johnson
sidelined because of a broken rib.</TE>

<HD>Charger Victory Taken to Heart</HD>
<DH>They come back from 10-point deficit in fourth quarter and
beat 49ers in overtime, 20-17.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>On a 40-yard field goal by Steve Christie, the San Diego Chargers
beat the San Francisco 49ers, 20-17, in overtime Sunday, a
come-from-behind victory before 67,161 at Qualcomm Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Winning for the first time in three games, the Chargers are 7-3
and tied with the Denver Broncos for first place in the AFC West.</LD>
<LD>   The 49ers (7-3), who had won three in a row, remain in first place
in the NFC West.</LD>
<TE>   "If ever there was a question about this team's heart, it can be
dispelled," said Charger Coach Marty Schottenheimer.</TE>
<TE>   Charger running back LaDainian Tomlinson had caused a stir last
week by questioning his teammates' perseverance after a loss to the
St. Louis Rams. After beating the 49ers, he agreed with his coach
that such observations are now passe.</TE>
<TE>   "We're back," said Tomlinson. "Determination and heart is what
this team had."</TE>
<TE>   With 88 yards in 24 carries, Tomlinson became the first Charger in
team history to gain 1,000 yards in each of his first two seasons. He
also caught eight passes for 57 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Trailing, 17-7, after three quarters, the Chargers got a 36-yard
field goal from Christie and then tied the score with 35 seconds
remaining in regulation on a one-yard pass from Drew Brees to
fullback Fred McCrary.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a roller-coaster out there," Charger linebacker Junior
Seau said.</TE>
<TE>   If Christie was the hero, 49er kicker Jose Cortez was the goat.</TE>
<TE>   On the 49ers' first possession of overtime, Cortez shanked a
41-yard attempt wide right.</TE>
<TE>   It was Cortez's fourth miss in three weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "I think his confidence is OK," 49er Coach Steve Mariucci said.
"Who knows what goes on inside one's head.... We certainly needed his
field goal today."</TE>
<TE>   Given a reprieve, Brees moved the Chargers 47 yards in eight
plays, including a 19-yard completion to wide receiver Tim Dwight and
a 18-yarder to wide receiver Eric Parker that set the stage for
Christie's game-winner.</TE>
<TE>   Christie, who had a 44-yard attempt blocked in the second quarter,
has kicked eight field goals in overtime, the second most in NFL
history, trailing only Jim Breech, who had nine.</TE>
<TE>   "The last time I was really nervous was when I kicked an overtime
field goal in my rookie year," said Christie, a 13-year NFL veteran.</TE>
<TE>   Brees was 29 for 50 for 336 yards, including touchdown passes to
McCrary and a four-yarder to wide receiver Reche Caldwell to give the
Chargers a 7-0 lead in the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Wide receiver Curtis Conway caught seven passes for 152 yards.</TE>
<TE>   The 49ers scored on a 32-yard pass play from Jeff Garcia to wide
receiver Terrell Owens in the second quarter and a 76-yard pass from
Garcia to Owens in the third. Cortez kicked a 24-yard field goal to
give the 49ers their largest lead.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia completed 25 of 43 passes for 337 yards.</TE>
<TE>   The Chargers missed two touchdown opportunities, one when Brees
was intercepted in the end zone, another when a Conway touchdown was
called back because he had stepped out of bounds before catching the
ball.</TE>

<HD>Clippers in a Funk</HD>
<DH>A 15-point lead is a frustrating thing to waste in 84-78
loss to Seattle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Grumbling fans crowding the exits well before the final buzzer
sounded said it Sunday afternoon at Staples Center. Weary looks on
the players' faces said it in the locker room. Hushed tones from the
coach said it in the interview room.</LD>
<LD>   No one actually spoke the words, but after the Clippers squandered
a 15-point third-quarter lead and dropped an 84-78 victory into the
laps of the eager and thankful Seattle SuperSonics, one thing is
crystal clear.</LD>
<LD>   The Clippers are in trouble.</LD>
<TE>   Certainly, there's a long way to go this season. Seventy-two
games, in fact, for the Clippers to get their act together and prove
themselves worthy of so much preseason hype and glory. A winning
record is still possible. So is a playoff berth.</TE>
<TE>   After 10 games, there's little reason to cheer them, however. The
Clippers have a 3-7 record, including a 1-4 mark at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of running, jumping, dunking, smiling and laughing all the
way to a victory, as they so often did last season, the Clippers are
a dour bunch of young fellows these days. Their margin for error, as
exposed by the SuperSonics in the fourth quarter Sunday, is zero.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to right the ship soon," forward Elton Brand said after
scoring 19 points and taking 16 rebounds. "It's still early, but the
Western Conference is so tough and the Pacific Division is so tough.
We can't fall behind."</TE>
<TE>   Too late.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers began the day with only the Lakers, struggling
without Shaquille O'Neal, and Golden State, tonight's opponent,
behind them in the Pacific standings. The SuperSonics lead the
Pacific with an 8-2 record.</TE>
<TE>   "For the most part, I thought we played really good basketball,"
Coach Alvin Gentry said, attempting to put the best possible spin on
the Clippers' third consecutive loss. "The last six or seven minutes,
we couldn't get the ball in the basket. We couldn't get a stop."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers built a 64-49 lead on Brand's tip-in of an Andre
Miller miss, but lost all their momentum in the final moments of the
third quarter and, soon enough, the game. Seattle went on a 23-5 run
that began when Desmond Mason made a jump shot with 51.6 seconds left
in the third quarter and ended when Mason made one of two free throws
with 3:32 remaining in the game.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers missed nine of their first 10 shots and never warmed
up down the stretch. By quarter's end, they were outscored, 30-14,
largely because they made four of 24 shots (16.7%) and five of 11
free throws (45.5%).</TE>
<TE>   Seattle's Rashard Lewis made two key baskets -- an eight-foot
runner over Brand in the paint and an eight-foot jump shot over him
along the left baseline -- to keep the SuperSonics ahead in the
closing minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The SuperSonics made 10 of 17 shots (58.8%) and seven of nine free
throws (77.8%) in the fourth quarter. Mason and Gary Payton each
scored 10 points in the final quarter to keep the SuperSonics
rolling.</TE>
<TE>   Down, 81-78, with 29.7 seconds to play, Eric Piatkowski passed up
an open three-point shot and Miller missed a hurried three-pointer
when no one else came open on the Clippers' last chance at a tie.
Predrag Drobnjak made two free throws and Mason one to account for
the final score.</TE>
<TE>   "For some reason, we're not playing with a lot of confidence down
the stretch," Gentry said. "Maybe we're feeling the pressure and the
expectations. I just have to believe we're a good enough team to win
games like this. This is not a good time to be struggling."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Olowokandi refused to believe the Clippers' struggles are
because of a lack of confidence. He believes there are other factors
at work, particularly when things get tight late in close games.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a stretch there today where we went down and took
questionable shots and made some questionable decisions," said
Olowokandi, who scored eight points on two-for-five shooting and took
13 rebounds in 38 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "Against a team like that [Seattle], you will get punished for it.
I don't know about a lack of confidence. We made some questionable
decisions. There was nothing in particular, but everyone was at
fault."</TE>

<LD>One great thing about free throws: There's nobody standing in the
shooter's way.</LD>
<LD>   So why did the Clippers miss so many free throws in their 84-78
loss Sunday against the Seattle SuperSonics?</LD>
<LD>   The Clippers couldn't say for certain after making 14 of 24 for
58.3%, two days after making 19 of 33 (57.6%) against Portland.</LD>
<TE>   They did say their poor free-throw shooting cost them a game. The
Clippers are making 72.4% of their free throws, down from 73.9% last
season.</TE>
<TE>   "What really killed us were the free throws," Corey Maggette said
after missing the only one he attempted Sunday. "It was a big
difference in the game."</TE>
<TE>   Added Elton Brand, who made five of seven from the line: "We've
got to get back in the gym and shoot some free throws."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Quentin Richardson is eligible to come off the injured list after
tonight's game against the Golden State Warriors, but Coach Alvin
Gentry couldn't say Sunday if Richardson's bruised right knee is
sound enough for him to play Wednesday against the Sacramento Kings.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll just have to wait and see," Gentry said.</TE>

<TE>   Records -- Clippers 3-7, Warriors 3-8.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Warriors (2001-02) -- 2-2.</TE>
<TE>   Update -- The Warriors were in L.A. to play the Lakers, losing in
overtime Friday, then thumped Orlando on Saturday at Oakland. The
Clippers were at Portland on Friday, losing big, then home Sunday
against Seattle and on the road again to face the Warriors tonight at
Oakland. The Warriors played seven of their first 10 games on the
road, which helps to explain their slow start. The Clippers are
playing the final game in a stretch of four in five days. They are
2-3 away from Staples Center. Last season, they didn't win their
first road game until Dec. 18, en route to a 14-27 mark away from
Staples Center.</TE>

<HD>UCLA Beats USC, 1-0</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Stephens</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Frustrated by its inability to put the ball in the net, UCLA was well
aware that USC had been remarkable in overtime this season and the
upset-minded Trojans were gaining confidence throughout the NCAA
Division I women's soccer second-round playoff game.</LD>
<LD>   USC's previous five victories had come in overtimes. Kendal
Billingsley made sure there was not a sixth, scoring in the fourth
minute of double overtime to give the Bruins a 1-0 victory Sunday at
Drake Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   The Bruins (18-3-0) advanced to a third-round game against Texas
A&amp;M at home on Saturday night. But the victory wouldn't come easily
against their Pacific 10 Conference rival. Billingsley scored her
third goal this season and her second game-winner.</LD>
<TE>   Defender Nandi Pryce got the ball outside the right post off a
corner kick and slid a pass in front. Forward Crystal James shielded
goalkeeper Julie Peterson from the ball and Billingsley chipped it in
to set off a wild celebration.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone was yelling to get in the [penalty] box," said
Billingsley, a sophomore defender. "Nandi was doing her job in
getting the ball on the right side. I just happened to be there."</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins, who are seeking their second Final Four appearance in
three years, outshot USC, 23-2, and got several quality scoring
chances.</TE>
<TE>   Peterson foiled several. In the 59th minute, UCLA was awarded a
penalty kick when forward Iris Mora was taken down in the box by
defender Nikki Goza.</TE>
<TE>   Pryce took the kick and shot to the right side of the net, but
Peterson made a kick save. In the first overtime, the sophomore
goalie got a hand on a Stacy Lindstrom header in front of the net and
the Trojans cleared the ball after a scramble.</TE>
<TE>   "She did a nice job for them," UCLA Coach Jillian Ellis said of
Peterson, who made 10 saves. "We know she's very athletic. A lot of
times, she was able to bat balls out of there. We told our forwards
to run straight at her and put her under pressure."</TE>
<TE>   USC Coach Jim Millinder said he hoped to get the game into a
shootout, particularly after watching Peterson's stop on the penalty
kick. The Trojans (11-8-3) had defeated San Diego in overtime on
Friday and were 5-0-3 this season.</TE>
<TE>   "We were six minutes away from executing what I wanted," Millinder
said. "If you try to play with UCLA straight up, you could get
hammered. I thought after Julie's stop on the penalty kick that the
soccer gods were looking down on us today."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Freshman forward Jenna Fodor scored with under a minute remaining
in the first overtime to give Pepperdine a 2-1 second-round victory
over Wisconsin at Marquette.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine (18-1-2) rallied from a 1-0 deficit 12 minutes into the
game. Lacey Ubaldi tied it, 1-1, with a shot from 12 yards in the
83rd minute.</TE>
<TE>   The Waves will play at Michigan in the third round.</TE>

<KH>INDIANAPOLIS 20, DALLAS 3</KH>
<HD>Harrison Goes the Extra Milestone</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Marvin Harrison has torn apart good defenses all season. Sunday was
no different.</LD>
<LD>   The NFL's leading receiver caught two late touchdown passes and
topped the 100-yard mark for the sixth time this season as the Colts
held off the Dallas Cowboys, 20-3.</LD>
<LD>   Harrison caught 14 passes for 138 yards, becoming the first player
in the league to top 1,000 yards receiving this season, and reaching
600 receptions faster than any player in NFL history.</LD>
<TE>   "They double-team him, they try to put guys up to him. I ought to
get a bit more credit for getting him the ball," quarterback Peyton
Manning joked. "He just makes plays."</TE>
<TE>   Harrison proved just how important he is to the Colts' offense
with his customary big game.</TE>
<TE>   Against a defense that had allowed only 35 points in its previous
three games and was coming off an open date, Harrison still had the
upper hand.</TE>
<TE>   First, he made his 600th reception, reaching that milestone in 102
games -- 16 games faster than previous record-holder Herman Moore.</TE>
<TE>   Harrison's first touchdown catch, a 31-yard play, gave the Colts
(6-4) a 13-3 lead with 4:18 to play and broke Raymond Berry's team
record for touchdowns receiving, a mark that stood since 1967.</TE>
<TE>   His second touchdown catch, a one-yard play, sealed the victory
and gave Harrison 70 for his career.</TE>
<TE>   Harrison, who doesn't like to talk about statistics or records,
left without speaking to the media. Colt Coach Tony Dungy said he has
been around only two similar receivers -- Lynn Swann and John
Stallworth, both Hall of Famers.</TE>
<TE>   "He's unbelievable," Dungy said of Harrison. "When he gets his
opportunities, he's something special."</TE>
<TE>   Dallas (3-7) struggled offensively, gaining only 178 yards. Emmitt
Smith ran for only 22 yards.</TE>

<LD>   What: "Plaschke: Good Sports, Spoilsports, Foul Balls and
Oddballs"</LD>
<TE>   Author: Bill Plaschke</TE>
<TE>   Publisher: Los Angeles Times Books</TE>
<TE>   Price: $23.95</TE>
<TE>   Sorry if today's Hot Corner fawns a little. That's because it's
about a book that is a collection of writings by a colleague, Bill
Plaschke.</TE>
<TE>   Plaschke, 44, has been a sportswriter with The Times since 1987
and a featured columnist since 1996.</TE>
<TE>   This 336-page hardcover book that contains 67 stories and columns
by Plaschke will rekindle fond memories, draw a few tears and remind
you about what's important and what's not in sports.</TE>
<TE>   If you're a Plaschke fan, possibly your favorite column was the
one that appeared Aug. 19, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   It begins on page 152 in the book. It's about Sarah Morris, a
Dodger fan living in Anderson, Texas, who critiques the team on her
Web site. Morris has cerebral palsy and has to type on the computer
with a head pointer.</TE>
<TE>   These are the kinds of people Plaschke loves to write about.</TE>
<TE>   Another he wrote about, during Super Bowl week in 2000, is Bill
Gutweiler, whose wife was killed by a drunk driver. That drunk driver
was Leonard Little, a linebacker who was a few days away from suiting
up for the St. Louis Rams and playing in the Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is the one that appeared on Thanksgiving Day, 1999.
It's about Andrew Fishbein, Plaschke's "little brother." They had met
through the Big Brothers and Sisters program in 1980, when Plaschke
was 22 and Fishbein was 7. Fishbein was coming to Plaschke's home for
Thanksgiving dinner that day.</TE>
<TE>   All profits from the book go to The Times Holiday Fund to benefit
disadvantaged children and youth in Southern California.</TE>

<KH>DUCK REPORT</KH>
<HD>Leclerc's Knee Injury Is a Rude Awakening</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>The Mighty Ducks' giddiness Sunday about a 5-1 victory over Atlanta
and their recent success was tempered by the loss of right wing Mike
Leclerc, who was sent back to Anaheim and will have his inflamed left
knee examined today by team doctors.</LD>
<LD>   Leclerc had no idea how he injured the knee, which swelled Sunday
morning. He returned to the lineup Thursday against Columbus after
having minor surgery Monday to remove part of the bursa sac in his
right elbow.</LD>
<LD>   "It would definitely hurt us to lose Mike," center Steve Rucchin
said. "He brings so much to the table. He's a guy who works hard and
at the same time is skilled. That would be a big void for us to
fill."</LD>
<TE>   His knee injury came as a surprise to Coach Mike Babcock, who did
not learn of the problem until Sunday morning.</TE>
<TE>   Right wing Alexei Smirnov is to rejoin the Ducks today in New York
after playing three games for minor league Cincinnati over the
weekend. That schedule would have changed had he known Leclerc was
hurt, Babcock said.</TE>
<TE>   "We would have had Smirnov here obviously," said Babcock, who
refused to comment any further.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defenseman Fredrik Olausson was a healthy scratch for the second
time in three games. Olausson was signed as a free agent to improve
the Duck power play, but has no goals and one assist in 15 games.</TE>
<TE>   Olausson and Babcock had a meeting Sunday, but Babcock would not
comment on what it was about.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Stanislav Chistov got the best of Atlanta's Ilya Kovalchuk
in the second period Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Chistov got away with hooking Kovalchuk, who then swung his stick
at Chistov. Kovalchuk received an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty and
the Ducks' Niclas Havelid converted that into a goal.</TE>
<TE>   "He got the penalty and we got the goal, that was a good play,
right?" Chistov said.</TE>
<TE>   Chistov and Kovalchuk have been teammates for Russia in
international competition.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After Atlanta's Jeff Odgers jumped Duck defenseman Vitaly
Vishnevski late in the game, Kevin Sawyer stepped in to help out.
Sawyer received a roughing penalty and a game misconduct. Odgers was
given an instigator penalty, a fighting major, a 10-minute misconduct
and a game misconduct.</TE>

<HD>Ducks Enforce Their Will</HD>
<DH>Even tough guy Sawyer gets into the offensive act, scoring
a rare goal as Anaheim improves to 6-1-1-2 in last 10 games with 5-1
victory in Atlanta.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>This is all you need to know about the Atlanta Thrashers: Kevin
Sawyer put three pucks in the net Sunday night, and one even counted.</LD>
<LD>   Sawyer, the Ducks' enforcer, had a rare moment in the offensive
spotlight in a 5-1 Mighty Duck victory in front of an announced crowd
of 10,932 at the Philips Center. He lost one goal on a quick whistle,
then had one taken away in the third period after he batted in the
puck with a blatantly high stick. But his second-period,
come-from-behind-the-net wrist shot counted.</LD>
<LD>   "In my mind, they all counted tonight," Sawyer said. "I'll take
that hat trick."</LD>
<TE>   Sawyer was happy to point out that he did once score a hat trick
while playing for Worcester of the American Hockey League. He was
even happier to talk about the significance of the Duck victory.</TE>
<TE>   "These kind of games you worry about," Sawyer said. "You don't
want to take anyone lightly. Good teams don't let that happen."</TE>
<TE>   And that may be all anyone needs to say about the Ducks.</TE>
<TE>   They have been a good team during their last 10 games, with a
6-1-1-2 record. They are off to the best start in franchise history
with 21 points in 19 games, which made Sunday's game against the
lowly Thrashers a key one.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta had won four of its last six, but has the second-worst
record in the Eastern Conference. The Ducks have certainly stumbled
over such teams in similar situations before.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a dangerous game for us," Patric Kjellberg said. "That's
nothing against Atlanta. But we had to have the confidence to come in
here and get the job done."</TE>
<TE>   After a slow start, the Ducks used group therapy to get out of
their funk, getting points from 11 players. Steve Rucchin and Paul
Kariya each had two assists. Kjellberg, Stanislav Chistov, Niclas
Havelid and Petr Sykora scored goals</TE>
<TE>   "In this game, you can't do it alone anymore," said Sykora, who
has seven points in the last eight games. "If you want to be
successful, you have to do it as a group."</TE>
<TE>   That included Sawyer, who has 74 penalty minutes this season, but
took a break from his normal duties.</TE>
<TE>   He jammed the puck from under Thrasher goalie Milan Hnilicka just
after the whistle blew in the first period. In the third period, he
reached high to bat the puck into the net; the goal was waved off.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, if the puck is within reach of a stick, a goal scorer will
get it," Sawyer said. "I'm kidding. Actually, I was a little
embarrassed by that. I wanted to go back to the bench and hide my
head."</TE>
<TE>   The one that counted, though, was worth the bear-hug celebration
that followed, which included Sawyer's brief jig with Kariya.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Brown, the Ducks' other tough guy, brought the puck into the
Thrasher zone and sent it behind the net. Sawyer took it, spun and
came from behind the net. He waited, then fired a wrist shot off
Hnilicka's glove into the net.</TE>
<TE>   "That was nice, not just jam a shot into the net," said Sawyer,
whose only other NHL goal was against the New York Rangers on Nov. 25
last season. "I got a chance to come out and set up a shot."</TE>
<TE>   The goal gave the Ducks a 3-1 lead and breathing room 6:58 into
the second period.</TE>
<TE>   "We definitely wanted to take two points out of this one," Rucchin
said. "This was a big step for us."</TE>
<TE>   It looked like a misstep at first.</TE>
<TE>   The Thrashers had a 9-2 edge in shots on goal 8 minutes 11 seconds
into the game. That included Vyacheslav Kozlov's power-play goal
after an unusual bounce off the boards behind the net at 4:56.</TE>
<TE>   But Chistov got the Ducks even by knocking in a rebound 17 minutes
into the first period.</TE>
<TE>   Kjellberg put the Ducks ahead 27 seconds into the second period.</TE>
<TE>   After Rucchin forced a turnover, Kjellberg was alone with the puck
in front of the net. His wrist shot gave the Ducks a 2-1 lead.</TE>

<HD>Rose Bowl Picture Remains Thorny Thanks to BCS</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Dufresne</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Note to readers: Taking our lead from four Cal State Sacramento
players, recently reprimanded for greasing their uniforms, we have
used a nonstick cooking spray on this column to provide slicker
transitions in explaining complicated bowl championship series
questions.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Iowa claimed the coveted Floyd of Rosedale trophy for its weekend
victory over Minnesota but would have much preferred receiving roses
from any guy named Floyd.</LD>
<TE>   Because of a technical glitch, otherwise known as the BCS, Rose
Bowl officials might have to keep their freshly cut stems in the
cooler until Dec. 8.</TE>
<TE>   It's as if you want to marry this girl, and you know she'll say
yes, but you can't pop the question until her old man does a complete
background check.</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Bowl wants to put petals to metal and offer Iowa an
invitation to its Jan. 1 game. Yet, until further notice, the
Hawkeyes remain a tantalizing tease.</TE>
<TE>   Only the BCS could turn a simple scenario into a conundrum.</TE>
<TE>   Fact: The Big Ten champion is going to be Iowa or Ohio State and
Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   Fact: The Big Ten champion is contracted to play in the Rose Bowl
unless its winner is No. 1 or No. 2.</TE>
<TE>   Fact: No one can say for certain either school will be in
Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio State, in fact, probably is not Rose Bowl-bound. If the
Buckeyes beat Michigan next week, they'll be headed for the BCS
national title game in the Jan. 3 Fiesta Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   If Ohio State loses to Michigan, then Iowa clinches the Rose Bowl
berth as the Big Ten's automatic champion.</TE>
<TE>   However, there is this one scenario ... isn't there always?</TE>
<TE>   Should the Rose Bowl lose Pacific 10 Conference champion
Washington State to the Fiesta Bowl and the Pac-10's runner-up did
not finish ranked in the BCS top 12, the Rose Bowl could pair Ohio
State as an at-large team against Iowa in a de facto Big Ten
championship game.</TE>
<TE>   (Does anybody else's head hurt?)</TE>
<TE>   Chances are that Iowa is headed west, either as the Big Ten
champion or an at-large pick, but the Rose Bowl can't make it
official because of an upcoming Thursday night game on ESPN.</TE>
<TE>   What, you ask, does Louisville have to do with this?</TE>
<TE>   Nothing, actually.</TE>
<TE>   While Louisville has seemingly appeared on every Thursday night
game this year, we're talking about this Thursday's game between
Miami and Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   Get a pad and paper if you think you need to write this down.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh and Miami are tied for the Big East lead. If Pittsburgh
upsets Miami and wins the Big East title, Miami at 11-1 could earn an
automatic at-large berth if it finishes fourth or higher in the BCS
standings.</TE>
<TE>   If Notre Dame finishes No. 6 or better, it would claim the other
automatic at-large spot and Iowa gets locked out.</TE>
<TE>   While Texas' second defeat made Iowa's Rose Bowl road easier, the
Hawkeyes can get sandwiched if the final BCS standings end in the
following order:</TE>
<TE>   1. Ohio State. 2. Washington State. 3. Oklahoma. 4. Miami. 5.
Iowa. 6. Notre Dame.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, should Iowa climb to No. 4, it would earn an automatic
BCS bid and play in the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Bottom line, Iowa's Rose Bowl chances are looking pretty strong.</TE>
<TE>   If the top teams win out, the BCS bowl picture probably would go
as follows:</TE>
<TE>   Fiesta: Miami-Ohio State; Rose: Washington State-Iowa; Sugar:
Georgia-Florida State; Orange: Notre Dame-Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   That said, there are some strange possibilities still out there,
especially in the Rose.</TE>
<TE>   In one scenario, the Nov. 30 game between USC and Notre Dame could
be a winner-take-all spot for the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Here's how that happens: If Ohio State and Washington State end up
playing for the national title in the Fiesta Bowl, the Rose would get
both at-large selections. It would take Iowa with one choice, while
the other slot could come down to an at-large choice between the
USC-Notre Dame winner.</TE>
<TE>   Another Rose Bowl possibility: Miami vs. Notre Dame?</TE>
<TE>   If it's Ohio State and Washington State in the Fiesta, and Miami
and Notre Dame win automatic at-large berths, this is the game the
Rose Bowl would probably have to make.</TE>
<TE>   Weekend Wrap</TE>
<TE>   Plot line: Coach of school in Southwest pushes team to the brink
with his brutal treatment of players, who nearly revolt but end up
sticking it out to record coming-of-age memories and victories.</TE>
<TE>   This is the promo for ESPN's upcoming movie, "The Junction Boys"
and possibly its sequel, "Mackovic's Boys."</TE>
<TE>   Arizona's 52-41 win over California rates nine out of 10 on the
bizarre-o-meter. Last week, more than 50 players stormed the
president's office to protest the coaching tactics of John Mackovic,
who appeared on the verge of losing his job. Then, the Wildcats
respond with their first Pac-10 win? It should be noted the two
players who carried Mackovic off the field after Saturday's win were
freshmen, not seniors.</TE>
<TE>   If insurrection leads to results, look for player revolts this
week at Vanderbilt, Rutgers, Northwestern, Indiana, Duke and Navy.</TE>
<TE>   Law and disorder: Texas Tech on Thursday issued a "zero-tolerance"
policy regarding fans running on the field after games. The rule
stated anyone breaking this rule would be subject to arrest.
Naturally, after Texas Tech upset Texas on Saturday, thousands of
fans stormed the field. No arrests were made.</TE>
<TE>   The news in Manhattan, Kan., was that fans did not tear down the
goal posts after Kansas State's 49-13 victory against Nebraska. After
all, wins against Nebraska are becoming old hat. Kansas State once
lost 29 consecutive games to Nebraska, but has won three out of the
last five meetings. Just to be safe, Kansas State Coach Bill Snyder
kept his starters on the field well into the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Here's a question all self-respecting Notre Dame fans must ask:
How could Connecticut, in only its third season in Division I-A,
defeat Navy, 38-0, while the Irish last week had to rally to defeat
the Midshipmen, 30-23?</TE>
<TE>   Congratulations to UCLA, which cracked the top 25 in the writers'
and coaches' polls during an off-week.</TE>

<KH>PHILADELPHIA 38, ARIZONA 14</KH>
<HD>Loss of McNabb Overshadows Win</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Playing with a broken right ankle that could sideline him the rest of
the regular season, Donovan McNabb had the best passing game of his
career.</LD>
<LD>   Injured on the third play of the game, McNabb tied a career high
with four touchdown passes, leading the Philadelphia Eagles to a
38-14 victory over the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   McNabb went down after he was sacked by Adrian Wilson and LeVar
Woods on a third-and-three. He clutched his right leg and stayed on
the turf after losing the ball, but returned on the next series for
Philadelphia (7-3).</LD>
<TE>   "I tried not to think about it," McNabb said. "When the game was
going on, I just focused on what I needed to do to get the win."</TE>
<TE>   McNabb's status for the final six games is in doubt. Eagle Coach
Andy Reid said this type of injury typically keeps players out six to
eight weeks.</TE>
<TE>   McNabb, who has never had a serious injury, insists he'll try to
play against San Francisco next Monday night. Koy Detmer would start
if McNabb can't play.</TE>
<TE>   "In my mind, I'll be out there," said McNabb, a two-time Pro Bowl
quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   The Eagles' medical staff was less optimistic.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not something he can play with right now," trainer Rick
Burkholder said. "We'll know more in the next 24-48 hours."</TE>
<TE>   Asked why X-rays weren't taken at halftime, McNabb said: "I
wouldn't let anybody touch it."</TE>
<TE>   Unable to scramble because of his injury, diagnosed as a sprain
during the game, McNabb stayed in the pocket and threw touchdown
passes of two yards to James Thrash, three to Dorsey Levens, 27 to
Todd Pinkston and nine to Duce Staley in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   Though he limped noticeably the entire game, McNabb didn't miss a
play until resting with 4:49 left. He finished 20 of 25 for 255 yards
and one interception, but had no rushing attempts for the first time
in 53 career starts, including playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "They had a quarterback that was gimpy, but their running game was
working so well," said Coach Dave McGinnis, whose Cardinals (4-6)
lost their fourth in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Staley had 136 yards rushing and added 82 more yards receiving on
three catches.</TE>

<KH>ATLANTA 24, NEW ORLEANS 17</KH>
<HD>Vick Up to His Tricks in Win</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>Joe Horn swallowed his pride and admitted he was wrong. Yes, the
Atlanta Falcons have a good team, a worthy rival to his New Orleans
Saints.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a rivalry now," Horn said after firing up the Falcons by
arguing to the contrary.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Vick flew through the air like Superman to score a
touchdown, and the Falcons slowed down the New Orleans offense for a
24-17 victory Sunday -- their second victory over the Saints in four
weeks.</LD>
<TE>   "They whipped us twice," Horn said. "They beat us. We are 0-and-2
against the Falcons. I'm a man. I can admit that."</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta (6-3-1) extended its unbeaten streak to six and move
within a half-game of second-place New Orleans (7-3) in the NFC
South. Tampa Bay (8-2) is alone in first after beating Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   The Falcons were fired up by Horn, who claimed the Falcons were
lucky to win the first meeting, 37-35, on a field goal as time ran
out. He also said the Falcons were basically a one-man team, relying
on Vick to carry them.</TE>
<TE>   "He was disrespecting a lot of people on our team," defensive end
Patrick Kerney said. "Mike is a great quarterback and he's doing a
lot of things. But a lot of people are contributing."</TE>
<TE>   Vick put on another dazzling performance before a raucous Georgia
Dome crowd of 70,382 -- second-largest in Falcon history.</TE>
<TE>   The most spectacular play came in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   On third and goal from the New Orleans seven-yard line, Vick took
a shotgun snap, tucked the ball under his right arm and took off for
the right corner. With several Saints closing in, he didn't appear to
have room to reach the end zone.</TE>
<TE>   Not so fast. Vick switched the ball to his left hand, planted his
right foot at the two -- just inches from the boundary -- and
launched his body toward the goal line. Somehow, he managed to stick
the ball across before a defender sent him sprawling out of bounds.
The amazing play gave Atlanta a 14-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to start calling him Houdini," said receiver Trevor
Gaylor, who hauled in a long pass from a scrambling Vick in the
second quarter and turned it into a 74-yard scoring play. "He can
find a way to get out of any situation."</TE>

<HD>Shockey Takes Redskins by Storm</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>In a sloppy game played on an ugly, rainy day there was one shining
performance -- that of New York Giants' rookie tight end Jeremy
Shockey.</LD>
<LD>   Shockey caught 11 passes for 111 yards and Matt Bryant kicked four
field goals, leading the Giants to a 19-17 victory over the
Washington Redskins in a game delayed more than 10 minutes in the
fourth quarter by the review of a play.</LD>
<LD>   The game had been hyped as the return of five-time Pro Bowl
linebacker Jessie Armstead, who played at Giants Stadium for the
first time since he was waived by New York (6-4) and signed by the
Redskins (4-6).</LD>
<TE>   Shockey, the 14th pick overall in this year's draft out of Miami,
stole the show by coming within two catches of tying the team's
single-game record. Giant tight ends had only 17 catches all last
season.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew he was a go-to guy," said Armstead, who had six tackles.
"You can't name too many tight ends who are better than Shockey in
this league. Although he is a rookie, he's an advanced rookie."</TE>
<TE>   Shockey caught a 13-yard third-down pass from Kerry Collins that
helped set up Bryant's game-deciding 19-yard field goal with 11:56 to
play.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess Kerry felt comfortable delivering it to me, and the
timing was good," said Shockey.</TE>
<TE>   What wasn't good was the time it took to unravel a Redskin
challenge with less than eight minutes left in the game.</TE>
<TE>   Referee Tom White took more than 10 minutes to decide that Giant
halfback Tiki Barber had gone out of bounds on a third-down run short
of a first down at the Giant 34.</TE>
<TE>   Washington Coach Steve Spurrier initially contended that Barber
fumbled before going out of bounds and that the Redskins recovered.</TE>
<TE>   White eventually decided Barber had not fumbled before going out
of bounds. He did allow Spurrier to challenge the spot -- and after
more deliberation it was determined Barber had gone out of bounds
short of a first down.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what the heck was going on," Washington cornerback
Champ Bailey said. "I was talking to the field judge for five
minutes, and he didn't have a clue what was going on either."</TE>
<TE>   After a Giant punt, the Redskins drove 60 yards in 12 plays before
stalling at the New York 25 with just over three minutes remaining.</TE>
<TE>   James Tuthill lost his footing on a 42-yard field-goal attempt
that could have given Washington the lead and the low line drive kick
was blocked by Lance Legree.</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rich Beem and Peter Lonard didn't have much of a strategy entering
the Hyundai Team Matches, they didn't have much experience with
match-play events and had never before played together as a team.</LD>
<LD>   None of that mattered Sunday during the PGA Tour final of the team
matches at Monarch Beach Golf Links in Dana Point, where Beem and
Lonard overcame an early 2-down deficit and upended defending
champions Fred Couples and Mark Calcavecchia, 2 and 1.</LD>
<LD>   Lorie Kane and Janice Moodie defended their title in the LPGA
matches with a 3 and 2 victory over Juli Inkster and Dottie Pepper.
Allen Doyle and Dana Quigley defeated Jim Thorpe and John Jacobs, 2
and 1, for their second consecutive Champions tour title. But while
experience helped the LPGA and Champions Tour players, the lack of it
was key for Beem and Lonard.</LD>
<TE>   "Our caddies had a strategy meeting Friday night at the bar," said
Lonard, a PGA Tour rookie. "We just showed up and did what we were
told."</TE>
<TE>   Couples birdied the first two holes but Beem and Lonard went on a
roll after that. They won three of the next four holes to take a 1-up
lead, then made the turn at 2 up when Lonard made birdie at the
ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Beem made three consecutive birdies at No. 13, 14 and 15 to finish
the rally. Beem and Lonard combined to birdie all five par threes
Sunday, giving them nine birdies in 10 par-three holes for the
weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a fun weekend more than anything else for us," Beem said.
"Neither of us take ourselves too seriously. We both have pretty
laid-back styles."</TE>
<TE>   The early deficit Beem and Lonard faced brought about talk of the
rally monkey, though Lonard, an Australian, wasn't familiar with the
Angels' rally-starting primate. "We're two down and now my caddie is
talking about the rally monkey," Lonard said. "And I have no idea
what he is talking about."</TE>
<TE>   Kane and Moodie had five birdies on the front nine and took a 4-up
lead at the turn before a couple of late birdies by Pepper closed the
gap. The LPGA winners, unlike their PGA Tour counterparts, entered
the event thinking about winning .</TE>
<TE>   Said Kane: "$100,000 and a car is nothing to snub your nose at. I
think there is a different approach from the LPGA side because of
what we play for."</TE>
<TE>   Doyle and Quigley birdied Nos. 8 and 9 to take a 2-up lead at the
turn, then closed the match when Quigley holed a bunker shot for
birdie on the par-five 17th. At the time, Thorpe was waiting to hit a
four-foot birdie attempt that would have extended the match.</TE>

<HD>It's Getting Even Better for Frankel</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Christine</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When trainer Bobby Frankel hung up all those impressive numbers last
year, even winning that elusive first Breeders' Cup race, the totals
had the earmarks of a career year.</LD>
<LD>   But Frankel has been relentless. He won a second Breeders' Cup
race this year, his stakes wins have surpassed last year's output
and, at the $16.5-million mark in total purses, he's likely to have
the highest total in that category since Wayne Lukas set the record
with $17.8 million in 1988.</LD>
<LD>   Frankel's 54th stakes win of 2002, with the grass filly Rolly
Polly in Sunday's $76,970 Safely Kept Handicap at Hollywood Park,
came in neither a graded race nor a six-figure stake, but it has been
victories like this that have widened the gap between him and Bob
Baffert on the money list. Baffert, who has been the purse leader for
the last four years, trails by more than $5 million.</LD>
<TE>   In 2001, Frankel scored 49 stakes wins, 36 of them graded and 18
in Grade I events. After Sunday, those totals for 2002 were 54, 40
and 14, with his purses already dwarfing last year's total by about
$2 million. Frankel still has several Grade I races to shoot at,
including the Hollywood Turf Cup, the Hollywood Derby and the
Matriarch over the next two weekends.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a little different than last year, but it's been a
great year," Frankel said. "I'm winning different races, and more
purse money accumulated this year. Sometimes I've been lucky, and
sometimes I haven't been lucky, like [Saturday] at Churchill Downs,"
with Glia, beaten by a neck in the Mrs. Revere Stakes.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been at least a half-dozen [losses] like that one," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Frankel, who has been the Eclipse Award-winning trainer the last
two years, hasn't given up trying to break Lukas' 1988 record.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd need to win three $500,000 races to have a shot," he said.
"But I'm running in four of them before the end of the year. I have
to really get hot to have a chance."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Industry sources say that the National Thoroughbred Racing Assn.
is about to announce that there will be a "systematic review" of
hundreds of pick-four and pick-six races at many tracks. The audit
would establish whether the suspected past-posting -- betting after
opening legs of a multiple-race bet have already been run -- is more
widespread than already known.</TE>
<TE>   After the $3-million Breeders' Cup pick six was reported to have
been won with an altered ticket last month, two other bets -- a pick
four at Balmoral Park near Chicago and a pick six at Belmont Park --
appeared to have been won with similar betting patterns.</TE>
<TE>   The number of winning pick-four and pick-six tickets that the NTRA
would dissect is expected to pass the 1,000 mark.</TE>
<TE>   The NTRA is soliciting the help of the three major tote companies
as well as the three major racetrack ownerships -- Magna
Entertainment, Churchill Downs and the New York Racing Assn. --
before it launches the study. Santa Anita is one of Magna's tracks
and Hollywood Park is owned by Churchill Downs.</TE>

<HD>Poly Seeks Nice Sunset Experience</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Long Beach Poly has opened the last three Southern Section Division I
playoffs against Fountain Valley from the Sunset League. This year,
it's another case of deja vu, with a twist.</LD>
<LD>   The three-time defending champion Jackrabbits, winners of the
Moore League for the 11th year in a row, learned they open against
another Sunset League team when the section's playoff pairings were
announced Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   This time around, it's Huntington Beach Edison, the team Poly
beat, 42-28, in last year's section final.</LD>
<TE>   Tommy Grady, who passed for 268 yards and four touchdowns in last
season's title game at Edison Field, returns, but with a less
productive cast.</TE>
<TE>   The Chargers (4-6) finished fourth in their league and earned the
division's only at-large berth that was not awarded to a Serra League
school.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, they're a threat to us," Poly Coach Raul Lara said.
"They still have a great quarterback and great coaches who come up
with great schemes."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As expected, the Serra League became the first in section history
to have all its teams make the playoffs in 11-man football.</TE>
<TE>   League champion Bellflower St. John Bosco (8-2) is seeded No. 3 in
Division I and will open against Fountain Valley (4-6). Long Beach
Poly (9-1) and Los Alamitos (9-0-1) are seeded Nos. 1 and 2,
respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Other games involving Serra League teams: Runner-up Santa Ana
Mater Dei (7-3) plays host to Redlands East Valley (6-3-1),
third-place La Puente Bishop Amat (5-5) is at Redlands (7-3),
fourth-place Los Angeles Loyola (7-3) is at Lakewood (8-2), and
fifth-place Anaheim Servite (7-3) is at Rialto Eisenhower (6-4).</TE>
<TE>   The division's most intriguing game -- and maybe the entire first
round's: Last-place Santa Margarita (6-4) plays fourth-seeded Anaheim
Esperanza (9-1) at Placentia Valencia.</TE>
<TE>   Esperanza, in Coach Gary Meek's final season before taking over as
the school's athletic director, finished second to Los Alamitos in
the Sunset League.</TE>
<TE>   "If we had won league, it would have been different," Meek said.
"We play Santa Margarita and then Mater Dei. It's going to be a tough
road for us."</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific Coast League managed to get a fifth-place team into
the Division IX field when it submitted Laguna Beach as its
fourth-place entrant.</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Beach finished 5-5, 1-4 in league, behind fourth-place
Santa Ana Calvary Chapel (4-6, 2-3). Teams with at least .500 records
are given consideration for at-large berths before teams with poorer
records.</TE>
<TE>   League coordinator Mark Cunningham, the coach at Irvine
University, approached Calvary Chapel Athletic Director Mike Rausch
and Coach Jay Johnson with the plan to submit Laguna Beach as the
fourth-place team.</TE>
<TE>   "If Calvary Chapel said no, we would have respected that,"
Cunningham said. "If you don't have a chance and someone else in your
league does, you ought to allow that to happen. And, it's legal."</TE>
<TE>   It is the first time Laguna Beach has made the playoffs since
1987.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The most hotly contested at-large berth race was in Division VI,
where six teams were vying for one spot.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine (6-4), which finished in a three-way tie for second in the
Sea View League, won out and will play second-seeded Orange Lutheran
(8-2) at Brea Olinda.</TE>
<TE>   Villa Park (7-3), credited last week with a forfeit victory over
Placentia Valencia, and Bellflower (7-3) had better records than the
Vaqueros, but the seeding committee is not obligated to base its
decision strictly on that.</TE>
<TE>   "Strength of league is a strong factor," said Rob Wigod, section
assistant commissioner in charge of football.</TE>
<TE>   "That Irvine beat two of the top teams in the division [Santa Ana
Foothill and Newport Harbor] was pretty compelling, as well."</TE>
<TE>   It made sense to Irvine Coach Terry Henigan.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a difference between finishing fourth," he said, "and
tying for second and losing a coin flip."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this season, Lancaster Paraclete had its 28-game winning
streak ended by Fontana Kaiser. On Friday, it lost its first league
championship in six years. Chase Twedell rushed 34 times for 210
yards and two touchdowns, and returned the second-half kickoff 92
yards for another score to give Cerritos Valley Christian a 47-21
victory and the Olympic League title, its first since 1997.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't a fluke," said Paraclete Coach Jeff Cortez, whose team
has won five consecutive division titles and is in its first season
in the Olympic League. "Their offensive line is really good."</TE>
<TE>   Paraclete (7-3), which won four consecutive titles in Division XII
beginning in 1998, is unseeded in Division XI, which it won in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as I'm concerned, [Cerritos Valley Christian] is the team
to beat," Cortez said. "We still expect to play in the championship
game Dec. 14, and I expect Valley to be there."</TE>
<TE>   Valley Christian (9-1) is seeded second behind Carpinteria (10-0).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jason Chamberlin, the offensive tackle for Glendale who was in a
coma for two days after collapsing from heat exhaustion before the
season began, returned to the lineup to play in the season-ending
31-0 victory over Glendale Hoover.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been practicing with us for three weeks, but we didn't want
to push him," Coach Loi Phan said. "After the game he had a smile
from ear to ear."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Simi Valley had a 19-game losing streak in the Marmonte League but
figured it had a chance to end it against Simi Valley Royal.</TE>
<TE>   And the Pioneers were in position to win until Royal quarterback
Kyle Uebelhardt passed 32 yards to David Woolever with 40 seconds
left to give the Highlanders a 28-21 victory.</TE>
<TE>   Simi Valley had tied the score on Dan Mooney's six-yard run with
1:21 left.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Foothill League has long been dominated by Newhall Hart, but
Canyon Country Canyon has something to crow about after its 34-25
victory over Saugus.</TE>
<TE>   The Cowboys finished with their best regular-season record (9-1,
4-1 in league) since 1990, and receiver Kevin Estes set a school
record with 79 receptions this season, catching eight passes for 119
yards and two touchdowns against Saugus.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Moreno Valley Canyon Springs had not trailed in any of its first
nine games, but the Cougars were no match for Riverside North in the
game that would decide the Ivy League championship.</TE>
<TE>   Dion Morton passed for 224 yards and three touchdowns, all to
different receivers, as North won, 28-17.</TE>
<TE>   Canyon Springs took the lead on a school-record 54-yard field goal
by Mike Hughes, but quickly fell behind, 21-3.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Valencia quarterback Stephen Wright suffered a separated shoulder
and a possible broken collarbone in the fourth quarter of the
Vikings' 39-15 loss to Hart. Wright will be sidelined for the
playoffs.... Quartz Hill prevented Palmdale Highland from finishing
in a three-way tie for first place in the Golden League with its
22-12 victory over the Bulldogs. With a victory, Highland (7-3, 3-2)
would have shared the title after Palmdale (9-1, 4-1) pulled off a
20-15 upset of Antelope Valley (8-2, 4-1).... Mission Viejo is the
top-seeded team going into the Division II playoffs with 24
consecutive victories, currently the section's longest streak.</TE>

<KH>JACKSONVILLE 24, HOUSTON 21</KH>
<HD>After Quick Start, Jaguars Nearly Get Hit by Carr</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>The Jacksonville Jaguars didn't take expansion Houston seriously the
first time, and it cost them. The Jaguars were prepared this time,
yet they nearly blew it again.</LD>
<LD>   Mark Brunell saved Jacksonville from the embarrassment of losing
to the Texans twice in one season by throwing two touchdown passes in
the Jaguars' 24-21 victory Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "To a certain degree, we took them kind of lightly the first
time," running back Stacey Mack said of the Jaguars' 21-19 loss to
Houston in Jacksonville on Oct. 27. "We came into this game a lot
more aggressively."</LD>
<TE>   The attitude helped the Jaguars (5-5) take a 24-7 lead, but David
Carr nearly led the Texans (2-8) to another victory. He scored on
second-half runs of two and 14 yards -- the latter coming with 2:04
left.</TE>
<TE>   The Texans got one last chance, taking possession at their 18-yard
line with 1:32 to play, but Carr was sacked twice and threw an
incomplete pass to end it.</TE>
<TE>   Brunell was relieved.</TE>
<TE>   "You have a tendency to get on your heels a little bit after
getting a big lead," Brunell said. "But you have to fight to continue
to be aggressive."</TE>
<TE>   The Jaguars are the only expansion team to beat an opponent twice
in the same season since the league expanded in 1960. Jacksonville,
in its first season in 1995, beat Cleveland twice.</TE>
<TE>   "We got to where we wanted to be. Now the season begins," said
Jaguar Coach Tom Coughlin, whose team has consecutive victories after
losing four in a row. "It's a six-game schedule. We did get two wins
in a row, and I'm pleased with that."</TE>
<TE>   Jacksonville went ahead, 17-7, at halftime, on Mack's one-yard
run, Brunell's two-yard touchdown pass to tight end Kyle Brady and
Tim Seder's 22-yard field goal.</TE>
<TE>   Houston's Jermaine Lewis fumbled a punt while looking into the sun
in the third quarter, giving the Jaguars a first down at the Texan
27. Brunell put the Jaguars ahead by 17 with 12:35 left in the third
quarter when he ran to his right to escape the rush and connected
with Jimmy Smith for a 13-yard score.</TE>
<TE>   Carr completed 22 of 30 passes for 228 yards. He was sacked four
times for 34 yards in losses.</TE>
<TE>   "Our team is frustrated, and they are upset," Texan Coach Dom
Capers said. "Determination is the only thing that pulls you out of
these situations. You have to keep fighting."</TE>
<TE>   Jacksonville got its first break when Marlon McCree intercepted a
pass by Carr and returned it to the Texan two-yard line, where McCree
was tackled by Carr. Mack finally punched it in from a yard out on
fourth down.</TE>
<TE>   Next, the Jaguars put together a 96-yard drive in the second
quarter, capped by Brunell's touchdown pass to Brady.</TE>
<TE>   Houston's only touchdown of the first half came when Carr found
Corey Bradford open on the outside for a 52-yard pass play.</TE>

<DL>ST. PAUL, Minn.</DL>
<LD>A 4-1 victory over the Edmonton Oilers on Saturday lightened the mood
among the Kings, ending a three-game losing streak and giving them an
8-6-2-2 record despite playing 12 of their first 18 games on the
road.</LD>
<LD>   "It allows us to go into the last two games of this trip with the
knowledge that we're going back home with at least a .500 record on
the season with arguably the toughest schedule in the National Hockey
League to start the season," Coach Andy Murray said.</LD>
<LD>   "We've had a few people out but we're working our way through it."</LD>
<TE>   After playing the Minnesota Wild on Tuesday and the St. Louis
Blues on Thursday to wrap up an eight-game trip, the Kings will
return home to a more favorable schedule, playing five of six games
at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Their only road game during that time will involve a short bus
trip Nov. 29 to play the Mighty Ducks at the Arrowhead Pond.</TE>
<TE>   They'll play nine of 16 games at Staples Center in January, 10 of
15 at home in March. And they expect to have Jason Allison back in
the lineup in February, when they make their only other trip of
longer than three games, a five-game journey through Philadelphia,
Buffalo, Detroit, Pittsburgh and Columbus, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ziggy Palffy, who hadn't scored since opening night, was a bit
sheepish about ending his 10-game goal-scoring drought with an
empty-net goal Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Murray said he deserved better.</TE>
<TE>   "I told Ziggy after the second period, 'If you work as hard as
you're working tonight and you're around the puck as much as you've
been, you'll get three goals in the third period,' " the coach said.
Palffy led the Kings with seven shots on goal. "If he's around the
puck like that, it's going to go in for him."</TE>

<HD>One Big Vote for Jackson</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If USA Basketball has begun the process of choosing Larry Brown and
not Phil Jackson as its next Olympic coach, then it probably should
start looking for a center too.</LD>
<LD>   "There's a pain on the outside part of my knee in 2004," Shaquille
O'Neal said with a crooked smile Sunday afternoon. "If Phil's not the
coach, I probably would not play through the pain.</LD>
<LD>   "It's too far ahead to think about. However, my knee will be
hurting in 2004. Larry Brown's a good guy. I love Larry Brown to
death. So, I really can't answer that right now."</LD>
<TE>   The selection committee met through Saturday in New York. While a
coach was not named, the front-runner -- Brown, according to one
report and confirmed from an official inside the organization -- was
identified, and the mechanics of the selection (signing the contract,
etc.) began.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said he was not disappointed.</TE>
<TE>   "There's plenty of guys who have served over a period of time as
assistant coaches that probably deserve a chance," he said. "Those
guys obviously spent some time building credentials with the
committee."</TE>
<TE>   He added that he would not serve as an assistant to curry the same
favor with USA Basketball for the 2008 Games, because he would not be
an NBA coach in six-plus years.</TE>
<TE>   "Once you leave active coaching, you lose touch with some of the
players that are going to be there and be an important part of the
team, and their style of play and how they relate to the team,"
Jackson said. "You've got to be on top of that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal said he probably would not play on the upcoming trip
through Dallas and San Antonio, and that he continues to focus on a
Friday return against the Chicago Bulls.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson would not rule out O'Neal playing Wednesday against the
Spurs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal, on ending his brief feud with Bill Walton: "From now on, I
only respond to comments from real legendary big men. You quote me on
that. I said it. Real legendary big men. Like, Mr. Russell. Mr.
Abdul[-Jabbar]. Mr. Mikan. I don't need his help."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Devean George (ankle) and Mark Madsen (hamstring) could be
available by Tuesday night's game in Dallas.</TE>

<HD>Lakers Stuck in Middle</HD>
<DH>Bryant scores 46 points but misses open finger roll and
L.A. falls, 93-89, to Rockets for fifth loss in six games.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The differences are found now not in defeat, but in the breadth of
it, by short or wide, Sunday night by a foot or so, the distance
between Kobe Bryant's fingers and the rim, and in the smirk that
pulled at his face immediately afterward.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers lost for the fifth time in six games, by 93-89 to the
Houston Rockets at Staples Center, where Bryant scored 46 points but
missed the finger roll with 9.2 seconds left that would have given
them the lead and, perhaps, a victory before two difficult midweek
games in Texas.</LD>
<LD>   Afterward, 20 minutes after a grinning Yao Ming left the arena,
having scored a career-high 20 points on nine-of-nine shooting,
Bryant found himself again in a subdued locker room. The Rockets had
earned their win in three frantic minutes at the start of the fourth
quarter, on a 13-4 run when the Lakers could defend themselves with
neither Bryant, who was taking his only rest of the game, nor
Shaquille O'Neal, whose toe is a game or two from being NBA-ready.</LD>
<TE>   Bryant was on the bench, a towel over his legs, the mouthpiece
that guarded his ravaged lip in his lap.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to be in there," Bryant said. "I want to be in there. It's
disappointing to have that happen. It's upsetting to have that
happen."</TE>
<TE>   In all, the Rocket run was 17-4 from the start of the fourth
quarter, and 17-2 after Derek Fisher (season-high 17 points) made a
jump shot to begin the quarter, which the Lakers began with a
five-point lead. Four minutes later, they were behind by eight
points, and staring hopefully at Bryant, who made 18 of 37 field-goal
attempts despite four black stitches that peeked out from his top
lip, still swollen after Friday night's collision with Golden State's
Antawn Jamison.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant's 46 were his season's high, two nights after his 45
against the Warriors, 10 nights after 41 in Boston. He had 16 points
in the third quarter, and while Fisher did a solid job on defense
against Houston's Steve Francis, Bryant appeared to be lifting the
Lakers again, almost by himself.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to beat a team with one guy," Francis said of Bryant,
"but he came close."</TE>
<TE>   It is a signature quality of the Shaq-less Lakers, the scoring
runs and droughts that bring them into games and shoot them out of
them. While Yao stood beneath the basket and caught passes and made
layups, and while the Rockets scored 34 points in the final quarter,
when they made 12 of 19 field-goal attempts, the Lakers were outshot
again, and have lost seven of their first 10 games.</TE>
<TE>   "Well," Laker forward Rick Fox said, "we won't easily forget what
these first 10 games have felt like, that's for sure. We've got a lot
of catching up to do. There's a lot of people we've already seen who
we will meet again.</TE>
<TE>   "But, hey, it's a long season. With Shaquille back, we'll make a
better run."</TE>
<TE>   Yao, the 7-foot-5 rookie from China, stood up with 1:30 left in
the first quarter, and the people at Staples perked up a little. Some
looked up long enough to boo.</TE>
<TE>   Yao was guarded not by O'Neal, a matchup desired by all but Phil
Jackson, but by Slava Medvedenko.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel sorry for the kid," Jackson had said before the game. "I
was hoping it wouldn't be Shaq's first game back, actually. I don't
know, [O'Neal] would break him in two. It wouldn't be fair for the
kid to go against Shaquille, such a dominant force, such a dynamic
amount of energy."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal, in the final days of recovery from off-season toe surgery,
stayed in the locker room, and so Yao worked first against Medvedenko
and then against Samaki Walker. Yao had eight points and two rebounds
in his first five minutes. By halftime, in 11 minutes, he had a
career-high 12 points, two on a baseline spin move that soldered
Medvedenko to the floor, and four rebounds and two traveling
violations.</TE>
<TE>   He scored eight points in the fourth quarter, which helped bring
the Rockets into the final minute, ahead by four points. Fisher made
a three-pointer from the top to bring the Lakers to within 90-89 and,
after a Rocket turnover, Bryant stood on the left wing, the ball in
his hands.</TE>
<TE>   He stuttered right, turned into the lane, and surged to the front
of the rim, right arm extended, the basketball gliding from his
fingertips. As the crowd gasped, the ball struck the heel of the rim
and bounced away, and Bryant landed with his hands on his hips. With
8.2 seconds left, Cuttino Mobley made two free throws. Bryant then
missed a three, and Mobley made one of two free throws, but the story
was in the finger roll that rolled out.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried to George Gervin it," Bryant said with a puffy, rueful
smile. "And the ice melted before the ball hit the rim."</TE>

<LD>   The All-Star forward scored 24 points and made a 21-footer with
1.5 seconds left as the Kings stayed unbeaten at home this season
with a 101-99 victory Sunday night over the Orlando Magic.</LD>
<LD>   Tracy McGrady made two three-pointers and Pat Burke tipped in a
shot with four seconds left as Orlando rallied from an eight-point
deficit in the final minute to tie the game at 99-99.</LD>
<TE>   Following a timeout, Webber took the inbounds pass and Bobby
Jackson went around him to give Webber some room. He quickly put up a
shot over Shawn Kemp that went straight in. Darrell Armstrong's
desperation shot at the buzzer from near midcourt was not close.</TE>
<TE>   In was only the second game-winning basket in Webber's five
seasons with the Kings, who are 5-0 at home.</TE>
<TE>   "I just felt real confident about it before I shot it," said
Webber, who had 10 rebounds. "There was a moment of suspense, you're
holding your breath until it goes in. I don't care if you've done
this a thousand times, it feels good when it happens."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, who made 10 of 11 shots and had 22 points, said the play
was not designed for Webber.</TE>
<TE>   "He was wide open, they [the defenders] followed me," Jackson
said. "I thought I was going to get the ball."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings led, 98-90, with 41 seconds left. A steal by Darrell
Armstrong on an inbounds pass followed by Burke's tip in nearly sent
the game into overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 100, Washington 84 -- Keith Van Horn converted a
three-point play with 5:41 left to begin a game clinching 10-0 run
for the 76ers.</TE>
<TE>   Improving to 6-0 at home, the 76ers got 28 points from Allen
Iverson as they moved into a tie with the New Jersey Nets for first
place in the Atlantic Division.</TE>
<TE>   In attendance among the near-sellout crowd of 20,437 was Eagle
quarterback Donovan McNabb, who broke his right ankle while playing
against Arizona earlier in the day. He received a standing ovation
when shown on the scoreboard during the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Utah 82, Toronto 78 -- Karl Malone scored 11 of his 15 points in
the fourth quarter to help the Jazz win at Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   After combining for only 12 points in the first three quarters,
Malone and John Stockton combined for 18 in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Malone grabbed an offensive rebound and made a short jumper to
give Utah a four-point lead with 1:35 left. He then made one of two
free throws, giving the Jazz a 81-76 lead with 1:24 left.</TE>
<TE>   After Toronto's Morris Peterson made a layup, Stockton made one of
two free throws with 44 seconds left to give Utah an 82-78 lead.</TE>

<HD>Once Again, Hewitt Wins Masters Cup</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lleyton Hewitt has the ATP Masters Cup title to go with the year-end
No. 1 ranking for the second consecutive season.</LD>
<LD>   The Wimbledon champion defeated Juan Carlos Ferrero, 7-5, 7-5,
2-6, 2-6, 6-4, Sunday to win the eight-player tournament at Shanghai,
China. On the way to the final, Hewitt beat Albert Costa, Marat Safin
and Roger Federer and lost to Carlos Moya.</LD>
<LD>   "Every match this week was a grind," Hewitt said. "I didn't have
one easy match. I think maybe a couple of three-hour matches and a
four-hour match, nearly. I don't know how I held up at all."</LD>
<TE>   Hewitt is the first player since Pete Sampras in 1997 to win
consecutive season-ending championships. During the week, he secured
a second consecutive year-end No. 1 ranking.</TE>
<TE>   Golf</TE>
<TE>   Behind strong performances from Hale Irwin and Tom Lehman in
terrible weather at St. Simons Island, Ga., the U.S. team easily
retained the UBS Warburg Cup and kept Arnold Palmer undefeated as a
captain in all cup competitions.</TE>
<TE>   The final score was 14 1/2-9 1/2 in matches between the U.S. and
the Rest of the World. Half of the players were from the 40-49 age
group, the other half 50 and over.</TE>
<TE>   Most have played long enough to know this was a tough day --
temperatures in the mid-40s with gusts up to 30 mph, strong enough to
twice blow Eduardo Romero's ball off the green on No. 7. Victory was
hardly in doubt for the U.S., even though World captain Gary Player
atoned for his loss last year by defeating Palmer, 6 and 5, in the
opening match.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   The Florida Marlins will trade left-hander Mike Hampton --
acquired from Colorado on Saturday -- to the Atlanta Braves for
reliever Tim Spooneybarger and a minor leaguer, a baseball source
said on condition of anonymity. The source said details must be
finalized, the trade must be approved by the commissioner's office,
and the players must pass physicals.</TE>
<TE>   The acquisition of Hampton may end the Braves' interest in
re-signing free-agent left-hander Tom Glavine, who has spent his
entire 16-year career in Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   The Braves will owe Hampton about $35.5 million over the next
three years, with the Rockies and Marlins paying off the final three
years of his eight-year, $121-million deal.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Middle-distance star Hicham El Guerrouj and marathon record-holder
Paula Radcliffe were chosen athletes of the year by track and field's
governing body in Monte Carlo.</TE>
<TE>   El Guerrouj is the first to win the award twice in a row. In 2002,
he won all 11 races at 1,500 meters or the mile.</TE>
<TE>   Radcliffe set a women's best of 2 hours 17 minutes 18 seconds in
winning the Chicago Marathon on Oct. 14.</TE>
<TE>   Ukrainian Yana Klochkova won two golds and a bronze Sunday in
swimming's FINA World Cup at Rio de Janeiro to increase her total to
four golds and two bronze for the competition. The 20-year-old won
the 400 individual medley in 4 minutes 36.94 seconds and the 200
butterfly in 2:09.04. She was third in the 400 freestyle, won by
Rachel Komisarz in 4:07.66.</TE>
<TE>   American Amanda Beard got her second gold of the meet, taking the
200 breaststroke in 2:23.16 seconds. Haley Cope won the 100
backstroke in 59.93; and Gabrielle Rose took the 100 individual
medley in 1:01.2.</TE>
<TE>   Canada's Cindy Klassen won her third race at the Speedskating
World Cup in Erfurt, Germany. Klassen, the 500 and 1,000 winner,
claimed the 1,500 in 1 minute 58.47 seconds, edging four-time Olympic
champion Claudia Pechstein of Germany by 0.03 of a second.</TE>

<HD>Young, Turgeon Are Too Much for Blue Jackets</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Scott Young scored with 1:04 left in regulation, then Pierre Turgeon
tipped in a long shot by Young 3:19 into overtime to rally the Dallas
Stars to a 3-2 victory over the Columbus Blue Jackets Sunday night in
Dallas.</LD>
<LD>   The Western Conference-leading Stars won their fourth straight,
with Turgeon scoring the winner in the last three. Dallas also
remained unbeaten at home at 7-0-0-1.</LD>
<LD>   The Blue Jackets appeared headed to their first win in Dallas as
they led, 2-0, with goaltender Marc Denis playing fabulously.</LD>
<TE>   But Bill Guerin scored on a cross-ice pass from Mike Modano with
6:54 left to begin the Stars' comeback, then Young scored seconds
after Dallas pulled Marty Turco for an extra skater.</TE>
<TE>   Young's tying goal -- which appeared to go in off a defenseman --
was set up by Derian Hatcher, who fought off a defenseman with one
arm to keep control of the puck and allow Turco to leave the ice.
Seconds earlier, Hatcher made a stick save just in front of the
Dallas goal when Turco was caught roaming behind the net.</TE>
<TE>   Young nearly had the winner at 3:11 of overtime, but his
point-blank shot hit the crossbar. Phillipe Boucher and Modano also
had good chances, but Denis stopped them.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 4, Nashville 2 -- Steve Sullivan scored two goals at
Chicago to help the Blackhawks extend their unbeaten streak to six
games.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Zhamnov had a goal and two assists for the Blackhawks, who
got 28 saves from Jocelyn Thibault. Boris Mironov also scored for
Chicago, 4-0-2 during its streak.</TE>
<TE>   Although Zhamnov leads the Blackhawks with 17 points, his goal was
only his second this season and first in 15 games.</TE>
<TE>   Nashville rookie Vernon Fiddler had his first NHL goal and assist.
The Predators, who are winless in four games (0-3-1), have scored
only five goals during that span.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 2, Carolina 1 -- Cory Sarich scored with 1:15 left in
overtime and Nikolai Khabibulin stopped 35 shots at Raleigh, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   Pavel Kubina scored with 8:29 left in regulation to ruin Kevin
Weekes' shutout bid against his former team, and Sarich's second
career goal in 226 games improved the Southeast Division-leading
Lightning to 6-1 this season against teams from its division.</TE>
<TE>   Weekes, acquired in March from the Lightning, and Carolina's
defense kept one of the NHL's top offenses bottled up most of the
game until Kubina scored his first of the season, breaking a 19-game
streak without a goal.</TE>
<TE>   Carolina fell to 4-1-2-1 eight games into a franchise-record
nine-game homestand.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 4, Phoenix 4 -- Mike Johnson scored the tying goal at
Phoenix as the Coyotes turned the tables on the Avalanche. The first
time the teams met, Colorado came from two goals behind to beat the
Coyotes, 3-2, on Oct. 22.</TE>

<KH>WEEK 11 IN THE NFL</KH>
<HD>Afternoon of High Trauma</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a better Sunday, like most Sundays the Pittsburgh Steelers have
had since Tommy Maddox took over at quarterback, Maddox would have
been the one taking a knee, winding down the clock on another Steeler
victory.</LD>
<LD>   But this afternoon was an unusually brutal one, even for a league
built and reared on violence. This time, Maddox's teammates were the
ones on one knee, their heads hung in silent prayer, as the season's
brightest, most unexpected success story was strapped onto a trauma
backboard and carefully lifted into an ambulance.</LD>
<LD>   Maddox, 4-1-1 in his first six starts with Pittsburgh, was trying
to rally the Steelers again when he was tripped while attempting an
on-the-run pass on the last play of the third quarter. Maddox was on
his way down when, just before flipping the ball to receiver Antwaan
Randle El, he was hit in the left shoulder by Tennessee linebacker
Keith Bulluck's forearm.</LD>
<TE>   Maddox rolled onto his head as he hit the ground. Randle El
grabbed the pass and was tackled. As both teams retreated to their
respective huddles, they noticed Maddox still on the ground, face
down and motionless.</TE>
<TE>   Trainers and doctors were summoned. Maddox was conscious, but he
had no feeling in his arms and legs. An ambulance was driven onto the
field. For more than 15 minutes, medical staffers worked on Maddox,
placing his neck in a brace and fastening him to the backboard.</TE>
<TE>   Players from both teams knelt and prayed. Bulluck stood alongside
the ambulance as the door closed, leading the crowd at the Coliseum
in Nashville in a standing ovation for the Pittsburgh quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   Maddox was taken to the trauma unit at nearby Baptist Hospital for
tests and overnight observation. By the time Tennessee had concluded
its 31-23 victory over Pittsburgh, reports from the hospital were
filtering back to the stadium. Maddox was moving his arms and legs
again and Steeler spokesman Ron Wahl said the player was "awake,
alert and has been talking with his family."</TE>
<TE>   Maddox was to be reexamined today, but according to Wahl, the
initial diagnosis was a concussion and a spinal cord contusion.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all cautiously optimistic," Pittsburgh Coach Bill Cowher
said.</TE>
<TE>   Maddox was one of three quarterbacks seriously injured Sunday.
Denver's Brian Griese could be sidelined for up to a month after
spraining his left knee in the Broncos' 31-9 victory over Seattle.
Philadelphia's Donovan McNabb will be out six to eight weeks after
breaking his right ankle during the Eagles' 38-14 triumph over
Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   That last bit of news startled fans in Philadelphia, who saw
McNabb tackled hard on the third play of the game, noticed him
limping a little after that ... and then watched him play more than 3
1/2 quarters, completing 20 of 25 passes for 255 yards and four
touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't until after the game that X-rays were taken, revealing
that McNabb had fractured his right fibula on that first-quarter
play, meaning he had completed 80% of his passes and equaled his
career high by throwing for four scores while playing on a broken
leg.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the NFL has produced a quarterback tough enough to match
tales with Jack Youngblood, the former Ram defensive end who once
played a Super Bowl with a leg fracture.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, McNabb and the Eagles thought the injury was a sprain.</TE>
<TE>   "I know he was hurting," Eagle Coach Andy Reid said after the
game. "We obviously didn't know this.... He wasn't going to come out,
and showed a lot of grit."</TE>
<TE>   McNabb said he simply "blocked it out." With the game underway and
the adrenaline flowing, McNabb said he "just tried to do whatever it
took to win the game.... You've got to keep fighting."</TE>
<TE>   Once football fans in Pennsylvania received the encouraging news
from the hospital about Maddox's condition, they were left to cope
with the bulletin that McNabb would be sidelined for the remainder of
the regular season, maybe longer.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, the state's hopes of a Pittsburgh-Philadelphia Super
Bowl rest in the hands of Kordell Stewart and Koy Detmer.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart, who began the season as the Steeler starter before being
replaced by Maddox midway through Pittsburgh's third game, inherited
a 31-7 deficit by the time he entered the game against the Titans.
Stewart completed 13 of 17 passes for 124 yards, two touchdowns and a
pair of two-point conversions, pulling the Steelers within 31-23 with
1:26 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh tried an onside kick, but Tennessee recovered and ran
out the clock.</TE>
<TE>   Detmer replaced McNabb with 4:49 left and the Eagles comfortably
in control of the game. McNabb is the richest player in the NFL, and
the most valuable not named Brett Favre. With McNabb passing for 17
touchdowns and rushing for nearly 500 yards, the Eagles are 7-3. But
Philadelphia faces back-to-back games against San Francisco and St.
Louis -- and a rising challenge from the 6-4 New York Giants, who won
their third in a row with a 19-17 decision over Washington.</TE>
<TE>   McNabb said the right things, promising that, "If I'm not out
there and Koy is, we're not going to miss a beat." But the sobering
fact remains that Detmer, the man in charge of getting the Eagles to
the playoffs, has made only six starts in his four-year NFL career --
and none since 1999.</TE>
<TE>   As Miami knows, a Super Bowl contender is only as good as its
backup quarterback. The Dolphins were 0-3 with Jay Fiedler out with a
broken thumb before second-stringer Ray Lucas finally broke through
Sunday with a 26-7 victory over Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   Denver, with Steve Beuerlein in reserve, has reason for optimism.
After Griese was knocked out of the game by Seattle rookie Rocky
Bernard, who rolled up on the quarterback's left knee, Beuerlein came
in and produced a touchdown with his first pass, a one-yard toss to
Patrick Hape. Beuerlein threw only one more pass the rest of the
game. That went for a touchdown too.</TE>
<TE>   Beuerlein was seconds away from replacing Griese in the Broncos'
opener before Coach Mike Shanahan changed his mind and stayed with
his struggling starter against the Rams. Griese held on to win that
game, and held onto his job, helping the Broncos win seven of 10
games.</TE>
<TE>   Griese is scheduled to undergo an MRI exam today. Depending on the
results, a Bronco spokesman said Griese either could be sidelined a
month, or back in the lineup next Sunday against Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   And in a Nashville hospital, more tests will be done on Maddox
today.</TE>
<TE>   If a concussion and a bruised spinal cord are the worst of it, if
Maddox walks out of that hospital today, the Steelers and their fans
will consider their trip to Tennessee a major success.</TE>

<HD>Raiders Finally Give Up the Ghost</HD>
<DH>They put bitter loss in last season's playoffs behind them
with 27-20 win over Patriots.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sam Farmer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>Six days after doing away with one ghost -- winning at Denver for the
first time in eight tries -- the Oakland Raiders rid themselves of
another Sunday with a 27-20 victory over New England.</LD>
<LD>   It wasn't so long ago that New England players were frolicking in
a Foxboro blizzard, beating the Raiders in an AFC semifinal game that
hinged on a controversial no-fumble call, then forming snow angels in
the end zone. The Patriots went on to win the Super Bowl. The Raiders
spent the next 10 months quietly fuming over the "snow job," and
plotting their revenge.</LD>
<LD>   Sunday, that comeuppance arrived.</LD>
<TE>   "They took something very valuable from us last year," Raider
tight end Roland Williams said. "They took the world championship and
our chance to win one. You try to be professional and forget about
it. However, you can't. Because we stayed up many a night being very
sick about what happened in Foxboro.... This is a nice punch in the
gut."</TE>
<TE>   And a mighty body blow it was, considering how tight the playoff
race is becoming. The Raiders (6-4) have the same record as three
other AFC teams and are a game behind San Diego and Denver in the AFC
West.</TE>
<TE>   All of a sudden, Oakland's four-game losing streak -- which came
on the heels of a 4-0 start -- seems like a bad dream.</TE>
<TE>   The Raider defense hurried Patriot quarterback Tom Brady all
night, sacking him four times and keeping New England's offense out
of the end zone. The Patriots' two touchdowns came on a bizarre
48-yard interception return by linebacker Tedy Bruschi -- who grabbed
the football when it ricocheted off a teammate's shoe -- and an
86-yard kickoff return by Kevin Faulk with 59 seconds to play.</TE>
<TE>   Faulk's runback provided a flicker of hope for the Patriots, who a
week earlier pulled off a 21-point comeback victory over Chicago. But
Oakland recovered the ensuing onside kick and ran out the clock. The
crowd of 62,552 roared its approval, and fans waved signs reading "It
was a fumble," a reference to Brady's apparent turnover in the
January playoff game.</TE>
<TE>   (Foxboro flashback: The Patriots were trailing, 13-10, with less
than two minutes left in regulation. They moved inside the Oakland
30, when a blitzing Charles Woodson hit Brady and jarred the ball
loose. Raider linebacker Greg Biekert recovered the would-be
turnover. But, after reviewing the play, officials cited the
little-known tuck rule, overturned the call and ruled it an
incomplete pass. The Patriots went on to win in overtime).</TE>
<TE>   There was no denying Brady fumbled once -- maybe even three times
-- in Sunday's rematch. The first came late in the second quarter,
when he was sacked at the New England nine by Chris Cooper, who also
raked the ball out of the quarterback's hand. Fellow defensive end
Trace Armstrong pounced on the fumble, and the Raiders scored less
than a minute later when Rich Gannon ran in from the two.</TE>
<TE>   Twice in the fourth quarter, it looked as if Brady might have
fumbled, but both plays were ruled incomplete passes -- and neither
was reviewed. The first came on first down at the Patriot eight, when
Armstrong hit him from behind as he was setting up to throw. On
replays, Brady's arm didn't appear to be moving forward before the
ball was knocked out of his hand.</TE>
<TE>   Later, on one of New England's two failed fourth-down attempts of
the fourth quarter, Brady dropped back and again was stripped by
Armstrong. Linebacker Bill Romanowski scooped up the ball and ran 40
yards into the end zone. That, too, was ruled an incomplete pass, and
replays seemed to bolster that call.</TE>
<TE>   "It sure looked like a fumble to me," Romanowski said.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, it was a rough night for Brady, the Super Bowl MVP who
grew up in the Bay Area and was making his first return home since
playing in the East-West Shrine Game at Stanford as a senior at
Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   Against the Raiders, he was 18 of 30 for 172 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "I think a lot of it was stuff we were doing wrong," said Brady,
who began the game by completing his first eight passes. "It comes
down to me getting the ball to the right guy and us being in the
right spot and blocking well. When you don't play well, you get
beat."</TE>
<TE>   Raider running back Zack Crockett scored twice on two-yard runs up
the middle.</TE>
<TE>   After each touchdown, Crockett worked the crowd into a lather by
striking a muscleman pose in the end zone. Call it an Oakland snow
angel.</TE>

<HD>Record Earns Smith Fewer Carries</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Emmitt Smith didn't see it coming.</LD>
<LD>   Smith knew that once he got the NFL career rushing record, his
backup Troy Hambrick would get more carries. The Dallas Cowboys were
playing out the string anyway and wanted to get Hambrick some reps.</LD>
<LD>   But after Dallas' 20-3 loss at Indianapolis on Sunday, Smith said
it was a surprise to him that he and Hambrick would alternate every
two series.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't ever recall a ballgame when I was just in for two series,
then out for two series," Smith said. "If this is what's going to
happen, then it's going to happen."</TE>
<TE>   Smith finished with 22 yards in eight carries, and he has only 61
yards in 24 carries since he broke Walter Payton's record on Oct. 27.</TE>
<TE>   Hambrick carried the ball seven times for 42 yards Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Smith was critical of the strategy using him and Hambrick in the
backfield, saying it was difficult for him to "find a rhythm."</TE>
<TE>   But since the Cowboys did reasonably well on the ground -- 18
carries for 84 yards, a 4.7 average -- Cowboy Coach Dave Campo said
afterward there was a "good chance" he would continue using his two
top running backs this way.</TE>
<TE>   What bothered Smith was that he was never informed that the game
plan had changed this week.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew he is going to get more carries; they didn't explain how
they were going to do it," Smith said. "Let's make a decision and
let's go with it."</TE>
<TE>   Smith spent most of the second half on the sideline. He didn't
play during the third quarter, when the Cowboys had only two
possessions, and carried twice in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Smith didn't believe the plan worked well at all.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw a lot of regression today. I did not see progress," he
said. "I thought we would be a much better offensive team than we
are."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The NFL has sent all 32 teams a memo warning that they are subject
to fines if they supply players -- knowingly or not -- with banned
supplements.</TE>
<TE>   The memo mentioned that a team already has been disciplined,
without saying which team.</TE>
<TE>   But a source within the league, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said that team is the Oakland Raiders. ESPN first reported
on the existence of the memo and that the Raiders were the team to
which it referred.</TE>
<TE>   NFL spokesman Greg Aiello confirmed the memo had been sent, but
would not comment on which team was disciplined.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Priest Holmes became the first Chiefs player to run for 1,000
yards in back-to-back seasons during the 17-16 win over Buffalo. He's
also the quickest to reach the 1,000-yard mark, with 1,012 yards in
10 games. It took Christian Okoye 11 games to do it in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes me feel real good," Holmes said. "I know my offensive
line will definitely get paid, and I love when those big guys get
those big paychecks, because those are the guys that never get the
glory that they deserve."</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Italian soccer received another black eye -- not to mention a
knockout blow -- Sunday when a couple of fans invaded the field
during Cagliari's home match against Messina and attacked Messina
goalkeeper Emanuele Manitta.</LD>
<LD>   One fan punched Manitta, knocking him senseless. The goalkeeper
was carried off the field and was reported in stable condition at a
local hospital.</LD>
<LD>   The Serie B game was abandoned with less than 10 minutes remaining
and Messina leading, 1-0. Police were questioning 10 Cagliari fans
and were examining video footage to identify the main culprit after
he fled back into the crowd.</LD>
<TE>   Cagliari club officials condemned the act but will probably be
fined by the league or federation.</TE>
<TE>   France Qualifies</TE>
<TE>   France became the eighth team to claim a place in the 16-nation
FIFA Women's World Cup in China next year when it defeated England,
1-0, in Saint-Etienne on a 54th-minute goal by its captain, Corinne
Diacre, in front of 24,000 at the Stade Geoffrey Guichard.</TE>
<TE>   The French had shut out England, 1-0, in the first game of the
two-match playoff in England, on a goal by Marinette Pichon, and
Saturday's victory assured "Les Bleus" of joining Canada, host China,
Germany, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the defending champion United
States in the Sept. 24-Oct. 11 world championship.</TE>
<TE>   Pumas Advance</TE>
<TE>   A hat trick by Uruguayan striker Rodrigo Lemos earned UNAM a 4-1
victory over Atlante in the Mexican league Sunday and qualified Pumas
for the eight-team playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Hugo Sanchez's team is the fourth team to secure its playoff
place, joining Toluca, Club America and Morelia.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Paraguayan striker Jose Cardozo of Toluca scored his
seventh goal in the last three games as Toluca beat San Luis, 3-1.</TE>
<TE>   Canada Qualifies</TE>
<TE>   Canada's under-20 national team scored three second-half goals to
defeat the United States, 3-2, at Charleston, S.C. on Sunday to
qualify for the FIFA World Youth Championship in the United Arab
Emirates in March.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S., which already had qualified, fell behind as Iain Hume
scored twice and Chris Lemire once during a 16-minute Canadian blitz.
The U.S. responded with goals from Frank Simek and Ed Johnson, but
Canada prevailed.</TE>
<TE>   Libyan Lazio?</TE>
<TE>   With Italian Serie A team Lazio of Rome on the brink of insolvency
because of its parent company's failure, the son of Libyan leader
Moammar Kadafi is considering a rescue bid.</TE>
<TE>   "The Libyan authority is evaluating a bid to buy the majority
share in Lazio," a spokesman for Al Saadi Kadafi said Sunday.</TE>

<LD>The Pittsburgh Steelers went home looking for answers, relieved that
quarterback Tommy Maddox could move his arms and legs Sunday after
being taken off the field in an ambulance.</LD>
<LD>   In a 31-23 loss to Tennessee, Maddox was tripped up by safety
Lance Schulters and tossed the ball to Antwaan Randle El as he fell
forward. Linebacker Keith Bulluck hit Maddox's shoulder with his
forearm, and Maddox rolled onto his head and did not move.</LD>
<LD>   Maddox had no sensations, but was conscious and talking as he was
strapped to a backboard. Trainers and doctors worked on him for at
least 15 minutes, then Maddox was lifted onto a stretcher, loaded
into an ambulance on the field and taken to Baptist Hospital's trauma
unit.</LD>
<TE>   Steeler spokesman Ron Wahl said they would not discuss the nature
of Maddox's injury until Monday. Wahl said Maddox was awake and
alert, had talked with his family and was able to move all of his
extremities.</TE>
<TE>   Maddox's injury overshadowed the best performance by the Titans in
nearly two seasons. Steve McNair threw two touchdown passes to Kevin
Dyson and Eddie George ran for two more as the Titans earned their
fifth victory in a row.</TE>
<TE>   "I told our club five weeks ago when we were 1-4 we're going to be
6-4 if we keep playing and believing in ourselves, and here we are,"
Titan Coach Jeff Fisher said.</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee ended a five-game unbeaten streak for the Steelers
(5-4-1) by making them look like the team that started the season
1-3.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody thought we could hang on with big, old, bad Pittsburgh,
but we expected to win and this is gratifying," Titan cornerback
Samari Rolle said.</TE>
<TE>   Maddox came in as the AFC's second-rated passer fresh off a
473-yard passing performance. He was heading up a Pittsburgh offense
averaging 374.3 yards a game.</TE>
<TE>   But the Steelers, who had scored at least 17 points by halftime
during their streak, never got going. Maddox was intercepted a
season-high three times before he was hurt on the final play of the
third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The Titans, tied for first place in the AFC South with
Indianapolis, had the game well in control before Maddox was hurt.</TE>
<TE>   They led, 14-7, at halftime and put the game away in the third
quarter, when they held the ball for more than 11 minutes and rolled
up 159 of their 378 yards. The defense held Pittsburgh to eight yards
and without a first down.</TE>
<TE>   Kordell Stewart, pulled for Maddox on Sept. 29 in a victory over
Cleveland, replaced Maddox on Sunday, but the Titans had padded their
lead to 31-7 with a 34-yard field goal by Joe Nedney.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart did throw for two touchdowns and two two-point conversions
and pulled the Steelers within 31-23 with 1:26 left. Pittsburgh's
chance at the improbable rally fell short when a gimmick on the
onside kick didn't fool the Titans. Drew Bennett recovered and the
Titans ran out the clock.</TE>

<HD>Sampras Weighs a Quit Decision</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If anything, Pete Sampras has become more conflicted than ever about
his tennis future since winning the U.S. Open in September.</LD>
<LD>   There has been no bolt of wisdom or inspiration, only his own
counsel.</LD>
<LD>   It sounds so simple when you hear athletes talking about retiring
on their own terms. Well, it's not.</LD>
<TE>   "There's a lot going on and I need to decide in the next couple of
weeks," Sampras said Friday in Costa Mesa, where he was appearing at
a function for a watch maker he endorses.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been in limbo for the last month, not avoiding it, but just
not sure. It's all coming to terms with stopping."</TE>
<TE>   His plan of playing for at least another year was pleasantly
disrupted by his U.S. Open victory against his biggest rival, Andre
Agassi.</TE>
<TE>   The 31-year-old Sampras is going to be a father for the first time
within a few weeks and wants to make a decision before then.</TE>
<TE>   Some days, he is leaning toward retirement.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had moments of wanting to continue and I've had moments of
stopping," he said. "It depends on what I'm doing at the time. Either
you do it all the way or you don't do it halfway."</TE>
<TE>   Contrary to popular perception, Wimbledon won't determine his
final decision. Sampras, a seven-time winner, went out in the second
round this year to lucky loser George Bastl.</TE>
<TE>   "I won't play just for one tournament. I'll play because I want
to, because I enjoy playing, and go through the process and the
challenges, not just for two weeks of the year.</TE>
<TE>   "In a romantic way, I would love to end it on a much better note
than I did this year."</TE>
<TE>   Award Time</TE>
<TE>   And now, the year-end awards. Sampras' U.S. Open victory, of
course, leads off as the most memorable final of 2002. It was his
first title since winning Wimbledon in 2000, and he called it the
"sweetest" of his 14 Grand Slam singles championships, considering
the circumstances and the opponent in the final, Agassi.</TE>
<TE>   Outerwear of the year: Serena Williams' black cat suit, which made
its debut at the U.S. Open.</TE>
<TE>   Underwear of the year: Jennifer Capriati's bra, which had its
coming-out party in a Manhattan club after she lost in the U.S. Open.</TE>
<TE>   Spat/brat: A petulant Capriati lost a lot of fans after a bitter
break with the Fed Cup team when captain Billie Jean King dismissed
her on the eve of a match against Austria.</TE>
<TE>   Legend's biggest fall: John McEnroe's ill-advised turn on the game
show "The Chair." The XFL lasted longer. Mac's venture actually makes
"Around the Horn" on ESPN look palatable in comparison.</TE>
<TE>   Vanishing act: Martina Hingis. The woman who won five Grand Slam
titles by 18 has all but disappeared from the tennis scene and the
side of golfer Sergio Garcia. The romance ended and there is a chance
her career has too. Hingis, who lost in the Australian Open final to
Capriati after squandering four match points in January, is said to
be contemplating retirement.</TE>
<TE>   One and done: Thomas Johansson and Albert Costa. Johansson won the
Australian Open and Costa took the French a few months later. In the
moments after Johansson beat Marat Safin, one television commentator
urged him to enjoy the Grand Slam win because it could be his last.
Neither player won another tournament in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Why women's tennis is better than men's tennis: Three Grand Slam
titles won by Williams. Three Grand Slam titles collectively won by
Johansson, Costa and Lleyton Hewitt. Now being advertised as a
sleep-inducing device -- Hewitt vs. David Nalbandian in the Wimbledon
final.</TE>
<TE>   Why men's tennis is better than women's tennis: Shanghai vs. Los
Angeles. There were an announced 10,200 fans at the season-ending WTA
Championships final between winner Kim Clijsters and Williams.
Reports out of Shanghai put the number at the men's Masters Cup final
between winner Hewitt and Juan Carlos Ferrero on Sunday at more than
9,000.</TE>
<TE>   But the men drew better earlier in their event than the women did
in theirs. And they acted as though they wanted to be in their
season-ending event, unlike most of the women. Of the 15 matches at
Staples Center, only three went to three sets. Three suggestions:
Bring on the round-robin format, lose the doubles and cut the singles
field to eight.</TE>
<TE>   (One thought -- if no one watched Justine Henin beat Elena
Dementieva in the first round, did it really happen?)</TE>
<TE>   Best comeback by someone not named Pete: Martina Navratilova
deciding to play singles on grass at Eastbourne, and winning her
first match. In her second, she nearly upset Daniela Hantuchova. Can
a Wimbledon singles return be in the works?</TE>
<TE>   Best match (and assist to Sampras): Agassi defeating Hewitt in a
four-set U.S. Open semifinal. For an early-season event, Hewitt's
three-set victory against Agassi in the San Jose final was
particularly compelling, considering it was Agassi's first event with
his new coach, Darren Cahill, who formerly worked with Hewitt.</TE>
<TE>   You Canas be serious: Guillermo Canas of Argentina played a series
of marathons at the French Open, including one big grudge match
against Hewitt in the fourth round, avenging his loss last year in
Paris. An angered Hewitt took a swipe at the courtside flowers.</TE>
<TE>   Jockey of the year: Anastasia Myskina of Russia on an "excitable"
horse in her GQ magazine debut.</TE>
<TE>   Classless act: Jan-Michael Gambill in meltdown mode during the
UCLA tournament, calling a Times columnist "a witch" because she
dared mention he was No. 53 in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Hoof-in-mouth disease: Who would have thought Greg Rusedski would
become such a big part of the U.S. Open after he lost? Sampras beat
Rusedski and Smilin' Greg gave him almost no chance to beat Tommy
Haas in the next round, declaring Sampras had lost a step and a half.
The rest, of course, is history.</TE>
<TE>   Best quote by Sampras: "His issues have issues," he said of
Rusedski. The Canadian-turned-Brit always seems to bring out the best
in Sampras. One well-circulated story had them practicing in Florida,
shortly after Sampras lost the No. 1 ranking.</TE>
<TE>   Rusedski asked him what it was like to be the No. 2 player.
Sampras was said to have shot back: "What's it like to be the No. 2
player in your country?"</TE>

<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>Kenny Brack used a pit stop under a yellow flag Sunday to win the
Mexico Grand Prix, getting his first victory of the year in the final
race of the Championship Auto Racing Teams season.</LD>
<LD>   Series champion Cristiano da Matta finished second while
pole-sitter Bruno Junqueira recovered from a bad start to finish
third.</LD>
<LD>   The victory put Brack in seventh place in the point standings.
Junqueira, Brack's Chip Ganassi teammate, earned $500,000 for
finishing second in the CART series.</LD>
<TE>   In the first major race in a decade in Mexico City, most drivers
pitted at the 53rd lap after a crash by Michael Andretti brought out
a yellow flag. Dario Franchitti had been leading, but he got caught
in a tangle of cars leaving the pits and Brack slipped out ahead.</TE>
<TE>   This was the final CART race for many of the drivers and teams.
The top three finishers in the race all drove cars powered by Toyota,
which is abandoning the CART series next year, as is Honda.
Ford-Cosworth will be the lone remaining engine maker.</TE>
<TE>   Brack most likely is headed to the Indy Racing League. Da Matta
will be driving for Toyota's Formula One team and Christian
Fittipaldi, who left the race on Lap 67 with mechanical problems, is
headed for NASCAR.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico's Michel Jourdain Jr., who did not pit under the yellow
flag, thrilled the crowd of more than 100,000 by leading until coming
in on Lap 61. He finished 13th. Team owner Bobby Rahal announced
before the race that Jourdain was signed for two more years.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Kanaan led the first 40 laps, but a bungled pit stop cost
him. Fuel sprayed and ignited as he pulled away and a crew member
inhaled flame. After a drive-through pit penalty, Kanaan dropped back
into the pack.</TE>
<TE>   There was a rough start to the 73-lap race. Paul Tracy bumped into
the back of Jimmy Vasser's car and veered off into a gravel trap,
putting him a lap back.</TE>
<TE>   Junqueira slipped off the course while veering around Kanaan on
the first lap and fell into ninth place.</TE>

<HD>Stewart Is NASCAR King</HD>
<DH>His 18th-place finish in the final Winston Cup event is
good enough to beat Martin and clinch his first stock car
championship.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HOMESTEAD, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Tony Stewart won the NASCAR Winston Cup championship Sunday with an
18th-place finish in the Ford 400. It wasn't the way the intense,
combative 31-year-old wanted to win his first stock car title, but he
got the job done.</LD>
<LD>   Kurt Busch, the hottest driver in the series, won the race for his
third victory in the last five events.</LD>
<LD>   Stewart came into the race knowing he needed only to finish 22nd
or better to beat Mark Martin in their championship duel. Martin gave
it a game try, finishing fourth but coming up 38 points short.</LD>
<TE>   "Unbelievable!" Stewart said as he got out of his car and thrust
his arms skyward. "We never gave up. I'm really happy. This team
deserves this."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart, who has undergone anger management sessions for his fiery
temper that has led to fines and probation, then hugged his crew
chief, Greg Zipadelli.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a tough year, it's been up and down," Zipadelli said. "It
was worth it."</TE>
<TE>   Joe Gibbs, the former coach of the Washington Redskins, added
Stewart's championship to the one earned by Stewart's teammate, Bobby
Labonte, in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Martin said Saturday he would need a miracle to catch Stewart, who
came into the race leading by 89 points. He didn't get it.</TE>
<TE>   "Those guys were just a little bit stronger than us, but what an
effort," said Martin, 43, now a four-time series runner-up and never
a champion. "The only regret I have is that I could have provided
more leadership to this team so we could have scored an extra 100 or
150 this year somewhere along the line -- but we didn't and I
couldn't."</TE>
<TE>   Martin was docked 25 points after NASCAR discovered an unapproved
spring on his Roush Racing Ford on Nov. 3 in Rockingham, N.C., or the
final difference would have been even closer. An appeal of the
penalty was turned down Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "We made it close," Martin said. "We gained points on the guy
three races in a row so, in a way, I wish it wasn't over. I'm as
proud of that as anything we did all year long."</TE>
<TE>   His car owner, Jack Roush, said Gibbs' team "had the best program
all year and they deserve the championship."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart, who had won two of three previous races on the 1 1/2-mile
oval, started sixth but never contended in this one, driving a
conservative race that saw him fall a lap down on lap 192 of the
267-lap event.</TE>
<TE>   He hung in and got the lap back in the late going, moving onto the
tail of the lead lap by passing then-leader Dale Jarrett on Lap 205.
He was able to stay ahead of the lead pack and, with the help of a
yellow flag on Lap 227, remained on the lead lap to the end.</TE>
<TE>   "We've always ran so good here. That's why it was such a surprise
when the car went off like it did," Stewart said. "Luckily, Zippy did
some aggressive changes to fix the thing. We got in the front of the
pack again and were able to race the guys in the lead lap ahead of
us.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't a piece of cake by any means."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart, NASCAR's rookie of the year in 1999, last won a
championship in 1997 in the Indy Racing League.</TE>
<TE>   Busch, who started from the pole, finished the season on a roll,
charging from 12th to third in the points over the last eight races.
The 24-year-old driver, completing his second season, finished 159
points behind Stewart.</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Ryan Newman gambled and stayed on track during a caution
period late in the race as all the other leaders pitted. Busch came
out fourth, also trailing rookie Jimmie Johnson and four-time series
champion Jeff Gordon.</TE>
<TE>   Busch made it to second place before John Andretti's blown engine
brought out the last caution on Lap 237. He put continuous pressure
on Newman after the green flag waved on Lap 245, finally taking the
lead on Lap 257 and pulling away to the fourth win of his career, all
this season.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Nemechek finished second, followed by Jeff Burton, Martin,
Gordon, Newman, Bill Elliott and Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart finished fourth in the points as a rookie, sixth the next
year, and a distant second to Gordon a year ago. Considered a
favorite this season, he got off to a disastrous start, blowing an
engine and finishing last in the Daytona 500.</TE>
<TE>   It took until the second half of the season for Stewart to get
hot. As other leaders stumbled in front of him, he moved to the top
on Oct. 6 in Talladega -- the 30th race of the 36-race season -- and
stayed there.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart spent much of 2002 under a cloud as his temper got him in
off-track trouble. After punching a photographer in August in
Indianapolis, NASCAR put Stewart on probation, and that's the way he
finished the year.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart, who wiped away tears and mopped his face with a towel
before climbing from his car, admittedly does not like dealing with
the media and mobs of fans.</TE>
<TE>   He has repeatedly said he doesn't believe the champion should have
any more responsibility or have to be an ambassador for the sport.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if I'm qualified to be a leader of this sport. Guys
like Richard Petty and Dale Earnhardt are what made this sport what
it is," the Indiana native said when he accepted the trophy.</TE>
<TE>   "All we can do is the best we can. The greatest thing was coming
down pit lane and seeing my peers from different teams. They're what
make the series what it is. I'm not going to change anything. I'm not
the leader of this sport."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson finished fifth in the points and Newman finished sixth,
but Newman was named the top rookie following the race. He finished
the year with one win and 22 top-10 finishes, while Johnson won three
times and had 20 top-10s.</TE>

<HD>Houses Divided, and Two Teams United</HD>
<DH>Family matters less than school loyalties this week, in
Ebell home and many others. Like the city itself, Bruin tailback and
his sister are on opposite sides.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Line up, kids. Recess is over. Time to get serious.</LD>
<LD>   Even if it means Tyler Ebell and his sister must tussle.</LD>
<LD>   UCLA players thoroughly enjoyed their bye week, going on a team
paint ball excursion, switching jerseys at practice and cutting back
on meetings.</LD>
<TE>   Now the Bruins must strip away distractions, make every minute
count and thoroughly prepare for their biggest game of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Even if it means Ebell and his sister must tussle.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruin tailback squirmed through a family photo session Sunday.
Jennifer wore a T-shirt that read, "I love SC."</TE>
<TE>   "I told her that if she wore it, I wouldn't get in the picture,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   He relented, not her.</TE>
<TE>   But he did counter by wearing a UCLA T-shirt.</TE>
<TE>   "Got to represent my school," he said, "even if she has to
represent hers."</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer is a USC senior and a friend of several Trojan players.
She and her brother have always been close, and will continue to be
-- 51 weeks of the year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a family rivalry, and there is a lot of smack talk in
our house," said their mother, Karen Hewlett. "Jen cheers for her
brother but is a true Trojan fan. Tyler has made a lot of friends at
USC through his sister."</TE>
<TE>   This week he won't admit to that.</TE>
<TE>   Ebell, a redshirt freshman, has been true blue and gold since
moments before he made a phone call to Jennifer in February 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "She was the first person I called when I committed to UCLA," he
said. "She wanted me to go to USC and she was kind of mad."</TE>
<TE>   Every year this rivalry causes fissures in families, even when it
is mostly in fun. Tyler and Jennifer are a microcosm of a divided
city.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach Poly, the top high school football program in the
Southland, sends players to both schools. A year ago, Marcedes Lewis,
Winston Justice and Hershel Dennis were teammates.</TE>
<TE>   Now Lewis is a UCLA tight end. Justice, an offensive lineman, and
Dennis, a running back, are Trojans.</TE>
<TE>   "We've known this day was going to come," Lewis said.</TE>
<TE>   The wait is beginning to wear on UCLA. The players are getting
antsy.</TE>
<TE>   "Time off was good for everybody," quarterback Matt Moore said.
"We'll pick up the pace [this week]. We are anxious."</TE>
<TE>   An open date can be a bane as easily as a balm.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, injuries have time to heal. Batteries recharge. Everybody
needs a break once in a while.</TE>
<TE>   But the momentum the Bruins (7-3, 4-2) gained in winning three
Pacific 10 Conference games in a row is felt less acutely than in the
afterglow of the 37-7 victory over Arizona on Nov. 9.</TE>
<TE>   Intensity can't be turned off and on like a light switch, can it?</TE>
<TE>   "It is a concern, but I'm not too worried about it," Coach Bob
Toledo said. "Everybody knows what this game means."</TE>
<TE>   Toledo knows how to pace a team through a bye week -- the Bruins
are 6-0 in home games after open dates in his tenure.</TE>
<TE>   The secret, he believes, is to avoid whipping the players into an
emotional frenzy too soon. USC film was kept to a minimum last week
and USC references were not posted in the locker room.</TE>
<TE>   "If guys get fired up too soon, they end up getting burned out,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   This week, though, the stops are pulled out on all forms of
motivation. Expect former players to make impassioned locker-room
speeches. Any comment that can be construed as a lack of respect will
be copied and placed in lockers.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't beat USC, that's a big thing to me," senior Marcus
Reese said.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins have lost three in a row to the Trojans, a 17-7 yawner
in 1999, a 38-35 nail-biter in 2000 and a 27-0 debacle last season
that marked a low point under Toledo.</TE>
<TE>   Two driving-under-the-influence convictions that quarterback Cory
Paus tried to conceal came to light two days before the game.
Tailback DeShaun Foster was suspended for an NCAA violation and did
not play.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, it's not a stretch to say that few Bruins came to play.
The game left such a sour taste that Toledo refuses to discuss it.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to talk about last year's game," he said. "The past
is the past. I'm looking forward to this game."</TE>
<TE>   Toledo won his first three games against USC before the tide
turned in 1999. This is something of a rubber match. For him it is
Game 7 of a series that has no end date in sight.</TE>
<TE>   There is heightened interest, and there are conflicting agendas,
especially in families with allegiances to both schools.</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Ebell will root for USC. That's to be expected. But she
also bet a friend that Tyler will rush for 100 yards.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Tyler will avoid contact with Jennifer's friends
with the same determination he will avoid contact with Trojan
defenders Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   He's already learned that cross-town civility is forgotten this
week.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Wraps Up Year With a Win</HD>
<DH>The men's national team beats El Salvador, 2-0, as
attention turns toward 2006 World Cup in Germany.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Grahame L. Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The United States men's national soccer team ended its most
successful year ever with a 2-0 victory over El Salvador on Sunday in
front of 13,590 rain-soaked fans at RFK Stadium in Washington.</LD>
<LD>   A headed goal by winger Ben Olsen in the 31st minute and a neat
finish by the Galaxy's Sasha Victorine off a Clint Mathis pass in the
60th minute were enough to give Coach Bruce Arena's squad a final
mark of 12-6-2 for 2002.</LD>
<LD>   It was a year in which the U.S. won the CONCACAF Gold Cup and
reached the quarterfinals of the Korea/Japan '02 World Cup.</LD>
<TE>   Arena, who fielded an all-Major League Soccer lineup featuring
four players making their national team debut, was more interested in
the future than the past, however.</TE>
<TE>   "The last couple of months, we've received a lot of praise, and
I'm grateful for all that," he said. "But enough already. We've had
our congratulatory tour, and now we just want to get on with the
business of starting all over again."</TE>
<TE>   The El Salvador match marked that new beginning, the first step on
the road to the Germany 2006 World Cup, and it was a positive one.</TE>
<TE>   Victorine, in only his second game for the U.S., looked quite
comfortable at right back, despite having never played the position
before. Equally impressive was the San Jose Earthquakes' Wade
Barrett, the starter at left back.</TE>
<TE>   Catching the eye in particular, however, was Olsen, who was
sidelined for 16 months with a succession of ankle and foot injuries
and missed the World Cup as a result. His nonstop work on the left
wing was rewarded with an excellent goal off a Chris Klein cross.</TE>
<TE>   For El Salvador, only two players stood out: goalkeeper Juan
Gomez, who made two superb saves off blazing shots by Mathis, and
midfielder Rudi Corrales, whose tireless running and invention kept
the U.S. defense busy.</TE>

<DH>With stakes in cross-town battle considerably higher this
year, Trojans say maintaining level of last five weeks won't be
enough to beat Bruins.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Big-game week couldn't have arrived at a better time for USC.</LD>
<LD>   Starting today, the Trojans will begin preparation for their
annual showdown with UCLA, a cross-town rivalry that in recent
seasons hasn't counted for much more than bragging rights.</LD>
<LD>   The stakes will be considerably higher for Saturday's game at the
Rose Bowl, and USC is looking forward to the challenge after posting
five consecutive victories over a ho-hum group of opponents that have
a combined Pacific 10 Conference record of 14-21.</LD>
<TE>   You could almost feel the lethargy in the Coliseum on Saturday as
the Trojans methodically dismantled Arizona State, 34-13.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Pete Carroll alluded to his team's efficiency after the
game, saying, "We haven't had to do anything extraordinary so far;
we've been able to stay within our system and still get it done."</TE>
<TE>   USC safety Troy Polamalu fully expects UCLA to stretch the
Trojans' capabilities in a game that has bowl implications for both
teams.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely the biggest game of our lives," the senior said.
"They're winning, we're winning."</TE>
<TE>   A victory would keep seventh-ranked USC in contention for a bowl
championship series bowl and set up a grand finale to the regular
season Nov. 30 against No. 8 Notre Dame at a sold-out Coliseum. A
loss could knock the Trojans into the Sun Bowl, the third-tier bowl
game awarded the Pac-10, if UCLA upsets first-place Washington State
on Dec. 7.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll said he doesn't have anything special planned for the No.
25 Bruins.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to remain focused," he said. "I'll address [the rivalry]
for what it is, but we'll do the same things we've done all year and
keep to our routine."</TE>
<TE>   The most intriguing matchup will pit USC's conference-leading
defense, which hasn't allowed a 100-yard rusher this season, against
a UCLA offense that features a physical line and shifty tailback
Tyler Ebell, a redshirt freshman who has rushed for more than 100
yards in six consecutive games.</TE>
<TE>   Polamalu said he wasn't aware of Ebell's streak, but he welcomes
the opportunity for USC to end it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a huge challenge, and we love challenges," Polamalu said.
"Our defense prides itself on that."</TE>
<TE>   Though USC did a commendable job in limiting Arizona State to one
touchdown, Polamalu said the Trojans would need a better effort
against UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   "We made a lot of pass-coverage mistakes -- I know I did -- and
I'm sure the offense made a few mistakes too," he said. "We need to
be at our best Saturday."</TE>
<TE>   Polamalu was critical of a breakdown in the secondary that allowed
Arizona State to score a touchdown on a 24-yard pass from Andrew
Walter to Shaun McDonald with 31 seconds left in the first half. He
said the Trojans were fortunate not to give up a touchdown in the
third quarter, when the Sun Devils continually had the USC defense on
its heels.</TE>
<TE>   "But we kept coming back, we kept battling," Polamalu said. "We
were backed up in the second half for about three or four drives in a
row. There's a lot of mistakes we can learn from that we can't make
against UCLA."</TE>
<TE>   USC also causes mistakes, particularly against inexperienced
quarterbacks.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans made life miserable for senior Robert Hodge, who was
making his first start, in a 40-3 victory over Colorado. They
battered sophomore Derek Anderson in a 22-0 shutout of Oregon State.</TE>
<TE>   They contained redshirt freshman Kyle Matter in a 49-17 victory
over Stanford. And they thoroughly frustrated Walter, a sophomore who
set a Pac-10 record by passing for 536 yards against Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   Walter was limited to 24-of-49 passing for 297 yards, with two
interceptions and a lost fumble, by a Trojan defense that blitzed and
switched pass coverages.</TE>
<TE>   "They have a great coach," Walter said of Carroll, the architect
of the USC defense. "They played hard and put pressure on me at times
and I was forced into some questionable throws."</TE>
<TE>   Look for the Trojans to employ a similar strategy against UCLA's
two freshman quarterbacks, Drew Olson and Matt Moore. The Bruins
haven't needed Olson and Moore to do anything spectacular since
senior Cory Paus suffered a season-ending broken ankle Oct. 19, but
their responsibilities probably will increase this week.</TE>
<TE>   Though USC has won the last three meetings with UCLA, senior
linebacker Mike Pollard says the Trojans still have something to
prove this season.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to prove to people that we're pretty good," he said.
"We haven't convinced all the people yet, but with each game we
hopefully get a few more people to hop on the bandwagon."</TE>

<LD>USC vs. UCLA</LD>
<LD>   Saturday 12:30 pm.</LD>
<LD>   At Rose Bowl</LD>
<TE>   Channel 7</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC puts several streaks on the line Saturday against rival UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   The seventh-ranked Trojans are coming off a victory over Arizona
State that extended their winning streak to five games. They also
have defeated the Bruins three times in a row, including a 27-0
victory last season at the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   USC's defense intends to continue another impressive streak: No
running back has rushed for 100 yards against the Trojans.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado's Chris Brown, who entered the weekend as the nation's
leading rusher, gained 44 yards in 14 carries against USC. Oregon
State's Steven Jackson, the Pacific 10 Conference's leading rusher,
managed only 67 yards in 15 carries, and Oregon's Onterrio Smith was
held to 79 yards in 19 carries by a Trojan defense that is allowing
only 88.3 yards rushing a game.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA's Tyler Ebell, however, presents USC with perhaps its
toughest test of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Ebell, the 5-foot-9, 170-pound redshirt freshman from Ventura, has
rushed for 100 yards or more in six consecutive games for the No. 25
Bruins. Last week against Arizona, Ebell gained 124 yards in 22
carries and scored two touchdowns as UCLA stayed in contention for a
Rose Bowl berth.</TE>
<TE>   Ebell has rushed for 858 yards this season.</TE>
<TE>   "He's really quick and really shifty," USC Coach Pete Carroll
said. "He bounces off tackles and leaves guys standing in a hole."</TE>
<TE>   Despite his size, Ebell runs mainly between the tackles rather
than around the ends.</TE>
<TE>   He is especially productive just past the line of scrimmage and
produces numerous mid-range gains. Ebell, however, has not shown
breakaway speed that would make him a home run threat every time he
touches the ball.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas State's Darren Sproules is the most similar back USC has
faced. Sproules -- 5-7, 170 pounds -- gained 78 yards in 20 carries
in Kansas State's 27-20 victory over the Trojans.</TE>
<TE>   Ebell, said USC defensive tackle Bernard Riley, "is small, so he's
going to try and disappear behind those huge linemen. We're so strong
and so big up front, we have to swallow him up."</TE>
<TE>   Ebell's height, or lack of it, presents larger defenders with a
limited target area. Would-be tacklers cannot achieve ideal angles to
knock down a player who identifies with the cartoon character Mighty
Mouse.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to really watch his hips," USC safety DeShaun Hill said.
"With a bigger back, you can get a better shot. It's tougher because
he's so little."</TE>
<TE>   Ebell's best attributes might be his toughness and ability to hold
onto the ball. During his senior season at Ventura High in 2000, he
fumbled once in 401 carries while rushing for a national-record 4,495
yards. He has not fumbled in 188 carries for UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Ebell also figures to benefit from the presence of 6-3, 243-pound
fullback Manuel White, who returned from a hamstring injury against
Arizona and should be even stronger after the Bruins' week off.</TE>
<TE>   USC respects Ebell's ability, but is confident it can keep its
streak intact.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody can get 100 yards against us," Trojan defensive end
Kenechi Udeze said. "We're one of the best defensive lines in the
country and we have to keep it going. With a good week of
preparation, we'll be ready."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No Big Rush ...</TE>
<TE>   USC has not allowed a player to rush for more than 100 yards in a
game this season. A look at each opponent's rushing yards and leading
rusher:</TE>

<TE>   Braxton Cleman 8 carries for 12 yards</TE>
<TE>   GAME 8: USC 44, Oregon 33</TE>
<TE>   Oregon: 27 carries for 76 yards</TE>
<TE>   Onterrio Smith 19 carries for 79 yards</TE>
<TE>   GAME 9: USC 49, Stanford 17</TE>
<TE>   Stanford: 40 carries for 78 yards</TE>
<TE>   Kerry Carter 18 carries for 74 yards</TE>
<TE>   GAME 10: USC 34, Arizona State 13</TE>
<TE>   Arizona State: 21 carries for 27 yards</TE>
<TE>   Mike Williams 10 carries for 33 yards</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ... At Least Not Yet</TE>
<TE>   Against Arizona, UCLA running back Tyler Ebell became the second
player in school history to rush for over 100 yards in six
consecutive games during the same season. He is averaging 4.6 yards
per carry (858 yards in 188 carries). A look:</TE>
<TE>   UCLA 43, Oregon State 35: 29 carries for 203 yards</TE>
<TE>   Oregon 31, UCLA 30: 26 carries for 119 yards</TE>
<TE>   California 17, UCLA 12: 28 carries for 102 yards</TE>
<TE>   UCLA 28, Stanford 18: 39 carries for 160 yards</TE>
<TE>   UCLA 34, Washington 24: 31 carries for 102 yards</TE>
<TE>   UCLA 37, Arizona 7: 22 carries for 124 yards</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Playing at the Metrodome never seems to work out well for the Green
Bay Packers.</LD>
<LD>   Not even with the league's best record. Not even against the worst
Minnesota Viking team in nearly two decades.</LD>
<LD>   Daunte Culpepper threw for two touchdowns and ran for another one,
and the Vikings intercepted Brett Favre three times Sunday in a 31-21
victory.</LD>
<TE>   "At some point before I retire," Favre said, "I'd like to get
another win in here."</TE>
<TE>   The Packers (8-2) have lost nine of 11 at the Metrodome and missed
a chance to clinch a division title at the earliest stage of a
16-game season.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota's 31st-ranked defense held Ahman Green to 71 yards and
kept Favre -- who was 24 for 42 for 296 yards and two touchdowns --
out of rhythm in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   After Vikings (3-7) took a 24-21 lead on Gary Anderson's 32-yard
field goal with 7:16 left, the Packers went three-and-out on their
next two possessions.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to keep people in his face and keep the pressure on him,"
Viking defensive end Kenny Mixon said of Favre. "If we don't get a
sack, but we get an interception, we'll take it."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Bennett's 62-yard run just before the two-minute warning
in the fourth quarter set up a three-yard touchdown run by Moe
Williams -- his 10th of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Bennett finished with 130 yards in 20 carries -- his fourth
consecutive 100-yard game.</TE>
<TE>   Randy Moss was also productive with six receptions for 115 yards
and a touchdown for the Vikings. Culpepper was 13 for 26 for 217
yards, though he did add three more turnovers to his league-high
total of 22.</TE>
<TE>   But after being benched in favor of Todd Bouman for the fourth
quarter last week, he responded with several completions and
sack-avoiding scrambles in critical situations.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like I can make a lot of plays in this league for a long
time," said Culpepper, in his third season as a starter.</TE>
<TE>   "I just have to play like myself."</TE>
