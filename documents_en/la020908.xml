<DH>STATE OF THE UNION: A Century of American Labor, By Nelson
Lichtenstein, Princeton University Press: 298 pp., $26.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY ARONOWITZ</AU>
<BD>Stanley Aronowitz is author of the forthcoming "How
Class Works," which will be published by Yale University Press in
spring. He is the Green Party candidate for governor of New York.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the face of the Bush administration's threats to impose sanctions
against West Coast dockworkers under Taft-Hartley and the Patriot Act
provision, the International Longshore and Warehouse Union is
prepared to mount a coast-wide strike against stevedoring companies
that are demanding steep concessions from workers.</LD>
<LD>   The union will most likely defy the president and close the ports,
an action profoundly reminiscent of the strike by the United
Mineworkers, under the leadership of John L. Lewis, who in 1943
stopped digging for coal. Lewis drew jail time, and maybe James
Spinosa, the ILWU president, will too.</LD>
<LD>   In the aftermath of the organizing campaigns that brought millions
of industrial workers into American unions during the Great
Depression and World War II, sociologist C. Wright Mills announced
that labor leaders had become "new men of power." During World War
II, Sidney Hillman, president of what was then called the Amalgamated
Clothing Workers of America, was one of the most powerful figures in
the Roosevelt administration. The Democratic Party prospered on the
basis of labor's vote and, most important, unions established what
became known as the American standard of living which, among other
benefits, brought to workers a level of consumption of goods and
services previously unknown in American history.</LD>
<TE>   But by the 1960s, union power had begun its long slide. In 1953,
one of three workers in private sector enterprises were in unions;
today only one in 10 working in private firms belongs to a union.
Except for the dramatic rise of public employees' unionism, organized
labor has lost so much ground that many economists believe unionism
is fated to return to the margins.</TE>
<TE>   In "State of the Union," a richly documented and well-written
book, Nelson Lichtenstein, who teaches history at UC Santa Barbara,
traces the rise and decline of American labor, primarily since the
Great Depression. He begins the story with the New Deal's struggle to
overcome the economic crises of the time. From 1934 to 1936, workers
conducted general strikes in Minneapolis and San Francisco, a
national textile strike and sit-down strikes (factory occupations) in
Cleveland and in the Akron, Ohio, rubber industry. In fact, the
famous General Motors sit-down strike occurred before the New Deal
Congress passed the National Labor Relations Act in 1935, which
established a series of procedures to determine whether a union had
the right to represent a particular group of workers and barred
so-called "company" unions because they were controlled by the
employer.</TE>
<TE>   Without the benefit of legal protections, workers had to resort to
militant action to gain a foothold in the American workplace. But
following the conventional wisdom, Lichtenstein believes unions were
able to overcome stubborn employer resistance to independent labor
organizations only when the government stepped in to protect their
rights. Lichtenstein holds that during the 1930s, unions looked to
the state for solutions to their problems and that this dependence on
government action was desirable and necessary.</TE>
<TE>   He does not consider the argument that the National Labor
Relations Act was a response to significant evidence that--working
outside the New Deal framework--union organizers, including many
communists and socialists, secured the right of workers to form
"unions of their own choosing," free of management interference and
manipulation.</TE>
<TE>   But organizing workers in America's largest corporations meant
that the most impressive aspect of labor's struggle for recognition
was that it challenged management's unilateral right to control the
shop floor. The unionization victories were first steps in labor's
quest for full citizenship beyond the right to vote. Lichtenstein
argues that unions sought to establish a new "industrial democracy,"
which acknowledged the worker's voice in all aspects of production
and corporate functions.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, in the first decade of labor's insurgency, unions
demanded, and won, the ability to contest workloads, have a say in
the introduction of new technologies and prevent management from
firing activists and other workers without cause. Union power grew
through World War II: Its ranks swelled by more than 4 million
members, largely because of the labor movement's ability to pressure
the Roosevelt administration to bring such longtime anti-union
companies as Ford Motor Co. and the so-called little steel producers
into line.</TE>
<TE>   But management staged a post-war counterattack. Over President
Harry Truman's veto, a newly elected conservative congress passed the
1947 Taft-Hartley amendments to the National Labor Relations Act.
Taft-Hartley barred Communists from holding union office; banned the
so-called secondary boycott, which permitted such unions as the
Teamsters to assist strikes by refusing to bring trucks across picket
lines; mandated an 80-day "cooling-off period" when the federal
government believed a strike might hurt the national interest; and
reinstated the employer's right to seek a court injunction to limit
picketing.</TE>
<TE>   Mineworkers' Lewis called the amendments a "slave labor" act, but
Lichtenstein believes labor was already too weak and compromised to
win repeal. Labor was compromised by an internal struggle within the
Congress of Industrial Organizations between the communists and
anti-communists over whether to support the Cold War aims of the
United States government. But the real explanation of organized
labor's failure to mount a major campaign for repeal of Taft-Hartley
is that unions were well on the way to becoming junior partners to
the largest corporations and to the bipartisan U.S. foreign policy.</TE>
<TE>   Union weakness after 1947 has dominated most of the discussion of
postwar labor and industrial relations. But in the high point of his
analysis, Lichtenstein insists that collective bargaining--through
which unions and management compromise to attain labor peace and by
which unions sought a "private" welfare state--tended to blunt
organized labor's political will. The unions were unable to attain
such universal gains as a government-run single-payer health plan and
they abandoned any effort to emulate European practices of national
wage and benefits negotiations. When unions negotiated pensions and
health care through the contract rather than through law and always
with a single firm, they conceded that these benefits would not
become universal.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, inequality sprung up among the country's workers. The
labor relations system helped depoliticize the membership by making
unionists company-oriented; rather than retaining their character as
elements in a social movement, progressive unions like the United
Auto Workers became more service organizations than instruments of
social change.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the best sections of "State of the Union" are those
showing how these practices resulted in unions becoming bulwarks
against race and gender equality. Many blacks found jobs in unionized
and urban industrial plants until the mid-1950s. But migration of
blacks from the rural South, and Latinos from Puerto Rico and Mexico,
occurred precisely as these cities were losing their industrial
plants in the 1950s and '60s, depriving many people of color of
well-paying jobs. Because labor agreements provided, in part, job
security for employees with the greatest length of service, blacks,
who entered industrial plants during the war, gradually found
themselves standing on unemployment lines or accepting low-wage jobs
in the mostly nonunion service sector. The CIO had tried to organize
Southern textile and garment workers in the late 1940s to close the
regional wage gap, but its failure, owing in great measure to its
refusal to address the race question, was followed by a mass
southward exodus of Northern and Western industrial plants to rural
areas in the South.</TE>
<TE>   Although the AFL-CIO--which was formed in 1955 by the two
competing federations, the American Federation of Labor and the
CIO--consistently supported civil rights legislation, the seniority
system effectively excluded racial minorities and women from the best
and most secure jobs. But Lichtenstein shows that unions were often
unsympathetic to the efforts of women to overturn legislation that
excluded them from some occupations. As a result of their union
leadership's narrowing focus on contract protections of a largely
white, male membership, unions by the 1960s found themselves
separated from burgeoning social movements that demanded
opportunities for good jobs and education.</TE>
<TE>   The civil rights movement supported President Richard Nixon's
affirmative-action programs, which sought to reserve places in
employment and education for minorities and women. Lichtenstein
cautiously supports Nixon's individualized focus on "rights
consciousness" instituted by federal and state anti-discrimination
statutes which addressed employment discrimination on a case-by-case
basis. But he astutely points out that these statutes undermined
labor's traditional appeal to solidarity and collective action to
achieve social justice.</TE>
<TE>   But these insights are episodes in a book that ascribes labor's
decline to the economic and political obstacles it has faced since
the New Deal. In the end, Lichtenstein believes that the labor
movement needs not only its own strength but a new New Deal to
reverse its fortunes. In a time when such an eventuality seems
remote, his solutions amount to hollowly urging, "Let us go forth."</TE>
<TE>   Asking the traditional question, "What is to be done?" in his
concluding chapter, Lichtenstein recommends the return of labor to
its 1930s roots: militancy, democracy and political independence. In
this era of the relentless and largely successful corporate offensive
against workers' living standards and the social wage, and the
roaring return of labor's economic and political subordination at the
workplace and the ballot box, this bromide seems implausible.</TE>
<TE>   Far from political independence, even as the Democratic Party
lunges to the right, the AFL-CIO continues to put tens of millions of
dollars into the party's coffers, and some, like the Teamsters,
cuddle up to the Republicans. With few exceptions, labor has
abandoned the brave start the AFL-CIO made, in 1995, under its new
president, John Sweeney, to focus on organizing the unorganized.
Strike activity is at an all-time low because the membership views
its unions as insurance companies rather than a social movement. And
most labor leaders don't care about democracy, in terms of involving
rank and file union members in policy.</TE>
<TE>   Lichtenstein knows this. He mentions, briefly, the most successful
among the reform movements: Teamsters for a Democratic Union, which
has waged a two-decade fight to democratize the union and to restore
its militancy. Teamsters for a Democratic Union spearheaded the
election of insurgent Ron Carey who became union president and
defeated a crime-ridden leadership. But there is no discussion of the
many recent attempts at union reform because Lichtenstein, in concert
with some labor intellectuals, has cast his lot with the progressive
wing of AFL-CIO leadership. On this commitment he can't bring himself
to ally with the actual and imagined insurgencies, without which
labor's fate is sealed. For in the end, like many labor
intellectuals, Lichtenstein is out of touch with the rank and file
and cannot imagine an alternative that stems from the grass roots of
the labor movement.</TE>
<TE>   Needless to say, in the labor movement, there are always
conflicting signs, and West Coast unions may provide a ray of hope.
The AFL-CIO's Los Angeles campaign to organize hundreds of thousands
of low-wage service and manufacturing workers was capped two years
ago when the Service Employees Union brought 74,000 home-health-care
workers into its ranks. And the Union of Needle Trades, Industrial
and Textile Employees has registered some important gains in the
area's garment shops. These successes, in light of the action
simmering among the dockworkers on the West Coast, clearly mark the
difference between a movement and a staid institution.</TE>

<HD>Closing the Confidence Gap</HD>
<DH>ALL GIRLS: Single-Sex Education and Why It Matters, By
Karen Stabiner, Riverhead Books: 329 pp., $25.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLARA BINGHAM</AU>
<BD>Clara Bingham is the coauthor, most recently, of "Class
Action: The Story of Lois Jenson and the Landmark Case That Changed
Sexual Harassment Law." She is a graduate of the Brearley School in
New York City.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the 1990s, a slew of new studies showed that adolescent girls were
in crisis. Something strange happened to girls when they reached
their teens. They went from having confidence and good grades to
becoming silent, self-doubting, subpar students. One of the popular
theories at the time was that teachers inadvertently favored boys in
the classroom. Some parents responded by sending their daughters to
all-girls' schools.</LD>
<LD>   By the mid-1990s, the same schools that only 15 years earlier had
been dismissed as "finishing schools" found their admissions offices
overflowing with applications. Girls' schools were in vogue, no
longer the domain of young ladies whose parents could afford to keep
them out of trouble--that is, away from boys at the local public coed
high school. They appealed not just to the daughters of the Junior
League but also to daughters of feminists. Student populations at
these schools became more ethnically and economically diverse, as
well as academically competitive.</LD>
<TE>   The idea that girls were being unfairly treated derived from the
American Assn. of University Women's 1991 report, "Shortchanging
Girls, Shortchanging America," which warned that girls were being
ignored in the classroom and suffered from something called the
"confidence gap." In adolescence, the report said, a confluence of
events occurred in girls: Their science and math scores dropped
precipitously, they felt critical of their changing bodies and they
were overwhelmed by a sense of personal inadequacy.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, Peggy Orenstein's book, "Schoolgirls: Young Women,
Self-Esteem, and the Confidence Gap," studied two coed eighth-grade
classrooms, which supported the conclusions of the 1991 report. That
same year, psychologist Mary Pipher's "Reviving Ophelia: Saving the
Selves of Adolescent Girls" poignantly described the identity crisis
that girls endured when they changed from resilient, assertive
tomboys, to deferential, self-critical, depressed teenagers.</TE>
<TE>   Karen Stabiner, a freelance journalist and author of "To Dance
With the Devil: The New War on Breast Cancer," contributes to the
growing literature on girls with "All Girls: Single-Sex Education and
Why It Matters," an absorbing inside look at two all-girls' schools:
Marlborough, a century-old prep school in Los Angeles, and the Young
Women's Leadership School of East Harlem, an experimental public
school.</TE>
<TE>   "All Girls" divides its well-written narrative between Marlborough
and the Young Women's Leadership School. Stabiner spent the 1998-99
school year at the schools, observing, talking to students, teachers
and parents. The author confesses that she started her year of
reporting with the old-fashioned bias. "I had carried around a rather
musty, fussy, and completely uninformed image of what a girls' school
must be; the sort of place where a child of privilege learned how to
crook her little finger while she drank tea." By the end of that
year, however, she had enrolled her own daughter at Marlborough.</TE>
<TE>   Both schools, Stabiner discovers, are "vanity-free zones" where
girls can spend seven boy-free hours a day, wearing uniforms instead
of the latest spaghetti-strapped fashions. These girls don't waste
energy competing for boys; instead, they focus, undistracted, on
academics. They also get to know one another: One of the girls at the
Young Women's Leadership School says that she was able to forge
closer friendships with her classmates because "they knew me on a
different level than they would have if there had been boys here."</TE>
<TE>   The two schools are places where girls feel comfortable asking
obvious questions in math and science class. At Marlborough, the
girls are so opinionated and outspoken that a woman who comes to talk
to students about the history of women and their body images is
practically shouted off stage. "The whole point of segregating
girls," writes Stabiner, "was to focus their attention on academic
achievement and have them define themselves in terms of
accomplishment, not by the more fleeting measures of appearance and
popularity."</TE>
<TE>   We follow this process with mounting interest as Stabiner shows us
the college-prep obstacle course facing Marlborough seniors: SAT
courses, the early admissions game, the agonizing application essay.
In East Harlem, meanwhile, the goal isn't so much getting into the
Ivies as keeping the girls in school, introducing them to the idea of
going to college and avoiding pregnancy. One in five black teenagers
and one in six Latinas get pregnant every year, and one of the book's
most alarming scenes is a sex education class at Leadership School,
when it becomes clear to the teacher that most of the girls are
having sex and most of them aren't using birth control. "What do you
do," asked one girl in an anonymous note, "when you're pregnant and
afraid to tell somebody?" Still, the Leadership School provides a
serious academic environment that gives the students an incentive not
to get pregnant and drop out. It even produces star students who, we
learn in the epilogue, get into colleges like Columbia and Bard.</TE>
<TE>   Stabiner introduces a dizzying array of girls: seniors at
Marlborough and ninth-graders at the Leadership School, along with
their well-meaning teachers and administrators. At times, it is hard
to keep track of each girl's story, the more so when Stabiner breaks
up her narrative with interesting points of context: the history of
women's education, studies showing that girls' and boys' brains
develop differently, studies about girls' self-esteem. Stabiner finds
that girls' schools succeed in shaping their students into strong,
smart achievers, but she expects the reader to believe that the 1991
American Assn. of University Women's study, which showed that girls
were discriminated against in coed classrooms, is still the last word
on coed schools. Missing from Stabiner's glowing portrayal of how
girls' schools empower their students is any real-time comparison to
girls at coed schools.</TE>
<TE>   In one of the few anecdotes that compares the parallel universes
in secondary school education, a Marlborough girl named Sommer Louie
talks about a childhood friend who attends a coed school: "Her mind
is not on the books. She has a boyfriend this week, a boyfriend that
week. She doesn't have the same drive." Sommer concludes that the
only difference between them is where they go to school.</TE>
<TE>   The reader, meanwhile, is left to wonder, for example, how many
girls at Harvard-Westlake School, an elite coed prep school in Los
Angeles, get into good colleges and how their self-esteem and math
scores compare with those of Ivy League-bound Marlborough girls. Is
it the all-girl environment that helps these girls thrive or the hard
work of the girls and their teachers? It is difficult for the reader
to judge</TE>
<TE>   Stabiner finds virtually no disadvantage to an all-girls'
education. Her daughter's being a student at Marlborough seems to be
an inherent conflict of interest. What author, after all, would want
to alienate her child's teachers? The cruelty that adolescent girls
are so famous for is also suspiciously absent from these pages.
Should we assume that this kind of behavior is worse in coed schools?
None of these girls seems to suffer from eating disorders, also
common among adolescent girls. Does this mean that single-sex
education is a panacea for this ailment?</TE>
<TE>   Although Stabiner fails to dramatize the difference between
single-sex and coed schools, "All Girls" will give perspective to
parents considering their options and to politicians seeking reform
in the public school system. They can all rest assured that the tea
party is over.</TE>

<HD>Growing Up Absurd</HD>
<DH>THE TERRITORY OF MEN: A Memoir, By Joelle Fraser, Villard:
226 pp., $22.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAURA CLARIDGE</AU>
<BD>Laura Claridge is the author, most recently, of the
biography "Norman Rockwell: A Life."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In her memoir, "The Territory of Men," Joelle Fraser recounts what it
was like to be a child of flower children, pretty much left to raise
herself while her parents steered their own course of personal
fulfillment. But premature exposure to illicit adult worlds--watching
marijuana haze encircle the hot tubs of groping couples, studying the
bonhomie born of unlimited supplies of liquor and coke--ends up
secondary to the most significant legacy of Fraser's childhood, that
hidebound convention whereby the worth of a woman's life is measured
by the presence of a man in it.</LD>
<LD>   Her prose is cool, precise and elegant. It is, in fact, the ideal
writerly style to contain oversized passions that exceed the norms of
polite society. In "The Kiss," Kathryn Harrison polished even the
spaces between her sentences to encompass the shock of "consensual"
incest. Mary Ladd Gavell articulated in neat, tight phrases the
sometimes forbidden and often contradictory yearnings for freedom in
her short stories about being a good mother, wife, daughter, aunt.</LD>
<TE>   Writing in the kind of territory inhabited by these admirable
wordsmiths, Fraser included, requires a specific talent. How to
achieve the reader's cooperation as the hero sympathizes with her
family's unconventional choices, though we (and she) recoil from
their consequences? Somehow, crafting poetic snippets of information,
Fraser traces psychologically shrewd pictograms that convince her
audience to be as forgiving of the key players as she apparently is.</TE>
<TE>   Fraser's mother, beautiful and intelligent, left her feckless but
charming surfer husband in Hawaii to return with her toddler to San
Francisco in 1967. Back in California, however, she quickly found her
self-worth dependent upon having a man by her side at all times. To
her credit, she usually chose men who treated Joelle kindly, even
paternally.</TE>
<TE>   The exception was particularly bad: a live-in lover who fondled
the young child until she broke down and told her mother. Seeing the
woman grow "tense with rage," Joelle realizes that "she had chosen me
over him, and I felt a love for her so big I wasn't sure I could hold
it inside. She reached over and held my hand, squeezing it tightly,
enough so that it hurt, but I didn't mind a bit."</TE>
<TE>   If the author knew that she could depend on her mother in a
crisis, she also recognized that faced with the ordinary, tedious
tasks of parenthood, that same person often opted out. When Joelle
was a teenager, her mother would disappear to spend the night at a
new boyfriend's place; sometimes the adolescent would return from
school to find the defeated woman sprawled in a drunken stupor in the
living room.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps predictably, given the subject, the compelling portraits
in this book are of the male company that her mother keeps. From
Fraser's own father to the well-meaning, warm Mac to Tom, the evil
bully, each man comes to life under the writer's spare but gentle
appraisal. Fraser romanticizes her parent into a highly gifted,
charismatic, drunken novelist who, it is implied, has to be forgiven
his inability to tend to anyone but himself. Fathers teased with
their love; it was real but it lacked strings.</TE>
<TE>   If the author's mother, raising the children, is indicted, however
gently, for her sins of commission, the largely absent father is held
barely accountable for being missing in action. Sharp-eyed,
preternaturally observant as a child, Fraser maintains throughout her
youth a tendency to exculpate the men while withholding such clemency
from her mother. An eerie sense prevails that the adult author also
endorses psychologically--helplessly--the debilitating beliefs she
intellectually eschews.</TE>
<TE>   It's a paradox that never fails to sting: the liberation to do
one's own thing often shortchanges justice, especially for the
children dependent upon adults' sacrifices for their mental and
physical health. Far from being a populist way of life, the social
forms of the late '60s and '70s look oddly elitist the further we get
from them.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of "The Territory of Men," where we glimpse Fraser's
failed early marriage and her tendency to be appeased by emotionally
dangerous liaisons, the point is clear: The writer expects her future
relationships with men to be messy and self-destructive. Even
Fraser's reserved prose, meting out a lush story as much in the
silent moments as in the presence of words, suggests her worried
sense of her own future.</TE>
<TE>   Only by demythologizing the male territory and transforming the
equation she grew up with--the emotionally demanding, needy woman;
the kindly, well-intentioned man whose attractiveness depends in turn
upon freedom from attachment--will she be able to make decisions from
a different playing field. Her book's dedication to both parents and
to her brothers from various parental pairings somehow implies such a
redemption in the offing.</TE>

<HD>Poisoned Chalice</HD>
<DH>A BREATH OF FRESH AIR: A Novel, By Amulya Malladi,
Ballantine: 214 pp., $23.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHITRA DIVAKARUNI</AU>
<BD>Chitra Divakaruni is the author of "Unknown Errors of
Our Lives" and "The Vine of Desire."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In "A Breath of Fresh Air," the story of a personal tragedy faced by
a young woman in contemporary India gains resonance because it is
skillfully intertwined with a larger public tragedy--the Bhopal gas
leak that destroyed thousands of lives in 1984. (While the official
dead toll is listed at more than 5,000, activists claim the number of
deaths from gas-related illnesses is closer to 20,000.) In the
novel's dramatic beginning section, the protagonist, Anjali, almost
dies when her negligent husband forgets to pick her up at the Bhopal
train station on the night of the poisonous gas cloud. This leads to
the breakdown of their already shaky marriage. Anjali, a strong woman
with a streak of stubbornness, refuses to give up on life in spite of
her recurring health problems. She goes back to college, starts a
career, meets the quiet and considerate Sandeep and marries him. But
their happiness is marred by their son's increasingly serious
illness, a legacy of Anjali's exposure to the deadly poison. Things
get complicated when Anjali's ex-husband Prakash, now remarried, is
transferred to the same town Anjali moved to after the accident, and
the two happen to run into each other at the vegetable market. How
the two couples negotiate their way around the past and the anger,
guilt, suspicion and blame they carry forms the rest of the novel.</LD>
<TE>   By showing us the ways in which the Bhopal incident continues to
affect not only the lives of those who were directly involved in the
tragedy, but also the lives of the next generation, Malladi
personalizes an event that had been, for many readers, merely an
unfortunate but distant occurrence.</TE>
<TE>   Malladi's style often falls into plainness, making us wish,
sometimes, for more expansion and detail, and a deeper exploration of
the ways in which Anjali's personal betrayal is connected to a larger
social injustice. But she draws us into the novel with her
characters, who are refreshingly free of stereotype. The major
characters--both men and women--are given chapters in which they
express their responses to the complications and tragedies in their
lives. Their voices are clear and strong, each one carefully
modulated to be different, and as the book progresses, they surprise
us by their reactions to events and to each other.</TE>
<TE>   Except in a couple of places, Malladi has successfully managed to
avoid sentimentality and melodrama in her handling of emotional
material--a near-fatal accident, a child's mortal illness, a spouse's
infidelity. And that is no mean achievement for a first-time
novelist.</TE>

<HD>The Runniest Yoke In a Hard-Boiled Field</HD>
<DH>MEANWHILE BACK AT THE RANCH: A Novel, By Kinky Friedman,
Simon &amp; Schuster: 200 pp., $24</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL HARRIS</AU>
<BD>Michael Harris is regular contributor to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In one way, Kinky Friedman's mystery novels are unlike anybody
else's--witty parodies of the genre in which we're always a little
surprised that characters do get kidnapped or murdered and that Kinky
Friedman (the author's detective alter ego) is able to solve the
case. He's a humanist, an animal lover, given to bawdy wisecracks and
poetic musings--the runniest yolk in a hard-boiled field.</LD>
<LD>   As a series, however, the Friedman mysteries--15 of them now--bank
on being cozily familiar. Just as the reader of a new Sherlock Holmes
story used to anticipate the violin playing and cocaine, Dr. Watson's
earnest denseness and Holmes' cry of "The game's afoot!," so Kinky's
readers depend on having midnight called "Cinderella time," noon
"Gary Cooper time" and hanging up the phone "cradling the blower."
They await the sex jokes, the thunder of the lesbian dance class
overhead on Vandam Street in Greenwich Village, the existential
laments that Kinky addresses to his cat, who never replies.</LD>
<TE>   Fans may be relieved that spoiled, beautiful Stephanie, who played
a major role in the last Friedman mystery, "Steppin' on a Rainbow,"
is absent from "Meanwhile Back at the Ranch." Her sexual put-downs of
Kinky were more unpleasant than funny. But otherwise, the new novel
follows the common script. The detective is amply supplied with
cigars, espresso, Irish whiskey and rue, and other Village Irregulars
help out: McGovern, Ratso and, most important, P.I. Steve Rambam,
trained as both a rabbi and a cop.</TE>
<TE>   Kinky is juggling two cases at once. Well, actually three, but the
third is merely a prop that allows Rambam to code-name them Moe,
Larry and Curly, after the Three Stooges. And this, in turn, allows
Friedman to confide the sort of faux arcana that give his novels
their loopy charm: "Most people today don't know this, but all four
of them [including Shemp] were Orthodox Jews from Brooklyn. Their
real name was the Fine Brothers and they were all general building
contractors.... It's still a very prestigious thing in Brooklyn to
live in a Three Stooges-built home."</TE>
<TE>   In New York, Kinky is asked to find a 10-year-old autistic boy,
Dylan Weinberg, who has vanished. Dylan is a stock-market wizard but
can utter only one word: "Shnay." Meanwhile, back at the ranch of the
title--the Utopia Rescue Ranch for animals in the Texas Hill Country,
run by Kinky's Cousin Nancy (no relation) and apparently a real
place--the mascot and guiding spirit, a three-legged cat named Lucky,
is likewise missing.</TE>
<TE>   Kinky lets Rambam look for Dylan while he high-tails it to Texas
to soothe Nancy, who is convinced, thanks to late-night radio talk
shows, that anyone from neo-Nazis to space aliens might have had it
in for Lucky. It seems to be a hopeless search. As Kinky tells Ratso,
"It's hard to find a little cat in a big state." Rambam, whose
rabbinical education has given him "an extremely well-developed sense
of right and wrong, which occasionally he wielded like a hammer," is
outraged that Kinky considers a missing cat as important as a missing
kid.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, Rambam's growing involvement with Dylan's sexy
older sister, Julia, leads Kinky to fear that Rambam isn't
concentrating on the case. She "may be my future ex-wife," Rambam
says. "[A]ll I have to do is find out if she likes to be spanked."</TE>
<TE>   Despite its brevity, a Friedman novel devotes the first half of
its pages to touching all the familiar bases, setting the scene and
persuading us that a) the mystery can't be solved and b) Kinky is the
last person on Earth who could solve it. Then, in an offhand way, he
makes the necessary deductions. The answers seem to arise in spite of
him, almost involuntarily, like hiccups.</TE>
<TE>   This has never been more true than in "Meanwhile Back at the
Ranch," in which the story is so secondary to the atmospherics that
it's hard not to wonder whether Friedman's inspiration is running
thin.</TE>
<TE>   The climax, such as it is, leads Kinky and Rambam from a Manhattan
murder site to an orphanage in Schenectady, N.Y., which is Dickensian
indeed, if not in the way we expect.</TE>

<TE>   Scholastic/Orchard: 32 pp., $15.95</TE>
<TE>   A smooth-tongued snake takes on the role of tempter--and
raconteur--in a pleasing original story inspired by a Native American
folk tale. "Once upon the time of no stories," begins Marguerite W.
Davol ("The Paper Dragon"), creating and maintaining an appropriately
timeless aura. On separate occasions, siblings Beno and Allita are
individually sent by their mother to gather fruit for the family.
Each encounters a sly snake that offers to tell them stories in
return for the fruit they've just picked. As neither child has ever
heard a story before, each accepts the snake's offer and is regaled
with various myths and dramatic accounts. Mama and Papa, while
deprived of strawberries and raspberries, are eventually rewarded
with the entertaining fare that Beno and Allita have collected
instead. Davol's folk tale rhythm and simple imagery are just right
for a tale about the origin of story. Yumi Heo ("One Sunday Morning")
creates a smiling, blank-eyed clan that recalls wooden dolls. Her
cheerfully cluttered pencil-and-oil compositions hum with activity.
Drawing her subjects first--people, chickens, fireflies, apple
trees--then painting background colors around them and leaving bits
of white paper exposed, Heo gives her work extra pop. (Ages 5-9)</TE>

<TE>   DEAR MRS. LaRUE</TE>
<TE>   Letters From Obedience School</TE>
<TE>   By Mark Teague</TE>
<TE>   Scholastic: 32 pp., $15.95</TE>
<TE>   A dog's life is hardly to be envied if one believes the words of
Ike, a rambunctious pooch sentenced to obedience school by his
exasperated owner, Mrs. LaRue. Having repeatedly terrorized the
neighbors' cats and snatched one snack too many from the kitchen
counter, Ike finds himself enrolled at Igor Brotweiler Canine
Academy. The hero begins a clever letter-writing campaign to Mrs.
LaRue that paints a grim (and hopefully guilt-inducing) picture of
his Brotweiler experience. But readers are privy to the hilarious
truth. Mark Teague ("How Do Dinosaurs Say Good Night?") depicts the
pampered pup at the spa-like academy in brightly colored vignettes,
juxtaposed with black-and-white prison-like scenes that illustrate
Ike's imagined hardship.</TE>
<TE>   He composes his correspondence with dramatic flair, whether
describing his "inmate" experience ("The guards here are all caught
up in this 'good dog, bad dog' thing") or reflecting on his misdeeds
back at home ("Were the neighbors really complaining about my
howling? ... Let's recall that these are the same neighbors who are
constantly waking me up in the middle of the afternoon with their
loud vacuuming"). Throughout, the devilish laughs are in the details
(waiters in white coats serving academy dogs gourmet meals and frozen
drinks; Ike's images of a hard life in striped prison garb plus ball
and chain). Even the duo's reunion (to much fanfare) plays off an
earlier joke. All in all, a tail-wagger of a book that will have
readers howling with amusement. (Ages 5-8)</TE>

<TE>   911</TE>
<TE>   The Book of Help</TE>
<TE>   Edited by Michael Cart with Marc Aronson and Marianne Carus</TE>
<TE>   Cricket/Marcato: 178 pp., $17.95, $9.95 paper</TE>
<TE>   An impressive cast of more than 20 children's book authors donated
work to this highly personal, often affecting roundup of essays,
short stories and poems inspired by the events of Sept. 11. Organized
into four sections from "Healing" to "Reacting and Recovering," the
pieces range from related events triggered by the New York tragedy to
writers' evocations of the horrific images they viewed that morning.
Arnold Adoff draws a correlation to the assassination of Martin
Luther King Jr. in 1968 ("Souls rise / without reason long before
their reasonable times"); David Paterson (son of fellow contributor
Katherine Paterson) recounts perhaps the most immediate connection to
the terrorist attacks as he relates his experience at ground zero on
Sept. 13 with shovel in hand to help clear the rubble. In a candid
entry, Walter Dean Myers recalls watching a Middle Eastern man in
London cheering the loss of American lives: "He is my enemy because
those who think like he does have brought violence and hatred to my
door, and to the doors of those I love."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps Susan Cooper (who heard the roar of a fighter plane in New
York City on Sept. 11 and recalled the bombs that fell on her London
neighborhood during World War II) best sums up the collection's
underlying message: "But the opposite of terror is hope, and ... hope
can drive out fear." Other contributors to this strong collection
include Avi, Sharon Creech, Nikki Giovanni, Margaret Mahy and Naomi
Shihab Nye; Chris Raschka provides an evocative cover and interior
pen-and-inks for each section opener. The publisher will contribute a
portion of the proceeds of this book to the Families of Freedom
Scholarship Fund. (Ages 12 and older)</TE>

<TE>   WITH THEIR EYES</TE>
<TE>   September 11th--the view from a high school at ground zero</TE>
<TE>   Edited by Annie Thoms</TE>
<TE>   HarperTempest: 256 pp.,</TE>
<TE>   $6.99 paper</TE>
<TE>   Annie Thoms, an English teacher at Stuyvesant High School, located
four blocks from the site of the World Trade Center, spearheaded a
dramatic production at school last February based on 10 students'
recorded interviews (with classmates, faculty and staff members). The
students converted the transcripts into "poem-monologues," which they
presented and the text of which appears here. In Thoms' introduction,
she notes that the goal was "to capture the ways individual people
express themselves in speech," and, indeed, the collective impression
is one of a group therapy session that may well provide some healing
for teen readers still struggling with the event's aftermath.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the monologues (at times laced with "um" and "like")
probably work better in a dramatization; on the page, the narratives
at times falter and a few repeat similar themes. The poignant
"Precious Cargo," for instance, begins with a photograph of a student
performing as a pregnant English teacher, and her words of
protectiveness about both her unborn child and her students read well
on the page but would likely be even more moving onstage. Still, the
emotional rhythms of the volume take on a credible ebb and flow. A
welcome dash of humor comes through in a freshman's contention that
the students' relocation to Brooklyn Tech (while their school
functioned as a triage center) put everyone on equal footing
("Everybody was like / 'Where the hell are my classes?' / so it was
kinda like everybody was a freshman").</TE>
<TE>   In the closing entry, perhaps the most smoothly structured in the
volume, the school theater manager recalls returning to a newly
reopened Stuyvesant to find the flag missing from the stage. Later,
he "came across a picture / of firemen / installing a flag / on the
mast of the World Trade Center / and I looked at the picture and my
jaw dropped. / It was our flag." Readers willing to overlook less
relevant and revealing segments will find a number of moving moments
here. (Ages 13 and older)</TE>

<DH>THE BOOK OF ILLUSIONS: A Novel, By Paul Auster, Henry Holt:
336 pp., $25</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN LEVI</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Levi is a contributing writer to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Everyone thought he was dead." With seeming transparency, Paul
Auster opens "The Book of Illusions," his 10th and most affecting and
virtuosic novel. Auster has always packed a library of imagination
into his novels, and illusion has always projected its tantalizing
images on the cave walls of Auster's writing. His Cartesian musings
on life, death and the many illusions the living must fabricate to
keep the sputtering reels of their lives turning have been integral
parts of his voice throughout his many novels, from the collegiate
fantasies of "Moon Palace" to "Timbuktu," whose hero is the canine
companion of a schizophrenic.</LD>
<LD>   But in "The Book of Illusions," an older and wiser Auster has
added a new ingredient to the metaphysical play and deft
storytelling, a sadness that colors all illusion, that creates a
stunningly moving and very real portrait of a man over-marked by
death.</LD>
<LD>   The "dead" man is a lost star of the silent screen, an actor named
Hector Mann, who, after making a dozen two-reel comedies, disappeared
on the night of Nov. 23, 1928. The commentator on Mann's apparent
death is a Vermonter named David Zimmer, a professor of comparative
literature, an authority on Mann (having written the only biography
of the auteur) and an authority on death.</LD>
<TE>   On June 7, 1985, Zimmer's wife and two sons disappeared in a plane
crash. For six months, Zimmer sank deep into depression and
dipsomania. And then one night, at the onset of a Vermont winter,
Zimmer flipped on the TV and saw one of Mann's old films, "The
Teller's Tale." Something about the Mastroianni-handsome Mann in his
trademark white tropical suit and pencil mustache, desperately trying
to count money and catch the eye of a pretty secretary at the same
time, stimulated a dead zone in Zimmer's heart and made him laugh.</TE>
<TE>   The laugh--the discovery that he was not dead--led Zimmer out of
the bottle and into a quest for the complete works of Mann. And so he
takes to the air that so brutally took his family from him and
travels around the world, from Rochester, N.Y., to Paris, from
Berkeley to London, to screen the few existing films. The marvelous
plots of these lost silent classics give Auster license to unleash
his monstrous appetite for story. More significantly, they allow the
reader to watch Zimmer watching, to understand how the seeming
therapy of the flickering images on the screen reflects Zimmer's own
painful loss.</TE>
<TE>   In "Mr. Nobody," Zimmer watches Mann play the man with
everything--lovely wife and family, good job, excellent
prospects--undone by a treacherous colleague who slips a potion into
his drink that causes him to disappear. Mann milks the comic
potential of invisibility complete with pratfalls and voyeurism. But
night eventually falls, and all is darkness. The invisible Mr. Nobody
sneaks into his own house to see how his family is faring. Sitting
down at the edge of the bed of his daughter, he reaches out to stroke
her hair and then stops, afraid of terrifying her should she awake
and find no one there. "It is an affecting sequence," Zimmer says,
"and Hector plays it with restraint and simplicity. He has lost the
right to touch his own daughter.... In that one small gesture--the
hand hovering in the air, the open palm no more than an inch from the
girl's head--we understand that Hector has been reduced to nothing."</TE>
<TE>   The lost Zimmer understands the invisible Mann. He publishes his
book. And then three months later, a letter arrives, postmarked
Albuquerque. " 'Dear Professor Zimmer,' the note said. 'Hector has
read your book and would like to meet you. Are you interested in
paying us a visit? Yours sincerely, Frieda Spelling (Mrs. Hector
Mann).' " In a cinematic flash, 60 years after his disappearance, Mr.
Nobody returns to life.</TE>
<TE>   It is not clear, however, that Zimmer is ready to return to life.
For the Zimmer who still spends hours sorting the Lego pieces and
cataloging the baseball cards of his dead sons, the illusion of this
cinematic Lazarus rising from the grave is shrouded in equal parts
grief and excitement. Something more real than movies and letters--or
his latest project, a translation of memoirist Chateaubriand, who
provides the telling epigram for "The Book of Illusions" ("Man has
not one and the same life. He has many lives, placed end to end, and
that is the cause of his misery.")--has to shock him out of his
torpor.</TE>
<TE>   Enter Alma Grund, the goddaughter of Hector Mann, who arrives like
a noir heroine, complete with silver-plated, pearl-handled revolver,
to take Zimmer to New Mexico by any means necessary. With Alma's
entrance, Auster takes his greatest writerly leap. Suddenly the
entire tone of the book, from description to dialogue, shifts as
Zimmer awakens from academic research and reverie and moves into
celluloid action.</TE>
<TE>   "Go ahead and shoot," Zimmer tells Alma. "You'll be doing me a
great service." Hector is on his deathbed, Alma replies. Zimmer must
come and bear witness and help Hector die.</TE>
<TE>   As Zimmer and Alma trade Bogies and Bacalls, the reader of
Zimmer's languid prose memoir becomes the popcorn-muncher at Zimmer's
fast-paced matinee thriller. No longer is "The Book of Illusions" an
armchair chronicle of a lost college professor. Zimmer leaps into the
drama with the panache of an existentially challenged 20th century
antihero. And the leap challenges our belief in all of Zimmer's
stories. Did he actually receive those letters from the wife of
Hector Mann? Is Hector Mann alive? Did Hector ever exist? Did Zimmer
ever see him on the screen, or are all these movies a tightly braided
lifeline for a man desperate to laugh?</TE>
<TE>   But the marvel of "The Book of Illusions" is that it is no mere
metaphysical exercise. The novel packs the weight of a human heart
between its dramatic covers. It is the memoir of a man who died, a
man who disappeared when his wife and his sons fell out of the sky
and, like Mann's Mr. Nobody, lost the right to touch his loved ones.
It is a story of unspeakable grief told with virtuosic brilliance,
which Auster finally brings safely to Earth with a very human
simplicity.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From `The Book of Illusions'</TE>
<TE>   We all want to believe in impossible things, I suppose, to
persuade ourselves that miracles can happen. Considering that I was
the author of the only book ever written on Hector Mann, it probably
made sense that someone would think I'd jump at the chance to believe
he was still alive. But I wasn't in the mood to jump. Or at least I
didn't think I was. My book had been born out of a great sorrow, and
now that the book was behind me, the sorrow was still there. Writing
about comedy had been no more than a pretext, an odd form of medicine
that I had swallowed every day for over a year on the off chance that
it would dull the pain inside me. To some extent, it did. But Frieda
Spelling (or whoever was posing as Frieda Spelling) couldn't have
known that. She couldn't have known that on June 7, 1985, just one
week short of my tenth wedding anniversary, my wife and two sons had
been killed in a plane crash. She might have seen that the book was
dedicated to them (For Helen, Todd, and Marco--In Memory), but those
names couldn't have meant anything to her ....</TE>

<HD>All That Is Solid Melts Into Air</HD>
<DH>REVOLUTION IN THE AIR: Sixties Radicals Turn to Lenin, Mao
and Che, By Max Elbaum, Verso: 370 pp., $30</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PLATT</AU>
<BD>Tony Platt, professor of social work at Cal State
Sacramento, has been a member of the editorial board of the journal
Social Justice since 1974.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The 20th century began with the promise of humanity rising on new
foundations and closed with unregulated capitalism triumphant, a
dangerously polarized world and communism dead and buried, with "no
evidence," observes Max Elbaum, "that Marxism-Leninism's resurrection
lies anywhere on the horizon." Between the late 1960s and 1980s, tens
of thousands of American activists joined or supported what Elbaum
calls the New Communist Movement. By the 1990s only a few hundred
die-hards remained, with most veterans, like myself, abandoning
communism. What happened to a political tendency that flared so
brightly and dissipated so quickly is the subject of this trenchantly
argued book.</LD>
<TE>   Elbaum is a longtime political activist who in the 1960s was a
member of Students for a Democratic Society and from 1976 to 1989 a
leader of Line of March, one of the main new communist organizations.
"Revolution in the Air: Sixties Radicals Turn to Lenin, Mao and Che"
is neither a confessional renunciation of communism--following the
example set in 1950 by Arthur Koestler, Richard Wright and other
prominent intellectuals of a previous generation who publicized their
disillusionment in "The God That Failed"--nor a romanticized,
self-serving memoir of a professional revolutionary trying to justify
how he has spent most of his life. Instead, Elbaum has written a
complex, nuanced analysis--based upon interviews with ex-communists,
internal documents of leftist organizations, his own political
experiences and a wide range of secondary sources--that will be the
basis of future studies of the fall of American communism.</TE>
<TE>   In 1968 it was evident to millions in this country that revolution
was in the air. The Vietnamese Tet offensive challenged the
invulnerability of American militarism; the murder of Martin Luther
King Jr. triggered widespread black rebellions; activists on campus,
in the labor and women's movements and in communities of color
generated an unprecedented challenge to the status quo. An opinion
poll reported that more college students (20%) identified with Che
Guevara than with any of the presidential candidates, and hundreds of
thousands thought that this country needed a "mass revolutionary
party." In May 1970, protests against Nixon's escalation of the
Vietnam War led to what in effect was a campus general strike, with
Business Week sounding the alarm that popular protests threatened
"the whole economic and social structure of the nation."</TE>
<TE>   But only a minority of '60s activists, observes Elbaum, "believed
revolution was not only desirable, but possible--and maybe even not
too far around the corner." They formed organizations led by
dedicated, trained cadres who would "ensure that the revolutionary
potential glimpsed in the 1960s would be realized next time around."
As one who turned to revolutionary Marxism, I fit the profile of an
important sector of the New Communist Movement: the white,
middle-class son of parents who had participated in the inter-war Old
Left; an adolescent who came of age as the countercultural movement
unleashed a torrent of rebellious images and possibilities; and a
young professor, starting my first teaching job at Berkeley in 1968,
committed to practicing what I preached.</TE>
<TE>   The movement attracted not only the white, disaffected sons and
daughters of privilege, many of whom joined the Revolutionary Union
or other Marxist-Leninist groups, but also thousands of recruits from
impoverished communities who were drawn to such organizations as the
Black Panther Party, the Young Lords Party, La Raza Unida Party, the
American Indian Movement, Detroit's League of Revolutionary Workers
and I Wor Kuen.</TE>
<TE>   Though the number of radicals who became full-time cadres remained
relatively small--estimated at never more than 10,000--Elbaum argues
that in the 1970s the movement "constituted the most dynamic section
of a vibrant anticapitalist left," its influence radiating throughout
the antiwar movement, anti-racist struggles at the community level,
and study groups and bookstores. Revolutionary literature--such as
Frantz Fanon's "The Wretched of the Earth" (1968), Paul Baran and
Paul Sweezy's "Monopoly Capital" (1968), and Felix Greene's "The
Enemy: What Every American Should Know About Imperialism" (1971)
engaged millions of readers. William Hinton's "Fanshen: A Documentary
of Revolution in a Chinese Village" (1966) alone sold a remarkable
200,000 paperback copies. In its formative years, Elbaum reports, the
New Communist Movement was bursting with audacious creativity. He
takes issue with the simplistic thesis, first articulated in Todd
Gitlin's book "The Sixties: Years of Hope, Days of Rage" (1987), that
communists hijacked and wrecked the idealism of New Left activists.
Rather he argues that "the young activists who built the New
Communist Movement ... tried to mesh the political tenacity of the
Old Left and the fervor of the New Left into a powerful revolutionary
party." Unlike the Communist Party that was constrained by its
fawning relationship with the USSR and American trade union
bureaucracy, the movement was much more eclectic, drawing upon the
experiences of the Vietnamese and Chinese Communist parties,
Marxist-led liberation movements in Africa, anti-imperialist
struggles in the Caribbean and Latin America and cultural rebellion
in the West.</TE>
<TE>   But this innovative dynamism quickly stalled as activists "became
mired in dogmatist orthodoxy and moralistic intolerance, reproducing
the worst traits of their predecessors instead of their strengths.
They ended up making party building a fetish and constructed only
sects." What caused such a promising revolutionary movement to
implode? Part of the problem was the movement's failure to unite into
a single organization or even an alliance of cooperative
organizations. Instead, internecine struggles produced endless
splits, posturing and denunciations. Moreover, Elbaum argues, there
was almost no continuity between the '30s and '60s generations of
leftists because the New Left wrote off the Old Left as "stuffed
shirts," while the old guard regarded the upstarts as self-indulgent
hippies and traitors to the USSR.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't help, Elbaum adds, that the movement embraced "a strong
current of anti-intellectualism," which took the form of a dogmatic
scouring of Marxist-Leninist-Maoist texts in search of the communist
grail. The emphasis on fundamentalist truths and revolutionary purity
substituted for the hard task of creating and applying new ideas:
"The movement paid a terrible price for embracing this quest for
orthodoxy."</TE>
<TE>   It is ironic, observes Elbaum, that a movement whose raison d'etre
was the struggle against inequality should reproduce autocratic
leadership and anti-democratic tendencies. Most of the new communist
groups demanded unquestioning loyalty and obedience from its cadres:
"Dissenters were either brought into line, pressured to quit, or
expelled." More significantly, the Marxist movement minimized the
struggle for gender and sexual equality and thus drove out many
activist women, gays and lesbians into autonomous organizations. In
this respect, the new communist line on "the woman question" was very
similar to the Old Left's attitude to "Proletarian Morality," which
according to Arthur Koestler, "consisted in getting married, being
faithful to one's spouse, and producing proletarian babies."
(Koestler's essay is available in a new edition of "The God That
Failed," which features an insightful forward by historian David C.
Engerman.) While Elbaum critically observes that "most
Marxist-Leninists shared the homophobia prevalent in society as a
whole," in my view he underestimates how much damage was done to the
revolutionary left by its policies of sexual bigotry and adulation of
machismo leaders.</TE>
<TE>   "Revolution in the Air" demonstrates that the New Communist
Movement, with its quest for ecumenical internationalism and
rejection of the Old Left's fixation on the Soviet Union, ended up
with its own dependence on China. The Marxist left continually
exchanged fierce diatribes about the revolutionary virtues and sins
of the world's two communist superpowers but actually, charges
Elbaum, prior to 1976 "knew little about what had really happened in
the USSR and less about what was actually taking place in China."
Just as many Old Left communists broke with the Communist Party in
1936 after the Soviet show trials and again in 1956 after Nikita
Khrushchev denounced Stalin's crimes, so too, many Maoists left the
New Communist Movement in the wake of the Sino-Soviet split,
especially after Nixon's visit to China in 1972. The recognition by
China in 1973 of the Pinochet dictatorship in Chile was the beginning
of the end of the American left's love affair with Maoism. With Mao's
death in 1976 and subsequent revelations about the crimes of the
Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the relationship was over. By
1989--the momentous year of the dismantling of the Berlin Wall and
massacre in Tiananmen Square--the American Marxist lefts, old and
new, had reached a political dead end.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, it is important to note, as Elbaum does, that the
ultimate failure of American communism was rooted in the resiliency
of capitalism and the decline of revolutionary mass struggles at the
global level. "A central problem" of the New Communist Movement was
its "outright misassessment of how ripe capitalism was for defeat."
Marxist leftists, says Elbaum candidly, had "an exaggerated
evaluation of their potential," especially by the mid-1970s when the
New Right was quickly climbing the ladder of power. Rather than
adjusting to the demise of radical movements and focusing on the less
glamorous challenge of creating a viable left force in American
politics, the New Communist Movement "ultimately dissipated rather
than coalesced the forces that could have accomplished that task."
For example, the Marxist left essentially boycotted George McGovern's
antiwar candidacy in 1972. By the time radicals made an effort to
support the 1984 and 1988 Jesse Jackson presidential campaigns and
build the Rainbow Coalition into a viable left-of-center political
tendency, the effort was too little and too late. "Just when the
ascent of Reagan underscored the need for a left," the movement sank
"into crisis and collapse" and quickly "squandered its initial
energy, dedication and potential."</TE>
<TE>   Elbaum's book helps us to appreciate why "at no time since the
birth of the modern socialist movement has the left needed such a
top-to-bottom overhaul." It should be required reading for those
interested in the modern history of social movements and for radicals
of my generation who are trying to figure out what went so wrong. And
to the generation of anti-globalization activists who continue the
journey for social justice, "Revolution in the Air" passes on the
advice that they need to chart a new map.</TE>

<LD>SEARCHING FOR STEINBECK'S SEA OF CORTEZ</LD>
<LD>   A Makeshift Expedition Along Baja's Desert Coast</LD>
<LD>   By Andromeda Romano-Lax</LD>
<TE>   Sasquatch Books: 288 pp., $16.95</TE>
<TE>   "Sea of Cortez" was John Steinbeck's answer to the fame that
almost ruined his life after the publication of "The Grapes of Wrath"
in 1939. In the spring of 1940 he lit out for the territory with his
close friend the biologist Ed Ricketts. Steinbeck, 38, had just left
a fraying marriage, and Ricketts, 42, a bad affair. They went
tide-pooling for six blissful weeks in the Sea of Cortez, trying to
"avoid adventure," wrote Steinbeck, and to see "what is," wrote
Ricketts.</TE>
<TE>   Andromeda Romano-Lax, a journalist, and her husband, Brian, an
environmental educator, read from Steinbeck's book at their wedding.
For them, it established the principles of life, science and
creativity that they wanted in their own lives. In the spring of 1998
they decided to make the same trip with their two children, then 2
and 5. The vessel they chose was a 24-foot sailboat manned by a
depressed captain. They traveled the 800-mile-long gulf by sailboat,
kayak and car, stopping at the same 23 tide pools that had captivated
Steinbeck and Ricketts. They discovered nothing that they had
expected.</TE>
<TE>   They found themselves not flooded with ideas but exhausted.
Instead of encountering wanton environmental destruction, they came
across surprisingly rich and intact ecosystems. Instead of running
away from home, they found that they were running toward home. No
epiphanies. No scientific breakthroughs. A few adventures, a few
small changes in the marriage. Romano-Lax writes evenly about the
inner and outer voyages. It is a testimony to the power of knowing
one book well and living it.</TE>

<TE>   SPITTING OFF TALL BUILDINGS</TE>
<TE>   By Dan Fante</TE>
<TE>   Canongate Books/Edinburgh:</TE>
<TE>   154 pp., $13</TE>
<TE>   Even if Dan Fante weren't the son of John Fante, author of one of
the classics of L.A. lit, "The Road to Los Angeles," his novel
"Spitting Off Tall Buildings" would deserve attention. Oddly enough,
just as Fante senior's was a quintessentially Southern California
novel, Fante junior's is 100% New York novel, down to its
inflections.</TE>
<TE>   "Spitting Off Tall Buildings," about a complete loser, Dante
Bruno, who moves from L.A. to New York and ends up quitting or being
fired from every minimum-wage job that city has to offer, stuck to my
hands. The language is vulgar. The main character is a stupid,
arrogant drunk, and the action takes place entirely in his decaying
mind. Trying to like him is like climbing a concave rock face: To get
any kind of hold you have to bend over backward.</TE>
<TE>   Fante breaks every rule of human and literary decency. Bruno tells
himself and his captive audience that he has moved to New York to
write a play, but this is a lie. He works as a night manager in a
residence hotel, an airport bus driver, an usher, a window washer, a
street peddler ("other than the cold, the main drawback to the job
was the frequent arrests") and a taxi driver, and in one stint is
even paid to remove staples from documents.</TE>
<TE>   He drinks so heavily that he often blacks out and finds himself in
porn theaters or in emergency rooms with his wrists cut up. He talks
and thinks (because there is no separation between the two acts) like
a cross between a frat boy and a pimp. There is no redemption, no
indication by the end that anything will change in Bruno's life. Yet
you feel that the author has told you the truth about something,
about these jobs and about the drinking life.</TE>

<TE>   SKIN OF THE EARTH</TE>
<TE>   Stories From Nevada's Back Country</TE>
<TE>   By Art Gibney</TE>
<TE>   University of Nevada Press:</TE>
<TE>   144 pp., $16</TE>
<TE>   "We all got to live where we can see the sky, right here on the
skin of the earth. We're connected. The air I breathe out, you
breathe in. Right on down the line." This is cowboy philosophy, and
there's a lot of it in these stories, but Art Gibney does a good job
of showing his readers where it comes from: the landscape, a heritage
or some worrying scar in a character's past. There is a strong sense
of home in all these stories, a pure love of place, especially when
it has to be fought for and even when it has to be left.</TE>
<TE>   In the title story, a couple--who have petitioned the local
government to let them continue to live in their cabin--arrive home
after a frozen trek to the city to arrange the paperwork. "Then we
laid on the bed, listening to the fire and to the snow against the
window as the cats rolled on the floor and the lamplight made their
shadows big on the wall." It's simple writing with a fine cadence
that pays quiet homage to the fact that we get to live at all, much
less care for others and find ourselves loved.</TE>

<DH>REREADING SEX: Battles Over Sexual Knowledge and
Suppression in Nineteenth-Century America, By Helen Lefkowitz
Horowitz, Alfred A. Knopf: 528 pp., $30</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MERLE RUBIN</AU>
<BD>Merle Rubin is a contributing writer to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Reading about sex, seeing it in movies, talking about it on
television and other public milieus, has become commonplace. Even the
once-verboten topics of prostitution, sexually transmitted diseases,
rape, incest, and child abuse have become objects of talk-show
chatter. But mention a harmless activity practiced by most girls and
women and almost every man and boy, and you just might suffer the
fate of former U.S. Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders, fired from her
job by a president who might himself have benefited from her sage
advice. Indeed, apart from the yeoman service performed on its behalf
by "Portnoy's Complaint," masturbation has been the proverbial orphan
child. It's been condemned as wicked and sinful by the anti-sex crowd
but with none of the risque glamour associated with fornication,
adultery or homosexuality. Strangely, too, it has fared almost as
badly among the pro-sex crowd who are inclined to view it as the
sorry fate of sexual wallflowers.</LD>
<TE>   Understanding why a country, so awash in pornography and so
tolerant of sexual freedom, could react so hysterically to Elders'
mild comment was one of the motives animating Helen Lefkowitz
Horowitz's research into sexual attitudes in 19th century America. A
professor of American studies at Smith College, Horowitz had written
a book about the formidable feminist (and lesbian) M. Carey Thomas,
the guiding power behind the founding of Bryn Mawr College. Here
again, the question arose: What did 19th century Americans think
about sex?</TE>
<TE>   But because there seemed to be a considerable gap between what
people actually knew and what they said--or were permitted to say--in
print, Horowitz's quest to understand American sexual attitudes grew
into a study, not only of sexual knowledge but also of the forces
that sought to suppress the "public conversation" about sex.</TE>
<TE>   Once a relatively minor sin, "seldom mentioned even in sermons,"
sometime in the 1830s masturbation was suddenly perceived as one of
the greatest dangers facing American youth. This, Horowitz finds, was
largely the work not of religious maniacs but of so-called reform
physiologists, whose quasi-scientific theories of the body linked
this clearly unproductive (or un-reproductive) use of the sex organs
to all kinds of illnesses, physical, mental and moral. A respected
Connecticut doctor in charge of a lunatic asylum noted, for example,
a shocking prevalence of the practice among the inmates. This, in
turn, led him to conclude that in all probability, it was their
penchant for "self-pollution" that had reduced these hapless souls to
lunacy in the first place. Soon pamphlets and books proliferated,
warning against the dangers. Case histories were told of promising
young boys and girls from good families who fell victim to this habit
and became listless, irrational, or even violent. Parents were warned
to watch for telltale signs: a lad who read novels in bed at night or
preferred lolling about indoors to "normal, healthy" athletic
activities was very likely to fall victim to "the solitary vice."</TE>
<TE>   Some of alarmists saw books as a major culprit: "Every library ...
every classic, every print-shop, has something, prose, poetry, or
picture, which can be perverted ... to the base use of exciting
passion," warned one. Quite apart from the classics, there was plenty
of explicit material available, some of it written to educate, but
some of it intentionally pornographic, written to turn a quick
dollar. Sadly, those who took it upon themselves to demand censorship
seldom bothered to draw any distinctions. Beginning in 1865, with the
passage of the first national censorship law, America's lively,
contentious conversation about sex suffered a serious setback.</TE>
<TE>   Investigating a host of primary sources--court records, newspaper
articles, the writings of reformers, popularizing physicians, sex
educators, evangelists and utopian idealists--Horowitz discerns among
the vast welter of voices four primary "frameworks," as she calls
them. First is the vernacular tradition: the set of conceptions (and
misconceptions) embedded in oral culture, passed down from generation
to generation, and sideways among peers. The second framework,
evangelical Christianity, was essentially distrustful of the flesh
and sought to counter what it considered sexual excess. The third
framework--"reform physiology"--sought a new scientifically based
understanding of the human body. Though some reform physiologists
were proponents of greater sexual freedom, many, such as dietary
reformer Sylvester Graham, preached a health regimen that included
sexual restraint. All, however, believed in publicizing their
findings and theories to inform people. In the fourth framework were
those who placed sex at the very core of being, exponents of free
love like Victoria Woodhull and Ezra Heywood, who felt the state had
no business regulating the sacred passions of the human heart.</TE>
<TE>   These four frameworks, Horowitz points out, often mingled and
overlapped. But this much was generally true: There were those who
believed that knowledge about sex would save people from falling prey
to vice, disease and degradation, and there were those who believed
that talking about sex led to vice, disease and degradation.
Proponents of knowledge believed ignorance was the worst enemy of
innocence. Proponents of suppression believed sex was something no
one thought about on his or her own without being seduced into it.</TE>
<TE>   Contrary to what one might suppose, censorship of printed material
about sex was a relatively late development. In Colonial times, for
example, courts concerned themselves with inappropriate sexual
behavior rather than books, pictures or pamphlets. But times changed.
Focusing on the crucial period from the late 1820s to the end of the
1870s, Horowitz brilliantly delineates the myriad ideas, forces and
personalities at work.</TE>
<TE>   The 1820s saw a massive migration of young white men from the
countryside and small towns to the big cities, particularly New York.
These youths, no longer under the supervision of their families, or
in the case of apprentices, of their bosses' families, worked as
clerks in large companies and lived in boarding houses. With spare
cash in their pockets and time after work on their hands, many began
congregating in saloons, theaters and brothels. (Indeed, there was
not always very much difference among those venues.)</TE>
<TE>   A "racy" sporting press sprang up to provide them with "news" they
could use: accounts of prizefights, horse races and other goings-on,
not to mention profiles of noteworthy criminals and tips on the
whereabouts of the best brothels, indeed, running articles on
attractive prostitutes in much the same way that modern magazines
such as Us run profiles of movie stars. Meanwhile, the country was
swept by revivalism, and evangelists struggled to save young men from
the urban fleshpots.</TE>
<TE>   Sensationalist authors appealed to the "sporting" culture with
stories chock-full of violence, crime, and orgies. This same
masculinist culture disapproved of abortion and birth control, which,
it feared, would prevent young men from knowing whether the girls
they married were "pure" or "impure." Meanwhile, blending elements of
physiology and spiritualism, the school that placed sex at the core
of being celebrated the glories of "amativeness." This admirable
quality not only contributed to the replication of the species, but
also to the bonds of affection between lovers and friends, not to
mention a more far-reaching, Walt Whitman-like love of one's fellow
man. Writers of this framework tended to favor feminism and free
love.</TE>
<TE>   "Rereading Sex" is a splendid work of scholarship: crisply
written, meticulously documented, full of fresh material, shrewd
analysis and sound judgment. But one need not be a historian to enjoy
this book. Horowitz's enthusiasm and sense of fun are infectious. A
superb storyteller, she is a great elucidator, always on hand to
explain knotty matters such as history of obscenity law, the motives
of censors or the thinking of reform physiologists. Her book is an
unmitigated pleasure to read, yet is so informative that those who
read it will feel not only good but downright virtuous.</TE>

<DH>NOBODY'S PERFECT: Writings from the New Yorker, By Anthony
Lane, Alfred A. Knopf: 752 pp, $35</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SCHICKEL</AU>
<BD>Richard Schickel is a contributing writer to Book
Review and a film critic for Time magazine.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Anthony Lane begins his vast and welcome collection of movie and book
reviews with these words: "You are holding a hunk of old journalism.
The prospect is not immediately appealing. Who, like Oliver Twist,
will have either the nerve or the appetite to ask for more?"</LD>
<LD>   Good question. And Lane answers it with becoming modesty. Mostly,
he suggests, the pleasure of revisiting old pieces--especially ones
about the movies--is reserved to their author, affectionately shaking
his head over his hasty considerations of objects no one in his right
mind could possibly still care about and may even have already
forgotten, just a few years after they appeared.</LD>
<LD>   That, of course, is the curse of the movie reviewer, launching his
opinions into the gales of hype that bluster about the typically
overproduced, under-thought Hollywood "product." Or, even worse,
pushing them off into that Sargasso Sea of indifference that nowadays
becalms the voyages of what we used to (rather touchingly) call art
films. Let's put the point bluntly: Reviewing movies is neither a
literary activity nor a branch of moral philosophy, much as some of
its stuffier practitioners would like to think. It is, I think, a
form of performance art.</LD>
<TE>   As Lane says in his introduction, "of all the duties required of
the professional critic, perhaps the least important--certainly the
least enduring--is the delivery of a verdict." History, as he
obviously knows, eventually delivers that verdict. The old movies we
return to with anticipatory pleasure (and retrospective reward) very
often turn out to be the ones that, at the time of their release,
were treated with indifference, if not downright contempt, by
reviewers and public alike. As Lane says, the best the reviewer can
do, aside from giving his readers a sense of a film's "texture," is
begin an argument that--if the film has any staying power at
all--will continue to echo faintly down through the decades.</TE>
<TE>   This being the case, what we want from a reviewer, writing in the
heat of the moment, is wit, style, grace of expression--a dance to
the music someone has decided to play at the moment Lane or anyone
else is confronting his deadline that is in itself as amusing (or
more so) than its ostensible subject. Here, of course, we confront
the regularly appearing reviewer's second curse. He has only a
limited choice of subject matter. He can write only about what's on
offer. He cannot review the ideal movie that exists only in his
wistful imagination. Or in the supposedly golden past. He has no
choice--God help him--but to say something readable about, say,
"Forrest Gump" or "Braveheart" or "Tom &amp; Viv."</TE>
<TE>   This is what Lane does, in my opinion, better than anyone else
right now. I skim a lot of movie reviews, but Lane's are the only
ones I read closely. And all the way to the end. This is not a habit,
I gather, that is widely shared among our critical colleagues or that
dwindling band of cinephiles who still (mis)understand reviewing to
be a serious and consequential activity, worthy of their anxious
attention. The book on Lane is that he is light-minded and perhaps
not as well grounded in cinema history as he might be.</TE>
<TE>   This is, of course, nonsense; it is, I suppose, the price he pays
for writing extraordinarily well, for wearing his erudition so
lightly, for refusing to see Hollywood as crassly determined to rot
the world's teeth for capital gain. And, of course, for being English
and a cheeky kid besides (he is 40 this year and has had his New
Yorker job since he was 31). But you have only to read his longer
considerations of Buster Keaton, Alfred Hitchcock or Robert Bresson
to see that he knows his subject as well as anyone (it has become in
recent decades too vast for anyone to know all about its every
aspect). And you have only to read the literary essays, with which
this collection is generously stocked, to understand that he is
capable of broad, yet nuanced, critical gestures: See, for example,
his brilliant defense of the currently unfashionable T.S. Eliot. No
movie bozo I know of could pull off this sort of writing without
looking like either a pompous twit or a hopeless overreacher.</TE>
<TE>   Lane's most basic critical device is to introduce a note of
observed, often quotidian, reality into his considerations of a
supposedly fanciful medium. In a plot summary of "Lock, Stock and Two
Smoking Barrels," for instance, one finds this deliciously sly
sentence: "At this point they overhear--as one so often does--a gang
of uglies next door discussing a forthcoming drug heist." Or,
praising the reality of Roger Michell's excellent adaptation of
"Persuasion," he makes this observation about the heroine's
helter-skelter hairdo: "For those reared on Merchant Ivory films, it
could come as a shock to realize that styling mousse was not
available over the counter in 1814." It seems to me that these
throwaway lines (and there are hundreds of them in this book) come
close to capturing the mood in which most people approach the movies:
eager to be transported yet painfully alert to those
carelessnesses--of performance, art direction, costuming--that
interrupt the purr of our romantic reveries and set us to wondering
where we ought to have dinner.</TE>
<TE>   Movies are, in and of themselves, only rarely complicated; they
remain the most readily approachable and easily apprehended
expressive form. What's grown complicated about them is our responses
to them. Lane understands that everyone--not just reviewers--has by
now seen far too many movies, that they are the wallpaper of our
minds and that once knowingness of them becomes instinctive, we
are--those of us who are over 14 and still faithful in our
devotions--tough sells. A good instance of what I'm talking about
occurs in Lane's review of "Saving Private Ryan." He understands that
the heart of its originality after all those decades of improbable
wartime heroics lies in the antiheroic ferocity and clarity of its
combat sequences. He is full of (entirely correct) praise for them.
Yet he remains sweetly unwilling to abandon his childish affection
for "Where Eagles Dare," in which "Richard Burton took a rockbound
Bavarian fortress with the calmness that comes only to those who have
previously stormed Elizabeth Taylor." See? There's all this weird
stuff in our heads when we go to the movies, and the reviewer had
better be aware of it.</TE>
<TE>   Lane likes clarity in movies, particularly the action variety. It
is one of the few principles he keeps returning to. He understands
that an exploding fireball--even one that threatens civilization as
we know it--is not action. It is idle sensation, lacking the
intricacy of preparation and mastery of technique that someone like
the late John Frankenheimer brought to the brilliant car chases of
"Ronin." But mostly Lane avoids theory, both aesthetic and
sociological. He deals strictly with what is in front of his eyes and
doesn't give a hoot for speculation about what unknowable forces
shaped (or misshaped) the object in question. Who will ever be able
to sort that out, given the hysterical communality and craven market
calculations that condition most movie production?</TE>
<TE>   This definitively sets him apart from his sainted New Yorker
predecessor, Pauline Kael, to whom he is occasionally invidiously
compared. She, too, was a terrific performer but one with a number of
not-so-hidden agendas. Large among them was a belief that Hollywood
was irretrievably corrupt. "Whorish" (and its many variants) was a
word often on her lips, reform a possibility much on her mind. This
was a feckless hope and one that, in some ways, made her a slightly
risible figure, a lonely defender of a cultural purity that was
surely not to be found in the collected works of her favorites like
the inconsequential Irvin Kershner. Or in the blighted late career of
San Peckinpah, whose alcoholic dysfunctions she often mistook for
revolutionary acts.</TE>
<TE>   I prefer a critic who takes things as they come: one at a time,
alert to their accidental felicities, good-naturedly witty about
their much more common failings, resistant to gaseous (and
unprovable) generalizations. These qualities make Lane's occasional
angry outbursts (see him on "The Phantom Menace") the more powerful.
Lane is not a perfect critic; I cannot, for the life of me understand
his affection for "Titanic" or his tolerance for "Apocalypse Now."
But "right" or "wrong," he is a pure pleasure to read. And that is
the critic's first--and most often failed--obligation.</TE>

<HD>Family Secrets</HD>
<DH>CASA ROSSA: A Novel, By Francesca Marciano Pantheon: 352
pp., $25</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WENDY SMITH</AU>
<BD>Wendy Smith is the author of "Real-Life Drama: The
Group Theatre and America, 1931-1940."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With her first novel "Rules of the Wild," the story of a woman torn
between two men in Kenya's white expatriate community, Italian writer
Francesca Marciano garnered critical praise for her elegant, eloquent
prose and for placing the romance within a political context.
Marciano displays both those gifts in her second work of fiction, a
tale of family secrets and sorrows centered on a farmhouse in
southern Italy.</LD>
<LD>   Sexual and political betrayal intertwine, and the passion for
social justice springs from personal wounds. "Casa Rossa" is notable
for its rueful understanding of the volatile mix of emotions that
binds us to those we love.</LD>
<LD>   Alina Strada wanders through the rooms of her childhood home, Casa
Rossa, just after it has been sold. She has returned to pack up its
contents before the movers arrive. The sale acknowledges what
preceded it: a series of departures and losses prompted by "a secret,
an unspoken legacy" that Alina believes has crippled her; her mother,
Alba; and her older sister, Isabella.</LD>
<TE>   Sensitive, introspective Alina has unfinished business with her
family's past, and we see her sorting it out over the course of a
narrative that skillfully interweaves her present-day, present-tense
narration with three generations of Strada history.</TE>
<TE>   Alina's grandfather, Lorenzo, a mediocre painter supported by the
income from his family's marble quarries in Carrara, buys Casa Rossa
in the late 1920s. Obsessively in love with Renee, the Tunisian
beauty he met and married in France, he plans to transform the
crumbling farmhouse into "a place our children will be able to call
home." But Renee is oppressed both by his possessiveness and by a
region whose rural poverty is far too reminiscent of her North
African youth; she flees in the summer of 1940 to spend the rest of
her life with a wealthy German woman.</TE>
<TE>   Devastated and vengeful, Lorenzo makes Casa Rossa his retreat from
the world. Alba, 5 years old when her mother leaves, grows up
isolated in a remote, backward village. "She was different from every
other child she knew," Alina comments. "She grew up awkward and
moody."</TE>
<TE>   Alba will never be entirely at home in the world or with other
people, but after she meets sensitive Roman screenwriter Oliviero on
a train heading south in the summer of 1958, his love for a while
fills the void in the heart of this aloof yet burningly lonely young
woman.</TE>
<TE>   Although Lorenzo, Renee and Oliviero loom large in these pages,
their stories are backdrops for the primal drama of the struggles
among Alba, Alina and Isabella, whose very different personalities
shape their responses to the troubled family legacy incarnated in the
stones of Casa Rossa.</TE>
<TE>   Strong, fearless and angry, Isabella joins one of the armed
radical groups tearing apart Italian society in the late 1970s.
Alina, two years younger, is quieter and less confrontational; she
dulls the pain of her father's death and her mother's remoteness with
drugs. "Typical you--to choose anesthesia over facing the truth,"
sneers Isabella, who goes underground just before Alina sobers up and
heads to New York, where she falls in love with magazine writer
Daniel Moore.</TE>
<TE>   Their affair points to the gulf between Europeans' ingrained
knowledge of ethical ambiguities and Americans' more black-and-white
notions of morality, though this contrast is somewhat over-explained
and over-schematized (his shock when she tells him that Isabella has
been arrested for the murder of a magistrate seems implausibly naive
for a journalist). Isabella's trial draws Alina back to Rome; the
sisters' awkward reconciliation is moving, as is Alina's newly mature
understanding of their mother's faults. But when Daniel turns up in
Italy, then betrays Alina in the most fundamental way, he acts more
as a plot device than as a believable human being.</TE>
<TE>   Happily, the Italian actors in this drama remain credible and
complex, even if Marciano does tie up the loose threads in their
lives a little too neatly. (Isabella in particular is more than amply
punished for her failures as a sister and a citizen.) As the novel
moves toward its rain-soaked denouement, the author's affection for
her characters redeems her habit of making her themes unnecessarily
explicit. The nude fresco of Renee, whitewashed by shocked villagers
in Chapter 1 only to reemerge during a storm on Alba's and Alina's
last morning at Casa Rossa, may be a trifle obvious as a symbol, but
the laughter it provokes rings true as mother and daughter finally
find their way into each other's arms.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From `The Book of Illusions'</TE>
<TE>   We all want to believe in impossible things, I suppose, to
persuade ourselves that miracles can happen. Considering that I was
the author of the only book ever written on Hector Mann, it probably
made sense that someone would think I'd jump at the chance to believe
he was still alive. But I wasn't in the mood to jump. Or at least I
didn't think I was. My book had been born out of a great sorrow, and
now that the book was behind me, the sorrow was still there. Writing
about comedy had been no more than a pretext, an odd form of medicine
that I had swallowed every day for over a year on the off chance that
it would dull the pain inside me. To some extent, it did. But Frieda
Spelling (or whoever was posing as Frieda Spelling) couldn't have
known that. She couldn't have known that on June 7, 1985, just one
week short of my tenth wedding anniversary, my wife and two sons had
been killed in a plane crash. She might have seen that the book was
dedicated to them (For Helen, Todd, and Marco--In Memory), but those
names couldn't have meant anything to her ....Every time I open a
drawer or look in the back of an armoire, some new discovery stuns
me. I keep turning between my fingers what I have just found, as if
expecting it to talk to me. An old dusty ribbon (a hat? gift
wrapping?), a newspaper clipping from the '50s, the obituary page
(whose death are we looking at here?) a single light-blue silk shoe,
custom-made in Paris (Renee's?) ....</TE>
<TE>   It's like trying to trace the history of an Egyptian mummy from
her ring, a few glass beads, bits of broken pottery, a faded
inscription. Yes, she was a merchant's wife--no, a pharaoh's sister,
or maybe a high priestess. History demands a plot with a proper
beginning and a proper end.</TE>
<TE>   This is not a story about what we know, not about what we have.</TE>
<TE>   This is about what gets lost on the way.</TE>

<HD>When Sex Was Innocent, Sweet and Seductive</HD>
<DH>BERNARD OF HOLLYWOOD: The Ultimate Pin-up Book, By Susan
Bernard, Taschen: 360 pp., $40</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>Kevin Thomas is a film critic for The Times.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An exuberant Marilyn Monroe, her white pleated skirt billowing up to
her face in a blast of steam from a New York sidewalk grate, is one
of the most indelible images of the 20th century, shot during the
production of Billy Wilder's "The Seven Year Itch." The photo was
taken by the late Bruno Bernard, who through his lengthy and
glittering career was known as "The King of Hollywood Glamour" and
"The Vargas of Pinup Photography." He was also called "The Discoverer
of Marilyn Monroe," and though others have made that claim in various
contexts, Bernard recalled that while he was shooting Monroe on "The
Seven Year Itch" set in 1954, she said to him, "Remember, Bernie, you
started it all."</LD>
<LD>   Considering that he had started photographing her when she was
still Norma Jean Dougherty, it could be true. Of gorgeous and
ambitious unknowns like Norma Jean, Bernard once remarked, "The best
friend that these young girls had, next to a diamond, was a glamour
photographer."</LD>
<TE>   Early photos of Monroe--rarely seen before--are some of the many
delights of "Bernard of Hollywood: The Ultimate Pin-up Book," a
superbly produced 350-page book by Bernard's daughter, Susan Bernard.
She spent four years culling 30,000 negatives to make her selections,
which in many instances are accompanied by captions from their
subjects, remembering what Bernard and his photo sessions were like
and what impact they had on their careers. (Actress Mamie Van Doren
remembered the handsome, silver-haired Bernard as a gentleman.)</TE>
<TE>   Bernard has written a thoughtful essay, tracing her father's life
as a refugee from Hitler's Germany to his success in Hollywood's
Golden Era and surveying his major contributions to it. In 1984,
Bernard was the first still photographer to be honored by the Academy
of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.</TE>
<TE>   Bernard's tribute to her father's art has arrived at the right
time for it to be fully appreciated. At the height of the women's
liberation movement, many were tempted to dismiss cheesecake as
merely sexually exploitative. Enough time has also passed so that the
obvious posing, come-hither looks and physical perfection of the
models and their sometimes kitschy decor and accessories are more
easily seen as period conventions, allowing the subjects' timeless
beauty and glamour to shine through.</TE>
<TE>   No less than Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower praised Bernard's pinups,
and when--incredibly--Bernard had to fight an obscenity charge all
the way to the U.S. Supreme Court in the early 1950s, he submitted in
his defense a letter from the Secretary of Defense thanking him for
the morale-building effect of his pinups. Bernard makes the
common-sensical case for seeing her father's work and that of other
pinup photographers and artists, including her father's friend
Alberto Vargas, as celebrating and empowering women rather than
exploiting them.</TE>
<TE>   Carole Kismaric, curator of the Museum of Modern Art's "Fame After
Photography," wrote in its catalog, "Bernard had a way of making his
subjects seem more human [than other pinup photographers]. When you
see his pictures, you want to stop and look at them because of the
obvious connection between the subject and the camera."</TE>
<TE>   Bernard believes her father "derived his insights into the human
condition partly from his astonishing courage in facing the huge
challenges of his early life." There is in Bernard's pinups an
exuberant sexuality that is both innocent and mischievous, seductive
yet sweet. Surely, it was the rapport that Bernard had with movie
stars and models alike that yielded these wonderful combinations.</TE>
<TE>   Bernard rose above the more prurient obsessions of of his
contemporaries and did not believe in retouching. Only one photo in
this book--that of a naked model holding a silvery bolt of lightning
between her legs--seems over the top. But this is the amusing
exception to the rule; even in the most obviously contrived shots,
Bernard's subjects look like real women.</TE>
<TE>   Though Bernard was a photographer of stars and starlets, he also
worked with dancers, strippers and professional models and was a
celebrity portrait photographer, shooting men--Gregory Peck, for
one--as well as women. His artistic muse was the late, legendary
striptease artist Lili St. Cyr, a willowy long-stemmed beauty of wit
and elegance, a stunner with a sense of humor. St. Cyr was one of
Bernard's more spectacular subjects and, along with Monroe, has a
chapter of the book devoted to her. Among many other starlets, the
book features shots of Laurette Luez, bringing back fond memories of
her as one of the lushest brunets on the screen in the late '40s and
early '50s.</TE>
<TE>   At the height of his career, Bernard added to his landmark Sunset
Strip salon studios in Laguna Beach, Las Vegas--just as it was
becoming an entertainment capital--and in Palms Springs at the
Racquet Club, then the favorite retreat for Hollywood's top stars. At
the Racquet Club he was able to photograph such stars as Lucille Ball
at play, and in Las Vegas, he had a special arrangement with fellow
Berliner Marlene Dietrich, who declared, "Only Bernie is allowed to
shoot me in Vegas."</TE>
<TE>   Bruno Bernard Sommerfeld was born in poverty in Berlin in 1911.
While his father, although he had acute asthma and poor vision, was
serving in World War I, his mother got up at 5 every morning to sell
shoelaces, soap and chocolate in prisoner-of-war camps in a losing
struggle to support her four children. When her health collapsed, her
children became welfare cases. It took her six months to regain
custody of them, yet her failing health and that of her husband, now
returned from war, caused Bruno and his siblings to be sent off to
different orphanages.</TE>
<TE>   Yet his parents instilled in their eldest child the importance of
striving for a university education, and Bernard in 1934 was one of
the very few Jews who received a doctorate at Kiel University, where
he studied criminal law but was drawn to the arts, to acting in
particular.</TE>
<TE>   But Bernard's activism in a Jewish youth organization after the
advent of the Third Reich landed him on a Gestapo blacklist and
forced him to emigrate. It was agent Paul Kohner, who helped so many
Europeans flee the rise of Hitler and reestablish themselves in
Hollywood, who took notice of Bernard's work when Bernard opened his
first studio in 1940 on Robertson Boulevard; Kohner sent him clients,
thus bringing him to the attention of the motion picture industry.</TE>
<TE>   According to his daughter, Bernard considered the suicide of
Marilyn Monroe in 1962 as the end of an era for Hollywood glamour and
closed shop. He returned to Berlin and embarked on a radically
different career in photojournalism, a highlight of which was
covering the trial of Adolf Eichmann for Der Spiegel. From this
experience, he published his "Israel: Bernard's Photographic
Impressions," after which he retired to Palma de Mallorca, where he
died in 1987.</TE>

<HD>At Cambridge, a Clash Over Who Owns Ideas</HD>
<DH>Education: University wants to adopt U.S. custom of sharing
profits from faculty inventions. Opponents say it could stifle
innovation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETH GARDINER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>In the quiet halls of Cambridge University, a distinctly 21st-century
battle is brewing over a question that has vexed academic
institutions around the world. Who owns faculty members' ideas --
some of them very profitable?</LD>
<LD>   Cambridge has angered some of its professors by proposing a very
American notion: that it should hold the rights and patents to all
the concepts and inventions they create. Critics say taking control
away from researchers could corrupt the university's mission by
putting the profit motive ahead of a traditional focus on advancing
the frontiers of knowledge and contributing to the public good.</LD>
<LD>   The plan's opponents -- many of them computer and biotechnology
researchers who've made handsome profits from their work -- also warn
that the change could remove the incentive to innovate and squelch a
university-led boom that has made the Cambridge area Britain's
high-tech center.</LD>
<TE>   "Effectively, our ideas would no longer be our own but would
belong to the university," said Mike Clark, a lecturer in pathology.</TE>
<TE>   "We may be forced to maximize our profit in the short term even
though that may not be in the benefit of society in the long term. I
don't think universities should think that way."</TE>
<TE>   The university says the change would be fairer than the current
system, which gives Cambridge ownership of results from research
funded by private groups and some government departments while
letting faculty hold the rights to work funded by a larger public
grant program. "What the university is looking to do is put all staff
on equal footing," said Simon Jones, head of research collaborations.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents say the change would move Cambridge from being one of
the country's most generous universities on intellectual property to
one of those that holds rights most tightly. Jones said it would
bring the rules in line with those at most other British
universities.</TE>
<TE>   If the proposal passes -- faculty members are to consider it in
October -- the university would, as of next year, hold all rights
stemming from work that staffers do on the job, with the exception of
written material like books and articles.</TE>
<TE>   Faculty members would keep 90% of the first 20,000 pounds
($30,000) that their idea makes, a share that declines as the profits
increase, down to a third of income above 100,000 pounds ($150,000).</TE>
<TE>   "It's killing the goose that lays the golden eggs," said Ross
Anderson, a computer science don leading the fight against the plan.
"The university will ... have its hand in our pocket and it's
outrageous."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson credits the university's traditionally liberal approach
to patent rights with helping make it a center for cutting-edge
research and fueling the area's slew of start-up technology
companies, many partly founded by Cambridge dons.</TE>
<TE>   He predicted that some faculty members dependent on outside income
would quit right away.</TE>
<TE>   "The economic effects will take a longer time to work themselves
out.... There just won't be as much business formation."</TE>
<TE>   The university disagrees, saying that although the current system
provides some incentives, there is too little support for academics
trying to navigate the business world. Under the new plan, it
promises to provide more help.</TE>
<TE>   In Britain and the United States, universities eager to bolster
their budgets have jealously eyed the profits of professors, mostly
in the sciences, who've found market applications for their work.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly all American universities keep ownership of patents on
inventions created at their schools, while sharing any royalties with
the inventor. A 1980 U.S. law enables them to retain ownership of
inventions created by their scholars with federal funds. U.S. schools
hold 13,000 patents, which earned them $1.26 billion in royalties in
2000, according to the Assn. of University Technology Managers.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford, for one, owns nearly all patents granted to inventions
made in its lab and last year reaped $41.2 million in royalties, said
Katharine Ku, the school's director of technology transfer. Stanford
keeps a third of the royalties, its inventors get one-third and the
inventors' departments receive the rest. Other U.S. schools are less
generous to the inventors.</TE>
<TE>   At Cambridge, some dons fear that taking away researchers' control
over their work would make it impossible for them to share ideas
freely and make sure they're used in the way that benefits the most
people.</TE>
<TE>   Cambridge promises that it will not commercialize an idea against
the will of its originator.</TE>

<HD>Preserving Horrid History Becomes Man's Obsession</HD>
<DH>River Kwai: An Australian seeks to memorialize the 'Death
Railway,' which Japan forced Allied POWs and Asian slaves to build
during World War II.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENIS D. GRAY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>ALONG DEATH RAILWAY, Thailand</DL>
<LD>Leaves of teak trees rustle in the moist wind. Smiling villagers tend
papaya, pineapples and bananas in neat patches. Below the cliff, the
River Kwai sweeps grandly around a bend.</LD>
<LD>   A soothing landscape -- for all but Rod Beattie, striding over the
field, pointing and intensely conjuring up hellish scenes of six
decades ago.</LD>
<LD>   "Here was the isolation area where they came to die," Beattie
says. Their withered bodies were cremated where the teak trees stand.
There was the cookhouse, the tents, the garbage dump. Here is where
Ray Parkin -- an Australian writer who later recounted his wartime
life -- spliced the wire on the funicular that drew water from the
river.</LD>
<TE>   This now tranquil place was once Hin Tok River Camp, among a
number that held skeletal Allied prisoners of war and Asian slave
workers who labored on the "Death Railway" for the Japanese army.</TE>
<TE>   This infamous episode of World War II has become an obsession and
a mission for Beattie, a 54-year-old Australian who wasn't born until
three years after the war ended.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last eight years, on his own time and money, he has
trekked more than 1,240 miles along its length, producing a detailed
map and almost single-handedly clearing thick jungle from a five-mile
section with a machete and saw.</TE>
<TE>   Scouring the region with a metal detector and shovel, he has
unearthed thousands of relics -- buckles, insignia, tools, train
parts and some poignant articles like a porcelain figure of the
Chinese goddess of compassion found at a cremation site. Or a
handmade tobacco tin with a heart for "Mum," the dead soldier's name
and a plea: "Oi, I'm empty. Please fill."</TE>
<TE>   Some of these relics will be displayed at a museum in
Kanchanaburi, about 70 miles west of Bangkok, which Beattie and four
colleagues plan to open by the end of 2002 after four years of effort
financed from their own pockets.</TE>
<TE>   The museum, Beattie says, will in graphic, non-nationalistic terms
show the Japanese feat of laying 250 miles of track through the
jungles and hills of Thailand and Myanmar.</TE>
<TE>   And it will detail the price paid: more than 12,000 of some 60,000
Allied POWs and as many as half of the 200,000 Asian laborers dead,
mostly from diseases compounded by brutal working conditions.</TE>
<TE>   The harrowing story of the Death Railway has been depicted in a
number of books and a 1957 Academy Award-winning movie, "The Bridge
on the River Kwai," which starred Alec Guinness and William Holden.</TE>
<TE>   Beattie is painstakingly sifting through memoirs, archives and
personal interviews with survivors to compile a computer database
that will eventually include 40,000 POWs who died while working on
the railway or in captivity afterward.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, the daughter of Australian Pvt. Jack McCarthy came to
learn more about her father. From the database, Beattie was able to
tell her that McCarthy died at Linson Camp of beriberi and malaria on
July 21, 1943. He pinpointed the initial burial site and took her to
her father's final grave, a simple headstone adorned with a single
red poppy.</TE>
<TE>   "There is so much to do and so little time. My most precious
resource is dying -- the POWs," Beattie said in his office flanking
one of two Allied war cemeteries in Thailand. The youngest ex-POW he
knows is 77.</TE>
<TE>   Many aging survivors or their kin -- British, Australians, New
Zealanders, Americans, Canadians, Dutch and others -- still make the
pilgrimage to Thailand.</TE>
<TE>   Beattie tells of an Australian who was 2 when his father died on
the railway and whose widowed mother had constantly reminded him that
he would never measure up to his almost mythic dad. Beattie found the
son a thoroughly unpleasant person but took him to the spot where his
father died. The man returned months later, bringing his daughter,
and Beattie said he came back transformed into a warm, sensitive
individual.</TE>
<TE>   "It's wonderful to be able to help those people to find peace,"
Beattie said. "You have to be personally involved to know that what
happened so long ago is still having an effect, not only on the few
surviving wives, but on their children and grandchildren."</TE>
<TE>   Beattie's passion was kindled in 1994, five years after coming to
Kanchanaburi to work as a consultant to a sapphire-mining company.
Earlier, the native of Gympie, Queensland, had studied civil
engineering, built roads, and run a gem-cutting and selling
enterprise.</TE>
<TE>   That year, he volunteered to clear the encroaching jungle around
Hellfire Pass, where some 400 POWs died cutting through sheer rock,
and was hired to build a museum at the site.</TE>
<TE>   After each conversation with a visiting POW, after every bend in
the railway line, Beattie's curiosity grew. He decided that he would
explore the entire line in Thailand.</TE>
<TE>   Beattie continued to work in the gem business to support his
Vietnamese wife, Thuy, and their three young daughters, but spent
more and more time on the railway. In 1995, the Commonwealth War
Graves Commission put him in charge of caring for the two cemeteries
in Thailand.</TE>
<TE>   "It's personal," he said when asked why he has become so involved.</TE>
<TE>   His grandfather served in World War I. His father was wounded
twice in World War II, and six of his seven uncles fought in that
conflict.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes I wish I could just walk away from it. I could make a
whole lot more money doing gemstones full time -- and fishing four to
five days a week," Beattie said.</TE>
<TE>   "But I am the product of my mother and father. They both dedicated
their lives to community service and I guess I inherited it all."</TE>

<HD>Sweden Confronts High Cost of Welfare State</HD>
<DH>Health: One of every six working-age Swedes is off work
because of illness or injury. Upcoming election focuses on issue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KARL RITTER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>STOCKHOLM, Sweden</DL>
<LD>Sweden exudes good health and well-being in summer. The air smells of
pine trees, and people of all ages bicycle and stroll well after
dinner under the late-setting sun.</LD>
<LD>   But as Swedes return from country cottages and Mediterranean
beaches and prepare for an election Sept. 15, they are grappling with
a vexing problem: one of every six working-age Swedes is off work
because of illness or injury.</LD>
<LD>   The number of people on government-paid sick leave has doubled in
five years, and welfare benefits for the sick and disabled now exceed
the government's military and education budgets combined.</LD>
<TE>   In all, about 340,000 Swedes -- one in every 26 of a population of
8.9 million -- are getting sick pay from the National Social
Insurance Board, a third for longer than a year.</TE>
<TE>   An additional 470,000 are on disability pensions --
early-retirement benefits paid by the government to those who stop
working before the age of 65. These often are bigger than regular
pensions.</TE>
<TE>   Sick Swedes -- and what makes them sick -- are one of the main
election issues.</TE>
<TE>   The governing center-left Social Democratic Party, seeking to
extend an eight-year spell in office, has commissioned studies and
written reports saying that job conditions are getting harder and
more stressful.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents, led by the center-right Moderate and Christian
Democratic parties, say the government is looking for a cure in all
the wrong places. The problem, they say, is not workers' health but
cushy welfare policies that are eroding the work ethic.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the explanation, the cost -- about $12 billion a year, or
16% of this year's national budget -- worries officials.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we can accept any higher costs. Then we risk having
to change compensation levels, and the sickness insurance loses its
function and legitimacy," said Rolf Lundgren, chief economic analyst
at the National Social Insurance Board, which picks up the tab from
the employer after a worker's second week of sickness.</TE>
<TE>   Sweden has long been viewed as a model welfare state,
characterized by high taxes, extensive government benefits, and a
relatively narrow gap between rich and poor.</TE>
<TE>   Although social benefits were scaled back somewhat during a
recession in the mid-1990s, subsidized health care and compensation
for unemployment or parental leave remain in place. The system is
financed by some of the highest taxes in the world on income, wealth,
property and purchases.</TE>
<TE>   Sick leave amounts to 80% of a worker's pay. The maximum benefit
is 623 kronor a day, or about $65. After taxes, that adds up to about
$1,500 a month -- about what many workers get for four 40-hour weeks.
Sick leave pay is subject to income tax, which ranges from 30% to
60%.</TE>
<TE>   Workers who have taken time off contend that the pressures and
strains of the job are legitimate reasons for going on sick leave.</TE>
<TE>   "The wheels are spinning too quickly," said Anna Eriksson, 29, a
nurse who took off two months last year, calling herself burned out.
"The working environment simply has become tougher. You have to do
twice the work you did before."</TE>
<TE>   Anbritt Ludvigsson, a 60-year-old payroll administrator who has
been on paid leave for 18 months, said a combination of family
problems and a heavy workload disabled her.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't log onto the computer. I had forgotten everything,"
she recalled, struggling to hold back tears.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of the generous policies say that paid sick leave has
come to be seen as an entitlement rather than a benefit and that
frivolous claims are partly to blame for the abrupt rise in sick
leave claims since 1997, when only about 170,000 Swedes received such
payments.</TE>
<TE>   Swedes "need to be pampered, placed on treadmills and surrounded
by fruit baskets to cope with work," book publisher Helena Riviere
wrote in an opinion article for the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet.</TE>
<TE>   Riviere said the generous leave policies invite people to abuse
the system simply because they're "fed up with work or dissatisfied
with their lives in general."</TE>
<TE>   A recent survey of 2,000 Swedes by the polling institute Temo
found that 60% believe that it's acceptable to call in sick for
reasons other than illness -- for family problems or stress, for
example.</TE>
<TE>   "If people continue using sickness compensation like this, there
won't be much left over for those who really are sick," said Eric
Jannerfeldt, a spokesman for the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise,
which represents employers.</TE>
<TE>   The business group estimates the value of lost man-hours at $16
billion a year.</TE>
<TE>   Economists Magnus Henrekson and Mats Persson say the high sick pay
may be part of the problem. In an article for an academic journal,
they linked variations in sick leave over the last five decades to
changes in the compensation system.</TE>
<TE>   Their theory doesn't explain why sick leave numbers started
growing in 1997 after a steady decline in most of the '90s. But
Henrekson and Persson note that the surge intensified in 1998 after
the Social Democratic government raised compensation levels to 80% of
wages from 75%.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing is certain. When you raise compensation levels, more
people take advantage of the system," Henrekson said.</TE>
<TE>   Sick leave also is high in neighboring Norway, which has higher
compensation than Sweden.</TE>
<TE>   However, it's lower in Denmark and Finland, where compensation is
less generous. Other European countries report lower rates than
Sweden, but direct comparisons are difficult because of variations in
data.</TE>
<TE>   Labor Minister Mona Sahlin blames the problem on too much work and
too few workers. She says job cuts and restructuring throughout the
Swedish economy during the recession in the early 1990s increased the
strains on workers.</TE>
<TE>   Other experts concur that an aging work force, economic
globalization and public-sector cutbacks explain some of the surge in
sick leave claims.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Sweden remains a world leader in labor safety and social
welfare. Most employees have a 40-hour week -- and get overtime if
they work more -- and the law guarantees five weeks of vacation a
year.</TE>
<TE>   Work-related deaths are among the lowest in the world, and
workplace safety is closely monitored. Life expectancy has increased
over the last decade by 2.5 years for men, to 76.9, and by 1.6 years
for women, to 81.8.</TE>
<TE>   "They really take care of you here," said Samantha Budd, a British
researcher who works for drug maker AstraZeneca in Soedertaelje,
south of Stockholm. Her move to Sweden from the United States allowed
her more time off, a slower work pace and ergonomic office furniture
tailored to her body.</TE>
<TE>   "If it has slipped in standards, what was there before? It's hard
to imagine," she said.</TE>

<HD>Tokyo Swelters in 'Heat Island' Pressure Cooker</HD>
<DH>Climate: A high population, along with cars, computers and
air conditioners, are linked to the weather trend.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC TALMADGE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>It isn't just the heat, or the humidity.</LD>
<LD>   Tokyo has become so crowded that scientists say the accumulated
heat from all the human activity is changing local weather patterns
-- a sort of global warming but on the scale of a single city.</LD>
<LD>   In Japan's capital, morning fog has become a thing of the past.
Evening thunderstorms, once a symbol of summer, are now more likely
to come well after dark, or before dawn. Downpours are harder and
more frequent. And calls for help are steadily rising.</LD>
<TE>   "We are seeing more than just an increase in temperatures," said
Shuhei Akashi, head of the weather consultation department of Japan's
Central Meteorological Agency. "It is changing rain patterns and
humidity as well."</TE>
<TE>   The warming of Tokyo, often to several degrees hotter than the
surrounding countryside, is part of a phenomenon called "heat island"
that scientists say is affecting the weather of cities throughout the
globe -- from Toronto to Los Angeles to Shanghai.</TE>
<TE>   Heat islands are the result of high concentrations of people.</TE>
<TE>   The sheer number of their cars and air conditioners, which pump
out hot air and greenhouse gases, lifts temperatures higher than the
surrounding areas. Computers and other electrical devices in office
buildings add more heat. Asphalt and concrete contribute because they
absorb heat from the sun, while the lack of greenery means less shade
and cooling water that can be evaporated into the air.</TE>
<TE>   Tokyo is a showcase of how heat island can make its mark on a
city.</TE>
<TE>   Although last summer was relatively mild, Tokyo had a record 67
days in 2000 that hit 87 degrees or higher. Its population of about
12 million also sweated through 41 nights that year in which the
temperatures exceeded 77 degrees. A decade earlier, there were only
23.</TE>
<TE>   The nighttime figures are seen as particularly alarming. If the
heat doesn't let up much even at night, there is less relief for the
sweltering masses and more demand for energy, which can create a
vicious cycle.</TE>
<TE>   "The nights are really unpleasant," said Junko Nakajima, 26, an
office worker who unlike most Tokyo residents prefers not to use
air-conditioning. "Sometimes when it's really bad, I put a cold, wet
towel on my bed and sleep on that."</TE>
<TE>   The warming trend poses a significant health risk for the elderly,
the very young, asthmatics and others vulnerable to sustained heat.</TE>
<TE>   The number of ambulances sent to help people suffering from heat
sickness rose from just over 100 in 1985 to 628 last year, according
to statistics compiled by the Tokyo Fire Department. In 2000, 207
people in Tokyo died of heat-related causes, up from 152 in 1996, the
Labor Ministry says.</TE>
<TE>   This summer has been better. In early July, 15 people were given
emergency treatment, about half the number treated at the same time
last year. But that was when Tokyo was still officially in the rainy
season.</TE>
<TE>   In August, the city's highs averaged just under 87, in line with
its 30-year average.</TE>
<TE>   The warming trend isn't only felt in the summer.</TE>
<TE>   According to the weather agency, the number of days when the Tokyo
temperature dropped below freezing has fallen from an average of 53 a
year in the 1930s to just three in 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   And there are other, invisible dangers.</TE>
<TE>   The combination of heat and sunlight can lead to an increase in
ground-level ozone, which -- although beneficial when it is high in
the stratosphere -- is a pollutant that can threaten health.</TE>
<TE>   To fight the heat, Tokyo and other Japanese cities are encouraging
builders to put rooftop gardens into the blueprints for major new
projects. A proposal to bury cooling pipes under streets is also
being considered.</TE>

<DH>Rehabilitation: Juvenile offenders plant trees, clear
brush and maintain trails while training in Washington state to fight
wildfires.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REBECCA COOK</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>NASELLE, Wash.</DL>
<LD>Crystal Horne has been burned before. The quarter-sized pink scars on
her left forearm testify to that.</LD>
<LD>   And, for a time, the 17-year-old girl with an anarchy-symbol
tattoo and flame-red hair seemed destined to burn out: drinking
heavily, dealing and using drugs, running from police.</LD>
<LD>   But when her bad deeds landed her in juvenile prison, she found a
calling that turned her stubborn energy into a saving grace:</LD>
<TE>   Fighting wildfires.</TE>
<TE>   Horne now leads an all-girl firefighting team of juvenile
offenders from Naselle Youth Camp, in the southwestern corner of
Washington state.</TE>
<TE>   There, car thieves and gang-bangers learn to put axes, shovels and
chain saws to good use. They plant trees, clear brush and maintain
trails while training for a big wildfire to fight.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, she and the other girls watched on TV as firefighters
battled fierce blazes in Oregon, Colorado and other Western states --
but not in Washington. They itched to prove themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "I like this," Horne said. "It's something I can say I did good
at."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The girls wake at 6:05 a.m. every weekday. Horne, her hair now
faded to its natural strawberry-blond, leaves a stuffed animal on her
bed and a "Chicken Soup for the Cat and Dog Lover's Soul" on her
desk.</TE>
<TE>   Waiting outside their dorm after breakfast, the sleepy girls
brighten as foreman Sid Hicklin ambles into view. Lanky and tan from
years in the sun, Hicklin worked in law enforcement before joining
the Department of Natural Resources.</TE>
<TE>   Supervising the girls is unlike any other job he's held.</TE>
<TE>   "They take everything I say to heart. I can't be so critical," he
said. "Some of their backgrounds are really devastating. You just
have to build them back up."</TE>
<TE>   He has learned a lot that they don't teach in forestry school. He
knows who's taking new medication, whose father just died, who's in
or out of the ever-shifting cliques. His daily log has such notes as,
"Girls are nit picky. Told them to work without talking."</TE>
<TE>   The one thing he doesn't know is what crimes the girls committed.
He says he never asks.</TE>
<TE>   When Hicklin stops the crew truck at an overgrown crossroads, the
girls climb out past a blue-and-gold decal on the door with the
words, "Hicklin's Angels."</TE>
<TE>   "Let's go," he calls to them. "Three saws this morning."</TE>
<TE>   New girls take awhile to build the muscle needed to cut trails,
saw branches and run chain saws.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't used to working that hard," said Cassandra Carey, 15.
"You start to get the hang of it and you start to get in shape. It
starts to build your self-esteem."</TE>
<TE>   Carey has earned a blue hat, a mark of leadership, while serving
time for possession of stolen property. It's the first time that
she's felt like a leader. Following her friends got her the gang
tattoo below her eye -- three dots for "mi vida loca," my crazy life
-- that she now wants removed.</TE>
<TE>   "I always feel stupid because I've committed crimes. I feel looked
down upon," she said. "You come here and it's like they don't even
care. You're working so hard, your mind just is free."</TE>
<TE>   She proudly remembers the time they cleaned a cemetery for some
elderly women who had been unable to do it themselves. Afterward,
they thanked the girls.</TE>
<TE>   "It's fun to do good once in a while," Carey said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Washington used to have several youth rehabilitation centers like
Naselle. But after years of budget cuts, Naselle is the only one
left. Naselle staff is nervous about next year's anticipated state
budget crisis.</TE>
<TE>   The camp has four boys' fire crews and one for girls. Everyone
else works too, whether in maintenance, the sign shop, the garden or
the fish farm. After work, they go to school and counseling.</TE>
<TE>   Supt. Thomas Quinn wants them to learn social responsibility. He
believes it sinks in. Last winter, the 150 inmates raised $3,000 to
"adopt" a local family for Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, a Naselle graduate called the camp, demanding to speak
to a boys' crew foreman. Sirens wailed in the background and everyone
assumed the worst.</TE>
<TE>   But the boy had become an emergency medical technician; he wanted
to thank the foreman.</TE>
<TE>   The fire-crew program has not been without problems. In June 2001,
two boys beat their foreman and left him for dead. Although severely
injured, he survived. Now, security staff accompany the crews.</TE>
<TE>   Generally, Hicklin trusts the girls until they give him reason not
to. In return, the girls adore Hicklin. He's like a father to them.
They notice how he talks about his wife and family with obvious love.</TE>
<TE>   "On the outs," their term for outside world, "you don't see a lot
of that," Horne said.</TE>
<TE>   The girls believe that Hicklin would never put them in danger --
even if they got their wish, the chance to work on a wildfire. They'd
get to leave the camp, sleep in tents and eat good food, maybe even
talk to boys. They'd also get paid, although not as much as
professional firefighters.</TE>
<TE>   Amy Earl, a sometimes surly 17-year-old from Tacoma, loves fire
crew. "I like knowing I'm saving people's lives," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She was charged with criminal assistance to murder after her
boyfriend killed a friend. The same boyfriend gave her three sexually
transmitted diseases and urged her to drop out of school.</TE>
<TE>   He's serving a life sentence for murder. She believes that the
fire crew put her on a different path.</TE>
<TE>   "My saw breaks down, I have to fix it," she said. "Now it's like
I'm my own woman and I don't need anybody to make decisions for me.
It's time to realize it's not a game any more; this is life."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As summer wanes, the girls finally get their chance. On Aug. 18,
they go to a 100-acre fire near Spokane -- not big by wildfire
standards, but it is threatening several homes.</TE>
<TE>   Some people give the crew odd looks, but the girls quickly prove
themselves by extinguishing all the hot spots in their area.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone was really surprised," Horne said. "When they realized
just seven girls did all that work, they were like, 'Wow.' "</TE>
<TE>   As advertised, they eat well. They're impressed by the flavored
coffee creamers, which they have never seen before.</TE>
<TE>   The work is tough, a lot of hauling water hoses and running up and
down hills. The air is so smoky that their skin, even under their
clothes, turns black and three girls get nosebleeds. But they
persist.</TE>
<TE>   The girls can't talk to outsiders on a fire, but Horne appreciates
when people wave or call, "Thanks!"</TE>
<TE>   "It's given me an opportunity to do what I can, to be a leader,"
she said. "On that big fire, y'know, I kinda felt free a little bit.
I want to keep doing that."</TE>

<HD>Iowa Baby's Death Pits Privacy Against Piety</HD>
<DH>Values: Planned Parenthood won't open records to aid search
for mother of the newborn. Town is in turmoil over the case, which
state high court will hear.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HANNAH WOLFSON</AU>
<BD>FOR THE ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>STORM LAKE, Iowa</DL>
<LD>In her dozen years as manager of a Planned Parenthood clinic in
small-town Iowa, Sue Thayer thought that she had seen it all --
pickets, threats and, locked away in a file cabinet, the records of
women with problems she had never imagined.</LD>
<LD>   But nothing comes close to the furor that has erupted in the
months since the sheriff demanded to see some of those files in hopes
of solving the gruesome death of a newborn.</LD>
<LD>   Planned Parenthood's refusal to turn over the records has stirred
debate around the country and divided this farm town of about 10,000.</LD>
<TE>   It began in May with the discovery of a baby boy who had been
dismembered by machines at the county garbage-sorting center. Unable
to identify the baby or establish the cause of death, sheriff's
deputies turned to the town's doctors and nurses to find out who the
mother was.</TE>
<TE>   Two Storm Lake doctors' offices and the hospital provided
investigators with the names of expectant mothers who could not be
accounted for. But when deputies showed up with a subpoena for the
names and addresses of women who had undergone pregnancy tests,
Planned Parenthood said no.</TE>
<TE>   The organization contends that doing so would violate the women's
privacy. It appealed to the Iowa Supreme Court, which agreed to hear
the case.</TE>
<TE>   "For many women, it's the most personal test they've ever had
done," Thayer said. "They come in expecting the information will stay
here. Some women even use the back door. Some don't use their real
names."</TE>
<TE>   Buena Vista County Atty. Phil Havens said patients at the clinic
cannot expect total privacy because, in most cases, they do not see a
doctor or even a nurse.</TE>
<TE>   As for any inconvenience caused by opening the records, he said,
"I'm sorry for that. I apologize. But a human being was thrown into
the garbage and shredded, and I think that crime was important enough
to society to at least attempt to find out who did it."</TE>
<TE>   The case has been the talk of Storm Lake's cafes and the editorial
pages of the local newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not ashamed, nor am I embarrassed to admit that I have gone
to Planned Parenthood," one teen wrote in a signed letter to the
editor. Another -- the daughter of a sheriff's deputy -- argued that
such issues shouldn't be discussed "with a law enforcement officer
knocking at your door."</TE>
<TE>   "Let's face it. It's a small town we live in. People talk," she
wrote.</TE>
<TE>   That is exactly why the records should be protected, Karen Hixon
said as she ate lunch at the coffee shop across from the courthouse.</TE>
<TE>   "It isn't fair to those people who went in confidence," she said.
"Just the idea that you can have someone come up and say, 'I heard
you were pregnant,' is awful."</TE>
<TE>   For Sandra Morris, who works at the grocery store, the crime took
precedence over privacy. "If it were my granddaughter, I'd want to
know about it and I'd want her punished," she said as she arranged
the flower display.</TE>
<TE>   The issue is clouded by anger over Planned Parenthood's very
presence here, said Dana Larsen, editor of the Storm Lake Pilot
Tribune.</TE>
<TE>   The clinic, which serves six counties, does not perform abortions.
But that distinction is difficult for many to make in this
conservative, mostly Christian community where hand-painted signs
reading "You Know Abortion Is Wrong" rise out of cornfields.</TE>
<TE>   "I think people have forgotten what they were arguing about in the
first place," Larsen said. "There's really nobody around talking
about the baby or how to keep this from happening again."</TE>
<TE>   The uproar has surprised Sheriff Chuck Eddy, who said he half
expected Storm Lake's new mothers to hold their infants up to the
window outside his office to prove that they were not to blame.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's deputies trying to find the mother have inquired at
schools and churches, and they ran DNA tests on a few women who were
thought to have been pregnant. They have also looked for households
using the same garbage bags that the baby was found in, with no luck.
The sheriff said he has run out of leads.</TE>
<TE>   The high court is not scheduled to hear arguments until December.
Even then, the records may not help. The baby's mother could have
been from out of state. She could have used a false name. Or she
might never have gotten a pregnancy test or any other care; she might
not even have known she was pregnant.</TE>
<TE>   At Planned Parenthood, Thayer said the risk of finding a neighbor
or daughter on the list is too great in a town this size. After all,
her brother-in-law was the one who discovered the baby in the first
place. And she said she has already seen a significant drop-off in
the number of women coming in for pregnancy tests, usually about 75
to 100 a month.</TE>
<TE>   In her cramped office at Planned Parenthood, Thayer pulled out a
foot-thick stack of newspaper clippings and letters about the uproar.
A few letters included threats. Thayer said she has also gotten
sidelong glances at the grocery store.</TE>
<TE>   She said she prays that the town understands her position.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be devastating for the clinic to have to turn these
records over," she said. "We go way back. I think people realize I'm
just trying to do the right thing."</TE>

<HD>No Bones About Benefits of Exercise</HD>
<DH>Health: A jumping program, combined with the hormones of
early puberty, can strengthen a child's skeleton, researchers
discover.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>IRA DREYFUSS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Something as simple as jumping off and onto low platforms can make a
child's bones stronger, and it can be accomplished in as little as 10
minutes three times a week, researchers say.</LD>
<LD>   The exercise program requires nothing more high-tech than
platforms 4 to 20 inches in height.</LD>
<LD>   "It can be done very easily and it can be done at low cost," said
researcher Heather McKay of the University of British Columbia. "Ten
minutes, three times a week, isn't too long."</LD>
<TE>   McKay and her colleagues looked at the interaction of exercise and
the hormonal torrents that start around puberty. Either exercise or
hormones can trigger bone growth. But the researchers say the
combination creates optimum conditions -- a window of opportunity --
to soak up calcium and lay down denser bone.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers focused on the years in which human growth hormone
and sex hormones surge. This happens in girls typically from ages 10
through 12, with growth hormone levels rising first; in boys, who
mature later, the same process takes place from ages 12 through 14.</TE>
<TE>   The gush of hormones creates the growth spurt in which bones get
longer and thicker. The benefits of exercise also peak during the
spurt years and taper off as the hormone surge winds down,
researchers say.</TE>
<TE>   McKay and her colleagues offered a jumping program to 68 children
in some schools in British Columbia and summarized the benefits in
the August issue of the British Journal of Sports Medicine.</TE>
<TE>   After seven months, girls in early puberty gained about 3% more
bone in the lower spine than similar girls who did not participate in
the program, the study found. The data on boys have not yet been
analyzed.</TE>
<TE>   Because her program required only 10 minutes three times a week,
the exercise could be done in any classroom. "We wouldn't even need a
gym," McKay said.</TE>
<TE>   About a quarter of the adult skeleton develops during the two-year
hormonal window. The additional benefit of exercise can add to bone
strength that might someday retard the development of osteoporosis in
the older years, she said.</TE>
<TE>   However, bone that is not stressed in exercise can lose density,
so the children will have to make exercise a lifetime habit to keep
the benefit, McKay said.</TE>
<TE>   Evidence is mounting that exercise in early-to mid-puberty gives a
greater gain than the same type and amount of activity would in later
years, said Dr. Laura K. Bachrach, a researcher at Stanford
University who was not part of the McKay team.</TE>
<TE>   McKay is on the right track, but her program of 10 minutes of
jumping three times a week should be tested more broadly, Bachrach
said. McKay hopes that schools in British Columbia will try it.</TE>
<TE>   And it takes more than hormones and exercise to build bone
strength; it takes calcium, said Babette Zemel, director of the
nutrition and growth laboratory at the Children's Hospital of
Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Children do not get enough calcium. "When they need the most
calcium, ages 9 to 14, that's when calcium intake is decreasing," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Boys and girls ages 9 to 13 should get about 1,300 milligrams of
calcium a day, but they get around 800, Zemel said. Children should
drink more milk, which has about 300 mg of calcium in a glass, or eat
more yogurt, with 200 to 250 mg in a four-ounce container.</TE>

<HD>Legal Eagles Tip Off in 'Highest Court in the Land'</HD>
<DH>Basketball: Since the 1940s, a room on the top floor of the
Supreme Court building has been a place where justices, clerks and
fill-ins shoot hoops.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GINA HOLLAND</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Supreme Court building is home to two courts. There's the fancy
place with red velvet curtains and robe-wearing justices, and the one
with bland concrete walls and backboards, where the attire is sweats
and sneakers.</LD>
<LD>   The unofficial court is for basketball. It's in a secluded area on
the building's top floor, not listed in tourist information and
closed to visitors.</LD>
<LD>   Known informally as the "highest court in the land," it's the
place for matchups of justices, law clerks and fill-in players from
the police force, cafeteria and clerk's office.</LD>
<TE>   "It's certainly not to be confused with Boston Garden, but I don't
think anybody ever complained," said Kevin Kearney, a former clerk
who practices law in Buffalo, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   When the building was constructed in the 1930s, the area was
designed as a spare space for journals. In the 1940s -- archivists
cannot definitively say why or when -- wood backboards were
installed.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, players have trekked through the law library and up a
flight of stairs. A combination is required for entry into what looks
like a junior high gym. A sign warns competitors to watch the noise
because the real courtroom is directly below. "How much closer to
basketball heaven can you get than that?" said University of Georgia
law professor Dan Coenen, a clerk from 1979-80.</TE>
<TE>   Pickup games are routine at lunchtime or afternoons, mostly for
the young clerks.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Garnett's only question during his 1995 interview for a
clerkship was about the court's court. "I asked to see the court and
to shoot just one shot. It struck me that it would likely be my only
chance," recalled Garnett, who later got to shoot hoops any time he
liked as a clerk for Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist.</TE>
<TE>   None of the current nine justices plays -- their average age is
68.</TE>
<TE>   But Justice Sandra Day O'Connor uses the court for women-only
classes of yoga-style aerobics. And some justices use weights in a
small adjoining gym.</TE>
<TE>   The legendary basketball-playing justice was Byron White, a highly
competitive onetime pro football player who died earlier this year.
He shot hoops even into his 70s, matching up against Justice Clarence
Thomas several times before retiring in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   White wasn't on the court when Thomas tore his Achilles tendon
during a game, an injury that ended Thomas' playing days.</TE>
<TE>   Asked by a colleague if he was responsible for the injury, White
said, apparently in jest: "If I'd done it, it would have been both
legs."</TE>
<TE>   White invited his clerks to join him on the court each afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   "His saying was, 'Shall we clear the cobwebs, guys?' " said Lee
Albert, a professor at the State University of New York at Buffalo
Law School who clerked for White from 1963-65. "These are Type A
personalities who do not need much prompting anyway."</TE>
<TE>   Charles Lettow, a Washington attorney who clerked for then-Chief
Justice Warren E. Burger in 1969-70, said players knew that if they
tried to roughhouse White, "you'd get laid out on the floor."</TE>
<TE>   Lettow's daughter, Renee Lettow Lerner, as an appeals court clerk
in 1996-97, once played in a tournament pitting female appeals court
clerks against female clerks of the high court, who called themselves
the Supreme Women. The matchup was close, but no one knows how close
because the players didn't keep score.</TE>
<TE>   The court has had some upgrades. A new floor was installed in
1984, and wooden backboards were replaced with Plexiglas in 1997. But
there still aren't any benches and the court itself is smaller than
regulation-size.</TE>
<TE>   Despite that, the court remains a major perk for clerks. "You have
the best legal job in the country and, oh my gosh, there's basketball
too," said Anne Coughlin, a clerk in 1985-86 who teaches law at the
University of Virginia.</TE>

<HD>Loss of Green Spaces May Silence Singing Frogs</HD>
<DH>Nature: To raise awareness of the coqui's plight, TV
commercials and billboards feature the Puerto Rican critter with the
two-note call.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>IAN JAMES</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>CAIMITO, Puerto Rico</DL>
<LD>The resounding calls of "ko-KEE, ko-KEE" ring out in a cadence that
brings music to Puerto Rican nights.</LD>
<LD>   The tiny frog that produces the melody is named coqui after its
distinctive two-note call and, because it is native only to Puerto
Rico, has become a symbol for the island, its culture and its people.</LD>
<LD>   "It's like a part of us, a part of our family," said schoolteacher
Lourdes Colon, who hears the frogs each night outside her house in
tree-covered hills south of San Juan.</LD>
<TE>   Some Puerto Ricans lament that the sound is becoming less common
as parking lots and subdivisions eat away at green spaces. Scientists
say the coqui now faces serious threats to its survival.</TE>
<TE>   Roadside billboards aim to raise awareness, proclaiming, "May the
coqui keep singing." Coquis are printed on towels and T-shirts. Their
chirp echoes in TV commercials, and their name advertises everything
from cafeterias to handmade soaps.</TE>
<TE>   The coqui has inspired folk songs and poems. Even the Caribbean
island's earliest inhabitants, the Taino people, carved the frog's
unmistakable form in petroglyphs.</TE>
<TE>   When Colon returns home, she often lies in a hammock and is calmed
by "the orchestra of nature" -- the frog song that lulls some
islanders to sleep.</TE>
<TE>   Coquis are as small as the tip of a thumb and difficult to spot.
Nearby islands have related species, but they don't make the same
sound, so parents have for generations passed on the myth that coquis
can survive only in Puerto Rico.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, though, large numbers appeared in distant Hawaii,
probably brought there in shipments of tropical plants.</TE>
<TE>   Many Hawaiians, unaccustomed to frog calls that can reach 100
decibels, say they are noisy pests. U.S. officials plan to start
eradicating the frogs there Oct. 1, likely using pesticides.</TE>
<TE>   "The populations are very high and in some areas very, very, very
noisy," said Lyle Wong of Hawaii's Agriculture Department. "They're
just changing the character of our evening hours."</TE>
<TE>   Although Puerto Rico's government has urged Hawaii to find an
alternative to extermination, biologists largely agree that coquis
have upset Hawaii's natural balance, preying on native insects and
boosting the populations of predators like rats and mongooses.</TE>
<TE>   But in Puerto Rico -- and elsewhere -- it is the frogs that are
under assault, from destruction of their habitats and pollution.</TE>
<TE>   Three of 16 named species in this U.S. territory are already
believed extinct. All belong to the genus Eleutherodactylus, from
those with the traditional "ko-KEE" call to others with differing
songs.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the concrete of San Juan, the frog song persists from gardens
moist enough to sustain them. But scientists have documented
declines.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Thomas, a herpetologist at the University of Puerto Rico,
estimates frog populations in the rain forest of El Yunque, where
there can be thousands in one acre.</TE>
<TE>   Coquis stop singing as he nears, but Thomas has perfected a
whistle to restart their chirping.</TE>
<TE>   Searching in the foliage, he whispers, "Right here!" and
illuminates a frog as its vocal sac expands and constricts.</TE>
<TE>   Only males make the "ko-KEE" sound, marking their territory with
the "ko" and calling females with the "KEE." The song intensifies
after rain and on dark nights.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas has studied coquis since the 1960s, when he discovered that
the common coqui was a unique species and named it. Today, he worries
that other species could fade like the golden coqui, which he hasn't
seen since the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   "I like the animals and I hate to see them go," he said. But, he
added, "as we build more and more malls and resorts along the coast,
and grind up more of the limestone hills, who knows what's in store?"</TE>

<HD>Kentuckians Hold True to Their Quiet Bend</HD>
<DH>Nature: Cut off from the rest of the state by the New
Madrid quakes, the land is home to a few souls and a feud
immortalized by Mark Twain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JIM SUHR</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>KENTUCKY BEND, Ky.</DL>
<LD>As the sun sets over her farmhouse and a mouse scampers across the
porch near her feet, Daisy Wilson welcomes the stranger who managed
to find this desolate nub of land between the curves of the
Mississippi River.</LD>
<LD>   Visitors don't often come around what locals call Kentucky Bend,
aside from an occasional escaped convict, a drunkard or a hopelessly
lost motorist. Most simply stumble upon the tiny, teardrop-shaped
crook on Tennessee 22, the only road in and out.</LD>
<LD>   Her Kentucky drawl dripping with Southern charm, Wilson greets her
visitor like family, inviting him to sit and hear about life on these
15,000 acres in deep southwestern Kentucky across the Mississippi
from New Madrid, Mo.</LD>
<TE>   The land is a notch, which fits like a puzzle piece into a curve
of Missouri land carved out by the meandering Mississippi. It's
surrounded on three sides by water, with the opposing shore all
Missouri. The fourth side is Tennessee, leaving the bend cut off from
the rest of the state.</TE>
<TE>   But Wilson gets a bit riled when asked the question begged by the
map: With the Bend conjoined to Tennessee and pinched off from the
rest of Kentucky, do you feel Kentuckian or Tennessean? Or maybe just
confused?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a Kentuckian through and through, very much so. And this is
home,"' says Wilson, 70.</TE>
<TE>   Others call the geographic oddity Madrid Bend, New Madrid Bend or
Bessie Bend. One magazine lovingly dubbed it Bubbleland, for its odd,
river-wrapped shape.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the name, the Bend isn't much besides a handful of
houses, a graveyard, flat farmland, a few small fishing lakes, and
pockets of deer and wild turkeys that run for cover in hunting
season.</TE>
<TE>   The Bend used to have the nation's largest cottonwood tree down
yonder, Wilson points out, but a lightning strike years ago cut it to
a stump. The few schoolchildren take a bus 12 miles into Tiptonville,
the Tennessee town touting itself as Carl Perkins' boyhood home.
Voting machines are long gone, requiring a 40-mile drive to Hickman,
Ky., to vote.</TE>
<TE>   The folks here who need emergency help, groceries or other
supplies often get them from Tiptonville and Lake County, Tenn. Their
mailing addresses are rural Tiptonville. Wilson doesn't have a phone,
and only four Bend dwellers have library cards for use when Marda
Pate makes her monthly 55-mile bookmobile trek from Fulton, Ky.</TE>
<TE>   The only store closed in the early 1960s. There is neither church
nor gas station.</TE>
<TE>   "But you've got your privacy here, your quietness. There ain't
everybody stuffing their noses in your business," Wilson says about
the land where she and her husband have spent 49 years, rearing 10
children and farming soybeans, cotton, wheat and corn.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't live in the city; there's too much meanness, too much
ungodliness."</TE>
<TE>   Just decades ago, she recalls, several hundred occupied the
flood-prone land. A head count today is accomplished with little
effort. "Fifteen."</TE>
<TE>   Historians say English settlers arrived shortly after the Bend's
creation by the 1811-12 New Madrid earthquakes that shifted the
Mississippi. Ferries shuttled residents to Missouri and back.</TE>
<TE>   Helped by steamboats, the Bend's population grew from just two in
1820 to more than 300 in 1870, with corn and wheat acreage giving way
to cotton in nearly all the fields by the 20th century. The Bend even
had a small gin, a couple of sawmills -- and six decades of 1800s
bloodshed between the Darnells and Watsons, by some accounts over a
horse or cow.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Twain wrote about that, claiming that "in no part of the
South has the vendetta flourished more briskly, or held out longer,
between warring families, than in this particular region."</TE>
<TE>   "Every year or so, somebody was shot, on one side or the other,
and as fast as one generation was laid out, their sons took up the
feud and kept it a-going," Twain's "Life on the Mississippi" quotes a
man as saying. "And it's just as I say; they went on shooting each
other, year in and year out -- making a kind of religion of it, you
see -- till they'd done forgot, long ago, what it was all about.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing could have been fixed up, easy enough, but no, that
wouldn't go. Rough words had been passed, and so, nothing but blood
could fix it up after that. That horse or cow, whichever it was, cost
60 years of killing and crippling!"</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Twain's character said, the last of the Darnells -- an
elderly father and his two sons -- decided to leave the bloody Bend
by steamboat. "But the Watsons got wind of it," showed up as the
Darnells were about to embark and opened fire, killing the brothers.</TE>
<TE>   Old history, Wilson might say. Bendfolk, she says, have lots of
other things to hang their hat on.</TE>
<TE>   "This little ol' Bend has decided several elections. You wouldn't
think it," says Wilson, a self-professed full-blooded Republican
who's a registered Democrat. (That's so she can vote more often, she
insists.) "They say if you can carry the Bend, you have a higher
chance of winning the election."</TE>
<TE>   Ed Whitfield hasn't quite found it that way. Into his fourth term
as a Republican congressman for Kentucky's 1st District spanning 33.5
counties, he has never carried Fulton County. When told of Wilson's
talk about the Bend's supposed election day clout, the politician who
has been to that area maybe twice pledged with a smile: "After what
you said, I'm going to spend more time there."</TE>
<TE>   "Kentucky Bend is as important as any other area," he said. "But
you have to make a special effort to get over there."</TE>
<TE>   So do inmates at the prison in Tiptonville, where Wilson's son
Virgil works as a guard. "Every time they break out," Wilson says,
"they head right down to this Bend. They think they can make it, but
the river's always in the way."</TE>
<TE>   The river has claimed at least three of the men. Another escapee
stole her son's car.</TE>
<TE>   That's about as exciting as it gets in these parts, where the
Wilson brood grew up playing in the sloughs, hunting, fishing and
working the fields. "I loved being able to do whatever I wanted, and
no one said anything because there was nobody around," says Virgil
Wilson, at 40 living just a mile from his parents in Lake County,
Tenn., where last month he finished last in a four-man race for
sheriff.</TE>
<TE>   Daisy Wilson yearns to see other parts of Kentucky where "they
tell me they've got a lot of mines and caves."</TE>
<TE>   "But I guess I'll never get no further than my back yard," she
says.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, a swing dangles from a tree, near a garden tiller covered
by a metal washtub. And as the twilight chill sets in, her towels, a
rug and a couple pairs of jeans hang limply from the clothesline.</TE>

<HD>Even One Hungry Soul Is One Too Many for Minister</HD>
<DH>Charity: His nonprofit group scouts the planet to match
surplus food and goods with the world's needy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM L. HOLMES</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>RALEIGH, N.C.</DL>
<LD>Hungry people around the world eat because of Ray Buchanan.</LD>
<LD>   Sometimes it's because of a deal he brokered. Or because of money
he sweet-talked out of a middle-class church congregation or one rich
guy. Sometimes it's because of a ruckus he raises with those who
control global food programs.</LD>
<LD>   The bottom line is that people eat, and that's what Buchanan cares
about most.</LD>
<TE>   It's what drives him to be a professional hunger fighter.</TE>
<TE>   Buchanan works through Stop Hunger Now, a Raleigh-based nonprofit
established in 1997. The group has five staffers, but managed to
distribute about $10 million in aid to nearly 20 countries last year.
Its overhead costs have never exceeded 8% of its total budget.</TE>
<TE>   The group rarely lingers, hopping from Congo to El Salvador to
Afghanistan, pouring its efforts into the places with the hungriest
people and the most need.</TE>
<TE>   The need rarely eases. Disasters, drought, war and corruption
force the world's poor into starvation as one crisis gives way to the
next. The unfortunate cycle results in 24,000 deaths a day, at least
half of them children, according to the Rome-based World Food
Program.</TE>
<TE>   "That's not only ridiculous," Buchanan said. "That's obscene."</TE>
<TE>   In the last year, Stop Hunger Now delivered about $8 million in
aid to Afghanistan, a country torn by war but also one where a hunger
crisis has been building for years. Access to it was limited until
recently, but the toppling of the Taliban regime allowed Buchanan and
other relief workers to attend to the needs of an estimated 6 million
to 8 million starving people.</TE>
<TE>   For Buchanan, that meant being on the ground, scouting for groups
with lean overhead costs and efficient distribution. He can't abide
those who trade food for political dogma and eschews well-meaning
devotees who proselytize by offering food to the starving.</TE>
<TE>   The ordained United Methodist minister is driven by what he
considers a religious imperative.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing about Christianity is you're supposed to be doing
instead of talking about it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Former Rep. Tony Hall of Ohio, who began work in early August as
the United States' ambassador to the U.N. food and agriculture
agencies in Rome, said private groups such as Buchanan's are
important tools to the World Food Program and other large,
government-sponsored programs.</TE>
<TE>   Buchanan's work with the hungry began in 1979, when he and the
Rev. Kenneth C. Horne Jr. started the Society of St. Andrew, a
ministry in Bedford County, Va., devoted to feeding Americans.</TE>
<TE>   It sends out 46 million pounds of food a year -- the equivalent of
three tractor-trailer loads a day.</TE>
<TE>   But Horne said his partner was always more interested in
international hunger issues. Although hunger touches about 30 million
people in the United States for just three to six days a month, it's
more prevalent internationally, according to Horne. Some estimates
show that 815 million people in the world go to bed hungry each
night.</TE>
<TE>   So when John Hewitt, a millionaire entrepreneur from Virginia
Beach, Va., offered Buchanan $250,000 to start an organization that
focused on international hunger, Buchanan left the Society of St.
Andrew. He moved to Raleigh in September 1999 for access to its
international corporate community and airport.</TE>
<TE>   Stop Hunger Now's reach and budget have grown steadily. In the
last five years, Buchanan has worked in about 45 countries.</TE>

<LD>COLT'S NECK, N.J. -- A few weeks after her second daughter was born,
Carole Ehlinger received a card from longtime friends. The gist of
the message: "You're so lucky."</LD>
<LD>   Struggling to absorb the fact that her newborn had Down syndrome,
Ehlinger found the card perplexing -- although not for long.</LD>
<LD>   "I didn't understand right away, but that message has really rung
true," Ehlinger said. "Catherine has brought out the best in all of
us."</LD>
<TE>   Catherine is 23 now, a high school graduate with a boyfriend,
working three afternoons a week bagging groceries at a supermarket.
Adult and independent in many ways, trustingly childlike in others,
she has -- like other young people with mental disabilities --
provided her parents with a distinctive set of challenges and joys.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember coming home from the hospital and looking at the
comics in the paper and thinking, 'I'll never be able to laugh again,
" Ehlinger recalled. "If only I'd known how wonderful it was going to
be."</TE>
<TE>   In the span of one generation, the dynamics of families like the
Ehlingers have been transformed as the life expectancy of people with
Down syndrome -- the most common form of mental retardation --
increased from 25 years to more than 50.</TE>
<TE>   Parents no longer assume that they will outlive their child, and
the option of mental institutions has fallen from favor. Parents and
child often spend many more years together than in the past, and
parents face difficult decisions about encouraging self-reliance and
ensuring a grown child's well-being after their death.</TE>
<TE>   For Carole Ehlinger and her husband, Jim, an executive with AT&amp;T
Corp., concerns about the future are eased somewhat by their
expectation that Catherine's siblings -- Christine and James -- could
keep an eye on her.</TE>
<TE>   The future has more question marks for others.</TE>
<TE>   Maureen Maimone's 17-year-old son, J.C., also has Down syndrome,
but he is an only child. Maimone worries about what might happen if
she dies before he does.</TE>
<TE>   "I have such a profound fear about when I'm not here any more,"
she said. "Who's going to think about where he'll go for
Thanksgiving? Who's going to know he's afraid of thunderstorms?"</TE>
<TE>   Divorced when J.C. was 5, Maimone has been her son's constant
companion since his birth. Aside from one 10-day separation many
years ago, when she attended a meeting in Hawaii, they haven't been
apart more than three days. She wants to encourage his sense of
self-sufficiency, but knows not to push too fast.</TE>
<TE>   "He's extremely friendly; he talks to strangers," she said at
their home in Ocean, N.J. "I try to teach him to be cautious, but not
make him fearful."</TE>
<TE>   J.C. attends regular classes at the local high school; he also
takes special math and reading courses.</TE>
<TE>   "J.C. is very popular in school," his mother said. "Unfortunately,
it doesn't carry over to the weekends. His schoolmates aren't going
to call."</TE>
<TE>   The result is that Maimone, 46, and her longtime partner,
59-year-old lawyer Andy Kimmel, are J.C.'s weekend playmates -- a
role they find rejuvenating. They go to concerts, play mini-golf,
travel -- railroad museums are among J.C.'s favorite destinations.</TE>
<TE>   "The challenge is getting our energy level up," Maimone said.
"We're usually on the go all weekend. Sometimes we're pooped, and all
three of us just hang out in the bookstore."</TE>
<TE>   Maimone grew up in a large family and wishes that J.C. could have
the same opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes I think his biggest disability is being an only child,"
she said. "I have the finances and the time to do what I want to do
with him, but he doesn't have the other stimulation. I wish he had a
brother or sister to tease him, play with him."</TE>
<TE>   Maimone recalled being stunned, after J.C.'s birth, at learning he
had Down syndrome.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no history of it in our families," she said. "We
thought, 'He's not ours. It's a mistake.' It was the initial shock,
and then 'Let's roll up our sleeves and learn about it.' "</TE>
<TE>   She read advice books, contacted experts, founded a support group.
Her life -- which includes some part-time legal work done from home
-- has been demanding but rewarding.</TE>
<TE>   "I have those moments where I see that it's different here, that
most parents don't have to do all this," she said. "But I truly think
that's a small price to pay for what I've gotten back from him. If
there's any kind of plus-minus scale, it's 1,000 times on the plus
side."</TE>
<TE>   On most Saturdays, J.C. gets a visit from his biological father,
who takes him to drum lessons. The role of day-to-day father is
embraced zestfully by Kimmel, who like Maimone is divorced. He says
his relationship with J.C. is more intense than with his two grown
children.</TE>
<TE>   "I love them dearly, but it's not the same thing," Kimmel said.
"J.C. is an extraordinary person."</TE>
<TE>   With Kimmel's help, Maimone is now looking ahead, talking about
vocational training and future living arrangements for J.C., and
about estate planning.</TE>
<TE>   "Who wants to think about these things? But you have to," Maimone
said. "If you don't make plans, they just get dumped somewhere."</TE>
<TE>   She envisions her son getting a job after high school and
eventually moving into an assisted-living facility where he could be
more independent.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd love to have him live with me forever -- but I'd like him
settled somewhere before anything happens to me," Maimone said. "By
his late 20s, I'd like to see him living somewhere on his own --
definitely nearby -- maybe a mile down the road."</TE>
<TE>   J.C. -- a strong swimmer, self-taught harmonica player and fan of
actor Jackie Chan -- has his own ideas about the future. "I'm going
to get married," he said. "I'm going to drive a black VW bug."</TE>
<TE>   But if those are typical sentiments of a 17-year-old boy, his
affection for his best friend is not. "You're the best mom ever," he
told Maimone, hugging her as she picked him up at day camp. "You're
my pumpkin."</TE>
<TE>   The Maimones and Ehlingers live about 12 miles apart in the
pleasant, farm-dotted suburbs near New Jersey's northern coast. Both
have become active in programs for young people with disabilities.</TE>
<TE>   When Catherine was 2, Carole Ehlinger founded a dance group for
her and other children with disabilities. The group has prospered
ever since, with help from the entire Ehlinger family. Catherine has
taught some of the youngest dancers; siblings Christine and James
were volunteer teachers, and Jim has videotaped some performances.</TE>
<TE>   James, 19, has been a devoted brother to Catherine. They helped
each other learn to read when she was 6 and he was 2. More recently,
he and some friends coached Catherine's Special Olympics basketball
team.</TE>
<TE>   With James entering the University of Notre Dame this fall and
Christine, 25, living an hour's drive away, Carole and Jim Ehlinger
are in no hurry for Catherine to leave home -- she needs them.</TE>
<TE>   "We've chosen to take things as they come," Ehlinger said. "For
all your children, your goal is for them to go off and have
wonderful, independent lives. For Catherine, it's a little tricky.
She needs someone to oversee her."</TE>
<TE>   Some experts advocate independent living for people like
Catherine, "but it doesn't really ring true to us right now," her
father said. "We enjoy having her here. She brings a lot to the
family."</TE>
<TE>   If Catherine did live independently, she would need help with
cooking, transportation (she can't drive) and finances, her parents
said.</TE>
<TE>   "She's very trusting, and someone could take advantage of her,"
Jim Ehlinger said. "But we've been fortunate. Despite what you read
in the newspapers, there are more people who are basically good than
bad."</TE>
<TE>   Carole Ehlinger long ago gave up teaching to rear her children,
and her husband has turned down offers of transfers. One factor, he
said, was a sense that Catherine benefited from close ties to friends
she has known since infancy in New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   Catherine's life has been full of milestones, including graduation
from high school two years ago and serving as her sister's maid of
honor in October. The Ehlingers proudly showed the videotape of
Catherine's speech at the wedding reception.</TE>
<TE>   "I love you guys," Catherine told the newlyweds, her voice full of
emotion. "I want you guys to stay together forever."</TE>
<TE>   The guests cheered, and Christine rose from her table to bear-hug
her sister.</TE>
<TE>   When Catherine was born, her mother recalled, a well-meaning
doctor tried to caution the parents that her horizons were limited --
that at 16 she'd perhaps be preoccupied with coloring books.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the mind-set at the time -- don't have high
expectations," Carole Ehlinger said.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Catherine has been a pivotal part of a loving, on-the-go
family -- the one most attuned to others' ups and downs, the one most
certain to remember an anniversary or birthday.</TE>
<TE>   "She's been such a positive element in our lives," her mother
said. "I think every family should have a child with Down syndrome."</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Down syndrome, a chromosomal abnormality, is the most common cause of
mental retardation. Some facts about it:</LD>
<LD>   * One in 800 to 1,000 people are born with the condition.</LD>
<LD>   * Children with Down syndrome run a higher risk of heart defects,
visual or hearing impairment, and other health problems.</LD>
<TE>   * The average age at which people with Down syndrome die rose from
25 in 1983 to 49 in 1997, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. Other studies put life expectancy at over 55.</TE>
<TE>   * Most individuals with Down syndrome have IQs in the mild to
moderate range of mental retardation.</TE>
<TE>   * In the United States, about 350,000 families are affected by
Down syndrome.</TE>
<TE>   * Women age 35 and older have an increased risk of having a child
with Down syndrome. A 35-year-old woman has a one in 400 chance of
conceiving a child with Down syndrome; the odds increase to one in
110 by age 40.</TE>

<HD>Entrepreneur Whips Up Bondage Gear for Vegans</HD>
<DH>Business: Utah man develops custom-made, animal-friendly
items he markets online. Rights group lists him as a 'compassionate
retailer.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHERRI C. GOODMAN</AU>
<BD>SALT LAKE TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>A vegan's life is anything but easy. What to eat, what to drink, what
to wear.</LD>
<LD>   What to use to tie up, blindfold, gag and whip your partner.</LD>
<LD>   A young Salt Lake City entrepreneur is working to take the "cow"
out of cower and make bondage play safe for vegans with a line of
animal-friendly, cruelty-free human restraints, collars, harnesses,
whips and belts.</LD>
<TE>   Eric Ward, who runs the business online, crafts custom-made gear
on request out of a "sinthetic" micro fiber called Lorica that looks,
feels and acts like leather.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the major aspects of the fetish of leather is the look of
it. It just looks so sexy," Ward said.</TE>
<TE>   The online store's dedication to vegan products earned it a spot
on the "compassionate retailer" list of the animal rights group
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.</TE>
<TE>   Ward, who has not eaten or used products derived from animals in
four years, runs the online store as part of Reach Out Publications,
a company that makes buttons and T-shirts for activist and nonprofit
groups in Utah.</TE>
<TE>   Ward, 22, insists that his main motive is to make life easier for
vegans. He volunteers with the Utah Animal Rights Coalition and
helped publish a guide to local vegetarian restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   Reach Out also runs a vegetarian food-buying club.</TE>
<TE>   But he admits that a personal interest in leather fetishes and
bondage also played a role in the creation of his online store.</TE>
<TE>   "I like helping open people's sexuality," he said.</TE>
<TE>   His career as a PETA-sanctioned erotica outfitter started with a
fateful trip to Europe, where he discovered a wealth of affordable
vegan condoms.</TE>
<TE>   When he returned to the United States, he decided to start an
online store to sell the vegan condoms priced to compete with
traditional ones.</TE>
<TE>   The condom line, produced by the German company Condomi, raises
the question: What makes a typical latex condom unvegan?</TE>
<TE>   According to Ward and other animal activists, latex processing
traditionally involves the use of a milk protein to soften the
material, which violates the philosophy of veganism.</TE>
<TE>   Condomi uses milk-free cocoa powder instead.</TE>
<TE>   His condom sales have been brisk, spurring him to toy with other
vegan erotic tools.</TE>
<TE>   He searched for durable vegan bondage gear and found fabric
restraints and rubber whips, but not a lot of well-crafted "pleather"
gear, he said.</TE>
<TE>   He researched alternative materials and settled on Lorica, a
synthetic micro fiber used to make shoes and other vegan products.</TE>
<TE>   Ward bought a roll of the black material, some leather-crafting
tools and hardware, and an alternative sexuality guide, and started
whipping out custom-crafted designs.</TE>
<TE>   "The most important thing to me to get on the Web site immediately
was the ankle and wrist restraints," he said. "While your average
couple may not be interested in bondage, many of them would like some
nice padded restraints."</TE>
<TE>   He has since added custom-made belts and harness designs as well
as whips and slappers.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, this may not be something your average couple will
want, but there is a market," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Franzetta, a campaign coordinator for PETA, agrees.</TE>
<TE>   "PETA has received inquiries from people independently trying to
find those types of products, " she said. "In general, more and more
people are looking for items that are cruelty-free."</TE>
<TE>   Ward isn't exactly raking in the dough. He has sold about 5,000
condoms, but has had only five orders for bondage gear.</TE>
<TE>   But at least one of his customers is so pleased with her purchase
that she plans to buy more.</TE>
<TE>   Amy Leventhal, 32, of Berkeley, said she and her boyfriend visited
street fairs and sex shops and surfed Web sites looking for a vegan
collar.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not really a bondage-type person, but I wanted a collar and
my boyfriend wanted one," said Leventhal, who is a vegetarian and
does not wear leather products.</TE>
<TE>   The selection of "cutesy" vegan collars dismayed her. Then she
found Ward's Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Ward asked for her neck size and customized the collar.</TE>
<TE>   "It was really well-made and comfortable," she said. "It feels
great and it looks like leather. It was just what I was looking for."</TE>
<TE>   Now her boyfriend wants his own collar.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Ward continues his vegan crusade. His next charge?
Animal-friendly gear for Renaissance faire players.</TE>

<HD>Fans Go Out to Ballgame -- for 110 Years</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Massachusetts town seeks historic status for its
stadium, which has a colorful history. Park is known for its odd
shape and sun delays.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRUDY TYNAN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>PITTSFIELD, Mass.</DL>
<LD>It was the summer of 1892 when the sweet sound of ball meeting bat
was heard for the first time in Wahconah Park.</LD>
<LD>   Over the next 110 years, the misshapen minor league baseball park
-- where dead center is 374 feet from home plate, the right and left
field lines are about 334, and right center is a distant 430 -- has
seen and cultivated its share of legends.</LD>
<LD>   People still talk about Lou Gehrig's pasting one out of the park
and into the nearby Housatonic River.</LD>
<TE>   And they remember miscues, such as the night of July 30, 1970,
when pitcher Bruce Kison hit seven Pittsfield Senators and narrowly
missed opposing catcher Al Thompson -- who took his at-bat wearing
full catcher's gear. Kison was forced to leave the game, but his
career survived. He had a long career with Major League Baseball.</TE>
<TE>   For those reasons and more, city officials say the quirky park
known for its sun delays (because it faces west) belongs in the
National Register of Historic Places.</TE>
<TE>   "Wahconah Park reflects what baseball used to be and what is still
best about it," Pittsfield Mayor Sara Hathaway said.</TE>
<TE>   The city's request for nomination, launched in August, must first
be reviewed and investigated by the Massachusetts Historical
Commission.</TE>
<TE>   If the state approves, the nomination will be forwarded to federal
authorities.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still very much a work in progress," said Pittsfield
resident David Potts, who has spent months pouring through old
newspapers and other records to help piece together the park's
history.</TE>
<TE>   Historic designation could open opportunities for the
cash-strapped city to get grant money to help maintain and promote
the park, which opened Aug. 10, 1892. The Pittsfields prevailed that
day, 12-1 over the Gizes, a semipro team from Albany, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   But the park holds more than history.</TE>
<TE>   On warm summer nights, Wahconah Park is filled with families --
just as it was in the summer of 1913 when the Pittsfield Electrics,
the pride of a local trolley car company, drew 70,000 fans. (That
team is not to be confused with the Electrics of the 1940s, which got
its moniker from the city's main industry.)</TE>
<TE>   On a recent night, the 2,300 or so fans didn't seem to mind that
the Berkshire Black Bears, who are holding down the Northern League
cellar in their inaugural season, were again losing.</TE>
<TE>   Kids scampered along the bleachers. Parents chattered in the
grandstand, creating a buzz that often drowned out the announcer.
Groups of teenage girls giggled as they watched ballplayers not long
out of high school.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been coming to the games since I was shagging flies with the
other kids in the parking lot 25 years ago," David Mallet said as he
watched his son Daniel, 2, dance to the music from the stadium
loudspeakers.</TE>
<TE>   A cheery group of grandmothers commandeered some of the picnic
tables on the first-base line, a few easy steps from the beer
concession. Eddies of grandchildren, capped in black and blue Black
Bear batting helmets, swirled around them.</TE>
<TE>   And there was special magic when fans' voices rose in a ragged a
cappella chorus of "Take Me Out to the Ballgame" -- baseball's
venerable anthem, which hadn't even been written when the ballpark
opened.</TE>
<TE>   (In fact, Wahconah Park predates the song by 16 years.)</TE>
<TE>   "This is what baseball is supposed to be all about," said Don
Winn, who was making his first visit to the park since the 1970s
because his son was umpiring.</TE>
<TE>   The grandstand was last rebuilt in 1950, but Jim Thorpe and
Gehrig, who played here in the 1920s, would recognize it still.</TE>
<TE>   The most distant seat is less than 100 feet from the action, and a
series of fake owls dangle by their necks from ropes to keep the
pigeons from befouling the patrons in the high-priced seats -- just
as they have since the 19th century.</TE>
<TE>   Those high-priced seats, by the way, are $5 and $7. Seats in the
bleachers go for $4.</TE>
<TE>   The tiny locker rooms, dugouts and concession stands are from
another time. Still, the paint is bright and the grass on the diamond
is manicured to a sheen.</TE>
<TE>   New this summer are the bright blue box seats that the Black Bears
installed to replace the old wooden folding chairs.</TE>
<TE>   "We got lucky," said Mike Kardamis, president and general manager.
"We got them cheap."</TE>
<TE>   The seats were originally intended for the football stadium at
Brigham Young University but turned out to be the wrong shade of
blue.</TE>
<TE>   There is even a luxury box of sorts: two white wicker lawn chairs
with footstools immediately behind home plate.</TE>
<TE>   "Compared to some of the places we played, Wahconah Park is
luxury," said Mike Gladu, a former minor league pitcher.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the city almost lost track of the park's history. In recent
years, the date for the park's beginnings was often given as 1919,
which actually is when the city acquired it for $1 from heirs of
Charles Burbank, the local contractor who erected the park on
Wahconah Street.</TE>
<TE>   During a long and bitter political battle that ended last year
with Pittsfield voters rejecting construction of a new stadium, Potts
got interested in the park's history.</TE>
<TE>   Puzzled by the lack of headlines about the park in 1919, Potts
kept going back through microfilm of old newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, just this summer, he found the stories about the opening
day in August 1892.</TE>
<TE>   "I love Wahconah Park," Potts said. "And I'm not even a baseball
fan. I just go to the games because it's a fun evening out."</TE>

<HD>Peanut Butter and Crickets, a Zoo Feast</HD>
<DH>Nutrition: Critters eat everything from beets to
'bloodsickles' as caretakers strive to match what the animals would
eat in the wild.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD LEWIS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>PROVIDENCE, R.I.</DL>
<LD>At zoos across the country, handlers go to great lengths to tailor
dishes for the varied cravings of their animals.</LD>
<LD>   The mongooses at Roger Williams Park Zoo in Providence like peanut
butter and get especially frisky when searching, treasure hunt-style,
for the treat smeared around their cage.</LD>
<LD>   Caretakers discovered that cheetahs and bears go bonkers for
"bloodsickles" -- bucket-sized Popsicles made with blood from ground
beef and horse meat.</LD>
<TE>   Feeders at St. Louis Zoo learned that their Hamadryas baboons,
from the Arabian peninsula and North Africa, love to suck on fresh
beets -- amusing their keepers to no end with mouths that appeared to
be ringed with dark red lipstick.</TE>
<TE>   Gone are the days when elephants would be tossed peanuts or
monkeys would munch on bananas. Instead, animal feeding has evolved
into a science as caretakers at the nation's 179 accredited zoos
focus on nutrition.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a responsibility to provide in every way we can," said
Pat Sharkey, director of Roger Williams Zoo. "They're here at our
request, and we want to make sure their stay is an enjoyable one."</TE>
<TE>   The goal is to better match the animals' diets with the food they
would eat in the wild and to present it in a way they'd find in a
natural setting. The result: happier, more well-adjusted animals
giving visitors a more authentic view into how they really are.</TE>
<TE>   "You're always going to get people who come to the zoo and want to
see the animal in a box, like a museum piece," said Barbara Toddes, a
nutrition expert at the Philadelphia Zoo, America's first. "But the
vast majority of people are better educated than that, and they
really enjoy seeing the animals do what they normally do."</TE>
<TE>   Toddes chairs the Nutrition Advisory Group, a research team with
the American Zoo Assn. The group was formed in 1994 as zookeepers at
the nation's 179 accredited zoos awoke to the value of nutrition in
animals' food. They share advances in the field and recipes that work
for finicky palates.</TE>
<TE>   "There was still a lot of voodoo nutrition," Toddes said of
feeding practices when the nutrition group was started. "It wasn't
based on science at all."</TE>
<TE>   Zoos began as the personal playpens of wealthy adventurers. They
sprouted in major cities in America in the early 1900s. But they
weren't viewed as refuges for endangered species, and as reproductive
labs to rebuild threatened ones, until the 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   Food is key to the conservation effort. Caretakers have noticed
that animals with better diets are more likely to mate and reproduce,
furthering the species and maintaining the genetic diversity that is
at the core of a zoo's mission.</TE>
<TE>   "Literally, all the medical science available to people are now
available to animals in the zoo," said Michael Hutchins, the zoo
association's director of conservation and science. "They really are
privileged animals in a lot of ways."</TE>
<TE>   Zoos spend $200,000 to $650,000 annually on food -- about 2% of a
typical budget, according to an association survey last year. Feeding
just one lion can cost nearly $2,000 annually. Most of the meals are
uniform, but caretakers prepare dozens of specialized meals.</TE>
<TE>   Workers at Fort Worth Zoo in Texas make 241 individual dishes
every day in the industrial-sized commissary built last year.</TE>
<TE>   Roger Williams, which opened in 1872 and is one of the nation's
oldest, established a zoo commissary three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The zoo, next to Interstate 95, the busiest highway in the
Northeast, rotates a three-person team that daily prepares 400 pounds
of meat, grain and produce for 139 species. It's all fixed in a
spotless room of stainless steel that would rival the cleanliness of
a hospital. Employees dip the soles of their shoes in disinfectant
before entering the kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   There's fruit and other produce in Tupperware containers, garbage
cans filled with crickets and containers with live mealworms.</TE>
<TE>   Outside, industrial-sized refrigerators house horse meat, neatly
packaged mice and rats, and lots of mackerel, squid and other fish.</TE>
<TE>   Caretakers create, in some cases, elaborate mechanisms to
challenge the animals to get their food -- and to keep them
interested.</TE>
<TE>   At the Tulsa Zoo in Oklahoma, schoolchildren were enlisted to make
a 4-foot-tall papier-mache zebra that was filled with meat for the
lions. Then, all watched in amazement as the big cats stalked the
"prey" before attacking its neck and legs.</TE>
<TE>   "They just grabbed it and ripped it apart," said Kip Siemens, the
zoo's director of enrichment, special activities that stimulate the
animals to behave as they would outside captivity. "It was like you'd
see in the wild."</TE>
<TE>   Some animals are picky eaters that require special servings.</TE>
<TE>   Take Mia, for instance. The female tree kangaroo prefers kale over
sweet potatoes. But the males, Paul and Bushwhack, love yams.</TE>
<TE>   Christine Carlson, a caretaker from Newport, said she has become
attuned to the animals' likes and dislikes. "It's sad because I dream
about it," she said.</TE>
<TE>   As nutritionists learn more about better diets, it seems that the
animals are eating healthier than most people. Really, how many fat
monkeys or cheetahs have visitors seen?</TE>
<TE>   "They probably eat as healthy as kids with moms and dads watching
their diets," Sharkey said. "If they could choose junk food, they'd
do it."</TE>

<HD>A Scholar Examining Her Own Culture</HD>
<DH>Playwright-director Sujata Bhatt abandoned an academic
career to bring her insights about Indian values to the stage</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAN BRESLAUER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There was a time in playwright-director Sujata Bhatt's life when the
past wasn't merely prologue; it was threatening to become her
permanent gig. A scholar of medieval studies, she was on track for a
life in academia, but she abandoned those plans to become a writer.</LD>
<LD>   "I was a historian for a long time, facing the possibility of
actually doing that for the rest of my life," recalls the soft-spoken
Bhatt, seated in the second-floor lobby of a downtown theater on a
recent afternoon. "It would have meant another 40 years of dusty
manuscripts and researching in the bowels of libraries, which is
wonderful, but it's not the only thing I wanted to do."</LD>
<LD>   Fascinated as she was with the past, it wasn't enough. "There's
always been a large part of me that's also been very interested in
the present, and I didn't really know how to reconcile those two
things in academia," says Bhatt, who was born in India and grew up in
the U.S. "I found it was much more fun to use this incredible
critical apparatus that I had built up to create works of art. What I
love about theater is how collaborative it is. I learn from other
people, where scholarship is much more isolating."</LD>
<TE>   After trying her hand at various forms of creative writing, she's
about to launch a new career. The 37-year-old Bhatt has found success
with her very first attempt at playwriting. "Queen of the Remote
Control" premieres at East West Players on Wednesday, co-directed by
the playwright and the company's producing artistic director, Tim
Dang. Told from the point of view of a teenage girl yearning to
escape her Calabasas home, it's a black comedy about upward mobility
and Indian immigrant family values.</TE>
<TE>   According to Dang, " 'Queen of the Remote Control' delves into
many issues that the Asian Pacific community experiences: immigrant
parents versus their Americanized children; identity and
isolation--being a part of the Indian community and part of the
American community and not really being a part of either, and the
striving for success and status--the model minority."</TE>
<TE>   It's the first time East West Players has presented a work by a
writer of South Asian descent, and the first to feature a South Asian
cast.</TE>
<TE>   "The Asian Pacific community is an expansive community, and it is
America's perception that it includes only the more populated
communities--Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Filipino--and doesn't readily
recognize its many other communities--Thai, Cambodian, Hmong, Indian,
etc.," Dang says. The company "wants to broaden America's perception
by opening this door and in the process enlighten everyone, including
ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   The Sept. 11 timing of the opening of "Queen of the Remote
Control" was discussed at length. "Our opening nights are always on
Wednesday," Dang says. "This opening night happened to fall on Sept.
11. Our staff and board of directors had extensive dialogue regarding
the opening date and decided to proceed. As we are children of
immigrant families, we know the endurance, hardships and pain that we
have encountered in the past, and it is our strength to move on that
we celebrate.</TE>
<TE>   "It is very poignant that EWP premieres its first Indian play on
Sept. 11," he continues. "The Indian community has been unjustly
discriminated against in many ways because of the events of Sept. 11,
due to the lack of awareness and rush to judge people with certain
appearances. The Asian Pacific community faced this discrimination
when Japanese Americans were unjustly discriminated against during
WWII. This is EWP's way of opening our eyes to cultures we know
little about so that we do not live in fear."</TE>
<TE>   Set in 1999, before the bubble of dot-com glory burst and the
Nasdaq went south, "Queen of the Remote Control" satirizes one week
in the life of an upper-middle-class Indian American family. The
titular protagonist, 17-year-old Shilpa Shah, provides ironic
commentary on her parents as they happily anticipate the impending
marriage of her brother to the sister of an Internet billionaire.
Meanwhile, the young couple also relish the economic wisdom of their
union.</TE>
<TE>   Bhatt, who lives in Venice, describes Shilpa as "a terribly smart
misfit who doesn't quite know where she fits in. She's like a lot of
kids who are going through American culture, who don't really want to
fit into any of the particular cliques that dominate the high school
landscape."</TE>
<TE>   Although the play isn't autobiographical, there's a good deal of
Bhatt's experience in Shilpa's emotional life.</TE>
<TE>   Bhatt came to America at age 3. Her doctor parents moved the young
family around a great deal--to various cities in the U.S., back to
India, to Iran and back again to the States--giving the young Sujata
an appreciation of various cultures, but also a certain sense of
alienation.</TE>
<TE>   Her parents came to the U.S. at a time when the country was
encouraging doctors and engineers in particular to emigrate. "They
allowed professionals from Asia to start coming in," Bhatt says.
"Then in the late '80s, early '90s, you started to get all these
engineers, Silicon Valley types."</TE>
<TE>   It is the clash of these two immigrant generations that is central
to "Queen of the Remote Control." "Part of what the play is about is
what happens to the American dream of these immigrants once it moves
to a different level," Bhatt explains. "In the play, a 29-year-old
sells his company for a half-billion dollars.</TE>
<TE>   "So you have these people who thought they were at the
top--professionals, who were part of earlier waves of
immigration--finding that they've been not only completely overtaken
by another generation, but at a scale that you can't even imagine,"
she continues. "There's a fear of downward mobility that is actually
very strong."</TE>
<TE>   The family in Bhatt's play includes several doctors and future
doctors. According to the playwright, two-physician families such as
Bhatt's own are common among Indian immigrants, as are some of the
other attributes of the Shah household.</TE>
<TE>   "Queen of the Remote Control" started out as "a play about
patriarchy and a very strong, domineering father figure, which is,
again, very common in Indian middle-class family structure," she
says. "I love Kafka, and I was playing around, wondering what if
there's this family on stage where the family is literally a
cockroach, but the family doesn't seem to notice it at all?</TE>
<TE>   "Of course that was too literal," she continues. "But that was
just a sparking point to see how I could create this gap between what
the family was able to perceive about itself and what the audience
would be able to perceive about its dynamics."</TE>
<TE>   The Shahs naturally want to give their children every advantage,
but their choices are sometimes guided by outdated thinking. "The
parents have a secret that they have not told their family," Bhatt
says.</TE>
<TE>   "There's this feeling that you can come to America, and it's a
clean slate. They think, what's the point of bringing old prejudices
to a new world? Why not have the freedom to reinvent everything,
especially given the kind of ethnic and religious strife there is in
India."</TE>
<TE>   Seemingly dated beliefs come into conflict with more recent ideas
about cultural identity. "There is a lot of confusion for parents who
came over and were holding onto that ideal of Americanism about
remaking yourself," she says. "Their kids come along, and there's
this whole multiculturalism wave, and they're saying, 'No, we want to
know about our roots.' They didn't understand why their kids were
asking for these things."</TE>
<TE>   Bhatt can see both points of view, but multiculturalism looms
large in the not-for-profit theater. So while the existence of
culturally specific organizations, such as East West Players, has
helped launch her new theater career, she is also wary of being
pigeonholed as a South Asian writer.</TE>
<TE>   For that reason among others, her next play isn't about Indian
immigrants. Yet as befits a recovering historian, it's once again
contemporary. "The play I'm working on now is more of an experimental
piece," she says. "It has five different sets of characters, each of
which is a stereotype of Los Angeles, and each of them has a story,
and at some point they intersect. There are ex-surfer dudes ... gold
diggers and bohemian Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "There're no South Asians in that one," Bhatt continues. "I don't
want to ghettoize myself as a playwright of a particular culture."</TE>

<HD>With a Break in the Action, Lions Gate Pounces</HD>

<LD>Say you're the head of a company that produces and releases
independent films. Your fall slate includes a dark comedy about an
office assistant whose boss is into spanking; a drama about moral
dilemmas Jews faced in Auschwitz; a social satire with a cast of teen
heartthrobs; and an erotic thriller that's been on the shelf for two
years.</LD>
<LD>   Do you release any of these films against "Spider-Man," "Star
Wars: Episode II" or "Austin Powers in Goldmember"?</LD>
<LD>   Probably not. You wait until the multiplexes are less crowded, the
critics are sick of the stream of mindless summer action films, and
you no longer have to compete with Tom Cruise, Harrison Ford and Ben
Affleck talk-show time.</LD>
<TE>   That's why Lions Gate Films is releasing "Secretary," "The Grey
Zone," "The Rules of Attraction" and "The Weight of Water" in the
next eight weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Lions Gate is the company that released "Monster's Ball" and
"Affliction," which won acting Oscars for Halle Berry and James
Coburn, respectively. It has enjoyed a degree of commercial success
with provocative, edgy fare, including such films as "Dogma,"
"American Psycho" and "O." It releases an average of 15 movies a
year. (By comparison, the major studios often release anywhere from
15 to 30 films annually and the studio "classics" divisions average
six to 10 a year.) And, unlike the major studios, which can spend $30
million or $40 million on prints and advertising for a single
blockbuster opening in thousands of theaters, it spends a million or
two for a film that may appear in a few hundred.</TE>
<TE>   "Dogma" and "Monster's Ball" are Lions Gate's two most successful
films, each bringing in about $31 million at the box office.</TE>
<TE>   "Typically for the small independent ... they look for windows, or
holes, in the studio releasing game so they can get a little more
exposure and not have to face stiff competition," says Dan Marks,
executive vice president of Nielsen EDI, which tracks box office
numbers for the industry.</TE>
<TE>   According to Lions Gate Chief Executive Jon Feltheimer, the
company's strategy is to find films that already have a built-in
audience hook.</TE>
<TE>   "We're always looking for pictures that have some level of
marketing built into them, whether it's the [Bret Easton Ellis] book
in 'American Psycho,' the intensity and sexuality of 'Monster's
Ball,' or the edginess of 'Rules of Attraction,' " he says. "Either
through the content, the casting, the filmmaker or a combination,
we're looking for some angle when we're greenlighting or acquiring a
movie that we believe will make it stand out."</TE>
<TE>   Tom Ortenberg, president of Lions Gate Films Releasing, is the man
in charge of the company's marketing and distribution. Although many
of the company's films are cutting-edge, he says that everything it
does isn't necessarily destined for the art house. He calls "The
Rules of Attraction," for example, "a more straightforward commercial
proposition" than the others.</TE>
<TE>   "These films all landed in this season independently of each
other, on their own set of circumstances," Ortenberg says. "This play
period just felt right for each movie." All four, incidentally, are
expected to be rated R.</TE>
<TE>   "Secretary" opens Sept. 20 in New York and L.A. and in the top 15
markets a week later. It stars Maggie Gyllenhaal as a troubled young
woman who takes a job as secretary to a lawyer (James Spader) and
embarks on a surprising sexual relationship with him. Variety
referred to it as "an S&amp;M romance," and Ortenberg says that "it's a
very risky film," although he also calls it "the most original love
story of the year."</TE>
<TE>   Lions Gate acquired it after it played the Sundance Film Festival
and initially considered a summer release. But, Ortenberg says, the
company "wanted critics and feature writers around the country to
discover Maggie Gyllenhaal" and decided to launch it at the Toronto
Film Festival.</TE>
<TE>   "The Rules of Attraction" is the sole wide commercial release of
the quartet, opening on 1,500 screens Oct. 11. "We're playing our
strongest hand right out of the gate," Ortenberg says. James Van Der
Beek (of the WB TV series "Dawson's Creek"), Jessica Biel ("7th
Heaven," also a WB series) and Shannon Sossamon ("A Knight's Tale")
are in this adaptation of another Bret Easton Ellis novel, a satire
about disaffected college students discovering sex, drugs and rock
'n' roll.</TE>
<TE>   Ortenberg calls it "a dark comedy dripping with satire," which was
briefly considered for a summer release. But it was ultimately deemed
a smarter bet to target college audiences who have just returned to
classes. The posters are aimed at the college crowd, campus
screenings are being set, and an entire marketing campaign is being
directed toward the post-high-school demographic.</TE>
<TE>   "The Grey Zone" is probably the toughest marketing challenge but
is being positioned as an early Oscar contender. David Arquette,
Steve Buscemi, Harvey Keitel and Mira Sorvino star in this Holocaust
drama about the Sonderkommando, Jewish prisoners who become Nazi
collaborators. Tim Blake Nelson ("O") wrote and directed it.</TE>
<TE>   "A very difficult film, without question," notes Ortenberg, but
"as Oscar-worthy as any other movie we've released." It will open in
New York and Los Angeles on Oct. 11. (Because that date is becoming
crowded, Ortenberg says, it might slide to Oct. 4 or 18.) Because it
has awards potential, a year-end release was considered, but early
fall was chosen to "let the film gestate with critics, with
audiences, with award committees."</TE>
<TE>   "The Weight of Water" poses a different challenge. The film,
starring Sean Penn and Elizabeth Hurley, was directed by Kathryn
Bigelow before she shot this summer's "K-19: The Widowmaker." The
buzz is never good about a movie that's been sitting around for two
years.</TE>
<TE>   Lions Gate picked up "Weight" at the Toronto Film Festival in
September 2000. It had been scheduled for a fall release last year,
but Bigelow's work on the big-budget thriller "K-19" precluded her
involvement in the marketing campaign until recently. Several critics
liked the film, he says, and "the hope is that its champions come out
forcefully in support of the picture, knowing that it's taken a
difficult road to theaters." It will open in the top 10 markets on
Nov. 1.</TE>
<TE>   "In essence," says Ortenberg, "we need to build a better mousetrap
in marketing and distributing our movies because we are not in a
position to throw money at them. And we're happy about that. We
prefer it."</TE>

<DH>Roger Avary hopes to return to his 'Pulp Fiction' form with
a story that echoes his own college years</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Aspiring filmmakers spending time in front of the mirror practicing
Oscar speeches and dreaming of fame and creative freedom could learn
a thing or two from Roger Avary.</LD>
<LD>   The 37-year-old writer-director won an Academy Award in 1995 for
co-writing the wildly influential "Pulp Fiction" with Quentin
Tarantino. Although Avary can claim the distinction of stealing the
spotlight from the usually garrulous Tarantino that night (he ended
their acceptance speech by announcing, "I'm gonna go now 'cause I
really have to take a pee"), it's Tarantino who went on to fame and
fortune. Only dedicated "Pulp" fans recognize Avary's name.</LD>
<LD>   Having a low profile, however, suits Avary just fine. "I prefer to
wander out to the movies and not be recognized," he says in the
office behind his Manhattan Beach home. "There's greater liberty in
that path in life. I've got to wonder, can you be normal and exist
among people and continue to relate to the real world in your work if
you are a media celebrity?"</LD>
<TE>   He speaks from experience. After his Oscar win, his brief
flirtation with fame gave him a taste of the bizarre--porn stars have
suggested creative uses of his Oscar statuette--and the discomfort of
unbearable pressure.</TE>
<TE>   He used to leave the award on his desk by the computer. "I'd sit
down to start writing," he explains. "I'd look at it and it would
just suck the life out of everything I was doing. It was like, all of
a sudden, whatever I was working on, it had to stand up next to the
Academy Award. I couldn't just write for fun."</TE>
<TE>   The little golden man now rests inside a tool drawer in Avary's
house.</TE>
<TE>   Rejecting fame may have bought him a more normal personal life,
but it hasn't helped his filmmaking ambitions. His directorial debut,
1994's "Killing Zoe," was made with the help of Tarantino as
executive producer, but the film was lost in the flood "Pulp
Fiction's" pre-release hype.</TE>
<TE>   Avary's follow-up, 1996's "Mr. Stitch," received its premiere on
cable's Sci-Fi Channel. It's with the Oct. 11 release of this fall's
"The Rules of Attraction" that Avary finally stands a chance of
reminding Hollywood who he is.</TE>
<TE>   The film, an adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis' 1987 novel, follows
the lives of three undergraduates involved in a love triangle at a
small East Coast liberal arts college, and their classmates'
excessive experiences with sex, drugs and alcohol. Toying with
narrative and cinematic conventions, Avary has attempted his most
ambitious and stylized film, and he's cast a roster of Hollywood's
Next Big Things, including James Van Der Beek, Shannyn Sossamon,
Jessica Biel, Kip Pardue, Ian Somerhalder and Kate Bosworth.</TE>
<TE>   It was while Avary was himself a college undergraduate at Menlo
College in the San Francisco Bay Area during the late '80s that he
first read "Rules of Attraction."</TE>
<TE>   Having been a big Ellis fan since the novelist's debut, "Less Than
Zero," Avary grabbed "The Rules of Attraction" immediately upon its
publication. "It was the first time I'd read something that was vivid
and absolutely true to what I was seeing around me at the time,"
Avary says. "I'm reading it and I'm thinking to myself, I have to
make this."</TE>
<TE>   Both Ellis and Avary are familiar with controversy. Ellis received
a critical and public lashing with the release of his 1991 Wall
Street serial-killer novel, "American Psycho." Avary's work, with
"Pulp Fiction's" hired killers and depraved hillbillies, has been a
flashpoint for those seeking to pin blame on the popularizing and
glorifying of violent crime dramas in the mid-to late '90s. Joe Brown
described "Killing Zoe" in The Washington Post as "a toxic, repulsive
film."</TE>
<TE>   "My point of view tends to be so intense that people either really
vibe to it or they don't." Avary says. "If they don't, then they're
strongly negative about it. There's very little ambivalence in
between."</TE>
<TE>   He's heard the criticisms of Ellis' work and expects his film
adaptation to get more of the same. "When you're doing social
criticism the way [Ellis] does it--nihilistic social
criticism--people tend to turn off to you a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   Despite his enthusiasm for the material, Avary could not figure
out a way of turning the essentially plotless novel into a film.
(Ellis himself made an unsuccessful attempt at a screenplay and has
no involvement with Avary's adaptation.) He would finally figure it
out a decade later, but at the time, the temptations of real-life
debauchery were too great. Even after establishing himself in
Hollywood, lucrative writing assignments on still unproduced scripts
kept him distracted from personal projects. Avary's lifestyle in
college wasn't much different from that of the hard-partying students
in the film. He's proud to show off photos of himself vomiting into a
metal bucket.</TE>
<TE>   After graduating from college, Avary moved back to his hometown of
Manhattan Beach and attempted to break into the film industry. His
early experience as a production assistant on the TV show "Cops" left
him disillusioned. It was advice from his friend and boss, "Cops"
producer John Langley, that helped Avary get his career back on
track.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'If I were you, I would start at the job you want to end
up at. If you want to be a director, be a director right from the
start. If you do anything else, people are going to pigeonhole you.'
So I said, 'OK, I quit,' and I walked out right then," Avary says.</TE>
<TE>   He spent the next few years telling everyone he encountered that
he was a director, even while working behind the counter at a local
video store, Video Archives. There he met and befriended Tarantino,
at that time another aspiring filmmaker with a day job.</TE>
<TE>   The two began collaborating on screenplays that eventually became
"Pulp Fiction," "True Romance" and "Natural Born Killers." "Reservoir
Dogs," Tarantino's 1992 directorial debut, was written without
Avary's help, although he contributed background dialogue for radio
broadcasts heard during the film. It was soon after "Pulp's" smash
success that Avary and Tarantino's partnership dissolved and they
began sniping at each other in interviews.</TE>
<TE>   Avary still appears to have conflicted feelings about his friend.
"I love Quentin like a brother," he explains. "If I'm upset at
anything about any of the projects that I worked with Quentin on,
it's that I'm upset that he wouldn't do for me what I would do for
him or anybody else. That extends into normal life. Everybody thinks
that I am of the opinion that Quentin changed when he became a
filmmaker. He didn't change at all; he just became more intense.</TE>
<TE>   "I wrote a scene for 'Natural Born Killers,' and everybody kept
saying, 'It's the best scene in the movie.' Do you think Quentin ever
once told them, 'Oh, that was written by Roger?' That was in the days
when I could have used the work and I could have used a little bit of
the recognition." (Tarantino and Avary's script was heavily rewritten
by Oliver Stone and his writers, and Avary's scene no longer appears
in the film.)</TE>
<TE>   Avary stops himself, perhaps feeling guilty about venting his
frustrations about his former friend. He begins to recount the
aspects of Tarantino that he loved. "He's funny and fun to be around
and clever and a brilliant, brilliant mind who certainly doesn't need
to be working with me."</TE>
<TE>   Tarantino is in China, directing his next film, "Kill Bill," and
representatives couldn't reach him for comment, though they report
that he is eager to see "The Rules of Attraction." It seems the only
thing working against Avary now is his age. The 15 years it's taken
to bring the novel to the screen has seen him transformed from the
hard-partying college student to a married father of two
preschool-aged children. He put out a request on his Web site for
invitations to college parties so he could see what they look like
now.</TE>
<TE>   Van Der Beek had no reservations about having someone so removed
from the college scene directing his performance. "He was the one
saying, 'Why not?' " the actor says. "He was the one encouraging us
all to go for it. Instigator would be an appropriate term for it."</TE>
<TE>   Glimpses of Avary the partyer can still be seen. He cheerfully
offers to expose himself to a photographer and uses rough language in
expressing his displeasure about his current troubles with the MPAA
ratings board.</TE>
<TE>   Although he made the film with an eye on releasing it unrated,
Lion's Gate, the film's distributor, has concerns about releasing it
unrated and asked him to submit it to the MPAA.</TE>
<TE>   A homosexual masturbatory fantasy scene involving Somerhalder and
Van Der Beek's characters is the subject of the ratings board's
objections.</TE>
<TE>   "In 2002, we view it as virtually impossible to take a picture out
on a wide-release basis either NC-17 or unrated," explains Tom
Ortenberg, president of Lions Gate Films Releasing. "Too many
theaters won't play [them]. Until that climate changes, then we're
not even in the position to take an art-house picture out unrated."</TE>
<TE>   "They're homophobes at the MPAA is what I think," Avary says more
bluntly. Still, he desires the kind of mainstream success as a
director that Tarantino has already achieved and will do what is
necessary to get the R rating, even if it means trimming down the
scene.</TE>
<TE>   He bristles at the suggestion that "The Rules of Attraction" be
released in art houses. "I plan on opening at a real theater," he
says flatly. "I want to have a real release for this film."</TE>
<TE>   It's possible that Avary may be getting more comfortable in his
role as a responsible adult. His plans for future projects include a
kids' film, and he acknowledges the irony. "I'm one of the parents in
America the MPAA is trying to protect me from."</TE>

<DH>'The Four Feathers' was a saga of Victorian manners. A
young Hollywood cast subtly changes the meaning.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID FREEMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"The Four Feathers," A.E.W. Mason's 1902 novel of cowardice and
redemption, has been the source of at least five movies (three of
them silent) and a 1977 TV miniseries. The 1939 version with Ralph
Richardson seems to have a permanent place in the movie memory of the
middle-aged.</LD>
<LD>   It would be hard to overstate the affection that cinema buffs and
Anglophiles hold for "The Four Feathers." Now, a new production from
Paramount and Miramax, with young Hollywood stars, will open on Sept.
20. In the various versions, the story remains essentially this: In
Victorian England, a young regimental officer, Harry Feversham, the
only son of a distinguished military family and engaged to the
beautiful Ethne, is to be sent to fight in the Sudan. Possibly out of
fear and possibly out of a sense of obligation to Ethne, Harry
resigns his commission. Three fellow officers send him white
feathers, symbols of cowardice. Ethne gives him a fourth and breaks
off the engagement. Harry is disgraced, and to restore his honor, he
secretly follows his regiment to the Sudan, where his friend and
fellow officer Jack Durrance fights bravely and loses his sight. Both
men are in love with Ethne.</LD>
<TE>   This story is finally and irreducibly about Englishness. A man is
accused of cowardice and sacrifices years of his life enduring
astonishing hardships to make amends. Other cultures have had
elaborate codes of chivalry, certainly, but in matters of honor no
one outdoes the English officer class of the Victorian age. Mason's
novel is an adventure story, but it's also, crucially, a novel of
manners and codes of behavior. Someone, it seems, is always
sacrificing him or herself. People do the most unpleasant and
inconvenient things possible out of an uncompromising idea of what is
right. Unless you believe that Harry, Ethne and Jack are operating
under ironclad social rules, then little of what happens makes much
psychological sense.</TE>
<TE>   During the period of this story, the English were in the Sudan, an
enormous and unforgiving place that shares a border with Egypt, to
look after their Egyptian interests. There was much talk of spreading
God's word, but in the end, the English were protecting the Suez
Canal, which gave them control of the shipping lanes as well as
access to Arabia and the northern route to India. In modern times,
the U.S. talks about spreading democracy to countries in the Middle
East, though our deeper interest is its oil.</TE>
<TE>   The most distinguished non-fictional participant in the Sudan
campaign was Lt. Winston Churchill, who was a cavalry officer
attached to the 21st Lancers at the battle of Omdurman in 1898. That
battle, for the city that also figures in "The Four Feathers," has
often been called the British Army's last cavalry charge. Churchill
was both a fighting officer and a war correspondent, filing
dispatches from the front, an arrangement unthinkable today. The
following year, he published his account of the campaign as "The
River War."</TE>
<TE>   The long-standing English fascination with Araby is reflected in
their cinema. The greatest of all the Brits-in-the-sand movies is
"Lawrence of Arabia." Another example, closer to the events of "The
Four Feathers," is "Khartoum," the 1966 movie of Gen. "Chinese"
Gordon's battle with the Mahdi, the desert leader, a Muslim fanatic
whose views of the West seem out of today's headlines. Gordon was a
hero of the time who died rather than leave Khartoum. He was
something of a fanatic himself. His reputation suffered after Lytton
Strachey, in "Eminent Victorians," debunked Gordon's heroism as
failed political maneuvering. In "Khartoum," Laurence Olivier, in
bronze makeup, plays the Mahdi and Charlton Heston is the general.
Ralph Richardson, a generation after he played Jack Durrance in the
1939 "Four Feathers," is Gordon's nemesis, Prime Minister William
Gladstone. Once again, Richardson walks off with every scene he's in.</TE>
<TE>   I don't mean to suggest that the 1939 film is a masterpiece. It's
the sort of English movie in which all the older men look like C.
Aubrey Smith. One of them actually is C. Aubrey Smith. The picture
was made by the Korda brothers--Alexander produced, Zoltan directed
and Vincent designed it. It's a period piece, but it is emotionally
true to its subject matter. It had something of a cultural impact. As
late as the 1960s, comedian Don Adams was getting laughs imitating
Richardson in the Sudan in a comic pastiche of English imperial war
movies.</TE>
<TE>   The new production of "The Four Feathers," directed by Shekhar
Kapur ("Elizabeth") from an adaptation by Michael Schiffer and
Hossein Amini, is lavish and scrupulously mounted. Every costume and
military operation feels authentic, and it's closer to Mason's novel
than the 1939 version.</TE>
<TE>   There is, however, a crucial scene in that earlier production that
isn't in the book. On patrol in the desert, Richardson, as Durrance,
falls victim to sunstroke. He goes blind. An English officer to his
core, he will not abandon his men, so he pretends he can see, going
into battle, shouting orders. The 19th century ethic of duty over all
else paradoxically seems like futile bluster to 21st century eyes.
It's a potent dramatic metaphor for the English adventure in the
Sudan. Durrance's blindness and his subsequent sacrifices remain,
rightly, an important part of this new version, although there is no
equivalent to that stumbling command.</TE>
<TE>   The casting of Heath Ledger, who is Australian, as Harry, Wes
Bentley as Jack and Kate Hudson as Ethne is an attempt to reach a
young audience who has never heard of "The Four Feathers" and may not
have heard of the 19th century. All three actors have worked hard on
their English accents, but Kate Hudson remains as American as a
Chevrolet. It probably won't much matter to the hoped-for audience.
Ledger and Bentley have their moments of emotional plausibility, but
less success entering into the mind-set of the class and the era.
They aren't helped by a script that has Harry reading Jack's mail,
unthinkable to Victorian gentlemen. Similarly, the occasional
emotional outbursts are unlikely.</TE>
<TE>   Casting American stars to play Brits is an old Hollywood custom.
Sometimes it works--Gwyneth Paltrow regularly manages it, but it
usually comes off as slightly off-key. The conundrum is that the
weaker the physical production, the more effective such casting
feels. In "Beau Geste," for instance, the old Foreign Legion story,
Gary Cooper is an Englishman in the desert. That movie has memorable
scenes, but the sets are so patently false and Cooper is so deeply
American that the confusions are of a piece. Here, so much
intelligence has been lavished on costumes and photography that the
gap between the realism of the physical production and the cultural
inauthenticity of the characters is all the more apparent.</TE>
<TE>   Harry Feversham began life in a short story in the Illustrated
London News. Mason later made him and his distant friends into a
novel that now seems to reflect the soul of the Victorian military
and that, over time, has led to this movie. Perhaps Ledger's
sensitive face--at one point he looks like the poet
Shelley--Bentley's haunting intensity and Hudson's sunny nature will
find new favor, 100 years after these memorable characters first made
their entrances on the public stage of the imagination.</TE>

<HD>His Career Is No Stunt</HD>
<DH>Comedy may be his forte, but Jackie Chan is quite serious
about which movies he chooses</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGH HART</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jackie Chan has dangled from a Hollywood street sign, slid through
pools of fire, leaped off buildings and tangled with an
out-of-control helicopter, earning nearly a billion dollars in
worldwide box office for his troubles. But this fall represents a
first for the 48-year-old action star.</LD>
<LD>   In "The Tuxedo," Chan's stunts are augmented with special effects.
Up until now, Chan himself was the special effect, and he's a tad
nervous about the results. "I don't know. It makes me worry," Chan
says.</LD>
<LD>   Why? "I try to do special effects a long time but I don't know
how, so I always stayed with my style, Jackie Chan style."</LD>
<TE>   But Chan listened when DreamWorks pitched him a special-effects
spy spoof, if only because it meant he'd get to meet his hero, Steven
Spielberg.</TE>
<TE>   "When Spielberg see me, I said, 'I just want to know how you do
that, with the dinosaurs jumping around,' and he say, 'It's so easy,
just push button, button, button, button.' I say, 'Oh, button. OK.'</TE>
<TE>   "Then Spielberg say, 'Jackie, let me ask you something: How do you
go flying from the roof to the building?' I say, 'Easy. You roll and
jump.' "</TE>
<TE>   The masters always make it look easy. Like Gene Kelly or Charlie
Chaplin or Muhammad Ali, Chan has channeled prodigious physical gifts
into remaking a traditional performance style in his own image. Since
his 1998 international hit "Rush Hour," Jackie Chan has become known
to moviegoers around the world as that funny martial arts guy who
speaks broken English and whirls around at warp speed beating
villains to a pulp.</TE>
<TE>   Jet-lagged after a flight from Hong Kong, Chan didn't fall asleep
until 10 in the morning during a recent visit to Los Angeles. But
three hours later, showing no sign of fatigue, he waltzed into his
manager's Beverly Hills office for an early-afternoon interview.</TE>
<TE>   Dressed head to toe in white, Chan sat down, jumped up, slumped in
his chair, made faces and provided his own sound effects. Tireless?
Evidently.</TE>
<TE>   "The Tuxedo," aimed at 11-to 16-year-olds, will likely fortify
Chan's popularity among young viewers. But how the film plays to his
longtime fan base is of equal importance to Chan. Acutely sensitive
to audience feedback, the actor can rattle off grosses, territory by
territory, for each of his films.</TE>
<TE>   He once experimented with a dramatic role. The film only did so-so
at the Asian box office. Chan hasn't made what he calls a "crying
movie" since. Not that he needs to fret about losing his Asian
filmgoers. For more than two decades, his action flicks have
dominated the Far East box office. "In Hong Kong, I'm like king on
the set," he says. "Director, writer, producer, star--it's one-man
show."</TE>
<TE>   But his reach has always extended beyond Asia. Chan wants to stay
hot in the Western world, and he's shrewd enough to realize that
continued success in the English-speaking world depends on good
chemistry with contrary co-stars.</TE>
<TE>   "Without Chris Tucker, 'Rush Hour' would not be so successful," he
says. "And without me, not as successful. But together, boom!" Chan
also mentions "Shanghai Knights," the sequel (due in 2003) to his
movie "Shanghai Noon," co-starring Owen Wilson. "Then, almost like a
formula, the second one with Owen Wilson, same thing. I will continue
to find different partners, maybe children or even with a dog or a
monkey, because in the American market, I need somebody's help." In
"The Tuxedo," which opens Sept. 27, that somebody is Jennifer Love
Hewitt. In the film, Chan plays a chauffeur who suddenly acquires the
ability to dance, sing and do kung fu when he dons a high-tech dinner
jacket. Hewitt plays a rookie agent who teams up with Chan.</TE>
<TE>   Chan may be content to share the billing in American-made
pictures, but not if it means playing a villain. Smarting after the
failure of two Hollywood features, "The Big Brawl" (1980) and "The
Protector" (1985), Chan was invited in 1988 to appear opposite
Michael Douglas in "Black Rain." Only one problem: He'd have to play
a drug dealer. Chan turned it down.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't mind being a co-star, but bad guy?" he says, sipping a
cup of warm water. "I tell them, I just cannot do it. I'd been
creating my image so many years. I believe the Asian audience would
have killed me. So, no."</TE>
<TE>   The role model business is something Chan takes seriously. "Being
an actor, you should do many things, not only one thing. But I think
my case is different because I receive so many letters from all the
young children and the parents who write me. I get letter from the
young mother: 'I don't like the one shot where you grab somebody's
crotch.' For me, it's funny but it's dirty funny. So, I go, 'OK, I'm
not going to do that anymore.' Year by year, no more breaking
fingers, poking eyes, we take that out. Now, I can almost say, my
action is clean action."</TE>
<TE>   Parents no doubt appreciate Chan's clean-living message, but
action aficionados idolize the star because he has always insisted on
doing his own stunts. And accidents happen. Chan cheerfully reenacts
his run-in with a helicopter rotor blade that left him with fractured
ribs, cheekbones and shoulder blades. Matter-of-factly, he offers a
tour of injuries: broken eye socket, broken nose, broken jaw,
sprained neck, damaged vertebrae, dislocated pelvic girdle, split
skull, dislocated sternum, dislocated neck, broken toe, cracked
hipbone, split upper lip, burned hands and torn neck ligaments.</TE>
<TE>   How does he stand the pain? Chan's resilience might be traced to a
childhood that reads like the adventures of Barnum &amp; Bailey as told
by Charles Dickens. When he was 6, Chan's parents indentured him to
the Peking Opera School, a Hong Kong arts center that trained gifted
children. In the custody of teachers there, Chan endured beatings
without complaint.</TE>
<TE>   Gesturing at the conference table where he's sitting, Chan
demonstrates: "You're 7 years old and the teacher says, 'Jump across
the table.' 'But I cannot' ... whaap!" He mimes being slapped. "And
then you jump!"</TE>
<TE>   For 10 years, Chan studied martial arts, acrobatics, tumbling and
pantomime 18 hours a day, seven days a week. After graduation, he
became a movie stunt coordinator and, in 1976, starred in a John Woo
feature that flopped.</TE>
<TE>   Disheartened, he moved in with his parents in Australia, where his
father cooked for the U.S. Embassy. Chan soon returned to Hong Kong,
promising his father he would give up show business if he didn't
become a star within 24 months.</TE>
<TE>   "At that time," Chan recalls, "everybody so serious. Director
would say, 'Jackie, don't smile, don't make funny face. Be tough.'
But that's not me. I always the most naughty in my class."</TE>
<TE>   So with director Woo-Ping Yuan, who would later create the stunt
sequences in "The Matrix," Chan devised a subversive approach to the
status quo. "Everything at that time was Bruce Lee. So we decide,
we'll do the opposite. We be more fancy, more pretty, more comedy."
Chan springs to his toes, suddenly moving as light as a ballet
dancer. "When Bruce Lee kick high, I kick low. Where he goes 'arrgh'
"--Chan scowls fiercely--"I go 'whoosh!' " Chan bugs his eyes
comically, feigning fright.</TE>
<TE>   Asian audiences ate it up in 1978, when Chan starred in his first
hit, "Snake in the Eagle's Shadow," followed by "Drunken Master." By
the mid-'80s, Chan called the shots as director, producer, star and
stunt choreographer of his films. Working 12-hour days, gulping down
bits of rice in place of lunch breaks, Chan understood exactly what
his fans wanted and knew how to deliver it.</TE>
<TE>   But in America, nobody knew Jackie Chan. That changed in 1996,
when New Line dubbed his Hong Kong film "Rumble in the Bronx" in
English and released it domestically.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Dergarabedian of Exhibitor Relations Inc., which tracks box
office trends, remembers a screening of that movie at a 1995
exhibitors convention. "People were just overwhelmed. The movie
itself was kind of cheesy, but Jackie was undeniable." "Rumble" was
No. 1 in its opening weekend, earning $10 million. Hollywood came
calling.</TE>
<TE>   Chan remembers, "All the scripts come in and I say, 'I'm not going
to do this, I'm not going to do that.' My manager tells me, 'If you
never try, you never know. You should do this one.' That was 'Rush
Hour,' then, boom, success, even though I didn't like the movie. I
still don't like the movie."</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't like the film that put him on the map outside of Asia
and grossed $226 million worldwide? "I don't like the way I speak
English, and I don't know what Chris Tucker is saying," Chan replies.
"The movie exciting, the people smiling, and audiences like it, so
it's OK, but it's American-style: more dialogue, more drama, a little
bit fighting. If you see my Hong Kong movies, you know what happens:
Bam bam bam, always Jackie Chan-style, me, 10 minutes of fighting."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Chan, Tucker and director Brett Rattner reunited for
"Rush Hour 2." Rolf Mittweg, New Line's president of worldwide
distribution and marketing, hopes to seal a deal for "Rush Hour 3,"
and no wonder. "Rush Hour" and its sequel grossed about $550 million
worldwide. Roughly half the revenue came from foreign territories.</TE>
<TE>   "The 'Rush Hour' movies are much the same as 'Lethal Weapon'
because they don't take themselves so seriously," Mittweg says.
"Sometimes action movies go overboard with the violence. Action
comedies are much more digestible."</TE>
<TE>   Since "Rush Hour," Chan has alternated between Hollywood projects
and his own Hong Kong-based productions. "In Asia, they like the old
way," Chan says.</TE>
<TE>   Poshek Fu, author of "The Cinema of Hong Kong" and professor of
cinema studies at the University of Illinois, says the
Hollywood-ization of Jackie Chan has disappointed some purists. "The
American movies show off more of Jackie's comic aspect, but it seems
like he's sometimes upstaged by his co-stars, and there's less and
less action. I hear from people in Hong Kong who are not too excited
about his American films. What we miss now is the sheer brilliance of
his stunts, because in his early films, the martial arts scenes were
tremendous."</TE>
<TE>   The numbers tell the story. Chan says, " 'Rush Hour' 1 in Hong
Kong makes $12 million. Then my Hong Kong movie 'Accidental Spy,' $45
million. 'Shanghai Noon' in Asia, almost $18 million, but then I do
'Gorgeous' in Hong Kong--$35 million. So every year I do one or two
American movies, and then I make Jackie Chan-style movie for my old
fans."</TE>
<TE>   For young fans, there's "Jackie Chan Adventures," which begins its
third season Saturday on Kids WB (partly owned by Tribune Co., which
also owns the Los Angeles Times). It's the top-rated TV series among
boys 2 to 11 in the United States, and foreign distributor Columbia
TriStar Television International reports "tremendous popularity" for
the show in England, Germany, Italy, Spain, Israel, South America and
the Far East.</TE>
<TE>   Rich, famous and scandal-free, save for a 1999 admission that he
may have fathered a daughter with Hong Kong actress Elaine Ng, Chan
rarely takes a day off. After completing "The Tuxedo," Chan filmed
"High Binders" in Ireland. It's set to open next year.</TE>
<TE>   In winter 2003, "Shanghai Knights" will be released by Columbia.
He's remaking "Around the World in 80 Days" and produces films in
Hong Kong, where he lives with his wife, former Taiwan movie star Lin
Feng-chiao, and their teenage son, Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   With nearly 100 movies under his black belt, what makes Jackie
run?</TE>
<TE>   For the first time in more than an hour, Chan pauses.</TE>
<TE>   Then: "I want people to remember me," he says. "One day, I hope
the history book will read, 'So and so, John Wayne, so and so, Bruce
Lee, oh, Jackie Chan, look, he do so many things.' Even now, the
young kids still see Buster Keaton movies or Harold Lloyd. So I hope
one day, they might go, 'There's Harold Lloyd, there's Jackie Chan.'
Yes, that's why I'm here, in this life."</TE>

<HD>It's Not Just a Translation of Rap</HD>
<DH>Two artists take rap en espanol into authentic Latin
territory. However, getting it heard hasn't been easy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERNESTO LECHNER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The voice is beginning to sound tense and edgy. It already has a
rough quality, with its flamenco tinge and brusque accent, but
there's a layer of anger that's new and intimidating, even through a
transatlantic phone line. There's no doubt about it: "La Mala" (the
Mean One) Rodriguez is losing her patience.</LD>
<LD>   "So what are you saying?" the 23-year-old Spanish rapper snaps at
the mention of the myriad heroin references in her profanity-laced
rhymes. "Are you asking me if I do drugs? Sure, I've done drugs. Big
deal."</LD>
<LD>   With the streetwise flow of a consummate MC, she adds, "El que no
fuma, ha fumado o va a fumar." Whoever's not smoking has already
smoked or will soon be doing it.</LD>
<TE>   Welcome to the world of Maria Rodriguez Garrido, a.k.a. La Mala,
the most explosive, enigmatic and talented rapper in the Latin world.
Normally, Americans wouldn't hear much about her, but the Universal
Latino label's recent release of her debut album, "Lujo Iberico"
(Iberian Luxury), and the Universal-distributed Surco's "Emigrante,"
the new collection by the revamped and vastly improved Cuban outfit
Orishas, has ushered in a new wave of progressive-minded rap en
espanol in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   It's about time. Aside from cheesy mergers of hip-hop with
merengue by groups such as Proyecto Uno, and the Chicano rap
movement, which has more in common with mainstream rap than with
Latin music, the presence of Spanish rap in the U.S. has been limited
mostly to the punk-rock shenanigans of Molotov, the
middle-of-the-road soundscapes of Control Machete, and the
funk-friendly jams of Illya Kuryaki &amp; the Valderramas.</TE>
<TE>   Overseas, it's a different story.</TE>
<TE>   In Spain, rap has been growing as an underground genre since 1994,
with notable collectives such as Solo Los Solo, 7 Notas 7 Colores and
Violadores del Verso. In Latin America, Chile is a rapper's paradise,
with outfits such as Tiro de Gracia, Makiza and La Pose Latina
releasing essential albums and drawing crowds as large as 5,000 to
concerts.</TE>
<TE>   But U.S.-based Latino labels haven't shown any interest in
releasing modern rap classics such as Solo Los Solo's "Quimera" or
Makiza's "Aerolineas Makiza" in a market dominated by glossy pop and
rootsy norteno. The Mexican and Central American immigrants who form
the bulk of the Latin music market don't listen to it, so why should
a label that's selling a million copies of Los Tucanes de Tijuana put
money and energy into rap?</TE>
<TE>   "As long as radio stations refuse to program this kind of
material, rap en espanol will never be a commercially viable genre,"
says Elena Rodrigo, Universal Latino's national marketing manager of
alternative product and the person most responsible for getting the
Rodriguez album released in the U.S. "Getting [pop-rock singer]
Juanes on Latino radio stations was already a feat, and he's
extremely commercial. Forget about them playing Orishas or La Mala."</TE>
<TE>   Just as it took Latin American rock a few decades of
trial-and-error to find its artistic identity, Spanish rap has
struggled to avoid being a mere imitation of its North American
counterpart.</TE>
<TE>   That's why "Lujo Iberico" stands as a seminal effort..</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez doesn't attempt to translate the aesthetic of rap.
Rather, she transposes it to the vernacular of the barrios of her
hometown, Seville, while adapting it to her persona as a callous,
occasionally vicious and always upfront independent woman with
nothing to fear.</TE>
<TE>   What she's taken from her favorite MCs such as Snoop Dogg and
Nas--the braggadocio, the concept of the opposite sex as mere object
of pleasure, the idea of an individual code of ethics that functions
within a marginalized world--she's tailored to the richness, humor
and irony of the Spanish language.</TE>
<TE>   On "Tambalea," a song about continually gaining and losing
control, she displays a remarkable poetic imagination, spitting out a
long series of rhymes ending with the "ea" sound (jalea--jam;
marea--to get you dizzy; pelea--to fight; menea--to shake; and an
expletive or two to boot). The track is intensely sensuous and
hypnotic.</TE>
<TE>   Still, La Mala has some growing up to do artistically. At times,
the album's production (by Jota Mayuscula and Supernafamacho, former
members of Spanish rap collective El Club de los Poetas Violentos)
fails to match Rodriguez's brooding delivery. At its best, however,
"Lujo Iberico" takes rap en espanol to a new level of maturity and
artistic independence.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Rodriguez, members of the Paris-based Cuban trio Orishas
emerge as wide-eyed idealists on "Emigrante," their second album. The
recording's beats (courtesy of French producer Niko Noki) are supple
and smooth, the melodies instantly hummable, and the rhymes direct
and emotional.</TE>
<TE>   Orishas' remarkable debut, 1999's "A Lo Cubano," was the first
record to successfully fuse the roots of Afro-Cuban music with
hip-hop idioms. The new one, recorded after the departure of conguero
Anga Diaz, lacks the instant appeal of its predecessor, but its depth
and sweetness transcend the more gimmicky aspects of "A Lo Cubano"
while remaining quintessentially Latin.</TE>
<TE>   Free to focus on the power of their rhymes, the three members rap
wistfully about their wives, their children and their bitter
experiences as Latin American immigrants in a cold European land.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to make an album that was more melodic than the first
one," explains member Roldan. "We felt that the hip-hop market was
saturated with aggressiveness, both lyrically and musically. There's
a lot of gold chains and plenty of bad boys calling their women
whores. That's definitely not our style."</TE>
<TE>   Even though "Emigrante" boasts the strong lyrical content and
easy-on-the-ears production values that usually make for a commercial
hit, its chances of achieving substantial sales in the U.S. are slim
at best.</TE>
<TE>   "From my point of view, the whole issue of rap en espanol and its
lack of acceptance in this country remains a mystery," says Universal
Latino's Rodrigo. "Radio station programmers have given me a thousand
reasons for refusing to play these records, but I have still to
really understand any of them. To me, it's just mystifying."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>What makes Cardinal Roger M. Mahony or Robert Graham feel that the
Virgin Mary needs to be brought into the 21st century ("In Our Own
Image," by Reed Johnson, Sept. 1)? A better image of that would be a
woman in a suit, a cell phone in one hand, a briefcase in the other
and a baby strapped across her chest.</LD>
<LD>   Mary shouldn't have to be brought into the 21st century. She is a
real person, not one created out of our imagination. She is a woman
of Jewish descent. Her looks should reflect that. Although she is not
mentioned overly much in the Bible, when she is, she is powerful.</LD>
<LD>   As a Catholic, I am disgusted by Cardinal Mahony. A church is
supposed to glorify God, not Mahony. This is one Catholic who will
never set foot in Mahony's folly.</LD>
<TE>   All that money could have been used in a much better way. Instead,
it was used to glorify an egotist.</TE>

<TE>   Mahony's approval of the image of Mother Mary in the sculpture at
the new cathedral is way out of line. He depicts a young girl dressed
in an outfit that makes her look like a space ranger.</TE>
<TE>   History tells us that our holy Mother Mary could never have looked
or dressed like that.</TE>
<TE>   I cannot imagine myself kneeling before this statue and reciting
the "Hail Mary." Thank God, they didn't blaspheme and place a blaster
in her hands.</TE>

distorting your image.</TE>

<LD>In response to Steve Hochman's "Maybe 'Rising' Refers to Grammy
Fever" (Pop Eye, Sept. 1), I'd like to suggest to him and his Grammy
voters and journalists that they take the time to listen to Neil
Finn's "One All."</LD>
<LD>   If there were an award for most overlooked and overdue artist,
Finn would be the runaway winner. And if Grammys were given out based
solely on artistic merit (call me an idealist), "One All," a pop
masterpiece, would be 2002's album of the year.</LD>

<HD>No Fan of Downtown</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Anastasia McAteer writes that "it's disappointing that after so much
good press, downtown is still perceived so incorrectly by the
majority of Los Angeles, and people continue to perpetuate the 'ghost
town at sundown' stereotype" (Letters, Sept. 1).</LD>
<LD>   Spare me the political correctness. I worked in downtown Los
Angeles for well over two years (at the bottom of Bunker Hill, 5th
and Grand), and found it to be appalling, depressing and disgusting.</LD>
<LD>   If downtown is so convenient, as McAteer asserts, how come there
is no food to be had on downtown's streets between 3 and 7 p.m.?</LD>
<TE>   At around 7:30 or 8 p.m., restaurants are open, yes. But that is
all. After the sun goes down, don't even think about buying a new
pair of pantyhose, renting a video, buying a record, a book or even a
greeting card.</TE>
<TE>   "An easy commute"? It's at least 30 minutes, and often longer, in
bumper-to-bumper traffic. And God forbid one's car should break down,
because the neighborhoods between the Westside and downtown do not
engender feelings of security.</TE>
<TE>   Go ahead, make your PC remarks. It doesn't change the facts: We
Westsiders do not feel comfortable in what we consider to be the
Eastside. Period. If you think I am inappropriately fearful, go ask
the LAPD what the crime statistics are downtown and in its environs,
versus those on the Westside.</TE>
<TE>   Of course there are a lot of free weekly concerts! The bureaucrats
have to do something to mollify the poor and keep them from rising up
in violence and anger at the vast economic disparity in this "city."</TE>
<TE>   It also gives the politicos a chance to take a bow at all the
"culture" they're bringing to downtown (while they steal the
electorate blind and completely turn their backs on the vast homeless
problem).</TE>
<TE>   Cheap and easy public transit? The MTA informed me that the
fastest I could get from the Westside to downtown in the afternoon
was 2 1/2 hours.</TE>
<TE>   I agree with McAteer that downtown is a vibrant community: of
panhandling psychotic crackheads and hopeless poverty and filth. And
no one in City Hall, apparently, gives a damn. It's been the same
since the '50s, when I grew up here. Downtown will always be my and
many other people's idea of hell on Earth.</TE>

<HD>Folklorico Isn't Danced Here</HD>
<DH>In their L.A. debuts, Contempodanza and Contradanza forgo
Mexican traditions</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Mexican dance in U.S. minds can evoke visions of sombreros, serapes,
flower baskets and mariachi music--the stuff of folklorico. But the
Grand Performances series has begun working against the stereotype.
In 2001, the free summer series headquartered in downtown L.A. packed
in viewers with Taller de Coreografico, a modern ballet company based
at Mexico's National Autonomous University and known for fusing
classical dance and Mexico's indigenous heritage.</LD>
<LD>   As it turns out, Taller de Coreografico was just the beginning of
Mexican contemporary dance for Grand Performances. Last year,
Taller's artistic director, Gloria Contreras, helped the series'
programmers set up a tour of Mexico City studios and performance
venues, and the fruits of that tour go on view this weekend at the
outdoor Watercourt venue: Two companies, Contempodanza and
Contradanza, will make L.A. debuts, bringing with them a U.S.
premiere apiece.</LD>
<LD>   "We want our Los Angeles audiences to become aware of the
sophisticated contemporary art scene that rivals the finest in the
world when it comes to producing modern dance," said Michael
Alexander, director of Grand Performances. "It was important for us
to start showing the depth of activity in Mexico."</LD>
<TE>   Leigh Ann Hahn, director of series' programming, said that she and
Alexander saw 40 performances of nine companies in Mexico City. "I
had heard such great things about the strength of contemporary dance
companies and I was amazed at the work and how it is completely
international," she said. "These two companies are creating dance
that is thoroughly and unapologetically modern. We saw the tip of the
iceberg, from what I understand. There is a lot more modern dance in
the rest of Mexico as well."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Hahn and Alexander plan on bringing another company to
L.A. next year: Ballet Nacional de Mexico, a contemporary dance
company based outside of Mexico City and founded in 1948.</TE>
<TE>   For now though, the focus is on Contempodanza and Contradanza,
troupes that have forged their own versions of Mexican modernism. The
companies' artistic directors, both ex-dancers, emphasize the
importance of personal vision in their work. Contradanza got its
start in 1983 under the direction of Cecilia Appleton; in 1986,
Cecilia Lugo founded Contempodanza. Contradanza's Appleton, 43,
studied with Martha Graham in New York in 1980, and danced in Mexico
City troupes before starting her own ensemble. She has choreographed
more than 60 works and she brings to L.A. five of her company's eight
dancers, all in their 20s. They'll perform "Camas Con Historias"
(Beds With Stories), a 45-minute work set to the music of Meredith
Monk.</TE>
<TE>   Choreographed in 1991, the piece has been performed at major
theaters in Mexico City and in Barcelona, Spain. With a foam mattress
serving as a mobile prop (it is, at various times, vertical, lying
flat or elevated on a metal bed frame), "Camas" is a collection of
solos, duets and ensemble movements meant to evoke and link intimate
moments and memories acquired over time.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to make a work about the inner life and also use images
the dancers gave me," Appleton explained through an interpreter. "I
want the public to have the view of one person, one character of the
choreography, and then have a different view with the duets, say. For
me, the most important thing is the theme: how different each
individual is, but that every person has qualities and emotions that
are universal."</TE>
<TE>   Writing about "Camas" for the weekly Mexico City magazine
Processo, one reviewer cited the work as "intense, convincing,
poetic, with a sustained yet delicate lyricism."</TE>
<TE>   Appleton sees her company as part of a dance scene that is turning
inward. It's a good time, she said, to be creating dances. "Before,
Mexican choreographers wanted to expose more external themes, but now
I think it is more important to say what they think about specific
things--what's going on within them--and project that more than going
the usual traditional route."</TE>
<TE>   Lugo, too, has created dozens of works for Contempodanza and in
her first visit to L.A. is presenting "Espejo de Linces" (Lynx's
Mirror), a work made in 2000 and based on a book-length poem about
the 1994 Zapatista rebellion of poor Indians in the southern Mexican
state of Chiapas that resulted in the deaths of 145 people.</TE>
<TE>   Although "Linces" has a political context, Lugo says it is more
about individuals than politics and historical events. The poem, by
poet and director of a Chiapas cultural institution Oscar Oliva, is
set to a commissioned score by Joaquin Lopez Chapman, a composer who
frequently works with modern dance companies.</TE>
<TE>   Contempodanza's movement style, seen on tape, is athletic but
fluid, replete with leaps, turns and intense partnering. In "Linces,"
the company's five members, ages 24 to 40, make use of a large,
billowing piece of fabric as they stalk the stage.</TE>
<TE>   "Oliva wanted to meet me to create a work together," Lugo, 46,
said. "I was interested in the poem. And in this work, Oscar said he
made a metaphor for reality, and that I made a metaphor of the
metaphor. It creates a whole feeling, an ambience."</TE>
<TE>   Lugo's company danced at New York's Cooper-Hewitt Museum in 1999,
and last year appeared in Portland, Ore., where one critic described
its style as the dance equivalent of Latin America's literary
tradition of magical realism.</TE>
<TE>   Both companies are making minor changes in their works as they
export them to L.A. The works originally contained some nudity, but
there will be no bare bodies outside at the Watercourt this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   As for what the choreographers want Los Angeles audiences to take
away with them, Appleton says she considers the performance an "open
door" between her company and the dance community of California.</TE>
<TE>   Lugo is hoping to make a more direct connection with Mexican
Americans. "It's my first visit to the city, and I want to be in
contact with the Mexican people who live in L.A. and speak with them
through the dance language. I want the choreography to touch the
heart of the people."</TE>

<HD>Catch Her if You Can</HD>
<DH>With four new films, actress Ellen Pompeo seemed to come
out of nowhere. But it did take a few lucky breaks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN MAYNARD</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three times a week, Ellen Pompeo has breakfast under the low lights
of the Polo Lounge at the Beverly Hills Hotel and spies on the rich
and famous. "Last week I was here and I had such a 'Blue Velvet'
moment," she whispers over a plate of pancakes and bacon. "I walked
in and I saw Dennis Hopper. And then five minutes after he left,
Laura Dern walked in. I was like, 'Oh my God, where's Isabella
[Rossellini]?' I just love coming here because you never know who
you're gonna see."</LD>
<LD>   But the green-eyed Massachusetts native had better become
accustomed to being on the receiving end of celebrity-watching. Next
month, she makes her studio movie debut in "Moonlight Mile," a
romantic drama in which she co-stars with young man of the moment
Jake Gyllenhaal and Oscar winners Dustin Hoffman, Susan Sarandon and
Holly Hunter.</LD>
<LD>   She's also got three other high-profile movies in the can. Due out
at Christmas is Steven Spielberg's "Catch Me if You Can" with Tom
Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio, then February will see the release of
the Marvel comic-book adaptation of "Daredevil" opposite Ben Affleck.
Additionally, she's Luke Wilson's love interest in the "Animal
House"-style comedy "Old School," which DreamWorks says will be
released in the first quarter next year. All of which should squash
her chances of remaining a fly on the wall at any Hollywood hangout.</LD>
<TE>   Pompeo's seeming arrival out of nowhere is enough to make any
aspiring starlet look for a new agent. While bartending at the Soho
Kitchen in New York City in 1995, she was approached by a casting
director. The next day, Pompeo called the woman and was promptly sent
out on three commercial auditions; she got all of them. The first, a
L'Oreal hair spot, "was actually really cute. They dyed my hair red,"
she says. "And then I booked like 20 more commercials after that
because I had this great red hair."</TE>
<TE>   It was enough for Pompeo to live comfortably in a West Village
apartment. Then she started to get work on New York-shot episodic
television series over a four-year period including "The Job,"
"Strangers With Candy" and two different stints on "Law &amp; Order."</TE>
<TE>   "In the first one I did, I hired my boyfriend to kill my parents,"
she recalls. "The second one I was a lesbian sadomasochist who killed
my sister. There must be a shortage of murderesses in New York City.
Isn't that hysterical? My poor father."</TE>
<TE>   Inevitably Pompeo realized that if she wanted her career to go any
further, she had to head West. "I'm the quintessential East Coast
girl," she says. "So I put it off as long as I possibly could. But
then eventually you run out of TV shows to do in New York."</TE>
<TE>   Intent on getting a head start on the TV pilot season, Pompeo
moved to the Hollywood Hills in December 2001. Three months later,
she experienced one of those only-in-L.A. stories that can seem too
perfect to believe. A guy tried to pick her up in the parking lot
behind gourmet sandwich shop Joan's on Third. She says she had no
idea he was actor Jake Gyllenhaal.</TE>
<TE>   "She walked by and I was just blown away by this energy,"
Gyllenhaal says. "She does this thing with her hair where she kind of
jolts it back and forth. I thought it was so sexy."</TE>
<TE>   "He knocked on my [car] window in the parking lot," Pompeo says.
"And he was standing there very nervous and shy. He said, 'I just
want to tell you that you're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen
in my entire life.' And he tried to run away. So I said, 'Wait a
minute, come back here.' Normally, I would say, 'Thank you' and let
it go. But there's something so interesting about his face, so
soulful."</TE>
<TE>   "I looked down at her passenger seat," Gyllenhaal says, "and I saw
that there were 'sides' on it," the parts of scripts actors are given
to read for auditions, "and I was like, 'Oh God, this girl's an
actor." Pompeo says she told him, "Maybe we'll work together someday.
Thanks for the compliment. See ya. And that was it."</TE>
<TE>   But it wasn't. Three weeks later, under the urging of New York
casting director Avy Kaufman, known for finding actors their
breakthrough roles--like Haley Joel Osment in "The Sixth Sense" and
Tobey Maguire in "The Ice Storm"--Pompeo auditioned for
writer-director Brad Silberling's "Moonlight Mile" (at the time
tentatively titled "Baby's in Black") and found herself reading with
none other than Gyllenhaal. "I walked into the room and he turned
pale. Then I turned pale. It was so bizarre," Pompeo says.</TE>
<TE>   "In walks Ellen to the room and I was like, no way," Gyllenhaal
says. "I guess she had burned her forehead with a curling iron. It
was just like this big scabby thing on her forehead and she was
trying to hide it the best she could. But finally she was like, 'I
know it's really stupid but I was trying to straighten my hair.' And
she blew the audition out of the water. She walked out of the room
and Brad turned to me and said, 'There's our movie.' "</TE>
<TE>   Set in the early '70s, "Moonlight Mile" is about Joe Nast, a young
man (Gyllenhaal) whose fiance is killed just weeks before their
wedding, sending him into emotional paralysis, holed up at the home
of his would-be in-laws (Hoffman and Sarandon).</TE>
<TE>   Adrift in grief and confusion, Joe unexpectedly crosses paths with
Pompeo's character, Bertie Knox, a local postmistress, who's dealing
with ghosts of her own. Silberling, who explored issues of life and
death in his previous films "Casper" and "City of Angels," based his
script on the aftermath of the 1989 murder of his girlfriend, actress
Rebecca Schaeffer (TV's "My Sister Sam").</TE>
<TE>   Pompeo's first movie break turned out to be a homecoming. Not only
was "Moonlight Mile" filmed in the Massachusetts coastal towns of
Marblehead and Gloucester, just 10 minutes from her hometown of
Everett, but the film deals with family mourning and moving on, a
theme she could relate to. When Pompeo was 4, her mother, who had
been in and out of hospitals for back surgeries, died of an
accidental overdose of painkillers, leaving her father, a tobacco
company sales rep, with six kids to raise. During the filming of
"Moonlight Mile," her father wasn't able to visit the set because he
was in the process of undergoing a stem cell transplant for lymphoma.
"He did chemotherapy," Pompeo says. "But you get to a certain point
and there's no more chemo they can give you. He's very lucky. He's
alive and he doesn't have cancer anymore."</TE>
<TE>   When asked if the script struck any nerves, Pompeo said only that
"I've had a quarter of a lifetime to figure out how to deal with
that."</TE>
<TE>   But Gyllenhaal says he tapped into his co-star's traumatic past to
find an emotional anchor. "I think the closest person who really got
the script, next to Brad, was Ellen. So I think she really related,"
Gyllenhaal said, and in performing, "I could come to her."</TE>
<TE>   "In a lot of ways, she has the hardest job in the movie," he adds.
"She had such a short time and not a lot of scenes to get a point
across, but she's the catalyst that breaks them all down."</TE>
<TE>   "Moonlight Mile" gave Pompeo the cachet to go out for other A-list
movies, including a little something called "Catch Me if You Can,"
for which she did an audition on tape. After seeing the tape, Steven
Spielberg wanted to meet her. "And I said, 'Well let me get back to
you and see how much time I have. I'm really busy right now,' " she
jokes. "So I met Steven and he offered me the part. And I graciously
accepted. And screamed all the way home."</TE>
<TE>   In the film, she plays a naive flight attendant who has sex with
con artist Leonardo DiCaprio. "She doesn't know that he's a virgin
and that he's really only a 17-year-old posing as this adult airline
pilot. We have sex in his hotel room and it's the best date I've ever
been on. You know, I have no idea." The significance of working with
DiCaprio and Spielberg wasn't lost on her. "If you do anything wrong,
then you have no talent," she says. "Because you can't fail with
those two on either side of you. It's impossible."</TE>
<TE>   That film got her the female lead in another DreamWorks project,
"Old School," directed by Todd Phillips ("Road Trip") and starring
Wilson, Vince Vaughan and Will Ferrell as former frat boys looking to
relive their raunchy days of glory. "It's a big ridiculous comedy,"
she says. "And Will Ferrell. It was like, can I not be in this scene
because I can't watch him do that without laughing."</TE>
<TE>   She found her work on "Daredevil" much less daunting. In Mark
Steven Johnson's adaptation of the Marvel comic series, Pompeo plays
Ellen Page, the devoted secretary to Ben Affleck's blind man who's a
lawyer by day, caped crusader by night. "I do all my scenes with Ben
and he's just a Boston boy," she says. "In the comic books, she
becomes a drug addict and a prostitute and gets AIDS. But I guess all
that crazy stuff will happen in the sequels if there are sequels. I
just worked two days in the office and got to wear great
Varga-inspired costumes, I had that whole 'His Girl Friday' look
going on."</TE>
<TE>   Even before her movies come out, Pompeo is getting looks from the
frittata-eating deal makers at the Polo Lounge, but it's usually
because they think she's somebody else: Renee Zellwegger. "I can tell
certain places I go, people look at me as if they know me," she says.
"I'm not worried because fundamentally we're very different. I grew
up on the East Coast and she's a Texan and whatever's meant to be
will be.</TE>
<TE>   "It's funny because I've met some people that are very close to
her who say it to me. But I don't photograph like her, I don't
think--do you think so?--I did meet her once at a party at [CAA
agent] Bryan Lourd's house. It was just a quick 'Hi.' "</TE>
<TE>   When asked about the comparison, Gyllenhaal says, "With Ellen,
besides that voice and the sense that people might think in a cliched
way--God, I don't know. If you put Renee and her in the same room, I
don't know who would come out standing."</TE>
<TE>   Although Pompeo has been remarkably chatty during the interview,
the actress clearly has been coached by her publicists, declining to
reveal her relationship status--"I have no idea. If someone else has
a clue, they can tell me." Or her age--"Can't you just say late 20s?"</TE>
<TE>   Is Ellen Pompeo ready for the attention? "I better be," she says,
laughing. "It's a little too late now."</TE>

<DH>It is possible for a first-timer to get a script made. Four
screenwriters relate their happy endings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER McQUAID</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This is not the story about the struggling screenwriter who goes out
in a blaze of ignominious glory, taking callous studio execs and
D-girls with him. It's not the cliffhanger about how the brilliant
script gathered dust on some studio exec's shelf for 10 years before
going on to win the Oscar for best picture.</LD>
<LD>   It is partially the story of the script that was sold to one
company and was about to be made when a similar movie came out, and
then the company went out of business. Or decided it didn't want to
make pictures like that anymore. So, screenwriter gets his script
back and takes it somewhere they love it, they really do, but then
there's a higher profile movie, which is sort of but not really the
same, but appeals to the same audience, so it's best to wait. Sigh.</LD>
<LD>   It's a wonder anything gets made in this town ... but you knew
that.</LD>
<TE>   At any rate, somewhere in Los Angeles reside four happy
screenwriters (for the moment) who will see their efforts bear fruit
on the big screen for the very first time. Unsurprisingly, none of
them seems terribly cynical about the sometimes-tortured progress
from page to soundstage (they all got their movies made, after all),
but there are lessons in each tale.</TE>
<TE>   Lesson No. 1</TE>
<TE>   You really don't have to have attended Brown (but a little time at
NYU wouldn't kill you).</TE>
<TE>   C. Jay Cox, who wrote the script for "Sweet Home Alabama," grew up
in northeastern Nevada, on a ranch he describes as "six miles outside
of a town of 600, in a county the size of Massachusetts with 2,500
people, where you had to adjust cake mix recipes to account for
environmental conditions." After graduating from Brigham Young
University, he fled to L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Gerbosi, who wrote "Auto Focus," grew up in Laguna Beach
and attended Vassar, where he didn't major in film.</TE>
<TE>   The project germinated when he bought the rights to "The Murder of
Bob Crane" by Robert Graysmith and pitched biopic kings Scott
Alexander and Larry Karaszewski ("The People vs. Larry Flynt") with
his idea to turn the story of the all-American TV star's descent into
sex addiction into a film. They liked it, they really liked it. And
so did Paul Schrader, who directed with a bare-bones budget estimated
at $8 million.</TE>
<TE>   Burr Steers, who wrote and directed "Igby Goes Down" (made for
between $8 million and $10 million) grew up in and around Washington,
where he attended St. Alban's, the prep school of choice for haute
D.C. He attended NYU in the '80s, but readily admits his attendance
at such nightclubs as the Mudd Club was far more consistent. After
finishing there, Steers got some work as an actor, most notably in
"The Last Days of Disco" and "Reservoir Dogs," as well as some horror
movies he doesn't seem to want to mention.</TE>
<TE>   Lamar Damon, who co-wrote "Slap Her, She's French" with Robert Lee
King, grew up in Austin, Texas, where his parents were professors at
the University of Texas. He attended USC for undergrad and NYU for
grad school, where he earned the ire of his fellow students by
selling his first script to Disney before getting his master's.</TE>
<TE>   Lesson No. 2</TE>
<TE>   There is still hope for you, even if you have the</TE>
<TE>   worst job on Earth.</TE>
<TE>   Until five years ago, Cox worked for the L.A. County Commission on
Children and Families, in an office in the sub-basement of the Hall
of Administration. "We were in charge of overseeing all the really
awful stuff that happened in the Department of Children's Services.</TE>
<TE>   Gerbosi did deliveries, plus "a variety of low-paying menial
Hollywood positions," including script reader, receptionist and
writer's assistant. He also worked on an extremely cheesy TV series
he refuses to name. "They were so loathsome, I'd really rather not
give them the publicity."</TE>
<TE>   Steers got the inspiration for "Igby" while working similarly
menial tasks. "I was just treading water as an actor and I was
delivering real estate catalogs in Orange County and these ideas were
coming up.</TE>
<TE>   "I wrote the script because I needed to," he explains.</TE>
<TE>   Damon worked as a writer on so-called reality TV shows, notably
"Road Rules" for MTV. But take heart--even though he's been a working
scriptwriter since college, "Slap Her," with roughly a $14-million
budget, is his first movie script to see production.</TE>
<TE>   Lesson No. 3</TE>
<TE>   Even though you're not an actor, lie about your age.</TE>
<TE>   Interestingly, the notion that in Hollywood, men age gracefully
while women wither on the bone seems not to apply to screenwriters.
Not a single subject in this story was willing to cop to his age.
Shall we say "all graciously ensconced somewhere in the neighborhood
of 39?"</TE>
<TE>   Lesson No. 4</TE>
<TE>   Know who you're pitching.</TE>
<TE>   As Steers puts it, "After my first couple of pitches, I had to
learn that you can't bring up 'The 400 Blows' and have anyone in
Hollywood know what you're talking about. 'Rushmore' wasn't
commercially successful enough to attract money, so then, I thought
'The Graduate.' Find the one sentence that you can give them that
they can pitch it with."</TE>
<TE>   Gerbosi puts his approach to Alexander and Karaszewski thusly: "I
had no track record at all, but my idea had sex, celebrity and
murder. What's not to like about it?"</TE>
<TE>   Lesson No. 5</TE>
<TE>   Learn how to connect the dots.</TE>
<TE>   "We got Greg Kinnear because Scott Alexander read somewhere that
he was interested in doing darker roles and called up his agent,"
Gerbosi says. And so Kinnear signed on, along with Willem Dafoe, Rita
Wilson and Maria Bello.</TE>
<TE>   "Being an actor right now is like being a musician and being stuck
on 'The Love Boat' playing Barry Manilow covers," Steers says,
laughing. "People are starved for good material."</TE>
<TE>   Steers, with his story of upper-crust dysfunction, hypocrisy and
alienation, was happy to serve it up, and Susan Sarandon, Jeff
Goldblum, Amanda Peet, Claire Danes, Ryan Phillippe and Kieran Culkin
(in the title role) were happy to help themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "Slap Her" offered some up-and-comers such as Piper Perabo and
Jane McGregor a chance to chew some scenery and showcase their
comedic chops.</TE>
<TE>   Cox's feel for the interaction between Americans who stay close to
their roots and those who fly as far from them as possible (plus a
$35-million Disney budget) got Reese Witherspoon, Mary Kay Place,
Fred Ward, Jean Smart and Candice Bergen on board.</TE>
<TE>   Lesson No. 6</TE>
<TE>   Do your research.</TE>
<TE>   Gerbosi had a book to help him, but he also tracked down people
who weren't in the book but were involved with Crane. "At one point,
I had a detective from the Scottsdale [Ariz.] Police Department who
was ready to turn over the entire 2,000-page file on Bob Crane to
me," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Because much of Crane's sexual escapades involved secretly
recording his partners on one of the first home-video setups, Gerbosi
also made a point of researching the equipment of the time. "The
movie actually documents the switch from reel-to-reel to cassette in
video. I did a lot of that kind of research to get it right."</TE>
<TE>   For research on the state of amateur porn today, Gerbosi says,
"all that information is a click or two away on the Web," including a
Web site maintained by one of Bob Crane's sons where subscribers can
view some of the images Crane recorded of his escapades.</TE>
<TE>   Cox spent six weeks in Alabama, eavesdropping and meeting people
who lived there--and it kept "Sweet Home" from turning into a camp
fest of condescension. "I spent some time in Tuscaloosa, which is
where the producer's parents lived and where she grew up. Her father
had a plane not unlike the one in the movie and he flew me all over
the place. I met a lot of very cultivated, knowledgeable, educated
people as well, which is not what Hollywood usually associates with
the South."</TE>
<TE>   He then spent two weeks in New York during fashion week, hanging
out with designers Todd Oldham and Cynthia Rowley, to make sure he
got the fashion stuff right. "And I sure know about coming from a
white trash background and trying to reinvent yourself."</TE>
<TE>   Steers lived Igby. Or to be more precise, he grew up in Igby's
milieu. He is a nephew of Gore Vidal, the high-born writer who
continually delights in exposing the hypocrisies of his relatives and
contemporaries in the upper crust and the hallways of power in
Washington. "Living on the East Coast, I knew all of those people in
one form or another," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Although Damon is of the Texas that elected Ann Richards governor,
not the one that elected George Bush, he knows the Texas where "Slap
Her" is set; he is descended on his father's side from the original
white families that settled Texas five generations ago.</TE>
<TE>   He also credits his work for MTV with teaching him what flies and
what doesn't with a young audience. "They're very particular, and if
something doesn't ring true, you're sunk," he says. "The people I
worked with on 'Road Rules' actually referred to movie trailers not
as 'previews' but as 'warnings.' "</TE>
<TE>   Lesson No. 7</TE>
<TE>   Know the rules of attraction.</TE>
<TE>   Cox had sold scripts; it was Alabama native Stokely Chaffin, a
producer who approached him with the idea for "Sweet Home"; the story
was by Douglas J. Eboch. Gerbosi took the time to think about who he
was approaching with "Auto Focus." Damon knew studios were always
looking for material appealing to young audiences.</TE>
<TE>   Steers had the most work to do. "I was a first-time director," he
says. "You couldn't sell 'Igby' on me.</TE>
<TE>   "I finished 'Igby' in '97 and then I had to figure out how to get
it to people and I didn't know how, and it was all about figuring out
how to get it to the right receptionist. And the real problem is that
most agencies are there to make sure no unfinanced script gets to
their talent, ever. They only want huge, packaged paydays. But
eventually you find a champion, who knows their clients want stuff
they can really show their chops in."</TE>
<TE>   Lesson 8</TE>
<TE>   You need an angel.</TE>
<TE>   In Steers' case, the angel appeared in the form of Ryan Phillippe,
who would go on to play Igby's despicable older brother. "The first
conversation I had with Ryan was him saying, 'You can tell the
finance people I'm attached to your movie.' He wasn't even the star,
and what he did took guts, because once you're signed on as an actor,
if the movie can't get financing then, it's a dimunition of their
power. Each actor was such an important component in financing."</TE>
<TE>   Cox had producer Chaffin, who shepherded "Sweet Home" for 10 years
before finally seeing it get made. Damon had Jonathan King, who kept
his project alive from his days as an assistant at Miramax to his
current role as a producer.</TE>
<TE>   And though Gerbosi's experience was as direct as it gets in
Hollywood, it did take a detour. "I had a meeting with Alexander and
Karaszewski in March of '99 and they told me they'd be willing to
read a script of mine," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "Six months go by and I finish my draft and I call them up and I
tell them I've got a draft and will they read it? And they say,
'Absolutely, we're over at this mixing studio and why don't you come
by and drop it off,' " so he did, but he left the script with the
manager of the facility, who "said he'd take care of it."</TE>
<TE>   "So two weeks pass, no call, three weeks pass, no call, four weeks
pass, no call, and I'm thinking they hate it," he continues. "So I
call and I say, 'You hate it.' And they say' 'Hate it? We never saw
it, what happened to you?'</TE>
<TE>   "So I drive back down to the mixing stage and there it is, sitting
in a corner of the studio. So I picked it up off the floor and
dropped it by their office and they called the very next day and they
liked it. I must have lost 10 pounds in that four weeks."</TE>
<TE>   All of them have emerged from their first experience with a
healthy appreciation for the absurd twists and turns getting a movie
made can take.</TE>
<TE>   Damon was treated to a lecture from someone who accused him of
selecting a title that humorized violence against women. And then a
French person accused him of selecting a title that encouraged
violence against French people.</TE>
<TE>   The producers of "Sweet Home" had wanted Reese Witherspoon for the
lead from the beginning, Cox says. "We kept saying, 'What a shame
she's not a movie star.' Then 'Legally Blonde' opened, and she had a
bunch of scripts on her agent's desk and this is the one she chose."</TE>
<TE>   "You learn that the people in this business have a certain way of
constructing a house," says Steers, whose screenplay is so dark it's
a wonder it ever got made, much less with the cast and budget it got.
"It's the same house they've been constructing since 1910, but that's
the way it is."</TE>

<LD>It's Southern California's Ellis Island. It's also one of Los
Angeles' oldest and most persistently diverse communities. People of
all nationalities and ethnicities don't just pass through Boyle
Heights, they put down roots, go to school, make friends and
establish businesses that pass from one generation to another. Those
who move on, as many do, take images, keepsakes and memories of the
historic neighborhood with them.</LD>
<LD>   A 1928 black-and-white photograph of a dreamy summer day at
Hollenbeck Park has survived, making Boyle Heights of yore look like
a Seurat painting. More mundane views appear in vintage snapshots of
multiethnic basketball teams and girls clubs, Russian immigrants, the
original Canter's delicatessen (now on Fairfax Avenue) and Zelman's
men's clothing store, a longtime family business that closed in 1999.</LD>
<TE>   Memories of Boyle Heights' darker side also linger. Frank Romero,
a Latino artist who grew up in Boyle Heights, has saved dishes given
to his mother by a Japanese American neighbor who dispersed her
possessions before being sent to an internment camp during World War
II. Mollie Wilson Murphy, an African American resident of Boyle
Heights, was 18 in the spring of 1942 when her Japanese American
girlfriends were forced out of the neighborhood. But she kept up a
lively correspondence with them throughout their incarceration and
resettlement--and held onto the letters.</TE>
<TE>   Long squirreled away in closets, file cabinets, suitcases and
libraries, these images, artifacts and documents--along with many
others--are going on view in "Boyle Heights: The Power of Place," an
exhibition that opens today at the Japanese American National Museum
in Little Tokyo. The show is billed as a "multiethnic collaborative
approach to documenting a Los Angeles neighborhood," and encompasses
everything from handwritten letters and taped oral histories to a
splashy, 22-foot-by-14-foot mural of Boyle Heights history, recently
painted by Los Angeles artist Nuke.</TE>
<TE>   A scrapbook of newspaper clippings from June 1943 recounts the
zoot suit riots, a wartime uprising that pitted rebellious Mexican
American young men in baggy suits against other Angelenos, who
considered them unpatriotic. Another group of photographs documents
the punk scene of the 1970s and '80s. A group of handmade guitars
from the Candelas Store, displayed in a glass case, represents the
wares of a longtime Boyle Heights business.</TE>
<TE>   All these items contribute to a multimedia collage of a complex
community. Rather than tracking its history chronologically, the show
takes a geographic approach. A parade of photographs recently shot
along Avenida Cesar E. Chavez (formerly Brooklyn Avenue) runs through
the show, forming its conceptual spine. Along the way are
"intersections" that focus on themes such as religion, business,
community institutions and wartime unrest. In one corner, adjacent
walls are densely hung with plastic envelopes of photographs and
other documents--making the point that many more stories could be
told.</TE>
<TE>   The community undergoing all this creative investigation has a
current population of 85,000 and covers 6.7 square miles, bounded by
the Los Angeles River on the west, Indiana Street on the east,
Marengo Street and the I-10 freeway on the north and 25th Street on
the south.</TE>
<TE>   Named for Andrew Boyle, who purchased land there in 1858, planted
vineyards and built a house on what became Boyle Avenue, it was
developed as an affluent suburb but evolved into a working-class
neighborhood. Boyle's son-in-law, William H. Workman, subdivided the
area for residential development in 1875 and dubbed it Boyle Heights.</TE>
<TE>   By the 1930s, a thriving Jewish community was part of an ethnic
mix of Japanese, Mexican, Italian, Russian, Armenian and African
descent. Since 1940, the Latino population has increased from 12% to
87% while the white population has decreased from 80% to 5%, but
Boyle Heights is still home to a wide variety of people.</TE>
<TE>   That persistent diversity is what made Boyle Heights an enticing
subject for the Japanese American National Museum, said Audrey T.
Lee-Sung, director of special projects. Although the museum may be
best known for telling the stories of Japanese Americans, it is
dedicated to illuminating a much broader picture of America's ethnic
and cultural diversity, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're interested in how the Japanese experience fits into the
larger sphere, not just in isolation," said museum associate curator
Sojin Kim, who organized the show with Emily Anderson, a curatorial
associate.</TE>
<TE>   Fulfilling its mission through exhibitions and other public
programs, the 10-year-old museum has spearheaded other collaborations
that cross cultural and geographic boundaries. It has joined forces
with regional groups in Oregon and Hawaii to explore aspects of
Japanese American history. Another project, "Finding Family Stories,"
focused on ties among ethnic groups in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   The Boyle Heights show is an ambitious addition to the lineup, but
it's merely the centerpiece of a larger collaboration, the Boyle
Heights Project, which has evolved during the past three years.</TE>
<TE>   One of the first steps was to form a community advisory committee,
Lee-Sung said. Then came a series of meetings with potential project
partners, which led to the development of a proposal in the fall of
1999. Gathering force as the collaboration grew and a trickle of
information and objects turned into a flood, the project ultimately
garnered major support from the Nathan Cummings Foundation of New
York and the National Endowment for the Humanities.</TE>
<TE>   Additional funders include the Bank of America Foundation in Los
Angeles, the Institute of Museum and Library Services in Washington,
D.C., and the Nissan Foundation in Gardena.</TE>
<TE>   "We aren't accustomed to having so many people say yes," said
Chris Komai, the museum's public information manager.</TE>
<TE>   Many people also said yes to appeals for objects and information,
to be used in the exhibition. The curators staged collection days at
the museum and at Roosevelt High School, one of the project partners,
which brought in hundreds of photographs, postcards, posters,
leaflets and other Boyle Heights memorabilia, Anderson said.</TE>
<TE>   Students at Roosevelt--which has produced such graduates as the
late U.S. Congressman Edward Roybal and Harold Williams, president
emeritus of the J. Paul Getty Trust--conducted interviews with Boyle
Heights residents past and present for the exhibition's oral history
component.</TE>
<TE>   The Jewish Historical Society of Southern California, a largely
volunteer organization founded in 1952, provided assistance with
research and lent artifacts and photographs to the show, as did the
International Institute of Los Angeles, a social service agency that
was established in 1914 as a branch of the YWCA to promote
multicultural understanding but now operates independently.</TE>
<TE>   Another partner is Self-Help Graphics, an Eastside community-based
visual arts center, which is presenting its own exhibition, "About,
By, From: Boyle Heights." Opening today and running through Oct. 13,
the show explores the history and diversity of the neighborhood
through the eyes of contemporary artists. While the other exhibition
documents the past, this one offers artworks as "reflections of the
present," said Tomas Benitez, executive director of Self-Help.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the project's partners will present their own events in a
mix of public programs, from a culinary festival to an outdoor
concert to a tour of Evergreen Cemetery, yet another place where
Boyle Heights' diversity is evident.</TE>
<TE>   Every native of Los Angeles whose family has been here for three
generations probably has a connection to Boyle Heights, Kim said. "We
wanted to document the community in a way that would show the
complexity of its social history."</TE>

<HD>From the World of Rap, a Tip of the Cap to Jerry Garcia</HD>

<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eminem may not have much respect for Moby. But one of his close
associates is paying sincere if unlikely homage to another
bespectacled rock star.</LD>
<LD>   Proof, a rapper in Eminem's posse, D12, has made a solo album,
"Searching for Jerry Garcia," that takes an earnest and sympathetic
look at the life and death of the late Grateful Dead leader.</LD>
<LD>   Due Nov. 26 from Proof's own Iron Fist Records label, the album
also features references to such other deceased icons as John Lennon,
Kurt Cobain, Janis Joplin, Billie Holiday and Marvin Gaye.</LD>
<TE>   "My quest in life is I'm searching for Jerry Garcia, and my
feeling is everyone is, because he died from a combination of drugs,
stress and diet, which are things everyone has to deal with," Proof
says. "Drugs can be something like too much TV, it doesn't have to be
real drugs.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody is going to take [the references] at face value, but
there's a bigger picture there."</TE>
<TE>   Of all the fallen rock heroes, the portly, bearded hippie guru
Garcia, who died of a heart attack while in a drug rehabilitation
facility in 1995 at age 53, seems an odd object of sympathy for a
young urban rapper. But Proof (who is also sometimes known by his
alternate identity, Dirty Harry) is a true fan.</TE>
<TE>   "I just became one in the last two years," he says. "I happened to
be chillin' at my manager's house, and he's a Deadhead and I was
sitting watching a documentary on Jerry Garcia and he reminded me of
myself. He went and did jazz albums, he did a range of music. I
thought, 'Great.'</TE>
<TE>   "Next thing I know I got sucked in all the way. He never did the
same kind of show, always played something different. His attitude
was, '[Never mind] selling records, let's go rock these people.'
That's my attitude. It's not a matter of selling a million records.
It's go where the people are at. They gonna follow you anyway."</TE>
<TE>   To carry the theme further, Proof commissioned album art by Philip
Garris, who painted the cover for the Dead's 1975 album, "Blues for
Allah," and other items for the band.</TE>
<TE>   Although Garcia is the central presence for the album (which
features appearances by the rest of D12 as well as Nelly Furtado),
each song is titled after a different figure, with subtitles keyed to
the lyrics. "John Lennon: 'One on One' " explores the dark side of
fan worship. "Kurt Cobain: 'Take It Back' " addresses the mountain of
regrets that could lead to suicide.</TE>
<TE>   "It's talking about all the things in my life that I wish I could
take back," Proof says. "Things I did with D12, friends I had and
lost, and in the end [wanted] to kill myself. Kurt is somebody I
could understand."</TE>
<TE>   The songs don't use samples of the title artists' music, nor are
they meant to be musical tributes, he stresses.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just my appreciation for them and what they've done in my
life," he says. "I don't want to get all crazy here, but I believe
every person has their own world, and they don't collide, but bridge.
I never got to meet Kurt Cobain, but this song is our bridge between
our worlds."</TE>
<TE>   GROUND CONTROL: Lance Bass may not get to take his
extraterrestrial trip, but Ziggy Stardust will be launched on a space
odyssey. Well, at least David Bowie's musical portrait of his
early-'70s alter ego will.</TE>
<TE>   Bowie's entire "The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust &amp; the Spiders
From Mars" album will be beamed into space in January in a
high-powered laser transmission. Bowie will then create an archive of
"Ziggy"-related documents that, along with a CD, will be sent on the
first full launch of a solar-sail spaceship, scheduled to take place
in 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Marking this year's 30th anniversary of the "Ziggy" album, the
space efforts are being coordinated by Houston-based Team Encounter,
a commercial space flight company that has developed the solar sail
technology, in conjunction with Mach18, an L.A. firm that, with
Bowie, has developed an interactive "Ziggy" 30th anniversary Web
site.</TE>
<TE>   Team Encounter is selling space to the public for archive
documents on the 2005 vessel, which uses a sail the size of a
football field. The ship will be propelled by solar waves into deep
space, passing Pluto after 17 years. Cameras aboard the ship will
beam back pictures of the voyage. About 80,000 people from around the
world have signed up so far, says Team Encounter President and Chief
Executive Charlie Chafer.</TE>
<TE>   Chafer, a longtime Bowie fan, says he didn't hesitate when Mach18
approached him about the project.</TE>
<TE>   "When they asked if Team Encounter would be interested in being
involved, I said that it wasn't really a choice," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Back on Earth, the Web site, which is launching as part of Bowie's
Internet venture www.DavidBowie.com, will offer fans interactive
elements looking at the creation of the Ziggy character, the music
and the groundbreaking concert tour, with rare photos and film
footage. It is slated to be one of the first major sites to use the
new Flash 6 technology.</TE>
<TE>   SMALL FACES: You knew someone was bound to do it, and San
Francisco neo-lounge singer Bud E. Love has: a lounge Ozzy Osbourne
tribute album. "Diary of a Lounge Man" will feature 15 songs ("Iron
Man," "Paranoid" and "Crazy Train" among them) and is due Oct. 1 from

<LD>   PETER CASE</LD>
<LD>   "Beeline"</LD>
<TE>   Vanguard</TE>
<TE>   ** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   JOHN DOE</TE>
<TE>   "Dim Stars, Bright Sky"</TE>
<TE>   ArtistDIRECT</TE>
<TE>   Peter Case and John Doe are well-established singer-songwriters
who were key members of seminal Los Angeles groups. Case fronted the
Plimsouls and Doe was co-leader of X. Both long ago flipped the Dylan
script by unplugging their guitars and quieting down after their
fast-'n'-furious youths, and on their new collections, they each
offer intimate, mature but not painfully sincere tunes about love,
loss, going away and coming home.</TE>
<TE>   Reflecting their different sensibilities and focuses, however,
these albums don't really intersect, except maybe at the vaguely
similar Indian flavorings and shared mood of anticipation in Case's
"Something's Coming" and Doe's "Magic." Case relaxes with a casual
set focused on emotional immediacy, while Doe weaves his feelings
into something more complex, if not entirely focused.</TE>
<TE>   "Dim Stars, Bright Sky" (due in stores Tuesday) is certainly a
departure. Co-produced by Doe, Joe Henry and Dave May, the album is
mostly pensive and solitary in mood, although not necessarily sad.
The piano and acoustic guitar waltz "7 Holes" is Elvis Costello
bitter/sweet, while such songs as "Always" are suffused with Henry's
trademark muted, shuffling rhythms and curving, steel notes.</TE>
<TE>   The cross-pollinated folk-blues-rock on "Beeline" (in stores Sept.
17) is more immediately inviting with the opening Dylanesque rambler,
"If You Got a Light to Shine." It's pleasant enough but feels a
little too off-the-cuff, like "Lost in the Sky" and "It's Cold
Inside." Still, the dusky "Evening Raga" and the jaunty "First Light"
serve as powerful musical and emotional counterpoints of melancholy
and hope.</TE>
<TE>   It's surprising that Doe's album sounds so reserved, as it
features many guest singers. But Jakob Dylan, Aimee Mann, Juliana
Hatfield, Rhett Miller and Jane Wiedlin mostly support Doe's hushed,
gravelly vocals rather than engage in the give-and-take of Doe and
Exene Cervenka on X tunes. His deadpan delivery subtly underscores
the wry obsession of "Forever for You" and the chiming admonishment
"Backroom," but such tracks as "Still You" and "Closet of Dreams" are
so elusive they leave no impression.</TE>
<TE>   Natalie Nichols</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   INTERPOL</TE>
<TE>   "Turn on the Bright Lights"</TE>
<TE>   Matador</TE>
<TE>   So this is how New York City must sound at 4 a.m.--guitars echoing
mournfully, rhythms elbowing their way through shadowy arrangements,
vocals rising like incantations tracing the sparest of melodies. If
nothing else, the debut album of this Big Apple quartet manages to
wed soundscape and landscape.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the edginess and urgency, Interpol fashions fascinating
vignettes--from the strummy lamentation on their environment "NYC,"
to the jangly, cryptic love letter "Stella Was a Diver and She Was
Always Down"--all sold convincingly by Paul Banks' apocalyptic
baritone.</TE>
<TE>   Not unlike the way Black Rebel Motorcycle Club built on the sound
of the Jesus and Mary Chain, Interpol (which plays Sept. 18 and 19 at
the Troubadour in West Hollywood) has refreshed some familiar
stylings with elements of Joy Division, the Cure and the Smiths
seeming to wave as they pass by. In fact, with guitars trembling and
Banks belting it out, Interpol recalls early '90s cult heroes
Kitchens of Distinction, another arty ensemble whose air of drama
lingered long after its records stopped playing.</TE>

<TE>   "Caraluna"</TE>
<TE>   Warner Music Latina</TE>
<TE>   ** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   VOLUMEN CERO</TE>
<TE>   "Luces"</TE>
<TE>   Warner Music Latina</TE>
<TE>   A preoccupation with the American dream and the accouterments of
rock stardom permeates these two albums by Miami groups formed by
Latin musicians. Both recordings boast slick production values geared
for mainstream consumption, bringing them closer to pop and further
from the raw, edgy sensibility that is rock en espanol's strongest
asset.</TE>
<TE>   Bacilos, a trio led by gifted Colombian singer-songwriter Jorge
Villamizar, has done a lot of growing up since releasing its major
label debut in 2000. In songs such as the wonderfully ironic "Nada
Especial," he seems to be following in the footsteps of
uncompromising artists such as Ruben Blades and Pablo Milanes. Those
ambitions, however, are thwarted by sunny, uncomplicated hooks that
scream "hit single" at every turn.</TE>
<TE>   Volumen Cero, enamored of nocturnal moods and anthemic riffs,
rocks a bit harder. "Luces" is a decent effort, although the
quartet's fixation with '80s new wave makes some of the material
sound painfully dated. Still, it's hard not to applaud the group's
unabashed love for good old-fashioned rock 'n' roll.  Ernesto Lechner</TE>
<TE>   In Brief</TE>
<TE>   ** 1/2 Wondermints, "Mind if We Make Love to You," Smile
Records/Image Entertainment. Its unctuous title notwithstanding, the
fourth album (due Tuesday) by the L.A. pop trio proudly carries the
torch lit by Brian Wilson, beside whom the Wondermints have played
for the past three years. Wondermints' material might lack a
commanding lead voice, but amid lush melodies, pristine harmonies and
meticulous orchestration, there isn't a single number that would
spoil a late-summer sunset. The colorful landscapes of "Make Love's"
straight-ahead balladry, come to life in the gently churning
psychedelia of "Sweetness." K.B.</TE>
<TE>   ** 1/2 Nightmares on Wax, "Mind Elevation," Warp. The fourth
release of original material from these atmosphere specialists (in
stores Tuesday) finds Englishman George Evelyn and various
collaborators revisiting the NoW formula of chill-out grooves laced
with an abundance of American hip-hop and R&amp;B. While the style is
familiar to NoW fans, the high proportion of vocal tracks and the
infectiously sunny disposition keep "Mind Elevation" feeling fresh
and refreshing.</TE>

<DH>'Barbershop' explores the key role a small neighborhood
business plays for black residents--in Chicago and elsewhere</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GIL ROBERTSON IV</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"In some communities, a barbershop is merely a place where you go to
get your haircut," explains actor and rapper Ice Cube. "However, in
the black community, barbershops are a place where black people get
to hang out and express themselves with no worries."</LD>
<LD>   He's talking about a sociological and cultural phenomenon--but
he's also talking about the new film "Barbershop," which celebrates
this urban institution. "Everybody goes to barbershops, but nobody
uses them like black folks," Cube notes.</LD>
<LD>   An ensemble comedy that tells the story of a day in the life at
Calvin's Barber Shop on the South Side of Chicago, "Barbershop" is a
gathering place for an eclectic array of characters. Owned by
third-generation barber Calvin Palmer (Ice Cube), the shop is home to
Eddie (Cedric the Entertainer), an old-time barber prone to
delivering a lot of laughs and sage advice; Jimmy (Sean Patrick
Thomas), a college student with a superiority complex; Ricky
(newcomer Michael Ealy), an ex-con trying to go straight; and Terri
(Eve), the shop's lone female barber, who is just trying to stick it
out with the boys.</LD>
<TE>   The story begins when Calvin, struggling to pay his bills and with
a baby on the way, decides that he wants to get rid of the shop that
he inherited from his father. As the day's events unfold, we watch
the barbers deal with their customers, argue among themselves, and
cope with the neighborhood drama that is as much a part of the shop
as the shears.</TE>
<TE>   "Calvin is at a crossroads in his life where he can't decide what
he wants to do next," Ice Cube says. "He's an ambitious guy who wants
to do well by his family but finds himself in a situation that gets
out of control. I could relate to him on a lot of levels because he's
frustrated and feels that his life is going nowhere. What Calvin
doesn't realize is that he's already sitting on something special,
and after selling the shop, he finally recognizes his father's vision
and begins to respect that legacy."</TE>
<TE>   MGM hopes the $12-million film, which opens nationwide Friday,
will have the appeal of "The Original Kings of Comedy," the concert
film (starring Cedric, among others) that took in more than $40
million at the box office and became a breakout hit in the African
American community.</TE>
<TE>   For "Barbershop" co-producers George Tillman Jr. and Bob Teitel,
the pair behind "Soul Food" (1997), which Tillman directed, and "Men
of Honor" (2000, also directed by Tillman), it's another film
exploring aspects of black life in America.</TE>
<TE>   Both Teitel and Tillman say they were drawn to the project because
they recognized the potential of assembling the rich and diverse
characters who live in the world of urban barbershops. (The script
was written by Mark Brown.)</TE>
<TE>   "We were also attracted to the film because of the sense of
community and commonality that it inspires," Tillman says.
"Barbershops are like little nerve centers in our communities, where
people come in for a haircut but always leave with a lot more. In
barbershops, people develop relationships that can last a
lifetime--they discuss their wives, business and in general have a
good time."</TE>
<TE>   Ice Cube and Cedric the Entertainer were attracted for many of the
same reasons. "A lot of things are said and done amongst black folks
in a barbershop that would never take place in the real world," says
Cedric, who will be starring in his own Fox TV series this fall.</TE>
<TE>   "In this film, we weren't afraid to talk about some big issues and
give a few viewpoints of controversy. Everybody has an opinion.
There's a pro and con, and a point of view right down the middle.
That's one of the things that we wanted to reflect with this film.
Not every black person has the same point of view on sex, religion or
race, and it's good to talk about that and have some fun with those
subjects."</TE>
<TE>   For Ice Cube, making "Barbershop" gave him the chance to reconnect
with an institution that played a big role in his early life.</TE>
<TE>   "Man, growing up I spent a lot of my free time hanging out in
barbershops getting my hair done and listening to what the older guys
had to say about life," he says. "People need a place where they can
express themselves and talk about their dreams and problems and what
makes the world tick. There's a mysticism surrounding barbershops
that helps you connect with yourself and community. The people who
work in barbershops become like family."</TE>
<TE>   To give the shop a realistic feel, Teitel and Tillman invested a
great deal of time in building the set in Chicago. They also brought
on Tim Story as director, who had a background in music videos and
understood the importance of aesthetics in telling a story.</TE>
<TE>   "Bob and George knew that in order for people to believe in this
story that it was very important that we capture physical realism
with the shop," Story says.</TE>
<TE>   "We paid attention to every possible aspect in designing our set,
filling it with African art, memorabilia and photos to bring the shop
to life and make it feel as much like a community living room as it
does a business. We also enrolled all of the actors in a barber
college in Los Angeles for training sessions to familiarize them with
the artistry of cutting hair."</TE>
<TE>   With talk of a sequel already in the works even before the film
hits the screen, Story says he's confident about how audiences will
react. "People are going to connect immediately with 'Barbershop'
because it has a lot of heart and offers a great deal of
entertainment on many levels."</TE>
<TE>   Actor Ealy, who makes his feature film debut in "Barbershop,"
found "there's an energy that you get from barbershops that's warm
and inviting. Tim did a good job telling a story that touches on both
the good and bad, but emphasizes the beauty of the inner city."</TE>
<TE>   For Cedric, the film captures "the moral overtone that exists in
barbershops by illustrating the multilayered relationships that take
place in the shop between the barbers and their customers and amongst
the barbers themselves."</TE>

<HD>Brother, What a Switch</HD>
<DH>Forget Tim Blake Nelson, lovable hillbilly. His new film
tackles humankind's darkest hour.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNN SMITH</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Before shooting "The Grey Zone," the film version of his own dark
Holocaust play, director Tim Blake Nelson handed out a required
reading list to actors David Arquette, Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi
and Mira Sorvino, among others.</LD>
<LD>   First, there was Primo Levi's essay of the same name about the
Sonderkommando--Auschwitz-Birkenau prisoners forced to choose between
helping the Nazis or death. There were diaries unearthed at Birkenau,
packets of testimony from concentration camp survivors, and a
25-page, single-spaced memo from Nelson detailing the authentic,
unsentimental tone he hoped to achieve with his story about an
ill-fated 1944 uprising of the Sonderkommando.</LD>
<LD>   This, then, is the other Tim Blake Nelson. Not the hilarious,
gap-toothed actor-singer known for his convincing portrayals of
Delmar, the dim-bulb hillbilly in "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" and
Bubba, the frustratingly likable pot-smoking schemer in "The Good
Girl," but the serious, erudite and self-aware Nelson, the
precariously eclectic writer-director of "Eye of God," a Sundance
favorite about faith and love; "O," the preppy adaptation of Othello;
and now "The Grey Zone," opening Oct. 11, a labor of love even its
backers knew would be commercially hopeless.</LD>
<TE>   Having shed his Hollywood outsider status, Nelson is now poised on
the edge of what he calls an insider trap. "I know I don't want to be
involved in cookie-cutter movies," he said. So far, he said, he's
been lucky as an actor that interesting movies have chosen him. As a
director, he said, "I want to direct films that I can't live without
shooting. It's that simple."</TE>
<TE>   Like a number of other Hollywood insider-outsiders such as
actor-turned-writer Mike White ("Chuck &amp; Buck"), or actor-directors
Tim Roth ("The War Zone") and Tim Robbins ("Dead Man Walking"),
Nelson seems drawn to darker, edgier material in his own films while
he works as an actor on more mainstream material.</TE>
<TE>   Poolside at the low-key Avalon Hotel in Beverly Hills, the
modishly stubbled Nelson sipped espresso for breakfast. He kissed his
pregnant wife, actress Lisa Benavides, goodbye and shielded himself
from the morning sun. At 38, he's a slight 5 feet 6, an intense yet
unneurotic New Yorker born and raised in Tulsa, Okla., and educated
in the classics and drama at Brown University and Juilliard Theater
Center. His voice projects education, sincerity and sly wit.</TE>
<TE>   It's funny, he said, how people compliment him these days on his
taste in movie projects. "I think I do have taste, but my career is
no manifestation of that. It's a manifestation of a lot of fortunate
rejections which were heartbreaking at the time. For most of the
1990s, before Joel Coen called and asked me to do 'O Brother, Where
Art Thou?,' I was begging to be in any movie that would have me. I
can't tell you the level of disappointment I experienced when I was
not offered the role of one of the Ferengi in "Star Trek: Voyager.' "</TE>
<TE>   He realized as a student that he would have to branch out from
acting to get work. "Quite frankly, if you look like me," he said,
"it's downright essential." Nelson said teachers told him, "You're
short. You're odd-looking. And it's just going to be difficult." Not
wanting to sit around waiting for the phone to ring, Nelson started
writing and directing plays for his classmates.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson's friends know him as a book-smart and street-smart
intellectual who is prone to using Latin-based words that sometimes
baffle them. So it's ironic that his most enduring characters have
been inarticulate simpletons and nerds.</TE>
<TE>   Explaining how an intellectual plays a nitwit, Nelson said it's an
actor's job to take seriously the outrageous or funny predicaments in
which his character finds himself. He said he decided to make Delmar
"innocent of knowledge. To me, that felt like a positive choice. When
knowledge did come to him, it was a wonderful or a dangerous or a
saddening surprise. All that's positive. It allows you never to
condescend to the character, which is the pitfall of any role,
particularly in a comedy."</TE>
<TE>   This year, Nelson has appeared in Steven Spielberg's "Minority
Report" and will star in director Andrew Davis' film adaptation of
the popular teen novel "Holes." To his former teachers' undoubted
shock, he has even landed romantic leads in "A Foreign Affair," a
comedy about two brothers (Nelson and David Arquette) who travel to
Russia to find traditional wives, and Finn Taylor's "Cherish," a
music-filled comedy released earlier this year to mixed reviews about
a young woman under house arrest who falls for her nerdy parole
officer (Nelson).</TE>
<TE>   Nelson, a product of both the Sundance writers and directors labs
in 1996, said that wise and generous mentors have appeared at crucial
junctures in his career. He said he's learned something from every
director he's worked with, from Terrence Malick (Nelson had a small
role in "The Thin Red Line") to Spielberg, Coen and Taylor. Coen
offered advice when he ran into trouble shooting and cutting "The
Grey Zone," Nelson said.</TE>
<TE>   As a writer, he said, he works haphazardly. "Eye of God" was based
on a single scene toward the end, when a battered wife takes out her
prosthetic eye and shows it to a young friend. "The Grey Zone"--a
personal project that began with stories he heard about his
grandparents' escape from Germany--was his second attempt to say
something new in the Holocaust genre.</TE>
<TE>   No matter if Holocaust films are heroic ("Schindler's List"),
fantastic ("Life Is Beautiful") or tragic, documented realism
("Shoah"), audiences generally know what to expect: Nazis kill Jews
on a mind-boggling scale, some people survive, and their stories
offer either redemption or caution. There is often a common emotional
strategy used in the stories and even the scores are similar.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, Nelson said, "there is no musical score in 'The Grey
Zone.' And it's not about survivors." The film relies on its audience
being very knowledgeable about the Holocaust. "If you weren't able to
harness your knowledge of it from movies you've seen before, you'd be
utterly at sea," he said.</TE>
<TE>   At first, Nelson had planned to write a play about his family's
experiences, but he scrapped that effort. "It was purgative for me
but not something worth spending an audience's time," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Through his own research, Nelson uncovered little-known stories of
the Sonderkommando who, unlike the kapos who kept fellow Jewish
prisoners in line in their barracks, helped prepare prisoners for gas
chamber deaths and disposed of the bodies. "As a Jew and a human
being reading about people faced with a predicament more
quintessentially human than any I can think of," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The Grey Zone" play was produced off-Broadway in 1996 at the
Manhattan Class Company and won numerous awards, including four Obies
and New York Newsday's Oppenheimer Prize.</TE>
<TE>   As a movie, however, the bleak, no-heroes subject made typical
Hollywood financing nearly impossible. Eventually, with Harvey Keitel
signed on as producer and cast member (he plays a cynical German
official in charge of a crematorium), Nelson persuaded Avi and Danny
Lerner, Israeli partners of Los Angeles-based Nu Image/Millennium, a
film production and distribution company, to provide the $4-million
budget. (Eventually the film was sold to Lions Gate, which will
release it.) Avi Lerner said he never expected to make a profit on
the film. "There's no commerciality in this kind of movie. We always
look at one thing. Can we make a profit or not? This movie, you do it
for the memory, for something special for the Jewish nation."</TE>
<TE>   Growing up in Israel, Lerner said, he often wondered why anyone
would help the Nazis. "You ask yourself why, why and why? That's the
reason I made this movie." The movie was shot in and around Sofia,
Bulgaria, where the Lerners have made several B movies. The
emotionally taxing film could never have been made in Hollywood, he
said. As many as 850 Bulgarians worked as extras, shaving their heads
and often appearing naked. "One day, I found myself in our gas
chamber with 250 naked Bulgarians covered in movie excrement and
blood, ages 5 to 80, male and female, piled on top of each other. I
honestly felt I was going mad at that point," Nelson said.</TE>
<TE>   "We all may have felt that to some extent," said David Arquette,
who plays an unlikely role as a Sonderkommando who beats another
Jewish prisoner to death. Known mostly for his silly persona in
movies ("Ready to Rumble") and TV ads for a phone company, Arquette
said that Nelson gave him a shot at the film because they had met on
a miniseries, "Dead Man's Walk," and became friends.</TE>
<TE>   "As an actor, I've never met anyone who's as caring and is so
interested and concerned with the actors' comfort," he said. "After
certain takes, he'd hug me and kiss the top of my head, fatherly in a
way. It was really nurturing and vulnerable on his part."</TE>
<TE>   On the festival circuit for a year, "The Grey Zone" has drawn some
criticism for its stylized, Mamet-like dialogue and praise for its
vivid and horrifying authenticity. "It's a very hard movie to watch,"
Lerner said. At a film festival in Israel, many people in the
audience could not bear to look at the screen, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Holocaust historians also said the movie could be controversial if
the Sonderkommando are portrayed as collaborators. "We must not
apologize for that kind of behavior," said Rabbi Marvin Hier of the
Simon Wiesenthal Center in L.A. "They were not heroic figures. But
they absolutely were not collaborators. They were victims themselves
doomed for extinction."</TE>
<TE>   Nelson, however, hopes his film will transcend politics. "I
believe, perhaps a little presumptuously, that this is more a story
about what it is to be human than it is a Holocaust story. As a
writer and filmmaker or novelist or painter, you have to find a tiny
place to write about. The more specific you are, and the more true
you are to that little world, the more universal it's actually going
to seem. It's that classic paradox."</TE>

<DH>Hayao Miyazaki's style is a hit in Japan and among
animators. Will U.S. audiences finally catch on?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES SOLOMON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>His name may be unfamiliar to American audiences, but to American
animators, Japanese director Hayao Miyazaki is a hero on a par with
Walt Disney, Chuck Jones and Tex Avery.</LD>
<LD>   "He is one of the great filmmakers of our time and has been a
tremendous inspiration to our generation of animators," says John
Lasseter, the Academy Award-winning director of the "Toy Story"
films. "At Pixar, when we have a problem that we can't seem to solve,
we often look at one of Miyazaki's films."</LD>
<LD>   Eric Goldberg, animation director of "The Looney Tunes Movie: Back
in Action" at Warner Bros., adds: "Miyazaki's films never fail to
amaze: He takes everyday situations and links them to extraordinary
circumstances. That he does so with such visual grace, economy, and
passion for the joys and fears of childhood is constantly
astonishing."</LD>
<TE>   In recent years, American animated features have become
increasingly realistic as filmmakers have turned to computer graphics
for three-dimensional settings and effects. Miyazaki reasserts the
power of drawn animation to create fantasies, offering an alternate
reality that is refreshingly free of overarticulated details. Instead
of rendering thousands of individual blades of grass bending in the
wind, he suggests a breeze passing over a grassy hillside by moving a
rippling line of color over a painted background. The result is
poetic rather than literal. American directors use MTV-style cutting
and endless tracking shots; Miyazaki allows quiet moments to play
out, telling the story visually rather than through dialogue or
songs.</TE>
<TE>   Since founding Studio Ghibli with his friend and former mentor
Isao Takahata in 1985, he's created a string of critical and box
office successes in Japan: "Castle in the Sky" (1986), "My Neighbor
Totoro" (1988), "Kiki's Delivery Service" (1989), "Porco Rosso: The
Crimson Pig" (1992), "Princess Mononoke" (1997) and "Spirited Away"
(2001).</TE>
<TE>   Until now, animated Japanese features have been box office duds
here, but Disney is hoping to change that when it releases "Spirited
Away" ("Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi") in the U.S. on Sept. 20. The
film was a blockbuster in Japan, earning more than $234 million in a
country with less than half the population and a fraction of the
screens of the U.S. and dethroning "Titanic" as the highest-grossing
film in Japanese box office history. Earlier this year, it became the
first animated feature to win the prestigious Golden Bear Award, the
top honor at the Berlin Film Festival, where critics and audiences
were stunned by the film's remarkable visual style.</TE>
<TE>   Although Americans spend more than half a billion dollars on anime
(Japanese animation) on video and DVD annually, Japanese features
have failed to attract large audiences to U.S. theaters. Despite
considerable press attention, "Metropolis," based on a manga (graphic
novel) by Osamu Tezuka, earned a mere $253,000 in a limited U.S.
release earlier this year. Miyazaki's "Princess Mononoke," which
earned a then-record-breaking $154 million in Japan, made only $2.4
million when Miramax released it theatrically in the U.S. in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Disney and Pixar executives, along with members of the animation
community who have seen the film, think "Spirited Away" could be the
61-year-old Miyazaki's breakthrough in America. It's opening in 10
cities and will build to a nationwide release, according to Disney,
which is planning a major advertising campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Lasseter, who served as executive producer on the English version
of "Spirited Away," says that like classic Disney films, " 'Spirited
Away' has humor, heart and tremendous character growth. It's a bit
scary at times, a bit strange--and wonderful: It sucks you in at the
beginning, and you forget about everything until it's over."</TE>
<TE>   Chihiro (voiced by Daveigh Chase, Lilo in "Lilo &amp; Stitch"), the
main character, starts out as a whiny adolescent sulking in the back
seat of her parents' car. When they get lost on the way to their new
home, the family blunders into what seems to be an abandoned theme
park but is actually a resort for traditional Japanese gods and
spirits. Guided by the mysterious, confident boy Haku (Jason
Marsden), Chihiro demands a job from Yubaba (Suzanne Pleshette), the
flamboyant, grasping witch who runs the spa.</TE>
<TE>   Although Yubaba assigns her hard, dirty jobs, Chihiro remains
immune to the corruption and greed that permeate Yubaba's realm. She
aids a variety of fantastic characters, including a river god
suffering from the effects of human pollution and the diaphanous
No-Face. She befriends Zeniba (Pleshette again), Yubaba's
grandmotherly twin, and repays Haku's kindness by helping him obtain
his freedom. The strength, courage and love she discovers within
herself enable Chihiro to rescue her parents and escape from the
fantasy world.</TE>
<TE>   The bizarre world Chihiro discovers evokes Japanese traditions
that are vanishing before the onslaught of a jejune media culture
Miyazaki dislikes.</TE>
<TE>   "The setting of 'Spirited Away' is an older Japan, one that
existed until a few decades ago," the director said via e-mail. "Many
adults cried when they saw that kind of almost forgotten scenery. But
children in Japan have never seen anything similar, so it's a
complete fantasy world for them. I think foreign audiences may feel
something similar to what Japanese children felt."</TE>
<TE>   Miyazaki made "Spirited Away" because he was disturbed by the
apathy and ennui he saw in Japanese children. "There are five young
girls, daughters of friends of mine, who visit me at my cabin in the
mountains every summer," he explained. "I read some girls' comics
they left at the cabin, and it seemed we'd been providing them with
nothing but a certain kind of cheap romance, which is not what girls
that age really dream about.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought about making a more interesting story where a
10-year-old girl could actually play the leading role. I wanted her
to be a typical girl--someone in whom a 10-year-old could recognize
herself. I wanted to show that people have strengths within them that
can be called on in extraordinary circumstances: That is how I wish
my young friends to be, and I think that's how they hope to be."</TE>
<TE>   When Miramax released "Princess Mononoke" in the United States,
fans of Japanese animation criticized the vocal performances (Billy
Bob Thornton, Billy Crudup, Gillian Anderson and Claire Danes, among
others) as sounding too American for a story set in Muromachi-era
Japan (1392-1573). But Disney felt "Spirited Away" should be released
with American voices rather than subtitles.</TE>
<TE>   "Miyazaki is a truly visual storyteller: He fills the entire
screen with images. When you watch a subtitled movie, you're really
focused on following the dialogue," says Pam Coats, an executive with
Walt Disney Feature Animation. "If your eyes are fixed on the bottom
of the screen, you're going to miss visual elements that are unique
and wonderful."</TE>
<TE>   The studio brought in Kirk Wise ("Beauty and the Beast,"
"Atlantis: The Lost Empire") to direct the English-language version
of the film. Wise said he felt as if he was doing his job backward.</TE>
<TE>   "On a typical American animated feature, we record the voices
first, then create the images to go with them," he explained. "Here
the images were already done and in full color; we had to find
Western voices that would fit those images."</TE>
<TE>   Creating the English-language version posed special problems for
the actors, writers and director. Not only did the script have to
preserve the meaning of the original, but each line had to have about
the same number of syllables, so the new dialogue could be
synchronized with the existing animation.</TE>
<TE>   "We had the writers in the booth with us, so that if an actor had
a difficult time fitting a line to the character's mouth movements,
we would do a rewrite on the fly to shave off a syllable or
substitute a shorter word for a longer one," Wise recalls. "We had to
get the sync to work while making sure the performance sounded
natural--it couldn't sound like the actor was trying to force a lot
of words into a very small space. Our editor would sometimes take a
single syllable from one take and splice it into the middle of a
sentence from another, just to get it that much tighter."</TE>
<TE>   The Disney team also had to add an occasional line to explain
Japanese cultural references to non-Japanese viewers. "There are
times when the imagery on the screen is something a Japanese audience
would recognize but Americans wouldn't," Lasseter explains. "We made
sure the character identified what they were looking at. At the
beginning of the film, when Chihiro sees the little houses, we had
her ask, 'What are those?' and her mother answers, 'Those are
shrines; people think spirits live in them.' So we set things up to
make sure they're clear to American audiences."</TE>
<TE>   Miyazaki is at work on projects for the Studio Ghibli Museum in
Mitaka, Japan, where he is the executive director. When they're
completed, he will begin his next feature, scheduled for release in
summer 2004. Although he hadn't seen the English-language dub at the
time of the interview, Miyazaki was anticipating it with a typical
mixture of confidence, optimism and humor.</TE>
<TE>   "To my way of thinking, 'Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi' left home
and went off to America to become 'Spirited Away,' " he concluded.
"It's almost as if I'd seen my daughter go away to school in America.
I'm sure John Lasseter has done a good job, but I wouldn't be
surprised if she comes back a little bit Americanized and speaking
with a slight foreign accent."</TE>

<HD>In a Definitive Set, an Electrifying Look at Miles Davis at
Montreux</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>OK, you first bought Miles Davis' "Kind of Blue" in its original
incarnation as an LP. Then, since you wanted to listen in your car,
you picked up the cassette version. And, of course, when CDs arrived,
you had to have it in digital form, followed by the deluxe CD
remastering, as well as the two books about the making of the album.</LD>
<LD>   As a dedicated Davis aficionado, you probably also felt compelled
to acquire the "Complete Birth of the Cool," the deluxe CD versions
of "Water Babies" and "Filles de Kilimanjaro," the three-CD "Complete
In a Silent Way Sessions," the four-disc "Complete Bitches Brew
Sessions," the six-CD "Complete Columbia Recordings, 1955-1961," and
the seven-disc "Complete Live at the Plugged Nickel 1965."</LD>
<LD>   And just think, soon you may have the opportunity to buy each and
every one of them all over again in either (or both) of the new DVD-A
or SACD audio formats.</LD>
<TE>   In the meantime, assuming you haven't yet overdosed on Davis,
there is now the opportunity to garner his largest record release so
far. Perhaps to get an early start on the holiday gift-buying season,
on Oct. 1 Sony is releasing "The Complete Miles Davis at Montreux,
1973-1991" (****). In a grand total of 20 discs, the boxed set
encompasses Davis' appearances during nearly two decades at the
hugely popular Swiss music festival.</TE>
<TE>   Interestingly, when the event's founder, Claude Nobs, first
invited Davis to perform, the response was direct, to the point and
completely negative. According to Nobs, Davis replied via a telegram,
saying, "Your offer is an insult to my color and talent." Eventually,
however, acceptable terms were agreed upon--including a Ferrari for
Davis' use during his stay in Montreux--and he made his initial
appearance at the festival in July 1973.</TE>
<TE>   It would be 11 years before Davis would return, in July 1984. From
then on, he appeared annually (with the exception of 1987) through
1991. Nobs even overlooked his basic rule of not having artists
perform at the festival in consecutive years, and there were several
occasions when Davis played both afternoon and evening concerts. His
last dance at Montreux, on July 8, 1991, had an extraordinarily
sentimental subtext for Davis. At the urging of Quincy Jones, who
produced the event, Davis made a rare exception to his career-long
refusal to reexamine past glories and agreed to a "live" re-creation
of several of his classic large ensemble recordings with Gil Evans,
including selections from "Miles Ahead," "Porgy and Bess" and
"Sketches of Spain."</TE>
<TE>   The 20th CD in the set chronicles a final performance in France a
few days later, on July 17, 1991, with his sextet of the time, which
featured alto saxophonist Kenny Garrett. (Davis' last concert took
place Aug. 25, 1991, at the Hollywood Bowl; he died the next month,
on Sept. 28.)</TE>
<TE>   Bootleg versions of Davis' Montreux performances have been
drifting around Europe for years in one form or another. But this
fully authorized collection is complete, containing--according to the
program notes--"every single note that the legendary Miles Davis
played at the Montreux Jazz Festival."</TE>
<TE>   "We decided that to cut even one single note from the concerts
would be a crime," Nobs adds in his commentary.</TE>
<TE>   The result is a stunning musical document--an utterly compelling
opportunity to experience Davis in detail during his electric period,
a time viewed with some disdain by many fans of his work from the
'50s and '60s.</TE>
<TE>   The gap between the 1973 and 1984 appearances, in fact, helps
illustrate the considerable differences between Davis' early '70s
efforts and his music of the '80s. The '70s band, which included,
among others, saxophonist Dave Liebman, bassist Michael Henderson and
drummer Al Foster, was still working at the integration of elements
from jazz and rock, free improvisation and electronics.</TE>
<TE>   By the '80s, Davis had surrounded himself with young players--John
Scofield, Bob Berg, Robben Ford, etc.--who had come to maturity
during an era when stylistic boundaries had largely lost their
divisive powers.</TE>
<TE>   It is particularly interesting to hear these ensembles playing in
settings that allow for considerably more expansive soloing than
generally took place in their studio outings.</TE>
<TE>   The resulting view suggests that this period in Davis' oeuvre has
not been properly acknowledged for the high level of its creative
accomplishments. Vastly different from the Davis '50s and '60s
groups, these were, nonetheless, prime jazz ensembles.</TE>
<TE>   Yet another intriguing aspect of this in-depth view of a great
jazz artist's work is the opportunity to hear the way identical songs
can produce different results at different times. Four CDs, for
example, are dedicated to the Davis band performances of July 14,
1985. Discs 7 and 8 chronicle the complete afternoon performance.
Discs 9 and 10 encompass the evening concert, at which the identical
program of material was performed.</TE>
<TE>   The contrasts, even in the same day's playing, are especially
striking in extended works such as the medleys "Theme From Jack
Johnson; One Phone Call/Street Scenes; That's What Happened" and "MD
1; Something's On Your Mind; MD2," in which the wide-open areas for
soloing trigger completely differing results from Davis'
players--especially Scofield, who seems determined never to repeat
himself. On slower numbers--"Star People" is a good example"--Davis
shifts gears easily from his blues-flavored exposition of the
afternoon version to a more mournful, long-toned improvisation in the
evening performance.</TE>
<TE>   It's also fascinating to examine the way Davis deals with the same
material over a period of years. Cyndi Lauper's "Time After Time," an
obvious favorite, is played in 1984, '85, '86, '88, '89 and '90--each
time differently, continually in search of new perspectives within
the song's keening melodic structure.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, there is the climactic (as it turned out) rendering of
the Miles Davis-Gil Evans collaborative works. The only material in
the Montreux box that has been previously issued, it met with
conflicting reactions when first released in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   The negative view questioned why the re-creation was undertaken in
the first place, why Davis should be asked to repeat (by reading
music) performances that had seemed so complete in their original
manifestation. And, in addition, whether it was fair to Davis, not in
good health at the time, to ask him to take on the demanding trumpet
solo passages.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps in anticipation of problems in that respect, Quincy Jones
included trumpeter Wallace Roney--well known for his capacity to
simulate the Davis style of the '50s and '60s--in the ensemble.
(Surprisingly, the video of the event seems to reveal that Davis
managed to play most of the solo segments himself.)</TE>
<TE>   On the positive side, although the performance cannot compare to
the original, it nonetheless has historical and musical value. Davis
was an authentic jazz original, comparable to Picasso in his constant
quest for new creative adventures. If he believed that it was worth
revisiting one of the pinnacle achievements of his career, who are we
to argue?</TE>
<TE>   Art critics would probably have gone up in smoke if Picasso had
decided, near the end, to do another work in his rose or blue period
styles. But could any of those observers have resisted examining such
works closely? Artists are entitled to make their own seemingly
enigmatic decisions.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, the Montreux collection, despite its high cost--the
list price is $249.98--is a vital jazz compilation, a stunning
overview of a crucial period in the work of a major 20th century
musical artist.</TE>

<HD>Just When You Least Expect It</HD>
<DH>Summer's action flicks and comedies are history. Now
studios want to spring a few surprises--the darker the better.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNE VALDESPINO</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Punch-Drunk Love" is called a "romantic comedy," but from
writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson ("Magnolia" and "Boogie
Nights"), expect something different.</LD>
<LD>   It's about an angry guy who cries inexplicably, buys cases of
chocolate pudding to earn frequent flier miles, and busts glass when
he blows his stack. His newfound love, played by Emily Watson, fuels
a raging fire within him. Will he go mano a mano with the bad guy,
played by Philip Seymour Hoffman? And which crazed hombre will be the
last man standing?</LD>
<LD>   The craziest part of it all, though, is that the angry-guy hero is
played by ... Adam Sandler. It's a scary side of the funny man
audiences have never seen, and it's as astounding as watching Jackie
Gleason in "The Hustler" or Jerry Lewis in "The King of Comedy."</LD>
<TE>   It's the time of year in the movie business when the unexpected
becomes the norm and the term "adult audience" isn't an oxymoron.
Summer is over, and the endless sequels, blockbusters, comedies and
flashy action flicks aimed at teens have been washed away with the
rolling surf. When kids go back to school, studios get, well, more
studious--and more adventurous.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, there are some big pictures, like the days-of-British-empire
epic "The Four Feathers"; the artsy "Frida"; the "Silence of the
Lambs" prequel, "Red Dragon"; the "Charade" remake "The Truth About
Charlie." And there's lighthearted fare too, including "Sweet Home
Alabama," a romantic comedy starring Reese Witherspoon; a Jackie Chan
family-friendly action comedy, "The Tuxedo"; the Eddie Murphy-Owen
Wilson comedy "I Spy"; and the kids film "Jonah--A Veggietales
Movie."</TE>
<TE>   But overall, fall is the time studios use to get that offbeat,
thought-provoking or absolutely uncategorizable movie into the
theaters, and give it time to develop Oscar legs or at least some
highly profitable word-of-mouth buzz.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Sherak of Revolution Studios, which is releasing "Punch-Drunk
Love" on Oct. 11, says the season is an ideal time for the film. "You
wouldn't put this in summer because in summer it's one movie eating
up another and this movie needs to breathe. This is 'Get the movie
open and let the public catch on.' "</TE>
<TE>   There's an animated film in the fall as well, but true to the
season, it's not the kind American audiences are used to. "Miyazaki's
Spirited Away," an epic-sized tale by revered Japanese animator Hayao
Miyazaki is being released Sept. 20 in a new English-language version
by Disney. In the fall, even the cartoons have artistic pretensions.</TE>
<TE>   Here are some of the other fall highlights:</TE>
<TE>   Darker Tales</TE>
<TE>   "Punch-Drunk Love" joins the ranks of fall films that touch on
edgier topics and deeper themes. It's not unusual for the season.
Past autumn releases have included "Training Day" (2001) and
"American Beauty" (1999)--and remember, both of them ended up winning
some major Oscars.</TE>
<TE>   Moviegoers seem to warm up to challenging subjects as the weather
cools off. This year there's "The Rules of Attraction" (Oct. 11), an
adaptation of the Bret Easton Ellis novel about privileged kids in an
Ivy League college who fill their empty souls with sex and drugs, and
"The Grey Zone" (Oct. 11), director Tim Blake Nelson's Holocaust
drama.</TE>
<TE>   Also in the not-a-lot-of-laughs category is "Das Experiment," a
German drama in which a group of men submit to a psychological study,
playing the roles of inmates and guards in a prison. In the beginning
they meet, chat and become friendly. But once the experiment starts,
they quickly turn against each other.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest issue presented here is that your next-door neighbor
who you view as a nice, friendly guy can turn out to be a beast, and
I think it's more true than not," said Meyer Gottlieb, president of
Samuel Goldwyn Pictures, which is releasing the film Sept. 20.</TE>
<TE>   "Auto Focus" (Oct. 18), a different stripe of biopic on the life
of Bob Crane, star of "Hogan's Heroes," is also a walk on the wild
side. Greg Kinnear plays Crane, a hard-working suburban dad who seems
straight out of a '60s sitcom until he meets John Carpenter (not the
movie director), played by Willem Dafoe. The two share their sexual
addiction and love of video photography. Is it a biopic or one of the
darkest buddy films ever made?</TE>
<TE>   Director Paul Schrader, who jokingly referred to it as "Oscar and
Felix make a porn movie," said the chemistry between laid-back
Kinnear and edgy Dafoe, drives the film. "Greg is quintessentially
West Coast and Willem is quintessentially East Coast--even though
they're both Midwesterners. They hit it off great and they became and
remain friends."</TE>
<TE>   Carpenter is the enabler who leads Crane into a world of
self-gratification and self-absorption, hence the title.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that his sin, if he had one, was not sex but
selfishness," Schrader said. "Because he was good-looking and funny
and a TV celebrity, he could behave the way he wanted and people
always forgave him."</TE>
<TE>   Films for Women</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, there are plenty of fall films designed to appeal to
females. "The Banger Sisters" (Sept. 20) stars Goldie Hawn and Susan
Sarandon as a bartender and a mother, respectively, recounting their
wild days as rock groupies.</TE>
<TE>   And there's "White Oleander" (Oct. 11), which stars some of
today's most popular actresses in strong roles. Michelle Pfeiffer
plays Ingrid, an artist who is the independent and opinionated mother
of 15-year-old Astrid (Alison Lohman). After Ingrid is sent to prison
for killing her boyfriend, her daughter goes to live with two foster
moms, played by Robin Wright Penn and Renee Zellweger.</TE>
<TE>   Based on the bestselling novel by Janet Fitch, it's about a girl
who drops "straight through the bottom of the system" and has to find
a way to escape her domineering and destructive mother's influence,
said director Peter Kosminsky. "It's a serious subject, but it's a
universal theme that faces every single one of us."</TE>
<TE>   "Tuck Everlasting" (Oct. 11) also tackles the coming-of-age theme,
but with a softer approach. Set in the early 20th century and based
on a popular young adult book by Natalie Babbitt, it tells the story
of another teen, Winnie Foster (Alexis Bledel of "Gilmore Girls"),
with a domineering mother (Amy Irving). While wandering in the woods
near her home, she meets Jesse Tuck (Jonathan Jackson) and his
unusual family. The movie's teens-in-love story has deeper elements
as well, raising philosophical questions about the nature of
immortality.</TE>
<TE>   The film also stars Sissy Spacek and William Hurt as Jesse's
parents, and Ben Kingsley as the threatening Man in the Yellow Suit.
In a touching scene, Hurt explains to Winnie that immortality sounds
wonderful but has to be entered into carefully. The theme gives the
film an intriguing twist, said co-producer Marc Abraham.</TE>
<TE>   "It has this fantastic theme at the core: what's the meaning of a
life well-lived, and if you had the choice to live forever, what do
you do?"</TE>
<TE>   Deep Emotions</TE>
<TE>   Deep questions and deep emotions resonate in fall. It's a good
time to release "Moonlight Mile" (Sept. 27), starring Dustin Hoffman
and Susan Sarandon, a film that had languished at a few other studios
before landing at Disney, noted Dick Cook, chairman of Walt Disney
Studios.</TE>
<TE>   The story begins after the untimely death of a young woman and
shows her fiance and parents dealing with their grief. It's based on
the real-life experience of writer-director Brad Silberling, whose
girlfriend was killed by a stalker.</TE>
<TE>   "It's difficult to put this one into a genre of film," said Cook.
But fall is a good time for it, he said. "Because in fall, a film can
really build and garner the great word-of-mouth and be in the
marketplace for a period of time, not just one week or one weekend."</TE>
<TE>   Niche Markets</TE>
<TE>   Fall is also a great time for smaller films to find an audience.
Call it "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" syndrome, but several films that
appeal to special audiences will roll out, hoping to hit it big in
their target market and expand.</TE>
<TE>   Some, like "Greek Wedding," will aim first at an ethnic market,
then expand to wider audiences. "Skins" (Oct. 11) is a follow-up to
Chris Eyre's "Smoke Signals" and, like that film, deals with Native
American life. "Real Women Have Curves" (Oct. 18) tracks a young
Latina trying to strike a balance between her dream of going to
college and staying to help her family. Two films are aimed primarily
at African American audiences: "Brown Sugar" (Oct. 11), a romantic
comedy, stars Taye Diggs, Mos Def and Queen Latifah, and "Barbershop"
(Friday) is an ensemble comedy about that unique institution in the
black community, and stars Ice Cube and Cedric the Entertainer.</TE>
<TE>   A handful of fall films celebrate or star musicians: Madonna
returns, directed by husband Guy Ritchie in a remake of "Swept Away"
(Oct. 11); Marilyn Manson appears in the Michael Moore documentary
"Bowling for Columbine" (Oct. 4); and Philip Glass has penned the
score for "Naqoyqatsi" (Oct. 18).</TE>
<TE>   Controversy</TE>
<TE>   The fall also allows films that are "talkers" a chance to play as
long as the buzz continues to build. Moviegoers are anticipating
"Biggie and Tupac" (Sept. 27), a documentary by Nick Broomfield who
fascinated Nirvana fans with "Kurt &amp; Courtney." He drops another bomb
by alleging that the LAPD played a role in the murder of Notorious
B.I.G. (a.k.a. Biggie Smalls).</TE>
<TE>   "The lead detective in the case resigned from the LAPD and
basically he was prevented from following certain lines of inquiry
investigating (former LAPD officers) Rafael Perez and David Mack, who
is now in prison for bank robbery," Broomfield said. "It would be
fantastic to make some contribution to moving the story on, [Biggie
Smalls'] mother wants to find out what happened and have some kind of
justice done."</TE>
<TE>   "Bloody Sunday" (Oct. 11) dives into an even larger battle: the
Catholic-Protestant conflict in Northern Ireland. It chronicles a
peace march in Belfast in 1972 when 27 civilians were shot by the
British army. It has already stirred debate--and excellent
reviews--in Ireland and Britain, where it opened earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Biopics</TE>
<TE>   Besides "Auto Focus," the fall's other major biopic is "Frida"
(Oct. 25), which stars Salma Hayek in a part close to her heart, that
of famed Mexican artist Frida Kahlo. Directed by Julie Taymor, best
known for her Broadway staging of "The Lion King," it co-stars Alfred
Molina as Mexican muralist Diego Rivera, Edward Norton as Nelson
Rockefeller and Geoffrey Rush as Leon Trotsky.</TE>
<TE>   Hayek credits Taymor with unveiling a stunning vision of Mexico
from the pyramids to colonial cities, and including the faces of
children and old people, folk art and images of masterworks by both
artists.</TE>
<TE>   "That was one of my motives for making the film," said Hayek, who
was awaiting the Italian premiere of "Frida" at the Venice Film
Festival. "I knew it was going to shake off the cliches about my
country. It shows the sophistication and the beauty and simplicity of
Mexico."</TE>
<TE>   It took Hayek years to bring the story to the screen. She called
in favors from friends, took on the role of producer, shepherded the
project from cable to the big screen because she knew it needed a
bigger budget. She said she "stalked" Molina for three years until he
caved in and said yes to the role of Rivera.</TE>
<TE>   So is fall a good time to release "Frida"?</TE>
<TE>   "I could think about it and give you a very smart answer, but the
heartfelt answer is, as far as I'm concerned, the right time is
today," Hayek said. "I've been waiting for this movie forever, so
this is the perfect time. Finally, after seven years."</TE>

<HD>Dear Old Mom? Hardly</HD>
<DH>Talk about tough love. This season, actresses specialize
in, um, hard-to-like parents. The primal experience never looked so
scary.</DH>

<LD>I'm sorry Mama, I never meant to hurt you. I never meant to make you
cry but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet.</LD>
<LD>   --Eminem</LD>
<LD>   As the young hero (Kieran Culkin) of "Igby Goes Down" is--how to
put this delicately?--beating on his mother's (Susan Sarandon)
corpse, he finally feels a moment of remorse: "Why is it the first
time I feel remotely affectionate toward her is when she's dead?"</LD>
<TE>   Likewise, when the young heroine (Alison Lohman) of "White
Oleander" finally emerges from the oppressive shadow of her mother
(Michelle Pfeiffer), her emotions are mixed: "No matter how much she
damaged me, I know my mother loves me."</TE>
<TE>   Mothers. We hate them, we love them, we need them, we hate that we
need them. And for those of us who become them, we hopefully grow to
better understand our own. The movies have certainly given us their
share of memorable moms from Joan Crawford's Mildred Pierce (rhymes
with fierce) to Faye Dunaway as Joan Crawford, who became infamous
for inappropriate use of a clothes hanger.</TE>
<TE>   Susan Sarandon, who plays mothers in three fall films, points out
that when she played one in "Pretty Baby" 24 years ago, "it was
considered sort of a kiss of death to your career. Apparently your
sensuality was supposed to dwindle."</TE>
<TE>   Several actresses have won Oscars playing mothers with kids in tow
while eking out a living, serving tables, forming the union, fighting
the corporations. Think Ellen Burstyn in "Alice Doesn't Live Here
Anymore," Helen Hunt in "As Good as It Gets," Shirley MacLaine in
"Terms of Endearment," Sissy Spacek in "Coal Miner's Daughter," Sally
Field in "Norma Rae," Julia Roberts in "Erin Brockovich," Halle Berry
in "Monster's Ball."</TE>
<TE>   Even the absence of mothers in movies is worth mentioning. If
little girls have grown up believing they didn't need one, remember
that Snow White, Ariel, Cinderella, Belle and Pocahontas either had
no mothers or had the evil step variety. OK, Bambi had one but they
shot her.</TE>
<TE>   Up to now, 2002 movie moms have been generally sympathetic
although hardly complicated. Diane Lane was a devoted mom whose real
interests lay elsewhere in "Unfaithful." Jodie Foster went buff and
tough to protect her daughter in "Panic Room." We've had the loving,
wise moms overseeing monsoon and big fat Greek weddings. "The Divine
Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood" offered mushy tears of
reconciliation between a mother and her daughter. Hugh Grant did
better mothering than Toni Collette's suicidal mess in "About a Boy,"
but you still had to love her. So far this year, only those vain and
self-absorbed moms in "Lovely &amp; Amazing" have dared venture into dark
places.</TE>
<TE>   But there are plenty others coming, and mothers may not choose to
recognize themselves. We are talking selfish. ("Why would my son do
this to me?" Candice Bergen asks of her newly engaged son in "Sweet
Home Alabama." "Did you ever for a second think how this reflects on
me?" demands Susan Sarandon of her son's poor school performance in
"Igby.") Overprotective, overbearing, often cruel. ("You are fat and
ugly," says the mother of America Ferrera in "Real Women Have
Curves.") Desperate. (Just watch Faye Dunaway and Swoosie Kurtz drink
and pill-pop themselves under the table in "Rules of Attraction.")</TE>
<TE>   Of "8 Mile," need we say more than that the November drama stars
Eminem with Kim Basinger as his mother? ("This is not his biography,"
a studio publicist insists, "and let us say Kim's character is simply
flawed.")</TE>
<TE>   These mothers are portrayals that may, as Sarandon says,
"exaggerate how most of us are in real life," but at least they
attempt to create fully formed portraits of human nature.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe we should applaud the fact that movie moms are getting
closer to the bone. In "White Oleander," it is Pfeiffer's tough love,
not her beauty, that makes the skin crawl. As Ingrid, a mother who
spends most of the film behind bars, she still manages to nearly
destroy any semblance of happiness her daughter may find. Her creator
insists, however, that she is not all bad. There is both a pivotal
moment of selflessness and a stubbornly admirable strength.</TE>
<TE>   "The best mothers look at their children without expectations,"
says Janet Fitch, author of the novel "White Oleander." "Ingrid, in
my story, is a shaper, which is more traditionally the father's role.
It's about mother as the central core, and Astrid, her daughter,
ultimately can survive because she has that image of her mother's
strength inside her."</TE>
<TE>   Her story bears similarities to "Real Women Have Curves," which
also deals with a suffocating, rigid mother and the daughter who has
to finally break free to find herself. "The mother's logic is based
on her own cultural experience," explains Lupe Ontiveros, who plays
the mother. "And even though her daughter finally must go far away,
we see they are very much alike. She has her mother's strength but
with an academic orientation."</TE>
<TE>   Both "White Oleander" and "Real Women Have Curves" began as comic
pieces, the former as a short story with the mother as the
protagonist. "It was a black comedy," Fitch says, "but my friends
said the mother was a monster. So I gave her a daughter and then it
wasn't funny anymore." Lupe Ontiveros had performed "Real Women" on
stage as a comedy. When she first read the screenplay, now a drama,
she found the mother frightening. "I finally came to realize that
maybe this was the true mother under all that comedy," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Using humor to offset mom as monster is, of course, one way of
making her less so. "Real Women's" director, Patricia Cardoso, says
testing showed that audiences found the mother character "too mean,
too mean. We found just by going back and using the same lines but
different takes of certain scenes made the difference. We also moved
up a few scenes where she shows some humor, like when she thinks
she's pregnant but finds it is something called menopause. Now I
think audiences will find her tough and manipulating, but maybe
understand that here is a woman who has worked since she was 12 and
in her own way loves her daughter."</TE>
<TE>   "Blue Car," a film well-received at Sundance and scheduled for
November release, is, like "Igby," "White Oleander" and "Real Women,"
a coming-of-age tale that features another mom from hell, portrayed
by Margaret Colin.  Colin was worried the character could be a
"one-note monster" but she and writer-director Karen Moncreiff worked
to soften some of the edge.</TE>
<TE>   "On the surface, she's so unsympathetic," Moncreiff concedes, "but
Margaret gave nuance to Diane's struggle, adding layers of humor and
humanity. Like a scene when her younger daughter starts asking about
the birds and the bees. Margaret gives us an expression like 'not
this one too,' which is very funny. I'm hoping audiences will see her
as an open wound, but because she lets down her younger daughter,
they still can't forgive her."</TE>
<TE>   "Igby Goes Down," "The Banger Sisters," "Sweet Home Alabama" and
"8 Women" (which features a who's who of French stars, including
Catherine Deneuve as a wealthy mother with two daughters and a
closetful of skeletons) are out-and-out comedies that cloak their
far-less-than-ideal mothers in humor.</TE>
<TE>   Igby's mom (played by Sarandon, who also stars with Dustin Hoffman
in "Moonlight Mile" and as Goldie Hawn's "Banger Sister") is
scathingly portrayed, although the film's writer-director, Burr
Steers, says it is possible to find some humanity in there.</TE>
<TE>   "The only way not to see her as a monster is to see it from her
point of view," he says. "She sees herself as the victim, everything
has been perpetrated on her, including this son. ["His creation was
an act of animosity, why shouldn't his life be one?" she says
pointedly.] But still, as everything is falling apart around her, she
has kept the family somewhat together."</TE>
<TE>   Crucially, Sarandon points out of the sons, "obviously they've
inherited some of her humor and irony."</TE>
<TE>   Sarandon's mother in "The Banger Sisters"--played opposite Hawn's
single sexpot--is less loathsome but comes to realize that she has
lost her inner groupie and is drowning in blandness. ("I'm the color
of the Department of Motor Vehicles!") Her teenage daughters, the
younger of whom is played by her real daughter Eva Amurri, make fun
of her anal retentiveness ("She danced? With her perfect purse?") but
come to appreciate her.</TE>
<TE>   "I see it as a comedy but not a broad comedy," writer-director Bob
Dolman says. "Susan's transition is the biggest one in the movie, and
I take that seriously."</TE>
<TE>   Dolman began the story about 10 years ago, thinking he'd write
about two young groupies and rock 'n' roll.</TE>
<TE>   "During that time, I had kids of my own and my characters kept
changing, and the truth was, they became more interesting as they got
older," he says. "What makes the mother character interesting ...
even while she's funny, is that like many parents with reckless
pasts, they're scared their children will follow in their paths. What
she learns is that it's better to be open and honest with kids as
they get old enough to understand."</TE>
<TE>   "Moonlight Mile" writer-director Brad Silberling says that as the
mother whose daughter was gunned down as a bystander in a domestic
dispute, Sarandon is a "searing beacon of truth. Despite the loss of
her own daughter, she's the one who helps those around her survive."</TE>
<TE>   Sarandon, who also played mothers in "Stepmom" and "Anywhere but
Here," notes that "I'm now being told that I've done too many." She
plays no favorites among her September troika. "Like children, I love
each one differently," she says. "I hope there's a part of me in each
one. I can relate to their mistakes and frailties, their denial."</TE>
<TE>   The theme of mothers heading off kids lest they repeat their own
mistakes is echoed in the romantic comedy "Sweet Home Alabama," which
features Reese Witherspoon and a trio of moms: Candice Bergen as the
mother of her fiancee, Jean Smart as her soon-to-be ex-husband's, and
Mary Kay Place as Witherspoon's. Bergen's politician is played mostly
for laughs ("It seems the voters like being reminded that I'm a
mother"). Smart says hers is "the mom who knows how things are going
to turn out without stepping on her kids." Place is the one who sent
her daughter off too fast just to give her a shot at more than she
ever had.</TE>
<TE>   The film's director points out that any story about relationships
should include those who had the most impact on the main characters.</TE>
<TE>   "We decided the key to this romantic triangle was the mothers,"
Andy Tennant says. "For them to be ignored would be to miss out on
what choices were made and why." Even though one of the guys doesn't
get the girl, it may be just as big a triumph that he gets out from
under his mother's grasp.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously, having popular actresses like Place, Sarandon or
Pfeiffer portray what could be perceived as unappealing characters
is, as director Burr Steers says, "key, key, key." Spacek may have
plotted the murder of her son's killer in her bedroom last year, but,
heck, she's earned her mom stripes many times over. The actresses say
they yearn for the colors such roles can offer.</TE>
<TE>   "You're not working to please the audience," says Ontiveros,
"you're working to give the character life, soul and rhythms. We
can't always be the likable characters, but we can be real." She
describes her character as diametrically opposed to her own
experience--and therein lies the challenge. Use what you are, but
then some.</TE>
<TE>   "I think you can't deny what you're using as an actress and a real
parent," says Amy Irving, who plays one of two mothers (Spacek is the
other) in "Tuck Everlasting." "In this film, my challenge was not to
be the kind of mother I am." While Spacek is the immortal earth
mother of the popular book, Irving's Mother Foster (created for the
film) is yet another mom that's hard to love.</TE>
<TE>   "She is a woman not forthright with her affections and so rigid in
her beliefs," says Irving, who last played the mother of a teenage
drug addict in "Traffic." "But the beauty of her is that she changes
and learns and there is an arc. I'd have been less interested if
she'd never gotten it."</TE>
<TE>   The film's director says he hopes the audience will come around to
respect, if not embrace, Irving's character. "When her daughter
catches a glimpse of Amy taking care of her dying mother," explains
Jay Russell, "she realizes her mother isn't a complete cold fish. But
let's face it, it's Sissy's character who you love because she's
everyone's mother--or at least the warm side of everyone's mother."</TE>
<TE>   What most of the new films share is the need to break free of
mothers, be they dysfunctional, dominating or even well-meaning. They
are about children learning to live on their own, even as they are
pulled the other way. ("You don't go anywhere until I let you go,"
Mom declares to son in "Igby Goes Down.")</TE>
<TE>   "In the end, our mother doesn't grow so the daughter is the one
that has to grow," says "Real Women" director Cardoso. In "Blue Car,"
the young protagonist "learns your parents just can't always parent
you," says director Moncreiff. It doesn't necessarily mean they are
bad mothers but the truth is, very few of us can be perfect ones.
"From a child's point of view, any mother who isn't there 100% is a
bad mother," observes Fitch.</TE>
<TE>   No doubt movie mothers will continue to be great fodder, and if
they're taking a bit of a cinematic beating this fall, at least there
are real issues being dealt with.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's face it, it is the most primal relationship," says Steers.</TE>
<TE>   And actresses, especially moms in real life, seek to play them.
"When my 12-year-old son saw 'Tuck Everlasting,' he was so moved, he
sat down and wrote his first poem," says Irving. "That was really
cool because as a mother, I live to impress my children."</TE>

<LD>I read Kenneth Turan's movie reviews every week, and I agree with him
90% of the time. Sometimes he'll say something that surprises me, and
this is one of those times. I really felt he got it all backward with
"Big Heart, Big Box Office" (Sept. 1).</LD>
<LD>   He says there was an emotional connection in "Spider-Man." The
only emotion that the film created for me was fear. Fear that studios
will make more and even worse mindless, incoherent drivel like
"Spider-Man." Poor Kirsten Dunst, all those bad lines she had to
speak.</LD>
<LD>   Then Turan says, "The remarkable thing about 'My Big Fat Greek
Wedding's' success is that, by most standards, it is not a very good
film."</LD>
<TE>   Granted, the film does not bring up philosophical debates, but it
is a good film: Good casting, good dialogue, a simple and coherent
script, good cinematography, and it's warmhearted and funny.</TE>
<TE>   That's more than I can say for the old Spidey. Every aspect of
that film was terrible, especially the script, and when the script's
bad, you can throw in all the computer-generated imagery you want,
it's still gonna be another "Godzilla" or "Planet of the Apes."</TE>
<TE>   Like I said, he got it all backward.</TE>

<LD>Agustin Gurza needn't immolate himself in the lukewarm crucible of
something so minor as an accident of birth ("Must a Critic's Heritage
Dictate His Opinions?," Sept. 1).</LD>
<LD>   What he laments as unique to minority critics is actually an
ancient universality with no real racial component as such. What does
he expect when dealing with Ricky Martin and Paulina Rubio, et al,
and their acolytes? They're merely south-of-the-border Mellencamps
and Spearses. So what's new?</LD>
<LD>   Gurza's responses to reactionary elements are unnecessary and
counterproductive, not to mention solipsistic. How rather
inadvertently hilarious, then, when, in his closing two paragraphs,
he finishes his apologetics by pointing out his positive reviews of
Mexican artists.</LD>
<TE>   When it comes to the scions of political correctness, nothing is

<LD>James Glennie, a British auction house cataloger, was combing through
a Norfolk mansion this summer when he spotted a small, framed
document hanging in a dark corner of the library. It was an original
expense account from a 1776 voyage of Capt. James Cook. An
interesting discovery about the discoverer. Then Glennie's hand
grazed something. He turned the frame over. He pried a bit. What he
uncovered tells an old story, fascinating even in an age of e-mail.</LD>
<LD>   Secretly hanging for unknown decades in that country house was a
handwritten, 231-year-old letter from Cook to the British Admiralty
with first news of the safe return of his HMS Endeavour from a
perilous three-year exploration of the South Pacific, including
Australia's discovery. Written in his distinctive florid script upon
sighting British shores, Cook's missive was rushed to shore by
passing fishermen.</LD>
<LD>   The letter, to be auctioned Dec. 17 by London's Bonhams
Auctioneers, reported the status of the Endeavour and its crew (30%
died of malaria and dysentery contracted in Indonesia) and presaged
recognition of the thorough navigation, seamanship and science of an
explorer whose lonely voyages from Newfoundland to Antarctica, from
Alaska to Botany Bay, completely redrew the known world.</LD>
<TE>   A farmer's son, the astute Cook apprenticed on North Sea
merchantmen. His charting and navigational acumen helped ensure
Britain's victory over France in Quebec, which changed North American
history. Cook's voyages in wooden boats little longer than a
tractor-trailer chronicled Australia, Antarctica, Asia, northwest
America, numerous Pacific islands and cultures and debunked the myth
of a Northwest Passage over North America.</TE>
<TE>   His pioneering collections and reports on exotic plant life shaped
biology; his suspicions and experiments about nutrition conquered
scurvy. After wandering terra incognita as no man before then, Cook
died in a 1779 skirmish with Hawaiian natives caught stealing a royal
rowboat. His mutilated body was buried in the sea he lived his life
upon.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, if Capt. Cook had e-mail, the world then could have
learned of those journeys instantly on, say, www.captcook.com and
discussed his discoveries in online chat rooms ("Cook rules!" "You
go, Jim!") with pop-up cell phone and mortgage ads. Who wants to read
an actual non-laser-quilled letter from the 18th century and conjure
images of its adventures?</TE>
<TE>   With today's technology, we could have simply deleted those
useless old letters and reports and been done with them, as we do so
routinely and ruthlessly in our everyday life now. What can old
stories teach the residents of future times about the human spirit
anyway?</TE>

<LD>With the blast came fear, and a prominent leader spoke up: "As much
as we want to get the terrorists, we want to do it in a methodical
way that preserves our freedoms."</LD>
<LD>   That's what then-Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich said after a
pipe bomb killed two at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996.</LD>
<LD>   Now, a year after the vastly more devastating attacks of Sept. 11,
President Bush is pulling out all stops to prevent further slaughter.
But he's reluctant to have his methods challenged.</LD>
<TE>   So it's up to Congress and the courts, spurred by citizen
watchdogs, to assertively remind him that democracy is held together
with checks and balances, and that protecting America means
preserving liberties, even in the age of terror.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the nation's history, enemies who might now be termed
terrorists have threatened: British, Comanche, Confederates, Germans,
Japanese and left-and right-wing radicals of every stripe.</TE>
<TE>   How Americans contended with those who attacked with weapons and
words has shaped the nation that today is braced against assault by
Islamist fanatics.</TE>
<TE>   Neither traditional warriors nor traditional criminals, these new
enemies are particularly troublesome. What hasn't changed is a debate
that was contentious from the moment Americans decided to shake free
from England's king: How much freedom does the nation sacrifice in
the interests of survival, and who decides?</TE>
<TE>   Precedents Born in Crises</TE>
<TE>   "I would rather be exposed to the inconveniences attending too
much liberty than to those attending too small a degree of it,"
declared Thomas Jefferson. Then, during a confrontation with France,
John Adams used the new Alien and Sedition Acts to shut down
Jeffersonian newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   In the name of saving liberty, President Lincoln suspended the
writ of habeas corpus, a time-honored right of prisoners to appear in
open court and know the charges against them. Lincoln's
administration rounded up thousands of civilians and tried suspected
traitors before military tribunals. It tampered with freedom of the
press. Supporters even arrested a preacher for failing to include a
prayer for the president of the United States in a sermon.</TE>
<TE>   "The Civil War," writes William Rehnquist, chief justice of the
Supreme Court, "was the first time that the United States government
mobilized for a major war effort, and a major war effort necessarily
results in the curtailment of some civil liberties."</TE>
<TE>   The war on terrorism is no exception. And the constriction of
freedoms did not begin with the sweeping powers granted law
enforcement agencies by the Patriot Act or the Bush administration's
efforts to reinvent government by establishing a massive Homeland
Security Department. Nor have the battle lines to protect freedom
adhered to partisan lines.</TE>
<TE>   Disappearance of Caution</TE>
<TE>   As the Clinton administration scrambled to pass anti-terrorist
legislation after the Oklahoma City bombing, for instance,
conservatives railed against and finally blocked laws to give law
enforcement more power. Then-Rep. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) expressed a
popular theme: "There is a greater fear in this country, and that is
fear of our own government."</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers backed by the National Rifle Assn. used civil liberties
arguments to defeat a measure that would have made it easier to track
bomb makers by putting chemical markers in the ingredients used to
make explosives. Republicans and the ACLU successfully opposed the
Clinton administration's call for expanded wiretap authority, which
would have given law officers the ability to listen in on every phone
a suspect used.</TE>
<TE>   Last September's destruction obliterated much of that caution, and
roving wiretaps are now part of the anti-terror arsenal.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 11, President Bush tried to reassure the nation:
"Terrorist attacks can shake the foundations of our biggest
buildings, but they cannot touch the foundation of America."</TE>
<TE>   Good words. But in his actions, Bush himself was undermining the
nation's constitutional footings.</TE>
<TE>   Author Gore Vidal goes so far as to warn that the U.S. is in the
grip of "metastasizing martial law."</TE>
<TE>   That's overreaction. Few Americans are so naive as to mistake the
approach of FBI wingtips for the sound of Nazi jackboots. But they do
grasp the singular danger that Al Qaeda continues to pose.</TE>
<TE>   Yet those who feel no chill at the Bush administration's post-9/11
power grab are in denial about government's age-old tendency to use a
moment of fear to snatch away rights.</TE>
<TE>   We want the government to prevent plotters from igniting a
radioactive "dirty bomb" in Los Angeles Harbor. If the government
catches someone pumping anthrax into Sears Tower, we want its agents
to swiftly arrest, detain and prosecute.</TE>
<TE>   But we want it done with the least possible impact on individual
liberties.</TE>
<TE>   In the next two days we'll offer a few thoughts on why a sensible,
bipartisan resistance should work to rein in the president's
understandable but ill-advised urge for more power and to restore the
balance between rights and security in the age of terrorism--even in
an election year.</TE>

<DH>Virtual 'universities': Web sites sell phony academic
degrees based on 'life experience.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID COLKER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A licensed architect since 1986, Stephen Corbin always wanted a
college degree, saying the lack of a diploma to hang on his wall left
him with "an empty feeling."</LD>
<LD>   Between running his own company--which specializes in public
school projects--and raising a family, the Bakersfield resident never
had time to polish off his course work. Instead he called a telephone
number at the bottom of an e-mail advertisement offering degrees from
a European university based on "life experience."</LD>
<LD>   But the University of San Moritz, which granted him a bachelor's
degree in architecture and a master's degree in business
administration, is one of numerous names used by a worldwide Internet
diploma mill that sells phony diplomas, trumped-up transcripts and
ersatz honors such as summa cum laude.</LD>
<TE>   "We went through a discussion of what I had done in my profession,
running a business and everything like that," Corbin said. "And they
said, 'Oh yeah, you qualify.' "</TE>
<TE>   His degrees cost him $500 in a package deal. The "university" also
offered him a doctorate, but that "would have been pushing it too
much." He did allow San Moritz to backdate his architecture degree to
1985 to make it seem as if he had gotten it just before he received
his license.</TE>
<TE>   Like its low-tech predecessors that advertised on
matchbook covers, the University of San Moritz, which also operates
as Glencullen University and the University of Wexford, and numerous
other regal-sounding diploma mills prey on ego and greed--college
graduates earn 62% more than nongraduates, according to the U.S.
Census Bureau.</TE>
<TE>   But unlike traditional diploma mills, the online versions exploit
the wide reach of the Internet to send millions of e-mail
advertisements promising degrees without "tests, classes, books or
interviews.... No one is turned down."</TE>
<TE>   The history of so-called universities that sell degrees without
any education or true evaluation of experience goes back at least to
the 19th century, said John Bear, coauthor of "Bear's Guide to
Earning Degrees by Distance Learning," which includes information on
diploma mills operating on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing has much changed, except that on the Internet it's so
much easier," he said. "You can set up a site in an hour and send out
e-mails. Then you just need a printing press."</TE>
<TE>   There may be dozens of these operations, with names such as
Earlscroft University, thought to originate in Belgium, and Trinity
College and University, with offices in Pakistan and Venezuela. But
the Glencullen-Wexford complex is among the slickest.</TE>
<TE>   The online diploma mills create elaborate Web pages that feature
pictures of campus buildings, classrooms and student outings. But the
images and much of the text often are copied from the Web sites of
legitimate universities such as the University of Southampton or
University of Teesside in England.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Question of Legitimacy</TE>
<TE>   Former FBI agent Allen Ezell, who conducts seminars for college
registrars on spotting phony transfer credits, scoffed at the notion
that a prospective degree buyer could think the "universities" are
legitimate.</TE>
<TE>   "If you negotiate for your grade-point average, get a degree
backdated and can pay extra for honors, I think your alma mater is of
questionable veracity," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But the digital facade is comforting to prospective degree buyers,
Bear said. "In a few cases [customers] have convinced themselves the
degree is legitimate."</TE>
<TE>   They go so far as to list the degrees on personal and work Web
pages. Among them: a congressional candidate in Northern California,
a rabbi who does family counseling in the San Fernando Valley, an
assistant director of financial aid at Occidental College and a
student counselor/psychology teacher at College of the Canyons in
Santa Clarita.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a time when if someone had a degree from a diploma
mill, you would hardly ever hear about it unless somehow it became
public," Bear said. "But now people put it right on their Web sites."</TE>
<TE>   The congressional candidate and rabbi maintained that they took
classes through these institutions. The others acknowledged buying
degrees, but said they felt they deserved them.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Acquiring a Doctorate</TE>
<TE>   "I've been around, I've paid my dues. I just felt that this was
one way of building up my own ego," said Stu Ferdman, 62, who teaches
psychology and is a student counselor at College of the Canyons. He
listed a "Doctor of Philosophy Degree in Psychology from Glencullen
University" among his credits on the college Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Ferdman earned a conventional bachelor's degree in psychology
and a master's in counseling from San Diego State. He didn't want to
spend the time or money needed to achieve a regular doctorate. "I
could not necessarily afford the $30,000 it would probably take to go
through one of the USC or Pepperdine programs," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He did not find it inappropriate for a college counselor, who
advises students on educational and career choices, to buy a
doctorate. "I'm fully qualified, I've been doing it for 25 years," he
said. "This has nothing to do with the students per se."</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after Ferdman spoke to The Times, his degree was removed
from the college Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Dale Gouph, head of the international unit of the American
Assn. of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers, said digital
diploma mills do not evaluate life experience in granting degrees.
"I'm willing to bet that every applicant, once the fee has been paid,
becomes a graduate," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The multiple university names pose problems for registrars at
legitimate colleges weighing the value of transfer credits. "We have
seen students try to use transfer credits from places like
Glencullen," Gouph said. "I'm sure some of them slip by, especially
at schools where the staff is small and does not have time to
investigate every credit."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   E-Mails From Romania</TE>
<TE>   The global reach of the Internet allows the fake schools to hide
behind a complex multinational operation. "The e-mails emanate from
Romania, the printing presses are in Jerusalem and wire transfers go
to London," said Ezell, the former FBI agent. In a recent College &amp;
University Journal article, he traced the history of the Glencullen
group to 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Attempts to reach the universities were unsuccessful. Calls to the
telephone numbers on the Glencullen and Wexford sites led to
identical recorded messages, even though the schools are supposedly
in different countries. There was no response to requests for
interviews.</TE>
<TE>   Congressional candidate David LaPere, running on the Democratic
ticket in California's newly drawn 21st District, which includes all
of Tulare County and part of Fresno County, said he began taking
University of Wexford correspondence classes in 1990, finishing his
bachelor's degree in political science in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   LaPere, who listed the degree on the League of Women Voters
district information page, said he chose Wexford--located in Zurich,
Switzerland--because "they were one of the few who did take life
experience into account."</TE>
<TE>   Swiss officials doubted Wexford was a real school. The Rectors
Conference of Swiss Universities, which acts as a liaison between the
government and universities, had no record of Wexford's existence
until 2001, when it began receiving inquiries about the school's
legitimacy.</TE>
<TE>   "I am sure they never offered classes," said Thomas Tschumperlin,
director of admissions at the University of Zurich. "It is a business
selling degree packages."</TE>
<TE>   Tschumperlin visited the street address given by Wexford, finding
"a business building, with a shoe and a watch store at street level."
There was no mention of any school in the building directory. Campus
pictures on the Wexford site had been from the Web pages of the
University of Teesside.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No Evidence of Classes</TE>
<TE>   Government officials in Oregon, which has the strictest laws in
the country regarding the use of academic degrees, said there was no
evidence that any of the universities in the Glencullen group,
including Wexford, had offered classes. "I don't think even they
would claim that," said Alan Contreras, head of the state degree
authorization office.</TE>
<TE>   LaPere refused to show The Times any of his course work. "That is
not acceptable," he said, ending the interview.</TE>
<TE>   Rabbi Arnold Stiebel, formerly of Temple Beth Torah in Granada
Hills, advertises his divorce and family conflict mediation service
with a Web page that lists his "Ph.D. in counseling from Glencullen
University."</TE>
<TE>   Contacted by telephone, Stiebel said he preferred not to
discuss his Glencullen degree. But he said he took four years of
correspondence courses from professors associated with the
university. "Most of them were in New Jersey," Stiebel said. He would
not provide contact information for them.</TE>
<TE>   Glencullen could not be visited for answers. The Dublin, Ireland,
street address given on its Web site does not exist. The pictures and
text on its site had been lifted from the University of Southampton
Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Architect Corbin said he regretted buying a San Moritz degree. "I
can tell you in retrospect I shouldn't have done it," he said. "I
thought maybe it would be good for business, but it has not been
worth the paper it's printed on."</TE>
<TE>   If anyone should know how the education system is supposed to
work, it is Frank Reyes, assistant director of financial aid at
Occidental College. On Occidental's site, he claimed a bachelor's
degree from Glencullen. However, the reference has been removed from
the site.</TE>
<TE>   Reyes acknowledged buying the degree, but said he believed the
claims that he could get it based on his experience and classes he
had taken at a computer school. Reyes said he was "stunned" to hear
that Glencullen didn't exist. "I had even thought about taking a trip
next year to visit my alma mater."</TE>

<HD>Defense Shift Drives a Boost in Spending</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A year after the attacks of Sept. 11, the United States has launched
a once-in-a-generation increase in defense spending and is taking it
in a new direction, even though most of the money spent this year and
next will be for paying and supporting troops in the war on terrorism
and not for sparkling new weapons.</LD>
<LD>   At least $30 billion in new appropriations since Sept. 11 have
been spent on supporting troops in Afghanistan and elsewhere and
patrolling U.S. coastlines, air space and military bases. The heavy
burden of such operational spending will continue indefinitely
because of the higher level of readiness since Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   But the Defense Department also is embarking on a long-term effort
to transform traditional ships, planes and armaments into networked
communications and computing platforms. In military planning and
spending terms, this is a historic turning point comparable to the
aftermath of World War II, when the modern Defense Department was
created, and the early 1980s, when the Reagan administration
dramatically increased the military budget.</LD>
<TE>   The defense budget, due to rise 15% to $366 billion in fiscal
2003, which begins Oct. 1, is projected by the Congressional Budget
Office to expand more than 8% a year for the rest of this decade.
Defense spending would total almost $700 billion in fiscal year 2010,
but still would be a smaller percentage of the total U.S. economy
than during the big defense buildup in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon policy is shifting away from traditional plans to fight
major wars against other nations. The new emphasis will be on
creating "a portfolio of capabilities" aimed at "dissuading potential
adversaries from threatening the United States, its interests, or its
friends and allies," in the words of Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D.
Wolfowitz in a recent guidance for military departments planning
budgets for 2004 through 2009.</TE>
<TE>   The aim is to develop flexible armed forces capable of combating
terrorist groups and chemical, biological and technological warfare.
The Pentagon has begun awarding contracts for design of new kinds of
ships and aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   It is ordering satellite surveillance systems and advanced
communications and computer systems that would allow U.S. forces to
hit enemy targets from afar. Planners cite the fighting in
Afghanistan, in which global positioning satellites in space and U.S.
special forces on the ground identified targets then hit by
traditional bombers, as an example of information aiding weaponry.</TE>
<TE>   The new defense policies could bring many jobs to major defense
contractors over this decade, but also could curtail or cancel other
programs for fighter planes, helicopters, tanks and other vehicles.
For example, Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld recently
canceled the Army's Crusader artillery program, which would have cost
$11 billion, to free up funds for the high-tech weapons his policies
favor.</TE>
<TE>   Smaller companies stand to benefit most from the Pentagon's new
emphasis. Companies such as L-3 Communications Holdings Inc. and
Alliant Techsystems Inc. are thriving by supplying communications and
smart-weapons components to major defense contractors--Lockheed
Martin Corp., Northrop Grumman Corp. and others.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts caution that growing defense budgets don't
automatically make defense stocks a successful investment. "Despite
large increases in spending, there are still too many programs to be
funded," says analyst Pierre Chao of Credit Suisse First Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Investors can watch for argu- ments over program cuts between
Rumsfeld and Defense Department officials and committees of Congress,
where views of the military services and defense contractors often
hold sway.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Rumsfeld wants to cut back the F-22 fighter program
to eventual production of 180 planes, down from the 331 planes that
the Air Force and contractor Lockheed Martin are counting on
producing and the 750 planes envisioned a decade ago when the F-22
was conceived as a replace- ment for the F-15 fighter. Billions of
dollars in research and planning have been spent on the F-22 so far.</TE>
<TE>   So why cut back production, which has not even begun? One reason,
given by Wolfowitz and others, is that fighter planes, which imply
close air combat, will be needed less when warfare is carried on from
long distances by surveillance systems and long-range bombers and
ships. A bomber version of the F-22 is being considered for
development, says a Lockheed Martin spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   The new class of destroyer that Northrop Grumman is designing at
its Newport News, Va., shipyard exemplifies the new weaponry. In an
artist's rendering, the proposed vessel looks like a metal box on a
long raft, recalling the Merrimac and Monitor of the Civil War. But
such a ship, packed with elec- tronics, computing and laser gear and
communicating constantly with satellites, is supposed to be able to
stand offshore and disrupt the workings of whole cities. In concept,
it could stand in the Persian Gulf and target Baghdad, say military
analysts.</TE>
<TE>   There are several implications of the new policies favoring mobile
special forces as opposed to massive forces. In military tactics,
they recognize, as Rumsfeld says repeatedly, that U.S. forces can't
be ponderous and slow in a world in which enemies move with speed and
stealth. Of course, the Viet Cong taught the United States that
lesson long before Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Shifts in defense policy have given rise to entrepreneurial firms
within a long-established industry.</TE>
<TE>   L-3 Communications was created in 1997 by former executives of
Loral Corp. when Loral was acquired by Lockheed Martin. L-3 has grown
to more than $3 billon in annual sales by concentrating on
sophisticated communications such as new systems it is developing to
allow Army helicopters to share information in combat.</TE>
<TE>   Alliant Techsystems, a specialist in ammunition, was formed in
1990 when Honeywell International spun off defense operations. And
United Defense Industries, which did $2 billion in research work on
the now-canceled Crusader, is a medium-sized company backed by former
Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci's private equity firm Carlyle Group.</TE>
<TE>   Will that Crusader artillery system research now go to waste? Not
really. Whatever principles of physics, aerodynamics and propulsion
were discovered will be applied to other weapons systems and perhaps
ultimately in the commercial economy.</TE>
<TE>   Global positioning systems now guide commercial trucking and
shipping--and automobile drivers too. Integrated circuits, invented
in 1958 with support from defense research, have become ubiquitous in
devices of modern life. And the Internet, developed in 1969 with
Pentagon support, goes on simultaneously shrinking the world and
expanding knowledge.</TE>
<TE>   Defense spending, which has been crucial to the development of the
U.S. economy--not to mention the economy of Southern California--for
at least 60 years, is entering a new expansive period.</TE>

<TE>How Defense Shares Have Fared</TE>
<TE>Shares of most defense-related companies are higher today than they
were the day before the terrorist attacks, reflecting investors'
increased interest in the sector over the last year. But shares of
smaller defense issues generally have fared better than the stocks of
the industry's biggest companies, as investors have hunted for niche
players. Here are stock price data and market capitalizations (share
price multiplied by number of shares outstanding) for 17 companies.</TE>

<LD>Here are some things to consider ["Disney Channel Putting Classics
Back in the Vault," Sept. 3]:</LD>
<LD>   Disney's California Adventure is opening a "kiddie area." The
Disney Store has converted itself into a haven for kids' toys and
costumes. The Disney Channel makes itself solely into a programming
venue for kids and teens.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, Tokyo DisneySea, a theme park designed with all ages in
mind, is a runaway success. EBay makes a fortune with thousands of
Disney products bought and sold by adults every day. "Lilo &amp; Stitch"
grosses $150 million, an amount that reflects the film's grown-up wit
and humor, not to mention adult admissions.</LD>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, California Adventure is a white elephant that's
costing Disney hundreds of millions of dollars. Sales at the Disney
Stores are down precipitously.</TE>
<TE>   The witless kid flick "The Country Bears" bombed. And now there's
an outcry about the decline of adult programming on the Disney
Channel. And rightly so.</TE>
<TE>   Disney executives just don't seem to understand a very basic
concept of their own business. Disney is not, and has never been, in
the business of kowtowing to kids.</TE>
<TE>   In the last few years, they have been alienating the very audience
that loves their products most, and probably contributes the most to
Disney's bottom line--adult Disney fans. The ones who spend tens of
thousands of dollars on Disney weddings, Disney home furnishings,
Disney vacations and even Disney time-shares.</TE>
<TE>   As Eisner &amp; Co. wring their hands over ABC's decline, they are
neglecting the core Disney businesses and letting it be run by people
who insist that "Disney" equals "kids."</TE>
<TE>   Disney is not a kiddie company. It is in the business of family
entertainment. Frank Wells and Jeffrey Katzenberg seemed to
understand that in the late '80s and early '90s; the one who
apparently does not understand that is the last remaining member of
that triumvirate.</TE>
<TE>   Disney seems intent on alienating grown-ups. And they seem to be
succeeding.</TE>
<TE>   John Josephs</TE>
<TE>   Studio City</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TV has become the great baby sitter. Kids and parents don't sit
and watch TV together as they did 30 or 40 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Parents by and large have abdicated the decision-making role to
their kids when it comes to television. They buy their children TVs
and most of the time don't even pay attention to see whether what
they are watching is suitable.</TE>
<TE>   No wonder Disney and other kids' channels are creating and
marketing shows that appeal only to their target groups while
ignoring the rest of the family members.</TE>

<TE>   Iraq's Oil Is Sole Reason</TE>
<TE>   for U.S. Intervention</TE>
<TE>   Wow! There it is: "Oil Runs Deep in U.S. Stance on Iraq" [James
Flanigan, Aug. 25]. Who would have guessed?</TE>
<TE>   Let's face it. Oil is not "one reason for wanting to displace the
Iraqi regime," it's the only reason.</TE>
<TE>   Take away the need for oil, and how would our national priorities
change with regard to the "political and economic reform" of Iraq?</TE>

<TE>   Farmers Are Behind</TE>
<TE>   'California Grown' Effort</TE>
<TE>   "Some Farmers Are Skeptical of Ads for State's Produce" [Aug. 23]
may have given readers the impression that California's farmers and
ranchers do not support the new "California Grown" promotion and
advertising campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing could be further from the truth; not only does the
agricultural industry in California support the concept, they are
supporting it with their dollars. To date, 20 agricultural industries
have joined the Buy California Marketing Agreement, the organization
that oversees the California Grown campaign effort.</TE>
<TE>   Those industries represent everything from produce, nuts and wine
to fish, meat and wood products. Combined, they account for more than
$6 billion in annual sales. Each industry is paying to be part of the
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The farmers, ranchers and producers whose industry organizations
are supporting California Grown recognize that the campaign will
boost demand for and sales of their products. And they know that this
will help them survive in an increasingly competitive environment.
That's why they support California Grown.</TE>

<TE>   It's Time to Make</TE>
<TE>   IPOs Truly Public</TE>
<TE>   Am I the only one confused about those so-called IPOs? While they
are initial offerings, they have never been "public." IPOs have been
used by brokerages to curry favors from the big-money clients for
years.</TE>
<TE>   Now that it has become public that Bernie Ebbers, the former CEO
of WorldCom, made $11 million in four years from IPOs funneled to him
by Salomon Smith Barney, some folks are beginning to see the light
["IPOs Net $11 Million for WorldCom Ex-CEO," Sept. 1].</TE>
<TE>   Why not require that the SEC issue all IPOs on a lottery basis
with a minimum of 100 shares and a maximum of 1000 shares allocated
per winning applicant?</TE>
<TE>   The SEC would be reimbursed as a part of the cost of the offering.
Then they could honestly be called initial public offerings. There
will never be integrity in the stock market until the government
requires that the public aspect of a company "going public" is a
reality instead of a ruse.</TE>

<HD>Priorities in Right Order to Get New Venture Off the Ground</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: My husband spent eight years and $45,000 building an
experimental aircraft, which we now wish to sell to finance a new
business. We've weighed the pros and cons of selling something so
near and dear to our hearts, but we think we can get $70,000 if we
sell it. The advantages of having that large a sum to help us move in
a new direction far outweigh the luxury of flying instead of driving
to weekend adventures. But we're concerned about taxes. Would we have
to pay any on the sale, and how much?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Congratulations for being willing to sell an asset to fund
your new venture rather than going into debt. Every pilot alive knows
how tough it can be to part with a beloved plane--particularly one
you built by hand. You and your husband obviously spent a lot of time
clarifying your values and deciding you're willing to make the
sacrifice.</LD>
<LD>   You will have to pay some tax when you sell the plane, as you'll
be making a profit on the sale. The good news is that your $25,000
profit will be taxed at the more favorable capital gains rate of 20%,
plus whatever applicable state tax applies, rather than at higher
income tax rates. That should still leave you with quite a nice
amount to launch your business.</LD>
<TE>   You'll want to make sure you can prove your tax basis, or the
amount you spent building the plane, said Bob Trinz, an editor of
RIA's Federal Taxes Weekly Alert. The Internal Revenue Service will
require that information if you're ever audited. Hopefully, your
husband kept all the receipts for materials and supplies he purchased
along the way.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Drain Debt First, Then Install Swimming Pool</TE>
<TE>   Q: We would like to put in a backyard pool, which will cost
$24,000. We are refinancing our house to incorporate the payment into
our mortgage. But our broker told us he may be able to get us only
$13,000 on top of our mortgage because of my husband's heavy student
loan debt. We can't do a home equity loan because our house is only 2
years old and we don't have enough equity built up yet. Is there
another course of action we can take to help us get the pool?</TE>
<TE>   A: Yes. You can wait until you can afford it.</TE>
<TE>   Lenders today are more than willing to let you borrow more than is
good for you. So if you're running into trouble, you know your
situation already is out of hand.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, you shouldn't be borrowing money to pay for a luxury--and
that's what a pool is. In most areas of the country, a pool won't add
much value to your home and may even detract from the sale price,
because many buyers won't want the hassle or danger pools can pose.</TE>
<TE>   Pools are typically more valued in climates where they can be used
year-round, as in Southern California, but you still shouldn't expect
one to add much value to your home. Such is the fate of most home
improvements, from fancy kitchens to new decks--they begin to date
almost immediately. And you don't want to borrow money to pay for
something that's going to depreciate.</TE>
<TE>   Concentrate on paying down those student loans. Once you've got
those under control, you can start saving so you can pay cash for
your pool.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hang On to Pre-1987 403(b) Statements</TE>
<TE>   Q: You recently answered a question about how long 401(k)
statements should be saved. You said most people didn't need to save
their statements unless they made after-tax contributions or had
company stock in the plans. But what about 403(b)s? I seem to
remember that funds deposited in these accounts before Jan. 1, 1987,
can qualify for special treatment at distribution.</TE>
<TE>   A: You're right. Although 403(b)s are similar to 401(k)s, they're
not quite the same. Here's one aspect in which they differ.</TE>
<TE>   With 401(k)s, you're generally supposed to start withdrawing money
in the year after you turn 70 1/2. Money deposited in 403(b)s before
1987, by contrast, doesn't have to be withdrawn until age 75, said
Peter Weinberg, an expert in pension law at TIAA-CREF, which manages
teacher retirement funds. Those few years can make a big difference
in increasing your nest egg.</TE>
<TE>   So if you made contributions to your 403(b), you'll want to hang
on to your old statements to prove that.</TE>
<TE>   You also should know that you can delay distributions from a
401(k) or a 403(b) indefinitely if you're still working for the
employer that provided the plan. Not many of us plan to be working
past age 70, but those who do can continue to leave their savings
untouched.</TE>

<HD>New Tax Break Adds Appeal to Hybrids</HD>
<DH>Autos: IRS approves three vehicles for a $2,000 deduction,
but there are caveats.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Johnson just found another reason to love his Honda Insight.
Besides great gas mileage and low emissions, the car may net him a
$600 federal tax refund this year.</LD>
<LD>   The Insight was one of three hybrid vehicles recently approved for
a new tax break from the Internal Revenue Service.</LD>
<LD>   "It's great," said Johnson, an Ann Arbor, Mich., engineer who
maintains a Web site for Insight fans at www.Insightman.com. "With
the deduction, the cost of these [hybrid] vehicles is getting into
the range of an ordinary gas-powered car. I think the sales are
likely to take off."</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, the combination of new technology and new tax breaks has
created a lucrative opportunity this year for car buyers who opt to
purchase a low-emission hybrid vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   The IRS in the last month has approved three cars for a special
$2,000 tax deduction: the Toyota Prius, a hybrid version of Honda's
popular Civic and the Insight, which Honda has said it may
discontinue in about a year to make room for production of more
Civics and other hybrids. The deduction can be applied against the
car owner's income for the year in which the car was purchased--even
if that was as long as three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   IRS officials won't say whether they are considering additional
cars for this deduction.</TE>
<TE>   However, auto makers have become serious about pursuing this
market. Last week, for example, longtime rivals Nissan Motor Co. and
Toyota Motor Corp. agreed to a partnership aimed at creating 100,000
Nissan hybrids for the U.S. market. Ford Motor Co. and General Motors
Corp. also are developing hybrid vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   First Use of '93 Law</TE>
<TE>   The cars, which are powered by a combination of gasoline and
electricity, are covered by a 1993 law offering tax deductions for
"clean-fuel vehicles." The law has been largely unused because it
wasn't clear which cars would qualify for the break. Auto makers
began submitting product specifications to the IRS this year, after
the agency clarified which types of models might qualify.</TE>
<TE>   In August, the government announced that Toyota's Prius would be
the first model certified for the low-emission tax deduction. On
Friday, the IRS also approved Honda's two hybrid models. All three
hybrids qualify for the full $2,000 deduction.</TE>
<TE>   Other cars eventually may qualify for at least part of the
deduction, which is intended to prod auto makers to produce cars that
are more environmentally friendly and to encourage Americans to buy
them. But to date, the IRS hasn't named any other contenders.</TE>
<TE>   The clean-fuel vehicle deduction is a so-called before-the-line
write-off, which means it can be claimed regardless of whether you
itemize deductions, reducing by $2,000 the amount of income that's
subject to taxation, said Jim Rivin, partner at Woodland Hills
accounting firm Rivin, Wenzel &amp; Co. That can save someone in the 31%
tax bracket $620.</TE>
<TE>   California does not offer a low-emissions deduction, so don't try
to claim this break on your state tax return.</TE>
<TE>   Because this deduction reduces adjusted gross income, it also may
help taxpayers claim other income-tested credits and deductions
offered elsewhere in the federal tax code.</TE>
<TE>   It's tricky to claim, however, because there's no specific line on
the tax form for it, said Mark Luscombe, principal tax analyst with
CCH Inc. in Riverwoods, Ill. Instead, taxpayers take this deduction
by listing it with their other before-the-line write-offs, such as
individual retirement account contributions and student loan interest
deductions.</TE>
<TE>   For example, on line 32 of the 2001 1040 form, taxpayers were
asked to add together the before-the-line deductions listed on lines
23 to 31, Luscombe said. In the instructions for this line, the IRS
notes that other before-the-line deductions that have no line of
their own can be added there.</TE>
<TE>   Taypayers who want to take this deduction should write "clean-fuel
vehicle deduction" in the blank space on line 32, Luscombe said. And
be sure to keep records of the car purchase, in case the deduction is
questioned later.</TE>
<TE>   The one-time deduction is claimed in the year the car was
purchased. And the Prius and Insight models released in 2001, 2002
and 2003 qualify, officials said. (The Civic hybrid was just
released.) However, those who bought hybrid vehicles in a previous
tax year must file an amended tax return to claim it. To amend a
return, the taxpayer must file a form 1040X for the applicable year.</TE>
<TE>   Some Caveats</TE>
<TE>   The deduction is temporary. It starts to phase out in the 2004 tax
year, when the amount of the deduction will fall 25% to $1,500, said
Jim Carlin, partner with Los Angeles tax law and accounting firm
Holthouse Carlin &amp; Van Trigt. The next year, it will fall to $1,000
and in 2006, the taxpayers will be able to deduct just $500, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, taxpayers who resell their hybrid during the first three
years of ownership must "recapture" all or a portion of the
deduction, Carlin said. If the car is sold within a year of purchase,
100% of the deduction must be added to the taxpayer's income for the
year in which the car was sold; if it's within two years, two-thirds
of the amount previously deducted--or about $1,333--must be added
back in. If the car is sold before it has been owned for three full
years, the recapture equates to one-third of the previously claimed
deduction.</TE>

<HD>'Right' Financial Response to Sept. 11 Remains Unclear</HD>
<DH>Long-term investment outlook is still foggy as questions
raised by the attacks persist. For many, safety now is priority.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM PETRUNO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The history of financial markets is a history of one question asked
repeatedly in retrospect: "What on Earth were people thinking?"</LD>
<LD>   With the passage of time, the herd mentality of investors at key
market inflection points inevitably appears so wrong-headed as to
seem absurd.</LD>
<LD>   So it was with the panic selling of stocks in October 1987, for
example, and the panic buying of anything Internet-related in 1999.</LD>
<TE>   But one year after the terrorist attacks, it is far from clear
what constituted the "right" investor reaction to the attacks, and
what might be labeled a mistake.</TE>
<TE>   The problem for markets, as for the nation as a whole, is that too
many of the questions raised by the attacks remain unresolved, and
may stay unresolved for a long time. That makes it difficult to say
that any money decision made in the aftermath--or any change in the
long-term outlook for investment returns--was right or wrong.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, stock prices in general are lower today than they were
on Sept. 10, when an attack of the magnitude of what occurred the
next day was inconceivable to most Americans.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 9,605.51 on Sept. 10.
When trading reopened Sept. 17, the Dow dived 684.81 points, or 7.1%,
to end at 8,920.70. The market continued to fall for the rest of that
week as many investors fled. On Friday Sept. 21, the Dow closed at
8,235.81. It had fallen 14.3% for the week, the second-worst weekly
loss since at least 1915.</TE>
<TE>   But the next week the market began to rebound, and it mostly
continued to do so through December. Wall Street's optimists said the
market correctly foresaw that the allied invasion of Afghanistan
would succeed in routing the Taliban and that the U.S. economy would
not fall into the depression that many initially had feared.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the fourth-quarter rally wasn't sustainable. By spring, the
bear market that began in March 2000 was again in full effect. By
midsummer, major stock indexes were at five-year lows.</TE>
<TE>   The market rallied for much of August but has struggled in the
last two weeks. The Dow lost 2.7% last week to end at 8,427.20. That
left it 12.3% below the close on Sept. 10 of last year.</TE>
<TE>   The broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index is 18.2% below its Sept.
10 close; the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite is down 23.6%.</TE>
<TE>   But measured from its close on Sept. 21, the low point after the
attacks, the Dow is up 2.3%. In the same period, the S&amp;P 500 is down
7.4% and the Nasdaq is off 9%.</TE>
<TE>   So share prices fell substantially in the first reaction to the
attacks, but today they aren't much below the worst levels of that
sell-off.</TE>
<TE>   How much, then, has a fear factor specifically related to the
attacks, or to worries about more attacks, depressed stocks since the
initial sell-off? After all, the market has had more than terrorism
to fret about since September. The economy's health remains a big
question, and the wave of corporate scandals has almost certainly
helped to depress stocks.</TE>
<TE>   "I doubt that equity prices would be sizably different today
without Sept. 11," said James Gipson, co-manager of the Clipper Fund
in Beverly Hills and a well-known "value" stock picker. "The bear
market started long before Sept. 11, and for very good reasons."</TE>
<TE>   Some Wall Street pros argue that the market might have suffered a
worse decline had the attacks never occurred. They note that stocks
had been plummeting in August and early September 2001 on worries
that the economy's recession was deepening.</TE>
<TE>   The attacks assured that Uncle Sam, and central banks worldwide,
would quickly "open all the faucets" to keep the global economy
afloat, said Ned Riley, investment strategist at State Street Global
Advisors in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   The economy, and the stock market, also may have been helped in
the immediate aftermath of the attacks by the wave of patriotism that
swept the nation. As markets reopened the week of Sept. 17, the
Internet buzzed with e-mails from small investors urging each other
to buy stocks, not sell them. To sell was to play into the
terrorists' hands, many said.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, the fact that consumer spending did not collapse in the
fourth quarter may owe at least in part to Americans' sense that
staying home, with wallets closed, would have aided the enemy.</TE>
<TE>   But if the fear factor related to terrorism has hurt stocks less
than investors might have imagined--perhaps because that fear has
hurt the economy less than expected--it is clear that more people are
placing a higher premium on safety of principal.</TE>
<TE>   That is why the price of gold is up 17.5% since Sept. 10, why the
sum in safe but boring bank savings accounts has mushroomed, and why
yields on Treasury securities have fallen to 40-year lows.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, many investors have substantially lowered their
expectations for portfolio returns in the near term. A monthly survey
of investors by brokerage UBS and the Gallup Organization showed
that, in August, the average expected return over the next 12 months
was 7.4%, the lowest since the survey began in June 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Stock market bulls take heart from those lowered expectations: If
investors aren't expecting much from equities, there is a greater
chance that they'll be pleasantly surprised, which in turn could
attract more money to stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Barton Biggs, veteran investment strategist at Morgan Stanley in
New York, recently put it this way in a note to clients: "After a big
decline, the news doesn't have to be good for the stock market to
rise. It just has to be less bad than what has already been
discounted."</TE>
<TE>   But the issue of how much has been discounted in stock
prices--that is, how much potential disappointment and turmoil
already is reflected in the market's current level--is the great
unknown. Times are always uncertain, of course, but the uncertainties
today loom very large indeed.</TE>
<TE>   For example, do share prices already reflect the possibility that
the Bush administration will decide to go to war with Iraq?</TE>
<TE>   What effect would another devastating terrorist attack on U.S.
soil have on investors' willingness to hold stock, or buy more? (To
own stock, after all, requires confidence in the future.)</TE>
<TE>   Will there be a ceiling on stock prices for years to come because
of the now-ingrained fear of terrorism? How low is that ceiling?</TE>
<TE>   To give the bulls their due, absent a new war or another attack
it's also reasonable to ask whether the market, still near five-year
lows, is priced more for the possibility of a weak economy and less
for the possibility of decent growth in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   And how many points might the Dow rise in one day if it were
announced that Osama bin Laden had been captured?</TE>
<TE>   There are many smart people on Wall Street who believe stock
prices should be lower overall to reflect the myriad risks faced by
the economy and the markets.</TE>
<TE>   One is Bill Gross of Pacific Investment Management Co. in Newport
Beach. As one of the world's best-known bond investors, Gross
arguably has an ax to grind for bonds and a reason to dislike stocks.
In his latest note to clients, he slams the equity market.</TE>
<TE>   "Stocks stink and will continue to do so until they're priced
appropriately," he said. What's appropriate? Gross said the Dow could
fall as low as 5,000 before the market would provide genuine value.</TE>
<TE>   Gross' take isn't shared by Gipson. He views the market as
"somewhat reasonably valued" now. "We're finally starting to see
cheap stocks to buy," he said.</TE>
<TE>   For the individual investor, the "correct" reaction to Sept. 11
and the new realities it ushered in may have nothing to do with
guessing the investments that will perform best from now on. It has
everything to do with choosing an investment mix that allows you to
sleep well at night.</TE>

<LD>United Airlines Hires</LD>
<LD>   Another New Chief</LD>
<LD>   United Airlines chose oil industry veteran Glenn Tilton to be its
third chairman and chief executive in less than a year.</LD>
<TE>   Tilton, formerly vice chairman of ChevronTexaco Corp., immediately
met with leaders of United's powerful unions to start negotiations on
concessions that the airline, a unit of UAL Corp., needs to head off
a looming cash shortage.</TE>
<TE>   The unions said they would work with Tilton and are preparing a
recovery plan of their own that includes wage cuts. But some analysts
said United, the nation's second-largest carrier behind AMR Corp.'s
American Airlines, is running out of time and still could be forced
into filing for bankruptcy reorganization. That probably would wipe
out the value of UAL's stock, which is 55%-owned by most of United's
84,000 employees.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Stock Market on</TE>
<TE>   Roller-Coaster Ride</TE>
<TE>   Stocks zigzagged last week as economic news, worries about war
with Iraq and the upcoming anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks weighed on investors.</TE>
<TE>   The market rose two days and fell two days of the
holiday-shortened week, but ultimately could not overcome Tuesday's
violent sell-off, which carved more than 4% off the Dow Jones
industrial average.</TE>
<TE>   But the week did end on a positive note, when an unexpectedly
strong employment report sparked a broad rally Friday and fanned
hopes that the U.S. economy may be showing signs of strength.</TE>
<TE>   For the week, the Dow finished off 2.7%, while the Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 index and the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index fell
2.4% and 1.5%, respectively. It was the second losing week in a row
for the major indexes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   August Jobless Rate</TE>
<TE>   Declines to 5.7%</TE>
<TE>   The nation's unemployment rate unexpectedly fell to 5.7% in August
as health-care companies, contractors, temporary help agencies and
the government expanded their payrolls.</TE>
<TE>   The decline from July's 5.9% rate and the hiring of an extra
39,000 workers during the month heartened investors, who had expected
a jump in joblessness. But the report suggested anew that the economy
is headed for another "jobless" recovery like that of the early
1990s, when it took more than two years after the recession ended for
employment to improve.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Congress Steps Up</TE>
<TE>   Probe of '90s IPOs</TE>
<TE>   Congress intensified its investigation of Wall Street's conduct in
the late-'90s bull market and asked two more investment banks for
information about their research analysts and new-stock offerings.</TE>
<TE>   The House Financial Services Committee sent letters to Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. and Credit Suisse First Boston. The committee is
seeking details about the brokerage firms' business dealings with
more than two dozen companies, including information on allocations
of initial public stock offerings to company executives.</TE>
<TE>   The committee asked for the data by Sept. 19 and said it may issue
subpoenas if the brokerage firms do not fully comply.</TE>
<TE>   The requests grew out of the committee's investigation of
Citigroup Inc.'s Salomon Smith Barney and its allocation of
sought-after IPO shares to top management of WorldCom Inc.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Health-Insurance Costs</TE>
<TE>   for Workers Jump</TE>
<TE>   Workers' health-insurance costs surged 27% this year for
individuals and 16% for families, at the same time many employees saw
their benefits reduced, according to a study by the Kaiser Family
Foundation and the Health Research and Educational Trust.</TE>
<TE>   The average premium increase for employers was 13%--the highest
since 1990--and marked the second straight year of double-digit
inflation, the study said.</TE>
<TE>   The survey and separate interviews indicate no letup in premium
increases in the foreseeable future. A sobering 78% of the more than
2,000 small and large businesses that responded to the survey said
they probably would increase the amount their workers must pay for
health coverage next year.</TE>
<TE>   If trends continue, the study's authors said, some businesses will
stop offering health benefits, and some low-income wage earners will
decline coverage because they will no longer be able to afford their
share of the costs.</TE>
<TE>   The increase was driven largely by larger insurance claims
stemming from higher prices for hospital services and prescription
drugs and consumers' growing demand for health care.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dockworkers, Shipping</TE>
<TE>   Lines Continue Talks</TE>
<TE>   West Coast dockworkers and shipping lines continued contract talks
after a brief halt in negotiations that had heightened concerns about
a possible disruption at the ports.</TE>
<TE>   Bargaining subcommittees devoted to issues such as benefits and
safety resumed discussions after a tense Labor Day weekend standoff
in which talks broke down and the long-extended labor pact expired.</TE>
<TE>   The International Longshore and Warehouse Union had accused the
management group of sabotaging negotiations by trying to make a
tentative agreement on health care contingent upon a deal on
arbitration--a charge the management group denied.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Low-Emission Gasoline</TE>
<TE>   Engines Backed by Study</TE>
<TE>   Researchers at UC Riverside have found that new low-emission
vehicles with gasoline engines are as clean as gas-electric hybrids
and can meet or beat the state's strictest emissions standards.</TE>
<TE>   The findings were welcomed by auto makers, which have invested
billions of dollars in internal-combustion engine development.
Environmental groups have been fighting for years for a replacement
for the conventional auto engine.</TE>
<TE>   The university's preliminary findings are based on two years of
study of a few low-emission vehicles using California's
cleaner-burning gasoline. The program, funded by a small group of
government agencies and auto and fuel industry companies, will wrap
up over the next year with a broader study using a variety of cars
and light trucks with low-emission, ultra-low-emission and
super-ultra-low-emission vehicle ratings.</TE>

<TE>   Napster to Liquidate</TE>
<TE>   After Sale Is Blocked</TE>
<TE>   Napster Inc., the song-swapping service that became the
fastest-growing business in history while alarming the entertainment
industry, said it plans to liquidate after a bankruptcy judge blocked
the sale of its technology to Bertelsmann.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Peter Walsh agreed with record labels and music publishers
that complained that the German publishing giant was too close to its
former employee, Napster Chief Executive Konrad Hilbers, when it
negotiated the sale.</TE>
<TE>   Napster plans to convert the Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization
it filed in June to a Chapter 7 liquidation, keeping only its chief
financial officer and one or two workers. Dozens were fired last
week, including founder Shawn Fanning, and Hilbers resigned.</TE>
<TE>   The Web site that had drawn tens of millions of visitors read
only: "Napster was here."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Glendale Galleria</TE>
<TE>   Is Put on the Market</TE>
<TE>   The owners of the Glendale Galleria have put the giant shopping
mall up for sale, and industry observers say the strong demand for
such properties should attract a long line of bidders.</TE>
<TE>   The mall is expected to sell for more than $400 million.</TE>
<TE>   Institutional investors and some of the nation's largest mall
operators, including Santa Monica-based Macerich Co. and Westfield
America Inc. of Los Angeles, are among the likely bidders for the
250-store mall, according to real estate brokers and retail
specialists.</TE>
<TE>   The 26-year-old mall is owned by a joint venture that includes
health insurer Cigna Corp. and the New York State Teachers'
Retirement System.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel Signs</TE>
<TE>   Pacts With Promoters</TE>
<TE>   Radio conglomerate Clear Channel Communications Inc. has notified
record labels that it has signed pacts with three independent music
promoters and granted them the exclusive right to pitch songs to
Clear Channel program directors at its top black music, or "urban,"
radio stations.</TE>
<TE>   Those promoters, in turn, have significantly raised the prices
they charge record labels for new songs added to a station's weekly
playlist.</TE>
<TE>   The sudden price increases appear to contradict statements by
Clear Channel Chief Executive Mark Mays, who has admonished music
executives for wasting money on independent promotion.</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel says it has no control over the prices promoters
charge--and receives no percentage of their per-song rates. The
broadcast chain earns its money in the form of annual fees by
charging music promoters $100,000 or more at each station for the
exclusive right to pitch songs at its black music stations.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Truck Firm Consolidated</TE>
<TE>   to Liquidate Business</TE>
<TE>   Consolidated Freightways Corp., one of the nation's largest
trucking firms, shut down its U.S. operations and moved to liquidate
the business.</TE>
<TE>   The 73-year-old company, noting that it could not secure needed
financing, said the action would put 15,500 people out of work, 80%
of them right away.</TE>
<TE>   Consolidated Freightways filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection, along with filing a quarterly financial statement that it
had delayed. Although a Chapter 11 filing is normally used to
reorganize debt and continue operating, a company representative said
it would allow management to dispose of the business more quickly.</TE>

<TE>   Warner Production Chief</TE>
<TE>   Resigns Unexpectedly</TE>
<TE>   Two months after getting a major promotion, the top film
production executive at Warner Bros. resigned abruptly to become a
producer at the studio, a unit of AOL Time Warner Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Lorenzo di Bonaventura periodically had clashed with Warner
President Alan Horn over budgets and choosing movies during the three
years they worked together. They frequently had icy relations,
although Warner executives insisted that the two were able to develop
a working relationship.</TE>
<TE>   Di Bonaventura laid the blame on the corporate nature of his job
as executive vice president, worldwide motion pictures, the post to
which he was promoted in July.</TE>

<HD>Remnants of Afghan Wars Offer Potential</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SHOMALI PLAIN, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Driving through this once-verdant farm area ruined by decades of
warfare, Shreeram Lakshman's eyes rest on the wreckage of a T-54
Soviet tank, one of dozens that litter the countryside.</LD>
<LD>   "That's nice stuff. That will melt down really well," the Indian
businessman said of the rusting hulk resting along a collapsed bridge
in a dried-up irrigation canal. Beyond it lie dozens of ruined and
abandoned mud-brick houses.</LD>
<LD>   Lakshman wants to beat swords into plowshares--melt down the
thousands of abandoned tanks, armored vehicles and artillery pieces
that blanket Afghanistan to make the steel rods, beams and sheets
that could be the building blocks for this devastated nation's
reconstruction.</LD>
<TE>   The abandoned armor testifies to the billions of dollars the
Soviets poured into their occupation of Afghanistan during the 1980s.
But to Lakshman, the wrecks are the stuff of Afghanistan's recovery.</TE>
<TE>   Despite bureaucratic disarray and a near total lack of
infrastructure, not to mention this country's highly unsettled
future, hundreds of entrepreneurs such as Lakshman are looking for
opportunities in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   But the obstacles of doing business in a land with no formal
banking system, no reliable telephone system, an inchoate legal
structure and fledgling government are immense. The assassination
attempt on President Hamid Karzai and fatal bombings in downtown
Kabul last week also underscore the precariousness of Afghanistan's
future.</TE>
<TE>   All this presents plenty of opportunities for Lakshman's venture
to fail, and odds are it will. He admits that the project is a
longshot.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no road map here," Lakshman said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Finding Opportunities</TE>
<TE>   But that isn't stopping entrepreneurs from exploring business
opportunities in Afghanistan for the short and long term. The
government talks of untapped deposits of minerals such as coal and
copper and is trying to interest foreign companies in developing its
oil and gas fields.</TE>
<TE>   Lakshman heads the Afghan office of the Trade Group Confederation
of Indian Industry. His job is to look for opportunities for its
members, many of whom seem undeterred from investing in Afghanistan
despite its problems. Like entrepreneurs the world over, they want to
be in on the ground floor of what could be the next lucrative
business opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   One interested Indian businessman is Ashok Goyal, who is mulling
over a $1-million investment in a smelter--which would be
Afghanistan's first--to be built in an industrial park in Kabul, the
capital.</TE>
<TE>   The operation he envisions would use only about 35% of the metal
in a typical heavy tank; the rest is too thick for the proposed
smelter and would have to be sold to steel mills in Russia or
Ukraine.</TE>
<TE>   Goyal is not the first to see a profit in Afghan war junk. During
the chaos of the early 1990s, after the Soviets withdrew and
Afghanistan was racked by civil war, most of the country's easily
transportable iron waste was taken to Pakistan and Iran and sold as
scrap. What is left is heavier and more difficult to dispose of.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Demand for Steel</TE>
<TE>   Goyal said his project would employ 200 people and sell into a
market crying out for domestically produced steel.</TE>
<TE>   "All of Afghanistan's steel is brought in from other places, and
it's very expensive to transport it," Goyal said, adding that the
poor road system increases the costs of delivery.</TE>
<TE>   Afghanistan also was systematically plundered of factory machines,
high-tension wires, metal light poles and roofing--anything that
could be picked up and rolled away.</TE>
<TE>   The looting of industrial machinery and infrastructure, on top of
myriad other calamities suffered over the years, has left
Afghanistan's economy in desperate shape.</TE>
<TE>   "It's as bad as Dresden in 1945," said one U.S. official who asked
not to be identified. Total annual economic output is about $5
billion, one-third that of impoverished Ecuador, although it has
nearly 2 1/2 times the land mass and twice the population of Ecuador.</TE>
<TE>   The United States, the European Union and the World Bank soon will
unveil a massive road-building plan to boost the government of
President Hamid Karzai and make transporting goods more efficient.
Completion of any major road projects, however, is at least two years
away.</TE>
<TE>   "Although industrial policy is not fully realized in Afghanistan,
there is a lot of potential," Goyal said.</TE>
<TE>   The country has never had a steel industry, but Lakshman and Goyal
want to change that. The demand for recycled steel is high. The
country's reconstruction will need reinforcing steel rods and beams
for rebuilding ruined housing, schools, hospitals and office
buildings.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of Tanks</TE>
<TE>   There is enough material to supply the Indians' planned smelter
for several years. The Defense Ministry estimates that 8,000 Soviet
tanks and armored personnel carriers are rusting along the roadways,
valleys and mountain passes, successively used and then abandoned by
the Soviets, Afghan civil warriors and Taliban army over the last two
decades.</TE>
<TE>   And when the tanks run out, there would still be plenty of
abandoned cars, planes and cargo containers to keep the smelter in
business.</TE>
<TE>   The smelter would buy the wrecks from the Defense Ministry, which
claims ownership but has established no clear policy about how to
dispose of them. "It's not something we have put any focus on yet,"
ministry spokesman Meer Jan said.</TE>
<TE>   Although some villages are using tanks stacked ingeniously to prop
up damaged bridges or to channel river water, many Afghans would be
glad to see the hulks cleared from the highways.</TE>
<TE>   "People shouldn't have to see them anymore, because during the war
many people's close friends and loved ones were martyred, and the
wrecks only remind them of that," said Padshah, 30, a Kabul resident
whose mother and eight siblings were ordered off their small Shomali
Valley farm by the Taliban five years ago. "They should be collected
and made into something useful."</TE>
<TE>   That's what Lakshman and Goyal would like to do. On his tour of
this valley where war wreckage has replaced pastures and vineyards,
Lakshman saw steel waiting to be harvested and recycled--large
amounts of it, there for the taking.</TE>
<TE>   "To just let it rust there is really sad," Lakshman said after
turning east into the armor-strewn Panjshir Valley, where the Soviets
lost hundreds of tanks in a single 1982 battle.</TE>
<TE>   Whereas the Soviet junk armor lures Lakshman, it's a source of
puzzlement to others, who don't know why the Soviets left so much
behind when they withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   "It is odd. In East Germany and parts of the Baltic states, when
the Russians withdrew, they were known to take everything--I mean
everything, including the toilets; and what they didn't take, they
destroyed," said Sarah Mendelson, a Russia scholar at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a military ... in disintegration. Is it possible that no
one gave any explicit orders?" she said.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of why it's there, the abandoned war machinery is
drawing other foreign entrepreneurs who have the same idea as
Lakshman and Goyal.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese executives from Shanghai have formed the Sino-Afghan Steel
Co. to build a smelter in Kabul, and Afghan American steel executive
Temoor Sidiqi, who emigrated in 1970 with his family, is trying to
form a consortium to build a $200-million project that would start
operations as a smelter but evolve into a full-fledged steel mill
using iron ore from untapped mines in Bamiyan province.</TE>
<TE>   Sidiqi talks of vast untapped--and unproven--deposits not just of
iron but of copper, gold, fertilizer and coal.</TE>
<TE>   "Just like other countries in the Mideast are big energy
suppliers, I see Afghanistan developing as the region's main minerals
supplier," said Sidiqi, whose Pittsburgh-based company, Forsarca
Inc., sells management software to steel mills.</TE>
<TE>   But this nation's mineral reserves haven't been accurately
surveyed for a quarter of a century. With the country's database and
geological laboratory and its instruments in ruins, the nation has
turned to the U.S. Geological Survey for help in sizing up its
potential minerals as well as gas and petroleum reserves.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Boosting Interest</TE>
<TE>   The government is trying to get oil companies interested in
developing oil and gas fields in the northern part of the country and
building a pipeline to Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   Like mining projects, pipelines would cost a fortune to complete
and investors are likely to wait until the political situation
settles down before making such a big move.</TE>
<TE>   Afghan officials say Washington already has agreed to help with
the mineral survey, but U.S. officials say they still are considering
it.</TE>
<TE>   "We can build the economy of the country with natural resources, I
have no doubt about it," said Mohammad Sadiq, the Afghan Mining and
Industry Ministry's acting head of planning and chief of the
geological survey. "We have almost every element on the periodic
table."</TE>
<TE>   But a full-fledged mining project may take years to get off the
ground. The prerequisite geological survey is many months, if not
years, from completion and the unsettled political situation is sure
to make mining companies hesitant to invest.</TE>
<TE>   Lakshman and Goyal say their project could be functioning in less
than a year.</TE>
<TE>   "With everything broken down here, we want to revive it," Lakshman
said. "A smelter could be good business. And you have raw material in
your own backyard, all over the country."</TE>

<LD>Re "Who Are All You People Who Support a War Against Iraq?" Sept. 4:
Steve Lopez is the proverbial voice in the wilderness. I too have
been mystified by the polls showing a majority of Americans favoring
a ground war against Iraq. While I agree that Saddam Hussein is
dangerous and needs to go, I think we can take care of him later.</LD>
<LD>   I am of the conviction that the United States' considerable
influence and power need to be focused on resolving the conflict
between Israel and the Palestinians. The U.S. and the rest of the
world, for that matter, are not going to find peace or peace of mind
until that conflict is solved. It appears that this administration
finds it much easier to threaten war rather than tackle the difficult
task of forging a peace in Palestine.</LD>
<LD>   If the Toxic Texan wants to redeem his tattered reputation (not to
mention that of the United States), then the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict might be a good place to start.</LD>

superpatriots are already talking about all their alternatives if the
penalties of the fight against terrorism threaten to dent their
profit margins (shipping to Canadian ports, ignoring now-voluntary
industry security improvements, etc.). Next will be a Big Business
rush to incorporate offshore while claiming the businesses are not
subject to United States security rules.</TE>

<TE>   Containment of the Soviet Union was successful in avoiding war
over a 40-year period and was instrumental in the ultimate demise of
that regime. The Bush administration is going all out to make the
case why war with Iraq is a necessity. Many Americans, and much of
the world, will want the more basic question answered: why
containment won't work against Iraq when it did against a foreign
adversary with many times more destructive power than Hussein will
ever possess.</TE>

<HD>Norfolk Island's Message in a Bottle</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Norfolk Island truly sounds like a South Seas paradise, despite the
first murder there in 149 years that landed the small Australian
dependency on your front page ("An Island Full of Suspects," Aug.
30). I applaud the Norfolk Islanders for choosing not to allow cell
phones, on the grounds that their use is antisocial. Equally
antisocial, in a larger sense, is the Norfolk Island practice,
according to your article, of dumping all its trash, including old
cars, from a cliff into the Pacific Ocean.</LD>
<LD>   As someone who shares the same ocean, I don't want to meet up one
day with some Norfolk Island garbage washing up in Santa Monica Bay.
Surely the Canberra government, responsible for the island's external
affairs, could set up a small dump on the island and monthly barge
service to ship the trash for environmentally prudent processing on
the Australian mainland.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>While my slow-driving grandmother may be pleased with Senate Bill
807, all we have found is a feel-good way to pass on the cost of
emergency health care from the elderly to the young, and from the
wealthy to the poor ("A Messy Miracle for the ER," editorial, Sept.
4). Even if we choose to ignore studies showing that minorities may
be more frequently stopped by police for traffic offenses, paying for
our crisis care through a sin tax only shifts our health cost burden
on those who can least afford it.</LD>
<LD>   Tacking on an extra $200 to a traffic fine hits those who make
$20,000 a year far harder than those making $200,000.</LD>
<LD>   We need to accept the costs that come with our health-care system
and pay for them fairly through a proportional tax, not applaud
easy-fix sin taxes that leave poor and working-class Californians
footing more than their fair share of the bill.</LD>

<HD>It Takes a Community to Stop Gang Violence</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I could not disagree more with your Sept. 3 editorial on standing up
to street gangs. Given the disastrous and continuing effects of the
LAPD's Rampart Division scandal, how can a new police chief be
expected to fully "serve and protect a single city" when the
department is facing disarray, decimation and poor morale? Let's be
pragmatic and put the focus on healing the department and making it
the premier police organization in the country. Then and only then
will any chief have a chance of uniting the city and ending the
shootings. Any other course could only be viewed as hypocrisy.</LD>
<TE>   The citizens of Los Angeles have tolerated street gangs and even
gang killings for many years. White Fence and Maravilla gangs have
existed since before the end of World War II and have been the
incubator of a dozen other gangs that still exist, both in and out of
prison. Where is the evidence of citizen outrage and resistance?
Nobody blinked an eye when Raymond Washington and Stanley Williams
started a gang over 30 years ago that would become the Crips. The
community did nothing to crush this menace while in its infancy and
little while it was in its prime. The most violent and geographically
expanding of all Los Angeles gangs, 18th Street, was established and
flourishes to this day in a neighborhood known as Rampart. Where are
the solid citizens when 18th Street is recruiting and dominating
their children?</TE>
<TE>   So, you see, it's up to both the community and the LAPD. The good
guys must unify and take a stand. The LAPD must get its own house in
order and then lead and inspire by shining example.</TE>
<TE>   Douglas Hughes</TE>
<TE>   Glendale</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It will take more than a new police chief to stop gang violence.
We need reliable child care for working parents, credentialed
teachers in every classroom, after-school programs for teens, job
training programs and appropriate jobs for young adults, gun
registration, an adequate minimum wage and fewer liquor licenses
approved in inner-city neighborhoods to realistically begin to stop
gang violence.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Your illuminating feature on Berkeley High School did indeed document
the very difficult problems inherent in attempting to raise minority
scores to the levels of those of Anglo and Asian students ("Top-Notch
School Fails to Close 'Achievement Gap,' " Sept. 4). That's the bad
news. But an equally strong and positive message is given only
passing mention in the middle of the article--the success story that
55% of black seniors at Berkeley qualify for the UC system, compared
with 26% statewide. And, similarly, 50% of Berkeley Latinos,
compared, again, with 22% statewide. That's astounding! It certainly
validates the efforts of minority East Bay families to get their
children enrolled at Berkeley High. Yet this achievement is virtually
lost in the article's focus on the ethnic gap.</LD>
<LD>   Credit should be given for Berkeley's efforts, which created a
rising tide elevating the minority boats to twice the level found in
California high schools generally. Yes, it lifted the Anglo and Asian
boats much higher, and that represents a challenge worthy of
sustained attention. But the gap isn't the whole story and should not
diminish the achievement noted.</LD>

<TE>   By the time students reach high school it's too late to address
the disparity in achievement among students. The deficits that
disadvantaged students bring to the classroom cannot be corrected in
four years. Teachers are not miracle workers. Early intervention
beginning in pre-kindergarten can help, but nothing can take the
place of a home where parents are involved in and knowledgeable about
their children's education.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, too many students at Berkeley High and elsewhere
come from backgrounds devoid of this support. Teachers must then
spend a disproportionate amount of time on nonacademic matters. It's
a question of educational triage, and it's practiced on a daily basis
in schools serving poor and minority students.</TE>
<TE>   Walt Gardner</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Your article further highlights the importance of the commitment
of the home in the education of children. Too often have I
encountered students whose homes not only do not contain a dictionary
or a quiet place for homework but whose parents are unable to assist
in basic math or interpreting simple written instructions. If there
is to be any progress in closing this tragic socioeconomic education
gap, at-risk students must be identified by the first grade.</TE>
<TE>   Both during-and after-school centers are vitally needed to provide
these youngsters with nearly one-on-one assistance in developing
basic skills and completing homework assignments. This, of course, is
a surrogate for what normally takes place in the homes of reasonably
educated parents. Much of this effort could be accomplished by
volunteers as well as high school students who are completing
community service requirements. Expecting any high school to repair
eight or nine prior years of failure is flagrantly unrealistic.</TE>

<HD>Global Tariff Reductions for Agricultural Exports</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Your Aug. 19 editorial "Protectionism's Blowback" correctly
identifies the pursuit of the Free Trade Area of the Americas as a
major regional trade and economic development priority for the Bush
administration. But in calling for the administration to consider
"confidence-building moves in the region," the editorial omitted
mentioning the new U.S. agricultural proposal.</LD>
<LD>   In late July, the administration offered an ambitious proposal to
reduce global tariffs from an average of 62% to 15%, slash global
trade-distorting domestic subsidies by $100 billion a year and
eliminate export subsidies.</LD>
<LD>   Our proposal has garnered broad support from American agricultural
groups and from countries ranging from Australia to Sri Lanka and
Bolivia. In order to keep American markets open, we must work within

<LD>I applaud actress Doris Roberts for speaking up for us "helpless,
unproductive" seniors ("Ageism in the Media Is Seen as Harmful to
Health of the Elderly," Sept. 5). At 72, I still work part time,
volunteer at a hospital weekly, take classes at Valley College twice
a week, read two newspapers a day and keep up with as much theater as
I can. I travel to New York twice a year and just returned from
Chicago, where I caught up with the Steppenwolf Theatre.</LD>
<LD>   Heck, I even had a new 82-year-old boyfriend. So don't tell us
seniors we are helpless and irrelevant. We're still active, sexual
and swinging.</LD>

<HD>Ask Yourself--Is This the Hall of Fame for Me?</HD>
<DH>Honors* With so many institutions enshrining their
immortals, you're bound to get into one of them. Maybe you're a swell
airplane sleeper?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Andy Warhol was close but wrong. It's not a mere 15 minutes that
awaits us, but an entire hall of fame.</LD>
<LD>   Ages ago, when pride still mattered, enshrinement meant you
actually had to do something important like kick, catch, throw, hit
or pass a ball. The ability to punch someone in the nose effectively
also wouldn't hurt your chances. But these days, with more than 200
halls in existence and more on the way, the criteria for
immortalization have broadened considerably.</LD>
<LD>   * The Accounting Hall of Fame (One of several, but this one is
sponsored by the Fisher College of Business at Ohio State University.
Arthur Andersen is an inductee.)</LD>
<TE>   * The International Polka Hall of Fame (Don't dare call it
national).</TE>
<TE>   * The National Women's Hall of Fame. (Janet Reno, Rosalynn Carter
are in. Nancy Reagan still waiting.)</TE>
<TE>   * The Alabama Music Hall of Fame. (It's a small building.)</TE>
<TE>   * The Canadian Science and Engineering Hall of Fame. (It's even
smaller.)</TE>
<TE>   * The Scottish Preachers' Hall of Fame. (Heaven isn't enough?)</TE>
<TE>   And you don't even have to be human to spend eternity in a hall of
fame. Ukuleles, Frisbees, cockroaches, real estate agents, they all
have their respective halls.</TE>
<TE>   Stiffer types may see the proliferation as bad. That is, the very
existence of so many houses dedicated to preserving renown turns the
whole concept of recognizing achievement into "a pathetically, sad
cultural joke of the first order." Moreover, such an overabundance
further cheapens and trivializes lifetime accomplishment and,
frankly, is yet another signal of the imminent collapse of Western
civilization.</TE>
<TE>   OK, maybe all that's true. But what can we really do about it?
Let's be honest: not much. So I say, when the hall of famers
recruiters come knocking on your door, as they inevitably will, be
prepared--or your bronze bust may spend eternity in the wrong hall.</TE>
<TE>   To avoid that, you must embark on a fearless inventory of your
talents. Think outside the box. In fact, maybe you're a colossal
out-of-the-box thinker and that's your ticket to a hall of fame. Or
maybe you're the consummate in-the-box thinker. Or maybe you couldn't
think your way out of a brown paper bag but are a regular Einstein
with the remote. Whatever it is, you can bet there's a hall of fame
already built or in the works.</TE>
<TE>   Some of you might have already noticed a potential conflict. What
if you're an Einstein with the remote and a consummate in-the-box
thinker, then which hall of fame should you choose? Though this may
be a question for a colossal out-of-the-box thinker, some sound
advice is to avoid any hall that courts your patronage with a trip to
a restaurant that offers "super-sizes." Also, scratch any hall off
your list that requires your death before entrance. All other factors
being equal, however, always choose the hall that allows for the most
natural light. Visitors go gaga for natural light.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, once you've committed to a particular hall of fame,
this is no time to bask in the glory and let your brain turn to mush.
There will be plenty of time for that later. First, make certain you
obtain an exit clause.</TE>
<TE>   Let's say you're in the Can Sleep on an Airplane Hall of Fame.
That's your skill, that's what you do, that's who you are. But then a
few months later, the Gasbag Hall of Fame opens up down the street.
And being a gasbag is really your skill, really what you do, and
really who you are. If you don't have an exit clause, you're in a
world of hurt.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, what if the Gasbags haven't broken ground on their
edifice yet and you're still in Can Sleep on an Airplane and some
Johnny-come-lately rolls into the hall and grabs all the attention?
You're not the flavor of the month anymore. You pretend it doesn't
bother you. You pretend it doesn't hurt, but it does. Well, unless
you've got an exit clause, your "threats" to leave will only cause
the board of directors to choke on their laughter.</TE>
<TE>   I guess there's a lot Andy didn't know about fame.</TE>

<LD>* My favorite dinosaur is velociraptor. It had a large brain,
powerful hind legs, clawed hands, sharp teeth and was a carnivore. In
fact, it was the most popular and terrifying dinosaur in the movie
"Jurassic Park." I like the velociraptor because it was the smartest
dinosaur. I have drawn a picture of a velociraptor attacking an
euoplocephalus.</LD>

<TE>   * My favorite dinosaur is brachiosaurus. It had a bump on its head
so it could breathe under water to get away from Tyrannosaurus rex.
Brachiosaurus is my favorite dinosaur because if I were a dinosaur, I
would like to be it because there was lots of water around that it
could go into to get away from its enemies.</TE>

<TE>   When the sunset occurs, the sky becomes darker and darker and the

<TE>   Other planets have many moons. Earth has one. Our moon is close to
Earth. That's why it looks big and bright.</TE>
<TE>   The distance between Earth and the moon is about 238,900 miles.
The moon has no light of its own and is about one quarter the size of
Earth.</TE>
<TE>   The moon is Earth's only natural satellite. It travels around
Earth and takes one month for a complete tour. It is made up of rocks
and dust, has no air and no life.</TE>
<TE>   The moon has different shapes, called "phases." The phases are:
new, crescent, first quarter, gibbous and full. Moon's gravity
affects our oceans because it is strong enough to cause tides.</TE>

<DH>Malibu's courthouse sees its share of cases involving
high-profile high jinks</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At the Malibu Courthouse, they are known as "Goldilocks" cases.</LD>
<LD>   A man or woman scales the wall of a beach-or cliff-side mansion.
Strolling into the house, the trespasser mixes up a stiff cocktail.
Takes a dip in the pool. Maybe even slips between the sheets for a
wee nap.</LD>
<LD>   When caught, these intruders tell startled owners or police in
perfectly lucid tones that they live there. That the owner invited
them in. Or that they just wanted to look around.</LD>
<TE>   Consider the man who broke into a famous Malibu landmark called
"The Castle," built by its eccentric owner to resemble a real
fortress.</TE>
<TE>   "He said it was his castle," Commissioner Terry Adamson at the
Malibu Courthouse says dryly, "and that he got it as a reward for
balancing the national budget. I feel sorry for them. I'm empathetic.
On the other hand, it's a potentially dangerous situation because
they can act on their delusion."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed. Earlier this year, a man who falsely told a judge he was
married to actress Meg Ryan broke into a Malibu home he believed
belonged to the actress. A female fan has repeatedly tried to break
into Axl Rose's Malibu estate, claiming she was married to the Guns
N' Roses rocker. Both were quickly apprehended.</TE>
<TE>   "There aren't a lot of exits here," says Adamson, who has spent 13
years on the bench in the Malibu courthouse. "We've got the highway
and the canyon. If people are going to commit crimes here, they'd
better think twice."</TE>
<TE>   But if Malibu is a small, geographically isolated town, it is also
a world-renowned haven for the rich and famous. Barbra Streisand,
David Geffen, Cher, Courtney Love and Madonna are just a handful of
celebrities who have called Malibu home.</TE>
<TE>   These residents can't help but inject the small town with a
tabloid-ready flavor that is more reminiscent of Tinseltown than
Mayberry. For starters, there are the misbehaviors of fans drawn to
stars. Then there are the high-profile high jinks of the celebrities
themselves. Finally, and much more common, are the crimes of
lesser-known residents and those who are just passing through the
rugged hillsides or 27 miles of oceanfront.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever their transgressions, those who commit crimes are
processed through the Malibu courthouse, whose modest, low-slung
exterior gives no hint of the celebrities, playwrights, millionaires,
moguls, CEOs and lesser mortals who prowl its halls.</TE>
<TE>   If their transgressions are misdemeanors, defendants usually go up
before Adamson. Felonies are handled by Los Angeles Superior Court
Judge Lawrence J. Mira, Malibu's presiding judge since 1987.</TE>
<TE>   Mira, whose jurisdiction encompasses 186 square miles of expensive
beachfront, rough canyon and dwindling farmland in Malibu, Topanga
Canyon, Calabasas, Hidden Hills and Agoura, is said to have the
best--and certainly one of the spiciest--judicial jobs around.</TE>
<TE>   It was Mira who sentenced a tearful and pleading Robert Downey Jr.
to three years in prison in 1999 for various drug and parole
violations.</TE>
<TE>   Unswayed by the Academy Award-nominated actor's promises, Mira
told Downey he was manipulative, had exhausted the court's drug
rehabilitation options and posed a threat to the public and himself.</TE>
<TE>   "Is there any question that if this defendant continues to use
drugs we're going to be reading his name in an obituary?" Mira said.
"We tried rehabilitation, and it simply hasn't worked."</TE>
<TE>   And how many judges got to congratulate rocker Tommy Lee on
reconciling with his pneumatic then-wife Pamela Anderson Lee after
serving jail time for hitting her?</TE>
<TE>   Mira did so in 1999. The judge also endeared himself to metal fans
around the world when he lifted a prohibition against Lee playing in
venues that sold alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   But the following year, Lee served five days in Los Angeles County
Jail for violating parole by drinking alcohol. Chided Mira: "[If you]
do not commit to sobriety, then you're going to come back to this
court, and it'll be a very unhappy experience for you."</TE>
<TE>   Mira wields carrots and sticks with equal vigor and must steep
himself in pop culture as part of the job. Often his legal
relationships with celebrities and their drug problems, sexcapades
and assaults unfold over years of court appearances.</TE>
<TE>   Consider the wrangles between Mira and onetime bad boy Charlie
Sheen, who first appeared before Mira in the late 1990s when he was
convicted of misdemeanor battery after attacking his then-girlfriend.
The actor popped up again before Mira when he violated his probation
by taking illegal drugs.</TE>
<TE>   But in March 2000, Mira agreed to terminate Sheen's probation 71
days early and wipe the misdemeanor battery conviction off his
record, saying that as Michael J. Fox's replacement on ABC's "Spin
City," Sheen had "a unique opportunity to be a role model" for youth.
"Everyone has their demons, and I believe you're winning the battle,
but you haven't won yet. Still, you've made an enormous turnaround in
your life and career. You don't need me anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps wisely, Mira declined to be interviewed for this article.
But Charles L. Lindner, past president of the Los Angeles Criminal
Bar Assn., avowed in The Times several years ago that Mira had "the
best judicial job in L.A. County" because he runs a one-judge
courthouse, lives in Malibu, knows many of the people who appear
before him and is his own presiding judge.</TE>
<TE>   Like Mira, Adamson, the courthouse commissioner, is a longtime
Malibu resident. Both are active in the community, raised children
here, teach at Pepperdine School of Law and speak regularly to school
and community groups, from Boy Scouts to Kiwanis.</TE>
<TE>   "Judge Mira and I are more in touch with the priorities of the
community because we live here. We love this community," Adamson
says.</TE>
<TE>   (By ironic contrast, none of the 29 courthouse employees lives in
Malibu. Many say they can't afford it.)</TE>
<TE>   But living where you judge can also lead to uncomfortable moments.
Retired Malibu Judge John J. Merrick, who presided over the
courthouse from 1964 to '86 and has lived in the community for most
of his life, says many acquaintances and neighbors came before him on
DUI charges over the years. How did he handle it?</TE>
<TE>   "I did my job and was always fair," he says with equanimity. (Ann
Madden, Malibu's trial court administrator, says that judicial
officers recuse themselves if friends, business partners or family
come before them.)</TE>
<TE>   Adamson, who processes up to 100 cases a day, recalls being out to
dinner with her family in Malibu when their waiter came up and
announced proudly that he was doing well on his probation.</TE>
<TE>   "It turns out that I sentenced him," said Adamson, who didn't
recall the defendant's face. "I told him, 'That's nice.' "</TE>
<TE>   Adamson also takes pains to point out that most Malibu cases don't
involve celebrities or even Malibu residents. Many defendants are
just passing through and get arrested for drinking on the beach,
drinking and driving, camping illegally or other vehicular
infractions.</TE>
<TE>   The court cracks down hard on these cases, since fires and car
crashes are big problems locally. Adamson says there is an auto
fatality almost every three-day weekend (though all was quiet this
Labor Day holiday). More than 100 people have died in the last decade
on the stretch of Pacific Coast Highway between Santa Monica and the
Ventura County line.</TE>
<TE>   But it's undeniable that some Malibu cases read like sleazy beach
thrillers, such as the 33-year-old woman charged in the fatal 1998
shooting of her aspiring actor boyfriend, whose body was found buried
behind their rented Topanga Canyon home. She was also charged with
marijuana cultivation and embezzling $800,000 from a Beverly Hills
printing company and a Malibu businessman and was alleged to have
spent the money making the high-society drug scene in Hawaii, London
and Amsterdam. (She's now serving a 40-years-to-life prison term.)</TE>
<TE>   Then there was the surfer charged, a couple of years ago, with
beating up an encroaching surfer over territory--the "Locals Only"
case in which the courthouse morphed into a Beach Boys setting,
complete with surfboards, diagrams of waves and blown-up photos of
the beach.</TE>
<TE>   Or the fellow who was arrested for repeatedly molesting horses and
was ordered by the court to keep away from Malibu's livestock.</TE>
<TE>   This keeps things lively for jurors, whose civic participation is
much higher than average for Los Angeles. At any given time, the jury
pool may include studio heads, CEOs, playwrights, doctors and
professors.</TE>
<TE>   "The jurors are smart and unusually educated," Adamson says. "And
they want the experience. Maybe they are affluent enough that they
can afford to take a week off work."</TE>
<TE>   But it's the celebrity names, of course, that provide most of the
glitter.</TE>
<TE>   "When Pamela Anderson came, she was a big draw," recalls Adamson,
who is quick to point out that the blond bombshell wasn't there as a
defendant but to support her then-husband, the misbehaving Tommy Lee.</TE>
<TE>   Some might wonder whether being well known affects a celebrity's
treatment in court. But the judicial officers insist that no bias
comes into play.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't treat them any differently than anyone else," Judge
Merrick said. "when they got into court they'd be represented by
counsel, who would do most of the speaking for them."</TE>
<TE>   "We don't put them on a pedestal, and we don't make an example of
them," Adamson adds. "Celebrities are treated like anybody else.
Besides, they're so common in Malibu."</TE>
<TE>   And here on their home turf, celebrities generally don't show up
in court with an entourage. Some bring a bodyguard or two. Many come
with only their lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   Madden recalls that Carroll O'Connor came in solo to conduct some
business.</TE>
<TE>   "He was so polite. He came to the office and popped his head in
and said he just wanted to say hello. It made my day."</TE>
<TE>   Madden admits she's a bit fuzzy on some of the younger stars. But
administrative assistant Misty Tisher lets her know when celebrities
are sitting out on the bench and explains what shows they have been
on.</TE>
<TE>   "Misty's our town crier," Madden says. "She spots them."</TE>
<TE>   "I have a pretty good eye," admits Tisher, who lives in Agoura.
"We usually recognize them, but we don't make a big deal about it."</TE>
<TE>   While Judge Mira may be bound by judicial restraint not to talk to
the press, his predecessor, Judge Merrick, entertained a reporter in
his Point Dume home for several hours one recent afternoon,
reminiscing about all the trouble he's seen.</TE>
<TE>   Merrick signed the search warrant to gain access to the infamous
Spahn Ranch and arrest Charles Manson. With 50 deputies guarding the
courtroom, he presided over the preliminary hearing of Manson family
member Susan Atkins, who was charged with the murder of Gary Hinman.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1960s, after police arrested a number of people at a
now-closed Topanga Canyon nudist club called Elysium, the deeply
religious Merrick, who attends Mass daily, ruled in their favor,
determining that the 30-year-old county ordinance under which they
had been charged was overly broad and unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   For this he was called a "pervert" and received hate mail, Merrick
says with a laugh. One Malibu woman wrote angrily that he was turning
Malibu into "Sodom and Gomorrah."</TE>
<TE>   But probably the biggest celebrity hurricane ever to hit Malibu
was the wedding of Sean Penn and Madonna in 1985. Merrick--who was a
friend of the groom's father, director Leo Penn, a longtime Malibu
resident--married the couple.</TE>
<TE>   He recalls that Madonna and her first husband-to-be came to his
home to discuss what they wanted to say in the nuptials. When a car
came to fetch him, Merrick still didn't know where he'd perform the
ceremony and was surprised to find himself at a Point Dume estate he
could have walked to.</TE>
<TE>   "They took me into the room and Sean was cussing and swearing, he
was so angry, because the paparazzi had found out and there was
already a helicopter circling overhead. They had seen a Spago
catering van driving up Pacific Coast Highway and figured all they
had to do was follow Wolfgang Puck."</TE>
<TE>   Merrick, who has lived in Malibu since 1946, when he bought a
beachfront lot for $2,300, recalls that in his early days as judge,
he'd drive over the canyon road to Calabasas to hear cases at a small
courthouse there, which doubled as a dance hall by night and has
since closed.</TE>
<TE>   Many other things have changed. The original 1916 one-room brick
courthouse on Pacific Coast Highway is now a historic site.
Originally Malibu was a circuit court--so called because judges would
ride a circuit from one remote courthouse to the next to hear cases.
According to a 1971 article in the defunct Santa Monica Evening
Outlook, Malibu was the second-busiest circuit court in the state,
with jury trials that went on into the wee hours of the night.</TE>
<TE>   "Adjourning at midnight is nothing strange; in fact last month the
jury cases concluded at 2 a.m.," the paper reported.</TE>
<TE>   The old brick building has given way to a sleek, modern courthouse
in the Malibu Civic Center. And Malibu was upgraded to a municipal
court in 1972 after the area it served hit 40,000 people and became a
superior court in 2000. The late-night sessions are long vanished.</TE>
<TE>   But there's still plenty of action at the Malibu courthouse, which
reflects the community it serves.</TE>
<TE>   Says Judge Merrick: "It's always been a kind of a playground."</TE>

<DH>Veteran puts aside Vietnam for a tale about boomers who had
to settle for less</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J. MICHAEL KENNEDY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>AUSTIN, Texas</DL>
<LD>Long ago, Tim O'Brien dreamed he would live on a golf course. And
here he is now, in a home perched beside the 18th green of the Onion
Creek Club, sitting pretty. His subdivision on the far outskirts of
Austin has streets named after golf courses like Pebble Beach and
Pinehurst. Swans ply the waters of a fairway pond just down the
street.</LD>
<LD>   The setting seems somehow incongruous, given the fact that O'Brien
is a novelist whose most noted work deals with the agony of the
Vietnam War and its aftermath. Yet as he is quick to point out, "some
things happen that you don't expect." In this case, the surprise was
an endowed chair for creative writing at Southwest Texas State
University in nearby San Marcos, which lured him away from the
colder, drearier climes of Boston three years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Now he is a man with a pool, which glittered in the bright morning
sun. O'Brien lighted one Carleton after another in his study as he
talked about writing, Vietnam and his soon-to-be-released novel,
"July, July" (Houghton Mifflin). The walls are filled with mementos
of his past literary triumphs, including the 1979 National Book Award
for "Going After Cacciato," a breakthrough novel that was a surprise
winner over John Irving's bestseller, "The World According to Garp."</LD>
<TE>   There are other telling items as well. A framed Harry Houdini
poster hints at O'Brien's love of magic and sleight of hand. A
black-and-white photo of a young O'Brien in full cowboy regalia
points to a more innocent time in rural Minnesota, where the
55-year-old author grew up and where much of his work is set.</TE>
<TE>   Both windows of the study are stained glass, each depicting books,
pens and other literary devices. And in the corner is his desk, where
O'Brien works from early morning until evening, polishing the words
that have found their way on to his computer screen. There are times
when he does not leave his house for days, when obligations become a
nuisance. And he is notorious for writing huge chunks of prose, then
discarding it all because he finds the words lacking. He's also known
for making major revisions on a book between editions.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a struggle. Every book is a struggle. And the struggle is
about things people won't even notice," O'Brien said. "I try to
delete as much ugliness as I recognize from my work. The first
instinct is to reach for the Kmart version of language. Then you try
to find a unique way of saying things."</TE>
<TE>   The setting for O'Brien's latest effort is a 30-year reunion at a
Minnesota college, where a collection of troubled souls gather to
dance and drink and, over the course of the book, reveal the hands
that have been dealt them. It examines a generation that thought it
could change everything, including war, but has had to settle for far
less in the end.</TE>
<TE>   "Thirty-one years ago," O'Brien writes in the opening chapter, "in
the brutal spring of 1969, Amy Robinson and many others had lives
beyond themselves, elevated by the times. There was good and evil.
There was moral heat. But this was the year 2000, a new millennium,
congeniality in public places, hope gone stale, morons become
millionaires, and the gossip was about Ellie Abbott's depression,
Dorothy Stier's breast cancer, Spook Spinelli's successful double
marriage and the fact that she seemed to be going for a triple that
evening with either Marv Bertel or Billy McMann."</TE>
<TE>   With that beginning, O'Brien proceeds to unlock the complicated
relationships among the principal characters, including one who fled
to Canada to avoid the draft and another who had a leg blown off on
the edge of the Song Tra Ky river in Vietnam. Using his eclectic cast
of characters, O'Brien goes to the heart of that era, which has been
his passion for the last three decades. O'Brien said his relentless
aging was the impetus for the book, which began as a one-page short
story in Esquire.</TE>
<TE>   "The time comes when you can't fool yourself," he said. "Some
things you hoped for aren't ever going to come true. You become more
realistic about yourself and the world."</TE>
<TE>   Little in O'Brien's early life gives a clue to the fact that he
would eventually be labeled by some as one of the best writers of his
generation. His father, William, was an insurance salesman in rural
Worthington, Minn.; his mother, Ava, was an elementary school
teacher. He read voraciously, but was, at various times, shy and
overweight, resorting to magic tricks as a lonely pastime. If there
was a hint of a writer-to-be, it was the fact that O'Brien admired
the articles written by his father, who penned personal accounts in
the New York Times of his wartime experience while a soldier on Iwo
Jima and Okinawa during World War II.</TE>
<TE>   By the time O'Brien entered Macalester College in St. Paul, Minn.,
the Vietnam War was in full swing. Opposition was mounting to it,
particularly on college campuses across the country. O'Brien was a
participant in those protests, while at the same time not giving much
thought to his susceptibility to the draft.</TE>
<TE>   But the draft notice did arrive. As a young college graduate, he
found himself facing the first major moral choice of his life--to go
with his conscience or go to war.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought about Canada," he wrote in a much-praised New York
Times Magazine article about his return to Vietnam in 1994. "I
thought about jail. But in the end I could not bear the prospect of
rejection: by my family, my country, my friends, my hometown. I would
risk conscience and rectitude before risking the loss of love.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a coward. I went to Vietnam."</TE>
<TE>   O'Brien did his time and got out. But while he was in Vietnam, he
patrolled an area called My Lai--long after the war's most infamous
atrocity, but before it came to the public's attention. From there,
he made his way to Harvard's School of Government, a decorated
veteran living in one of the nation's antiwar hotbeds. While at
Harvard, O'Brien expanded on a series of war vignettes that he had
written for Minnesota newspapers, which led to his first book, "If I
Die in Combat, Box Me Up and Ship Me Home," published in 1973.</TE>
<TE>   O'Brien said it was the Vietnam experience that finally gave him
his voice.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't until Vietnam that I had the courage and compulsion to
[write]. I wasn't brave enough to try," O'Brien said. "Vietnam made
me find the courage to say that if I don't write about it, I'll go
nuts."</TE>
<TE>   With the exception of a one-year stint as a reporter for the
Washington Post, O'Brien has been writing books ever since. "July,
July" is his eighth. In the process, he has legitimized the genre of
writing about Vietnam, moving it from confessional work to
literature.</TE>
<TE>   "He moves into the realm of the imagination as well as trying to
describe things as realistically as possible," said Wayne Karlin, a
former Marine whose books were influenced by O'Brien. "They are about
how art can be much more than memory."</TE>
<TE>   Among those efforts was the 1990 publication of "The Things They
Carried," which was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize and the
National Book Critics Circle Award. The book, which alternates
between realism and yarn-spinning, is described by author Joseph
Galloway ("We Were Soldiers Once ... And Young") as "one of the most
amazing pieces of writing I've ever come across." And writer David
Halberstam, who won the Pulitzer Prize for his Vietnam reporting,
said reading O'Brien is "like watching the national anguish go on
through him."</TE>
<TE>   O'Brien was living in a cramped Boston apartment when Tom Grimes,
who heads the master of fine arts program at Southwest Texas State,
offered him a job. When O'Brien accepted, the two went searching for
a place for the new professor to live. Onion Creek was one of the
first places they looked. O'Brien bought the home of an elderly
couple who had lived there for years. Arnold Palmer once sat in the
living room.</TE>
<TE>   Other things have happened along the way. He met his wife,
Meredith, when she went to a reading in New York and afterward asked
if O'Brien would like to have a cup of coffee. She was surprised when
he said yes. They dated for eight years.</TE>
<TE>   His parents have moved from Minnesota to San Antonio, where his
sister now lives.</TE>
<TE>   And he is working on the beginning of a new book. There is only
the very vaguest of an idea right now--a colossal event that happens
to an everyday guy, thereby changing everything.</TE>
<TE>   And what of all these honors and the praise that have been heaped
upon the unassuming chain smoker? O'Brien takes the long view.</TE>
<TE>   "What tells is whether the books endure," he said. "As a writer
you hope that a book will be durable enough to survive context.
'Richard III' survived context."</TE>

<LD>Could it be that we are ready to look again at discipline in schools,
at what has been lost as well as gained since we banned the paddle?
When I wrote about corporal punishment last week, I figured readers
would take verbal whacks at what I had to say.</LD>
<LD>   And a few did--accusing me of sentimentalizing abuse by teachers
when I lamented the lack of discipline in schools and reminisced
about my youth, when infractions brought swats with wooden paddles.</LD>
<LD>   "Reading your column today made me so mad I can hardly see
straight. Paddling is no way to reinforce good behavior," wrote a
Burbank mother. "It doesn't teach respect for authority. It only
teaches fear."</LD>
<TE>   But many readers weighed in with the sentiment that a little dose
of fear wouldn't hurt today's kids.</TE>
<TE>   "I really hate to sound provincial about this, but being a parent,
not to mention 13 years of teaching, has convinced me that fear and
shame, properly dispensed, are effective means for shaping and
improving young personalities," wrote a high school teacher, who
graduated from Dominguez High in 1973,  back when "if you messed up,
you were whacked with a paddle or a ruler and that was the end of
it." These days, she said, "if there is a conflict [with a student],
we must call conferences with the child, parents, administrators,
school psychologists."</TE>
<TE>   And often parents presume that the school, not their child, is at
fault, or refuse to see problem behavior for what it is. Parents
whose kids flout the rules--or have none--at home are not likely to
toe the line in school. And those who are well-disciplined at home
don't typically wind up in the principal's office.</TE>
<TE>   "Parents need to wake up and fulfill their responsibilities ... to
teach their children right from wrong," wrote a reader who has spent
26 years in law enforcement. "My biggest complaint is parents who
will defend their child, regardless of the child's outrageous
conduct."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the first place to look at discipline in schools is in the
home.</TE>
<TE>   After eight years in the classroom, "it still amazes me when I
call a parent [about a discipline problem] to hear things like 'I
know, he talks to me like that at home, too.' Or 'I don't know what
you want me to do.' Or 'Are you calling my son or daughter a liar?' "
wrote a Torrance high school teacher.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers sometimes avoid calling home, she said, because it can
add to the problem. "Rather than students returning the next day
apologetic, they're even more confrontational because they are mad
you called their parents."</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, teachers aren't always right, and children are
sometimes wrongfully accused. But it undermines student discipline
when parents take to chastising teachers. Said one veteran
administrator, "When I have a parent who's challenging me and
defending the student, I send the young person out of the office and
say [to the parent], 'You and I may not agree, but we will not
disagree in front of this child."</TE>
<TE>   A retired teacher from Santa Clarita remembers when swatting was
sanctioned and parents were allies. He had a short list of behaviors
that students knew would earn a paddling--and administered swats
about a dozen times in the eight years his school allowed it. "Most
of that time, when the dads heard about it, they added on one or two
more," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, he said, he's run into many of the boys he swatted,
"and all of them have thanked me for it." One, who was paddled for
stealing candy from the teacher and toy cars from some of his
classmates, came back years later to tell him this story: "Across
from his junior high was a 7-Eleven. Two buddies asked him to join
them on a shoplifting spree. He said he suddenly 'felt his butt
tighten.' " He refused to go along; his classmates were later
arrested."</TE>
<TE>   Fear can be a powerful motivator. I'll never forget an interview I
had years ago with a young man who had grown up under conditions that
seemed to prime him for failure. He was raised by a single mother in
a poor, dangerous neighborhood, surrounded by guns, drugs and gangs.
Yet, while most of his buddies wound up on drugs, in jail or dead, he
was heading to college.</TE>
<TE>   "What kept you out of trouble?" I asked him. "Didn't the gangs
pressure you, too?"</TE>
<TE>   Yes, he said, but so did his mother, who insisted he stay in
school and off the streets. "And I was more afraid of my mother than
I was the gangs."</TE>
<TE>   Certainly the decline in school discipline is not only the fault
of parents or children or fluctuating social mores. Some teachers are
better at keeping order than others. In their classes, children
wouldn't dream of cutting up.</TE>
<TE>   But the challenges facing schools are greater today: Kids are more
aggressive, families more troubled, society more tolerant of
"anything goes." And new teachers are being rushed into classrooms to
cope with exploding student enrollment armed with little more than a
few hours of training and a short list of classroom-management
techniques.</TE>
<TE>   Studies of effective school discipline show that campuses with the
fewest behavior problems are those with clear, high standards,
consistently applied; a "warm climate" of caring among students and
staff; a schoolwide commitment to learning; and intolerance for
behaviors that interfere with learning. A similar prescription ought
to apply at home.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps that's what soothed the sting of the swats my teachers
delivered. I didn't feel I was being paddled because the teacher
hated kids or, as one reader suggested, "because they seemed to find
pleasure in hurting us."</TE>
<TE>   I knew--because of the way they pushed, encouraged, listened and
lectured--that my teachers cared about me, wanted me to succeed and
knew that self-discipline was required for success. Yes, I was
punished unfairly a time or two. But that taught me not to expect
life to be fair, a lesson that has served me as well as anything else
I learned in school.</TE>
<TE>   So I'm not longing for a return of the paddle, but for an era in
which schools are more orderly and our parents and teachers are on
the same page.</TE>

<LD>Pageant Salute</LD>
<LD>   "Did you know my dad?" That was the question the young son of a
fireman killed in the Sept. 11 attacks asked L.A. County Fire Capt.
Gary Walsh when he welcomed him to California this summer.</LD>
<LD>   "I told him I didn't, but the L.A. County Fire Department was all
part of his extended fire family," Walsh said during a gala reception
that preceded a performance of the Pageant of the Masters in Laguna
Beach. Walsh and fellow captains Ted Garcia, John Price and Steve
Berro were guests of honor when the final season performance was
staged at a benefit raising more than $200,000 for the Festival of
Arts building fund.</LD>
<TE>   More than 2,500 guests toured art exhibits, dined on gourmet fare
and watched the "Heroes and Heroines"-themed production Aug. 31 at
the Irvine Bowl. "These courageous officers not only offered their
services at ground zero, they provided families with visits to
Southern California where they had the chance to experience the
hospitality for which the Southland is famous," festival board
president Scott Moore told the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Joining with other members of the department, the men solicited
donations and enlisted the help of airlines, hotels and amusement
parks to "give 409 families a one-week paid vacation," said Garcia.
"It was an incredible feeling for all of us."</TE>
<TE>   Helping to host the families "was one of the most rewarding
experiences I've had in my life," said Walsh, chairman of the Los
Angeles County Firefighters Honor FDNY project. "I just saw a family
off today."</TE>
<TE>   Before the pageant, the firemen joined about 350 guests who'd paid
$300 each to attend a private dinner at the Tivoli Terrace restaurant
on the bowl grounds and, under a canopy of trees, dine on stuffed
shrimp and filet mignon.</TE>
<TE>   Dinner guests included actress Sally Struthers, who had just
completed a run with singer Christa Jackson in "Always, Patsy Cline"
at the Laguna Playhouse. "I love coming to this pageant," she said.
"It's an evening you won't see anywhere else."</TE>

<TE>   Sweet Dreams</TE>
<TE>   From Washington, D.C., to San Francisco, chef Julia Child has been
feted with cakes fancy enough to rival those in her famous cookbooks.
One towering confection was covered with curls of white chocolate.
Another replicated her Cambridge kitchen. And when she again
celebrates her 90th birthday at a Sept. 22 luncheon benefit in Los
Angeles for KCET, a dramatic cake will be the centerpiece--a
chocolate-buttermilk creation smothered with symbols of her nearly
40-year career as America's grand dame of culinary arts.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, her birthday was Aug. 15. But that was celebrated at a
seaside family reunion in Maine. Since February, Child has watched
candles flame at a series of birthday bashes that have doubled as
benefits for her favorite charities. "Any opportunity to raise funds
for public television I'm for," said Child, whose cooking series has
been a staple in KCET programming since 1964. "I wouldn't be anything
if it weren't for public television."</TE>
<TE>   The luncheon for 275 guests at the Four Seasons Hotel will also
present a panel discussion moderated by Bon Appetit magazine editor
Barbara Fairchild and featuring Child, French chef Jacques Pepin,
Richard Sanford (of Sanford Winery and Vineyards) and TV producer
Geoffrey Drummond. More than a dozen L.A.-area chefs--including
Joachim Splichal, Susan Feniger and Mary Sue Milliken--will be table
hosts at the event.</TE>
<TE>   And while guests, who will pay $300 to $10,000 a ticket--the
latter gets you a seat with the birthday girl--will feast on gourmet
fare, it's the presentation of the cake that will highlight one of
the remaining salutes to the beloved chef. (Still to go: parties in
Carmel and Tustin).</TE>
<TE>   Whipped up by Four Seasons Hotel pastry chef Donald
Wressell--winner of the gold medal at last year's World Cup of Pastry
competition in Lyon, France--the 3-foot cake will be made of flour,
powdered cocoa, buttermilk, eggs, vanilla and vegetable oil and
"taste like the cake your grandma used to make," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Wressell, 41, who also helped create Child's 80th birthday
dessert, has been conjuring up the cake design for weeks. "It takes a
while to think things through," said Wressell, who in 1996 made a
chocolate replica of the National Air and Space Museum for the
Smithsonian's 150th birthday celebration.</TE>
<TE>   Foremost is taste, he said. No problem. The recipe was inherited
from a former hotel food and beverage manager's mother, who used to
make the rich chocolate cake with buttermilk icing for employees'
birthdays. It was so delicious that Wressell tested it, put it on the
menu and watched it become the hotel's most popular dessert.</TE>
<TE>   Next: presentation. Besides creating a wood platform for the
cake--"not too tall, we want the cake to speak for itself"--that will
bring it up to about 6 feet, Wressell will use a mixture of powdered
sugar, cornstarch, gelatin and water (pastillage, in pastry circles)
to decorate the cake with colorful, edible symbols of Child's career:
a television, her cookbooks, pots, pans, rolling pins, molds--even an
image of Child. "We're going to do it up," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And what will he prepare for Child's 100th birthday? "Something
light--with fruit--if I have the honor," Wressell said. "An almond
cake with creme filling topped with strawberries." Luncheon

<LD>I was so excited when Miss Chalmers asked me to sing a solo in the
last recital of the summer.</LD>
<LD>   We were all going to sing "Let There Be Peace on Earth," and
halfway through, everyone would stop and I'd do the fifth and sixth
lines alone.</LD>
<LD>   I rushed home to tell Mom and Dad. Mom hugged me. "Erin! That's
wonderful," she said. I could tell she was really proud.</LD>
<TE>   I practiced and practiced. Once I was practicing in front of the
mirror in our hall when I saw my little brother, Jim, and his friend
imitating me behind my back. After that, I was careful.</TE>
<TE>   The big night came.</TE>
<TE>   We had a family dinner with Grandma and Grandpa before the
performance, and I could hardly eat a thing.</TE>
<TE>   Grandpa grinned. "Even stars have to eat," he said. Oh man! I was
so nervous.</TE>
<TE>   The little kids performed first. They sang "Itsy Bitsy Spider,"
and everyone loved them.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone always does. They are so cute.</TE>
<TE>   Then we were up.</TE>
<TE>   "Erin!" Miss Chalmers drew me away from the rest of the chorus.</TE>
<TE>   I thought she was giving me a last-minute tip but instead she
said: "I hate to do this. But we've decided not to have a solo. Some
of the other mothers thought it wasn't fair. Is that OK?"</TE>
<TE>   Poor Miss Chalmers. She looked so worried.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure." I made myself smile. Could she see how disappointed I was?</TE>
<TE>   "Next group up," someone called, and we marched out onto the
platform.</TE>
<TE>   I could see my family. Grandpa had brought flowers for me. For the
"star." I swallowed hard. They'd all be so let down.</TE>
<TE>   We began singing, and when we finished there was a lot of
applause. Almost as much as there'd been for the little kids.</TE>
<TE>   Then we got to go down and sit with our families.</TE>
<TE>   "Hello, star," Grandpa said. And Mom and Dad beamed. "You were
great."</TE>
<TE>   "I guess they figured out you had too rotten a voice to be solo,"
Jim said.</TE>
<TE>   "Be quiet," Dad told him.</TE>
<TE>   "The solo got canceled," I said.</TE>
<TE>   Grandpa put the flowers in my arms.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sorry you bought these when I wasn't anything special," I
said.</TE>
<TE>   Grandpa raised his eyebrows. "Not special? You were super special.
Anyone can sing a solo, even me ... in the shower. Not everyone is
good enough to be in a chorus. To add your voice to all those other
lovely voices! You were superb."</TE>
<TE>   I buried my face in my flowers. Maybe he was only saying that
because he's my Grandpa.</TE>
<TE>   But maybe it was true. Either way, I felt really, really good.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Eve Bunting says that she sings like a lark when she's in the
shower but that she has never been good enough to be part of a
chorus! This story will be on The Times' Web site at

<AU>M. DELAL BAER</AU>
<BD>M. Delal Baer is chairman of and senior fellow at the
Mexico Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Whatever happened to the vaunted political love affair between
Mexico's President Vicente Fox and President Bush?</LD>
<LD>   Recently, Fox canceled two trips to Texas, one in a pique over
border water disputes and another to protest the refusal of Texas
Gov. Rick Perry to stay the execution of a Mexican national convicted
of murder. With these and other signs of tension visible on the
anniversary of Fox's September 2001 visit to Washington, some worry
that relations between the two countries are stalled, at best, and on
a collision course, at worst.</LD>
<LD>   Overheated expectations are partly to blame for the current
predicament. Swept up in the euphoria after Fox's historic electoral
triumph, Mexico unilaterally made a high-stakes gamble that
Washington could be convinced to make sweeping changes in immigration
policy and to transform the North American Free Trade Agreement along
the lines of the European Union, complete with open borders and large
development funds. "It was an act of audacity," one former Mexican
diplomat said.</LD>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the entire relationship has come to be judged by a
single issue--whether or not the U.S. legalizes millions of Mexicans
residing illegally in the country. "Mexico has 'migratized' the
relationship," observed a senior U.S. diplomat, who remembers with
irony how Washington "narcotized" the relationship in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Predictably, Mexico is frustrated by the lack of action in the
U.S. Congress and by the events of Sept. 11, which have sidelined the
immigration issue. "They got themselves out on that limb, and they
can get themselves off it," said one U.S. official, who added that
Mexico was warned that a huge rewriting of migration policy would be
politically difficult to achieve.</TE>
<TE>   But Mexico may find it hard to back off the immigration limb and
may resort to a little Yankee-bashing under pressure from critics who
argue that Fox invested too much in the U.S. and received too little
in return.</TE>
<TE>   The irony is that real achievements have been obscured by the
immigration obsession. Direct foreign investment in Mexico has never
been higher, anti-drug efforts have never been better and security
cooperation has never been closer. The two presidents have committed
to the Partnership for Prosperity, the most ambitious effort to
alleviate poverty since President John F. Kennedy's Alliance for
Progress. Even on migration there are modest achievements, including
tacit U.S. acceptance of Mexico's issuance of consular identity cards
to illegal immigrants. Clearly, the U.S. and Mexico are not on a
collision course, and bilateral relations never should be made
contingent upon a single issue.</TE>
<TE>   So what can be done to get the relationship on track?</TE>
<TE>   First, the two governments could do a better job of picking the
low-lying fruit in bilateral relations. While waiting for Congress to
pass a grand immigration bill, why not increase the number of
temporary agricultural visas issued through already existing
programs? About 27,000 such visas are handed out annually, and U.S.
agricultural labor needs are surely greater. American jobs are not
threatened by Mexican agricultural labor, making such visas
politically neutral. Many of those who die in the desert trying to
cross the border illegally are agricultural workers, so an expansion
of the agricultural-visa program would have a humanitarian benefit.
Fox would have a victory to take home, and the U.S. would fill its
need for farm workers.</TE>
<TE>   Second, both governments could do a better job of turning untoward
twists of fate to their advantage. The national interests of the U.S.
and Mexico are complementary when it comes to homeland defense.
Millions of Mexicans and Mexican Americans reside in U.S. cities, and
they are as vulnerable to terrorist attack as any U.S. citizen. A
contagious bioterrorist attack on the U.S. would strike deep in the
heart of Mexico. The case for a North American security partnership
should resonate in both countries.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, more thought should be devoted to the post-NAFTA
paradigm. The Fox government's interest in a European model of
integration drives its push for free movement of labor and social
development funds. The Bush administration expected a partner more
interested in increasing private investment. Until these leaders have
a heart-to-heart about the post-NAFTA roadmap, they may continue to
pursue incompatible goals. Such a discussion may sound like a
hopelessly academic exercise, but it is not, and it may well prevent
future tensions, as well as provide an opportunity to explore new
horizons of North American policy.</TE>

<BD>Gioconda Belli is a Nicaraguan poet and novelist.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last week, Otto J. Reich, the controversial assistant secretary of
State for Western Hemisphere affairs, visited my country, Nicaragua.
Although Reich stayed only about 24 hours, Nicaraguan President
Enrique Bolanos had anxiously awaited the visit. Since his
inauguration in January, Bolanos has been engaged in a head-to-head
clash with his predecessor and current president of the National
Assembly, Arnoldo Aleman. Bolanos wanted Reich to deliver an urgent
message back home: If Bolanos is to succeed in his battle against
corruption, he needs more than words of support from Washington.</LD>
<LD>   Bolanos' plight could be the subject of a Gabriel Garcia Marquez
novel. An honest 74-year-old entrepreneur, he served as vice
president to the man who has become his nemesis. During his campaign
for the presidency, Bolanos promised the Nicaraguan people he would
not perpetuate the corruption that had plagued the Aleman
administration and vowed to prosecute those who had enriched
themselves by plundering the state's coffers. His message resonated
with voters. Bolanos received 56% of the vote, a record 92% of the
voting population went to the polls and his Liberal Party won a
majority in the 92-member National Assembly.</LD>
<TE>   In the mid-1990s, Aleman, a middle-class lawyer who was mayor of
Managua, revived a defunct splinter of Anastasio Somoza's Liberal
Party and successfully ran for president in 1996. Aleman won the
people's favor with the motto, "Deeds, Not Words," denouncing
Sandinista rhetoric. Unfortunately, his deeds were mostly
self-serving. No sooner had he become president than he began to
amass a huge fortune for himself and his cronies.</TE>
<TE>   When I was in Nicaragua this summer, crowds filled a well-known
restaurant-bar to watch Nicaraguan stand-up comedian Luis Enrique
Calderon. In his show, Calderon wrapped a number of pillows around
his waist, pulled a fiery red T-shirt over them and donned a red
baseball cap, transforming himself into Aleman, who is said to weigh
at least 300 pounds. "American Express-ident" is the name of
Calderon's show, an allusion to the unrestricted use that Aleman and
his crony bureaucrats made of credit cards to pay for official
government business. For example, the lavish engagement party he
threw for himself at the Biltmore Hotel in Miami in 1999 was
reportedly paid for with public funds.</TE>
<TE>   The crowds loved Calderon's riff on "Gordoman," the nickname most
Nicaraguans use to refer to Aleman. But the laughter underscored the
widespread feelings of dismay and outrage that people still harbor
toward the former president. Thanks to a constitutional reform he
worked out with the Sandinistas during his administration, Aleman
will enjoy parliamentary immunity as long as he remains a member of
the National Assembly. But that's only the beginning of Bolanos'
problems. Over Bolanos' objections, the Liberal Party members of the
National Assembly chose Aleman president of the legislative body,
which gives him the power to block all of Bolanos' legislative
initiatives.</TE>
<TE>   Early last month, a frustrated Bolanos made an unprecedented move
to expose the gravity of the situation to the Nicaraguan people and
the international community. He took the case against Aleman to the
public at the National Assembly. Acting Atty. Gen. Francisco Fiallos
laid out the details and offered partial proof of how Aleman, his
family and closest allies allegedly diverted $100 million of public
funds to banks in Panama owned by Aleman, his daughter--a substitute
deputy in the National Assembly--and his principal henchman, Byron
Jerez, who was minister of internal revenue.</TE>
<TE>   In a speech following the attorney general's presentation that was
broadcast on radio and national TV, Bolanos addressed Aleman:
"Arnoldo, I never dreamed you would betray your people like this. You
took the pensions from the retirees, medicine from the sick, salaries
from the teachers. You stole the people's trust." The president also
appealed to his fellow party members in the National Assembly to
strip Aleman of his immunity. Along with thousands of Nicaraguans, he
signed a petition to the legislative body demanding it put national
interests above personal or partisan loyalties.</TE>
<TE>   In a Latin America plagued with corruption scandals, the valiant
quest of the Nicaraguan president to bring his corrupt predecessor to
justice should rally unequivocal support. Especially for the United
States, with its long history of involvement in Nicaragua, it
presents an ideal opportunity to encourage and reward a government's
commitment to ethical behavior. Yet Bolanos is hearing few words of
encouragement.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Nicaragua's finances are so bad that his government
cannot hope to launch any of its promised programs to relieve
poverty. The International Monetary Fund is withholding urgently
needed funds because the National Assembly didn't pass the tax reform
it requested. While in Nicaragua, Reich offered verbal support, but
Washington has not used its leverage at the IMF--the U.S. is the
fund's most important shareholder--to break the impasse, nor has the
U.S. government agreed to a bridge loan in the meantime.</TE>
<TE>   Since his speech, Bolanos has gathered the 47 votes, among them
Sandinistas, he needs to strip Aleman of his immunity. But the
leadership of the National Assembly, which remains loyal to the
former president, is blocking a vote in the hope of forcing Bolanos
to negotiate with Aleman. A recent poll showed that 77% of
Nicaraguans approve of Bolanos' crusade. But his support may begin to
diminish if the current standoff impairs his government's ability to
improve the lot of the Nicaraguan people--unless Washington finally
rewards the good guy with more than words.</TE>

<KH>WAR WITH IRAQ</KH>
<HD>Political Peril Aplenty if Congress Gets to Vote</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN V. LAST</AU>
<BD>Jonathan V. Last is online editor of the Weekly
Standard.</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Not two weeks ago, the administration publicly concluded it didn't
need to ask Congress' permission to attack Iraq. Now, President Bush
is poised to pop the question.</LD>
<LD>   Capitol Hill should be pleased. For weeks, lawmakers insisted,
loudly, that they expect to be part of any decision about Saddam
Hussein's future. Sen. John W. Warner of Virginia decried "an
information gap" with the White House and said that "Congress has to
be a partner" to the president. Rep. Jim Nussle of Iowa said that "by
skirting Congress, the president risks another Vietnam." And those
are just the Republicans.</LD>
<LD>   Democrats have been less circumspect. Senate Majority Leader Tom
Daschle's spokeswoman said, "The issue is whether the president
should seek to obtain the full support of the American people and
their elected representatives before sending U.S. troops into combat
in Iraq." Added Washington Rep. Rick Larsen: "Based on what the
administration has shared with Congress, I'd say the administration
is far short of being able to count on Congress' support for any
action."</LD>
<TE>   But Capitol Hill should be careful about what it wishes for.
"There is," said former Nebraska Sen. Bob Kerrey, "political risk all
around."</TE>
<TE>   If Bush goes to Congress in the next few weeks, he's almost sure
to come out a winner. One high-level congressional aide explained: "I
think it would be useful for the president to say, 'Look, here's the
deal: I need this authority, here's the resolution I want you to vote
on.' It can't have the breadth of Gulf of Tonkin, but it'll have to
be broad enough to give him the leeway he needs."</TE>
<TE>   Most observers concede that this type of resolution would pass.
Lee H. Hamilton, a former Democratic congressman and now director of
the Washington-based Woodrow Wilson International Center for
Scholars, said: "The Congress will give him the authority. There will
be some debate, I imagine, but he'll win the vote. I can't remember
when a president has not prevailed, at least in the short term, in a
national security debate with Congress."</TE>
<TE>   For members of Congress, however, voting on an Iraq resolution
poses a number of political problems. The overwhelming majority of
Republicans in Congress would grant Bush any authorization he asks
for, yet a vote might give the few remaining members of the party's
isolationist wing an opportunity to embarrass the GOP leadership.</TE>
<TE>   As they showed with the Balkans during the Clinton administration,
some Republicans, notably Iowa Rep. James A. Leach and Kansas Sen.
Pat Roberts, would prefer to keep American troops home for anything
but self-defense. "I am very apprehensive about U.S. military
intervention against Iraq absent a direct attack of Iraq on another
country or against us," Leach said.</TE>
<TE>   Other Republicans, such as Kansas Reps. Jim Ryun and Jerry Moran
and Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter, want to explore
alternatives--economic sanctions and arms inspections--first. If
force proves necessary, they want to exercise it within the framework
of an international coalition.</TE>
<TE>   But the bigger political problems fall to Democrats. With midterm
elections in November, a vote on going to war with Iraq now could
come back to haunt members in close races. "The dilemma for every
Democrat is, 'Do you side with your lefty base, or side with the
commander in chief in a time of war?' " said the Hudson Institute's
Marshall Wittmann.</TE>
<TE>   There are divisive pressures building in the party, and the
dynamic could produce a split. For example, Minority Leader Richard
A. Gephardt of Missouri, who wants to take back the House in
November, has staked out a pro-war position, while up-and-comer
Minority Whip Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco, who wants to be the next
House leader, hints that she'll oppose an assault on Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Worse, the Democrats don't want to be perceived as the party of
appeasement. In a closed-door meeting before Congress recessed in
August, Ohio Rep. Dennis J. Kucinich tried to get House Democrats to
agree to take a unified stand against the war. He failed, but many of
his fellow Democrats are with him. One Democratic congressional aide
predicts, "You'll have a fairly vocal and reactionary peace wing in
the House."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps in the Senate too. The Philadelphia Inquirer recently
reported that Carl Levin, chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, made the Chamberlain-esque argument that attacking Iraq
might actually incite Hussein to use his weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, 45 of the 55 Democratic senators and 179 of the 265
Democratic representatives voted against the Gulf War. Another
showing like that, so close to an election, could be bad news for the
party. "It exposes [Democrats'] Achilles' heel--national security,"
said Wittmann.</TE>
<TE>   "I think [a vote] is going to embarrass anyone who's not on the
right side of liberating Iraq," said Kerrey. "Those who vote for it
are going to be glad they did, and those who don't are going to have
to carry that vote around for the rest of their lives."</TE>
<TE>   Democratic consultant John Weaver doesn't envision another big
rift: "You're going to have the usual people, both on the far left
and on the isolationist right, who will be against it, but mostly
you'll see relative unanimity. People learned their lesson in '91--on
both sides."</TE>
<TE>   Even a unanimous vote has a potential downside for Democrats,
though. "If there's unanimity," explained Weaver, "it sucks up the
oxygen and makes it hard to talk about domestic issues."</TE>
<TE>   There's a special group of Democrats who will be particularly
exposed by a vote: those with presidential aspirations. William
Galston, a senior advisor to former President Clinton, notes, "It
would be a very consequential vote for Democrats who are running for
president.... Those of us with memories remember that the vote on the
Gulf War provided a defining moment for Democrats with national
ambitions."</TE>
<TE>   A vote on war with Iraq might also affect the current crop of
presidential aspirants. According to Dan McKivergan, a former aide to
Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, "A vote could be an
opportunity for a Democrat to buck the party, stand up and lead and
resurrect the [Henry] 'Scoop' Jackson wing of the party." Or, it
could be an unrecoverable mistake, like former Sen. Sam Nunn's "no"
vote in 1991 that ended his presidential hopes. Connecticut
Democratic Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman, for one, has decided to walk
shoulder to shoulder with Bush, saying, "I think the president is
headed in the right direction." Already viewed with suspicion by the
party's left wing, Lieberman's vote could hurt him in the Democratic
primaries but help him in the general election if he got the
presidential nomination.</TE>
<TE>   Other candidates-in-waiting are having a harder time sorting out
where they want to be. "I think people will be very supportive of
whatever action is necessary," North Carolina Democratic Sen. John
Edwards said.</TE>
<TE>   The timing of a vote on war with Iraq isn't lost on these men.
Lamenting how the president avoided going to Congress all summer and
is heading there now, weeks before the midterms, an advisor to one
presidential hopeful said with a sigh, "This is the type of
thing--mixing the policy with pure politics--that drives my guy
crazy."</TE>
<TE>   When the primaries are in full swing, nothing Edwards, Lieberman
and House members with eyes on the presidency have said, no matter
how thoughtful or eloquent, will matter. They will be tied to their
vote. Today they insist they must be consulted on war with Iraq.
Should a vote occur soon, they'll be envying presidential hopefuls
Vermont Gov. Howard Dean and Al Gore because they weren't.</TE>

<HD>Better Use for Tax Cuts</HD>

<AU>MAYA MacGUINEAS</AU>
<BD>Maya MacGuineas is a senior fellow at the New America
Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank.</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>While Democrats disliked President Bush's trillion-dollar-plus tax
cut from the beginning, the dramatic deterioration in the federal
budget outlook has given them new ammunition for assaulting the
final, most expensive phase of the cut. With deficits forecast for
the next three years, holding off the rest of the tax cut, as
Democrats are suggesting, seems eminently sensible. But there's a
catch. Democrats aren't invoking fiscal restraint as their cause.
Rather, they want to spend the money generated by curtailing the tax
cut on education and prescription drugs for seniors. Since a purpose
of running a budget surplus is to increase savings, the Democratic
proposal seems as fiscally irresponsible as plowing ahead with the
tax cut. But the idea of postponing the final phase of the tax cut
provides the underpinnings for what could be a fiscally responsible
and economically beneficial compromise.</LD>
<TE>   As gloomy as the current budget projections are, they pale in
comparison with the deficits that will emerge when baby boomers
retire. Yet the question of how to reform Social Security has created
a divide even larger than the one produced by the debate over cutting
taxes versus government spending. Republicans want to set up
individual investment accounts but ignore the fact that the loss of
budget surpluses makes funding the accounts next to impossible.
Democrats have been content to attack Republican plans and provide no
alternatives, though doing nothing is not an option.</TE>
<TE>   Enter the compromise. Diverting the balance of the Bush tax cuts
into personal retirement accounts would not only resolve the dispute
on short-term budget priorities, it would also contribute a solution
to the retirement issue.</TE>
<TE>   For starters, the diversion would accomplish an objective that
both Democrats and Republicans share: putting resources aside today
to help reduce the burden of paying for Social Security benefits in
the future. This was the original purpose of the lockbox, an approach
that quickly failed because government lockboxes are easy to pick.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the appeal of the GOP's private accounts is that the funds
could not be used for other purposes, thus providing a far more
secure lockbox. But the problem with most private-account plans is
that they don't specify the source of the money. As Democrats have
pointed out, using Social Security payroll taxes to fund the accounts
could weaken the system's ability to pay traditional benefits, not to
mention further undermine the overall budget.</TE>
<TE>   But if Congress were to hold off implementing the rest of the Bush
tax cut, it would free more than enough money to start building
individual accounts for younger workers while the rest of the Social
Security program continued to pay benefits as promised. It's an
approach with clear bipartisan appeal.</TE>
<TE>   For Republicans, diverting the tax cut to private accounts would
not be a tax increase as such, since the money would remain the
private property of workers. For Democrats, the plan would commit
more resources to Social Security, reducing the level of benefit cuts
that would otherwise occur.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most important, saving the money in private accounts is
the only use that would be as beneficial to the economy as paying
down the debt. The increase in savings would supply more investment
capital and keep interest rates in check, contributing to economic
growth.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, the timing of an individual investment account proposal
might strike many as odd, given the recent stock market implosion.
But while there are plenty of lessons to be learned from the market
meltdown, avoiding saving for retirement should not be one of them.
Nobody expects the market decline to last for decades, the time
horizon of retirement investment. Since investing the accounts as
part of Social Security would go hand in hand with regulations
ensuring that workers invest only in well-diversified funds, risk
would be contained.</TE>
<TE>   That said, creating private accounts alone will not save Social
Security. As all politicians know, but few are willing to
acknowledge, other reforms--raising the payroll tax cap, increasing
the retirement age or slowing the growth of benefits--will be
necessary. A primary benefit of private accounts is that they will
provide a second source of retirement funds to help compensate for
these changes.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, since taxpayers and Social Security participants are
one and the same, using the tax cut to fund individual investment
accounts would seem to be in the best interests of the public at
large.</TE>

<AU>WALTER RUSSELL MEAD</AU>
<BD>Walter Russell Mead, a contributing editor to Opinion,
is the author of "Special Providence: American Foreign Policy and How
It Changed the World."</BD>
<DL>MANILA</DL>
<LD>The events of Sept. 11 precipitated one of the most dramatic periods
in U.S. foreign policy since the early years of the Cold War. After
President Bush summoned an aroused nation to a far-reaching, if
ill-defined, "war on terror," U.S. troops and their allies toppled
the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. Since then, they have committed
themselves to what could become a dangerous, long-term military
occupation of one of the poorest, most violent and most chaotic
places on Earth. In much of the world, a wave of sympathy for the
victims of the terrorist attacks has gradually yielded to
apprehension about what many perceive as excessive U.S. combativeness
and unilateralism--and especially about the Bush administration's
determined support for "regime change" in Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   An ugly rift has opened between the U.S. and many of its closest
Cold War allies in Europe as recriminations fly across the Atlantic,
an ocean that seems to widen and deepen from one month to the next.
U.S. diplomatic isolation appears to be growing. Bitter battles have
erupted over U.S. opposition to the International Criminal Court and
the Kyoto Protocol. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell was roundly
booed at the U.N. summit on sustainable development in Johannesburg,
South Africa.</LD>
<TE>   As suicide bombers caused grisly havoc across Israel, and as
European and Arab criticism of Israeli defense policy reached new
levels of intensity and bitterness, the U.S. committed itself as
never before to support the security policies of a hard-line Likud
government. A nation initially more unified than at any time since
Pearl Harbor was gradually divided by questions and doubts about the
White House's strategy for winning the war. A series of Republican
senior statesmen, many with close ties to the Bush family, came
forward with strong words of caution about rumored plans for invading
Iraq even as heated disputes among the president's inner circle of
advisors boiled over into public view.</TE>
<TE>   Like George Washington at Valley Forge, James Madison fleeing
British troops set to burn the White House, James K. Polk beset by
domestic critics over the Mexican War or Abraham Lincoln facing down
the peace movement during the Civil War, Bush is discovering that war
is the sternest test of an American president's political skills.
Nobody knows yet whether Bush will ride the tiger and surmount the
challenge of wartime leadership like Lincoln, Madison and Polk--or
whether Bush, like Lyndon B. Johnson and Harry S. Truman, will be
forced out of the White House prematurely by the political
consequences of a difficult war. But a year after Sept. 11, there can
be little doubt that the political fortunes of this administration
will be determined by the war that Osama bin Laden unleashed.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, the dark and stormy clouds hovering over the White
House these days have their share of silver linings. First, despite
increasing doubts about the administration's war strategy--and
despite troubling news on the economic front--the president continues
to command high levels of public trust. His job-approval ratings,
down a little from their stratospheric highs, remain solidly
positive. The first president in more than 100 years to scrape into
the White House trailing his opponent in the popular vote is
retaining his stature in the public eye.</TE>
<TE>   Second, the shock of Sept. 11 has made Americans (even senators
and members of Congress) much more willing to support a strong and
active foreign policy. This is not just about the military. After
Sept. 11, Congress finally appropriated money to pay U.S. dues to the
United Nations. The foreign-aid budget has received its most
substantial increase in years, and the president won trade-promotion
authority. Just as the Soviet threat during the Cold War persuaded
many skeptical Americans to support sustained and expensive U.S.
initiatives overseas, so the war on terror is persuading us today
that the U.S. must pay the price of leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Down the road, this renewed national commitment to foreign-policy
leadership is likely to strengthen the president's hand. There is
little doubt Americans would support substantial financial and even
military commitments to facilitate the Arab-Israeli peace process and
help a post-Saddam Hussein Iraq get back on its feet.</TE>
<TE>   Third, and perhaps most significant, there is every reason to
believe that U.S. foreign policy is in better shape than it looks.
The foreign policy process is notoriously messy. Cabinet members
squabble openly with one another. Congress and the executive branch
are at one another's throats. Foreign-policy experts and former
government officials write blistering opinion pieces denouncing
administration shortcomings. Europeans and famous American
intellectuals denounce the simplicity, militarism and unilateralism
of U.S. foreign policy.</TE>
<TE>   It's important to realize that this kind of chaos doesn't mean
that our system is breaking down. It means that our system is
working. U.S. foreign policy has its own unique style. It isn't the
product of masterminds developing long-term national strategies in
ivory towers. It is the product of give and take, of political
battles, of struggles between lobbies, interest groups and
bureaucracies in both the Congress and the executive branch. The
Pentagon pulls one way; the State Department another; the House and
the Senate throw their weight around. The result is almost always a
hideous, embarrassing and very public mess.</TE>
<TE>   For more than 200 years, experts and seasoned political observers
have looked at the U.S. foreign policy process with fascinated
horror--and predicted imminent disaster. Yet something very strange
keeps happening: It keeps working.</TE>
<TE>   Consider containment. Conventional wisdom today looks on the
Truman administration as a golden age of statesmanship and bipartisan
harmony, a time when "wise men" shaped the Marshall Plan and the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization.</TE>
<TE>   That isn't how it looked at the time. Richard Nixon denounced
Truman Secretary of State Dean Acheson's "Cowardly College of
Communist Containment" and the "striped-pants" conspirators in the
State Department who were giving away the store to the communists.
Sen. Joseph McCarthy charged that the government was riddled with
traitors. The Korean War came as a surprise to Washington. Gen.
Douglas MacArthur openly challenged Truman's war leadership.
Europeans and intellectuals couldn't conceal their contempt for the
simple-minded anti-communism of Washington's attitude toward the Cold
War.</TE>
<TE>   But in the end, it worked. Containment brought down the Soviet
Union without a nuclear war, just as Truman and George F. Kennan had
hoped. It is likely to work again.</TE>
<TE>   The war on terror is a new kind of challenge and a new kind of
war. It isn't surprising that we aren't yet sure how to go about
winning it.</TE>
<TE>   The American process of open debate is already beginning to show
signs of consensus. On Iraq, for example, the solid center now seems
to agree with the president that regime change is necessary, by force
if there is no alternative, but that both congressional approval and
international support are needed. An increasingly broad consensus
holds that the U.S. should support the birth of a Palestinian
state--and that the U.S. should work harder to promote democracy in
the Arab Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   We have a long way to go before we build a national consensus
about the war on terror, but history suggests that in our own messy
way we will get there in the end.</TE>

<AU>PETER NAVARRO</AU>
<BD>Peter Navarro teaches macroeconomics at the Graduate
School of Management at UC Irvine.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The greatest danger that terrorism poses to America may be purely
economic, the threat of weapons of mass destruction notwithstanding.
The danger lies in a severe "productivity shock" that could lead to a
gross domestic product trillions of dollars below what it otherwise
should be.</LD>
<LD>   The most obvious source of this shock lies in a deficit-producing
shift from butter to guns in the federal budget as we wage war
against terrorism. Cuts in education and infrastructure spending will
directly lower productivity even as deficit-driven higher interest
rates indirectly cut productivity by crowding out investment in the
private sector.</LD>
<LD>   But the more subtle, potentially more serious productivity shock
may come from a federally mandated substitution of "protective" for
"productive" capital in the private sector. That is, money spent for
more fences, guards and surveillance equipment at the expense of new
machinery, technology and software. Over the next several years, this
capital substitution will probably accelerate as a security-conscious
White House and Congress impose a new layer of regulations the likes
of which we haven't seen since the 1970s.</LD>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, some corporations have voluntarily put capital
into protection. But the levels of counter-terrorism spending have
been far below what one might have expected, particularly in light of
the legal liabilities that corporations may face for failing to
protect their employees and customers. Moreover, with the exception
of a few sectors like petroleum, which have adopted plans to
safeguard facilities from terrorist attacks, there has been little
coordinated action by corporate leadership.</TE>
<TE>   This relative inaction in the private sector poses an ideological
problem for the Bush administration, one that has provoked
considerable differences of opinion across federal bureaucracies. To
understand why President Bush finds himself between a conservative
rock and a pragmatic hard place, it's important to know why the
private sector has failed to shoulder its fair share of the
counter-terrorism burden.</TE>
<TE>   First, corporate executives have been reluctant to invest in new
plant machinery, let alone in protective devices, during these
recessionary times. Corporations that have significantly boosted
counter-terrorism spending, like Boeing, can either afford to or have
no other option because of their risk exposure.</TE>
<TE>   Second, some industry stakeholders have simply let others carry
the burden. Bush's initial response to this "free rider" problem was
classically conservative. Rather than jam new regulations down
industry's throat, government should form "patriotic" partnerships
with business to develop voluntary counter-terrorism obligations. But
after months of corporate foot-dragging, Bush now understands that
free riders will continue to shirk their duty absent federal
mandates.</TE>
<TE>   The recent skirmish between Bush and Congress over the chemical
industry's failure to regulate itself illustrates the underlying
policy conflict. The industry was initially asked to devise plans to
prevent a terrorist attack on chemical plants from sending waves of
toxic fumes into a major urban area. But free riders run rampant in
this industry.</TE>
<TE>   Of the nation's 15,000 chemical companies, only about 10% even
participate in the industry's trade association. Moreover, the
sector's profit margins are very low. Finally, the industry has been
in almost constant regulatory warfare with the government. As a
result of the chemical sector's go-slow approach to managing the
terrorist threat, the Bush administration had to cancel a much
ballyhooed June rollout of the president's voluntary partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   Democratic Sens. Jon Corzine of New Jersey and Harry Reid of
Nevada quickly used the opportunity to push legislation that would
achieve what volunteerism hadn't. Outflanked, Bush tacked. Amazingly,
he is moving forward on using the Environmental Protection Agency, a
favorite target during his 2000 presidential campaign, to crack down
on the chemical industry.</TE>
<TE>   The skirmish raises a broader policy question: How best to proceed
with the design, implementation and enforcement of a complex and
costly layer of new counter-terrorism regulations? Unfortunately, the
answer so far has many unsettling parallels with the mistakes of the
regulation-heavy 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   During that decade, the federal government churned out new, strict
regulations on everything from clean air to water purity to
occupational health and safety. We now know that their poor initial
design and implementation were a major cause of a decade of lost
productivity and painfully slow economic growth.</TE>
<TE>   A basic problem was that overzealous bureaucrats and politicians
adopted a broad range of "command and control" standards that left
little maneuvering room for industry. For example, the EPA required
new power plants to use expensive "best available control technology"
whether or not the new plants could meet new emission standards by
simply burning lower-sulfur coal.</TE>
<TE>   We eventually learned that it was cheaper to use market mechanisms
to bring about the desired regulatory effects. Tools like pollution
and emissions credits and "smog markets" have allowed industry to
meet standards in a less costly manner and not succumb to the
free-rider problem.</TE>
<TE>   Despite this 1970s lesson, Congress and the White House appear to
be moving toward costly command-and-control mandates to get the
counter-terrorism protection they deem necessary. The irony is that a
corporate leadership seemingly as devoid of a cooperative spirit,
patriotism and vision as it is of ethics is driving the movement.</TE>
<TE>   The stakes are high. If productivity levels drop to 1970s levels
again, our GDP will be at least $2 trillion lower than it otherwise
would be in 10 years. Yes, this estimate is wildly at odds with the
Bush administration's, which doesn't anticipate a major productivity
shock. There are, however, no glasses rose-colored enough to produce
honestly the administration's assessment. It's not just the disparate
fiscal, monetary, regulatory and military forces that Sept. 11 has
set in motion. It is also the almost breathtaking scope of the
regulatory counter-terrorist checklist.</TE>
<TE>   This list ranges from strengthened background checks,
vulnerability assessments, bolstered plant security and tighter
enforcement of immigration laws to stockpiling vaccines, establishing
readiness plans in case of another terrorist attack and running a
national health surveillance network. Also included are tasks like
retrofitting nuclear power plants to survive a terrorist air assault,
installing air filters in major buildings to combat bioterrorism and
possibly equipping hazardous waste trucks with automatic braking
systems to thwart sabotage and suicide bombers.</TE>
<TE>   If there is any reassuring news in all this, it is this: If we
allow our creativity to blossom, as we did during the space race, and
if we practice our 1970s regulatory lessons, we can prosecute the war
on terrorism cost-effectively while developing and deploying the new
technologies necessary to outrun terror. The space program is an
instructive precedent: Every dollar spent yielded seven tax dollars
reaped from commercial spinoffs. If we could ensure that our
counter-terrorist research and development cut in both military and
civilian ways, we may be able to overcome any productivity losses
resulting from our war against terrorism.</TE>

<HD>The Day Before</HD>
<DH>Almost a year after the terrorist attacks on New York and
the Pentagon, have we reclaimed the ordinary time of Sept. 10?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Rodriguez</AU>
<BD>Richard Rodriguez is the author of "Brown: The Last
Discovery of America."</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>For nearly a year, we have been telling each other exactly where we
were on Sept. 11, when we heard "the news." Everything about that
terrible day is specific in memory, and the specific links us to a
common grief.</LD>
<LD>   But I keep wondering about the day that came before--the day so
hard to remember--when all was normal.</LD>
<LD>   Sept. 10, last year, fell on a Monday. On my desk calendar, there
is a notation to leave a check for the man who cleans my apartment.
Nothing else.</LD>
<TE>   What did I accomplish on Sept. 10? I am sure I worked. Whom did I
see? I had dinner at home, I suppose. I watched TV, probably. Took
exception to something; I always do.</TE>
<TE>   The ancient Christian church described days of the liturgical year
that were not feast days--the Mondays and Wednesdays of our lives,
those days without cakes or bells or rose-colored vestments--as
belonging to "Ordinary Time." The liturgy of Ordinary Time is
unchanging; prayers are always the same.</TE>
<TE>   On a secular American calendar, Sept. 10 belongs irretrievably to
ordinary time. It is the sort of day to which memory can never
clearly return us. It was a day for errands and sluggish freeway
traffic and paying bills and running late. The stock market on Sept.
10 was down, but only a little. The weather map showed a mild day,
clear, across most of the nation. On the front page of the newspaper,
there was a story about the discontent of some Mexican farmers--that,
and Israelis and Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Did I even skim the headlines that morning?</TE>
<TE>   Americans are notorious for an obliviousness regarding the great
world. It is not only our children who are inattentive, who graduate
from high school or who switch channels without any idea of which
language is spoken in Brazil or which nation is the world's largest
democracy or which religion is destined to become, in this century,
the world's most populous.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, our public face, our conversation--our "culture"--most
days appears to the world as childish and without complexity.
Political discussion on television is a game of tag between "on the
left" and "on the right." The air is full of celebrity gossip. And
the question of Monday morning is, "Seen any good movies?"</TE>
<TE>   I sometimes meet a woman in my neighborhood, a woman born in
Germany. Our ceremony is to stop for several minutes, to talk about
American politics. My neighbor ended one conversation with a shrug, a
disclosure of prejudice: "Oh, but this is not a serious country."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, on Sept. 10, the most popular movie in America was "The
Musketeer." Oprah Winfrey's guest was Dr. Phil McGraw. A top
nonfiction bestseller was Stephen Ambrose's "The Wild Blue," a book
about American pilots in World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Only a year ago, Americans were infatuated with books about the
heroics of GIs at Normandy Beach and at Guadalcanal. The World War II
generation, themed "the Greatest Generation," was leaving the earth
and younger generations were in awe. But the subtext of this
literature raised a lingering doubt: Does the postwar, postmodern,
post-1940s generation have "the stuff"?</TE>
<TE>   Heroism cannot be anticipated or arranged, even by New York book
publishers. In ordinary time, we cannot guess which of the people
standing alongside us on the subway platform or in the elevator are
heroes. On Sept. 10, certainly no one in America imagined that
histories of World War II heroes would be replaced on bookstore
shelves by books about New York City cops and firemen.</TE>
<TE>   Several months before this first anniversary of Sept. 11,
television and newspaper polls counted a majority of Americans who
described their lives as having returned to "normal." It was as
though, for the entire year, we needed to tell ourselves that we had
gotten back to Sept. 10.</TE>
<TE>   The popular culture cranked and sputtered and whined, resumed its
impulse to fill time with noise.</TE>
<TE>   The TV ratings sensation this summer is a teenage talent
competition. The most popular movie of late summer is a movie about
conceptual artists from outer space. But the nonfiction bestseller is
"Let's Roll!" by Lisa Beamer, with Ken Abraham.</TE>
<TE>   Heroism is dependent upon catastrophe and the extraordinary day.
More than half a century ago, a bunch of guys named Joe managed to
save the world from the nation of Goethe and from the nation of
exquisite tea ceremonies.</TE>
<TE>   Americans discovered last year, on Sept. 11, just how much
strength and discipline there is in our country. One was reassured by
the physical bravery of many and the quiet resolution of many more
Americans to live their lives calmly. A year later, and most refuse
to turn against their Muslim neighbors, refuse to curtail the freedom
of being American, even in dangerous times.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, on Sept. 10, the Minnesota Twins beat the Detroit
Tigers 3-2. The Oakland Athletics beat the Texas Rangers 7-1. The
guest on "Larry King Live" that night was John Edward, the guy on TV
who, "at an early age," realized he could communicate with people who
have "passed over."</TE>
<TE>   I think of late summer evening descending across America on Sept.
10, I imagine televisions lighting windows and telephone
conversations filling the night. I celebrate that ordinary night!</TE>
<TE>   I summon Thornton Wilder, the playwright who was one of the
greatest inventors of America because he portrayed ordinary time for
the stage. His play "Our Town" is about what happens in an American
town on an ordinary day, very much like Sept. 10:</TE>
<TE>   STAGE MANAGER: "The name of the town is Grover's Corners, New
Hampshire--just across the Massachusetts line: latitude 42 degrees 40
minutes; longitude 70 degrees 37 minutes. The First Act shows a day
in our town. The day is May 7, 1901. The time is just before dawn.
The sky is beginning to show some streaks of light over in the East
there.... "</TE>
<TE>   I wonder: Do high school English teachers still give "Our Town" to
their students at precisely the moment when kids are most desperate
for excitement, most desperate to escape their "boring" adolescent
lives? Only to dazzle them with universal thoughts?</TE>
<TE>   In "Our Town," Emily, a young woman, recently deceased, yearns to
revisit the living. She is cautioned by Mrs. Gibbs, a neighbor, long
dead, to " ... choose an unimportant day. Choose the least important
day of your life. It will be important enough."</TE>
<TE>   Not a few people I know say they are not going to watch television
or listen to the radio Sept. 11. They are tired of the
commercialization of tragedy, and the politicians and media
commentators who tell us what to feel.</TE>
<TE>   As a media commentator (the author of these words), I understand.
I think, in any case, that there is much to learn about America from
the boredom, the freedoms, the mundane achievements and routine
pleasures of last Sept. 10.</TE>
<TE>   Those among us who suffered the greatest loss Sept. 11 cling
strenuously to the strands of routine memory that connect the living
with those who drove off to work. This is what Emily learned in the
end of "Our Town."</TE>
<TE>   EMILY: "I didn't realize. So, all that was going on and we never
noticed. Take me back--up the hill--to my grave. But first: Wait! One
more look. Good-bye; Good-bye, world. Good-bye, Grover's Corners ...
Mama and Papa. Goodbye to clocks ticking ... and Mama's sunflowers.
And food and coffee. And new ironed dresses and hot baths . . . and
sleeping and waking up.... "</TE>

<KH>JOHN BALZAR</KH>
<HD>Without Good Laws, a Cesspool</HD>
<DH>Environmental rules work, Mr. Bush. Just look at the
recovery of the L.A. port's waters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Here's what we're supposed to accept: that conservationists have led
us astray and 30 years of environmental law is wrong.</LD>
<LD>   We're supposed to believe that our country's progress has been
impeded because of stifling environmental regulations. That in the
struggle between growth and preservation the deck has been stacked
against the economy. That the United States would be so much better
off if environmentalists would pipe down and get out of the way.</LD>
<LD>   I'm exaggerating the views of George W. Bush, but not by much. In
no area of public policy has this administration so energetically and
single-mindedly crusaded against regulation.</LD>
<TE>   With the notable exception of diesel emissions, the Bush team has
yet to identify a significant environmental law or standard that it
doesn't want rolled back, challenged or reconsidered, supposedly in
the name of growth and the economy.</TE>
<TE>   So a pair of news reports caught my eye last week. One came from
here on the West Coast. The other from Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The first was a comprehensive look at the seaport complex of Los
Angeles and Long Beach, the nation's busiest. This ever-expanding
spigot of globalism has become an anchor of the economy of Southern
California. Through this maze of docks, forests of cranes and webs of
rail and trucking yards, $200 billion a year in international
commerce now flows.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, this complex has been growing and booming. In the
next 20 years, ship traffic is projected to double, even triple,
enough to challenge the world's biggest ports, Hong Kong and
Singapore.</TE>
<TE>   While the old-fashioned industrialism of a working harbor will
never achieve the glamour of, say, high-tech, there is really nothing
to equal it in terms of putting meat and potatoes on the tables of
our residents. About 260,000 people owe their jobs to the port.</TE>
<TE>   And guess what? Amid all this growth and commercial enterprise,
the sheltered waters of the Los Angeles-Long Beach port have
blossomed in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Once a biological dead zone and a toxic sump, there is more life
thriving in these waters than has been seen in half a century. In an
eye-opening account, my Times colleague Louis Sahagun described a
cleaner, clearer harbor that is home to thriving populations of 67
species of fish and increasingly diversified bird life, as well as
lobsters so big they must be cradled in two arms to carry.</TE>
<TE>   How could this be?</TE>
<TE>   Sahagun's research found that the harbor "started getting cleaner
almost immediately after passage of the federal Clean Water Act and
the California Coastal Zone Conservation Act in 1972."</TE>
<TE>   The lesson: Regulation succeeds. Jobs, growth, prosperity and
mega-industrialism can occur in our biggest cities, hand in hand with
nature and conservation and a more livable world.</TE>
<TE>   Proof is in the steely green waters around the port of Los
Angeles-Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   No inflammatory, environmentalist-bashing rhetoric can dispel this
happy turn of events: A generation ago, owners of small boats used to
drop by the harbor on occasion. There was so little life-giving
dissolved oxygen in the water that just anchoring there for a few
days would kill the barnacles clinging to hulls. Today, this shallow
water habitat, with 5,500 commercial ships moving in and out each
year, is a favorite of urban fishermen.</TE>
<TE>   The second story that caught my attention takes us from the
present into the future. At issue is the 1970 Clean Air Act, a twin
of the Clean Water Act and one of the foundations of the nation's
environmental laws. (Both acts bear the signature of a Republican
president, by the way.)</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, Sen. John Edwards (D-N.C.) and former EPA
Administrator Carol Browner teamed up to call for the defeat of a
Bush administration proposal to roll back the Clean Air Act's
controls on older, high-polluting power plants.</TE>
<TE>   The deregulation crusaders of the administration have proposed and
are awaiting White House approval of a plan to give electricity
companies stalling time and loopholes before having to update these
belching, poisonous facilities. Never mind that these are the worst
polluters in an industry that is the No. 1 producer of
fine-particulate emissions, which kill 30,000 people prematurely
every year and cause the misery of asthma in hundreds of thousands
more.</TE>
<TE>   We should wish Edwards and Browner luck. If the anti-regulatory
ideology of this administration had reigned 30 years ago, there would
be no monster lobsters at the edge of our community, no mackerel, no
marsh birds, nothing but a dead and lethal cesspool.</TE>

<HD>Candidate Simon Loses the Center--and All Hope</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN IVERS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's time for the GOP to wake up to reality: Bill Simon is going to
lose the gubernatorial election in November.</LD>
<LD>   If his deepening campaign finance woes and the fraud conviction
against his company, William E. Simon &amp; Sons, were not proof enough
of the coming disaster, then his highly public flip-flops over the
Log Cabin Republicans questionnaire at the behest of a tiny faction
of right-wing extremists were the sounds of the iceberg ripping open
his last remaining airtight containers.</LD>
<LD>   The ship will go to the bottom on Nov. 5.</LD>
<TE>   It is a basic tenet of politics--so basic that every college
political science freshman knows it--that elections are won by
capturing the center.</TE>
<TE>   Every statewide poll shows that California is a gay-friendly
state, more so than almost any other, and the political center
doesn't like anti-gay politicians.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Simon doesn't get it, and neither does the party that
nominated him.</TE>
<TE>   The consequences will be serious, not only for the GOP but for the
people of California, who desperately need sound leadership after
four years of Gray Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Just look at the Log Cabin affair.</TE>
<TE>   At the center of the mess was none other than the Rev. Lou Sheldon
of the Traditional Values Coalition, who is known for only one thing
in political circles: his obsession with homosexuality.</TE>
<TE>   The vast majority of California voters don't have a problem with
gay people, and most would like to see gays treated equally in the
law. Sheldon resides, politically, on a distant planet.</TE>
<TE>   After it was revealed that Simon's campaign had completed a Log
Cabin questionnaire that took positions on gay issues that any
statewide contender would reasonably take, Sheldon was furious and
demanded that Simon repudiate it.</TE>
<TE>   Days later, Simon jumped, blaming his staff for filling out the
questionnaire despite it bearing his signature, and reversing or
muddying his positions on a range of issues all over again.</TE>
<TE>   Why Simon would so publicly cater to Sheldon, as have many
Republican candidates who have tanked at the polls before him, is
another mystifying aspect of the California GOP's malady.</TE>
<TE>   A simple review of Sheldon's political track record makes it clear
that he's the kiss of death.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Lungren, Bruce Herschensohn and Matt Fong were all candidates
who let unpopular Democrats slip into office with Sheldon's "help."
Add Simon's name to the list in about two months.</TE>
<TE>   But gay rights is only part of the picture. The California
Republican Party seems to have a serious addiction to failure.</TE>
<TE>   The White House and the national party have made several attempts
to intervene and rescue the patient, but every one has been messy and
incomplete because the patient, so far, doesn't want to be rescued.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, there is this notion that the far right represents
the Republican "base" in California and that it must be catered to at
the risk of losing a foundation of support needed to win a general
election.</TE>
<TE>   It is a fallacy.</TE>
<TE>   Solid Republicans who repudiate the likes of Sheldon tend to soar
in statewide polls; the state GOP just never lets them end up on the
November ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Those of us who still care should be preparing now for the day
after the election, when it will be time for the party to face its
problems head-on with bold solutions.</TE>
<TE>   Topping the list: Stop catering to the far right and embrace the
political mainstream once and for all. Nothing will terrify the
Democrats more, and nothing short of this will allow a Republican to
be the governor of California in the foreseeable future.</TE>

<HD>A Sept. 11 Empathy Curse</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT PINSKY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I have read many poems responding to the Sept. 11 attacks. Most of
them seem rooted not in a response to the event itself but in the
poet's sense of what one should feel or say about such an event:
something large-minded, or patriotic, or loyal, or insightful, or
moral.</LD>
<LD>   Contrary to that procedure, the art I admire most begins with some
real experience. Frank Bidart's poem "Curse," in a way shockingly,
comes from the poet's actual response to a terrible and terrifying
reality.</LD>
<LD>   The poem is just what its title says it is: a curse on the
perpetrators.</LD>
<TE>   As in the traditional Christian idea of a curse, as I understand
it, the curse attains and asserts a moral balance or standard. I
particularly admire the memorable phrase "a bubble of rectitude" for
the ecstasy of self-righteousness that let the terrorists kill
thousands of innocent people. In keeping with the Thomist or
Augustinian idea that the consciousness of sin is the sin's
punishment, Bidart wishes for the killers--or wishes upon them--a
full understanding of the suffering, loss and pain they inflicted.</TE>
<TE>   "Of your rectitude at last disenthralled," he imagines those who
committed the act, burdened at last by the terrible understanding of
what they have done, seeking their victims. He imagines the victims
spitting them out.</TE>
<TE>   Is this formulation, Bidart's moral imagining of the crime and its
just consequence, itself self-righteous? Has he constructed his own
"bubble of rectitude" for himself? His self-doubt, in the resolution
of the poem, is a moving engagement with that problem.</TE>
<TE>   Citing the notion of Percy Shelley that empathy, imagining oneself
in the skin of another, is the secret core of all morality, Bidart
acknowledges with a kind of resigned horror that what he has made of
that noble idea is a curse.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   May breath for a dead moment cease as jerking your</TE>
<TE>   head upward you hear as if in slow motion floor</TE>
<TE>   collapse evenly upon floor as one hundred and ten</TE>
<TE>   floors descend upon you.</TE>
<TE>   May what you have made descend upon you.</TE>
<TE>   May the listening ears of your victims their eyes their</TE>
<TE>   breath</TE>
<TE>   enter you, and eat like acid</TE>
<TE>   the bubble of rectitude that allowed you breath.</TE>
<TE>   May their breath now, in eternity, be your breath.</TE>
<TE>   Now, as you wished, you cannot for us</TE>
<TE>   not be. May this be your single profit.</TE>
<TE>   Of your rectitude at last disenthralled, you</TE>
<TE>   seek the dead. Each time you enter them</TE>
<TE>   they spit you out. The dead find you are not food.</TE>
<TE>   Out of the great secret of morals, the imagination to enter</TE>
<TE>   the skin of another, what I have made is a curse.</TE>

<HD>Just a Symbol, but Just Right for the Nation</HD>
<DH>Congress needs guts and a good plan in this era.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES P. PINKERTON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The special session of Congress held in Manhattan on Friday has been
slapped around in the press.</LD>
<LD>   It's a frivolous exercise in showboating and speechmaking, some
say.</LD>
<LD>   But, in fact, it took a modicum of courage for members of Congress
to go there.</LD>
<TE>   In the era of suitcase nukes and mailable anthrax, it perhaps
takes guts for Congress to assemble anywhere.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, everyone in Manhattan--or Washington, D.C., or any
other possible terrorist target--must now live with heightened risk.
And yet by going to New York on the near-anniversary of Sept. 11,
U.S. legislators not only kept faith with recent tragedy, they also
demonstrated that, in the future, American democracy could function,
if it had to, outside of Washington.</TE>
<TE>   That's a sobering but necessary thought in the era of weapons of
mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   So let the critics snipe. The senior Democrat in the Senate,
Robert Byrd of West Virginia, did not make the trip, telling Reuters,
"There is not anything I can do by going up there."</TE>
<TE>   The Hill newspaper--as in Capitol Hill--reported that New York's
congressional delegation was "trying to find events for members, such
as a New York Yankees baseball game, museums and the U.S. Open tennis
championship."</TE>
<TE>   Even the hometown newspaper editorialists, welcoming their
out-of-town guests, could not resist noting the "ceremonial" and
"largely symbolic" nature of the conclave.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, of course, ceremony has its rightful place. Billy
Collins, the poet laureate of the United States, read "The Names,"
honoring the memory of the lost, from Ackerman to Ziminsky.</TE>
<TE>   "So many names," Collins said to a hushed chamber, "there is
barely room on the walls of the heart."</TE>
<TE>   Such a reading in such a gathering can't alleviate the grief of
the grieving, but at least it's a way of saying: We are with you. You
are not alone in your sorrow.</TE>
<TE>   And symbolism isn't so bad.</TE>
<TE>   At the House of Commons in London, a statue of Winston Churchill
symbolizes his country's finest-hour resolve to oppose Nazism, no
matter what. The British prime minister is depicted standing amid the
rubble of that bomb-damaged structure, just as he did in the heroic
autumn of 1940.</TE>
<TE>   And so Congress going to New York is a signal, as well as a
symbol--that Americans are not afraid, indeed, that the nation's most
treasured democratic institutions are fully functional, even during
times of war.</TE>
<TE>   But as inspiring as Churchill's stand-fast example might be, guts
are no substitute for a good plan. That came clear to Rep. Robert
Andrews on the morning of Sept. 11. The six-term Democrat heard the
news of the airplane attacks while commuting into D.C. from his New
Jersey district. Arriving at the train station, he was greeted by
chaos: "no emergency procedures, no evacuation system." Prevented by
fretful guards from going to his office, he watched the terrible
events of that day unfold from a Capitol Hill police station.</TE>
<TE>   Norman Ornstein, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute in
Washington, was similarly troubled by the lack of a plan. His piece
for the Roll Call newspaper last October, headlined "What if Congress
Were Obliterated?," got attention.</TE>
<TE>   Among Ornstein's concerns has been the absence of a nuclear-age
system of presidential succession. If all of Washington were
destroyed, he observed in a recent interview, there might not be a
legal president of the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "Let the president pick a half-dozen governors" as ultimate vice
presidents, he suggested.</TE>
<TE>   Ornstein has created a commission to study these issues further,
even unveiling a Web site, www.continuityofgovernment.org, to
stimulate a national debate.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Andrews and all members of Congress have special phone
numbers and e-mail addresses for use in an emergency. If the
evacuation plan were to work, they would be whisked away to one of
those "undisclosed locations" where Congress--what's left of it,
anyway--could reconvene. It would be nice, of course, if all
Americans could be so carefully looked after.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Andrews and hundreds of other legislators made the
pilgrimage to Manhattan and to ground zero.</TE>
<TE>   But is it symbolism?</TE>
<TE>   "Sure, it's symbolism," Andrews answered. "It symbolizes our
commitment to their memory, and to this country."</TE>
<TE>   He has a point.</TE>
<TE>   And while Friday's session in New York was uneventful, the next
time Congress travels somewhere, it could be in the wake of an even
bigger event.</TE>

<HD>One Bone of 206</HD>
<DH>A Mother and Two Relatives Struggle to Make Sense of the
Unthinkable in a Mission to New York</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATE AXELROD</AU>
<BD>Kate Axelrod is a Los Angeles television writer, most
recently on the HBO series "The Mind of the Married Man."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The chief medical examiner's office on 1st Avenue and 30th Street in
Manhattan is stark and somber. It is the place where those who've
lost relatives come in hopes of identifying loved ones.</LD>
<LD>   I have traveled to New York with my 88-year-old grandmother, May,
and her 88-year-old cousin, Matty. Matty's 55-year-old son, Barry,
was an executive at the Port Authority, which managed the World Trade
Center. His title was risk manager. He was in charge of
insurance-related issues for the skyscrapers. His office was on the
63rd floor of the north tower. He perished Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   May can barely hear and Matty can barely see, so, I am their ears
and eyes. Matty, who has now outlived both her children, has come
here to see whether there is anything more she can learn of her son's
death.</LD>
<TE>   In a small conference room, a medical examiner sits with us at a
circular table. In his hand is Barry's file. In life, Matty's son
wore a gracious smile and oversize bifocals. Now he is known by three
numbers: a "P" number, assigned from a police report on his missing
status; an "RM" number, which will correlate with any of his remains
found; and a "DM" number, which, in this case, denotes the single
body part actually identified.</TE>
<TE>   It is, the file says, his right humerus bone--the long bone
extending from the shoulder to the elbow. This is all that is left:
one bone of 206. No skin, no muscle, no organ, no face. One bone. And
it is charred.</TE>
<TE>   "How exactly did he die?" Matty wants to know. "I have so many
images running through my mind; can you put them to rest with the
facts?" An assistant explains that "we can't make that specific
determination from such a small amount of remains."</TE>
<TE>   The medical examiner skims Barry's file, and out of the corner of
her blind eye Matty stares at him. I am convinced that she and I are
thinking the same thing--that file is rather thick for the thin
amount of information being imparted.</TE>
<TE>   "Can I take a look at that?" I ask. We didn't travel all this
way--Matty has come from Florida by train, picking up May in South
Carolina on the way, and I have flown from Los Angeles--to leave
without knowing all there is to know.</TE>
<TE>   The medical examiner hands me the file without hesitation. It
includes:</TE>
<TE>   * A death certificate issued Oct. 12, 2001, despite the absence of
any remains. Cause: homicide.</TE>
<TE>   * A document indicating the positive identification of Barry's
right humerus bone--from earth transported from ground zero Oct. 7,
2001.</TE>
<TE>   * An amended death certificate dated May 11, 2002, to show a
positive DNA identification. This came, we knew, after Matty sent a
swab from the inside of her mouth that was matched with marrow from
Barry's humerus.</TE>
<TE>   * A document dated May 13, 2002, indicating that Port Authority
officers had been dispatched to Barry's home in New Jersey to give
the now "official" news to Barry's wife.</TE>
<TE>   There isn't much more in there. And since Barry did not make one
of those wrenching cell phone calls, Matty will never know exactly
what happened to him. But since the plane hit well above his floor,
he probably survived the impact--and remained in the building to help
direct emergency operations.</TE>
<TE>   That morning, he probably felt like a captain to his injured ship,
not prepared to abandon it unless it was apparently and readily
sinking. The tower "sank" in seconds flat--something that was not
anticipated by anyone until it happened.</TE>
<TE>   Which is what the assistant now tries to use as some measure of
comfort as we leave the medical examiner's building: "The towers fell
so fast," she says. "We're certain no one inside knew what hit them."</TE>
<TE>   Matty and May seem clobbered by these words. But I'm sincerely
touched that after all this woman has been through, she still cares
enough to try to offer solace.</TE>
<TE>   The next day we head for 1 Liberty St.--a building adjacent to
ground zero. It received minimal damage and a room on the 20th floor
with a bank of windows facing east toward the site has been made into
a "family viewing room." The room is large. Every square inch is
covered with photos and notes and memorabilia from the lives of the
lost. There are Father's Day cards and wedding pictures and programs
from memorial services.</TE>
<TE>   Matty stands at the window, looking out onto the site. She is
reciting Kaddish, the Jewish prayer for the dead. She is racked. Out
loud, she asks God why he has done this to Barry, to her. She turns
and asks me how this could have happened. I, who am never at a loss
for words, have nothing to say. I just stare down at a construction
worker, a blip with a hard hat in the 16-acre crater.</TE>
<TE>   Across the room, a woman arranges flowers near the picture of a
firefighter. "That's my son-in-law. He and my daughter were married
only 11 months. Someone moved my flowers from last week, to make room
for their own, but that's OK. That's fine, really it is."</TE>
<TE>   "How is your daughter doing?" I ask. She replies, "Nothing means
anything to her anymore."</TE>
<TE>   May, stone-faced and sober, is on a chair in the corner of the
room, staring at the floor. Matty takes a photograph of Barry from an
envelope in her purse, and I tape the picture next to the others on
the wall, in history.</TE>
<TE>   At Memorial Park behind Bellevue Hospital, we are given a list of
"frequently asked questions." The pamphlet tells us we have arrived
at "the temporary resting place for victims of September 11th--a
place of peace where many have come to pay their respects--a hallowed
space where dignity reigns and a grieving nation honors its heroes."
This is nicely put, but overstated: The "hallowed space" is in fact a
large white tent with 16 big-rig trailers holding both identified and
unidentified body parts.</TE>
<TE>   It's a site for only the families. No press. No public. No
pictures. We're required to make an appointment because it's a
"working area." We are guaranteed that "there (is) no restriction of
(the) resources for the identification of human remains--(the) effort
will continue until we have exhausted the limits of science." So, for
years to come, men and women will toil over the shreds of mortality
encased in those trucks.</TE>
<TE>   We are accompanied into the tent by a chaplain, a funeral director
and two psychologists, all women. Trailer No. 1 is dedicated to men
of service, so that's where Barry is. It's as close as we get to what
remains of him. And it is the last stop on our mission.</TE>
<TE>   Matty came on this journey to "get closure." But, she laments, she
still doesn't have it. I tell her that maybe "closure" isn't
something achievable if your son is murdered in such a colossal,
monstrous, depraved display.</TE>
<TE>   So Matty lights a yartzeit candle, another Jewish commemorative
tradition used in death, and places it on the steps of Trailer No. 1.
We see that people have written on the sides of the trucks, and Matty
says she'd like to do that.</TE>
<TE>   We stand behind her, the chaplain, the funeral director, the two
psychologists, my grandmother and I. And with a black felt pen, Matty
blindly writes:</TE>
<TE>   "Dear Barry, This is not how I thought we would meet again. I can
only hope that my love for you will sustain you and your love for me
will sustain me. Love, Mom."</TE>

<HD>The Truth About Lenders and Loans</HD>
<DH>"How to Save Thousands of Dollars on Your Home Mortgage,"
Second Edition, by Randy Johnson (John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 2002),
$17.95, 270 pages.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT J. BRUSS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Every home buyer, refinancing homeowner and realty agent should read
"How to Save Thousands of Dollars on Your Home Mortgage" because it
reveals some sound insider secrets about mortgage lenders.</LD>
<LD>   Most home-loan borrowers don't get the best mortgage for their
situations, according to author Randy Johnson, who has 22 years'
experience as a mortgage broker. He says home loans are "sold" to
borrowers, most of whom don't know what they are buying.</LD>
<LD>   Only serious borrowers will study this book. The format is dull,
but the content may be extremely profitable. Writing from the
perspective of a mortgage broker who represents borrower clients, not
lenders, the author explains insider tricks some lenders use.</LD>
<TE>   "Simply put, it is easier for lenders to deal with people who are
not very knowledgeable; they can make more money from such people,"
Johnson writes.</TE>
<TE>   The book's theme is that most people get the wrong loan or pay too
much for their loan. Johnson then explains the major lender
considerations that go into creating home mortgage offerings. He
emphasizes the importance of doing business with a mortgage lender
who offers many different loan plans that can meet the needs of
buyers and owners with different loan requirements.</TE>
<TE>   If you expect this well-organized, authoritative book to tell you
which home loan is best for your personal situation, you'll be
disappointed. That decision is up to you.</TE>
<TE>   For a book that is supposed to be on the borrower's side, this one
isn't harsh enough on the home-loan lenders who take advantage of
borrowers. Perhaps the author isn't aware of all the tricks some
lenders play on borrowers.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Johnson's explanation of lender garbage or junk fees
is incomplete. He should have listed the most egregious fees some
lenders try to impose on borrowers, such as warehousing fees,
preparation fees, documentation fees, underwriting fees and even
miscellaneous fees (when the lender runs out of names).</TE>
<TE>   This book is complete in its explanation of what borrowers should
expect during their home-loan application process, but Johnson fails
to mention the upfront loan application fees some lenders charge,
whereas other lenders charge no fees. He also neglects to clearly
state whether or not borrowers should pay any upfront loan fee
points.</TE>
<TE>   In the chapter about credit, the author fails to mention how
prospective borrowers can obtain their credit report and FICO, or
Fair, Isaac &amp; Co., credit score, which most mortgage lenders use to
evaluate applicants.</TE>
<TE>   Especially valuable is the chapter titled "How Lenders Can Cheat
Their Customers." In it, Johnson explains how some lenders,
especially mortgage brokers, profit at their borrower's expense, such
as with yield-spread premiums and loan servicing fees. Most home-loan
borrowers have no clue how these profit centers work for lenders. The
author warns that mortgage regulators are of no help to borrowers who
get ripped off.</TE>
<TE>   As for using the Internet to obtain a home loan, the author isn't
enthusiastic. But the book concludes with suggestions on how to
improve mortgage lending, many of which he made in the 1997 edition
of the book.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ninety-percent of people older than 65 would prefer to remain in
their homes, but as they age, accessibility problems can become an
issue, according to a recent AARP study. Furthermore, more than 1
million U.S. households are unable to meet the structural needs of an
aging, disabled resident.</LD>
<LD>   "Accessibility and Visitability Features in Single-Family Homes"
found that four categories of state and local policy address
accessibility in single-family homes. They are builder requirements
for subsidized housing, builder requirements or incentive for
unsubsidized housing, tax or fee incentives to the consumer and
consumer awareness campaigns.</LD>
<LD>   Structural modifications that capture the most attention are those
built into subsidized housing and include features such as no-step
entrance doors, widened doors and hallways on the first floor, and
accessible climate controls and electrical outlets.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Homeowners are more likely to rack up large amounts of unsecured debt
than renters due to the burden of fixed expenses, according to a
recent index that examines debt trends.</LD>
<LD>   Average unsecured debt such as credit card and student loan debt
for homeowners decreased from $19,377 in 1998 to $17,782 in 2002,
according to the index. The lowest point for the period was at
$17,062 in 2001. The average unsecured debt for renters decreased
from $13,414 in 1998 to $12,648 in 2002, according to the Amerix
quarterly index, an analysis of consumers who call Amerix-serviced
credit counseling agencies for debt management help.</LD>

<AU>STEPHEN GLASSMAN and DONIE VANITZIAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: We live in a development of 30 townhouses with very little
common area. Our board hired a management company because homeowners
wanted to be on the board but said they didn't want to do the work.
But since that hiring, the board is doing more than ever.</LD>
<LD>   In their fervor to do their jobs, board members have become such
patrol and control freaks that we refer to them as the "condo
police."</LD>
<LD>   They are preoccupied with minutiae while the big problems remain
unresolved. Board members examine the grounds, concerning themselves
with insignificant details and looking for things to do such as
turning the sprinklers on and off five times a day, even if it ends
up killing the plants.</LD>
<TE>   They open garbage can lids and go through the trash of individual
homeowners, or spot a wire that doesn't look quite right so they whip
out their notepads and start writing. We barely have any gardening
needs, yet the board gardens everyday, even though the gardeners come
three times a week.</TE>
<TE>   The contractors used to come when needed, but now the board
tinkers along with the contractors and vendors as they work.</TE>
<TE>   The board is consumed with conducting patrols in front of our
homes, equipped with yellow notepads, soil meters, decibel counters
and other devices to assist in their patrols. Not content in
controlling the outside, they are now concentrating on what
homeowners put in their patios.</TE>
<TE>   The result is constant noise pollution and an incredible lack of
privacy. When a homeowner complains about the board's behavior, the
owner is told to "move out." Even though the other homeowners feel as
I do, I am the only one who still speaks up. The board's nitpicking
is unnerving, but what can I do about it?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Living in a common interest development can present many
challenges. Homeowners may have to contend with a board of directors
whose actual duty and perceived duties are quite different.</TE>
<TE>   Boards and members like the ones you describe believe they are
obligated to ensure all owners live in accordance with what that
board decides is appropriate. This can happen in a common interest
development when the board's duties under the Davis-Stirling Act--to
inspect, repair, replace, restore or maintain--interfere with the
imposition of personal beliefs about the use and enjoyment by
individual owners.</TE>
<TE>   There is no reason why the vendors and their workers must disturb
the quiet enjoyment and privacy of the very residents who pay their
salary.</TE>
<TE>   If in carrying out their board duties, members interfere with the
enjoyment of your unit, they can be sued. Homeowners are cautioned
about the growing expense and anxiety attached to lawsuits, however,
and litigation is recommended only as a last resort.</TE>
<TE>   Mediation and arbitration offer little alternative and should be
avoided in this circumstance because your remedy should include an
injunction barring these "patrols" from interfering with your
property and enjoyment of life.</TE>
<TE>   Write the board a concise letter explaining the problems regarding
their intrusion into your privacy and give them a deadline to
respond. Keep detailed notes of the events occurring before and after
you write.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the board is overzealously carrying out its duties is a
question that may ultimately be decided after litigation, a
disappointing reality of owning a home in a California common
interest development. California laws in the aggregate work to
protect boards and board members, not individual homeowners, thus
making it difficult for homeowners to resolve problems like yours.</TE>
<TE>   When the other owners' lives are interrupted to the extent yours
is by the noise, inspections, note taking and rummaging through
trash, you may have the support you need to take action. Unresponsive
boards have been voted out, and we know of several boards in recent
months that were replaced by homeowners fed up with the board's
treatment. Until then, existing law allows your board's nitpicking
and nerve-grating intrusions to continue.</TE>

<LD>Actress Michelle Pfeiffer and her husband, writer-producer David E.
Kelley,  have been in the process of buying the property next door to
their Brentwood home for $7 million, real estate sources say. Escrow
was expected to close after press time this week.</LD>
<LD>   The lot that the couple is buying is more than an acre in size and
has a 62-year-old house on it, according to public records.</LD>
<LD>   Pfeiffer and Kelley purchased their Brentwood home in June 2000.
They paid $15 million for the two-acre parcel, including a
six-bedroom home designed by architect Paul Williams.</LD>
<TE>   Built in the 1940s, the 7,500-square-foot house un- derwent a
major restoration after Pfeiffer and Kelley bought it.</TE>
<TE>   Pfeiffer, 44, stars as a murderer in the movie "White Oleander."
She has received three Oscar nominations, including two for best
actress.</TE>
<TE>   Kelley, 46, has won multiple Emmy Awards for such TV series as
"L.A. Law," "Picket Fences," "Ally McBeal" and "The Practice." His
newest series, "girls club," is due to debut in October on Fox.</TE>
<TE>   Impressionist-comedian Rich Little has sold his Laguna Beach home
for close to its asking price of $1.9 million. Little is building a
new home in Las Vegas, where he has been an onstage mainstay since
the '70s.</TE>
<TE>   The home he sold is behind gates and is English Cotswold in style
with views of the ocean, canyon and Catalina Island. Built in 1996,
the three-bedroom single-level house is on slightly more than 2.5
acres.</TE>
<TE>   Little, 63, keeps up a hectic performing and touring schedule,
which is one reason he decided to sell his Laguna home.</TE>
<TE>   He wrapped up a five-day stint Aug. 30 in Atlantic City, and
recently completed a three-night performance of his new play, "The
Presidents," in which he plays all the U.S. presidents from John F.
Kennedy to George W. Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Little also portrays Henry Kissinger, Jimmy Stewart, David
Brinkley, Walter Cronkite and the Rat Pack. The play is expected to
be taped and shown as a PBS special.</TE>
<TE>   Victoria Strombom and Jerry Barbanell of Re/Max Real Estate
Services represented Little in his sale, and Jordan Kyle, of the same
firm, represented the buyers.</TE>
<TE>   Actress Renee Zellweger, who purchased a Bel-Air home for about
$6.8 million in July, has put her former home in the Hollywood Hills
on the market at about $3 million. She has owned the house since
March 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Built in the 1960s, the country-style estate--reached by a long,
gated drive--was remodeled after Zellweger purchased it.</TE>
<TE>   The three-bedroom, 3,000-square-foot house now has four bedrooms,
including a master bedroom with a fireplace and a master bathroom
with a fireplace. The house, on nearly two acres, also has an office,
manicured gardens, a pool and a spa.</TE>
<TE>   Zellweger, 33, appears in the movie "White Oleander," and she
stars in the upcoming romantic comedy "Down With Love" and the film
version of the Broadway musical "Chicago," scheduled for release in
December.</TE>
<TE>   She was nominated for a best actress Oscar this year for her role
in "Bridget Jones's Diary."</TE>
<TE>   Grayhall, the Beverly Hills home built from 1909 to 1919 and
recently refurbished and expanded into a compound on about 2.5 acres,
is for lease at $125,000 a month; $100,000 a month if rented for more
than six months.</TE>
<TE>   The more than 14,000-square-foot estate has nine bedrooms, 20
bathrooms, a padded music room, a walk-in vault, a ballroom, a gym
and a sports court.</TE>
<TE>   It is owned by the estate of the late Mark Hughes, founder of
Herbalife. Actor Douglas Fairbanks leased the original home and built
a secret tunnel to oversee construction of Pickfair, his honeymoon
home with actress Mary Pickford. Actor George Hamilton owned Grayhall
before Hughes bought it.</TE>
<TE>   The compound was the first of Hughes' properties to be listed
after he died at age 44 in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes owned nearly $100 million in Southern California real
estate.</TE>
<TE>   Although it's for lease, Grayhall is still for sale at $29
million.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Hyland of Hilton &amp; Hyland, Beverly Hills, and Jerry Jolton of
Coldwell Banker, Beverly Hills, share the listing.</TE>
<TE>   Deborah G. Dixon, newly named executive director of the Actors
Studio in New York City, and her husband, Martin I. Kagan, managing
director of the 1,200-seat Ford Amphitheatre in the Hollywood Hills
and Ford Theatre Foundation, have listed their South Pasadena home at
$699,000.</TE>
<TE>   Built in 1924, the English-style home has four bedrooms and three
bathrooms in 2,555 square feet. The house has rich woods, built-in
bookcases and a Batchelder tile fireplace as well as an updated
kitchen and a master bedroom with its own bathroom, balcony and large
closet.</TE>
<TE>   The couple bought the home 10 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   They're moving because of her job change. Kagan plans to follow
his wife in moving to New York.</TE>
<TE>   Dixon spent the last 10 years in Los Angeles, working for the
Pasadena Playhouse, Walt Disney Theatricals, and Walt Disney
Imagineering and Theme Park Productions.</TE>
<TE>   Before coming to L.A., she worked at the Kennedy Center in
Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   Carol Majors at Coldwell Banker Previews, San Marino, has the
listing.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Beddor,  chief executive officer of Automatic Pictures, and
producer of such movies as "There's Something About Mary" (1998), has
purchased a Hollywood Hills home for $1.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   Beddor is renovating the home, and has expanded it from two
bedrooms and two bathrooms in 2,300 square feet to three bedrooms and
three bathrooms in 3,500 square feet.</TE>
<TE>   The mid-century modern, cottage style of the house is expected to
be maintained.</TE>

<LD>Regarding "Orderly or Oppressive?" by Julie Bawden Davis, Aug. 25:
How about some positive "Points to Consider"?</LD>
<LD>   Do you appreciate looking out on well-cared-for lawns and trees
knowing you don't have to wield a lawn mower and can still have a
patio to grow flowers? Do you like having a clean swimming pool a few
houses away so your family doesn't have to use an over-chlorinated
municipal pool?</LD>
<LD>   Financially speaking, including paying dues, don't you get more
square footage, more amenities, etc., by being part of a community
association? Are you willing to do your part by being on a committee
or serving on a board for a while so you'll have a well-run
association?</LD>
<TE>   Are you willing to live with some rules you may not be crazy about
because overall, the quality of life a community association can
provide suits your lifestyle?</TE>
<TE>   My answer to all of these is a resounding "yes."</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It was hard for me to feel much sympathy for the people living
with the restrictions imposed by common-interest developments.
Perhaps they should consider buying a townhouse in my common-interest
development.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after buying my property two years ago, I discovered the
board of directors existed in name only. The pool has no furniture
and has been closed by the health department, the tennis court
concrete is sinking and is about to fracture, fire lanes have become
designated parking, and taggers frequently grace the property with
their art.</TE>
<TE>   My petitions and letters of complaint to the management company,
local and sate agencies have been highly ineffective and have only
seemed to raise my blood pressure. To file a lawsuit would be highly
masochistic.</TE>
<TE>   I have, however, found a simple solution to this life of anarchy:
I'm moving to a single-family residence.</TE>

<LD>Home buyers and sellers must read the California purchase agreement
thoroughly. It is true that the most serious conflicts occur after
the home inspection.</LD>
<LD>   Confrontations naturally escalate when sellers do not disclose
(obvious) inoperable components such as pool heaters, garage-door
openers and cracked windows. When discovered by the buyer/home
inspector, it may appear to be a sneaky surprise.</LD>
<LD>   Listing agents must be better coaches to their clients. Buyers
must be reminded that they have agreed to purchase this home "as is."
There is no requirement for a seller to fix nonfunctional, damaged or
hazardous systems.</LD>
<TE>   The seller's disclosure statement and a home inspection should
honestly present a home's functional condition. Too many buyers have
remarked, "This is a code violation; the sellers have to fix this."
Most serious defects can be negotiated, but there is no mandate.
Mortgage lenders want a home free of termites but are less concerned
about electrical hazards.</TE>

<LD>Regarding "A Bungalow Returns to Retro," by Michelle Gringeri-Brown,
Sept. 1:</LD>
<LD>   Thank you so much for featuring this fabulous kitchen. The masses
have become enamored of granite and stainless steel, which have to be
polished like fine furniture. And those huge and so often poorly
designed islands become big walk-around obstacles that disrupt the
flow of meal preparation and cleanup. This is a beautiful and
work-friendly kitchen.</LD>

<TE>   Agoura</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As an interior designer, I am involved in "retrofitting" a
bungalow-style kitchen with a similar yellow and green tile layout.
It is refreshing to find homeowners who appreciate the intrinsic
appeal of original architectural features.</TE>
<TE>   Bigger is not always better, and remodeling projects that maintain
proportion and simplicity can be vastly rewarding for designers and
homeowners. Rediscovering the charm of early 20th century residential
design is also a great way to keep the budget manageable. Perhaps
this reflects the current trend toward basic comforts and the
eschewing of high-end consumerism.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pat Cici Jr. is well prepped to buy a house. He researches
neighborhoods, checks the rise and fall of interest rates as if he's
watching the stock market and keeps himself on such a tight budget
that he tracks every expense on a piece of paper he carries with him
in a pouch.</LD>
<LD>   "Two dollars for lunch," said his father, Pat, who chokes up every
time he thinks about his youngest child moving out of their Hacienda
Heights mobile home. "He even writes that down. He's always been like
this."</LD>
<LD>   With all his penny-pinching, the younger Cici, 32, has managed to
squirrel away nearly $20,000 while living at home with his father and
stepmother, Lea.</LD>
<TE>   In fact, he's never lived away from home--not even during his days
as a drummer for a punk rock band.</TE>
<TE>   "I could never understand throwing my money away on rent," he
said. After years of paying his folks $300 a month in rent and
utilities, he's saved enough for a down payment and wants to
capitalize on today's low mortgage interest rates.</TE>
<TE>   "I've spent most of my waking minutes [lately] thinking about
buying a house," said Cici, who stills plays drums occasionally but
now works as a project manager for a packaging company. "If I'm out
with my girlfriend, I don't want to bring her back to my one-room
'house.' I just want my own place."</TE>
<TE>   Though Cici's done all the right things to get ready to buy a
home, he couldn't have prepared for this year's sellers' market and
record-breaking prices.</TE>
<TE>   Although he hopes for a bump in salary after an upcoming review,
he takes home about $40,000 a year. That, along with only $45 a month
for a credit-card payment and $350 a month for the lease on a 2000
Chevy Silverado truck, puts Cici in the enviable position of having
excellent credit.</TE>
<TE>   "Pat is not your typical first-time home buyer," said Barron
Delaney, branch manager with H&amp;R Block Mortgage in Woodland Hills.
"He has a substantial amount of savings. Most first-time buyers
usually don't have that much."</TE>
<TE>   While Delaney might have recommended that Cici put nearly all that
$20,000 down on a home, Cici, always thinking conservatively, is
reluctant to deplete his savings. At the same time, he also feels
strongly about not paying private mortgage insurance, or PMI, a
monthly payment that protects the lender in case the borrower
defaults.</TE>
<TE>   Although most loans with less than 20% down require PMI, not all
do. Instead, these types of loans are offered at a slightly higher
interest rate in exchange.</TE>
<TE>   To meet Cici's desire to put less than 20% down yet still avoid
PMI, Delaney recommended a 30-year fixed loan of $135,000 with a 5%
down payment. The loan had an interest rate of 6.99%, slightly higher
than today's market rate, because it did not require PMI.
Additionally, the loan required a payment of 2 points--an upfront fee
paid to the lender--that amounted to $2,700.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, Delaney calculated that a similar loan requiring a
$117-a-month PMI payment would cost Cici $7,020 over five years.
However, that particular loan was offered at a lower interest rate of
6.75% and required no payment in points.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the baby he's got to weigh," said Delaney--to make the PMI
payments or take on a higher-interest loan with points.</TE>
<TE>   According to Delaney, how quickly a home might appreciate is
important to consider when deciding whether or not to pay PMI. This
is because when a homeowner has built up sufficient equity, the
lender can remove the PMI payment. Another factor to consider,
Delaney said, is the length of time the buyer plans to stay in the
home. If it's short term, PMI may not calculate as a big expense,
especially when compared with paying a higher interest rate and
points.</TE>
<TE>   But because Cici said he planned to stay put for a while,
ultimately Delaney recommended that he not take on the PMI payment.
"PMI can be a ton of money over the long term in a
slower-appreciating area," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The loan that Delaney recommended for Cici would allow him to shop
for homes around $142,000 for a monthly mortgage payment (including
principal, interest, taxes and insurance) of about $1,075, for a 45%
income-to-debt ratio--definitely on the high end, but doable. His
closing costs, including the 2 points, would be $11,897.</TE>
<TE>   But after years of saving and scrimping, Cici was disappointed.
"What the heck am I going to find for $142,000?" he asked. "I [feel
like] I will have to wait and wait until I make more money or until
the housing market comes down, and who knows when that will be?"</TE>
<TE>   To increase Cici's purchasing power, Delaney recommended that Cici
eliminate the $350-a-month lease on his truck--Cici's only real debt,
but a large payment in relation to his income. After that, Delaney
estimated that Cici would be able to shop for homes in the $180,000
range, provided he not take on any more debt.</TE>
<TE>   "That car payment is standing in your way," Delaney said. The
downside was that Cici would have to find another mode of
transportation to his job in the City of Industry--perhaps a car he
would have to pay cash for with the remainder of his savings. And
with a $180,000 loan, Cici's monthly housing payment would shoot up
to about $1,480. "He would definitely be pushing the envelope,"
Delaney said.</TE>
<TE>   Even at $180,000, Tom Rosas, a real estate agent with Century 21
Grisham Joseph in Whittier, could locate only eight townhomes or
single-family residences with at least two bedrooms in La Puente,
Norwalk and Chino Hills--all a reasonable commute to Cici's job.
There were no listings at that price in the San Gabriel Valley or
Whittier/La Habra areas where Cici hoped to buy. Cici is not
interested in condominiums, saying he feels they are too much like
apartments.</TE>
<TE>   "I really feel for the first-time home buyer right now," Rosas
said. "Interest rates are driving the market. Prices are going up
faster than people can save."</TE>
<TE>   The properties Rosas found ranged from $165,000 to $180,000. But
he cautioned: "It will be a fluke if he finds anything."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Cici was disappointed with the properties. While they were
large enough and a few had nice yards, the surrounding neighborhoods,
according to Cici, were not kept up. While Cici admitted that perhaps
he is being too critical, he knows that what he envisions is not what
he can afford.</TE>
<TE>   To put things more in line with his dream home, Rosas and Delaney
had a host of recommendations for Cici, such as buying a condo to
build equity for the purchase of a larger home later and focusing on
repossessed homes that might potentially offer some price breaks.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what the future looks like," Rosas said. "There's no
way he can save fast enough to keep up with this market unless he
wins the Lotto."</TE>
<TE>   Rosas additionally recommended that Cici look into city-sponsored
first-time home buyer programs. One such program in Whittier, where
Cici would like to live, provides $20,000 or $25,000--depending on
the area where the home is bought--to qualified first-time buyers.
Monthly interest on the loan does not have to be repaid until the
sixth year, and then only at a 5% interest rate.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, 1/15 of the principal balance of the loan is
forgiven each year after that.</TE>
<TE>   But although Cici meets the city's income limits of making less
than $46,250 for a one-person household, he may have too much money
saved up. "Everyone can't use this program," said Ann Ybarra,
director of community development with the city of Whittier. "You
can't have too much cash." The loans--about a dozen or so are funded
each year--are granted on a first-come, first-served basis.</TE>
<TE>   But the strongest advice given to Cici by all the experts was that
he lower his expectations. And that has already started to happen.</TE>
<TE>   "I fooled myself into thinking I could find something," Cici said.
"But now that I've looked, I've seen more of what is reality."</TE>

<TE>   This Month's Home Buyer Make-Over</TE>
<TE>   Home buyer: Pat Cici Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Occupation: Project manager for a packaging company</TE>
<TE>   Gross annual income: $39,500</TE>
<TE>   Goal: Cici has saved nearly $20,000 and wants to buy a
single-family residence or townhome in the San Gabriel Valley or
Whittier/La Habra area.</TE>
<TE>   The problem: Even with excellent credit and carrying little debt,
Cici's income is too low to qualify him for a suitable property in
today's seller's market.</TE>
<TE>   Recommendations:</TE>
<TE>   * Eliminate as much debt as possible to increase buying power.</TE>
<TE>   * When weighing the decision to pay private mortgage insurance or
not, consider how quickly homes in the neighborhood have appreciated
as well as how long the first-time buyer plans to live in the home.</TE>
<TE>   * Consider purchasing a condominium. Many first-time buyers use
the equity in a condo to later move up to a single-family home.</TE>
<TE>   * Seek agents who specialize in repossessed homes. While these
properties may need a little extra work, they may offer a price
break.</TE>
<TE>   * Look for city-sponsored first-time home buyer programs.</TE>
<TE>   Many cities offer them as a way to help middle-income families
purchase homes.</TE>
<TE>   Programs vary by city.</TE>

<HD>Congress Enters Mold Battle</HD>

<BD>From staff and wire reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an attempt to end the battle between insurance companies and
consumers about who is responsible for household mold remediation,
legislation has been introduced in Congress that will tackle the
myriad issues involved in the dispute.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. Toxic Mold Safety and Protection Act, introduced by Rep.
John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.), calls for government-sponsored studies to
determine the health effects of "toxic" mold exposure, the most hotly
contested issue in the debate.</LD>
<LD>   Additionally, the bill calls for standards for the prevention,
detection and remediation of indoor mold growth and provides for
local jurisdictions to modify building codes to minimize mold hazards
in new construction.</LD>
<TE>   The legislation incorporates an annual mold-inspection protocol
for rental properties, and a mold-inspection clause for properties
purchased with federally insured loans. It also calls for the
development of mold insurance pools that would cover the costs
associated with mold cleanup for those who purchase the coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer advocates greeted the proposed legislation with
enthusiasm; the insurance industry expressed cautious optimism.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very pleased that this legislation is being considered,"
said Jerry Davies, a spokesman for Personal Insurance Federation, an
insurance trade group. "The industry wants to be able to provide
policies for California homeowners, but at the rate litigation costs
have been going up, it's getting harder to do so. This is a good
beginning."</TE>

<HD>Settling Disputes Over the Fence</HD>
<DH>Before rushing off to court, try talking to your neighbor
to resolve conflict</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHELLE HOFMANN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From clucking rooster disturbance calls to lawn gnome vandalism, Don
Graham has heard it all. But when it comes to neighbor disputes, the
senior lead officer for the Los Angeles Police Department's
Devonshire division said the real culprit is lack of communication.</LD>
<LD>   "People are afraid of confrontation. Rather than talking with
their neighbor about problems over a cup of coffee, one neighbor will
cut down a tree," Graham said. "Then the other neighbor comes home
and finds his tree has been cut down [and retaliates]. It goes back
and forth when it never should have started."</LD>
<LD>   Julie L. Bronson, an administrator for the Los Angeles Superior
Court Alternative Dispute Resolution Program, one of L.A. County's 17
mediation services funded by the Dispute Resolution Programs Act of
1986, or DRPA, has seen many residential feuds escalate to irrational
levels.</LD>
<TE>   Bronson recalled a clash in which one tormented resident was
arrested for assault and battery after drenching his neighbor with
water from a garden hose during a fit of rage. Other incidents, she
said, simply defy reason.</TE>
<TE>   "I have seen cases where the neighbors got into a fight over who
had the prettiest Christmas decorations," Bronson said, "and it was
going through the court system."</TE>
<TE>   The story is familiar to Graham, who has spent seven years with
the LAPD. Although he sees neighbor squabbles escalate to violence,
he said it is not unusual for patrol officers to respond to as many
as half a dozen residential disturbance calls during an eight-hour
shift.</TE>
<TE>   "But if we have to assign detectives and follow-up investigators
and put cops on jury trials every time someone bends the neck off a
pink flamingo in somebody's yard, that's all we would be doing," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   If you don't want to move and can't build a moat around your flock
of plastic flamingos, look for peaceful solutions and know the law,
advised neighbor law expert Cora Jordan, author of "Neighbor Law:
Fences, Trees, Boundaries &amp; Noise" (Nolo; 2001).</TE>
<TE>   For example, unless a local ordinance is in place, most California
residents don't have a right to a view; a home's unsightly paint
color is not usually cause for a lawsuit; a boundary tree belongs to
both neighbors and can't be removed without an agreement; and if a
neighbor's tree or roots encroach on your property line or pose a
danger, the law usually allows the limbs or roots to be trimmed or
removed.</TE>
<TE>   Even with the law on your side, Michael Rapkin, an attorney with
Rapkin &amp; Gitlin in Woodland Hills, said you should make a
request--not a demand--and expect your neighbor to respond with a
complaint of his or her own.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than sending a nasty letter or creating a potentially
bigger problem by involving the police, Jordan said, residents should
assume the person creating the nuisance doesn't know there is one.</TE>
<TE>   "If your dog were barking all day when you were not home, you
would want to know about it, right?" she said. "So approach them that
way."</TE>
<TE>   Engage your neighbor in a general conversation on neutral
territory, such as a laundry room, lawn or sidewalk.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't bang on somebody's door," Jordan said. "Everybody wants to
defend their space, and they will get angry--no matter what the
problem."</TE>
<TE>   When rational talk fails, write a letter outlining the problem and
suggest some solutions, or enlist the support of other homeowners.</TE>
<TE>   "If something is bothering you, it is probably bothering someone
else," she said. "It is very hard to complain, but there's safety in
numbers."</TE>
<TE>   Still, when there is no common ground in sight, Rapkin said, don't
retreat; hire a lawyer to write a formal letter. "That usually
works."</TE>
<TE>   No matter what your approach, Jordan recommended keeping a
documented log of the problem--including times, dates and
severity--as a record for police or during court proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   Rapkin, who specializes in community association law, said most
residents have resolution tools at their disposal.</TE>
<TE>   Apartment dwellers, for example, can look to their lease or rental
agreement, which usually guarantees peaceful enjoyment of a
residence, and the landlord for protection against a neighbor's
annoying, unreasonable or illegal behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, residents in homeowners associations often have a
powerful resource in the board's covenants, conditions and
restrictions, or CC&amp;Rs, which are detailed rules about property
maintenance, repairs and architectural standards adopted by the board
and signed by each owner during the buying process.</TE>
<TE>   Those who violate CC&amp;Rs can be subject to formal warnings,
injunctions, fines or legal action by the board.</TE>
<TE>   Even without powerful allies waiting at the curb, residents are
protected by state statutes (www.leginfo.ca.gov) and local laws and
ordinances (www.spl.org/selectedsites/municode.html), which are
available online and through county law and public libraries.</TE>
<TE>   The codes cover animal regulations, blighted property, building
and safety issues, noise, weeds, zoning and other related topics.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan said fence issues and boundary questions are common fodder
for neighbor disputes. To avoid problems, know your boundaries. If
you don't, try to establish a clear boundary with your neighbor and
legitimize the agreement in writing. Verbal agreements, she
cautioned, often result in disagreements with subsequent owners.</TE>
<TE>   According to Jordan, a safer route is to define boundary lines and
have each neighbor sign a written agreement or quitclaim deed, which
releases one neighbor's interest in the other neighbor's property.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, Rapkin said, it is worth investing $400 to
$500--preferably jointly financed--to conduct a land survey to
determine the boundary before either resident installs a division
that could result in a trespass lawsuit, monetary damages or the
removal of the division.</TE>
<TE>   If, however, your neighbor has already started to build on the
property line, Jordan said, don't wait until he is finished to state
your case. Explain the situation and ask him to stop construction
until you can define the boundary lines.</TE>
<TE>   When the 23-year-old fence that bordered Steve Reich's home needed
replacing, the Valencia resident got quotes, found a builder and went
door to door to get neighboring property owners to agree to pay for
their share of a new slumpstone wall.</TE>
<TE>   "In essence," he said, "I became the project manager."</TE>
<TE>   To avoid getting stuck with the bill, Reich had the builder
complete a separate contract for each of the five other homeowners
along the common wall.</TE>
<TE>   As for maintenance on an existing boundary, according to
California Civil Code 841, no matter who built it, both neighbors are
responsible for the upkeep unless one landowner's property is not
completely enclosed. If, however, that landowner later adds boundary
walls and uses the existing division fence to completely enclose his
land, he is responsible for paying the original owners a fair portion
of the current value of the previously existing boundary.</TE>
<TE>   But no matter how frustrating the issue, Bronson said, before
heading to court, consider mediation. The process uses a trained
mediator as a neutral voice to help both parties reach common ground.</TE>
<TE>   "When you go to court, someone is going to say you're right and
you're wrong--and nobody likes to be wrong, so the problem often
festers," Bronson said. "But the mediation process is an opportunity
to be heard."</TE>
<TE>   From June 2000 to June 2001, L.A. County dispute resolution
program agencies reportedly fielded 46,000 dispute calls and resolved
9,690 cases; of that number, 738 were neighbor disputes.</TE>
<TE>   Although Rapkin said most cases are decided through private or
professional mediation, some neighbors still want their day in court.
Unfortunately, Rapkin said, being heard in a legal setting can cost
in excess of $30,000.</TE>
<TE>   A more practical solution is Small Claims Court, which allows
plaintiffs to self-file and often skip the legal expense and delays
associated with regular court. The damage award in Small Claims Court
is limited to $5,000, but even with higher losses, Jordan said, some
residents come out ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Before filing in Small Claims Court, Jordan said, ask the clerk
about any special procedures, watch similar cases before your
hearing, bring documentation to support your claim (photographs,
letters, police reports and copies of local ordinances), be succinct
and know the law.</TE>
<TE>   To approximate your damages, review receipts and statutes, and get
written estimates. California Civil Code 3346, for example, allows a
homeowner whose tree has been injured or removed to sue for triple
damages.</TE>
<TE>   When a specific statute does not apply, Jordan said, estimate your
losses.</TE>
<TE>   If you can't use your backyard because you are afraid that your
neighbor's tree is going to fall on your children, base your damage
amount on the daily worth of the use of your backyard--$50 or $100
per day, for instance.</TE>
<TE>   Even when prepared, Jordan cautioned, neighbors don't belong in
court.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter who wins or loses, you have to go back and live next
door to each other," Jordan said. "You can't divorce your neighbor."</TE>

<HD>Rent Is Due Despite Notice to End Tenancy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Project Sentinel</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: Just after paying this month's rent, the property manager
handed me a 30-day notice to move. When I asked for my rent check to
be returned, the manager said that I owed the rent for the month. If
I'm asked to move, do I still have to pay the last month's rent?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: The assumption that a tenant does not continue to owe rent
if the landlord terminates the tenancy is not correct. Unless you
paid "last month's rent" when you moved in, you are responsible for
paying this month's rent.</LD>
<LD>   Check your rental agreement to see what was paid as part of the
initial deposit.</LD>
<TE>   Unless the agreement states that a portion of the deposit is
allocated to "last month's rent," you probably can't claim that your
deposit covers this month's rent.</TE>
<TE>   Even if you voluntarily move before the 30-day notice expires,
rent is still due for the full 30 days. However, if the unit is
re-rented before the end of the 30-day period, you are entitled to a
refund of unused rent.</TE>
<TE>   Friend Staying in Unit Should Be Added to Lease</TE>
<TE>   Q: I just discovered that a new tenant has been paying the rent
but never moved in. He gave the apartment key to a friend who has
been living in the apartment and wants to stay. I like the friend and
have no problem with him staying, as long as the rent is paid. Is
this a problem?</TE>
<TE>   A: Yes. Someone you don't know, or have information about, has
possession of your property.</TE>
<TE>   You have two choices. First, as long as you are satisfied with the
friend staying and the no-show tenant continuing to pay the rent, ask
the friend to submit a rental application and add him to the rental
agreement. This will give you pertinent personal and financial
information you may need in the future and will state conditions of
the tenancy--for example, both parties are responsible for payment of
the rent and need to adhere to conditions of the rental agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the no-show does not live in the property, he would
continue to be your tenant and you would have to send him copies of
all notices that affect the tenancy.</TE>
<TE>   Secondly, if you don't want this extra work, you could end the
no-show's tenancy with a 30-day notice of termination of tenancy and
continue solely with the friend.</TE>
<TE>   Once approved, the friend would sign his own rental agreement and
become solely responsible for the tenancy along with payment of the

<TE>   Manager Cannot Charge for Application Form</TE>
<TE>   Q: Three months ago I moved into my apartment and paid the first
month's rent, as well as a security deposit.</TE>
<TE>   The resident manager is now requesting that I pay an additional
fee of $10 for the application form I completed. At the time I
applied, I paid $25 for a credit check, but I've never heard of being
charged an application fee.</TE>
<TE>   A: Tenants cannot be charged for filling out a rental application.
California Civil Code 1950.6 limits the amount of fees that can be
charged during the process of approving a prospective tenant. Only
"actual out-of-pocket costs," plus a reasonable value for time spent,
can be charged.</TE>
<TE>   The maximum fee allowed for a credit report is $30 per applicant.</TE>
<TE>   Civil Code 1950.6 also gives you the right to ask for a receipt
for the fee paid as well as a copy of the credit report.</TE>
<TE>   Because you paid $25 before moving in, and were not requested to
make other payments, it would seem that no additional charges are
allowed. But if other reports such as criminal or eviction background
checks were performed, you could have been asked to pay for these
services at the time you applied.</TE>
<TE>   Attempting to retroactively charge additional fees is not allowed
once a tenancy has been established.</TE>

<HD>To Play or Not to Play?</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Many believe games should not be played, others
say they should go on as clubs pay tribute to those who lost their
lives on Sept. 11.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN WALKER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Franco stacked medical supplies and Joe McEwing drove a
forklift. They worked side by side with other New York Mets wearing
"FDNY" and "NYPD" caps in the parking lot at Shea Stadium, a staging
area for the relief effort at ground zero.</LD>
<LD>   Yet even now, a year after visiting hospitals, comforting families
and tirelessly trying to help ease the city's pain, the teammates
find themselves on different sides of a most difficult issue.</LD>
<LD>   Should games be held on Sept. 11?</LD>
<TE>   "Personally, I think we shouldn't play. I think we should pay
tribute to the victims," Franco said.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," McEwing offered. "Baseball, being our pastime, it's
something that should be done to take our minds off the day."</TE>
<TE>   The games will go on, with all teams in action Wednesday on the
one-year anniversary of the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, Commissioner Bud Selig had to make the call. Most
major leaguers agreed with the decision.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's important to play, for the same reason the president
said it was important to try to get things back to normal," Selig
said. "It's a sensitive question, and I can see both sides. It's very
personal. There's no right or wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "If fans want to come to a ballpark, gather in a public place as
they did last year--like a catharsis--and sing 'God Bless America,'
then they can. If they want to stay at home and have a quiet time of
reflection, I completely understand that."</TE>
<TE>   There will be 16 games Wednesday, including a day-night
doubleheader between the Mets and Atlanta Braves at Turner Field. At
every ballpark, there will be tributes to the victims and those who
tried to rescue them.</TE>
<TE>   Games will pause at 9:11 p.m. local time for a moment of silence,
to be followed by a video presentation honoring those who died. A
design featuring the words "We Shall Not Forget" will be placed on
the field, outfield walls and bases--all fans will be given T-shirts
with that emblem and encouraged to wear them.</TE>
<TE>   Several miles from the World Trade Center site, a plaque will be
hung at Monument Park at Yankee Stadium before New York plays
Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the place you really want to be at that time," Oriole
reliever Buddy Groom said. "The place is going to be packed, and
there's going to be something special done there to honor the
victims.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we should play," he said. "It was a tragic thing and it
affected a lot of lives and a lot of families. But this is a way that
we can honor those people."</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis manager Tony La Russa agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's a national holiday, where everything is shut down, then
we shouldn't be playing. But if people are going to work, as they
are, then we should do what we normally do," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, baseball paused for six days after the attacks. Then,
awash in red, white and blue, the games returned.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota Twins closer Eddie Guardado said he thought there should
be no games on Sept. 11. He favored a day off, a time for people to
reflect with their families.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tough question. For me, that day should be a holiday," he
said. "I'm going to be praying for people. It's going to be a sad day
for everybody."</TE>
<TE>   The day holds special significance for Chicago White Sox coach Art
Kusnyer and catcher Josh Paul. They were in New York last Sept.
11--Kusnyer was walking around in midtown and saw one of the towers
collapse and Paul lost a friend in the tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there should be baseball on that day. They shut it down,
those terrorists. We should play in honor of all of those people that
perished on that terrible day," Kusnyer said.</TE>
<TE>   Paul concurred.</TE>
<TE>   "If people want to spend their day enjoying a ballgame, why not? I
don't think it's disrespectful," he said. "We play on Labor Day. We
play on Memorial Day. We play on all those other days. It was
different a year ago when it happened. Now why can't we just move on?
That's my feeling."</TE>
<TE>   The White Sox start a series in New York on Sept. 13. Kusnyer and
Paul have different schedules for the weekend stay.</TE>
<TE>   Paul plans to visit the site, Kusnyer will not.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd rather just remember the sight of the buildings still
standing," Kusnyer said.</TE>
<TE>   The date already is significant in baseball history.</TE>
<TE>   The Boston Red Sox won their last World Series championship on
Sept. 11, 1918, beating the Chicago Cubs in Game 6 at Fenway Park.
Pete Rose broke Ty Cobb's career hits record with No. 4,192 on Sept.
11, 1985. Ellis Burks' birthday is Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Griffey Jr., like many ballplayers, can see all sides to this
year's question.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody knows. That's the biggest thing," the Cincinnati star
said. "It's going to be tough that day. We'll see."</TE>
<TE>   Met star Mike Piazza, who left Shea a few days ago holding a book
of photos of ground zero, felt the same way.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tough issue to try and strike a balance. I was kind of
split down the middle," he said. "Pearl Harbor Day is observed in a
sense that it is a day of reflection and remembrance, that's what it
should be."</TE>

<HD>Members-Only Jacket Outdated at Augusta</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BOSWELL</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When boys build a neat treehouse, "Members Only" is the first sign
that goes up. Though, at the age when such things matter, the "s" in
"members" may be printed backward. You need a special handshake,
maybe give a drop of blood. As for icky girls, they can't come in at
all. The most famous treehouse in America for little boys of all ages
is located in the Georgia pines of Augusta. It's "Spanky and Our
Gang" for millionaires. Even Billy Gates, the rich kid, wants to
join. But they won't let him in. Maybe if he lowers his handicap.</LD>
<LD>   Now--and this has really got Spanky, Alfalfa and Hootie spitting
on their cowlicks and getting rocks for their slingshots--the girls
want to join the club. OK, just one girl, maybe. But that would be
enough to spoil the whole effect. Why, she might show up any time.
Even when you're boiling a frog. What fun is that?</LD>
<LD>   These days, it's amazing to watch the escalating playground
politics between the wealthy men of Augusta, who've worked up a high
moral outrage because their treehouse may be invaded, and the
insistent National Council of Women's Organizations.</LD>
<TE>   Martha Burk, chairwoman of NCWO, has done her job. She's supposed
to put social and economic pressure on real, or symbolic,
discriminators against women. The Masters, with its horrid record for
decades on racial discrimination, is as symbolic as it gets.</TE>
<TE>   Augusta Chairman William (Hootie) Johnson responded to a letter
from Burk, pushing for a woman member by the next Masters, by going
ballistic. Open mouth, insert soft spikes. The Masters wouldn't be
"intimidated" or yield to pressure. Their timetable would be their
own. And, by the way, women play a thousand rounds a year at Augusta
already. (OK, that's three a day.) How's that for progress? If your
husband is a member, you can even tee off before noon. Just like an
actual ... well ... man.</TE>
<TE>   Next, Burk went to the Masters' TV sponsors--IBM, Coca-Cola and
Citigroup--to see how they felt about being associated with a club
that excludes women members. Standard arm twisting. Welcome to
America. As if all the CEO members at Augusta don't do the same thing
to further their interests in business every day.</TE>
<TE>   The Masters went double ballistic. They told IBM, Coca-Cola and
Citigroup that they were no longer needed. Think we can be pressured?
Just watch. The Masters would foot all its own bills, do without TV
sponsors and broadcast 12 hours of Masters coverage without a single
commercial.</TE>
<TE>   ''I'm surprised at the amount of money they are willing to pay to
continue to discriminate against women,'' said Burk, who must want to
nominate Johnson as Man of the Year for all the help he's been. You
can't buy PR like this for any price: A man named ''Hootie'' thinks
there's no woman on earth worthy of his club.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, Burk has chewed her way up the food chain and is now
calling of pro golfers to take a ''moral stand.'' This should be
interesting. The average PGA pro, including Tiger Woods so far,
thinks that moving your ball in the rough should be punishable by
death, but solving world hunger isn't in his domain.</TE>
<TE>   CBS says it hasn't gotten an earful from Burk yet. Turn up your
hearing aides, guys. That's Martha beating on the wall. And the noise
is only going to get louder.</TE>
<TE>   There's a solution to all this. And it's easy. Come on, Hootie,
just take a mulligan. You've hit one 50 yards out of bounds.
Everybody knows it. Don't try to pretend you're going to find your
ball. Go back to the tee. Take your medicine. And try to hit the next
one in the fairway. Why not call Nancy Lopez, who lives in Atlanta?
She can afford the initiation and dues. Her husband, Ray Knight, the
ex-World Series MVP, would faint with joy. She can play the back
tees. Ray can move up.</TE>
<TE>   So far, most of the criticism of the Masters has been of the
joshing, eye-rolling variety. But it's important that Johnson, who's
normally sensible, understand the seriousness of what he's facing. If
he doesn't regain his senses pretty soon, he's going to feel like
he's been run over by a truck. Of course his position is technically
correct. "This is not a legal issue," the club wrote to ESPN this
week, offering "talking points" in its defense. "The Masters has a
constitutional right to its private membership."</TE>
<TE>   That's true. And so what? If you step in the street when the sign
says, "Walk," but a 16-wheeler is coming at you, do you jump out of
its way? Or do you say, "It's legal for me to stand here."</TE>
<TE>   In the scheme of things, equal rights for women is one of the most
fundamental social issues in history. The women's movement, like all
"causes," will presumably manifest itself in ways that range from
profound to frivolous. Fighting with the Masters probably falls in
the middle.</TE>
<TE>   But what "cause" is Augusta National fighting for? Hootie and his
Blowhards, as they're now being called nationwide, appear to be
defending the right of rich guys in ugly jackets to thumb their noses
at anybody anytime, while throwing money at any problem.</TE>
<TE>   Burk is on a collision course with Johnson, but she's blowing her
horn to warn him. Hootie, head down, is peddling his tricycle as fast
as he can right at her big rig. Champions dinner: Road kill.</TE>
<TE>   Once, Augusta National allowed itself to be seen--perhaps even
enjoyed being seen--as one of the last brazen symbols of racial
discrimination in America. Back then, the club learned what the full
weight of negative public opinion felt like. It bent. It changed, to
a degree. And the Masters has been better for it. With the years,
with Lee Elder's arrival and Tiger Woods' three victories, it's
become easier to let Augusta National's leaders off the hook.</TE>
<TE>   However, the club can put itself right back in the nation's
crosshairs.</TE>
<TE>   An all-male golf club is constitutional. But if the Masters also
wants to remain the most popular golf tournament in a half-male
world, it's far from smart.</TE>

<LD>I love the elegant new metallics ("Bewitched, Bothered and
Bedazzled," Women's Fall Fashion Issue, Aug. 18), but what a pity to
disgrace the look by showing them with real fur! There is nothing
glamorous about contributing to the pointless deaths of animals.
Nothing could be more dazzling than compassion and respect for all
creatures. Let's show our true glamour by avoiding real fur.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Preston Lerner's article ("Crunch Time," Aug. 11) said that the
biggest gravitational waves are produced by events such as the
collision of two black holes, and then another paragraph said that
the interferometer may be able to measure gravitational waves from a
"distant universe." Is the intent of the project to measure
gravitational waves within our universe, or has it been determined
that there are other universes and we are trying to measure
gravitational waves from them?</LD>

<LD>What a funny idea that your city would feel pompous enough about
yourself, your smog, your crime, your poverty and your unemployment
rates to print such a negative article on Seattle ("The Decline and

your own yard and clean it up before you point fingers elsewhere.</LD>

<HD>The Long Road Home</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Compiled by Catharine Hamm, Craig Nakano and Rosemary McClure</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They were on airplanes heading home from Europe. They were visiting
Machu Picchu in Peru. They were sunning in Maui, honeymooning in
Istanbul.</LD>
<LD>   Readers of The Times' Travel section were scattered to the corners
of the globe on Sept. 11, and in letters, faxes and e-mails, more
than 400 of them shared their tales of how that day affected their
plans--and their lives.</LD>
<LD>   All spoke of the horror of learning the news--from tour guides or
shop owners, from strangers who did not speak English but used an
improvised sign language to depict planes crashing into the World
Trade Center. The news came by cell phone, e-mail, radio and TV and
spread "like wind gusting across a wheat field," Peggy Stout of Los
Angeles wrote of the crowded square in Florence, Italy, where she
first realized something was wrong.</LD>
<TE>   For many, then came the pull toward home. Those in the air were
grounded. Those on the ground wanted to be in the air to return to
loved ones. Thwarted, many rented or bought a car, boarded a train or
took a bus for the long journey home. Travelers abroad, who were
stuck until air traffic began moving again, and those who took to the
highways and the rails sounded a common theme: the kindness of
strangers who offered them maps, room, board and, perhaps most
important, solace and comfort.</TE>
<TE>   "The events of 9/11 may have been directed at Americans, but the
sadness and emptiness that followed were felt around the world,"
wrote Shyrl Roberts of Irvine, who was in Bali in heavily Muslim
Indonesia at the time of the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   When they finally made it home, grateful to strangers and thankful
to feel the embrace of loved ones, they found a renewed appreciation
for their country and for the freedom to travel. Courtney Romine of
Garden Grove and friends were in Rome on Sept. 11. The trip
strengthened her resolve to see the world. "We are determined," she
wrote, "not to be afraid to live."</TE>
<TE>   Flight Interrupted</TE>
<TE>   I was attending a conference and was scheduled to return to Los
Angeles on the morning of Sept. 11 on United Flight 114 out of Reagan
Washington National Airport, connecting through Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   At 9:17 a.m., while taxiing to the runway for takeoff, I listened
to the air traffic controller on the plane's audio entertainment
system. The conversation went something like this:</TE>
<TE>   Tower: Attention all aircraft bound for the New York area, there
is a hold on all New York-bound planes. That airspace is now closed.</TE>
<TE>   United: Do you know what the problem is?</TE>
<TE>   Tower: No sir, I have not heard.</TE>
<TE>   Another pilot: My wife just called me on my cell phone to tell me
that an airplane has hit the World Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   Tower: Roger, all right, all westbound airplanes, you are the
lucky ones today. Westbound traffic is still cleared for takeoff.</TE>
<TE>   Hearing this, I assumed that a small private plane had struck the
World Trade Center. No one seemed overly concerned, and we took off
about 9:20. The plane lifted off and I looked out at Washington, D.C.
I had a great view of the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   I settled in for the ride and didn't give the crash much more
thought. Then the seat-belt light came on, even though there was no
turbulence.</TE>
<TE>   The captain addressed passengers. Again, to the best of my
recollection:</TE>
<TE>   "Ladies and gentlemen, this is the captain speaking. I am
instructing all of you to stay in your seats with your seat belt
fastened. You are not to get up for any reason. You are not to access
your luggage in the overhead bin. You are not to move from your seat
for any reason. This is not a request."</TE>
<TE>   We started to descend. Then the captain again:</TE>
<TE>   "Ladies and gentlemen, the FAA has just ordered a grounding of all
aircraft operating in the United States. There has been a coordinated
terrorist attack using commercial airplanes, and we will be landing
shortly. Please stay in your seats and follow the instructions of the
crew."</TE>
<TE>   We descended quickly, and I tuned back into the air traffic
control radio. We were instructed to line up for landing in
Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   Later that day, after numerous calls and persistent begging, I got
a rental car and headed back to Los Angeles. I listened to National
Public Radio most of the trip. Almost every area along the way seemed
to have an NPR station, so I had familiar correspondents to keep me
up to date.</TE>
<TE>   Driving back, I was struck by the number of flags already being
displayed from overpasses and buildings. They were everywhere. It was
also apparent that I was surrounded by rental cars driving west.</TE>
<TE>   The drive was therapeutic. I realized that though there are many
variations in culture between New York City and Los Angeles, everyone
was hurting for our friends on the East Coast.</TE>

<TE>   Fates Unknown</TE>
<TE>   We were vacationing in London and boarded a sightseeing bus during
a day trip in Cambridge. Only two other passengers were on the top
deck: one woman and her friend, who was sobbing. "Did you hear what
happened in the United States today?" the woman asked. We had not.</TE>
<TE>   The woman told us what she had learned about the attacks. She then
informed us that her friend's son worked in one of the twin towers,
and that they had spoken earlier in the day by phone.</TE>
<TE>   We felt so helpless trying to render comfort. The bus reached our
rail station, and we returned to London on the same train as the two
women. They still didn't know the fate of the sobbing woman's son. We
can only wonder.</TE>

<TE>   Hoisting the Flag</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 8, my wife, Jacqueline, and I, along with three other
couples, began a two-week self-drive barge trip on the canals of
Holland. The 50-foot barge had four cabins and a full galley, but no
radio or TV aboard.</TE>
<TE>   On previous barge trips in the Netherlands, France and Germany, we
often stopped for lunch at small restaurants along the canals and
rivers. With light rains on Sept. 11 we decided to eat our midday
meal on board. Our destination was the town of Purmerend, near Edam.</TE>
<TE>   As we prepared to dock that evening, a young Dutch woman, spotting
the American flag flying from the barge, said very excitedly, "They
are bombing America!" At first I thought she was a bit deranged. Then
another woman, on a second-story balcony overlooking the canal,
corrected her, shouting, "No, they are bombing New York!" We knew
then that something dreadful had happened, but we weren't sure what.
Just then a young man came up to us and in excellent English
described the tragic events at the World Trade Center. He invited us
to his place of business, where the television was tuned to an
English-speaking news network. There, in a little Dutch pizza parlor,
we watched replays of those horrific attacks. The name of the
restaurant? New York City Pizza.</TE>
<TE>   Because we couldn't fly home, we elected to continue our trip,
knowing that it would no longer be the pleasure cruise we had
embarked on. But our spirits were buoyed by support and empathy along
the way.</TE>
<TE>   One morning we cruised into Alkmaar, which is known for its cheese
auctions. We had read that at noontime all of Europe would observe a
moment of silence.</TE>
<TE>   At the appointed hour all the cars on the road parallel to our
canal came to a halt. In the car nearest our barge, a woman, spotting
our American flag, openly sobbed.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of removing our flag, as someone had suggested, we decided
to fly it prominently. In fact, we may have hoisted it just a little
higher.</TE>

<TE>   The Music Stopped</TE>
<TE>   I was playing piano in the Bar Casablanca in the Hyatt in
Casablanca, Morocco. There are numerous TVs, all playing the film
"Casablanca," from which the bar takes its inspiration. The sound is
usually turned down, and I play and sing for the guests. (I am not
the Sam from the movie "Casablanca"--that was Dooley Wilson--but I
did audition for the part, which I didn't get because I was too
young.) The movie stopped, and we watched the events in horror.</TE>
<TE>   I'm 83 1/2, and I wish we could go back to a kinder, gentler time.</TE>

<TE>   Horror by Cell Phone</TE>
<TE>   We were on vacation in the Australian capital city of Canberra,
about 11 hours ahead of New York. We didn't learn of the attacks
until early Sept. 12, local time.</TE>
<TE>   We got up at 5 a.m. for a balloon ride, and when we went to call
for a weather update, we found four text messages from family and
friends on our cell phone.</TE>
<TE>   The first text message relayed news about an explosion at the
World Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   The second message said the second tower had been attacked.</TE>
<TE>   The third message said one of the towers had fallen, and the last
message said the other tower had collapsed too.</TE>
<TE>   It was a terrifying moment--far from home, standing in a dark
room, the lights of a cell phone delivering the news.</TE>
<TE>   CHRIS and VIONNETTE SELLERS</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   Like a '40s Movie</TE>
<TE>   My cousin and I had one day left on our New York vacation before
we were to return to Los Angeles. And then the phone call came
telling us to turn on the TV.</TE>
<TE>   The following days were filled with chaos, confusion and
questions. Can we get out? Can we get a call through to the airlines?
Is the flight canceled? Can we get on another? How about other
airports in the state, such as Islip or Westchester? Hartford, Conn.?
Ontario? Long Beach? Palm Springs? The options were endless, but the
answers were always the same: No.</TE>
<TE>   After four days, we were able to book two seats on a train. When
the porter took us aboard and settled us into our seats, I sobbed in
his arms. After so many days of struggling, someone was finally
helping me and I was going home. I was deeply moved.</TE>
<TE>   Union Station in Chicago, where we changed trains, was like a
scene out of a '40s war movie: huge crowds and chaos. When we finally
were on board the Los Angeles-bound train, the passengers coalesced.
Eventually we began to enjoy the 3 1/2-day journey, despite the
discomfort of trying to sleep in an upright position and too little
food for too many passengers. (We had pizza delivered at our stop in
Albuquerque.) Our car ultimately became like the most popular bunk at
summer camp. We played charades and Scrabble and sang. We warbled
"God Bless America" through Illinois and Missouri, "The Star-Spangled
Banner" through Kansas, "Battle Hymn of the Republic" in New Mexico
and Arizona and "California, Here I Come" as the palm trees of Los
Angeles' Union Station came into view.</TE>
<TE>   As we pulled into the station, my husband, Ed, and I searched for
each other with the help of our cell phones. When we finally saw each
other, we ran toward each other, crying. To finally hug him and my
children was one of the greatest gifts I have ever received.</TE>

<TE>   Going the Extra Mile</TE>
<TE>   My husband, Ignacio, had always wanted to go to Spain, and I
wanted to go to Morocco. So I surprised him with a package trip to
both places and to Portugal. We were in the Strait of Gibraltar on a
ferry, on the way back from Morocco, when we heard the news.</TE>
<TE>   That night we tried for hours to get through to the United States
and talk to our three small children. Unbeknownst to us, Howard
Lewis, our travel agent at Chartwell Travel in Los Angeles, and his
crew had begun trying to track down their clients. They worked into
the early hours of the next day. Howard even called my mother and
spoke to our children individually, telling them not to worry and
that he knew we were safe because he had spoken to the clerk at our
hotel. In fact, he called them every day to reassure them that we
were safe until we returned home.</TE>
<TE>   At each hotel we stayed in, Howard had a fax waiting for us saying
that he had spoken to our children and that everyone was fine.</TE>
<TE>   We were deeply indebted to Howard, whom I have never met face to
face. I offered to wash his car for life, baby-sit his kids for free,
anything to show how much what he did meant to our family. He laughed
it off, saying it was all in a day's work.</TE>

<TE>   A Toast to the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   My friends and I were on vacation in Italy, where we stayed at
Palazzo Terranova, a beautiful old place high in the hills of Umbria.
The palazzo is owned by a lovely British woman, Sarah Townsend.</TE>
<TE>   We had spent the day in Perugia and returned to the palazzo to
this horrible news. We tore ourselves away from the TV for dinner, a
four-course affair cooked by the owner's daughter, Honor. On this
night, the owner had invited British friends to join us. One was a
gentle, white-haired man who had served in the British army during
World War II. Before the meal was served, he stood up to speak. He
raised his glass and talked about America. He spoke of American
ideals, liberties and freedoms. He talked about how America had stood
behind the British in their time of need during the world wars, and
how today they and the free world stood behind us. He raised his
glass in a toast to our nation and said, "God Bless America." It was
a moment I'll always remember.</TE>

<TE>   Celebration, Then Sorrow</TE>
<TE>   We were married the evening of Sept. 9 in Manhattan Beach. It was
a great but exhausting day, and we were looking forward to our
honeymoon in Jamaica after months of planning the wedding. The night
of Sept. 10, we boarded a flight from LAX to Jamaica with a
layover--in New York. Our plane landed about 7 a.m. at JFK. As I
returned from getting a magazine, a man stopped me and pointed out
the window to the towers, smoke pouring from them. News reports were
just beginning to come in. First, our flight was canceled, but it was
rescheduled for the next day. Then it was canceled altogether. We
were waiting to get hotel vouchers when the Port Authority closed the
airport and we were forced out with no bags and nowhere to go, along
with thousands of other confused travelers. After trying several
hotels, all unsuccessfully, we ended up at a place so seedy that it
rented by the hour and had a condom machine in the lobby. But we were
just thankful to have a room.</TE>
<TE>   We ended up renting a car, driving to my mother's house in
Baltimore and flying back from there. We never did make it to
Jamaica.</TE>

<TE>   Undeterred</TE>
<TE>   To celebrate my company's 10th anniversary, my bosses flew the
entire office to our headquarters in Geneva. After a fantastic
weekend, most of my colleagues flew home Sept. 10, but I planned to
spend three days in Weggis, a town near Lucerne where my husband,
Bob, and I had stayed on our honeymoon two years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   On 9/11 I spent a leisurely day in Lucerne revisiting favorite
shops and dining in familiar restaurants. That afternoon I took the
paddle steamer back to Weggis. After the boat docked, I followed a
small group of tourists into a shop. From the clerk's hand gestures,
I could see she was telling an animated story about a plane flying
into a building.</TE>
<TE>   The clerk noticed I was watching and asked, "Are you American?" I
nodded and she said, "Terrorist ... (hand gesture of plane) ... fly
... World Trade Center." The woman then frantically directed me to
the TV shop next door, where the clerk fumbled to find an English
news broadcast for me. Then, there it was--a long shot of a
smoldering Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   I finally got a flight back to the United States on Sept. 20.
Looking back, I was blessed. My husband, loved ones and co-workers
were safe. And if you are going to be stranded somewhere, you can do
a lot worse than the land of chocolate and neutrality.</TE>
<TE>   On the first anniversary of the 9/11 disaster, I am again
traveling to Switzerland. I can't think of a more appropriate way for
me to remember that day than to travel, which is my bliss.</TE>

<TE>   The Face of America</TE>
<TE>   We took off from JFK to LAX about 8:40 a.m. Our plane was almost
empty. The pilot came on and said that there had been a "terrorist
incident" in the Northeast and that we would be landing in Columbus,
Ohio. We were grounded for several days.</TE>
<TE>   We went shopping at a small kosher market, and a woman asked me if
I was visiting. "No," I said, "we are part of the group that had to
land here because of the terrorists."</TE>
<TE>   "Do you need a place to stay?" this stranger asked me. "You can
stay at my house." I started to cry. As we left, she came running out
with a bag of cookies and nuts. "Have a safe trip home," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Everywhere we stopped--every truck stop, every gas station, every
coffee shop--people asked us what we needed, where were we going.</TE>
<TE>   On the road it didn't matter if we were Jewish, black, white,
yellow, green or purple--it was America at its very best. It was as
though we really were from the same family.</TE>
<TE>   ANDY and JACKIE STERN</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   A Company Connection</TE>
<TE>   At 9:15 a.m., our cell phone rang in our hotel room in Seattle.
Our daughter in Los Angeles was on the other end crying and saying
over and over, "We're at war! They've attacked the World Trade
Center!" I asked my wife to turn on the television. There it was, in
all its terror.</TE>
<TE>   As we watched the tragedy unfold, it was obvious that we wouldn't
be getting on a plane any time soon. We discovered that other modes
of transportation weren't available. We spent the next week with
Seattle relatives sharing in the nation's tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   By Sept. 19 it looked as if standby seats were available, so we
went to the airport. We had cleared the long security line and were
waiting for one of the underground airport trains when I saw a female
pilot and noticed that she was a first officer with the same company
our son, Kris, worked for on the East Coast. I introduced myself and
told her about our company connection. She and our son flew out of
Washington's Dulles airport, but she hadn't met him.</TE>
<TE>   The next time I spoke to Kris, I told him about the interesting
first officer we had met. He indicated that he might have seen her in
the crew room and asked me her name. I hadn't thought to ask.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks later we received a call from our son. His first words
were, "Her name is Kerstin, and we had dinner together last night."</TE>
<TE>   They recently visited us in Los Angeles, and Aug. 12, we received
an even better call that began: "Kerstin and I are engaged." Even out
of something as tragic as Sept. 11, beautiful beginnings can emerge.</TE>

<TE>   First Time in the Big Apple</TE>
<TE>   To celebrate our 42nd wedding anniversary, we planned a trip to
visit friends in Europe preceded by a five-day stay in New York City.
We had never been to the Big Apple.</TE>
<TE>   We arrived Sept. 10 and checked into our hotel, the Vanderbilt
YMCA, and then planned the next day: arrive at the World Trade Center
by 9 a.m., in time to purchase half-price tickets for Wednesday's
plays. Then we would continue to the observation deck on the 107th
floor in Tower 2, and from there tour Ellis Island, the Statue of
Liberty and Liberty Hall.</TE>
<TE>   That morning my husband, Tom, was running late, and we left the
hotel 15 minutes behind schedule. On the subway, the conductor
reported we would not be stopping at Fulton Street. We had no idea
what or where Fulton Street was, but some of the others seemed
worried.</TE>
<TE>   At the next stop a young man got on with a radio and said that an
airplane had hit the World Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   We came to the last stop, and as we were walking up the stairs, we
heard a loud boom. The World Trade Center was on fire, and we believe
the boom we heard was the second plane hitting.</TE>
<TE>   We walked closer and could see all the debris. Someone said we
should move away, so we followed others to Battery Park and looked
out at the Statue of Liberty and New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   People on cell phones would relay news like, "Planes hijacked,"
"The Pentagon was hit" and "A plane was on the way to the White
House."</TE>
<TE>   The fire spread rapidly, and we saw and heard the building
collapse. People began screaming and running from the cloud of ash.
We headed to the river, where some jumped or fell in.</TE>
<TE>   Tom and I helped a young couple with a baby about 5 months old.
The father put the baby under his shirt, and we helped the mother
with the stroller. We came to a chain-link fence and were trying to
get around it when the crowd surged and pushed us against it. We fell
and the fence broke, causing even more panic. We managed to get off
the ground and ran with the crowd to the river's edge, where someone
was yelling to stop and lie on the ground. Everyone did. It was
difficult to see and breathe.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually a ferry came. We had to climb a 4-foot fence to board
it. When the ferry was full, we pulled away, and the captain yelled
to the remaining crowd that he would be back. I can still see the
people on shore standing, quiet and waiting.</TE>
<TE>   Four people sitting in front of us had walked down from the 13th
floor of one of the towers. They were covered with ash.</TE>
<TE>   When we landed in Jersey City, we looked across the water and were
astonished to see the cloud of smoke. We were told to keep walking,
and we did, following the crowd toward the train station in Hoboken.
When we got to the station, all traffic was closed and emergency
personnel were setting up a triage for the injured. The police told
us to walk to town, so we set off for downtown Hoboken.</TE>
<TE>   We ended up at City Hall, which had SWAT team members guarding it.
From there we were directed to the police station, but when we
arrived it was closed, with guards posted outside. They suggested we
walk to Hackensack. My legs wouldn't go that far.</TE>
<TE>   We returned to the train station, but it was now cordoned off.
Some people were looking at my clothes, and I finally noticed we were
covered with ash too.</TE>
<TE>   I looked at our map trying to figure out where we were. Two young
women came up to us, asked if we were tourists and gave us their name
and phone number in case we needed a place to stay. Soon another
couple came by and offered their home as well.</TE>
<TE>   Two policemen came running around the corner yelling for us to
run. (It was a bomb scare.) We saw the couple who had offered their
home, so we ran to them. They took us down an alley and up to their
apartment for coffee, strawberry cake and much-needed rest.</TE>
<TE>   Linda and Mike were their names, and they called around to see
what was available for lodging. All hotels were booked, so they
walked us to the Hoboken Community Center, where we were met with
welcome arms.</TE>
<TE>   We stayed until Wednesday morning. The people of Hoboken were
gracious to us. Restaurants sent food to the center, the gym was set
up for sleeping, and we were offered toothbrushes, toothpaste,
blankets--and most of all, kindness. We were also able to use a phone
to call our children and grandchildren, who were going crazy with
worry.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday morning we rode a train into midtown Manhattan and
walked back to our hotel. We spent the rest of our time in the city
just walking around and riding the bus and running from bomb scares.
Day and night we could hear the jets patrolling the skies and the
sirens of the police and rescue vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 15 we finally got a flight to San Diego. As we were
unpacking, we thought about the people we had met in Hoboken, the
lives lost in such a hideous way, and the families desperately
missing them. We didn't take a single picture or visit any of the
sights we had planned, but we were able to unpack and hug our family.</TE>

<TE>   Cruise Compassion</TE>
<TE>   My wife, Eileen, and I were on an Alaskan cruise aboard the Regal
Princess at the time of the attacks. Dinner on the last night is
supposed to be a joyous affair, but of course no one was in the mood
to celebrate.</TE>
<TE>   At the meal's conclusion, the dining room lights were dimmed, and
the wait staff brought out baked Alaska to a somber and reflective
crowd. The dessert was placed on each table, but before serving, the
maitre d' asked everyone to stand and sing the American national
anthem in honor of those who had perished in New York. Everyone
stood--American, British, Canadian, German, Japanese and about two
dozen other nationalities on board--and sang the words a cappella.</TE>
<TE>   The following morning as we departed the ship, we passed the
purser's station, where a 2-foot-high brandy snifter was being used
to collect donations for disaster relief. It was filled to the brim
with bills: a Canadian dollar, an American $100 bill, and seemingly
everything in between.</TE>

<TE>   Not Leaving Las Vegas</TE>
<TE>   When the first airliner crashed into the World Trade Center, I was
fast asleep under the stars in the Mojave Desert. I had gone for a
few days of quiet and solitude to a favorite spot north of Ludlow,
with plans to pack up Sept. 11 and drive to Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Before dawn I was awakened by the sound of two or three jet
fighters approaching from the southeast. Almost before I had time to
lift my head, they were screaming over my campsite. I didn't think
much of it.</TE>
<TE>   I drove to Las Vegas, never turning on the radio, and headed
directly for Binion's Horseshoe downtown. It was 9:30 or 10 a.m., and
nothing seemed amiss except for a small group gathered around a
cocktail bar, staring open-mouthed at the TV monitor. I stopped to
watch.</TE>
<TE>   I spent most of the next three days holed up in my room on the
22nd floor, transfixed by the coverage. Occasionally I ventured
downstairs. America may have ground to a halt that day, but Las Vegas
decidedly did not. The gambling continued apace. Only the casino
employees appeared to be watching the TV monitors. After about 18
hours, management shut off all the TVs on the casino floor.</TE>

<TE>   Hands and Hearts</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-four members of San Francisco Solano Catholic Parish in
Rancho Santa Margarita left LAX on a 17-day journey to Turkey and
Greece on the evening of Sept. 10. As we arrived at London Heathrow
the afternoon of Sept. 11, information was sketchy about an incident
in New York. What little we heard didn't seem to make sense.</TE>
<TE>   We boarded the flight to Istanbul, not truly aware of the horror
that had befallen our country until arriving late in Istanbul. Our
Turkish guide, a Muslim man named Orhan, had the unpleasant task of
giving us the news. Our mood turned to shock, and we realized that we
were thousands of miles from home and family during a time of
unthinkable pain.</TE>
<TE>   Oddly, our mood began to lighten because of the support of the
people we met in Turkey. They reached out to us in restaurants or
tourist sights. They would offer a hand. Some would give a flower.
Many just held their hands to their hearts with a gentle nod. Turkish
flags flew at half-staff. American flags would appear on our table at
restaurants. CNN was our main link to the events of 9/11, but the
support of the people we met was our lifeline.</TE>

<TE>   To celebrate our 60th wedding anniversary and my wife's 85th
birthday we sailed Aug. 25 on the Crystal Harmony from San Francisco,
sailed through the Panama Canal and were to disembark in New York
City on Sept. 18.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 5 we celebrated our wedding anniversary and, as a gift to
my wife, Maxine, I had the ship's concierge call and make a luncheon
date for two on the 102nd floor of the World Trade Center for Monday,
Sept., 17. I received written confirmation. I still have it.</TE>

<TE>   Places in the Heart</TE>
<TE>   We were with a tour group in Ireland. The day after the attacks,
we went to the U.S. Embassy in Dublin. Our hearts were full as we saw
people lined up for blocks to pay their respects and lay flowers,
which were 5 to 6 feet deep.</TE>
<TE>   Everywhere we went people expressed their sympathy to us. On Sept.
14 our group attended church in the town of Enniskerry. After the
service, people from this small church asked if any of us needed a
place to stay. They said we would be welcome in their homes.</TE>
<TE>   Ireland and its people left an indelible print on my heart.</TE>

<TE>   A Time to Mourn</TE>
<TE>   My husband and I were part of a group visiting Machu Picchu in
Peru.</TE>
<TE>   Early on the morning of Sept. 11, we left our hotel to experience
what we expected to be the highlight of the 10-day tour of Peru: a
visit to this ancient Incan city. Around noon, we took a lunch break
at a hotel near the entrance to Machu Picchu. As I walked into the
lobby, I saw a flurry of activity and heard the horrifying,
unbelievable news.</TE>
<TE>   The entire trip took on a surreal quality. On the one hand, we
were experiencing and even enjoying learning about a fascinating
people and culture. On the other, we felt strangely apart from the
collective grief that had seized our country.</TE>
<TE>   We arrived in Los Angeles early on the morning of Sept. 18. When
the plane touched the ground, the passengers cheered and applauded.
As we drove home from the airport, I saw, for the first time,
American flags on cars and in front of homes and businesses. My
grieving had begun.</TE>

<HD>Kittredge Takes the Middle Road to Nature in 'Homelands'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SOUTHWESTERN HOMELANDS, By William Kittredge, National Geographic
Directions, $20</LD>
<LD>   William Kittredge has always been more a Western Guy than a
Southwestern Guy. He has lived in Montana for about 30 years and
distilled several books from the experience, ruminating on ranchlands
and water and the complications that ensue when humankind and the
more natural world bump into each other.</LD>
<LD>   The first time I visited that state, about five years ago, I
picked up "Montana Spaces," an anthology edited and introduced by
Kittredge, and was so taken with his writing and the stories he
gathered from beneath the Big Sky that I was tempted to stay inside
my cabin and read this writer so wedded to his landscape.</LD>
<TE>   But it turns out that Kittredge and his wife, writer Annick Smith,
do get out of state occasionally, often to Arizona, New Mexico and
Utah.</TE>
<TE>   It further turns out that the National Geographic people were
eager to make him part of its recently launched Directions series,
which turns noted writers loose in significant landscapes. And so we
have "Southwestern Homelands," for which we should be grateful.</TE>
<TE>   It's not an ambitious book, measuring 176 pages and meandering
between travelogue and history. But Kittredge has put in his time on
the scene, talked to provocative thinkers such as Douglas Peacock and
Gary Paul Nabhan, done some reading and reflecting on the region's
original peoples, and achieved some just plain read-it-out-loud
lyrical writing:</TE>
<TE>   "Hummingbirds, I can't stop listing them, move me to my fanciest
fantasies," he writes. "The white-eared and the magnificent, so many
species in flowering havens all day long, so intricate in their
speedy doings, so elegant in their comings and goings, such quick
splendor."</TE>
<TE>   Another pleasure of this book is the author's resistance to
typecasting. Kittredge genuflects, inevitably, in the direction of
his old friend Edward Abbey, the civilization-damning author of
"Desert Solitaire" and "The Monkey Wrench Gang." But instead of
bragging about his own brave hikes and solitary moments, Kittredge
freely confesses to sleeping in comfortable beds, eating occasionally
in trendy Santa Fe restaurants and admiring Arizona's Biltmore Hotel.
The author travels the way many of us do. He even plays golf (and
yes, that sound you hear probably is Abbey blowing raspberries from 6
feet under).</TE>
<TE>   A few missed stitches in Kittredge's fabric: When his narrative
needs a nudge in a new direction, he relies on rhetorical questions
along the lines of "At what cost has social order been maintained by
Southwestern tribes?" and "What did I take from Gloria and Jim?" His
ambling from subject to subject seems without much scheme, a
puzzlement that would matter more in a longer book.</TE>
<TE>   Near this one's end, Kittredge comes around to prescribing
remedies for water shortages, grazing troubles and other crises of
the new West. But he neither hugs trees nor revs up his WaveRunner.
Instead he looks for a middle road of compromise--not surprising,
perhaps, for a man who has been both rancher and academic, who has
thought hard about Chaco Canyon and hit from the tee at the
Phoenician.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   IP HOTELS ITALY, By Herbert Ypma, Thames &amp; Hudson, $29.95</TE>
<TE>   Here's a book to give somebody considering an Italian honeymoon or
perhaps just an Italian theme in the guest room. About 40 hotels are
included, with settings from urban Rome to the green Dolomites, with
rates up to $800 or so, but including several south of $100 nightly.
(Prices are quoted in euros, but with the dollar and euro trading so
close to even, the translation is a no-brainer.)</TE>
<TE>   Don't expect itinerary suggestions or service info on transport or
dining. Ypma, the author and photographer, is devoted strictly to
showing us some striking spots, indoors and out, and using text to
drop in a big helping of background and ambience.</TE>
<TE>   This is the fifth in a series whose other volumes look at city
lodgings, escapist destinations, French hostelries and budget inns
worldwide. Clearly, it's all about image: The book contains 516
images (and colorful, evocative photos they are) in 256 pages.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   PETRA AND THE LOST KINGDOM OF THE NABATEANS, By Jane Taylor,
Harvard University Press, $39.95</TE>
<TE>   You've seen the heroically carved red-dirt canyon walls of Petra,
Jordan, perhaps on a Discovery Channel rundown of the world's most
amazing national parks, perhaps on a day trip from Jerusalem in less
incendiary times, perhaps in "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"
(which goes unmentioned in the index of this Ivy League coffee-table
book). The Treasury building (which historians now believe wasn't a
treasury) and Petra's other desert marvels date back perhaps 2,000
years.</TE>
<TE>   For anyone who wants to know more about Jordan's most admired
landmark--basically, a narrow canyon chiseled into a kind of Middle
Eastern Main Street, from its fancy facades to its recessed rooms--or
the people who created it, this book offers excellent photography.
The text is thorough--dense, in fact--with details of royal
successions and such. Photos and text are by the author.</TE>

<HD>Ensure That Your Dream Villa Isn't a Nightmare</HD>

<AU>ARTHUR FROMMER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dazzled by the life of a British couple in the south of France, more
than a million Americans bought Peter Mayle's book "A Year in
Provence," and thousands have since followed suit, spending at least
a summer month in a European home.</LD>
<LD>   My wife and I are among them. Some years ago, we rented a Tuscan
villa for a month. We wanted to taste life in a foreign country, grow
fluent in a different language, be greeted as regulars in the local
shops and feel the maturity of an ancient culture.</LD>
<LD>   Setting this in motion is harder than you might think.</LD>
<TE>   The problem: renting a home sight unseen. Unless you're willing to
make a trip to look over the available properties before you go, your
main option is to rely on a mail-order catalog of rental homes--and
hope for the best. At least a dozen international real estate brokers
publish such listings and will supply them to you free or for a
charge of $2 to $4 (refunded if you then rent through them). Among
such companies are Home Base Abroad, (781) 545-5112; Vacanze in
Italia, (800) 533-5405; Ville et Village, (510) 559-8080;
International Lodgings Corp., (800) SPAIN-44, (772-4644); and
Interhome, (800) 882-6864.</TE>
<TE>   But is that satisfactory? Can a catalog with one or two photos of
each home and a paragraph of description capture the qualities of
each dwelling? Though many people using international brokers seem
satisfied, other renters arrive at homes alongside a busy highway, at
homes reached by virtually inaccessible dirt roads or near industrial
villages, or at homes too close to other dwellings.</TE>
<TE>   There's a better, two-step approach, the one we recently tried.
Phone for the catalogs and scan the photographs. Make a tentative
choice of several in one compact region and ask the broker to
schedule visits to them. Then use an inexpensive, off-season,
one-week transatlantic air-and-hotel package (less than $1,000 per
person) to scout the tentative choices. Assign a single member of
your family to make that trip. The cost is a fraction of what you
will later pay for the one-month rental, and it's a prudent expense.
Would you rather risk an unhappy month in a home that's not to your
liking?</TE>
<TE>   Besides using the U.S.-based international brokers to make a list
of several potential properties, on arrival you can also ask the
local tourist bureau for introductions to local brokers.</TE>
<TE>   On our trip to Umbria and Tuscany, we visited several homes
selected from a catalog. All were exactly as pictured but not quite
what we had in mind.</TE>
<TE>   Then, using a local real estate broker recommended to us by the
Florence tourist office, we found ourselves one afternoon driving up
a small mountain road to view the broker's recommendation. And there
it was: three stories; 18th century; fig and olive trees; a reception
hall larger than most New York City apartments; a large and ancient
kitchen with an open hearth for roasting, say, a small ox; five
rooms, four bathrooms; $3,000 for the month of September. It was the
perfect vacation. We have been daydreaming about our magical Tuscan
holiday ever since.</TE>
<TE>   If you would prefer to go beyond Europe, choosing from villas
throughout the world (including the United States and the Caribbean),
you might consider Mike Thiel's Hideaways International, (800)
843-4433 or (603) 430-4433, www.hideaways.com. Instead of acting as a
broker, Thiel operates a referral service, representing rental villas
from Barbados to Cuernavaca, Mexico, and from the California coast to
Thailand and Australia. He issues a catalog twice a year containing
color photographs of hundreds of homes for rent. If you see something
interesting, you phone Hideaways to get the details. You then contact
the owner of the home or condo directly. Membership is $99 a year (if
you join online; otherwise it's $129) for two issues annually of the
148-page "Hideaways Guide." You save, according to Thiel, by renting
direct.</TE>

<LD>Matching a move by US Airways, American Airlines is requiring holders
of nonrefundable tickets to make itinerary changes before or on the
date of their flight. Such passengers will be charged $100 to fly
standby on an alternate flight on their scheduled day of departure;
after that day, the ticket will have no value. The change applies to
tickets bought Aug. 30 or later for travel Oct. 1 or later....
America West passengers must check bags at least 30 minutes before
departure except in Denver and Atlanta, where the cutoff is 45
minutes, under changes that took effect last week. They must also
check in for flights at least 15 minutes before departure.... The
number of visitors coming to Hawaii on cruise ships or for
inter-island cruises climbed 53% in the first half of this year from
the same period last year, state officials say. Nearly all were from
out of state, including 56% from the eastern U.S. and 31.3% from the
West, the Associated Press reported.</LD>

<LD>Recent rainfall may aid a fall foliage season in southern New England
threatened by drought. Meanwhile, rainfall has been close to normal
in parts of northern New England.</LD>
<LD>   "Without a substantial amount of rainfall, I think we're going to
have a muted [fall foliage] season," said Glenn Dryer, director of
the Connecticut College Arboretum in New London. "Some trees have
already begun to drop leaves, and that's early here." Before recent
rains, southern New England's rainfall this year was down about 12
inches, or about a third less than average, he said.</LD>
<LD>   In Vermont, rainfall has been average in the northeast and up to 1
1/2 inches below average in the southeast and west from January
through July, said state climatologist Lesley-Ann Dupigny-Giroux.
July and August were very dry, which has caused some maples to turn,
she added. New Hampshire recorded slightly above-average rain from
January through July.</LD>
<TE>   Experts say a moderate drought like the one in Vermont can enhance
red colors in leaves, but a severe drought may cause leaves to drop
prematurely. Exact predictions are impossible, they say.</TE>
<TE>   Last week the U.S. Forest Service was scheduled to open its Fall
Color Hotline, (800) 354-4595, which reports on conditions
nationwide; similar information is on the Internet site
www.fs.fed.us/news/fallcolors.</TE>

<HD>13,000 to Reenact Battle of Antietam in Maryland</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Compiled by Jane Engle</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The 140th anniversary of the bloody Civil War Battle of Antietam will
be commemorated this week with a reenactment expected to draw more
than 13,000 participants to a Hagerstown, Md., field nine miles north
of the original battle site. More than 4,800 died in 1862 when Union
forces beat back an attempted Confederate invasion of the North led
by Gen. Robert E. Lee.</LD>
<LD>   It will be the largest Civil War reenactment since one in
Gettysburg, Pa., in 1998 drew more than 20,000 reenactors, said
Dennis Frye, co-chairman of the private, nonprofit Antietam
Commemoration Committee Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Spectator tickets for the event, Sept. 13 to 15, are $17 per day
in advance and $20 at the gate for adults; children 6 to 12 pay $10
per day. Hagerstown-area lodgings were full as of last week,
organizers said. But the town is about 65 miles from Baltimore and
Washington, D.C., so it is possible to drive in for the day. (888)

<HD>At Viceroy in Santa Monica, Design Rules</HD>
<DH>New hotel and restaurant are packed with style--for those
willing to pay the price</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HEATHER JOHN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SANTA MONICA</DL>
<LD>I was feeling pretty decadent as I pulled up to the valet at Viceroy,
the new luxury hotel in the former Pacific Shore building on Ocean
Avenue. After all, published rates start at $255 for a standard room.
Parking is $22 per night. At these prices, travelers may want to head
straight from reception to the bar--and that will cost you too.</LD>
<LD>   But I'm a sucker for things related to design. And its proximity
to the beach aside, the hotel's biggest selling point is ambience, of
which it has plenty.</LD>
<LD>   Renovated under the direction of interior designer Kelly Wearstler
and reopened in July by the Kor Hotel Group, owners of the Avalon and
Maison 140 hotels in Beverly Hills and the Estrella in Palm Springs,
Viceroy is the company's latest offering in chic boutique.</LD>
<TE>   The overall effect of the lobby works in an L.A. context--a sort
of breezy, tropical, Colonial-meets-midcentury-modern design in warm
charcoal, white and apple green. (Never mind the 4 1/2-foot- tall
plaster cameo perched behind the front desk.) The open lobby doubles
as a bar and feels even larger with the help of a mirrored ceiling.
Traditional furniture is tricked out with contemporary upholstery,
such as the playful chaise longues covered in white faux patent
leather. A cane motif is repeated in the hall carpet and guest-room
wallpaper. Chandeliers abound. It's all very "Godfather II"--with
deal makers by the water--but with a hipster edge.</TE>
<TE>   It was Friday, and though still daylight, the lobby was filling
with the cocktail crowd perched on vinyl bar stools, curled up in
club chairs and spilling out onto the patio. Before joining them, I
collected my room key from a friendly clerk wearing a smart black
suit with a lovely lime-green tie. A lot of your opinion of this
hotel will depend on your relationship with the color green, the
predominant accent on everything from staff uniforms to chairs to
pillows to sheets.</TE>
<TE>   Let's talk about those sheets. Behind the Georgian-green door to
my room lay an airy, mostly white room, its king-size bed fitted in
300-thread-count white Frette sheets with apple-green trim. The room
also was furnished with a chartreuse patent leather ottoman, a
reproduction vintage chair in green upholstery, a desk with a funny
little lamp with a spaniel-shaped base, an armoire housing an
entertainment center (including a surround-sound CD-DVD player) and
what the Web site touts as an "exceptionally stocked minibar" (with
top-shelf spirits and prices to match). But it was the sheets that
had my immediate attention. A similar set at the Frette boutique in
Beverly Hills runs about $800.</TE>
<TE>   I had about 30 minutes before I was to meet a friend in the lobby,
just enough time for a nap. "If I don't leave this bed for the rest
of the weekend, I'll be content," I thought. But then a maid barged
into my room without warning. I explained that I was napping. She
nodded, grabbed an ironing board standing near the closet and took it
into the bathroom to fold it. Only a month had passed since the
hotel's opening, so I chalked up the incident to a new staff and
decided it was time to hit the bar.</TE>
<TE>   My friend Suzanne and I walked out to the patio, where six roomy
cabanas surround two tiny pools. About 200 porcelain dishes--some
plain, some patterned--adorn the exterior walls. We settled into
white vinyl wing chairs in a corner under a large palm and ordered
drinks (mine about $13 with tip).</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't long before we realized we weren't alone. A third party,
an inquisitive little brown mouse, had joined us. Suzanne is a little
squeamish about rodents, so we asked our server if there was another
table. There wasn't. Besides, she added, "He's really friendly, and
he stays in this corner."</TE>
<TE>   By 10 p.m. the bar was packed inside and out, awash in a sea of
low-rise jeans and midriff-baring peasant shirts, all backlighted in
neon green. Suzanne and I chose to go more low-key and drove over to
Father's Office on Montana Avenue for a burger and a beer.</TE>
<TE>   This place was a madhouse too, and we had to stalk a table for 15
minutes. After a basket of sweet potato home fries, a creamy pint of
Tetley's and a sublime burger, Suzanne dropped me back off at the
hotel, where the scene at 12:30 a.m. was even wilder than before. Two
doormen guarded the elevators and asked to see a room key before
letting me head up--a security measure I appreciated. Back upstairs,
I opened the sliding doors so I could hear the ocean and drifted to
sleep on spectacularly expensive sheets.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday morning I wandered over to the Santa Monica Farmers'
Market at the Third Street Promenade and indulged in one of my guilty
pleasures, the Bravo Cucina cart's breakfast burrito: scrambled eggs,
mozzarella, pico de gallo and guacamole rolled in a flour tortilla.</TE>
<TE>   The market was lively with locals and tourists poring over samples
of heirloom tomatoes and sweet figs. I finished grazing and popped
into Hennessey &amp; Ingalls, an art and design bookstore where you can
lose hours browsing.</TE>
<TE>   Afternoon rolled around, and the fog had not lifted. Any hopes of
kicking it poolside were dashed. So I hopped in the car to see what
was afoot at Bergamot Station, the art gallery complex on Michigan
Avenue in Santa Monica (www.bergamotstation.com).</TE>
<TE>   Jewelry designer Suzanne Felsen had recently returned from
Guadalajara with unusual orange fire opals, which she mixed with
semiprecious carved green peridot from India. If you ask, she will
let you try on her architectural, minimalist designs, which range
from $175 for an opal-and-topaz necklace to $15,000 for a platinum
brilliant-cut diamond ring.</TE>
<TE>   Down the hall in the G Building is Hiromi Paper International, a
favorite with artists. Exquisite handcrafted papers from Japan,
Brazil, Nepal, Thailand and Europe hang from wooden racks. Over in
the B Building, a Yoko Ono exhibit was running at the Shoshana Wayne
Gallery and beautiful terra-cotta sculptures by the late Georges
Jeanclos were at the Frank Lloyd Gallery. I grabbed a midafternoon
latte and snack at the Bergamot Cafe, where you can buy an oil
painting of a panino for $600 or the edible version for $6.50.</TE>
<TE>   Later that evening, my friend Vincent joined me for dinner at
Viceroy's restaurant, Whist, the latest from Orange County
restaurateurs Tim and Liza Goodell of Aubergine, Troquet and Red
Pearl Kitchen fame.</TE>
<TE>   A quick aside: While booking my room the previous week, I had
asked the clerk to make dinner reservations at Whist. After arriving
at the hotel on Friday, I happened to check my home voicemail. The
Whist maitre d' had left a message asking me to confirm my table.
Can't the hotel and restaurant note when a diner is a hotel guest?</TE>
<TE>   The maitre d' showed Vincent and me to a table against a wall with
the bar on the other side. Cutouts in the wall, which reveal glass
shelves of liquor, not only added to the din but posed the
possibility of a bottle landing on our heads. Each time the bartender
replaced a bottle, I wanted to duck for cover. (Management has since
decided to cover these cutouts.)</TE>
<TE>   The food more than made up for the distraction. I started with a
lightly dressed hearts of palm salad, while Vincent tucked into an
heirloom tomato salad with watercress and Maytag blue cheese. For a
main course he had the lamb osso buco, which fell off the bone. I was
in love with the honey coriander duck breast, served with caramelized
turnips and sauteed foie gras. Partly because it was chilly and
mostly because we just couldn't resist, we ordered a side pan of
potatoes au gratin for two. We finished with a delicious Valrhona
chocolate souffle cake with a scoop of prune-Armagnac ice cream. (My
half of the bill was almost $90.)</TE>
<TE>   I walked Vincent out to the valet and overheard a middle-aged
woman in a blazer, Spandex leggings and mules complaining, "They're
trying to turn this place into the Skybar," a reference to the
Mondrian hotel nightspot on the Sunset Strip. Her outfit might have
been off the mark, but her assessment wasn't. Since my visit I've
heard several similar comparisons, and though Viceroy's Kelly
Wearstler and Mondrian designer Philippe Starck might not welcome the
comparison, their aesthetics seem to have drawn the same
flavor-of-the-moment crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday morning I checked out and waved goodbye to dual pools
nobody was using. Two gracious, lime-tied valets jumped to open the
doors after a smiling clerk handed me the bill, which certainly
wasn't cheap. (The hotel opened with introductory nightly rates
starting at $189 plus tax, then transitioned to the standard rates of
$255-and-up last month. But as of the Travel section's deadline
Tuesday, prices for this month had changed again, dropping to $205.)</TE>
<TE>   I won't be making a habit of staying here. But once in a while, we
all need to escape. And once Viceroy finds its rhythm, it just might
be the place to do it.</TE>

<LD>The 126-page "Best of British Excellence," issued by the British
Tourist Authority, describes dozens of retail outlets and products
and includes a card good for behind-the-scenes tours of factories,
stores and museums. Although it emphasizes shopping, it has
information on other attractions in England, Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland. Many listings offer an Internet address but no
phone or street address, so you will need a computer to make full use
of it. (877) 899-8391.</LD>

<HD>Landing in the Middle Ages</HD>
<DH>Meandering its mysterious alleyways, climbing its towering
ramparts, exploring its ancient Jewish quarter, one wonders why so
few Americans have discovered Girona, Spain, on the Costa Brava</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARRY ZWICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GIRONA, Spain</DL>
<LD>You would have thought we had just climbed Mt. Everest. There we
were, toasting in triumph, sitting amid Scandinavians in hiking
shorts, Swiss with stout walking sticks and sturdy British women
wearing sensible shoes. My wife, Bobbie, and I and dozens of others
had reached the top of the ramparts and circled the city, and we were
celebrating. We were, after all, 500 feet above sea level.</LD>
<LD>   Now, with our climb and the midday sun behind us, we were lunching
at Cafe le Bistrot, halfway up a steep stone stairway inside the
wall, with dozens of superathletes like ourselves, bonding under
belle epoque opera posters and Impressionist watercolors of
ballerinas as ceiling fans twirled. We had endured 25 minutes and
nearly a mile of climbing stairways and watchtowers, and we were
buzzing and jumping with adrenaline in this crossroads, soothed
though we all were by its greenery, blue flowers, and cocoa and peach
walls.</LD>
<TE>   Most of our fellow climbers were in their 20s and 30s, and six or
seven languages were spoken. During our three-day stay here in July,
we did not cross paths with a single American. Of the 109,000
tourists who visited the city last year, I found out later from
Girona's tourist office, most are from elsewhere in Spain. In second
place were the British, with 15,000, and in third place, the French,
with 14,000. American visitors were so few, with totals below 1,000,
that they didn't even make the list.</TE>
<TE>   Americans don't know what they're missing, because there is much
to do in this historic city on Spain's Costa Brava. You must snack on
tapas, drink Penedes and climb the 90-step Baroque apron to the
900-year-old Gothic cathedral. You must wind through the narrow,
twisting cobblestone lanes where one of Spain's most influential
Jewish communities lived six centuries ago. You must sample free
wine, cheese, candy and salsa at the outdoor market.</TE>
<TE>   Above all, you must climb to the top of the wall that almost
encircles the Barri Vell ("old district"), Girona's medieval quarter.
Here, nearly 70 feet above the old stone streets, you look down at
lemon and olive trees, up at pines and an occasional spruce on the
slopes of Montjuic rising before you, and out toward the stunning
Cathedral of Santa Maria and the blue ridges of the Pyrenees
mountains beyond.</TE>
<TE>   Bobbie and I had come to Girona for the same reason as the
builders of the walls--the Romans, Visigoths, Moors and Aragonese:
The city is on the main road from Barcelona to southern France, and
we were headed to Arles, France, then to the Riviera on a two-week
vacation in July. But we found so much to amuse ourselves
here--snaking alleys with surprises at every bend, good food and
drink at low prices--that we were in no hurry to move on.</TE>
<TE>   Our 62-mile drive from Barcelona to Girona took an hour, not
counting the extra hour at each end during which we were thoroughly
lost. The train, which takes a little more than an hour and deposits
you within four blocks of the Barri Vell, would seem a better bet
than driving.</TE>
<TE>   But once we arrived here, we found a different world from the one
we had left in Barcelona. The brisk efficiency and the cool
stylishness of Barcelona were nowhere in sight. Although our hotel,
the Melia Girona in the New City, is the best of the seven
hotels--there are a dozen hostels and pensions as well--in this city
of 72,000, the laid-back desk staff tended to disappear for long
periods. No one stood outside to hustle us into restaurants. We could
wear whatever we wanted. We discovered a warmth and friendliness that
we thought had long since departed from urban Europe. By our second
day, locals were saying "hola" to us in the streets. Whenever we
whipped out a map, someone came by to help us.</TE>
<TE>   Though we stayed in the prosperous New City--parts of which are
200 years old--we spent nearly all our time in the Barri Vell.
Consisting mostly of pedestrian lanes, it was compact and a joy to
walk. Parking, though, was unthinkable.</TE>
<TE>   To get to our first meal in Girona, we parked in the New City and
crossed a bridge to the east side of the mirror-like Onyar River and
the Barri Vell. We had landed in the Middle Ages. We found a village
of hand-hewn stone, graceful arches and, off in the distance, the
soaring cathedral.</TE>
<TE>   And, of course, the wall. Its foundations date to the 4th century,
when the Romans enclosed a village they named Gerunda in honor of
Geryon, a three-headed monster in Greek mythology who was killed by
Hercules. The wall looks much as it did in the 14th century, when the
Aragonese put on the finishing touches.</TE>
<TE>   "Are we dressed properly?" Bobbie asked as we entered the
wood-paneled vestibule at Albereda, the most expensive restaurant in
the Barri Vell, around lunchtime. As black-suited waiters came into
view carrying silver-domed serving dishes, I began to wonder the same
thing. Then we saw the other diners, who, like us, were wearing
sandals and shorts.</TE>
<TE>   Before we ordered, our waiter brought us flutes of cava, the local
answer to champagne, and a plate of three appetizers. They were
tasty, but we had no idea what they were.</TE>
<TE>   When I asked the waiter, I received an answer in Catalan,
incomprehensible to me even though I speak sophomore-level Spanish.
Because Girona is in the Catalonia region, Catalan is everyone's
first language. With fewer vowels and more sibilants than Spanish, it
sounds like mist falling on pebbles. Even the name of the city is
pronounced differently in Catalan, its first letter sounding like
"zh" rather than the Spanish "h."</TE>
<TE>   After a stunning lunch of shrimp-and-crab-filled crepes au gratin
for Bobbie and filet of sole with cumin and couscous for me, and a
bottle of a hearty red Ribera del Duero, I was afraid to ask for the
bill. At $47, it was much more than we would ever pay again for a
meal in affordable Girona.</TE>
<TE>   After lunch we headed to the Call, the ancient Jewish ghetto where
Girona's small but culturally significant Jewish community was forced
to live from 889 until Spain expelled Jews in 1492. Here the study of
cabala, the books and traditions of Jewish mysticism, thrived during
the 12th and 13th centuries. The scholar and teacher Nahmanides,
Rabbi Moses ben Nahman, who lived from 1194 to 1270, took cabala from
the shady corners of Provence, where it was being studied quietly,
into mainstream Jewish thought. Over the centuries, thanks to
Nahmanides' eloquence and charisma, the influence of cabala has
spread. Even Madonna and Roseanne have taken it up. The concept, not
quite the way Nahmanides saw it, that the individual can connect
personally to God appeals to people who are turned off by
institutional religion.</TE>
<TE>   Nahmanides was expelled from Girona for besting a Christian
convert in a forced theological discourse, but ironically he is now
the town's favorite son. One of Girona's main streets, Bonastruc ca
Porta, bears his name in Catalan, and the city runs a museum on the
site of its last synagogue--previously Nahmanides' home--in his
honor.</TE>
<TE>   Bobbie had wanted to visit the museum, the Centre Bonastruc ca
Porta, since 1992, when it was dedicated in commemoration of the
500th anniversary of the expulsion of the Jews. Her ancestors settled
in the Call in 1086 and lived there for at least 100 years. Did they
once lie beneath the ancient, weathered tombstones enshrined on the
second floor? I left her alone with her thoughts as she stood there,
overlooking a central courtyard filled with citrus trees and
bougainvillea surrounding a granite mosaic Star of David.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to the efforts of Girona's former mayor, a history
professor named Joaquim Nadal, the Call is the most fully restored
Jewish quarter in Spain. The city sponsors concerts of medieval
Jewish music there at noon and in the evening, and occasional
storytelling hours as well. The city's high-minded attitude toward
restoration is evident not just in the Call but in every corner of
the Barri Vell.</TE>
<TE>   Later that day we visited the imposing Cathedral of Santa Maria,
which is also being restored. It has one of the widest naves, at 75.4
feet, of any Gothic church in the world. We also stopped at the Banys
Arabs, 12th century baths constructed in the style of the Moors, who
ruled the city from 795 to 1015.</TE>
<TE>   Before leaving the Barri Vell, we passed through the Placa de
l'Oli, birthplace of Girona's other noteworthy son, bandleader Xavier
Cugat, who died in 1990. Cugat had no small impact on the world. He
cut at least 30 record albums, propelled all four of his beautiful
wives onto the world stage (wife No. 4, Charo, still performs in Las
Vegas), appeared regularly on TV and radio and played himself in more
than a dozen movies. He was one of the first musicians, long before
Perez "Prez" Prado and Desi Arnaz, to popularize Latin music to
mainstream America. He was a cartoonist for The Times in 1924 and
'25, and King Features syndicated his caricatures worldwide. In the
1980s he owned a Mexican restaurant named Casa Cugat on La Cienega
Boulevard, where he greeted many of his guests.</TE>
<TE>   After a siesta, we drove back toward the Barri Vell in the evening
and searched for a space in the free parking lot across the Onyar in
the New City. Crowds were pouring out of small cars, and there was no
room for ours. We parked about six blocks away from the riverbank,
walked through colonnaded Placa Independencia with its strolling
accordionists, and to the Pont de les Peixateries Velles, the
iron-filigree pedestrian bridge designed by Gustave Eiffel, leading
from the New City to the old river houses painted in pastels of
peach, rose and lime, looking like sherbet.</TE>
<TE>   Crowds streamed across the bridge to the Barri Vell's many
attractions: 27 restaurants, 15 clothing stores, seven nightclubs,
five museums, three bookstores and 19 specialty shops. There were
classical concerts every night behind the cathedral, and more than 40
blocks of ancient streets, brightly illuminated at night.</TE>
<TE>   It was 8 p.m., at least two hours too early for dinner in Spain,
but the air was filled with fragrances wafting out of kitchens
preparing local specialties--hot chocolate cake with ginger, spicy
French fries and escalivada, an irresistible dish of roasted
eggplants, red peppers, tomatoes and onions.</TE>
<TE>   We were hungry, and we followed a British couple's advice on a
tapas bar.</TE>
<TE>   A waiter at Tapa't invited us to take an outdoor table in an alley
beside stone 13th century houses sporting second-story planter boxes
with vines and blossoms tumbling down. An accordion player serenaded
us as we examined the snack menu. We decided to share mushrooms in a
sour cream and onion sauce, chicken with bechamel sauce in puff
pastry, wedges of Manchego cheese and a plate of pa amb tomaquet, the
ubiquitous Catalan specialty of bread coated with olive oil and
garlic and dipped in tomato sauce.</TE>
<TE>   We had ordered way too much food, but it was so good that we ate
it all. With a delightful house white wine and a bottle of water, our
bill came to $16.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone at Tapa't seemed to know everyone else, and many were
from places like Sheffield and Leeds, England. Some approached us,
mostly to take their photos, and then passed on travel tips--the
location of an Internet bar, a good chocolateria, a cool stone
convent where we could find relief from the heat.</TE>
<TE>   The next day we decided to be thoroughly touristy and take a ride
on the bright green mini-train parked on the Pont de Pedra, in front
of the helpful tourist office. We thought the train ride would be a
tame experience after our hike up the ramparts. Fifteen minutes
before departure time, all but two of the train's 60 seats were
filled, and we grabbed them, although they were not next to each
other.</TE>
<TE>   Tame it was not. After a calm ride at ground level, the train
headed uphill and began to wind around steep ramps at high speeds,
with stone walls just millimeters from our elbows. A woman next to me
covered her eyes.</TE>
<TE>   In beautiful Girona, this was clearly a mistake.</TE>

<HD>Going Where Mosquitoes Are? Get the Buzz on West Nile Virus</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHLEEN DOHENY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When guests check in at any of the 18 Disney-owned hotels at Walt
Disney World in Orlando, Fla., they get a newsletter telling them
about park operating hours, special attractions and fireworks times.
But these days, the welcome packet also includes a letter about the
dangers of West Nile virus, a mosquito-borne virus that can cause
flu-like symptoms, brain inflammation and, in some cases, death.</LD>
<LD>   As of the Travel section's press time Tuesday, 50 people in the
United States have died of West Nile virus since records started
being kept in 1999, according to Bernadette Burden, a spokeswoman for
the Centers for Disease Control. From 1999 through Sept. 3, 2002,
there have been 822 laboratory-confirmed human cases in the U.S., she
adds. (Only laboratory-confirmed cases are included in the CDC toll.)
The states with the largest numbers of human cases are Louisiana,
205; Illinois, 122; Mississippi, 104; Texas, 43; and Ohio, 40.</LD>
<LD>   Florida is not in the top five, but this is mosquito country.
(There is no evidence that people can transmit the disease to
others.) Disney resort operators are providing guests information on
how to protect themselves, as are the operators of many other tourist
facilities.</LD>
<TE>   About 20% of infected persons will develop what is called West
Nile fever, with headache, fever and skin rashes. About one in 150
will develop brain or spinal cord inflammation--encephalitis or
meningitis.</TE>
<TE>   When the disease is mild, symptoms last only a few days. In more
severe cases, the symptoms can last for several weeks. The median age
for the disease, now 51, has dropped by nearly 10 years, according to
the CDC's Burden.</TE>
<TE>   The virus is commonly found in Africa, West Asia, the Middle East
and Eastern Europe, but it surfaced in the United States in 1999 with
an outbreak in New York City.</TE>
<TE>   The increasing number of cases has sparked concern among travelers
destined for the affected states. For an update on the number of
cases state by state, see
www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/city_states.htm.</TE>
<TE>   "We've gotten a lot of calls from travelers asking 'Is it safe?' "
says Trudy Horton, a spokesperson for the Louisiana Department of
Health and Hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the spread of the virus, the CDC says travelers need not
change their plans, within the U.S. or elsewhere, if they take
precautions. "Use insect repellent containing DEET
[N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide], optimally 35% or higher," Burden says.</TE>
<TE>   "When possible, wear long-sleeved clothing and long pants, treated
with DEET if clothes are very thin. We also encourage people to stay
indoors at dawn, dusk and early evening," when mosquitoes are most
active, she says.</TE>
<TE>   For children, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends
repellents with a DEET concentration of 10% or less. Its Web page,
www.aap.org/family/wnv-excerpt.htm, has additional information.</TE>
<TE>   Burden encourages travelers to keep their distance from stagnant
water at zoos and other attractions or to ask the facility's
operators whether the water is changed frequently to minimize
mosquito breeding.</TE>
<TE>   Operators of tourist attractions say they are doing more than just
reminding guests of the dangers. "We have always had an aggressive
mosquito spraying program," says Rena Callahan, a spokeswoman for
Walt Disney World. "Now it is even more intense."</TE>
<TE>   In Louisiana, travelers to state parks and historic sites are
provided with insect repellent free of charge as long as the 540
cases donated by Cutter, a manufacturer of repellents, hold out,
Horton says.</TE>
<TE>   Current information on West Nile virus, besides the state-by-state
toll, is available on the CDC Web site's West Nile page,
www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/index.htm.</TE>
<TE>   Some states have special pages of West Nile information.
Louisiana's, for instance, is at www.FightTheBiteLouisiana.com.</TE>
<TE>   Travelers who are bitten should seek medical help if they have
symptoms of West Nile. There is no specific treatment or vaccine, but
patients receive supportive treatment such as intravenous fluids.</TE>
<TE>   The CDC's Burden says experts believe that cases of the virus will
soon peak and then drop in numbers, though no one can say for sure.
"We've got a lot to learn about West Nile virus," she says.</TE>

<HD>Surprise Swimming Holes in Ojai's Murrieta Canyon</HD>

<AU>JOHN McKINNEY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shallow swimming holes and woodsy Murrieta Canyon are the attractions
of this short jaunt on the outskirts of Ojai.</LD>
<LD>   Murrieta Trail meanders along a creek to oak-shaded Murrieta Camp.
(The camp, creek, canyon and trail take their name--albeit a
different spelling--from 19th century outlaw Joaquin Murieta.) Given
the drought and Ojai's reputation for scorching summer days, my
family was more than a little surprised to find pools of water on a
recent hike to the creek.</LD>
<LD>   Directions to the trail head: From U.S. 101 in Ventura, take
Highway 33 north about 12 miles to Ojai. Highway 155 veers farther
into Ojai, but stay on 33 and drive five miles north to North
Matilija Road. Turn left and go five more miles to a parking area
just short of a gated fire road and the signed trail head.</LD>
<TE>   The hike: Follow the dirt fire road through a private parcel known
as the Matilija Canyon Ranch and Wildlife Refuge. (The property owner
allows access through the ranch to the surrounding Los Padres
National Forest.)</TE>
<TE>   After the second creek crossing, look for signed Murrieta Trail on
the left. Head south on the path, which leads to the mouth of
Murrieta Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   The trail crosses the creek, climbs a low hill, then follows the
creek bed upstream to Murrieta Camp, perched on a flat. Walk up-creek
and you might discover swimming holes. Note, however, that the trail
beyond the camp isn't maintained; it's overgrown with brush and
difficult to follow.</TE>

<DH>Crime, bad weather or disease can spoil any trip, but
consumers do have information resources to avoid bumps in the road.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE ENGLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With all the attention focused on the first anniversary of the Sept.
11 attacks, it's easy to forget that travelers rarely encounter
terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   "It is more likely you're going to drop your wallet or get the flu
than encounter a terrorist situation," says Andrea Bestrul,
spokeswoman for International SOS Assistance Inc., which has offices
around the world that provide emergency medical assistance and safety
information to more than 6,200 member companies.</LD>
<LD>   "In reality, your biggest fear is crime," including credit card
fraud and rental car theft, says Ed Lee, managing director of the Lee
Group in Nokesville, Va., an international security consulting firm.
"You're much more likely to encounter these [problems] than run into
Osama bin Laden in the washroom."</LD>
<TE>   Bad weather, labor strikes and scams that target tourists are
other common problems that can disrupt or ruin trips.</TE>
<TE>   Realizing these risks, international corporations and agencies
like the World Bank pay thousands of dollars to services such as
Bestrul's and Lee's to keep abreast of changes.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, it was difficult for vacationers of modest means
to gather this intelligence. But spurred partly by the post-Sept. 11
demands of newly security-conscious travelers, companies have begun
selling affordable updates to vacationers.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most sophisticated services is Worldcue Traveler, sold
by iJet Travel Intelligence, (410) 573-3860, www.ijet.com, of
Annapolis, Md., founded three years ago by former employees and
contractors of U.S. government intelligence services.</TE>
<TE>   For $25 per trip up to a month long, you get reports on your
destinations, plus around-the-clock e-mail alerts on travel
conditions. The service also offers advice on where to find emergency
medical assistance and other aid but does not cover the cost of care,
says Ken Lesniak, iJet's vice president of partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   The country reports, up to 100 pages, are nearly encyclopedic,
with sections on entry-exit rules; security issues, such as civil
unrest, carjackings and tourist scams; health risks; and local
customs.</TE>
<TE>   You can download an individual country report for $8 from iJet's
Web site or from www.amazon.com. (Search for "iJet.")</TE>
<TE>   The travel alerts include State Department warnings, transit
strikes, airline policy changes and weather updates. Lesniak boasts
that iJet, which employs scores of analysts and translators who scan
international media and other sources, can beat regular news outlets.</TE>
<TE>   I recently noticed that it carried up-to-the-minute information on
floods in France and Belgium; CNN's Web site reported only on the
French floods.</TE>
<TE>   The company has another service, called WorldLink, that combines
the Worldcue service with rental of a cell phone (good in 130
countries but not in Latin America or parts of Asia) for $7.95 per
day, or $13.95 per day for a satellite phone, plus the cost of air
time.</TE>
<TE>   SOS Assistance Inc. recently began selling alerts, which it calls
"traveler safety assistance," as an option with its medical service.
The safety program sends automatic alerts by e-mail; they also can be
faxed, spokeswoman Bestrul says. The alerts focus on health, safety
and crime issues.</TE>
<TE>   The medical-and-alerts package starts at $70 for trips up to 10
days. (800) 523-8662, www.internationalsos.com.</TE>
<TE>   If you don't want to pay for an intelligence service, you can
collect much of the same information for free on the Internet, but
this can be time-consuming because it's scattered. A good travel
agent can be a one-stop source; many subscribe to iJet or other
services and also get reports from travel suppliers.</TE>
<TE>   Here are some free sources:</TE>
<TE>   * U.S. State Department: Its country reports and travel warnings
are not updated frequently enough to satisfy some travelers, and it
tends to focus on political violence at the expense of other dangers.
But for the average U.S. tourist, the State Department remains the
best all-around source on risks abroad, security experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Its Consular Information Sheets are concise and well organized,
its travel warnings are valuable (if sometimes tinged with diplomatic
bias, critics say) and its 13-page publication "A Safe Trip Abroad,"
which you can read on its Web site (under "Travel Publications"), is
a cornucopia of sensible advice. (888) 407-4747 (live operators 5
a.m. to 5 p.m. Pacific time, weekdays), www.travel.state.gov.</TE>
<TE>   * British Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Canadian Department
of Foreign Affairs: Like the U.S. State Department, these offices
issue country reports for their citizens but with some differences.
They appear to contain more weather updates, for instance. For
Britain, visit www.fco.gov.uk. (Click on "Travel" under "Services.")
For Canada, it's www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca. (Click on "Travel
Assistance.")</TE>
<TE>   * Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: This U.S. agency
offers updates on disease outbreaks, health risks in various world
regions, sanitation ratings for cruise ships and more. (877) 394-8747
(recorded menu), www.cdc.gov/travel.</TE>
<TE>   * CNN: A quick way to catch up with critical news at your
destination is to enter its name and search on CNN's Web site,
www.cnn.com.</TE>
<TE>   * Internet bulletin boards: Many travel Web sites have sections
where travelers can share destination information.</TE>
<TE>   Run by publishers of the Lonely Planet guides, the Thorn Tree, at
www.lonelyplanet.com, reported more than 100,000 registered users
last month. It arranges comments by destination, but finding
specifics on risks can be tedious.</TE>
<TE>   For Europe, I like the "Tourist Scam Alert" on the "Graffiti Wall"
at www.ricksteves.com, run by Rick Steves' Europe Through the Back
Door tour company. It's full of firsthand accounts of getting
shortchanged at a cash register in Italy, deceived by a "defective"
ATM in France, robbed by a pickpocket in Barcelona and more.</TE>
<TE>   "After reading several months of these postings, I don't think I
would ever want to leave home," Frank P. commented in one e-mail.</TE>
<TE>   But having made many crime-and crisis-free trips to Europe, he has
concluded, "Apply a little care and caution, and you should be fine."</TE>
<TE>   And in most cases, security experts say, you will be.</TE>

<LD>I've been on seven cruises, but no more for me.</LD>
<LD>   On a cruise through the Panama Canal, the staff advised us that we
owed $300 for tips. And the line sold us $200 in shore tours that a
$30 cab ride could have duplicated.</LD>
<LD>   On a ship along the east coast of South America in January, the
staff told us to dress for hot weather. But our flight was routed
through New York, where we had to carry our luggage through the snow
to a different terminal. When we arrived to board the ship in Rio,
our luggage was brought to our cabin at 3 a.m. by toughs who demanded
a bigger tip. The purser said they were independent operators.</LD>
<TE>   In Puerto Rico, another cruise line sold us a cab ride to the
airport for $12, but when we got there the driver demanded $25 more.</TE>
<TE>   We were sold a tour by bus along with a train trip in Alaska, but
when the train ride was over there was no bus back to the ship, so we
walked a mile in the pouring rain without an umbrella or raincoat.</TE>

<LD>I just returned from three days in Astoria, Ore., and the surrounding
area, so I was pleased to read Jerry Haines' article "At Play on
Oregon's Coast: Pioneer heritage, ocean and river vistas, seafood by
the boatload--and rain" (Aug. 11). We spent an afternoon in Cannon
Beach, a small town delightful for walking, shopping and just looking
around. Another must is Baked Alaska, a restaurant on the water in
Astoria. The food was excellent, the service was great and it was not
expensive.</LD>
<LD>   Our only disappointment was the Grandview B&amp;B. The breakfast was
minimal. Some of the staff were very strict and unfriendly. We felt
like intruders.</LD>

<LD>My late husband and I stayed at the Relais Bosquet during our only
trip to Paris, in 1995. I was happy to find it in Toni Stroud's
excellent article, "Paris' Best Under $150" (Sept. 1), and was
further delighted that it has not changed. Two wonderful pluses: a
boulangerie two minutes away on the corner of Rue Cler and a lovely
wine shop diagonally across the intersection from the bakery. Each
evening as we returned to the hotel we made stops at both shops. I
recommend the hotel wholeheartedly.</LD>

<LD>I hope readers will ignore Karin Esterhammer's negative review of the
food on the Isle of Man ("An Emerald Jewel in the British Crown,"
Aug. 25). I don't know whether her dining choices were influenced by
finances, lack of knowledge of where to eat or having a 2-year-old in
tow, but she missed many fine restaurants.</LD>
<LD>   All the major hotels along the two-mile promenade have
restaurants, which range from good to excellent.</LD>
<LD>   In our 14 years of visiting the Isle of Man, on three occasions we
stayed at the Mount Murray Hotel and Country Club, just south of
Douglas on the road from the airport. It has several good
restaurants. We also have been guests at three smaller restaurants on
the island that would fall in the excellent category.</LD>

<HD>In Montreal, Dining on Char and Caribou</HD>
<DH>The city's restaurants are developing a taste for
distinctive regional dishes</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGO PFEIFF</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>MONTREAL</DL>
<LD>Romantic, flirtatious and decadent, this is a city of the heart and
the stomach. Its French heritage stokes a joie de vivre that is
Montreal's trademark. Having fun is a top priority here, especially
during the brief summers and early fall, when the entire city
parties. Hot jazz and African rhythms spill onto sweltering
pavements. In July, one of the world's biggest comedy festivals
allows us to yuk it up in French and English. (Next year's is July 10
to 20.)</LD>
<LD>   Complementing a love of good living is an obsession with good
eating. Located in Quebec, a province that is home to Canada's oldest
and most passionate food culture, Montreal has long boasted that it
has "the best table in North America." And small wonder. The city's
food-savvy diners demand high quality, whether they're dunking a
croissant into their cafe au lait on a sunny terrace, tucking into a
smoked meat sandwich and cherry Coke at Schwartz's deli counter or
dining at 2 a.m. on steak tartare at the Parisian-style bistro
L'Express.</LD>
<TE>   In the 14 years I've lived in Montreal, I've sampled many of its
best restaurants, often with friends who come here from Toronto and
Boston simply to eat. Montreal is more laid-back than many of North
America's big cities, and its inhabitants are ardent about "slow
food" culture. My friends especially love the four-hour French
lunches, consumed with multiple bottles of wine, that seem to be the
rule in the restaurants along Rue St. Denis in the Latin Quarter.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, when food writers applauded Montreal's restaurants it
was for classical French cuisine, possibly the best outside France.
But the city has been in the dark ages when it comes to hip
restaurant trends. While cooking with fresh, seasonal ingredients is
nothing new in Los Angeles or San Francisco, most chefs in Montreal
and indeed in most of Canada, with a few exceptions, have been slow
to embrace the move to organic and local produce.</TE>
<TE>   Though belated in their discovery of the delights of market
ingredients, local chefs are bringing to their tables a growing
awareness of uniquely Canadian foods, which they are incorporating
into their menus: caribou pate and musk ox (burgers, steaks, pot
roast, sausages), fiddlehead ferns and milkweed pods, cattail hearts
from rural Quebec, tarts or reductions with Saskatoon berries picked
by Indians in Saskatchewan, cedar and balsam fir jellies, smoked duck
and maple everything--candy, vinegar, wine.</TE>
<TE>   Many of my favorite restaurants, and those listed here, focus on
"Canadian cuisine," as it's called. Some are well known, such as
Toque; others are neighborhood eateries like La Colombe, the kind you
discover only when you live here.</TE>
<TE>   Restaurant Toque</TE>
<TE>   Toque is set in the middle of the Latin Quarter's restaurant row
on the oh-so-French Rue St. Denis. Recently expanded to include the
space next door, the restaurant is broken up into intimate sections,
each wall a different strong yet softly lighted color such as red or
yellow, contrasting briskly with the waiters' funky lime green
tunics.</TE>
<TE>   The diners in this trendy temple to good eating range from
businessmen to young foodies, but, as in all Montreal restaurants,
dress is casual. On my last visit, I counted only two ties, and one
of them was on a woman.</TE>
<TE>   This is my favorite haute cuisine eatery in the city and a must
for all newcomers to Montreal, a rule of mine that allows me to dine
here at least a couple of times a year. The last time I visited, in
June, I was served an amuse-bouche, an appetite whetter of a plump
Malpeque oyster poached in strawberry vinegar that I'll never forget;
an appetizer of Arctic char tartare in a circle beneath a thin layer
of avocado, chives and ginger-tinged celeriac; and a main course of
fork-tender venison prepared two ways--a grilled filet and a roasted
haunch--accompanied by locally grown white asparagus and sauteed
fresh morels and chanterelles.</TE>
<TE>   Toque's chef, Normand Laprise, has been called Montreal's "most
creative chef" and is widely regarded as the father of the hot
"nouvelle Quebec" cuisine. Raised in rural Quebec, he grew up with
fresh, seasonal, locally available food, and when he attended a
Quebec City cooking school he was shocked by the use of frozen fish
and meat, produce and other ingredients imported from France or the
U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Laprise decided to do something about it, and in the early 1990s
he traveled through the province encouraging artisan growers to
improve quality and get creative. The produce he sought was often
available, but not in enough volume for a restaurant. It took him 10
years to establish a network of producers, but now Laprise has
greenhouses that supply all the produce he needs year-round,
including a salty sea spinach, black raspberries for vinaigrette,
daylilies for their caper-like buds, and three varieties of
strawberries in midwinter--often served with a pomme de glace, an
apple cider from Montreal's South Shore that rivals traditional ice
wine.</TE>
<TE>   Laprise has also mined the country for fresh seafood: lobster from
the Magdalen Islands, Mingen snow crab from the Gulf of St. Lawrence,
Arctic char. He makes liberal use of quail, guinea fowl, duck and
game meats, which are more popular in Quebec than in other parts of
Canada. Laprise's venison comes from near Ottawa on the Ontario
border. "The deer are half wild there," he says. "They live in the
woods and eat the bark off the trees." Along the shore of the Gaspe
Peninsula, east of Quebec City, lambs are put out to pasture on salt
marshes to duplicate the slightly salty flavor of the pre-sale meat
of northern France. But if Laprise has one ingredient for which he is
known, it is his appetizer of melt-in-your-mouth seared foie gras
produced in the eastern townships southeast of Montreal. He prepares
it "a la Toque," which means the dish evolves as inspiration strikes
him.</TE>
<TE>   Globe Restaurant</TE>
<TE>   What Laprise calls "regional North American market cuisine" is
popping up in all manner of restaurants across the city. One early
convert was chef David McMillan of Globe Restaurant, on trendy
downtown St. Laurent Boulevard. Highly rated since it opened seven
years ago, Globe--with its high ceiling, cozy banquettes and French
windows that open onto the sidewalk--serves some of the city's most
innovative cuisine, most of it organic and local. It is also a magnet
for celebrities, from actors George Clooney and Billy Bob Thornton to
Formula One racer Jacques Villeneuve. If you're serious about food,
arrive before 8 p.m.; after 10 the scene is all about people
watching.</TE>
<TE>   My favorite dish is a tender, slow-cooked rabbit, a leg and a loin
stuffed with herbs, with crisp pancetta, Parmesan risotto and
chanterelles. Many of the items on the menu have the no-nonsense feel
of comfort foods, like the baby back ribs with apple nectar caramel
and the "big boneless quails" served with maple mustard and fries.</TE>
<TE>   With a physique that says he likes to eat, the tattooed McMillan
is known as an enfant terrible on the Montreal cooking scene, and
he's not afraid to speak his mind. "Many of the products here are
dismal," says McMillan, who used to travel the Quebec countryside
with a fistful of cash paying double the asking price to encourage
producers to improve the quality. "For organic we're dead last in
North America." But he adds, "We're way ahead in Quebec with cheese."</TE>
<TE>   If any single food group can stir the heart of the French, it is
their fromage. In the past decade, the province has begun producing
fine cheeses, and there are now about 350 types. The cheese plates at
most restaurants include at least a few regional varieties, and some
places, like Globe, serve only local cheeses. There is even an
official Cheese Trail across the province, where visitors can drop
into 49 small producers for tastings.</TE>
<TE>   Restaurant Area</TE>
<TE>   A relative newcomer in the city, which opened in June 2000 and is
making waves and drawing raves, is Restaurant Area, a chic
establishment in the "Gay Village." Restaurant Area is small--all
brick walls, white linen and white leather banquettes with subtle
Asian overtones in its minimalist flower arrangements. Stepping
inside is like entering a cool, serene monastery.</TE>
<TE>   Manning the whisks is 26-year-old whiz-kid Ian Perreault, one of
only two Canadian chefs to make Conde Nast Traveler magazine's 2001
"Hot List" for the world's "hot tables."</TE>
<TE>   Perreault is not afraid to mix ingredients that would never occur
to other chefs, and the results, such as the Malpeque oysters with
herring roe, marinated cucumber and a mint chocolate oil, are
mouthwatering. (Recipes for this and many of Perreault's other
popular creations appear on the restaurant's Web site.) I love his
carpaccio of Alberta beef with sherry-pickled cauliflower, chervil
and dried apple.</TE>
<TE>   This upscale bistro's philosophy is that good food shouldn't be
exorbitantly priced. Dinner in its elegant dining room will run about
$55 per couple before wine and tip and might feature such inspired
Perreault pairings as seared foie gras with apricots poached in
sherry, or salad of octopus marinated in sake with a touch of Thai
cinnamon and basil oil.</TE>
<TE>   Area is my favorite place for three-course fixed-price lunches,
which start at $10 and can include such creative appetizers as
Bordeaux cepe mushroom cream soup with roasted Grenoble nuts,
hazelnut oil, chives and croutons, before a main course of local lamb
shank braised with orange, white beans and gremolata--a seasoning
made of grated lemon rind, parsley and garlic--or a duck confit with
legumes roasted in cumin in a mild garlic broth.</TE>
<TE>   La Colombe</TE>
<TE>   An especially popular Plateau Mont Royal neighborhood eatery is La
Colombe. Now in his 13th year of catering to serious food enthusiasts
at a reasonable price, owner and chef Moustafa Rougaibi produces what
many--I included--consider to be one of the best lamb dishes in the
city.</TE>
<TE>   The funky, contemporary La Colombe is one of many Montreal
eateries where you have to bring your own bottle of wine--a local
tradition but an oddity in the rest of Canada because of the nation's
strict liquor laws. I always bring a full-bodied red to this
restaurant because I never fail to order the braised lamb shank with
a sauce richly imbued with rosemary and garlic and served with Le Puy
French lentils and carrots.</TE>
<TE>   My favorite cold-weather appetizer is the hot salmon and Arctic
char mousse. To finish there is Rougaibi's excellent selection of
raw-milk cheeses, all from Quebec, of course.</TE>
<TE>   Au Pied de Cochon</TE>
<TE>   Quebec's robust cuisine was brought from northern France by
settlers who combined traditional recipes with ingredients found in
the Canadian wilderness. The result is a winter menu of game pies
called tourtieres, ragouts, coarse country pates, tarts and
ultra-sweet sugar pies. Hearty and delicious, these dishes are found
in supermarket freezers, at fast-food outlets and on the tables of
homes across the province, but rarely do they make an appearance on
haute cuisine menus. Except at Au Pied de Cochon.</TE>
<TE>   Its chef, the outspoken Martin Picard, decided to inject 21st
century style and his own considerable character into traditional
Quebec cuisine by recently opening Au Pied de Cochon--Pig's Foot--on
leafy Rue Duluth in the Plateau Mont Royal area. A big hit with the
30-ish crowd, Cochon is a casual and noisy brasserie set in a former
pizzeria whose huge brick oven is put to good use for baking fresh
bread.</TE>
<TE>   Simple dishes like tourtieres go up-market here with camembert and
ham; fish and chips means soft-shell crab and fries; and the flan is
made of foie gras with pureed figs.</TE>
<TE>   There is little on the menu for low-fat dieters or vegetarians.
This is down-and-dirty Gallic comfort food: duck breast, blood
sausage and scallops, venison tartare, tourtiere filled with many
types of game, French onion soup, pigs' feet with Alsatian sauerkraut
and even half-moon-shaped oreilles de crisse, known colloquially as
"Christ's ears," a delicacy of thinly sliced lard--bacon without the
brown bits--that is fried until very crisp. The dishes are usually
served at family meals in sugar shacks in the forests of Quebec when
the maple sap starts running in March. They are not for the faint of
heart.</TE>
<TE>   Picard has even hoisted the humble poutine several notches up on
the culinary ladder. In a province known for great food, it's almost
shameful to admit that Quebec's signature dish is a messy jumble of
French fries sprinkled with pellets of rubbery white cheese curd
drowned in gravy, a concoction available everywhere from mobile chip
wagons to McDonald's. Picard's poutine appetizer is a small mound of
dark French fries in a puddle of rich jus, sprinkled with curds of a
tasty local cheddar and crowned with a seared slice of foie gras.</TE>
<TE>   It just goes to show that food in Montreal doesn't have to be
fancy to be good.</TE>

<CP>PHOTO: It's no wonder Newport Beach reader Halli B. Heston
found the art so full of life in Florence, Italy, a place graced with
the work of Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci, among others. Though
epic lines kept her from entering the Uffizi Gallery, Heston was
intrigued by some moving pieces outside. For reasons unknown, people
were posed as classical sculpture--flowing gowns, alabaster skin,
frozen expressions. Heston wanted to photograph one of the statues
taking a cigarette break, but he was camera-shy. She settled for this
shot of one man transforming himself into a work of art.</CP>

<KH>Her World</KH>
<HD>Tributes to an American 'French Chef' Who Wished the World
'Bon Appetit'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN SPANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The average luminary appears on TV, gets medals, writes an
autobiography. But it takes someone really special to become the
subject of an exhibition in her own lifetime. This year, not one but
three museums--two in Washington, D.C., and one in Napa Valley--have
focused attention on Julia Child, a Pasadena native who turned 90
last month and now lives near Santa Barbara. These exhibitions give
us an opportunity to better know the woman who raised a glass of wine
to the world and wished it bon appetit.</LD>
<LD>   I had the good fortune to lunch with her earlier this year in
Santa Barbara, where she is often seen at the farmers market and in
restaurants such as Esau's Coffee Shop on State Street. At the Four
Seasons Biltmore, the concierge provides guests with
computer-generated directions to La Super-Rica Taqueria, a nearby
Mexican restaurant that's one of Child's favorites.</LD>
<LD>   She wears her fame with a touch of wryness. "I can usually get a
table at a restaurant," she said. When she was asked to donate the
kitchen from her Cambridge, Mass., home to the Smithsonian's National
Museum of American History in Washington, D.C., Child hesitated.
Rayna Green, one of the curators, told me she had to persuade Child
that the kitchen exhibit would have importance beyond Child herself
and the cult of personality that surrounds her.</LD>
<TE>   Green, who eventually won Child over, thinks the exhibition
highlights the role of the kitchen in American family life and its
evolution from the '50s on, as demonstrated by such reliable retro
implements as Child's old Ekco vegetable peeler. "It's a
representative American kitchen," Green said. "Most Americans think
they've been there."</TE>
<TE>   Green helped dismantle the domestic and spiritual heart of the
Cambridge home where Child lived for four decades with her husband,
Paul, who died in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Her Norwegian pine table, the Garland industrial range and her
trusty KitchenAid mixer are in the reassembled kitchen at the
National Museum of American History. I toured it late last year and
was struck by the absence of high-tech gadgets. Green said Child
preferred her old toaster oven to a microwave (though she was quick
to embrace the Cuisinart). When I mentioned to Child that the kitchen
seemed far from state-of-the-art, she said, "It was state-of-my-art,
a working kitchen."</TE>
<TE>   In a few respects, however, the museum's Child kitchen isn't fully
intact. She gave the house to Smith College, her Northampton, Mass.,
alma mater, and her cookbooks and papers to the Schlesinger Library
at Radcliffe. Her copper pans went to Copia: The American Center for
Wine, Food and the Arts, which opened last year in Napa and has a
restaurant called Julia.</TE>
<TE>   The famous pans, on permanent display in Copia's entrance hall,
were purchased in the '40s and '50s when the Childs lived in France,
and they are lined with tin, which "The French Chef" preferred to
stainless steel.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, she also likes France and the French. "They are prickly
but fun," she said. "If you're delighted to be there, they open up
like flowers."</TE>
<TE>   In 1948, Paul went to work for the U.S. Information Service in
Paris, and she took up studies at the Cordon Bleu cooking school in a
class full of ex-GIs, conducted in French. Child, who is more than 6
feet tall, wasn't intimidated. "Being tall, like I am, I never felt
inferior," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But her career didn't get started until around 1960, when
"Mastering the Art of French Cooking," which she co-wrote with Simone
Beck and Louisette Bertholle, was published and pilots for her first
cooking show, "The French Chef," were filmed.</TE>
<TE>   She didn't set out to become America's cooking teacher. In
college, she thought she would be a secretary or nurse.</TE>
<TE>   During World War II, Child was a clerk for the Office of Strategic
Services (or OSS, a precursor of the CIA) in Sri Lanka (then Ceylon)
and China. She flew over the Himalayas as coolly and collectedly as
if on the train from Boston to New York, her former OSS colleague
Betty McIntosh recalled in an interview. In the OSS, she met her
future husband and handled sensitive documents, though she wasn't a
spy.</TE>
<TE>   Child, along with other Mata Haris, is featured in a display
through December at the Women in Military Service for America
Memorial at Arlington National Cemetery near Washington, D.C. The
exhibit is called "Clandestine Women: The Untold Stories of Women in
Espionage."</TE>
<TE>   "Julia was a bright person, good at her job, and she always had a
light touch," McIntosh said.</TE>
<TE>   The silly code names given to secret agents annoyed Child. She
once wrote to OSS headquarters requesting "one of those books you
have giving people numbers and funny names, like 'Fruitcake No. 385.'
Frequently we find references to them here and no one knows who on
Earth is being referred to," she is quoted as saying in "Appetite for
Life: The Biography of Julia Child," by Noel Riley Fitch (Anchor,
1997).</TE>
<TE>   Funny, smart and as practical as a pan--that's the Julia Child you
get to know through these exhibits. And the more you know her, the
more you like her, completely apart from souffles and puff pastry.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Visit the Galapagos Islands--Ecuador's legendary wildlife
preserve--and the Spanish colonial capital of Quito on a low-cost
tour that combines a three-night island cruise with a mainland hotel
stay.</LD>
<LD>   Seven-day packages, from $999 per person, double occupancy, are
available through Dec. 23.</LD>
<LD>   The Galapagos, 600 miles off Ecuador's coast, are considered a
showcase of evolution in action. Their diverse species were
chronicled by English naturalist Charles Darwin, who visited in 1835
and devised his theory of evolution based on the living laboratory he
found there. The archipelago, a cluster of 13 major volcanic islands
and scores of islets and rocks, is part of the Ecuadorean national
park system.</LD>
<TE>   During the cruise, passengers visit five islands and are taken to
shore in small groups, accompanied by a multilingual naturalist.
There is time for walking, swimming, snorkeling and photography.</TE>
<TE>   In Quito, participants take a half-day tour of the historic city,
go on an excursion to the Otavalo Indian market and have time to tour
the region.</TE>
<TE>   The package is made up of three nights aboard ship, four nights in
a hotel in Quito, airport transfers, some meals and sightseeing. Air
fare from Quito to the Galapagos to board the ship (about $340),
admission to the national park ($100) and round-trip air fare from
Los Angeles to Quito are extra.</TE>
<TE>   Departure dates are Sept. 16 and 30, Oct. 7, Nov. 4, Dec. 9 and
16. Longer cruises are available.</TE>

<TE>   Baja: Bienvenidos</TE>
<TE>   See the rugged hills and jagged coastline of upper Baja on a
weekend trip to Ensenada, Mexico, that includes wine tastings and
tours.</TE>
<TE>   The two-day excursion, planned for Sept. 28, departs from San
Diego, stopping in the Guadalupe Valley just outside Ensenada for
lunch and wine tasting.</TE>
<TE>   The Guadalupe Valley is a wine-producing region.</TE>
<TE>   Lunch is at the Pedro Domecq vineyards. In Ensenada, the group
will dine at El Rey Sol, the oldest French restaurant in Mexico, and
spend the night at the Cortez Hotel. There will be time for shopping
and an excursion to La Bufadora sea geyser south of Ensenada. A lunch
of lobster is planned at El Patio de Langosta in Puerto Nuevo.</TE>
<TE>   Cost: $188 per person, double occupancy, or $228 single, including
tours, lodgings, round-trip bus transportation from San Diego through
Baja, a bilingual guide and some meals. Transportation from the Los
Angeles area to San Diego is not included.</TE>

<TE>   Hong Kong: Taste Test</TE>
<TE>   Savor the diverse flavors of Hong Kong's renowned culinary scene
on a six-day tour led by Chinese food expert Leeann Chin.</TE>
<TE>   The tour, which departs Nov. 21, visits gourmet restaurants and
includes a market tour, a cooking class and food discussions.</TE>
<TE>   Chin is a cookbook author and host of "My Country, My Kitchen" on
the Food TV Network. She grew up in Canton, China, and developed an
interest in cooking because of her father's grocery business. She
immigrated to Minneapolis in 1956 with her family, opened her first
restaurant there in 1980 and eventually opened dozens of other

<DH>Nightmares seem to become real in A&amp;E's 'Lathe of Heaven,'
a story about 'where we are and who we are.'</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>What are dreams? What is reality?</LD>
<LD>   Those are questions George Orr, the young protagonist of the A&amp;E
movie "Lathe of Heaven," is constantly asking himself--because his
dreams have turned into nightmares. And his nightmares seem to turn
into reality.</LD>
<LD>   The movie, which is based on Ursula K. Le Guin's classic sci-fi
novel of the same name, arrives Sunday. Lukas Haas plays Orr, a young
man living in the not-so-distant future, when advances in medicine
and technology have not only wiped out disease but also caused a huge
surge in the population.</LD>
<TE>   Sent to a psychiatrist, Dr. Haber (James Caan), to sort out his
dreams, Orr soon realizes that Haber is using Orr's power to benefit
himself. Lisa Bonet plays Orr's attorney, who falls in love with the
troubled young man, and David Strathairn plays a mysterious friend of
Orr's named Mannie.</TE>
<TE>   PBS originally filmed "Lathe of Heaven" in 1980 with Kevin Conway
as Haber and Bruce Davison as Orr. It was Davison and executive
producer Craig Bumgarten who brought this Alan Sharp-penned remake to
Showtime. The pay cable outlet liked the project but wanted to make
some changes. The filmmakers disagreed with some of them and wound up
going to A&amp;E instead.</TE>
<TE>   Bumgarten says this version has tried to remain faithful to the
book in spirit and tone, though some of Orr's dreams have been
altered, especially one in which the world is invaded by aliens that
resemble turtles.</TE>
<TE>   With only a $5-million budget, he says, it didn't make sense to
try to tackle the sort of sophisticated special effects that would
have been necessary. Besides, he says, "Lathe of Heaven" is not about
aliens.</TE>
<TE>   "It is really about the notion of reality and perception and which
state, waking or dreaming, is real and where we are and who we are,"
Bumgarten says. "We felt that by taking some of the sci-fi elements
out of the piece, that the philosophical elements we were really
attracted to would be more fully explored."</TE>
<TE>   Director Philip Haas ("Angels &amp; Insects"), who is no relation to
Lukas Haas, watched a bit of the original film before starting the
project. "I wanted to make sure it wasn't something so absolutely
outstanding that it would be silly to try to have another go at it,"
he says. "So I just looked at it a bit and felt that it wasn't in the
'Citizen Kane' league, so I didn't watch any more. I didn't want to
be influenced by it."</TE>
<TE>   Le Guin's novel, the director says, had much more of a social
consciousness to it. "It is sort of an anti-social-engineering,
anti-utopian piece," he explains. "I wanted to make something less of
a social message and more about how people relate to one another. I
think that it is important that Jimmy Caan's character not be
absolutely evil and have a kind of humanity about him."</TE>
<TE>   The character of Manny is much less defined in the novel than in
this film. "He is one of Alan Sharp's interesting additions," says
the director. "He is George Orr's guardian angel and the one who
guides him through the whole saga."</TE>
<TE>   "Lathe of Heaven" marks a return to acting for Lukas Haas, the
former wide-eyed child star of the 1985 hit movie, "Witness." For the
past several years, he has been concentrating on a singing career and
recently was the opening act for Macy Gray in London.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are an artist, acting can be very constricting," Haas, 26,
explains. "You don't have any control. When a project with a great
bunch of people comes along and a role that I feel I can do something
with, then it is more of a challenge artistically."</TE>
<TE>   Haas says Orr's passivity and inner turmoil intrigued him.</TE>
<TE>   "He obviously doesn't know the difference between his dreams and
reality," says the actor. "The whole time, he doesn't know if he's
crazy or if he's changing the world. It was a very interesting
dynamic to get to play."</TE>
<TE>   Haas drew upon his own dream experiences for the role. "I actually
write down my own dreams, whenever I have one that I remember," says
Haas. "Writing down dreams is a really therapeutic thing to do."</TE>
<TE>   "Lathe of Heaven" can be seen Sunday at 8 p.m. and again at 10
p.m. on A&amp;E. The network has rated it TV-PG (may be unsuitable for
young children).</TE>

<HD>Fixing the Arts High School</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's a shame that the eagerness that led to the creation of a
countywide arts high school in Santa Ana masked serious problems.</LD>
<LD>   The Orange County High School of the Arts, which had outgrown its
original home in Los Alamitos, received redevelopment funding from
Santa Ana to build a bigger campus. The Santa Ana schools, the most
ethnically homogeneous in Orange County, hoped to gain a program that
would draw students from throughout the county, helping to diversify
its population and alleviate some of the crowding at existing
campuses. Santa Ana Unified trustees insisted that the school admit
30% of its students from Santa Ana, and operators of the arts campus
rashly agreed.</LD>
<LD>   The district assumed its students and parents wanted the arts
school, but the students preferred their neighborhood campuses. The
arts school assumed it would be able to admit enough students even
though few Santa Ana students have the means for early-age tutoring
in the arts to make them competitive or even interested. Neither
party thought about how Santa Ana teens were going to attend a school
that goes on until 5 p.m. when they're busy helping their financially
struggling families by baby-sitting younger siblings so their parents
can work. No one even thought of providing school buses.</LD>
<TE>   Yet as the arts school prepares for its third year at the new
campus, people are surprised that the ratio of Santa Ana students is
about one-third the level promised.</TE>
<TE>   The school's chief proposal for combating this malaise is to open
a second charter, an elementary campus for the arts funded by grants
and state bonds that would feed Santa Ana students into the high
school.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal ignores two problems.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana residents are no more likely to flock to an arts charter
for young children than one for older children. And the district
already has the year-old El Sol Science and Arts Academy, an
elementary campus that works for district families--as proved by its
waiting list. It's a magnet school that also serves its neighborhood
and offers dual-language immersion in English and Spanish, a strong
science and math curriculum and enrichment in the arts.</TE>
<TE>   No mistake, the High School of the Arts runs an outstanding
program, but right now it's not a natural fit for Santa Ana, which
has some of the lowest standardized test scores in the county and a
laundry list of more pressing academic needs. Santa Ana parents line
up to enroll their children in the district's fundamental schools,
drawn by the much higher test scores at those campuses, but at this
point they don't see rigorous arts training as part of their
children's academic future.</TE>
<TE>   One day, the pairing might succeed. But instead of squandering
more resources on yet another arts campus for younger students, the
city, district and charter school should be helping to develop El
Sol's programs and find the permanent campus it needs. They should
concentrate on aggressive extracurricular outreach, including music
and art tutoring in the city's after-school programs. Convenient
transportation to the high school campus might help too.</TE>

<HD>Tale of a Troubled Library</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Santa Ana Library faces big challenges on two fronts. It
continues to suffer from a painful lack of financial support, and, in
a city where an overwhelming majority of the residents speak Spanish,
just 10% of its books are en espanol.</LD>
<LD>   The former executive director of the American Library Assn.
describes Santa Ana's library as "probably one of the worst cases in
California" when it comes to meeting residents' needs. The library's
director acknowledges that the system has become "irrelevant" to many
residents.</LD>
<LD>   What's needed is an influx of cash, which will be tough to find
because libraries compete against fire, police and other municipal
services for funding. Santa Ana spends just $12.51 per resident each
year on its library, woefully below the $46.99 per capita spending in
Santa Clara County. The library ranks 142nd out of 178 library
systems in California in per capita spending.</LD>
<TE>   Santa Ana also must get in step with reality. Those who would
rather not see any Spanish-language books, magazines and newspapers
on library shelves undoubtedly are applauding. But they're wrong. The
American Library Assn. recognizes the need for diversity on library
shelves. During its annual meeting in June, the world's oldest and
largest public library association hosted "Children! eforeNinos! Kinder!
Mwana! Les Enfants!," a panel featuring libraries in Tucson and
Queens that are forging strong links to families in multicultural
neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   Reading is reading, whether it's done in English, Spanish,
Vietnamese or German, and Santa Ana should be encouraging its
residents to read. The lack of Spanish-language and bilingual
children's books is particularly frustrating for Spanish-speaking
parents who want to read to their children, a practice that can
foster a lifelong love of reading.</TE>
<TE>   Librarians in Santa Ana are to be applauded for trying to make
reading attractive to children. The library is dedicating a hefty
percentage of its woefully tiny budget to youth-oriented programs, an
emphasis that should help to create the desired foundation for
reading.</TE>
<TE>   Libraries have a strong tradition of providing immigrants with
reading material that helps them become literate and productive
members of society. Libraries aren't required to stock
foreign-language books, magazines and newspapers, but most do so out
of a desire to help foster literacy. No one expects the library to
spend its limited funds solely on Spanish-language titles, but
shelves clearly should reflect the fact that 76% of Santa Ana
residents speak Spanish.</TE>

<LD>As the Stanford 9 test bows out of California, it leaves Orange
County with some school performances to cheer and some more
disturbing patterns that bear careful watching over the next few
years.</LD>
<LD>   The standardized test that has dominated the public-school agenda
during the past five years will give way to a new national exam from
a different publisher, and to an increased emphasis on testing geared
toward California's high new academic standards.</LD>
<LD>   Since the first year of disappointing scores, several schools in
the county have managed to double or even triple the number of
students who test at least at the national average, according to the
latest batch of scores released in late August. Back in 1998, only
22% of the students at Buena Park's Whitaker Elementary scored
average or higher; this year, more than half of them pulled it off.
There are similar success stories throughout the county.</LD>
<TE>   Few of those stories, though, can be told about the county's older
students. Tracking the schools by grade can be a depressing exercise
in graphing, as the percentage of students at or above average falls
off at a pretty steady pace. The most marked difference is in
reading. Nearly 60% of the county's second-graders can read at least
as well as average; that falls to the low 40s in high school.</TE>
<TE>   Just as important as the overall score is how much a school
improved, and here the younger children again win out over the big
kids.</TE>
<TE>   Look at the 54 Orange County schools that, since the tests
started, managed at least a 20-point gain in the percentage of
average-or-better students. One was an intermediate school; all the
rest were elementary.</TE>
<TE>   So what's going on with our preteenagers and teenagers? The answer
isn't clear. Some of it could be as simple as desire to do well.
Teenagers are notoriously less willing to please than younger
students; they're also more able to discriminate between tests that
"count," such as SATs and midterms that colleges see, and tests that
in their eyes make no difference.</TE>
<TE>   Another item worth remembering: The state's biggest gift to public
schools during the past several years went into the earliest grades.
It came in the form of smaller class sizes--no more than 20 students
in first through third grade at most schools. The first crop of
students to benefit from all three years of those smaller classes is
just hitting junior high.</TE>
<TE>   It's not time to panic over the county's older students. Not yet,
anyway. The early grades encompass the crucial years for instilling
reading skills that benefit young scholars throughout their academic
careers and beyond. If the state's strategy is working, it should
prove itself as this group of youngsters heads toward graduation.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, if that improvement isn't showing up within four or
five years, it will be time to question whether California's bold
experiment in primary education paid off, whether reading instruction
needs to be bent more toward the comprehension and expression needed
in higher grades, or whether high schoolers need a bigger share of
the school budget.</TE>

<HD>OCTA's Goal to Buy the 91 Express Lanes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "A Map for 91 Express Lanes," Orange County Commentary, Sept. 1:</LD>
<LD>   The Orange County Transportation Authority should be commended for
its effort to purchase the 91 Express Lanes. A bill is on Gov. Gray
Davis' desk that would allow OCTA to take over the franchise
currently held by a private company. OCTA's stated goal is to
purchase the lanes so it can construct improvements for the 91
corridor.</LD>
<LD>   Orange County Treasurer-Tax Collector John M.W. Moorlach suggests
that the San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor Agency, the public
agency that operates the 73 toll road, should purchase the privately
operated 91 Express Lanes.</LD>
<TE>   The San Joaquin Hills agency supports the concept of OCTA's goal
to purchase the 91 Express Lanes to eliminate the non-compete clause
and allow for construction of new connectors from the 241 to the 91
to ease congestion. Like the San Joaquin Hills agency, OCTA is a
public agency run by elected officials who put public interests
first.</TE>
<TE>   While the San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor Agency
appreciates the ideas that Mr. Moorlach brings to the table, we are
concentrating on ensuring that the 80,000 people a day who use the 73
toll road are provided a reliable transportation alternative to the
area's congested freeways. The use of the 73 together with the 241,
261 and 133 toll roads run by our sister agency total more than
220,000 trips a day, helping to relieve the congestion on I-5 and the
El Toro Y.</TE>
<TE>   We are proud of what we have accomplished and are working to
ensure that the road continues to be a successful addition to Orange
County's transportation network. I would be happy to meet with Mr.
Moorlach about any of his ideas so that we can be sure that the best
decisions are made for the public regarding the future of
transportation.</TE>
<TE>   We are also working toward consolidation of the San Joaquin Hills
and Foothill/Eastern Transportation Corridor Agencies to provide
long-term financial stability for the county's public toll road
system.</TE>
<TE>   Long-term financial stability is important for the ultimate goal
of completing the public toll road system with the extension of the
241 toll road to I-5 in the San Clemente area.</TE>
<TE>   We wish OCTA luck in their endeavor, and look forward to working
together on continuing our common goal of providing the best
transportation for Orange County commuters, residents and businesses.</TE>

<LD>Re "2nd Video Is Said to Justify Shooting," August 29:</LD>
<LD>   Since when is does a "furtive" hand movement give the police
license to kill? Who decides what a "furtive" hand movement is,
anyway? Shouldn't there be a gun (or something resembling one)
attached to the "furtive" hand before police view it as a deadly
threat?</LD>
<LD>   And why are the police reluctant to release the video that they
say exonerates them? Surely, if the police have a video that proves
Gonzalo Martinez provoked them to gun him down, it should be shown
immediately, not after "the district attorney's office finishes its
investigation of the shooting."</LD>
<TE>   Even the police allegation that Martinez made "an apparent attempt
to run them over" sounds suspect.</TE>

<LD>Re "Let's End the Embarrassment of Low Voting Rates," Commentary,
Aug. 29:</LD>
<LD>   Letting someone cast a vote based on a last-minute decision to get
involved is wrong. Many of these voters would be less informed. Some
last-second sound bite encouraged them to vote!</LD>
<LD>   Voting and being involved is not some impulse buying decision. It
is the responsibility of citizenship.</LD>
<TE>   Citizen participation is a cornerstone of our democracy.</TE>
<TE>   When this country was founded, only free white men of property had
the right to vote. That right has been expanded rightfully to every
citizen. Our original electorate was extremely involved and informed.
They founded, designed, implemented and actively participated in the
greatest country in the history of mankind.</TE>
<TE>   By expanding their right to every citizen we all are linked to
their greatness.</TE>
<TE>   How can we ignore our responsibility to our history by weakening
that link and therefore our future?</TE>
<TE>   There are three branches of government in this democracy. Voting
allows every citizen to participate in both the legislative and
executive branches and jury duty allows us to participate in the
judicial.</TE>
<TE>   To me, citizens who aren't involved reinforce the problems that
concerned our founders.</TE>

of the geometry books we use, which are more than 700 pages long. In

<LD>   When I spoke to the teachers about this, they said they didn't
like the books but were required to use them.</LD>
<TE>   In our day, many years ago, the books were about 300 pages long

<LD>Re "Mideast Riptide Touches Newport," Dana Parsons, Aug. 30:</LD>
<LD>   It must be nice to be able to view the world through the porthole
of your Newport Beach yacht. Of course, the tiny opening may tend to
limit your vision. Beverly Anderson's myopic and naive view of the
Middle East may be attributable to her privileged lifestyle and her
unfortunate choice of travel companions. But Dana Parsons,
theoretically a professional journalist, has no such excuse.</LD>
<LD>   His absurd analogy between Israel and Orange County is ridiculous
on its face. Garden Grove isn't Gaza. When residents of Garden Grove
begin murdering teenagers in Anaheim, when they blow themselves up in
the Pirates of the Caribbean, when they fire automatic weapons at
cars on the 57 freeway, when they kidnap children at an Angels game
and then brutally murder them, only then can Parsons make his case.</LD>
<TE>   Until then, I recommend that he spare us his weak analysis of
situations he clearly doesn't understand.</TE>

<LD>Re "Sick Dogs Seized at Kennel in El Monte," Aug. 23:</LD>
<LD>   People who have to give up their pets need to be skeptical about
the use of the word "rescue."</LD>
<LD>   Although the majority of rescue operations are legitimate and run
by dedicated volunteers, there are some that may start out with the
best intentions but eventually become overwhelmed by the sheer
numbers of unwanted animals.</LD>
<TE>   It is important for people who are considering giving their pet to
a rescue operation to do their homework. Get referrals from humane
organizations, and deliver the animal in person. If you don't like
what you see, don't leave your pet. And if you suspect cruelty or
neglect, call the local animal control agency immediately.</TE>
<TE>   For more information on what to look for in a rescue operation,
readers can contact the Orange County SPCA at ocspca@surfside.net.</TE>

<HD>Rodeos' 'Tradition' Is Cruelty to Animals</HD>

<LD>Re "Rodeo Shows the Old West Is Alive 'n' Kickin'," Aug. 25:</LD>
<LD>   Rodeos are brutally inhumane events that result in many injuries
to and often deaths of the animals involved. This "great American
cowboy tradition" includes activities such as roping calves by
slamming them to the ground and tying their legs so they can't move,
using painful bucking straps that cause bloody open wounds on horses'
sensitive flank areas, and jolting docile cows with 5,000 volts to
make them appear aggressive and wild.</LD>
<LD>   In steer wrestling, the macho cowboy jumps from his horse onto the
head and neck of the running steer, twisting the steer's head around
until the victim falls to the ground. Broken necks and many other
injuries occur. One of the Rancho Mission Viejo Rodeo attendees you
interviewed says that this type of spectacle "shows that we're still
united."</LD>
<TE>   Actually, it shows that many of us are still barbaric idiots who
are insensitive to the pain and suffering of others.</TE>

<TE>   These rodeo cowboys should stop kicking and come into the 21st
century. Civilized people do not abuse animals for entertainment.
Animals are flipped, smashed, thrown, twisted, jerked and so on. Is
this really entertainment?</TE>
<TE>   Electric prods, sharpening sticks, spurs and flank straps are all
used to induce a violent reaction from animals. Their forced
participation results in injury and possible death.</TE>
<TE>   Rodeos are repulsive. Perhaps these rodeo cowboys should consider
finding other ways to demonstrate their strength than hurting
animals.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re " 'Keep Out' Echoes From O.C. Canyons," Aug. 22:</LD>
<LD>   Residential opposition to intensified mountain development is
certainly echoed here in Yorba Linda, the "Land of Gracious Living."
I want to ask if you could follow up on our anguish as you did with
the story on the incursions into Silverado, Modjeska and Trabuco
canyons.</LD>
<LD>   More than 100 residents recently attended an "informational
meeting" on the environmental impact report for three large
residential developments proposed by Shapell Industries involving
1,580 acres of hillside. Comments from 20 residents pointed out flaws
and omissions in the EIR and asked for an extension. Two weeks were
granted, moving the submission date to Sept. 23.</LD>
<TE>   Shapell Industries is proposing sweeping changes in the city's
master plan that will change the character of the entire city. One of
the mountain areas to be developed was already the subject of a Times
article on Aug. 11 on its earthquake-prone character.</TE>
<TE>   This mammoth development poses huge problems.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick F. Flynn</TE>
<TE>   Yorba Linda</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I would like to thank the L.A. Times for bringing the issue of
proposed development in the Santiago Canyon area to the public's
attention. The local residents should not be alone in resisting
foothill development. The negative environmental impact of tract
mansion development in this canyon will affect all Orange County
residents who appreciate and walk in the Santa Ana Mountains.</TE>
<TE>   Developers must not be allowed to prevail here. If they do, the
new tracts and their homeowners associations will seal off all access
to the mountains behind their houses and to the wilderness parks in
front of their houses. They will seal off public access to public
lands they do not own but effectively control. How do I know? It has
already happened in Rancho Santa Margarita and Coto de Caza.</TE>
<TE>   One Saturday, I spent three hours cruising among the tract housing
searching for access to the Cleveland National Forest just behind
them. My search was in vain. Every street I tried ended in a
cul-de-sac bounded by a high wrought-iron fence. There were gates,
but they had been padlocked by the homeowners association.</TE>
<TE>   Are the citizens of Orange County to be abandoned by officialdom
and left to our own independent resources to fend off the rapacious
incursions of multimillion-dollar investors? After ruining our views
of the San Joaquin Hills and the coastal zone with miles and miles of
tract houses, these same people want to escape the everyday ugliness
they have created for us by developing the pristine foothill canyons.
There they, and the embezzling CEOs who are their clients, plan to
enjoy the splendors of nature from their ostentatious,
10,000-square-foot mansions and hoard access to publicly owned nature
by keeping the rest of us out.</TE>
<TE>   Christine Speed</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   So self-styled activist Sherry Meddick, speaking about her
opposition to development in Silverado, Modjeska and Trabuco Canyons,
says, "Show me how many of us have 4,000-square-foot houses with huge
lawns up here." Sounds like plain old jealousy to me, rather than
environmental activism. Maybe she should consider getting a better
job.</TE>

<HD>Does Santa Ana Need More Books in Spanish?</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Latinos Finding Nada on Library Shelves," Aug. 25:</LD>
<LD>   More Spanish-language books on the library shelves of Santa Ana
will not pull kids away from their TV sets. It takes a cultural
change on the part of immigrant parents to make that happen.</LD>
<LD>   I fail to see the demand for more Spanish-language books at any of
our public libraries. Just how long is the waiting list for such
books? How many children in Santa Ana will benefit significantly by
its public library having such books available?</LD>
<TE>   It may well be that the current supply of Spanish-language books
in the three branches in Santa Ana is more than adequate.</TE>
<TE>   Ralph Mendoza</TE>
<TE>   Fountain Valley</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I have a simple solution: Learn English! Your staff writer says
that various critics bemoan that the "Santa Ana library system is out
of touch with the residents." The truth is that the residents are out
of touch with the country they have chosen.</TE>
<TE>   Carol Thompson</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The government has absolutely no business furnishing books in
Spanish for people who are immigrants living in the United States.
Councilman Jose Solorio is correct in stating that it is not the
city's responsibility to furnish books in Spanish for their
libraries.</TE>
<TE>   It is the duty of these immigrants to learn English, so that they
may be able to enjoy the greatness of the American system like
millions and millions of immigrants have done since our founding, and
are still doing it.</TE>
<TE>   Solorio is a living example of what the American system is able to
produce, when the person is willing to study and work toward a goal.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Orange County Aims to Add to Park System," Aug. 28:</LD>
<LD>   On the surface, having Orange County buy the 566-acre Barham Ranch
for $4.2 million of our taxpayers' money sounds like a complete
victory for Todd Spitzer and the environmentalists who fought so hard
against the developers.</LD>
<LD>   But let's delve into this a little more to see what the county and
the environmentalists left on the table during their "skillful"
negotiations.</LD>
<TE>   The land is worth much more to a developer today than in the
mid-1990s. I am confident that the Orange Unified School District
could entertain offers from land developers of more than $15 million
for a 300-home development.</TE>
<TE>   If the school district sold the property to a developer with the
condition that only 300 homes be developed, and this development had
to be concentrated on 70 acres near other developments in the area,
while the other 496 acres had to be donated to the county, this would
be a real victory for all parties involved.</TE>
<TE>   First, the school district would receive far more money.</TE>
<TE>   Second, the county could take the millions it was going to spend
on the land and keep roughly 100 county workers employed for an
additional year as opposed to laying them off.</TE>
<TE>   Third, 496 acres would remain open space.</TE>
<TE>   Fourth, this would create needed housing in a county where there
is a massive gap between housing supply and housing demand.</TE>
<TE>   What other great deals is Spitzer negotiating with my money?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Cal State Fullerton Students Reporting for Duty at El Toro," Aug.
27:</LD>
<LD>   Though a handful of students may find Cal State Fullerton's El
Toro satellite campus more convenient, it has already proved a
hindrance for other students. For the fall 2002 semester, certain
classes are being offered only at the El Toro campus, a pattern that
seems likely to continue.</LD>
<LD>   Many students who live and work in North County and who attend Cal
State Fullerton because of convenience are now being told "too bad"
if they cannot commute to El Toro, and it has already pushed back
expected graduation or completion dates while students wait for
classes to be offered again at the main campus.</LD>
<TE>   Cal State Fullerton has its priorities all wrong. Instead of
limiting enrollment and focusing on issues like parking, a notorious
problem, administrators seem to believe that money, time and energy
are better suited to funnel into satellite campuses and additional
dormitory buildings.</TE>
<TE>   The college is a commuter campus, not a small-town university that
must house all students, and they completely overlooked the need for
a parking structure for the 28,000-plus registered students.</TE>

<LD>Re "Dual-Language Classes Train for Diversity," Sept. 3:</LD>
<LD>   Regardless of the success touted by the Santa Ana Unified School
District of the dual-immersion program in Jefferson and King
elementary schools in Santa Ana, their test scores, and the scores of
the entire district, are still among the lowest in the county. A lot
of us with school-age children are beginning to believe that the
district's determined support for bilingual education may be a major
part of the problem, and that board member Nativo V. Lopez is the
power behind the program.</LD>
<LD>   Lopez's push in the district for bilingual waivers has resulted in
a situation where some neighborhood elementary schools offer
absolutely no classes in English until fourth grade, and parents
wanting English instruction find they can't transfer their children
to other schools because of overcrowding. When American children are
unable to receive instruction in English, the language of their
choice and the language of their country, it becomes obvious that the
law passed under Proposition 227 is actively being undermined,
regardless of his denial.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "CenterLine From Two Vantage Points," Sept. 1:</LD>
<LD>   For the same expenditure, buses could carry five or six times as
many people. This may mean five or six new routes with much more
extensive countywide reach than just one train line. In case of an
accident or earthquake damage to the right of way on any rail line,
traffic is halted until the damage is removed and the tracks
repaired. Buses would be detoured to the next available street with
no interruption of service.</LD>
<LD>   Although trains travel much faster between stations, the total
trip time is frequently longer because of the number of stations, the
time between trains waiting at the station, getting to and from the
station to home or the final destination. Bus lines are not too far
away, while it may take a bus ride (perhaps with a transfer) to get
to the train station. One may also drive there, of course, but this
too adds to the travel time.</LD>

delusional. He has four cars and only two spaces. Answer: Get rid of
two cars. It's a simple rule. As for his video harassment, the answer
is simple too. Each homeowner must file an individual lawsuit. He

<HD>An El Toro Airport? Not in Our Front Rooms</HD>

<LD>Re "Rethinking the Will of the People on El Toro," Aug. 25:</LD>
<LD>   The Leisure World residents, who are South County residents, are
sorry, Mr. Ewers, that we give you a pain. We wish to correct you by
changing your NIMBYs to NIMFR. Not in my front room.</LD>
<LD>   A 24-hour international airport, with the thundering noise from
jumbo jets heading for a landing, 500 feet over our heads, spewing
jet exhaust, would drive us out of our homes.</LD>
<TE>   Contrary to your comments, Mr. Ewers, we are very grown up and are
very responsible adults, voting down this awful idea because we are
not willing to allow an international airport to cause the demise of
our beautiful community. The runways are a stone's throw from Leisure
World.</TE>

<LD>Re "Schools' 'Emergency' Is Lack of Cheap Teachers," Aug. 25:</LD>
<LD>   Two letters lamenting the lack of access by highly qualified and
experienced teachers to the education market along with the original
story all missed the point. School boards do not want to hire the
best teachers not only because they are too expensive to start with
but because they are not allowed to hire them at a price they could
afford.</LD>
<LD>   If we had a free market in education, the best teachers would get
hired at a salary they would be willing to take. Then as they perform
as well as they claim they can, they would earn better pay faster
than their mediocre colleagues and we would all be winners,
especially the students.</LD>

<HD>Secession Camps Face Rising Odds</HD>
<DH>Breakup: Leaders say there's plenty of time, but candidates
and experts say the campaign has not connected with enough voters in
L.A.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUE FOX and PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With less than two months left to persuade voters to break up Los
Angeles, the secession campaign is short on cash, endorsements and
high-profile candidates, and some backers doubt they can marshal
enough grass-roots support to overcome the opposition.</LD>
<LD>   Secession leaders are increasingly pinning their hopes on
neighbor-to-neighbor appeals in living rooms and grocery stores.
They're counting on their smaller-government message to resonate with
voters.</LD>
<LD>   But some candidates for elective offices in the proposed cities
are worried that the campaign has not connected with enough voters,
especially outside the breakaway regions of the San Fernando Valley
and Hollywood. The secession measures are on the Nov. 5 ballot.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm concerned," said Oscar Mendoza, a candidate for the proposed
Valley city council. "I think we should have been going to the rest
of Los Angeles by now."</TE>
<TE>   Mendoza said he believes the campaign has time to right itself,
but some analysts say breakup backers are banging a drum that few
people outside the Valley and Hollywood can hear.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no call for revolution," Los Angeles pollster Paul
Goodwin said. "People want change and there's some call for reform,
but the secession movement ... hasn't been able to make a credible
case that moves beyond a relatively small circle of people."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the anti-secession campaign led by Mayor James K. Hahn
is steam-rolling ahead, with $3 million in contributions and
supporters drawn from the political and business elite of Los
Angeles. Running the campaign is a team of pros with one of the best
track records in California.</TE>
<TE>   Like a fledgling struggling to catch an updraft, the Valley
secession camp has held at least three "kickoff" events.</TE>
<TE>   Valley separatists say donors have given about $350,000 and
pledged about $1.1 million more to the campaign, whose original
fund-raising goal was $4 million. In Hollywood, the movement is
largely financed by nightclub owner Gene La Pietra, who is heading
the secession campaign and running for a city council seat.</TE>
<TE>   The secessionists had hoped to attract a field of well-known
candidates with the proven ability to raise money. But with the
exception of Valley mayoral candidate and one-term Assemblyman Keith
Richman (R-Northridge), none of the candidates now hold political
office.</TE>
<TE>   Municipal unions and other secession opponents made sure that no
big-name contenders, like state Sen. Richard Alarcon (D-Sylmar), ran
for office in the new cities by threatening not to support them. The
novices who qualified for the ballot are running mostly homespun
operations, not the full-tilt campaigns that secessionists once
predicted would infect the city with independence fever.</TE>
<TE>   Breakup leaders and some of the candidates have appeared outside
the Valley and Hollywood in a series of forums. Richard Close,
chairman of the secession group Valley VOTE, said the campaign plans
to reach out more with mail, radio ads and public events aimed at
voters beyond its base.</TE>
<TE>   "We will be focusing south of Mulholland [Drive] at the
appropriate locations at the appropriate time," he said, adding that
polling has identified communities, such as Westchester, where
"people are totally frustrated with the Hahn administration."</TE>
<TE>   La Pietra said the Hollywood campaign will send mailers throughout
the city, targeting areas such as Venice, Silver Lake and San Pedro.
The campaign also plans to air at least two pro-cityhood television
ads.</TE>
<TE>   La Pietra, who says he has already contributed about $1 million to
the Hollywood cause, including a large amount to get secession on the
ballot, vowed to spend "whatever's necessary to get the message out."</TE>
<TE>   To win, each secession measure must receive a majority of votes
within either the Valley or Hollywood, and in the city as a whole.</TE>
<TE>   So far, most polls have shown secession winning in the Valley but
losing in Hollywood and Los Angeles as a whole.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the rest of the city, for the most part, cares,"
Democratic consultant Eric Hacopian said. "It's not something that
really drives people. And if people are uncertain about something,
they vote no."</TE>
<TE>   Each day seems to bring secession opponents another strong
voice--last week's came from former Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard
C. Parks. By contrast, secession backers have endorsements from some
Valley chambers of commerce, a Realtors' association, and, in the
case of Hollywood, Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante.</TE>
<TE>   Some prominent Valley leaders sympathetic to the secessionists'
complaints have remained neutral. Los Angeles City Councilman Hal
Bernson and county Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, both of whom served on
the state panel that approved the secession proposals for the ballot,
have declined to take a position on the measures.</TE>
<TE>   Publicly, secession leaders remain upbeat. But criticism has
mounted within the campaign since July, when Close and key secession
backer David Fleming secretly met with opponents to discuss yanking
the breakup proposals from the ballot in favor of a borough plan.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very disappointed," said Valley mayoral candidate Leonard
Shapiro. "The Valley group is not reaching out there. They are
short-handed and they haven't got the money and there is only so much
they can do."</TE>
<TE>   Shapiro and fellow mayoral contender Marc Strassman said their
advice to secession leaders to wage a more aggressive campaign has
not been heeded.</TE>
<TE>   "The case needs to be made more forcefully to the rest of Los
Angeles that it will benefit them, just like the Valley," Strassman
said. "[The leaders] don't listen to me. They don't return my calls.
I am disappointed they are not open to new ideas."</TE>
<TE>   One council candidate, who asked not to be identified for fear of
retribution, said the central campaign is in disarray, with
"political amateurs" fighting among themselves and providing no money
to help the candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Close denied there is division within the secession camp and said
the campaign is in good hands with political veteran Richard Katz, a
former assemblyman, among those at the helm.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to holding almost daily news conferences,
secessionists have launched a mail campaign. Valley cityhood backers
last week sent 500 letters to members of neighborhood councils.</TE>
<TE>   They plan to send mailers later this month to Valley voters,
including an appeal to Sherman Oaks residents signed by Close,
president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 600 people have contributed to the Valley campaign,
including 300 in the traditionally slow month of August, said Anne
Dunsmore, the fund-raiser directing that effort.</TE>
<TE>   "Over 25 years of fund-raising, I've never seen anything like
this," she said. It's unclear whether the cash will buy secessionists
television advertising, which can run up to $1 million a week on
network channels. The effort could be limited to less-expensive cable
stations, campaign insiders said.</TE>
<TE>   Kam Kuwata, an anti-secession strategist, said his campaign will
probably hit the television and radio airwaves toward the end of the
month.</TE>
<TE>   "Once we go up, we plan to stay up for the duration," he said,
adding that perhaps 90% of the $5 million the campaign plans to raise
will go toward television ads.</TE>

<HD>Marlene Adler Marks, 54; Jewish Journal Columnist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY ROURKE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Marlene Adler Marks, whose column, "A Woman's Voice," for the Los
Angeles Jewish Journal revealed her many passions, from politics and
education to hot dogs with sauerkraut, died Thursday at Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center. She was 54.</LD>
<LD>   She had struggled with lung cancer for the last two years, but had
continued writing and making public appearances. Despite her frail
condition the day before she died, she insisted on walking into the
emergency room of Cedars-Sinai on her own.</LD>
<LD>   Friends and colleagues of Marks said she lived with gusto and
enjoyed theater and music, as well as studying the Torah and cooking
with friends.</LD>
<TE>   In her final weeks, she held a "hospice party" for a group of her
closest companions, who had helped take care of her at Cedars and at
her home during her illness.</TE>
<TE>   "She had moments of anger and fear, but she lived in the moment
and always focused on the positive," said her friend Susan Zachary, a
talent manager in Los Angeles who shared Marks' interest in Jewish
women in media.</TE>
<TE>   Born in New York City, Marks earned a master's degree in
journalism from USC after graduating from Queens College. It set her
off on a prolific career as a writer, starting in 1969 when she
joined the Los Angeles Daily Journal.</TE>
<TE>   She went to the Herald Examiner several years later, and in 1982,
she launched her own monthly magazine, Los Angeles Jewish Life. She
was named managing editor of the Jewish Journal in 1987 and began
writing her column, which would win the Rockower and Smolar awards
for commentary in the field of Jewish journalism.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, she also contributed to the Los Angeles Times
Magazine and Hadassah Magazine and published several books, including
"A Woman's Voice: Reflections on Love, Death, Faith, Food &amp; Family,"
a 1998 collection of her most personal columns.</TE>
<TE>   Marks traveled the world on the strength of her columns, touring
India as a guest of the government in 1996, when a trade agreement
with Israel was in the works; attending an international conference
on Jewish women in Kiev, Russia, in 1994; and witnessing the fall of
the Berlin Wall in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Many of her admirers said that her most powerful writing came
toward the end of her life.</TE>
<TE>   "Her cancer columns are her legacy," said Los Angeles County
Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, who was often interviewed by Marks for
the Jewish Journal. "They are her versions of 'Tuesdays with Morrie'
[the best-selling book by Mitch Albom based on his weekly visits with
a favorite professor who was dying].</TE>
<TE>   " 'Fridays With Marlene'--she faced illness and mortality with her
characteristic honesty," Yaroslavsky said. "It was very courageous of
her."</TE>
<TE>   As often as she published, Marks kept public speaking engagements.
In recent years, she was host to her own interview series,
"Conversations with Marlene Marks," at the Skirball Cultural Center,
where her guests included political commentators Arianna Huffington
and Richard Rodriguez, author Carolyn See and Rabbi Harold Schulweis.</TE>
<TE>   Friends said a near supernatural energy propelled her, stoked by a
health food diet and daily yoga. "I never saw her eat anything but
fruit salad," said Rob Eshman, editor in chief of the Jewish Journal.</TE>
<TE>   In one of her last columns, on food, Marks wondered whether she
shouldn't have indulged in her favorite dishes more often.</TE>
<TE>   "I should have eaten more hot dogs, with mustard and sauerkraut."
If she had it to do over again, Marks wrote, she would have given in
to her cravings for movie popcorn. She added, with delight, "Ice
cream is now my dinner of choice."</TE>
<TE>   Susan Rose, now a Santa Barbara County supervisor, phoned Marks
after reading several of her columns about family life. The
intelligence and honesty, particularly on topics such as women's
rights, Jewish activism and single parenthood, touched Rose. (Marks'
first column had been about the death of her husband, Burton Marks, a
prominent trial attorney, in 1987.)</TE>
<TE>   "We had a lot in common," Rose said. "From the start, I felt
emotionally connected to Marlene."</TE>
<TE>   More than once they spent Jewish holidays together, cooking and
sharing recipes in Rose's Santa Barbara kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   "She loved to eat," Rose said. Those times seemed particularly
precious this Jewish New Year, which started the day after Marks'
death.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, Marks faced one of the more confounding traumas
of her illness when she all but lost her voice.</TE>
<TE>   Curious, always, to learn the meaning of things, she asked her
rabbi what to make of it.</TE>
<TE>   They discussed it, after the weekly Torah study group that she
attended at Temple Kehillat Israel in Pacific Palisades, not far from
her home in Malibu.</TE>
<TE>   "She talked about the irony," said Rabbi Steven Carr Reuben, who
led the study group. "She wondered how she could be the author of 'A
Woman's Voice' who doesn't have a voice.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Marlene, your vocal cords are not your voice. Your
presence, what you stand for, your commitments--those are your
voice.' "</TE>
<TE>   Marks is survived by a daughter, Samantha; two stepchildren,
Spencer and Peggye Marks; her parents, Jack and Anne Adler; and a
brother, Alan.</TE>
<TE>   Funeral services will be held at noon Monday at Mount Sinai
Memorial Park in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Donations in Marks' memory can be made to Temple Kehillat Israel
in Pacific Palisades and to the Malibu Jewish Community Center.
Donations can also be made to Dr. Ronald Natale's Cancer Research
Foundation, 446 23rd St, Santa Monica, CA 90402; and Beit T'Shuva,
8831 Venice Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90034.</TE>

<LD>It is obvious to any parent that George Gershwin could not possibly
have had kids in tow when he penned the lyrics "Summertime, and the
livin' is easy."</LD>
<LD>   All over Orange County, children are returning to school, and
parents couldn't be happier. The requisite back-to-school shopping
trips are a scene straight out of the television commercial that
shows two kids with long faces walking down an aisle of an office
supply chain. Just ahead of them is Dad, grinning from ear-to-ear as
he tosses pencils, erasers and three-ring binders into a cart. In the
background we hear the Christmas lyrics "It's the most wonderful time
of the year."</LD>
<LD>   Going back to school may be a nightmare for kids, but it's a dream
come true for most parents. Instead of spending lunch hours running
red lights to pick up the kids from Grandma's house and dropping them
off at the swimming pool for lessons, parents are rediscovering the
joy of an uninterrupted meal.</LD>
<TE>   Dogs are once again able to retrieve the paper in the morning
without having to wrestle with bulky back-to-school ads that added
125 pounds to each edition. And over the past few days, moms and dads
have taken back living rooms that had been occupied for three months
by a nonstop slumber party.</TE>
<TE>   And the money! What in the world will parents do with all that
extra cash now that their summer camp expenses are gone? A large
chunk of that money will go toward school supplies and clothes. Our
recent trip to a drugstore to buy the list of "essentials" suggested
by our school district for our two kids cost $100.</TE>
<TE>   The following day we escaped the heat by going to the mall to shop
for back-to-school clothes. Big mistake. Any parent who has shopped
for clothes for a girl roughly the age of our 12-year-old daughter
knows that both the clothing manufacturers and clothing store buyers
have a serious problem with authority figures.</TE>
<TE>   There is no other way to explain the endless supply of clothes
that would defy any dress code in the land. Shirts are too high,
pants are too low, and shoes are so tall that Shaquille O'Neal would
have to stand on tiptoe to see girls eye-to-eye.</TE>
<TE>   Boys' jeans are so baggy they'd make the Pillsbury Doughboy look
like he's wearing the slim-fit style.</TE>
<TE>   So for all the parents who stuck it out this summer, who made it
through all of the shuttling, summer camps and cries of "I'm bored!,"
here is a list of suggestions for post-summer survival:</TE>
<TE>   1) Use your lunch hour to eat something in a stationary location.
Parents will have to get used to eating with two hands in an actual
room, not the front seat of their car or minivan. To ease the shock
to the central nervous system, it is suggested that a friend or
co-worker shake your chair every 60 seconds during your lunch for the
next two weeks to simulate driving conditions.</TE>
<TE>   2) Reward yourself daily by listening to a radio station with a
mature announcer and not the sound of the latest boy band.</TE>
<TE>   3) Don't get too used to your new freedom--soccer season is just
about to start.</TE>

<HD>Schoolwork in the Balance</HD>

<AU>ELIZABETH TRIANA</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In a few weeks I'll be looking out at the faces of high school
parents on Back-to-School Night. I'll wonder which of them will be
taking their child out of school for a family vacation, and which
will be calling me later in the year to ask why their child is doing
poorly.</LD>
<LD>   I'll wonder how many opportunities for learning will be lost, and
which students will never recover from that vacation. Last year, 24
of my 165 English students were absent from school for a week or more
for personal reasons. Even worse, scores of additional students were
absent for one, two or three days at a time for everything from
snowboarding and river rafting to sleeping late after the previous
night's concert or staying home to finish the science project due
that day.</LD>
<LD>   In reality, "family vacation" or "personal reasons" are euphemisms
for "parent-sponsored truancies." A July 14 Times editorial focused
on the loss of school funding that these truancies cause, but what
about the impact beyond funding?</LD>
<TE>   Parent-sponsored truancies can thrust both parent and student into
an emotional struggle to cope with the stress of making up lost work.
For the average freshman with five academic classes, a week away
means 25 hours of classroom instruction lost.</TE>
<TE>   Merely arranging the time to see five teachers for the work is
complicated enough for today's busy students. Imagine the pressure on
a student who has to make up 25 hours of biology, Shakespeare,
European history, algebra and French--while keeping current with new
assignments.</TE>
<TE>   What priority will makeup work be given when weighed against
sports and social activities? What priority will homework be given
during the time out of school?</TE>
<TE>   The truth is even some dedicated students will set that work aside
in favor of other activities, and then it will be too late to
recover. Moreover, it is a myth that independent study contracts can
adequately replace the classroom experience of peer discussion, an
unplanned "teachable moment" or a revelation that results in a
personal connection to the material.</TE>
<TE>   Well-intentioned parents do not always anticipate or consider the
consequences of parent-sponsored truancies. Nor do they fully
appreciate the stress it puts on a student to complete work early or
make it up later. It's particularly difficult for inexperienced
freshmen or students who are already struggling academically.</TE>
<TE>   It's heartbreaking to see students at the end of a semester
struggling to get back to the C, B or A they had before the absence.
Some parents unwisely listen to students who say, "We don't do
anything the week before Christmas" or "The teacher said I could make
it up."</TE>
<TE>   Students always seem to forget the teacher's stern warning about
missing that critical aspect of the unit.</TE>
<TE>   When I speak to parents about this issue, reactions vary. One
parent felt his son should have been more diligent about doing his
work while they were in Hawaii. Another regretted a decision to
travel, saying, "If I had known she would be failing, we never would
have planned this trip six months ago." A number of parents were
disappointed to learn that the test, essay or project wasn't
completed as their student promised.</TE>
<TE>   Also, it's not uncommon for students to become ill, suffer a
sports injury or have a family emergency, such as the death of a
grandparent. When that happens during the same semester as a
vacation, it means more time off from school. Few parents anticipate
these and other emergencies that compound the loss of classroom time.</TE>
<TE>   Students also can add to the problem of parent-sponsored
truancies. Some inform me ahead of time and ask for work to
compensate for their absence; others just show up following the
absence to ask, "Did I miss anything?"</TE>
<TE>   Parent-sponsored truancies send subtle messages to students.
Endorsing truancy implies that school is not a priority. Despite a
parent's sincere attempt to justify the absence as an educational,
once-in-a-lifetime or family-bonding experience, students see the
contradictory behavior of a parent who professes the importance of
school but then excuses truancy.</TE>
<TE>   Without calculating the scores of shorter absences, let's look
only at the numbers for my vacationing students. Last year, I had 24
weeklong truancies, the equivalent of 120 lost days or 600 hours of
lost learning.</TE>
<TE>   Is it worth it? I can answer that question because I have
experience with this issue both as parent and teacher. Many of us
have taken our children out of school now and then, especially in
elementary school. I took my son out for two days of his freshman
year for an "educational" trip to the United Nations.</TE>
<TE>   I wasn't teaching then, and I thought we had it covered. It was a
disaster that later prompted him to exclaim, "Never take me out of
school again! It's going to take me a week to make up for two days."</TE>
<TE>   And the irony? Today, he barely remembers the United Nations.</TE>
<TE>   Trust me, it's not worth it.</TE>

<HD>Moving Time at a House of Horrors</HD>
<DH>Film: To pay legal fees, Forrest Ackerman is selling his
Los Feliz mansion and a vast collection of monster and sci-fi
memorabilia.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAITLIN LIU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With its voluminous collection of monster heads and ghoulish
figurines, Forrest Ackerman's mansion attracted science fiction and
horror film fans from around the world for nearly three decades.</LD>
<LD>   The two-story, 5,800-square-foot mansion perched on winding
Glendower Avenue in the Los Feliz hills once had more than 300,000
science-fiction and horror film items, crammed into every nook and
cranny. Its walls were covered with movie posters, paintings and
masks of screen legends like Boris Karloff.</LD>
<LD>   But now the 18-room house known as "Ackermansion" feels more like
a mausoleum. The walls are barren, showing only nail holes and loops
of old adhesive tape. Floors are littered with curios, boxes of
letters, books and film photos. Hanging in the basement is a Dracula
cape that Ackerman said had been worn by Bela Lugosi.</LD>
<TE>   Ackerman, the former literary agent for such authors as Ray
Bradbury and founding editor of the cult magazine "Famous Monsters of
Filmland," is selling the house, which was listed for $1.3 million
and is now in escrow.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Ackerman, 85, said he is liquidating his memorabilia
collection to raise money to pay for an expensive legal fight against
his onetime business associate, Ray Ferry.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, in a Van Nuys jury trial, Ackerman won a $500,000
judgment and rights to the Dr. Acula pen name from Ferry, the former
publisher of Famous Monsters, whom Ackerman had sued for trademark
infringement and breach of contract.</TE>
<TE>   After Ferry lost, he gave trust deeds to his North Hills house and
magazine assets to those close to him, and transferred the Famous
Monsters trademark to a corporation controlled by his attorneys at
the Beverly Hills law firm Freund &amp; Brackey, according to court
documents. The firm then licensed the trademark back to another
corporation controlled by Ferry, and Ferry filed for bankruptcy,
claiming to be destitute.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Arthur Greenwald found Ferry's asset
transfers to be fraudulent. Court trustee David Gottlieb alleges that
the trademark transfer to Freund &amp; Brackey was also fraudulent, and a
decision on that part of the case is pending.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Greenwald declared that the attorney-client
relationship between Ferry and Freund &amp; Brackey was "in furtherance
of an unlawful scheme to defraud" Ackerman, documents show. Both
Ferry and Freund &amp; Brackey have appealed, which Ackerman and his
lawyers blame for driving up the legal bills.</TE>
<TE>   But Ferry said he shouldn't be blamed. "It's regrettable he
sustained the losses," he said. But he added, "This is just how
litigations go."</TE>
<TE>   "I filed the appeal because I felt the verdict was in error, and I
have a legal right to appeal," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Freund &amp; Brackey's lawyers did not return calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tragic for Mr. Ackerman. He won in state court. His victory,
at least for the time being, has been taken away from him
completely," said Wesley H. Avery, the lawyer representing Gottlieb,
the bankruptcy court trustee. "It's not how the justice system is
supposed to work."</TE>
<TE>   Ackerman has not collected a penny of his judgment. He estimates
that costs from his trial, bankruptcy and appellate lawyers are
several hundred thousand dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Ackerman now lives in a rented five-room house in the flatlands,
far below the Los Feliz hills, surrounded by a few of his
most-treasured items, including a replica of the female robot from
his favorite film, "Metropolis."</TE>
<TE>   "The Phantom of the Opera and Frankenstein and Dracula all dwindle
in comparison to this," Ackerman said of his legal battles. "[The
litigation] has drained me dry."</TE>
<TE>   Longtime fans said they were saddened by the demise of the
"Ackermansion."</TE>
<TE>   "It's the end of an era," said film director Frank Darabont, who,
along with filmmakers such as John Landis and Steven Spielberg, has
credited Ackerman and his magazine for inspiring him to go into
filmmaking.</TE>
<TE>   Darabont, who directed "The Green Mile" and "The Shawshank
Redemption," said he had visited the house about a dozen times. "You
want something like that to last forever," he said.</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 50,000 people have traipsed through the home to see
the collection, said Ackerman, who kept guest books and gave personal
tours on Saturdays, or by appointment--even letting the visitors
touch the prized items.</TE>
<TE>   A friend who is helping Ackerman said that items that aren't
hauled away to storage or sent to auction by late September, when
escrow is expected to close, will likely go into the trash.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a real shame," said Bradbury, who credits Ackerman with
giving him his first big break in the late 1930s when Ackerman
published Bradbury's first short story, ''Hollerbochen's Dilemma,"
and whose science-fiction classic and film "Fahrenheit 451" is being
remade in a film by Darabont.</TE>
<TE>   Though fans describe Ackerman's cache as "treasures," much of the
collection came about only because he salvaged what movie studios had
designated for the garbage heap.</TE>
<TE>   "Props don't get saved. Art from movies doesn't get saved," said
Harry Knowles, chief executive of the film industry Web site, "Ain't
It Cool." "Forry's collection is one of the greatest ever assembled."</TE>
<TE>   Knowles, who lives in Austin and has traveled to the mansion five
times, said he is puzzled over why the collection hasn't been taken
to a museum, and wonders why Hollywood moguls or film studios haven't
tried harder to preserve it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a statement of Hollywood's neglect of its own history,"
Knowles said. "They don't want to remember the movies they've made.
They want to remake them."</TE>

<HD>Little Legs Rule at AYSO Season Openers</HD>
<DH>Sports: Parents praise the fall ritual for uniting
families--and tiring the most energetic youths.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE ANTON and MAI TRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Soccer may never become America's national pastime, but don't tell
the kids. Across Orange County on Saturday, hundreds of children took
to green fields in baggy pants and mesh shirts, knee-high socks and
cleats to renew what is for many of their generation a rite of
passage.</LD>
<LD>   Saturday was opening day for the American Youth Soccer
Organization's season, a ritual of late summer that has become as
recognizable as emptying beaches and the sun's slanting light.</LD>
<LD>   "This is the fall ritual," Mike Jones said.</LD>
<TE>   Jones coached sons Bryan, 8, and Casey, 11 at a park in Irvine on
Saturday. It was an all-day commitment, but it hardly began there.</TE>
<TE>   For Jones, practice consumes three hours each Monday and Wednesday
evening. There's time spent doing paperwork, taking phone calls and
doing lineups. There's the hundreds of dollars he has invested in
portable goals, balls and other practice equipment.</TE>
<TE>   "When my boys got to the age that they could play soccer, they
wanted to be with their friends," he said. "I wanted to be a good
dad."</TE>
<TE>   Like many fathers of his generation, Jones, 45, didn't know an
attacking midfielder from a back header when his kids took up this
soccer business. So he learned, enrolling in coaching clinics and
buying a dozen training videos.</TE>
<TE>   Doug and Lisa Mitchell prepared for opening day another way:
lugging lawn chairs, a blanket and a cooler full of sodas to watch
daughter, Lindsey, 9, play.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something ... we can do as a family every Saturday," Doug
Mitchell said.</TE>
<TE>   "[Lindsey's] been playing at school during the day, and at home
she's been taking the ball into the street and hitting it up against
the garage door," Lisa Mitchell said. "I didn't know anything about
soccer when she started. I'm still learning. I just love to see her
running around, being competitive. I love to see when she does well,
because it's great for her self-esteem."</TE>
<TE>   In Huntington Beach, several hundred parents and their children
converged at Harbour View Park for the season opener.</TE>
<TE>   "You need to block 'em!" one parent screamed.</TE>
<TE>   "Way to go, Haley! Pass it! Pass it! Kick it hard!" chimed in
another.</TE>
<TE>   Becky Jones, 34, of Westminster said the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks will forever be a part of her family's soccer season ritual.</TE>
<TE>   "It happened near the beginning of the soccer season," said Jones,
whose husband is a firefighter. They have four children in AYSO
soccer. "It's always going to be sad when we start the season, but it
has brought us all closer."</TE>
<TE>   Back in Irvine, Eric Dalh thought a bit about what makes soccer so
popular among children. Behind him, 7-year-old son Evan, his game
long over, ran up and down a hill kicking a ball.</TE>
<TE>   "They just enjoy running as much as anything, I guess," Dalh said.
"He won't slow down until 10 o'clock tonight."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Curve fire north of Azusa, which has burned 18,776 acres, was 52%
contained by late Saturday, forest officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Full containment is expected by Tuesday evening, U.S. Forest
Service spokeswoman Susie Wood said.</LD>
<LD>   Five people have been injured and 73 structures have been
destroyed.</LD>
<TE>   More than 1,900 firefighters and staff battled the flames in the
Angeles National Forest.</TE>
<TE>   The fire broke out beside California 39 near Rincon from candles
burning during an animal sacrifice ritual, investigators said.</TE>
<TE>   The Leona Valley fire, which destroyed four homes and 12
outbuildings on Bouquet Canyon Road, was fully contained after
burning more than 5,000 acres, Wood said. Firefighters were aided by
cooler temperatures and sprinkles late in the week.</TE>

<HD>Wide Mix of 9/11 Tributes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARA MIA DiMASSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To mark the first anniversary of 9/11, Southern Californians will
march in the streets and paddle in the waves. They will pray and toll
bells.</LD>
<LD>   Hundreds of tributes and memorials are planned for the next few
days in fire stations, places of worship, city halls, even shopping
malls. There will be candlelight vigils, sing-alongs, tree plantings
and flag salutes.</LD>
<LD>   They will celebrate the region's multiethnicity--an Iranian dance
troupe will perform at a Japanese cultural center in Los Angeles, for
example--and its absurdity: A concert in Los Alamitos today will
include an Elvis impersonator.</LD>
<TE>   And while no one expects these events to end the grief that
enveloped the nation last Sept. 11, they will offer a chance to find
solace in community.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there is a wisdom, an ancient wisdom really, to grieving
with other people," said Harriet B. Braiker, a clinical psychologist
and author of "September 11 Syndrome: Seven Steps to Getting a Grip."
"It reminds you you are not alone, and it reminds you what's best
about human beings."</TE>
<TE>   "Something about interfaith ceremonies and Americana-style
parades," she added, affirms "what's good and right about people."</TE>
<TE>   Some events will begin before dawn Wednesday, at 5:46 a.m. PST,
the moment the first plane hit the World Trade Center. Other events
will stretch on throughout the day, including a nine-hour procession
of public safety vehicles throughout Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The need for this sort of round-the-clock anniversary watch, said
historian and author David Halberstam, is in part due to the advent
of the modern media. "Modern communications knows how to do
anniversaries," he said. "It begins to get into the bloodstream of
the country that this is what you do.</TE>
<TE>   "A year after John F. Kennedy was killed," he said, "there would
have been some degree of mourning and marking." But now there is much
more, Halberstam said, and it's a reflection of the media age and the
failure of journalists to pursue more difficult and significant
stories. Instead, they focus on anniversaries, which are relatively
easy to cover.</TE>
<TE>   This week in Southern California, many of the memorials are
expected to feature an ardent patriotism that, until Sept. 11, was
rarely found. In San Pedro, a flotilla of 15 Coast Guard vessels,
fire boats and other ships will parade by almost 1,000 military
personnel at attention along the docks.</TE>
<TE>   In Fillmore, firefighters, sheriff's deputies and others will sing
"God Bless America" at City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Fullerton College's "Reaffirmation of Freedom" ceremony will
include a performance by a Native American drumming group.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to remember the people who died but also offer a sense
of hope. It's a chance to reaffirm who we are and what we stand for,"
said Andrea Hanstein, the public information officer for the college.</TE>
<TE>   Event organizers across the Southland echoed that hope: to mourn
the dead and honor the living. They also hoped to reflect on how the
world has changed in the last year. And that, said historian Joyce
Appleby, a professor emeritus at UCLA, is to be expected.</TE>
<TE>   "Only Pearl Harbor would be similar in the past," she said, "but
it immediately plunged the country into war, and everyone's energy
was caught up in that. Here, nothing has been asked of us, save minor
changes at airports. That has made it more difficult. We haven't been
able to act on our deeper feelings of anxiety and grief."</TE>
<TE>   Poet Carol Muske Dukes said she feels that talking about what
happened last year is therapeutic. She will read a poem she wrote
about the tragedy at events at USC and the Mark Taper Forum.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe in the need for words, for public words, because I
think words heal," she said. "And if they don't heal, they clarify."</TE>
<TE>   In Pasadena, no words will be spoken throughout the city's
official hourlong ceremony. A procession of firefighters and police
officers, accompanied by a bagpiper and riderless horse, will make
its way to City Hall, where portions of Mozart's "Requiem" will be
performed--one of 125 performances of the work that day worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the dozens of religious ceremonies planned will emphasize
a need for interfaith dialogue and the power of prayer.</TE>
<TE>   "We want them to understand that spiritually they can be
strengthened," said associate pastor Dale Goddard of those who attend
events, including a patriotic musical, at Calvary Chapel Golden
Springs in Diamond Bar.</TE>
<TE>   For Bill Sharp, a different sort of tribute is in order. Sharp, a
writer for Surf News, will join other surfers beyond the waves off
San Onofre State Park for what Sharp calls the surfer's
"quintessential way" of dealing with death.</TE>
<TE>   "I just felt that, if you go to a fire station and hold up a
candle, that's going to work for a lot of people," he said. "But for
us, it's not comfortable. This is the way the surfing community goes
about our lives."</TE>
<TE>   The surfers will drop a coffee can full of crumbled concrete from
the World Trade Center into the ocean, as if it were the ashes of a
dead surfer, to become part of the reef below.</TE>
<TE>   "The great thing with the ocean," Sharp said, "is that you can
shed some tears and it rolls down into the water and it's washed
away."</TE>

<HD>14,000 Take 'Tour de Freeway'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARA MIA DiMASSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As far as the people of Claremont and La Verne are concerned, the
French can keep their Tour de France; the Italians, their Giro
d'Italia.</LD>
<LD>   The two cities held their own cycling event Saturday. They called
it the Tour de Freeway.</LD>
<LD>   More than 14,000 people gathered on a stretch of the Foothill
Freeway extension in Claremont to take advantage of an opportunity to
ride and walk on it before it opens to traffic.</LD>
<TE>   The 6 1/2-mile extension, opening in Claremont and La Verne in the
fall, has been in development since the late 1940s.</TE>
<TE>   The two cities had been trying to decide how to celebrate, and "We
didn't want that run-of-the-mill ribbon-cutting," said Claremont
Mayor Paul Held.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the cities' recreation departments came up with the Tour
de Freeway concept: a fun ride and walk, coupled with a street
festival.</TE>
<TE>   The event drew a mix of bicycles and riders: tandems and
tricycles, well-used mountain bikes and slick road machines with
aerodynamic handle bars.</TE>
<TE>   One man even rode atop a unicycle in the carpool lane.</TE>
<TE>   "This is so cool," Tim Brayton, 60, of Claremont, dressed in a red
cycling jersey and black shorts, said as he approached the finish
line of the 12-mile ride from the extension's east end to the west
end and back.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to pace yourself," 8-year-old Jesse Martinez of La
Verne said as he rested underneath an overpass, having pedaled up a
long incline.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been practicing," his sister Maia, 9, said as she stood next
to her bike, waiting for her parents, Chris and Lisa, to start moving
toward the finish.</TE>
<TE>   "To see the freeway built and then do this ... " Chris Martinez
said.</TE>
<TE>   His wife finished his sentence. "This is one of the neatest things
you can do," she said.</TE>

<HD>Games Serve Thousands in First 10 Years</HD>

<LD>Danny Hernandez climbs up and down the steps of Dodger Stadium's
Pavilion, high-fiving, shaking hands and starting the wave amid the
3,000  young people and parents who are with him at the game.</LD>
<LD>   For the boys and girls, watching the Dodgers play the Florida
Marlins is one highlight of this year's Los Angeles Inner-City Games.</LD>
<LD>   For Hernandez, the upbeat, 56-year-old founder of the games,
"Family Night" at Dodger Stadium on a gorgeous summer night is a
chance to reflect on the games' success.</LD>
<TE>   This year marks the 10th anniversary of the games--a massive,
year-round, after-school sports, academic and family activities
program that originated at the Hollenbeck Youth Center in Boyle
Heights.</TE>
<TE>   The games, which Hernandez conceived to give young people an
alternative to the streets after the 1992 riots, have served
thousands of youths.</TE>
<TE>   Helped by the celebrity power of actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, the
games have spread to 15 other cities nationwide. Recently, Hernandez
shipped off an organizational manual to leaders who are putting
together a program in South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   "The number of volunteers and individuals that are a part of it
[are] from the educational world, from the sporting world, to the
very highest levels of professionals," Hernandez said. "How can it
not make you proud?"</TE>
<TE>   To some, the Inner-City Games are a ray of light that still shines
long after many other community-rebuilding efforts in the wake of the
riots have faded away.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of the living examples of something positive that came
out of the riots that we can show, now that it's 10 years old ...
kids being given some positive influences," said Bernard C. Parks,
former Los Angeles police chief.</TE>
<TE>   The games became a proud export of the Hollenbeck Youth Center to
the rest of the nation when Schwarzenegger, who serves as the local
games' executive commissioner, pushed for formation of the Inner-City
Games Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Each summer, hundreds of thousands of young people--from San Jose
and San Diego to New York and Miami--lace up their basketball
high-tops or track-and-field spikes and hit the courts and fields.</TE>
<TE>   The national success is largely credited to Schwarzenegger, who
has traveled the country, spent his own money and inspired kids. "We
love you," he tells them. "We care for you. You are great. You can
make it."</TE>
<TE>   Schwarzenegger embraced Hernandez's vision because it resonated
with him personally.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, it's giving something back to the community and something
back to my country," the actor said. "I would not have gone as far as
I did in my career without the United States. It balances out what I
have been given."</TE>
<TE>   At the Hollenbeck Youth Center, crowded with children and young
men and women playing hoops, boxing and pumping iron, Hernandez can
be found on the third floor. This year also marks the 30th
anniversary of the center.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez has led the youth center since 1981, and his wife,
Beatrice, and daughter, Priscilla, 24, are strong supporters of his
work.</TE>
<TE>   The games have grown to involve about 25,000 young people in the
Los Angeles region and the volunteer services of an array of
individuals and organizations--from police officers to the city's
Recreation and Parks Department. Hernandez's enthusiasm has attracted
leaders in other cities to his vision.</TE>
<TE>   "He came up with [the phrase] 'All kids are a lifetime
investment,' " said Raul Diaz, who heads the South Florida Inner-City
Games. "It speaks a lot about Danny."</TE>
<TE>   Others see the games' value as a way to set young people on the
right path.</TE>
<TE>   "Emily Dickinson wrote about lighting the long, slow fuse of
possibility," said Rob Hardwicke, a businessman and member of the
L.A. games board of directors. "And that's what Danny and the games
and Arnold were doing."</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez was raised on the Eastside, and his mission of providing
opportunities for kids is partly rooted in his experiences as a U.S.
Marine in Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a lot more violence going on there than [anything] we
ever grew up in," he said. "This is a pretty good place. And if we
can get young people to develop themselves and get them to another
level of life, we are going to have good human beings."</TE>
<TE>   As the city burned in 1992 and community leaders struggled with
ideas about what to do, Hernandez thought of expanding to the rest of
the city the games that had been held on the Eastside the year
before.</TE>
<TE>   To gain support, and knowing the power of celebrity, he met with
Schwarzenegger.</TE>
<TE>   "I became very interested and fell in love with the whole
concept," the actor said. "I told him, 'I have a bigger vision, a
vision of creating a national Inner-City Games foundation.' "</TE>
<TE>   Schwarzenegger also heads the group that put Proposition 49 on the
November ballot. That initiative would increase state funding for
after-school and early-morning youth programs.</TE>
<TE>   "We have an obligation as a society to provide for those kids," he
said. "When I was a child, I had great schools, great sports fields.
My mother was waiting for me ... my father would practice soccer with
me."</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez has tried to provide such opportunities. He measures the
positive effects of the games by reciting the names of some of the
participants who are now police officers or graduates of top
universities.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez doesn't have to look far to find examples.</TE>
<TE>   His daughter, Priscilla, was 13 when the games were born. She
played softball and grew up volunteering. She gained confidence from
befriending people like Schwarzenegger and then-Mayor Tom Bradley.
She now has a degree from UC Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't have any limitations," said Priscilla Hernandez, who is
a board member of the Inner-City Games Foundation. "As a result of
meeting all these people, I felt like I could do anything."</TE>

<HD>Davis Signs Bills Adding Benefits for Guardsmen</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAREN BRISCOE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis signed three bills Saturday that increase benefits to
Californians serving in the National Guard.</LD>
<LD>   Davis signed the bills in Long Beach after a speech to the
National Guard Assn. of the United States in which he praised the
force as the nation's "firewall between fear and freedom."</LD>
<LD>   About 3,000 people attended the 124th annual meeting of the
lobbying group representing 50,000 Air and Army National Guard
officers, said Kristin Patterson Jones, a spokeswoman for the group.</LD>
<TE>   Two of the bills will provide expanded health coverage and
low-cost mortgage financing for active-duty guardsmen, and the third
will alleviate a shortage of trained drivers by permitting enlistees
16 to 18 years old to operate military vehicles, National Guard
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The role of the National Guard expanded greatly after last year's
terrorist attacks; 5,000 California members activated since then have
served in support roles during fighting in Afghanistan and provided
security at more than 30 airports around the United States. National
Guard members also patrolled border checkpoints, bridges and power
and water plants, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Those deployments created hardships for many members and their
families, said Col. Bill Hatch.</TE>
<TE>   "For many mobilized soldiers, leaving a civilian job means a
sizable pay cut," he said. "We need these kinds of programs to help
take care of them while they're doing their duty for their country."</TE>
<TE>   Davis, who previously signed legislation directing the state to
make up the difference between members' full-time pay and their
active-duty salaries, said the new bills were a continuation of his
commitment to support the National Guard. "They've responded to every
call effectively and responsively," Davis said.</TE>

<HD>Crash Kills 3 Rescuers En Route to Accident</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR BECERRA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three rescuers en route to a traffic accident died Saturday when
their medical helicopter slammed into the ground near the
Nevada-California line, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Killed instantly in the dawn crash were the pilot, flight nurse
and paramedic in the Mercy Air Bell 222 helicopter, said Pat Dennen,
a San Bernardino County fire division chief.</LD>
<LD>   Their names have not been released. However, Clark County
Commissioner Mary Kincaid-Chauncey identified the paramedic as her
daughter, Kalaya Jarbsunthie, 31, of Las Vegas.</LD>
<TE>   "She was a special person, and we are completely devastated by
this," Kincaid-Chauncey said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   The National Transportation Safety Board was investigating the
crash. The accident's cause had not been determined.</TE>
<TE>   The driver in the car crash, Jorge Luis De Santiago, 24, of La
Puente, was taken by ground ambulance to University of Las Vegas
Medical Center where he was arrested for investigation of drunken
driving.</TE>
<TE>   The helicopter, based in Pahrump, Nev., was headed to an accident
in a desolate area named Mountain Pass off Interstate 15 near Baker,
Calif., said Lee Haney, spokeswoman for Fontana-based Mercy Air.</TE>
<TE>   It's the first crash for Air Mercy since the company began
operations in 1988, Haney said. However, it was the third crash
involving a Pahrump-based medical helicopter since April 3, 1999,
when a pilot and two flight nurses were killed near Indian Springs,
authorities said. The company involved in those crashes, Flight for
Life, has since been bought by Mercy Air.</TE>
<TE>   The traffic accident occurred shortly after 3 a.m. between Bailey
and Cima roads about 20 miles from Primm, Nev. The site is on a
roughly 200-mile stretch of highway with few emergency services
nearby, Dennen said.</TE>
<TE>   Because fire stations and hospitals are so far away, the close
cooperation of fire departments, ground paramedics and private air
ambulance companies is especially critical in the area, Dennen said.</TE>
<TE>   "When you rescue a stranger, that's your job. But when you respond
to an incident involving one of your own, it's very difficult," he
said. "It doesn't matter if it's a firefighter, a helicopter pilot or
a police officer--we're all together, we're all family. Sometimes,
we're all we have."</TE>

<HD>The Homeless in Paradise</HD>
<DH>In Growing Numbers, People Find Shelter in Affluent Beach
Cities</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Harry the Hugger sniffs the air from his hiding place behind a
parochial school in downtown San Clemente.</LD>
<LD>   "You know how you tell time when you're homeless? You can smell
it. They're setting up for lunch. In 10 minutes the bells will ring."</LD>
<LD>   Spying a stray basketball in the underbrush, Harry throws it over
the chain-link fence to a group of curious youngsters. "Are you
having an adventure?" a little girl asks, eyeing the shaggy,
gray-haired man and his brown paper bag.</LD>
<TE>   "Yes, we're having a little adventure," Harry agrees softly.</TE>
<TE>   Harry, whose name is Harold F. Moore III, has lived on the streets
of this Orange County beach city since his mother died four years
ago. He knows every fruit tree, backyard garden, and public restroom
in town.</TE>
<TE>   Known as "the hugger" for his gregarious character, he is 49, a
self-proclaimed alcoholic, and one of an estimated 23,000 people who
have no home to sleep in each night in this opulent Southern
California county. That number is up 17% from a year ago, and by more
than 100% in five years, according to county surveys of shelters and
agencies that assist the needy.</TE>
<TE>   While most homeless people hunker down in shelters or cheap motels
in poorer inland cities, hundreds more quietly inhabit the upscale
beach communities along the Southland's Gold Coast. From San Clemente
to Huntington Beach, they set up makeshift camps on sandy hilltops
above the Pacific, tuck themselves behind bushes next to the soaring
concrete struts of the San Diego Freeway, or lie motionless from
midnight until dawn on resort hotel fire escapes.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd rather be homeless in paradise," Harry says. "Why go inland?
People in this town are kind."</TE>
<TE>   Harry's day begins at 5 a.m. He starts it with two quart bottles
of beer, a jumbo coffee, and five cigarettes.</TE>
<TE>   Twice this summer, rattlesnakes have slithered by his sleeping
bag. A fellow homeless man knifed the head off one; Harry caught the
second. Spider bites are a risk also, but right now he is worried
about something more prosaic--head lice.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, Marie, can you get me some of that special soap for lice?
And some of those rattlesnake kits," he begs of Marie Toland, head of
Family Assistance Ministries, which helps the homeless in Dana Point,
San Juan Capistrano and San Clemente.</TE>
<TE>   Toland and others say that while South County residents are
shocked to learn of the homeless in their midst, their presence makes
sense. "Would you rather be homeless in Watts, or San Clemente?" she
asked. "If I was homeless, I'd move to La Jolla."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the homeless here are white; many have roots in the area.
Like many a multimillionaire, those on the street praise the warm
weather, low crime rates, and friendly downtown shops. But they also
rely on public beach showers and ready day jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Harry often works as a casual laborer, earning $50 cash on
average. He has manned a jackhammer; he has done house painting, dry
walling, landscaping, car washing, dog washing, dishwashing,
demolition--everything but hold a full-time job.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody seems to think it's a bad way to live, but it's not.
It's just a different way to live," says Harry. "Imagine this: I'm
not gonna lose the front door key when I walk out in the morning, I
don't have to pay rent; everything I need I can get with my hands.
It's very peaceful."</TE>
<TE>   Numbers Growing</TE>
<TE>   There are 800,000 to 1 million homeless people in the U.S. on any
given night, according to the most recent federal study in 1996. As
housing prices have soared, and an economic contraction has lead to
layoffs, experts say those numbers have steadily climbed. Close to
two-thirds are men on their own, and three-quarters of homeless
adults report mental health or substance abuse problems, or both.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County's coastal homeless fit the pattern, according to
police and advocates for the homeless.</TE>
<TE>   The bulk of people who gather for free meals at parks, churches,
restaurants and other feeding spots are men who have left grieving
relatives behind to pursue alcohol, drugs or inner demons.</TE>
<TE>   Women with children receive top priority for emergency housing
assistance.</TE>
<TE>   Several coastal towns have their own homeless subcultures.</TE>
<TE>   San Clemente is the place, if you're smart enough, to win your own
spot on "the Hill," a majestic bluff that has long provided safe
haven for street people and is now slated to be turned into
multimillion dollar estates. Capistrano Beach churches serve the best
dinners.</TE>
<TE>   And Laguna Beach is ruled by "Big Jim" Durand, 43, who has
organized the tourist mecca's homeless population with the efficiency
of a union shop steward, teaching them how to hand letter the most
effective panhandling signs, which street corners are the most
lucrative, and how to avoid "spring break"--30 days in the county
jail.</TE>
<TE>   "I do their time on my time," laughs Jim, swigging a combination
of carrot and apple juice and cheap whiskey as he struts the
boardwalk. "I go to jail to get my dental work done."</TE>
<TE>   It's a sunny summer afternoon at Laguna's Main Beach. The "smurfs"
are out, as the homeless people derisively call the beach patrol
officers who slap them with tickets for camping, drinking in public
and other petty violations.</TE>
<TE>   Big Jim is keeping a wary eye on them.</TE>
<TE>   "This man taught me everything I know. He takes care of all of us
out here," says Eric, 40, throwing an arm around Jim. Eric says he's
been on and off the street since he was 6.</TE>
<TE>   "Why go get beat up in Santa Ana or Newport Beach when you can
sleep here, with the sound of the surf in your ears?" asks Eric,
gesturing to the waves. "Orange County is so wealthy. The amount of
stuff they throw out is phenomenal."</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Beach police have a less romantic view of Durand and his
friends: vagrancy, disturbing the peace and child annoyance are among
the most common complaints about the men, said Sgt. Darin Lenyi.
"They will corner ladies asking for money, won't let them pass until
they hand it over."</TE>
<TE>   Lenyi said while there are "legitimate" homeless who have lost
their jobs, many of those living on the beach "don't want the help.
They want to be on the street, they want to do their drugs."</TE>
<TE>   Dinner Conversation</TE>
<TE>   It's dinner time in the tiny San Felipe de Jesus Roman Catholic
churchyard in Capistrano Beach. Tonight's menu: roast ham, macaroni
and cheese, and fresh fruit and vegetables.</TE>
<TE>   A group of men lounge on the front lawn afterward, drinking and
singing snatches of rock songs and trading news.</TE>
<TE>   A man who calls himself "the mayor" reports that two local
homeless people have died this month. "Cat Man got hit by a car on
Ortega Highway," he says. "And Danny just never woke up in camp one
morning, I guess."</TE>
<TE>   Leonard Dobbie listens quietly before heading back to his Toyota,
which he has been sleeping in for months. He moves it nightly, but
still is jolted awake by police banging on the window or shining a
flashlight in his eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't want anybody to know we're here. We live in paradise,
where everything is perfect, so we don't exist, right?"</TE>
<TE>   Making a Comeback</TE>
<TE>   Tom and Betty, who also catch meals in Capistrano Beach, don't
even have their car anymore. For now, they are camped next to an
offramp above the San Diego freeway, complete with a sunset view of
Santa Catalina Island.</TE>
<TE>   "This is only for a month or two more, then I figure we'll have
enough to move into a one-bedroom," says Tom, standing outside his
tent hidden above roaring evening traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Tom, 45, and Betty, 49, arrived in Capistrano Beach from Las Vegas
on July 9. Their old car was impounded that night as they sat at a
light outside a California Highway Patrol station. With a broken
plate light and unlicensed drivers, "they told us to get out of the
car and start walking," said Tom.</TE>
<TE>   With that, they joined the ranks of the county's homeless.</TE>
<TE>   "See our double doors?" Betty jokes quietly as they slip through
the gates of a chain link fence. A tiny path scraped up the hill
leads to a camp abandoned by previous inhabitants.</TE>
<TE>   "They had to be a family," says Tom, pointing to a tiny teddy bear
tied to a pine branch. "They left in a hurry--just got run out,
probably. We didn't mess with any of their stuff, we piled it over
behind those bushes in case they come back."</TE>
<TE>   Two single men and a pit bull share the site with them. There are
camp stoves, and a 5-gallon "sun shower" bag--they get water from an
outdoor faucet at a nearby auto shop. Tom watches the evening news on
a tiny battery-powered television before falling asleep.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're tired enough, you can sleep through anything," he says
of the highway noise.</TE>
<TE>   Tom is earning $80 a day remodeling luxury homes, scraping
together enough cash to make first and last month's rent for an
apartment.</TE>
<TE>   His boss picks him up at the side of the highway early each
morning. He has no idea if the homeowner in Fullerton for whom they
are doing $30,000 worth of renovations knows where he lives.</TE>
<TE>   The middle finger on Tom's right hand is gray and stiffly crooked.
He crushed it with a tool at work, but hasn't had time to get it
examined, and doesn't know where he would go anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Both he and Betty like California, though.</TE>
<TE>   "People are a lot friendlier than Las Vegas," she says. "And it's
real pretty."</TE>
<TE>   But they can't wait to move into their own place.</TE>
<TE>   Staring out at the sun sinking beyond the freeway, he says, "I
don't hold no grudges. I don't blame nobody but myself. I'm gonna get
out of this. I don't know when, but I'm going to."</TE>

<HD>Man Slain by Police Had Been Trying to Turn Life Around</HD>
<DH>Long Beach: John Jordan, whose family lost its
wrongful-death suit in his killing, had sought to leave behind a
troubled past, his kin say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN MERL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The defendants in the civil wrongful-death suit were the city of Long
Beach, its Police Department and five of its officers. Yet, as the
weeks of testimony unfolded this summer, it often seemed that the
young man police had killed--during a mistaken-identity pursuit--was
the one on trial.</LD>
<LD>   Day after day, the character and troubled life of John Francis
Jordan were dissected for the jury as witnesses answered questions
about everything from his friends and his job to his stint in state
prison.</LD>
<LD>   Jurors on Friday sided with the city, finding 10 to 2 that the
officers who had shot Jordan to death had neither used unreasonable
force nor acted negligently.</LD>
<TE>   According to his family and friends, Jordan was well on the road
to leaving his past behind when he was killed three years ago. They
said he had mended once-frayed family ties and had held a steady job
for the first time in his 26 years; he was even talking about finally
finishing high school.</TE>
<TE>   He was excited about his girlfriend's pregnancy--it would be his
second child--and the couple planned to marry soon. Drug use and
other criminal activity were behind him, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "He was no angel, but he was really turning his life around, and
he sure didn't deserve to die like that," said Jordan's uncle, Mike
Jordan. Mike Jordan drove his ailing brother, Gregory--John's
father--to the Los Angeles County courtroom in Compton daily and sat
with him through weeks of testimony.</TE>
<TE>   But the attorney defending the suit and the witnesses he called to
the stand painted a very different picture of John Francis Jordan:
that of a drug user and a white supremacist prison gang member who
had been far from mending his ways.</TE>
<TE>   At least two witnesses said he had been acting high on the night
of the shooting, and the coroner reported having found
methamphetamines in Jordan's body. After several months as a model
employee at a Carson electric cord company, Jordan had been fired a
short time before the shooting for excessive absences.</TE>
<TE>   "This was one nogoodnik, who basically was the architect of his
own demise," said William A. Reidder, senior deputy city attorney for
Long Beach. He said Jordan wanted to commit "suicide by cop" rather
than face the prospect of more time behind bars.</TE>
<TE>   Police, Reidder said, had reason to believe Jordan had a gun with
him on the night they shot him as he ran through yards and over
fences in a tidy, blue-collar neighborhood of North Long Beach.
Police did not find a weapon on Jordan's body, however, or along the
nearly four-block route of the chase. (During the trial, Reidder
tried to establish that a friend of Jordan's had found a gun on a
rooftop and hidden it from authorities, a theory hotly disputed by
the Jordans' attorneys.)</TE>
<TE>   Although the trial did not draw much media attention, it came
during a summer of heightened police criticism caused by several
incidents. There was, for example, the videotaped beating of a
16-year-old boy by an Inglewood police officer.</TE>
<TE>   And in Long Beach, civil rights groups were demanding justice for
two African American women shot to death by police in separate
incidents; each woman had been wielding a knife.</TE>
<TE>   Glenda Lee Rymer, 49, died after being hit with a "less lethal"
bean bag shot as police tried to disarm her outside her apartment in
June 2001.</TE>
<TE>   In January, police shot mentally ill Marcella Byrd, 57, after she
left a market without paying for groceries and raised an 8-inch knife
toward officers as they followed her, commanding her to drop the
knife. Police said the bean bags they fired initially had had no
effect.</TE>
<TE>   "This Southern California law enforcement environment is
unbelievable to me. It's almost like an occupying force," said
William J. Clough, a Jordan attorney and former police officer.</TE>
<TE>   The Jordan family suit, brought two years ago by Gregory Jordan on
behalf of his son's children, Justin now 10, and Jahni, now 2, and
Jahni's mother, sought $10 million.</TE>
<TE>   John Jordan died shortly after 8 p.m. Sept. 3, 1999, shot as he
tried to scale a fence after eluding police, and their periodic
shots, for nearly half an hour. Officers said he was reaching for his
waistband, leading them to believe he was going for a gun.</TE>
<TE>   About 20 officers had joined the chase on foot, along with three
police dog units and a police helicopter, which kept its light on
Jordan as he emerged from a hiding spot and resumed running. Officers
had fired more than 20 shots; some of the bullets lodged in nearby
homes and garages.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan had been spending that Friday evening hanging out with
others at a friend's bungalow on East Washington Street. Authorities
said the bungalow was familiar to police as a "drug house." Two trial
witnesses testified that there had been at least one gun on the
premises that night.</TE>
<TE>   Police said they were looking for an armed-robbery suspect named
Troy Cunningham when they went to the house after a report of drug
use there.</TE>
<TE>   Cunningham was a muscular man, more than 6 feet tall and weighing
200 pounds or more, with long, light-colored hair. Jordan was
considerably smaller--5 feet 7, according to a company physical he
received a few months earlier--and had close-cropped dark hair.</TE>
<TE>   But when officers saw Jordan--apparently afraid of being
arrested--jump out a rear window and take off running, they said they
believed he was Cunningham, armed and dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   The woman who lived in the house testified that she had told
officers the fleeing man was not Cunningham.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Clough and his partner, Ralph D. Hughes, another former
policeman, contended that sloppy police work and a "cavalier"
attitude had led to what they described as the "completely
unjustifiable" shooting death of a man who was not wanted for any
crime.</TE>
<TE>   "John Jordan was the victim here, not the bad guy," said Lennie
Harris of the October 22 Coalition to Stop Police Brutality, a
national organization trying to call attention to cases such as
Jordan's.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach officials investigated the shooting and found it to be
justified. The district attorney's office, which reviewed the Long
Beach report, concurred.</TE>
<TE>   But Gregory Jordan, a former diesel machinist at the Port of Long
Beach who spent the day after the shooting scouring the neighborhood
for witnesses, persisted. Despite a series of back surgeries and
other health problems, he joined activists seeking justice in other
police incidents, and handed out pamphlets and spoke at a
demonstration during the Democratic National Convention in Los
Angeles. A few days later, he filed his lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd never seen this side of the Police Department," Gregory
Jordan said outside the courthouse one recent day during a lunch
break.</TE>
<TE>   "This has really taken a toll on us ... and just when John had
started to turn things around," Jordan said.</TE>
<TE>   John and his older brother were born in Long Beach. Their parents
split when they were small, and the boys lived with their mother. She
died after a short bout with cancer when the boys were teenagers, and
John seemed to take her death especially hard, John's father said.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw a real change in him about then," Gregory Jordan said.
John, never a strong student, dropped out of David Starr Jordan High
School. He became a father at 18; his girlfriend died, also of
cancer, when their son was just a few months old, Gregory Jordan
said.</TE>
<TE>   There were scrapes with the law: driving under the influence, auto
theft, drug use, court records show. In 1993 he was sentenced to
state prison for methamphetamine possession and illegally having a
firearm: a .22-caliber handgun. In prison he joined a white
supremacist gang known as the Nazi Low Riders and wore its tattoos.</TE>
<TE>   His family said he joined the gang, not because of racism, but for
protection. That he did not have the tattoos removed after prison was
a sign, the city contended in court, that he had not been serious
about turning over a new leaf.</TE>
<TE>   But Gregory Jordan said his son had kept the tattoos covered
around the family and at work. The supervisor at the firm where John
Jordan worked as a warehouseman for several months said he had never
seen the tattoos or any other sign of Jordan's troubled past.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a good worker, got along with everybody," the supervisor,
Hector Trigueros, said in an interview. He said he had been puzzled
when Jordan, after getting a leave of absence, declined to return to
work, forcing his termination.</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, Gregory Jordan said, the last months of his son's
life were the happiest. Father and son had reconciled after a long
estrangement. John was again close to his older brother, who had
helped him find a job. He was attending family gatherings, spending
time with his son and looking forward to the birth of his next child,
his father said.</TE>
<TE>   The father cannot understand what the son was doing on East
Washington Street that night, let alone why he had run from police.</TE>
<TE>   "He had told us he was tired of getting in trouble, and he was on
his way to a better life," he said. "I don't know; maybe he just got
caught up in a party situation."</TE>

<HD>Teens Ready to Move On</HD>
<DH>Anniversary: Group of young writers meets to talk about how
Sept. 11 changed their lives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIKA HAYASAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A year ago, a group of teenagers met and discussed apprehension about
the pending war, anger over anti-Arab American sentiment, horror over
images of the burning World Trade Center towers and fear for their
safety.</LD>
<LD>   On Saturday, nearly 30 teens gathered in the same manner as they
had last year at the headquarters of LA Youth newspaper, to talk
about how their lives have changed in the past year.</LD>
<LD>   This time, the resounding sentiment was that Americans need to
stop dwelling on the disaster and sorrow and move on.</LD>
<TE>   Connie Chung, 15, a Gabrielino High School student, said she still
can't watch the news without hearing something about terrorism, war
or grief. "I'm sick of it; it's getting tired," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Beverly Hills High School student Jennifer Gottesfeld, 16, said:
"We've become a little bit desensitized. After the 150th time, it was
like, please stop playing this."</TE>
<TE>   The students who met Saturday are contributors to LA Youth, an
independent newspaper written by teenagers for a teenage readership.
Some are aspiring journalists who regularly follow media coverage,
while others are interested in politics and current events. Many said
they are dreading the anniversary because the media will rehash news
stories about loss and fear.</TE>
<TE>   Donna Myrow, LA Youth executive director, said most teens are over
the shock and distress of Sept. 11. Instead, they are thinking, "What
is my next step?" she said.</TE>
<TE>   "They move on with new trends, fashion, music, entertainment," she
said. "They're looking at how they're going to finance college, and
how they're going to get through high school."</TE>
<TE>   A year later, teens say their lives have changed only in minor
ways. Some schools began allowing cell phones in case of emergencies
last year. One teenager said it is now a major pain to get his pager
or laptop computer through airline security. Another teen was annoyed
that in the past year her favorite soap opera has been interrupted by
newscasts about war or terrorism threats. Some said their e-mail
boxes have been bombarded with post-9/11 chain letters, myths and
jokes about Osama bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   Others, like Gottesfeld, have been more seriously affected.</TE>
<TE>   Gottesfeld is worried about how she will pay for college. She had
a limited budget to begin with, and since the economy has plunged,
more students may apply to less expensive colleges, making admittance
for her even more difficult, she said.</TE>
<TE>   For Tory Fine, a 17-year-old student at Marlborough School in
Hancock Park, Sept. 11 made her more committed to her future career.</TE>
<TE>   "Before Sept. 11, I wanted to be a journalist because I thought it
would be really fun and I enjoy writing," she said.</TE>
<TE>   After watching the media coverage, which she said was at times
sensationalistic, she said she wants to play a role in how news is
presented. She wants it to be more informative and responsible, and
less propaganda, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a purpose now," she said.</TE>

<HD>The 'Homeless in Paradise' Inhabit Beach Cities in Growing
Numbers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Harry the Hugger sniffs the air from his hiding place behind a
parochial school in downtown San Clemente.</LD>
<LD>   "You know how you tell time when you're homeless? You can smell
it. They're setting up for lunch. In 10 minutes the bells will ring."</LD>
<LD>   Spying a stray basketball in the underbrush, Harry throws it over
the chain-link fence to a group of curious youngsters. "Are you
having an adventure?" a little girl asks, eyeing the shaggy,
gray-haired man and his brown paper bag.</LD>
<TE>   "Yes, we're having a little adventure," Harry agrees softly.</TE>
<TE>   Harry, whose name is Harold F. Moore III, has lived on the streets
of this Orange County beach city since his mother died four years
ago. He knows every fruit tree, backyard garden, and public restroom
in town.</TE>
<TE>   Known as "the hugger" for his gregarious character, he is 49, a
self-proclaimed alcoholic, and one of an estimated 23,000 people who
have no home to sleep in each night in this opulent southern
California county.</TE>
<TE>   That number is up 17% from a year ago, and up more than 100% in
five years, according to county surveys of shelters and agencies that
assist the needy.</TE>
<TE>   While most homeless people hunker down in shelters or cheap motels
in the poorer inland cities, hundreds more quietly inhabit the
upscale beach communities along the Southland's Gold Coast. From San
Clemente to Huntington Beach, they set up makeshift camps on sandy
hilltops above the Pacific, tuck themselves behind bushes next to the
soaring concrete struts of the San Diego Freeway, or lie motionless
from midnight until dawn on resort hotel fire escapes.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd rather be homeless in paradise," Harry says. "Why go inland?
People in this town are kind."</TE>
<TE>   Harry's day begins at 5 a.m. He starts it with two quart bottles
of beer, a jumbo coffee, and five cigarettes.</TE>
<TE>   Twice this summer, rattlesnakes have slithered by his sleeping
bag. A fellow homeless man knifed the head off one; Harry caught the
second. Spider bites are also a risk, but right now, he is worried
about something more prosaic--head lice.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, Marie, can you get me some of that special soap for lice?
And some of those rattlesnake kits," he begs of Marie Toland, head of
Family Assistance Ministries, which helps the homeless in Dana Point,
San Juan Capistrano and San Clemente.</TE>
<TE>   Toland and others say that although south Orange County residents
are shocked to learn of the homeless in their midst, it makes sense
that they are there. "Would you rather be homeless in Watts, or San
Clemente?" she asked. "If I was homeless, I'd move to La Jolla."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the homeless here are white; many have roots in the area.
Like many a multimillionaire, those on the street praise the warm
weather, low crime rate, and friendly downtown shops. But they also
rely on public beach showers and ready day jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Harry often works as a casual laborer, earning $50 cash on
average. He has manned a jackhammer; he has done house painting, dry
walling, landscaping, car washing, dog washing, dishwashing,
demolition--everything but hold a full-time job.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody seems to think it's a bad way to live, but it's not.
It's just a different way to live," says Harry. "Imagine this: I'm
not gonna lose the front door key when I walk out in the morning, I
don't have to pay rent, everything I need I can get with my hands.
It's very peaceful."</TE>
<TE>   There are 800,000 to 1 million homeless people in the United
States on any given night, according to the most recent federal study
in 1996. As housing prices have soared, and an economic contraction
has lead to layoffs, experts say those numbers have steadily climbed.
Close to two-thirds are men on their own, and three-quarters of
homeless adults report mental health or substance abuse problems, or
both.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County's coastal homeless fit the pattern, according to
police and homeless advocates.</TE>
<TE>   The bulk of people who gather for free meals at parks, churches,
restaurants and other feeding spots are men who have left grieving
relatives behind to pursue alcohol, drugs or inner demons. Women with
children receive top priority for emergency housing assistance.</TE>
<TE>   Several coastal towns have their own homeless subcultures. San
Clemente is the place, if you're smart enough, to win your own spot
on "the Hill," a majestic bluff that has long provided safe haven for
street people and is now slated to be turned into multimillion dollar
estates.</TE>
<TE>   And Capistrano Beach churches serve the best dinners.</TE>
<TE>   At the tiny San Felipe de Jesus Roman Catholic churchyard in
Capistrano Beach, for example, tonight's menu is roast ham, macaroni
and cheese, and fresh fruit and vegetables.</TE>
<TE>   A group of men lounge on the front lawn afterward, drinking and
singing snatches of rock songs, and trading news.</TE>
<TE>   A man who calls himself "the mayor" reports that two local
homeless people have died this month.</TE>
<TE>   "Cat Man got hit by a car on Ortega Highway," he says. "And Danny
just never woke up in camp one morning, I guess."</TE>
<TE>   Leonard Dobbie listens quietly before heading back to his Toyota,
which he has been sleeping in for months. He moves it nightly, but
still is jolted awake by police banging on the window or shining a
flashlight in his eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't want anybody to know we're here," he says. "We live in
paradise, where everything is perfect, so we don't exist, right?"</TE>
<TE>   Tom and Betty, who also catch meals in Capistrano Beach, don't
have their car anymore. For now, they are camped next to an offramp
above the San Diego freeway, complete with a sunset view of Santa
Catalina Island.</TE>
<TE>   "This is only for a month or two more, then I figure we'll have
enough to move into a one bedroom," says Tom, standing outside his
tent hidden above roaring evening traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Tom, 45, and Betty, 49, arrived in Capistrano Beach from Las Vegas
on July 9. Their car was impounded that night as they sat at a light
outside a California Highway Patrol station. With a broken plate
light and no driver's license, "they told us to get out of the car
and start walking," said Tom.</TE>
<TE>   With that, they joined the ranks of the county's homeless.</TE>
<TE>   A tiny path scraped up the hill leads to a camp they share with
two single men and a pit bull. There are camp stoves, and a 5-gallon
"sun shower" bag--they get water from an outdoor faucet at a nearby
auto shop. Tom watches the evening news on a tiny battery-powered
television before falling asleep.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're tired enough, you can sleep through anything," he says
of the highway noise.</TE>
<TE>   Tom is earning $80 a day remodeling luxury homes, scraping
together enough cash to make first and last month's rent for an
apartment. His boss picks him up at the side of the highway early
each morning. He has no idea if the homeowner in Fullerton for whom
they are doing $30,000 worth of renovations knows where he lives.</TE>
<TE>   The middle finger on Tom's right hand is gray and stiffly crooked.
He crushed it with a tool at work, but hasn't had time to get it
examined, and doesn't know where he would go, anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Both he and Betty like California, though.</TE>
<TE>   "People are a lot friendlier than Las Vegas," she says. "And it's
real pretty."</TE>
<TE>   But they can't wait to move into their own place.</TE>
<TE>   Staring out at the sun sinking beyond the freeway, he says, "I
don't hold no grudges, I don't blame nobody but myself. I'm gonna get
out of this--I don't know when, but I'm going to."</TE>

<LD>It was early afternoon when Michael Adelson, 42, called his mother
and uttered the words she had been dreading.</LD>
<LD>   "I think I've done something to kill myself," he told Sandy Smith
Levine.</LD>
<LD>   Smith Levine, who lived near her son's Woodland Hills apartment,
called 911 and then got into her car and raced over there.</LD>
<TE>   "I was just thinking, 'I've got to save him,' " says the retired
executive assistant, certain that her son had taken an overdose of
pills.</TE>
<TE>   The problems had begun when he was a teenager and they had grown
steadily worse. A graduate of UCLA's law school, her son was
unemployed, abusive and sinking into the darkness of what she
believed was manic depression.</TE>
<TE>   "I got there and banged on the door," Smith Levine says, reliving
the events of March 22.</TE>
<TE>   Her son answered, giving her a moment of relief that quickly
turned to still more torment.</TE>
<TE>   What sick game was he playing now?</TE>
<TE>   Adelson told his mother he had called off the paramedics, telling
them it was all a mistake. He had merely dreamed of committing
suicide.</TE>
<TE>   Smith Levine scolded him and left the apartment, her heart broken
by her son's deterioration. Then she called the LAPD and told them he
still might kill himself.</TE>
<TE>   Police confiscated an unregistered .357 Colt revolver and took
Adelson into protective custody, transporting him to Olive View-UCLA
Medical Center for an evaluation and possible 72-hour commitment.</TE>
<TE>   After an exam that took less than two hours, Adelson, the divorced
father of two teenage sons, was told to see his regular therapist and
discharged.</TE>
<TE>   Smith Levine could not believe he'd been released as quickly and
easily as that. She called police, fearing that he'd retrieve the
gun, and she says they told her not to worry. He couldn't get it back
without a court hearing.</TE>
<TE>   But on April 23, Adelson went back to the West Valley police
station in Reseda and was given his gun.</TE>
<TE>   At 8:50 p.m. on May 15, he dialed 911, put that very Colt revolver
to his head, and declared:</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to kill myself. Goodbye."</TE>
<TE>   The bullet entered one temple and exited the other.</TE>
<TE>   And now everyone washes their hands.</TE>
<TE>   The police say they did nothing wrong.</TE>
<TE>   The hospital, through a county spokesman, says it did nothing
wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Smith Levine buried her son, and almost four months later she's
wondering when any of it will make sense.</TE>
<TE>   A sick man threatens to kill himself after years of misery, an
unregistered gun is taken from him, the hospital sends him home
before checking in with his family or his psychiatrist, and getting
the gun back from the police is easier than getting a fishing
license.</TE>
<TE>   "How can this happen?" asks Smith Levine, who now lives in Sherman
Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   She knows part of the answer. Her son was as smart as he was
disturbed, and he was a master manipulator.</TE>
<TE>   The psychiatrist at Olive View found him too healthy to be held
for a 72-hour evaluation. He was "sad" and "animated," says the
doctor's report, but "cooperative" and neither delusional nor
suicidal. Had Adelson been held, he would not have been able to get
his hands on the Colt .357 for five years without a court hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Swanston, the LAPD West Valley detective who handed the gun
back to Adelson, says he couldn't do anything else, even though the
gun was unregistered.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no law that says you have to register a gun as a private
citizen," says Swanston.</TE>
<TE>   "The law says you can't have a stolen gun, but mere possession of
a gun that's not registered is not a crime."</TE>
<TE>   You hear these things, Smith Levine says, and you wonder who's
crazier. The patients, or the players in the revolving door that
swings through the mental health system, law enforcement and the
courts.</TE>
<TE>   Swanston ran a computer check and found that Adelson's gun was not
stolen and had not been involved in a crime, so he couldn't keep it
on those grounds.</TE>
<TE>   He checked twice to see whether the state Department of Justice
had placed a hold on it at the request of doctors. But because
Adelson had not technically been admitted to Olive View, the gun had
no strings attached.</TE>
<TE>   Swanston was going through the death and injury reports one day
and came across a suicide.</TE>
<TE>   "As soon as I saw his name, I thought, 'Uh-oh, this is the man we
gave the gun to a week or two ago.' It was a horrible feeling, but
there's nothing we could have done any differently," Swanston says.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel sad for his mother because of this horrible tragedy, but
if we didn't give him the gun back, he could have walked down to the
gun store to buy one, or he could have bought one on the street, or
he could have used another method."</TE>
<TE>   All of that is true. But that doesn't let Smith Levine sleep any
easier. When she isn't asking questions of the authorities, she's
asking questions of herself.</TE>
<TE>   Did she do all she could have for her son?</TE>
<TE>   Did she cook enough meals when he wouldn't fend for himself, and
pay his rent often enough when he couldn't hold a job?</TE>
<TE>   He saw a therapist, but should she have tried harder to get him
more help, even though he drove her away with his increasingly
psychotic rants?</TE>
<TE>   The story of her utter helplessness and frustration has been told
a thousand times over by families of the depressed and mentally
disturbed, says Assemblywoman Helen Thomson (D-Davis), a former
psychiatric nurse.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, legislation by Thomson allowed families to begin
testifying in commitment hearings. She also wrote a bill--passed by
the Legislature and now in the hands of Gov. Gray Davis--that would
allow for involuntary outpatient treatment.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of Michael Adelson, Olive View would have had another
option besides committing him or sending him home, Assemblywoman
Thomson says. It could have asked the county to consider him for six
months of court-ordered mental health visits, and if he didn't show
up, he could have been committed.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's more humane than leaving people on the streets,"
Thomson says, or leaving them entirely on their own after they've
tortured a loved one by calling and threatening to kill themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes perfect sense to me," says Smith Levine.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a burning feeling in my stomach, knowing that what
happened to my son is not right. If anyone can benefit from hearing
about it, that's all I want."</TE>

<HD>Simi Police Seek Suspected Child Molester</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Simi Valley police are looking for a suspected child molester who
twice tried to lure youngsters into his vehicle, authorities said
Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The first incident involved a 4-year-old boy whom the man
approached in the bathroom at the Easy Street Ice Rink on Aug. 15.
Police say the man tried to lure the boy to his car by promising him
candy.</LD>
<LD>   The boy's mother overheard, ran into the bathroom and retrieved
her son, police said.</LD>
<TE>   A man with a similar description was spotted two days later in the
1800 block of Church Street, where he attempted to entice a
13-year-old girl into his vehicle, police said. The girl refused to
go with the man, who fled the area.</TE>
<TE>   Police describe the suspect as Latino, between 20 and 28, 5 feet
10 to 6 feet tall, about 170 pounds and with short, spiked black or
brown hair.</TE>
<TE>   He was driving a late-model beige SUV, such as a Chevy Blazer or a
Toyota 4-Runner. Authorities drafted a composite sketch of the man
based on interviews with witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone with information on the vehicle, the suspect or the
incidents is asked to call police at 583-6906.</TE>
<TE>   Calls to this number can be made confidentially.</TE>

<LD>Fullerton police detectives have arrested six suspects in the city's
first homicide this year, which occurred Aug. 28. The arrests of the
suspected gang members were announced Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   A police report identified the victim as Leonardo Rojas, 18, of
Fullerton, who was shot once in the chest, apparently in retaliation
for a previous altercation. Police would not say if Rojas had clashed
with one, some or all of the suspects.</LD>
<LD>   Three of the suspects were identified as Anthony Adame, 20, of
Alta Loma; Marcos Espitia, of Fullerton; and Miguel Frias, 19, of La
Habra. The other three are juveniles.</LD>

<HD>Commemorating the Sept. 11 Attacks</HD>
<DH>Events: From wreath- layings to a cul-de-sac dinner,
communities will honor those who died.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks will be marked by
an array of events across the Southland in what some experts say is a
natural next chapter in dealing with an unprecedented collective
trauma.</LD>
<LD>   Besides nonstop television remembrances, the doors of mosques,
temples and cathedrals will be open for interfaith services through
Wednesday, the anniversary date.</LD>
<LD>   Surfers will paddle from San Onofre State Beach to scatter World
Trade Center debris in the Pacific. At Rancho Fullerton Mobile Home
Estates, residents will hold a "bring-your-own-candle" community
gathering.</LD>
<TE>   Whether people sit in front of the television as the jarring plane
crashes are replayed, or attend an event where a wreath is laid, a
flag lowered, or bells tolled, the glut of electronic and live events
scheduled for Wednesday constitutes a uniquely American
"commemoration ceremony," said Lynn Rapaport, a Pomona College
sociologist who studies collective memory.</TE>
<TE>   "One way that people deal with trauma is to commemorate it," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Rapaport said such rituals are important for cultures to write
their histories.</TE>
<TE>   "We choose what we want to remember as a society--and what we want
to forget," she said, noting that mainstream recognition--and
commemoration--of the Holocaust, for instance, has grown over several
decades.</TE>
<TE>   While American Legion members, Leisure World retirees and others
of that generation have never stopped marking anniversaries connected
with World War II, members of the baby boom and "X" generations now
also understand how it feels to be collectively attacked, and to want
to mourn, Rapaport and other experts said.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, relatives of victims of the attacks will lay a
wreath off Newport Beach from a tall ship at 8:46 a.m., the moment on
the East Coast that the first attack occurred.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone feels the same emotional pull. Some say they already
feel overwhelmed by the barrage of scripted memory, and say the media
tarnish rather than commemorate the events.</TE>
<TE>   Other more personal events are planned throughout Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Cheridah Heckman, 74, of Fountain Valley felt so strongly about
the tragedy that she has invited her block to a sit-down candlelight
dinner in the cul-de-sac outside her home Wednesday evening.</TE>
<TE>   She said she is doing it because she was moved by the anonymous
gesture of a neighbor a year ago, who, on the Friday after Sept. 11,
"left a whole bunch of big, beautiful white candles on the doorstep
of every house in our tract and the next" along with a note asking
everyone to come out of their homes that evening and light them in a
moment of silence.</TE>
<TE>   One thing Heckman does not want to see is a national holiday on
Sept. 11. As someone who vividly remembers the 1941 attack on Pearl
Harbor, she said that the Veterans and Memorial holidays don't
commemorate much of anything, except perhaps American capitalism.
"It's just another shopping day," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Last year's spontaneous gestures in response to the attacks have
largely been replaced by scheduled events.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County Fire Authority has been so overwhelmed with
requests for firefighters to attend events from Aliso Viejo to Yorba
Linda that it has had to turn down some to ensure that enough staff
is on hand to respond to an emergency.</TE>
<TE>   "I personally feel that everybody has been affected to one degree
or another by the tragic events a year ago," said Fire Authority
Capt. Stephen Miller. "People feel the need to connect or show their
respect, or somehow show their feelings. [And] they want to show they
care about what happened to firefighters, police officers and
others."</TE>

<LD>Out of the horror would come the hope, the restoration. In the
aftermath of Sept. 11, 2001, an America that had moved away from
organized religion would find its way back as one nation, stunned and
indivisible, under God.</LD>
<LD>   That, at least, was what many of America's clergy thought would
happen. They weren't whistling in the dark: In the days after the
terrorist attacks on America, people of all faiths--and no
faiths--seemed to edge back toward the country's spiritual roots. The
mainstream media, of all things, were broadcasting locations of
church services.</LD>
<LD>   But today, the Sunday before the anniversary of the 11th, Pastor
Doug Webster is lamenting the American epiphany that didn't last.</LD>
<TE>   "It was not a long-lasting commitment and connection to the
church," he says. Webster heads the 400-member Mountain View Church
that meets at Capo Valley High School in Mission Viejo, but his
assessment reflects that of the Barna Research Group, a respected
market research company that tracks trends in Christianity.</TE>
<TE>   Barna has found that nine of 10 Americans say the Sept. 11 attacks
had "no lasting impact on their faith" and that people's religious
beliefs "have gone unchanged" in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   What hurts Webster, whose church began 5 1/2 years ago with 20
people, is that he so vividly remembers how vital religion seemed to
people last Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Adults and youngsters alike told him then they needed assurance
and guidance. "People said, 'Tell me this God you've been talking
about on the Sundays I've been in church is still a big enough God to
be in charge,' " Webster says. In the next breath, he says, they told
him they wanted more than canned theological answers--they wanted him
to sit with them "as an authentic presence of someone who still has
faith."</TE>
<TE>   Heady stuff for ministers. "It's why we ministry people suit up
and show up," Webster says of being able to help people in a crisis.
"There was a great hunger for hope."</TE>
<TE>   On the 16th, the first Sunday after the terrorist attacks, the
church was packed. "It was one of the most powerful worship
experiences I've ever had in my life, as a pastor and as a believer,"
Webster says.</TE>
<TE>   Through that day of songs, prayers and sermons--with many in the
congregation openly weeping--Webster welcomed regulars, semi-regulars
and "prodigals" who hadn't been in church for a long time. "I walked
away that day thinking 'I can't imagine that we won't have a thousand
people next week because of the powerful human experience we had
together.' "</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't to be.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Webster thinks the church may have lost as many fringe
attenders--their perhaps already-shaky faith crushed by Sept. 11
events--as it gained new ones.</TE>
<TE>   But as Webster, 42, sits in his Las Flores home and discusses the
last year, it isn't with recrimination at those who came but didn't
stay.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm well aware of human nature," he says, philosophically.
"That's my business, in a way. But it really saddens me not to see a
more spiritual response ... of more people. I'm not saying there
hasn't been some, but we went back to business as usual more quickly
than I thought we would."</TE>
<TE>   Webster is an evangelizer, so he needs no lectures about how the
secular society also has a hold on people. Or that, as the images of
tragedies 3,000 miles away began to recede, relatively well-off
Southern Californians may not have wanted spiritual sustenance as
badly as they first thought.</TE>
<TE>   Which, to an evangelist, only means there's more work to do.</TE>
<TE>   "With the hurt [that the spiritual surge didn't last], there is
great hope," Webster says. "With the disappointment that more didn't
stay longer and that every one of our churches didn't double in size
is the hope that there have been some changed lives."</TE>

<HD>Neighbor Sought in Shooting of Fillmore Man</HD>
<DH>Crime: Deputies say the gunman, who escaped after running
into a house, may be a teen with gang ties. The victim is listed as
stable.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A 22-year-old Fillmore man was in stable condition Saturday after
being shot Friday night, allegedly by a neighborhood teen who
authorities said has gang connections.</LD>
<LD>   It's the first shooting in Fillmore in more than two years,
Ventura County Sheriff's Department officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Ariel Hernandez Acosta was shot with a small-caliber pistol about
9 p.m. Friday, authorities said. He was being treated at Santa Paula
Memorial Hospital and was expected to fully recover.</LD>
<TE>   The suspect, described only as a teenage boy who has had previous
run-ins with the law, remained at large Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   According to Sheriff's Department spokesman Eric Nishimoto,
several residents on Palm Street called authorities Friday night to
report hearing gunfire. When deputies arrived, they found Acosta
lying on the ground near his home, and were told by witnesses that
the suspect had run into another home on Palm Street.</TE>
<TE>   Believing the suspect had barricaded himself with a gun inside the
home, deputies surrounded the residence and began trying to contact
the boy by telephone. No one answered the calls, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   About 2:45 a.m. Saturday, sheriff's SWAT unit members, along with
a canine team, stormed the house but found it empty. Authorities
believe the shooter ran out a back door and fled immediately after
the shooting. The motive remained under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The last shooting in the city was in May 2000, when a sheriff's
deputy shot a man outside a wedding reception at the Fillmore-Piru
Veterans Memorial Building at 2nd Street and Central Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   Deputies arrived at the event to handle a heated argument between
Chad Morales, who was armed with a gun, and his father, Anthony
Morales, a former Fillmore police officer. Deputies ordered the
younger Morales to drop his weapon, and when he refused, Deputy Tonya
Herbst fired at him. Her shot, though, struck the older Morales in
the back.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony Morales was treated at a hospital and later released, and
his son was arrested. He later pleaded guilty to a felony charge of
drawing a firearm in the presence of a deputy and spent 120 days in
jail.</TE>
<TE>   The shooting was deemed justified and Herbst remains on the job.</TE>

<HD>Slave's Sons Seek to Heal Wounds With Reparations</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC BAILEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The physical wounds healed long ago. More than 140 years have passed
since Andrew Jackson Hurdle first felt the slave master's lash.</LD>
<LD>   Hurdle died in 1935 at age 89, the father of 25 children. Now his
last surviving sons say it is time to heal the soul of slavery's
offspring.</LD>
<LD>   The two elderly brothers from California last week joined other
descendants of black slaves to file lawsuits demanding that U.S.
corporations repay profits reaped long ago from the labor of their
ancestors.</LD>
<TE>   Timothy Hurdle is 83, living in San Francisco. His younger brother
Chester, 75, lives in Elk Grove, a Sacramento suburb.</TE>
<TE>   In the name of their father, the men hope to muster an apology and
financial restitution from modern American corporations with
long-forgotten roots in the slave trade.</TE>
<TE>   In the name of the children, they hope to help ensure a better
future for African American youths they believe have inherited the
sociological ills of slavery.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want a penny out of anything," said Chester, a
plain-spoken man who had a long career in the Air Force and as a
manager in the Weinstock's department store chain.</TE>
<TE>   "What I'd like to see is something done to help the future
generations of our race," he added.</TE>
<TE>   So the Hurdle brothers, well into retirement, have become
activists in the reparations movement, which has picked up momentum
in recent years. It has also collected a growing line of critics, who
call it unfair for the offspring of slaves to ask for repayment from
the corporate descendants of companies that profited from slavery.</TE>
<TE>   The thrust of the litigation is that the companies are guilty of
conspiracy, human rights violations and unjust enrichment from
slavery. The lawsuits demand access to corporate records to determine
how much money was made from slavery.</TE>
<TE>   Among those being sued are railroads and tobacco firms, textile
makers and insurers. No damage figure is named, but by some
estimates, the unpaid wages of slavery plus interest would amount to
$1.4 trillion today.</TE>
<TE>   Though their lawsuit may be a longshot, the Hurdles hope to reap
enough compensation from corporate America to endow a massive trust
fund to help poor young African Americans with education, housing and
other needs.</TE>
<TE>   As they and other reparation advocates see it, many of the ills
suffered by black Americans for the last century--poverty, family
disintegration, a burgeoning incarceration rate--are rooted in nearly
250 years of bondage on American soil.</TE>
<TE>   "For more than two centuries, our ancestors were abused
psychologically, physically, sexually, economically," said Barbara
Ratliff, the brothers' Los Angeles-based attorney. "When people say
'Get over it,' they ignore that for many it is not something you can
just get over. Some of the conduct is transferred generation to
generation."</TE>
<TE>   'Learned Helplessness'</TE>
<TE>   Ratliff calls this "learned helplessness," and says it still
shadows the lives of many African American families. "A lot of black
people have been destroyed in the soul and psyche," she said. "There
needs to be a rebuilding of that." Timothy and Chester Hurdle are
exceptions, Ratliff said, despite their standing as the direct
offspring of a slave, a rarity in 21st century America.</TE>
<TE>   Like all the children of Andrew Hurdle, they have forged good
careers, volunteered for worthy causes and raised families.</TE>
<TE>   With no uncertain pride, the two brothers trace their success to
the quality of character demonstrated by their father.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Hurdle was born into slavery in 1845. His first 10 years
were spent on a North Carolina plantation. He was auctioned off with
several brothers and sisters to a farm in Texas. Designated a house
servant, he avoided the worst of the abuse.</TE>
<TE>   But when he was 16, with the Civil War erupting, a new plantation
manager arrived, and Andrew got his first whipping, his sons say. He
became a runaway, joining a Union regiment. For the remainder of the
war, Hurdle tended their horses.</TE>
<TE>   At 20 he returned to Texas and married his childhood sweetheart.
They had 17 children, but she later died. Then, in 1917, he married a
young woman four decades his junior. They produced eight more
children, including Timothy, Chester and their sole surviving
sibling, Hannah Hurdle-Toomey, a minister in Illinois.</TE>
<TE>   Their father wore many hats: as a minister, farmer and manager of
a sorghum syrup mill. He opened one of Texas' first black schools of
higher education: Northeast Texas Christian Theological and
Industrial College.</TE>
<TE>   Timothy Hurdle, who for years worked with poor black teenagers as
a Boy Scout volunteer, says he hopes a victory in the reparations
battle can help bring alive his father's dream of better educating
African American youths.</TE>
<TE>   "I can see where a lot of children could be helped," he said. "We
sure hope something will come of all this."</TE>
<TE>   But the odds may be against them, judging from the reparation
movement's track record.</TE>
<TE>   Since the post-Civil War promise by federal lawmakers of "40 acres
and a mule"--a vow left largely unfulfilled--African Americans have
been pushing for compensation.</TE>
<TE>   A true grass-roots campaign began in the 1890s, with a push for
pensions for former slaves.</TE>
<TE>   It lingered in obscurity for decades, until the federal
government's payment of reparations to World War II Japanese American
internees in 1988 provoked renewed interest.</TE>
<TE>   But it has so far been a movement mostly of moral victories.</TE>
<TE>   Lawsuits Went Nowhere</TE>
<TE>   Each year since 1989, Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) has pushed a
bill proposing a national commission to study slave reparations, but
it has never gotten out of committee.</TE>
<TE>   Lawsuits filed over the last decade have gone essentially nowhere.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, the legal attacks have become more focused, won
new allies in government and gained steam with the awarding of
compensation to Holocaust survivors.</TE>
<TE>   In California, the Legislature two years ago agreed to assemble a
University of California colloquium to study the economic fallout of
slavery and ordered insurance firms to make public 19th century
"slave insurance" policies.</TE>
<TE>   Though reparation advocates have long tried to win federal
payments, the new focus on slavery's corporate descendants came
largely because of the work of activist Deadria Farmer-Paellman.</TE>
<TE>   She used computer databases and government records to locate 60
firms in the slave trade that survive. Two years ago, Farmer-Paellman
elicited an apology from Aetna Corp. for old slave policies, but she
failed to win restitution. So earlier this year, she filed a
class-action lawsuit against Aetna and two other firms.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, two more federal suits were filed: the Hurdle brothers'
action in San Francisco and a lawsuit in New York by Edlee Bankhead,
who at 119 is considered the oldest man in the United States. Similar
actions are expected soon in Illinois, Texas and Louisiana.</TE>
<TE>   Major Firms Targeted</TE>
<TE>   A dozen corporations are being targeted: investment banks J.P.
Morgan Chase &amp; Co., Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and Brown Bros.
Harriman; insurers American International Group Inc. and Lloyd's of
London; tobacco and insurance conglomerate Loews Corp.; railroads
Union Pacific Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp.; textile firm
WestPoint Stevens Inc.; and tobacco makers R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
Holdings Inc., Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp. and Liggett Group
Inc., now indirectly owned by Vector Group Ltd.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say this tactic threatens to unfairly punish investors and
institutions for the misdeeds of long-dead predecessors. Peter
Flaherty, president of the Washington-based nonpartisan National
Legal and Policy Center, called the reparation movement's focus on
capitalist institutions "the new form of corporate shakedown."</TE>
<TE>   Chester Hurdle sees something simpler: rectifying a wrong, no
matter how late.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like an inequity was done," he said. "I'd like to see our
grandkids, our great-grandkids, do better.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to see them educated so they're prepared to make a
decent living in this country."</TE>

<HD>Remembering the First Attack</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It may seem, at first, a curious way to fight terrorism, to soften a
blow so terrible that Edward Smith sometimes still feels its ache as
if it landed yesterday.</LD>
<LD>   One day before the one-year anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks, the 40-year-old CEO will lead golfers through 18 holes at a
Simi Valley course, raising money for victims and their families with
every drive, pitch and putt.</LD>
<LD>   It is his way of doing his part, of remembering those still
reeling from last year's attack on the World Trade Center.</LD>
<TE>   But it's also a way of remembering another terrorist attack. One
that struck the same building nearly a decade ago. One that claimed
the life of his wife, then 7 months' pregnant with their first child,
a boy they had decided to name Eddie.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people reached out and helped me and now I'm in a
position to be able to help others," said Smith, a Porter Ranch
resident and president and chief executive officer of SMTEK
International, an electronics manufacturer in Moorpark.</TE>
<TE>   Smith and a handful of others staged the first United We Stand
tournament three weeks after the 2001 attacks. It raised more than
$80,000 in relief aid and mirrored a tournament hosted annually in
New York by family members of those killed in the 1993 World Trade
Center bombing.</TE>
<TE>   "I think a lot of people after 9/11 wanted to know what they could
do to help," said Smith, his New York accent still strong. "We're all
looking for ways to make a difference, to show there's another side
to this and to say we are not going to be beaten down."</TE>
<TE>   Smith wasn't looking to lead the charge against terrorism. Despite
his years as a traveling salesman, he is naturally reserved and more
likely to bolt from the public spotlight than bask in it.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, he remained publicly silent for more than a year after
his wife and five others were killed in the first World Trade Center
attack, speaking openly for the first time in 1994 when four of the
men who carried out the bombing were set to be sentenced to life in
prison.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody could have ever prepared me for the feelings I was
experiencing: I had lost my wife, my best friend, my idol, and my
son," Smith told the judge in front of a packed courtroom that day.</TE>
<TE>   "We would never get to hear Eddie say his first word, to say
'mommy,' 'daddy,' 'love.' We would never get the opportunity to see
Eddie walk or go to school," he said. "We lost all this because the
four men you are to sentence today wanted to terrorize the people of
the United States."</TE>
<TE>   The phone woke Ed Smith early the morning of Sept. 11. He was
living in Simi Valley but was away on business at the time, staying
at a Phoenix hotel. A co-worker called and told him to turn on the
TV.</TE>
<TE>   The television glowed to life in time for Smith to watch the south
tower get hit. He thought immediately of the warnings issued by some
of the bombers convicted of the 1993 explosion.</TE>
<TE>   "They said if they had had more money, more resources, they would
have taken the buildings down back then," Smith said. "I saw one
event as a continuation of the other."</TE>
<TE>   Six people were killed and 1,000 injured in the 1993 bombing--only
a fraction of the thousands killed and injured when terrorists few
two jetliners into the Twin Towers on Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   But Smith said whether it is one fatality or 1,000, the scale of
carnage means little to family members left behind and reeling from
loss. Smith lost the love of his life, a dark-haired Ecuadorean woman
he met in 1982 while making sales calls to the B-2 level of the World
Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   Monica Rodriguez was a secretary for the New York Port Authority.
They were engaged three months after they began seriously dating in
1989, and were married Aug. 31 of the following year.</TE>
<TE>   They bought the Long Island house Ed grew up in and refurbished it
from the ground up. By mid-February, they were shopping for furniture
for the baby's room.</TE>
<TE>   Days later, a bomb blast would tear apart what then seemed like a
perfect dream, a glorious time that Smith spent singing and reading
"Winnie the Pooh" books to his baby, or sometimes just listening to
his heartbeat inside his mother's womb.</TE>
<TE>   He tried to capture it all in his courtroom statement the day the
bombers were sentenced.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried to make it focused on the people, not the cause," he said
of his statement. "It was never really about a cause anyway. What God
would want civilians killed in his name?"</TE>
<TE>   Although he left New York for good the day after the bombers were
sentenced, Smith continued to play in the golf tournament established
in memory of the victims of the 1993 attack.</TE>
<TE>   The tournament raises money for scholarships, including one in the
name of Monica Smith at the Long Island campus where Ed Smith
attended high school.</TE>
<TE>   So it was a natural for Smith, after so many people he knew said
they wanted to do something for the victims of Sept. 11, to propose a
similar tournament on the West Coast. Friend and former neighbor Andy
Clark helped lay the groundwork. And the management at Wood Ranch
Golf Club, where Smith was a member, donated use of its course.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a really great cause," general manager Mark Kelley said. "So
many people were really touched by the events of last September, it
was really a no-brainer."</TE>
<TE>   The plan calls for staging the tournament every year on the
Tuesday closest to Sept. 11. Smith, Clark and others are so committed
to the idea that they have formed the We Will Never Forget
Foundation, a nonprofit group that will collect and distribute
proceeds from the event.</TE>
<TE>   Smith said he hopes Tuesday's event draws 150 golfers and raises
$40,000. Registration is still open, and golfers can call 532-2800
Ext. 103, for more information. Or they can just show up at the golf
course, starting at about noon.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about coming together and overcoming what they've thrown at
us," he said. "It's about making something good out of something
bad."</TE>

<HD>A Sycamore Deeply Rooted in City's Past</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A sacred sycamore that served as Los Angeles' Plymouth Rock once
fixed in time and place a now-vanished village of the Tongva Indians,
whose settlement thrived here for three millenniums.</LD>
<LD>   As Christopher Columbus was wading ashore in the West Indies in
the fall of 1492, a seedling began to grow not far from the Pacific
shoreline where Spanish explorer Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo would make
landfall half a century later.</LD>
<LD>   In its 400 years, the tree would serve as shelter and symbol for
the highest councils of a Native American nation, then as a landmark
to Spanish soldiers and ground zero for the fledgling city of El
Pueblo de Nuestra Senora la Reina de Los Angeles de Porciuncula.</LD>
<TE>   Before 1781, when a small band of settlers christened the huge
tree simply "El Aliso," which means "the sycamore," more than 200
Tongva Indians lived in Yangna, the largest of the 100 or so villages
in the region that were home to 5,000 indigenous Californians. Chiefs
from the lesser villages would travel to confer under the vast
branches of the "council tree."</TE>
<TE>   For a century, the precise location of Yangna perplexed historians
and anthropologists. They placed it variously at City Hall, Union
Station, Pershing Square and the corner of Temple and Main streets.
Eventually, its exact location was found to have been what is now a
center divider on the Hollywood Freeway, just south of Patsaouras
Transit Plaza, the headquarters of the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority.</TE>
<TE>   Its location was discerned a few years ago by John Crandell, a
Westwood Village landscape architect. He found a revealing entry in
the Mexican-era City Council records dated March 12, 1845, that
clarified the village site.</TE>
<TE>   There is nothing left of Yangna, which Spanish explorer Gaspar de
Portola chanced upon in 1769 on his way to close escrow on Alta
California. The Mexican rulers who followed the Spaniards did to the
Gabrielinos--the name the newcomers gave the Tongva--pretty much what
the U.S. government would soon do to other tribes: took their lands
and consigned them to ever-smaller parcels.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, locals chipped away at Indian property. In 1834,
French immigrant and vineyard owner Jean-Louis Vignes simply took
over the land on which the 60-foot sycamore stood. For tax purposes,
he valued the tree at $20.</TE>
<TE>   In 1836, the City Council, or ayuntamiento, gave half the
remaining area to a neighboring property owner, reducing Yangna to a
small triangle less than 100 yards long on each side. Even that small
portion lasted barely a decade. In 1846, the city moved it
altogether, resettling the tribe and relocating the village on the
east side of the Los Angeles River where Cesar E. Chavez Avenue and
Mission Road now meet.</TE>
<TE>   A few years later, after 26 residents complained of noise from
"disorderly gatherings" when American soldiers visited the relocated
village for unauthorized R&amp;R, the military commander ordered the city
to eliminate it "or else." Townsfolk contributed all of
$24--coincidentally, the value of the beads that effected the
transfer of the island of Manhattan--to help the surviving Indians
move their belongings to wherever they could find refuge. By then
their numbers had been ravaged by decades of disease, violence,
liquor and opium. But the tree remained, the spread of its branches
then measuring 200 feet in diameter. Twice, in 1815 and 1825, it
survived roaring floods that changed the course of the river. The
tree survived the drought of the 1860s that killed cattle and
bankrupted ranchers.</TE>
<TE>   But by the 1870s, the Philadelphia Brew House--later the site of
Maier and Zobelein, Maier Brewing Co. and Brew 102--surrounded El
Aliso. By 1892, the ancient tree of Yangna was dead.</TE>
<TE>   Little Charles Gibbs Adams, who was about 8, watched as the tree
was cut down and hauled off for firewood. He counted its growth rings
and recorded its life span as 400 years. Adams would grow up to
become one of Los Angeles' first landscape architects.</TE>
<TE>   In 1972, the suds of Brew 102 stopped flowing when the old brewery
closed. The shutdown ended almost a century of the pungent aroma of
malted barley, hops and freshly brewed beer in the shadow of the
Civic Center.</TE>
<TE>   Today the 26-story MTA headquarters and the glass-domed Gateway
Intermodal Transit Center stand little more than a football field's
length from the spot where the six-story sycamore grew.</TE>
<TE>   Its skyscraper height contrasting with the lower Union Station,
the transit headquarters may become the city's 21st century
transportation hub even as it revives a long-neglected neighborhood.</TE>

<HD>Accused D.A. Wants a Look at State's Case</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a rare legal showdown between two law enforcement agencies, Orange
County's district attorney is seeking access to investigative files
compiled against him by the state attorney general.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors are usually united in protecting the names of
witnesses and informants as well as evidence gathered by
investigators. But county lawyers representing Dist. Atty. Tony
Rackauckas' office want the attorney general to turn over evidence
provided by a top deputy and two other employees who went to state
prosecutors with allegations of wrongdoing involving the district
attorney.</LD>
<LD>   The county says it needs the information to defend itself against
a wrongful-termination suit filed by one of the employees, contending
that the employee was dismissed because he gave false and misleading
information to the attorney general's office.</LD>
<TE>   Lawyers for the county are pursuing the information even though
they went to court in another case two years ago to argue in favor of
guarding the same kinds of records.</TE>
<TE>   Legal experts said the outcome of the case could have larger
ramifications.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, if [the district attorney] can pierce confidentiality,
why shouldn't anyone be able to pierce confidentiality?" said Stephen
Kohn, a Washington attorney and leading authority on whistle-blower
cases. "There's no special exemption that gives the D.A. extra rights
as a defendant. If the court orders it, it's a public opinion and can
be relied upon by others."</TE>
<TE>   One Rackauckas critic said releasing the attorney general's
documents would make whistle-blowers afraid to come forward and goes
against the district attorney's historic position.</TE>
<TE>   "I can tell you from experience, the district attorney's office in
Orange County has traditionally gone to war to prevent this type of
thing from compromising their investigations," said Chris Evans, a
former Orange County prosecutor.</TE>
<TE>   A federal judge in Santa Ana has been hearing arguments in the
case for two weeks and is expected to issue his ruling soon.</TE>
<TE>   The debate is central to a wrongful-termination lawsuit filed
against Rackauckas by former prosecutor Mike Jacobs. Jacobs, a
25-year homicide veteran who was once a loyal supporter and top
deputy to Rackauckas, was dismissed last year, two months after he
and two peers provided letters and documents that accused Rackauckas
of giving favorable treatment to campaign contributors, among other
misdeeds.</TE>
<TE>   Those records were eventually used to start a grand jury
investigation of Rackauckas. The attorney general assisted the grand
jury in its probe.</TE>
<TE>   The grand jury report, released in June, found that Rackauckas
interfered in cases involving political backers, punished foes within
the office and hired family members of campaign contributors.
Rackauckas denies any wrongdoing, saying the report was unduly
influenced by political enemies.</TE>
<TE>   In his lawsuit, Jacobs contends his free-speech rights were
violated and he was being punished for accusing his boss of
corruption. Rackauckas disagrees, maintaining that Jacobs was let go
for other reasons, including making improper and false statements to
the attorney general and the news media.</TE>
<TE>   In a federal hearing last week, Norman J. Watkins, a private
lawyer leading the district attorney's defense team, argued
repeatedly that his client needs the statements and other evidence
provided by Jacobs and his colleagues to try to prove that Jacobs
went to the attorney general "half-cocked," with second-and
third-hand stories that were untrue.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the primary questions is, did Mr. Jacobs go to the
attorney general with accurate, complete information?" Watkins said.</TE>
<TE>   Kristen G. Hogue, a supervising deputy attorney general, argued
against the material's release, saying her office was protecting
confidentiality rules relied upon by prosecutors everywhere,
including the Orange County district attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the attorney general cited a court case waged by county
attorneys on behalf of the Orange County Sheriff's Department to
support its argument. In that case, a south Orange County couple
accused but never charged with killing their child sued the county
two years ago, and initially won access to investigative files. But
the county appealed the decision and won, with a higher court
agreeing that the file should be kept confidential until other leads
were exhausted.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney general's office refused to comment on whether it is
continuing to look into the allegations at the district attorney's
office.</TE>
<TE>   Hogue argued in federal court that, either way, there are broader
consequences to consider if access is allowed because future
witnesses and informants might be unwilling and afraid to come
forward if they knew they might be eventually exposed.</TE>
<TE>   "Any whistle-blower would be chilled from saying anything," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts agree with Hogue that the attorney general's files
are not relevant to the case. But Stanford law professor Mark Kelman
said the county might have grounds for access if it argues that
Jacobs lied in his dealings with the attorney general.</TE>
<TE>   "If they're saying, in part, that he made things up that got them
in trouble, then I suppose that questions about what he gave them
become more germane," Kelman said.</TE>

<DH>A Heartfelt Essay Brings a Second Chance to a College
Grad-Turned-Artful Panhandler Known as the ...</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN M. GLIONNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Rail-thin, with soulful gray eyes and wielding a wooden cane, Josh
Brandon was a panhandler in a city where the artful street grift is
performed by hundreds of homeless residents.</LD>
<LD>   But the 53-year-old was unlike most: an educated man without drug
or psychiatric problems who stumbled into a life of poverty when he
lost a job in 1999.</LD>
<LD>   Also unlike most, he has set his life right again, employing
skills he learned as a college history major and as a working
professional.</LD>
<TE>   For nearly three years, Brandon worked the streets. Like a fly
fisherman casting into a pool of passing trout, he knew how to reel
in money from the wallets of strangers. He went at his task with the
focus he would a 9-to-5 job.</TE>
<TE>   He had a cardinal rule--he never asked for money. Instead, he
merely greeted passersby to establish a contact he hoped would carry
over to the next meeting. It was all part of his daily need, he later
wrote, to "psychologically convince myself that I am not begging."</TE>
<TE>   After years of living beneath a bridge and suffering declining
health and the daily pain of a bum hip, Brandon resolved last spring
to write his way off the streets.</TE>
<TE>   In an essay published in Street Sheet, the city's handout paper
for the homeless, he chronicled his panhandling pursuits, standing
with his donation cup at a favorite spot near Pac Bell Park.</TE>
<TE>   "I know that I am not the village drunk or the village idiot, but
when I am working, I do become the village greeter," Brandon
explained. "I never ask the people who pass by for anything, but
simply say, 'Good morning, sir (or ma'am), and smile. I never sit
down, so I can look them directly in the eye with as much pride and
confidence as I can pull up from deep inside."</TE>
<TE>   One San Francisco lawyer saw the story--"The Life and Times of a
Beggarman Troll"--and took Brandon at his word. In May, his firm
offered him a job using his communication skills.</TE>
<TE>   Now Brandon helps draft letters to insurance companies, seeking
settlements on injury cases. His new employers reason that if he can
humanize homeless people, he can inspire cynical insurance adjustors.</TE>
<TE>   "We looked beyond Josh's status to hire the beggarman troll," said
lawyer Chris Dolan. "What we got in turn was a capable man who knows
the value of a paycheck, who has taken advantage of a chance to
change his life."</TE>
<TE>   Experts say three of four homeless people suffer from drug,
alcohol or mental illness problems. But 20% of the 800,000 homeless
nationwide have jobs and work at least 20 hours a week, they add.</TE>
<TE>   In San Francisco, a city searching its conscience for solutions to
the problem of a growing indigent population, many say Brandon's
success offers hope for other homeless people.</TE>
<TE>   "Josh is an example of street people with brains, skills and
passion," said Paul Boden, director of San Francisco's Coalition on
Homelessness. "There are more people out there like him than you'd
think."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Gavin Newsom is sponsoring an initiative on the
November ballot to cut general assistance payments to the homeless by
four-fifths. His "Care, Not Cash" measure would trim one of the
nation's most generous stipends from $320 a month to $59, replacing
the cash with the promise of equivalent spending on housing and
services.</TE>
<TE>   While polls show that a majority of residents favor the plan,
Newsom has been criticized by people such as attorney Dolan. "Why
doesn't the city work harder to hire some of these most competent
homeless people?" Dolan said. "Maybe it should be 'Jobs, Not Cash.'
''</TE>
<TE>   Newsome agrees: "Job programs are a weakness in our homeless
services."</TE>
<TE>   As a panhandler, Brandon befriended people who passed him by
countless times before dropping coins into his cup and, finally,
responding to his daily greetings to strike up a conversation.</TE>
<TE>   People such as banker Bob Sipp.</TE>
<TE>   "I must have walked by him a dozen times and he always said hello.
He had this coffee cup, but he never asked for money," Sipp recalled.
"One day, I looked into the cup and noticed there wasn't any coffee.
And it didn't look like there had ever been any coffee."</TE>
<TE>   Sipp said, "You need help?"</TE>
<TE>   Brandon smiled.</TE>
<TE>   The Beggarman Troll had made another friend.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Chehalis, Wash., Brandon graduated magna cum laude from
the University of Washington with a degree in history in 1972 and
spent two years working on a master's degree. But he never finished.
Instead, he traveled the country for different jobs, including stints
as a corporate trouble-shooter and office manager for a Washington
state senator.</TE>
<TE>   He married and divorced. He came to San Francisco in the late
1980s, and was taken by the number of homeless people in the city's
run-down Tenderloin District. That interest led him to a job as
office manager at the local newspaper, the Tenderloin Times, and he
began writing stories on the plight of the city's street dwellers.</TE>
<TE>   After the Tenderloin Times folded in 1994, Brandon became a city
researcher on the homeless until he was laid off during budget cuts.
"No income usually makes for grumpy landlords, and mine was no
different," he wrote in his troll essay. "My choices now were as slim
as my wallet."</TE>
<TE>   So Brandon scouted out a hidden encampment under the San
Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. "I thought it was like urban camping,
that I could pitch a tent and the cops wouldn't bother me and nobody
would steal my stuff," he said. "Boy, was I naive."</TE>
<TE>   He continued his search for work. He tried for jobs as a paper
deliverer, as an office worker for a nonprofit, even as a hot dog
salesman at Pac Bell Park. He bought a second-hand suit for his
interviews. But no employer called back.</TE>
<TE>   Brandon guessed his bridge residency would last a month. It
dragged on for three years.</TE>
<TE>   When his job leads dried up, friends taught him another way to
make money. Soon, he mastered the art of the graceful panhandle. But
the life of the change hustle was demanding.</TE>
<TE>   "My hip has hurt so much from standing that I could barely walk
back to my camp," he wrote, "and sometimes I had to crawl to make it
up under the bridge."</TE>
<TE>   One day, Brandon made contact with an old friend, Chance Martin,
who edited the local edition of Street Sheet. For $25 a story, he
began writing about homeless people. Then Brandon wrote his troll
essay--composed by candlelight under the bridge. The piece was
reprinted in Street Sheets nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Philip Gagnon was so impressed that he began searching
for Brandon, reaching him at the Street Sheet offices. Gagnon's boss,
Chris Dolan, gave Brandon a job. He also gave Brandon $150 to get a
room, buy some clothes and report to work the next day.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, Brandon passed his old panhandling haunt to find a new
practitioner in his place. He also ran into Bob Sipp.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll do lunch," Brandon whispered, embracing his banker friend.
"This time, I'm buying."</TE>

<HD>South Gate: Where City Hall's a Mix of Soap Opera and Bad
Joke</HD>
<DH>Government: Officials are looking into suspected
corruption. Council-watchers enjoy 'the meow lady.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD MAROSI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Latinos took control of South Gate City Hall in 1994, Latinos
inside and outside the city celebrated it as a sign that local
governments were starting to mirror their communities.</LD>
<LD>   But ethnic pride has turned to disappointment. For many,
experiencing South Gate these days is like entering a dark side of
Latino politics.</LD>
<LD>   In the past two years, members of the City Council have tripled
their salaries, awarded contracts to a long list of cronies and
authorized new staff members with resumes that read like rap sheets.</LD>
<TE>   The city's trial specialist, Cristeta Paguirigan, is a disbarred
attorney caught embezzling thousands from clients. Raul Pardo,
convicted in 1995 for punching out a newspaper photographer, heads
the new community outreach department.</TE>
<TE>   Treasurer Albert Robles is awaiting trial for allegedly making
death threats against two state legislators. Acting Police Chief Rick
Lopez's first hire was a cop once fired for tipping off suspects of a
federal drug investigation.</TE>
<TE>   South Gate's plight is more than a story about civic leaders
eroding the public trust. The city in southeast Los Angeles County is
one of the state's largest Latino-controlled communities and has
become a bellwether of local Latino politics.</TE>
<TE>   Concerned Latino leaders inside and outside the city responded by
backing unusual reform legislation and supporting an extraordinary
anti-corruption effort by local and federal authorities.</TE>
<TE>   More than 150 district attorney's investigators raided leaders'
homes and offices in May. The FBI has subpoenaed City Hall. And
Secretary of State Bill Jones says that, compared with South Gate,
elections are more lawful in Nicaragua.</TE>
<TE>   But though the scrutiny might prompt other cities to clean
house--or at least put an official on leave--in South Gate, leaders
continue fast-tracking controversial measures and sweetening the
contracts of those under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Robles, for example, was promoted to the $111,000-per-year post of
deputy city manager after his arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Although numerous cities have transitioned to all-Latino city
councils in recent years, "South Gate has become symbolic in terms of
what Latino power can be, unfortunately," said Fernando Guerra,
director of Loyola Marymount University's Center for the Study of Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   But Guerra and others say the city distorts the picture statewide.
"In reality," he said, "19 other cities [in Los Angeles County] have
Latino majorities, and they have become stable.... South Gate is not
representative of Latino politics."</TE>
<TE>   So how did South Gate degenerate to this point? Some call it the
growing pains of a city in transition. To others, it's a modern twist
on Tammany Hall-style politics.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the case, South Gate's civic divide is as wide and
impenetrable as the truck-clogged Long Beach Freeway that slices
through this working-class city.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a dictatorship here," said Alan Treen, a 40-year
resident. "If the state of California, or some responsible agency,
would take over, it would be a huge improvement.... It would be a
pretty radical move, but clearly due process has been suspended
here."</TE>
<TE>   To city leaders, however, the forces scrutinizing their actions
represent an egregious case of outsider interference.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a political persecution that brings to mind the Gestapo,"
said Mayor Xochilt Ruvalcaba of the raid in May.</TE>
<TE>   South Gate, a onetime union town turned immigrant gateway, is in
many ways a model community, a Latino version of idealized suburbia,
with mid-century houses lovingly tended by families who have lived
there for generations.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike neighboring Watts and Lynwood, crime has never swamped this
city of 96,000 residents. The parks and streets are clean.</TE>
<TE>   But the political landscape is messier.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the Twilight Zone of politics," says Joe Ruiz, a
businessman and activist whose fleet of plumbing vans was firebombed
last year in what authorities suspect was a political attack.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't believe what goes on here--you have to tell them
step by step, and they're still like, 'No, no, it couldn't be.' "</TE>
<TE>   It is.</TE>
<TE>   The city launched into another political dimension in December
2000, when voters elected a shy hairdresser named Maria Benavides to
the council.</TE>
<TE>   Benavides' oath at the swearing-in ceremony was the last time she
addressed the public. But her votes--cast in a quiet, cat-like voice
that earned her the nickname "the meow lady"--shook the city.</TE>
<TE>   Along with Ruvalcaba and Vice Mayor Raul Moriel, she formed a bloc
aligned with Robles, the city's elected treasurer and perceived
political boss.</TE>
<TE>   Ruvalcaba, Benavides, who is her cousin, and Moriel voted to boost
their salaries and stripped the elected clerk of most of her duties.
They also awarded contracts to former Robles associates.</TE>
<TE>   Those and other moves have met with strong opposition from Latino
councilmen Hector De La Torre and Henry Gonzalez. Both have helped
lead a groundswell of opposition forces that include recent Latino
immigrants, off-duty cops and white senior citizens.</TE>
<TE>   Their complaints of corruption were heard far outside the city.
The district attorney's office pounced first, gaining convictions in
the past year against three Robles political allies on electoral
fraud charges. The office continues to investigate the alleged misuse
of public funds.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in April, Robles was arrested outside his townhouse and
charged with threatening to kill two state lawmakers and a South Gate
police lieutenant.</TE>
<TE>   Overnight, Robles' photographed image--head bowed, hands
cuffed--appeared on fliers and T-shirts across town. "One down, three
to go," read one, referring to Robles' council allies, called "los
tres stooges" by critics.</TE>
<TE>   But one month later, Robles , already city treasurer, was named
deputy city manager. Now, even if convicted, he stands to collect
$180,000 in severance pay.</TE>
<TE>   Robles, an intelligent and volatile politician, says he is a
modernizer who supports long-needed changes to the city's
infrastructure.</TE>
<TE>   But critics suspect Robles is intent on enriching himself at
public expense and destroying the city's two police unions. Robles
denies the accusations.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever his motives, Robles' tenure has been tumultuous. A brief
sampling:</TE>
<TE>   * In May, a waste hauling firm executive said Robles demanded that
his firm contribute $20,000 for a political campaign. After the
official refused, Robles allegedly said, "You're out of town."</TE>
<TE>   The firm subsequently lost its contract renewal. Robles denies the
accusation.</TE>
<TE>   * Paguirigan, the city's trial specialist, is a convicted forger
as well as embezzler. When leaders learned of her background,
Ruvalcaba called the forgery an "innocent mistake," and she and her
allies voted to give Paguirigan's firm more work.</TE>
<TE>   * In February, the council majority awarded a former Robles
business associate a lease on a 15-acre parcel of city-owned land for
far below market value. The deal allows the businessman to lease the
land to others for as long as 55 years.</TE>
<TE>   South Gate is now a city paralyzed by civic mistrust. Public
meetings have become boisterous bouts of civil disobedience, creating
a pattern of one-upmanship that has bordered on the bizarre.</TE>
<TE>   When the council majority banned clapping and booing, residents
clapped and booed louder. When residents mocked Benavides' soft voice
by meowing, the council banned that too.</TE>
<TE>   The city has hired an intern to film some heated meetings. But he
doesn't record the council. He trains the camera on the audience.</TE>
<TE>   Residents responded by videotaping the council. Sometimes, half a
dozen people wielding cameras line the aisles.</TE>
<TE>   The seesaw battle reached a strange milestone this spring when
workers installed a thick set of double doors in a City Hall hallway.
Ruvalcaba said the doors were for security, saying she had been
assaulted by two elderly ladies wielding a stack of papers.</TE>
<TE>   For critics, the doors are a metaphor. "They want to isolate
themselves," Gonzalez said. "I don't think they like to face their
accusers. What are they fearful of?"</TE>
<TE>   If anyone has reason to be careful, it is Gonzalez. In 1999, the
councilman was shot in the head outside his home after a bitter
campaign. He suffered minor injuries; the crime is unsolved.</TE>
<TE>   Also unsolved is the firebombing of the plumbing vans of Ruiz, a
supporter of a voter recall drive against Robles and his council
allies. The effort stalled after Ruvalcaba, Moriel and Benavides
replaced the city clerk.</TE>
<TE>   When Jones, citing alleged electoral fraud and voter intimidation,
ordered leaders to cede electoral control to the county, they
refused.</TE>
<TE>   "This type of activity is not something you would expect in Los
Angeles County in the 21st century," Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   The South Gate saga reached the state Capitol this summer when
legislators unanimously approved unusual legislation forcing the city
to hand over control of its special elections. Gov. Gray Davis signed
the bill last month.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation was spearheaded by Jones and three Latino
lawmakers: Sens. Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles) and Martha Escutia
(D-Whittier) and Assemblyman Marco A. Firebaugh (D-Los Angeles).</TE>
<TE>   Political observers say Latino power brokers have taken
high-profile roles in part to reverse the city's course, but also to
ease concerns that South Gate represents the future of Latino
politics.</TE>
<TE>   "It's smart politics," said Jaime A. Regalado, executive director
of the Pat Brown Institute of Public Affairs at Cal State Los
Angeles. "Latino leaders are distancing themselves from the powers
that be in South Gate, and are trying to put in good government
reform measures."</TE>
<TE>   But even with such outside pressure, the investigations and
increased media attention--one local newspaper ran an editorial
headlined, "Throw the bums out"--some critics hold little hope of
stopping the council majority's lock-step march.</TE>
<TE>   And attention inevitably shifts to Benavides, the beautician
turned councilwoman and swing vote on the council.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters say the quiet 29-year-old mother of two has been
silenced by intimidation. Her critics call Benavides a puppet who
parrots Moriel and Ruvalcaba.</TE>
<TE>   Benavides has indeed seemed confused at times when she doesn't
follow her allies in roll call votes. Once, when asked to vote first
on a redevelopment issue, she froze.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure yet, hold on," she said, sparking howls of laughter
from the crowd. After Benavides heard her allies vote, she voted
"yes."</TE>
<TE>   At another meeting, Ruvalcaba made sure her cousin wouldn't be
confused with her vote.</TE>
<TE>   "Maria," said the mayor. "Nay."</TE>
<TE>   "Nay," echoed Benavides.</TE>
<TE>   Such behavior leaves residents shaking their heads.</TE>
<TE>   "This would make one hell of a movie," said Sherman Miner, a
40-year resident, on the steps of City Hall one night.</TE>
<TE>   "Nah," replied Ted Chandler, a former Chamber of Commerce
president. "No one would believe it."</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah," said Miner. "You're probably right."</TE>

<HD>Health, Welfare Services Face Cuts</HD>
<DH>Budget: County officials say a decrease in state funding
could force further reductions in many local programs that benefit
the poor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMANDA COVARRUBIAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County will be forced to trim millions of dollars in health
and welfare services in response to cuts in the newly approved state
budget, the county's budget manager said.</LD>
<LD>   Budget experts for the county and local cities said they don't
know how much money they will lose or what programs will be affected
by the state's $99-billion budget signed last week by Gov. Gray
Davis.</LD>
<LD>   Davis used his line-item veto authority to pare $235 million from
the 2002-03 budget. Most of the money, $177 million, was cut from the
health and welfare budget.</LD>
<TE>   "We don't know how it translates to us," Ventura County budget
manager Bert Bigler said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, in the next week we'll have a detailed impact. We want
to get to the board [of supervisors] with our budget adjustment
recommendations as soon as we can."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the areas that could be affected include Medi-Cal payments
to doctors and other providers, mental health services to the poor,
food stamp administration, child welfare services, adult protective
services and adoptions, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever cuts are required come in addition to $17.6 million in
reductions the county Board of Supervisors approved in June when it
adopted a $1.2-billion budget for 2002-03.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors may have to tap into $10.3 million in tobacco
settlement funds to cover revenue shortfalls, Bigler said.</TE>
<TE>   In earlier budget talks, two citizen advisory committees urged
supervisors to use the annual tobacco money to continue county health
care programs created last year instead of using the money to plug
holes in the budget. The programs range from dental clinics for poor
children to payments for private hospitals that provide care for the
uninsured.</TE>
<TE>   State officials acknowledge the budget postpones tough decisions
until after the Nov. 5 election. It authorizes Davis to cut $1
billion more during the fiscal year, which ends June 30. His aides
have offered few specifics on how that will be done.</TE>
<TE>   "The cities are avoiding a major impact this year because the
governor and the Legislature want to avoid controversy until after
the election," said Scott Mitnick, deputy city manager of Thousand
Oaks. "But we've been down that path before--where we've been given
false promises only to have the reality be much worse."</TE>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks' Redevelopment Agency is likely to take the hardest
hit, absorbing an estimated $500,000 loss that would affect the
city's ability to finance and build affordable housing, Mitnick said.</TE>
<TE>   "On the one hand, the state tells us they want cities like
Thousand Oaks to build more affordable housing, but then there's a
big chunk taken away," Mitnick said.</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura, the effect on the city's general fund is likely to be
minimal, at least for now, said Administrative Services Director Tom
Gardner.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody sees that the budget is based on an upcoming election,"
he said.</TE>

<HD>Life Amid the Anguish of Loss</HD>
<DH>Reflections: For some area residents, the death of a
brother, wife, son or co-workers at the hands of terrorists has
turned them into victims of history.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CHAWKINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Colleen Rastovich shuddered the other day when she heard a plane
flying low over her toy-strewn east Ventura backyard. But the moment,
like a million others since Sept. 11, passed.</LD>
<LD>   Rastovich was a continent away from the devastation of that day.
But for her and a number of other people who live and work in Ventura
County, it was as close as an empty chair at the dining room table, a
dear friend never seen again, a riotous laugh never heard.</LD>
<LD>   For them, the shock and aftershocks of Sept. 11 dealt a terrible,
intimate loss.</LD>
<TE>   Not merely anguished witnesses to history, they were victims of
it. Here are a few of their stories.</TE>
<TE>   Look around her house and you will see why Colleen Rastovich never
gave evil much credit. The place is bursting with life. Six-year-old
twin sisters Tora and Lexi, miracle babies whose survival was in
doubt, gleefully wrestle in the living room. Eighteen-month-old Max
tags after brother Sam, soon to be 7. Their mom volunteers in the
classroom and gives piano lessons. She paints, sculpts and writes
songs. All in all, she seems like a woman who would breeze through
adversity with a diaper in one hand and a coffee mug in the other.</TE>
<TE>   But last Sept. 11 she was cast into a long, dark night of the
soul. Her brother, Joe Heller--the family organizer, prodder and
tell-it-like-he-sees-it kind of guy--was last heard from in a
conference room on the 92nd floor of the World Trade Center's north
tower.</TE>
<TE>   He had called his wife in Ridgefield, Conn., to tell her he was
OK. Later, others who received calls from that room reported they
were told that the blaze just beyond the threshold had melted the
doorknobs.</TE>
<TE>   "I never believed in evil," Rastovich said as she pondered the
year's changes at her backyard picnic table last week. "I just
thought of it as an absence of good."</TE>
<TE>   But since Sept. 11 she has opened her eyes to the extremes of
human behavior, from the depravity of the hijackers to the nobility
of the rescue workers.</TE>
<TE>   At 41, she now believes in evil. Raised a Catholic but never
devout, she has been gripped by urgent, spiritual questions that
never before seemed to matter.</TE>
<TE>   "All of a sudden, it's very important for me to know: Is there an
afterlife?" she said. "I want so badly to believe I'll see Joe
again."</TE>
<TE>   Three years older, she had been close to her brother since they
were kids in Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   He poured himself into everything he did, Rastovich said. When he
was in second grade, he was barred from the school bus after a tiff
with the driver. Somehow, he managed to run several miles home every
day after school, standing outside with a broad smile to greet the
bus as it pulled onto his block.</TE>
<TE>   "He was very, very stubborn," Rastovich said.</TE>
<TE>   A trader for a company called Carr Futures, Heller had worked in
the World Trade Center for 15 years. Most of the time he worked on
the second or third floor. But an unusual meeting Sept. 11 took him
up to the 92nd--a level on which there were no known survivors.</TE>
<TE>   Six weeks after the center's destruction, Heller's body was found.
Three memorial services had been held without it, and Rastovich was
surprised at how disturbed she was by the body's absence. But its
discovery also wound up tormenting her.</TE>
<TE>   "Incredibly, he was nearly intact," she said. "And how could that
be? Our latest theory is that maybe he was almost out of there--and
if he was that close, it's even harder to accept. It would really
help if I could get used to a scenario and just live with it."</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Sept. 11, she will drop by an observance at
Ventura's City Hall and attend a talk in Thousand Oaks by New Age
thinker Marianne Williamson. Otherwise, she will follow the routine
of a stay-at-home mom who has glimpsed a bit of hell.</TE>
<TE>   "I've become a terrible housekeeper," she joked. "But I'm on the
floor a lot more with the kids. I'm definitely paying a lot more
attention to the here and now."</TE>
<TE>   Earl Dorsey and his 5-year-old son, Jaryd, have their weekends
planned out this fall.</TE>
<TE>   They will travel all over the West to see Jaryd's 19-year-old
sister, Imani, play soccer for the University of Portland.</TE>
<TE>   That is just what they did two seasons ago--only then they were
accompanied by an exuberant woman with a wonderful laugh, a woman
whose loss they have been coping with since Flight 77 slammed into
the Pentagon on Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   When Dora Menchaca died, Dorsey, an attorney, lost his wife, the
children lost their mother, and a cozy world of domestic routine
suddenly was flung upside-down. But bit by bit over the past year,
the rhythms of home have been restored.</TE>
<TE>   "Even after Dora died, we went to see Imani's games," said Dorsey,
who was married 18 years to the woman he met as a graduate student at
UCLA. "That was our plan for the 2001 season and that's our plan this
year too."</TE>
<TE>   Stricken by chaos, Dorsey and his kids have hewed to routine.</TE>
<TE>   A research scientist at Amgen in Thousand Oaks, Dora Menchaca
walked the 26 miles of the Los Angeles Marathon in 2000 and 2001. In
tribute to her, Dorsey and Jaryd walked about 1 1/2 miles of it in
March, hand in hand.</TE>
<TE>   "It was arranged by Jaryd's bereavement group, so each of the kids
could walk a mile and complete the marathon," Dorsey said. "It was in
honor of all the kids who had lost a parent."</TE>
<TE>   Jaryd will be 6 next month. When he learned his mother had died,
he cried inconsolably and asked to plant purple roses. Menchaca loved
to tend the garden at the family's Santa Monica home. One of the last
things she told her son was that they would get purple flowers.</TE>
<TE>   At first, the concept of death--especially his mother's death--was
not something Jaryd fully grasped. But being around others trying to
bounce back after the death of a loved one has helped both him and
his dad.</TE>
<TE>   "We've come to some sort of peace with the situation," Dorsey
said. "We've worked with various support groups that each of us is
involved in to pull our lives together and proceed in a way that Dora
would be proud of."</TE>
<TE>   Menchaca grew up poor in San Antonio. The first of her
Mexican-American family to attend college, she went on to earn a
doctorate in epidemiology. At Amgen, she was known for her passion,
her willingness to work through the night on the complex clinical
trials required before bringing a drug to market.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 11, she caught an earlier plane than the one she was
booked on.</TE>
<TE>   She had spent the previous day briefing government officials on a
prostate cancer drug she was helping to develop. The next day, she
was eager to get back to her family.</TE>
<TE>   Her flight was terrifyingly short.</TE>
<TE>   Her husband has not flown to Washington since her death, but he
has flown.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have any more anxiety than I would normally," he said.
"But there isn't a time I fly that my thoughts don't turn to my wife
and what her last moments would have been like."</TE>
<TE>   The turns the world has taken since then would sadden her, Dorsey
said, his voice tightening.</TE>
<TE>   "Dora wouldn't want what happened to her to cause any bitterness
or anger or resentment or further pain," he said. "Violence is not
the answer for the differences that separate all of us."</TE>
<TE>   At his rambling ranch house in the rugged Lockwood Valley, Brian
Prosser wasn't quite certain that the living-room memorial to his son
would be a comforting addition.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought maybe it would be gruesome or morbid, but as soon as I
hung it up, I knew I did just the right thing--because he's here."</TE>
<TE>   The display case he mounted holds his son's Green Beret uniform,
complete with decorations earned from serving in Kosovo, Somalia,
Saudi Arabia and Haiti.</TE>
<TE>   Staff Sgt. Brian Cody Prosser's last assignment was in
Afghanistan. With two other American soldiers, he was killed by
friendly fire as the United States tried to root out Osama bin Laden
after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "My boy was just one of the select few," said Prosser, a
gravel-voiced retired Los Angeles firefighter. "You see a lot of them
in Arlington."</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-eight years old, Cody died in a skirmish north of Kandahar
on Dec. 5. Since then, his father, wheelchair-bound after an accident
years ago, has made it a point to speak out.</TE>
<TE>   "I want guys like my son not to pay the price they've paid for
nothing," he said. "I'm afraid his contribution to our freedom will
be forgotten."</TE>
<TE>   Captain of his high school's football team, Cody Prosser was known
as a tough competitor--one who would barely grunt when he dislocated
his shoulder during games and have his dad, the team's assistant
coach, pop it back in.</TE>
<TE>   Even as a boy, people in his rural community knew he wanted
nothing more than to be a Green Beret. As he became a young man, that
flame burned even hotter. At a memorial service, his 10-year-old
niece, Taylor Prosser, summed up his spirit in a poem:</TE>
<TE>   "My uncle Cody, a killing machine," it went. "My uncle Cody, a
whisper in the sky."</TE>
<TE>   An Army veteran himself, Cody's father moved his family to the
sage-studded open spaces outside Frazier Park in 1965.</TE>
<TE>   His oldest son had asthma, and a fellow firefighter told him that
living in this mountain hideaway might ease the boy's condition.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of things get settled around the kitchen table in a
firehouse," said Prosser, who ran a blacksmith shop after he left the
Fire Department.</TE>
<TE>   At 64, Prosser follows the news avidly. These days, he often
bristles.</TE>
<TE>   "I see people on TV upset over the way John Walker Lindh was being
treated," he said, referring to the young American who admitted
fighting for the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   "I see barriers being removed around city halls. I see signs that
people don't really believe that these folks over there hate us and
have taken an oath to make sure we don't live too long. That makes me
sad."</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 11, Prosser plans to speak at a local school. Painful as
the day will be, he said he welcomed it as a chance to remind people
of freedom's cost, of his son's sacrifice.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a warrior," Prosser said. "One-hundred percent."</TE>
<TE>   If there is a story of good luck on Sept. 11, it has to be Dan
White's. But even the best of luck in horrible times can leave its
scars.</TE>
<TE>   White made it out of the 84th floor of the World Trade Center's
south tower unscathed.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly one-quarter of his 280 colleagues did not.</TE>
<TE>   "They were people you have over for dinner, people you trade
stories about your kids with," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "On occasion, I've come across family members of people who were
killed and I could completely envision them as my wife, my mother, my
son. I go through an awful lot of what-if scenarios."</TE>
<TE>   White, 32, lives in Simi Valley with his wife, Corinna, and their
two young sons.</TE>
<TE>   But two weeks a month he works in the New York offices of a firm
called Eurobrokers, which in 2000 acquired the software company he
founded.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 11, White and the other 150 employees on the firm's
trading floor were jolted by an enormous boom. Through the window
they saw flames, smoke and debris pouring from the windows of the
north tower nearby.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was a bomb," White said. "I thought I'd grab my
laptop and cell phone, head to JFK, go home, and not come back."</TE>
<TE>   White joined a crowd hurrying down the stairs.</TE>
<TE>   Some others reversed course when a voice on the loudspeaker
sounded an all-clear, but White kept going. When another explosion
rocked the building as he hit the 34th floor, he picked up the pace.</TE>
<TE>   "I was in a get-the-hell-out-of-there mode," he recalled. "I had
to get away."</TE>
<TE>   When he finally emerged from a pedestrian walkway onto the street,
he was desperate to call his wife. But first he looked up and saw
both towers on fire.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything around my floor was in flames," he said. "I thought
anyone who stayed was dead. I thought of the guys I knew who would
have dillydallied around, or made sure everyone was evacuated before
they were."</TE>
<TE>   Two days later he was back in Simi Valley, vowing never to fly
again. After six weeks, he did. Over the past year, he figures he has
been back in New York 18 or 19 times for Eurobrokers. Each time he
boards a flight he has to remind himself of the statistic he pulled
from the FAA Web site: About 30,000 planes daily lift off and land in
the United States without mishap.</TE>
<TE>   "My approach to fear--and everyone deals with it differently--is
to learn everything I can to face it down," he said. "But it's not
always so easy."</TE>
<TE>   Additional data do not help the software designer come to grips
with the chilling randomness of the deaths around him.</TE>
<TE>   "I made a set of choices and I didn't know whether they'd turn out
to be right or wrong," he said. "But there was a guy just behind me
on the stairs who went back up. And I saw these other people waiting
for an elevator on the 78th floor. They must have been slaughtered."</TE>
<TE>   Thunder can rattle him, and sharp, loud noises such as a truck
backfiring.</TE>
<TE>   For a while, he couldn't absorb the latest grim news at work about
co-workers found dead in the debris or identified from body parts.</TE>
<TE>   "At first I was just numb," he said. "It took three or four weeks
before I could really think about a couple of good friends."</TE>
<TE>   White wanted to attend a company memorial service in New York on
Sept. 11 but declined. Instead, he will speak at an evening ceremony
in Simi Valley's City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to be with my family, but to me and my wife, it was
inconceivable for them to board a plane and come to New York. At
home, I'll feel really safe."</TE>

<DL>FT. BRAGG, N.C.</DL>
<LD>Military police from the North Carolina National Guard returned home
Saturday, seven months after they began guarding Al Qaeda and Taliban
prisoners in Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   About 250 loved ones gathered at the Army post awaiting the return
of members of the 211th Military Police Company.</LD>
<LD>   No one knew exactly when the unit would return to U.S. soil. A
hoped-for July return was postponed until August, then September. The
unit has been given two weeks' leave before it has to return to duty
at Ft. Bragg.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a new beginning for us," Geraldine Shields told the
Asheville Citizen-Times as she waited for her husband, Nathan, a
staff sergeant. "We've never been apart in 20 years for more than two
weeks. I learned to be a stronger wife. I had to learn to deal with
more."</TE>
<TE>   In December, 106 members of the unit were activated. They left for
Afghanistan in February to guard more than 100 detainees in military
prisons at the Kandahar and Bagram air bases. Officials released few
details of the 211th's missions.</TE>
<TE>   "There aren't too many jobs more important than what they were
doing," said Capt. Robert Carver, a Guard spokesman. "They were key
in finding out what was going on in the world of the Al Qaeda and the
Taliban."</TE>
<TE>   The unit is one of only a few nationwide that specializes in
guarding prisoners of war, Carver added.</TE>

<HD>Youth Held in Hammer Attack of Fellow Student</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WARRENSVILLE HEIGHTS, Ohio</DL>
<LD>A 16-year-old boy was in police custody Saturday, accused of
bludgeoning another student with a hammer during a dispute over a
video-game controller, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The attack occurred Thursday at Warrensville Heights High School.</LD>
<LD>   The victim, also 16, suffered a fractured skull and was taken to
Hillcrest Hospital. The hospital would not release the condition of
the boy, who is in the ninth grade.</LD>
<TE>   His accused attacker, an 11th-grader, could be charged with felony
assault, police Detective Dennis Fossett said. He was being held in a
juvenile detention center.</TE>
<TE>   Fossett said the 11th-grader told him Wednesday that the
ninth-grader threatened to "beat him until he stopped breathing" if
he did not bring in money to replace a lost video-game controller
that had belonged to the ninth-grader.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the 11th-grader took a hammer, walked up behind the
ninth-grader and hit him twice on the right side of the head, Fossett
said.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses told police that the ninth-grader fell, and his attacker
swung the hammer two more times and kicked at his head. A security
guard later restrained the 11th-grader.</TE>
<TE>   School Superintendent Gwendolyn Cooke said she would recommend the
11th-grader's immediate expulsion.</TE>

<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>A new board has been named to head the Terra Museum of American Art
in a changeover mandated by a legal settlement last year.</LD>
<LD>   Eleven former board members stepped down Friday and were quickly
replaced by the new board, with Marshall Field V as chairman.</LD>
<LD>   The museum--with more than 700 works by such artists as Edward
Hopper and Georgia O'Keeffe--has been involved in a two-year legal
battle.</LD>
<TE>   Two board members sued to block what they said was a scheme by
Judith Terra, widow of museum founder Daniel Terra, and supporters to
move the $100-million collection to Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement requires the Terra Foundation to remain in Illinois
for 50 years and the art collection to be based in the Chicago area.</TE>
<TE>   The 15-member board--four other people were named to it last
year--is made up of businesspeople, art experts and academicians.</TE>
<TE>   Field is a Chicago executive who is the former head of Field
Enterprises and former publisher of the Sun-Times. He is a
fifth-generation heir of Marshall Field, who created a department
store dynasty bearing his name.</TE>

<HD>Tropical Storm Spawns Twisters, High Tides as It Strikes
Texas</HD>
<DH>Weather: Fay weakens as it heads inland. Nearly a foot of
rain is reported in southeast part of state.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Tropical Storm Fay came ashore Saturday, spawning high tides and
tornadoes. The storm was quickly weakening, but it had inundated some
areas with nearly a foot of rain.</LD>
<LD>   By late afternoon, Fay's ill-defined center had drifted just south
of San Antonio, where it had dumped nearly 2 inches of rain, with
more expected.</LD>
<LD>   Street flooding, coastal erosion and scattered power outages were
reported in southeastern Texas, but Fay caused no deaths or serious
injuries.</LD>
<TE>   "We were worried about Galveston, other counties along the coast,"
said Russ Lecklider, a controller with the state's Emergency
Operations Center in Austin. "There were some evacuations on
Galveston Island and the Bolivar Peninsula, but not large numbers of
people. We got off very easy in the coastal areas."</TE>
<TE>   Brazoria, Matagorda and Wharton counties had 5 to 8 inches of
rain, and Freeport and West Columbia in Brazoria County reported
nearly a foot.</TE>
<TE>   "The rain was so heavy you couldn't even see out of the house,"
Edward Guajardo said in the city of Wharton, about 60 miles southwest
of Houston.</TE>
<TE>   The storm's influence also extended eastward along the Gulf Coast,
with 3.94 inches of rain at Pascagoula, Miss.; 1.03 at Mobile, Ala.;
and 0.74 of an inch at Boothville, La.</TE>
<TE>   The storm had stalled offshore all day Friday and threatened to
become a weak hurricane, but it never gathered enough strength. When
it came ashore early Saturday southwest of Houston, it had sustained
winds approaching 60 mph. The minimum for a hurricane is 74 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Tide gauges at Freeport showed the storm surge at 4 feet above
normal tide level early Saturday. In coastal areas, the surge usually
is the most destructive part of a tropical storm or hurricane.</TE>
<TE>   Tornadoes were reported later Saturday in Wharton County. One
destroyed a mobile home at Boling, and another damaged a home and a
truck at Hungerford, an official said. Another tornado was reported
in Fort Bend County.</TE>
<TE>   After passing the coast, the storm's remnants headed toward San
Antonio at about 7 mph.</TE>
<TE>   "Lecklider said officials were worried about what Fay could do to
the area of San Antonio and south-central Texas, which is still
recovering from flooding in July.</TE>
<TE>   "Our concern is that it stalls and that area gets 10 to 15 inches
of rain," Lecklider said.</TE>

<HD>Ship Named New York in 9/11 Victims' Honor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A new $800-million warship to be used in the fight against terrorism
was named the amphibious assault ship New York on Saturday in honor
of the victims of the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<LD>   "On Sept. 11, 2001, our nation's enemies brought their fight to
New York.... The USS New York will now bring the fight to our
nation's enemies well into the future," Gov. George Pataki said at a
naming ceremony aboard the flight deck of the aircraft carrier
Intrepid, a floating museum on the Hudson River.</LD>
<LD>   Construction on the New York is scheduled to start in mid-2003,
with delivery expected in 2006.</LD>
<TE>   A model unveiled Saturday will be displayed at the Intrepid
Air-Sea-Space Museum in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Pataki held the ceremony with Navy Secretary Gordon England, who
granted special dispensation for the name. Presently, submarines
usually carry the names of states, Pataki said.</TE>
<TE>   Several naval ships have held the name New York or New York City.
The most recent was a battleship commissioned in 1914. It fought in
European and Pacific waters during World War II.</TE>
<TE>   The submarine New York City was decommissioned in the 1990s after
about 20 years of service.</TE>
<TE>   The New York will be the fifth of 12 amphibious assault ships in
the San Antonio class, which the Navy calls one of its most
technologically innovative. The 684-foot vessel will carry a Navy
crew of 402 and up to 800 Marines.</TE>
<TE>   The ship can be also be used in relief and rescue operations.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop Grumman Ship Systems will build the San Antonio class
vessels, which will require about 1,500 employees to develop.</TE>
<TE>   Delivery of the first ship is scheduled for November 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop Grumman officials said they haven't decided whether the
ship will be assembled in Pascagoula, Miss., or New Orleans.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>VIEQUES, Puerto Rico</DL>
<LD>U.S. Navy fighter jets streaked across the sky Saturday, dropping
dummy bombs and inert missiles on Vieques in the type of exercises
that have divided this outlying Puerto Rican island for years.</LD>
<LD>   In the first of three planned weeks of exercises, Navy destroyers
San Jacinto, Briscoe, Mitscher, Deyo and Donald Cook fired their
inert bombs without problems and received certificates for completing
the training exercises, said Lt. Cmdr. Kim Dixon, a Navy spokeswoman.</LD>
<LD>   Overnight, however, Navy officials fired tear gas at a few dozen
protesters, who threw rocks and hurled burning flares over the fence
into Camp Garcia, she said Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   "Our soldiers responded to seven separate attacks of rocks and
flares thrown by demonstrators toward the base," Dixon said. There
were no arrests.</TE>
<TE>   The military has used the bombing range on Vieques since the
1940s. Opposition to the exercises grew slowly until 1999, when a
civilian guard was killed after a Navy jet dropped two off-target
bombs. Since then, only inert bombs have been used.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1999, hundreds of people have tried to thwart the exercises
by trespassing on the bombing range, often being arrested, jailed and
fined.</TE>
<TE>   In the last week, authorities have detained nine people for
allegedly trespassing. Five men, all affiliated with the Puerto Rican
Independence Party, were jailed when they refused to pay a fine
ordered by a court.</TE>
<TE>   The bombing range covers 900 acres--less than 3% of the
island--and is nearly 10 miles from civilian areas.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush has promised that the Navy will leave Vieques by
May, but as the United States moves closer to a conflict with Iraq,
that timetable will be tested.</TE>
<TE>   At least 27 members of Congress have urged Bush to issue an
executive order guaranteeing the Navy's departure.</TE>
<TE>   But even on Vieques, which has a population of 9,100, opinions
about the Navy's presence vary.</TE>
<TE>   Maria Angelica Torres, a 54-year-old maintenance worker, said she
wished the Navy would leave immediately. She said the military
exercises have prevented the island from pursuing economic
development.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no progress here, no tourism. There is nothing because
the Navy is opposed to everything," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Others, such as 67-year-old Jorge Carrillo, support the exercises.</TE>
<TE>   "Why not stay if they don't bother anyone," said Carrillo, who was
waiting at the post office to collect his Medicare check. "The
explosions help me sleep at night. Thunder is louder when it
happens."</TE>
<TE>   Others, such as homemaker Maria Teresa Navarro, 69, are
ambivalent.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't say" if the Navy should stay or go," she said. "The Navy
has been good to Vieques.... My husband worked [on the base] for many
years."</TE>

<HD>Bush Takes Diplomatic Detour on Iraq Policy</HD>
<DH>Strategy: Tough talk on a 'regime change' will come only
after urging 'disarmament.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT and DOYLE McMANUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>For months, the Bush administration has been wrestling with two
imperfect options: Pushing ahead with a military plan to overthrow
Saddam Hussein. Or pressing at the United Nations for intrusive new
inspections to rid the Iraqi leader of his deadliest arms.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, President Bush made his decision: He's going to do
both.</LD>
<LD>   The new U.S. course, a response to both domestic and international
pressures, also bridges a gap within the administration. It blends
the tactics advocated quietly behind the scenes by Secretary of State
Colin L. Powell with the strategic goals pronounced publicly and
intensely by Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of Defense
Donald H. Rumsfeld.</LD>
<TE>   So, at least for now, more tough talk about "regime change" will
come only after further diplomatic language about "disarming" Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue is disarmament," Bush said last week. "I'm going to
call upon the world to recognize that [Hussein] is stiffing the
world.... And I will talk about ways to make sure that he fulfills
his obligations."</TE>
<TE>   Bush's decision to stop by the United Nations on the road to
Baghdad was a significant concession for a president who has often
been willing to travel alone. The only thing that may have changed
over the last week, however, is the number of stops on the journey.</TE>
<TE>   The president, who is scheduled to address the General Assembly on
Thursday, hasn't wavered in his belief that the only reliable way to
disarm Iraq is to topple Hussein, who has spent much of 23 years in
power building weapons of mass destruction--and occasionally using
them.</TE>
<TE>   Bush will press this week for immediate, intrusive U.N.
inspections of Iraq. But if the goal of eliminating Hussein's
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles isn't
reached quickly, the drumbeat of war will resume.</TE>
<TE>   As backup, the administration is also assembling a dossier
alleging Iraqi violations of other U.N. resolutions, including
massive human rights abuses against Iraqi citizens and neighboring
countries that might be punishable as war crimes. The implicit
message is that disarmament is not enough.</TE>
<TE>   Hawks inside and outside the Bush administration who argued
against seeking new authority from the U.N. Security Council for
action against Iraq hope the president's New York visit is only a
short detour.</TE>
<TE>   But administration officials insist that the new diplomatic
offensive is about substance, not just style.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just a show. It's the president realizing you have to
make the effort, you have to go to the U.N., you've got to gather
allies and like-minded friends and persuade them of the
right-mindedness of it," said a senior State Department official who
requested anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not tossing a fig leaf. It's more than a bow to
international opinion."</TE>
<TE>   The administration's approach has now changed in two fundamental
ways.</TE>
<TE>   First, the justification for action has shifted. Lacking a
commanding new casus belli, or reason for war, hawks in the
administration had tried to wrap Iraq up in the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Some tried to cite the presence of Al Qaeda forces in northern
Iraq's Kurdistan--even though the Islamic militants there are
operating in opposition territory and also seeking to oust Hussein's
secular regime.</TE>
<TE>   But that argument, in the absence of clear linkage, had few takers
at home and virtually none besides Israel abroad. Iraq increasingly
stands as a separate danger.</TE>
<TE>   Second, deliberations within the administration on the complex
issues faced in Iraq--from ousting a dictator and creating a
democracy to stabilizing a fractious society and ensuring the free
flow of oil to the outside world--made it clear that the United
States could not go it alone, U.S. officials acknowledge. The
cacophony of voices at home and abroad questioning, cautioning,
worrying about and protesting America's determination to confront the
Iraqi leader also took a toll.</TE>
<TE>   So the administration is plunging into real consultation with
other governments, a process that is likely to dominate its fall
agenda--and influence the outcome.</TE>
<TE>   One sign of the administration's seriousness is its plan to
dispatch U.S. teams--made up of intelligence, military and diplomatic
officials armed with massive dossiers of intelligence data--to about
40 countries over the next few weeks to outline its concerns about
Iraq's weapons programs, according to U.S. officials.</TE>
<TE>   Another was the State Department scramble at week's end to outline
the many scenarios that could now unfold--including the possibility
that Hussein might comply with U.N. resolutions, allow inspectors
into Iraq and dismantle his weapons.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to be prepared to take yes for an answer," another
official warned. "What if all conditions are met for the most
vigorous, the most coercive set of inspections? The odds of that are
slim, but not 100%" impossible, the official said.</TE>
<TE>   A more likely scenario, U.S. officials predicted, is an outright
Iraqi refusal to allow the inspectors to return after a four-year
absence. Another is for Baghdad to put obstacles in their way. But if
either happens, the sources noted, the United States would be better
positioned to argue for international support of a U.S. military
action.</TE>
<TE>   Dispatching inspectors is "a way of getting the U.N. to coalesce
around any subsequent action if the inspectors don't get back in,"
Powell said last week during a swing through Africa.</TE>
<TE>   Some administration officials argue that Washington would then not
need further authorization to launch a military offensive. The United
States could invoke earlier U.N. resolutions.</TE>
<TE>   "The blessing here was the disarmament regime set in place in
1991--with which Saddam has not complied," National Security Advisor
Condoleezza Rice said last week.</TE>
<TE>   For the time being, hawks who had warned that going to the U.N.
might be clambering onto a slippery slope away from war say they are
comfortable with the new tone.</TE>
<TE>   "I still think he is going to use military force," said William
Kristol, editor of the conservative Weekly Standard. "These are all
tactics to get as much support as possible.... It's using Powell's
means for Cheney's ends.</TE>
<TE>   "There is some danger of a slippery slope, but not much," Kristol
said. "It's less dangerous because the administration knows how
slippery it is."</TE>

<LD>Uganda and Congo have signed a deal to help bring peace to Congo,
where four years of civil war have left about 2.5 million people
dead. Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and his Congolese
counterpart, Joseph Kabila, signed the accord in the Angolan capital,
Luanda. The signing was witnessed by Angolan President Jose Eduardo
dos Santos.</LD>
<LD>   Diplomats said the accord committed Uganda to withdrawing its
remaining troops from Congo, where they have been fighting alongside
rebels.</LD>
<LD>   Congo, in turn, pledged to take action against rebels based in the
east of the mineral-rich country who are hostile to the Museveni
government in Kampala.</LD>

<HD>Couple Not Tied to Terror Networks</HD>

<AU>JEFFREY FLEISHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>A Turkish man and his American fiancee appear not to have had the
backing of terrorist networks in an alleged plot to bomb the U.S.
Army base at Heidelberg on the anniversary of Sept. 11, the German
Interior Ministry said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The couple, who were arrested Thursday when police confiscated
bomb-making materials and Islamic literature from their apartment
outside Heidelberg, about 300 miles southwest of Berlin, were
portrayed by authorities as being sympathetic to Osama bin Laden but
lacking connections to extremist cells and militant groups.</LD>
<LD>   "Based on what we know so far, we are dealing with an individual
[the Turkish man] who has shown no indication of participation in a
terrorist network," German Interior Minister Otto Schily told Antenna
Bayern Radio on Saturday. "It seems we are dealing with a dangerous
individual with an Islamic background."</LD>
<TE>   The couple--identified Saturday as Oman Petmezci, 24, of Turkish
origin, and his American-born fiancee, Astrid Eyzaguirre,
23--espoused deep hatred for Americans and Jews, according to friends
and law enforcement officials. Their alleged plot, to explode bombs
at the U.S. Army base where Eyzaguirre worked in a store, would have
struck at the core of the American military presence in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   The Heidelberg base is the U.S. Army's European headquarters and
home to 16,000 soldiers, civilians and dependents. Police allege that
Petmezci, employed by a chemical warehouse in Karlsruhe, had amassed
287 pounds of chemicals and explosive materials, including five pipe
bombs, for a Sept. 11 attack.</TE>
<TE>   According to a report Saturday in the German magazine Der Spiegel,
a friend of Eyzaguirre's told U.S. military police that Eyzaguirre
had told her she sympathized with Bin Laden and had warned her to
stay away from the Army base in the days leading up to Sept. 11. U.S.
authorities then tipped off German law enforcement agencies, which
raided the couple's third-floor apartment in Walldorf, five miles
south of Heidelberg, on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Schily's playing down the possibility that the alleged
plot was part of a broader conspiracy involving Al Qaeda remnants or
sleeper cells, some German officials expressed concerns that a
mastermind lurks behind Petmezci and Eyzaguirre.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not very likely that a warehouse worker," Bavarian Interior
Minister Guenther Beckstein said of Petmezci, "could by himself build
explosives out of chemicals and make an ignition switch out of
electronic parts.... He must have had instruction."</TE>
<TE>   German TV reported that Petmezci might have had links to Islamic
groups, including a center in Heidelberg that was under suspicion for
financing the 1998 bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa.</TE>
<TE>   Part of Petmezci's motivation for an attack, according to police
officials, was a devotion to Islam.</TE>
<TE>   But one friend of Petmezci's, Jeurgen Meyer, alluded to
inconsistencies in Petmezci's espoused religious rigidity.</TE>
<TE>   Meyer said that Petmezci spoke often of hating Jews but that
during evenings watching soccer matches, Petmezci drank beer, which
is forbidden under strict Islamic law.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was all nonsense," Meyer said of Petmezci's
anti-Semitism.</TE>
<TE>   The arrests of Petmezci and Eyzaguirre, who have not yet been
charged, came as anxious law enforcement officials around the world
are bracing for possible attacks on the anniversary of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Germany and the rest of Europe have become increasingly worried
that sleeper cells and hidden operatives of Bin Laden and other
radicals will strike U.S. and Jewish targets.</TE>
<TE>   An Army source at Heidelberg said the alleged plot against the
base had caused little fretting there, however.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no ratcheting up of security," said the officer. "We've
had tight security here for months. There's flak jackets and guns,
and cars are checked. Some new random measures are being
implemented.... But I haven't detected any heightened sense of
anxiety."</TE>

<HD>Diverse Opposition Groups Struggling to Pull Together</HD>
<DH>Activists: The exile community works to overcome deep
religious, ethnic and tribal differences as hopes build for a new
Iraq.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEBASTIAN ROTELLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>These are agitated times in the Iraqi community here.</LD>
<LD>   Strategists gather in no-frills offices near Persian groceries and
Islamic butcher shops, or in sleek cafes with views of Muslim women
in black veils, full-length robes and high-heeled designer shoes
entering Harrods department store.</LD>
<LD>   The exiles talk about intrigues, their high hopes and the
rumblings of war. They talk, at last, about action.</LD>
<TE>   Ever since a landmark meeting with U.S. officials in Washington
last month, leaders of half a dozen Iraqi opposition groups have been
working to overcome conflicts rooted in their country's deep
religious, ethnic and tribal differences. They have stepped up
decade-old cloak-and-dagger operations: They are debriefing defectors
and aiding guerrillas inside Iraq, and they claim to be infiltrating
spies into the regime of Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   They have sat down to define their role in the U.S.-led campaign
to topple Hussein and bring democracy to Iraq once he is gone.</TE>
<TE>   "Almost everyone is committed to democracy and a
constitution--that is fundamental to our unity," said Nabeel Musawi
of the Iraqi National Congress, a coalition of opposition groups. "We
are continuing to debate and that is a healthy thing. The debate
should continue all the way to Baghdad. We are so diverse--Shiites,
Sunnis, Kurds. We are as diverse as the American nation."</TE>
<TE>   The opposition groups are organizing a conference of Iraqi exiles
from around the world in Europe next month. They want to produce a
manifesto outlining a democratic future for Iraq and a leadership
committee to guide a post-Hussein political transition.</TE>
<TE>   But some activists want to limit participants to no more than 100,
while others insist that a truly inclusive event would include about
300. There is also infighting about a State Department program in
which dissidents discuss issues such as justice, infrastructure and
finances in a nascent Iraqi democracy. About 25 people took part in
such a "working group" outside London last month, but a few leaders
privately called it a waste of time.</TE>
<TE>   The disputes are symptomatic of problems that lead some U.S. and
British policymakers to conclude that the opposition is unreliable.
Despite the exiles' exhilaration and speculation, triggered by an
apparently imminent showdown with Hussein, critics say these mostly
well-off, well-educated and Westernized exiles have limited clout in
Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Like Afghanistan, Iraq has deep divisions that could tear the
country apart if the current regime falls. Analysts say it is
difficult to come up with a representative leadership council from
among the exiles, much less a potential leader for a transition
similar to Hamid Karzai in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "None are ideal candidates," said Daniel Neep, head of Middle
Eastern studies at the Royal United Services Institute, a think tank
here. "You are kind of importing a leadership."</TE>
<TE>   There are an estimated 200,000 Iraqis in Britain, most of them in
London. Their leaders say they wouldn't presume to create a
provisional government now. They recognize that the leaders of the
future could well emerge inside Iraq, according to Hamid Bayati, the
London representative of the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution
in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "There may be people in Baghdad who are more qualified," Bayati
said. "We are only doing political and media work outside Iraq. We
would be disrespectful if we established a government in exile. We
hope people inside will be major players."</TE>
<TE>   Edward S. Walker Jr., president of the Middle East Institute and a
former U.S. ambassador to Israel, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates,
told Times editors and reporters that even if the Iraqi opposition
unites, it might not be able to stay together.</TE>
<TE>   "They will unite for the purpose of getting rid of Saddam, then
they will fall apart afterwards over their own interests," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bayati's group represents the Shiite Muslim community, which
dominates the south and accounts for about 60% of Iraq's 22 million
people. The group's political and religious leader, Ayatollah
Mohammed Bakr Hakim, lives in Iran.</TE>
<TE>   Iran's government backs the group's military wing, called the Badr
Brigade, which wages guerrilla war on the Iraqi armed forces. The
council has put together a gory video of its actions, including a
night raid on an Iraqi army outpost, a drive-by shooting attack on a
ruling-party headquarters, and the attempted car-bomb assassination
of a former Iraqi prime minister in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Neither the United States nor Iraq's Sunni Muslims want to see the
Shiite organization dominate post-Hussein Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The organization's strong ties to Iran have ensured that the
Islamic dissidents "have never been flavor of the month for the U.S.
government," Neep said. Bayati said his group did not participate in
last month's State Department conference because "we think Iraq
should be dealt with by Iraqis. It will look as if America is trying
to plan the future of Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   The Shiite group urges the U.S. to refrain from an all-out
invasion of Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Bayati called for an Afghan-style proxy campaign relying
on the Shiite fighters in the south, estimated at between 7,000 and
15,000, and Kurdish forces totaling about 40,000 in the north.</TE>
<TE>   British military analysts are not optimistic about that strategy,
however. Obstacles include the superior firepower of Iraqi forces and
the reluctance of Kurds to jeopardize their semiautonomous status by
going to war without knowing what regime would replace Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   The Kurdistan Democratic Party and the Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan, the two main factions in the north, say they have overcome
their bitter rifts. But the existence of a semiautonomous Kurdistan
protected by U.S. and British air forces that patrol a "no-fly" zone
puts the Kurds in a fundamentally different, more delicate position
than other opposition groups, said Dilshad Miran, the London
representative of the Kurdistan Democratic Party.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not a party in exile because we are present in Iraq, we
have our own armed forces and judiciary," Miran said. "Anything we do
and say will have a direct consequence on the situation of our people
in the safe haven in the north of Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   Kurdish negotiations with the regime in Baghdad have been
fruitless, Miran said. "Now we're adopting a policy of a federal
democracy in Iraq where Kurds, Arabs, Shiites and all other groups
have a role."</TE>
<TE>   An alternative vision of the future comes from the Constitutional
Monarchy Movement led by Sharif Ali bin Hussein, a relative of Iraq's
last king, who was assassinated in 1958. He has joined the common
embrace of a democracy, as has the Iraqi National Accord, created in
1990 by military defectors and described as having ties to U.S.
intelligence agencies.</TE>
<TE>   The most prominent dissident force is probably the Iraqi National
Congress, the umbrella group led by Ahmad Chalabi, a wealthy Shiite
intellectual.</TE>
<TE>   The INC ran into difficulties with the State Department this year
when U.S. diplomats temporarily cut the group's funding in a clash
over its accounting practices and use of U.S. funds.</TE>
<TE>   Chalabi remains a close ally of some congressional leaders and
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and his aides, despite critics
who say he lacks stature inside Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "He has more support on Capitol Hill than in Baghdad," Neep said.</TE>
<TE>   Neep is among those who predict that a transitional government
will be less democratic than exiles hope, and will be likely to
incorporate high-ranking military figures who break with the Iraqi
president.</TE>
<TE>   In response, INC leaders say they have been hard at work
developing a strong espionage network in Iraq and recruiting
defectors who have provided valuable information.</TE>
<TE>   Musawi, a political advisor to Chalabi, went to Bangkok, Thailand,
last year to debrief and turn over to U.S. defense officials a former
engineer who said he fled Iraq after constructing clandestine
biological weapons laboratories.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition leaders reject the premise that Iraq and the Arab world
in general must be governed by political strongmen because their
societies are culturally unprepared for democracy.</TE>
<TE>   "The Iraqis would be extremely touchy about someone in uniform
taking over," Musawi said. "You have corrupt, backward leaders
throughout the region, and all the countries in Europe, even the
United States, have reaped the benefits. We want a fundamental change
that leads ultimately to a Western-style democracy. Iraq can become
an example of what the Middle East could be in the next century."</TE>

<DL>BAZARAK, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>After praying at the grave of legendary anti-Taliban commander Ahmed
Shah Masoud, who was slain by a suicide bomber last year, President
Hamid Karzai vowed Saturday to fight terrorism despite an attempt on
his life two days earlier.</LD>
<LD>   "We will continue to fight. We will continue to go and fulfill the
objectives and desires of the man who is lying buried under the
ground here," Karzai said from the Panjshir Valley in northern
Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   Karzai has been moving under heavy guard since a governor's
security guard tried to gun him down Thursday in the southern city of
Kandahar. At least 14 people who had served as guards for Gov. Gul
Agha Shirzai have been held for questioning.</LD>
<TE>   The gunman has been identified as Abdul Rahman, 22, from Helmand
province, where sympathy for the Taliban remains strong.</TE>
<TE>   Security has also been increased in the capital, Kabul, after a
car bombing Thursday left at least 24 dead. One man is under arrest
in connection with the blast, Interior Ministry official Ali Shah
said.</TE>

<HD>Israel Says Palestinian Security Reforms Loom</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>In a rare note of optimism, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said
preparations for a new Palestinian security apparatus--a key demand
of the U.S. and Israel--are likely to begin this month.</LD>
<LD>   Even so, Sharon said, the Palestinians have failed to keep their
part of a tentative truce agreement. In a radio interview aired
Saturday, he also repeated demands for a total cessation of violence
and an overhaul of the Palestinian Authority before the peace process
can be revived.</LD>
<LD>   Early Saturday, Israeli troops in the Gaza Strip town of Deir el
Balah detained six men and destroyed two buildings, one of which the
army says was used to make weapons--a claim the Palestinians denied.
The army said it also searched a Gaza office belonging to Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement and found a
"powerful explosive device."</LD>
<TE>   In the West Bank city of Hebron on Saturday, Israeli soldiers
arrested Hamas militant Hisham Sharabaty.</TE>
<TE>   In Jenin, about 200 Palestinian students defied a curfew imposed
on most West Bank towns Saturday to keep militants penned in during
the Jewish New Year. The students hurled stones at Israeli armored
vehicles, which responded with automatic weapons fire, witnesses
said. Hospital staff said four young people were injured.</TE>
<TE>   The army said it was unaware of any large-scale demonstration in
Jenin. It said that a gunman shot at an Israeli patrol there and that
troops fired back.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian youths in the West Bank city of Ramallah also broke
the curfew. Dozens of boys from the Al Amari refugee camp threw
stones at Israeli army vehicles. Troops responded with tear gas and
rubber bullets, but no injuries were reported.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking to Israel's Army Radio, Sharon said the rehabilitation of
the Palestinian security forces was imminent.</TE>
<TE>   "Training and preparation of a new security apparatus will, I
estimate, begin during the course of this month," he said. "That's a
beginning."</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian Interior Minister Abdel Razak Yehiyeh said late
Saturday that there was not going to be a new security apparatus but
rather a "refresher" course for the already existing security forces.</TE>
<TE>   Israel and the United States have demanded that the Palestinian
Authority undergo a thorough overhaul, including the security forces.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon said the security forces under Arafat had degenerated into
terrorist organizations.</TE>

<DL>KATMANDU, Nepal</DL>
<LD>Communist rebels attacked a police station in a remote mountain
village today, killing at least 40 policemen and injuring 19 others,
a government minister said.</LD>
<LD>   Seventy officers were stationed at the post in Bhiman village,
about 100 miles southeast of the capital, Katmandu. The remaining 11
officers at the station were believed to be hiding in the nearby
jungle, said Devendra Raj Kadel, deputy home minister.</LD>
<LD>   Officials said reinforcements have been rushed to the site of the
attack, but the rebels have blocked the approach, making it difficult
for security personnel to get there.</LD>
<TE>   The insurgents have been fighting to overthrow Nepal's
constitutional monarchy and to set up a one-party communist republic
since 1996. The rebels say they are inspired by Chinese revolutionary
Mao Tse-tung.</TE>
<TE>   Fighting intensified after the failure of peace talks in October.
The next month, the government imposed a state of emergency, which
expired in August.</TE>

<HD>Istanbul at Risk if Earthquake Strikes Again</HD>
<DH>Turkey: Despite new measures, mayor acknowledges the city
is not prepared. Residents blame government inaction and corruption.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMBERIN ZAMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>ISTANBUL, Turkey</DL>
<LD>With memories still fresh of a 1999 quake that killed about 20,000
people in western Turkey, officials and residents of Istanbul say the
city is not yet prepared for the strong possibility of another major
temblor.</LD>
<LD>   Home to hundreds of ancient churches, palaces and mosques, the
onetime capital of both the Ottoman and Byzantine empires lies on a
major fault line. According to a recent risk assessment financed by
the American Red Cross, there is a 20% chance that a magnitude 7.5
quake will hit Istanbul in the next decade.</LD>
<LD>   In the worst-case scenario, if the government fails to prepare
properly, 50,000 of Istanbul's 10 million people are likely to perish
and about 300,000 buildings will be damaged--perhaps 45,000 of them
beyond repair. Among the structures at risk of being severely damaged
are Istanbul's major hospitals.</LD>
<TE>   "It's an absolute certainty," said Mustafa Erdik, who runs the
Earthquake Research Institute at Istanbul's Bogazici University.
Erdik conducted the recent study. "The next great earthquake will be
centered on the Istanbul metropolitan area."</TE>
<TE>   His views are echoed by other prominent seismologists here. Many
question just how ready Istanbul--Turkey's business and entertainment
capital as well as a prime tourist destination--is to cope.</TE>
<TE>   "I regret having to admit this, but Istanbul still does not have
an earthquake master plan," Istanbul Mayor Ali Mufit Gurtuna
acknowledged at a recent news conference.</TE>
<TE>   Gurtuna said the municipality has drawn up a transportation plan
allowing rescue and medical teams to move rapidly in and around the
city after an earthquake. It has begun work to strengthen the city's
flyovers and viaducts. Istanbul also has a new rapid response system.</TE>
<TE>   "But if a quake were to strike today, it would be an absolute
catastrophe--we are nowhere near ready for it," said Ahmet Mete
Isikara, former head of Istanbul's Kandilli observatory, which
includes the earthquake institute.</TE>
<TE>   Isikara stepped down last month to run for a seat in the
parliament in the Nov. 3 elections. He argued that the government's
failure to address earthquake risks should be a campaign issue.</TE>
<TE>   Shoddy construction material, loose building codes and widespread
corruption among licensing officials were widely blamed for the high
death toll in the 1999 quake, which was centered on the northwestern
city of Izmit but also felt in Istanbul.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew at that very moment, I had to find a new home," recalled
Meral Tamer of the moment when that quake struck.</TE>
<TE>   Like thousands of Istanbul residents, Tamer, a prominent financial
journalist who specializes in consumer rights, is haunted by the
constant fear of the next big one.</TE>
<TE>   "Sadly, we see the same mistakes being repeated," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Tamer has been convicted by Turkish courts of insulting former
President Suleyman Demirel by accusing him of negligence in a series
of articles she wrote in the daily Milliyet following the 1999
earthquake. She has appealed to the European Court of Human Rights.</TE>
<TE>   Erdik confirmed that his team warned Demirel of the danger of a
major earthquake in a 1998 study. On Aug. 17, the third anniversary
of the earthquake, a seven-story building collapsed in Istanbul's
lower middle-class Avcilar neighborhood, sending terrified residents
into the streets.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought it was another earthquake," recalled Mehmet Kuru, an
unemployed youth, as he sipped a glass of tea near the collapsed
structure. The residential building had suffered heavy damage during
the 1999 quake, and been earmarked for demolition.</TE>
<TE>   But residents charged that the building's co-owners had bribed
government officials into designating it as having sustained only
moderate damage, thereby saving it from being demolished.</TE>
<TE>   "The building's collapse was an act of divine justice," said
Mustafa Degirmenci, chief of the municipal district that includes
Avcilar. Degirmenci led the campaign to have the building condemned.
About 900 people died in Avcilar in the 1999 quake. It later emerged
that the neighborhood was partially built on swampland, which
magnified the quake's motion.</TE>
<TE>   Turkey's Disaster Agency says nearly 70% of the 869,500 buildings
constructed in Istanbul after 1980 were built without proper
government oversight, many of them illegally, as millions of rural
Turks flocked to the city in search of a better life. And vote-hungry
politicians typically would hand out licenses for unauthorized
structures before an election.</TE>
<TE>   In Tamer's apartment building, a car dealer cut out some of the
supporting pillars in a ground floor showroom to fit in his fleet of
Hummers. "It's a miracle our building survived without damage," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Tamer said she'd be lucky to sell her apartment for $100,000
today, even though she paid $170,000 for it in the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "Fears of another earthquake have killed the real estate market,"
said Hasan Ekinci, an agent in Istanbul's popular Cihangir
neighborhood. "Foreigners, especially, are leaving in droves."</TE>
<TE>   Ahmet Vefik Alp, a prominent city planner, triggered a drop in the
city's sagging real estate prices by suggesting last month that the
city should be rebuilt from scratch. Alp argued that this would be
far cheaper and safer than reinforcing existing structures.</TE>
<TE>   The safest buildings are those put up after the 1999 quake, which
must adhere to stricter standards. However, they are much more
expensive, and beyond the reach of most Turks. Turkey is grappling
with the effects of its worst recession since World War II.</TE>
<TE>   After three years of house hunting, Tamer and her 23-year-old
daughter finally moved last month to a building on the eastern side
of the Bosporus after experts assured her that it would likely
withstand a big earthquake. "We are lucky," Tamer said of her new
home, which includes a swimming pool and a panoramic view of the
Bosporus, all for $1,000 a month. "But I still do not feel 100%
safe."</TE>

<HD>Scoreless, but Not Pointless</HD>
<DH>Asia: In their first soccer match in 12 years, North and
South Korea play to a 0-0 tie. Dull for fans, perhaps, but a victory
for diplomacy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>The final score could not have been more politically correct.</LD>
<LD>   A rare "friendly" soccer match designed to promote harmony between
old enemies North and South Korea ended in a tie here Saturday night:
0-0.</LD>
<LD>   It hardly made for spectacular sport. This was no World Cup, to be
sure, even though the match was played in the same stadium where this
year's tournament kicked off in May. But Saturday's game was so dull
that much of the crowd of 60,000 dashed for the subway before it was
over.</LD>
<TE>   From the standpoint of diplomacy, however, everybody seemed
immensely relieved. There had been fears that if something went
wrong--if a victory was lopsided or a referee's call hotly
disputed--then the kind of ugly nationalist rivalries that intrude on
soccer games under the best of circumstances could have disastrous
diplomatic consequences.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a nice game. It is about people coming together," said Gus
Hiddink, the Dutchman who coached the South Korean team during the
World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "Just the fact that they are playing is a victory," added
Jean-Jacques Grauhar of the European Chamber of Commerce, one of the
organizers of the event.</TE>
<TE>   Politically, there were tremendous stakes riding on the match, the
first between the North and South Korean teams in 12 years. It was
also the first of a series of symbolic events scheduled in the next
few weeks to promote reconciliation. The others include family
reunions, a reconnecting of severed rail lines and North Korea's
participation in an Asian Games tournament in Pusan, South Korea.
South Korean President Kim Dae Jung, the architect of the "sunshine"
policy toward the North, desperately wants to see progress before his
five-year term ends in February.</TE>
<TE>   Fresh from having made it to the semifinals in the World Cup,
South Korea was heavily favored to win Saturday. Although nobody
would admit to pulling punches, the South Koreans didn't send in most
of the stars who had managed that earlier feat against all odds. In
fact, only six of the 15 players Saturday had been in the World Cup
matches at all.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike during the World Cup, which brought millions of people into
the streets of Seoul, the city decided against setting up
large-screen televisions to broadcast Saturday's game. That decision
was apparently aimed at preventing anti-North Korea protests by
right-wingers or pro-North Korea demonstrations from the left.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the stadium, a handful of veterans marched with a banner
denouncing North Korea, but they were surrounded by hundreds of riot
police intent on keeping the situation firmly under control.</TE>
<TE>   Since the North Korean flag is officially banned in South Korea,
the organizers of the match discouraged South Korean fans from
bringing their own flag into the stadium. The politically correct
flag for the event featured a silhouette of the Korean peninsula on a
pale blue field--the same flag used when the Korean teams marched
together in the Sydney Olympics two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of their customary red T-shirts, South Korean fans were
encouraged to wear pale blue T-shirts emblazoned with such slogans as
"We are one."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the entire business of colors was fraught with diplomatic
sensitivities. For this match, defying what might have been expected,
the South Korean team was dressed in red, leaving the Communist North
Koreans to wear white.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, many fans were confused about what color they
were supposed to wear or what players they were supposed to be
cheering for. Many said they hoped for a draw.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a blue jacket to symbolize my dream for reunification of
the Koreas and red hair for my team," said 17-year-old Chun Ji Young,
a rabid fan of South Korea who wore a bright red wig and sported tiny
soccer balls as earrings. "But tonight the politics of unification
are more important than the game."</TE>
<TE>   Watching with decidedly mixed emotions was Kim Chul Young, 30, an
actor who defected from North Korea last year. He said he was torn
between cheering for the South Koreans and urging on the North
Koreans, some of whom were from his hometown.</TE>
<TE>   "Seeing the North Korean players arriving, I felt sorrow and
sympathy. I felt like I could see exactly what was passing through
their minds coming to South Korea: shock, envy and maybe a sense of
inferiority. I feel sorry for them," Kim said.</TE>
<TE>   Before the 1950-53 Korean War wrenched the peninsula apart, soccer
games between Pyongyang-and Seoul-based teams were an annual event.
North Korea usually won and, at least through the 1960s, was
considered the better team.</TE>
<TE>   The consensus at the end of Saturday's match was that the North
Koreans were still surprisingly strong players, although they have
less experience now in international tournaments because of their
country's diplomatic isolation.</TE>
<TE>   "The North Korean defense was very good. They blocked all our
paths," South Korean player Lee Dong Gook told reporters after the
match. "We have the best team in Asia right now--we went to the
semifinals. But just think if we were unified, how good we would be."</TE>

<HD>Al Qaeda Might Strike U.S. Targets Overseas</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>As the first anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks nears,
there is growing concern among U.S. officials and their allies in
Europe, Asia and Africa that Al Qaeda terrorist cells have regrouped
and are planning large-scale actions against U.S. targets overseas,
authorities said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Those fears have been intensifying for months, based on what some
U.S. officials described as a steady increase in intelligence
"chatter" about pending Al Qaeda activity, particularly in Europe,
and a spate of recent arrests.</LD>
<LD>   And though German authorities say they thwarted a possible Sept.
11 attack on a huge U.S. military base in Heidelberg, U.S. officials
caution that there are indications that other U.S. military
installations, U.S. embassies and even tourist sights frequented by
Americans are now being targeted by organized and well-financed
terrorist cells.</LD>
<TE>   "We've been picking up chatter all summer," said one Justice
Department official.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. law enforcement and intelligence authorities and their
counterparts overseas have received no specific information as to the
time or place of any attacks, the Justice Department official said.
But the concerns about impending terrorist activity--perhaps pegged
to Sept. 11, perhaps not--have come from a variety of trusted
sources, the official said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a lot of very nonspecific information but from what we
consider to be credible sources, as opposed to more specific
information from sources that we would not consider credible," said
the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "It comes from
certain people [being monitored or interrogated] and from certain
intelligence-gathering agencies outside of our own."</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 11, the Justice Department's top counter-terrorism
official, Assistant Atty. Gen. Michael Chertoff, will be in London
for strategy meetings with his counterparts, the official said. And
although those meetings were planned long ago, the official said, the
recent indications of Al Qaeda activity have given Chertoff's trip an
increased sense of urgency.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, a senior State Department official who also
requested anonymity confirmed that U.S. authorities are acutely
concerned about the possibility of imminent attacks against embassies
and other U.S. facilities worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Security at those installations has been enhanced, the State
Department official said, but authorities fear that it might be
insufficient to withstand an attack on the scale of the two truck
bombings of U.S. embassies in Africa in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   In April, suspected Al Qaeda operatives tried something new:
detonating a bomb outside a Tunisian synagogue in a truck filled with
gasoline for added explosive power. Twenty-one people, many of them
German tourists, were killed.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. embassies and other American facilities overseas are
considered "soft targets," in counter-terrorism parlance, because of
the near impossibility of protecting them all. They have been a
source of significant concern for years within the Clinton and Bush
administrations--increasingly so after the embassy bombings in
Tanzania and Kenya, which killed 224 people and injured thousands
more.</TE>
<TE>   Since those attacks, more than a dozen plots to attack U.S.
embassies, military installations and other places where Americans
congregate have been thwarted on several continents.</TE>
<TE>   But as the symbolic date of Sept. 11 draws near, U.S. officials
and their allies have sensed intensifying activity by some of the
thousands of Al Qaeda soldiers believed to be on every continent
where the United States maintains a diplomatic and military presence.
They are able to remain undetected, authorities say, because Al Qaeda
has maintained a well-entrenched network of followers who appear to
be providing fake documents, financing and havens for those plotting
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to those belonging to organized Al Qaeda cells,
authorities say, there are thousands of additional supporters of Al
Qaeda's jihad, or holy war, against the West. U.S. officials say
these individuals also might launch attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "Prior to 9/11, we were extremely concerned about U.S. facilities
in Turkey and elsewhere in Europe as well as on the Arabian
Peninsula," said one Bush administration official familiar with the
long-term counter-terrorism campaign. "They are going after all the
same targets they did before."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, German police arrested a woman with U.S. and German
passports and her Turkish fiance on suspicion of plotting an attack
on the U.S. Army's European headquarters. The authorities do not
believe that the two were affiliated with any terrorist group. But
according to the German magazine Der Spiegel, Astrid Eyzaguirre, who
was employed at a store on the Heidelberg military base, warned a
friend to stay away from the store in the days leading up to Sept.
11.</TE>
<TE>   In Stockholm, authorities arrested a Swede of Tunisian origin on
Aug. 29 on suspicion of planning to hijack and sabotage a
British-bound aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   Two days later, Dutch authorities arrested 12 men on suspicion of
terrorist activity. And in June, authorities in Oman arrested--and
then handed over to Canadian and later U.S. authorities--a suspected
Al Qaeda operative with the code name "Sammy" who was believed to be
one of two masterminds of a plot to attack the U.S. Embassy and other
Western interests in Singapore.</TE>
<TE>   Thwarting an attack against a U.S. embassy or military
installation overseas may well be impossible, given the number of
potential targets, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The senior State Department official said that Al Qaeda soldiers
trained in Afghanistan have made their way to at least 95 countries
in recent months.</TE>
<TE>   A special investigative agency of the United Nations, in a report
to be released this week, warns that potentially thousands of
well-trained and well-financed Al Qaeda members have slipped out of
Afghanistan and are now on the loose.</TE>
<TE>   The cells, according to the U.N. "monitoring group" on Al Qaeda,
"continue to move undetected across international boundaries."</TE>
<TE>   "They have sought shelter and hiding places in neighboring
countries, or to transit these countries in order to reposition
themselves, or to return to their places of origin," the report says.</TE>
<TE>   "There are also reports that Al Qaeda members have sought to enter
Europe using falsified travel documents, traveling via
well-established illegal immigration routes, including those
extending from Central Asia, as well as from Turkey and the Balkans
into the rest of Europe."</TE>
<TE>   Of primary concern to U.S. and European authorities is the fact
that efforts to stop such an influx of terrorists have been largely
unsuccessful.</TE>
<TE>   The U.N. group, for instance, visited a number of border entry
points and checked to determine whether individuals whose names were
on a terrorist watch list "actually appeared in the controlled
persons databases used by border officials."</TE>
<TE>   "This produced mixed results," the report says. "Many of these
[countries] indicated that they were unable to include some of the
names from the list because of the lack of minimum required
identifiers."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. authorities "are right to feel concerned that anything can
happen," said Magnus Ranstorp, a counter-terrorism expert who
consults with several European nations on how to thwart future
attacks. "The thinking [among European authorities] is that there is
a clear and present danger.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course the U.S. embassies, military and diplomatic
installations are primary targets. They are easy targets to hit, and
there is a clear and present danger, particularly on or about Sept.
11," said Ranstorp, director of the Center for the Study of Terrorism
and Political Violence at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland.</TE>
<TE>   In recent days, Britain's Scotland Yard has issued public warnings
about potential attacks on Sept. 11, particularly at U.S. embassies
and other places where American expatriates are planning memorial
ceremonies.</TE>
<TE>   But Ranstorp said law enforcement and intelligence officials in
Europe believe that Al Qaeda and its legions of followers might wait,
figuring that security will be too tight on that day.</TE>
<TE>   "It may be that some loner out there launches attacks to
capitalize on the date ... but it is unlikely that something major
may happen," Ranstorp said. "They are smart. They may let the hype of
Sept. 11 pass and then wait a few weeks and strike again.</TE>
<TE>   "It is true that we have underestimated them, even after 9/11. And
it is certain that they will come back in some shape or form," he
added. "But what form will that take? And when?"</TE>

<LD>Typhoon Sinlaku tore through eastern China, killing nine people and
forcing about 350,000 to evacuate as torrential rains and high winds
battered the area, state media and officials said today.</LD>
<LD>   Three other people were reported missing after the storm hit land
near the city of Wenzhou in Zhejiang province Saturday night, the
official New China News Agency said.</LD>
<LD>   An official in Wenzhou, a large industrial city of 7 million on
the coast, said the storm's impact was still being assessed. He would
not provide details.</LD>
<TE>   There were reports that the storm had toppled homes, uprooted
trees and cut power lines.</TE>
<TE>   The storm had sustained winds of 81 mph, a weather office
spokesman said, offering no additional information.</TE>
<TE>   About 48,000 people working on fish and shellfish farms outside
Wenzhou were moved inside the seawall, the New China News Agency and
China Central Television reported.</TE>
<TE>   Children and elderly residents of Qidu island off Wenzhou, with a
population of 10,000, were evacuated to the mainland in anticipation
of high tides, gales and torrential rains, the reports said.</TE>
<TE>   Other people were evacuated from mountain villages vulnerable to
flash floods and landslides.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities in Wenzhou ordered nearly 6,000 fishing boats to port
and canceled ferry service along the coast, which is dotted with
dozens of islands.</TE>
<TE>   State television showed palm trees shaking violently in the wind
and bridges nearly submerged by high tides. Whitecaps smashed against
jetties and breakwaters.</TE>
<TE>   Soldiers wearing bright-orange life vests over their fatigues
drilled in front of trucks neatly parked in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Taiwan escaped destruction Saturday because the eye of the storm
passed 140 miles northeast of the capital, Taipei, said Lee
Hsiang-yuan, a bureau forecaster.</TE>
<TE>   Two people were lost at sea after their rubber raft flipped over
near the northeastern city of Ilan, and a 26-year-old woman was
presumed dead after being swept away by violent surf near the eastern
city of Hualien.</TE>

<HD>Blair Urges Action on Iraq</HD>
<DH>Summit: Hussein has a weapons program that 'has to be dealt
with,' the British premier says after meeting with Bush to forge a
U.N. approach.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SONNI EFRON and ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Declaring that inaction is no longer an option, President Bush and
British Prime Minister Tony Blair met Saturday at Camp David to
hammer out an allied strategy for persuading the world to join them
in forcing Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to disarm or face a
military strike.</LD>
<LD>   With the leaders of France, Russia and Germany opposing military
action against Iraq--and particularly any strike without United
Nations authorization--Blair insisted that Hussein is amassing
weapons of mass destruction and that the United Nations must act
decisively to stop him.</LD>
<LD>   The international community must learn the lesson of the Sept. 11
attacks, which is that "if there is such a threat, it's better to
confront it and deal with it," Blair told reporters after his
four-hour session with Bush at the presidential retreat in the
western Maryland mountains. "How we deal with it is an open question,
but the one thing that can't be ducked is that the issue has to be
dealt with."</LD>
<TE>   Bush and Blair released no specifics of the case they will make
against Iraq in coming weeks, or of the U.N. resolution that
officials say the allies will introduce soon.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. leadership wants the resolution to include a deadline for
Iraqi disarmament in as little as six months, and an authorization
for use of force if Iraq circumvents U.N. inspections as it has in
the past.</TE>
<TE>   The world community must demonstrate to Hussein the price of not
complying with U.N. resolutions that require "unconditional,
unrestricted access, any time, anywhere" to sites suspected of
developing weapons of mass destruction, Blair said.</TE>
<TE>   Members of Congress, as well as officials from other nations, are
demanding that Bush produce evidence to back up White House
assertions that Iraq is close to developing a nuclear weapon.</TE>
<TE>   In a brief session with reporters before they began their meeting,
Bush and Blair offered no new details to bolster their argument that
Hussein must be stopped before he is capable of nuclear "blackmail"
against the West.</TE>
<TE>   But Blair did refer to recent satellite images showing
construction work since 1999 at several Iraqi sites that U.N.
disarmament inspectors have visited. An official with the
International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna quoted by Associated
Press described the sites as "dual-use" facilities capable of housing
either nuclear or civilian programs.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said that shortly after U.N. inspectors left in 1998, the
atomic energy agency released a report concluding that Iraq was six
months away from producing a nuclear weapon.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what more evidence we need," the president said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, two U.S. officials confirmed late Saturday that in
recent months Iraq has tried to obtain precision metal tubes that
could be used to enrich the uranium needed to make a nuclear bomb.</TE>
<TE>   "The only purpose this material would be used for would be
developing nuclear weapons," an administration official said.</TE>
<TE>   That official confirmed reports by unnamed officials that the U.S.
believes Iraq does not yet have the enriched uranium or plutonium it
would need to make an atomic weapon.</TE>
<TE>   But, the official added, "there continues to be an abundance of
evidence that Saddam Hussein has been relentlessly continuing to
develop weapons of mass destruction that include chemical, biological
and nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them."</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, in the transcript of an
interview to be televised today by the British Broadcasting Corp.,
said the U.S. does not know how close Hussein is to acquiring nuclear
weapons. "You can debate whether it is one year, five years, six
years or nine years; the important point is that they are still
committed to pursuing that technology," Powell said.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq insists that it has no weapons of mass destruction. Its
information minister charged Saturday that Bush is deceiving the
world to conceal his real motive: to control Iraqi oil.</TE>
<TE>   "There are continuous lies," said Mohammed Said Sahaf during a
news conference in Jordan. "We have nothing [to do] with the United
States, but it takes us for an enemy, it wants to control our
country. It's a powerful nation that wants to control the oil in
Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   Bush's meeting with Blair was part of a well-orchestrated
diplomatic campaign, leading up to a scheduled speech by the
president to the United Nations on Thursday to round up a
multilateral coalition against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Despite allies' vocal opposition to attacking Iraq, Bush insisted
that many nations share the U.S. and British view that Hussein poses
a threat that extends beyond his own neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people understand that this man has defied every U.N.
resolution--16 U.N. resolutions he's ignored," Bush said. "A lot of
people understand he holds weapons of mass destruction. A lot of
people understand he has invaded two countries. A lot of people
understand he's gassed his own people. A lot of people understand he
is unstable. So we've got a lot of support."</TE>
<TE>   Blair has signed on to help his American ally--at least for the
first stage of the diplomatic offensive--despite stiff domestic
opposition. A poll of Britons conducted for today's editions of the
Independent newspaper found that even though 55% thought Hussein
posed a threat to world peace, 60% thought Britain should not help
the United States in striking Iraq unless the action has United
Nations backing.</TE>
<TE>   But Blair's part in the diplomatic duet with Bush places him in a
familiar role.</TE>
<TE>   "You'll probably see Blair playing the role of good cop to Bush's
bad cop," said a State Department official who requested anonymity.
"Blair will reach out for support and make it clear that Bush is
prepared to engage militarily if the U.N. doesn't come up with a
workable and acceptable alternative on inspections."</TE>
<TE>   The Bush-Blair talks will be followed by a whirlwind of diplomatic
activity over the next few weeks by both the United States and
Britain. On the world stage and in various talks with his peers in
Asia, Europe and the Americas this fall, Bush will ratchet up the
tough-guy talk about the dangers Iraq represents.</TE>
<TE>   Blair will weigh in with other permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council and the European Union and in the Middle East to
emphasize that Bush means business--and that the only alternative to
war is a toughened and unbreachable weapons inspection regime backed
up by the threat of force.</TE>
<TE>   Blair's comments Saturday indicated that one of the main talking
points will be a reminder of the dangers of inaction in the face of a
known enemy. London and Washington are expected to note that, in
hindsight, a direct chain of events connected Osama bin Laden's 1998
declaration of war against the United States to the Sept. 11 attacks,
which might have been averted if the world had acted in concert
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, given Hussein's attempts to develop chemical, biological
and nuclear weapons, Bush and Blair are likely to ask what government
wants to have to explain four or five years down the road why it
didn't act.</TE>
<TE>   "We owe it to future generations to deal with this problem, and
that's what these discussions are all about," Bush said Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Britain is expected to release a document soon outlining Iraq's
weapons development programs and current capabilities.</TE>
<TE>   Bush was asked Saturday whether he would have sought the
presidency had he known what it would entail, and he drew on the
shock of the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States to explain his
position on Iraq. "I'm a citizen of a country that has had these two
vast oceans protecting us. For all these years, we were safe. People
couldn't come and attack us--so we thought," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no way we could have possibly envisioned that the
battlefield would change. And it has.... That's why Americans must
understand that when a tyrant like Saddam Hussein possesses weapons
of mass destruction, it not only threatens the neighborhood in which
he lives, it not only threatens the region, it can threaten the
United States of America or Great Britain....</TE>
<TE>   "We are in a new kind of war, and we've got to recognize that."</TE>
<TE>   After Bush's speech before the U.N., Powell will stay in New York
to try to muster support for the U.S.-U.K. strategy.</TE>
<TE>   Among the countries on his agenda are the key Persian Gulf nations
in or near Iraq and other neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   But Powell is also scheduled to hold talks with other members of
the so-called Quartet--the United Nations, European Union and
Russia--about the Arab-Israeli crisis.</TE>

<DL>AVARUA, Cook Islands</DL>
<LD>Combating Japan's effort to resume commercial whaling in the South
Seas, island nations and territories across the South Pacific have
begun creating a patchwork of whale sanctuaries to protect the giant
mammals.</LD>
<LD>   During the last year, the Cook Islands, French Polynesia, Papua
New Guinea, Samoa and Niue have banned whaling in their territorial
waters. Environmental activists hope that other nations, such as Fiji
and the Solomon Islands, will follow suit.</LD>
<LD>   In some cases, the sanctuaries are huge. Extending 200 miles from
shore, they comprise the same area as the islands' territorial
waters, known as exclusive economic zones.</LD>
<TE>   French Polynesia's whale sanctuary, for example, is 1.9 million
square miles, more than half the size of the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Although there has been little whaling in the region for decades,
advocates say the sanctuaries will help protect whales if Japan tries
to expand what it calls "scientific" whaling into the South Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   The havens would also provide long-term protection for the animals
should Japan succeed in rolling back the International Whaling
Commission's 16-year-old ban on commercial whaling, sanctuary
advocates say.</TE>
<TE>   "Having declared a whale sanctuary makes it harder for any whaling
country to go in there, and it gives people a sense of pride that
they have done their part to help save the whale," said Mike Donohue,
a New Zealand Conservation Department whale expert and a leading
sanctuary advocate.</TE>
<TE>   The recent sanctuary designations add to the areas of the South
Pacific that have been off limits to whale hunters since Australia,
New Zealand, the United States and Tonga banned whaling in their
territorial waters in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   The Cook Islands, an autonomous territory of New Zealand 3,000
miles south of Hawaii, started the recent wave of whale protection
last September when it declared its 700,000-square-mile exclusive
economic zone a haven for whales.</TE>
<TE>   "We are closely attached to whales," said Cook Islands Environment
Minister Norman George. "We hate them to be hunted and slaughtered.
We just love whales."</TE>
<TE>   Despite their small landmasses, many of the island nations are
spread out over vast distances, and their territorial waters make up
much of the South Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   Altogether, the newly protected region covers 4 million square
miles, an area larger than Europe.</TE>
<TE>   The World Wildlife Fund, which is spearheading the sanctuary
movement, hopes to persuade all Pacific island nations and
territories to ban whaling in their economic zones by 2004.</TE>
<TE>   "It is important to protect the Pacific Ocean, as it is both the
migratory route for whales on their way to their feeding grounds in
the southern oceans and the breeding ground for these great mammals,"
said Dermot O'Gorman of the World Wildlife Fund in Fiji.</TE>
<TE>   There was little whaling in the South Pacific until the whaling
fleets of the United States and other northern nations began hunting
the giant mammals here in the 19th century.</TE>
<TE>   By the 1960s, the great whales of the South Pacific were nearly
wiped out, the vast majority of them killed by fleets from the
Northern Hemisphere.</TE>
<TE>   In 1986, the International Whaling Commission enacted a moratorium
halting the hunting of whales. But the commission still allows
whaling by indigenous hunters for subsistence or cultural purposes.
It also allows Japan to carry out its limited whaling and to kill
more than 400 whales a year. Norway, which rejects the moratorium,
continues to hunt whales commercially.</TE>
<TE>   In the early days of whaling, the kingdom of Tonga was a major
base for U.S. ships. The foreigners taught the natives to hunt the
animals near their islands.</TE>
<TE>   One technique favored by the Tongans was to use a harpoon with a
stick of dynamite attached. The hunters would spear a calf and tether
it to their boat. When the mother came near, a whaler would light the
fuse on the dynamite and harpoon the larger whale.</TE>
<TE>   In 1978, King Taufa'ahau Tupou IV declared an end to whaling in
the kingdom. Since then, whale watching has become one of the
island's biggest tourist attractions.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1990s, the king rejected a proposal by Japan that
Tonga resume whaling under the guise of subsistence hunting in
exchange for increased foreign aid. One Japanese proposal called for
the killing of as many as 150 whales a year.</TE>
<TE>   The International Whaling Commission established whale sanctuaries
in the Indian Ocean in 1979 and in the Southern Ocean, which
encircles Antarctica, in 1994. In 2000, New Zealand and Australia
proposed the creation of a sanctuary covering the South Pacific, but
the proposal was defeated.</TE>
<TE>   The South Pacific whale sanctuary won the support of more than 60%
of the member nations but fell short of the 75% needed for approval.</TE>
<TE>   Whale advocates have been lobbying the Pacific island nations to
declare their own sanctuaries.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's an idea whose time has come," Donohue said. "Japan
has greatly increased its vote in the past four years. If the
moratorium goes, at least we've got our sanctuaries."</TE>

<DL>SANTEE, Calif.</DL>
<LD>As Mike Brooder pulls into the student parking lot outside West Hills
High School, wireless cameras record his face and license
plate--doing the same to every car that follows.</LD>
<LD>   The cameras then track the 17-year-old senior as he walks up a
concrete path, studies his schedule, scratches his chin, waves to
friends and then wanders to class.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly every move Brooder makes--and every move of his 2,300
classmates--is captured and stored in the campus' database.</LD>
<TE>   Following last September's terrorist attacks and years of school
shootings, West Hills High sits on the cutting edge of the emerging
surveillance society.</TE>
<TE>   Each bathroom door is monitored. Sensors that detect the smoke of
a single match send alerts to campus security.</TE>
<TE>   By Christmas, four more cameras will be installed, and hall
monitors will carry wireless computers that can pull up a student's
school picture and class schedule.</TE>
<TE>   School officials are considering whether to expand the SkyWitness
surveillance system by adding facial recognition software that will
allow a computer to filter out who should--and who should not--be on
campus.</TE>
<TE>   Technology, once viewed primarily as a learning tool, is building
a wall of electronic security on campus.</TE>
<TE>   "People are saying they expected this to happen after the
shootings and the terrorists last year," said Brooder, an honor
student who plays on the school baseball team. "Still, it seems a
little overwhelming and extreme."</TE>
<TE>   And perhaps likely to become far more common--not just in schools,
but everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   Schools are among the first to embrace new technology, often
because companies view campuses as perfect testing grounds before
rolling products out to corporate America.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, one of the companies behind West Hills' system,
PacketVideo Corp., predicts that demand for products like SkyWitness
will grow, as people are tracked at factories, office parks,
stadiums--even places such as the Third Street Promenade shopping
district in Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   Companies like the fact that students enjoy fewer constitutional
protections than adults and have lower expectations of privacy than
their parents.</TE>
<TE>   For many students, such surveillance is standard, with cameras at
every bank ATM and many fast-food drive-throughs.</TE>
<TE>   But the desire to protect has led to an erosion of individual
privacy, civil liberties advocates argue.</TE>
<TE>   "Once privacy is gone, you can't get it back," said Dale Kelly
Bankhead, a spokeswoman for the ACLU of San Diego and Imperial
counties. "This is not just about schools, but about a broader social
attitude."</TE>
<TE>   Relying on such high-tech systems is an unusual move for high
schools, but is expected to become a more popular trend in the
post-Sept, 11 world, said Kenneth S. Trump, president and chief
executive of National School Safety and Security Services, a
Cleveland-based consulting firm.</TE>
<TE>   At Tewksbury Memorial High School, about an hour outside Boston,
the push for security has gone so far as to result in a
video-surveillance system that lets both educators--and local
police--watch the hallways.</TE>
<TE>   "Cameras are everywhere someone wants to watch over," Trump said.</TE>
<TE>   The technology at West Hills relies on advanced hardware, but
basic, off-the-shelf technology is already used by both parents and
educators to watch kids.</TE>
<TE>   Software programs can take snapshots of every Web page they visit
and every e-mail they send.</TE>
<TE>   Devices such as AutoWatch can be popped into an automobile and
programmed to record a car's speed, as well as times, dates and the
lengths of time it is driven. Cell-phone bills list the calls a
student makes and receives.</TE>
<TE>   "You might call it control," said Joe Schramm, head of security at
West Hills. "We call it keeping the kids safe."</TE>
<TE>   Tucked into the scrub-brush valley of Santee, West Hills High
appears to be nothing but safe.</TE>
<TE>   The average SAT score is nearly 1100, and 70% of last year's
seniors are attending either a community college or a four-year
institution this fall. But West Hills High has not gone untouched by
fear.</TE>
<TE>   Less than three miles away, Charles "Andy" Williams went on a
shooting rampage last year, killing two students and wounding 13
others at Santana High School.</TE>
<TE>   The community was stunned when nearly two weeks later another
student launched a shooting spree at a different school in the
Grossmont Union High School District.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Hoffman, 18, wounded five people at Granite Hills High
School in El Cajon.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman committed suicide while awaiting trial. Last month
Williams was sentenced to prison for 50 years to life.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the violence, the school district was forced to cut its
budget across the board; the security group lost three of its 10
employees, including two of the staff members who helped patrol the
76-acre West Hills campus.</TE>
<TE>   Hoping to offset the pain of the staff cuts, the district started
to look at technology it already had in place on its campuses and
explore how the tools could be used for security purposes, said Sue
Mangiapane, education global account manager for Cisco Systems Inc.</TE>
<TE>   The San Jose computer giant had been hired to install the core
routers, switches and servers that formed the computer brain to link
campuses with the district's offices and, in turn, to the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, the technology had been designed for instructional use,
such as creating digital lockers where students could store their
electronic art projects.</TE>
<TE>   Then, the focus shifted toward security. At a technology
conference this spring, executives from Cisco and San Diego-based
PacketVideo began discussing the school shootings and tossing around
ideas of how the tragedies could have been avoided.</TE>
<TE>   "Schools aren't a key security market for us," said James Carol,
chairman and co-founder of PacketVideo, a privately owned software
company that creates wireless video networks.</TE>
<TE>   The company, along with Cisco and Sony, donated the equipment and
handled the installation of the $50,000 SkyWitness system.</TE>
<TE>   "This was the right thing to do for a school that's essentially in
our backyard," Carol said.</TE>
<TE>   The project at West Hills also provided the technology companies
with a test lab in which to develop and try out a security system
that the firms will ultimately market to corporate America and
government agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Already, PacketVideo's software is used by cell phone
and technology firms such as NTT DoCoMo in Japan and Siemens AG in
Germany, and tapped for private security projects.</TE>
<TE>   Tech firms such as Microsoft Corp. and Apple Computer Co. have a
long history of donating software and hardware to schools. The
motivation is partly the push to be a corporate good citizen and
partly the desire to influence the consumer habits of future
shoppers.</TE>
<TE>   "If you want to stress-test a technology, particularly a security
system, a school is a good place," said Trump of National School
Safety and Security Services. "Most often, the biggest obstacle a
company must overcome is the issue of cost. If [the technology] is
free, many schools will be open to it."</TE>
<TE>   Aiding the decision is the fact that minors have fewer rights than
adults, said John Pescatore, research director for security at the
industry-consulting firm Gartner.</TE>
<TE>   "If the system gets too intrusive, the school and the technology
companies are likely to get fewer complaints and fewer legal actions
filed over it" than they would elsewhere, Pescatore said. "You can do
things on a school campus that you could never do in an office
building."</TE>
<TE>   Few of the students at West Hills or their parents knew about the
new surveillance system when classes began in late August.</TE>
<TE>   The school's football team, the Wolf Pack, and the campus
cheerleaders had practiced on campus this summer and saw the cameras
being installed.</TE>
<TE>   Rumors flew, as word of the new technology became campus gossip.</TE>
<TE>   Some students, carrying their bar-coded photo identification
cards, grumbled about the digital devices that tracked their every
step.</TE>
<TE>   But most wandered nonchalantly by the wireless cameras, ignoring
the monitoring.</TE>
<TE>   "We're observed all the time," said senior Kimberly Schmidtke, 17.
"It's just that they're now taping us."</TE>
<TE>   That such surveillance would not only be accepted but also
embraced by some teenagers marks a subtle cultural shift over public
monitoring.</TE>
<TE>   A few decades ago, students rallied against having their actions
recorded by authority figures.</TE>
<TE>   But as camera technologies became cheaper and easier to use, they
became far more widely used, said Bankhead of the ACLU.</TE>
<TE>   Digital cameras sit on top of home computers, peek out of mall
ceilings and take snapshots at gas station pumps.</TE>
<TE>   Cities such as Simi Valley have approved grants to pay for cameras
to catch graffiti vandals, and dozens of towns nationwide use cameras
to capture drivers who speed through red lights.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been so incremental, we almost didn't notice such monitoring
of our lives was happening," Bankhead said. "We don't even know it's
there. The more it's there, the more it seems to make sense to
people."</TE>
<TE>   In the first few days of school, only a few parents voiced
complaints--not about the technology itself, but that the district
had not informed them that the system would be put into use.</TE>
<TE>   "For something so significant, it's the district's responsibility
to disclose what they're doing," said Patty Everts, 50, while waiting
Monday to pick up her daughter at West Hills. "We knew there was new
technology on the campus that was being upgraded. Most people assumed
it was for educational purposes, not security."</TE>
<TE>   School officials plan to send a letter out to parents next
month "as soon as we know the full potential of how we are going to use
this technology," said Principal Jim Peabody. "The technology will
help us keep kids safe and keep out people who shouldn't be on this
campus."</TE>
<TE>   But the security system could not have prevented last
year's school rampages, because the shooters were not people who didn't
belong on campus.</TE>
<TE>   Reliance on such technology to attempt the creation of a
protective wall horrifies privacy proponents, who insist that the
West Hills system is not only invasive, but also gives parents and
school officials a false sense of security.</TE>
<TE>   "No one's even asking the question: Is this truly going to make my
child safer?" Bankhead said.</TE>
<TE>   To 66-year-old grandfather Jerry Parli, the answer is moot.
Lingering at the entrance of West Hills, he sat patiently in the hot
August afternoon, waiting to pick up his two granddaughters.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about time they do something like this," he said. "It's a
terrible thing, but it's time to embrace Big Brother."</TE>

<HD>Hahn's Choice Will Affect LAPD and City Profoundly</HD>
<DH>Reform: With L.A.'s image at stake, many expect a new chief
to be committed to change.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN and TINA DAUNT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With 13 candidates vying for the job of running the LAPD, Los
Angeles' political leadership now faces a choice with profound
ramifications for the city and its Police Department, as well as for
Mayor James K. Hahn's political future.</LD>
<LD>   The LAPD's struggles have reverberated throughout the modern
history of the city, altering Los Angeles politics and twice
precipitating catastrophic riots. Over the last 10 years, the LAPD
has had three chiefs, all of whom left under fire.</LD>
<LD>   Now the Police Department is widely viewed as an agency in
disarray, the result of controversies from the Rodney G. King beating
to the Rampart scandal.</LD>
<TE>   Even after a decade in which crime declined in Los Angeles and
across the nation, the LAPD's work force is hemorrhaging. Department
leaders are still trying to adjust to formal oversight by the U.S.
Justice Department, imposed by federal officials unconvinced that the
LAPD could improve itself.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, recent reports by federal overseers say the department
has failed to pass muster in 29 of 58 categories set forth in a
court-approved consent decree. A broad consensus of Police Department
observers--from lawyers who have sued it to Hahn himself--holds that
profound change is needed to restore the LAPD's competence and
reputation.</TE>
<TE>   "My sense from talking to a number of people in and around the
LAPD and reading reports by [the federal monitor] is that the LAPD is
a dispirited and troubled institution," said Merrick Bobb, a
consultant who monitors the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department
and has provided advice to troubled law enforcement agencies across
the country. The LAPD, he added, is "not very actively policing the
city."</TE>
<TE>   Former Mayor Richard Riordan was elected in 1993 largely on the
strength of his promise to rebuild the LAPD. He too believes the
agency is facing a crisis.</TE>
<TE>   The selection of the new chief "is the most important decision
Hahn will ever have to make as mayor," Riordan said. "As the
department goes, so goes the health of the city."</TE>
<TE>   Interviews with many civic leaders suggest that picking a new
chief thrusts Hahn and the rest of the city leadership into
cross-currents of competing interests on other points. Some argue
that radical change is required and that only an outsider can deliver
it. Others see a narrower need for leadership of a proud institution,
which they see as battered over the years but still basically sound.</TE>
<TE>   Race, once a bellwether concern in the search for an LAPD chief,
appears to have receded in the current debate. But other factors have
replaced it, in some ways complicating the hunt.</TE>
<TE>   In the selections of both of the last two chiefs, many outsiders
saw the choices in symbolic terms as much as practical ones, said
Raphael J. Sonenshein, a Cal State Fullerton political scientist and
author of "Politics in Black and White: Race and Power in Los
Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   Willie L. Williams, tapped for the job in 1992, was the first
African American to head the LAPD and the first outsider to become
chief in many years. Bernard C. Parks, who succeeded Williams in
1997, was seen as an antidote to Williams' widely faulted management
style. And many city leaders said they thought it was important to
return to an in-house candidate after Williams' failings were partly
attributed to his unfamiliarity with the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   This time, Sonenshein said: "The city has to sit down and think
about what it wants the chief to actually do, rather than thinking
about the chief as a symbol of the racial and ideological battles of
the city.</TE>
<TE>   "How do you find someone who can earn the confidence of the troops
without being a captive of the troops, challenge the department to
reform, lower the crime rate, recruit and retain officers and gain
the confidence of the community the department serves?" Sonenshein
asked. "In the past, we have been able to get one piece at the
expense of another. Ultimately, what is at play now is finding a
package."</TE>
<TE>   Even those who see the LAPD as fundamentally sound stress the
importance of finding the right candidate this time. Carol Schatz,
president and chief executive officer of the Central City Assn., said
she believes the Police Department is "well run ... essentially very
effective," and the subject of "a lot of unfair shots."</TE>
<TE>   But she said the selection would send an important signal about
Los Angeles' commitment to public safety.</TE>
<TE>   "What I have come to understand as a business leader is that,
without public safety, you have nothing," Schatz said. "Because of
the ups and downs this department has had over the past 10 years, who
is selected ... is critical. It's not only what the chief is doing on
a daily basis, but it's the perception of leadership that is so
important."</TE>
<TE>   Among those most anxiously "waiting in anticipation" are the
LAPD's 9,020 officers, said Mitzi Grasso, president of the Police
Protective League. "The department is improving, but it still has a
long way to go," Grasso said.</TE>
<TE>   Those officers need a charismatic leader because "their self
esteem is down the toilet" after years of being vilified, said Bill
Berger, president of the International Assn. of Chiefs of Police.</TE>
<TE>   James Q. Wilson, a recently retired UCLA professor who is
considered the philosophical godfather of community policing, agreed.
Hahn needs "to pick a chief around whom members of the LAPD can
rally. Morale is terrible, and the crime rate is going up."</TE>
<TE>   With so much at stake, the selection process also has acquired
political implications. The choice principally rests with Hahn, but
the Police Commission, whose members he appointed, is expected to
submit three finalists for his consideration. If Hahn rejects all
three, he can ask the commission for another slate.</TE>
<TE>   After the mayor makes his choice, the votes of a majority of the
City Council will be needed to confirm the nominee. Hahn has
indicated that he hopes to announce his choice by the end of
September.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the selection will involve much of Los Angeles'
elected leadership and will become public just as two sections of the
city--the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood--are poised to decide
whether to break away from the rest of the city.</TE>
<TE>   "With secession in the air, it is especially important that the
new chief understand the diversity of the city and recognize the need
to serve the many communities of Los Angeles," said former Secretary
of State Warren Christopher, the Los Angeles attorney who headed a
commission that urged major reforms in the LAPD after the 1991 King
beating.</TE>
<TE>   But Christopher quickly cautioned that it would be unwise for the
Police Commission or Hahn or the City Council to make its decision
solely with an eye to affecting the secession vote.</TE>
<TE>   Among the 13 finalists who emerged from an original field of 51,
there are 11 men and two women. Four of the finalists are Latino and
one is black. Joe Sanchez, a Latino businessman who served on the
Fire Commission during the administration of Mayor Tom Bradley, said
he thought it was important that a Latino be chosen for the position.
But a vast majority of those interviewed said competence, not
ethnicity, should be the primary consideration in the decision.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to that general point of consensus, opinions diverged
sharply on whether an outsider is needed to implement the sort of
fundamental change that most say is needed in the department.</TE>
<TE>   Of the finalists, eight either work at the LAPD or have spent much
of their careers there, while five come from other departments. Two,
William Bratton, who headed the New York Police Department under
former Mayor Rudy Giuliani, and John Timoney, who worked under
Bratton in New York and then became the head of Philadelphia's Police
Department, are considered strong candidates.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem with the LAPD always has been with its culture," said
Venice attorney Stephen Yagman, who has sued the department for
excessive force dozens of times in the last 20 years. "Cultural
problems always require comprehensive and deep changes, and only an
outsider who is both dedicated to reform and stubborn enough to
achieve it will bring change."</TE>
<TE>   Jaime Regalado, director of the Pat Brown Institute at Cal State
Los Angeles, agreed. "Breaking out of the box is what's needed,"
Regalado said. "It would not be best to pick someone who has been
trained by the culture of resistance [to change] that we've had at
the LAPD."</TE>
<TE>   But a Los Angeles civil rights lawyer, Connie Rice, who also has
been a critic of the department's culture of "blind loyalty," said an
outsider would have a more difficult time because "the LAPD is
aggressively xenophobic."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview last week, Hahn did not disclose whether he is
predisposed to an insider or an outsider. But he said he wants a
break from the past, and he reiterated the four goals he has set for
the LAPD's next chief: lowering the crime rate, reforming the
department, increasing officer morale and strengthening community
policing efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "Doing more of the same is not what I'm interested in," Hahn said.
"We want some creative, innovative approaches. For too many years,
the LAPD has not encouraged innovation. In fact, it has discouraged
it. We have to have someone who is committed to this consent decree
and to police reform."</TE>
<TE>   For the new chief, then, one of the principal challenges will be
to improve the department's crime-fighting abilities, even as it
tightens rules to prevent officer misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, that tension has been highlighted by the 1991
Christopher Commission--which concluded that racism and brutality
were stubbornly persistent within the department--and by the
revelations associated with the Rampart scandal, which resulted in
the resignation or firing of more than a dozen officers, nine
criminal prosecutions so far and more than $100 million in taxpayer
payouts in civil cases.</TE>
<TE>   The next chief will approach those and other issues under the eye
of a federal judge. Los Angeles was forced last year to enter into a
federal consent decree, overseen by a judge, after the U.S.
Department of Justice concluded that the LAPD had been engaging for
years in a "pattern or practice" of civil rights violations.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department has pursued similar cases at other
agencies, but none as big as the LAPD. Under the decree, the
department is obligated to make dozens of reforms aimed at rooting
out corruption and other problems.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to determining the extent of racial profiling by LAPD
officers, the department must also install a computerized system to
track performance evaluations, complaints, disciplinary actions and
other data on officers.</TE>
<TE>   In a just-completed report, Michael Cherkasky, the LAPD's
independent monitor, said the department continues to struggle.
Department efforts to identify problem officers are missing
"significant red flags" because of understaffing and a serious
backlog of uncompleted audits. The report also concluded that:</TE>
<TE>   * The department is failing to analyze data collected on
pedestrian and motor vehicle stops to determine whether the LAPD
engages in "racial profiling."</TE>
<TE>   * Bureaucratic indecision is hampering the department's efforts to
develop a computerized "early warning" system to help track potential
at-risk officers.</TE>
<TE>   * The confidential-informant database contains critical errors
that make it difficult to identify unreliable informants.</TE>
<TE>   Cherkasky, of New York's Kroll Associates, pointedly linked these
problems to a lack of commitment to change in the department.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Cherkasky, a former New York City prosecutor,
said the issues confronting the LAPD make the decision over its chief
a crucial one: "The person who is brought in is going to be asked to
completely change the management of the department, and that is
always a difficult job."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<TE>   The Process and the 13 Candidates</TE>
<TE>   The city began seeking a new chief after the Police Commission
voted in April to deny Bernard C. Parks a second five-year term.</TE>
<TE>   Former Deputy Chief Martin Pomeroy is heading the department
temporarily. Pomeroy, who had retired, has said he plans to return to
his home in Montana, once a new chief is selected.</TE>
<TE>   Under the City Charter, the commission will select its three top
choices and forward the names to Mayor James K. Hahn, who will make
the final decision--subject to City Council approval.</TE>
<TE>   The candidates are: Portland, Ore., Chief Mark Kroeker and Oxnard
Chief Art Lopez, both former LAPD deputy chiefs; LAPD Assistant Chief
David Gascon; LAPD Deputy Chiefs David Kalish and Margaret A. York;
LAPD Cmdrs. George Gascon, James McDonnell and Sharon Papa; Santa Ana
Chief Paul Walters; Sacramento Chief Arturo Venegas; Cambridge,
Mass., Chief Ronnie Watson; former Philadelphia Chief John Timoney;
and former New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn has said he is looking for someone who can lower the crime
rate, reform the department, motivate the rank and file and
strengthen community-policing efforts.</TE>

<HD>Everyone's Talking About the Masters--Except in Augusta</HD>
<DH>Golf: The elite club's penchant for secrecy and a local
membership limit mean the debate over excluding women is left mainly
to outsiders.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEN ELLINGWOOD and THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>AUGUSTA, Ga.</DL>
<LD>Behind a lush barrier of bamboo and pines as impregnable as a
castle's wall, Augusta National Golf Club appears snugly insulated
from the controversy raging around it. While outsiders debate the
club's right to remain an all-male bastion, the only activity visible
within its closed gates is the annual primping that precedes a new
winter season at one of America's most venerated golf courses.</LD>
<LD>   If there is hand-wringing among club officials or its far-flung
membership of 300 corporate titans and statesmen over a recent
dust-up with women's groups, it is for them--and them alone--to know.</LD>
<LD>   William W. "Hootie" Johnson, the club's chairman, has been
tight-lipped since he announced Aug. 30 that Augusta National would
drop corporate sponsorship of its televised Masters tournament to
avoid pressure from a coalition of women's organizations that is
pushing the club to accept female members. The club's rank and
file--if some of America's richest and most powerful men can be
considered such--are likewise staying mum.</LD>
<TE>   Even some local supporters of the 70-year-old club--and there are
many in Augusta, though few residents belong--politely decline to
comment publicly for fear of being dragged into a scrap they say has
little hope of a tidy outcome.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not touching that one," said a female golfer who added that
she has "mixed feelings" about Augusta National's stance. The club
has no rule against female members but argues that as a private club
it reserves the right to decide when it will invite women, if ever.</TE>
<TE>   There is nothing new in this insularity. Since its founding in
1932 by the late golfing great Bobby Jones, a Georgian, and Clifford
Roberts, an Iowan turned New York money man, the club has crafted its
own, often quirky, rules--and enforced them with a martinet's
severity. Club rules govern everything from the members' signature
green jackets (they are not to be worn off-premises) to the overall
comportment of members (one was reportedly booted when it was
discovered he kept two wives).</TE>
<TE>   Among the rules is that members don't discuss club affairs in
public. So while it hosts one of golf's most-watched and revered
tournaments, Augusta National remains as shrouded in secrecy as Skull
and Bones. Even in Augusta, where the Masters generates civic pride
and millions of dollars in commerce each spring, much of what goes on
at Augusta National wafts out merely as rumor. Each summer, the
city's golfing cognoscenti buzz over the club's rumored new invitees.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't talk to us any more than they talk to anyone else,"
said Dennis Sodomka, executive editor of the Augusta Chronicle. The
newspaper's publisher, William S. Morris III, is a club member, but
he leaks nothing to the reporters writing about the Masters a floor
below his office.</TE>
<TE>   Augusta residents have kept out of the brouhaha. The Chronicle
carried Johnson's announcement on the front page, but the story fell
off quickly. Few readers have written letters to the editor--an
indication that many in town don't see the club's membership policies
as any of their business.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just not something that interests anybody. It doesn't affect
anyone here except for a dozen people or so," said Augusta Mayor Bob
Young, who received his only correspondence, an e-mail, about the
matter on Wednesday, five days after the issue flared up. ("Tell
those boys at Augusta National that I am behind them 100%," the
message said.)</TE>
<TE>   Since the club was built on 365 acres of nursery land, it has been
left alone to tend its high-powered membership, which has included
President Eisenhower; former Secretary of State George P. Shultz;
Warren Buffett, chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway; Jack
Welch, the former chairman of General Electric; Sanford Weill, CEO of
Citigroup; Douglas Warner III, former CEO of J.P. Morgan; Robert
Allen, former CEO of AT&amp;T; Kenneth Chenault, chairman and CEO of
American Express; and Lou Gerstner, former chairman of IBM.</TE>
<TE>   Longtime club chairman Roberts presided with an iron fist. He made
concession workers cut holes in their pockets to discourage them from
raiding the till. He summarily dismissed members--and one Masters
golfer--for breaching club decorum. He banned CBS broadcasters when
he didn't like what they said on the air. He demanded flawless
grounds. He held down the costs of attending the Masters (tickets,
known at the club as "badges," go for $125, a fraction of their value
on the open market, while the club's famed pimento cheese sandwich
still costs just $1.25). He also made it clear that opening
membership to blacks and women was out of the question.</TE>
<TE>   In 1977, Roberts shot himself to death on the club's exquisitely
manicured grounds, near the eighth hole. Roberts had ordered that his
body be cremated and the ashes buried or scattered at the club. The
site remains one of the club's mysteries. There have been four
chairmen since, including Johnson, 71, a former South Carolina banker
who took over in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   A cap on the share of local members--said to be 10%--means the
club has been made up mainly of outsiders. Nonetheless, the city's
affection goes beyond the economic benefits brought by the Masters,
which began in 1934. Residents know that without the tournament,
Augusta, population 200,000, would be little more than a spot on the
Savannah River that had outlived its glory years as a cotton-trading
hub and textile manufacturer.</TE>
<TE>   Sagging fortunes and a couple of shopping malls sucked the life
out of downtown, where boarded-up storefronts remain despite a
resurgence aided by new art galleries and eateries. A racially
divided City Council has left municipal government in perpetual
standoff. One of the few bright spots in a flat economy is a thriving
medical industry--hospitals and medical schools--that has helped pay
for homes in tony subdivisions around town. The Masters, though, put
Augusta on the map and keeps it there, year after year. The club also
donates more than $1 million yearly to local charities.</TE>
<TE>   Augusta is a golf-crazy town, with no fewer than 16 courses.
Augusta National's traditionalism appeals to many here. The city of
historic red-brick buildings and broad porches has retained its
Southern manners even while Target and Pep Boys stores sprouted along
its commercial boulevards. History matters here. A cocktail
conversation in Augusta is likely to turn to family lineage, the
depth of your local roots. Mark Darnell, who runs the private West
Lake Country Club, jokes that he has lived in Augusta for 34 years
and still is not yet viewed as a local.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still a small country town," Darnell said. Some residents
expressed pique that the groups challenging Augusta National are from
elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "I am totally for equal rights, but you can't strong-arm people
into accepting you," said Sue Thorstad, an operating-room nurse who
was playing nine holes at a municipal course after work on a recent
afternoon. "If you do, you haven't gained anything."</TE>
<TE>   A former member said it's time to bring women into the club, but
he worried the latest showdown would set back progress. "I kind of
think that if this thing had not happened, that there would be a
woman member. Now that this has come up, it's dealer's choice, isn't
it?" said Samuel B. Casey, a retired executive who left the club in
1995 for health reasons.</TE>
<TE>   The controversy began in June, when Martha Burk, head of the
National Council of Women's Organizations, wrote to Johnson, urging
the club to "open your membership to women now, so that this is not
an issue when the tournament is staged next year." Johnson fired
back, saying the club "will not be bullied, threatened or
intimidated," and would determine its own schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson then announced the decision to forgo commercial television
sponsorship of the Masters in 2003. He said he took the action so the
three sponsors--Citigroup, IBM and Coca-Cola--would be spared from
outside pressure. The move meant the Masters, one of the surest bets
in televised sports, would be aired without commercials. CBS, the
event's main broadcaster for many years, and USA Network are expected
to broadcast for about 12 hours. A source who at one time was
involved in the negotiations with Coca-Cola said that the price under
discussion was $6 million. If Citigroup and IBM had similar
arrangements, the total that Augusta National gave up could be as
much as $18 million.</TE>
<TE>   The debate has brought fresh scrutiny to the practices of private
clubs. The Augusta club began accepting black members in 1990,
following an outcry when Hall Thompson, the owner of Shoal Creek, a
club in Birmingham, Ala., that was to host the PGA championship, said
his club would not accept black members. In the end, Shoal Creek
agreed to admit a black member and the PGA set up guidelines
requiring that host clubs be open to minorities.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson also was a member at Augusta National, which invited as
its first black member Ron Townsend, a TV executive in Washington,
D.C. There are now said to be five or six black members.</TE>
<TE>   Augusta National's defenders note that women long have been
welcome to play as guests. Elaine Parker of Carefree, Ariz., the wife
of Jack Parker, a 40-year member and former executive vice chairman
of General Electric, is as close to being a member as any woman. She
said she plays Augusta yearly and is treated with respect.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure if the case arose that I wanted to play without my
husband, I could," Parker said. "In fact, on one visit, my husband
was hospitalized on a day we had planned to golf with two guests, a
man and a woman. I had no problem getting us on the course."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, other clubs are more exclusionary. Cypress Point Country
Club, on the Monterey Peninsula in California, withdrew as a spot on
the PGA Tour in 1991 because it allowed no minority members. New
Jersey's Pine Valley, like Cypress Point one of the most famous
courses in the United States, is an all-male club; women are not
allowed to play the course. Burning Tree in Maryland is an all-male
club, as is the Plantation in Indio. Illinois' Butler National, the
former site of the Western Open on the PGA Tour, is an all-male club,
and San Francisco Golf Club has no minority members.</TE>
<TE>   The latest controversy has stirred discomfort among many female
golfers, who are showing up to play in increasing numbers around the
country. "This is an issue that women wish would go away, whether at
Augusta National or anywhere else," said Sara Hume, national director
of the Executive Women's Golf Assn., which is not affiliated with
Burk's group.</TE>
<TE>   While the Augusta club has the right to make its own rules, Hume
said, "I can't understand why anyone wouldn't want women as members.
Women are great members and valuable assets."</TE>

<HD>Boeing May Face Strike by Union</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>Boeing Co.'s largest union ended talks with federal mediators Friday
night, blaming the aerospace company for failing to budge on any key
issues in its contract offer.</LD>
<LD>   The machinists' union said it will soon schedule a new vote on the
company's offer from Aug. 27, and will urge members to reject the
proposal and vote to strike.</LD>
<LD>   ''Boeing refused to seriously engage on any of the key issues,''
said Tom Buffenbarger, president of the International Assn. Of
Machinists. ''Our members hold the key and will vote as soon as
practicable on Boeing's final offer.''</LD>
<TE>   The company's largest union represents 25,000 Boeing production
workers in Washington state, Portland, Ore., and Wichita, Kan. Union
members have been working without a contract since Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The announcement Friday night came after the nation's top
mediator, Peter Hurtgen, spent 2 1/2 days talking with union
negotiators in Washington, D.C. and phoning Boeing negotiators in
Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   In the midst of the union's original vote on the contract offer
and possible strike authorization, Hurtgen's office, the Federal
Mediation and Conciliation Service, had asked the two sides to come
to Washington, D.C. Those ballots were sealed by the union's
president and have not been counted.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing officials refused to meet with the union but did meet with
the mediator to explain their offer.</TE>
<TE>   ''We have said all along that we have done everything possible
within reason to put a good offer on the table. We feel we have done
that despite the economic times and we stand behind our offer,''
Boeing spokesman Chuck Cadena said Friday night. ''The vote we hope
[will be] trustworthy, fair and immediate.''</TE>
<TE>   The company's three-year contract offer provides an 8%
ratification bonus, and raises of 2% and 2.5% in the second and third
years.</TE>
<TE>   The company has refused a union proposal to link the level of
employment to airplane deliveries or other business benchmarks, a
critical issue for the union, whose membership has dropped by 25% due
to layoffs in the last year.</TE>

<LD>Hundreds of residents within 10 miles of the Clinton nuclear power

<LD>   The tablets can block the buildup of one type of radiation in the
thyroid gland, but they do not offer protection against other kinds
of radiation.</LD>
<LD>   "The way the world is right now, you never know what's going to

iodide available to the 33 states with nuclear plants; three other
states have distributed pills to those who live in the shadow of
nuclear plants.</TE>

<HD>Bush Demands Bureaucratic Leeway for Security Agency</HD>
<DH>Politics: President wrangles over homeland department's
'flexibility' in combating terrorism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush and Senate Democrats disagreed sharply Saturday about
managing the proposed Homeland Security Department, with Bush saying
he needs the greatest leeway to combat terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   The new Cabinet-level agency "must be able to move people and
resources quickly, without being forced to comply with a thick book
of bureaucratic rules," Bush said in his weekly radio address.</LD>
<LD>   "One essential tool this new department needs is the flexibility
to respond to terrorist threats that can arise or change overnight,"</LD>
<TE>   But Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), responding for his party,
said Bush's concerns were "side issues that ought to be put off for
another day" while the agency begins its work.</TE>
<TE>   They should not "deter us from completing our urgent mission to
protect the American people from terrorism at home," Lieberman said.</TE>
<TE>   "Our proposal and the president's share the same mission, the same
basic structure and the same sharp focus on results," Lieberman said
as he described plans to consolidate 28 agencies into the department.</TE>
<TE>   "But there are some differences," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "For example, our plan gives the new department the ability to
bring together in one place, for the first time, all the information
on possible terrorist threats so we can prevent them," he said. "The
president's proposal instead protects the old bureaucratic barriers
and reinforces the tendency to share too little information, too
late."</TE>
<TE>   As chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee,
Lieberman introduced legislation to create a Homeland Security
Department last October in the immediate aftermath of the attacks in
New York and Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Bush submitted his proposal months later.</TE>
<TE>   But Bush has demanded that the department's leaders have broad
powers to hire, fire, reassign, reward and demote the agency's
estimated 170,000 workers, and to easily transfer money between its
programs.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate version is expected to be debated for at least another
week. It does not include the management tools Bush seeks and limits
the president's ability to waive union bargaining rights in matters
of national security.</TE>
<TE>   The House version, passed last month, is much more to Bush's
liking, and he forcefully made clear his opposition to the Senate
approach.</TE>
<TE>   Bush contended that several other agencies already have the
financial and personnel flexibility he says is crucial to the
proposed new department's success.</TE>
<TE>   Under the Senate bill, he said, firing an employee could take as
much as 18 months and spending money in one place when it was
approved for another would require submitting an entire new budget to
Congress for its approval.</TE>
<TE>   "In this war on terror, this is time we simply do not have," Bush
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Senators need to understand I will not accept a homeland security
bill that puts special interests in Washington ahead of the security
of the American people," he said. "I will not accept a homeland
security bill that ties the hands of this administration or future
administrations in defending our nation against terrorist attacks."</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman said the department should be quickly approved, even if
some details have to be worked out later.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday's one-year anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks, he
said, "we will remember our dead and comfort their survivors."</TE>
<TE>   "But let us also recommit to honoring their memory by doing
everything humanly possible to ensure that the crimes of Sept. 11 can
never be repeated, And, to me, that means creating a strong Homeland
Security Department as soon as possible."</TE>

<HD>Jazz Pioneer's Funeral Sounds a Jubilant Note</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>JOSH GETLIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>New Orleans invaded Harlem and Dixieland jazz filled the streets
Saturday as more than 2,000 people--including recording artists,
former President Bush and passionate fans--celebrated the life of
musical legend Lionel Hampton.</LD>
<LD>   Led by trumpet virtuoso Wynton Marsalis, the memorial services
began with a traditional New Orleans "jazz funeral" procession
outside Harlem's historic Cotton Club. A nine-member band, wailing
"St. James Infirmary Blues" and other dirges, followed close behind
Hampton's white wooden hearse as it was drawn by two horses toward
Manhattan's Riverside Church.</LD>
<LD>   "He represented the highest jazz musicians have to offer, the very
best," said Marsalis, who guided the crowd like a swinging Pied Piper
on a warm, sunny morning. "It is an honor for me to be here and
salute someone who gave us so much."</LD>
<TE>   Hampton, 94, died Aug. 31 after a long illness and left behind a
profound imprint on jazz and political history. He was one of the
first musicians to popularize the vibraphone, and his band became a
training ground for some of the most famous names in jazz, including
Charles Mingus, Dexter Gordon, Wes Montgomery, Joe Williams and
Aretha Franklin.</TE>
<TE>   A friend of presidents from Harry S. Truman to George W. Bush, he
also was one of the first black jazz musicians to perform publicly
with white musicians, helping to integrate what had been a segregated
world in the 1930s.</TE>
<TE>   America could not ignore the passing of such a giant, and friends
"wanted to do something memorable" for his memorial, according to one
organizer. Judging by crowd reactions, they succeeded.</TE>
<TE>   The sight of Hampton's funeral parade winding through Upper
Manhattan astonished many on the streets, and heads kept popping out
of apartment windows to watch the pageantry below. Parents held
children up over their heads on the crowded sidewalks so they could
catch a glimpse of the hearse, the band and the surging crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was important for them to be here," said David Hackle,
pointing to his daughter Oni, 6, and his son Ojani, 2. "There's so
much tradition here, with the funeral parade and Hampton. I've never
seen anything quite like this in New York City."</TE>
<TE>   By midmorning the procession reached the landmark church
overlooking the Hudson River, and the music continued inside.
Marsalis led David Oswald's Gully Low Jazz Band up the center aisle
and blew one final hymn before retreating to the back of the
building.</TE>
<TE>   "We are here to remember and celebrate a true pioneer, a jazz icon
who touched all of our lives," said the Rev. James A. Forbes Jr.
"Lionel Hampton filled our hearts with joy."</TE>
<TE>   One speaker after another recalled Hampton's trailblazing work
with the vibraphone, which many considered a freakish instrument
until he played it in a 1930 Louis Armstrong recording session. The
gifted musician, born in Kentucky, "showed the world that this was
not a minor percussion instrument. It was capable of poetry and
invention," said author Stanley Crouch.</TE>
<TE>   Others recalled Hampton's courage when he and pianist Teddy Wilson
joined Benny Goodman's band in 1936, becoming the first black jazz
musicians to perform publicly with white artists in the United
States. Years later, Hampton said Goodman's quartet "opened the door
for Jackie Robinson coming into major league baseball. The
integration of musicians started a lot of things happening."</TE>
<TE>   Bush, his voice cracking with emotion, recalled Hampton as a close
family friend. "It wasn't easy for Lionel to be a Republican," he
said. "He not only had a knack for musicianship, he had a gift for
relationships."</TE>
<TE>   But it was the music--loud, sometimes ecstatic jazz, gospel and
boogie-woogie--that dominated Hampton's two-hour memorial. Backed by
the Lionel Hampton Orchestra, a parade of jazz greats including
pianist Hank Jones, saxophone player Illinois Jacquet, and trumpeters
Clark Terry, Jon Faddis and Roy Hargrove, swung mightily in tribute
to a man with whom they had all worked.</TE>
<TE>   Jacquet, speaking in a low, gravelly voice, remembered a snowy
night in Chicago when Hampton's band was warming up the crowd and the
bandleader was getting dressed upstairs.</TE>
<TE>   "He was excited, the band was grooving so well, that he ran
onstage without his pants on," Jacquet recalled.</TE>
<TE>   The service ended with "Flying Home," Hampton's most famous
number, and as the band reached a booming climax, mourners jumped out
of their pews and began dancing in the aisles. Minutes later, the
band poured back onto the streets, this time playing jubilant
melodies such as "Down by the Riverside."</TE>
<TE>   "There couldn't have been a better tribute to a man like Hampton,"
marveled Kathy Hunter, a longtime fan who had driven 115 miles from
Montauk, N.Y., with her husband to witness the memorial service.
"There's such joy, such energy--and we didn't even have to go to New
Orleans."</TE>

<HD>In N.H, GOP Is Torn Between 2 Senate Hopefuls</HD>
<DH>Politics: Primary may turn on how voters think incumbent
Bob Smith or Rep. John E. Sununu will fare against Gov. Jeanne
Shaheen in November.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CONCORD, N.H.</DL>
<LD>In a primary election that could help determine which party controls
the U.S. Senate, Republicans here must choose Tuesday between two
candidates so philosophically alike that their hard-fought race has
come down to quibbling over which man is more of a Washington
insider.</LD>
<LD>   As Sen. Bob Smith battles Rep. John E. Sununu, meanwhile, the
Republican National Committee has poured $1 million into TV and radio
ads attacking Jeanne Shaheen, New Hampshire's popular three-term
governor and the sole Democrat in the Senate race.</LD>
<LD>   "This is not a fight for the ideological soul of the party," said
Tom Rath, a Republican National Committee member here. Rather, "it's
a race which I think has made many people up here uncomfortable.
These are two people we respect a great deal, both people who have
served our state with great distinction. It is forcing people to
choose sides, and nobody likes doing that."</LD>
<TE>   With Democrats clinging to control of the Senate by a single vote,
Republicans here have focused on who stands the better chance of
getting elected in November. Two-term incumbent Smith, 61, has
painted himself as a man-of-the-woods conservative in step with a
state whose motto is "Live Free or Die." Sununu, who in three terms
in Congress has proved to be every bit as conservative, insists Smith
is obsolete, and that he can best hold on to New Hampshire's GOP
Senate seat. "I will beat Jeanne Shaheen in November," declared
Sununu, who turns 38 Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Polls suggest he might be right. Placing Smith and Sununu almost
in a dead heat, the Concord Monitor's most recent survey showed Smith
losing to Shaheen in November and Sununu winning--by a single
percentage point. A poll several days later from the University of
New Hampshire gave Sununu a startling 22-point edge over Smith but
did not look at a possible November outcome.</TE>
<TE>   Figures from a University of New Hampshire poll in June, however,
showed Smith and Shaheen virtually tied and Sununu easily defeating
Shaheen--results that have continued to hold, the poll's director
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Preelection polls last year were showing that Bob Smith would
have a difficult time defeating Jeanne Shaheen," said Andy Smith,
director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center (and no
relation to the senator). "So there was an effort to draft Sununu."</TE>
<TE>   Some Republicans still are steamed over the scathing speech Bob
Smith made when he bolted the party briefly in 1999, Andy Smith said.
Though the senator quickly returned to the GOP fold, "quitting the
party has hurt him a lot," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Yet in endorsing Smith, the Concord Monitor hailed his temporary
defection as a badge of independence. "Sununu, by contrast, has
served as another foot soldier for the GOP," the capital city's paper
wrote, "in lock step with the administration."</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Sununu has enjoyed name recognition inherited in
part from his father, John H. Sununu, who served as governor and as
chief of staff to the first President Bush. As an engineer with
degrees from MIT and the Harvard Business School, Sununu also appeals
to many new residents of New England's fastest-growing state:
well-educated professionals drawn to New Hampshire by high-technology
jobs and no state sales tax.</TE>
<TE>   Though Republicans claim a plurality of New Hampshire voters with
36%--against 34% for Independents and 30% for Democrats--"this is not
a conservative Republican state by any means," Andy Smith said. "It
is a moderate to liberal electorate, and Bob Smith is a little out of
step with that electorate."</TE>
<TE>   To change that perception, Bob Smith has outspent his GOP rival, 4
to 1. A passionate campaigner, Smith has worked to counter "the
common misunderstanding that the two candidates are identical on all
the issues," said his campaign manager, Cory Lewandowski.</TE>
<TE>   "If this were the case--which it is not--why would you take the
candidate with 12 years of seniority in the U.S. Senate, ranked No.
41 right now, and replace him with someone who, if elected, would be
No. 100?" Lewandowski asked. Moreover, he continued, "It is very
unusual that a junior congressman would challenge a senior
senator--almost unheard of. While he has a right to do that,
absolutely, the question is: Is it right?"</TE>
<TE>   But for party officials, protocol is less important than the
simple goal of blocking Shaheen.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter who wins on Sept. 10, we are absolutely going to keep
this seat Republican on Nov. 5," said Julie Teer, communication
manager for the Republican state committee in New Hampshire.</TE>
<TE>   For months, the national GOP has run ads blasting Shaheen's
six-year record as governor. Education, the signature issue for the
former teacher, has been a special target of ads blaming Shaheen for
failing to solve the state's school funding crisis. "She vetoed our
children's future," one GOP-sponsored television ad intoned.</TE>
<TE>   At best, Shaheen said, "those ads were totally misleading. At
worst, they were totally false." But she conceded that "certainly
when somebody spends a million dollars to attack you, it has an
effect."</TE>
<TE>   Just what that effect may be is not clear. Mike Campbell, owner of
a hardware store in Hanover, said the nasty tenor of the ads in this
season's Senate race was grating.</TE>
<TE>   "As a voter, I'm really tired of listening to all the negative
ads, and that is all they run," said Campbell, 35, who would not
disclose his party affiliation. "If I bashed another hardware store
owner, people wouldn't like it. That's not how business should be
conducted, and it's not how politics should be conducted.</TE>
<TE>   "These politicians should be staying positive, rather than
pounding the living heck out of each other. But it seems like every
week they keep coming out with harsher and harsher ads."</TE>
<TE>   Shaheen has raised nearly $3 million and has spent about $1.8
million on her campaign. Smith has spent almost $4 million, with more
than $800,000 remaining in his coffer, campaign records show. Sununu
has spent about $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   All three candidates--but especially the two Republicans--are
expected to be helped by what is projected to be a high voter
turnout, generated by a hotly contested gubernatorial race as well as
more than 400 candidates on the GOP side for the state Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   Shaheen also has had the support of such national figures as
Democratic Sens. Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut and John F. Kerry
of Massachusetts, who have stumped for her. Crisscrossing the state
for yet another weekend of campaigning, she was resolute in her
determination to ignore polls.</TE>
<TE>   "The only poll that matters is the one that's taken on election
day," Shaheen said.</TE>
<TE>   In the final hours of "a great race, but a race we'd just as soon
was taking place somewhere else," committee member Rath said the
election could not come a moment too soon.</TE>
<TE>   "All of us," he said, "can't wait to put it behind us."</TE>

<HD>'Everything Has Changed' in N.Y.</HD>
<DH>Recovery: Financial losses are staggering, there's a
growing sense of mortality, and ground zero's future is contested.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH GETLIN and GERALDINE BAUM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Minutes after two planes crashed into the World Trade Center, a
packed subway train crawling into Midtown Manhattan showed how the
city had changed in a heartbeat: Commuters who normally wouldn't look
at each other were hugging emotionally.</LD>
<LD>   A year after the terrorist attacks, those same subway cars are
filled with busy people minding their own business, and the Big Apple
hums with its old manic energy. But New York is not back in the
groove. Sept. 11 profoundly transformed the city, triggering
psychological, political, economic and cultural changes that are only
now beginning to be understood.</LD>
<LD>   Proud New Yorkers got back to work in a hurry after Sept. 11, yet
the economic effect of the attacks has been devastating: More than
100,000 people lost their jobs, and hundreds of shops closed in such
neighborhoods as Chinatown and TriBeCa. Controller William Thompson
estimated last week that the financial loss to New York could total
$95 billion.</LD>
<TE>   Although tourism and culture have rebounded, the city's creative
life is haunted by a growing sense of mortality. New York's grinding
development battles continue, but the biggest planning controversy in
50 years--what to do with 16 acres at ground zero and how to design a
lasting memorial--has focused on spiritual as well as real-estate
values.</TE>
<TE>   "What I tell people is that, outwardly, nothing dramatic here
seems to have changed except for the absence of two very big
buildings downtown," said author and sociologist Todd Gitlin. "But
everything has changed. We're living in a different world now, and
there's no map to describe it."</TE>
<TE>   Much the same could be said about the nation as a whole. Yet New
York--along with Washington, D.C., and Shanksville, Pa.--experienced
the trauma of the attacks more immediately and personally than the
rest of America. Indeed, a majority of New Yorkers view them as the
biggest life-changing event of the last year, compared with 38% of
the rest of Americans, according to a new national poll on attitudes
toward Sept. 11 by the Pew Research Center for the People and the
Press.</TE>
<TE>   "For the vast majority of Americans, the attacks were a terrible
thing they saw on television," said Kenneth Jackson, president of the
New York Historical Society and author of the Encyclopedia of New
York City. "But millions of people in this area saw the towers
burning. They smelled the terrible toxic residue of it for months to
come. It was totally real."</TE>
<TE>   As the anniversary approaches, Americans are immersed in
remembrance and memorials. Yet the grieving here never stopped.
Beyond a giant hole in the sky, Jackson said, "there are many other
wounds that have yet to heal."</TE>
<TE>   The psychological damage from Sept. 11 may be the most lasting.</TE>
<TE>   From the beginning, proximity to the event--how close any New
Yorkers or anyone they knew came to the towers that day--has
determined how it affected them. Thus, 500,000 adults in the New York
area now suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, according to a
study reported in the Aug. 7 issue of the Journal of the American
Medical Assn. And that does not account for the 75,000 New York City
public-school children also suffering from the disorder. More than
two-thirds of them have received no treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Ronnie Hirsh, a Manhattan psychotherapist, has monitored the
mental health of many New Yorkers: their resilience and down-ticks,
their denial and revelations. He has counseled numerous police
officers who saw the falling bodies, and ordinary residents who fled
the rushing billows of dust.</TE>
<TE>   He has also had to walk west every morning to get to his office
from his Greenwich Village apartment and has looked downtown for the
missing towers. Now, at age 52, this New Yorker is determined to
leave, to uproot, to relocate. He and his wife are considering moving
to Virginia Beach, Va., or working overseas. The stock market decline
has foiled any early retirement plans.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a former patient who came back, whose young son was killed
in the towers," Hirsh said. "To lose a child in any circumstance is
extremely devastating. But this was too much.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel more inadequate in this city, and not just professionally.
I don't know what to tell people anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Just how jittery are some New Yorkers?</TE>
<TE>   Matt Roshkow, a screenwriter, and his wife, Helaine Olen, a
journalist, recently bought their 2 1/2-year-old son, Jake, a bunch
of balloons, then stopped for pizza in a Manhattan restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   "Jake let go of the balloons and they hit a ceiling fan. They went
off one by one," Roshkow said. "The young guy in front of us ducked
for cover under the table. There was a kind of jumpiness in the air."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tighter Security</TE>
<TE>   Wariness. Vigilance. Suspicion. These are increasingly common
responses to life here, and security precautions are more visible.
Most high-rise office buildings now screen visitors, asking for ID;
some have installed metal detectors. New York police routinely close
off downtown intersections if suspicious packages are left unattended
on the sidewalk.</TE>
<TE>   The NYPD has strengthened its intelligence divisions--which Police
Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said "in essence was an escort service
for VIPS" before the towers collapsed. It also has sent detectives to
Canada, Israel, England and France to act as liaison with those
nations' intelligence services.</TE>
<TE>   Ordinary residents have also beefed up security. A year after the
attacks, Gary Hugo, owner of the Trader--a store that sells gas
masks, chemical protective garments and other safety equipment--is
doing a thriving business.</TE>
<TE>   "People are very nervous," he said. "They laugh a little bit,
giggle. But it is a nervous giggle when they talk. They remember and
hear all the news and they get worried, really worried. I explain to
everybody--better safe than sorry."</TE>
<TE>   Rachel Winslow, a Midtown office worker, said she always keeps a
full tank of gas in her car for a sudden emergency. "You go about
your business in New York just like before," she said. "But you're
always looking over your shoulder, just in case. Only a fool could
ignore what happened here."</TE>
<TE>   No one could ignore the city's apparent new respect for civility
either. Given the new climate of personal vulnerability, New York's
rough-and-tumble political world has changed. Campaigns are still
hard-fought, but people wounded by terrorism have less appetite for
mean-spirited attacks, veteran observers say.</TE>
<TE>   "Rancor doesn't play well in New York now," said Democratic
consultant Jeff Plaut. "Beating up your political opponents is
traditionally one of this city's favorite intramural sports, yet it's
become less appealing."</TE>
<TE>   The most notorious example is the recently aborted campaign by
former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo for the
Democratic gubernatorial nomination. Last spring, hoping to make
political hay out of the attacks, he accused GOP Gov. George Pataki
of doing little in the aftermath, saying he essentially "held
[then-Mayor Rudolph W.] Giuliani's coat," while Giuliani did all the
hard work.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats and Republicans alike blasted these comments, and Cuomo
never recovered in the polls. Last week, he ended his candidacy.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Surprise Victory</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's surprise election in November was an
early example of how political winds have shifted. Boosted by an
endorsement from Giuliani--whose image soared after the terror
attacks--the little-known Bloomberg stressed his credentials as a
businessman and shunned harsh campaign attacks on his liberal
Democratic opponent, Mark Green.</TE>
<TE>   He has continued this low-key tone in office, avoiding
recriminations against many opponents and refusing to play the
traditional role of a mayor who locks horns with the governor and
Legislature over fiscal issues. Where Giuliani thrived on
confrontation, Bloomberg has brought a quieter, less flamboyant tone
to City Hall that has struck a chord with New Yorkers.</TE>
<TE>   If the political world has quieted somewhat, New York's cultural
life teemed with energy after Sept. 11. The city's artists have
groped for ways to address an attack that changed their lives; some
were paralyzed by the enormity of the event, while others plunged
into a creative frenzy. Many artists here are now wrestling with new
artistic questions: How has this destructive event altered art? And
does death look different now?</TE>
<TE>   For nearly three months after the attacks, artist Donna Levinstone
went to her Upper East Side studio every day and just sat there.
Known for her serene pastel landscapes, she felt tentative and
vulnerable, too raw to return to "pretty pictures," too overwhelmed
to create something new.</TE>
<TE>   One winter day, she started out in a different direction, drawing
clouds of smoke billowing within a frame of silhouetted buildings, as
if witnessing September's disaster from a window in downtown
Manhattan. "Ascending Spirit" was the bleakest landscape Levinstone
had ever done, but there was a defiant, radiant light that emanated
from within the dark clouds.</TE>
<TE>   "There was something very horrible but mystical that so many
people disappeared," she said. "I'm still struggling with 'Is it
going to happen again?' And I still can't believe that it did happen.
I revisit it every time I do a piece."</TE>
<TE>   Ulrich Baer, a New York University literature professor who
compiled "110 Stories," an anthology of writing sparked by the
attacks, said many authors are just beginning to present the opening
lines and initial images of the day and how it will be remembered.</TE>
<TE>   "I was interested in how people would come back to language and
expression," he said. "Ultimately, literature will be one of the main
conduits to grasp this event. It won't only be history and politics.
Literature allows people to address it without having to confront it
immediately."</TE>
<TE>   New York publishers report that a flood of 9/11-related fiction is
in the works, and Baer's literary anthology is one of the first to
emerge. The book, which includes one chapter for each of the World
Trade Center's 110 stories, is an effort "to give memory, tenderness
and meaning to all that howling space," according to novelist and
essayist Don DeLillo.</TE>
<TE>   The author was speaking metaphorically, but an even greater
howling has erupted over the future of the 16 acres where the World
Trade Center once stood. The two towers symbolized America's
financial preeminence, and they anchored Manhattan's world-famous
skyline. But now, as the task of rebuilding begins, a chorus of
discordant voices threatens any consensus.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ground Zero Struggle</TE>
<TE>   In the past, New York's big development battles have typically
pitted neighborhood activists and environmentalists against powerful
real-estate developers. Yet the struggle over ground zero defies such
easy labels, because it is as much about ideas and ethics as dollars
and cents.</TE>
<TE>   Weeks before he left office, Giuliani said the area should be
reserved for a memorial and a museum. The resulting landmark, he said
recently on NBC's "Today" show, "would create its own economic
development," bringing millions each year to the site. "This is a
burial ground; it's hallowed ground," Giuliani said, echoing a
sentiment held by victims' families.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg, however, believes the city's main priority should be to
determine the proper mixture of retail and office space at ground
zero, and to build a memorial. New York needs to revive the area, he
said, and "send a message" to the rest of the world that it has
rebounded.</TE>
<TE>   Victims' families have threatened legal action if the city ignores
their demands for a large memorial, while activists in areas
bordering ground zero complain that they don't want to live next door
to a virtual graveyard. Advocates for each position increasingly
frame their arguments in spiritual terms, which could make it
difficult for the city and state officials overseeing the process to
reach a satisfactory compromise.</TE>
<TE>   It all adds up to a giant headache for the Lower Manhattan
Redevelopment Corp., the lead planning agency, which recently had to
discard six draft proposals for the site after they were greeted with
nearly universal disdain. Few are willing to predict the outcome of
such an unusual debate in New York, but given the new forces at play
after Sept. 11, some residents are not overly worried.</TE>
<TE>   "New Yorkers watched so many people die senselessly a year ago,
and it's forced us to take another look at our lives," Jackson said.
"We've changed, and the city has changed. Hopefully, in the long run,
for the better."</TE>

<HD>Shadow of Sept. 11 Looms Over Closely Contested Primaries</HD>
<DH>Politics: State elections could be affected as the nation
focuses on the anniversary of attacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Some of the nation's most closely watched political races will take
their final shape Tuesday as several states--from Florida to
Arizona--hold the last major round of primaries before the November
election.</LD>
<LD>   One high-profile contest was prematurely decided last week when
Andrew Cuomo, Housing and Urban Development secretary in the Clinton
administration and son of former New York Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, ceded
the state's Democratic gubernatorial nomination to the state
comptroller, H. Carl McCall.</LD>
<LD>   Cuomo was trailing badly in the polls, and his decision solidified
the Democratic bid to unseat Gov. George Pataki, a Republican.</LD>
<TE>   But several other primaries appear headed for tight finishes,
including the closely watched race in Florida for the Democratic
nomination to oppose Gov. Jeb Bush, the president's brother.</TE>
<TE>   One common uncertainty for all the candidates is whether the
intensifying focus on the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks will eclipse their last-minute messages and depress primary
turnout.</TE>
<TE>   At the least, the anniversary is likely to increase the pressure
on get-out-the-vote operations--which could prove critical in several
of these potentially photo-finish contests.</TE>
<TE>   Here's a look at some of Tuesday's top races:</TE>
<TE>   * Florida: The Democratic gubernatorial battle has turned into a
virtual tossup between Tampa attorney Bill McBride and longtime
front-runner Janet Reno, President Clinton's attorney general. Recent
polls show Reno clinging to a slight lead, but all the momentum has
been in the direction of McBride, who has benefited from a wave of
television ads and high-profile endorsements.</TE>
<TE>   Reno remains a hero to much of the Democratic rank and file,
particularly minorities; McBride is counting on more-moderate and
conservative voters. However, he also has substantial union support
that should provide him a turnout advantage potentially decisive in a
close race.</TE>
<TE>   African American state Sen. Daryl Jones lags far behind, but he
could draw crucial votes from Reno.</TE>
<TE>   If McBride triumphs, he may acquire a giant-killer aura that
slingshots him within range of Bush, who has led in the polls all
year. If Reno can manage only a narrow victory, she may be too
weakened to seriously threaten Bush.</TE>
<TE>   * New Hampshire: The state Republican Party has been tearing
itself apart in fierce primary contests for its Senate and
gubernatorial nominations. Republican Sen. Bob Smith, who briefly
left the GOP in 1999 to become an independent, faces an uphill
struggle against Rep. John E. Sununu, the son of former New Hampshire
Gov. John H. Sununu, who also was White House chief of staff during
the first Bush administration.</TE>
<TE>   Smith and the younger Sununu are solid conservatives; the race has
turned more on personal qualities and lingering resentments over
Smith's fleeting exodus from the GOP. Smith has trailed in the polls
all year, although some recent surveys show him narrowing the gap.
Republican insiders still give Sununu an edge. The winner will face
outgoing Democratic Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, who ran about even with both
in a survey released last week.</TE>
<TE>   The GOP gubernatorial primary has been a firefight between
businessman Craig Benson and former Sen. Gordon Humphrey, an activist
conservative who has launched a withering television assault on his
opponent's business record and Republican credentials. The latest
polls show at least a slight edge for Benson.</TE>
<TE>   In a far more decorous affair, Democrats appear poised to nominate
state Sen. Mark Fernald, who's proposing a state income tax to fund
education, for the governorship over Beverly Hollingworth, the party
leader in the state Senate.</TE>
<TE>   * North Carolina: Although there hasn't been any public polling in
weeks, Democratic insiders say businessman Erskine Bowles, White
House chief of staff during part of the Clinton administration,
remains the favorite in a three-way primary for the Democratic Senate
nomination. The other candidates are state Rep. Dan Blue and North
Carolina Secretary of State Elaine Marshall. In the post-Enron
environment, Blue and Marshall have lashed Bowles over his work on
Wall Street. But neither has raised much money, allowing Bowles to
dominate the ad campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth Hanford Dole, a former secretary of Labor and former
president of the American Red Cross, faces little more than token
opposition for the Republican Senate nomination.</TE>
<TE>   Dole has consistently led Bowles in polls, and some Democrats,
after initial optimism, are growing pessimistic about their prospects
of winning the seat that is being given up by Republican Jesse Helms.</TE>
<TE>   * Wisconsin: The race for the state's Democratic gubernatorial
nomination could be one of the evening's closest. State Atty. Gen.
Jim Doyle has led in the polls all year, but the latest surveys show
him in a virtual dead heat with Rep. Thomas M. Barrett and Kathleen
Falk, a county official. Barrett, who represents a Milwaukee district
in Congress, may have the best field operation.</TE>
<TE>   The winner will face Gov. Scott McCallum, who ascended to the top
job last year when former Gov. Tommy G. Thompson joined the Bush
administration as secretary of Health and Human Services.</TE>
<TE>   Polls show all three Democrats competitive with McCallum, who
could be hurt by Libertarian Party candidate Ed Thompson, the former
governor's brother.</TE>
<TE>   * Arizona: Democrat Janet Napolitano, the state attorney general,
and former Rep. Matt Salmon, part of the GOP class of 1994, appear on
track for a November showdown in the governor's race. Both enjoy
substantial leads over their primary challengers in the latest polls.</TE>
<TE>   * Washington, D.C.: After a generally successful first term, Mayor
Anthony A. Williams appeared headed for easy reelection. Then, the
city elections board removed him from the primary ballot after ruling
that most of the signatures on his nominating petitions--which
included names such as British Prime Minister Tony Blair--were
fraudulent.</TE>
<TE>   The reserved, technocratic Williams has mounted a write-in
campaign for the Democratic nomination--virtually tantamount to
election in this overwhelmingly Democratic city. The Rev. Willie
Wilson, a populist backed by former Mayor Marion Barry, also is
waging a write-in campaign.</TE>
<TE>   A Washington Post poll showed Williams far ahead. But with neither
candidate's name on the ballot, nothing about this race seems written
in stone.</TE>

<KH>DISPATCH FROM KAYCEE, WYO.</KH>
<HD>Flood Devastates Town but Can't Corral Cowboy Spirit</HD>
<DH>Rodeo: Locals bounce back less than two weeks after the
tragedy to stage a contest that has become the pride of the
community.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KAYCEE, Wyo.</DL>
<LD>The annual rodeo in this small ranching community concludes this
afternoon, professional cowboys a little sorer after having been
bucked off feisty broncos and townsfolk beaming with pride that they
were able to stage the biggest event of the year.</LD>
<LD>   Just 12 days ago, Kaycee, population 250, was swamped with 4 feet
of water as a flash flood ripped through town, carrying a 19-unit
motel, the town's only grocery store, the Hole in the Wall bar and
nine homes into the middle fork of the Powder River.</LD>
<LD>   Harold Jarrard Park, home to the annual rodeo, was ravaged too.
Situated alongside the river, its fences and corral pipes acted as
strainers, catching all types of flood debris and turning the arena
into a turbulent, muddy lake. Water flooded service buildings,
electrical boxes and the aluminum bleachers.</LD>
<TE>   Emotions flowed in every direction. Friends and neighbors lost
their homes and businesses; the museum, post office, hardware store,
tack shop and another saloon were filled with muck.</TE>
<TE>   Should the rodeo be canceled? It had been held for 15 consecutive
years, named the Deke Latham Memorial PRCA Rodeo after the 1986 car
accident death of one of the town's finest bronc riders.</TE>
<TE>   This was no small decision. The Professional Cowboys Rodeo Assn.
twice has named this the "Best Small Outdoor Rodeo" among 700 such
competitions across the country.</TE>
<TE>   On the professional circuit, cowboys vie for every handful of
prize money to qualify for the world championships in Las Vegas, and
a victory in this small river town could lead to a neon chance at big
money and trophy belt buckles.</TE>
<TE>   Cowboys from Walla Walla, Wash., to Kansas City., Kan., had
already made plans to pull their RVs and horse trailers to Kaycee,
shaded in a grove of cottonwood trees alongside an otherwise barren
interstate highway, 67 miles north of Casper, Wyo.</TE>
<TE>   But when the floodwaters poured into Kaycee just after dawn on
Aug. 27, all residents near the overflowing river could do was flee
for their lives.</TE>
<TE>   Rain, which might have been welcomed in drought-stricken Wyoming,
had been falling for hours. Too much rain. About 4 inches here, and
10 miles away, more than 7 inches fell in about three hours. It
flowed quickly down the rangelands in search of a river, heading
directly for Kaycee. The National Weather Service notified local
authorities, who began the evacuation. Neighbors called one another,
and some ran from door to door, warning one another to get out.</TE>
<TE>   Joyce Black, owner of the Riverside Inn Motel--a prefabricated
building that previously had been used to accommodate highway
construction workers--got the call and looked outside her window.
Water was already lapping at the side of the building. She told her
daughter and two grandchildren to get to the pickup, quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "Within five minutes, the water was 4 feet deep," she said. "As
soon as we put the dogs in a pickup, it started floating." They got
into another vehicle and drove off, looking over their shoulders just
as the motel was washed off its foundation and toppled over.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, Tye and Melissa Curuchet and their three young children
were scrambling too, awakened by a neighbor. The couple led their
three horses into a trailer before they fully realized the scale of
the flooding. "We got the kids into the pickup when the water was up
to our ankles," Tye Curuchet said. "And within 30 seconds, the water
was up to our knees."</TE>
<TE>   Down the street, uranium miner Billy Geis drove his
three-quarter-ton pickup alongside a smaller one, rescuing a stranded
woman. Soon, the water in his own cab was up to their waists. They
crawled out through the windows and waded to high ground.</TE>
<TE>   Such scenes were playing out across the town's small business
district: people running, helping one another, then watching in
stunned and helpless awe. In all, 28 buildings were lost and scores
of vehicles were washed away, some turning up later, embedded in the
banks of the river like flotsam. At least, they said, no one was
injured.</TE>
<TE>   A town meeting was held the following evening, and the question
was raised: What about the rodeo? Its chairman, Ken Graves, already
had decided in his own mind that it would have to be canceled.</TE>
<TE>   But in a town hit hard over the last decade by a withering
oil-drilling industry, the rodeo was the biggest economic boost of
the year, with the bars, motels and small restaurants teeming with
out-of-towners.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know how we could recover," said Gordon Herring, the
town mayor and a trooper with the Wyoming Highway Patrol. "We were
divided among ourselves whether to put on the rodeo."</TE>
<TE>   But talk at the meeting turned to the Wyoming can-do spirit, the
memory of Deke Latham and how some of the nation's finest cowboys had
made plans to come to Kaycee.</TE>
<TE>   "We decided to go ahead with the rodeo and help the town help
itself," Graves said.</TE>
<TE>   Casper city and Johnson County officials already had dispatched
workers, dump trucks, skip loaders and bulldozers to help Kaycee dig
out. Other neighboring towns and counties sent help too. About 200
volunteers from nearby Campbell arrived with nothing more than
shovels. Gov. Jim Geringer deployed National Guardsmen.</TE>
<TE>   Within days, the town had doubled, then tripled in size. The Red
Cross arranged emergency housing for the displaced, and the Southern
Baptist Convention set up mobile kitchens to feed the throngs.</TE>
<TE>   Severely damaged buildings were razed. Rancher Jim Ullery brought
in 160 dump-truck loads of gravel to fill in exposed basements. And
an army of volunteers attacked the rodeo grounds with a vengeance.</TE>
<TE>   The volunteers repaired the electrical boxes, removed huge tree
limbs that were lodged against the calf chute, bolted propane tanks
back to the ground, cleaned the fences of debris and even carried off
part of the Riverside Inn that had washed onto the grounds.</TE>
<TE>   "I was watching all of this activity, and I just bawled," Herring
said. "I couldn't believe all of the support we were receiving. From
as far away as Billings, Mont., people in motor homes were coming,
just to help us pick up debris."</TE>
<TE>   By Friday night, just in time for the weekend rodeo, the work was
completed, and the traditional free community barbecue was staged:
sloppy Joes, potato salad, baked beans and brownies. Last year, folks
donated $400 for the feed. This year, $1,100 was dropped in the
cardboard donation box.</TE>
<TE>   As businesspeople and homeowners were still considering their own
rebuilding plans, the cowboys were arriving as scheduled for bareback
and saddle bronc riding, steer wrestling, bull riding and barrel
racing.</TE>
<TE>   Texan Gary Allen, the world champion steer roper, looked over the
arena in amazement. "If I hadn't seen the flood pictures, I wouldn't
have believed there was one here," he said. "The grounds are in real
good shape. Sandy, dry."</TE>
<TE>   "This town," he said, "likes its cowboys."</TE>
<TE>   Tye Curuchet, his home destroyed, said he would worry later about
building a new place. In the meantime, his family is living with
friends.</TE>
<TE>   "But we proved to ourselves we could hold the rodeo," he said.
"This weekend, there's a sense of starting over."</TE>

<DH>Baseball: Rookie Figgins helps team steal ninth victory in
a row, 4-2 over Orioles in 10.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>Baseball trivia buffs fondly recall Herb Washington, the world-class
sprinter signed by Oakland Athletic owner Charlie Finley as a
designated runner three decades ago. He never picked up a bat or
glove, and yet he appeared in the World Series.</LD>
<LD>   Chone Figgins has won two games for the Angels, without the use of
a bat or glove. That could be reason enough for the Angels to include
him on their playoff roster.</LD>
<LD>   Figgins staged another electrifying baserunning performance in the
10th inning Saturday, manufacturing the winning run as the Angels
extended their winning streak to nine games with a 4-2 victory over
the Baltimore Orioles.</LD>
<TE>   The winning streak is the Angels' longest in four years, two shy
of the club record. The Angels (87-54) are 33 games over .500, this
for a franchise never more than 27 games above .500 before this
season.</TE>
<TE>   And another day without defeat is another day closer to the
Angels' first playoff appearance since 1986. With 21 games to play,
the Angels stay two games behind first-place Oakland in the American
League West, with the Angels and A's starting a four-game series
Monday in Anaheim. The Angels also stay four games ahead of the
Seattle Mariners in the wild-card derby.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels lost a 2-0 lead in the eighth inning, blowing Mickey
Callaway's shutout bid by making two errors that led to two unearned
runs. They had one out in the 10th inning when Troy Glaus walked and
Figgins ran for him. In his major league debut two weeks ago in
Boston, Figgins went from first to third on a single to left field
and scored the winning run on a squeeze.</TE>
<TE>   This time, with the score tied 2-2, Figgins stole second,
outrunning a strong throw from Baltimore catcher Geronimo Gil.</TE>
<TE>   "He can fly," Baltimore Manager Mike Hargrove said. "Everybody in
the ballpark knew he was going to run, and Gil made a tremendous
throw. But, my God, he is fast."</TE>
<TE>   Tim Salmon then singled to left field, where Larry Bigbie got to
the ball about the time Figgins got to third base. Surely he could
not make it home on the play.</TE>
<TE>   But there was third base coach Ron Roenicke waving frantically,
and there was Figgins speeding home.</TE>
<TE>   "We were all sending him from the dugout," shortstop David
Eckstein said.</TE>
<TE>   Figgins made it, giving the Angels a 3-2 lead. Adam Kennedy
doubled home an insurance run, and the Orioles were left to wonder
what went wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "A walk shouldn't hurt," Angel infielder Scott Spiezio said. "All
of a sudden, he's on second base with a steal, and he scores pretty
easily on a one-bouncer to the outfield."</TE>
<TE>   That extra dimension--the ability to run nothing into
something--could be invaluable in the playoffs, when runs are at a
premium. The Angels don't figure to need 11 or 12 pitchers in a
playoff series. As a pinch-runner, Figgins could fill one of those
spots and make the postseason roster as a rookie.</TE>
<TE>   "That would be a very special moment," he said. "That's a
childhood dream. That's what everybody thinks about when they're
playing on a Little League field."</TE>
<TE>   This is not simply about pure speed. In the 1974 World Series, the
Dodgers neutralized Washington because he was a sprinter and not a
ballplayer.</TE>
<TE>   The A's sent him in to run for Joe Rudi in the ninth inning,
representing the tying run, and Mike Marshall picked him off.</TE>
<TE>   Washington could run, but he could not read a pickoff move.
Figgins can do both, not a track star posing as a baseball player but
a career ballplayer who runs the bases with speed and guts and
smarts.</TE>
<TE>   When Figgins ran for Glaus on Saturday, Manager Mike Scioscia
trusted him enough to let him pick the pitch to steal.</TE>
<TE>   And Figgins was experienced enough to judge that Salmon's fly ball
would drop, allowing him to get enough of a jump off second base that
he didn't consider stopping at third.</TE>
<TE>   "Unless it's a rocket hit right to the guy, I'm going to score 99%
of the time," Figgins said.</TE>
<TE>   Roenicke said the Angels would "absolutely" consider Figgins for a
potential playoff roster.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a valuable guy," Roenicke said. "He's already helped us win
two games, and he hasn't really played."</TE>

<LD>If it's September and your team features two rookies in its starting
rotation, that team is almost certainly playing for next year. This
September, the Angels are rolling toward the playoffs with a rotation
that includes rookies John Lackey and Mickey Callaway.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels have won all three of Callaway's starts, including
Saturday's 4-2 victory over the Baltimore Orioles. They have won 10
of 14 games started by Lackey, and the two rookies have combined for
a 3.06 earned-run average.</LD>
<LD>   Angel pitching coach Bud Black played for the Kansas City Royals
in 1984, when talented rookies Bret Saberhagen and Mark Gubicza
arrived in the major leagues. The Royals advanced to the playoffs
that year and won the World Series championship in 1985.</LD>
<TE>   Black isn't about to compare talent just yet, but he sees the same
composure in the Angel rookies that he did in Saberhagen and Gubicza,
the same ability to take a deep breath rather than yield to pressure
and adrenaline.</TE>
<TE>   "It's their makeup," Black said. "They've got good heads on their
shoulders."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In a pregame meeting with Black and Manager Mike Scioscia, Aaron
Sele reiterated his desire to pitch again in the regular season.
Sele, diagnosed with a partially torn rotator cuff Aug. 21, is
scheduled to throw off a mound Monday, for the first time since
doctors detected his injury.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels aren't counting on him to return this year. But, in a
best-case scenario, he could return in two weeks and pitch a few
innings before season's end.</TE>
<TE>   "If all I can do is get one batter out, I'll do that," Sele said.</TE>

<HD>Mulder Mows Down Minnesota</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Left-hander strikes out 10 in eight shutout
innings to lead the Athletics to a 2-0 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Mark Mulder pitched well enough to get Oakland back on the winning
track.</LD>
<LD>   Mulder pitched eight shutout innings Saturday night, outshining
Minnesota's Joe Mays and leading the Athletics to a 2-0 victory over
the Twins, a night after Oakland's American League-record 20-game
winning streak ended.</LD>
<LD>   "The kid really can pitch," Minnesota Manager Ron Gardenhire said.
"He bears down, and he gets after you."</LD>
<TE>   David Justice and Scott Hatteberg drove in runs for Oakland, which
had the majors' longest winning streak in 67 years end with a 6-0
loss to Minnesota on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   But Mulder (17-7) struck out 10, won his fourth consecutive start
and silenced the Metrodome crowd of 43,628 to put the A's back in the
victory column. Five of the Twins' seven hits against Mulder were
infield singles, and he didn't walk anybody. He struck out five of
the first six batters.</TE>
<TE>   "Coming off the loss, I'm sure he was a little extra pumped up
tonight," said Minnesota's Dustan Mohr, who was 0 for 3. "There's not
a whole lot you can do. He had four pitches working."</TE>
<TE>   Billy Koch pitched a perfect ninth for his 38th save in 44 chances
to keep the Angels from gaining any ground. Even with the 20
consecutive victories, the A's are only two games ahead of the
Angels, who have won nine in a row.</TE>
<TE>   The Twins are much safer in first. Chicago's loss to Cleveland
reduced Minnesota's magic number for clinching the AL Central to
seven and kept the division lead at 14 games.</TE>
<TE>   Mays (3-6) pitched almost as well as Mulder, but he gave up
run-scoring singles to Justice in the second and Hatteberg in the
eighth inning. Mays gave up five hits in 7 1/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   "Classic pitching performance," Gardenhire said. "We had the
chances to get some runs, but we just couldn't get that big hit."</TE>
<TE>   Luis Rivas singled and Jacque Jones doubled in the third--the only
hard-hit balls Mulder gave up--but Cristian Guzman struck out to end
the inning. The Twins loaded the bases on infield hits in the fifth,
but Guzman couldn't beat out his chopper to short.</TE>
<TE>   "Just an outstanding performance," Manager Art Howe said of his
left-hander. "Overpowering at times. We were able to scratch a couple
runs across, and he made it stand up. He was really sharp--you could
see that from the outset."</TE>

<HD>Judgment Calls for Russell</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>He was watching the pennant race Saturday from a field-level seat at
Dodger Stadium. Actually, he was focused on how the four umpires were
handling themselves as part of his job as a major league umpire
observer.</LD>
<LD>   This has been the first summer since 1966, when he signed with the
Dodgers out of Pittsburg, Kan., and ultimately appeared in more games
than any player since the move from Brooklyn, that he has been out of
uniform.</LD>
<LD>   At 54, however, Bill Russell retains much of the impassive
personality that he brought to the Dodgers as an 18-year-old, and if
he is hurt or frustrated to be so close to a familiar diamond, so
close to the action without being part of it, he isn't going to show
it or say it.</LD>
<TE>   If, indeed, it seems a shame that the Dodgers--with whom he spent
32 years as player, coach and manager, an anchor at shortstop in an
ironman infield that included Steve Garvey, Davey Lopes and Ron
Cey--were among several organizations that couldn't find a position
for him when they were contacted during the off-season, he will leave
that, too, for others to say.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to be in uniform," Russell said from his seat behind
home plate. "I'd be happy to return to the Dodgers. But I'm enjoying
what I'm doing. It's kept me involved, given me a different
perspective."</TE>
<TE>   Coupled with general manager Fred Claire and fired as Dodger
manager in a Midnight Massacre on June 21, 1998, Russell managed
Tampa Bay's double-A team in Orlando, Fla., to a league title in
1999, served as the Devil Rays' bench coach under Larry Rothschild in
2000 and managed San Francisco's double-A team in Shreveport, La.,
last year before suspected budget cutbacks prompted San Francisco to
go in a younger and less expensive direction with their farm staff
this year.</TE>
<TE>   Russell was left in a surprisingly unresponsive job market during
the winter and ultimately responded to a USA Today article outlining
how baseball, as part of a new concept agreed to with the new
umpires' union, was seeking former players and others to serve as
observers--the goal being to help improve the overall umpiring.</TE>
<TE>   Because Russell and his wife, Susan, live in Glendale, a short hop
to Dodger Stadium and only a few SigAlerts from Edison Field, Russell
felt there was nothing to lose.</TE>
<TE>   While continuing to moonlight in promotion and development for
Rich and Jeff Odekirk's expanding Big League Dreams Sports Parks,
Russell has been one of 13 national observers, attending just about
every Dodger and Angel game and filing reports at the end of each
series. He doesn't deal with the umpires directly, nor does he focus
on ball-and-strike work. His observations deal more with positioning,
hustle and how the umpires keep the game moving. He also watches
replays and interprets missed calls.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always had good rapport and respect for the umpires, and now
even more so," Russell said. "I mean, if you only watch ESPN, you're
going to see the occasional bad call over and over, but it's a small
percentage. I've had the opportunity to take a closer look this year,
and they're right far more than they're wrong. It just shows, from
what I've seen, how good a job they do and how important they are."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Russell is being a bit diplomatic in case he manages at the
major league level again.</TE>
<TE>   After 10 years as a Dodger coach, the last 2 1/2 as Tom Lasorda's
bench coach, Russell was named interim manager on July 9, 1996, when
a heart attack sidelined Lasorda, whose health remained an issue at
the end of the season. The Dodgers went 49-37 under Russell that
year, reaching the playoffs as a wild card, and gave Russell a
two-year contract.</TE>
<TE>   However, the failure to hold a mid-September lead in 1997 tended
to overshadow an 88-74 record, and the immediate expectations of the
club's new ownership, coupled with the Mike Piazza trade that created
a roster upheaval and cost Russell his most consistent power hitter,
led to his firing with a 36-38 record in June of '98.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I had done a good job, but it's part of the game to be
fired," Russell said. "We weren't that far out of it, but you had new
ownership wanting its own identity, own people, and Fred and I
weren't part of the plan.</TE>
<TE>   "It's their team, I can respect that. I might have been hurt at
the time and still don't think it was justified, but I have no
animosity or hard feelings. As I said, I'd love to come back."</TE>
<TE>   Sources close to the situation think Russell will eventually
return to a teaching position within the Dodger system, possibly next
year.</TE>
<TE>   A stumbling block, they insist, has been Lasorda.</TE>
<TE>   Despite their long and close relationship, the sources say that
Lasorda, still a senior vice president with the club, believes
Russell was too eager to take the managerial reins while Lasorda's
status was in doubt because of his 1996 heart attack, and
subsequently did not make him feel welcome in the clubhouse after
Russell had been given the permanent position in '97.</TE>
<TE>   It is noteworthy that at his Hall of Fame induction that year,
Lasorda was asked whom he would select to manage his own team and
answered Bobby Valentine, a clear shot at Russell, who would not
comment on any of this as he watched Houston defeat the Dodgers, 6-1,
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   He did, however, salute Jim Tracy and Mike Scioscia for keeping
the Dodgers and Angels "focused and moving in the right direction"
this year. On a team lacking a regular player hitting .300, the
Dodgers "have done a great job of picking each other up, and the
pitching and defense, in particular, have generally been very good,"
he said. "Of course, the pitchers can be a little more relaxed
knowing they have an Eric Gagne or Troy Percival sitting in the
bullpen."</TE>
<TE>   Russell's seat among the paying patrons hasn't been his customary
one this year.</TE>
<TE>   The umpires may be better for it, but couldn't 36 years of
experience prove more beneficial to the organization with which he
spent 32 of those years, or another not influenced by petty
perspectives?</TE>

<HD>Problems of Expos Not Eliminated</HD>

<LD>Commissioner Bud Selig denies this, but it may be that he and the
other owners had no idea how they would handle the Montreal Expos'
future when they agreed, as part of the new labor contract, not to
eliminate any teams through 2006.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, the idea of eliminating teams was already in limbo
because scheduling imperatives require two teams to be folded, and
the Minnesota Twins were assured of remaining in business in the Twin
Cities through 2003 thanks to legal challenges.</LD>
<LD>   Now, however, contraction is definitely dead through the life of
the new labor deal and Selig can't suddenly lump the Expos with the
Florida Marlins or Tampa Bay Devil Rays, although that should have
been the contraction parlay from the start--if part of the whole
scenario hadn't been to get Carl Pohlad a new ballpark and/or a buyer
in the Twin Cities. Neither is a reality yet.</LD>
<TE>   As for the Expos, Selig insists there are "a lot of scenarios" on
the table and they will be dissected "over the next 30 to 60 days."
That's interesting, because a) if there are a lot of scenarios on the
table it's hard to figure out what they are beyond moving the Expos
to Washington or Northern Virginia or allowing them to play another
lame-duck season in Montreal, and b) that 30-to 60-day window could
delay a decision until November, which complicates 2003 preparations
no matter where the Expos end up playing next year.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Tavares, the former Angel president who agreed to shepherd
the Expos through the adversity of a final season in Montreal and
joined with General Manager Omar Minaya in making a surprisingly
aggressive bid to get the Expos the help they needed to reach the
playoffs, came out of Thursday's owners' meeting saying he was
hopeful of getting a definitive answer regarding the club's status
within 10 days but had no clue what it would be.</TE>
<TE>   "If my life depended on knowing where the Expos will play next
year, I'd be dead," Tavares said.</TE>
<TE>   The best guess is that the Expos, whose Montreal stadium lease
expired Sept. 1, will be moved to Washington despite baseball's two
previous failures there.</TE>
<TE>   In the equivalent of an emergency situation, there are two
positives: a stadium (as bad as it is for baseball) and two groups
interested in buying the team.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Selig has already identified Washington as the best
bet for relocation, dampening the already unrealistic hopes of Las
Vegas, Portland, Ore., and Charlotte, N.C., and there is no desire
among the owners to keep throwing good money after bad in Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   It's estimated that the Expos will lose a minimum of $45 million
this year, with each of the other owners responsible for covering
1/29th of that, and there is no support for continuing to drain the
central fund or to invest next year's increased revenue sharing in a
hopeless situation.</TE>
<TE>   With all of that, however, there are problems to relocating.</TE>
<TE>   The suit brought by 14 former minority partners of the Expos
against Selig and former Montreal owner Jeffrey Loria for mail and
wire fraud under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
Act of 1970 threatens baseball with a temporary restraining order if
there's any attempt to move the team.</TE>
<TE>   And Baltimore Oriole owner Peter Angelos has reiterated that he
will oppose any attempt to move a team into his attendance area.</TE>
<TE>   Angelos, a member of management's bargaining committee during the
labor talks, told the Baltimore Sun that he received no assurance
from Selig that the Expos would not be relocated to Washington or
Northern Virginia, but he is relying on "common sense" to keep a
second franchise from diluting the market.</TE>
<TE>   How will it play out? The best advice is to follow the money.
Everyone should come out of this a little richer.</TE>
<TE>   For example, baseball bought out Loria for $120 million and can be
expected to sell to a Washington group for, perhaps, twice
that--maybe more if there's competition.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, if baseball fails to get the courts to dismiss the
RICO suit, the next step would be to satisfy the minority partners
financially through an out-of-court settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Some legal experts doubt that the partners can get a restraining
order or even have the basis of a suit under RICO, but baseball has
no desire to risk its antitrust exemption by handing over hundreds of
confidential documents in a prolonged trial.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Angelos could be the largest obstacle, but whether his
opposition alone can prevent relocation is doubtful, particularly
when he, too, figures to receive an indemnification package that
might compensate for lost attendance and broadcasting revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Dusty's Future</TE>
<TE>   Much like the Expos, Dusty Baker is unclear about his status
because his contract has expired and he has received no assurances
from ownership, which put "can't-lose" pressure on Baker and his San
Francisco Giants in spring training.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to believe that management would dismiss all the
overachieving the Giants have done under Baker by dismissing him if
they failed to reach the playoffs, but Baker might be tiring of
basically operating, in a large measure, with mirrors, of dealing
with the divergent personalities of Barry Bonds and Jeff Kent, and of
the nit-picking of fans and media--especially if he is convinced that
the Chicago Cubs, with a promising array of young talent, are
interested.</TE>
<TE>   The latest furor among fans and the media stems from his perceived
overuse of closer Robb Nen, particularly in nonsave situations. Nen
has been struggling, but Baker said, "Who else am I supposed to close
these games with? During the pennant stretch, you've got to
overextend guys. At this point, everybody is overextended. If Nen
hadn't blown any saves, nobody would be saying anything."</TE>
<TE>   Neither Baker nor the Giants are saying anything about his future.
Does that silence speak volumes?</TE>

<LD>Benito Santiago hit a game-winning single and the San Francisco
Giants defeated the Arizona Diamondbacks in the bottom of the ninth
inning for the second consecutive game, 4-3, Saturday.</LD>

<HD>Oklahoma Wins Wild One</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first game between Oklahoma and Alabama since 1970 proved to be
worth the wait.</LD>
<LD>   Capping a wild second half when Alabama rally from a
three-touchdown deficit, second-ranked Oklahoma scored two touchdowns
in the final three minutes to win, 37-27, Saturday at Norman, Okla.</LD>
<LD>   Kejuan Jones' eight-yard run with 2:11 remaining capped an 80-yard
drive that gave the Sooners a 30-27 lead. With 24 seconds left,
safety Eric Bassey picked up a fumble and returned it 45 yards for
the clinching score.</LD>
<TE>   It was only the third meeting between schools that have combined
for 13 national titles--Oklahoma has seven, Alabama six--and the
first in the regular season. They had previously played in the 1963
Orange Bowl and the 1970 Astro Bluebonnet Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma (2-0) seemed to have control after taking a 23-3 halftime
lead, but Alabama (1-1) stormed back in the second half. The Crimson
Tide tied it with 10:16 left on a fake field goal at the 3-yard line,
with holder Lane Bearden running for the touchdown. Michael Ziife's
extra point made it 24-23.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma lost quarterback Jason White late in the first quarter
when he tore a ligament in his right knee.</TE>
<TE>   White was replaced by Nate Hybl, who started 11 games last season.
Hybl threw for 162 yards and a touchdown in the first half, and also
scored from on a one-yard run. But he was sacked six times in the
second half.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma tailback Quentin Griffin, who had 237 yards rushing last
week, was held to nine yards in nine carries.</TE>
<TE>   No. 9 Nebraska 44, Utah State 13--Quarterback Jammal Lord threw
two touchdown passes and ran for two scores for the Cornhuskers (3-0)
at Lincoln, Neb. Utah State is 0-2.</TE>
<TE>   No. 20 Texas A&amp;M 14, Pittsburgh 12--At Pittsburgh, the Aggies
(2-0) needed two long completions to Terrence Murphy to set up short
touchdown runs by Derek Farmer. Pittsburgh is 1-1.</TE>
<TE>   Texas Tech 24, Southern Methodist 14--Quarterback Kliff Kingsbury
bounced back from a brief first-half benching to lead two long
fourth-quarter touchdown drives for the Red Raiders at Dallas.
Kingsbury was 32 for 49 for 369 yards and three touchdowns. SMU is
0-2.</TE>
<TE>   Missouri 41, Ball State 6--Quarterback Brad Smith ran for 105
yards, including a 39-yard touchdown scramble, and threw for another
score for the Tigers (2-0) at Columbia, Mo. Ball State is 0-1.</TE>
<TE>   Iowa State 58, Tennessee Tech 6--Seneca Wallace threw three
touchdown passes and Hiawatha Rutland ran for 138 yards for the
Cyclones (2-1) at Ames, Iowa. It was the most points for Iowa State
since a 64-9 victory over Indiana State in 1986. Division I-AA
Tennessee Tech is 0-2.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas State 68, Louisiana Monroe 0--Marc Dunn threw three
touchdown passes and Terence Newman scored on offense and special
teams for the Wildcats (2-0) at Manhattan, Kan. Louisiana Monroe
(0-2) lost 62-7 at Kansas State in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Baylor 50, Samford 12--Sophomore Jonathan Golden scored a
school-record six touchdowns at Waco, Texas as the Bears (1-1)
bounced back from a 48-point loss to California. Division I-AA
Samford is 1-1.</TE>
<TE>   Nevada Las Vegas 31, Kansas 20--Quarterback Jason Thomas ran for
two touchdowns for the Rebels (1-1) at Las Vegas. Kansas is 0-2.</TE>

<HD>Michigan State Gets Message</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A few choice words from Coach Bobby Williams at halftime seemed to
spark Michigan State on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   After a lackluster first half, the 15th-ranked Spartans scored 17
points off four second-half turnovers in a 27-10 victory over Rice at
East Lansing, Mich.</LD>
<LD>   "He really got after us, and we deserved it," quarterback Jeff
Smoker said of Williams' angry halftime talk. "I can't tell you
exactly what he said, but in a roundabout way, he told us that we
were losing to a team that wasn't better than us."</LD>
<TE>   Smoker and wide receiver Charles Rogers again had big games for
the Spartans (2-0).</TE>
<TE>   Rogers caught nine passes for 155 yards and two touchdowns, and
Smoker completed 16 of 26 passes for 213 yards and three scores.</TE>
<TE>   No. 7 Michigan 35, Western Michigan 12--John Navarre threw two of
his career-high four touchdown passes to Braylon Edwards as the
Wolverines (2-0) defeated the Broncos (1-1) at Ann Arbor, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Perry ran for 118 yards despite not playing after the first
drive of the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Navarre was 14 for 23 for 174 yards with one interception and
Edwards caught four passes for 93 yards and two touchdowns and has
emerged as the go-to target the Wolverines were looking for to
replace Marquise Walker, who set Michigan single-season and career
receiving records last season, and is now playing in the NFL for
Tampa Bay.</TE>
<TE>   No. 8 Ohio State 51, Kent State 17--Maurice Clarett scored twice
and Craig Krenzel completed his first 11 passes as the Buckeyes (2-0)
defeated the Golden Flashes (1-1) at Columbus, Ohio, in the first
meeting between the schools.</TE>
<TE>   Clarett recorded one of the biggest rushing debuts ever for an
Ohio State freshman two weeks ago, totaling 175 yards and three
touchdowns in the Buckeyes' 45-21 victory over Texas Tech in the
Pigskin Classic. Against Kent State, he had only 64 yards in 12
carries and lost one fumble.</TE>
<TE>   Because he completed his last pass against Texas Tech, Krenzel
tied the school record of 12 consecutive completions over more than
one game, shared by three players. He fell one shy of tying Jim
Karsatos' single-game mark of 12. Krenzel finished 12 for 14 for 190
yards.</TE>
<TE>   No. 25 Wisconsin 34, West Virginia 17--Brooks Bollinger passed for
218 yards and two touchdowns to freshman Jonathan Orr as the Badgers
(3-0) used a 27-point second quarter to defeat the Mountaineers (1-1)
at Madison, Wis.</TE>
<TE>   Behind great protection, Bollinger found his receivers wide open
on short and long patterns, completing 12 of 15 passes for 203 yards
in the first half as Wisconsin built a 34-3 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Wisconsin freshman Brandon Williams had six catches for 125 yards,
including five for 114 in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   Orr had five receptions for 94 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Southern Mississippi 23, Illinois 20--Derrick Nix ran for 201
yards and two touchdowns, despite not playing the second quarter
after he became ill, as the Golden Eagles (2-0) defeated the Illini
(0-2) at Hattiesburg, Miss.</TE>
<TE>   Antoineo Harris ran for a career-high 162 yards in 31 carries for
Illinois, which is 0-2 for the first time since its winless 1997
season.</TE>
<TE>   Iowa 29, Miami (Ohio) 24--Brad Banks threw a 38-yard pass to set
up a touchdown, then hooked up with C.J. Jones on a 48-yard score as
the Hawkeyes (2-0) rallied in the second half to defeat the RedHawks
(1-1) at Oxford, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Roethlisberger, who passed for more yards and touchdowns than
any other freshman last season, kept Miami close. He was 33 for 51
for 343 yards and two touchdowns, and had two touchdown passes to
Michael Larkin negated by penalties.</TE>
<TE>   Texas Christian 48, Northwestern 24--Corey Connally rushed for 88
yards and a score and had another 33 yards receiving as the Horned
Frogs (1-1) defeated the Wildcats (0-2) at Evanston, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Wright, a former Diamond Bar High standout, was the lone
bright spot for Northwestern, returning the opening kickoff for a
school-record 100 yards. He set another mark with 191 yards on kick
returns.</TE>
<TE>   Utah 40, Indiana 13--Marty Johnson ran for 229 yards in three
quarters, the fourth-best total in Utah history, and J.R. Peroulis
had 118 more as the Utes (2-0) defeated the Hoosiers (1-1) at Salt
Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, who missed the fourth quarter after spraining a ligament
in his right knee, scored on a two-yard run in the second quarter and
had a 16-yard touchdown run in the third. He will be out four to six
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 35, Louisiana Lafayette 11--Asad Abdul-Khaliq threw a
career-high four touchdown passes--three to tight end Ben Utecht--as
the Golden Gophers (2-0) defeated the Ragin' Cajuns (0-2) at
Lafayette, La.</TE>

<LD>   Guide Jason Edwards found inspiration in her effort.</LD>
<TE>   "What she did was incredible, and that's what I wrote in the

<LD>Matt Schaub threw three touchdown passes, and Virginia took advantage
of seven South Carolina turnovers to defeat the 22nd-ranked
Gamecocks, 34-21, Saturday night at Charlottesville, Va.</LD>
<LD>   Schaub, who had been inconsistent in the Cavaliers' first two
games--both losses--while sharing time with redshirt freshman Marques
Hagans, played nearly the entire game and delivered a strong
performance.</LD>
<LD>   Billy McMullen, a 6-foot-4 receiver who struggled to get open in
the first two games, took advantage of South Carolina's smaller
secondary, catching four passes four 72 yards, including a 35-yard
touchdown pass and three other catches facing third-and-long.</LD>
<TE>   The Gamecocks (1-1) fumbled six times and threw an interception.
Three of the turnovers led to Cavalier touchdowns, and two others
happened deep in Virginia territory, stopping potential scoring
drives.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been in this game a long time, and I don't ever remember
being in a situation like this," South Carolina Coach Lou Holtz said
of the turnovers. "There were times we didn't have nearly have that
many turnovers in a season."</TE>
<TE>   South Carolina's defense, which looked suspect in a 34-24
season-opening victory over New Mexico State, again gave up big
yardage. The Cavaliers amassed 339 yards of total offense, including
196 passing.</TE>
<TE>   The Cavaliers (1-2) trailed 21-20 at halftime but took advantage
of two third-quarter fumbles to take a 13-point lead.</TE>
<TE>   With a little over four minutes left in the quarter, Schaub was
intercepted on the South Carolina six-yard line by Langston Moore,
but Moore fumbled and Schaub recovered. Three plays later, Schaub
passed to Kase Luzar for a five-yard touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a big step forward for our team," Virginia Coach Al Groh
said. "We beat a real good team."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Philip Rivers threw for 309 yards and five touchdowns to tie a
school record as 21st-ranked North Carolina State (3-0) sent Navy
(1-1) to its 10th consecutive home loss with a 65-19 decision at
Annapolis, Md. Rivers, who also ran for a score, completed 10 of 15
passes, including touchdown passes of 64 and 88 yards to split end
Bryan Peterson. Rivers broke a school record by accounting for six
touchdowns.... Scott McBrien threw a touchdown and ran for another,
and Steve Suter returned a punt 81 yards for a score as Maryland
(1-1) built a 28-point halftime lead and cruised to a 44-14 victory
over Akron (0-2) at College Park, Md.... Backup tailback Yusef Kelly
ran for 97 yards and three touchdowns and kicker Aaron Hunt had four
field goals as Clemson (1-1) rolled to a 33-13 victory over Louisiana
Tech (1-1) at Clemson, S.C.... Dave Ragone threw for 258 yards and
Louisville (1-1) held Duke (1-1) without a first down in the first 28
minutes of a 40-3 victory at Durham, N.C.... James MacPherson threw
for 216 yards and a touchdown and Wake Forest (1-1) forced five
turnovers in a 27-22 victory over East Carolina (0-2) at
Winston-Salem, N.C.... Tony Hollings ran for four touchdowns to tie a
school record and had all 144 of his yards in the first half as
Georgia Tech (2-0) scored a 31-14 over Connecticut (0-2) at Storrs,
Conn.</TE>

<TE>   BIG EAST</TE>
<TE>   Darian Durant threw two touchdown passes in the fourth quarter and
Dan Orner kicked field goals from 51, 52 and a school-record 55 yards
as North Carolina (1-1) held on for a 30-22 victory over Syracuse
(0-2) at Syracuse, N.Y. Orner equaled the Division I-A record for
most 50-yard field goals in a game. The mark was set in 1966 by
Wyoming's Jerry DePoyster and matched by Wichita State's Sergio
Lopez-Chavero in 1984 and Iowa's Tim Douglas in 1998.... Randall
Secky threw three touchdown passes to Andre Forde as Buffalo (1-1)
scored a 34-11 victory over Rutgers (0-2) at Piscataway, N.J., in a
matchup of two of the worst teams in major college football.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CONFERENCE USA</TE>
<TE>   J.P. Losman threw two touchdown passes and Tulane (2-0, 1-0)

14 of 25 passes for 208 yards and Mewelde Moore had 90 yards in 19
carries for Tulane.... Ari Confesor returned a kickoff 95 yards for a
touchdown and Chris Vella kicked five field goals as Division I-AA

Crusaders, who defeated a I-A opponent for the first time since
beating Army 31-24 in 1987.... Freshman quarterback Darrell Hackney
came off the bench in the first quarter to spark a stagnant Alabama
Birmingham (1-1) offense, completing 11 of 15 passes for 139 yards
and a touchdown in a 27-26 victory over visiting Troy State (0-2).</TE>

32-20 victory over Wyoming (0-2) at Mount Pleasant, Mich. The

<HD>Keyes' Allegiance Goes Across Town</HD>
<DH>High schools: Birmingham safety dreamed of playing for USC
but accepts offer from UCLA.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC SONDHEIMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For more than 30 years, Dennis Keyes Sr. has been a USC football fan,
his loyalty seemingly assured after watching Anthony Davis score six
touchdowns against Notre Dame in a 1972 televised game from the
Coliseum.</LD>
<LD>   "My dream was I wanted to be a tailback at USC and win the Heisman
Trophy," he said.</LD>
<LD>   He didn't play football after high school, but he hoped his first
son, Dennis Jr., might be good enough to play for the Trojans.</LD>
<TE>   Keyes, an All-City running back and defensive back at Lake Balboa
Birmingham High, attended the final day of a USC camp this summer
thinking the Trojans would offer him a scholarship.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to go to USC," he said. "I played what I thought was
real good football. I was ready to commit that day. They said they
weren't sure yet. They wanted me to come out again and show more. It
was like I had to audition."</TE>
<TE>   Not long after the USC camp, Keyes attended a one-day camp at
UCLA. The Bruin coaches didn't need to see him play anymore. They
immediately offered a scholarship.</TE>
<TE>   "They treated me like I was at home," Keyes said.</TE>
<TE>   Keyes committed to the Bruins, forcing his mother, father and four
siblings to change allegiances.</TE>
<TE>   What UCLA will be getting in another year is a 6-foot-2, 185-pound
hard-hitting safety who also could be one of the City Section's top
running backs this season.</TE>
<TE>   As a junior, Keyes rushed for 1,172 yards, averaged 9.1 yards per
carry and scored 18 touchdowns. He helped Birmingham win its second
consecutive West Valley League championship.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got a linebacker's mentality," Coach Ed Croson said.</TE>
<TE>   From the time he put on football pads as a 6-year-old, Keyes has
loved to hit. He remembers following his father's simple instructions
in those early days: "Whoever has the ball, get 'em."</TE>
<TE>   "I just ran into a lot of people because I was pretty big for my
age," he said. "It was fun, but I still had no idea what I was
doing."</TE>
<TE>   Versatility became a Keyes trademark. On Birmingham's varsity as a
sophomore, he played every defensive position except tackle and nose
guard. He made his biggest impact rushing quarterbacks, with teams
struggling to find blockers quick enough to slow Keyes' relentless
pursuit.</TE>
<TE>   He continues to blossom as a ballcarrier, using superb vision,
speed and instincts. Last October in a 40-21 victory over Woodland
Hills Taft, he rushed for 216 yards in 26 carries and scored on a
96-yard reception. He also dropped All-American receiver Steve Smith
of Taft for a loss on a screen pass with a hit so intense that it
made Birmingham's highlight film.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're playing people like Steve and Taft, you have to come
with your 'A' game or you're going to lose," Keyes said.</TE>
<TE>   Keyes receives plenty of support from his family, particularly his
two younger brothers, Julius, 11, and Spencer, 6.</TE>
<TE>   "They kind of worship the ground he walks on and I let them know
he's not God," Dennis Sr. said.</TE>
<TE>   Spencer, who started playing tackle football in August, is a
running back in the making.</TE>
<TE>   "My little brother tries everything I do," Keyes said. "He watches
a highlight tape, sees me spinning off a tackle, so he'll go run into
the couch and spin off it."</TE>
<TE>   Keyes may have to do some redecorating of his bedroom. He played
for the East Valley Trojans youth team and liked everything about the
Trojans.</TE>
<TE>   "I have Trojan trophies, helmets and jerseys all over my room," he
said. "I love the Trojans, but now I'm a Bruin."</TE>

<HD>Frankel Gets Two Big Wins</HD>

<DL>DEL MAR</DL>
<LD>Trainer Bobby Frankel hit home runs on each coast Saturday, winning
the $500,000 Woodward with Lido Palace at Belmont Park about three
hours before his assistant, Humberto Ascanio, saddled Inesperado for
a win in the $300,000 Del Mar Derby.</LD>
<LD>   Each horse was favored, Lido Palace paying $2.90 in New York and
Inesperado returning $5.60 for $2 here. The $300,000 purse for Lido
Palace's owners and the $180,000 that Inesperado earned will swell
Frankel's lead in the national money standings. He was already at
$11.5 million, more than $3 million ahead of Bob Baffert.</LD>
<LD>   Lido Palace hasn't won many U.S. races since leaving Chile, but
all three of his victories have been in Grade I stakes. Saturday's
effort was a repeat in the Woodward and moved the horse into some
exclusive company; all five of the previous back-to-back Woodward
winners are in the Hall of Fame.</LD>
<TE>   The Woodward list includes Sword Dancer, Kelso, Forego, Slew o'
Gold and Cigar, and now there is Lido Palace, a grind-it-out
5-year-old who was a winner by three-quarters of a length over Gander
at 1 1/8 miles. Exactly 364 days ago, Lido Palace used a similar
style to best Albert The Great by a length in the Woodward.</TE>
<TE>   Lido Palace's only other U.S. win, out of eight races since John
and Jerry Amerman of Palos Verdes Estates brought him here in 2001,
came in last year's Whitney Handicap at Saratoga. The 5-year-old
Chilean-bred finished third in last month's Whitney, a defeat that
extended his losing streak to four races.</TE>
<TE>   Frankel said Lido Palace would run Sept. 28 at Belmont in the
Jockey Club Gold Cup, a $1-million race at 1 1/4 miles. After that,
the Amermans will weigh an expensive option: whether to write an
$800,000 check to make Lido Palace eligible for the $4-million
Breeders' Cup Classic at Arlington Park on Oct. 26. A year ago, the
Amermans passed on the Breeders' Cup and instead sent Lido Palace to
Tokyo, where he finished eighth in the Japan Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's win, worth $300,000, sent Lido Palace's all-time
earnings over the $2.1-million mark. Overall, his record is nine
wins, six seconds and two thirds in 20 starts. His clocking for 1 1/8
miles on dirt was 1:47 3/5. Express Tour finished third, a neck back
of Gander, in what was not a stellar six-horse field.</TE>
<TE>   Jorge Chavez, who rode Lido Palace for the first time, was aboard
again Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody's perfect, and in another $500,000 race at Belmont, the Man
o'War for grass horses, Frankel's runners, Skipping and Lord
Flasheart, ran fourth and fifth as With Anticipation, under Pat Day,
overtook Balto Star in the last 40 yards for a one-length win.</TE>
<TE>   Ridden by Corey Nakatani--who tried to call Frankel in New York
for pre-race instructions but had the wrong number--Inesperado beat
Johar by one length at Del Mar, with Rock Opera, the pacesetter,
running third, beaten by 1 1/2 lengths. The time for 1 1/8 miles,
over a grass course listed as firm, was 1:47 2/5.</TE>

<HD>Dodger Bats Take a Break</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Astro rookie Hernandez leaves L.A. hitters
frustrated in 6-1 setback.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brian Jordan lifted his bat slowly, holding it level to look at two
spots a few inches apart and no more than 10 inches from the knob.</LD>
<LD>   In each place was a small but unmistakable crack, souvenirs of his
frustrating at-bats against rookie left-hander Carlos Hernandez in
the Dodgers' 6-1 loss to the Houston Astros on Saturday before a
sun-drenched crowd of 30,626 at Dodger Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   "He was running the cutter in on right-handers. He's deceiving,"
Jordan said of Hernandez (7-5), who limited the Dodgers to five hits
over seven innings in his fourth start since shoulder soreness put
him on the disabled list for six weeks.</LD>
<TE>   "He doesn't throw that hard, but he gets it up on you," Jordan
said. "He kept us off balance and was changing speeds. Today was his
day. He deserved to win."</TE>
<TE>   And the Dodgers didn't, not after pressuring Hernandez in the
first inning and letting him wriggle out of a bases-loaded jam with
only one run's worth of damage. He allowed them few openings after
that, permitting only two more runners to reach scoring position on a
leadoff double by pinch-hitter Jolbert Cabrera in the fifth inning
and a two-out double by Eric Karros in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   After throwing 48 pitches in the first two innings, Hernandez
needed only 56 over the next five to stymie the Dodgers and keep the
Astros on the fringes of the National League playoff race. The loss
and the San Francisco Giants' 4-3 victory over the Arizona
Diamondbacks cut the Dodgers' cushion over the Giants in the
wild-card race to two games--and added weight to Manager Jim Tracy's
proclamation that today is "the most important day of the season at
this point in time."</TE>
<TE>   Then again, Saturday was no less important, but Hernandez turned
it into a day of regret, keeping the Dodgers 4 1/2 games behind the
West-leading Diamondbacks.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got good stuff," Karros said of Hernandez. "The guy's a good
pitcher.... Every once in a while, you're going to run into some good
pitching outside of [Curt] Schilling and [Randy] Johnson."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers' pitching Saturday was less than what the occasion
demanded. To be fair, the loss was the first since July 15 for
starter Omar Daal (11-7), who had four victories and four
no-decisions in his previous eight starts and hadn't given up more
than two earned runs in any of those games.</TE>
<TE>   But Daal's pattern of struggling against the Astros--he's 1-7 with
a 6.59 earned-run average against Houston in his career--continued
Saturday. He lasted 4 2/3 innings, his shortest outing since he went
3 2/3 innings in a 12-6 loss at St. Louis on July 7, and was tagged
for four runs and nine hits.</TE>
<TE>   Third baseman Mark Loretta accounted for three of those hits off
Daal and four overall.</TE>
<TE>   The key hit, though, was a two-out, two-run home run into the
left-field seats in the fifth by Jeff Bagwell to give the Astros a
4-1 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "That kind of put a damper on things and spiraled in the wrong
direction," said Tracy, whose team had won five of its previous six
games.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, today was one of those days. We didn't get going
offensively and they did offensive damage in the middle innings. When
they put up runs like that, we dig a hole a little bit too deep for
ourselves to climb out of."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers had jumped to a first-inning lead on a single by Paul
Lo Duca, a walk to Adrian Beltre and a run-scoring single by Jordan.
But the Astros rallied in the fourth, on RBI singles by Loretta and
Gregg Zaun, and they pulled away in the fifth on Bagwell's blast.</TE>
<TE>   Houston added single runs in the sixth and seventh off Giovanni
Carrara, while the Dodgers couldn't get to Hernandez or Dave Mlicki.
The top four hitters in the Dodgers' lineup are a combined four for
43 over the last three games.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't really want to think about my shoulder anymore,"
Hernandez said. "I just want to put the injury behind me and
concentrate on doing my job to help the team. I want to have fun
every time I go out there."</TE>
<TE>   With one game left in their series against Houston--and their
streak of winning nine consecutive series on the line--the Dodgers
had no time to dwell on Saturday's defeat. They don't have the luxury
of looking ahead to the three-game series against the Giants that
opens Monday at Pacific Bell Park.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important to win every series," Jordan said. "You do that,
and you have a chance to maintain and move on to [playing in]
October."</TE>

<LD>The Dodgers have no plans to plaster billboards with ads promoting
Shawn Green or Eric Gagne for most valuable player. Nor will they
send out a flood of e-mails, as the Cincinnati Reds have done for
rookie-of-the-year candidate Austin Kearns.</LD>
<LD>   That's not to say the Dodgers won't push their players for major
awards. They'll simply be subtle about it.</LD>
<LD>   "Historically, we've shied away from big advertising campaigns,"
said Derrick Hall, the team's senior vice president for
communications. "We try to make sure we don't treat those awards like
the Heisman Trophy because that could backfire and turn sour on the
players. It is our job to indicate to the media and fans how our
players are doing, because we're on the West Coast and a lot of
writers don't see our guys."</LD>
<TE>   The Dodgers will try to accomplish that by supplementing the
information they provide on award candidates in their game notes,
which are distributed to home and visiting writers, and by urging
broadcasters to extol players' merits. They also encourage players to
discuss teammates' award candidacies.</TE>
<TE>   Hall credited a subtle push with helping outfielder Todd
Hollandsworth win the rookie-of-the-year award in 1996. The Dodgers
reprinted quotes from baseball people that were complimentary to
Hollandsworth, hoping writers who vote for postseason awards would
remember those observations when they cast their ballots.</TE>
<TE>   Green said an MVP campaign would be flattering, but it's not his
main concern.</TE>
<TE>   "It would obviously be an honor," Green said. "It's just nice to
be considered.... The success I've had is a result of having guys on
base and driving them in. It all works together."</TE>
<TE>   If he voted, he'd consider several players. "Barry Bonds is having
a great year, [Houston's Lance] Berkman," he said. "[Albert] Pujols
is having a great year too."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chad Kreuter will catch Kazuhisa Ishii today because Manager Jim
Tracy wants to give Paul Lo Duca a day off before the coming series
against the San Francisco Giants. Tracy also said Tyler Houston will
start at first base today in place of Eric Karros because Houston has
had success against Astro starter Roy Oswalt. Houston is five for
eight against Oswalt.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tickets for the division series will go on sale Saturday. Tickets
can be purchased at Dodger Stadium, with wristbands to be distributed
at 7:30 a.m. At 8:30 a.m., a drawing will be held to determine the
order of the ticket line. Tickets can also be purchased by calling
(323) 224-1448 or through www.dodgers.com.</TE>

<HD>Members-Only Jacket Outdated at Augusta</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BOSWELL</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When boys build a neat treehouse, "Members Only" is the first sign
that goes up. Though, at the age when such things matter, the "s" in
"members" may be printed backward. You need a special handshake,
maybe give a drop of blood. As for icky girls, they can't come in at
all. The most famous treehouse in America for little boys of all ages
is located in the Georgia pines of Augusta. It's "Spanky and Our
Gang" for millionaires. Even Billy Gates, the rich kid, wants to
join. But they won't let him in. Maybe if he lowers his handicap.</LD>
<LD>   Now--and this has really got Spanky, Alfalfa and Hootie spitting
on their cowlicks and getting rocks for their slingshots--the girls
want to join the club. OK, just one girl, maybe. But that would be
enough to spoil the whole effect. Why, she might show up any time.
Even when you're boiling a frog. What fun is that?</LD>
<LD>   These days, it's amazing to watch the escalating playground
politics between the wealthy men of Augusta, who've worked up a high
moral outrage because their treehouse may be invaded, and the
insistent National Council of Women's Organizations.</LD>
<TE>   Martha Burk, chairwoman of NCWO, has done her job. She's supposed
to put social and economic pressure on real, or symbolic,
discriminators against women. The Masters, with its horrid record for
decades on racial discrimination, is as symbolic as it gets.</TE>
<TE>   Augusta Chairman William (Hootie) Johnson responded to a letter
from Burk, pushing for a woman member by the next Masters, by going
ballistic. Open mouth, insert soft spikes. The Masters wouldn't be
"intimidated" or yield to pressure. Their timetable would be their
own. And, by the way, women play a thousand rounds a year at Augusta
already. (OK, that's three a day.) How's that for progress? If your
husband is a member, you can even tee off before noon. Just like an
actual ... well ... man.</TE>
<TE>   Next, Burk went to the Masters' TV sponsors--IBM, Coca-Cola and
Citigroup--to see how they felt about being associated with a club
that excludes women members. Standard arm twisting. Welcome to
America. As if all the CEO members at Augusta don't do the same thing
to further their interests in business every day.</TE>
<TE>   The Masters went double ballistic. They told IBM, Coca-Cola and
Citigroup that they were no longer needed. Think we can be pressured?
Just watch. The Masters would foot all its own bills, do without TV
sponsors and broadcast 12 hours of Masters coverage without a single
commercial.</TE>
<TE>   ''I'm surprised at the amount of money they are willing to pay to
continue to discriminate against women,'' said Burk, who must want to
nominate Johnson as Man of the Year for all the help he's been. You
can't buy PR like this for any price: A man named ''Hootie'' thinks
there's no woman on earth worthy of his club.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, Burk has chewed her way up the food chain and is now
calling of pro golfers to take a ''moral stand.'' This should be
interesting. The average PGA pro, including Tiger Woods so far,
thinks that moving your ball in the rough should be punishable by
death, but solving world hunger isn't in his domain.</TE>
<TE>   CBS says it hasn't gotten an earful from Burk yet. Turn up your
hearing aides, guys. That's Martha beating on the wall. And the noise
is only going to get louder.</TE>
<TE>   There's a solution to all this. And it's easy. Come on, Hootie,
just take a mulligan. You've hit one 50 yards out of bounds.
Everybody knows it. Don't try to pretend you're going to find your
ball. Go back to the tee. Take your medicine. And try to hit the next
one in the fairway. Why not call Nancy Lopez, who lives in Atlanta?
She can afford the initiation and dues. Her husband, Ray Knight, the
ex-World Series MVP, would faint with joy. She can play the back
tees. Ray can move up.</TE>
<TE>   So far, most of the criticism of the Masters has been of the
joshing, eye-rolling variety. But it's important that Johnson, who's
normally sensible, understand the seriousness of what he's facing. If
he doesn't regain his senses pretty soon, he's going to feel like
he's been run over by a truck. Of course his position is technically
correct. "This is not a legal issue," the club wrote to ESPN this
week, offering "talking points" in its defense. "The Masters has a
constitutional right to its private membership."</TE>
<TE>   That's true. And so what? If you step in the street when the sign
says, "Walk," but a 16-wheeler is coming at you, do you jump out of
its way? Or do you say, "It's legal for me to stand here."</TE>
<TE>   In the scheme of things, equal rights for women is one of the most
fundamental social issues in history. The women's movement, like all
"causes," will presumably manifest itself in ways that range from
profound to frivolous. Fighting with the Masters probably falls in
the middle.</TE>
<TE>   But what "cause" is Augusta National fighting for? Hootie and his
Blowhards, as they're now being called nationwide, appear to be
defending the right of rich guys in ugly jackets to thumb their noses
at anybody anytime, while throwing money at any problem.</TE>
<TE>   Burk is on a collision course with Johnson, but she's blowing her
horn to warn him. Hootie, head down, is peddling his tricycle as fast
as he can right at her big rig. Champions dinner: Road kill.</TE>
<TE>   Once, Augusta National allowed itself to be seen--perhaps even
enjoyed being seen--as one of the last brazen symbols of racial
discrimination in America. Back then, the club learned what the full
weight of negative public opinion felt like. It bent. It changed, to
a degree. And the Masters has been better for it. With the years,
with Lee Elder's arrival and Tiger Woods' three victories, it's
become easier to let Augusta National's leaders off the hook.</TE>
<TE>   However, the club can put itself right back in the nation's

<HD>Changing Into Superman</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Rob Fernas</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Tony Hollings was unhappy playing defensive back at Georgia Tech. So
he went to Coach Chan Gailey with a request: "Let me carry the ball."</LD>
<LD>   Gailey, faced with a hole at running back, was receptive to the
idea.</LD>
<LD>   "He told me he played offense in high school and felt more
comfortable there," said Gailey, the former Dallas Cowboy coach who
replaced George O'Leary last December. "I said, 'Sure.' That was
that."</LD>
<TE>   Hollings has been rewriting the school record book ever since.
Last week, he became the first player in Georgia Tech history to rush
for 100 yards in his debut at running back. Saturday, he tied a
school record by scoring four touchdowns in the Yellow Jackets' 31-14
victory over Connecticut.</TE>
<TE>   Hollings, who has a Superman logo tattooed on his left biceps, ran
through the Huskies for 144 yards and touchdowns of 34, one, 46 and
one yard, all in the first half. In Georgia Tech's opener, he ran for
153 yards and two touchdowns in a 45-3 victory over Vanderbilt.</TE>
<TE>   Granted, those are far from formidable opponents--Connecticut is
playing only its third season of Division I-A football--but 297 yards
and six touchdowns after two games is nothing to scoff at.</TE>
<TE>   Hollings, who played option quarterback in high school, said
making the transition to running back wasn't as smooth as it appears.</TE>
<TE>   "Spending two years on defense, I was used to getting the ball out
of other people's hands," he said. "As a running back, I couldn't let
it out of my hands."</TE>
<TE>   Irish Eyes Aren't Smiling About Powerless Offense</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Notre Dame Coach Tyrone Willingham should consider switching
Vontez Duff to offense.</TE>
<TE>   Duff, a defensive back, has scored two touchdowns this season.
That's two more than the Irish offense, which was held without one
for the second consecutive game.</TE>
<TE>   Duff's 34-yard interception return for a touchdown lifted Notre
Dame to a 24-17 victory over Purdue, a week after he scored on a
76-yard punt return that secured a 22-0 victory against Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   "Once I get the ball in my hands, I'm going to score," Duff said.</TE>
<TE>   That's more than can be said for Willingham's West Coast offense,
which has been bailed out by the team's opportunistic defense and
special teams. The Irish scored two touchdowns on fumble returns
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt real embarrassed about not having scored in two games,"
quarterback Carlyle Holiday said. "We know as an offensive team we
have to make touchdowns. We have to work on some things to become a
better ball club."</TE>
<TE>   Willingham's honeymoon continues because the Irish are 2-0, but
he'll have a lot to answer for if his offense continues its anemic
play.</TE>
<TE>   New Life in the Slow Lane Suits Former Bruin Just Fine</TE>
<TE>   Tired of sitting on the bench after three up-and-down seasons at
UCLA, quarterback Ryan McCann packed his bags and transferred to
Tennessee-Chattanooga, a Division I-AA school where the pace is
slower and the expectations are lower.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of a nice change," said McCann, a former Agoura High
standout. "Los Angeles is so crowded. It's nice to come to
Chattanooga and see things slow down a little bit to focus on what I
want to do."</TE>
<TE>   McCann wanted to be the starter at UCLA, but his successes were
always followed by disappointment. In 1999, he replaced Cory Paus and
rallied the Bruins to a 23-20 overtime victory over No. 23
Washington. McCann again took over for an injured Paus on the second
play of the 2000 season and led UCLA to wins over two No. 3
teams--Alabama and Michigan. Three games later, Paus was back and
McCann didn't start again until last season--a loss to Washington
State.</TE>
<TE>   "I realized that if I wanted to play a whole year by myself, I'd
have to go somewhere else," he said.</TE>
<TE>   McCann is starting, but he isn't winning. He completed 19 of 36
passes for a career-best 257 yards and two touchdowns, with two
interceptions, Saturday in a 41-23 loss to Alabama State, a week
after Chattanooga was mauled by West Virginia, 56-7.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio State Students Go Nuts for Their Heisman Candidate</TE>
<TE>   It started out as a gag. Now the campaign for Richard McNutt as a
Heisman Trophy candidate has taken on a life of its own.</TE>
<TE>   McNutt, a little-known defensive back for No. 8 Ohio State, is
being promoted by a group of students who have set up a Web site and
are selling T-shirts with "McNutt For Heisman" on the front. On the
back, a picture of McNutt's head is superimposed over that of the
ballcarrier on the Heisman Trophy.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't get embarrassed by it," McNutt said. "Hopefully, I can do
something to live up to what they're trying to do."</TE>
<TE>   Air Force Relies on Tricks To Reverse Heated Rivalry</TE>
<TE>   There were reports last week that Air Force Coach Fisher DeBerry
guaranteed the Falcons wouldn't lose to New Mexico for a fourth
consecutive year. DeBerry denied the reports and suggested Lobo Coach
Rocky Long was behind it. Long responded with some verbal jabs of his
own.</TE>
<TE>   Such is the state of affairs between the Mountain West Conference
rivals, who have developed a strong dislike for each other in recent
years.</TE>
<TE>   DeBerry had the last laugh Saturday, when Air Force showed how
much it wanted to win by using a playbook's worth of trick plays en
route to a 38-31 overtime victory.</TE>
<TE>   "I told them all, if you can't get off the field when the game's
over, don't worry, we'll have carts to get you off the field,"
DeBerry said of his players. "But we're going to leave it all on the
field."</TE>
<TE>   The Falcons used two halfback passes, a tackle-eligible pass and
even players pretending to tie their shoes in an effort to catch New
Mexico off guard. Afterward, Long put his spin on Air Force's acts of
deception.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a sign of respect when you have to run about 15
trick plays," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Wisconsin's Runaway Victory Results in Cease-Fire for Mascot</TE>
<TE>   Wisconsin made sure the West Virginia mascot had few opportunities
to fire his musket.</TE>
<TE>   The 25th-ranked Badgers breezed to a 34-17 victory, much to the
chagrin of the Mountaineer mascot, who fires an antique gunpowder
musket every time West Virginia scores.</TE>
<TE>   Wisconsin officials had banned the musket from Camp Randall
Stadium because of a university rule prohibiting firearms on campus,
but reversed their decision after West Virginia asked for an
exception.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't really use it too much," Badger linebacker Jeff Mack
said with a grin.</TE>

<LD>Carlos Ruiz scored two second-half goals to rally the Galaxy to a 2-1
victory over the Chicago Fire in a Major League Soccer game in front
of 15,731 on Saturday night at Naperville, Ill.</LD>
<LD>   With the score tied, 1-1, Craig Weibel stole the ball from Peter
Nowak. After a couple of passes, Mauricio Cienfuegos sent a pass to
the right wing to Simon Elliott.</LD>
<LD>   Ruiz took a 25-yard pass from Elliot, got behind defender Orlando
Perez and beat Zach Thornton for the go-ahead goal in the 87th
minute. It was Ruiz's fifth goal against the Fire.</LD>
<TE>   Ruiz, who leads the league with 22 goals, headed Elliott's corner
kick to tie the score in the 79th minute. His game-winning goal
allowed him to break the club record for goals in a season, topping
the 21 scored by Eduardo Hurtado in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Jesse Marsch scored in the eighth minute. The goal ended the
Fire's 191-minute scoreless streak against the Galaxy.</TE>
<TE>   Four Chicago shots hit the goalposts.</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy is 14-9-3; the Fire is 10-12-4.</TE>
<TE>   In remembrance of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the crowd
observed a moment of silence before the game and "God Bless America"

<HD>Buccaneers Use Sneer Campaign</HD>
<DH>Pro football: It won't be child's play, but pressure is
squarely on Gruden to take Tampa Bay to the next level.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dr. Jim Gruden traveled to Florida's Gulf Coast a few weeks ago to
spend some time with his younger brother, Jon, new coach of the Tampa
Bay Buccaneers.</LD>
<LD>   The brothers got that time. All two minutes of it.</LD>
<LD>   "When he was with Oakland, Jon could find places where people
didn't know who he was, or didn't care," said Jim, a radiologist at
Emory University in Atlanta. "In Tampa, if he goes out anywhere, he's
accosted. The people are great--they just want to wish him well or
have him sign something--but it's just part of conversing with Jon;
there's going to be an interruption in the middle of every sentence."</LD>
<TE>   Sometimes, folks just want to see him sneer. Gruden's scowl is his
trademark and in Oakland earned him the nickname "Chucky," a
reference to the character in the "Child's Play" horror movies. One
of the more popular Chucky T-shirts in Tampa--and they're
everywhere--reads, "Got Gruden?" on the front and "We Do" on the
back, with a picture of Chucky wearing earphones. At one store
featuring Buccaneer gear, customers get discounts if they flash
Gruden grimaces, mimicking the look he strikes on the cover of last
week's Sports Illustrated.</TE>
<TE>   "I went to an Orlando Predator game to see my brother play," said
Gruden, whose younger brother, Jay, is the coach-turned-quarterback
of that Arena Football League team. "I hear this, 'Chucky, Chucky,
Chucky!' I turn around and give him one of these [raising one
eyebrow, lowering the other], and they went crazy."</TE>
<TE>   Gruden can make his eyebrows dance, but he has very little wiggle
room when it comes to winning. His predecessor, Tony Dungy, now
coaching the Indianapolis Colts, led the Buccaneers to the playoffs
four times in the last five seasons and built a defense that was
among the best in the league. A lot of Tampa Bay players didn't want
to see him go, and the situation got particularly embarrassing and
awkward when Bill Parcells turned down an offer to replace him. The
Buccaneers wound up spending four high draft picks--two
first-rounders and two second-rounders--and $8 million to pry Gruden
loose from Oakland, where the Raiders had him under contract for a
final season. His Tampa Bay contract reportedly will pay him $17.5
million over five years.</TE>
<TE>   Gruden was 40-28 in four seasons with the Raiders, and led them to
the playoffs the last two seasons, after a six-year drought. But his
relationship with Raider owner Al Davis steadily deteriorated, and
the two barely spoke for the better part of last season. Even now,
Gruden sidesteps questions about the Raiders or his dealings with
Davis, although a source close to Gruden said the coach "just felt he
wasn't dealt with honestly."</TE>
<TE>   The reluctance of Davis and Gruden to talk about their tension has
left the feud open to speculation. It had to bother Davis that Gruden
had become the face of the organization. TV cameras that used to turn
to Davis clutching his towel in the owner's suite were turned to an
even more compelling subject, the growling coach on the sideline.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, those cameras were focused on Gruden again, as he put
his new team through the paces at training camp. The whole operation
was moved from the University of Tampa to Walt Disney World in
Orlando, where thousands of fans showed up to watch every session.</TE>
<TE>   Gruden kept Dungy's entire defensive staff, and 10 of 11 starters
are back for a defense that finished sixth in the league last season.
Naturally, the changes have been on offense, which ranked 26th in
2001. Gruden added several experienced free agents such as receivers
Keenan McCardell and Joe Jurevicius, both of whom should take
pressure off Keyshawn Johnson, the team's only reliable receiver last
season; tight ends Ken Dilger and Marco Battaglia, tackles Lomas
Brown and Roman Oben, and former Buffalo quarterback Rob Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   "[Gruden] didn't just do things haphazardly," safety John Lynch
said. "He came in here, analyzed things and put together a plan. It
was incredible to sit back and watch how he and [General Manager]
Rich McKay just started putting the pieces together, one by one, guys
who would fit his offense."</TE>
<TE>   That said, Lynch and others think it's absurdly unrealistic to see
the new system as some kind of miracle cure for a team whose offense
has struggled for years.</TE>
<TE>   "The buildup is particularly hard on Jon because people have the
assumption that the team is supposed to go to the Super Bowl," Jim
Gruden said. "Somehow, people are making this assumption that they
had some sort of moron in Tony Dungy. It's crazy; the guy was a
really good coach. And Jon's system is not one that people grasp
overnight."</TE>
<TE>   Expectations were unbelievably high five seasons ago too, when
Gruden made his head-coaching debut with the Raiders.</TE>
<TE>   Two 8-8 seasons later, after Gruden had the players he needed and
his system had begun to take hold, he led the Raiders to consecutive
appearances in the AFC playoffs, where they lost to eventual Super
Bowl winners Baltimore and New England.</TE>
<TE>   That an offensive turnaround takes time is not lost on Tampa Bay's
players.</TE>
<TE>   "This thing was built on defense," defensive tackle Warren Sapp
said. "And if we don't realize that, we're the stupidest bunch of 11
guys that's ever played in this league.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to rest on our laurels and say we've been one of
the better defenses in this league for the last six or seven years.
That's not our mentality."</TE>
<TE>   Every season, the Buccaneers are at the center of Super Bowl talk.
But this year, players clearly are making an effort to downplay
expectations, probably at the behest of Gruden. After all, if this
team hits a rough patch and, say, loses two consecutive games, the
coach won't be the only one sneering.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Before Janet and Voodoo Dancer get together in what is essentially a
match race in the $150,000 Palomar Handicap and before the mules
Black Ruby and Taz renew acquaintances in what is a match race,
Habibti will make her comeback for trainer Bob Baffert in the $75,000
Torrey Pines Stakes today at Del Mar.</LD>
<LD>   At this time last year, the Tabasco Cat filly was unbeaten, having
followed up her maiden victory with a two-length win in the Del Mar
Debutante.</LD>
<LD>   Habibti has run only five times since the Debutante, winning once
when beating You in the Hollywood Starlet on Dec. 16.</LD>
<TE>   Mike Smith will ride Habibti for the first time in the one-mile
Torrey Pines. Her opponents include Ms Louisett, Bare Necessities,
Ragin T Rex, Got Koko, Ponche De Leona, Tamarack Bay, Runaway Pro and
Candor. The Torrey Pines is the third leg of a Pick Six that has a
carry-over of $524,884.</TE>
<TE>   Another talented 3-year-old filly will be in action on the other
coast. Wonder Again, who may be the best member of her class on the
turf, seeks her fourth consecutive win.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Joan and John Phillips and trained by Jimmy Toner, the
daughter of Silver Hawk has won three of four since being switched to
the grass and she will have nine opponents in the $250,000 Garden
City Breeders' Cup Handicap, a Grade I at 1 1/8 miles.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: A field of 13 will get together in the $1-million
Atto Mile at Woodbine in Toronto. Corey Nakatani will ride Touch Of
The Blues for trainer Neil Drysdale; Gary Stevens will handle Nuclear
Debate for trainer Darrell Vienna. The top contenders in the grassy
Grade I are Noverre, Del Mar Show and Good Journey.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Patrick Husbands. He is the runaway leader in the
jockey standings at Woodbine with 114 victories.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Adalberto Lopez. The jockey lost with his first 18
mounts at Bay Meadows.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A trifecta in the Atto Mile keying Noverre on
top to Good Journey, Touch Of The Blues, Strut The Stage and Del Mar
Show in the two hole and all in the third spot.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 4/82. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $21.60/$469.60. Total money bet: $702.</TE>

<LD>Sign Of Lanty will go for his 16th local stakes win when he takes on
five challengers in the $26,600 Bull Raustus Handicap tonight.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by Jackie and Rod MacPherson and trained by John Cooper, the

from the outside in the 870-yard race and be ridden by Alex Bautista
as he seeks his third win in his last five starts.</LD>
<LD>   A Grade III, the Bull Raustus also lured Sterling Sport, who won
the MCI California Distance Challenge in his most recent start and
James Smith Memorial Handicap winner Butter Me Up CST. Gary Boag will
ride Sterling Sport for trainer Dennis Ekins while Dennis Means has
the call on Butter Me Up CST for trainer Felix Gonzalez.</LD>
<TE>   The rest of the lineup includes Azure Classic Dash, Diamond Cut
Diamond and Dashin With Johnny.</TE>
<TE>   After this evening, Los Alamitos will be dark Thursday before

<DL></DL>
<LD>Running Bac, who could have been claimed for $16,000 less than a year
ago, is now a Grade I winner.</LD>
<LD>   The 4-year-old Splash Bac mare made it four wins in a row and
eight victories in her last nine starts with a decisive victory over
longshot Mountain Snow and eight others in the $110,200 Mildred
Vessels Memorial Handicap on Saturday night at Los Alamitos.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by J. Francisco Diaz and trained by Juan Aleman, the 4-1
third choice broke well under jockey Ramon Sanchez and never looked
like a loser at any point while completing the 400 yards in 19.75
seconds.</LD>
<TE>   Bred in Utah by Kevin Glasmann, Running Bac has lost only once
since Aug. 4, 2001, and has now won 10 of 16 in her career, but she
had never beaten a field of the quality of the one she handled so
easily Saturday evening. She also dispelled any doubts about her
ability to handle 400 yards. Before the Vessels, all of her success
had come at 350 yards, and her last defeat had come when she was
fourth in the 550-yard Paul Ford Handicap last Dec. 7.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew if she got away clean from the gate, she would be right
there," Aleman said.</TE>

<HD>Miami Offers No Gator Aid in Easy Win</HD>
<DH>Nonconference: No. 1 Hurricanes look even better than last
season while pounding state rival Florida, 41-16.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GAINESVILLE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Here is what's different about Miami since the Hurricanes thrashed
Nebraska in last season's Rose Bowl to win the national title and
lost 11 players to the NFL draft, including both leading rushers and
the entire secondary:</LD>
<LD>   They're better?</LD>
<LD>   Playing state rival Florida for the first time in the regular
season since 1987, No. 1 Miami made the No. 6 Gators consider another
15-year hiatus after a 41-16 victory Saturday before a crowd of
83,771 at Florida Field.</LD>
<TE>   Miami (2-0) introduced 12 new starters this season, but the
transition has been as seamless as some hockey line changes.</TE>
<TE>   Miami extended its winning streak to 24 games and laid to rest
speculation the Hurricanes would rest on their laurels in the wake of
last season's 13-0 run to the national title.</TE>
<TE>   Miami lost players some programs couldn't replace in
years--running back Clinton Portis, left tackle Bryant McKinnie,
safety Ed Reed--yet somehow marched up, over and around Florida.</TE>
<TE>   The Hurricanes finished with 306 yards rushing against a defense
that was considered formidable. They got a 204-yard effort by
sophomore Willis McGahee, who averaged 8.5 yards per carry.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, when you rush for 300 yards, you're blocking
somebody," Miami Coach Larry Coker said.</TE>
<TE>   McGahee?</TE>
<TE>   He is the latest model in Miami's tailback production line, a
player who went unnoticed last year because of an injury and became
the starter this year only because of an injury to Frank Gore.</TE>
<TE>   McGahee, in one sultry evening, overshadowed a disappointing
showdown between Heisman Trophy quarterback candidates Rex Grossman
and Ken Dorsey, and made a name for himself.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't mind being a Heisman candidate," McGahee said. "I
don't know how you do that."</TE>
<TE>   McGahee was told he had just turned in his application.</TE>
<TE>   It is already scary to think how much better Miami might get when
the talented Gore returns from a knee injury.</TE>
<TE>   "When Frank gets back, it's going to be better for us and bad for
the teams we're going against," McGahee said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Miami entered the season ranked No. 1, the Hurricanes
somehow had this notion people didn't really think they could replace
a truckload of first-round draft picks.</TE>
<TE>   What about that inexperienced secondary?</TE>
<TE>   Well, junior safety Maurice Sikes put that doubt to rest when he
turned the game on its end late in the third quarter, tipping a
Grossman pass to himself at the Miami three-yard line and then racing
97 yards for a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Was it big?</TE>
<TE>   "Huge," Coker said.</TE>
<TE>   Florida, which cut the Miami lead to 27-16 in the third quarter
when linebacker Byron Hardmon intercepted a Dorsey pass and returned
it 26 yards for a touchdown, was looking to make it a four-point game
when Sikes so rudely intercepted.</TE>
<TE>   Sikes' catch and run with 2:27 left in the third quarter made it a
34-16 game and Miami added the rubber stamp in the fourth on a
19-yard scoring pass from Dorsey to Jason Geathers.</TE>
<TE>   Sikes further tormented Grossman with another interception in the
fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   He made both plays in desperation, having separated his left
shoulder in the first half while trying to tackle Florida back
Earnest Graham on a touchdown run.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have had to have been a broken leg for me to come out,"
Sikes said after the game.</TE>
<TE>   On the flip side, here's what is different about Florida since
Steve Spurrier scratched an itch and left Gainesville to coach the
Washington Redskins:</TE>
<TE>   Everything?</TE>
<TE>   Ron Zook inherited the impossible job of replacing Saint Spurrier,
and failed in his first major challenge against a major opponent.</TE>
<TE>   These transitions take time, so expect Gator fans to give Zook two
or three more practices to straighten things out.</TE>
<TE>   Florida (1-1) entered Saturday's game with a 69-5 home record
since 1990, yet left having allowed the most points at home since
giving up 63 to Auburn in 1970.</TE>
<TE>   For the record, Spurrier's five home losses were by a total of 25
points.</TE>
<TE>   Zook notched his first victory in last week's 51-3 walk-through
against Alabama Birmingham, yet that barely registered on the
Gator-meter.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to happen sooner or later," Zook said of his first
Florida defeat, "mine just happened sooner. Maybe it was a blessing
in disguise. Our football team is going to get better."</TE>
<TE>   Or else....</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't so much that Florida players lacked the skill to compete
with Miami, although that was part of it. Miami made Florida wilt in
the second half--quite a scientific setback for the school that
invented Gatorade.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time they called time out we looked over and they were on
their knees," Miami center Brett Romberg said of Florida players.</TE>
<TE>   Missing more than the physicality, though, was the psychological
hold Spurrier held on his players and the opponent's.</TE>
<TE>   As the junior Grossman struggled through one of the toughest
nights of his career, Spurrier was not on the sideline to set him
straight with a visor-toss or a two-minute tongue lashing.</TE>
<TE>   And so much for Grossman versus Dorsey, a ballyhooed battle that
ended up a bust.</TE>
<TE>   Grossman and Dorsey finished second and third in Heisman voting
last year behind Nebraska's Eric Crouch, but neither came close
Saturday to striking the pose.</TE>
<TE>   Grossman completed only 19 of 45 passes for 191 yards, with two
interceptions and no touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Dorsey completed half of his 32 passes for 202 yards and four
touchdowns, but also had three interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I played well enough to win," Dorsey said.</TE>
<TE>   He'll have to play better to win the Heisman.</TE>
<TE>   Dorsey can take consolation in the fact that he is 28-1 as a
starter, has time to work out the kinks and is surrounded by enough
talent to stock an NFL expansion franchise.</TE>
<TE>   Dorsey also knows his team can walk into any hostile environment
and win--at Penn State, at Florida State, at Nebraska (the Rose Bowl)
and now, at Florida.</TE>

<LD>   Jim Ryun, the king of middle-distance runners in 1968 after having
gone undefeated for three years in the 1,500 meters and mile,
finished second in Mexico City to Kenyan Kip Keino. The track world
eagerly awaited a rematch in the Olympic final in 1972. It didn't
happen. Ryun tripped and fell on the third lap of the opening round
of the 1,500. He remained on the ground for at least eight seconds,
then resumed running. But he was too far behind, finishing ninth in a
field of 10. Keino advanced through the rounds into the final and
finished second to Finland's Pekka Vasala.</LD>

the remainder of the Olympics by the International Olympic Committee,

1,600-meter relay. Having also lost John Smith, Collett's UCLA
teammate, because of an injury, the United States was forced to

<TE>   POSTCRIPT</TE>
<TE>   After becoming the first high school track and field athlete to
run the mile in under four minutes when he ran 3:59.0 as a
17-year-old junior at Wichita East High in 1964, Jim Ryun then
clocked a 3:55.3 as a senior in 1965--a national high school record
time that stood for 36 years until Alan Webb of Virginia ran 3:53.43
in May of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Ryun became a world-record holder at 880 yards (1:44.9), the mile
(3:51.1) and 1,500 meters (3:33.1), as well as a three-time U.S.
Olympian.</TE>
<TE>   Among the favorites in the 1,500 at Munich, Ryun failed to qualify
for the finals after he became entangled with Billy Fordjour of Ghana
in a preliminary heat and both fell with 550 meters to go. Ryun
appealed to the International Olympic Committee, claiming he was
fouled by another runner, Vitus Ashaba of Uganda, but was denied.</TE>
<TE>   This shocking end to Ryun's amateur career, on the heels of his
failure to make the 1,500 finals as a teenager in the 1964 Olympics
in Tokyo and a disappointing showing at the 1968 Olympics, at first
left him bitter.</TE>
<TE>   But Ryun, a devout Christian, leaned on his faith to weather his
Olympic trials.</TE>
<TE>   "You hope to win, and, by golly, I would have loved to win a gold
medal," he said. "Nevertheless, it was a life-changing experience. It
was the Olympics, and I still consider it a great achievement to have
run for the United States."</TE>
<TE>   These days, he runs for public office.</TE>
<TE>   First elected to represent the second district of Kansas in 1996,
Ryun, 55, is in his third term as a Republican congressman and is up
for re-election in November.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll have to see what the people say. Hopefully, it's a chance to
renew my contract," he said. "I still run, but this is a different
type of competition. You're competing for the safety of the country
and the interests of the country."</TE>

<HD>Notre Dame Takes Advantage of Mistakes</HD>
<DH>Nonconference: No. 23 Irish score three touchdowns off
Purdue turnovers to win, 24-17, and improve to 2-0.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SOUTH BEND, Ind.</DL>
<LD>With the West Coast offense looking as innovative as the option Notre
Dame abandoned this season, the Irish defense and special teams led
the way again.</LD>
<LD>   Gerome Sapp and Lionel Bolen scored on fumble returns 11 seconds
apart, and Vontez Duff added a 34-yard interception return for a
touchdown as No. 23 Notre Dame beat Purdue, 24-17, Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The Irish, who got off to their worst-ever start last season,
going 0-3, are 2-0 without scoring an offensive touchdown.</LD>
<TE>   "A team with one element not performing as well as you'd like it
to for a variety of reasons, another element has to step up. I think
our football team did that," Notre Dame Coach Tyrone Willingham said.</TE>
<TE>   Purdue (1-1) has lost 13 consecutive games at Notre Dame Stadium
since winning in 1974.</TE>
<TE>   The Boilermakers lost three fumbles and an interception.</TE>
<TE>   Turnovers led to all three Notre Dame touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever I've been around a closely contested football game in
all the years I've been a coach, it comes down to one thing, and that
one thing is turnovers," Purdue Coach Joe Tiller said.</TE>
<TE>   Duff, whose 76-yard punt return against Maryland last week put the
game away, made the decisive play again by picking off Kyle Orton's
pass and returning it for the score.</TE>
<TE>   Sapp was the first to score for Notre Dame, picking up Motrell
Lowe's fumble and returning it 54 yards for a touchdown early in the
second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Sapp broke through three tackles, spinning out of the arms of one
Purdue player, then followed a convoy of seven Irish players into the
end zone.</TE>
<TE>   On the ensuing kickoff, Deaunte Ferrell mishandled a squib kick
and ran back to the one-yard line to pick it up. He ran to his left,
but Notre Dame's Justin Thomas drove Purdue's Drew Rucks back into
Ferrell, and the ball popped free.</TE>
<TE>   Bolen caught the ball in the air at the four-yard line and ran in
for the touchdown to give the Irish a 14-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame's best offensive scoring chance came on its next
possession when it had first and goal on the six-yard line. But Ryan
Grant, who had 86 yards in 21 carries, was tackled for a one-yard
loss, and then he dropped a pass.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Carlyle Holiday ran up the middle for a five-yard
gain, but Willingham settled for the field goal on fourth and two.</TE>
<TE>   The Boilermakers overcame a 17-0 deficit to tie the score, scoring
on a 76-yard punt return and a three-yard run by Jerod Void.</TE>
<TE>   The Boilermakers appeared to have the momentum, since the Fighting
Irish offense couldn't score a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   The Boilermakers turned the ball over twice in the fourth quarter
but still had a chance, driving to the Notre Dame 30 on their final
possession. But they lost six yards on a reverse to Ray Williams,
stalling the drive.</TE>
<TE>   On fourth and 13, Orton was chased hard by Ryan Roberts and threw
the ball away to avoid the sack.</TE>
<TE>   "If we score 17 points, then our defense needs to hold them to
16," Tiller said. "If they score 24 points, then our offense has to
score 25.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a football team, this is not an offense or a defense."</TE>
<TE>   Willingham was just pleased with another win to continue building
the program.</TE>
<TE>   "We did some things well today and we did some things bad today,"
he said. "To be 2-0 right now is a special thing. We will build on
that."</TE>

<HD>Greene's Season of Slow Torture</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Maurice Greene's sixth-place finish in the 100 meters at Friday's
Golden League finale is sure to fuel speculation that the
world-record holder is past his prime.</LD>
<LD>   Greene slowed near the end and was clocked in 10.20 seconds in the
ISTAF meet at Berlin. Winner Dwain Chambers finished in 10.02. It was
the fifth time Chambers, the European champion, had beaten Greene
this season. Last week, Greene was sixth, at 10.11 seconds, in the
Memorial Van Damme meet at Brussels, won by U.S. compatriot Tim
Montgomery in 9.91.</LD>
<LD>   "Greene has run slower this season, but rarely has he looked so
ordinary," the London Telegraph said of Greene's Brussels race. "He
will continue to talk up his chances of retaining his world title in
Paris next August, but after five years of domination, it looks as if
his time at the top is coming to an end."</LD>
<TE>   Steve Cram, the former world-record holder in the mile and 1,500
and now a BBC commentator, agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "Greene is just going through the motions right now," he wrote on
the BBC's Web site. "Greene might not actually get back to where he
was last year or the year before."</TE>
<TE>   Greene said the deaths of his grandmother and uncle and a dispute
with his shoe company have disrupted his training and frame of mind.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been No. 1 in the world for quite a few years, and that puts
a lot of strain on your body," he told the BBC. "I wanted this to be
a recovery year, so I can continue to be the world No. 1 for the next
couple of years. I had no world championships or anything, so I
really wasn't worried about it.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to go out of this sport at the top. I'm not going to
finish eighth, ninth, fifth. I'm going to go out winning, running
fast times."</TE>
<TE>   After his race Friday, Greene withdrew from the Madrid World Cup
meet Sept. 20-21.</TE>
<TE>   "Next year, you will see a totally different person," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Marion Jones of the U.S. (100 meters), Hicham El Guerrouj of
Morocco (1,500), Felix Sanchez of the Dominican Republic (400-meter
hurdles) and Ana Guevara of Mexico (400) won their races Friday. Each
went seven for seven in Golden League meets and earned a share of the
jackpot, 110 pounds of gold bars.</TE>
<TE>   Freestyle Follow-Up</TE>
<TE>   After pulling the U.S. wrestling team out of last week's World
Freestyle Championships in Tehran because of the threat of terrorism,
USA Wrestling officials are hoping Kurt Angle can help provide a
consolation prize of sorts.</TE>
<TE>   They're working to arrange a series of matches pitting U.S.
wrestlers against the new world champions in their respective weight
classes at the Kurt Angle Classic in New Orleans Nov. 8-10. Angle is
the 1996 Olympic heavyweight gold medalist turned WWE headliner.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea was always to bring the top foreign athletes in," USA
Wrestling spokesman Gary Abbott said. "But there will be increased
attempts to make sure we get the winners from Tehran because the
Americans never had a chance to wrestle there. It might give an
indication of how the Americans would have done if they'd had the
opportunity to participate.</TE>
<TE>   "There's money involved too, so it's a way for our athletes to get
at least something back."</TE>
<TE>   Abbott said the U.S. freestyle team, which finished fifth in the
world last year, had been expected to contend for the team title and
challenge for individual medals. He said he didn't know whether any
other teams had withdrawn. U.S. intelligence sources said the U.S.
team had been threatened, not the tournament as a whole. About 40
countries were expected to participate.</TE>
<TE>   Grappling With Issues</TE>
<TE>   The last few weeks have been busy ones for USA Wrestling.</TE>
<TE>   The organization recently launched its first resident training
program for women at the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Colorado
Springs, Colo., welcoming about a dozen women.</TE>
<TE>   That number is expected to be near 20 eventually.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, U.S. and international officials are determining how
to fight a recommendation by the International Olympic Committee task
force that "one of the wrestling disciplines" be dropped from the
Games.</TE>
<TE>   That has been interpreted to mean Greco-Roman wrestling, although
the commission wasn't specific.</TE>
<TE>   As Abbott pointed out, Greco-Roman wrestler Rulon Gardner of the
U.S. was among the most prominent athletes at the Sydney Games
because of his upset of Russia's Alexander Karelin. Gardner,
incidentally, resumed wrestling last week for the first time since
losing a toe to frostbite in February.</TE>
<TE>   He might return to competition at the Kurt Angle Classic or the
Sunkist event next month in Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   "Greco-Roman wrestling is very popular in Europe and Asia," Abbott
said. "I have a feeling the IOC is going to hear not only from the
U.S. but a lot of countries. The wrestling community is very
concerned and upset about the possible elimination of one style."</TE>
<TE>   Death Unexplained</TE>
<TE>   An autopsy on figure skater William Sears, who was found dead in
his Manhattan bedroom Tuesday, was inconclusive, said Terri Levine,
president of the Skating Club of New York.</TE>
<TE>   Levine said Sears' mother, Margarita, had told her Friday the
mystery worsens the family's pain.</TE>
<TE>   "It's torturing them, beyond the torturing one would go through
losing a child," Levine said. "He had not been ill.... He worked out
and felt a little dizzy and that was it."</TE>
<TE>   Sears, 20, teamed with Katie Boxwell to win the U.S. novice pairs
title in January at Los Angeles. They had won medals at two
competitions last month.</TE>
<TE>   Sears, an only child, also operated a music editing business and
attended New York University.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a good skater and a great person, a bright kid," Levine
said.</TE>
<TE>   Levine said the Skating Club of New York would stage a memorial
show and establish a foundation in Sears' name to give financial aid
to U.S. pair skaters.</TE>
<TE>   Here and There</TE>
<TE>   Pair skaters Rena Inoue and John Baldwin Jr., who train in Aliso
Viejo, have changed their schedule. Instead of competing at Skate
America next month, they will skate in Grand Prix events at Germany
and Russia in November. Tiffany Scott and Philip Dulebohn, second at
this year's U.S. competition, will compete at Skate America at
Spokane, Wash., in October and at Trophee Lalique at Paris in
November. Tiffany and Johnnie Stiegler of Manhattan Beach will
compete in Junior Grand Prix events at Montreal this month and at
Germany in October.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. women's water polo team, which lost the gold medal at
Sydney on a late and controversial goal by Australia, is spending
nearly two weeks training with the Aussies in Canberra, the first
step in preparing for the world championships in December at
Australia. Driver Brenda Villa of Commerce is a finalist for the
Women's Sports Foundation's sportswoman-of-the-year award, to be
decided next month.</TE>
<TE>   Pole vaulter Earl Bell, discus thrower Olga Fitkova Connolly,
middle-distance runner Steve Scott and sprinter Gwen Torrence are
among 11 finalists for election to the National Track and Field Hall
of Fame.... Nordic combined Olympian Bill Demong has been released
from a German hospital, where he was taken after he broke his skull
in a swimming accident. He's expected to recover fully.... The U.S.
women's volleyball team won its group title with a 5-0 record at the
world championships in Riesa, Germany.... Kenya's Lornah Kiplagat and
Susan Chepkemi have entered the New York City Marathon, to be run
Nov. 3. Kiplagat is a two-time winner of the Los Angeles Marathon and
won the Osaka Marathon earlier this year.</TE>

<HD>Fife, Oregon Don't Crumble</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Making only his second start for Oregon, Jason Fife already has
learned to stay calm.</LD>
<LD>   Fife was unfazed by his crucial fumble with less than five minutes
to go and stayed levelheaded as he led No. 13 Oregon's late rally to
defeat Fresno State, 28-24, at Eugene, Ore.</LD>
<LD>   Down, 24-22, Fife marched Oregon 43 yards in four plays--capped by
Onterrio Smith's two-yard rumble into the end zone with 1:07 left.</LD>
<TE>   "He didn't let any mistake or turnover get him down. And that's
the mark of a good leader," Oregon Coach Mike Bellotti said.</TE>
<TE>   Fife completed 19 of 34 passes for 303 yards and a touchdown for
the Ducks (2-0), and Smith had 35 carries for 124 yards and two
touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt more at ease and more calm today," said Fife, who has
replaced Joey Harrington at quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   The Bulldogs (1-2) were without starting quarterback Jeff Grady
and star receiver Bernard Berrian because of injuries, but Paul
Pinegar and Deandre Gilbert filled in admirably.</TE>
<TE>   Pinegar completed 16 of 36 passes for 201 yards and two
touchdowns, including first-half touchdown passes of five and 20
yards to Gilbert as the Bulldogs took advantage of Oregon's weak pass
rush.</TE>
<TE>   But, in the end, Fresno State couldn't hold on to the lead.</TE>
<TE>   "We're disappointed, but you can't make excuses," Pinegar said.
"The plays just didn't go our way."</TE>
<TE>   Pinegar replaced Grady, who bruised his right hip in a
season-opening 23-21 loss to Wisconsin, for the second straight week.</TE>
<TE>   Berrian, who sprained his knee against Wisconsin, also didn't
play. He could be back for the Bulldogs' Sept. 21 game at Oregon
State.</TE>
<TE>   The Bulldogs dominated the second quarter, with Asen Asparuhov's
45-yard field goal and Pinegar's 20-yard scoring pass to Gilbert.
Then Fife was sacked on the last play of the half as Fresno State
took a 17-10 lead.</TE>
<TE>   No. 11 Washington State 49, Idaho 14--Devard Darling and Jonathan
Smith each had three touchdowns as the Cougars (2-0) defeated the
Vandals (0-2) in the Battle of the Palouse at Pullman, Wash.</TE>
<TE>   Washington State routed its cross-border rival by sacking Idaho
quarterback Brian Lindgren six times--three by Rien Long.</TE>
<TE>   Lindgren still completed 33 of 49 passes for 267 yards with an
interception, but the Vandals gave up 500 yards for the second
consecutive week. Washington State had 517, a week after Boise State
piled up 503 against Idaho.</TE>
<TE>   Darling, a wide receiver who transferred from Florida State,
caught scoring passes of 15 and 41 yards from Jason Gesser, who was
12 for 16 for 220 yards. Smith, a reserve running back, scored on
runs of one, seven and seven yards. He carried 12 times for 121
yards, including a 52-yard run late in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   No. 14 Washington 34, San Jose State 10--Cody Pickett threw three
touchdown passes after the Huskies (1-1) fell behind 10-0, as they
rallied for the victory over the Spartans (1-1) at Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Washington got its second consecutive 300-yard passing day from
Pickett, who was 22 for 35 for 347 yards. Reggie Williams caught six
passes for 160 yards and two TDs, and Rich Alexis ran for 125 yards.</TE>
<TE>   The first two times Washington had the ball in the third quarter,
Pickett threw touchdown passes of 22 yards to Wilbur Hooks and 21
yards to Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Boston College 34, Stanford 27--Derrick Knight's 12-yard touchdown
run with 36 seconds left at Boston lifted the Eagles (2-0) to a
comeback victory over the Cardinal (0-1),which lost in the debut of
Coach Buddy Teevens, who took over when Tyrone Willingham left for
Notre Dame.</TE>
<TE>   Knight, who lost the starting job during preseason, came off the
bench and ran for 104 yards in 21 carries. He capped a five-play,
65-yard drive by bursting up the middle for the game-winning score.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford freshman quarterback Kyle Matter completed 17 of 27
passes for 244 yards and one TD. Starting quarterback Chris Lewis was
serving a one-game suspension for an NCAA rules violation.</TE>
<TE>   California 34, New Mexico State 13--Kyle Boller threw for 180
yards and two touchdowns as the Golden Bears got off to their first
2-0 start in five years by defeating the Aggies (0-2) at Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Igber rushed for 87 yards and Boller completed 19 of 32 passes
and rushed for a fourth-quarter touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona State 46, Central Florida 13--Andrew Walter came off the
bench to throw two touchdown passes to Shaun McDonald as the Sun
Devils (2-1) defeated the Golden Knights (0-2) at Tempe, Ariz.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona State, which trailed, 13-10, put the game away with a
29-point outburst in 5:21 of the third quarter capped by consecutive
interception returns for scores by Josh Amobi and Connor Banks.</TE>

<HD>League Has Multiplied Into Long Divisions</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New season, new team, new divisions, new rivalries. What the world
needs now is an NFL Realignment Primer ...</LD>
<LD>   AFC EAST</LD>
<LD>   New lineup: Buffalo, Miami, New England, New York Jets.</LD>
<TE>   Who moved? Indianapolis got shipped to the AFC South. Eighteen
years after pulling out of Baltimore, the Colts get their
comeuppance.</TE>
<TE>   Geographically correct? Almost. City of Baltimore emerged from NFL
realignment still east of Buffalo.</TE>
<TE>   Realignment winner: Buffalo. Had they wanted to borrow a page from
the old Soviet playbook, the NFL czars could have easily grouped
Buffalo together with Pittsburgh, Cincinnati and Cleveland to form
Siberia East. Instead, the czars were merciful and the Bills get to
keep their annual, and vital, weekend passes to sunny Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Realignment loser: New England Coach Bill Belichick, who must not
have been told Buffalo was not AFC North-bound before he agreed to
trade Drew Bledsoe to the Bills.</TE>
<TE>   Best new rivalry: Bledsoe versus Belichick.</TE>
<TE>   How they'll finish: Patriots (underrated again), Dolphins (new
running back, same finish), Jets (Vinny Testaverde turns 39 in
November), Bills (I fear for Drew Bledsoe).</TE>
<TE>   AFC NORTH</TE>
<TE>   New lineup: Baltimore, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   Who moved? This is two-thirds of the old AFC Central, with
Jacksonville and Tennessee sliding to the AFC South.</TE>
<TE>   Geographically correct? Hardly. Entire division is south of
Buffalo and Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Realignment winner: Pittsburgh. With Tennessee gone, and Baltimore
picking up the pieces from a salary cap that went boom, Steelers look
a lock for first place.</TE>
<TE>   Realignment loser: Cincinnati. Bengals' petition to move to the
Mid-American Conference was denied.</TE>
<TE>   Best new rivalry: Brian Billick (reality 2002) versus Brian
Billick (legend in his own mind).</TE>
<TE>   How they'll finish: Steelers (could go 6-0 in the North), Browns
(unless Kelly Holcomb is still starting in October), Ravens (unless
Jeff Blake isn't starting by October), Bengals (same as it ever was).</TE>
<TE>   AFC SOUTH</TE>
<TE>   New lineup: Houston, Indianapolis, Jacksonville, Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   Who moved? Everybody. Indianapolis moved from the AFC East.
Jacksonville and Tennessee moved from the AFC Central. Houston moved
in after Los Angeles refused to move on the NFL's expansion offer.</TE>
<TE>   Geographically correct? Not quite. Miami looks up at the entire
division.</TE>
<TE>   Realignment winner: Indianapolis, which suddenly has a chance to
finish first. Not so had the Colts stayed in the East.</TE>
<TE>   Realignment loser: Los Angeles. Those guys with the cows on their
heads getting plowed by the Cowboys today? L.A., they could have been
all yours.</TE>
<TE>   Best new rivalry: Indianapolis versus Tennessee. Peyton Manning
goes home.</TE>
<TE>   How they'll finish: Titans (provided Eddie George holds up through
December), Colts (Tony Dungy knows defense), Jaguars (Fred Taylor
injury watch begins today), Texans (well, they look better than
Carolina).</TE>
<TE>   AFC WEST</TE>
<TE>   New lineup: Denver, Kansas City, Oakland, San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Who moved? Seattle, returning to its birthplace, the NFC West.</TE>
<TE>   Geographically correct? Yes. And it still will be--NFL leaders
have vision--when the Chargers move to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Realignment winner: San Diego, which nearly was switched to the
NFC West, where the Chargers would have spent the rest of their days
looking up at St. Louis and San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Realignment loser: Seattle, where the Seahawks will spend the rest
of their days looking up at St. Louis and San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Best new rivalry: Brian Griese versus Steve Beuerlein. Suddenly,
the Broncos have quarterback issues.</TE>
<TE>   How they'll finish: Broncos (depending on the outcome of
Griese-Beuerlein), Raiders (welcome to Network Associates Coliseum,
where every game's the Senior Bowl), Chargers (Brees is the right
move), Chiefs (Priest Holmes: man or mirage?).</TE>
<TE>   NFC EAST</TE>
<TE>   New lineup: Dallas, New York Giants, Philadelphia, Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Who moved? Arizona, to the NFC West. Assuming anyone noticed.</TE>
<TE>   Geographically correct? Dallas east of San Francisco, Seattle,
Arizona and that's it.</TE>
<TE>   Realignment winner: Dallas, which preserved all its old NFC East
rivalries and resisted crazed notion to dump Cowboys in with Houston,
Arizona and New Orleans to form the NFC Southwest.</TE>
<TE>   Realignment loser: Everyone will miss those home-and-homes with
the Cardinals.</TE>
<TE>   Best new rivalry: Steve Spurrier versus everybody.</TE>
<TE>   How they'll finish: Eagles (but the Super Bowl can wait), Redskins
(one way or the another, Spurrier's going to be great fun), Giants
(get the ball to Shockey), Cowboys (one more time: Quincy Carter).</TE>
<TE>   NFC NORTH</TE>
<TE>   New lineup: Chicago-Champaign, Detroit, Green Bay, Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   Who moved? Tampa Bay high-tailed it to the NFC South, and could
hardly wait.</TE>
<TE>   Geographically correct? Yes, although from the Chicago Bears' fan
perspective, that 150-mile drive south to Champaign is pushing it.</TE>
<TE>   Realignment winner: Detroit. Guaranteed to move up from fifth
place this season.</TE>
<TE>   Realignment loser: Chicago. Bears will play all home games in
Champaign until construction workers realign Soldier Field.</TE>
<TE>   Best new rivalry: Bear fans versus Sunday traffic.</TE>
<TE>   How they'll finish: Packers (until Terry Glenn goes down and out
and doesn't come back), Bears (Champaign loves Chris Chandler),
Vikings (higher if Mike Tice somehow can get Randy Moss' attention),
Lions (Harrington-McMahon an improvement over Detmer-Batch).</TE>
<TE>   NFC SOUTH</TE>
<TE>   New lineup: Atlanta, Carolina, New Orleans, Tampa Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Who moved? NFL took all the teams in NFC West that shouldn't have
been in NFC West and put them with Tampa Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Geographically correct? Yes, and Falcons, Panthers and Saints say
it's about time.</TE>
<TE>   Realignment winner: Tampa Bay. No more questions about why the
Buccaneers can't win a cold-weather division game on the road.</TE>
<TE>   Realignment loser: Carolina. Six times in this division in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Best new rivalry: Atlanta versus Tampa Bay. Warrick Dunn, anyone?</TE>
<TE>   How they'll finish: Buccaneers (NFC South's only team to have won
more than seven games last season), Falcons (Michael Vick's a year
away, assuming he gets there in one piece), Saints (it's all on Aaron
Brooks now), Panthers (last season's 1-15 looking awfully good now).</TE>
<TE>   NFC WEST</TE>
<TE>   New lineup: Arizona, St. Louis, San Francisco, Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Who moved? Sixty percent of the NFC West--Falcons, Saints,
Panthers--went south, a little sooner than the norm during the
regular season. Arizona came in from the NFC East. Seattle returned
home after 25 years in the AFC West.</TE>
<TE>   Geographically correct? They finally got it right, except for the
Rams. Anaheim is west of Dallas. St. Louis is not.</TE>
<TE>   Realignment winner: St. Louis and San Francisco (tie). Rams and
49ers look playoff-bound through the decade.</TE>
<TE>   Realignment loser: Seattle. Seahawks might have had a chance this
season in the AFC West.</TE>
<TE>   Best new rivalry: St. Louis versus Arizona, which stole the
Cardinals from St. Louis, which is why St. Louis stole the Rams from
Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   How they'll finish: Rams (no one's really worried about that 0-4
exhibition season, right?), 49ers (hey, they're already 1-0),
Seahawks (new uniforms look good), Cardinals (and they say there's no
stability in the NFL today).</TE>

<HD>A Quarterback Controversy, or Is He Just Pushing Paus'
Buttons?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Plaschke</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The two most delicious words for a fan, yet the most unsettling words
for a program, surfaced late Saturday from the chaos of a UCLA
comeback.</LD>
<LD>   Quarterback controversy.</LD>
<LD>   They were, not coincidentally, accompanied by two other juicy
words.</LD>
<TE>   Coaching controversy.</TE>
<TE>   Sixty minutes into a new Bruin season, and we're already having
way too much fun.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Toledo, either totally inspired or completely nuts, benched
Cory Paus after his best drive against Colorado State. And handed a
fourth-quarter deficit to a, um, er, freshman....</TE>
<TE>   Drew Olson, either savvy or blessed, drove the team to the
go-ahead touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   At which point Paus, either angry or determined, re-entered the
game and led the Bruins to two more touchdowns in an eventual 30-19
victory.</TE>
<TE>   Confused yet?</TE>
<TE>   Join a crowd of 58,078.</TE>
<TE>   During a typically batty Bruin game at the Rose Bowl, fans booed
Paus, then cheered Olson, then booed Toledo, then cheered Paus.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, everyone finally agreed on something--a roar--when
Brandon Chillar nailed Ram quarterback Bradlee Van Pelt on a tying
two-point conversion attempt in the final two minutes.</TE>
<TE>   But talk about exhausting.</TE>
<TE>   And this was before everyone tried to explain it.</TE>
<TE>   Said Toledo: "There is no quarterback controversy. Cory Paus is
the quarterback. But we now have a guy who we're not afraid to put in
there."</TE>
<TE>   Said Paus: "I'm the quarterback. He's the quarterback of the
future."</TE>
<TE>   Said Olson, a kid from northern California: "Cory is the
quarterback. I have to be ready if he gets hurt."</TE>
<TE>   Right.</TE>
<TE>   Yet with the first game of the most important autumn of his
coaching career on the line, Toledo gives the ball to the
19-year-old?</TE>
<TE>   This wasn't mopping up. This wasn't the one throwaway series that
Toledo had promised for Olson. This wasn't a tryout.</TE>
<TE>   This was real, so real that even other players are thinking, if
Toledo would use Olson in that risky situation so soon in the
season....</TE>
<TE>   "Man, he must see something in him," said safety Matt Ware.</TE>
<TE>   You think?</TE>
<TE>   Toledo acknowledged that he had only promised Olson one series,
and said it was going to be in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   But he said he didn't want to put him in after Paus threw an
interception because it would make Paus look bad.</TE>
<TE>   And then the Bruins roughed the Ram kicker on their ensuing
possession and couldn't get the ball before the end of the half.</TE>
<TE>   "So at halftime, we talked about Cory going out there for one
series, then Drew coming in," said Toledo.</TE>
<TE>   Paus, who was awful in the first half, completed five consecutive
passes on that first drive. The only reason the Bruins didn't score
was that kicker Chris Griffith, as part of a dreadful night for Bruin
special teams, missed his second field goal.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't matter.</TE>
<TE>   "Drew was standing on the sidelines next to me in the first half,
and I would ask him what play he would call, and he would get them
all right," Toledo said. "I was very impressed."</TE>
<TE>   So on the next series, Olson was given the ball. Four plays, one
sack and one bad pass later, he was out, and that was that.</TE>
<TE>   Or was it?</TE>
<TE>   "I thought he looked pretty good, that we could give him a little
more time," said Toledo.</TE>
<TE>   On UCLA's next possession, early in the fourth quarter, with the
Bruins still trailing, 13-7, and the ball around midfield ... Olson
was still the quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   But this is a football game, not the SAT. And while quarterbacks
with no college experience are fun stories, they are rarely
championship stories....</TE>
<TE>   Olson interrupted those thoughts by completing two passes for 24
yards on a 52-yard drive that resulted in Akil Harris' one-yard
touchdown run.</TE>
<TE>   Bringing on, you guessed it, Paus. The veteran played the rest of
the game, led UCLA to two more touchdowns, and Toledo walked off the
field smiling and winking like a mad inventor.</TE>
<TE>   "Thank God it worked," Paus said. "If it had not worked, there
would have been some tough, tough questions."</TE>
<TE>   What happens now? The only thing certain: Saturday's game
exponentially increased the drama that has engulfed one of this
town's most intriguing coach-player relationships.</TE>
<TE>   Watching Paus and Toledo this season will be like watching that
crotchety old couple next door.</TE>
<TE>   We'll hear grumbling. We'll sense discomfort. We'll wish for
peace. After all these years, that will probably be impossible.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo is an offensive scientist. Paus is sandlot.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo is precision. Paus is impromptu.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo says to-may-toe, Paus says ... well, Paus says ketchup.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps because Toledo was unhappy with Paus' failure to disclose
his drunk-driving arrest and subsequent jail sentence last year, Paus
is not one of the seven players featured on the front and back covers
of this year's media guide.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine that. A Toledo team unwilling to feature a senior
quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the spring and fall, Toledo also seemed unwilling to
guarantee Paus a starting spot even though his top two backups are
freshmen.</TE>
<TE>   Guess he was serious.</TE>

<LD>Brian Stevens passed for a school-record six touchdowns and wide
receiver Whitney Lewis scored two touchdowns to lead Ventura St.
Bonaventure High to a 52-0 victory over Dos Palos on Saturday night
in season-opening football game at Ventura High.</LD>
<LD>   The win was the 43rd in a row for St. Bonaventure, the three-time
defending Southern Section Division XI champion that was playing its
first game in four years without record-breaking running back Lorenzo
Booker.</LD>
<LD>   Booker is redshirting at Florida State.</LD>
<TE>   "The offense really played well," Coach Jon Mack said. "[Dos
Palos] gave us the ball a few times and we were able to run them into
some big scores."</TE>
<TE>   Dos Palos won its fifth consecutive Central Section Sequoia
Division championship last year, but the Broncos were hit hard by
graduation and fumbled five times.</TE>
<TE>   St. Bonaventure led, 46-0, at halftime and scored touchdowns on
its first eight possessions before pulling its starters.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis, a highly regarded recruit, had 10 receptions for 167 yards
and two touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   His first touchdown came with 4 minutes 11 seconds left in the
first half when he made a one-handed catch over two defenders in the
left corner of the end zone to complete an eight-yard scoring play.</TE>
<TE>   Stevens, a 6-foot-3, left-handed junior, completed 20 of 25 passes
for 330 yards. His six touchdowns broke the school record of five set
by Teohua Sanchez in 1996.</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Serena Williams has become the most compelling female athlete in the
world, a master of both her sport and her public, a woman of
extraordinary physical strength and charismatic personality.</LD>
<LD>   She is an African American woman unafraid to become a stunning
blond and to wear pink. She is able to knock the fuzz off tennis
balls and Saturday night she was willing to reduce her older sister,
Venus Williams, to tennis rubble.</LD>
<LD>   "My backhand is great now," Serena would say after beating Venus,
6-4, 6-3, in the final of the U.S. Open. "I want you to know that."</LD>
<TE>   We know. We also know that right now Serena, 20, owns women's
tennis with her backhand, her forehand, her crafty serving and her
unending smile.</TE>
<TE>   Before the Open, Serena had made herself substantially better than
all the other women not named Williams. And on this night, filled
with more music, more singing, more pomp than tennis, Serena also
proved that she has become substantially better than her sister.</TE>
<TE>   It took Serena only 1 hour 12 minutes to finish off Venus, 22.
Serena was not afraid of thumping her sister, of walloping forehands
at Venus' stomach, of slamming overheads at Venus' feet.</TE>
<TE>   By the second set, the record crowd of 23,164 was trying to
whisper its cheers for Serena so as not to make Venus feel so bad.</TE>
<TE>   But for a twisted ankle that kept her out of the Australian Open,
Serena might have been receiving congratulations as the first woman
to sweep the four Grand Slam tournaments since Steffi Graf in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   Now she is talking about the "Serena Slam," which would match the
"Tiger Slam." Serena, who won her fourth Grand Slam title and became
only the sixth woman to win three straight Slams, is planning to win
the 2003 Australian Open and hold close to her heart all four
trophies together.</TE>
<TE>   It seems hard to imagine, after the way Serena dominated this
Open, that anything other than an injury could stop her.</TE>
<TE>   The Serena we've seen here for two weeks has been wisely
analytical about her game, intelligently aware of the world around
her and charmingly insouciant about the host of silly questions that
were tossed at her about clothing, hairstyles and other girlish
things.</TE>
<TE>   This Serena was gracious after every win and unwilling to admit
that she has stepped significantly ahead of her sister, a kindness
that Venus surely appreciated.</TE>
<TE>   So often athletes are spoken of as role models and too often they
fall woefully short of such expectations.</TE>
<TE>   This Serena is going to make a very good role model.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, when baseball great Henry Aaron came to the women's
semifinals, Serena was asked if she had grown up admiring Aaron. So
many young athletes in many sports, even baseball, would have looked
up blankly and said no, or even worse, professed not to have heard of
Aaron.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't say I really knew at the time," Serena said, "but
obviously I know who he is. I really, really do admire Hank Aaron. I
was watching a program about him a while back. I've read a lot of
things about him. That's really cool."</TE>
<TE>   Six years ago, before Venus and Serena were full-time members of
the women's tour, Richard Williams, the girls' father and coach, sat
in a tennis club outside Chicago and said, quite seriously, that
Serena was going to be the better player and bigger champion.</TE>
<TE>   As he has been about so many things having to do with his talented
daughters, Richard has turned out to be right.</TE>
<TE>   Venus came here reaching for her third consecutive U.S. Open
title. But she also arrived here having lost both the French Open and
Wimbledon finals to her little sister. In the fourth round Venus was
nearly beaten by Chanda Rubin in a two-hour match played at an
incredible pace.</TE>
<TE>   "My game went down after that fourth round," Venus said. "I just
couldn't do a thing to bring it back up. Before, in the first, second
and third rounds, I was playing great. But after that, I just
couldn't do anything to bring it back."</TE>
<TE>   Venus was pushed to three sets and two hours in the semifinals,
too, by Amelie Mauresmo. Like Rubin, Mauresmo challenged Venus at the
net and put constant pressure on her.</TE>
<TE>   What has happened at this Open is that instead of the Big Two, we
have the Only One. Venus has become just another challenger, like
Mauresmo, Lindsay Davenport and Jennifer Capriati, another competitor
sent home to find some new gear to keep up with Serena.</TE>
<TE>   In a note that sounded almost as if it were surrender, Venus said
that Serena very much enjoys the hubbub and attention that goes with
being No. 1. "I don't like it much," said Venus, who lost her No. 1
ranking to Serena after Wimbledon. "She's more of an outgoing person,
maybe, than what I am. Everyone has their year and this is her year.
And next year could be her year also."</TE>
<TE>   That's how Serena is thinking. Instead of feeling sorry about the
bad ankle that kept her out of the 2002 Australian Open, Serena found
the upside. "Maybe it was meant to happen this way," she said.
"Because now when I go to Australia I can just gain tons of [ranking]
points. So I just start over. I'm still young."</TE>
<TE>   Young but wise and talented and smiling the biggest smile you've
ever seen.</TE>

<HD>South Carolina Turns Over Game</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>South Carolina Coach Lou Holtz has seen a lot in his 26 college
seasons, but seven turnovers by his team was something new.</LD>
<LD>   Virginia converted three turnovers into Matt Schaub touchdown
passes in a 34-21 victory over 22nd-ranked South Carolina Saturday
night at Charlottesville, Va.</LD>
<LD>   "I've been in this game a long time, and I don't ever remember
being in a situation like this," Holtz said. "There were times we
didn't have nearly that many turnovers in a season."</LD>
<TE>   Virginia, which began its season with three opponents currently
ranked in the Top 25, avoided its first 0-3 start since 1982.</TE>
<TE>   Billy McMullen, a 6-foot-4 receiver who struggled to get open in
the first two games, took advantage of South Carolina's smaller
secondary, catching four passes for 72 yards. McMullen had a 35-yard
touchdown reception and another of his catches was a one-hander on
third-and-11 on a pass thrown well behind him.</TE>
<TE>   "Even when I don't make the perfect throw, I know he'll make the
play," Schaub said. "It's a good security blanket."</TE>
<TE>   South Carolina (1-1) fumbled six times and threw an interception.
Two of the turnovers came deep in Virginia territory.</TE>
<TE>   No. 4 Tennessee 26, Middle Tennessee 3--Cedric Houston ran for a
touchdown and Jason Witten scored on a pass from Casey Clausen for
the Volunteers (2-0) at Knoxville, Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   After the offense faltered in the second half, the Tennessee
defense added a safety on a blocked punt and fumble recovery in the
end zone.</TE>
<TE>   The Volunteers had 400 total yards, but much of that came in
building a 17-0 lead by the middle of the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Then Tennessee started to make mistakes, with Houston and Clausen
losing fumbles on consecutive possessions and Phillip Newman missing
on two field goal attempts. But Middle Tennessee (0-2)--playing the
Volunteers for the first time--couldn't take advantage.</TE>
<TE>   No. 24 Louisiana State 35, The Citadel 10--Domanick Davis ran for
two touchdowns for theTigers (1-1) at Baton Rouge, La.</TE>
<TE>   Division I-AA The Citadel (0-1) was outscored, 21-0, and
outgained, 317-106, in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   The Bulldogs only made it past midfield once in the half, and then
only to the LSU 49-yard line.</TE>
<TE>   Mississippi 38, Memphis 16--Eli Manning shook off another slow
start to throw for three touchdowns and 174 yards, and Robert
Williams rushed for 107 yards to lead the Rebels at Oxford, Miss.</TE>
<TE>   Mississippi (2-0) has won nine of the last 11 games with Memphis
(1-1).</TE>
<TE>   Manning, who started 0 for 5 against Louisiana Monroe last week,
completed his first pass, then threw seven consecutive incompletions.</TE>
<TE>   Midway through the second quarter, he was six for 18, but threw
touchdown passes on Mississippi's last two drives of the half.</TE>
<TE>   Manning, who finished 14 for 30 with no interceptions, received
treatment for a swollen knee after the game.</TE>
<TE>   He scrambled for eight yards on the second play of the game and
three defenders hit him when he opted not to slide.</TE>
<TE>   Kentucky 77, Texas El Paso 17--Ten different Kentucky players
scored touchdowns at Lexington, Ky., as the Wildcats scored the
second-most points in school history. Kentucky beat North Dakota,
83-0, in 1950.</TE>
<TE>   Jared Lorenzen threw touchdown passes of seven, 12, 35, 49 and 58
yards, all to different receivers.</TE>
<TE>   Kentucky improved to 2-0 for the first time since 1998. Texas El
Paso is 1-1</TE>
<TE>   Auburn 56, Western Carolina 0--Carnell Williams rushed for
first-quarter touchdowns of 20 and 42 yards at Auburn, Ala., as the
Tigers (1-1) ended a losing streak dating to last season at four.</TE>
<TE>   Auburn had 335 yards in the first half--five days after gaining
only 35 in the second half against USC.</TE>
<TE>   Division I-AA Western Carolina is 1-1.</TE>
<TE>   Arkansas 41, Boise State 14--Matt Jones threw three touchdown
passes at Fayetteville, Ark., for the Razorbacks in their season
opener.</TE>
<TE>   Boise State (0-2) lost quarterback Ryan Dinwiddie early in the
second quarter to a sprained ankle and didn't score until the fourth
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Vanderbilt 49, Furman 18--Bobby Johnson beat his old team at
Nashville, Tenn., for his first victory as the Commodore coach.
Johnson was coach for Division I-AA Furman for eight seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Jay Cutler ran for three touchdowns and threw two scoring passes
to Dan Stricker to lead to Vanderbilt (1-1) to its biggest home
opener victory since 1950.</TE>

<HD>That Seat Toledo Is On Can Run Hot and Cold</HD>
<DH></DH>

<LD>I know it was a pleasant evening in the Rose Bowl, but I wasn't
surprised when they brought out six huge cooling fans for the Bruin
sideline, because everyone knows Coach Bob Toledo is on the hot seat.</LD>
<LD>   Times reporter Steve Henson went so far as to check the Internet
and reported last Sunday there were 184 media references linking "Bob
Toledo" to "hot seat," which explains, I guess, why Toledo made no
move to sit down in the Rose Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   If you're in Toledo's position I would imagine you can't afford to
ever sit down again. Back in the days when "The Simers and Plaschke
Show" was on the air--a preview as we know now to "American Idol"--we
were only kidding when we asked Toledo to sit in the hot seat. He
avoided us, however, and while I thought he just didn't like Bill
Plaschke, now I understand.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I WAS hoping to run into basketball Coach Steve Lavin at the
Bruins' game so I could talk to an expert about the hot seat, but a
school official said if he was at the game, no one would know it.
Sounds like the witness protection program to me.</TE>
<TE>   Lavin, of course, bobs and weaves his way through every season
while wearing a target on his back, but this is going to be something
new for Toledo, losing his job in the first quarter and then getting
it back in the second every week.</TE>
<TE>   For example, when Akil Harris fumbled the opening kickoff twice,
Tab Perry dropped a pass on the Bruins' first offensive play and
Colorado State went up, 10-0, you know someone expressed dismay that
Rick Neuheisel had just extended his contract.</TE>
<TE>   With 13:37 remaining in the second quarter, the Bruins ran a
well-timed reverse, Junior Taylor scored, and boy oh boy, old Bob
fooled them once again.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   IT'S BEEN well-documented that Toledo has some of the best boxers
and poorest decision makers in college football, who at times park
wherever they want. UCLA has gone 17-17 the last three seasons, and I
know Teflon Bob's record for going through defensive coordinators.</TE>
<TE>   But Toledo has given Bruin fans some thrills some schools will
never experience--twice putting them into national championship
contention with a 10-0 start in 1998 and a 6-0 run a year ago. He
directed his team to 20 consecutive wins in a time when parity
dictates upset after upset, proving he knows how to put together a
major college program.</TE>
<TE>   He has had key performers let him down and he failed to regroup as
team leader in his own right last year, but asking 18-to 21-year-olds
to determine your own level of success is still not an exact science.</TE>
<TE>   And so what did Toledo do for you lately? Wait until the next
offensive play, and it just might go all the way. UCLA football on a
Saturday night in the Rose Bowl is still a pretty rousing show.</TE>
<TE>   To make him a victim, or even an alleged victim, of this new
national sport that has fans and media guessing who might lose their
job before the first pass is thrown, is losing all perspective of a
college game designed only to entertain.</TE>
<TE>   That's something I'd expect from a USC fan.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   IF THE Rose Bowl is serious about bringing an NFL team here,
officials better invest in a sound system that can be understood, or
ask sideline announcer John Ireland to remove the marbles from his
mouth when speaking on the big scoreboards.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I HAD the Dodgers eliminated from playoff contention on Feb. 10.</TE>
<TE>   Then again on April 2, and once more on April 4 after three
straight defeats against the Giants. I also considered them goners on
May 18, June 8, July 24, Aug. 6, 13, 20 and 26. Somewhere in there, I
believe I started calling them "choking dogs." You know, whatever it
took to motivate the guys.</TE>
<TE>   So go ahead and add Sept. 7 to the list, because after Saturday's
ho-hum performance against Houston in a 6-1 defeat, our slugs appear
once again to be lacking in motivation, offense and the finishing
kick to make the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ONE YEAR ago today the Dodgers fell out of first place in the
wild-card race, never to climb back on top. They begin play today
with a two-game lead on the Giants with 21 to play, and while they
probably still entertain the idea of overtaking Arizona, the
Diamondbacks' magic number (any combination of Dodger losses and
Arizona wins) to eliminate L.A. from title contention is 17.</TE>
<TE>   I mention this because I'm not sure Manager Jim Tracy is aware the
season is almost over. The Dodgers are a different team--a winning
team--with Dave Roberts in the leadoff position, but Tracy rested
Roberts so he'll be fresh when it comes time to golf this off-season,
while asking Marquis Grissom to open the game and do what he does
best--strike out.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy knows I'm available for consultation, but for some reason he
hasn't called.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TYLER HOUSTON is giving Mike Trombley a run for worst mid-season
acquisition during the Dan Evans' era as general manager of the
Dodgers. Trombley went 0-4 with a 6.56 earned-run average last season
after joining the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   Houston went four for four in his Dodger debut, but since then has
compiled a .143 batting average. He hit into a double play to end
Saturday's game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   JUST THINK if the Chargers were already Our Team and we were
waking up excited today for the first Sunday of the NFL season and
Our Team was only a 2 1/2-point underdog to the Bungles.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes from Janeice Imm:</TE>
<TE>   "As a 'hick' from Nebraska, I just wanted to respond to your
article in The Times that was reprinted in our local newspaper ... "</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>They are called "friendlies," exhibition soccer matches that are
played with no trophies or championships on the line, ideally for the
sake of promoting the sport and goodwill. For obvious reasons, North
and South Korea hadn't played one in almost a decade.</LD>
<LD>   Two months ago, on the same day South Korea was making history by
becoming the first Asian team to compete in the World Cup's
third-place game, North and South Korea battleships exchanged
gunfire. Fans inside Seoul's sold-out Sangam World Cup Stadium that
night paused for a moment of silence to remember the four South
Korean sailors who had been killed in the sea battle.</LD>
<LD>   Saturday in Seoul, inside the same stadium, North and South Korean
players exchanged handshakes, fans waved Korea unification flags and
the two nations finally engaged in their long-awaited--and, for once,
aptly named--friendly, playing to a 0-0 draw before a crowd of
60,000.</LD>
<TE>   The match, billed by organizers as "South-North Unification
Soccer," was an extension of a political agreement forged last month,
designed to revive reconciliation between the long-hostile countries.
It was the first soccer match between the nations since 1993.</TE>
<TE>   "No Matter Which Side Wins, We Are One Nation!" read one large
banner hanging inside the stadium. Fans chanted "United Fatherland!"
and waved small unification flags featuring a blue Korean peninsula
on a white background. Players for both teams wore similar flags on
their uniforms.</TE>
<TE>   South Korea, which lost to Turkey in the World Cup third-place
match, progressed farther than any Asian nation in the 72-year
history of the tournament. Previously, Asia's best showing was the
1966 quarterfinal appearance by North Korea. Both teams upset Italy
during their unlikely runs.</TE>
<TE>   "We made it to the quarterfinals of the World Cup in 1966 and the
South Koreans proved themselves the best in Asia at the World Cup
[this year]," North Korea Coach Ri Jung-man told reporters after the
match. "Together, we are the best in Asia."</TE>
<TE>   North Korea has yet to return to the World Cup and appeared
undermanned against South Korea, which started six key players from
its World Cup squad. But the North Koreans played inspired defense
and held off a late charge by South Korea, which freed Kim Eun-jung
for the potential game-winner in the 74th minute, only to have Kim's
shot carry just over the crossbar.</TE>
<TE>   Guus Hiddink, the South Korean World Cup coach who became a
national icon during the summer, returned for the match in his new
role as special advisor to his successor, Park Hangseo. After the
World Cup, Hiddink resigned from the South Korean team to coach the
Dutch club team PSV Eindhoven.</TE>
<TE>   Euro Shockers</TE>
<TE>   Anarchy in the UK, international soccer-style:</TE>
<TE>   Wales 2, Finland 0.</TE>
<TE>   Faroe Islands 2, Scotland 2.</TE>
<TE>   Those results from Saturday's opening round of qualifiers for the
2004 European Championship had fans all over the United Kingdom
talking, or gnashing bicuspids, depending on national affiliation.</TE>
<TE>   Wales, which hasn't qualified for a major international soccer
tournament since the 1958 World Cup, stunned Finland with a two-goal
victory in Helsinki, moving the Welsh into a share of the early lead
in Group 9 with Italy, a 2-0 winner over Azerbaijan. Goals by John
Hartson in the 31st minute and Simon Davies in the 73rd secured the
victory for Wales, extending the national team's unbeaten streak to
six games.</TE>
<TE>   Scotland, meanwhile, is staring at a six-game winless streak after
a horrid performance against the tiny Faroe Islands, ranked 123rd in
the FIFA world rankings. Playing at home in Toftir, the Faroe Islands
actually led, 2-0, on a pair of goals by John Petersen in the first
11 minutes--and nearly led, 3-0, when Petersen fired high on an open
net from 10 yards out.</TE>
<TE>   Scotland had to rally behind second-half goals by Paul Lambert and
Barry Ferguson to escape with a tie and a point. The draw kept new
coach Berti Vogts winless (0-5-1) in his first six matches with the
Scottish national team. The five consecutive defeats comprised the
longest losing streak in Scotland's 130-year history of international
soccer.</TE>
<TE>   "We played only 45 minutes," Vogts groused. "I cannot understand
what happened and why we did not keep up to speed in the first half.
We played without emotion, we made many mistakes."</TE>
<TE>   Scotland could be playing Vogts, the former German national team
player and coach, out of a job. Scotland already trails Germany, a
2-0 winner over Lithuania, by two points in Group 5.</TE>
<TE>   Ugliness In Moscow</TE>
<TE>   Violence again broke out in Moscow surrounding another performance
by the Russian national team, this time during the hours preceding a
4-2 home victory over Ireland in a Euro 2004 qualifier Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Interfax news agency, quoting local police, at
least 12 visiting fans were injured in fights with Russian supporters
outside a hotel near Red Square where many Irish fans were staying.</TE>
<TE>   Three Irish supporters and one Dutch fan were hospitalized and at
least six Russian fans were arrested, according to police.</TE>
<TE>   One man was stabbed and more than 100 others injured during a June
riot in Moscow after Russia's World Cup loss to Japan.</TE>

<HD>Sampras and Agassi Are Thirtysomething Else</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>There were so many unexpected lessons, so many myths shattered in one
sun-baked afternoon at the U.S. Open. But, first and foremost, so
much for the supposed expiration date of a once-great rivalry.</LD>
<LD>   The shelf life of the always-evolving rivalry between Pete Sampras
and Andre Agassi was extended Saturday, much to the delight of
network executives and to the genuine surprise of the sport. If men's
tennis needed a life raft in 2002, better late than not at all.</LD>
<LD>   Finally, a final will feel like a final. Major figures will play
for a major title when Sampras and Agassi meet in the U.S. Open final
today. Sampras, seeded 17th, has often been one step ahead of Agassi
in their careers, and he was again, reaching the final first, beating
Sjeng Schalken of the Netherlands, 7-6 (6), 7-6 (4), 6-2, in 2 hours
24 minutes. He had 23 aces and never lost his serve.</LD>
<TE>   Agassi, seeded sixth, had the more difficult assignment, facing
defending champion and No. 1-ranked Lleyton Hewitt of Australia, who
had beaten him the last three times they'd met. Hitting cleanly and
powerfully, Agassi upset Hewitt, 6-4, 7-6 (5), 6-7 (1), 6-2, in the
2-hour 59-minute second semifinal and looked like a giddy teenager
afterward, not a 32-year-old with a wife and child.</TE>
<TE>   "This is New York, baby," Agassi said. "Where else would you
rather be? This is it. I've worked all year thinking about this. And
Pete. We're both here again. It's going to be a blast."</TE>
<TE>   Together again, naturally.</TE>
<TE>   Agassi blew kisses to the camera. Sampras smiled and shook his
fist in jubilation and frequently nodded after hitting a service
winner or volley on a big point. He kept the faith in his game, even
when many did not after his drought had reached 33 tournaments
without a title.</TE>
<TE>   Famous wives, fatherhood, career moves, coaching changes and,
well, hair loss have served as more of a link lately between Sampras
and Agassi since their last meeting here last year in the
quarterfinals, which Sampras won in four sets. This was seen as an
outgrowth of aging--Agassi turned 32 in April; Sampras became 31 last
month.</TE>
<TE>   When they exited on the same day at Wimbledon in June, in the
second round, the thought of Sampras and Agassi meeting in the U.S.
Open final would have been inconceivable.</TE>
<TE>   This will be the first U.S. Open final between two thirtysomething
men since the open era started in 1968, and the first at any Grand
Slam since the 1972 Australian Open when Ken Rosewall, 37, beat
36-year-old Mal Anderson.</TE>
<TE>   "You would have gotten some great odds on making this bet before
the tournament," Agassi said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Sampras, who reached his third consecutive Open final: "It
would be just a huge moment for both of us, for the game. Two older
players, two rivals over the years. He brings out the best in me. To
walk out there with him would be pretty unique, very special."</TE>
<TE>   Memories were settling in the corners of Arthur Ashe Stadium.
Brett Stephens, the longtime trainer of Sampras, had been hearing the
critics long before Greg Rusedski and Yevgeny Kafelnikov took pointed
aim this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Every year, everyone writes Pete off," Stephens said. "Every
single year and he proves them wrong all the time. It's unbelievable
for Pete too. You have everyone saying, 'This is wrong with Pete.
That's wrong with Pete.' I get it everywhere. He gets it everywhere."</TE>
<TE>   When Sampras was going out against George Bastl in the second
round at Wimbledon, he was spotted reading a letter of inspiration
from his wife, actress Bridgette Wilson, during a changeover. In the
locker room Saturday, after his semifinal win, Sampras was asked if
the letter made its way to New York. "Yes, it's here," he said.</TE>
<TE>   This is the first time Sampras and Agassi will have met in a Grand
Slam final since Wimbledon in 1999--Sampras won in straight sets--and
the first final at the U.S. Open since 1995. Sampras leads their
overall series, 19-14.</TE>
<TE>   "It's different now," said Perry Rogers, Agassi's close friend and
manager. "Andre has won all the Slams. Pete has won more Slams than
anybody. In '95 that wasn't the case. They're not playing for a piece
of history anymore. They both have history. Now they're playing as a
tribute to the game, as a tribute to their rivalry and as a tribute
to their endurance."</TE>
<TE>   Said Agassi's trainer, Gil Reyes: "As a tennis fan I think I'm
going to really, really relish this one. Because there's no guarantee
we'll see this again. I have almost a melancholy feeling, somewhat
emotional feeling, what these two have had. You start thinking of
Magic Johnson, Larry Bird."</TE>
<TE>   Even Hewitt, pulling himself out of the equation, understood the
greater meaning for the sport. The 21-year-old, suffering through a
miserable serving day--11 double faults and a first-serve percentage
of 40%--fought admirably, rallying from a 4-1 third-set deficit.</TE>
<TE>   "If I'm not allowed to be in the final, then I'd love to see these
guys go for a final," Hewitt said. "I think everyone would. I think
it's great for men's tennis.</TE>
<TE>   "But sooner or later, when they do retire, the only downside is
people are going to keep wanting to see Agassi-Sampras finals and
it's not going to be there."</TE>
<TE>   But Sampras and Agassi have shown a remarkable ability for
reinvention. Though they've combined for 20 Grand Slam titles, each
continued to press forward. Stephens said Sampras has changed his
diet and worked harder than ever this past year. Reyes said Agassi
wanted to improve his speed, so they went to Houston a few years ago
and trained with sprinters Carl Lewis and Leroy Burrell.</TE>
<TE>   "Carl Lewis said something interesting to Andre: 'As you get
toward the end of the race, you don't need to speed up, just don't
slow down,' " Reyes said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an inspiration for Andre. Andre is a man of inspiration."</TE>

<HD>Serena Is the Big Sister Now</HD>
<DH>U.S. Open: She beats older sibling Venus in third straight
major final, a 6-4, 6-3 win that underlines her superiority in
Williams family, women's tennis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>There almost is always a defining moment in a rivalry. Maybe it's
something as subtle as hearing the words Serena Williams and Venus
Williams--in that order.</LD>
<LD>   The tennis world knew exactly when Monica Seles moved ahead of
Steffi Graf. Or when Martina Navratilova left Chris Evert behind.
Those shifts are identifiable, and often unfold at Grand Slams.</LD>
<LD>   Another such moment arrived Saturday night at the U.S. Open when
Serena Williams nearly went crashing into a posse of courtside
photographers in the second set. She might have lost the point, but
it was clear she would try to chase down any shot, anywhere.</LD>
<TE>   And, after 72 minutes, top-seeded Serena left no doubt that she is
the best female player in the world, defeating her older sister and
two-time defending champion Venus Williams, 6-4, 6-3. It is her third
consecutive Grand Slam title, matching Graf's run in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   On paper, nearly everything looks equal between the sisters. Venus
has four Slams. Serena has four. Venus has defeated Serena five
times. Serena has won five times against Venus.</TE>
<TE>   Equality is a mirage.</TE>
<TE>   Serena has won their last four matches, all in straight sets,
including the French Open and Wimbledon finals this year. The closest
Venus has been able to get to Serena in a set was the opening one at
Wimbledon, which went to a tiebreaker.</TE>
<TE>   This is no longer a gap between the sisters and the rest of the
players, but a great divide between Serena and the mortals of the
tour, who now include Venus. The form we've come to expect from Venus
was nowhere in evidence Saturday, when she had three aces, 10 double
faults and a noticeably slower first serve.</TE>
<TE>   Venus never found her stride and Serena did not let her establish
a rhythm. In the opening game, Venus was forced to fend off four
break points, and went on to lose her serve in the seventh game.
Serena broke her at 30, hitting a forehand cross-court return winner.</TE>
<TE>   That in itself was not shocking. What was surprising was that the
speed of Venus' second serve was a moderate 78 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Venus barely escaped against Chanda Rubin in the fourth round and
the near miss seemed to stick with her. She looked tired and played
tired.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Serena was the best player in the whole tournament this
year," said Venus, who spoke wearily of needing a break from the
game. "I have to give it to her for that."</TE>
<TE>   The contest now is not between Serena and Venus. The more
interesting chase is Serena's pursuit of history. Had she not
suffered a serious ankle injury in Sydney, putting her out of the
Australian Open in January, Serena might be the first Grand Slam
winner since Graf in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   "You know what, I never thought about it till you just said it,"
Serena said. "So I try not to bring negative thoughts into my mind.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, I could have, huh? Maybe it was meant to happen this way,
because now when I can go to Australia [next year], I can gain tons
of points and just start over.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still young."</TE>
<TE>   She also wasn't buying into the notion that a non-calendar-year
Grand Slam is a legitimate Grand Slam.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a Serena Slam. I have to start over when I get in
Australia," said Williams, who has never gone past the quarterfinals
in Melbourne.</TE>
<TE>   By then she will be 21. Her birthday is Sept. 26. Graf and Seles
were ahead of her in terms of Grand Slams won at the same age, but
then again, Serena has had Venus as a major obstacle.</TE>
<TE>   "Those are people that when I was younger I grew up admiring and
hoping that maybe I would even be able to be on that level," Serena
said. "Just hoping. So for me, I'm 20, I'm kind of young."</TE>
<TE>   On the Williams vs. Williams scale, this Grand Slam final ranked
somewhere in the middle, with Wimbledon this year representing the
high end, the French Open in June the low.</TE>
<TE>   Venus was asked if she felt there was any sort of noticeable
backlash. The crowd support was with Amelie Mauresmo of France when
they met in the semifinals Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Four of the last five Grand Slam finals have been all-Williams
finals. Of course, few concerns were voiced during the
Evert-Navratilova era or when Graf played Navratilova in three Slam
finals in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   "All I know is that I don't know," Venus said. "That's fine. I
don't know anything as far as what the fans feel. I've never met
anyone who's walked up to me [and said], 'I don't want to see a
Williams-Williams final. Lose.' I haven't met those people yet."</TE>

<KH>UCLA 30, NO. 19 COLORADO STATE 19</KH>
<HD>Bruins Turn It Around</HD>
<DH>College football: UCLA rallies from 10-0 deficit, freshman
Taylor scores on reverse, and defense stops key two-point conversion
in opening win.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Say hello to the blue-collar Bruins, a UCLA team built around veteran
linemen, no-name ballcarriers and a senior quarterback with the life
experiences of a longshoreman.</LD>
<LD>   And if the opener against No. 19 Colorado State on Saturday night
is an indication, UCLA gets the job done until the whistle blows.</LD>
<LD>   The Bruins scored two fourth-quarter touchdowns in the span of 64
seconds, then thwarted a two-point conversion that could have tied
the score in the last two minutes to win, 30-19, before 58,078 at the
Rose Bowl.</LD>
<TE>   Colorado State quarterback Bradlee Van Pelt was smothered on an
option run, fumbled and Bruin safety Ben Emanuel scooped up the ball
and ran 89 yards for two points. UCLA scored again with a minute to
go, with Manuel White Jr. bulling 16 yards for a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   There was a lot of credit to go around, but begin with crediting
UCLA Coach Bob Toledo with guts. He promised freshman Drew Olson and
delivered.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, so did Olson.</TE>
<TE>   The freshman quarterback from Piedmont entered in the third
quarter with UCLA trailing, 13-7, and had some dicey moments--nearly
throwing an interception on one play and getting flustered and
calling timeout before another.</TE>
<TE>   But on his second series, this one early in the fourth quarter,
Olson directed a 52-yard scoring drive capped by a one-yard run by
Akil Harris that put UCLA ahead, 14-13.</TE>
<TE>   Ram running back Cecil Sapp fumbled moments later after a vicious
hit by cornerback Ricky Manning Jr. and defensive end Rusty Williams
recovered. Senior Cory Paus, who had played credibly until Olson's
appearance, returned at quarterback and handed the ball to White, who
raced 21 yards for a touchdown and 21-13 lead with 8:48 to play.</TE>
<TE>   Paus was 12 of 23 for 142 yards. Olson was two of three for 24.</TE>
<TE>   "Cory did an excellent job and Drew played with an air of
confidence," Toledo said.</TE>
<TE>   But ultimately, it wasn't about whether Paus or Olson was at
quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA (1-0), a team involved in an alarming string of off-the-field
brawls in the last two years, showed it saved plenty of fight for the
game, holding Colorado State (2-1) to 179 yards rushing and 98 yards
passing.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the Rams appeared poised to deliver the knockout blow late in
the third quarter, driving with a 13-7 lead. But Williams pressured
Van Pelt into throwing a wobbly pass that was intercepted by
linebacker Brandon Chillar at the UCLA seven-yard line.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins came in knowing they had to belt Van Pelt and rap Sapp.
And neither one did much damage until the last Ram drive, an 80-yard
scoring march capped by Van Pelt's seven-yard keeper with 1:32 to
play.</TE>
<TE>   "Our defensive line dominated," Manning said. "That was the story
of the game."</TE>
<TE>   Thirteen freshmen and redshirt freshmen made their debuts, and
they improved as the game wore on. In addition to Olson, safety
Jarrad Page, center Mike McCloskey and running backs Tyler Ebell,
Wendell Mathis and J.D. Groves played well.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought after the first half, a young team would crack, but we
didn't," Toledo said.</TE>
<TE>   So consider UCLA a work in progress. The Bruins will go back to
practice Monday, with the understanding that better performances will
be necessary in Pacific 10 Conference games.</TE>
<TE>   But for starters, this one felt good.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA had the longest off-season in the nation, nine months to the
day between games. And early on, playing well was as difficult as
childbirth.</TE>
<TE>   Harris fumbled the opening kickoff, then after UCLA recovered and
had to punt three plays later, Harris forgot he was on the punt team
and nearly cost the Bruins a delay-of-game penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Minutes later, after a field goal gave Colorado State a 3-0 lead,
Harris was replaced by Manning on the kick return. And Ebell got the
next carry at tailback, squirting two yards for UCLA's initial first
down.</TE>
<TE>   But Toledo didn't hold out Harris for long. The junior had 94
yards in 13 carries. White added 52 yards in 11 carries and the
Bruins rushed for 215 yards.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA punted on its three first-quarter possessions and a 55-yard
return by Dexter Wynn set up a seven-yard touchdown pass from Sapp to
tight end Joel Dreessen on the first play of the second quarter for a
10-0 advantage.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first career pass by Sapp, a senior, and it came while
wearing borrowed shoulder pads. He left his set in his locker at Fort
Collins, not noticing until he reached the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   The trick play was the wakeup call UCLA needed. The Bruins
answered in four plays, including a catch by White for eight yards, a
23-yard grab by tight end Mike Seidman and a reverse by receiver
Junior Taylor, who scampered 49 yards for a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first time Taylor, a freshman who sat out last season
because he was academically ineligible, touched the ball. Paus made
the key block, tying up safety David Vickers long enough for Taylor
to squeeze into the secondary and score the first offensive touchdown
by a UCLA true freshman since DeShaun Foster scored four against USC
in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   A Ram field goal after Wynn intercepted a pass at the Bruin 33
that Paus threw from the end zone made the score 13-7. UCLA went on
its most sustained march of the half, going 59 yards in 13 plays, but
Chris Griffith missed badly on a 41-yard field goal.</TE>
<TE>   Paus came out firing in the second half, completing his first five
passes during a 79-yard drive. But a third-down toss was broken up by
Steve Tufte and Griffith missed another field goal, this one from 32
yards.</TE>
<TE>   All was forgiven after the late rally, which gave UCLA its fifth
consecutive victory in an opener, its fourth against a Top 25
opponent.</TE>
<TE>   "By looking at the scene here, you'd think we'd won the Super
Bowl," said tackle Mike Saffer, surveying the jubilant locker room.
"It's just nice to get everything off our shoulders."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   KEYS TO THE GAME</TE>
<TE>   Steve Henson's keys to the game and how the Bruins matched up:</TE>
<TE>   1. Recognizing and picking up Colorado State blitzes: UCLA
quarterback Cory Paus did an excellent job of calling audibles and
was rarely pressured. Tight end Mike Seidman was forced to block
rather than run routes much of the game but had a 23-yard reception
in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   2. Containing scrambling Ram quarterback Bradlee Van Pelt: The
Bruins smothered him in the first half as he rushed for four yards in
seven carries. In the third quarter Van Pelt successfully ran several
options but still couldn't break free when scrambling.</TE>
<TE>   3. Avoiding typical first-game mistakes against an opponent that
had played two games: The Bruins fumbled two kickoffs and a snap in
the first half, but recovered them all. A roughing-the-kicker penalty
extended a Colorado State drive with two minutes left in the half. In
the second half it was difficult to tell which team was playing in
its opener.</TE>

<LD>It wasn't the go-ahead touchdown that settled freshman quarterback
Drew Olson down.</LD>
<LD>   It wasn't that 15-yard pass to Tab Perry that gave UCLA a
first-and-goal from the five, either.</LD>
<LD>   "Actually, the play that settled me down was the one I got sacked
on," Olson said. "It kind of calmed my nerves."</LD>
<TE>   Coach Bob Toledo told Olson he was going to play in the second
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo didn't keep his word, deciding against it first because
Cory Paus threw an interception and would feel he had been yanked,
and later because he blew an opportunity with a penalty.</TE>
<TE>   But Toledo kept his word on one thing. He told Olson he was going
to get his feet wet.</TE>
<TE>   Try soaked.</TE>
<TE>   With the Bruins on to their seven-yard line in the third quarter,
trailing by six, Toledo sent in the rookie.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought maybe they might put me in at the 40-yard line,
something like that," Olson said.</TE>
<TE>   "It happened to be where it was. I was happy to go in. I was
excited."</TE>
<TE>   Not that he was complaining.</TE>
<TE>   Especially after he directed a 52-yard drive early in the fourth
that helped UCLA take a 14-13 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "It was awesome. That was the best feeling, coming off the field,"
Olson said.</TE>
<TE>   The idea was that without an experienced backup, UCLA had to get
Olson some experience or risk having to play him an emergency without
any.</TE>
<TE>   The players said they weren't surprised at Toledo's move.</TE>
<TE>   "He has confidence in him," tailback Akil Harris said. "He wanted
to get his feet wet. It was the perfect time."</TE>
<TE>   Well, not exactly perfect, Toledo admitted.</TE>
<TE>   "We get the ball around the eight-yard line and here goes a true
freshman in at quarterback. He was a little nervous but I tell you
what, for a [19]-year-old kid he's a pretty poised player. He threw
some good balls."</TE>
<TE>   The reason his debut went so well, Olson said, is coaches prepared
him. So did Paus.</TE>
<TE>   "He gave me a lot of good advice about keeping my composure," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   He kept it, and now Olson, a 6-foot-2, 188-pound freshman from
Piedmont, Calif., might be closer to his future than he thinks. The
fans think so.</TE>
<TE>   His debut has provided a whole new angle, sort of like Carson
Palmer's freshman debut at USC did. Still, he completed only two of
three passes for 24 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, Cory's our starter," Olson said. "We're sticking behind
him. He's leading the team right now. There's no battle or anything
going on like that."</TE>
<TE>   Isn't that how it always starts?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On a night when too many seniors started out playing like
freshmen, a freshman named Junior struck the first blow for UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Junior Taylor, a 6-2, 193-pound freshman receiver from Mesa,
Ariz., scored the Bruins' first touchdown on a spectacular 49-yard
reverse in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor, coming from the left side of the field, took a handoff
from Harris and used his speed to gain ground as he headed right.</TE>
<TE>   As the Rams caught on to the reverse, Taylor darted back in,
cutting all the way back left and through a crowd of jerseys, 49
yards to the end zone.</TE>
<TE>   One of the best blocks he picked up was from Paus, who up to that
point had contributed little to the offense.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor's run was the first offensive touchdown by a true freshman
since DeShaun Foster scored four against USC in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Though Taylor originally signed with UCLA in 2001, he didn't meet
NCAA eligibility standards and initially wasn't admitted to UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   By last December, he had raised his aptitude test scores enough to
gain admission for the winter quarter in January--and that allowed
him to take part in spring practice.</TE>
<TE>   But he remains a true freshman, with four years of eligibility.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Besides Taylor, who scored the first time he touched the ball, and
Olson, freshmen who made contributions included safety Jarrad Page
and tailbacks Tyler Ebell and Wendell Mathis.</TE>
<TE>   Page, a true freshman from San Leandro, made a tackle near the
goal line in the second quarter and knocked down a pass with less
than a minute to play in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   Ebell, a redshirt freshman from Ventura, eked out a first down on
a two-yard sweep in the first quarter, had a seven-yard run in the
third quarter and returned a punt four yards.</TE>
<TE>   Mathis did not play until the fourth quarter. With Olson at
quarterback, Mathis carried for five, then six yards on the first two
plays of a 52-yard scoring drive that gave UCLA a 14-13 lead. He
carried again on the drive for three yards.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Free safety Matt Ware hurt his ribs in the second half but did not
believe the injury was serious.</TE>

<HD>Colorado Is Stronger Than Ochs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOULDER, Colo.</DL>
<LD>Colorado lost concussion-plagued quarterback Craig Ochs but found an
able replacement.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Hodge, who logged only 10 offensive plays last season,
subbed for the ailing Ochs in the second half Saturday night and
helped lead the No. 17 Buffaloes past San Diego State, 34-14.</LD>
<LD>   Ochs departed at halftime with his third concussion in the last 14
months, but Hodge didn't miss a beat, guiding Colorado (1-1) to two
second-half scores--both by Chris Brown, who ran for 185 yards.</LD>
<TE>   "We went right to Robert and he was ready to go," Coach Gary
Barnett said. "He wasn't nervous at all. He's been waiting for this
opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   More of a runner than Ochs, Hodge "brings a different dimension to
the game," Barnett said.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt comfortable out there," Hodge said. "I was happy I didn't
make any big mistakes. I knew we had the lead, and I couldn't do
anything to jeopardize that lead. I had to manage our offense and
play within myself.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure a lot of things were sloppy, but I'll get better."</TE>
<TE>   San Diego State (0-2) crossed midfield five times in the second
half but came up empty each time, including a missed field goal and a
sack on fourth down.</TE>
<TE>   Rebounding from last week's loss to Colorado State, the Buffaloes
extended their lead to 28-14 late in the third quarter after Jeremy
Bloom returned a punt 31 yards to the San Diego State 44-yard line.</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Purify promptly broke a 43-yard run off the left side, and
Brown went the final yard on the next play.</TE>
<TE>   With 51 seconds left, Brown bolted 38 yards up the middle for
another score.</TE>
<TE>   "Colorado was physical, and we were overmatched," Aztec Coach Tom
Craft said. "I thought we really played hard and we stayed in the
game all the way up to the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "We just ran out of gas. Where we got exposed tonight was our lack
of depth. We just don't have enough numbers."</TE>
<TE>   Ochs threw two touchdown passes as Colorado took a 21-14 halftime
lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Buffaloes scored on their first two possessions for a 14-7
first-quarter advantage.</TE>

<HD>Looking Up to Vargas</HD>
<DH>Despite any problems the boxer might have had, he can do no
wrong to kids at La Colonia in Oxnard</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The floor is a hive of activity.</LD>
<LD>   The air in the La Colonia Youth Boxing Center in Oxnard is filled
with the familiar smell of sweat, yet it is a more innocent aroma
that wafts throughout as a roomful of pint-sized pugilists go through
their workouts.</LD>
<LD>   Rapid-fire Spanglish bounces off the walls--"Mijo, move and then
throw la izquerda. A left, throw a left. Que bueno, good."--as a pair
of preteens in oversized headgear throw punches at each other in an
animated sparring session.</LD>
<TE>   The gym's clock continues its countdown and the older boys
shadow-box in front of the mirror-covered walls or pummel the various
hanging bags with powerful hooks in the cramped yet homey gym.</TE>
<TE>   The unmistakable sound of jump ropes cutting through the air and
slapping the wood floor adds to the commotion in which some boys,
whose families can't afford workout attire, train in their school
clothes.</TE>
<TE>   All the while, a sneering mug stares down at them from up on high.
Fernando Vargas, La Colonia's prodigal son who has had a few missteps
on his return home, has his head tilted to the side, his lips pursed
and his hands on his hips, as if asking, "Y que? Now what are you
going to do?"</TE>
<TE>   The life-size cardboard cutout of Vargas is tacked to a wall about
15 feet off the ground, giving Vargas' visage a perfect view to the
27 youngsters, the youngest of whom is 8, who have assembled here on
a midweek afternoon. His image also provides inspiration to the
children who pass through the doors of the building they refer to as
Casa de Campeones, House of Champions.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why we come here every day," Carlos Zizumbo, 14, says of
Vargas. "To us, he's like an idol because he came from here. So
hopefully, one day, we can be like him."</TE>
<TE>   Some may think that the adoration of Vargas in these parts would
be at a fever pitch these days, what with the Oxnard native's
much-anticipated title fight with Oscar De La Hoya on Saturday at the
Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas. But the truth is, Vargas is
revered by the children of La Colonia on a daily basis.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh yeah, he's a cool guy and inspiring," said Peter Turcios, 13.
"Because if he makes it, I could probably make it too."</TE>
<TE>   Jaime Fernandez, 17, signed up at La Colonia after watching
Vargas' game effort in a knockout loss to Felix Trinidad in December
2000.</TE>
<TE>   "He tells us, 'Don't do drugs, don't do alcohol, don't get caught
up in any of that stuff. Just follow your goals,' " Fernandez said.</TE>
<TE>   Fernandez, though, grins when asked if Vargas ever tells the kids
at La Colonia to learn from his mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   "Nah, he never says anything about that," Fernandez said with a
laugh.</TE>
<TE>   Vargas, who had a troubled childhood and whose recent legal
troubles stemmed from the beating of a man and resulted in his
wearing an ankle monitor, was at the center of a controversy with
Oxnard city officials nearly two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Vargas and fellow La Colonia product Robert Garcia, a former
junior-lightweight champion, held a news conference at the center to
announce they were each donating $1,000 to La Colonia.</TE>
<TE>   But Vargas also blasted the city, saying that it did
next-to-nothing to help the center and the kids of his barrio.</TE>
<TE>   Critics blasted back, intimating that for a professional fighter
making millions, a $1,000 donation was akin to an insult.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, they pointed out, public money built the club in 1977,
$270,000 in a community-development block grant paid for renovation
of the facilities and almost $30,000 annually in public funding keeps
the club open.</TE>
<TE>   Back and forth they went--Vargas and his people saying that he
pumps tens of thousands of dollars into the community that he doesn't
broadcast to the media every time he helps out.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard City Councilman Bedford Pinkard, meanwhile, wondered aloud
that if that were indeed the case, why would Vargas feel the need to
hold a news conference over $1,000 and then come out swinging against
the city.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I came out looking like the bad guy in the community over
that one," said Pinkard, who helped found La Colonia. "He's highly
respected here and a lot of people have run-ins. Nobody's perfect."</TE>
<TE>   The storm has subsided, although Vargas' critics revel in the fact
that he recently moved out of Oxnard, a change he once vowed never to
make, to the posh Spanish Hills area of Camarillo.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez thinks that Vargas has been unfairly
criticized at times.</TE>
<TE>   "He certainly has matured a lot, but I guess that all depends upon
a matter of perspective," Lopez said. "If you're in the limelight,
there's always somebody watching you."</TE>
<TE>   Though some would say he started the war of words, Vargas was
deeply hurt and affected by it. He has since maintained a low
profile, public relations-wise, in regards to La Colonia.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not the best neighborhood in the world," said Vargas, who
wears 'La Colonia' stitched into his trunks. "But it's a beautiful
community.</TE>
<TE>   "When I go there, I want [the kids] to know that they can make it
out. They can be a lawyer or a fighter and I don't want them to see
me telling them that on TV, but at the gym [in person]."</TE>
<TE>   Vargas' foundation has donated 15 tickets to La Colonia for
Saturday's fight. But the gym's director, Fernando Cervantes, is
contemplating trading the tickets for cash to buy much-needed
equipment for the club.</TE>
<TE>   Cervantes, though, does not call out Vargas for more financial
support, saying he has donated gear, money and his time.</TE>
<TE>   "He does what he can and when he's here, he talks with the kids
when he's not training," Cervantes said. "He donated the mirrors and
the carpet [in the punching bag area] and it's beautiful.</TE>
<TE>   "Ninety-nine percent of the kids here are like Fernando. They come
from the same neighborhood and a lot of the kids end up working at
McDonald's or in the fields because they don't have a future."</TE>
<TE>   So they spread out on the stairs leading up to the weight room at
La Colonia when their training is done.</TE>
<TE>   Kids who have rarely seen a laptop computer and whose highlight of
the season is to be taken to the local Hometown Buffet for dinner
have their schoolbooks cracked open for homework.</TE>
<TE>   That beacon of community pride that is La Colonia serves as much
more than a place to sweat.</TE>
<TE>   It gives disenfranchised youths something to do while idolizing
the local homeboy made good.</TE>
<TE>   "It's better than being in the streets and getting into gangs,"
said Gerardo Garcia, 12. "That's what Fernando tells us, to stay away
from the bad things."</TE>
<TE>   But Vargas' most well-known message has been ingrained in the
fiber of La Colonia for as long as he has been successful.</TE>
<TE>   "He still represents and he still remembers," Zizumbo said. "Not a
lot of boxers do that. That's what I like about him--he doesn't
forget where he comes from.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of these fighters, they get big and bad and they forget
where they're from. They don't represent.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he sees us as little versions of him, how he was when he
started out."</TE>

<HD>Wells Loses Two Teeth During Attack at Diner</HD>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Pitcher David Wells of the New York Yankees was punched in the head
and lost two teeth when he was attacked by a man waving a butter
knife at a diner early Saturday, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Wells, 39, refused medical attention after the assault at 5:50
a.m. at the restaurant on Manhattan's Upper East Side.</LD>
<LD>   Rocco Graziosa, 27, of Yonkers, N.Y., was arrested and charged
with assault and menacing.</LD>
<TE>   Police said they did not know whether Graziosa was being held or
released, or if a court appearance had been scheduled. Calls to the
district attorney's office and Graziosa's home were not immediately
returned.</TE>
<TE>   Wells was at the diner with a friend--not a teammate--when
Graziosa walked in with some friends and began chatting with the
pitcher, police Sgt. David Jorin said.</TE>
<TE>   After the conversation, Graziosa went to his table and made a
remark about Wells' mother, who is dead.</TE>
<TE>   A few moments later, Graziosa grabbed a butter knife off the
table, began waving it and attacked Wells, police said. Wells called
911, and police arrived and made the arrest.</TE>

<DH>Two Very Different L.A. Music Talents--Country Singer
Dwight Yoakam and Hollywood Bowl Conductor John Mauceri--Make Fall's
Looks Work for Them</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HEATHER JOHN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A man dressed in a cowboy hat, alligator boots and a Dolce &amp; Gabbana
suit slinging a Gibson Honky Tonk Deuce guitar leaves little doubt
that you can take the boy out of the country, but you can't take the
country out of the boy. ''I've always said I was born in Kentucky and
raised in Ohio, but grew up in California,'' says Dwight Yoakam with
a twang that 25 years of California living has done little to erase.
Drawn to L.A. in 1977 by a country-rock scene that included Clarence
White, the Byrds, Gram Parsons, the Flying Burrito Brothers and the
Eagles, Yoakam embarked on a career that has seen 16 albums, two
Grammys and 21 nominations. In November he'll release a 10-CD box set
called ''Reprise, Please Baby: Dwight Yoakam, The Warner Years.''</LD>
<LD>   He's currently on tour sporting duds he describes as ''pushing the
outer edge of the Western style envelope,'' which he designs in
collaboration with North Hollywood tailor Jaime Castaneda. ''I sketch
in my own inept fashion where I want embroidery and what I want the
elements to be, and Jaime crafts that with me.'' Similarly, in
designing his boots, the artist has worked exclusively for the past
decade with Rios of Mercedes, Texas, which aficionados regard as the
benchmark in Western footwear.</LD>
<TE>   His personal style reaches beyond the country music set. The Gap
has featured Yoakam in two major campaigns--last Christmas' ''Give a
Little Bit'' charity drive and their line-dancing commercial
featuring Yoakam's remake of the band Queen's song ''Crazy Little
Thing.'' ''When they approached me, they were a little sheepish about
the song they wanted us to sing,'' he says. ''I thought it was great.
That was Freddie Mercury's tribute to rockabilly, and so it comes
full circle because [the song] is back in the hands of a hillbilly
singer.''</TE>
<TE>   Yoakam's creativity doesn't stop in the music and fashion arenas.
Since 1992, he's appeared in 11 movies, including Billy Bob
Thornton's Oscar-winning ''Sling Blade'' and last spring's
blockbuster ''Panic Room.'' It was during filming of the latter
project that costar Forest Whitaker discovered Yoakam's latest
creative outlet: biscuits. His eponymous line of frozen ''Bakersfield
Biscuits'' hit national supermarkets earlier this summer. ''It
started off as a response to Buck Owens' ribbing to do something
special for the opening of his Bakersfield restaurant, Crystal
Palace,'' he says. (Yoakam is perhaps best known for his 1988 duet
with Owens, ''Streets of Bakersfield.'') The biscuits were an instant
hit with patrons, and Yoakam began working with scientists to
re-create the frozen version for national distribution. ''We were
testing them in my dressing room on the set of 'Panic Room,' and
Forest would smell them baking and come in to try them,'' he says.
''Now the biscuits have a life of their own.'' Which means Yoakam can
return to his first passion. ''I'll always look to music first as an
outlet for expressing myself.''</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   John Mauceri is one of those guys who'll give you the shirt off
his back--literally. ''If people like what I'm wearing, I tend to
give it to them after about a year,'' he says. ''And there are
actually people all over wearing my clothes. I love to do that!'' But
the 56-year-old principal conductor of the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra
doesn't stop with cashmere sweaters. Or the latest Pema Chodron work
(''I never thought I was going to read a book by an American Buddhist
nun, but 'When Things Fall Apart' is so life-affirming I've bought 30
copies and find myself giving them to people''). Giving back is
somewhat of a theme with Mauceri, and most often he's done it through
music.</TE>
<TE>   Mauceri--who worked with Leonard Bernstein for 18 years, has
conducted everyone from Placido Domingo to Madonna and has won
Grammy, Tony, Emmy, Olivier and Edison awards, to name a few--works
imaginatively to create concerts that celebrate Los Angeles and its
context in the world. He's in his 12th season with the Hollywood Bowl
Orchestra, which was created for him by the Los Angeles Philharmonic
Assn. in 1991. ''I wanted to make this new orchestra representative
of the cultural achievements of the city, which is impossible for one
organization to truly represent, but it was always my goal.''
Creative programs such as ''Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein at the Movies,''
which was performed against a big screen featuring scenes from movies
such as ''South Pacific,'' ''The King &amp; I'' and ''The Sound of
Music,'' are, he says, ''specifically for the point of view of Los
Angeles because all of the orchestrations were written here.''
Earlier this year, he staged a one-night performance of Puccini's
opera ''La Boheme.'' ''I'm sure it came as a surprise to a lot of
people that 'La Boheme' had its American premiere in Los Angeles in
1897,'' he says. ''That night I said to the audience, 'This is your
opera, too. It was here first.' ''</TE>
<TE>   ''That's why I do music--for that kind of community sense of being
linked with people,'' he continues. ''With [music], I feel like I'm
part of a tradition of human expression that goes as far back as
anyone can imagine and, at the same time, it works on a horizontal
level with people who are living all over the world right now. I
conduct music of many different styles and many different levels of
complexity because I look for that common denominator--and in that
common denominator I find the human experience and the human soul.''</TE>

<DH>If You Want to Make It as a Band in L.A., First You've Got
to Dress the Part and Brave the Scene</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFF BOUCHER</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>If you can make it in New York clubs, you can make it anywhere. But
if you can make it in Los Angeles clubs, you can make it everywhere,
which explains why the garage bands that aspire to grow up and become
rock stars brave the sometimes treacherous local scene. Southern
California is the epicenter of the music industry, and that means
even tiny clubs here have a searing spotlight as well as the
frostiest audiences this side of the Iditarod. Now only will the
crowds not dance, they mutter into their cell phones during the high
notes and leave during the third song.</LD>
<LD>   Still, if you want to hear what will be on MTV in six months, if
you want to see the next fashion in pop and rock, this is the town to
find it. Or to be it. From the Eagles and the Doors, through Van
Halen and Guns N' Roses to the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Linkin Park,
the clubs here were the early proving ground for scores of superstar
acts. The talent levels on any local stage can vary wildly night to
night--sometimes even hour to hour--and the next performer could be
the new Van Morrison or, well, the latest Vanilla Ice. Watch what the
performers wear, too; be it homemade, secondhand or fresh from the
catwalk, the would-be stars on the Sunset Strip know that here, of
all places, your wardrobe has to be ready for your close-up.</LD>
<TE>   ''The Hollywood myth about someone in the audience that's going to
make you famous, you know, the producer with the cigar and all? Well,
here in L.A. it's true.'' The man talking is Adam Levine, lead singer
of Maroon5, one of the more promising bands in Los Angeles clubs. The
group is on the cusp of success, with a slot on a national tour
featuring Sheryl Crow, Train and Ziggy Marley, and they are fairly
certain they won't run into crowds as chilled as those at the Whisky,
where the group first played in 1995, when its members were students
at the Brentwood School.</TE>
<TE>   ''L.A. and New York are the most cutthroat places to build a
following,'' Levine says, wiping stage sweat from his brow. The
singer and his bandmates have just finished a rollicking, sold-out
performance at the Troubadour, where women in the audience literally
cried. But Levine is having a hard time exorcising the ghosts of L.A.
gigs gone bad. ''What makes it hard is this is where everybody goes
to be in a band. If you're the hometown hero of, whatever, Wyoming,
it's different. I mean, I'm sure that's difficult there, too, it's
difficult to build a following anywhere. But when you're here in L.A.
and there's seven bands on every bill and you have these legendary
clubs like the Roxy, the Whisky and the Troubador. Well, you better
be good. Damn good.''</TE>
<TE>   There are a lot of damn good bands in L.A., but most of them burn
out, fade away or simply sell their gear at a pawnshop and surrender
all future ovations for a ''real'' job. In fact, for the members of
the three bands profiled in this story, the hardest part for most of
them was getting time off from their day jobs for a weekday fashion
shoot. Be you a lawyer or pizza delivery guy, you have to serve
somebody. ''This is the type of shirt I'm going to wear when I can
afford it,'' one of the young rocker models muses during the fashion
shoot.</TE>
<TE>   Fashion shoots, making music videos, prowling the red carpet at
awards shows--those things are not a part of everyday life for the
talented quintet Damone. Maybe someday, but for now their nights
offstage are more likely to find them hanging out in the small house
in Burbank that is their unofficial headquarters. It's Friday night
and their attentions are focused on green-bottle beer and banter
about the careers of Neil Young, Rage Against the Machine and Brian
Wilson (all of whom, coincidentally, found their paths to glory in
Southern California). Dave Boyle plays guitar and sometimes frets
about the peculiar brand of fan he sees when they play locally. The
group has traveled to gigs in San Francisco and as far east as
Pittsburgh, but they've found the most jaundiced eyes on their home
turf.</TE>
<TE>   ''Everybody in this town is in a band. Or manages a band. Or does
sound for a band," Boyle says. "And when you get up there to play,
unless you're in just a pure dive, you find a lot of cynical faces in
the audience.</TE>
<TE>   ''The crowds here are just different. But, you know, to do well
here means a lot. The respect of our peers is a badge. And when
you're outside 'the machine' that means a lot.''</TE>
<TE>   "The machine" is the major label system of the music industry, and
it is a strange, creaky contraption. Despite that machine's
well-publicized disasters of late (among them rampant online piracy,
an artists' rights movement, a stultifying corporate culture from
conglomeration and sagging sales), the machine still spits out money
and fame for young bands. Or, sometimes, it just spits out the bands
themselves. In another wrinkle that sets L.A. apart, many of the
local homegrown bands have members who work by day in music industry
offices and hit the stage on nights and weekends hoping their show
business careers will become more show and less business. In Damone,
for instance, two members work at DreamWorks Records and a third,
singer Shane Alexander, works in the offices of Irving Azoff, manager
of the Eagles and the Backstreet Boys who is known as one of the
town's best businessmen and one of its world-class screamers.
Alexander is a struggling musician and a Buddhist--hardly the type of
person an industry outsider would peg for a job in Azoff's realm, but
the industry's Dream Factory is staffed by people just like
Alexander. Those jobs give them an excruciatingly close view of the
future they long for.</TE>
<TE>   ''Our goal is to pay the bills and find someone who appreciates
us,'' Alexander says. ''If you're a band from somewhere else,
anywhere else, there's some mystery to you for the industry. There's
no mystery about us. They know us and they see us one way, and that's
not always the way we want.''</TE>
<TE>   Still, L.A. is the place to be seen and, as Alexander notes, on
any given night the crowd might have the Lottery Ticket walking
around among its black-clad ranks. ''You do think about it; you
wonder, is this the night someone sees us and hears something in our
music they believe in?''</TE>
<TE>   While some bands are beholden to a certain musical time and place,
others find their sonic directions are subject to change. It's
another part of the churn that is so singular to the L.A. scene. So
many bands start or come through here, see their lineup change, find
a label deal or agent, and break up or quit here, that sometimes it's
dizzying to keep track of any of it.</TE>
<TE>   The band Pushover, for instance, was once a ska band called
Mealticket. Then a membership change in the band tilted its focus,
and the remaining players traded in their horns for a more
straightforward rock sound. They have spent a decade pursuing their
dreams of music as a career. Their day jobs include high school
teacher, mortgage company executive, lawyer, private investigator.
''We definitely know that we want to do this, music, for a living,''
says Ricky Estrada, guitarist and lead singer. ''We talk about it all
the time. I want to make enough money to support myself and a family
and make music. You know, we don't want to be on 'Cribs' with an
$11-million dollar house and everything. We don't need to make
billions and be super famous. We just want to live comfortably. We
don't need to be Tupac. I mean, look how that ended up.''</TE>
<TE>   Even if Pushover never makes it over the hump, Estrada and company
have already played out part of their jukebox fantasy by walking in
the footsteps of great L.A. bands of the past. ''When we play the
Roxy, the Whisky or the 'Troub' or whatever, I just get really jazzed
because we're on the same stage where my heroes played, like Jane's
Addiction and the Doors and Oingo Boingo.''</TE>
<TE>   Pushover and Damone are inching closer to music industry success,
but it's Maroon5 that has jumped into the mainstream with their spot
on the Jeep World Outside Festival. Unlike many of their peers, their
history has been one of smooth edges and gentle ramps. They had high
school friends listening from day one and industry interest not long
after. The trajectory hasn't been too steep; in 1997, the group (then
called Kara's Flowers and with a more alternative-rock sensibility)
released an album on Reprise Records and hit the road with the bands
Reel Big Fish and Goldfinger. Their sound now, a pop-rock blend
guided by the compass points of Prince and Stevie Wonder, sounds
radio-ready. Their comfortable ride to date is apparent. Lead singer
Levine has the smirk and swagger of a college star on draft day and
his bandmates seem to feel a bit guilty that things are going so
well.</TE>
<TE>   ''We were blessed,'' bassist Mickey Madden says. ''I'd be hesitant
to complain, ever. We've been lucky enough to have the support of
families and have a dose of professionalism from a very young age. We
sort of saw how the monster works. For a lot of bands it's a real
struggle, a real fight. I mean we've been down, but our down has
been, well, pretty lucky.''</TE>
<TE>   Lucky, yes, but luck sometimes runs out and the gears of the Los
Angeles music machine make for a hazardous workplace. In hushed
tones, Madden acknowledges that as the stakes get higher, the
pitfalls deepen and, since no one can really predict the future, all
you can do is enjoy the ride. Downstairs, the Troubadour crowd is
meandering out onto the sidewalks of Santa Monica Boulevard, and
Madden and the other members of Maroon5 are in a celebratory mood.
The show has been one of their best ever, and they are clearly
pleased that they can say that in L.A. The audience was jammed with
music industry types and the buzz about the show walked out with
them.</TE>
<TE>   Madden chuckles and recalls some of the band's gigs that didn't
fare so well, like the unfortunate night Maroon5 found itself on a
bill of ska bands with fans who weren't in the mood for pop. ''They
used to throw stuff at us, but nothing as huge as beer bottles. Coins
mostly. You make the best of it and keep going. And then when you're
done, you sweep the stage and take the money home.'' Perhaps they
should mint a new coin just for L.A. club crowds--one large enough to
injure but so valuable that you can't walk away from it. &amp;lt;</TE>

<LD>What do you get for a man who has nine multi-platinum records, a
couple of Grammys, a slew of movie credits and 4,000 hats?</LD>
<LD>   Peppermint tea (with Equal), three salmon burgers, hold the bread,
and a side of salad with honey-mustard dressing and candied pecans.
"Let's do what we're all thinking," James Todd Smith says politely to
the waiter. "Let's put it all on one plate."</LD>
<LD>   James Todd Smith--LL Cool J (Ladies Love Cool James) as his rap
music fans know him, or "Mr. Smith," as the snaking tattoo on his
right bicep announces, or Todd, as his friends call him--has made a
career of having a lot on his plate. He's currently touring for the
first time in four years to promote his 10th album ("Ten"), awaiting
the release of his romantic comedy film "Deliver Us From Eva" and
launching a children's book with a read-along, rap-along CD called
"And the Winner Is." Smith, 34, is a man of many, many hats--and most
of them are Kangol, if anyone's counting.</LD>
<TE>   Since he exploded onto the music scene at the age of 16, Smith's
personal style--the omnipresent Kangol, serious jewelry and baggy
clothing such as the Fubu line for which he's a spokesperson and part
owner--has come to define the hip-hop look. Though the forthcoming
video for his single "Love You Better" might be peppered with Gucci,
it surely can't be what Tom Ford had in mind. "You know, no matter
how I dress, I still have a hip-hop sensibility," he says. "You can
line up three guys wearing the same suit and the vibe is going to be
different. If George Clooney and I put on the same suit, he might
wear it with a white T-shirt and look more basic. I'm going to be
wearing earrings, my watch and my pinky ring, and it's going to look
different."</TE>
<TE>   And as with his clothes, Smith's music reflects his personal
agenda, which is largely to have fun. "My new album is a party
album," he says unapologetically. "People have been having fun for
thousands of years and that's not going to change. Everybody can't be
on the dark side of the force. Somebody's got to be on the light
side. I'm not trying to destroy my life publicly in order to get
famous. I'm not going to try to get caught with four guns so I can
sell 6 million albums next week. I'm not going to do any of that. I'm
just going to be LL Cool J."</TE>

<DH>Jared Gold Gives Fashion That Creepy Feeling</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAURIE PIKE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Many designers are culture vultures, gleaning the Zeitgeist from
headlines, art shows and the buzz among the glitterati. Jared Gold is
not such a designer. There's a reverence for the wrong and the
sinister at Gold's studio, in an early 1900s building just a spat's
throw from the Los Angeles Police Department's Rampart Division.
Here, Gold has staged fashion shows accessorized with live Madagascar
cockroaches and accompanied by toy piano music--played by the
designer himself.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't ever read fashion magazines," says the 30-year-old Gold,
who grew up Mormon and doesn't smoke or drink. "My line is
cloistered, insulated from what other people are doing." He started
selling his eponymous collection of whimsical "Victorian-punk"
women's wear to Fred Segal while employed there in 1996, adding
menswear two years ago to both his couture line and his
less-expensive diffusion line, Black Chandelier.</LD>
<TE>   What made Gold start a men's line? "I needed something to wear."
Gold's menswear affirms his love of the off-kilter detail, the
anachronistic fillip: printed vests, fitted waists and sleeves and
his ubiquitous chandelier silk-screen motif. As recent influences,
Gold cites books on the Belle Epoque and tomes on unusual animals as
well as National Geographic magazines and theories concerning
extraterrestrials and their influence on fashion. How that translates
to garments such as a fluorescent pink blazer (for the couture line)
or a black sweatshirt with an oversized Edwardian collar and pink
pom-poms appliqued in the shape of a heart (for Black Chandelier) is
anyone's guess. "My angle is to use a traditional shape and add this
bizarre feminine flair to it. It comes across looking kind of wrong,
and I love that."</TE>
<TE>   Gold may be living in his own little bubble but that world may be
about to expand: He says he has recently secured financial backing
that will free him to concentrate on designing and expanding his
lines without having to oversee production details. While Gold's work
has taken off in Japan and his women's wear has done well in
bellwether stores stateside, the men's line has appeared only in a
few edgier venues such as Aero &amp; Co. in Los Angeles and Rolo in San
Francisco. For now, Gold is cultivating the art of walking that
tightrope between the mainstream and the far side. "It's difficult
being innovative. I have to be careful about how colorful I can be
and the shapes I use. It's a really complicated problem, super
tricky."</TE>

<DH>Metropolis / Designing Men: Rocker Androgyny Has Pride of
Place in the Designs of Ryan Heffington</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW VONTZ</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You'd never know it from looking at the members of Linkin Park, but
androgyny is a proud tradition in rock 'n' roll. From Mick Jagger to
David Bowie, Steven Tyler and Marilyn Manson, rock star charisma
often resides in a subversive hint of femininity beneath the
swaggering machismo.</LD>
<LD>   It's that dichotomy between hard and soft, masculine and feminine,
that inspired L.A. designer Ryan Heffington, 29, to create his Rock
'n' Sissy line three years ago. Heffington's designs are primarily
one-of-a-kind, boho-chic T-shirts using pastiche construction
techniques, printing and a variety of bold, bright materials. The
dramatic Rock 'n' Sissy style stems from the work Heffington has done
for the past seven years as a costume designer, choreographer and
dancer for the L.A.-based troupes Psycho Dance Sho and Hysterica
Dance Company. "Sometimes I'd create outfits using duct tape and
material because at the time I didn't know how to sew," Heffington
says of the early days. "When the show was over, I'd have to cut them
out."</LD>
<TE>   To promote his designs, Heffington wore Rock 'n' Sissy T-shirts
when he went clubbing. He also made shirts available when approached
by stylists and assistants he knew. Today, Rock 'n' Sissy shirts are
available at Aero &amp; Co. in Los Angeles and also at invite-only "shirt
social" parties that Heffington throws every few months at clubs
around L.A., including Socket, an electro night he promotes with a
friend at the Parlour in West Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   In true androgynous spirit, Rock 'n' Sissy wear works for men or
women--hardly a sticking point for rock blades such as Mick Jagger
and Dave Navarro, who have worn the shirts. Rock 'n' Sissy's latest
musical alliance is with the electro artist Mount Sims on the Emperor
Norton and International DeeJay Gigolos labels. In addition to
designing the clothes for Mount Sims and his dancers' current tour,
Heffington is dancing on the tour. But this time, he'll save the duct
tape for leaky pipes.</TE>

<LD>From the British Invasion of the '60s to Current Hip-Hop Culture,
Music and Fashion Have Been Inseparable. Then MTV's Influence on the
American Wardrobe Took the Relationship Between Fashion and Music to
a Whole New Level. In the Pages That Follow, We Check In With Three
Grammy-Winning Trendsetters Who Make Mainstream Fashion Work on an
Individual Level and Trace the Garage Band Phenomenom that Could Only
Happen in Los Angeles</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Here I stand in front of my bedroom mirror, shamelessly posturing.
I pump my puny arms for the umpteenth time, reminding myself that
lifting dumbbells will get me closer to my goal: the roller-coaster
biceps exposed in those sleeveless shirts that seem to be the rage of
rock gods. I, too, want that flex-and-the city-look a la Lenny
Kravitz, Enrique Iglesias and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. So, like a
human oil rig, I pump.</LD>
<TE>   I've cruised this rock fashion road before, the place where music
and style converge. I was too young to look like a Beatle. I passed
on Spandex and glitter rock, and I didn't indulge in hip-hop. But in
between those musical genres and looks, I've rocked 'n' rolled in
clothing that was influenced by the stars onstage.</TE>
<TE>   In the '90s, with a bandanna-wrapped forehead, I grunged my way to
Nirvana land in mismatched clothing anchored by lumberjack plaid
flannel shirts. In the '80s, I tried out new wave and punk
alternative looks: I spiked my rainbow-colored hair, wore wild
sunglasses at night and deconstructed thrift store finds, perfect for
the B-52's spastic rock lobster. I copied the Che Guevara
beret-wearing looks of the Thompson Twins and the Clash. I stole
wardrobe tips from Boy George (baggy geisha coats), Adam Ant (drum
major ensembles), Billy Idol (bad boy leather) and Michael Jackson (a
''Thriller'' V-shaped zippered jacket, high-water trousers, a
sequined glove) and created my own style.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing captured my fashion fancy like the touch, the feel, the
industrial grip of polyester, circa 1977, when the disco beat came
into full bloom with the release of ''Saturday Night Fever.'' I'm not
afraid to confess to shamelessly freaking with Chic or getting down
with KC &amp; the Sunshine Band or taking my cues from the Bee Gees in
petroleum-based, body-hugging Qiana shirts and shiny slacks that
coiled around my hairless physique.</TE>
<TE>   ''Music and fashion are definitely intertwined and have been for a
very long time,'' says Marshal Cohen, co-president of
NPDFashionworld, a Port Washington, N.Y.-based company that tracks
apparel industry trends. ''It used to be that fashion influenced
music tremendously.'' Now, ''because fashion is looking for a
direction and trends to hang its hat on,'' the music industry is the
dominant cultural influence.</TE>
<TE>   ''A lot of today's fashion leaders are looking at things they see,
especially in music videos, for inspiration.''</TE>
<TE>   What do they see? ''Rap and hip-hop artists walking around in
baseball jerseys and track pants,'' Cohen says about the street
trends generated from the world of music and worn by both sexes
''because music is genderless and fashion is theater.''</TE>
<TE>   Tom Julian, an analyst with New York-based Fallon Worldwide, an
advertising and trend-tracking agency, agrees that music has a
powerful influence on fashion. Young people ''take their cues from
their music heroes.'' Consider Britney Spears' midriff-baring,
low-rise outfits, the sexy, form-fitting shirts and leather pants
worn by Kravitz and, more recently, the '70s-inspired tunics recently
seen on rapper Ja Rule.</TE>
<TE>   ''The fashion of music all trickles down eventually,'' says
Julian, especially the fashion of music television. Indeed, this
fall, MTV--with its video programming and youth magnet shows such as
"TRL," "Cribs," "Undressed" and "The Osbournes"--is indisputably the
Home Shopping Network for fashion cloning.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the relationship between rock and fashion was fixed
long before anyone even dreamed of a 24-hour music video channel.</TE>
<TE>   ''The big-time connection between fashion and music really kicked
in when the Beatles hit America,'' says David Wolfe, creative
director of New York-based the Doneger Group, a fashion trend
consulting firm. ''They represented so much fashion style with their
Liverpool cool look'' that included lapel-free Pierre Cardin-like
suits, silk ties, button-down shirts and shaggy hair. Even their
girlfriends, in their Mary Quant miniskirts, became trendsetters.</TE>
<TE>   Vogue magazine dubbed the British pop culture invasion the "youth
quake," and Americans loved it. We embraced the looks that were
fueled by Jean Shrimpton, Twiggy and others. The styles soon were
reinterpreted by designers such as Cardin and Andre Courreges, who
offered mini dresses with mid-calf boots--that were in turn knocked
off by go-go boot-clad teenagers in the '60s versions of music
television: ''Hullabaloo'' and ''Shindig.''</TE>
<TE>   And that was just the beginning. As the '60s waned, the hippie
look soon took over, with Janis Joplin draped in tie-dye tops and
patchwork jeans, a style that has been revived. The early '70s
collaboration of designer Vivienne Westwood and Malcolm McLaren, the
father of punk, resulted in the Sex Pistols and their
slashed-to-ribbons and safety-pin-adorned garments, influential looks
that have had staying power. In the late 1970s, performers such as
the Bee Gees donned platform shoes and clingy disco clothes that
became the rock fashion statement of that time. Designers Stephen
Burrows, Betsey Johnson and Norma Kamali produced leotards, hot pants
and stretch jeans that allowed ease of movement for disco dancing.
The clothing manufacturer Danskin marketed its leotard with matching
tights and wraparound skirts as disco wear.</TE>
<TE>   As MTV took baby steps in the early '80s, Prince, Michael Jackson,
Boy George, Jon Bon Jovi and Cyndi Lauper followed along. The '90s
saw the emergence of rap looks that begat today's hip-hop styles,
just another ingredient in the rock fashion soup that merges
seamlessly with music.</TE>
<TE>   And, of course, there's Madonna, a major influence in the music
and fashion worlds for almost 20 years. Ruth P. Rubinstein, who
teaches a Clothing and Society course at New York's Fashion Institute
of Technology and is the author of ''Dress Codes: Meanings and
Messages in American Culture,'' cites the singer's wide variety of
looks, ranging from Jean Paul Gaultier space-age Dixie-cup bras to
the Burberry plaid number she recently wore at a concert. ''Right
now, guys and girls are walking around New York in something Burberry
because Madonna wore it.''</TE>
<TE>   The trend of the future is individualization, both in music and
fashion. ''When it comes to fashion, anything goes because there is
so much to choose from,'' says Roger Selbert, Santa Monica-based
trend analyst and editor and publisher of Growth Strategies, a
biweekly report that tracks trends. ''It's been a long time since the
fashion mavens could dictate what was acceptable. Now basically there
is very little that is unacceptable. Looks are no longer handed down
from a single fashionista. They're coming from music in all
directions. What you do with that is up to the individual.''</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles clothing designer Freddie Rojas understands
individualism. ''Young people today see the synergy between music and
fashion. They see something in a video and reinterpret that look for
themselves,'' says Rojas, who has created garments for Gwen Stefani,
Spears, Madonna and Janet Jackson and designs for Private by Rojas
for the Private Circle label.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, in every office of Hot Topic, a national chain with 401
stores that sell music-influenced merchandise, including clothing
knock-offs worn by video and concert performers as well as
concert-goers, MTV is on. "We can see what's hip from the bands to
the VJs to the people in commercials," says Cindy Levitt, vice
president and general merchandise manager. "Videos are our driving
fashion force.''</TE>
<TE>   So are the weekend concerts that staff and store buyers are
encouraged to attend. Every Tuesday they gather to talk about ''what
we saw kids wearing,'' she says. Recently, suppliers created the
black shirts and white ties worn by the Hives, an indie band popular
with customers. ''We jumped on it and got them made,'' Levitt says
about the sellers that are a throwback to the '60s mod look. The City
of Industry company also offers what Levitt calls the ''very current
emo look''--vintage narrow trousers and retro striped polo shirts for
fans of emo music, which she describes as ''emotional hard-core punk
that's whiny with feeling, but sensitive.'' The look is classic
thrift store and worn by the bands Weezer, Saves the Day, Dashboard
Confessional and the Get Up Kids.</TE>
<TE>   Hope Brick, vice president and fashion director for Robinsons-May
department stores, says she tells her staff and store personnel to
watch music videos for today's fashion direction because ''industry
wide, it's coming from the music scene from highly visible artists.''
That also includes the breakout stars from "American Idol" and their
fashions, such as belts worn as chokers that Brick will feature on
mannequins this fall.</TE>
<TE>   These days, my closet is more gq than Bee Gees. And my musical
tastes have shifted, too. But the late '70s and early '80s were my
salad days. Back then, I had the fever: long Bee Gee-style hair, a
Tony Orlando bushy upper lip and a Travolta shake-your-groove-thing
strut. I was just out of college and working my first full-time job:
covering the police beat for a newspaper. Too wired to go home at the
end of my midnight shift, I transformed myself from reporter to disco
king. I loved the nightlife. I had to boogie on the disco round. I
knew the words to every hit: ''Disco Inferno,'' ''Staying Alive,''
Donna Summer's remixes.</TE>
<TE>   I would make a beeline to my favorite discos during my
off-hours--a poly-wrapped fool--raw in my pursuit for the right to
party, to get lost in the music and the sexually charged clothes that
went with the package.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back, I realize why I was under the spell of that era's
music and fashion. Under spinning mirrored balls, the fusion of the
two allowed me to be carefree without the worry of making a deadline.</TE>
<TE>   Like other musical tastes that came before and followed, the disco
sound and its fans longed for freedom. Quite simply, that's why the
art of music and the art of fashion will always be intertwined. I
proved it. In tight-fitting, wrinkle-free, dirt-repellent flared
pants and a navel-revealing shirt, accessorized with chains and
medallions, I bumped and hustled, turned the beat around and chanted
to the sounds that influenced my feverish look. I stood proud and
tall--hey, I was in platforms.</TE>
<TE>   And like Gloria Gaynor, I survived.</TE>

<DH>James Perse Makes Casual Sophistication Look Easy</DH>

<LD>Like father, like son? Not when it comes to James Perse, whose
father, Tommy, owns L.A.'s out-there style emporium Maxfield. Perse
pere may be known as the man who brought Yohji Yamamoto to L.A., but
his designer son prefers plain old T-shirts. "It took years 'til my
dad would wear my stuff," says 30-year-old James. "But now,
underneath his wild get-ups, he wears my T-shirts."</LD>
<LD>   Perse had an easier time getting musicians such as Moby and the
members of Incubus, and stars such as Billy Bob Thornton and Matt
Damon, into his famously soft, high-end Ts, which range from $38 to
$78 and are comfy enough to sleep in but sleek enough for a dinner
date. Perse, who attended college for a year but didn't study
fashion, got into design a decade ago simply because he wanted a
better baseball cap. "This was right when baseball caps were becoming
designer [items]," he says. "All the hats out there were horrible and
had the wrong shapes, the wrong fabrics, the wrong logos. I wanted to
help bring a designer look to promotional merchandise. I tried to
make it better." To get a company to produce his cap, Perse had to
order 100. He took the risk and put the lot up for sale in his
father's store. The caps sold out, attracting orders from Martin
Scorsese (for his 50th birthday party), the Hard Rock Cafe, Planet
Hollywood and other corporations.</LD>
<TE>   Next, Perse wanted his own line, and he created a fitted deep
V-neck T in high-quality cotton for women. He added menswear four
years ago and now counts Luke Wilson, Brad Pitt and several bands as
steady customers. Though he makes specialty items such as the dark
brown thigh-length cloak that magician David Blaine recently wore for
a stunt in New York's Bryant Park, the men's retail line remains
simple. Loose trousers and dressier shirts have joined the Ts, many
bearing the faux family crest and medieval lion print that have
marked the line from the start.</TE>
<TE>   "Casual sophistication" is an overused phrase in fashion, but
Perse has made a specialty of his elegant take on the California
aesthetic. "Often when people think of California, they think of
surfers, [but] there's a much more sophisticated lifestyle that's
really going on around here," he says. "Believe it or not, it's
amazing the number of things you can do with a T-shirt."</TE>

<DH>The Food at Chez Mimi Is Simple and Nostalgic</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. IRENE VIRBILA</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Above the kitchen doorway, Chez Mimi is spelled out in cornflower
blue tiles. From behind the desk in her cluttered office, where
cookbooks lean together like old friends, Mimi (short for Micheline)
Hebert presides over her namesake Santa Monica restaurant.</LD>
<LD>   A generously sized woman given to capacious dresses and a Louise
Brooks bob, she spends the night fielding phone calls and writing out
bills. Old customers and friends may lean in the doorway to chat a
minute, yet Hebert all the while keeps a careful eye on the kitchen.
The French-Canadian turned up in Los Angeles back in the late '70s as
the chef and part-owner of the little French cafe Chez Helene in
Venice.</LD>
<LD>   Hebert eventually bought out her employers and moved Chez Helene
to a pretty brick cottage in Beverly Hills. Next to the pretensions
of restaurants like Bistro Garden, Chez Helene was a breath of fresh
air, a simple French restaurant where you could find a good roast
chicken, a fine gigot, or a proper tarte tatin. But every restaurant
has a life span, and after 11 years in the same location, when Hebert
got an offer good enough, she sold out with the idea of taking some
time off to write a cookbook.</LD>
<TE>   It never happened because soon after, she found an even better
space on 26th Street in Santa Monica, a trio of cottage-like dining
rooms with a courtyard patio that joins all three. That was nearly
five years ago, and Hebert has never looked back. At Chez Mimi, she's
serving more people than ever, especially during the summer, when she
fills both inside and outside every night.</TE>
<TE>   She may have moved two times, but, curiously, Hebert's menu
remains the same, even though it purports to be seasonal. She serves
cassoulet in August, and onion soup, too. Her kitchen is unwavering
in its devotion to an ideal of French cuisine entrenched in the past.
Safe to say she's never been tempted by nouvelle or any other current
that's swept through French kitchens in the past 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   At Chez Mimi, she's serving the kind of French food restaurants
served in this country as Julia Child published her first cookbook.
Mimi's pate, for example, is reminiscent of Julia's chicken liver
mousse, which graduate students by the hundreds conjured up in the
their blenders from chicken livers, onions, butter and a touch of
Cognac. Hebert's onion soup, crusted with a wad of oily cheese, is
the sort that countless little bistros around Les Halles, the old
marketplace in Paris, used to serve in the early hours of the
morning.</TE>
<TE>   Some of her nostalgic dishes are delicious. I love her chilled
cucumber soup swirled with cream and garnished with scissored dill,
or the soothing vichyssoise. Escargots are tender and big, with an
ineffably earthy taste. They're served in plenty of the standard
garlic and parsley butter. Her mushroom salad is simply sliced brown
button mushrooms marinated in a lovely vinaigrette and set on a few
leaves of lettuce. It's so unusual now to get a salad that doesn't
have a riot of ingredients that this one stands out. She lets the
mushrooms speak for themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Among the main courses, poulet Chez Helene, roasted chicken
perfumed with lemon and rosemary, is as homey as it gets. Her gigot
d'agneau, roasted leg of lamb, isn't a bit rosy, but the taste is
perfect, served simply in a splash of natural juices. Calf liver is
excellent, still pink in the center, served with mashed potatoes and
carrots.</TE>
<TE>   One night, I order truite aux amandes simply because you never see
it on a menu anymore. But the trout, sad to say, is overcooked and
doesn't have much flavor, it still has lovely bits of crisp skin and
is showered with handfuls of golden toasted almonds.</TE>
<TE>   Hebert is not the kind of chef who spends a lot of time searching
for the perfect product. It's all basic, fresh, but nothing special.
She relies more on the genius of French cooking to accomplish that
sleight of hand of turning the mundane into the delicious, which
works sometimes and not others.</TE>
<TE>   The cassoulet, even if you had an appetite for it in the August
heat, is an oddball version dominated by so much tomato it tastes as
if an entire can of tomato sauce had been tipped into one serving.
The taste is more like cassoulet crossed with Boston baked beans. The
best part is the rich pork sausage.</TE>
<TE>   Bouillabaisse is more of a warm weather dish, and though she gets
the elusive taste of the broth right, everything in it is woefully
overcooked--the lobster, the chewy mussels, the fish. It is not her
proudest moment.</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, the wine list is uninspired. The regular list
doesn't give the vintages for white or red wines. It's better to head
straight for the two-page "special limited selections" insert in the
middle, which not only lists the vintages but describes the style of
the wines and which dishes they might best accompany.</TE>
<TE>   Come dessert, skip the floury, sweet lemon tart for her gateau au
chocolat, a delightful rendition of flourless chocolate cake, or for
a classic creme brulee. She has one homey dessert I've seen only in a
Quebecois cookbook. It's essentially a cake-like pudding called
chomeur, laced with either caramel or raspberries. It's rather
sugary, so best to cut it with some vanilla ice cream. It's touches
like this unpretentious sweet that bring customers back again and
again. It's certainly not the service, which can be distracted and
uninformed.</TE>
<TE>   Hebert has a knack for creating an inviting, slightly bohemian
ambience. Each of the dining rooms is tastefully decorated with flea
market chic--a smoky mirror here, candles there, garden chairs with
French ticking cushions, a charming painting. Potted geraniums,
rosemary and flowering plants decorate the pretty courtyard, making
Chez Mimi feel like a country French auberge. If the food was less
formulaic and every dish rang true, you would never be able to get a
table.</TE>
