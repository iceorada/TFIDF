<HD>A Former Lawyer Tries Something New</HD>
<DH>Theater* At midlife, the first prosecutor in a famed
Savannah murder case has struck out on a new path: actor and
playwright.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BOEHM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If a young prosecutor had not been outfoxed by the defense 20 years
ago in Savannah, Ga., "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil," one
of the best-selling books of the 1990s, would not have been written.</LD>
<LD>   Clint Eastwood would not have produced and directed the film
version starring Kevin Spacey and John Cusack.</LD>
<LD>   And the prosecutor, Dep Kirkland, would not now have an
attention-grabbing calling card while making his rounds of Hollywood
as an aspiring writer-actor.</LD>
<TE>   In pursuing his radical midlife make-over--at the cost of his law
career and the affluence it brought--Kirkland's link to a celebrated
murder trial has helped him get his foot in the door. He's staking
his hopes on "MsTrial," the play he wrote and stars in at the Court
Theatre in West Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Kirkland plays John Paris, a star plaintiff's attorney who usually
has his way in court--and then, during a drunken celebration after
winning a big case, forcibly has his way with a female associate. The
critical scene depicts the two in heated embraces that are sexy and
very mutual--until the young woman changes her mind at the last
moment. She asks, then screams, for Paris to stop, and he ignores
her.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the play is about what happens in Paris' conscience
and in a legal system that must try to establish guilt or innocence
and mete out just punishment.</TE>
<TE>   "I like to explore the gray areas, the underbelly of life, the
complicated areas," Kirkland says. "Life is just not simple."</TE>
<TE>   One thing that seemed simple enough to Kirkland was the guilt of
Jim Williams, the defendant in "Midnight in the Garden." In 1981,
Danny Hansford, the sometime-employee, sometime-lover of Williams, a
wealthy Savannah antiques dealer, was found shot dead. The police
called Kirkland that night, and the corpse, with three bullet holes
in it, was still warm when he got to the scene.</TE>
<TE>   Williams pleaded self-defense; the jury found that Kirkland and
his boss, Dist. Atty. Spencer Lawton Jr., who tried the case
together, had proved it was murder. But the guilty verdict was
overturned by the Georgia Supreme Court because of problems with a
police officer's testimony. During the trial, the defense questioned
whether what the officer said on the stand about a previous
altercation between Williams and Hansford contradicted his written
report. Kirk- land says he could have erased any problem for the
prosecution by insisting that the judge show the report to the
defense. Instead, Kirk- land acquiesced when Williams' attorney,
Bobby Lee Cook, said he would take Kirkland's word for it that the
officer's testimony was complete. Then Cook won the appeal by arguing
that it was not--and that the prosecution had unjustly withheld
details from the written report.</TE>
<TE>   "We got snookered," recalls Lawton, still the district attorney in
Savannah. "It was a right brilliant, although in my opinion unsavory,
tactic on the defense's part. Dep is an excellent lawyer, and he did
everything he could have."</TE>
<TE>   Williams would have three more trials, ending with an acquittal in
1989. Seven months later, he was dead of pneumonia. Writer John
Berendt met Williams shortly after the first trial and decided three
years later to write a book about Savannah's quirky socialites and
its weird demimonde of voodoos and transvestites.</TE>
<TE>   By the time of Williams' second trial, Kirkland was on to other
things, having been appointed by the governor to represent Georgia's
citizenry in negotiations to set utility rates. Later he was private
counsel to the satellite TV industry and to the Edison Project, which
holds contracts around the country to run troubled public schools.
Kirkland was named a Life Fellow by the State Bar of Georgia--a
distinction reserved for 3% of the membership who show "outstanding
legal abilities and a devotion to their communities."</TE>
<TE>   Then, about nine years ago, he decided he'd had it with the law.
Deep down, he says, he knew from his first day at the University of
Georgia law school that it wasn't for him. "I ended up staying
because I didn't have the guts to say 'no,' and I ended up doing
fairly well only because I didn't have the guts to fail."</TE>
<TE>   He became a bartender in Atlanta. His marriage ended and his
ex-wife moved to Florida with their two daughters, now 18 and 14. He
began taking acting courses and, in 1996, he moved to New York City.</TE>
<TE>   "He lived in a little dump on 3rd Avenue," said Fred Kareman,
Kirkland's acting teacher in New York, "and here's a guy who I'm sure
made a good buck in his day, and he never complained about it."</TE>
<TE>   Kareman saw a spark in Kirkland's playwriting, which began with
monologues he wrote to deliver in class. Kareman suggested he send
his scripts to one of his former students, Bill Block, a Hollywood
executive.</TE>
<TE>   Block read "MsTrial" about a year ago and set in motion the chain
of events that brought Kirkland to L.A. He arrived three months ago
and has been living in Burbank on the fold-out couch of a friend of a
friend.</TE>
<TE>   Kirkland already has learned some of Hollywood's rituals and
taboos--including telling an interviewer that his age is "a trade
secret." If old press clips from the Savannah Morning News are right,
he is 52 or 53 as he tries to make it as a neophyte in a business in
which ageism is endemic.</TE>
<TE>   "Your writing's richer if you've been around," Kirkland says in
his deep, deliberate voice, which holds just a trace of a Southern
accent. "You have to write from the gut, and if it's not there it's
kind of hard to come up with it."</TE>
<TE>   He does not expect people from his past to understand why he would
trade affluence and prestige for his new life.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people thought I was off on some fantasy midlife crisis
trip or something. 'Oh, you're having fun.' But I've worked harder at
this than I've ever worked at anything in my life. It's awfully
demanding if you do it right."</TE>

<HD>Beach Bold</HD>
<DH>Conductor Andreas Mitisek's innovation meshes with Long
Beach Opera's venturesome fare, including Janacek's distinctive
'Jenufa'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAN BRESLAUER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Talk about a splashy entrance. Conductor Andreas Mitisek made his
American debut with Long Beach Opera's 1998 wild and crazy staging of
Henry Purcell's "The Indian Queen." He was dressed for the
part--decked out in skintight leather in lieu of the traditional tux
and tails.</LD>
<LD>   Conceived by performance artist Guillermo Gomez-Pena and director
David Schweizer, that production was pronounced "a dazzling mess" by
Times music critic Mark Swed. The creators took John Dryden's
nonsensical Restoration play about Peruvian Incas and Mexican Aztecs,
along with Purcell's luminous Baroque interludes, and gave it a
Chicano politicizing once-over.</LD>
<LD>   The result mixed rappers and drug lords with Aztec gods and a
dominatrix queen. At the same time, according to Swed, "The Indian
Queen" turned in some "sparkling" music making--thanks to Mitisek's
leadership of the Musica Angelica Baroque Orchestra.</LD>
<TE>   The key to that success, says the conductor, is shared priorities
at the top. Mitisek and Long Beach Opera general director Michael
Milenski place a premium on innovation and theatricality. "I do
music-theater because I'm interested in what's going on on the other
side of the orchestra pit," says Mitisek, seated in the Carpenter
Center greenroom during a recent afternoon's rehearsal break. "I like
to be challenged, that's part of the game."</TE>
<TE>   Which helps explain why Mitisek has become a welcome fixture at
Long Beach Opera. Now the company's principal conductor, he returns
for the fifth time, leading Leos Janacek's "Jenufa" Sunday and next
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "As a conductor, I'm there to take care of what the composer
wants," he says, "but I'm also there to maybe give the stage director
some ideas about what this music is about."</TE>
<TE>   Difficult Music for Any Size Company</TE>
<TE>   Milenski is definitely a Mitisek cheerleader.</TE>
<TE>   "His ability to communicate with the pit musicians has brought
superb orchestral performances, and we are talking about some of the
most difficult music in the operatic repertory," LBO's founder says.
The list of composers includes Bela Bartok, Richard Strauss and Luigi
Dallapiccola.</TE>
<TE>   "Andreas has a deep sense of the orchestra--he is Viennese after
all. This has contributed enormously to LBO's ability to pull off
repertory ordinarily left untouched by small--and large--companies.
His artistic input will increase over the next several years, both as
a conductor and as a collaborator."</TE>
<TE>   "Jenufa," written in 1903, is a good example of what Milenski
refers to as "repertory ordinarily left untouched"--the kind of fare
that is ever-venturesome Long Beach Opera's forte. Janacek's first
major success and his best-known work, "Jenufa" tells the story of a
pregnant girl who gets caught between two men who desire her and the
strong-willed foster mother who tries to control her fate.</TE>
<TE>   The most distinctive quality of the opera, in Mitisek's view, is
an aural vocabulary that will probably be unfamiliar to American
audiences. "Janacek was very interested in folk music and he
collected lots of Bohemian folk tunes," he says. "That's a kind of
music that you don't know over here.</TE>
<TE>   "You find it in phrases, in tone colors, in little melodies and,
of course, the language itself, which mostly is emphasized on the
first syllable. He was very distinctive about giving the character of
the language to his melodies, so they had a certain rhythmic
quality."</TE>
<TE>   Janacek's methods included a kind of documentary approach,
collecting the "music" of everyday life. "He made all these notes
about how people would say things," says Mitisek. "He listened to
people on the street, young girls yelling after someone, and he would
write down the intervals, how it sounded when the wind went through
the leaves. Those colors came into his scores."</TE>
<TE>   At Age 25, Launched Vienna Opera Theater</TE>
<TE>   The bulging biceps and cargo pants make him look the part of a
California guy, but the accent betrays him. Mitisek, now 37, was born
and raised in Vienna, and is still based there.</TE>
<TE>   "I fulfill the cliche, I have to say," he says, as though to
apologize for the lack of a more exotic biography. "I grew up there
and I studied at the conservatory at the music university in Vienna."
His studies emphasized Baroque music, with majors in organ,
harpsichord and piano.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, he didn't have a particular interest in opera. But
while pursuing instrumental studies, he also held a part-time job at
the conservatory as a vocal coach. That's what got him started.</TE>
<TE>   In particular, Mitisek developed an affinity for 20th century
works. At age 25, he and a friend launched the Vienna Opera Theater.</TE>
<TE>   "We had this crazy idea about contemporary music," he says. "It's
something that was not there in Vienna. There was all the traditional
repertoire, operetta, everything else."</TE>
<TE>   Mitisek spent six years as music director of the company. "It can
be just a little bit compared to what Long Beach Opera does," he
says. "We did only contemporary works, pieces like 'Nixon in China'
for example, which Michael had come to see. And it was quite
successful."</TE>
<TE>   Launching a company is a huge undertaking at any age, but Mitisek
was particularly young. "There are some things you do and later on,
you can never imagine how you did that," he says. "When you're young,
you have a fantasy, and you think it will work, and it works. I'm
trying to keep that."</TE>
<TE>   Once Milenski discovered Vienna Opera Theater, the LBO-Mitisek
alliance was sealed, like so much in operatic history, over food and
drink in Austria.</TE>
<TE>   "I originally knew Andreas only as a conductor of 20th century
repertory, with a taste for edgy productions," Milenski recalls.
"Then one evening over schnitzel in Vienna, I happened to mention
that Long Beach Opera was soon to embark on a Latino deconstruction
of Purcell's 'The Indian Queen.' "</TE>
<TE>   The mention of the Baroque work prompted Mitisek to reveal his own
early music roots. "At that point," Milenski says, "there was nothing
to do but invite him to Long Beach for 'La Indian Queen.'</TE>
<TE>   "Once in the pit, Andreas built an amazing rapport with our
orchestra. The following year, when we had a last-minute conductor
cancellation for 'Duke Bluebeard's Castle,' I telephoned Andreas in
Vienna and suggested that he get on the next plane." And he did.</TE>
<TE>   Next, Milenski called upon Mitisek to conduct LBO's 2000 double
bill of Italian works: Puccini's "The Cloak" and "Night Flight" by
Dallapiccola. And then last year's "Elektra," by Strauss. In addition
to his Long Beach engagements, Mitisek has taken recent turns on
opera podiums in Austin, Texas; Seattle; and Eugene, Ore. He has also
continued working in Europe, notably in Berlin and Vienna.</TE>
<TE>   He isn't averse to drawing comparisons between the two opera
universes. In the U.S., he says, "usually you have less rehearsals.
You just have to be much more clear about what you want and how fast
you can get that. Actually, I like that."</TE>
<TE>   The American musical way seems to suit him. "It's a different
mentality compared to Europe," says Mitisek. "Opera is still very
young over here, still a very new thing. For many people, they have
never been confronted with it. It is interesting to see how people
can get excited about something they have never experienced."</TE>

<HD>R. Kelly Is Released After Posting Bond</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>CHICAGO -- Grammy Award-winning singing star R. Kelly reported to
Chicago authorities Friday to face child pornography charges and was
released after posting bond, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Kelly, whose first name is Robert, arrived in Chicago on a
chartered jet from Florida, where he spent Wednesday night in jail
after his arrest outside his rented home in Davenport, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   Kelly and his lawyer, Edward Genson, showed up at the Cook County
Criminal Courts building, but he was taken to a nearby police station
to be fingerprinted and to have a mug shot taken, police said.</LD>
<TE>   Genson was angry that the booking didn't take place at the
courthouse, but an officer at the station said, "He was processed
like anyone else."</TE>
<TE>   Kelly, an R&amp;B singer whose songs have topped the charts for a
decade, posted the required $75,000 bond, which is 10% of the
$750,000 called for in his arrest warrant, and was released.</TE>
<TE>   The singer, who lives in suburban Chicago, was arrested Wednesday
and jailed overnight before being released Thursday. The Florida
judge ordered that he have no contact with minors outside his family.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Chicago authorities unveiled an indictment charging
Kelly with 21 counts of child pornography over a videotape that
allegedly shows him engaging in sex acts at his former Chicago home
with an underage girl. He could face up to 15 years in prison and a
fine of $100,000 if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly has denied that the person on the tape is him. Genson said
the girl pictured on the tape was not underage and that Kelly would
plead innocent.</TE>

<HD>An Undulating Vision of the Future</HD>
<DH>Neil Denari's design work moves at last off the computer
screen and onto an L.A. street. It's a sign of things to come.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the last few years, Los Angeles has seen a slow but steady influx
of young new architectural talents, most drawn by the city's
reputation as a place of architectural experimentation.</LD>
<LD>   Armed with new computer technologies and a tough, urban
sensibility, these architects have been breaking aesthetic ground.</LD>
<LD>   Their designs, mostly theoretical, range from projects that have
the faceted, militaristic look of Stealth bombers to a sleek, organic
sensuality. Yet the number of clients willing to build such
experimental visions has remained remarkably small.</LD>
<TE>   The career of 44-year-old Neil Denari epitomizes that dilemma.
Denari moved here from Manhattan in 1996, opening a two-man office in
a dilapidated section of Koreatown.</TE>
<TE>   As his reputation grew, he was tapped to head the Southern
California Institute for Architecture, one of the country's most
progressive architecture schools. During his four-year tenure there,
from 1997 to 2001, Denari engineered the school's move from Mar Vista
to its current location along the L.A. River in downtown's warehouse
district.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Denari has had particular trouble getting his designs
off the computer screen and into the real world. His only built work
to date is Gallery MA in Tokyo, a sleek, futuristic art space
completed in 1996 and demolished one year later. A more recent design
for the Arlington Museum of Art in Texas was abandoned late last year
when the museum scaled back its building plans.</TE>
<TE>   So the completion of Denari's design for a $400,000 L.A. Eyeworks
store at 7386 Beverly Blvd. at Martel Avenue marks a significant
turning point in his career. Eyeworks has been designing frames for
the excruciatingly chic since 1979, and the store is a key part of an
effort to update its brand image for a younger generation of
hipsters.</TE>
<TE>   Denari, meanwhile, has long been obsessed with the notion of
architecture's function as a marketing tool. The design's smooth,
sinuous forms, which unravel through the space like ribbon candy,
embody ideas Denari has been refining for more than a decade. Despite
its modest scale, the project should instantly establish him as an
important architectural voice in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The shop occupies an existing two-story building on a corner lot.
On the second floor, the building's original curved stucco facade
remains intact. Below, Denari replaced the entry with a delicate
glass storefront that is set back slightly from the street, as if the
facade had been surgically repaired and a series of delicate
instruments inserted inside. A concrete bench is set along the base
of a large window. Above, a thin beam extends from the top of the
door across the facade, its form bending up at one end to support the
store logo. An LED screen embedded in the beam's front edge will
flash witty aphorisms to passing pedestrians, much like a Jenny
Holtzer artwork.</TE>
<TE>   The store is a narrow loft-like space. A low display counter,
built at the same level as the bench outdoors, extends toward the
back of the room, eventually tilting up at one end to support a sleek
full-length mirror. On the opposite wall, the sleek form of a shelf
wraps around a wall-mounted display cabinet, dropping down to create
a sales counter at the back of the room.</TE>
<TE>   The room's most dramatic architectural flourish is an undulating
interior canopy that unfurls from the top of the entrance along the
length of the ceiling. Painted a soft china blue, it is pierced by a
series of lozenge-shaped openings.</TE>
<TE>   The effect of the forms is to create an almost seamless sense of
flow from one part of the room to the other. But the dreamy quality
of the spaces also stems from their high degree of abstraction. This
is in part the result of the lighting.</TE>
<TE>   To avoid distracting shadows on customers trying on glasses, the
owners demanded an even, ambient light.</TE>
<TE>   A diffuse florescent light is reflected off the ceiling above the
interior canopy, while a slightly more focused light spills down
through a deep skylight, giving the entire space an even, eerie glow.</TE>
<TE>   Other details give the design a more clinical edge. Stools,
counters and benches are set on rollers so they can be moved easily
around the store. Their bases are made of brushed stainless-steel
plates, and hard, medical-green cushions are bolted to their
surfaces.</TE>
<TE>   A "dispensing table," where glasses are fitted, has a hard plastic
top, with molded indentations for fitting devices and a portable
computer.</TE>
<TE>   At times like this, Denari's penchant for sleek, sanitized
surfaces can get a little scary, and the design begins to evoke the
chill of a dentist's office. What breaks the mood, finally, is a
sculpture by artist Jim Isermann, which dominates an entire wall
toward the back of the space.</TE>
<TE>   A series of vertical, gently undulating panels, the wall is
conceived as an optical game, its forms seeming to drift in and out
of shadow, as if its surface were softly breathing. (The work fits
snugly into its context and marks a rare successful collaboration
between architect and artist.)</TE>
<TE>   In the end, whether Denari's high-tech fetishism is your cup of
tea is a matter of taste.</TE>
<TE>   What is certain, however, is that as a generation of architects
becomes more fluent with computer technologies and more companies
begin to see architecture as a convenient way to shape their public
images, such slick aesthetic experiments will become more common.</TE>
<TE>   The L.A. Eyeworks store is a well-crafted lens into that future.
And Denari is emerging as one of its most articulate advocates.</TE>
<TE>   His work is not for the funky or touchy-feely. But you may want to
borrow the glasses of the voyeur and take a peek.</TE>

<LD>Amanda Burton proved to be a formidable performer in "Silent
Witness," the first-rate A&amp;E films about a sharp medical examiner.
Tonight, she takes on a new persona in the title role of the TV movie
"Helen West: Deep Sleep" (9 p.m., A&amp;E).</LD>
<LD>   This is the first of three mysteries--the others are due this
fall--drawn from books by Frances Fyfield about a British prosecutor
in London.</LD>
<LD>   Watchable as it is, the deliberately paced drama adapted by
Jacqueline Holborough lacks the snap and psychological edge of
Burton's previous project.</LD>
<TE>   As "Deep Sleep" opens, West is recovering from the removal of a
cyst. In another part of the city, trusted pharmacist Phillip Carlton
(Dermot Crowley) runs his small business with Kim (Annabelle Apsion),
a divorced woman raising a 10-year-old son.</TE>
<TE>   Unexpectedly--or is it murder?--Carlton's wife dies in her sleep
while he's attending an overnight conference. Returning to her
office, a healthy West promptly suspects foul play when traces of
chloroform are found in the wife's blood. Afterward, Kim copes with a
disgruntled ex-husband (Ian Puleston-Davies), and West plays her
hunches with help from attentive boyfriend Chief Superintendent
Bailey (Conor Mullen).</TE>
<TE>   And, oh yes, there's another fellow whose casual observation costs
him his life.</TE>
<TE>   Modestly intriguing, the film devotes more time to supporting
players than to its protagonist. As a result, it barely scratches the
surface of West's character and wastes the talents of Burton, a
subtle, skillful actress who should be the focal point here.</TE>

<HD>Barretto Turns Jazz Bakery Into Rhythm Central</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At a time when the term "Latin jazz" has become inclusive enough to
embrace everything from salsa to son, from stirring dance rhythms to
call-and-response vocals, it's always a pleasure to hear the way Ray
Barretto's music focuses into a clear jazz perspective.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday at the Jazz Bakery, in one of his periodic and always
pleasurable visits to the Southland, he led the current installment
of his New World Spirit group through a collection of tunes in which
stirring improvisation was supported by a hard-driving rhythm section
and Barretto's dynamic conga playing.</LD>
<LD>   Barretto's illustrious jazz history embraces recordings and
performances with Wes Montgomery, George Benson, Gene Ammons, Mongo
Santamaria, Lou Donaldson and dozens of others. And the insights
gained from working with so many different stylists were constantly
present in his playing.</LD>
<TE>   Although he is fully capable of virtuosic brilliance--which he
didn't hesitate to display on several numbers--he also offered more
laid-back, subtle sounds, as well. Stroking his drums softly, tapping
out tiny accents on their edges, generating low, rumbling textures,
he played a constantly illuminating role in bringing his bop-tinged
music to life.</TE>
<TE>   This version of New World Spirit included a frequent Barretto
associate, saxophonist Adam Kolker, as well as trumpeter John Bailey,
Venezuelan pianist Luis Perdomo, bassist Boris Kozlov and drummer
Vince Cherico. And the musical blend worked well in a far-ranging set
of material that included everything from ballads such as "My Ideal"
to Randy Weston's perky "Hi-Fly."</TE>
<TE>   In each case, Barretto transformed the original material into a
steaming caldron of rhythm supporting fine soloing from Perdomo,
Kolker and Cherico. Perdomo--yet another gifted South American jazz
pianist--delivered several particularly thoughtful improvisations
filled with arching melodic fragments and bursts of dark-textured
chording. He's a talent to watch.</TE>
<TE>   And drummer Cherico successfully accomplished the not-always-easy
task of blending his straight-ahead jazz rhythms with Barretto's
congas, while soloing with the same sort of subtlety that
characterized the work of each of the performers in this stellar,
eminently listenable Latin jazz ensemble.</TE>

law passed that would make it a federal crime to rent or sell video
games containing violence, prostitution or drug use to people under
17. They'll have to experience that kind of behavior like the rest of
us--by watching the news." (Ira Lawson)</LD>

robbed a Starbucks restaurant. They didn't find enough money in the
safe, so they proceeded to work the drive-thru window for half an
hour. They sold 10 lattes, five cappuccinos--and made $26,000." (Jay

<LD>The Tonys, once the classiest awards show televised, is now a long
commercial with a few awards thrown in ("Mostly 'Modern Millie,' " by
Paul Lieberman and Patrick Pacheco, June 3). One commercial break was
six minutes long. Lopping off the extraordinary Elaine Stritch is
unforgivable, as well as PBS doing the same to Blythe Danner in the
"First Ten Awards" hour.</LD>
<LD>   And speaking of extraordinary talents, Julie Harris was shown on
tape for about 40 seconds with a voice-over explaining she was given
a lifetime award "earlier." A lifetime award but we, the paying
theatergoers, can't even see the presentation.</LD>
<LD>   This treatment of wonderful New York people, not to mention the
audience rebuff, is criminal.</LD>
<TE>   NAN WILLIAMS</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cutting off Elaine Stritch's Tony acceptance speech was just the
most obvious of the embarrassing slights. There was no time to show
Julie Harris receiving a life achievement award; people were
constantly panicked as the orchestra came in during their speeches.</TE>
<TE>   I suggest the Tony committee consider not doing their show on
network television, as CBS obviously doesn't respect the American
Theatre Wing's awards and would rather show their regular fare in
that time. I suggest they take the awards elsewhere: Have the whole
show on PBS or on one of the cable channels like A&amp;E or Bravo, where
they will get more respect.</TE>

<TE>   Am I the only person having trouble with the now constant movement
of cameras during musical performances on television? I was just
beginning to enjoy Bernadette Peters on the Tonys, then suddenly the
camera took off for the back of the house, leaving me to only guess
what was going on up on the stage.</TE>
<TE>   Every single number in the show was covered this way--zapping any
buildup of energy from the performers and essentially taking us on a
roller-coaster ride throughout the auditorium.</TE>
<TE>   While I understand the need to keep a show lively through
movement, I also think a musical performer should have the
opportunity to communicate one-on-one with the audience without the
camera swooping back and forth across the room like a housefly.</TE>

<LD>Ted L. Nancy--or perhaps Jerry Seinfeld--may well have been
responsible for the book "Letters From a Nut" and its various
sequels, soon to be the basis of a comedy series pilot on ABC
("Sounds Like the Plot of a 'Seinfeld' Episode," by Lisa de Moraes,
June 1), but he certainly wasn't the first to send outlandish letters
to famous people/companies to see what kind of replies he would get
and publish the results.</LD>
<LD>   That honor belongs to Don Novello of Father Guido Sarducci fame,
author of "The Lazlo Letters: The Amazing, Real-Life, Actual
Correspondence of Lazlo Toth, American!" (1977) and its sequel,
"Citizen Lazlo!: The Continuing, Unrelenting Correspondence of Lazlo
Toth, American!" (1991).</LD>

<LD>Kevin Thomas was far too kind to "The Sum of All Fears" ("A Complex
Nuclear Equation," May 31).</LD>
<LD>   Not only does the cheesy screenplay emphasize all the wrong things
(Ben Affleck's pointless love affair, trucks that won't start,
by-the-book plot mechanisms), we are also struck with Affleck as a
lightweight Jack Ryan. This is a 12-year-old Boy Scout going for a
merit badge, not a CIA agent in training.</LD>
<LD>   But, most important, "The West Wing" has made it impossible for us
to accept the kind of bogus dialogue we are meant to take seriously
between the president of the United States and his advisors.</LD>

<LD>Truly a great thing to pause and examine a fortunate convergence of
"Weilliana" in the recent days here in Southern California. My only
divergence from Mark Swed's vastly appreciated, informative,
well-thought-out criticisms are those leveled at the otherworldly
German chanteuse Ute Lemper, who performed at the Ojai Music Festival
with guitarist Eliot Fisk last Sunday morning ("His Legacy Lives On,"
June 5).</LD>
<LD>   Swed says she "killed Weill with too much slickness," and that she
is "not a very good singer." Whose standards are we using here? No,
obviously, she's not Maria Callas or Beverly Sills or Lena Horne or
Cecilia Bartoli. She's Ute Lemper. That's why all references to her
in program and advertisement billed her as "singer." Not "soprano,"
not "the world's most technically perfect vocal artist." She's a
singer, and an enthralling one. She held that crowd so tightly in her
velvety grasp, that when she concluded with "Speak Low," you could
hear the snap of a twig.</LD>
<LD>   I feel sorry for Swed in that he may have been too busy being a
prominent critic to let down his "cultural guardianship" and simply
enjoy the sounds.</LD>

<HD>Send in the 'Clones'</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I was wondering if I could obtain whatever drug Roger Kaufman is
dipping into ("Real Threat of 'Clones' Is Its Campy Perspective,"
Counterpunch, June 3). After ingestion, I'm sure I would be able to
enjoy movies such as "Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones" and
"Battlefield Earth" for what they truly are: masterpieces of social
commentary.</LD>
<LD>   Alas, I had no pills those fateful days and am sadly convinced
that my dislike must be related to the unexamined emptiness and
alienation within my very soul. Woe is me.</LD>
<LD>   JOSHUA MICHAEL STEVENS</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kaufman makes the argument that "Clones" is campy and sloppy on
purpose. In other words, it was intended to be bad, and that makes it
good, because it succeeds in being bad.</TE>
<TE>   No, Roger. "Clones" is badly written, ham-handedly plotted and
dramatically boring. Really boring. It's bad art and nothing more.</TE>
<TE>   CHARLES BRAGG Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Palisades</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kaufman asks us to believe "Clones" is a metaphor for America's
societal impoverishment and that Lucas' vision reaches special
plateaus of insight and prophecy beyond the provinces of everyday
mortals. If this be clarity, then one might just as well say that Ed
Wood made "Plan 9 From Outer Space" as an enlightened,
elbow-in-the-ribs, tongue-in-cheek spoof of "Dragnet," "Dracula" and
"Invasion of the Body Snatchers."</TE>
<TE>   MICHAEL FERRIS</TE>
<TE>   Malibu</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After yet another--dare I say clonelike?--attack on "Clones" in
Sunday's Calendar, this time by Reed Johnson ("Who's Soaring Now?,"
June 2), it was a wonderful surprise to read Kaufman's thoughtful
analysis in praise of Lucas' brilliantly dark camp critique of our
current system.</TE>
<TE>   As Kaufman suggests, one can best understand Johnson's complaint
that Lucas should "come back to [the real world]" as a reflection of
Johnson's own psychology: a demand for predictably entertaining
fantasy a la "Spider-Man" as a way to escape the fact that Lucas'
complex, provocative and dire vision of our current planetary crisis
is all too frighteningly real.</TE>

<TE>   While "Clones" is better and perhaps deeper than the critics are
allowing, methinks the gentleman doth protest too much. Sometimes a
cigar is just a cigar, and bad dialogue is just bad dialogue.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I'm still reeling from Tony Perry's review of "Smash" at the Old
Globe Theatre in San Diego ("Despite Fine Cast, 'Smash' Isn't a
Success," June 3). Where did he learn his reviewing skills, in
"Theater Reviewing for Dummies"? If I were he, I would return the
book and get my money back.</LD>
<LD>   "Smash" is a rousing comedy, one that engages the audience
visually and verbally. Did Perry mention the period costumes, the
versatile sets, the athleticism of the actors? Did he point out the
audience involvement because of the pacing of the show? Did he
mention Karen Carpenter's unique directing skills? Lighting? Sound?</LD>
<LD>   To our neighbors in L.A.: Come down to the beautiful Globe
production of "Smash." It will take your mind off your troubles and
make you laugh.</LD>

<LD>Mike J. Nichols, in his boastful statement that he has "the
storytelling sense that George Lucas once had and lost," proves that
he is just another member in that small but vocal group of
disgruntled, arrogant and cynical "fans" who believe they know "Star
Wars" better than the films' creator ("A Phantom Menace?," by Richard
Fausset, June 1).</LD>
<LD>   Nichols' "Phantom Edit" is nothing more than a cut-and-paste job
to suit his own cinematic tastes. Like so many others of his ilk, he
has forgotten that the "Star Wars" films are made for the young and
the young-at-heart.</LD>
<LD>   Nichols did not create an entire universe, nor did he bring that
universe to life in a series of remarkable, groundbreaking films.</LD>
<TE>   Instead of wasting his time on what he thinks "Phantom Menace"
should have been, why not spend that time creating his own story and
let Lucas complete the "Star Wars" saga in peace?</TE>

<LD>I have been a subscriber to the L.A. Opera for five years, but never
before have I seen such disregard for the balcony ticket-holders as
was shown in Gian-Carlo del Monaco's production of "Turandot."</LD>
<LD>   I sat in the center of the first row of the balcony, and for a
good portion of the first and second acts I could not see the
singers, because they were so high up on the set that the proscenium
cut off my view. Anyone who sat higher than I did saw even less.</LD>
<LD>   There is no excuse for this disregard of balcony ticket-holders.
We pay for tickets to see an opera; if we want to hear it, we can
listen to the radio for nothing.</LD>
<TE>   Every opera patron who couldn't see what they paid for at
"Turandot" should complain to L.A. Opera and to Placido Domingo, who
will be responsible for future productions as artistic director. Send
your director up to the balcony, Placido!</TE>

<HD>A Quirky Tale of Identity, Family in 'Bobbie's Girl'</HD>

<AU>DARYL H. MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It takes a child to teach the adults in "Bobbie's Girl" how to grow
up.</LD>
<LD>   Ten-year-old Alan (Thomas Sangster) becomes part of the household
depicted in the movie, Sunday at 8 p.m. on cable's Showtime network,
after his parents' death in an auto accident. Their will puts him in
the care of his practical, blunt and sometimes chilly Aunt Bobbie
(Rachel Ward), who runs a seaside pub outside Dublin with her
free-spirited American partner in life, Bailey (Bernadette Peters),
and Bailey's even flightier brother, David (Jonathan Silverman).</LD>
<LD>   The boy's status as the resident grown-up is established right
away, when Bailey, a terrible driver, relies on him to drive them
both home from his boarding school. Improbable yet oddly charming,
this sequence also establishes the movie's style, which hovers
somewhere between fairy tale and quirky art-house attraction. (As
examples of the latter, think: "You Can Count on Me" and "Billy
Elliot.")</LD>
<TE>   As written by Samuel Bernstein and directed by Jeremy Kagan, the
movie somehow manages to include a battle with breast cancer, a fair
amount of theological discussion and a study of Chekhov's "The Three
Sisters" among its broader issues of self-awareness, identity and
family. What's more, the movie is programmed under Showtime's
"pictures for all ages" banner--an invitation for parents to watch
and discuss the show with their children.</TE>
<TE>   The movie comes at a time when lesbian and gay parents across the
country are asking for more legal protections for their families, and
as the Traditional Values Coalition is criticizing the kid-oriented
Nickelodeon cable channel for scheduling a program that will explore
gay parenting. A story with neither heroes nor villains, but plenty
of heart, "Bobbie's Girl" adds its own unique voice to the
discussion.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Bobbie's Girl" can be seen Sunday at 8 p.m. on Showtime. The
network has rated it TV-PG (may be unsuitable for younger children).</TE>

<LD>   'Killers' Held Blameless in Shooting Death</LD>
<LD>   A Louisiana appeals court has upheld a lower court's dismissal of
a lawsuit blaming the Oliver Stone film "Natural Born Killers" for a
young couple's interstate rampage that left a store clerk paralyzed.</LD>
<TE>   The Louisiana Court of Appeal said "Natural Born Killers," a 1994
film starring Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis as a couple on a
killing spree, was entitled to 1st Amendment freedom of speech
protection because nothing within the movie advocated or incited
viewers to commit violence.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit was bought against Warner Bros. Pictures in 1995 by
the family of Patsy Byers, a Louisiana store clerk who was shot by
Sarah Edmondson during a robbery attempt. Edmondson said she and her
boyfriend, Ben Darras, had watched the film repeatedly before
launching a two-state crime spree that year. Byers was left a
quadriplegic and died of cancer two years later.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Simpson, attorney for the Byers family, said they haven't
decided whether to appeal the case to the Louisiana Supreme Court.
"In my opinion, it's hopeless to go any further," he said.</TE>

<TE>   Harrelson: Unwilling Star of Real-Life Drama</TE>
<TE>   The real-life Woody Harrelson was arrested after a bizarre
late-night taxi chase through the streets of London, a British police
source said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Best known for his roles in the hit TV comedy "Cheers" and movies
such as "White Men Can't Jump," the actor was said to have broken an
ashtray and a lock on the door of a cab taking him back to his hotel
from a nightspot in the wee hours of Thursday morning. Harrelson then
jumped into another cab, with the driver of the first taxi chasing
behind.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like something out of Hollywood," the cabbie, Les
Dartnell, told the Sun newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   Officers eventually intercepted the taxi carrying Harrelson and,
after he jumped out of the vehicle, arrested him on suspicion of
criminal damage. He was released on bail and told to return July 1.</TE>
<TE>   Cruz, Morales Honored With Imagen Awards</TE>

Latinos and Latino cultures in the entertainment industry, was held
at the Beverly Hilton Thursday night.</TE>
<TE>   The Disney Channel's "Lizzie McGuire" won for best live-action
children's programming, and Nickelodeon's "Dora the Explorer" was
named best animated children's programming. "Bread and Roses" and
"Tortilla Soup" shared the prize for best theatrical feature film.</TE>

<TE>   Poland Plans to Build  a Jewish Museum</TE>
<TE>   Plans are underway to create a $50-million museum celebrating
centuries of Jewish history in Poland. The building, backed by a
government eager to make amends for decades of Communist persecution
and to strengthen ties with Israel, will be designed by an
architectural team led by Frank Gehry, whose parents emigrated from
the country.</TE>
<TE>   The museum will be built on a plot of city-donated land next to
the monument that marks the site of the Warsaw Ghetto, destroyed by
the Nazis when they crushed an uprising of Jews who were confined
there. Prior to World War II, Polish Jews numbered 3.5 million--10%
of the country's population. Fewer than 20,000 remain.</TE>
<TE>   Besides reconstructing Nalewki Street in the heart of the Jewish
quarter, the museum will include a model of a shtetl, or Polish
village, and at least 50,000 artifacts from Jewish life that have
been collected. The Polish president hopes to lay the cornerstone
next year in anticipation of a 2006 opening.</TE>

<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Singer Jennifer Lopez and her dancer-husband, Cris Judd, who
married on Sept. 29, have separated amicably but have no immediate
plans for divorce, a source told Associated Press Friday. A spokesman
for Lopez declined to confirm or deny the split.... "Spider-Man" has
taken in $358.5 million at the box office domestically, surpassing
"Jurassic Park" to become the fifth-highest-grossing movie of all
time.</TE>

<HD>Doves' Tale: Band Makes Defiant, Joyful Noise</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Doves' singer and bassist Jimi Goodwin gazed at the cheering,
capacity Mayan Theatre crowd on Thursday and reveled in what he
called the "nice, warm reception" the British group was getting. His
palpable bliss might have surprised anyone assuming that a band whose
albums are titled "The Last Broadcast" and "Lost Souls" would
comprise sad cases obsessed with the end of the world.</LD>
<LD>   The undulating, psychedelic buzz-drone at the music's core could
have furthered that impression. But in fact Goodwin, guitarist Jez
Williams and his twin brother, drummer Andy, proved to be no downer,
as their 80-minute set's mood ranged from reassuring to defiant to
just plain joyful.</LD>
<LD>   "Broadcast," the Manchester trio's atmospheric second album,
recently hit No. 1 in the U.K. and has garnered rave reviews. If
Thursday was any indication, the band's U.S. fan base is attentive
and growing, as listeners enthusiastically received the new single
"There Goes the Fear" as well as older tunes such as "Catch the Sun"
and "Sea Song."</LD>
<TE>   The group included a keyboardist for extra texture, as it did
during its L.A. concert debut last year, which reflected allegiances
to the Smiths and New Order along with roots in early '90s Manchester
acid-house pop.</TE>
<TE>   Those influences were present Thursday in such numbers as the
who-cares-what-they-think "Words," but the cosmic sweep of such songs
as "Friday's Dust" (not to mention the trippy light show and film
clips) veered closer to Pink Floyd or, inevitably, Radiohead.</TE>
<TE>   Goodwin frequently switched to acoustic rhythm guitar, while the
players also traded vocals and occasionally swapped instruments.
Rather than seeming affected, these moves kept things sonically
interesting and created a sense of camaraderie that underscored the
positive vibes.</TE>

<HD>Pop: The Next Wave</HD>
<DH>Most winners of the C.O.L.A. Individual Artist Fellowships
build on Warhol's public emphasis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PAGEL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This year's installment of the City of Los Angeles' Individual Artist
Fellowships, "C.O.L.A. 2002," is notable for two reasons. First, a
one-time grant from the National Endowment for the Arts has funded
four additional awards for designers and architects. Second, the
diverse works by the 14 winners are remarkably consistent in the ways
that they update Pop art. If you plan to visit the Warhol
retrospective at the Museum of Contemporary Art, be sure to drive a
few extra blocks to the Japanese American National Museum, where the
paintings, installations and displays by the fellowship recipients
draw on the legacy of the prince of Pop.</LD>
<LD>   Warhol's great achievement was to take modern art public, without
dumbing it down. More than any other 20th century artist, he
transformed the largely private relationship between an artist and
his work into an openly social affair--an unpredictable, often
tempestuous relationship between works and viewers. Art is dead, his
trademark images continue to demonstrate, until it leaves the studio
and stirs an audience's passions. It really comes to life when it
gets a large crowd arguing.</LD>
<TE>   Nearly all of the works in the C.O.L.A. exhibition put a high
priority on art's public component. As big as a billboard, Alexis
Smith's wall painting plays off Robert Indiana's Pop icon, which
spells out the word "Love" against a bright background. In place of
the sweet feeling that named a summer in the 1960s, Smith juxtaposes
less sentimental words: "Lust," "Rust" and "Dust."</TE>
<TE>   Printed to read as a compact sound poem, her Scrabble-like
composition begins as a cheery ditty ("LU-RU-DU") and ends with
stuttering ("ST-ST-ST"). Faster than a blinking eye, it leaps from
Dr. Seuss silliness to Samuel Beckett seriousness. Smith has tipped
each letter "U" at a sharp angle, reminding viewers just whom her
efficient memento mori addresses.</TE>
<TE>   Jo Ann Callis' gigantic painting of a baby's face similarly draws
people into the picture. Rather than treating viewers as if they were
infants--by instructing us just what to think--her portrait presents
a child whose inscrutable expression elicits a wide range of
responses, all of which say more about the viewers than Callis'
provocatively mute painting.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, Linda Stark's potent little paintings and prints show
that art's consequences are more important than an artist's
intentions. Each of her abstract images is a square black field on
which floats a pair of lipstick-red shapes. Inspired by the marks
found on the bellies of female black widow spiders, Stark's vivid
emblems also recall hourglasses, party dresses and lips, either
pursed for a kiss or prepared to whisper a secret.</TE>
<TE>   For their parts, Robbie Conal and Meg Cranston focus on art's
relationship to entertainment, and the political implications of
each. Conal's hand-painted photomontage, which juxtaposes an image of
Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger with one of Archie Bunker yelling
at his son-in-law, suggests that politicians and actors have more in
common than we usually assume. Cranston's installation--six
soapbox-size stages, eight stools and five useful diagrams--invites
viewers to finish five archetypal narratives. Spurred on by small
clues, the real dramas unfold in your imagination.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, Hilja Keading's video projection is tedious and
overbearing. Shot at a rodeo while the national anthem was being
played, her work brings a bit of the outside world into the museum
only to suggest that the outside world is a lot more interesting than
what she has done with it.</TE>
<TE>   Margaret Honda's "Exercise for Untitled Sculpture" falls flat for
different reasons. Formally, it's boring. And the story behind her
sprawling polyethylene piece doesn't help. Discovering that Honda's
monochrome blob once occupied an entire room in a friend's home fails
to redeem its timid self-referentiality.</TE>
<TE>   Attractive landscape paintings by Constance Mallinson and Frank
Romero provide a bit of respite. And Daniel Wheeler's odd landscape
sculpture takes those conventional pleasures into three dimensions.
Titled "My Pompeii" and made of linoleum tiles that have been cut to
follow the faceted contours of a digitized mountain range, his piece
provides a strong link to C.O.L.A.'s design and architecture
category.</TE>
<TE>   Of the works by the four award winners who are in this category,
Michael Worthington's are the most engaging. His playful posters have
much in common with Smith's "Lust/Rust/Dust." Each of the graphic
designer's light-jet prints consists of a pop song's lyrics, printed
in a typeface and palette that put a curious spin on its tempo and
thrust. For example, the words to "All the Young Punks," by the
Clash, collide in superimposed colors.</TE>
<TE>   The other works, by architects Frederick Fisher, Warren W. Wagner
and Cameron McNall, are not as compelling. Part of the problem is
that the curators who selected them have installed them to suggest
that architecture and art are indistinguishable. The press release
puts it this way: "A one-time grant from the NEA has funded
additional awards this year for four artists working in design and
architecture." That's just plain wrong.</TE>
<TE>   By any measure, Wagner is an architect working in architecture.
His display of models, floor plans and elevations addresses the
relationship between a home's materials and the amount of sunshine
that hits them. His comprehensive presentation may be a bit pedantic,
but it's not art.</TE>
<TE>   The same goes for Fisher's six drawings and digital prints.
Although his images of a development in Berlin are tasteful, they are
still architectural studies, sketches made to get a job done.</TE>
<TE>   And McNall is the opposite of an artist working in architecture.
He is an architect who has completed an outdoor art project. On the
rooftops of seven buildings in Hollywood, he mounted the silhouettes
of characters from such movies as "Easy Rider," "North by Northwest"
and "The Wild Bunch." At sunset, McNall's homemade billboards cast
shadows on nearby buildings. At the museum, a dozen photographs, four
models and a videotape document his amusing pieces of in-the-street
theater.</TE>
<TE>   Although architecture and contemporary art are profoundly social
endeavors, they're not the same things. Architecture is the highest
form of building. Art is the highest form of object-making. "C.O.L.A.
2002" would make more sense if its organizers clarified these
differences rather than making a muddle of them. Just because art is
accessible doesn't mean that everyone's an artist.</TE>

<HD>Amplifying 'Don Quixote'</HD>
<DH>The visiting Moscow Stanislavsky Ballet devotes community
effort to the telling of a story.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The best thing about the Moscow Stanislavsky Ballet "Don Quixote" is
the Moscow Stanislavsky Ballet.</LD>
<LD>   Other companies ask their corps and character dancers to stand
around while the stars show off. This one sets everyone dancing along
with the stars, forming a large-scale amplification of the central
action.</LD>
<LD>   It's thrilling and it's also the reason why Russian companies
remain unbeatable: At the Kodak Theatre on Thursday, you saw a whole
community moving from one impulse in one style--impossible in
America, where almost everyone is trained by different teachers
according to different systems, and increasingly rare in Western
Europe.</LD>
<TE>   No matter, then, if the "Don Quixote" sets by M.A. Sokolova prove
cluttered and weirdly feverish, the lighting an outright disaster
(complete with an unscheduled blackout in the middle of Act 1) and
the staging by Alexei Chichinadze hopelessly unfocused. Group energy,
group skill, group feeling obliterates every fault.</TE>
<TE>   Even the audience's mass rush down the aisles at the beginning of
the evening--caused by the company's rehearsing as long as possible
and refusing to open the house until 7:58--suits the ensemble
dynamics of the occasion.</TE>
<TE>   Although the company credits its choreography to Alexander Gorsky,
who created a celebrated "Don Quixote" in 1900, most of the dances
are the same as those found in productions credited to Marius Petipa.
As always, music by "L. Minkus" (Ludwig or Leon depending on which
source you consult) propels the story of young lovers evading a
boorish father (Dmitry Erlikin) and an effete nobleman (Anton
Domashev).</TE>
<TE>   Don Quixote and Sancho Panza (Alexander Kopchinsky and Denis
Perkovsky) remain vague adjuncts to this love story, though Sancho,
in particular, gets several major character dances of impressive
buoyancy in this version.</TE>
<TE>   Also showing up for no evident reason is the matador Espada
(Andrey Shishkin), owner of the sheerest, tightest tights in all of
Spain, and his girlfriends: Mercedes (Olga Kriazheva), who dances
whenever anyone puts a line of tankards on the floor, and a nameless
tavern wench (Kadria Amirova) who throws backbends at Espada with
lascivious intent.</TE>
<TE>   Other stagings try to make subsidiary characters integral to a
neat, logical plot, but Chichinadze just lets them come and go as
components in a social panorama. The result may be a mess as dance
drama, but it sends the dancers a message: You are here to make an
effect--only that. Go for it.</TE>
<TE>   And they do, with Perkovsky, Shishkin and Domashev especially
spirited but absolutely everyone sustaining a party atmosphere
through nearly three hours. The 32 grandees in black and white who
ornament the final scene may be the ultimate statement of group
solidarity, but there are always dancers on the sidelines who deserve
a spotlight.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, every "Don Quixote" belongs to the spitfire Kitri and
her beloved, penniless Basil. In Natalia Ledovskaya, the company
boasts a Kitri with a fabulous jump, spectacular balances, fiery
attacks, delicate pointe-work and faultless precision, plus the
ability to remain a good sport when Georgy Smilevsky's precarious
one-armed lifts leave her teetering on the brink of catastrophe.</TE>
<TE>   Smilevsky's dancing has charm and impact, though the role's
technical fireworks sometimes overtax him and the partnering often
looks downright chancy. More reliable classicism comes from Natalia
Schelokova and, especially, Anastasia Pershenkova in the two Act 3
variations, Ioulia Sabirzianova as a pert, weightless Cupid and
Natalia Krapivina as a majestic if unnecessarily grave Queen of the
Dryads.</TE>
<TE>   Krapivina and Smilevsky had introduced local audiences to Moscow
Stanislavsky excellence on Tuesday in the first duet of artistic
director Dmitry Bryantsev's "The Spirit Ball," and all the dancing
swans and Spaniards since then haven't lessened the feeling that we
should give this company the chance to define itself through new
work--the kind of ballets that made and sustains its
reputation--rather than playing to our 19th century expectations.</TE>

<HD>Falcon Theatre Taps 'Cobb' to Lead Off Subscription Season</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Falcon Theatre in Burbank will produce its first subscription
season, which will include the Los Angeles premiere of Lee Blessing's
"Cobb," which played off-Broadway last year, and "Gretty Goodtime" by
John Belluso, whose "Body of Bourne" was seen at the Mark Taper Forum
last year. In addition, the theater has moved up the Actors' Equity
scale to a regular contract with the union, producer Garry Marshall
announced Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The season will include premieres of Ray Bradbury's latest
dramatization of his "Fahrenheit 451" (Oct. 26 through Nov. 17); "A
Christmas Carole King," in which the Troubadour Theatre Company will
intertwine Dickens' tale of Scrooge with Carole King songs (Dec. 7
through 29); and Mayo Simon's "The Old Lady in Love," starring
Charlotte Rae and directed by Alan Mandell (Feb. 8 through March 2).</LD>
<LD>   "Cobb" (Sept. 14 through Oct. 6), produced in association with
Kevin Spacey's Trigger Street Productions, revolves around the life
story of baseball legend Ty Cobb, with three actors playing the title
role at different ages. Belluso's "Gretty Goodtime" (April 12 through
May 4) is a play set in 1955 about a young German-born woman in a
nursing home, directed by Joe Regalbuto.</LD>
<TE>   The Falcon opened with 120 seats in 1997, but initially only 99
seats were used so that the theater could operate under Actors'
Equity's 99-Seat Theater Plan, which requires only token fees for
actors who are Equity members. In 1998, however, the theater's
children's programming began using an Equity contract, and within the
past year, two rental productions used Equity contracts. The
theater's capacity increased last year to 130.</TE>
<TE>   Equity and the Falcon reached agreement on a long-term contract
for the Falcon's adult productions earlier this year, and the
agreement was first used last month, for "The Sunshine Boys" and "A
Night in November."</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to cost more, but we have a better shot to maybe make
some more," Marshall said, especially if hit shows can be moved to
larger venues. "I'd rather gamble on me and my staff than the stock
market."</TE>

<LD>Boeing Co. and Siemens' U.S. unit won a government contract valued at
$508 million to install, maintain and train operators for
explosive-detection machines in U.S. airports.</LD>
<LD>   The team beat out Lockheed Martin Corp., Raytheon Co. and TRW Inc.
for the contract. Lockheed Martin received a $350-million contract to
carry out a plan to replace private security workers with government
employees at 429 airports.</LD>
<LD>   The award gives Boeing and Siemens responsibility for helping the
government fulfill a congressional mandate to begin screening all 1
billion bags checked on airplanes annually by the end of the year.
The contracts give Boeing, Siemens and Lockheed Martin footholds in
the U.S. homeland security business.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>GlaxoSmithKline is accused in a lawsuit of using threats to block
generic competition to its $2-billion-a-year antibiotic Augmentin
after a U.S. judge eliminated the drug's patent protection.</LD>
<LD>   An Alabama union health plan claims in a suit that Glaxo filed
improper patent applications to ward off generic competition through
2018 and then threatened rivals May 23 after the last of a series of
federal court rulings invalidating the patents.</LD>
<LD>   Executives with the British drug maker said that if they are
successful in appealing U.S. District Judge Henry Morgan's invalidity
rulings, they would seek damages for lost profit against any seller
of rival versions of the drug.</LD>
<TE>   GlaxoSmithKline did not have an immediate comment on the lawsuit,
filed in Norfolk, Va.</TE>

Little and Telmex cited "a substantial decline in the value of the
company" since they made their pledge to invest in November.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. consumers took on more debt in April than in any month since
November, another sign that consumers are willing to spend as long as
retailers offer discounts or no-interest financing.</LD>
<LD>   Non-mortgage debt outstanding rose by $8.9 billion in April after
a March increase of $6.8 billion, which was larger than previously
reported, the Federal Reserve said. A surge in credit card use and
growth in auto loans contributed to the April gain, which exceeded
the $7-billion rise analysts expected.</LD>
<LD>   Revolving debt, which includes credit cards, grew by $4.2 billion,
the biggest increase since November, after a $2.3-billion gain in
March. Nonrevolving credit, which includes auto loans and education
expenses, rose by $4.8 billion after a $4.4 billion gain in March,
the Fed said.</LD>

<LD>UST Inc.'s smokeless tobacco unit will suspend advertising in four
magazines as it studies claims it violated a 1998 legal settlement by
targeting children with its ads.</LD>
<LD>   United States Smokeless Tobacco, the world's biggest maker of
smokeless tobacco, or snuff, will stop advertising in Sports
Illustrated, Hot Rod, Motor Trend and Sporting News pending a review,
the company said. UST advertises in almost 50 publications.</LD>
<LD>   The Massachusetts Tobacco Control Program this week accused UST of
targeting teens by advertising in nine magazines. The company had
stopped placing ads in five of the publications, including Rolling
Stone. UST agreed not to market to teens as part of a 1998 settlement
with U.S. states that sued to recover health-care costs related to
tobacco users.</LD>

<LD>   In April, James Peter resigned as chief executive when federal

<HD>Adelphia Shares Fall on New Reports</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Cable firm may have kept two sets of accounting
books and inflated subscriber base.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN STEMPEL</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Adelphia Communications Corp.'s shares plummeted Friday and its bonds
fell as investors feared the cable TV operator lied about its
finances and subscriber growth, and may have fewer assets to parse
out in case of bankruptcy.</LD>
<LD>   "The one thing Wall Street hates more than uncertainty is
deception, and that's what we're talking about here," said Peter
Andersen, head of high-yield securities at Delaware Management Co. in
Philadelphia, which has sold its Adelphia bonds.</LD>
<LD>   The declines came after reports Friday that the cable TV operator
may have kept two sets of accounting books and inflated its
subscriber base by as much as 500,000, or about 10%. Adelphia
declined to comment Friday.</LD>
<TE>   If true, the revelations would show Adelphia's business is worth
less than investors thought, and that creditors would recover less if
a bankruptcy occurs.</TE>
<TE>   "The thinking had been their customer base is still high-quality
and intact," said Gary Farber, an analyst at Suntrust Robinson
Humphreys in New York. "If there are fewer customers there, that's a
very different scenario."</TE>
<TE>   Coudersport, Pa.-based Adelphia faces a Securities and Exchange
Commission accounting probe and two federal grand jury probes into
multibillion-dollar off-balance-sheet loans to its founding Rigas
family.</TE>
<TE>   The firm failed to file its 2001 annual report, has been delisted
from Nasdaq, has defaulted on bank-credit deals, missed $44.7 million
of interest and dividend payments and faces potential demands to
repay $1.4 billion of convertible debt immediately.</TE>
<TE>   It faces a June 15 deadline to pay the interest, which analysts
expect it to miss.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia also is seeking cash, trying to sell systems covering
about half of its reported 5.8 million subscribers.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia shares fell 36 cents to 30 cents in over-the-counter
trading Friday. They peaked at $87 in May 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said subscribers are key to valuing a cable TV operator,
which is why investors on Friday were alarmed.</TE>
<TE>   "If there are 400,000 or 500,000 subscribers fewer, that suggests
the value of Adelphia's assets are down between $1.2 billion and
$1.75 billion," said Lehmon Bros. analyst Bob Berzins.</TE>

<HD>JetBlue Heats Up Battle for Western Travelers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Coming this fall to the West: An aerial dogfight for travelers
wanting to pay cheap fares.</LD>
<LD>   Plans by the upstart, low-price carrier JetBlue Airways to begin
frequent service from Long Beach to Oakland in September and from
Long Beach to Las Vegas in October will ratchet up the already heated
competition for passengers in California and other Western states.</LD>
<LD>   On the crowded path from the Los Angeles Basin to the San
Francisco Bay Area, JetBlue will fly into the teeth of low-fare king
Southwest Airlines, which has 22 flights a day between Los Angeles
International Airport and Oakland alone, and giant United Airlines,
the UAL Corp. unit that counts Los Angeles and San Francisco as two
of its hubs.</LD>
<TE>   And on the Southern California-Las Vegas circuit, JetBlue will go
up against not only Southwest but another low-fare carrier, America
West, whose schedule includes eight daily flights from LAX to Las
Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   "This ought to be really interesting," said Ron Kuhlmann, vice
president of airline consulting firm Unisys R2A in Hayward, Calif.
Until now, Southwest and America West typically stood out as the
low-fare alternatives to the big network airlines, but with JetBlue's
push into their routes, "all of a sudden we have two or more guys
playing by the same rules in the same markets," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And consumers will reap the benefits because, with the heightened
competition, "the chances of upward pressure on fares in the L.A.
Basin-Bay Area market are zilch to none," Kuhlmann said. Most of the
competitors' fares between Southern California and Oakland and Las
Vegas already are under $100 one way, with some under $50.</TE>
<TE>   But while JetBlue's move is a boon for travelers, it also calls
into question whether the 2-year-old carrier--which recently got a
rousing reception on Wall Street for its initial stock sale--is
expanding too fast, a strategy that has doomed many other fledgling
airlines since the industry was deregulated in 1978.</TE>
<TE>   After going public at $27 a share, JetBlue's stock closed Friday
at $47.40 a share, up 82 cents, on Nasdaq. Wall Street now places a
total value on JetBlue of $1.9 billion--the same as UAL's United and
Northwest Airlines combined.</TE>
<TE>   Though profitable JetBlue has been successful, "competing
head-to-head with Southwest Airlines is a different challenge," said
Michael Allen, chief operating officer of Back Aviation Solutions, a
consulting firm in New Haven, Conn. "I don't think they intended on
doing this so early in their history."</TE>
<TE>   JetBlue's push into the West came sooner than expected, sparked by
a dispute at Long Beach Airport that has embroiled the New York-based
airline. Last year, when few other airlines were interested in Long
Beach, JetBlue secured the airport's 27 remaining slots even though
most weren't going to be used until 2003. (Long Beach's total slots
are limited to 41 for noise reasons.)</TE>
<TE>   But this year, American Airlines is demanding four more permanent
slots at Long Beach--especially since JetBlue wasn't yet using most
of its space--and American, a unit of AMR Corp., is threatening to
sue the airport if its request is rejected. Alaska Airlines also is
asking for three permanent slots at Long Beach for service to
Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Looking to protect its base, JetBlue last month moved up its plans
to start using its slots and announced it's now selling tickets for
nine daily flights to Oakland starting Sept. 6 and six daily flights
to Las Vegas starting Oct. 10.</TE>
<TE>   But JetBlue's rivals are waiting with their own ammunition.
Southwest and United, for instance, have more frequent service in the
West that appeals to business travelers, frequent-flier mileage
programs (which JetBlue doesn't yet have), strong brand loyalty and
the ability to connect passengers to flights nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   "We do have respect for them [JetBlue] as a competitor," said
Richard Sweet, Southwest's senior director of marketing and sales.
But in terms of responding with additional marketing or more flights,
Sweet said no. "We're quite comfortable at this point with what we
have out there and what we're doing."</TE>
<TE>   There's also the question of whether JetBlue's move--during a
slump in overall air travel--will create more airline seats than
there are passengers who want to fly those routes and, if so, whether
all the rival airlines can keep making money on their Western
service.</TE>
<TE>   But Kuhlmann, the consultant, said JetBlue chose "two of the
largest markets that exist"--California and Las Vegas--"where they
have a good chance of success and of best utilizing the aircraft they
have."</TE>
<TE>   The airline also dismisses concerns that it's growing too rapidly.
"We're not betting the farm" on the Long Beach expansion, said
JetBlue spokesman Gareth Edmondson-Jones, noting that the new flights
will represent only 5% of JetBlue's total capacity.</TE>
<TE>   JetBlue currently flies from New York to California and Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Edmondson-Jones said Southwest and other carriers--with flights
originating not only from LAX but also Burbank, Orange County and
Ontario--also have shown that Southern Californians prize the
convenience of a nearby airport when flying to the Bay Area or Las
Vegas. JetBlue's service from Long Beach plays to the same demand, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   But America West discounts JetBlue's threat and says it doesn't
plan a counterattack to protect its market share.</TE>
<TE>   "There's already a ton of capacity [airline seats] between
California and Las Vegas, and we just don't feel this will make a
difference in the market," said America West spokeswoman Patty
Nowack.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts suggest that United has the most to lose by
JetBlue's push in the West. United is struggling to regain
profitability and, like most big airlines, is trying to raise fares
to boost its revenue. But JetBlue's arrival could foil that effort,
at least in the intra-California market.</TE>
<TE>   Asked how the airline will deal with JetBlue, United spokesman
Chris Brathwaite replied: "We'll be competitive when it comes to
fares."</TE>

<HD>Andersen Deliberations Continue</HD>
<DH>Courts: Jurors rehear testimony from firm's former Enron
auditor about decision to plead guilty to obstruction.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Jurors in Arthur Andersen's obstruction-of-justice trial asked Friday
for a rerun of testimony by the firm's disgraced former Enron Corp.
auditor, but they failed to reach a verdict in their second full day
of deliberations.</LD>
<LD>   The jury, which is being sequestered at a hotel, is scheduled to
resume deliberations today.</LD>
<LD>   The panel spent about an hour in the jury box listening to a court
reporter read back portions of the testimony of former Andersen
partner David B. Duncan, in which the 43-year-old accountant answered
questions about his decision to plead guilty to an obstruction
charge.</LD>
<TE>   The reporter also read back testimony from FBI agent Raju Bhatia,
who testified that another partner in Andersen's Houston office,
Michael Odom, deleted an unusually large number of Enron-related
e-mails in early October, two days before he made a presentation to
office personnel in which he urged compliance with the firm's
document-retention policy.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say Andersen executives in October suddenly began
directing workers to comply with the policy, which calls for the
disposal of drafts and other papers unnecessary for the final audit
files, as a means of protecting the firm from regulators and investor
lawsuits that would arise from the meltdown of Enron.</TE>
<TE>   After a debate between prosecutors and defense lawyers about which
portions of Duncan's response should be repeated, U.S. District Judge
Melinda Harmon agreed to allow about 40 pages of the transcript to be
read back to the panel. As the court reporter read aloud, two jurors
took notes. The jury foreman, who is a college professor, swiveled in
his seat to hear better and appeared to be paying rapt attention.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the material focused on whether Duncan was pressured by
federal investigators to cut a plea-bargain deal. Andersen lead
attorney Rusty Hardin had told the jury that Duncan lacked criminal
intent and only agreed to plead guilty to avoid a lengthy prison
sentence.</TE>
<TE>   During Duncan's cross-examination, the accountant said he
initially believed he hadn't broken the law, but he decided to plead
guilty after a period of "soul-searching." Duncan said his attorneys
had told him of the possible additional sentence he could face if
prosecutors charged him with other crimes, such as fraud. But under
questioning from Assistant U.S. Atty. Andrew Weissmann, Duncan denied
he had been coerced by federal investigators.</TE>
<TE>   Outside of court Friday, Hardin declined to speculate about the
panel's discussions but said he was "delighted" because the 12 jurors
are "the first people that have looked at this case [and] not rushed
to judgment."</TE>

<HD>Hospital Operator Settles Lawsuit</HD>
<DH>Medicare: Catholic Healthcare West denies wrongdoing but
agrees to pay U.S. government $8.5 million after being accused of
false billings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON LEE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Catholic Healthcare West, California's largest not-for-profit
hospital operator, agreed to pay the federal government $8.5 million
to settle a whistle-blower lawsuit alleging fraudulent Medicare
billings, the Justice Department said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The government claimed that San Francisco-based Catholic
Healthcare West and 13 of its hospitals submitted false Medicare cost
reports, kept a separate book of disallowed charges and set aside
reserves in case Medicare money had to be repaid.</LD>
<LD>   In settling, Catholic Healthcare denied wrongdoing. Analysts said
the settlement amount was unlikely to have an effect on the finances
of the company, a 42-hospital chain with $4.8 billion in revenue in
fiscal year 2001. The company is in the middle of a reorganization to
reverse years of losses.</LD>
<TE>   Russell Hayman, an attorney for the hospital chain, said Friday
that the settlement amount was significantly less than what federal
officials originally sought. But he acknowledged that there were
cost-reporting mistakes made by Catholic Healthcare West employees,
which resulted in overpayments to the hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   He said, however, that errors also were made by Medicare officials
and that the government's audit over the last decade turned up cases
of underpayments, which Hayman said the hospital company will pursue.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Atty. John K. Vincent said in a statement that he was pleased
with the settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, the Justice Department has pursued numerous
whistle-blower lawsuits accusing hospital companies of cost-reporting
fraud.</TE>
<TE>   The allegations against Catholic Healthcare West arose in a
lawsuit brought in February 1999 by Joseph Kimball, a former
employee. The suit was filed under the False Claims Act, which allows
whistle-blowers to get as much 30% of the government's recovery.</TE>
<TE>   Kimball's attorney, Paul Scott, said his client will receive $2.48
million.</TE>
<TE>   For Catholic Healthcare West, the settlement is the latest in
several whistle-blower lawsuits that have cost the hospital company
more than $20 million over the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   In August, Catholic Healthcare West agreed to pay $10.7 million to
settle civil charges related to the use of investigational medical
devices.</TE>
<TE>   Mimi Park, a senior analyst at Moody's Investors Service who
tracks hospital finances, said Friday that Catholic Healthcare West
has made progress in its reorganization. But she said the company's
financial performance still remains weak.</TE>
<TE>   Moody's latest bond ratings for Catholic Healthcare West were in
the low end of investment grade, with a negative outlook for future
ratings.</TE>

<HD>J&amp;J's Procrit Anemia Drug Found to Be Diluted</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Johnson &amp; Johnson said some of its Procrit anemia treatment was found
diluted to greatly reduce the amount of active medicine in the
solution, the latest in a string of drug counterfeiting incidents
reported in the U.S. this year.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson &amp; Johnson sent a letter Thursday to health-care
professionals warning of one suspect lot number, P002641, and posted
it on the drug's Web site at www .procrit.com. The Food and Drug
Administration also posted the letter on the Internet to help warn
doctors and pharmacists about the counterfeiting.</LD>
<LD>   Amgen Inc., which licenses Procrit to J&amp;J, last month reported
finding counterfeit lots of its Epogen anemia drug that also had been
greatly diluted. The FDA is investigating the Procrit and Epogen
tamperings, said Carol Goodrich, a Johnson &amp; Johnson spokeswoman. The
Procrit problem was discovered in Texas.</LD>
<TE>   "We're working very closely with the FDA, Amgen, health officials
in Texas and all other parties that are investigating this," Goodrich
said.</TE>
<TE>   Other counterfeiting incidents reported this year include cases in
which bottles of Eli Lilly &amp; Co.'s Zyprexa schizophrenia drug were
switched for aspirin.</TE>

<HD>Internet Movie Site Is On, Then Off Again</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The third time definitely was not the charm for Film88.com, a
renegade online film site offering hit movies on demand for $1.</LD>
<LD>   Already shut down twice, the service reemerged for a few hours
Friday only to have its computers in Holland seized by
representatives of the major Hollywood studios. The seizure came at
the behest of a Dutch judge acting on a request from the Motion
Picture Assn., the studios' international trade group.</LD>
<LD>   The company, which previously operated as Movie88.com, has lost
more than 20 expensive computer servers to seizures. In February,
Movie88.com was knocked offline and its servers seized by Taiwanese
authorities, whose investigation is continuing.</LD>
<TE>   Film88.com enabled consumers to watch hundreds of hit movies and
classic TV programs online in near-VHS quality, charging $1 a
viewing. The video equivalent of an Internet jukebox, it was far
easier to use than other unauthorized outlets of downloadable movies
on the Net.</TE>
<TE>   The company didn't obtain the studios' permission to offer the
movies. Nor did it pay for them, although a spokesman said the
company planned to split its profit with the films' owners.</TE>
<TE>   After getting shut down in Taiwan, the company launched Film88.com
this week in Iran--mainly because Iran doesn't recognize foreign
copyrights. But it put its digital libraries of movies on computers
in Holland, using the Dutch Internet service provider TrueServer to
connect at high speed to the Net.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, TrueServer cut off Film88.com's Internet connection
after the Motion Picture Assn. complained that its members' films
were being pirated. The site went back up in a limited capacity
Friday, prompting the MPA to obtain a court order to seize
Film88.com's computers, said Mark Litvack, the association's director
of legal affairs and worldwide anti-piracy efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Film88 wasn't represented in the Dutch court, Litvack said.</TE>
<TE>   "TrueServer stepped back in and worked again with us to assist in
stopping the piracy," Litvack said. "They are a legitimate business
who have acted in an upright manner."</TE>
<TE>   Executives at Film88, who have defended their actions as providing
a new revenue stream for studios, could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The Web site pledged to be back in business in a few days after
"our new lines ... take place."</TE>
<TE>   Said Litvack, "This is a true pirate who has indicated that even
with criminal seizures and ISPs shutting him down, he will attempt to
continually violate the law. And violate our members' copyright. That
is not something we will idly stand by and watch occur, be that in
the Netherlands or elsewhere."</TE>

<HD>Panel Seeks Data on FDA's Refusal to Review Application by
ImClone</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANGELA ZIMM</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A House panel subpoenaed Food and Drug Administration employees,
seeking information about the agency's refusal to review a cancer
drug application from ImClone Systems Inc., whose shares have
plummeted.</LD>
<LD>   The subpoenas for a hearing next week are unusual because FDA
staff members usually don't testify on matters that may involve trade
secrets.</LD>
<LD>   Rep. James C. Greenwood (R-Pa.) said his oversight subcommittee is
trying to determine when the FDA, ImClone and its partner
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. realized that the Erbitux application didn't
contain enough data to win a review and whether investors should have
been notified sooner.</LD>
<TE>   The panel also wants to know whether Martha Stewart, a friend of
former Chief Executive Samuel Waksal's, and his family members used
inside information to sell ImClone shares before the FDA announced
its decision Dec. 28.</TE>
<TE>   "We are interested in learning as much as we can about anyone at
ImClone who may have exaggerated the promise of this drug," Greenwood
said. "We're looking to learn who sold stock as a result of inside
information."</TE>
<TE>   It's "pretty unusual" for the FDA to refuse to review a
drug-approval filing, said Ira Loss, an analyst for Washington
Analysis who has followed the FDA for 30 years. "It's less than 1% of
applications."</TE>
<TE>   Trading by insiders--including company officials and major
shareholders--is illegal when the buying or selling of shares is
based on information that isn't made public to all investors.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart, a former stockbroker who was elected this week to the New
York Stock Exchange board, is chief executive of Martha Stewart
Living OmniMedia and a longtime friend of Waksal. She sold all 3,000
of her shares, the New York Times reported, citing Susan Magrino, a
Stewart spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   "Martha Stewart did not receive any nonpublic information
regarding ImClone prior to her sale of a small number of ImClone
shares," Magrino said.</TE>
<TE>   Erbitux last year was the apparent leader in a race to develop a
new drug class designed to kill cancerous tumor cells with fewer side
effects. ImClone had predicted that the drug would win FDA approval
this year.</TE>
<TE>   ImClone shares closed as high as $73.83 in December, and at $58.30
the day before the FDA refused to consider the application for
Erbitux. The company's shares rose $1.05 to $8.45 on Nasdaq. The
shares have fallen 13% this week.</TE>
<TE>   Bristol-Myers' shares rose 88 cents to $27.08 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Japan Given Ray of Hope on Economy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>Japan received a rare dose of good news Friday with the announcement
that its economy grew by 1.4% in the first quarter, the first
expansion in a year.</LD>
<LD>   Any optimism could be short-lived, however, given the fundamental
weakness of most of the engine's underlying cylinders.</LD>
<LD>   "We may have bottomed out, but we're still not moving ahead," said
Koichi Ono, economist with Daiwa Institute of Research, part of Daiwa
Securities.</LD>
<TE>   Japan has the world's second-largest economy behind America's, so
any sustained growth would boost global prosperity and reduce
pressure on the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Even Japan's government, a notorious cheerleader in interpreting
economic data over the last gloomy decade, was careful not to talk up
the latest numbers too much.</TE>
<TE>   "The economic situation remains very severe," Yuzo Kobayashi, vice
minister for economic and fiscal policy in the Cabinet Office, told
reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Exports did most of the heavy lifting during the quarter, posting
a 6.4% increase. Companies such as Toyota, Sony and NEC saw their
prospects improve as U.S. and Asian consumers grew more optimistic,
opened their wallets and pushed up orders for Japanese electronics
and machinery.</TE>
<TE>   But the first growth in Japan's export sector in six quarters
could renew concerns that Japan once again is trying to export its
way back to prosperity without doing enough to streamline
regulations, encourage entrepreneurs or fix its many internal
problems.</TE>
<TE>   Nor are exports the panacea they once were. As Japan's economy has
opened further, it's moved more factories overseas and relied more on
imported components. The result: It no longer gets the boost from
outbound trade it once enjoyed.</TE>
<TE>   A second point of strength behind the January-March gross domestic
product figure--the sum of all goods and services produced
domestically--was consumer spending, which grew by 1.6% on the back
of expanded purchases of food, clothes and domestic travel.</TE>
<TE>   Personal spending accounts for nearly 60% of Japan's economy, and
progress in this area is essential for any sustained recovery.</TE>
<TE>   Once again, however, analysts took the news with a large grain of
sea salt. "We expected personal spending would be better than this,"
said Hiroshi Inagaki, senior economist at Fuji Research Institute.
"Furthermore, the figure overstates the real picture because of
statistical problems."</TE>
<TE>   Most consumer surveys here show little joy or confidence among a
Japanese population facing ongoing fears of job losses and deflation.</TE>
<TE>   Most Japanese who traveled during the first quarter also stayed
close to home because of Sept. 11-related fears, which tends to help
GDP. They're now returning to overseas destinations, however, as the
perceived risk diminishes.</TE>
<TE>   And on other fronts, although corporate profits have improved and
inventory declined, strategically important business investment fell
by 3.2% for its second straight quarterly decline.</TE>
<TE>   Japan's quarterly growth was 5.7% on an annualized basis compared
to 5.6% for the U.S. in its most recent period. That said, there's a
world of difference between the two economies.</TE>
<TE>   Japanese business leaders were quick to point out Friday that the
strong quarterly GDP figure doesn't match what they're seeing on the
ground or what most consumers are feeling. Nobuo Yamaguchi, chairman
of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, termed this disconnect
a "gulf."</TE>
<TE>   Japanese and foreign critics alike repeatedly have called on the
government to take all possible steps toward boosting domestic
demand, reforming the tax code and otherwise revitalizing the
economy.</TE>
<TE>   Few expect that the government can do much in the way of stimulus
spending, however, given its poor fiscal condition after a decade of
similar attempts.</TE>
<TE>   "We just can't expect that much," said Daiwa's Ono.</TE>
<TE>   Looking further ahead, economists say Japan's prospects for growth
will remain dependent for the foreseeable future on the U.S. economy
and currency moves.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks the yen has strengthened by about 8%, hurting
Japanese exporters. And the Japanese government is forecasting zero
growth for the current fiscal year, after a contraction of 1.3% for
the fiscal year ended March 2002--the economy's worst performance
since the government started keeping records in 1980.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Jobless Rate Falls to 5.8% in May</HD>
<DH>Economy: 41,000 jobs are gained. The data suggest the worst
of the layoffs may be over but don't herald a quick recovery.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER G. GOSSELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The nation's unemployment rate dipped to 5.8% in May and employers
added 41,000 jobs, the Labor Department said Friday, but almost no
one took the report as evidence the economy is recovering quickly.</LD>
<LD>   Government analysts accompanied the monthly figures with a
sweeping revision of past reports that indicates the department
missed about one in every five jobs lost since the March 2001 start
of the recession. In addition, more than half of the new hiring in
May was by temporary employment agencies--hardly a vote of confidence
that the country is coming back with all cylinders firing.</LD>
<LD>   "The bottom line is that we're in the early stages of a tepid
recovery," said Los Angeles economic consultant Donald H. Straszheim.</LD>
<TE>   The new statistics do suggest that the worst of the layoffs may be
over. The combination of May's net gain of 41,000 jobs with April's
revised gain of 6,000 and March's revised loss of 5,000 paints a
picture of a labor market that is bottoming out after sliding almost
two years.</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally disadvantaged groups were among the biggest winners.
Latino unemployment dropped almost a point to 7% in May as 86,000
workers of Hispanic origin found work. The African American jobless
rate dropped a full point to 10.2% as 123,000 black workers landed
positions.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the new numbers offered working people scant cause for
celebration. May's jobless rate was two-tenths of a point lower than
April's 6% level, but almost 2 percentage points higher than the
three-decade low of 3.9% achieved in October 2000. About 8.4 million
people were out of work last month, 2.8 million more than when the
job market began unraveling. One in every five had been jobless for
six months or more, double the number of a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   For those still working, the news was not much better. Average
hourly earnings increased only 3 cents to $14.70. Over the year,
earnings have risen only 3.2%, well short of the 4%-plus jumps during
the last few years of the expansion.</TE>
<TE>   The new jobs report gives no hint about whether the country will
be able to dodge the experience of the last recession, when
unemployment continued rising almost 2 1/2 years after the March 1991
end of the downturn and took nearly five years to regain the lows of
the previous expansion.</TE>
<TE>   "The good news in the new employment numbers is we've stopped
going down," said Paul A. McCulley, managing director of Newport
Beach-based Pacific Investment Management Co., which manages about
$260 billion in bonds. "But the bad news is we haven't started going
back up again," and it could be some time before that happens, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the mixed implications for working people, analysts said
the May employment report contained good news for investors, showing
jobs growing fast enough to dampen concerns about a "double-dip"
recession, but not quickly enough to spur demands for higher wages.</TE>
<TE>   And the report was not the only good news recently. Separately
Friday, the Commerce Department said inventories of U.S. wholesalers
dropped unexpectedly during April as sales grew at their fastest pace
in three years, a sure sign of recovery. Earlier in the week,
industry groups reported that business activity in both the
manufacturing and service sectors had risen at their fastest pace in
more than two years.</TE>
<TE>   But these latest signs were shrugged off by Wall Street, which
remains in a deep funk over accounting scandals, corporate busts and
worries that growth at any pace won't be enough to justify the
still-high prices of many stocks.</TE>
<TE>   The major stock indexes closed down Friday for the third week in a
row. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 34.97 points, or 0.4%, to
close at 9,589.67, its lowest level since Nov. 12. For the week, the
Dow lost 3.4% of its value. Other major indexes lost even more.</TE>
<TE>   Job growth during May was concentrated in services while hard-hit
manufacturing continued to lose positions, although at a slower pace.</TE>
<TE>   Temp agency hiring during the month raised to 126,000 the number
of workers that industry has added since February.</TE>
<TE>   The new jobs only partially offset the huge losses the industry
sustained in the preceding 18 months, when it shed more than 800,000
workers.</TE>
<TE>   Factories trimmed 19,000 in May, but that was a far cry from the
115,000 they slashed monthly between the March 2001 start of the
recession and January of this year.</TE>

<HD>Indexes' Early Plunge Ends in Slight Rebound</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Major stock indexes plunged from the opening bell Friday as investors
reacted to profit warnings from tech leader Intel and drug maker
Biogen, but a late-session rebound limited the damage.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts weren't overly impressed by the late-session bounce,
however. They attributed it to bargain hunting after three weeks of
mostly falling stock prices, rather than any fundamental shift in
investor confidence.</LD>
<LD>   "The reversal was encouraging ... but I'm not willing to ring the
bell and say the worst is over," said Bill Ryder, market strategist
at First Union Securities in Richmond, Va. "It's hard to get too
excited about the day's comeback."</LD>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average ended with a loss of 34.97
points, or 0.4%, at 9,589.67--its lowest close since Nov. 12. The Dow
fell as much as 152 points early in the day and then briefly showed a
gain. On Thursday, the average fell 172 points.</TE>
<TE>   Broader stock indicators also were lower, particularly the
tech-centered Nasdaq composite index, which ended down 19.40 points,
or 1.3%, at 1,535.48. Early on, Nasdaq was down almost 60 points. The
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index lost 1.62 points, or 0.2%, to close at
1,027.53.</TE>
<TE>   Trading was heavy, with the highest volume on the New York Stock
Exchange since Jan. 30. Winners led losers by 5 to 4 on the NYSE and
were about even on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Friday capped a week in which the indexes alternated between steep
losses and sharp gains.</TE>
<TE>   For the week, the Dow lost 3.4%, Nasdaq tumbled 5% and the S&amp;P
fell 3.7%. It was the third-straight losing week for all three
indexes.</TE>
<TE>   Nasdaq and the S&amp;P also are closing in on their post-Sept. 11
lows; Nasdaq has 112 points to go, the S&amp;P is within 61 points.</TE>
<TE>   The bad news from Intel and Biogen overshadowed the Labor
Department's report that the nation's unemployment rate fell to 5.8%
in May, its first decline in three months and a stronger showing than
economists had predicted.</TE>
<TE>   Intel fell $5, or 18.5%, to $22 after it dropped its
second-quarter sales forecast Thursday because of lower-than-expected
demand for personal computer processors in Europe. The news triggered
selling across the chip sector and pulled other tech stocks lower.</TE>
<TE>   Investors also pummeled Biogen, sending the pharmaceutical company
down $5.54, or 11.6%, to $42.16, after Biogen reduced its financial
estimates for the second quarter and full year, citing difficult
market conditions.</TE>
<TE>   Among gainers, Boeing rose 80 cents to $42.76, while J.C. Penney
advanced 73 cents to $23.33. General Electric gained 90 cents to
$30.20.</TE>
<TE>   But investors didn't blindly buy blue chips. American Express fell
$1.20 to $39.16 on broader worries that a weak recovery would hurt
the financial sector.</TE>
<TE>   Beating the downward trend, battered and cash-strapped telecom
company Nortel Networks rose 23 cents, or 16.3%, to $1.64 even as it
announced a new $1.3-billion stock sale that will add between 1.05
billion and 1.14 billion shares to an existing 3.2 billion
outstanding.</TE>
<TE>   Although the unemployment report did little for stocks, it did
push bond yields higher as investors bet on an economic rebound. The
yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 5.07% from 4.98%
on Thursday--its biggest one-day jump in a month.</TE>
<TE>   The dollar ticked up against the euro and the Japanese yen.</TE>
<TE>   European markets, which closed while U.S. indexes were still near
their lows, were broadly lower.</TE>

<HD>Trizec Buys Full Stake in Ernst &amp; Young Plaza</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Expanding its Los Angeles-area holdings, Trizec Properties Inc., the
nation's second-largest owner of office space, said Friday that it
had bought out its joint venture partner in the 41-story Ernst &amp;
Young Plaza in downtown Los Angeles for $112.4 million.</LD>
<LD>   New York-based Trizec bought the 75% of the complex it did not own
from one of Goldman Sachs Group's Whitehall Street real estate funds.
The deal values the property at Figueroa and 7th streets at about
$149 million.</LD>
<LD>   Ernst &amp; Young Plaza includes a 914,000-square-foot office building
that is about 90% occupied and a multilevel, 330,000-square-foot
shopping mall that is about 70% occupied, said Trizec spokesman Rick
Matthews.</LD>
<TE>   It was the first transaction since Trizec, formerly Toronto-based
TrizecHahn Corp., became a publicly traded U.S. real estate
investment trust last month.</TE>
<TE>   "Our portfolio strategy calls for continued investment in our
primary markets, while reducing ownership in secondary markets," said
Michael Escalante, senior vice president of capital allocations and
business development for Trizec. "Los Angeles is one of our key
markets, and we are pleased to have added to our presence downtown."</TE>
<TE>   Trizec spent much of the last two years selling assets that are
not related to its main business of owning U.S. office buildings.
Nationwide, Trizec owns or manages nearly 50 million square feet of
space. In the Los Angeles area, Trizec's portfolio totals nearly 3
million square feet, with properties in downtown Los Angeles, Long
Beach and other locations.</TE>

<HD>SEC Requests 'Wash' Trade Data From 3 Energy Firms</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Duke Energy Corp., El Paso Corp. and Williams Cos. got informal
requests from the Securities and Exchange Commission for data on
so-called wash, or "round-trip," energy trades as regulators widened
their probe into sham transactions in the $600-billion market for
power and natural gas.</LD>
<LD>   El Paso, the biggest U.S. gas-pipeline company, received the
request Friday afternoon, the company said. Duke, the No. 2 U.S.
utility company, and Williams, the second-largest gas-pipeline
company, said they were contacted last week.</LD>
<LD>   Wash, or "round-trip" transactions are those in which energy is
bought and sold at the same price.</LD>
<TE>   The shares of Williams, El Paso and rivals have tumbled amid
investigations into energy-trading practices and accounting after the
bankruptcy filing of Enron Corp., which inflated revenue and hid
debt. California officials have accused traders of sending prices
soaring during the state's power crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Williams had its credit rating cut one notch Friday to Baa3, the
lowest investment grade, by Moody's Investors Service. The downgrade
on $13 billion of debt reflects "weak cash flow relative to Williams'
debt and business risks and low asset returns," Moody's said.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Williams fell 23 cents to $8.70. The rating cut was
announced after the close of regular trading. Duke fell 68 cents to
$30.</TE>
<TE>   Houston-based El Paso fell 94 cents to $22.30. The firm announced
the SEC request after the close of regular trading. All trade on the
New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Williams shares plunged Wednesday after FERC threatened to ban the
firm from setting prices on spot power and gas sales. The company
failed to cooperate in a probe of allegations that traders
manipulated prices during California's energy crisis in 2000 and
2001, the commission said.</TE>
<TE>   "We really want to open our records and make people understand we
stand by our word, and our word is that we didn't do it," Williams
spokeswoman Paula Hall-Collins said.</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte-based Duke included about $1 billion of energy trades in
its financial statements over three years that had no economic
benefit and were similar to those used by rivals, the firm said last
month.</TE>

<HD>Tyco Shares Plunge Over CIT Deal, Widening Investigation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tyco International Ltd.'s shares plunged 31% on Friday as the
conglomerate's problems worsened with a report of a widening criminal
probe into whether executives used the company's cash to buy art and
homes, and a possible delay of a crucial sale or stock offering of
its CIT Group finance arm.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of Tyco fell $4.50 to $10.10 on the New York Stock
Exchange, their lowest level in nearly six years. The drop
accelerated a precipitous decline that has erased nearly $100 billion
in shareholder money since the beginning of the year--more than was
lost in the collapse of energy giant Enron Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Also Friday, Moody's Investors Service and Standard &amp; Poor's cut
their rating in Tyco's debt to one notch above "junk," triggering a
clause in its financing agreements that requires repayment of at
least $530 million in debt.</LD>
<TE>   S&amp;P, which also downgraded CIT Group, said Tyco had about $4
billion of cash March 31-- enough to refinance debt that would come
due immediately if Moody's or S&amp;P cut Tyco to junk.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco, reeling from the indictment and resignation of Chief
Executive L. Dennis Kozlowski, carries $23 billion in debt and is
scrambling to sell CIT to pay $3.25 billion due early next year.</TE>
<TE>   "Things can definitely worsen from here, and I think they will
worsen because they have real balance-sheet issues and they have zero
credibility," said Rob Plaza, an analyst at fund research firm
Morningstar.</TE>
<TE>   The company has failed to find a buyer for CIT even at "fire sale"
prices. Tyco bought CIT last year for $10 billion and is expected to
recoup only about half that amount. Last month, it failed to clinch a
deal to sell CIT to investment bank Lehman Bros. for $5 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Kozlowski's indictment on tax evasion charges has led to a broader
inquiry into whether the company used its money to buy homes and
artwork for executives without telling shareholders, the Wall Street
Journal reported.</TE>
<TE>   "If the CEO would take those kind of risks in his personal life,
then you could make the assumption that he was acting that way at the
company," Plaza said.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco said it was committed to completing an initial public
offering of CIT "as expeditiously as possible." But it did not follow
its recent custom of forecasting that the CIT float would occur by
the end of June.</TE>
<TE>   The Securities and Exchange Commission, which was expected to sign
off on the CIT share offering as early as Thursday, probably won't
approve it this week, sources told Reuters.</TE>

<HD>Merrill to Simplify Stock Ratings, Revamp Analysts' Pay</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., scrambling to repair its image with investors,
said Friday that it will simplify its stock ratings and overhaul the
way it pays analysts.</LD>
<LD>   The big securities firm will introduce a three-tiered rating
system--labeling stocks either "buy," "neutral" or "sell"--to make
the recommendations more understandable to small investors.</LD>
<LD>   The firm also said it will base analysts' pay on stock-picking
ability rather than investment-banking work. That change was required
as part of a recent $100-million legal settlement with the New York
attorney general, who had accused Merrill analysts of giving tainted
advice to investors.</LD>
<TE>   Merrill's announcement is the latest attempt at reform by
securities firms, which are frantically trying to regain investor
confidence amid a furor over Wall Street's alleged ethical lapses.</TE>
<TE>   Securities firms have been hit hard by allegations that analysts
mislead investors with rosy recommendations aimed at winning
lucrative investment-banking business for their firms.</TE>
<TE>   Securities firms clearly are worried about the bottom line. The
Wall Street Journal reported Friday that two big public pension funds
are considering pulling business from companies that do not implement
analyst reforms.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street sought to reassure investors this week.</TE>
<TE>   The New York Stock Exchange proposed sweeping changes Thursday to
boost the integrity of corporate boards. The Nasdaq Stock Market
advanced its own plan and promised a tougher one next month. On
Wednesday, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. called for
significant changes in the way firms are run.</TE>
<TE>   In March, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &amp; Co. introduced a simplified
stock-rating system, and other Wall Street firms may announce similar
reforms. Goldman Sachs said it is developing a new stock-rating
system. Salomon Smith Barney, a unit of Citigroup Inc., is "looking
at everything regarding our policies and practices," a spokeswoman
said.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say Wall Street firms are rushing to portray themselves as
reformed, said John Coffee, a securities law expert at Columbia
University.</TE>
<TE>   "A big change by Merrill Lynch requires big changes by all its
competitors or they will lose market share," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As for the changes announced by Merrill, "I don't think they're
revolutionary, but they're helpful," Coffee said.</TE>
<TE>   In its settlement with New York's attorney general, Eliot Spitzer,
Merrill agreed last month to make major changes in its compensation
and oversight of analysts, primarily by taking steps to separate its
stock-research and investment-banking units.</TE>
<TE>   The deal calls for analysts to no longer be evaluated and paid
based on their role in securing investment-banking work. To that end,
Merrill said Friday that analysts will be judged on such factors as
the accuracy of their stock ratings and earnings estimates.</TE>
<TE>   The simplified stock ratings will be unveiled in September. The
three ratings will replace a four-tier system, which took the place
of a five-tier system in December.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill's ratings previously have relied heavily on numbers and
letters. For example, a "D-3-1-7" rating meant a stock was highly
volatile, rated neutral for its 12-month prospects and a strong buy
over three to five years, and had a secure dividend.</TE>
<TE>   Historically, Wall Street analysts have slapped "sell" ratings on
fewer than 1% of all stocks they cover. That number hit a new high
recently, but at the current 2.7% still is a fraction of the 61.9% of
stocks rated as "buys," according to Thomson Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Robert McCann, Merrill's head of global securities research, said
his firm would issue "sell" ratings when warranted.</TE>
<TE>   "Analysts everywhere are casting a more discerning eye on the
companies they cover, and it wouldn't surprise me at all that we will
see more 'sell' recommendations," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan Stanley introduced a three-tiered system in March--labeling
stocks "overweight," "equal weight" or "underweight." About 22% of
all stocks rated by Morgan Stanley are in the lowest group.</TE>
<TE>   Though companies historically have retaliated against analysts who
give low ratings--such as by cutting off access to top
executives--that has not happened, said Dennis Shea, Morgan's head of
global equity research.</TE>
<TE>   "Truthfully, we were a bit surprised," he said.</TE>

<HD>Chip Stocks Plunge on Intel's Lowered Revenue Expectations</HD>
<DH>Tech: The drop reflects concerns about the industry and
technology spending cycle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investors worried that technology spending won't rebound soon slashed
almost 19% from Intel Corp.'s market value Friday after the world's
biggest microprocessor manufacturer cut sales forecasts.</LD>
<LD>   Intel stock plunged from $27 to $22, its lowest level since
October, wiping out $33 billion in market capitalization. Shares of
other chip makers, including Advanced Micro Devices Inc., and
providers of equipment used to manufacture chips also fell.</LD>
<LD>   The sell-off followed Intel's warning after the markets closed
Thursday that sales for the second quarter would come in between $6.2
billion and $6.5 billion, setting a midpoint below the Santa Clara,
Calif., company's previous projection of $6.4 billion to $7 billion.</LD>
<TE>   Intel also cut its expectations for gross profit margin from 53%
to 49% as its more lucrative chips lose ground to less expensive
ones.</TE>
<TE>   Coming just two months after Intel forecast widening profit
margins, the warnings were "out of left field" and spooked investors,
said Morgan Stanley analyst Mark Edelstone.</TE>
<TE>   The majority of the problems have more to do with Intel than with
the semiconductor industry as a whole, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   More than competitors such as Texas Instruments Inc. and National
Semiconductor Corp., Intel depends on the fortunes of the personal
computer industry, in which four out of five machines use Intel
chips.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an issue relating to desktop PCs, and Intel simply ended
up with a weaker product mix, causing average selling prices to be
lower," Edelstone said.</TE>
<TE>   Unsold personal computers cluttered store shelves in April, when
sales dropped 22%, and the backlog hurt Hewlett-Packard Co. and other
computer firms.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, companies have been working off that inventory rather
than buying chips to make new machines</TE>
<TE>   "We continue to believe that the three-year PC replacement cycle
is stretching back out to a four-year PC replacement cycle, which
looks like it can only begin in 2003," Lehman Bros. analyst Dan Niles
said.</TE>
<TE>   In another ominous sign, Intel officials said they saw little of
the typical June increase in demand as computer firms begin building
machines for the August and September back-to-school selling season.</TE>
<TE>   The severity of Intel's stock drop reflects both investor concerns
about the chip industry and the technology spending cycle as a whole.
This week, an industry group cut its overall sales growth estimate
for chips for the year in half to 3%.</TE>
<TE>   And while unemployment figures and other economic indicators have
been improving, analysts said most big companies are still reining in
spending on new equipment.</TE>
<TE>   "Our belief is that spending recovery in the second half is highly
unlikely," said U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray semiconductor analyst
Ashok Kumar. "Recovery from recession is a multiyear process."</TE>
<TE>   Chip stocks swing more wildly than those in most industries
because investors are trying to gauge an uncertain future and the
cycles are deeper.</TE>
<TE>   As PC sales dropped by as much as 25% a quarter from their peak in
2000, chip sales fell by as much as 45% and semiconductor equipment
sales slumped as much as 65%, said Banc of America Securities analyst
Doug Lee.</TE>
<TE>   For more than a decade, the conventional wisdom has been to buy
shares in semiconductor firms when computer sales are the lowest in a
cycle. After that point, the demand for chips can only go up,
bringing increased sales and profit.</TE>
<TE>   In the chip-stock downturn of 1996, that worked almost too easily.
Demand for chips was higher at the end of the downturn than it had
been at the beginning.</TE>
<TE>   But this time, there are no clear signs of a PC rebound that
everyone had long considered a certainty.</TE>
<TE>   "People have learned how to [buy shares] at the wrong time," Lee
said. "You look at this cycle, and the level of demand is lower than
when we went into the downturn. Investors haven't learned that yet."</TE>
<TE>   They may have more learning ahead of them. Chip shares are trading
at 30 times their expected earnings next year, while the Standard &amp;
Poor's index as a whole is trading at about 20 times earnings.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just bouncing off a very low bottom," Lee said. "For the
last 12 months or so, chip companies have not been getting orders,
causing the inventory to be burned off. But that doesn't make it
sustainable."</TE>

<HD>Warner Center Towers Deal Struck</HD>
<DH>Real estate: Douglas Emmett will pay nearly $340 million
for the signature glass-skinned buildings, sources say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRAD BERTON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Douglas Emmett Realty Advisors has agreed to buy the Warner Center
commercial district's signature glass-skinned office towers from
their institutional owners for nearly $340 million, real estate
sources said, making the Santa Monica-based investment manager the
largest owner of premium office space in the San Fernando Valley.</LD>
<LD>   The five-tower complex along Oxnard Street in Woodland Hills was
developed between the mid-1970s and early 1990s by Warner Center
pioneer Robert Voit and his partners. Warner Center is the western
San Fernando Valley's primary commercial hub and might be the
financial heart of the nation's sixth-largest city if the Valley
secedes from Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Alaska Permanent Fund Corp. and Harvard University's endowment
fund have owned the high-rises as well as the adjacent Warner Center
Business Park "low-rise" complex since the mid-1990s. Agents are said
to be negotiating a separate transaction for the business park with
another Southern California-based buyer.</LD>
<TE>   Douglas Emmett assembled a portfolio of office buildings on the
Westside starting in the early 1990s, then targeted prime buildings
along the Valley's Ventura Boulevard corridor in recent years. The
firm also has quietly accumulated a substantial portfolio of
high-rent apartment towers in and around Brentwood and in Santa
Monica.</TE>
<TE>   Early this year, Douglas Emmett completed its transformation of
the iconic Sherman Oaks Galleria from a prototypical indoor mall into
a combination shopping, entertainment and office complex.</TE>
<TE>   The price Douglas Emmett is expected to pay for the Warner Center
high-rises, which include nearly 1.9 million square feet of offices,
factors to about $180 a square foot, which is less than it would cost
to duplicate the development today, real estate observers said.</TE>
<TE>   The high-rises have been more than 20% vacant since the departure
of HealthNet Inc., said Bill Inglis, the office portfolio's director
of leasing. However, AIG Sun- America just agreed to expand its
offices in the 25-story Warner Center Plaza III tower from 96,000
square feet to about 156,000 square feet through a $50-million lease
renewal and expansion.</TE>
<TE>   Douglas Emmett declined to comment on the pending transaction. A
representative of Boston-based AEW Capital Management, which oversees
the Warner Center portfolio for the sellers, said the firm would not
discuss the deal until it closes. That's likely to happen in August,
according to sources familiar with the sale's terms.</TE>
<TE>   The pending transaction represents "the continued affirmation that
institutional capital flocks to quality real estate in key
sub-markets," said Jeremy Fletcher, regional chief executive of
Beacon Capital Partners, which recently bought the nearby Trillium
office complex for $134 million.</TE>
<TE>   The West Valley's overall vacancy rate, including space available
for sublease, was just under 15%, according to real estate brokerage
Colliers Seeley. As is the case elsewhere in the region, office rents
in the West Valley have fallen back from the peaks reached a year or
two ago. Rental rates are unlikely to rebound until an improved
economy boosts tenant demand, Colliers Seeley said.</TE>

<LD>A weapons stash and a pound of marijuana have led to time behind bars
for two members of the Mongols motorcycle gang.</LD>
<LD>   Lonnie Hagan Gallegos, 45, purported secretary-treasurer of the
gang's El Sereno chapter, was sentenced Thursday to three years and
four months in prison for possessing illegal weapons.</LD>
<LD>   His son-in-law, Jerry Manuel Ramirez, 22, was given six months in
jail for possession of brass knuckles.</LD>
<TE>   Superior Court Judge C. Edward Simpson scoffed at arguments by
attorney Charles T. Mathews that Gallegos was a weapons collector who
happened to be on probation for carrying a concealed gun.</TE>
<TE>   A dozen guns, including two illegal assault weapons, were found
during a May 2000 raid on Gallegos' home in Alhambra by federal
agents and sheriff's deputies. Police also found thousands of rounds
of ammunition, a silencer and a bulletproof vest.</TE>

<DH>Courts: Five of the Chinese men who landed on a local beach
last month will testify against ship's captain and engineer.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Five of 10 Chinese men who waded ashore in Orange County last month
will testify against the ship's captain and engineer, who have been
charged with smuggling.</LD>
<LD>   The other five face deportation hearings in the coming weeks,
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The 10 men paddled ashore north of Laguna Beach, naked and
clinging to makeshift floats. They said they paid $10,000 each to be
smuggled from China through Taiwan and into the United States.</LD>
<TE>   But the captain and the engineer told a different story.</TE>
<TE>   Captain Jin Yinn Wang said in court last month that he never
intended to steer near California. He said he and his first mate were
fishing for shark 600 miles off Hawaii when they picked up the 10 men
as crew members. Where they came from was not made clear.</TE>
<TE>   Wang said the new crew members hijacked his boat, the Fu Ching.
When the boat arrived off Laguna Beach, Wang said, he was bound and
locked in a storage room. He told investigators that the men stole a
ring, equipment and cash before jumping overboard.</TE>
<TE>   Wang said he freed himself and tried to call for help. U.S. Coast
Guard officials said they were not aware of any mayday calls.
Authorities said they doubt Wang's story.</TE>
<TE>   The would-be immigrants who came ashore told investigators they
were forbidden to move without permission from the captain, who
demanded they call him "boss."</TE>

<DH>Wildfire: Copper Hill blaze burns 25,000 acres and spreads
northeast despite cooling trend. At least nine homes have been
destroyed.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Temperatures dropped but winds increased Friday as firefighters
continued to battle massive mountain brush fires in Los Angeles and
Ventura counties, retreating before flames in the Angeles National
Forest that forced the evacuation of the mountain community of Green
Valley.</LD>
<LD>   The wildfire in Los Angeles County was only 15% contained by
nightfall Friday, after charring more than 25,000 acres of brush and
timber and destroying at least nine homes.</LD>
<LD>   The blaze was burning in a northeasterly direction from a
construction site on Copper Hill Road in San Francisquito Canyon,
where a spark from welding equipment apparently touched off the
flames Wednesday afternoon.</LD>
<TE>   The outlook was a little better in Ventura County, where the more
than 1,100 firefighters manning the lines around a 20,800-acre blaze
near Ojai got their first good news since the fire started a week
ago.</TE>
<TE>   An onshore flow of moist marine air slowed the advance of flames
in most areas, and officials said the fire was 25% contained by
sunset.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the continued spread of the Copper Hill fire, no serious
injuries were reported and no homes or structures were lost Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Los Angeles County Fire Chief John Alkema expressed
cautious optimism Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't killed this fire yet, but we've slowed it down," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   But residents braced for the worst as flames continued to chew up
dense brush near and around Green Valley, Warm Springs and other
small mountain communities south of the Antelope Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Temperatures climbed into the upper 80s and winds gusted to 25 mph
as a squadron of helicopters and planes dumped water and fire
retardant.</TE>
<TE>   Below, more than 2,000 firefighters manned lines for 20 miles
around the blaze in an effort to save the 400 homes in the Green
Valley area.</TE>
<TE>   More than 1,100 residents have evacuated from Green Valley since
Thursday, scrambling to retrieve mementos, valuables, pets and
livestock before escaping.</TE>
<TE>   Also fleeing the valley were inmates and staff members from county
juvenile probation facilities in Lake Hughes.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said parents or guardians of those juveniles can call
(661) 940-4122 for information on their whereabouts.</TE>
<TE>   One resident, John Koch, 48, sent his family away in a motor home
Thursday before flames burned within 100 feet of his house Friday
afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   "The sound was the scary thing," said Koch, a resident of Green
Valley, who spent a sleepless night on the couch. "There was this
rush and heat, and it sounded like a waterfall coming at you."</TE>
<TE>   Suzanne Anaya, 52, found that the fire's heat peeled paint from
the porch of her two-story home off San Francisquito Canyon Road.</TE>
<TE>   Anaya was especially concerned about her dogs and spent 20 hours
walking the blackened canyons with a dog whistle to track down one
that ran away.</TE>
<TE>   "We really didn't care about our home," she said, "we just wanted
to save the dogs."</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department urged residents in
Lake Hughes, Lake Elizabeth, Leona Valley and Three Points to
evacuate livestock and pets immediately.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to slow the fire, which was advancing at a rate of
four to five miles a day, firefighters set backfires along Spunky
Canyon Road and massed fire crews around a cluster of homes at the
north end of San Francisquito Canyon Road.</TE>
<TE>   Other crews sprayed foam on vulnerable structures, cut down trees
and dismantled wood piles to remove potential fuel for the fire.</TE>
<TE>   The change in weather was a mixed blessing.</TE>
<TE>   Temperatures dropped at least 10 degrees in the fire area Friday,
but the cooling came from onshore breezes that fanned the advancing
flames.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Fire Department spokesman Andy Menshek said the
fire was contained between San Francisquito and Bouquet canyons, but
homes farther north were still threatened.</TE>
<TE>   "There's an obvious sense of danger and all fire crews are tense
because of the unpredictability of the winds," Menshek said.</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura County, dome tents dotted the makeshift encampment set
up for fire crews at Soule Park in Ojai.</TE>
<TE>   Weary firefighters slept under shade trees, the tops of their
heads poking from sleeping bags tossed on the grass.</TE>
<TE>   Others played cards, chatted or read as they waited for their next
stint on the front lines of the so-called Wolf fire.</TE>
<TE>   Squatting under a tree, U.S. Forest Service firefighter Jack
McKenzie sharpened the tool he used to cut fire breaks through the
deep brush of the Sespe Wilderness. His face stained with soot,
McKenzie had just come from Pine Mountain Ridge, where his 20-member
crew from the Tahoe National Forest worked to keep the fire from
spreading south of the ridge.</TE>
<TE>   With breezes and dry brush that could keep the fire burning for
days, the firefighters are settling in for the long haul, said
California Department of Forestry information officer David Drum from
Tulare.</TE>
<TE>   The camp at Soule has elements of a war camp, Drum said. While the
exhausted firefighters rest, tactical support teams plan attack and
defense strategies, studying maps and discussing moves with team
leaders on the fire lines.</TE>
<TE>   Help has come from Ventura, Orange, Santa Barbara, Los Angeles and
Kern counties, as well as the cities of Montecito, San Luis Obispo,
Santa Maria, La Verne and Rancho Cucamonga. Crews have also come from
Montana.</TE>
<TE>   Shane Tosse, a firefighter with the Modoc Interagency Hotshot
Crew, came down off the mountain Thursday night after a 36-hour shift
on the Wolf fire.</TE>
<TE>   "With the way this fire's burning and how dry it is this season,
we're looking at a rough year," said Tosse, who operates a chain saw
with an elite team of firefighters specially trained to battle blazes
in Western back country.</TE>
<TE>   Many firefighters are being airlifted into the fire because of the
rugged terrain.</TE>
<TE>   Others face two- to three-mile treks to the fire lines.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the time it takes to get there, many firefighters are
putting in 30-hour shifts or longer, Drum said. And he said that
after only a few hours of rest at camp, they head out to do battle
again.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Jones and his five-member crew were preparing to pull out
after five days on the front lines. "We'll sleep tonight and get
ready for the next one," said Jones.</TE>
<TE>   Forecasters said temperatures in the burn areas shouldn't climb
past the 80s through the weekend, but they said a large trough of low
pressure over the Great Basin area could generate some strong, gusty
winds in the mountains today and Sunday that could push flames into
previously unburned areas and speed the spread of the fires in heavy
brush.</TE>

<HD>Laguna Beach Unified Pushes P.E. Into New Age of Lifelong
Fitness</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lying on the floor face up, staff and faculty from the Laguna Beach
Unified School District concentrated on getting it right.</LD>
<LD>   "Think of yourself as a ball or a rocking chair," said Jordi Mas,
fitness guru, instructing them in an exercise called
roll-like-a-ball. "This is a movement that lengthens while you
strengthen."</LD>
<LD>   Next was the pelvic lift, in which hips are slowly angled up.
"Think of your spine as a string of pearls," Mas said. "Only one
pearl can lift at a time."</LD>
<TE>   Say goodbye to your parents' gym class and meet the future of
physical education: lifelong fitness. "It's about reorganizing the
brain and the nervous system to function more effectively," Mas said.</TE>
<TE>   As national studies show fitness falling and obesity rising among
youths, school districts across California are trying alternatives to
the old standards of softball, volleyball and calisthenics. In San
Francisco, teachers study yoga so they can apply its principles,
which they say improve students' concentration. Some L.A. Unified
schools offer juggling, Frisbee golf and wall climbing.</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Beach's program, which started in January, aims to augment,
not replace, conventional gym-class activities. Instead of jumping
jacks, a P.E. class might do breathing exercises. The curriculum is
still being developed.</TE>
<TE>   The idea met some initial resistance. Victoria Stalker, whose four
young children are in the district's schools, says she practices yoga
but doesn't think it ought to be taught in the classroom.</TE>
<TE>   "I just don't see how it will help my kids at this level," she
said. "If the day were longer, I'd have no problem with them doing
some breathing and stretching. But the schools should be doing math
and English first before adding this extra stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Others objected because fitness guru Mas, 31, is the son of school
board member Susan Mas.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sort of a 'made' job," said Rosemary Walli, who has two
children in elementary school. "We would do a lot better if the kids
just got more schooling. I think they learn lots more from team
sports than from these individual things."</TE>
<TE>   School officials say the program grew from a push four years ago
to set priorities.</TE>
<TE>   "Things were in total disarray," said Kathryn A. Turner, a school
board member. "Orange County had gone bankrupt, and we were almost
bankrupt." The district had seven superintendents in the seven years
from 1991 to 1998, she said. "We were desperate, without a rudder."</TE>
<TE>   When Theresa A. Daem took the helm of the 2,600-student district
in 1998, one of her first actions was to set up a mission task force.
Though the district ranks No. 1 in Orange County in annual spending
per student--$7,411 for 2000-01--a survey by the California
Department of Education that year found that its students had a high
incidence of drug and alcohol abuse, Daem said. Although children
were doing well academically, a survey of students found that they
felt a lack of emotional support from their schools and community and
wanted more opportunities for meaningful participation.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a strange thing for us to encounter here," Daem said.
"Laguna Beach is a small community with a strong sense of social
responsibility. Hearing that our kids didn't feel supported was a
major surprise."</TE>
<TE>   The task force recommended rewriting the curriculum to include
activities that would encourage social and emotional well-being. That
meant a make-over for physical education.</TE>
<TE>   The state requires schools to offer P.E. but lets districts decide
exactly what to teach and how. Daem insists that lifelong fitness
will not phase out team sports, nor will it decrease time devoted to
academics.</TE>
<TE>   Regarding the district's hiring of Mas, she said, "It was totally
on merit." His mother "had no part of it, and she has no financial
gain. He's done an outstanding job. The only gain is for the
district's students and staff."</TE>
<TE>   Under Jordi Mas' contract as a staff development consultant, he
teaches 90-minute classes every other week. The sessions, held after
hours in a P.E. room at Thurston Middle School, are free for faculty
and staff. Attendance is not mandatory. Mas is paid $60 an hour.</TE>
<TE>   Mas said he is a certified personal trainer who specializes in
techniques like Pilates, a gentle muscle-toning discipline that
emphasizes posture. His classes also incorporate aspects of yoga.</TE>
<TE>   Only 10% of Mas's students so far have been physical education
instructors. The goal is to eventually incorporate the techniques
into academic classes as well, Daem said. "I want to create a culture
around it, not just for 20 minutes a day."</TE>
<TE>   If some parents are skeptical, teachers are enthusiastic.</TE>
<TE>   "This is great," second-grade teacher Sandi Booth said as she
finished a session with Mas this week. "It's made me more aware of my
posture and how I walk."</TE>
<TE>   Teacher Sandy Gravely said she was eager to employ Mas' techniques
in her lifelong fitness classes at Top of the World Elementary
School. "A lot of the time, P.E. is just taking them out to play
kickball. Kickball is fun, but it won't benefit them as adults," she
said. "This is something they can do all their lives."</TE>
<TE>   Gravely said she has hit only one snag, and she plans to spend
part of this weekend fixing it: "I'm going to draft a letter to the
district asking for more floor mats."</TE>

<HD>Insurance Fund Is Told to Shape Up</HD>
<DH>Risks: Commissioner warns that state's workers' comp
provider needs to beef up reserves, raise rates. Managers defend
their efforts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIRGINIA ELLIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Battered by a rash of insurance insolvencies, the state-run company
that provides a safety net for millions of California workers has
been directed by Insurance Commissioner Harry Low to take emergency
steps to improve its financial condition, according to documents and
key state officials.</LD>
<LD>   Low set a June 14 deadline for the State Compensation Insurance
Fund to devise a strategy for beefing up its reserves and strongly
suggested it should include a sharp increase in premium rates, the
elimination of discounts for certain policyholders and a reduction in
commissions for brokers and agents who sell coverage for the fund.</LD>
<LD>   The fund provides workers' compensation insurance for more than
half of the businesses in the state and any rate increase would
affect hundreds of thousands of employers, from local governments and
school districts to private enterprises. Even without those
increases, public entities such as the Los Angeles Unified School
District, as well as city and county governments around the state,
are wrestling with increasing worker-compensation costs; a further
hike would only deepen their budget woes.</LD>
<TE>   The fund's "ongoing financial viability is of great concern and a
No. 1 priority to this department and, more important, is an utmost
necessity to your 260,000 policyholders and the economy of
California," Low said in a letter to the fund President Kenneth
Bollier.</TE>
<TE>   In response, Bollier fired off a missive to his policyholders,
warning that Low's "egregious and unwarranted directive is a recipe
for economic disaster....</TE>
<TE>   "It will result in horrendous increases in workers' compensation
costs for all California employers, whether insured with state fund
or not," Bollier's letter said.</TE>
<TE>   He accused the commissioner of overkill, saying the combination of
suggestions exceeded what was needed to improve the fund's financial
condition.</TE>
<TE>   Bollier complained that Low had bowed to pressure from private
insurers who, he said, wanted to raise their rates without having to
worry about competition from the government-operated insurer. "This
mind-set is apparently shared by the California Department of
Insurance," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Low said the unusual action against another state
agency had not come at the behest of any private insurers but had
been prompted by his concern that the state fund, which has
experienced phenomenal growth in the last two years, was not charging
enough in premiums to cover all the risk it was assuming.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly if it continues to grow as it has grown in the last two
years and if rates continue at the level they are now, I think the
decline in reserves will accelerate and that will be a serious
problem for us," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In his letter, Low offered to work with fund managers to improve
their financial picture, but warned that if they were "unable or
unwilling to develop an acceptable action plan" he was prepared to
take corrective action.</TE>
<TE>   The move by Low was another jolt to the state's troubled
workers'compensation system, already struggling with nearly a dozen
insurance company insolvencies, skyrocketing premium rates and now
the deteriorating financial condition of its biggest insurer.</TE>
<TE>   "The state fund is the anchor that could take the whole system
down," said Assembly Insurance Committee Chairman Thomas Calderon
(D-Montebello).</TE>
<TE>   Workers' compensation provides benefits to injured workers and
covers more than 13 million employees. Last year it paid benefits to
more than a million workers.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Zelinski, a spokesman for the fund, said its managers have
been concerned that reserves are not as high as they would like, and
have proposed a rate increase to become effective July 1. It has yet
to be approved.</TE>
<TE>   He insisted that concern over the adequacy of reserves was
something that could be easily remedied and does not mean the fund is
approaching insolvency.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to assure all our policyholders and their injured workers
that there is no question about our ability, our financial
wherewithal, to pay financial claims now and in the future," he said.</TE>
<TE>   According to experts in the field, the fund's troubles are rooted
in a 1993 legislative decision to deregulate workers' compensation
and have been exacerbated by Gov. Gray Davis' failure to appoint a
governing board.</TE>
<TE>   The five members of the board were named by former Gov. Pete
Wilson and their terms have expired.</TE>
<TE>   "In effect," said one legislator, "you have had a governing board
who is answerable to no one."</TE>
<TE>   The state fund was created by the Legislature in 1914, with a
mandate to be competitive and to serve as the insurer of last resort,
meaning it was to provide coverage to those businesses that couldn't
get it elsewhere. In the mid-1990s, when deregulation went into
effect, the fund was considered an island of stability in the a
competitive private market.</TE>
<TE>   Deregulation set off competition among private insurers who began
charging premiums that were so low the insurers could not provide the
reserves to cover potential losses.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of the decade, the biggest workers' compensation
insurers in the state were insolvent.</TE>
<TE>   Market-Change Fallout</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, the state fund, which had not lowered its rates
precipitously during the cutthroat years, began to absorb much of the
business served by the failed insurance companies.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the remaining private insurers were forced to
increase rates to stay afloat.</TE>
<TE>   The state fund held 20% of the market share in 2000. By 2001 it
held 31%. In 2002, its share is estimated at 42%.</TE>
<TE>   Calderon, who has monitored the fund's activities for the last 1
1/2 years, said no insurance business can sustain that kind of rapid
growth and still keep reserves high enough to cover short- and long-
term losses.</TE>
<TE>   "The only way you could do that is to be smarter than any other
private insurer in the country, to have better loss control and to
have the highest rates," he said. "They do not have any of these
elements."</TE>
<TE>   He accused the fund of being irresponsible, saying it had fueled
much of its growth by an aggressive marketing strategy that included
television advertisements, special dividends to big policyholders and
rewards to agents and brokers who brought in a lot of business.</TE>
<TE>   "We've heard stories where they have been part of a bidding
process. They would not be the lowest bidder so they would come back
the next day with a 10% decrease from the rate they had offered the
day before," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "That is clearly predatory pricing and that is clearly not the
role of the state fund."</TE>
<TE>   Zelinski said the fund never engaged in predatory pricing and was
only abiding by its mandate to be competitive.</TE>
<TE>   If the fund were only relegated to accepting the high-risk
business that can't get coverage elsewhere, he said, it could not
operate.</TE>
<TE>   "The Legislature did not intend for the state fund to be solely an
assigned-risk carrier," he said. "The intent was to have it serve as
a stabilizing force in the system."</TE>
<TE>   In his letter, Bollier complained the fund was being unfairly
attacked by Low when its presence in the market had prevented an
"availability and affordability" crisis after the collapse of many
companies.</TE>
<TE>   But Mark Webb, vice president of the Western region of the
American Insurance Assn., said private insurers have watched the
fund's rapid growth with alarm.</TE>
<TE>   If the fund were eventually to become insolvent, he said, private
carriers worry they will be assessed to help pay claims the fund
could not handle.</TE>
<TE>   "So we, by and large, think it's a positive thing what the
commissioner is trying to do for state fund," he said.</TE>

<LD>   The loaded language on both sides of the secession
debate--comparing a municipal breakup to the biblical story of
Exodus, the American Revolution, the Civil War and the end of South
African apartheid--hints at the highly emotional appeals to come.</LD>
<TE>   Unlike many traditional campaigns over issues or candidates, the
two secession proposals on the Nov. 5 ballot offer so many unknowns,
at such high stakes, that many arguments can be easily twisted to
support either side. The result, political experts say, is likely to
be a debate based more on passion than reason.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign is expected to intensify after a summer lull, with
both camps planning a drumbeat of mail and television ads in the
fall. Hahn's anti-secession team plans to raise $5 million for the
effort, while secession backers hope to collect at least $4 million.</TE>
<TE>   The money will bring to the airwaves conflicting messages of hope
and despair.</TE>
<TE>   Attentive Politicians</TE>
<TE>   Secession backers aim to convince voters in all parts of Los
Angeles that smaller cities mean more attentive elected officials
providing better, cheaper services. They imply that a split could
eventually help fix public schools, even though the secession measure
would not change the existing school system.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents argue that a breakup would only spawn more politicians
while endangering city finances and services across the board,
especially public safety.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides have taken a broad approach rather than crafting
distinct messages for specific ethnic or income groups, although that
could change as the campaigns sharpen their focus.</TE>
<TE>   Secession supporters paint City Hall as a dark, distant empire,
where arrogant politicians and power brokers gorge at the taxpayers'
trough while shortchanging the people paying the bills.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the billionaires versus the people," said Richard Close,
chairman of the secession group Valley VOTE.</TE>
<TE>   Reject the downtown political elite, secessionists tell voters in
the breakaway regions, and everything will improve. "Local
control"--even in a Valley city of 1.35 million--will banish
government waste and boost services. Council districts will be
smaller, politicians more responsive.</TE>
<TE>   Polishing the Message</TE>
<TE>   But proponents must also polish the other side of the secession
coin: the remainder of Los Angeles. To win, they need voter approval
not just within the breakaway areas, but also among voters citywide.</TE>
<TE>   So secession supporters are now leavening gripes against downtown
with more upbeat promises that resonate across the city.</TE>
<TE>   "This is good for all areas of the city," said Ben Goddard, the
campaign manager recently hired by secessionists. "Government will be
much closer to the people in the new Los Angeles and in the Valley
and Hollywood. It's a win-win for everyone. Smaller is better. It's
more responsive to people's needs."</TE>
<TE>   But anti-secessionists believe a similar message of control also
works for them. The approach plays on fear of the unknown: Approve
secession, and who knows what disasters could be unleashed. Keeping
the city whole means keeping things from spinning out of control, so
everyone can rest assured that Los Angeles police and firefighters
will be there when needed.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole idea is: Is it worth the risk?" said Kam Kuwata,
political strategist for the mayor's anti-secession campaign. "If a
Northridge earthquake hits or a Sept. 11 hits, will they be ready for
that?"</TE>
<TE>   The what-ifs tend to play on fears about financial and physical
security. Would services be cut? Could taxes go up? What about water
and power bills? Would public safety suffer? Would a Valley city be
able to float bonds to build more police stations?</TE>
<TE>   "Many people fear the unknown," said Jaime Regalado, executive
director of the Pat Brown Institute for Public Affairs at Cal State
Los Angeles. "With secession, the unknowns are so vast. There's no
historical guideposts for this, so the anti-secession side will be
stressing: 'As problematic as you see the city now, all sorts of
horrors await you' " if a breakup occurs.</TE>
<TE>   Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt</TE>
<TE>   Secession supporters have already coined a catch-all phrase to
dispel the power of such scary images. They call it "fud"--fear,
uncertainty and doubt. It has even begun to pop up as a verb, as in:
"There goes the mayor, fudding again," whenever Hahn warns of
secession's dire consequences.</TE>
<TE>   Now that Valley and Hollywood cityhood questions have made the
ballot, opponents of all stripes have bolted into action--leading to
multiple variations on the anti-secession theme.</TE>
<TE>   There are municipal union leaders, warning that secession would
jeopardize thousands of city jobs; Gray Panthers, concerned about the
impact on senior services; and, yes, a few billionaires such as real
estate mogul Eli Broad, who want to enhance Los Angeles' status as a
cultural capital and the nation's second-largest city.</TE>
<TE>   Some civic leaders, including former Mayor Richard Riordan and
former Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa, are trying to put a
positive spin on the anti-secession campaign.</TE>
<TE>   They emphasize Los Angeles' attributes and seek to inspire unity.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn, who has been criticized for being too negative, sometimes
points to neighborhood councils as evidence that the city is moving
in the right direction.</TE>
<TE>   He has also taken to citing the "greatness" of Los Angeles, but
usually without specific examples.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great, great city," the mayor said at a recent
anti-secession rally in the Valley. "It's the greatest city in the
world because of the great people who live here."</TE>
<TE>   Other secession opponents, joined under the grass-roots group One
Los Angeles, have started distributing campaign literature listing
the alleged dangers of Valley secession.</TE>
<TE>   "Reduced services everywhere," one flier predicts. "A tax raise
for the Valley."</TE>
<TE>   That's the exact opposite of what the secession leaders promise.
So who's right?</TE>
<TE>   Differing Conclusions</TE>
<TE>   The trouble is, so many studies have reached so many different
conclusions that each side can point to data that appear to prove its
point.</TE>
<TE>   Even the Local Agency Formation Commission, the state panel that
studied secession's financial impact for two years before putting it
on the ballot, has issued conflicting reports.</TE>
<TE>   In his final analysis, LAFCO Executive Director Larry Calemine
concluded that the Hollywood and Valley cities would have sufficient
reserves in their early years.</TE>
<TE>   "Our overarching challenge will be to communicate the real bottom
line," Goddard said. "People will start to discover that the facts
refute the fear argument."</TE>
<TE>   Several campaign veterans, however, said negative campaigns can be
quite effective. Hahn used such tactics to his advantage in last
year's mayoral race, when he dinged Villaraigosa with a television ad
depicting a crack pipe and suggesting that his opponent was soft on
drugs.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is, time and again, negative campaigns have
impacts," said Mark Fabiani, a Democratic strategist who served as
deputy mayor in Tom Bradley's administration and directed
communications for Al Gore's 2000 presidential race. "They move
voters."</TE>
<TE>   Secessionists, too, can point to plenty of negatives that might
move voters--away from Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "There are less police on the streets now than four years ago.
Crime rates are going through the roof, particularly in the Valley,"
said former Assemblyman Richard Katz, a leader of the Valley
breakaway bid. "Some of what the mayor is predicting is already
happening on his watch."</TE>
<TE>   Ethnic Debate</TE>
<TE>   So far, both sides have stepped lightly around issues of race and
ethnicity. The pro-secession camp insists that leaving Los Angeles is
not a matter of "white flight," pointing out that Latinos would be
the largest group in a Valley city. Valley VOTE leaders say support
for a study of secession was strongest in the northeast Valley, a
predominantly Latino area.</TE>
<TE>   They also have reached out to black community leaders in South Los
Angeles, but their message, once again, was general: A smaller city
would benefit everyone.</TE>
<TE>   In recent days, however, Hahn has begun to say that he fears
"communities of color" and immigrants would be left behind
economically if the Valley and Hollywood secede.</TE>
<TE>   Earl Ofari Hutchinson, an African American commentator, has
written several columns warning that secession could hurt black and
Latino city workers, reduce services and increase taxes for the poor.</TE>
<TE>   On other fronts, secession opponents plan to point out that a
breakup would have no impact on the Los Angeles Unified School
District. But some secessionists, including Hollywood nightclub owner
Gene La Pietra, say slicing up the troubled district is the next
step.</TE>
<TE>   So far, much of the spin has been confined to small rallies and
news conferences, radio interviews and newspaper articles.</TE>
<TE>   Changing Scope</TE>
<TE>   Although both sides boast of having armies of volunteers, the
attendance at most gatherings to discuss secession has numbered in
the dozens.</TE>
<TE>   If voters do decide to break up Los Angeles, the real scope of
change, good or bad, will probably not be clear for years.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not very good at predicting the future," said Bruce Cain, a
professor of political science at UC Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   "If the true consequences of secession were agreed upon and
everybody knew them, it would lower the level of hysteria and fear."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Refuses to Buy Back Oil Leases</HD>
<DH>Environment: Interior's Norton spurns Davis, saying
Florida's request was granted because it 'opposes coastal drilling
and California does not.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH R. WEISS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Bush administration on Friday rejected Gov. Gray Davis' request
that it buy back offshore drilling rights, as it did last week in
Florida, arguing that circumstances in the two states are quite
different and that "Florida opposes coastal drilling and California
does not."</LD>
<LD>   That statement, which seems sharply at odds with prevailing
sentiment in California, was among a list of reasons cited by
Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton for dismissing Davis' request, made
in a May 30 letter, for federal funds to buy out three dozen oil
leases and protect the state's "beautiful coastal waters."</LD>
<LD>   In her response, Norton said that two lawsuits, one filed by
California and another by oil companies, preclude the administration
from cutting a deal as was done in Florida, where Bush pledged $235
million to buy back offshore oil and gas leases.</LD>
<TE>   "Third," Norton wrote, "a major difference between Florida and
California is that Florida opposes coastal drilling and California
does not."</TE>
<TE>   According to aides, the observation surprised and delighted the
Democratic governor on Friday. Davis for years has appealed to voters
with a shared opposition to offshore oil drilling.</TE>
<TE>   "Ever since the spill off Santa Barbara in 1969, Californians have
vehemently opposed new offshore drilling," Davis said in a statement
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "With all due respect, [Norton] fundamentally misunderstands ...
California's long fight about offshore oil drilling," the governor
said.</TE>
<TE>   The 1969 blowout of an oil platform did more than solidify
California's opposition to offshore drilling. Heart-wrenching images
of dying, oil-soaked birds and goo-covered beaches inspired the
nation's first Earth Day and helped launch the environmental
movement.</TE>
<TE>   Norton's letter startled environmentalists.</TE>
<TE>   "California's opposition to oil drilling dates back 43 years,"
said Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club. "It's fair to
say that Secretary Norton is a half-century behind the times."</TE>
<TE>   "California sent a message first to Ronald Reagan, second to
George Herbert Walker Bush and third to Bill Clinton and, if we have
to, to George Bush: 'Don't drill our coast,' " Pope said.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Charter, a longtime offshore oil activist, said Norton
should visit the state soon for a lesson in California politics.
"This is the state where opposition to oil drilling began. She needs
to do some homework."</TE>
<TE>   To buttress her argument, Norton outlined the history of oil
drilling in Florida and California. "No oil or gas has ever been
commercially produced from state or federal leases offshore Florida,"
she wrote.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, she cited drilling activity on leases in California
waters that oil companies began developing before Congress and state
officials imposed a ban on new leasing. State officials, she pointed
out, have allowed 150 wells to be drilled in state waters since 1990
on 34 active leases. State waters extend three miles from shore.</TE>
<TE>   An additional 43 leased tracts exist off California in federal
waters, those which are at least three miles offshore. These
tracts--each three miles square--are the site of 114 wells drilled
since 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Pfeifle, a spokesman for Norton, said Davis, either as
governor or lieutenant governor helped oversee such drilling.</TE>
<TE>   "Since 1990, in various capacities, Mr. Davis has overseen more
oil pumping than the Beverly Hillbillies," Pfeifle said.</TE>
<TE>   "That's kind of ridiculous," said Garry South, the governor's top
political strategist. "Gray [Davis] has fashioned his career around
the environment and offshore drilling."</TE>
<TE>   Mary Nichols, secretary of the California Resources Agency, said
the letter shows how Norton is grasping for reasons why the
administration is treating California differently from Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Many Democrats claim that the buyback program in Florida was
designed to boost the reelection chances of, first, the president's
brother, Republican Gov. Jeb Bush who will likely face former U.S.
Atty. Gen. Janet Reno in November, and, second, President Bush
himself in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Nichols said, the Bush administration fails to
understand the difference between drilling additional wells in
developed areas and opening up unspoiled patches of the ocean to
development.</TE>
<TE>   "California has been an oil-drilling state and we are proud of our
contribution to the nation's energy needs," Nichols said. "But that
doesn't mean we don't want to protect the pristine areas of our
coastline."</TE>
<TE>   For nearly two decades, California and the federal government have
been tussling over undeveloped oil leases off the coast of Ventura,
Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties.</TE>
<TE>   The number of these tracts of sea floor, which were leased to oil
companies between 1969 and 1984, has been whittled down over the
years.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, 36 tracts remain in place. They could be developed if
oil companies manage to clear all federal and state environmental
hurdles.</TE>
<TE>   But state and federal officials disagree on what those hurdles
should be--resulting in a lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   California officials maintain that federal law gives them the
right to review new oil-drilling plans in federal waters off the
state's coastline to make sure they conform with state regulations
protecting air and water quality, sea life and scenic views.</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. District Court judge last June agreed, effectively blocking
new oil-drilling plans until they pass muster with the California
Coastal Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, lawyers for Norton and the Interior
Department's Minerals Management Service appealed the decision.
Attorneys are scheduled to present their arguments before the U.S.
9th Circuit Court of Appeals on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Norton referred to this suit in her letter to Davis, noting that
its outcome will have significant implications for energy needs
beyond California's borders.</TE>
<TE>   She also mentioned a lawsuit brought in January by oil companies.</TE>
<TE>   Nuevo Energy Co. of Houston and several other firms accused the
federal government of breaching contracts with delays and
ever-changing rules that have thwarted their ability to produce oil
from these tracts.</TE>
<TE>   A similar lawsuit was filed by oil firms in Florida two years ago,
Norton said, giving federal officials ample time to figure out how
much these companies should be paid to settle the lawsuit and buy
back the leases.</TE>
<TE>   Her letter indicated that the California lawsuit needs more time
to progress to evaluate oil company claims and to structure any
settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Pfeifle, Norton's spokesman, said no one has ruled out a future
settlement that would include buying back or swapping the leases.</TE>
<TE>   "In due time, a cooperative agreement may be available, much like
the one in Florida," he said.</TE>

<HD>A Tip to the Air Traveler: Look Out Below</HD>
<DH>Almost any flight can be brightened with a little knowledge
and a seat by the window, and some of the best routes for views are
in the West.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HYMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sometimes you're on the Grand Canyon side of the plane and sometimes
you're not.</LD>
<LD>   For some people, it makes a big difference. Sitting with nose
pressed against the window, gazing at the marvels of nature can be
the sole reward for the expense and hassle of commercial air travel.</LD>
<LD>   The following is intended as a loose guide to help geographically
attuned passengers see the canyon and many other sights around the
American West and a few points beyond.</LD>
<TE>   There are a few caveats. Clouds do get in the way, and routes can
change dramatically due to weather, wind and air traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, it may seem to some veteran travelers that the only sights
they are certain to see on a flight between Los Angeles and New York
are Barstow and Kansas.</TE>
<TE>   That said, just about every route in the West can deliver
something worth seeing, simply because the region is so expansive and
diverse. Here are just a few standout flights:</TE>
<TE>   Salt Lake City to Los Angeles. Where to sit: Left. The route
mostly follows Interstate 15, initially traveling along the western
edge of the beautiful Wasatch Mountains.</TE>
<TE>   Later, there are views of Zion National Park, Lake Mead and Hoover
Dam--which from the air looks like a wafer of concrete holding back a
few billion gallons of water.</TE>
<TE>   About 15 minutes before landing, look for Big Bear Lake and
Southern California's two tallest peaks, Mt. San Gorgonio and Mt. San
Jacinto.</TE>
<TE>   Kalispell, Mont., to Missoula, Mont. Where to sit: Left. This
30-minute flight--often a segment on the Kalispell-to-Salt Lake
route--stays at low altitudes and offers bird's-eye views of Flathead
Lake, the Mission Mountains, Swan Valley and, beyond, the Continental
Divide and the Bob Marshall Wilderness.</TE>
<TE>   "The Bob" covers 1 million acres and is accessible only by horse
or foot. It also boasts one of the largest remaining grizzly bear
populations in the lower 48 states.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles to Chicago, New York or Denver. Where to sit: Right.
This flight path tends to deviate more than most, but roll the dice
on the right, as the first 2 1/2 hours may feature the Grand Canyon,
Lake Mead, Lake Powell, Monument Valley and the San Juan Mountains of
southwest Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   If the route is pushed north, the right side overlooks many of
southern Utah's greatest wonders, including Zion and Bryce Canyon
national parks, Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, Lake
Powell and Canyonlands National Park--recognizable because the area's
two major rivers, the Green and Colorado, converge there.</TE>
<TE>   Either side will likely serve up a nice slice of the Colorado
Rockies. Those on the right might get a look at Telluride, an old
mining town that has become one of the Rockies' tonier haunts. Look
for ski runs at the end of a box canyon.</TE>
<TE>   Salt Lake to Jackson, Wyo. Where to sit: Right. The flight lasts
only an hour or so, but Bear Lake and five mountain ranges may be
within view--the Wasatch, Uintas, Gros Ventre, Wind Rivers and
Tetons.</TE>
<TE>   Use binoculars to look for bison and elk on the approach, as the
Jackson airport is nearly surrounded by Grand Teton National Park.</TE>
<TE>   Las Vegas to Bay Area. Where to sit: Right. Immediately after
takeoff, there are views of the Nevada Test Site. The hundreds of
craters in the desert floor were formed by the 900-plus underground
nuclear weapons tests conducted there between 1951 and 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Crossing the Sierra Nevada, those on the right usually see
Yosemite National Park, while left-siders must make do with the
equally stupendous John Muir Wilderness.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who has backpacked to the Sierra's Thousand Island Lake
knows there's a major air corridor directly overhead. This is it.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle to Anchorage. Where to sit: Right. The route follows the
rugged British Columbia coast, and highlights include the Strait of
Georgia, Queen Charlotte Sound, mountains and glaciers, dense coastal
rainforests, the southeast Alaska archipelago and Chugach range.
Brace yourself for some immense timber clear cuts.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles to Seattle or Sacramento. Where to sit: Right. The
route follows Highway 99 north, and those with a keen eye can pick
out every major Sierra landmark, including Mt. Whitney, Kings Canyon,
Mammoth Mountain, Mono Lake, the Yosemite Valley and Half Dome, and
Lake Tahoe. Views are best late in the day, when the sun is on the
plane's left side.</TE>
<TE>   If you are traveling to Seattle, try to find an empty seat on the
left side for Mt. Lassen, Mt. Shasta and Crater Lake. Then shift back
to the right for Mt. Bachelor, Mt. Hood and Mt. Rainier. After
crossing the Columbia River, views of Mt. St. Helen's are possible
from either side.</TE>
<TE>   Something to tell your seatmate: In just 180 years, the forests
blown down by the volcano will again resemble old growth.</TE>
<TE>   Bozeman, Mont., to Seattle. Where to sit: Either. Highlights
include the rugged Bitterroot Mountains--just north of where Lewis
and Clark staggered across the range--and the high peaks of North
Cascades National Park. On landing, there are great views of Puget
Sound and the Olympic Peninsula. Lefties get Idaho's Frank Church
River of No Return Wilderness, one of the largest roadless expanses
in the lower 48.</TE>
<TE>   Honolulu to Hilo. Where to sit: Left, then right. On the first
half of the flight expect to see Molokai and Maui, with views of
10,023-foot Haleakala. As the plane crosses the wide Alenuihaha
Channel, it's time for the critical switch to the right to see the
north coast of the Big Island, including beaches, waterfalls and a
pair of volcanoes., 13,796-foot Mauna Kea and in the distance,
13,679-foot Mauna Loa.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles to Reno. Where to sit: Left. The plane soars almost
directly above Yosemite's Half Dome with the Grand Canyon of the
Tuolumne, Emigrant Wilderness and Lake Tahoe serving as worthy
encores.</TE>
<TE>   Christchurch, New Zealand, to Queenstown, New Zealand. Where to
sit: Either. Inspiring views of the Southern Alps help explain why so
many Kiwis become world-class mountain climbers.</TE>
<TE>   A final tip: People who really enjoy the window seat should invest
in "The Captain's Atlas," available at most aviation supply stores.
The book is a Rand McNally road atlas that includes all the major
routes that airlines use.</TE>
<TE>   That makes it easier to follow the landscape and figure out which
side to pick when buying tickets. Then, hope for clear skies--and a
clean window.</TE>

<HD>Energy Scheme Details Emerge</HD>
<DH>Power: Firm offered electricity traders ways to profit from
state loopholes before deregulation began, records say.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Perot Systems was peddling ways to manipulate California's
deregulated energy market even before the market was formally
launched, according to newly released records.</LD>
<LD>   The state's power grid operator was warned about the activity but
apparently did nothing after initially threatening legal action.</LD>
<LD>   Newly released documents show that an official with San Diego Gas
&amp; Electric Co. complained to the California Independent System
Operator in the fall of 1997 that Perot Systems Corp. had offered to
sell SDG&amp;E and other energy companies a blueprint for exploiting
market loopholes.</LD>
<TE>   Cal-ISO officials responded with a strongly worded letter accusing
the company of a conflict of interest, citing Perot Systems' contract
with Cal-ISO to help develop the computer system for the state's
energy market.</TE>
<TE>   "Perot Systems' marketing of its inside knowledge of the ISO's
system to third parties so that they may economically exploit the new
California energy market" was "a flagrant violation of basic norms of
business ethics and indicative of bad-faith dealing," former Cal-ISO
President Jeffrey Tranen wrote Perot Systems Vice President H. Ronald
Nash in that 1997 exchange. The practice, Tranen said, "would
seriously erode the integrity of the new California energy market."</TE>
<TE>   However, current Cal-ISO officials say the dispute evidently was
never settled, and records and interviews show that Perot Systems
continued to offer similar information to Reliant Energy Co. in 1998,
the year the deregulated energy market went live.</TE>
<TE>   "Management had a concern, expressed it very forcefully," said
Charles Robinson, Cal-ISO's current general counsel, who was not with
the agency in 1997. "But I don't see anything in our files to
indicate it was ever resolved."</TE>
<TE>   Perot Systems, founded by former presidential candidate H. Ross
Perot, has strenuously denied any wrongdoing. A spokesman said Friday
that although the company is conducting an internal investigation
into its power consulting practices, it had "uncovered nothing at
all" on the SDG&amp;E presentation. The company's stock, which took a
beating this week after its blueprint to Reliant for exploiting the
market came to light, recovered slightly Friday, rising $1.26, or
9.8%, to close at $14.16.</TE>
<TE>   Contrary to assurances that Perot Systems offered in writing to
Cal-ISO after the SDG&amp;E complaint, the marketing pitch that Perot
Systems later made to Reliant contained even more details on ways to
"game" the energy market, according to a California Senate
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The legislative probe has determined that Perot Systems made the
sales pitch to at least five companies active in California's energy
market, and has homed in on two former Perot Systems employees who
helped set up the protocols for the state market, according to a
source familiar with the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "If in fact Perot Systems turns out to be the [author] of some of
the manipulative strategies that were subsequently used to impact the
market price, Perot Systems falls under the cloud of being a
co-conspirator," said state Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana), the lawmaker
leading the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The Texas-based information technology company, Dunn argued, could
not only be subject to state prosecution for violations of California
business and professions codes against market manipulation, but it
also could be prosecuted under federal racketeering statutes.</TE>
<TE>   California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer is also investigating Perot
Systems, and Gov. Gray Davis on Friday reiterated his call for a
federal inquiry.</TE>
<TE>   "California cannot continue to be held hostage to this
unconscionable behavior," Davis said in a letter to Patrick Wood,
chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Cal-ISO officials said Friday they are awaiting the outcome of the
various investigations to determine whether to take legal action
against Perot Systems, one of three companies that shared a
$57-million contract to develop the computer system behind the
state's power market.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Friday, a group led by Art Madrid, mayor of the San Diego
suburb of La Mesa, filed a class-action suit alleging that Perot
Systems engaged in "unlawful, unfair and deceptive business
practices."</TE>
<TE>   Cal-ISO, the operator of 70% of the state's power grid, became
aware that Perot Systems was peddling information on market loopholes
after SDG&amp;E executive Gary Cotton attended a presentation by Perot
Systems in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Cotton, who also served on the Cal-ISO board, notified colleagues
there four to six weeks later and urged that they investigate,
according to the San Diego utility. He also notified the California
Power Exchange, the state's other quasi-governmental market overseer.
Cotton, who retired from SDG&amp;E in 2000, did not respond to an
interview request.</TE>
<TE>   When the subsequent dispute between Cal-ISO and Perot Systems
erupted in October 1997, Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the
Independent Energy Producers Assn., was chairman of the Cal-ISO
board. But he said Friday he did not recall the matter coming to the
board.</TE>
<TE>   "If Perot [in its presentation] identified loopholes that
subsequently were closed, the information had little value," he said.
"But if they were saying, 'This is a way to beat the system,' that is
troubling. It's like the guy who put the home security system on your
home telling people there is no alarm on the back two windows."</TE>
<TE>   Smutny-Jones said Tranen, the former Cal-ISO president, was an
intense chief executive who aggressively monitored vendors. "I don't
know if he got it nipped in the bud or not," he said. Tranen could
not be reached for comment at his New York office.</TE>
<TE>   Perot Systems has said its sales pitches were unsuccessful. The
company made a presentation to Reliant in June 1998, then made two
follow-up sales and marketing efforts later that year, according to
Reliant spokeswoman Sandy Fruhman. The company turned over the
presentation, for which it paid Perot Systems an $11,000 consulting
fee, in response to requests by Dunn and federal regulators.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an informational presentation on the operation of the
California energy market," Fruhman said. "It was a one-shot deal, and
did not lead to any ongoing relationship."</TE>
<TE>   In response to suggestions by Dunn that the Western Power Trading
Forum may have played a role in the dissemination of the Perot
Systems blueprint, Gary Ackerman, executive director of the industry
group, said it had not yet been formed when the Perot presentations
began.</TE>
<TE>   But Ackerman said elements of the presentations may have been
shared with utilities, energy companies and other members of a trust
that preceded formation of Cal-ISO and the California Power Exchange.
He said there would have been nothing improper with Perot Systems
discussing loopholes during the period.</TE>
<TE>   "Perot Systems was hired [partly] to identify potential gaps in
the system and advising ... how to fix them, which they did," said
Ackerman, who believes that Dunn has blown the Perot documents out of
proportion and besmirched harmless activity. "He's talking about a
blueprint for a house that had not been built."</TE>
<TE>   Dunn on Friday fired a shot at Perot Systems, accusing the company
of making misleading statements about its blueprint and the role of
Cal-ISO, a charge the company denied.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether he would take Perot up on an offer to testify before
his committee, Dunn, who spoke to Perot by telephone Friday, said,
"The likelihood has increased."</TE>

<HD>Aquarium Fishing for a Great White</HD>
<DH>Sharks: Monterey facility begins three-year bid to catch
predator in waters off Ventura.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KELLY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With a small armada of ships and a huge undersea pen, the Monterey
Bay Aquarium has launched a three-year effort to be the first to
capture and successfully exhibit a great white shark, the ocean's
most feared predator.</LD>
<LD>   Scientists from the aquarium spent last month trolling up and down
the coast from Santa Barbara to San Diego, trying to hook a baby
great white. A tugboat, one of four vessels involved in the
Ventura-based operation, towed a 5-million-gallon undersea pen to the
Channel Islands to hold the animal if captured.</LD>
<LD>   According to biologists, great white sharks have never survived
more than three weeks in captivity, largely because they won't eat.
Researchers hope to reverse the trend by reducing the stress of
capture, using a suitable tank and focusing on sharks younger than 1
year.</LD>
<TE>   The white shark pups, 3 feet long at birth, are known to inhabit
the shallow waters just a mile or two off the coast of Ventura, where
they sometimes get tangled in commercial fishing nets.</TE>
<TE>   A fishing boat chartered by the aquarium spent 28 days trolling
for the young sharks, deploying 8,000 mackerel-baited hooks in the
process. But unusually cold and murky water kept the animals away.</TE>
<TE>   Officials plan to return next year during the animals' birthing
season to try again.</TE>
<TE>   "If it was easy, our researchers could have done it years ago,"
said John O'Sullivan, curator of field operations for the aquarium,
which is devoting $1.1 million for the attempts.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no experts who can tell you what is going on with these
sharks," said O'Sullivan, who rented a house near Ventura Harbor
during this year's effort. "You can fill a thimble with the
information we know about them."</TE>
<TE>   Tim Athens, skipper of the Oxnard-based boat that fished for the
great whites, had planned to limit his search to Ventura County, but
cold water forced him to travel as far south as Encinitas.</TE>
<TE>   "We started a little early because that's when the pen was
available," he said. "There is not a lot known about juvenile white
sharks, but they congregate in the Ventura flats."</TE>
<TE>   Some scientists think white sharks are born in warm water and move
north when they get older and their diet changes from fish to
mammals.</TE>
<TE>   Kip Whited, a commercial halibut fisherman in Ventura, said baby
sharks get ensnared in his nets every year.</TE>
<TE>   "We would catch them from the surf line to eight miles out," he
said. "We usually just let them go."</TE>
<TE>   Exhibiting a great white shark would be both a commercial and
scientific coup. Researchers could examine the shark's mysterious
habits up close, while the public could get eyeball to eyeball with
an animal that can reach 21 feet in length, weigh 7,000 pounds and
have up to 3,000 teeth, each 3 inches long.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be a wonderful spokesman for the aquarium," O'Sullivan
said.</TE>
<TE>   Never cuddly to begin with, great whites have yet to overcome
their image as brutal killers with a taste for young swimmers, a
reputation largely created by the movie "Jaws."</TE>
<TE>   Scientists now believe the sharks attack people when they mistake
them for sea lions.</TE>
<TE>   There have been 82 great white shark attacks in California waters
since 1950, eight of them fatal, said John McCosker, former director
of San Francisco's Steinhart Aquarium and currently chairman of
aquatic biology at the California Academy of Sciences.</TE>
<TE>   In 1989, a kayaker was killed by a great white off Malibu. In
1994, a sea urchin diver died after an attack near San Miguel Island
in the Channel Islands chain. Last week, a surfer was bitten at
Stinson Beach north of San Francisco, where another great white
mauled a boogie boarder in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   If a young white is caught, it would go in the pen anchored near
Santa Cruz Island, where divers would measure it, take DNA samples
and--most importantly--try to get it to eat.</TE>
<TE>   The aquarium could tow the pen with the shark back to Monterey Bay
or move it in a 3,000-gallon, 44-foot truck dubbed the "Tunabago."</TE>
<TE>   If the shark showed any signs of distress, it would be tagged and
released.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not in the business of catching and killing animals just
to try and put them on exhibit," O'Sullivan said, noting that the
aquarium had a white shark for 11 days in 1984, but the animal died.</TE>
<TE>   If the captured shark thrived, it would go into a million-gallon,
90-foot-long, 35-foot-deep tank.</TE>
<TE>   Other aquariums also briefly held great whites. In 1981, Sea World
in San Diego had one for 16 days before it died, and the Steinhart
Aquarium kept one for four days before releasing it.</TE>
<TE>   "Our white shark lived longer than anyone else's because we let it
go before it died," said McCosker, who has co-written a book on great
whites.</TE>
<TE>   That 7-foot shark was moved from Bodega Bay to the aquarium, but
once inside, it banged so hard against the tank that it exhausted
itself.</TE>
<TE>   "If Monterey succeeds, they won't exactly humanize these
creatures, but they will make people understand that they are not the
rogue killers we knew from 'Jaws,' " McCosker said. "They are
endangered throughout their range and are very key players in the
ecosystem. They should be pitied, not feared."</TE>

<LD>   More than 1,100 firefighters from around the country have been
working in around-the-clock shifts to knock down the stubborn blaze,
which has raced through brush-covered valleys and hillsides in the
Sespe Wilderness. Despite an aggressive air and ground assault, the
fire is only 25% contained.</LD>
<LD>   At an encampment set up at Soule Park in Ojai, dome tents dotted
the landscape as weary firefighters slept under shade trees, the tops
of their heads poking from sleeping bags tossed onto the grass. Some
played cards at picnic tables, chatted among themselves or read books
as they waited for their next stint at the front lines.</LD>
<TE>   They described the terrain in the Sespe Wilderness as steep and
dry, the twigs and branches so brittle that they crackle and pop when
firefighters swing their tools. Temperatures have ranged from the
mid-80s to the high-90s, with winds at 10 to 25 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Squatting under a tree in the park, U.S. Forest Service
firefighter Jack McKenzie sharpened a rake-like tool he uses to cut
fire breaks through the deep brush.</TE>
<TE>   His face still dark with soot, McKenzie had just come from Pine
Mountain Ridge, where his 20-person crew from the Tahoe National
Forest worked to keep the fire from spreading south.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like icing," he said of the wall of fire that threatened to
spread down the slope, "and you're trying to keep it from slopping
over."</TE>
<TE>   With fluctuating weather conditions and enough dry brush to keep
the fire burning for days, firefighting crews are settling in for the
long haul, said David Drum, spokesman for the state Department of
Forestry. The fire has cost state and county agencies $6.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   Many firefighters have to be flown into the fire area because of
the rugged mountain terrain. Others face two- to three-mile hikes to
the front lines. Because of the commute time, many firefighters are
working shifts of 30 hours or longer, Drum said.</TE>
<TE>   Carrying backpacks of food, the firefighters consider themselves
on "coyote assignment." They eat and sleep in safe places at the fire
site and wake up to battle the fire again for a few hours before
heading back to camp, Drum said.</TE>
<TE>   Soule Park in some ways resembles a war camp, he said. Exhausted
firefighters rest at one end, while tactical support teams nearby
plan strategies, checking maps and juggling radio communications from
the fire site a dozen miles north of Ojai.</TE>
<TE>   The state's Incident Management Team sets up such camps when brush
fires rage for more than a few days, said Bill Brickley, the unit's
leader. Complete with kitchens, showers and tents, the camp helps
coordinate firefighters from about nine cities, five counties and
several state agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Help has come from Ventura, Orange, Santa Barbara, Los Angeles and
Kern counties, as well as cities that include Montecito, San Luis
Obispo, Santa Maria, Laverne and Rancho Cucamonga. Crews have also
come from as far away as New Mexico and Montana.</TE>
<TE>   The firefighters braced for gusty winds of up to 25 mph this
weekend. But the same weather pattern should bring cooler
temperatures and higher humidity.</TE>
<TE>   "We're here for the long haul," said McKenzie, surveying his crew
reclining on the grass and munching sandwiches. "We're still fresh
... but this is the beginning of a long season."</TE>
<TE>   Shane Tosse, a firefighter with the Modoc Interagency Hotshot
Crew, came down from Pine Mountain Ridge after pulling a 36-hour
shift.</TE>
<TE>   "This is in steep mountains," said Tosse, explaining what sets the
Ventura County fire apart from other wildfires.</TE>
<TE>   "With the way this fire's burning and how dry it is this season,
we're looking at a rough year," said Tosse, who operates a chain saw
with an elite squad of firefighters trained to battle blazes in
Western back country.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Jones and his five-person crew from the U.S. Forest Service's
firefighting team based at the Angeles National Forest was preparing
to pull out after five days on the front lines.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll sleep tonight and get ready for the next one," said Jones,
of La Habra Heights, as he sat at a picnic table playing cards with
his colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   "This fire's a lot of work and we're not even done yet," said
firefighter Fernando Cardona, of Chino.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a wildfire in northern Los Angeles County was only 10%
contained by nightfall Friday, after charring more than 25,000 acres
of brush and timber and destroying at least seven homes.</TE>
<TE>   The blaze was burning in a northeasterly direction from a
construction site on Copper Hill Road in San Francisquito Canyon,
where a spark from welding equipment apparently touched off the
flames Wednesday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the continued spread of the fire, no serious injuries were
reported and no homes or structures were lost Friday. But residents
prepared for the worst as flames continued to chew up dense brush
near several mountain communities south of the Antelope Valley.</TE>

<HD>Equalize Mental Health Insurance Coverage</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mental illness costs the United States almost $300 billion a year in
criminal justice, social welfare and other services, according to the
National Institutes of Mental Health. The costs in suffering of
individuals and their families are incalculable. The so-called mental
health parity bill would require that health insurers offer equal
payment for the treatment of certain mental illnesses. The measure is
working its way through Congress. RITA LUTHER spoke with an advocate
in the mental health community about the measure.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   RICHARD VAN HORN</LD>
<TE>   President, Los Angeles County Mental Health Assn.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Mental Health Equitable Treatment Act is worthy of our support
because it increases the number of working people who will benefit.
It mandates that businesses with 51 or more employees abide by these
new requirements. The measure applies only to group health plans
already providing mental health benefits. It would not require plans
to offer such benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, the proposed bill would provide parity [with
coverage for physical illnesses] for the number of hospital days and
outpatient treatment sessions for people receiving mental health
treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Having a mental health disorder can be as serious as having a
broken leg or cancer or any other physical illness.</TE>
<TE>   A young man in my family was diagnosed with schizophrenia some
years back. He needed treatment, both hospital and ongoing. However,
he ran up against the limits of his insurance within a month--he had
a not-uncommon lifetime cap of $10,000.</TE>
<TE>   When the $10,000 had been paid out in the initial hospitalization,
it was up to the family, which could ill afford it, to pay out of
pocket until their liquid assets were used up and he could qualify
for Medi-Cal.</TE>
<TE>   This measure would extend full parity to all individuals with a
condition listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders.</TE>
<TE>   This manual is the recognized authority, accepted and routinely
used by the insurance industry and health-care providers alike.</TE>
<TE>   By using the industry standard as our guide, we prevent further
discrimination against the mentally ill, while providing the
insurance companies with reasonable parameters for plan
administration.</TE>
<TE>   While we see this bill as a positive step, we believe more has to
be done to protect people with mental disorders and their families.
Because the public sector programs paid for by state or county
departments of mental health have been more involved with people with
disabling mental illness, they have engaged in a wider variety of
treatments than the hospital or office visit options normally
available to the insured population.</TE>
<TE>   Public systems have been developing integrated-care systems to try
to get people back to normal living in the community.</TE>
<TE>   The public systems have produced better outcomes than many of the
privately funded programs. So, even if the coverage is available, it
is going to take time to expand the treatment options to bring it up
to the level of public programs and to include a new group for
coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Further, we are not sure just what level of care President Bush is
supporting by coming out in favor of the Mental Health Equitable
Treatment Act. There is a rather generalized suspicion in Washington
that he is willing to trade down to a narrower group of covered
disorders.</TE>
<TE>   [The president said that the mentally ill "deserve a health-care
system that treats their illness with the same urgency as a physical
illness." He identified inequity in coverage as one of the major
obstacles to confronting what he termed "the hidden sufferings of
Americans with mental illness."]</TE>
<TE>   There is some fear in the advocacy community that he may bargain
for a narrower bill only covering a short list of the most severe
illnesses that cause people to be disabled.</TE>

<HD>Short-Changed by Self-Service</HD>
<DH>Consumers aren't getting a cut of the cost savings reaped
by retailers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DONALD L. POTTER</AU>
<BD>Donald L. Potter is chief executive of an advertising,
marketing and media agency in the NoHo Arts District.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>American consumers are being shortchanged again. A scarcity of
personal time and a need for instant gratification have created an
apparent willingness to settle for less as long as our consumer
transactions are done quickly. As a result, the better life we expect
from the goods and services we purchase is being dramatically
devalued.</LD>
<LD>   You need go no further than my local supermarket.</LD>
<LD>   Where two checkout stands once stood there are now four
computerized scan and bag-your-own checkout lines. One clerk
supervises these new "express" lanes and, of course, no bagger is
necessary.</LD>
<TE>   Many shoppers are using the new lanes, or trying to use them. But
because the average person has never run a cash register, there are
lots of problems to overcome.</TE>
<TE>   This is taking the self-service concept too far. Especially since
the store offers no discount to shoppers who are taking over the job
of an employee.</TE>
<TE>   How have Americans strayed from making decisions based on
individual wants and needs to being herded into a mass of passive
consumers?</TE>
<TE>   One of the first instances was the gas shortage created by the
1973 Arab oil embargo. Gas prices soared, and to keep costs down,
service stations introduced self-service gas. That meant no washing
of the windows, looking under the hood or checking the air in the
tires.</TE>
<TE>   Pumping our own gas became a way of life, which we accepted
because we believed that it saved us money. Yet less than 30 years
later, fuel prices are near an all-time high. The only savings were
what the station operators realized when they reduced the size of
their work forces.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the automated teller machine. The introduction of this
technology was heralded as a blessing for bank customers. No wait for
tellers, 24-hour availability and more locations were the major
benefits the banks touted.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, they didn't tell us that the inside staff was going to
be cut, which meant less service for those of us who needed more than
a fast $100 in cash. Now we get charged for not having minimum
balances or for writing too many checks. Where was the consumer
outcry?</TE>
<TE>   We can't return to wipe-your-windows service stations or the days
of plentiful, helpful bank tellers. But we can stop the supermarkets
from putting us to work without pay. If we check out and bag our own
groceries, shouldn't there be a discount in the price of the products
we buy?</TE>
<TE>   After all, the club stores provide you with a substantial discount
for buying in bulk, standing in line for an eternity and finding
boxes to pack your stuff in. It's a fair deal. What I encountered at
my local market isn't.</TE>
<TE>   Scanning and packing your own groceries may appear to be
convenient, fun and the wave of the future. But to me it's just one
more service that is being taken away.</TE>

<HD>Spiritual Message Survives Religious Persecution in
'Wondrous' Novel</HD>
<DH>THE TREASURE OF MONTSEGUR: A Novel; By Sophy Burnham;
Harper San Francisco: 276 pp., $23.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ZACHARY KARABELL</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cathars. Albigensians. Heresy. The Inquisition. These words tap into
some murky collective memory of a forgotten time of great violence.</LD>
<LD>   Until a few years ago, the story of the Cathars had been all but
forgotten, save for a few academics who excavated and preserved their
legacy and for the inhabitants of the Languedoc region of France,
where the echo has lingered for centuries.</LD>
<LD>   The people of the area tell folk tales of that time, in the 13th
century, when the "Pure Ones"-- the good Christians, the
Cathars--filled the region until they were hunted down and
slaughtered by rival factions and officers of the Holy Inquisition.</LD>
<TE>   In "The Treasure of Montsegur," Sophy Burnham crafts a beautiful,
wondrous novel out of the persecutions the Cathars faced for their
beliefs. Borrowing from Manicheism, the Cathars viewed the material
world as essentially evil. They abjured meat, practiced celibacy and
claimed that Jesus, though divine, did not die on the cross but was
spirited to southern France, where he lived with his wife, Mary
Magdalene, and their children. They preached God's love, believed in
reincarnation, ordained women and seemed to have been remarkably
nonjudgmental about sin.</TE>
<TE>   In a series of wars waged against them in the 13th century--some
provoked by the church, others by rival feudal lords; some motivated
by theology, others by sheer rapacity--the Cathars were besieged in
their fortresses, tortured by inquisitors and annihilated. The
protagonist of Burnham's novel is the lone survivor of the massacre
of the Cathars of the fortress-town of Montsegur. The story is told
partly in flashback and opens with the middle-aged Jeanne living as a
beggar, haunted by memories of the death of her loved ones. The
Cathars were divided into the perfecti (much like Catholic monks and
nuns who sacrifice married life) and laypeople like Jeanne, who
married and had affairs, raised children, and fought against the
Catholic clergy and those nobles allied with them.</TE>
<TE>   Though taught by the perfecti, Jeanne was never one of them, and
her life was peppered with loveless marriages, one torrid affair and
underground work for "The Cause." The novel dances back and forth
between her present and past, moving gently but ominously forward to
the culmination of her life, when Montsegur was captured, and later
to what she faced at the hands of the inquisitors. Though the story
itself is tragic, we are left not with a sense of futility, but with
the pain of beauty and love and their all-too-frequent destruction.</TE>
<TE>   After the massacre, Jeanne the beggar is taken in by a kind
peasant named Jerome, who teases out her story and that of the
"treasure of Montsegur." He is drawn to her and enraged by the moral
dilemma she poses. He was "a simple farmer. What did he know of
politics? Or ethics, right and wrong? Or wars of the religious?"</TE>
<TE>   Unsure of what he should do, he inadvertently becomes her undoing,
not because he betrays her secret, but because his neighbors accuse
her of being a witch after she assists in a birth that leads to the
mother's death.</TE>
<TE>   Arrested and tortured, Jeanne finds through that suffering the
redemption that had eluded her. In prison, she finally embraces the
message of love that she had heard since she was a child. "I
understood that there is no evil. No Satan.... Only Love. And what
seems bad appears so only as a result of ignorance. What seems good
carries no more weight than the bad, for in the eyes of God, there is
only Yes! I AM!"</TE>
<TE>   This is the message of mystics from time immemorial, that God is
everything and everywhere, all names and nameless, and that only
human limitations keep us from recognizing that.</TE>
<TE>   Burnham weaves nimbly between real and surreal, between magic and
mundane. She plays with the question of whether the "treasure" is the
gold of the Cathars or the Cathars themselves, but in the end, the
answer is clear: The material treasure can be lost or squandered, but
the spiritual message survives through the centuries, overwhelmed and
abused, but never extinguished.</TE>

<HD>Dreaming of a Greener L.A.</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Years ago it seemed an impossible dream: to hike from Will Rogers
Park in Pacific Palisades all the way to Point Mugu State Park in
Ventura County. When Congress created the Santa Monica Mountains
National Recreation Area in 1978, the park was little more than
hopeful green lines superimposed over a map dotted with large tracts
of private property and hillside homes. Now the 60-mile Backbone
Trail through the park is a reality, and local parkland visionaries
are focusing on a new dream, Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn's goal
of a park within walking distance of every city resident. That may be
a harder trick than constructing the Backbone Trail.</LD>
<LD>   Thanks for the trail goes to platoons of hot, sweaty trail diggers
who, over the years, have cleared the snaking path on steep
mountainsides. Thanks, also, to those who toiled in the halls of
government, shaking loose money for property purchases and crucial
rights of way. With the last six miles or so to be completed in the
next few years, hikers can tramp through seemingly remote wilderness
just a short drive from busy city streets.</LD>
<TE>   Now, another dream arises: to provide decent recreational space
where people live. Professor Jennifer Wolch and her colleagues at
USC's Sustainable Cities Program use a series of maps to graphically
illustrate just how little space there is to kick a soccer ball, dig
in a sandbox or just lie in the grass, particularly in the poorest,
densest parts of town.</TE>
<TE>   It's old news, of course, that Los Angeles has less parkland per
resident than most other major cities. Even more troubling is the
distribution of parks. In the city's central and Eastside
neighborhoods, Wolch found that less than one-third of the population
lives within a quarter-mile of a park, and nearly 73% of
children--many in apartments with no yards--have no play space
nearby.</TE>
<TE>   But there are hopeful signs. Hahn announced last month that the
city has joined with the nonprofit Trust for Public Land to identify
bits of ignored land that public agencies and nonprofit groups could
turn into parks. Abandoned lots and even trashed-up alleys could
qualify.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, a group of city officials and local advocates is
working on an urban land trust that could develop and manage the new
patches of green. The trust concept has worked well in Baltimore,
Chicago and other cities. Finally, the city and the Los Angeles
Unified School District are designing new schools so that neighbors
would be able to use the new athletic fields, gyms and auditoriums in
off-hours.</TE>
<TE>   This burst of creative thinking could turn green dreams into
reality. It worked for the "impossible" Backbone Trail. It can work
in Los Angeles.</TE>

<LD>More fears seem to float about these days--some serious, some
superficial, some founded, others not. But the collective national
impact is a sense of uncertainty, an uneasy mental summer haze that
keeps us from seeing as far as we'd like.</LD>
<LD>   It's not 1929, but stock market investors see mounting
irregularities and wonder what to believe. So they exit the market,
which frightens others, who exit too or stay away. Not that many of
us swapped kilowatt-hours with distant power systems, but the Enron
sham and Andersen shredding cause us to doubt once-trusted systems.
Wall Street analysts advise investors about stocks they, too, hold;
guess what, they advise buying them. Outrageous earnings packages for
unsuccessful executives make lucrative free agency for pitchers with
8-14 records seem downright parsimonious. Like spotting Titanic
officers donning life jackets, finding out that corporate executives
have been selling their own firm's stock doesn't inspire tons of
confidence.</LD>
<TE>   Whatever happened to the hunt for the Mr. Bigs of terrorism
overseas? Now, predictably, Washington's perennial players hunt each
other, leaking daily dirt and offering the latest I-told-you-so memo
about 9/11 warning signs. The CIA and FBI, those dark-suited folks
who were to protect us, now seem to have been secretly not talking to
each other and not protecting anything but their bureaucratic
behinds--not an ideal symbol of team spirit.</TE>
<TE>   We have movies called "Panic Room," "Unfaithful" and "The Sum of
All Fears." Even the Star Wars Republic is under attack, again, from
evil forces. Our mayor can be invisible, an integral valley may want
out, and the Lakers for a while looked shaky against Sacramento.
What's still going up are real estate prices, which is only fine if
you're selling.</TE>
<TE>   Look, here's what's happened: As a nation and a people we took
body blows last fall. They hurt. We saw assumptions--about tall
buildings, about security, about evil people, about coming home from
work--pulverized into dust and ugly black smoke visible from space.
It makes you wonder--for a while anyway--what other assumptions could
crumble. Who's at fault? Whom to suspect now? That's how terrorism
corrodes spirits from within, moving from a noisy fear to quiet
twinges of personal doubt, then waves of public suspicions way beyond
evidence or reality.</TE>
<TE>   Here's what we need: an effective prosecution of the battle
against terror's infrastructure. A thorough, professional
investigation of the pre-9/11 follies. (Is it too much to expect
officials to seek election-year advantage by doing a good job instead
of clever leaking?) Vigorous federal involvement to restore
confidence by ensuring the stock market and financial reporting are
fair and accurate. And, most important, occasional deep breaths by
individual Americans whenever they sense that unease rising in the
throat. This new war is different. It'll be fought by armed forces.
But it will be won--or lost--in the good hearts and patient minds of
civilians at home. That's us.</TE>

<LD>Drive 50 miles from downtown Los Angeles on most major roads or
freeways and you'll spend an hour--or two or three--immersed in the
monotonous, big-box exurban ugliness that has replaced the orange
groves and chaparral-covered hills of just a few decades back.</LD>
<LD>   City and county general plans should have been the keys to more
sensible growth in California. The plans specify where developers can
erect Wal-Marts or apartment buildings, where cities put libraries
and where school districts build high schools. Ideally, they contain
sprawl, create communities where people can walk to the grocery store
and provide adequate services for residents. Most plans, however,
fail on all counts.</LD>
<LD>   County supervisors and city council members resist any attempt by
the state to infringe on their power to play red light-green light
with new Costcos, auto malls and look-alike housing tracts.</LD>
<TE>   Even when communities draw up sensible growth plans to guide their
elected representatives and the bureaucrats they appoint, developers
and business interests often cajole their way to exemptions.</TE>
<TE>   Today, some smart communities have endorsed "smart" growth, as
opposed to the old no- or slow-growth strategies. But most California
communities still suffer from thoughtless growth or just plain dumb
growth.</TE>
<TE>   That would change if the Legislature approved Senate Bill 1521 by
Sen. Sheila Kuehl (D-Santa Monica), a measure sponsored by the Davis
administration to modestly toughen the state's hand in guiding how
cities and counties grow. The measure passed the Senate in late May.
It awaits an Assembly hearing.</TE>
<TE>   The building industry and real estate interests oppose the bill
and local governments have balked, complaining that what might be
good for San Diego would not necessarily work in Fresno or along the
Central Coast.</TE>
<TE>   As watered down to assuage these forces, SB 1521 merely requires
the state to offer, at the start of 2004, a model of "planning
practices and policies" that promote walkable neighborhoods, public
transit, the redevelopment of inner cities and old suburbs,
protection of open space and farmland, and housing for all income
groups.</TE>
<TE>   Soft as the bill is now, local governments want it even weaker.
This is shortsighted. California is expected to grow by 24 million
residents in the next 40 years. Which leads to a paradox: If the
state continues to let influential builders bulldoze what's left of
the landscape for endlessly sprawling subdivisions and the copycat
shopping centers, mini-malls and gridlocked freeways to serve them,
who'll want to live here?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "To Feed World's People, Modern Practices Must Supplant Organic
Fads," Commentary, June 4: Jim Wells' touting of modern farming
practices as a fix for world hunger conveniently excludes two
critical issues: 1) the potential consequences that will eventually
result from giant agribusinesses' introduction of hundreds of
millions of acres of untested, voluntarily regulated, mutant
transgenic organisms (often falsely referred to as "genetically
engineered food") into our already fragile ecosystem; and 2) the
attempt to force farmers into what amounts to indentured
servitude--raising and harvesting patented mutants for the corporate
bottom line while being prohibited from saving seeds for next year's
planting, a 10,000-year-old practice that's responsible for the
majority of fruits and vegetables consumed today.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, the products resulting from our "modern" farm practices
(which, so far, have not been engineered for taste, nutrition or
longevity but only to either resist the pesticides the patent holder
sells or to overproduce inherent, natural pesticides) have been
rejected by the European Union, Japan, China and many African
countries, among others.</LD>
<LD>   Highlighting the challenges of organic farming is one thing, but
to imply that global agri-conglomerates are benevolently striving to
end world hunger redefines the word "naive."</LD>
<TE>   Frank Allen</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The dictionary defines the word "fad" as a temporary, popular
manner of conduct, enthusiastically followed by a group. Modern
agriculture more likely fits the description of fad than organic
farming, which has been around for thousands of years. The soil
renews itself with organic farming practices, not with the use of
pesticides and herbicides--which grow exponentially with the immunity
of the critters and weeds they are supposed to eradicate or hold in
check. Nature's laws don't change--only our understanding of them.</TE>
<TE>   Saran Kirschbaum</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wells is looking ahead to 2050, when we have 9 billion mouths to
feed, and he has come to the sensible conclusion that the only way
we'll be able to feed 'em all is to forgo organic farming in favor of
conventional farming--otherwise we'd have to convert wildlife habitat
into cropland.</TE>
<TE>   But Jim, what happens then? After we've fed 9 billion people and
they've all had kids--then what? Then we'll have 12 billion mouths to
feed, and when we feed them, we'll have 16 billion mouths to feed,
and on and on.</TE>
<TE>   Our arable lands will shrink and become increasingly less
productive, human population will encroach into more and more wild
lands, and eventually billions upon billions of us will starve
because the planet will no longer be able to support us all.</TE>
<TE>   More food is not the answer. It would be much smarter to start
decreasing crop production. We could bring our population to more
sustainable levels, give our overstrained topsoils some chance at
recovery and reduce famine's eventual toll exponentially.</TE>

<LD>In your June 4, front-page obituary on Lew Wasserman you mention that
"he was active in the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles." This is accurate
but understates his important role in the bid for the Games and the
Games themselves. There was a lot of Wasserman in the Games of the
XXIII Olympiad.</LD>
<LD>   He also served as director and chairman of the investment
committee of the Amateur Athletic Foundation, which received 40% of
the profits of the '84 Games. To date, the AAF has given away more
than $100 million to youth sports in Southern California and has an
endowment of $150 million for the future. Wasserman didn't just lend
his name (which was formidable) to the Olympics. He actively worked
for the '84 Games and then the AAF.</LD>

<HD>Nurse Shortage Hurts All</HD>

<LD>Jimmy Margulies' cartoon on the nurse shortage was right on
(Commentary, June 3). However, I would change the equation to read
"Patient Overload = Nurse Shortage." Nurses should not have to
strike, battle for legislation and stage walkouts for hospitals to
provide safe nurse-patient ratios and decent pay.</LD>
<LD>   The current shortage of RNs is not new. Hospital administrations
have been ignoring the pleas of overworked nurses for a number of
years. I still have the worksheet from one of my last days on the
medical/surgical floor of a local hospital. My assignment was eight
very ill patients. I retired early. It was too emotionally stressful.</LD>

<TE>   Hospital administrators have treated RNs shamefully for years.</TE>
<TE>   In 1978 we organized a trauma center in our small hospital in
Mission Viejo. Because of geography, we thought it important to
provide this service even though the demands on our time would be
heavy.</TE>
<TE>   The hospital employees, in particular the nurses, responded
enthusiastically and soon we were highly rated statewide in spite of
our small size. Trauma nurses (cross-trained in the ICU, ER and
operating room) were on call, responding within 15 minutes from home,
since the hospital could not afford to keep staff on hand. Operating
room nurses were also on call around the clock.</TE>
<TE>   After 10 years of success and growing volume, the hospital
administrator announced at a surgery department meeting that he was
cutting out the incentive pay (a couple of dollars per hour) we had
established for the on-call staff.</TE>
<TE>   We protested that we had a successful system with highly motivated
and experienced staff. He retorted that they had been "getting away
with" too much and he was going to end this "favoritism." I told him
that he would lose dedicated staff who might resent his attitude. I
asked him to report to us in a year how much this new policy was
costing in nurse registry fees.</TE>
<TE>   Within the next year, more than a dozen experienced staff members
had left the operating room. It is now heavily staffed with
"traveling" and registry nurses, at higher pay than the permanent
nurses, and new-graduate nurses. The trauma center still does well,
but the esprit de corps declined and the costs went up, not down.</TE>
<TE>   This scenario has been repeated all over the country as
shortsighted administrators have been penny-wise and pound foolish
with nurse retention.</TE>

<HD>Supreme Court Tries Disabled Americans</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thank you, Charles Lindner, for exposing the hatchet job that the
U.S. Supreme Court has been doing on the rights of Americans with
disabilities ("Supreme Court Upsetting a Rights Movement," Opinion,
June 2). If the court were to erode civil rights protections based on
race or gender discrimination, there would be a great outcry. Sadly,
although disabilityrights advocates are very much aware of what the
court has been doing, few others seem to be very concerned.</LD>
<LD>   Disability is a natural part of life. At some point, the vast
majority of Americans will experience it. If you care about your own
civil rights, you should be paying close attention to what the court
is doing to ours. By the time you develop a disability it may be too
late.</LD>
<LD>   Laura Remson Mitchell</LD>
<TE>   Winnetka</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lindner said, "If the court did to the 1964 Civil Rights Act what
it has done to the 1990 Americans With Disabilities Act, blacks would
be living again in pre-1954 America: separate and unequal,
undereducated and underemployed." Several recent stories have said
that the U.S. was more segregated in the '90s than it was in the
'60s. The 2002 Time Almanac gives these figures: Life expectancy:
white, 77.3 years; black 71.4. Household median income: white,
$42,504; black, $27,910. High school dropout rate: white, 7.3%;
black, 12.6%. College graduation rate: white, 25.9%; black, 15.4%.
Average unemployment rate in 2000: white, 3.5%; black, 7.6%. Similar
figures are widely available and not seriously disputed.</TE>
<TE>   In net, then, Lindner is hopelessly optimistic about the power of
the Supreme Court to change things. It will take far more than a
friendly court to change the even more negative figures about
handicaps. All the Americans With Disabilities Act amounts to is a
full-employment act for lawyers. The Supreme Court is to be praised
for insisting a little common sense be allowed.</TE>
<TE>   David Carl Argall</TE>
<TE>   La Puente</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It has been 13 years since the ADA was passed, and in that time
this civil rights law has become a litigious law. The fact is that
this is an inaccessible society that has been slow to accept that
people with disabilities have rights too, especially when it involves
money.</TE>
<TE>   The difference between this and Brown vs. Board of Education and
other civil rights decisions is that the rights the ADA secures cost
money. Access isn't cheap, yet is there a price on liberty and
freedom? According to the Supreme Court, there is. These restrictions
on the ADA show that even the most intelligent citizens of our
country are ignorant of disability.</TE>

<LD>On May 28 my 76-year-old mother-in-law flew into LAX intending to
visit my wife and me for a month. When she went through customs they
discovered that in 1997 she had visited this country and overstayed
her 90-day allotted time limit. My wife had major surgery that year
and I, not knowing her mother would be violating any law, suggested
that she stay a little longer. She stayed four months.</LD>
<LD>   In 2001 she came to visit and stayed four weeks. However, this
year they discovered this INS violation and wouldn't allow her into
the country. She has a valid German passport, and she had a
round-trip ticket. But the INS felt compelled to detain her at LAX
for almost 24 hours, under guard. Then two guards escorted her onto a
plane to Europe.</LD>
<LD>   This kind of rigid and inflexible treatment of an elderly woman
with a passport, a return ticket, family in this country and money in
her pocket seems to me to be a silly exercise of officious
bureaucracy. When we have millions of illegal aliens running loose in
this country, some of them committing serious crimes, why is the INS
wasting valuable man-hours on grannies from Europe?</LD>

<HD>Valley City Will Still Be Large</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Does professor Shirley Svorny ("When It Comes to Cities, Smaller Is
Better," Commentary, June 3) really equate a city of more than 1
million with studies of "smaller cities"? Does she really believe
that a city of more than 1 million will have no "special interests"?
Get real. The Valley will simply be another large city with all the
disadvantages thereof and without the advantages of a world-class
city.</LD>
<LD>   It is unlikely that the current level of emergency medical service
or fire protection can be sustained in a Valley city or the remainder
of Los Angeles without an increase in taxes. Does Svorny believe that
when brush fires sweep across Northridge, Tarzana, Chatsworth or
Woodland Hills, those responding all come from Valley fire stations?
A very high percentage of fire companies working any large brush fire
come from Central L.A., South-Central L.A., West L.A., Venice and
other areas. She will also find that fire companies from "the other
L.A." spend far more time in the Valley than Valley companies spend
there.</LD>
<LD>   Further, it is unlikely that the Valley city will be able to
afford the Fire Department helicopter service that provides fire
protection and air ambulance service for the Valley. I cannot imagine
how Svorny believes that putting control of emergency services at a
council district level will do anything but provide less
cost-effective services.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   According to Svorny's reasoning, Compton would be model city, but,
alas, as has been well documented, it is not. I am sure that in
smaller cities, people are generally more involved. The problem with
her argument is that the cities in the studies probably are true,
small "home-grown" cities that have an identity, not ones
artificially cut from a larger entity.</TE>
<TE>   This use, or more correctly misuse, of facts is what I find so
frustrating by those on both sides of the question. The people of Los
Angeles deserve some honest and non-sensational arguments for and
against the secession of all the possible new cities. Neither "The
loud sucking noise you hear is the sound of your money being stolen
by downtown" nor "If you vote to secede, your taxes are going to
skyrocket" qualifies as a good argument. In fact, I find such
blathering offensive and wish that both sides would start acting and
speaking in a manner that befits such a large decision.</TE>
<TE>   Joan A. Maggs</TE>
<TE>   Granada Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The controversy between the Daily News, which favors secession,
and The Times, which is against, offers the public a chance to
evaluate the best course of action ("The Times Faulted for
Downplaying Secession," May 31). To me, the issue is, how do we elect
politicians who will fairly represent all of the city? Los Angeles
used to be a good place to live. No more. The voting public has long
ignored local issues, so that a small group of activists now runs
government, each one with his or her own following and objectives.
They have packed city government with people who are at best arrogant
and unresponsive.</TE>
<TE>   This is what has led to the secession movement. I want to know how
secession will provide better government. My Los Angeles City Council
member, Dennis Zine, has already established himself as one of the
undesirable city politicians. He has declared that if secession
happens, he will run for the new City Council. Given the power of
name recognition, he would probably win the seat. So how are we
ahead? If those who support secession can come up with a plan to
attract better people, I will vote for secession.</TE>

<TE>   I winced at Proposition 13 being described as "populism" in Bill
Boyarsky's "The Jarvis Effect" (Opinion, June 2). Populists fought
against the control of government by big-money business interests,
not against taxes to provide social services. In the 1890s the
Populist Party suggested income taxes--graduated, of course.</TE>
<TE>   Boyarsky describes the impetus for Proposition 13 quite well but
fails to mention its results: underfunded educational, medical and
recreational facilities. The decaying buildings, lack of textbooks
and crowded classrooms of the LAUSD are as much the harvest of
Proposition 13 as the result of managerial ineptitude. The horrifying
near-closure of dozens of public libraries in 1994 due to a lack of
funding is likewise forgotten.</TE>
<TE>   Boyarsky describes Proposition 13 as having "forever limited the
growth of government." I would argue that if my wages were stagnant,
the "growth" of my family would not be limited. However, it would be
less furnished with basic services and our standard of living would
decline.</TE>

<HD>FBI Looks Into the Face of Terror</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite tough competition, Robert Scheer's June 4 commentary, "We've
Had Enough Witch Hunts," is probably his most absurd yet. Scheer is
contradicting himself and overlooking the obvious. He points out,
correctly, that there were huge mistakes made by the FBI and CIA
during the last few years which, if not made, might have prevented
the nightmare of Sept. 11. But the biggest of those mistakes was an
unwillingness to engage in the racial profiling of Middle Eastern
men, as at least one FBI official has already admitted. Scheer now
wants the FBI, and everyone else, to continue making the same
mistake, in defiance of common sense and experience.</LD>
<LD>   There is not one speck of evidence that the terrorists who are
trying to destroy Western civilization are anyone other than Middle
Eastern men who profess the Islamic faith. And there is nothing wrong
with having a "witch hunt" when the witches actually exist.</LD>
<LD>   Marc Russell</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The selectively myopic Scheer opines that President Bush's Cabinet
"went the first eight months of his administration without discussing
terrorist threats." He failed to note whether the "former White House
officials" cited how many times the Bush National Security Council
discussed the threat of terrorism. Nor did he mention at how many
Cabinet meetings during Bill Clinton's eight years as president was
the threat of terrorism considered. It's a sad commentary that
Clinton only communicated with his FBI director, Louis Freeh, through
his attorney general, Janet Reno.</TE>
<TE>   Clinton completely ignored the substantive report of his own vice
president--the Gore commission report on aviation safety and
security, released Feb. 12, 1997. And even more significantly, the
Clinton administration paid faint attention to the bipartisan report
of former Sens. Gary Hart (D-Colo.) and Warren Rudman (R-N.H.),
released in September 1999. The contention that, but for the
indifference and incompetence of the Bush administration before Sept.
11, the incredible tragedy could have been prevented, hits a new low,
even for Scheer.</TE>

<TE>   Re "FBI Given Broad Authority to Monitor Public Activities," May
31: Now that the Justice Department has given the green light for FBI
agents to infiltrate mosques for intelligence-gathering purposes, we
Muslims in America are faced with the choice of several responses.
The first would be to resign ourselves to the situation; we could
place banners in our houses of worship stating "Welcome FBI
Brothers."</TE>
<TE>   A second option would be to grow in distrust of each other,
further eroding an already divided Muslim community (which, I
conjecture, is part of the plan).</TE>
<TE>   A third option, which is my favorite, is to strive to become the
best Muslims we can be through study and the performance of good
works. Americans of goodwill would recognize our efforts and support
us; Americans of intolerance would still hate us, but at least we
will have deserved their respect.</TE>

<TE>   It's no coincidence that the Department of Justice unveiled the
FBI's new, expanded powers on the same day the nation mourned the
victims of Sept. 11 and marked the termination of the ground zero
cleanup project. Although the FBI had plenty of information before
Sept. 11 to predict the attacks, it is now being given wide latitude
to spy on all of us, in order to cover up its own incompetence in
failing to properly analyze the data it already had.</TE>

witches, we should hunt and ferret them out.</TE>

<HD>Reducing Homelessness Is a Top CRA Priority</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Skid Rowers Don't Deserve the Boot," by Alice Callaghan,
Commentary, May 31: The City Center Redevelopment Plan was not
developed in a vacuum. Community Redevelopment Agency staff consulted
extensively with an elected project area committee and numerous
organizations: the Midnight Mission, SRO Housing Corp., Skid Row
Housing Trust, L.A. Coalition to End Hunger and Homelessness and the
L.A. Homeless Services Authority. Representatives from these and 10
other organizations met twice a month for six months to develop the
plan. Callaghan chose not to participate.</LD>
<LD>   A top priority of the CRA plan is to reduce homelessness. More
than $150 million is allocated for homelessness-reduction services.
Also, 13,000 new housing units will be developed, 25% devoted to low-
and very-low-income housing.</LD>
<LD>   The CRA plan creates new housing through conversion of existing
vacant buildings, older major hotels and other misused structures.
Families living in hotels are not in the same situation as
individuals living on the streets or in the single-room-occupancy
buildings in skid row. The CRA will continue to retain and
rehabilitate SRO units--nearly 3,000 units have already been
rehabilitated. Working-poor families living in crowded hotel rooms
are better served by housing designed for families.</LD>
<TE>   None of these homeless benefits can happen without the CRA plan.</TE>

<TE>   Here on skid row, sidewalks are clogged with the bodies of
homeless men and women sleeping in tents and cardboard cartons. Many
think they are here because they are lazy and shiftless; others say
they are drug addicts or criminals.</TE>
<TE>   Callaghan's commentary clarifies the truth: They are here as a
direct result of this city's redevelopment policy, which, over the
years, has slipped billions of tax dollars into the pockets of rich
developers while systematically stripping the urban core of its
lowest-cost housing--SROs.</TE>

<TE>   Downtown is the center of our city and should not be used as a
repository for crack addicts, drunks, newly released convicts and
mental patients sleeping, loitering and defecating on our sidewalks.
The people of L.A. have a right to enjoy their downtown area.</TE>
<TE>   I believe we should close all the "rescue" missions and free
housing and do whatever it takes to clean this area up. There is
nothing moral about the current situation. Not to the citizens who
would love to have a vibrant, clean and safe city center or to the
hapless poor people who are abandoned to filthy, unsafe streets to
sleep in cardboard boxes.</TE>

<LD>Recently my niece attended a meeting to explore the possibility of
being married at the new Roman Catholic Cathedral in Los Angeles. All
in attendance were told that the fees for the Mass at the cathedral
would be $1,500 with an additional $175 for the organist and $250 for
the mandatory wedding coordinator. In addition, she may be required
to pay $7 per car to park at the cathedral. Total cathedral charges:
$1,925, plus parking. Comparable charges at her parish total $370,
with no fee for parking.</LD>
<LD>   My niece understands that the Mass is the most important part of
the wedding celebration. What we do not comprehend is why the church
is not doing all in its power to encourage marriages at the
cathedral--and not merely marriages among the wealthy. The
archdiocese has hired a very expensive public relations firm to
coordinate the spin on the pedophilia scandal (May 30). One wonders
how much of the $1,925-plus paid by each couple will be spent not on
ministry but on a PR firm.</LD>

<HD>Martin Aronstein, 65; Noted Theatrical Lighting Designer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Theatrical lighting designer Martin Aronstein, a five-time Tony
nominee and one of the outstanding designers in Los Angeles theater,
died of heart failure May 3 at Valley Presbyterian Hospital in Van
Nuys. He was 65.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Pittsfield, Mass., and raised in New York, Aronstein began
working for the New York Shakespeare Festival soon after leaving
Queens College in the late 1950s. He remained affiliated with the
organization until 1977.</LD>
<LD>   He began designing for Broadway in 1963, with "The Milk Train
Doesn't Stop Here Anymore," and acquired more than 100 Broadway
credits, including "Forty Carats," "Cactus Flower," "Tiny Alice,"
"Promises, Promises" and "Play It Again, Sam." His work on "The Royal
Hunt of the Sun" was credited as the first Broadway design to use
exposed lighting as an integral part of the production.</LD>
<TE>   Aronstein received Tony Award nominations in three successive
years: for "Ain't Supposed to Die a Natural Death" in 1972, "Much Ado
About Nothing" in 1973 and "In the Boom Boom Room" in 1974. He was
nominated twice more for Tonys, for "Medea" in 1982 and "Wild Honey"
in 1987, which originated at the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Aronstein moved to Sherman Oaks in 1977.</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California, he worked at the Ahmanson, the Mark Taper
Forum, the Pasadena Playhouse and the Tiffany Theaters and for McCoy
Rigby Entertainment, whose Aronstein-lighted "Peter Pan" at the La
Mirada Theatre went on to Broadway.</TE>
<TE>   "He could take something so plain and make it magical," said Cathy
Rigby, the "Peter Pan" star. Underneath his "gruff and crotchety"
exterior, she said, "he was incredibly soft-hearted and loyal."</TE>
<TE>   Scenic designer John Iacovelli said Aronstein "could do so much
with so little. Some shows use thousands of lights. On 'Peter Pan,'
he used 150--to amazing effect. He showed me it doesn't take much to
evoke a moment or a mood. That's why producers loved him."</TE>
<TE>   Aronstein won Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Awards in 1983 for
the Taper's "A Month in the Country" and in 1984 for the same
theater's "Passion Play." In 1996, he won the circle's Angstrom Award
for career achievement in lighting.</TE>
<TE>   Aronstein's work outside New York and Los Angeles included 30
shows at the Kennedy Center in Washington and serving the last 10
seasons as resident lighting designer at the 12,000-seat St. Louis
Muny.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his partner, Larry Metzler.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service will be held June 30 at 11 a.m. at the Taper.</TE>

<HD>Southern Baptists to Choose New Leader</HD>

<LD>Southern Baptists will gather in St. Louis for their annual meeting
Tuesday and Wednesday to select a new president and make plans for
initiatives related to the family and evangelism.</LD>
<LD>   The only announced nominee to lead the 16-million-member religion
is Jack Graham, pastor of Prestonwood Baptist Church in Plano, Texas,
a suburb of Dallas. If elected, he would succeed James Merritt, a
pastor from Snellville, Ga., who has served two one-year terms as
president of the nation's largest Protestant denomination.</LD>
<LD>   Between 10,000 and 15,000 delegates are expected to attend, said
Bill Merrell, spokesman for the Southern Baptist Convention Executive
Committee.</LD>
<TE>   They will hear of a new initiative called "Empowering Kingdom
Growth," which will involve a focus on "the vision of God for the
whole world," Merrell said. It will call Baptists to personal
holiness and include evangelism and other efforts to work with
like-minded Christians.</TE>
<TE>   "The aim of it ... is to help us lift our eyes up so we're not
just looking at our church or our own denomination, but at what God
is doing in the world," Merrell said.</TE>
<TE>   They also will be updated on the work of the Council on Family
Life, which hopes to counter increasing rates of divorce.</TE>
<TE>   As at other recent conventions, Soulforce, an interdenominational
pro-gay group, plans a demonstration to highlight criticisms of gays
by Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore, a Southern Baptist known for his
support of posting the Ten Commandments in courtrooms.</TE>
<TE>   The group would like Merritt to address them outside the
convention hall, but Merrell said that's unlikely. He said Southern
Baptists in general do not agree with Soulforce's stances.</TE>
<TE>   "We regret that people such as those in Soulforce have so far
departed from the teachings of Scripture that they have called
blessed what God calls cursed and an abomination," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Resolutions Committee Chairman Frank Harber, a pastor from
Colleyville, Texas, said proposed resolutions that may be considered
at the meeting include several on the Middle East and one supporting
Sept. 11 rescue workers.</TE>
<TE>   The Southern Baptists expect to hear from a range of well-known
evangelicals, including Christian aid workers Heather Mercer and
Dayna Curry, who were imprisoned last year in Afghanistan, and Campus
Crusade for Christ founder Bill Bright.</TE>
<TE>   As for complaints, officials of the denomination say they're
comfortable with their policies and believe most Southern Baptists
are too.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A 26-year-old Sylmar man was sentenced Friday to 50 years to life in
prison for fatally shooting his girlfriend more than two years ago
after she insulted him.</LD>
<LD>   Jose Alfredo Barajas was convicted on March 7 of first-degree
murder after shooting his live-in girlfriend, Lisa Lopez, 20, four
times with a .45-caliber handgun as she lay on a couch in the living
room of their home in the 12800 block of Maclay Street, authorities
said.</LD>
<LD>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Carolyn McNary said Lopez and Barajas were
arguing on Jan. 9, 2000, when Lopez called him insulting names.</LD>
<TE>   He became angry and shot her, McNary said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said Barajas called 911 to report that he had shot his
girlfriend.</TE>
<TE>   When police arrived, he was holding a handgun and baiting them to
shoot him, authorities said. He was subdued after police shot him
with a beanbag.</TE>
<TE>   During the trial, Lopez's co-workers testified that Barajas was
controlling and called her frequently to try to get her to come home.
Their relationship was not violent, McNary said, but there "was a lot
of yelling between them."</TE>
<TE>   On at least one other occasion, in November 1999, Barajas went
after Lopez with a gun, but she was able to leave, McNary said.</TE>

<HD>Tenants Sought to Help Build Tanker Terminal</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Port officials are looking for prospective tenants who could help
build a deepwater terminal that would allow some of the world's
largest oil tankers to dock there, officials announced Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The Port of Long Beach plans to build and lease a 5-acre facility
that would be developed just south of the Fremont Forest lumber
terminal and the BP oil terminal, officials said. The new facility
would be used mostly for receiving crude oil and other petroleum
products, and would include a 76-foot-deep docking berth for tankers.</LD>
<LD>   The facility would allow ships as big as 320,000 tons to dock
there, officials said. Port officials are looking for a tenant who
would build the loading and unloading equipment and other structures,
including pipelines leading to off-site storage areas. Applications
must be submitted by July 17. Call properties director Hal Duensing
at (562) 590-4162.</LD>

<LD>A Superior Court judge threw out a $4.35-million verdict Friday for a
Palisades High School teacher who accused the Los Angeles Unified
School District of allowing students to publish a newspaper
portraying her as a porn star.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Kenneth Freeman granted the district's motion for a new
trial, calling the award excessive and citing trial errors in
admitting evidence and giving jury instructions, said district
general counsel Hal Kwalwasser.</LD>
<LD>   Former teacher Janis Adams took a leave of absence and sued the
district claiming sexual harassment after 10 issues of the
underground newspaper were published.</LD>

<LD>Fewer sickened sea creatures are turning up along the Southern
California coast, indicating the threat from a toxic algae bloom may
have eased in the last week, according to marine wildlife
rehabilitation centers.</LD>
<LD>   Dolphins and California brown pelicans have been falling victim to
an outbreak of poisonous plankton since the beginning of spring.</LD>
<LD>   At least 70 dolphins died and 250 sea lions were sickened by
eating anchovies, other small fish and shellfish such as crabs that
fed on the plankton.</LD>
<TE>   No one knows the reason for the proliferation of the plankton,
which is naturally packed with a toxin called domoic acid. In the
most severe cases, it causes seizures and respiratory arrest.</TE>

<LD>Nine people, including four children, were treated for smoke
inhalation and 70 others were displaced after a residential hotel
fire Friday morning, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   None of the injuries were life threatening, said Los Angeles
County Fire Inspector Mike Brown. The fire broke out about 5:45 a.m.
at the three-story Executive Inn at 1030 W. El Segundo Blvd., and was
caused by electrical problems with a television set, Brown said.</LD>
<LD>   Only three of the hotel's 68 rooms suffered major damage, he said.
The Red Cross set up temporary shelter at a gym for those displaced.
The fire, which was extinguished in about an hour, caused about
$100,000 in damage, Brown said.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A landlord and her son were ordered Friday to stand trial for murder
in the arson death of a 72-year-old double amputee in their care,
prosecutors said.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Suzanne Person ruled that there
was enough evidence to force Clemetha Marie Dillard, 76, and Anthony
Dillard, 52, to undergo a trial in the death of Joe Williams.</LD>
<LD>   On Nov. 28, firefighters found his body after extinguishing a
blaze at the home in the 2400 block of South Cochran Avenue. Arson
investigators aided by a dog detected flammable liquids in several
areas of the razed home, police said.</LD>
<TE>   Detectives said money and fraud may have been motives for the
killing. The Dillards are charged with arson and murder with special
circumstances, which could make them eligible for the death penalty,
prosecutors said. They are expected to be arraigned June 21.</TE>

<HD>San Diego Moves to Keep Chargers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Slowly, San Diego officials are rising to the challenge of preventing
the Chargers football team from moving to Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Though public opinion is still tilted against building a new
stadium for the team, officials are moving to block efforts at a
Chargers-to-Los Angeles relocation that appeared to be at full speed
just a few weeks ago.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday, the city attorney sent a letter to the group headed
by Philip Anschutz, the billionaire who wants to build a stadium near
Staples Center in Los Angeles. Behind the lawyerly language was a
threat from the mayor and City Council: Tinker with San Diego's
contract with the Chargers and expect a lawsuit.</LD>
<TE>   And on Friday, Mayor Dick Murphy announced the formation of a task
force to ponder how the city can keep the NFL team without unduly
raiding the civic treasury.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a good signal to the Chargers that San Diego is getting
its act together," said lawyer and civic activist Michael Aguirre,
who had criticized the mayor for passivity.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor, Aguirre said, "is getting back to the old Dick Murphy
that we elected."</TE>
<TE>   Murphy suggested during the 2000 election that, if elected, he
might sue the Chargers for not doing enough to boost attendance.
Lackluster attendance costs the city money under a controversial
ticket-purchase guarantee.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Friday, Murphy said he has already talked to Los Angeles
Mayor James K. Hahn about not letting the NFL barons pit the state's
largest city against its second largest.</TE>
<TE>   "We did talk about not doing each other in," Murphy said. "He did
not seem interested in harming San Diego, but he did not make any
promises or commitment."</TE>
<TE>   In announcing that he will ask the City Council to form a
15-member Citizens Task Force on Chargers Issues, Murphy is following
the political playbook of his mayoral role model: Pete Wilson, who
was mayor from 1971 to 1983 and gave Murphy his start in local
politics.</TE>
<TE>   When faced with a controversial issue, Wilson often had the issue
vetted by a committee or commission, whose chairman was invariably a
close Wilson ally. Few recommendations were made by such groups that
were at odds with what Wilson wanted.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy said he will recommend that he appoint seven of the 15
members.</TE>
<TE>   He would pick the other eight members from among 24 names to be
submitted by City Council members.</TE>
<TE>   "The challenge is to find a way to keep the Chargers in San Diego
in a fiscally responsible way that the public will support," said
Murphy, who set Oct. 15 as a deadline for the task force to submit
its recommendations.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A sheriff's detective in a gang division has been charged with filing
false reports in 10 criminal cases, according to the Los Angeles
County district attorney's office.</LD>
<LD>   Darrin Lee Wilkinson, 38, surrendered to authorities Friday and
was freed on his promise to appear for arraignment on June 21 in Los
Angeles County Superior Court in Compton.</LD>
<LD>   Investigation in all of the cases was completed in January, but
none had been submitted to the district attorney's office,
spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons said.</LD>
<TE>   The 10 were among 74 of Wilkinson's cases that a supervisor
examined, the district attorney's office said.</TE>
<TE>   The Sheriff's Department conducted its own investigation into
Wilkinson, and then submitted the case to the district attorney's
office.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted, he could be imprisoned for one to three years on
each count.</TE>
<TE>   Wilkinson has been with the Sheriff's Department for 14 years.</TE>
<TE>   As a detective with the Operation Safe Streets unit, he
investigated gang-related crimes. In January, he was selected to
serve on a federal task force.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Lying on the floor face up, staff and faculty from the Laguna Beach
Unified School District concentrated on getting it right.</LD>
<LD>   "Think of yourself as a ball or a rocking chair," said Jordi Mas,
fitness guru, instructing them in an exercise called
roll-like-a-ball. "This is a movement that lengthens while you
strengthen."</LD>
<LD>   Next was the pelvic lift, in which hips are slowly angled up.
"Think of your spine as a string of pearls," Mas said. "Only one
pearl can lift at a time."</LD>
<TE>   Say goodbye to your parents' gym class and meet the future of
physical education: lifelong fitness. "It's about reorganizing the
brain and the nervous system to function more effectively," Mas said.</TE>
<TE>   As national studies show fitness falling and obesity rising among
youths, school districts across California are trying alternatives to
the old standards of softball, volleyball and calisthenics. In San
Francisco, teachers study yoga so they can apply its principles,
which they say improve students' concentration. Some L.A. Unified
schools offer juggling, Frisbee golf and wall climbing.</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Beach's program, which started in January, aims to augment,
not replace, conventional gym-class activities. Instead of jumping
jacks, a P.E. class might do breathing exercises. The curriculum is
still being developed.</TE>
<TE>   The idea met some initial resistance. Victoria Stalker, whose four
young children are in the district's schools, says she practices yoga
but doesn't think it ought to be taught in the classroom.</TE>
<TE>   "I just don't see how it will help my kids at this level," she
said. "If the day were longer, I'd have no problem with them doing
some breathing and stretching. But the schools should be doing math
and English first before adding this extra stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Others objected because fitness guru Mas, 31, is the son of school
board member Susan Mas.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sort of a 'made' job," said Rosemary Walli, who has two
children in elementary school. "We would do a lot better if the kids
just got more schooling. I think they learn lots more from team
sports than from these individual things."</TE>
<TE>   School officials say the program grew from a push four years ago
to set priorities.</TE>
<TE>   "Things were in total disarray," said Kathryn A. Turner, a school
board member. "Orange County had gone bankrupt, and we were almost
bankrupt."</TE>
<TE>   When Theresa A. Daem took the helm of the 2,600-student district
in 1998, one of her first actions was to set up a mission task force.
Though the district ranks No. 1 in Orange County in annual spending
per student--$7,411 for 2000-01--a survey by the California
Department of Education that year found that its students had a high
incidence of drug and alcohol abuse, Daem said. Although children
were doing well academically, a survey of students found that they
felt a lack of emotional support from their schools and community and
wanted more opportunities for meaningful participation.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a strange thing for us to encounter here," Daem said.
"Laguna Beach is a small community with a strong sense of social
responsibility. Hearing that our kids didn't feel supported was a
major surprise."</TE>
<TE>   The task force recommended rewriting the curriculum to include
activities that would encourage social and emotional well-being. That
meant a make-over for physical education.</TE>
<TE>   The state requires schools to offer P.E. but lets districts decide
exactly what to teach and how. Daem insists that lifelong fitness
will not phase out team sports, nor will it decrease time devoted to
academics.</TE>
<TE>   Regarding the district's hiring of Mas, she said, "It was totally
on merit." His mother "had no part of it, and she has no financial
gain. He's done an outstanding job."</TE>
<TE>   Under Jordi Mas' contract as a staff development consultant, he
teaches 90-minute classes every other week. The sessions, held after
hours in a P.E. room at Thurston Middle School, are free for faculty
and staff. Attendance is not mandatory. Mas is paid $60 an hour. If
some parents are skeptical, teachers are enthusiastic.</TE>
<TE>   "This is great," second-grade teacher Sandi Booth said as she
finished a session with Mas this week. "It's made me more aware of my
posture and how I walk."</TE>
<TE>   Teacher Sandy Gravely said she was eager to employ Mas' techniques
in her lifelong fitness classes at Top of the World Elementary
School. "A lot of the time, P.E. is just taking them out to play
kickball. Kickball is fun, but it won't benefit them as adults," she
said. "This is something they can do all their lives."</TE>

<HD>Keith Fuller, 79; Led AP Into High-Tech Era</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Keith Fuller, who as president of Associated Press for nearly a
decade guided the world's largest news-gathering organization into an
age of stories and pictures transmitted by satellite instead of
telephone and teletype, died Friday. He was 79.</LD>
<LD>   Fuller, who had suffered from Alzheimer's disease, died at his
home in Chevy Chase, Md.</LD>
<LD>   His four decades with AP included a stint as bureau chief in
Little Rock, Ark., in the 1950s. He directed coverage of the 1957
school desegregation crisis at Central High School, for which AP
Special Correspondent Relman Morin won a Pulitzer Prize.</LD>
<TE>   Fuller also was supervising editor for "The Torch Is Passed," AP's
account of President Kennedy's assassination, which sold 5 million
copies in hardcover and was translated into eight languages.</TE>
<TE>   When Fuller retired as AP's president and chief executive in 1985,
the news cooperative had 1,800 reporters, editors and photographers
in 219 bureaus worldwide, and was serving newspapers with 90% of the
country's daily circulation.</TE>
<TE>   He increased the number of AP's overseas bureaus, expanded the
range of live broadcast news and took the first steps toward
diversifying its sources of income.</TE>
<TE>   Edwin Keith Fuller was born in 1923 on his family's 320-acre wheat
farm near Arlington, Kan. He was 15 when his father died and he was
sent to live with his older married brother in Beaumont, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   There he edited the high school newspaper, discarded his first
name as "unfit for a cowboy" and acquired a baritone drawl.</TE>
<TE>   A freshman at Lamar College, he was also working full time as a
$13.50-a-week cub reporter on the Beaumont Enterprise when World War
II broke out.</TE>
<TE>   Enlisting in the Air Corps cadet program, he went overseas with
the 8th Air Force as a navigator-bombardier on a B-17.</TE>
<TE>   On his 10th mission with the 457th Bomb Group, his plane caught
fire from flak, and he bailed out at 21,000 feet over Nazi-occupied
Nancy, France.</TE>
<TE>   Fuller spent the next 14 months in a series of Stalag-lufts, POW
camps for airmen, until U.S. 3rd Army tanks battered down the gates
of Stalag VIII-A, outside Munich.</TE>
<TE>   Certain that he would not survive the camp's liberation, Fuller
ventured out from beneath his bunk only when he saw Gen. George S.
Patton himself, in full military regalia with ivory-handled pistols,
handing out C-rations to the jubilant inmates.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, Fuller entered Southern Methodist University with
the idea of becoming a lawyer, but dropped out to return to
journalism.</TE>
<TE>   In 1949, he received an offer from United Press, but instead
joined AP in New Orleans. He worked for AP in Mississippi, Texas,
Arkansas and Denver before moving to AP headquarters in New York as a
general executive in 1960.</TE>
<TE>   He took the post as AP's chief executive, succeeding his friend
and mentor Wes Gallagher, just as the media's technological age was
dawning.</TE>
<TE>   "My first capital budget was something like $800,000," he would
say. "Within a few years, I was scrounging for $16 million or $17
million, just to buy equipment. And laptops for every reporter had
not yet landed in my lap."</TE>
<TE>   To emphasize AP's place in international journalism, Fuller led
visits by the cooperative's board of directors to various news spots
around the world, notably to China in 1977, when they were received
by Premier Deng Xiaoping, and later to Tibet.</TE>
<TE>   In 1981, he was given the William Allen White Award by the
University of Kansas and a year later received an honorary doctorate
of letters from Ithaca College in New York.</TE>
<TE>   After his retirement, Fuller served for 10 years on the board of
directors of Gannett.</TE>
<TE>   He was succeeded at AP by Louis D. Boccardi, who remains president
and chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   Fuller is survived by his wife, Mattisue Scott; a daughter; and
two sons.</TE>

bureau chief until becoming a general executive in 1960. He was
president nearly a decade.</CP>

<HD>Sex Abuse Case Against Priest Goes to D.A.</HD>
<DH>Probe: Prosecutors will decide whether to charge John
Lenihan over allegation that the cleric impregnated a teen, paid for
abortion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The results of a criminal investigation of a Roman Catholic priest
who allegedly impregnated a Villa Park teenager and paid for her
abortion 20 years ago have been turned over to prosecutors, an Orange
County sheriff's spokesman confirmed Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The county district attorney's office will now decide whether to
file charges against John Lenihan, the former pastor of St. Edward
Church in Dana Point.</LD>
<LD>   The Orange and Los Angeles dioceses agreed in April to pay $1.2
million to Lori Haigh of San Francisco to settle molestation
accusations made against Lenihan in a civil lawsuit. Lenihan also
agreed to be removed from the priesthood. He has not confirmed or
denied a relationship with Haigh. Earlier, he had admitted to
molesting another teenage girl and having sexual relationships with
adult women.</LD>
<TE>   Haigh, now 37, filed a report with the Sheriff's Department in
April, immediately after a news conference announcing the settlement.
She said Lenihan had molested her for three years, beginning at age
14, after he noticed her guitar-playing and asked her to perform for
the church's Sunday Mass.</TE>
<TE>   She said she went to the Sheriff's Department because many of the
alleged incidents took place in the priest's car on deserted roads,
outside the jurisdiction of city police departments. Lenihan was a
youth pastor at St. Norbert Church in Orange at the time.</TE>
<TE>   If prosecutors decide to push forward with the case, it would mark
the first time during the current Catholic sex scandal that an Orange
County priest faced criminal charges.</TE>
<TE>   Another priest, Sigfried F. Widera, who left Orange County in 1986
after accusations of sexual misconduct surfaced, was charged last
month in Milwaukee with nine felony counts involving sexual abuse of
three minors in the early 1970s. He's also being investigated by
authorities here after three Orange County accusers stepped forward
this year to say he molested them.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities in Milwaukee say Widera has disappeared from his
Arizona home and has not been arrested.</TE>
<TE>--- UNPUBLISHED NOTE ---</TE>
<TE>Siegfried Widera is the correct spelling, not "Sigfried Widera" as
reported in this story.</TE>

<HD>Suit to Test Selecting of U.S. Judges</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A conservative legal foundation filed suit Friday challenging a
bipartisan procedure established by President Bush's top political
operative in California and the state's two Democratic U.S. senators
to select federal judicial candidates.</LD>
<LD>   The United States Justice Foundation, based in Escondido, said in
its lawsuit that the arrangement effectively gives the Democrats veto
power over the selections and interferes with the president's
constitutional powers.</LD>
<LD>   Named as defendants in the U.S. District Court lawsuit were Gerald
L. Parsky, a Republican attorney who headed Bush's presidential
campaign in California, and Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer.</LD>
<TE>   Candidates for federal judgeships are usually screened first by
the home-state senator of the president's party. With Bush's election
in 2000, that was not possible in California. So, acting on behalf of
the White House, Parsky last year negotiated an arrangement with
Feinstein and Boxer creating a bipartisan committee to screen
candidates for the federal district court bench.</TE>
<TE>   The Judicial Advisory Committee is made up of four subcommittees,
one for each judicial district in California. Each subcommittee is
composed of three Republican and three Democratic members. A judicial
candidate needs four votes to be referred to the White House for
consideration as a possible nominee. Parsky has a veto over all
selections.</TE>
<TE>   The intent was to come up with candidates acceptable to both
parties, thus ensuring speedy confirmations in the nearly evenly
divided Senate. The president nominates judicial candidates, and the
Senate has the power to confirm them. In recent months, however,
Parsky has come under fire from GOP conservatives, who have accused
him of effectively yielding control of the process to Feinstein and
Boxer.</TE>
<TE>   In its lawsuit, the foundation accused Parsky, Feinstein and Boxer
of supporting only those candidates "they find pleasing to
themselves, ideologically or otherwise."</TE>
<TE>   The suit, filed on behalf of Patrick Manshardt, a Los Angeles
attorney, also complained that the subcommittees operate in secret in
violation of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, the Government in
Sunshine Act and the president's constitutional powers to select
judges.</TE>
<TE>   Under those laws, the suit says, the selection committees must
give advance notice of their meetings and allow members of the public
to attend and give input. The lawsuit seeks an injunction to bar the
committees from operating in secret.</TE>
<TE>   Parsky, along with aides to Feinstein and Boxer, declined to
comment, saying they had not yet seen the lawsuit. But all three said
the bipartisan selection process has been working well.</TE>
<TE>   "It's producing good, well-qualified candidates who enjoy strong
bipartisan support and can be swiftly approved by the Senate," said
Howard Gantman, an aide to Feinstein. "This is a procedure that fully
recognizes the role of the president in the nomination of judges and
the Senate's role of advice and consent."</TE>
<TE>   Because of bipartisan support, Parsky said, the Senate took just
two months to approve the president's nomination of two federal
district court judges in Los Angeles. He expects the White House to
act soon to fill the remaining four vacancies in Los Angeles.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles City Council on Friday voted to demand that the state
Department of Health Services put a stop to the dumping of low-level
radioactive waste in landfills.</LD>
<LD>   Councilman Nate Holden, who sponsored the unanimously adopted
resolution, said he was outraged to learn Friday that state officials
continue to allow companies and researchers to dispose of low-level
waste in landfills, despite a judge's ruling in May that seems to
prohibit the dumping.</LD>
<LD>   "How do you circumvent a court order?" he said. "We need to order
them to comply."</LD>
<TE>   Holden said there is no reason to allow radioactive waste in city
landfills. "There are designated sites for this, outside the city of
Los Angeles, and we should take it there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   His motion called for immediate action by the Legislature that
would "permanently and unequivocally prohibit any dumping of
low-level radioactive waste at landfills." State Sens. Sheila Kuehl
(D-Santa Monica) and Gloria Romero (D-Los Angeles) are carrying
legislation to restrict the dumping.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Hirsch of the antinuclear group Committee to Bridge the Gap,
which sought the court order in May, said it was "very important that
the Los Angeles City Council has taken this so seriously."</TE>
<TE>   Hirsch said some radioactive waste has been going to California
dumps for years but that the state Department of Health Services has
recently loosened restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   Department of Health Services Director Diana M. Bonta said
Thursday that federal law allows the dumping as long as the waste has
the lowest "reasonably achievable" level of radiation, not to exceed
25 millirems, or about the equivalent of 2 1/2 chest X-rays.</TE>
<TE>   Since April, city officials have been conducting an investigation
into a state-issued report that radioactive waste may have been
dumped at Bradley Landfill in Sun Valley. They were ordered at the
time by the City Council to assess whether there is a public health
hazard.</TE>
<TE>   The Bradley Landfill investigation stemmed from a recent report by
the state Integrated Waste Management Board that Rocketdyne's Santa
Susana Field Laboratory may have deposited low-level radioactive
waste there during the last decade without the knowledge of state or
local regulators or the landfill operator.</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Wendy Greuel said through a spokesman that she
opposes any action by the Department of Health Services to allow
continued dumping.</TE>
<TE>   "She strongly believes the state of California should follow the
California Environmental Quality Act to its fullest extent and
immediately halt the dumping of any and all radioactive waste in our
communities," said aide Matt Szabo.</TE>
<TE>   Holden introduced the resolution after learning from a Times story
Friday that the Department of Health Services had adopted a federal
regulation to allow the dumping.</TE>
<TE>   Superior Court Judge Gayle Ohanesian of Sacramento ruled last
month that the regulation does not comply with the California
Environmental Quality Act. The bottom line, said Romero, is that
state officials are doing "the same thing the judge said they should
not be doing."</TE>

<HD>Newport Library Eligible for State Funds</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>MILTON CARRERO GALARZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A school library fund-raising campaign in Newport Beach that started
with children selling lemonade topped $1 million this week, making
the city eligible for state funds.</LD>
<LD>   The facility at Mariners Elementary School would be shared by
children and adults. A $500,000 gift from John and Donna Crean
boosted community donations over $1 million, which means the city can
apply for a $2-million state bond. John Crean is chief executive of
Fleetwood Enterprises Inc., best known for its manufactured housing
and recreational vehicles.</LD>
<LD>   Newport-Mesa Unified School District officials changed the design
after parents expressed concerns about children mingling with adult
patrons of the library.</LD>
<TE>   Susan Friend, who has four children at Mariners, said, "They made
some design changes to alleviate some of the safety concerns." Among
the changes is a movable glass wall that will separate students from
the public during school hours.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Hall, the state's Library Bond Act manager, said he
expects about 100 applications for projects this year, the first for
the funding. The average cost is about $5 million, he said, making
the Newport Beach request a modest one.</TE>
<TE>   The bonds are distributed on a need basis, he said, and joint-use
projects receive priority.</TE>
<TE>   The board also takes into account the condition of the existing
library and improvement of community services.</TE>
<TE>   Newport-Mesa has made an effort to ensure safety in designing the
one-story, 14,000-square-foot library, said Patrick Bartolic,
chairman of the Newport Beach Board of Library Trustees. In addition
to the glass wall, there will be security cameras and additional
staff.</TE>
<TE>   The fund-raising campaign began three months ago. The next step is
for the City Council and school district board to approve the design.
Both panels are scheduled to review the proposal Tuesday. The
application deadline for the state grants is Friday.</TE>

<HD>Defense Asks for New Trial in Fatal Dog Mauling Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Lawyers for a couple convicted in the dog-mauling death of their
neighbor pleaded with a judge Friday to grant their clients a new
trial rather than sentence them to state prison.</LD>
<LD>   After nearly three hours of arguments, Superior Court Judge James
Warren agreed to consider the request before ruling. He postponed the
couple's sentencing hearing to June 17.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a case of first impression in California," said Warren,
who presided over the trial. "There's never been another one like it.
I'm not going to rush it."</LD>
<TE>   Marjorie Knoller, 46, became the first California dog owner
convicted of murder in a mauling case when a Los Angeles jury
returned a guilty verdict in March.</TE>
<TE>   She faces a sentence of 15 years to life in prison for
second-degree murder, while her husband, Robert Noel, 60, faces four
years in prison for his conviction on involuntary manslaughter.</TE>
<TE>   Knoller and Noel, both attorneys, also were convicted of keeping a
vicious dog that killed.</TE>
<TE>   Knoller was returning from a trip to the grocery store with the
couple's two massive Presa Canarios, Bane and Hera, when they
attacked 33-year-old lacrosse coach Diane Whipple in the hallway
outside her upscale apartment on Jan. 26, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The dogs, each weighing more than 100 pounds, charged at Whipple
as she was entering her apartment.</TE>
<TE>   During the five-week trial, which took place in Los Angeles
because of intense publicity here, Knoller testified that she tried
to stop the attack by throwing herself between Whipple and the dogs.
Prosecutors said her account was untrue. Noel was not present during
the mauling.</TE>
<TE>   Knoller and Noel, wearing orange jail jumpsuits, sat silently in
the San Francisco courtroom as they listened to their attorneys'
arguments.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Dennis Riordan, who has replaced Knoller's
outspoken trial attorney Nedra Ruiz, asked the judge to toss out
Knoller's murder conviction, saying there was no evidence that the
dogs were likely to kill anyone.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan argued that Knoller could not have known her dogs were
lethal because there had not been a previous fatal mauling involving
a Presa Canario.</TE>
<TE>   "Until a Presa Canario has killed and we know about it, no one can
be convicted of murder," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors countered that such an argument was absurd, since
trial testimony showed that Knoller had seen her dogs lunge, bite or
snap at people 34 times before Whipple was killed.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. James Hammer said Knoller also knew the dogs
were vicious because she had been amply warned by a letter from a
veterinarian and through a book the couple had that referred to Presa
Canarios as "time bombs."</TE>
<TE>   Hammer said no one should have to be killed before dog owners are
put on notice that they can be convicted of murder for a fatal
mauling.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a frightening world that Mr. Riordan would create," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan and Noel's attorney, Bruce Hotchkiss, also argued that
evidence about the defendants' connection to the Aryan Brotherhood
prison gang prejudiced the jury.</TE>
<TE>   A prison gang expert testified that Knoller and Noel were
associates of the gang and were helping two inmates--including one
they adopted--run an attack dog breeding ring.</TE>
<TE>   "The impact of the evidence was extraordinarily prejudicial," said
attorney Dylan Schaffer, who also represented Knoller in court
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Hammer maintained that the gang evidence, which had been limited
by the judge, was relevant to the case.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Riordan contended that the judge deprived Knoller of
legal representation by ordering Ruiz to remain silent near the end
of closing arguments.</TE>
<TE>   After Friday's hearing, Whipple's partner, Sharon Smith, said that
although she respected the judge's decision to carefully consider the
motion, it was very difficult to have the sentencing postponed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very important for me to get this behind me," she said,
surrounded by friends and family.</TE>

<HD>Police Fear Foul Play in Man's Disappearance</HD>
<DH>Crime: Engineer, 21, has not been seen since May 27. Signs
of struggle are found in his Northridge home, and neighbors say they
heard a commotion.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Police said Friday they suspect foul play in the disappearance of
21-year-old Northridge computer engineer Peter Cruz IV, who has not
been seen nor heard from since May 27.</LD>
<LD>   Police officers found blood and overturned furniture in his
apartment.</LD>
<LD>   Neighbors said they heard a commotion two days before Cruz was
reported missing. Several thousand dollars worth of his belongings
were missing, police said, and his car was found near a mall in
Panorama City.</LD>
<TE>   Capt. John Sherman of the Los Angeles Police Department's
Devonshire Division said police were notified May 31 that Cruz was
missing, after some of his friends had been unable to contact him for
days.</TE>
<TE>   When the friends went to his residence in the 17800 block of
Superior Street, Sherman said, "they observed evidence of a
struggle."</TE>
<TE>   Police said a determination on whether the blood in the apartment
was Cruz's is awaiting completion of DNA tests.</TE>
<TE>   Det. Orlando Martinez said Cruz's car had been impounded May 31
after sitting near the Panorama Mall.</TE>
<TE>   Cruz's father, Peter, said his son "has been a good boy" and was
earning a good living.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Cruz IV, youngest of four sons named Peter, lived alone. He
is described as a bald, 5-foot-7, 160-pound man of Filipino ancestry.
He also has an extra thumb on his right hand, Martinez said.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone with information is asked to contact homicide detectives at
(818) 756-8291 during business hours or at (818) 756-8285 evenings
and weekends.</TE>

<HD>Baptist Missionary Finds Meaning in Amazon Tragedy</HD>
<DH>Peru: His wife and daughter were killed when they were
mistaken for drug smugglers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>YONAT SHIMRON</AU>
<BD>RELIGION NEWS SERVICE</BD>
<DL>CARY, N.C.</DL>
<LD>When Jim Bowers was working as a missionary in Peru, he shared his
faith with the people living along the Amazon River. Now Bowers,
whose wife and daughter were killed last year when bullets pierced
the small plane in which they were flying, is sharing his faith with
a far larger audience.</LD>
<LD>   Later this month, Bowers, 39, will travel to Portugal and England,
and then crisscross the United States, stopping in California,
Indiana, Illinois, Michigan and North Carolina. On each stop, he will
recount to fellow Christians how on April 20, 2001, the single-engine
Cessna floatplane carrying his family was mistaken for a
drug-smuggling operation and was shot down by the Peruvian air force
in conjunction with CIA surveillance aircraft.</LD>
<LD>   More important, he will try to use his personal story to inspire
others to take up the mission work that he and his wife, Roni, left
behind.</LD>
<TE>   "I do this with the intention of challenging young people to
follow in Roni's footsteps and not let danger scare you away," said
Bowers, whose steely determination masks all signs of grief.</TE>
<TE>   Promoting Book</TE>
<TE>   These days, Bowers is also plugging a new book, "If God Should
Choose: The Authorized Story of Jim and Roni Bowers," by Kristen
Stagg. When he's not doing radio interviews or talking to seminary
graduates, he's helping start up a congregation of Spanish speakers
at his church, Bethel Baptist, in Cary. He lives with his mother,
Wilma, and his 7-year-old son Cory, in nearby Garner, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   Bowers is convinced that, though the death of his wife and
daughter might seem senseless, it is all part of God's plan.</TE>
<TE>   "The goal Roni and I had is to convince people of the truth," he
said. "Because of her death, many more people have been convinced. I
have a huge open door, much more than I would have had if we went on
with our life. There's so much evidence God was in this."</TE>
<TE>   In March, on the eve of his trip to Peru, President Bush pushed a
bill through Congress that offers the survivors, including the family
of Kevin Donaldson, the Cessna pilot who suffered serious leg wounds,
$8 million in compensation. The Bush administration also acknowledged
the downing of the plane "should never have happened," though it
stopped short of admitting liability.</TE>
<TE>   The compensation package is much less than the $35 million that
attorneys for the Assn. of Baptists for World Evangelism had sought
on behalf of their two missionary families. But it is not the money
that Bowers wants. Despite his belief that God was behind the events,
Bowers said he would like to see someone take responsibility. After
three investigations, no one involved in the crash has lost a job or
gone to jail, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "You'd think somebody would stand up and say, 'You can't get off
scot-free acting like that,' " Bowers said. "They continue as if
nothing happened."</TE>
<TE>   But Bowers doesn't want to dwell on the negative. He said he has
forgiven everyone involved.</TE>
<TE>   He envisions spending the next few years in North Carolina,
working at his church. When he is at home, he and Abel Grande, a
Latino leader at Bethel Baptist, go into the immigrant neighborhoods
of Cary, knocking on doors and inviting people to church services,
Bible studies or soccer games.</TE>
<TE>   Child of Missionaries</TE>
<TE>   In some ways, it is not too different from the life Bowers knew in
Peru or the life his parents led as missionaries along the Amazon
River in Brazil.</TE>
<TE>   Bowers was groomed to be a missionary. Long before he and Roni
settled into their houseboat near Iquitos, Peru, the 8-year-old Jim
Bowers attended a boarding school for missionary children in the same
town. After graduating from the Grand Rapids, Mich., Baptist Academy,
Bowers enrolled at Piedmont Bible College near Winston-Salem (now
Piedmont Baptist College), a school that offered training in
missionary aviation.</TE>
<TE>   There, Bowers met Roni Luttig, a fellow student. Like him, Roni
had wanted to be a missionary since she was a child, and the two
became fast friends. They married in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   After Jim served a short stint in the Air Force, the couple made
plans for their life's calling. Instead of setting up a house in
Iquitos and traveling up and down the river to reach indigenous
Indians, the couple hit on a novel idea. They would build a houseboat
and live in it.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, their dream became a reality. Roni taught women's Bible
studies and children's Sunday school. She home-schooled Cory.</TE>
<TE>   Off to Get a Visa</TE>
<TE>   After adopting newborn Charity, the couple needed to arrange a
residence visa for her. Peruvian regulations required that the girl
get her visa stamped upon entry into the country, so the couple
decided to fly to neighboring Colombia and secure a visa at the
Peruvian Embassy.</TE>
<TE>   They were on their way back to Iquitos when bullets hit their
small plane. One bullet hit the back of Charity's head and penetrated
Roni's heart.</TE>
<TE>   Despite all that has happened, Bowers said his call to missionary
work overseas has never wavered. He would like to return to the
Amazon, though probably not to Peru.</TE>
<TE>   But first, he said, he would need to remarry.</TE>
<TE>   "Not enough people are willing to go," he said. "Why shouldn't I?
I'm ready and willing. It doesn't make sense to stay here. But I
can't go back without a mother for Cory."</TE>

<HD>Ex-Water Official Indicted in Contract Fraud</HD>
<DH>Courts: A grand jury accuses agency's former engineering
director of funneling $1 million to himself through two businessmen,
who are also charged.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A top official for a state contractor that supplies water to a
4,900-square-mile swath of the high desert has been indicted on
federal corruption charges in connection with two pipeline projects,
officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Russell John Mullins, 61, formerly the Mojave Water Agency's
director of engineering, operations and maintenance, was accused by a
grand jury in Los Angeles of working with two Inland Empire
businessmen to funnel contracts to his own surveying firm.</LD>
<LD>   Mullins operated the surveying firm, San Bernardino-based R.J.
Mullins and Associates, while also working as the No. 3 official in
the water agency, authorities said.</LD>
<TE>   The Rancho Mirage man is accused of steering contracts to
companies run by the two businessmen--who, in turn, subcontracted
work back to Mullins, federal authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   "He surreptitiously granted contracts to himself, using two
proxies" said Assistant U.S. Atty. Daniel O'Brien.</TE>
<TE>   The contracts, which brought Mullins about $1 million, were
connected to two important water pipeline projects in the high desert
of San Bernardino County, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The first was the Morongo Basin Pipeline, part of a system that
delivers water to a 5-million-gallon reservoir in Landers, then
distributes the water to percolation ponds that recharge the
groundwater in a 455-square-mile area near Yucca Valley. The project
serves about 57,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   The second was the Mojave River Pipeline, which broke ground in
November 1999. That pipeline is also responsible for addressing the
"overdraft"--meaning that more water is used in the region than is
naturally available--that has plagued the high desert for decades.</TE>
<TE>   The 21-count indictment also charges the two businessmen through
which Mullins allegedly funneled business. They are James Dale Cole
Jr., 48, a Yucaipa resident and the owner of J.D. Cole and
Associates, and Pasquale Benenati Jr., 70, a Riverside resident and
the owner of Aero Tech Surveys of Riverside.</TE>
<TE>   Federal authorities accused Cole and Benenati of submitting
inflated invoices to the Apple Valley-based water agency, and failing
to mention Mullins' involvement on the invoices. The U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, one of the government agencies that
funds the pipeline projects, also reimbursed the water agency for
some of those invoices, O'Brien said.</TE>
<TE>   Mullins could not be reached for comment. He had been a manager at
the water agency since February 1993 before he was fired, O'Brien
said. Benenati did not return telephone messages left at his office
Friday seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   George B. Newhouse Jr., a Los Angeles attorney who represents
Cole, said his client "obtained contracts and did the work at a fair
and reasonable price and he got paid for it."</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Cole is confident that he will be exonerated at trial,"
Newhouse said. "It's unfortunate he was dragged into this."</TE>
<TE>   Mullins did supply Cole with surveying equipment, trucks and
office space through the contracts, the attorney said--but Cole
merely reimbursed Mullins, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's difficult to conceive how that could be a corrupt
relationship," Newhouse said.</TE>
<TE>   Mullins and Cole are charged with conspiracy, theft from a program
that receives federal funds, 11 counts of mail fraud, two counts of
wire fraud and six counts of "honest services" fraud--essentially for
abusing the trust of taxpayers.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted on all counts, they could be sentenced to 105 years
in federal prison and fined $11.5 million, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Mullins has been released from custody after posting $50,000 bond.
Cole is expected to surrender when he is arraigned later this month
in Riverside.</TE>
<TE>   Benenati, charged with one count of aiding and abetting theft from
a federally funded program, has entered into a plea arrangement with
federal prosecutors, O'Brien said. As part of the arrangement, he
will provide information against the other two men, the prosecutor
said.</TE>
<TE>   The indictments come on the heels of a complex web of corruption
scandals that have plagued San Bernardino County government for
years. A key trial in those unrelated cases is scheduled to begin
next week.</TE>
<TE>   "The No. 1 priority for this office is attacking corruption," said
O'Brien, the head of an office that coordinates federal prosecutions
in Riverside and San Bernardino counties. "So this is a very
significant case for us."</TE>

<DH>Education: The man who runs Fuller Seminary has some ideas
on how to cultivate public politeness.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>K. CONNIE KANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Richard J. Mouw, president of Fuller Theological Seminary in
Pasadena, tells a story about pulling into a parking space at a Vons
supermarket in La Canada, only to have another driver jam on her horn
and make an obscene gesture.</LD>
<LD>   Mouw was sure he hadn't done anything to earn her ire. The spot
was open; he had not seen anyone going for it. Still, in deference to
her fury, the 62-year-old philosopher walked over and said he was
sorry to have upset her.</LD>
<LD>   "You don't know what kind of day I've had," Mouw says she told
him, and then she started to cry.</LD>
<TE>   For Mouw, an ethicist and scholar steeped in the teachings of
Reformation theologian John Calvin, the encounter was a metaphor for
the times: Under the weight of life's pressures, some people are
falling apart in public. And civility, which Mouw describes as
"public politeness," has become a rare commodity. This subject is
dear to the heart of the man who once wrote a book called "Uncommon
Decency: Christian Civility in an Uncivil World" and whose personal
hallmark is graciousness.</TE>
<TE>   Civility, Mouw says, requires us to show tact, moderation,
refinement and good manners toward people who are different from us.
But civility also has an inner side--the struggle to get beyond our
own perceptions, to see fellow human beings as creatures made in
God's image, no matter how defaced and damaged they may appear.</TE>
<TE>   "Every human being is a work of divine art," he says. "I can learn
a lot about how to treat an unlikable person with reverence if I keep
reminding myself of the value the person has in the eyes of God."</TE>
<TE>   Civility may be in short supply in 21st century Los Angeles, where
motorists get honked at for obeying the speed limit. But Mouw
believes that civility, like art appreciation, can be cultivated.
"The family meal is the primary workshop in civility," he says,
"where [sometimes] you sit with people you're angry with, and you
hang in there for 45 minutes because you can't leave the table."</TE>
<TE>   Today, many Americans "graze" rather than eat at the table at a
designated time because family members are busy pursuing their own
interests and schedules, he observes. To Mouw, this requires people
to make a point of finding ways to ask, "Is this the real story we
want to be writing about our lives?" Churches, he thinks, could play
a vital role by acting as "families" for people without families, by
opening their doors for weekly suppers, reminiscent of simpler times.</TE>
<TE>   Mouw, who has been president of Fuller for nine years, is an
evangelical Presbyterian with conservative leanings on such issues as
abortion, but is also a social activist committed to working with the
poor and eradicating injustice. He says his activism dates to the
anti-Vietnam War protests of the 1960s, when he was working on his
doctorate at the University of Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Later, as a professor at Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Mich., he
and three other white professors and their families lived in a
largely black urban neighborhood for 15 years. Mouw says the
experience had a profound influence on his thinking. "We've got to go
out there and be alongside of people who are dying of AIDS," he says,
"alongside of people who are feeling terribly depressed because their
marriages are breaking up, or they can't communicate with their kids,
or they're wrestling with sexual temptations, or they're worrying
about economic problems."</TE>
<TE>   Evangelicals, motivated by a desire to spread the word, have been
better at talking about the power of God to transform individuals
than tackling social-justice issues, he says. "We evangelicals have
been orally compulsive and behaviorally immature," and have lost
credibility as a result.</TE>
<TE>   Those kinds of observations win respect from political scientist
Alan Wolfe, director of the Boisi Center for Religion and American
Public Life at Boston College.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Richard Mouw could play a major role in America by taking
a public profile in demonstrating the complexities of the evangelical
faith so that it isn't reduced to stereotypes," Wolfe says.</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Bill Dyrness, former dean of Fuller's School of Theology,
has known Mouw more than two decades. He says Mouw has a rare ability
to combine deep faith with learning and ecumenical interests. "His
greatest gift is his ability to communicate.... Even though he is a
very well-educated person and a scholar, he could relate just as
easily to people who are very uneducated," Dyrness says.</TE>
<TE>   Fuller Seminary holds an unusual place in the training of pastors,
missionaries, psychologists, community leaders and Christian workers.
Its student body of just under 4,000 represents 120 denominations and
more than 60 countries. It is believed to be the world's largest
multidenominational seminary.</TE>
<TE>   At this year's June 15 commencement, 500 future Christian leaders
will receive degrees ranging from master of divinity to doctorates in
theology and psychology. Since the seminary was founded by evangelist
Charles E. Fuller in 1947, nearly 20,000 have graduated.</TE>
<TE>   Rabbi Elliot N. Dorff, rector at the University of Judaism, jokes
that Mouw looks too happy to be a "true Calvinist," to which Mouw
replies: "It sure helps to know that in spite of all of my sins, I am
forgiven by a loving God."</TE>
<TE>   Despite his administrative duties, Mouw continues to teach. His
big course is "Christian Worldview and Contemporary Challenges." Ever
mindful of the influence of Hollywood, he stays in touch with the
entertainment industry. Some eyebrows were raised in April when
Fuller opened its doors to a film festival and gave actor Rod Steiger
an award. "We need to be in dialogue with Hollywood," Mouw says, "not
only to criticize, but to learn more from their insight into the
culture. Seminaries need to be out there on the front lines in
dialogue with people who are wrestling with the issues in culture,
not just dismissing the whole industry as nothing but a pagan
consumerist catering to popular taste."</TE>
<TE>   He never misses three TV shows--"Alias", "24" and "The West
Wing"--taping them so he can watch on his exercise bike. He has even
watched the Jerry Springer show, crying over the pain of people like
the woman who learns on air that her husband has been sleeping with
her sister.</TE>
<TE>   The incivility that is flaunted on shows like Springer's, Howard
Stern's and the World Wrestling Federation's is having a pernicious
influence in the daily lives of many people, he says. But at the same
time he asks himself: "Are any of the things we find so easy to
condemn in our culture caused by the failure of the church?" At
crucial points, when he has had to make tough decisions, he says, he
has asked God: "Just help me not to stand in the way of all the good
things that could be happening here."</TE>

<LD>Greg Gilmore of Santa Ana has just the name for a new San Fernando
Valley city: Los Diablos.</LD>
<LD>   "After all," he asks, "aren't devils supposed to be fallen
angels?"</LD>
<LD>   A takeover plot by the Valley? Mike Wren noticed that an
advertising supplement in the New York Times published this stunner
about "getting to and from" Los Angeles International Airport: "LAX
is 15 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles." No wonder the Metro
Rail folks decided not to have the Green Line go directly to LAX!</LD>
<TE>   On the road: Ken Romano of Huntington Beach spotted this police
blotter item in a Hawaiian newspaper: "9:36 a.m. An anonymous caller
reported seeing a disoriented goat near Anahola Bridge."</TE>
<TE>   Where the stars hang out: In Torrance, John Dowsing found a street
sign that lived up to its name (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   The Big Chef in the sky: So important is fine cuisine in these
parts that Susan Tellem of Malibu noticed in a local church hymnal
that the words for "Joyful, Joyful, We Adore Thee" read in part: "All
thy woks with joy surround thee."</TE>
<TE>   Now hear this: Sunday Idowu of Buena Park came upon a cautionary
note for patients--even those with huge ears (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Just in time for summer: Bob Hill found a sign for those who want
to do something about their tonnage (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Can't we all get along? Bob Noble saw a For Rent sign in front of
a Santa Monica apartment house that noted the unit had a "duel" sink
bath.</TE>
<TE>   Reseda fights back: The Web site Resedaweb.blogspot.com accused me
of neglect when a recent column mentioned just one movie ("The Karate
Kid") that referred to that storied community.</TE>
<TE>   The site placed Reseda in the background of such films as "Erin
Brockovich" and "Boogie Nights" (the porn industry epic), as well as
two of my favorites: "Severed Arm" ("bad thriller uses establishing
shot of Reseda post office") and "Fast Sofa" ("Crispin Glover freaks
out in discount bird store").</TE>
<TE>   The Pepsi Challenge: Here was a robber who didn't know he was
facing the world's bravest service station worker. "A man pulled a
shotgun from his duffel bag and demanded money from an employee," the
police log in the Long Beach Press Telegram said. "The employee asked
if he was joking."</TE>
<TE>   The assailant loaded the shotgun and again demanded money. "Then
the cashier slammed the security window shut, picked up a two-liter
bottle of Pepsi, raised it above his head and approached the man."</TE>
<TE>   And? "The man ran away."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Boyd Bennett, 77, who wrote the 1950s hit "Seventeen," died of a lung
ailment Sunday in Sarasota, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   Bennett's band, Boyd Bennett and His Rockets, hit pay dirt in 1955
with "Seventeen," a song that became a No. 5 pop hit. He followed
that with the song "My Boy Flat-Top."</LD>
<LD>   Bennett was the general manager of WLKY-TV in Louisville in the
early 1960s and appeared on WAVE-TV in the '50s.</LD>
<TE>   The songwriter, musician and TV producer was born in Muscle
Shoals, Ala., but was raised in North Davidson, Tenn., just outside
Nashville. He got into music by singing gospel songs with his
grandfather and started his career playing guitar in honky-tonk bars.</TE>
<TE>   Bennett served in the Navy in World War II and suffered a serious
leg injury on D-day.</TE>
<TE>   After leaving the music business in the 1960s, he owned nightclubs
and, later, a company that made parts for air-conditioning systems.</TE>

<HD>Ward Bushee Jr., 79; Led Watsonville Paper to a Pulitzer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ward H. Bushee Jr., 79, who was editor of the Watsonville, Calif.,
Register-Pajaronian when it won a Pulitzer Prize for public service
in 1955, died of cancer Wednesday at his home in Aptos, Calif.</LD>
<LD>   With fewer than 9,000 subscribers, the Register-Pajaronian was the
smallest newspaper at the time to earn the Pulitzer. It won for its
1955 coverage exposing a cozy relationship between the district
attorney and a Watsonville gambler.</LD>
<LD>   Bushee served as managing editor for 33 years and editor for five
years, retiring in 1989.</LD>
<TE>   A native of Holyoke, Mass., he spent 43 years in journalism,
beginning as a reporter for the Redding, Calif., Record Searchlight.
He served in the Navy during World War II as an ensign on a fleet tug
and saw duty in the Aleutians, the Central Pacific and Okinawa.</TE>
<TE>   He arrived at the Watsonville paper in 1951, and over the next
several decades led it in chronicling the changes that would
transform the area, including a tripling of the local population and
shifts in agricultural production from the once-dominant apple
orchards to fields of flowers and strawberries.</TE>

<HD>Herbert Finn, 89; Wrote for Bob Hope, Classic Sitcoms</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Herbert Finn, 89, who wrote for such classic sitcoms as "The
Honeymooners" and "Gilligan's Island," died May 28 of respiratory
failure at Providence St. Joseph's Hospital in Burbank. He was a
longtime resident of Studio City.</LD>
<LD>   The Boston native began his career in radio as a contributor to
"Amos 'n' Andy," "Duffy's Tavern" and other shows. He worked
alongside a young Neil Simon, whom he advised to "get out of writing
and earn a real living!"</LD>
<LD>   In TV, he wrote for Bing Crosby and Bob Hope, as well as for "The
Flintstones," "Dennis the Menace, "The Garry Moore Show" and "The
Brady Bunch."</LD>
<TE>   On "The Honeymooners," Finn was a member of a three-person writing
group that alternated with other writers, producing scripts every
other week for the sitcom starring Jackie Gleason.</TE>
<TE>   In an article he wrote for "On Cable" magazine in 1985, when 75
lost episodes from the 1950s were shown on Showtime, Finn said that
Gleason was generous with his writers, who appreciated his unerring
sense of comedy.</TE>
<TE>   "Jackie Gleason was by far the best sketch man I ever saw," Finn
wrote. "You could put Milton Berle or Jack Benny in sketches, but
they were really just playing themselves. When Gleason did a sketch,
he became the character he was portraying."</TE>
<TE>   In 1985, Finn won a Mobil playwriting award for an Irish comedy
called "The Almoster." Finn, who received the award at the Royal
Exchange Theatre in Manchester, England, had never set foot in
Ireland. It was his first play.</TE>

<HD>Presbyterians Get Down to Business</HD>
<DH>Agenda: Church's conservatives and liberals are expected to
press their views at annual meeting in Ohio.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>When the Presbyterian Church (USA) meets in Columbus, Ohio, later
this month, the hottest topic in the
denomination--homosexuality--won't be on the agenda.</LD>
<LD>   That does not mean there won't be fireworks.</LD>
<LD>   The 2.5-million-member denomination will hold its 214th General
Assembly meeting June 15-22. About 554 delegates will set policy and
budgets and elect a moderator to serve a one-year term as top
spokesperson.</LD>
<TE>   This year's meeting will likely see a push by the church's
conservative wing to define exactly how the church views salvation
through Jesus Christ. A compromise statement passed last year in
Louisville, Ky., failed to satisfy many evangelicals.</TE>
<TE>   "Both heresy and unbelief have crept into our ranks," said the
Rev. Joe Rightmyer, executive director of Presbyterians for Renewal.
He said the church must take a definitive stand that salvation comes
only through the death of Jesus Christ.</TE>
<TE>   "If that's up for grabs, then we have no basis for unity and
purpose as a church," he said.</TE>
<TE>   At least five of the church's 173 regional presbyteries will seek
to have delegates affirm a document that was issued after last year's
meeting by the church's theology and worship office.</TE>
<TE>   That statement, "Hope in the Lord Jesus Christ," received
widespread support, but has yet to be officially endorsed by the
entire church.</TE>
<TE>   The statement said: "No one is saved apart from God's gracious
redemption in Jesus Christ. Yet ... we neither restrict the grace of
God to those who profess explicit faith in Christ nor assume that all
people are saved regardless of faith."</TE>
<TE>   Congregations in California's San Joaquin Presbytery, a bastion of
conservatism, said in its resolution that "many people have asked if
we still believe in what the Scriptures and confessions teach about
Jesus Christ, or if those are forgotten statements that we no longer
preach and teach."</TE>
<TE>   For years, liberals and conservatives have lived in an awkward
embrace in the denomination.</TE>
<TE>   Recent years have seen the rise of the Confessing Church Movement,
a loose network of nearly 1,300 congregations that have affirmed the
infallibility of the Bible, salvation through Jesus Christ alone and
sexual purity in marriage.</TE>
<TE>   Liberals are uneasy with the growing movement and see it as an
attempt to force theological uniformity across the historically
diverse denomination.</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Barbara Anderson, who co-pastors Pasadena Presbyterian
Church in California with her husband, Mark Smutny, said
conservatives want to avoid the traditional systems for drafting
churchwide statements on theology.</TE>
<TE>   "The struggle all the way back to the Hebrew prophets has always
been, who speaks for God?" Anderson said. "I don't think any of us
has a corner on who God is or what God has to say, so I think we have
to listen to each other."</TE>
<TE>   Both sides are clearly tired of the yearly back-and-forth
struggles on homosexuality and other divisive issues. Officials at
church headquarters in Louisville have endorsed a plan to move
assemblies to every other year, which would shave costs off the $5
million annual meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Conservatives support that plan because it would make it harder to
change church law on gay ordination and other issues. Conservatives
also support a proposal to increase the margin needed for
constitutional amendments from a simple majority to a two-thirds
majority.</TE>
<TE>   Churches in Olympia, Wash., even want to change the meeting
schedule so that major changes could be made only once every five
years.</TE>
<TE>   "These things are so expensive and consume so much of the church's
money that it's absolutely obscene to be spending this kind of money
on annual assemblies," said the Rev. John M. Mulder, president of
Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary.</TE>
<TE>   The issue of late-term abortion will also be hotly debated, with a
new report that clarifies the church's position.</TE>

<HD>Gay Pride Festival in O.C. on Hold, Planners Say</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Organizers have mothballed Orange County's annual gay-pride festival,
citing increased costs and a lack of public interest that made the
summertime event too expensive to put on.</LD>
<LD>   Born in the late 1980s, Orange County Cultural Pride's annual
two-day gathering was the showcase event for local gay men, lesbians
and supporters. The festival, which included food and music, peaked
at the 10th anniversary gathering at UC Irvine's Aldrich Park two
years ago, attracting about 10,000 people.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, though, fewer than 5,000 people showed up and
organizers lost $12,000--cutting into money to put on this year's
festival, usually held in August. The festival costs about $100,000
to stage.</LD>
<TE>   Robb Helms, chief financial officer for the festival, said the
group was surveying the gay and lesbian community to try to determine
why interest in the event has waned, and what steps might be taken to
revive it.</TE>
<TE>   One issue could be competition: The festival follows similar large
events in Long Beach in May and Los Angeles in June.</TE>
<TE>   "We come along a few weeks later in mid-August and everybody says,
'We've just attended two festivals that are really big, so why should
we spend the money and come to Orange County when it's so much
smaller?' " Helms said.</TE>
<TE>   Helms said the organization would meet this summer to review the
survey results and determine whether to revive the festival.</TE>

<LD>Organizers have mothballed Orange County's annual gay-pride festival,
citing increased costs and a lack of public interest that made the
summertime event too expensive to put on.</LD>
<LD>   Born in the late 1980s, Orange County Cultural Pride's annual
two-day gathering was the showcase event for local gay men, lesbians
and supporters. The festival, which included food and music, peaked
at the 10th anniversary gathering at UC Irvine's Aldrich Park two
years ago, attracting about 10,000 people.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, though, fewer than 5,000 people showed up and
organizers lost $12,000--cutting into money to put on this year's
festival, usually held in August. The festival costs about $100,000
to stage.</LD>
<TE>   Robb Helms, chief financial officer for the festival, said the
group was surveying the gay and lesbian community to try to determine
why interest in the event has waned, and what steps might be taken to
revive it.</TE>
<TE>   One issue could be competition: The festival follows similar large
events in Long Beach in May and Los Angeles in June.</TE>
<TE>   "We come along a few weeks later in mid-August and everybody says,
'We've just attended two festivals that are really big, so why should
we spend the money and come to Orange County when it's so much
smaller?' " Helms said.</TE>
<TE>   The festival also could be a victim of the success of the gay
rights movement. When it began, part of its mission was to raise the
public profile of the gay community in traditionally conservative
Orange County. The first attendees were harassed by picketers,
including children bearing signs that read, "Got AIDS yet?" recalled
Jeff LeTourneau, one of the original organizers.</TE>
<TE>   "That's not the Orange County of today--it's a far more
understanding place," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, the desire by activists to raise the profile of the gay
community has ebbed as gay life has moved closer to the mainstream,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   And the event itself, held at UCI after the first controversial
festival at Santa Ana's Centennial Park, has failed to become a
center of attention.</TE>
<TE>   "A parade running through a campus in summertime is almost the
antithesis of what you would expect" of a gay pride parade,
LeTourneau said, adding that the festival had become stale.</TE>
<TE>   "My personal opinion is they have refused to change," said
LeTourneau, who is no longer involved in planning the event. "It's
always the same booths and the same food vendors and T-shirt sellers.
When you're doing the same thing year after year, it's no longer fun
and exciting, and no longer a draw."</TE>
<TE>   Helms said the organization would meet this summer to review the
survey results and determine whether to revive the festival, and, if
so, in what form.</TE>
<TE>   "We're asking people what they would like best, and if they give
us ideas maybe we can put on something that would attract them," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   LeTourneau hopes so. Beyond the social and political aspects of
the festival, he said, is the personal. Many gay men and lesbians
just coming out find support groups through gay pride festivals.</TE>
<TE>   "For a lot of them, that's their first exposure to the community,"
LeTourneau said. "That opportunity would be lost."</TE>

<HD>Church Delays Reporting of Alleged Abuse</HD>
<DH>Crime: Archdiocese held off on telling police of charge
against priest because case is so old.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETH SHUSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Police Department detectives, perplexed that they were
not notified earlier, sought information Friday from the Los Angeles
Archdiocese about a San Fernando Valley priest who was removed from
ministry after allegations that he engaged in inappropriate conduct
with a minor 28 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   LAPD officials said they had come to expect the archdiocese to
report names of accused priests to them, as church lawyers have done
over the last several months.</LD>
<LD>   Cardinal Roger M. Mahony has said repeatedly that he believes the
LAPD should be notified whenever an abuse allegation is received in
the three-county archdiocese.</LD>
<TE>   But in this case, Tod Tamberg, spokesman for the archdiocese, said
Friday that officials would first conduct an internal investigation
into the accusations against Msgr. Christian Van Liefde to determine
whether they were credible.</TE>
<TE>   Tamberg said the alleged victim was advised to report the charge
to authorities.</TE>
<TE>   In a subsequent interview with The Times on Friday, Tamberg said
the archdiocese was in contact with the LAPD. However, that was only
after an LAPD detective contacted archdiocese lawyers, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Daniel Mulrenin of the LAPD's sexually exploited child unit
said the investigation could have been made more difficult by the
archdiocese's failure to contact the police.</TE>
<TE>   "We did not have this gentleman's name," Mulrenin said "We are
still seeking information from them.... What occurred? Is it in our
jurisdiction? We need whatever information we can obtain about it."</TE>
<TE>   Friction between the district attorney's office and lawyers for
the priests have delayed the flow of information for the police.
Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley said last week that he was considering other
options, including what sources said might be the use of a grand
jury, to obtain archdiocese records for law enforcement authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Under Mahony's zero-tolerance policy, allegations of sexual abuse
with minors are supposed to be reported to authorities immediately.
But Tamberg said the policy does not apply to older cases.</TE>
<TE>   "There are allegations that come out that are clearly and quickly
determined to be false," Tamberg said. "This is a 28-year-old
complaint. [The alleged victim] is an adult. We advise them ... that
they may exercise their right to notify police."</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD is handling 43 active investigations involving about 34
priests, including some who are dead. Most of the cases are
considered old; only one or two involve recent sex abuse allegations.
Many of the cases involve priests whose names were reported to law
enforcement by the archdiocese earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   To avoid problems with the statute of limitations, detectives must
prove that an old case involved multiple victims and that there was
substantial sexual contact, among other things. That's why,
detectives say, they need as much information as possible on accused
priests' personnel histories and other records. Because pedophiles
rarely have a single victim, police want to know as much as possible
about a priest's personnel history. Van Liefde was pastor at St.
Genevieve's Catholic Church in Panorama City. He was placed on
temporary administrative leave last month pending the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Van Liefde, who also served as the chaplain for the Los Angeles
Fire Department, could not be reached for comment Friday.</TE>
<TE>   A statement to parishioners was read at the church last weekend.
"The simple fact that a complaint has been made does not mean that
Msgr. Chris has acted in an abusive fashion," Msgr. Craig Cox, vicar
of clergy, said in that statement. "All people, priests included,
must be presumed innocent until there is proof to the contrary."</TE>
<TE>   A forum that was to be held last week at the church on the current
sex abuse crisis was canceled. Van Liefde was supposed to host that
meeting.</TE>

<HD>El Rio Parents Lobby to Keep Youth Program From Closing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Concerned parents in El Rio are scrambling to save a popular youth
program that they say has been undermined by political squabbling.</LD>
<LD>   The Police Activities League in El Rio--the only group offering
after-school activities for youths in a new $3-million community
gymnasium--will shut down on July 1 unless parents can raise the
nearly $100,000 needed to keep it running.</LD>
<LD>   PAL organizes youth sports leagues, dances and field trips in the
rural community near Oxnard. It is funded by the Ventura County
Sheriff's Department, the Rio Elementary School District and a
three-year state grant.</LD>
<TE>   The state grant ended this year, and the Sheriff's Department and
school district are facing budget shortfalls, said Rio Supt. Yolanda
Benitez.</TE>
<TE>   "I think PAL's a great program," she said. "But it all comes down
to money."</TE>
<TE>   Parents and some of those who sit on the 12-member PAL board,
however, contend there is more to the story.</TE>
<TE>   Political spats among individuals on the PAL board and a feud
between county and school district officials have prevented progress,
said PAL board member Soledad Trevino.</TE>
<TE>   "The board's main purpose is to get money to keep PAL open, and
that was the one thing the board did not do," she said. "I sat
through five months of meetings, and all we did was squabble."</TE>
<TE>   About 20 parents are planning a meeting on the PAL program
Wednesday at the gymnasium.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Mosqueda, a member of the PAL and Rio school boards, said the
dissension among factions has hindered efforts to get funding for
PAL, as well as plans to expand the program.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, Mosqueda was one of several community members who
were frustrated that the gym sat mostly idle as county and school
district officials quarreled about which agency was responsible for
managing recreation programs.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, he said PAL has filled that void, attracting as many
as 150 young people to the community gym after school a day.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County Supervisor John Flynn said he would talk to the
Sheriff's Department to see what can be done to continue the
program's funding, which entails salary and benefits for a
deputy--about $92,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   Trevino said county recreation programs could work temporarily,
but that she and other parents believe the police presence that comes
with PAL is crucial in El Rio. She said the parents want to do
everything they can to keep PAL before settling for something else.</TE>
<TE>   "In this community, law enforcement is considered a
taboo--something to run from," Trevino said. "With PAL, cops are
looked at as an acceptable part of the community."</TE>

<HD>Roy Roberts II, 59; Led Watts Boys-Girls Club</HD>

<LD>Roy W. Roberts II, executive director of the Watts/Willowbrook Boys &amp;
Girls Club, who had a long and influential career in youth services
in the Los Angeles area, has died. He was 59.</LD>
<LD>   The driving force behind the club's new $7.2-million facility,
Roberts suffered a heart attack Monday and was pronounced dead at
Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital in Inglewood.</LD>
<LD>   The 27,000-square-foot facility, which will formally open June 27,
includes a computer lab and an expanded arts and crafts center, as
well as a gymnasium and fitness center. It will serve as many as
4,000 children ages 7 to 17 each year. The old facility could serve
only 1,000 youths a year.</LD>
<TE>   A native of Houston, Roberts was raised in the Los Angeles area
and attended public and private schools.</TE>
<TE>   His work in the field began in 1966, when he served as director of
youth services for a high school in the San Fernando Valley. After
military service in Vietnam and South Korea from 1966 to 1969,
Roberts continued his education at El Camino College and then Cal
State Northridge.</TE>
<TE>   He also took the post of program director at the San Fernando
Valley Boys &amp; Girls Club in Pacoima, which served local elementary
schools and the San Fernando Gardens public housing project.</TE>
<TE>   In 1975, he was named executive director of what was then called
the Southern Area Boys Club, of which he had been a member as a
teenager.</TE>
<TE>   He took over a youth center that was going through a difficult
period marked by a general decline in support for the community after
the Watts riots 10 years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   One of his first moves was to open the club to girls and rename it
the Watts/Willowbrook Boys &amp; Girls Club.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years he broadened its scope of activities. In addition
to athletics and recreation, staples at most Boys &amp; Girls Clubs, he
started tutoring programs, health education efforts and a youth
leadership training program.</TE>
<TE>   A large, soft-spoken man with an even disposition, Roberts became
a surrogate father figure to generations of youths in Watts,
Willowbrook, Compton and other parts of South-Central Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Cliff Johnson, current president of the club's board, recalled
Roberts as a highly focused, inspirational person.</TE>
<TE>   "He believed in strong programs," said Johnson, who was on the
search committee that hired Roberts in 1975.</TE>
<TE>   "His vision from the get-go was, 'I want to get the programs going
and then we will build a new facility.' "</TE>
<TE>   Roberts' leadership program for youths ages 14 to 18 challenged
members to serve the community through volunteer efforts at area
hospitals and within the club. Many youths acted as tutors in school
subjects at the club.</TE>
<TE>   The leadership program also gave members the opportunity to travel
throughout the United States and to various European countries to
attend conferences.</TE>
<TE>   "He wanted to prepare kids to be successful leaders, and he
challenged them. He told them, 'If you graduate from college, I will
use all of my resources to help you get a job.' And more often than
not he kept his word," Johnson said. "He was that well connected."</TE>
<TE>   Since the early 1990s, Roberts was the driving force in efforts to
fund and build a new facility at the club's longtime location on East
120th Street.</TE>
<TE>   After many false starts and funding problems, ground was broken
for the new building in 1999. Roberts raised $5.5 million of the $7.2
million total from private foundations, individuals, and state and
county sources.</TE>
<TE>   Survivors include his wife, Rudy; two sons, Roy III and Randell;
and a granddaughter, Raven Lee Roberts. He is also survived by three
brothers and a sister.</TE>
<TE>   Funeral services are scheduled for Monday at St. Eugene's Catholic
Church, 9506 Van Ness Ave., Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Contributions in his name can be made to the Watts/Willowbrook
Boys &amp; Girls Club Building Fund or Family Fund, 1339 E. 120th St. or
Box 59189, Los Angeles, CA 90059.</TE>

<LD>A Roman Catholic priest convicted of molesting a 13-year-old girl
more than 20 years ago was sentenced Friday to seven years in prison.</LD>
<LD>   Inactive priest Don Kimball also must register as a sex offender
for molesting the girl.</LD>
<LD>   At the same trial, he was found not guilty of raping a 14-year-old
girl in Santa Rosa in 1977.</LD>
<TE>   Kimball was convicted in Sonoma County Superior Court of two
counts of lewd conduct with the girl and sentenced to seven years on
each count, to run concurrently.</TE>
<TE>   Kimball--along with Boston's John Geoghan, now serving a nine- to
10-year sentence on a molestation conviction--is one of few
ex-priests to be convicted of a sex crime since the scandal broke
nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   Most abuse claims are litigated in civil court.</TE>

<HD>A. Schoenberg, 81; Was Oldest to Receive Heart Transplant</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DUANE NORIYUKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Arthur Schoenberg, once before, had prepared himself to die. A rabbi
had come to his bedside, a eulogy was written. Goodbyes were said,
and Schoenberg had handed down his treasured golf clubs to one of his
sons. As with life, he approached death with humility and grace.</LD>
<LD>   A flurry of 12th-hour decisions, however, led to what his wife,
Jane Schoenberg, describes as "the miracle," and on Sept. 21, 1986,
at age 66, Schoenberg became the oldest person to receive a heart
transplant in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   At the time, the recommended cutoff point was 55.</LD>
<TE>   Schoenberg had already been turned down once for a donor heart,
but as his condition worsened, the screening committee at the UCLA
Heart Transplant Program reconsidered his case.</TE>
<TE>   "We were going outside the envelope with him, because of his
personality and his family's support and their love for him," said
Dr. Davis Drinkwater, a former member of the committee and the
surgeon who performed the transplant.</TE>
<TE>   "It was obvious he would get good attention from his family, plus
he was a vital guy," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Schoenberg, with the exception of his heart, was in good health.
He was vibrant, and through four heart attacks and one bypass surgery
had demonstrated a willingness to comply with whatever doctors asked
of him.</TE>
<TE>   The committee placed him on the waiting list, but because of his
age he was given low priority. It was unlikely that a heart would
become available in time.</TE>
<TE>   Within 24 hours, however, Schoenberg was wheeled into surgery. A
23-year-old man had been killed in a motorcycle crash. Of the
potential recipients, only Schoenberg was a match.</TE>
<TE>   Three months later, he was shopping for a new set of clubs.</TE>
<TE>   "He was the poster boy," said Drinkwater, now chairman of the
department of cardiac and thoracic surgery at the Vanderbilt
University Medical Center in Nashville. "He led the whole movement of
making alternate donor organs available to older patients."</TE>
<TE>   Irene Furlong, a heart transplant recipient who, along with
Schoenberg, helped start a local chapter of a support group for
transplant recipients, agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "Hearts that would not be used on younger people, hearts that may
have had a bypass or angiogram, hearts that normally would be thrown
in the trash can, we are using on older recipients because we are
finding that older recipients do very well," Furlong said. "You're
not going to give a 50-year-old heart to a 20-year-old, but you can
give it to an older person."</TE>
<TE>   The new heart added 16 years to Schoenberg's life, long enough to
see grandchildren born, long enough to see Europe for the first
time--and long enough to score three holes-in-one for a lifetime
total of four.</TE>
<TE>   He was out on the course three times a week, but earlier this year
his health began to falter. Kidney failure required dialysis. Cancer,
requiring radiation treatment, was spreading, and May 7 he suffered a
stroke.</TE>
<TE>   Schoenberg stayed with golf as long as he could.</TE>
<TE>   He was competitive and had great respect for the game, said Melvin
Small, one of his golf partners.</TE>
<TE>   But eventually Schoenberg became too weak to play. He continued
riding in the cart and putting with his buddies after they reached
the greens.</TE>
<TE>   Then, near the end, he could only sit out on the balcony of his
home in Hancock Park overlooking the Wilshire Country Club course.</TE>
<TE>   He waved at friends as they passed by and inhaled the
picture-perfect beauty of grass and trees.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, when he could no longer sit up, Jane would fold the
couch out into a bed and prop him up with pillows so he could see the
course from their living room.</TE>
<TE>   On May 17, surrounded by family in a room that looks out on the
13th green and 14th tee, Schoenberg died. He was 81 years old.</TE>
<TE>   He was born in Atlantic City, N.J., but grew up in Philadelphia. A
1948 graduate of the University of Michigan, he moved to Los Angeles
in the early 1950s and started a business manufacturing ladies'
handbags with his brother Theodor.</TE>
<TE>   Arthur left the business in 1974 and worked as vice president of a
friend's weatherstripping business until retirement.</TE>
<TE>   Arthur and Jane were married in 1952 and had three children.</TE>
<TE>   "The children say they never heard him raise his voice," Jane
Schoenberg said. "He treated them all with respect from the time they
were very young."</TE>
<TE>   Her father was a calm, quiet presence, said daughter Marcie
Schoenberg Lee, 51, of Tempe, Ariz. Once, while she was a college
student, she asked if he could be more forthcoming with her. She
wanted more communication.</TE>
<TE>   From that moment on, he made a point to talk more often to her;
and, over time, she also learned to listen to and understand his
gentle silence.</TE>
<TE>   "My dad and I had an understanding," she said. "We could sit in a
room for hours and never say a word and both be completely content."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps it was because his transplant gave him a clear
understanding of mortality that Schoenberg did not take life for
granted.</TE>
<TE>   For whatever reason, through words and silence, says Lee, nothing
was left unsaid or undone.</TE>
<TE>   She said goodbye by thanking him and saying he would live on in
her.</TE>
<TE>   Her brother Edward, 45, of Fredericktown, Ohio, offered his
farewell by saying he would think of his father each time he stepped
onto a golf course, each time he stood at the 18th tee, the point
where Arthur, who was not opposed to a modest wager, would raise the
stakes a few bucks to make things more interesting.</TE>
<TE>   As their brother David, 49, of Tehachapi said goodbye, he also
expressed gratitude for the additional time his father was given to
spend with family.</TE>
<TE>   And Arthur's wife of 50 years, who 16 years earlier had whispered
into his ear that a new heart had been found for him and that it was
not yet time for him to leave, knew that there would be no miracle
this time.</TE>
<TE>   She told him that the pain he had endured during his final days
would soon be gone, and that he would be at peace. And then she said
what everyone around her felt: "I'm going to miss you."</TE>
<TE>   Schoenberg will be honored at 2 p.m. Sunday at the UCLA Faculty
Center, on campus at 480 Charles Young Drive.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his wife and children, Schoenberg is survived by
eight grandchildren and two brothers, Robert and Theodor.</TE>
<TE>   According to the United Network for Organ Sharing, based in
Richmond, Va., 542 people 65 or older now await donor hearts. Of
those, 109 are from California.</TE>

<HD>Police Arrest Shelter Chief in Tenant Dispute</HD>
<DH>Downtown: Head of nonprofit organization is detained after
she intervenes in a conflict at one of the largest of skid row's
hotels.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was a new experience for Charlene Gowers, head of a nonprofit
organization that runs a downtown Los Angeles skid row hotel: Caught
in a dispute between two tenants, she found herself handcuffed and
hauled away in a squad car Wednesday night.</LD>
<LD>   As executive director of Shelter First, which owns one of the
largest of skid row's hotels, Gowers, 45, says she has gotten along
well with the police in the past and needs their cooperation to
operate her facility on 7th Street. It houses 550 tenants, including
many families with children, for rates of about $250 a month. Shelter
First is supported through private donations and by several
foundations.</LD>
<LD>   The dispute, as both Gowers and Los Angeles Police Department
spokesman John Pasquariello described it Friday, concerned whether a
woman was entitled to be admitted to a room she had occupied with her
husband up until a few days before. Her husband, who was at work at
the time, had asked that she be kept out because he feared she would
take his belongings to sell for drug money.</LD>
<TE>   But Pasquariello said the officers obtained from the desk clerk
rental papers showing that both the husband and wife had paid a
month's rent for the room, and that she had received mail there
before leaving May 31 to enter a rehab clinic.</TE>
<TE>   Under those circumstances, the police spokesman said, keeping the
woman out of the room constituted an illegal lockout. Gowers, who
drove in from her home in Santa Monica to discuss the matter about 11
p.m., met officers in front of the hotel and told them she was ready
to go to jail before agreeing to let the woman in.</TE>
<TE>   "The sergeant finally asked Ms. Gowers if there was anything he
could say or do to change her mind, and she said, 'No, you're going
to have to take me to jail.' "</TE>
<TE>   The officer then took out handcuffs and arrested her on suspicion
of illegally locking out a tenant, a misdemeanor. Gowers, however,
then moved to enter the hotel lobby, saying she wanted witnesses to
see the arrest.</TE>
<TE>   At this point, Pasquariello said, "The officer took hold of the
defendant's right wrist and left sweatshirt sleeve.... He used a firm
grip along with his body weight to hold her against the door to
control and handcuff her."</TE>
<TE>   Gowers, however, characterized the action as violent and said the
officer told her, when she complained: "Shut up and get in the car."</TE>
<TE>   "It was all unnecessary," she said. "The violence was shocking to
me."</TE>
<TE>   Pasquariello said, "We were extremely patient; we gave her
opportunities to observe the law, and we subsequently used a minor
amount of force. We cannot deviate from the law, especially with
tenants' rights, and this woman had a legal right to be in the
apartment."</TE>
<TE>   Gowers said she does not intend to file a complaint against
police. She was released on her own recognizance.</TE>

<HD>Hospital Workers Launch 4-Day Strike at St. Francis</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAIRE LUNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amid a surge of nurses union activity statewide, dozens of nurses and
therapists launched a four-day strike Friday at St. Francis Medical
Center, the second walkout there in a month.</LD>
<LD>   Workers at the Lynwood facility contend that union contract
negotiations have stalled, although at least two bargaining sessions
are set for later this month.</LD>
<LD>   Hospital management has proposed a three-year contract, but
members of the Service Employees International Union want a two-year
agreement so that in 2004 they can bargain collectively with dozens
of hospitals statewide. Those hospitals have recently signed
contracts that end in two years. Workers also hope that a final
contract will include a guarantee of outside arbitration for future
staffing disputes, which hospital officials said they will not
provide.</LD>
<TE>   Officials at the 384-bed hospital said the strike would not
disrupt the facility's services. A hospital spokeswoman said the
strike shows that the union is more interested in its own agenda than
in securing a contract that benefits its members.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems like we're part of some statewide strategy, and we're
not going to be distracted by those kinds of tactics," said
spokeswoman Carol Lee Thorpe. "We're trying to focus on the
negotiations at hand."</TE>
<TE>   Union representatives expect nearly 300 workers to participate
before the strike ends Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm in this for the long haul," said Mary Newton, a case manager
at St. Francis for 15 years. "I'll keep coming out here as often as
it takes to fight for justice, for patients and for ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   Up to 80 workers at the Robert F. Kennedy Medical Center in
Hawthorne will join the walkout Monday. The Daughters of Charity
Health System owns both hospitals.</TE>

<HD>County to Increase Terror Response</HD>
<DH>Funding: Health officials plan to use federal aid to
improve preparations in case of biological attack.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County government expects a $1-million infusion of federal
aid to help public health officials do a better job of detecting and
responding to bioterrorism threats.</LD>
<LD>   Public Health Department officials have already received $200,000
and anticipate an additional $830,000 in coming weeks, Paul Lorenz,
the department's director, said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The first chunk of money will be used to hire two new county
employees--an administrator and a physician--who will coordinate
efforts to fight bioterrorism. Other dollars will be spent upgrading
the county's ability to rapidly detect a terrorist event and alert
health-care providers and the public, Lorenz said.</LD>
<TE>   With the county facing a multimillion dollar budget shortfall, the
federal assistance is welcome, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "This clearly will not only allow us to respond effectively, but
it will strengthen our day-to-day capacity for tracking illnesses and
community health problems," Lorenz said.</TE>
<TE>   The initial focus will be on creating a computer database that
could give health officials early warning about a bioterrorism
attack. The system would rely on regular reporting of unexplained
illnesses and absences by school administrators, governments and
large businesses, said Dr. Robert Levin, the county's public health
officer.</TE>
<TE>   "We need a better capacity to gather information about illness
that would give us a hint that something is going on," Levin said.
"And we need a greater ability to talk to doctors across the county,
maybe with bulletins for things we are suspicious about and things to
be alert for."</TE>
<TE>   Plans also call for upgraded laboratory facilities to handle tests
for suspicious diseases and stockpiling drugs used to treat anthrax
infections and illnesses such as small pox, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The $1-million grant is Ventura County's share of $12.1 million
that the state is distributing to help local governments prepare for
the possibility of a bioterrorist attack. Local governments will
split another $48.6 million once the state's own bioterrorism
response plan is approved by the federal Centers for Disease Control.</TE>
<TE>   The county's bioterrorism administrator would be paid about
$65,000, Lorenz said. Salary for the physician slot would depend on
experience and skills, he said. It may be difficult to fill the
medical job because counties up and down the state will be competing
for doctors who specialize in detecting patterns of illness, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The bioterrorism specialist will work closely with Levin on
"hundreds of big and little things that need to be done," the public
health officer said.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, Levin said, the county must develop a cache of
certain medications should the need arise. But health officials can't
just set aside boxes of drugs in a closet, he said, because they
would eventually lose their effectiveness.</TE>
<TE>   The alternative is to ask dozens of private drug stores to
cooperate in keeping a rotating cache of pharmaceuticals on hand, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement officials said they, too, are expecting federal
aid to help them combat terrorism. Sheriff Bob Brooks said money may
be available in the next budget cycle.</TE>
<TE>   Any federal help is appropriate, Brooks said: "In the attacks on
the World Trade Center, the federal government stepped in only after
the initial local effort. Much of the war on terrorism is going to be
fought on the local level."</TE>

<DH>Linguistics: Berkeley workshop opens the door for members
of California tribes to try to revive or maintain fast-disappearing
ancestral tongues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONE TEMPEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERKELEY</DL>
<LD>Kelina Lobo is on a personal mission to revive the lost language of
her ancestors.</LD>
<LD>   When she has children, the 30-year-old Lobo said, she intends to
make Ajachmem--the Indian dialect once spoken in what is now San Juan
Capistrano--the exclusive voice of her household. But first she must
lift the language from the dead.</LD>
<LD>   Marnie Atkins has a more modest dream. "I would just like to speak
to my creator in my language. Just one small prayer," she said.</LD>
<TE>   Atkins, also 30, belongs to the tiny Wiyot tribe in coastal
Humboldt County whose language died out decades ago, accelerated by
one of the most brutal genocides in California history.</TE>
<TE>   The two women were among 50 people from 29 tribes who gathered at
UC Berkeley last week for the "Breath of Life--Silent No More"
workshop on California Indian languages.</TE>
<TE>   Most of those attending represented tribes whose languages are
dormant, dying or dead. Of the 100 Indian languages of old
California, fewer than 50 are still spoken, and that number is
declining rapidly.</TE>
<TE>   "Every California language is in danger," said UC Berkeley
linguistics professor Leanne Hinton, who organized the workshop. "In
most cases, we are down to just a handful of elders."</TE>
<TE>   When those people die, Hinton predicts, most of those languages
will vanish completely unless the tribes do something to keep them
alive.</TE>
<TE>   The recovery of lost language also provides insight into forgotten
ways of thinking.</TE>
<TE>   Lobo learned, for example, that her people used similar words for
human hands and the front hoofs of animals. "You can see how they
viewed animals as sentient beings, similar to humans," she said.</TE>
<TE>   There are also limits in Ajachmem preventing humans from claiming
possession of basic things, such as sand or water. "In our language,
it is impossible to say 'My sand,' " Lobo explained.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, there are 20 ways to say "carry"--reflecting
the basic hunter-gatherer nature of early Ajachmem culture.</TE>
<TE>   The only California tribes that teach their children the native
language at home, Hinton said, are the Northern Paiutes and the Owens
Valley Paiutes, who live along the border with Nevada. But most
Paiute speakers live in Nevada and neighboring states. Lost, perhaps
forever, is the great wealth of uniquely California
languages--including the Southern California Chumash, Tongva,
Ajachmem and Tataviam tongues.</TE>
<TE>   The Berkeley workshop offered participants a way to revive or
maintain the languages without the benefit of native speakers who
once passed them from generation to generation.</TE>
<TE>   In a weeklong crash course, the Native Californians were taught a
basic phonetic alphabet to enable them to read and write their
languages and were instructed in the grammatical structure. And,
perhaps most important, they were introduced to existing scholarship
on their languages and culture.</TE>
<TE>   "The goal is for California Indians to be able to see, access and
use publications in their languages collected by linguists and
anthropologists over the years," said Hinton, the author of two books
on California Indian languages, including a self-help manual titled
"How to Keep Your Language Alive."</TE>
<TE>   The lost-language workshop, the fifth since 1997, is one of
several initiatives launched by Hinton, who began her Native American
linguistic research in the late 1960s with the Havasupai tribe near
the Grand Canyon, recording and documenting its traditional songs.</TE>
<TE>   At a 1991 Indian language conference in Marin County, Hinton was
dismayed as she watched elders of several California tribes come
forward as the last living speakers of their tongues.</TE>
<TE>   Later, she helped create Advocates for Indigenous California
Language Survival to maintain and reclaim native California tongues.
One project pairs native speakers with students in a
master-apprentice relationship, similar to one tailored for
handicrafts by the California Arts Council. Another places linguists
at UC Berkeley and other institutions to act as mentors for Native
Californians intent on resurrecting their languages.</TE>
<TE>   Berkeley publisher Malcolm Margolin credits Hinton with breaking
down long-existing barriers between academicians and Native
Americans, who are accustomed to being questioned and studied by
scholars, but usually are not encouraged to use the research results
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "Leanne has created a system for language renewal that is really
different from what linguists usually do," said Margolin, who
produces a quarterly magazine on California Indian affairs. "It is
more of an applied linguistics with great public involvement."</TE>
<TE>   The academic connection is important because, even in cases in
which no living speakers remain, there is often extensive academic
field work and research material, including wax recordings and
phonetically rendered dictionaries of the lost languages.</TE>
<TE>   Marnie Atkins, for example, said she was delighted this week to
see the microfilmed field notes on her Wiyot tribe from John P.
Harrington, a California linguist who studied Indian languages from
1905 to 1954 for the Smithsonian Institution's Bureau of American
Ethnology. Harrington, who said he mastered 18 California Indian
languages, left a large body of work, much of which can be found in
the Bancroft Library and Hearst Museum at UC Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   "Harrington was writing about one of the places I'm trying to
protect," said Atkins, who is cultural director at the small tribal
property south of Eureka. The Wiyots, nearly wiped out by an 1860
massacre on an island in Humboldt Bay that was documented by the
young California writer Bret Harte, spoke a language related to the
Algonquian languages of the American Northeast.</TE>
<TE>   After attending a lost-language workshop at Berkeley with her
father in 1997, Kelina Lobo become more determined than ever to
unlock the mystery of her ancestral tongue, Ajachmem. The Lobos
descend from a line of tribal leaders from the San Juan Capistrano
area. Not one of the 1,700 registered members of the Ajachmem tribe
speaks the language.</TE>
<TE>   To arm herself for the task, Lobo recently obtained master's
degrees in linguistics and education from UC Berkeley. She is now
studying Luiseno, a sister language from the same Southern California
region.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to the efforts of a native Luiseno speaker, Villiana Calac
Hyde, who died in 1994, and a San Diego area linguist, Eric Elliott,
who become proficient in the language, the study of Luiseno is
enjoying a revival among Native Californians seeking to reconnect
with their culture. Elliott teaches a course on Luiseno at Palomar
College.</TE>
<TE>   By searching through county death registers and collecting phrases
from her father and elder tribal leaders, Lobo has been able to come
up with some understanding of Ajachmem.</TE>
<TE>   Other Native Californian researchers have gone further afield in
search of information on their disappearing culture.</TE>
<TE>   One of the founders of the indigenous language survival movement,
Santa Rosa artist L. Frank Manriquez, traces her roots to the
Ajachmem and Tongva tribes, which were put to work building the
missions for Spanish settlers in San Gabriel and San Juan Capistrano.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to studying Luiseno, Manriquez, whose face is tattooed
with two tear-drop lines under each eye and three lines under her
chin, traveled to Paris in 1993, where she found artifacts on display
at the Musee de l'Homme, a French anthropology museum, that were
collected from the Tongva tribe by 18th century Spanish and French
missionaries.</TE>
<TE>   "The artifacts spoke to me," she said. "It helped wake up our
language for me."</TE>
<TE>   Manriquez carried a file card with a Luiseno expression she is
attempting to memorize: Oomag at yaamaq at oyk. It means, "Enduring
stillness be with you."</TE>

<LD>The last time Southern California's Afghans came together for an
election, more insults were cast than votes.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, it was a different story.</LD>
<LD>   More than 265 Afghan immigrants and Afghan Americans showed up at
the Sayed Jamoladean Mosque in Orange to vote for 10 regional members
of a planned 40-member national council that organizers hope will
become the voice of Afghan Americans.</LD>
<TE>   Afghan community leaders developed plans for the council to
represent the interests of Afghan Americans to emerging political
leaders in Afghanistan, and to advise on how best to rebuild the
nation.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's vote was an exercise in democracy and an expression of
solidarity as voters chose who would become their collective voice,
organizers and voters said.</TE>
<TE>   "This council will be able to help the Afghan community here
because many of them have lived here and over there and know how to
lobby Congress and to be a voice," said Wazhma Noorzayee, 22, a
political science major at UC Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   "In America, everything that is effective has to be done in
groups."</TE>
<TE>   The community first tried to elect representatives in February,
but that Laguna Hills meeting was abandoned minutes after it began
when arguments, heckling and scuffling broke out among the 1,000
people packed into a room designed to hold 700.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the venom came from old arguments from home as critics
condemned creation of the council as an effort by established Afghan
American families to solidify control. Others were accused of being
pro-Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   When private security guards couldn't control the crowd, Orange
County sheriff's deputies shut down the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   The atmosphere Friday was decidedly different. Voters and some
candidates milled about talking and noshing on kebabs near voting
tables set up in a parking lot outside the mosque.</TE>
<TE>   The mood was congenial and hopeful.</TE>
<TE>   "We live here in the United States so we can have an influence on
Afghan policy, but we will not have a direct impact," said Kabir
Mohmand, a Web page designer from Santa Ana who is a candidate for
the council.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope one day we will have a government [in Afghanistan] that
will listen to us."</TE>
<TE>   Anyone age 18 or older born in Afghanistan or with a parent born
in Afghanistan is eligible to vote, organizers said.</TE>
<TE>   Voting continues from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. today at the Family Market
on Reseda Boulevard in Northridge, and from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday
at the Tawhid Mosque in San Diego.</TE>

<HD>2 Killed in Airplane Crash on Mountain Near Santa Paula</HD>
<DH>Accident: Bodies of a man and a woman are found in the
wreckage. Aircraft was registered to an Ojai couple, but the victims'
identities have not been released.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Two bodies were found Friday in the wreckage of a single-engine plane
that crashed on a rugged mountain slope about five miles south of
Santa Paula Airport.</LD>
<LD>   Recovery crews found the bodies of a man and a woman after an oil
field worker spotted the wreckage of the blue-and-white plane near
South Mountain Road about 11:50 a.m., Ventura County Sheriff's
Department spokesman Eric Nishimoto said.</LD>
<LD>   It was not clear when the 1977 Grumman AA-5B crashed. There were
no reports of overdue or missing planes at the airport, said Bruce
Nelson, an operations manager with the Federal Aviation
Administration.</LD>
<TE>   But aviation and law enforcement officials believe the plane may
have taken off from Santa Paula Airport hours before the wreckage was
reported.</TE>
<TE>   "When we got the call, we responded with one of our helicopters,"
Nishimoto said. "It sounds like a pretty rugged area. We actually had
to have someone from the helicopter rappel down."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County coroner officials responded to the remote crash
site Friday afternoon, but there was no confirmation on the
identities of the bodies by Friday evening.</TE>
<TE>   The plane was registered to Ojai residents Charles Curtis, 74, and
his wife Barbara Curtis, 68, according to FAA records.</TE>
<TE>   The couple were seen at Santa Paula Airport on Friday morning, and
their truck was parked in a hangar they had rented for the last 2 1/2
years, according to friends and airport officials.</TE>
<TE>   A neighbor at the Curtis' mobile home park in Ojai said the
couple, known as Chuck and Brandy, had planned to leave town for a
few days.</TE>
<TE>   "I just saw Brandy this morning," said a woman who lives next door
but asked not to be identified. "She came over and asked if I could
pick up their mail. She said they were taking their plane out of
town. I told them to be careful."</TE>
<TE>   Another friend said the couple had planned to fly north to Minden,
Nev., near Lake Tahoe and the California state line.</TE>
<TE>   "They liked flying different places and said they were looking for
some place fun," Janet Schaefer said.</TE>
<TE>   The Curtis' mobile home was closed tight Friday, with all the
doors locked and blinds drawn.</TE>
<TE>   "We're hoping they are somewhere else, not up there on that hill,"
said Bill Chatham, a retired Navy pilot and Santa Clarita resident.</TE>
<TE>   As news of the wreckage spread through the rural airport, office
workers and other employees scanned the distant mountainside with
binoculars. Some pilots flew over the area to get a better look.</TE>
<TE>   Rowena Mason, president of the airport association, said the
Curtises were regular fliers who showed up about once a week. FAA
records show Charles Curtis had a commercial pilot's license.</TE>
<TE>   The FAA and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating
the crash, Nelson said, but said it could be months before officials
know the cause.</TE>

<HD>Nurse, U.S. Man Killed in Philippine Hostage Rescue</HD>
<DH>Asia: A third captive, the slain American's wife, is hurt.
U.S. says it was not involved.</DH>

<DL>ZAMBOANGA CITY, Philippines</DL>
<LD>A Kansas missionary and a Philippine nurse held hostage for more than
a year by Islamic rebels were shot dead Friday as Philippine troops
attacked the kidnappers in the jungle, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   A second American hostage, missionary Gracia Burnham, 43, was shot
in the leg during the two-hour firefight on the island of Mindanao
but was rescued and taken by U.S. helicopter to a nearby military
hospital.</LD>
<LD>   Col. Renato Padua, who led the raid, said hostages Martin Burnham,
42, Gracia's husband, and nurse Deborah Yap were executed by the Abu
Sayyaf rebels during the battle. The kidnappers had threatened to
kill the hostages if there was a rescue attempt.</LD>
<TE>   "We tried our best to get all the hostages safely, but the
kidnappers were like wild animals," Padua said. "We tried to save
Martin and Yap, but they were shot and mercilessly killed by the Abu
Sayyaf."</TE>
<TE>   In Manila, however, National Security Advisor Roilo Golez said the
government was not in a position to say how the two hostages died or
whether they were hit by army bullets intended for the rebels.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the army mounted the raid because of concern that
the kidnappers were on the verge of escaping from troops that had
encircled them. The rebels quietly slipped past the army weeks ago
and took the hostages to Mindanao from Basilan island, where they had
been holed up for nearly a year. The Burnhams, who had lived as
missionaries in the Philippines for years, were kidnapped from a
seafront hotel while celebrating their 18th wedding anniversary.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. troops stationed on Basilan and Mindanao islands to train and
assist the Philippine army were not involved in the rescue attempt,
both American and Philippine officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "We had no forces on the ground at the site of the firefight,"
said Navy Lt. Cmdr. Barbara Burfeind, a Pentagon spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. military has for months been sharing sophisticated
intelligence equipment with the Philippine forces and teaching them
tracking skills to aid in their search for the rebels. But the extent
of U.S. participation in Friday's operation was unclear.</TE>
<TE>   Philippine officials said the U.S. provided intelligence that
helped pinpoint the location of the hostages, and helped with
equipment, planning, technical assistance and advice for the rescue
attempt. Burfeind said the Americans were aware of an overall
operation to search part of the Zamboanga peninsula but that the gun
battle took place when Philippine troops unexpectedly came upon
rebels in the jungle, not during a planned raid.</TE>
<TE>   Military Policy Debate</TE>
<TE>   The death of the two hostages is likely to renew debate in
Washington and Manila over whether and how the Bush administration
should deepen its military involvement in the Philippines.</TE>
<TE>   Marvin Ott, an Asia expert at the National War College in
Washington, said the deaths of the two hostages "could play out
several ways."</TE>
<TE>   "Some will say this shows the Philippine army needs all the help
it can get, and proves the need for a forward-leaning presence in
Asia," he said. "Others will say it shows the kind of trouble you get
into in places like this. You wind up with blood on your hands, and
it's better to just stay out."</TE>
<TE>   Philippine armed forces Chief of Staff Roy Cimatu defended his
troops despite the hostages' deaths. "It was really a successful
operation," he said in Manila, according to today's edition of the
Philippine Daily Tribune. "We wanted to have a very safe rescue
operation, but unfortunately there were some casualties."</TE>
<TE>   Military spokesman Brig. Gen. Eduardo Purificacion said the rescue
of Gracia Burnham was a "big achievement of the armed forces because
the end of the Abu Sayyaf is near."</TE>
<TE>   The Abu Sayyaf, a loose-knit group with several hundred members,
says it wants to form an Islamic state in the southern Philippines.
Kidnapping for ransom, however, is its main activity. The group was
connected to Osama bin Laden during the mid-1990s, but no evidence
has become public of a recent link between them.</TE>
<TE>   The group first gained international notoriety in April 2000 when
it abducted 21 hostages, most of them foreigners, from the Malaysian
diving resort of Sipadan. The rebels received more than $20 million
in ransom, which they spent in part on faster boats and better
weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Kidnapped in May 2001</TE>
<TE>   On May 27, 2001, the gang snatched Martin and Gracia Burnham from
their hotel on the resort island of Palawan. The kidnappers also
seized tourist Guillermo Sobero of Corona, Calif., and 17 Filipino
hostages. A few days later they kidnapped Yap on Basilan.</TE>
<TE>   The kidnappers took the hostages many hours by speedboat to
Basilan, where they eluded soldiers by hiding in the dense jungle.
After several weeks, they beheaded Sobero. Over the months, they
released some hostages for ransom and beheaded others until only the
Burnhams and Yap remained captive. The Burnhams' family is believed
to have paid ransom of $300,000 to free the couple in March, but the
deal reportedly went awry and the money is missing.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo's repeated
claims that she would "crush" the rebels, the gang has consistently
outmaneuvered government forces.</TE>
<TE>   As part of its war against terrorism, the United States deployed
1,000 troops in the southern Philippines to train and assist the
Philippine army in combating the Abu Sayyaf and freeing the hostages.</TE>
<TE>   The American troops can defend themselves if attacked, but they
cannot engage in combat under the Philippine Constitution. The
mission is scheduled to end July 31, and U.S. officials have
indicated that they might not extend it.</TE>
<TE>   The Philippine army did not disclose that the rebels had escaped
from Basilan with their hostages to Zamboanga del Norte province on
Mindanao. With help from the U.S. forces, the Philippine special
forces unit known as Scout Rangers tracked the kidnappers down to a
densely forested area near the town of Sirawai, about 50 miles north
of Zamboanga City.</TE>
<TE>   Soldiers discovered footprints in the mud Friday and followed them
until they found about 50 kidnappers and the hostages. Pvt. Rene
Mabilog, one of the Scout Rangers, told the Associated Press that the
soldiers crept within 30 yards of the rebels and attacked.</TE>
<TE>   'We Opened Fire'</TE>
<TE>   "When we saw that the two Americans were there, our [commanding
officer] gave us the order to open fire," said Mabilog, who was
wounded in the raid. "We opened fire, and they fought back."</TE>
<TE>   Padua, the Scout Ranger commander, said the rebels used the
hostages as shields and began firing at his soldiers, wounding seven.</TE>
<TE>   "We held back our fire, but my snipers positioned themselves to
get a better view of the gunmen holding the hostages," he said. "The
Abu Sayyaf shot Martin and the woman. And then the kidnappers aimed
their weapons at Gracia, but we took down her captors."</TE>
<TE>   Padua said his men killed four kidnappers during the clash.</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear from his account why the kidnappers shot the
hostages if they were using them as shields. It also was unclear how
Gracia Burnham was shot in the leg. After Gracia's wound was treated,
she was flown to Manila, where she is expected to meet with Arroyo.
Martin Burnham's body was flown to Okinawa, Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the army is pursuing the Abu Sayyaf and will no
longer be constrained in its tactics by worries about the hostages'
safety. Padua said the rebels have split into small groups and are
fleeing through the jungle.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a search-and-destroy operation," said Golez, the national
security advisor. "This time it is a no-holds-barred operation
because there are no hostages."</TE>
<TE>   Arroyo called the Burnhams' relatives in the United States to tell
them the news of Martin's death. "She expressed her condolences to us
and that she is very sorry," Paul Burnham, Martin's father, said in a
radio interview from Wichita, Kan.</TE>
<TE>   Arroyo also called President Bush in Washington to notify him.</TE>
<TE>   "She assured me that the Philippine government would hold the
terrorist group accountable for how they treated these
Americans--that justice would be done," Bush told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   In Manila, Arroyo said she saluted the "forbearance and courage"
of the Philippine troops.</TE>
<TE>   "I commiserate with the Burnham and Yap families. This has been a
long and painful trial for them, for our government, for our country.
Our soldiers tried their best to hold their fire for safety. We shall
not stop until the Abu Sayyaf is finished."</TE>

<HD>Ranchers Feeling the Heat</HD>
<DH>Branding is a tradition in cattle country, but animal
rights groups call it barbaric. Technology may ride to the rescue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ROSE, Neb.</DL>
<LD>An hour before sunup, under the wide prairie sky, the Shovel Dot
Ranch is still. The hills are draped in shadow. Then, a rumble.
Distant pounding.</LD>
<LD>   The cattle come surging over a rise, bulky, bellowing, the calves
unsure, their mamas, panicked, pushing them forward. Cowboys in the
saddle thunder beside, yelling "hey," yelling "yep, yep, yep,"
driving the herd toward the corral. The horses snort, the cattle low,
and they all barrel in. The gate swings shut. The noise swells, thick
as the dust.</LD>
<LD>   It's branding day at Shovel Dot.</LD>
<TE>   Over the next eight hours, with the help of their neighbors,
brothers Larry and Homer Buell will burn their ranch's insignia into
the rumps of 800 calves.</TE>
<TE>   Swapping stories, swatting sweat, the ranchers fall into a
routine: Lasso a calf. Drag it from the corral. Wrestle it onto its
back. Vaccinate. Castrate, if it's a male. Then press a red-hot
branding iron to its left hip. Hold it, smoking, for three long
seconds, as the smell of singed hair rises. Let go. Rope another.</TE>
<TE>   The routine has changed little since great-grandfather Benjamin
Franklin Buell staked out the Shovel Dot in the Sand Hills of
north-central Nebraska in 1883. Counting 6-year-old Ashly, who rode
out on the roundup in her red cowboy boots, six generations of Buells
have worked to the same timeless rhythm each spring.</TE>
<TE>   The family treasures the tradition. But the tradition is under
threat.</TE>
<TE>   Pressured by animal rights advocates who call branding barbaric,
major restaurant and grocery chains will meet this summer to consider
a ban on buying beef from cattle that have been branded. Burger King
already has urged its suppliers to stop branding. This fall, the
chain will consider making the request mandatory.</TE>
<TE>   In response, researchers are scrambling to come up with
alternative IDs that the cattle industry will accept.</TE>
<TE>   So far, they have tried everything from microchip implants to
retinal scans to ear tags imprinted with bar codes--only to run into
resistance from ranchers who find the devices impractical, or
government regulators wary that they could contaminate beef.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most promising devices on the market are microchips
that are clipped to an ear tag or injected into the first chamber of
a cow's stomach.</TE>
<TE>   They can carry an animal's complete health records, updated by
hand-held computer at each treatment. They also can track each cow's
location as it moves from pasture to feedlot to slaughter. And the
information can be stored online.</TE>
<TE>   Intrigued by the potential to trace and contain disease outbreaks
through such databases, the U.S. Department of Agriculture soon will
begin studying how to standardize several competing technologies.</TE>
<TE>   So, many in cattle country suspect that it's only a matter of
time--years, not decades--before branding becomes a museum exhibit,
like spinning wool or forging horseshoes.</TE>
<TE>   Here on the Shovel Dot Ranch, that does not go over well.</TE>
<TE>   Co-owners Homer and Larry Buell brand their herd for practical
reasons. They believe it's the only permanent, tamper-proof,
affordable way to identify the 1,400 heifers--and all the
calves--they run on 30,000 acres.</TE>
<TE>   But the decision to brand is not wholly economic. There's an
emotional tug to it too.</TE>
<TE>   Branding day is the capstone of the spring--a chance to mark,
quite literally, a job well done, a new calf brought into the herd.
There's pride in seeing that Shovel Dot logo--a stylized shovel with
a dot in the center--on so many animals.</TE>
<TE>   After months of lonely labor--helping cows give birth at midnight,
feeding a wobbly newborn at 3 a.m.--branding day is a rare
opportunity to connect with neighbors, to pull on a beer, to shoot
the breeze.</TE>
<TE>   The kids turn out in their Wranglers and leather chaps. It's a
chance to teach them what's already in their blood, to watch as the
11-year-old ropes his first calf, as the second-grader, grunting,
pins a 250-pound Hereford to the ground.</TE>
<TE>   It's a chance to ride hard across the range. A chance to put aside
the all-terrain vehicles and the spreadsheets, the genetics charts
and the online market updates--a chance to feel, for a grungy, gritty
morning, like a cowboy.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Buell's daughter Devon Nelson, 23, smiles at her little girl
in the red boots and says she hopes Ashly will be pressing the Shovel
Dot brand into calves when she is grown.</TE>
<TE>   "It's our heritage," she explains. "This keeps you in touch with
the way things were."</TE>
<TE>   Little Sign of Trauma</TE>
<TE>   The cattle moan when they're branded. They roll their eyes. They
flinch. Their tongues hang out. They jerk.</TE>
<TE>   Most are just 2 to 4 weeks old; a few still trail the dried-up
remnants of their umbilical cords. Smoke curls up as the iron is
applied.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, flames shoot out. The musty odor of burned hair hangs
heavy.</TE>
<TE>   The branding iron burns a scar in their hides the reddish-brown
color of saddle leather. The scar may remain inflamed for months.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the calves show little sign of trauma. As soon as they're
released, they head for their mothers--gimpy for a few steps, then
trotting. Within minutes, they're poking around the pasture, placid
as ever.</TE>
<TE>   Homer Buell knows that ranchers sometimes miss signs of livestock
suffering. "When you're born on a ranch and raised on a ranch, you
can become hardened."</TE>
<TE>   So, with a cautious respect, he listens to outsiders.</TE>
<TE>   Years back, he stopped using "hot shots"--electric cattle
prods--when activists pointed out they were cruel. He has stopped
hitting cows to get them moving. Instead, he just slows down. "We do
things a little better now because of the push for humane treatment,"
he says.</TE>
<TE>   But branding? It's how he keeps track of his assets. How he
markets them too: When his cattle march through the auction ring with
livestock from dozens of competing ranches, buyers study the brands
before bidding. They know what quality to expect from each ranch.</TE>
<TE>   "You've essentially signed your name to the cattle," auctioneer
Bim Nelson says.</TE>
<TE>   Buell doesn't see any reason to stop.</TE>
<TE>   After all, hot-iron body branding has become a chic new form of
tattoo art. People pay $150 an hour to sear away the skin on their
chest, arms or buttocks with the same technique used on cattle.</TE>
<TE>   They describe the process as euphoric, addictive--"a really
intense, wonderful, ecstatic experience," branding artist Meg Mass
says. So ranchers are a bit scornful of the notion that it's vicious
to calves.</TE>
<TE>   "It's easy to say, 'We should never brand animals, it's inhumane,'
when you're sipping wine in Los Angeles--and your 18-year-old has
tattoos all up and down his arm and a nose ring too," says Don
Reeves, a curator at the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum
in Oklahoma City.</TE>
<TE>   "We've tried hard to listen to what [the animal rights activists]
have to say," Nelson adds. "But when it comes to branding, we have to
draw the line."</TE>
<TE>   "You never say never," Buell says. "[But] I really can't see how
any other form of identification would work as well."</TE>
<TE>   Letters of the Law</TE>
<TE>   Branding is used mostly in the vast rangeland west of the Missouri
River. Several states--including Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado
and Wyoming--require that all cattle grazed on open range be branded.
That's the law in western Nebraska as well.</TE>
<TE>   Out here, where the stocky Sand Hills run unbroken to the horizon,
ranchers complain that using microchips or bar codes is impractical.
With brands, they can keep track of their animals from a distance,
scanning a herd from a pickup.</TE>
<TE>   The high-tech IDs, however, can be read only at close range. To
sort through a herd, a rancher would have to drive the cattle miles
to the nearest corral and run them through a chute. Some assert
that's more traumatic to the livestock than one quick brand. It also
takes a lot more time.</TE>
<TE>   Another big concern is theft. It's easy, in this expanse, for a
rustler to pull up to a remote pasture and load livestock onto his
trailer.</TE>
<TE>   All told, Nebraska brand inspectors last year returned 799 stolen
or lost cattle--worth nearly $1.2 million--to their rightful owners.</TE>
<TE>   Without brands as safeguards, "it will be open season on our
livestock," inspector Steven Stanec says.</TE>
<TE>   He and others worry that it's too easy to tamper with the new
IDs--to pull out ear tags and crush microchips.</TE>
<TE>   Devices implanted in stomachs or legs are much harder to destroy.
But slaughterhouses refuse to process cattle that have internal IDs,
for fear the glass-encased implants will get mixed up in someone's
hamburger or sausage.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the issue of price: Branding costs little more than
the labor, but the new IDs run $2 to $7 per animal.</TE>
<TE>   For the moment, "we don't have a reasonable system to replace
branding," says Janice Swanson, an animal sciences professor at
Kansas State University. Still, she and others don't doubt that the
technology is coming.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, we can make the case that it's not practical to use
alternatives to branding. Five years from now, it will be harder to
make that case," says Nebraska rancher Allen Bright, who chairs a
national cattlemen's committee concerning the issue.</TE>
<TE>   The shift can't come quickly enough for animal rights activist
Bruce Friedrich, with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the only question we should be asking is what's
easiest for the rancher," he says. "We should be asking, is branding
animal abuse? And there's no question that it is."</TE>
<TE>   An Ancient Custom</TE>
<TE>   Egyptian tomb paintings, 4,000 years old, show oxen being stamped
with hieroglyphics. Ancient Greeks and Romans branded their
livestock--and their slaves.</TE>
<TE>   It was Spanish explorer Hernando Cortez who first brought the
custom to the Americas, marking cattle with his signature triple
cross.</TE>
<TE>   Now branding stands as a symbol of the Old West.</TE>
<TE>   City slickers longing for an authentic cowboy experience pay to
help brand at dude ranches in Kansas and New Mexico. Or they buy
their own decorative branding irons. Bobby Blanton, a Texas
craftsman, sells plenty, at $170 apiece.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody has a bit of cowboy in them," he says. "Even if you
don't have a herd, it looks good on the fireplace."</TE>
<TE>   On a working ranch, of course, nostalgia is supposed to take a
back seat to profit and convenience.</TE>
<TE>   "The old romance of the chuck wagon as the center of a cowboy's
life got thrown out the window as soon as motorized vehicles gave
them a means to get back to the bunkhouse quickly," says Byron Price,
a historian of the American West at the University of Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything that makes ranching easier and the margin of profit
greater," Price says, "is going to win out, in the end, over
tradition."</TE>
<TE>   And yet, at Shovel Dot on this crisp spring morning, there's a
clear allegiance to tradition.</TE>
<TE>   The branding irons are heating inside homemade propane stoves
instead of over a fire fueled by buffalo manure. There are a few
baseball caps amid the Stetsons. Otherwise, things look as they might
have a century ago.</TE>
<TE>   Two dozen neighbors work in easy friendship, while their kids
chuck dried manure clots at each other in fits of giggles. Fresh-cut
calf testicles, a delicacy, sizzle on top of the propane stoves. Back
at the house, there are endless crock pots of chili and homemade
strawberry pies.</TE>
<TE>   The Buells used to do their branding themselves, immobilizing the
calves with a special table. But they returned years ago to the
old-fashioned rope-and-wrestle approach, which requires the loan of a
good many strong backs and quick hands.</TE>
<TE>   "This is more fun," explains Homer Buell, 52.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels neighborly," adds 51-year-old Larry Buell.</TE>
<TE>   In exchange for the help they get at Shovel Dot, the Buells figure
they spend at least 300 hours each spring branding for neighbors. It
may not pencil out as profitable, but they think of these branding
days as an investment in community. An investment in tradition.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a way of life," neighbor Trevor Smith says.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, 23, is studying animal sciences at the University of
Nebraska and is helping his father raise Angus. He has heard much
about the microchip IDs, and he's enthusiastic about their promise
for tracking health records.</TE>
<TE>   But Smith looks around at the controlled chaos on Shovel
Dot--calves bellowing, irons smoking, ropes twirling, dirt flying
every which way--and says he can't ever see quitting branding. "This
is just the way it is."</TE>

<LD>This is going to be worse than we thought.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers played a fairly consistent game--Shaquille O'Neal did,
anyway--and there was nothing the New Jersey Nets could do about it.
The only time they made it interesting was when they made four
consecutive three-point baskets at the beginning of the fourth
quarter.</LD>
<LD>   Is that what it's going to take for them to win? Making
three-pointers on every possession? Can't we stop this?</LD>
<TE>   NBC Sports President Dick Ebersol must be negotiating a deal to
hand the NBA rights over to ABC by Sunday afternoon. Because by 9
p.m. Eastern time that night, fans will be switching off this series
and heading to HBO for "The Sopranos."</TE>
<TE>   After the Lakers' 106-83 victory in Game 2, the series has a
dreadful feel to it. Outside of L.A. and a few pockets of the Garden
State, the NBA Finals just dropped to the bottom of the sports list.
Let's see. Tyson-Lewis, Belmont Stakes, Venus vs. Serena, interleague
play and even the World Cup (Univision broadcasts, of course.
GOOOOOL!!!)</TE>
<TE>   You know things are bad for New Jersey when reporters are asking
the Lakers what the Nets can do differently after the first two
games. Guess it wouldn't make sense to ask the Nets about the
gigantic mismatch in the middle of this series.</TE>
<TE>   "I just don't know what to do about Shaq right now," New Jersey
Coach Byron Scott said.</TE>
<TE>   In the interest of fairness (OK, in the interest of seeing the
Nets win one game so I can spend a couple of more days in New York
this week) here's some things the Nets might want to think about:</TE>
<TE>   * Don't let the Lakers throw the entry pass to O'Neal from half
court. Four or five times, the Lakers took one step into the
frontcourt and tossed the ball to O'Neal standing next to the hoop.
Front him, because it's always riskier to throw a pass over a
defender. It's never too early to double-team him. And with the new
defense rules it's never illegal.</TE>
<TE>   * Try going at O'Neal to get him in foul trouble. It worked for
the Sacramento Kings. It's apparently a foreign concept to the Nets.
Jason Kidd seems scared whenever he gets in the key and the Big Fella
comes over to help. He'll turn away from the basket, and it's pretty
hard to score or draw a foul facing the other way.</TE>
<TE>   They could also try.... ahh, why bother. The only drama left in
this series is for the gamblers worried about the spread.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets have homecourt advantage for the next three games, but
the Lakers have just found the elusive edge they've sought since
December: momentum.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, with only a few more games left," Rick Fox said. "But
that's been the run of the season. The focus was so much on being
healthy this time of the year that we never practiced that much
together. And Phil [Jackson] knew what he was doing. He knew he'd
rather have us healthy with fresh legs at this time of year than run
us into the ground."</TE>
<TE>   Now the Lakers say they feel better than they have all season. You
haven't heard much talk about Shaq's toes as he has scored 76 points
in the first two games.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers are on a roll.</TE>
<TE>   Ever since that miraculous play when Robert Horry made that
buzzer-beating shot in Game 4 of the Western Conference finals, the
Lakers have played well enough to win in each of the next five games,
and they did convert four of those into victories.</TE>
<TE>   As Fox said, "No sense winning the basketball lottery and not
collecting the money."</TE>
<TE>   Said Brian Shaw: "We're playing better in stretches. But I still
don't think we've played our best basketball."</TE>
<TE>   To Shaw, it's like the Raider teams he watched as a kid in
Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   "They would win, but win ugly," Shaw said. "When you can win ugly,
that's a tribute to what kind of team you are. Even on the bad nights
you still find a way to get it done. We've had our share of bad
nights, but the experience and the heart allows us to pull out
games."</TE>
<TE>   Among the things they're doing wrong: not providing scoring off
the bench or keeping the Nets off the offensive glass.</TE>
<TE>   The main thing they're doing right: getting the ball to O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   When that happens, things have a way of working out.</TE>
<TE>   If only it were that easy for the Nets. They don't have anyone
they can count on to get a high-percentage shot. So we're seeing
plenty of long jumpers by Kerry Kittles and mid-range jumpers for
Kenyon Martin.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets are so reliant on fastbreaks, but those are hard to come
by when the Lakers keep going to Shaq for layups and/or free throws.
Even when he misses, they aren't the long rebounds that jump-start
fastbreaks.</TE>
<TE>   And Kidd. Kidd is a great player. He makes his guys better. The
New Jersey offense is built for the ball to be in his hands. The only
problem is, the longer he has it, the worse the Nets are. When he's
shooting, the Lakers are smiling inside.</TE>
<TE>   He's shooting 41% in the playoffs, including 17 for 43 (39.5%) in
these first two games.</TE>
<TE>   At least the Nets keep trying hard. I thought they would heed the
words of the House of Pain song that played in Staples Center before
the fourth quarter ("Pack it up, pack it in ... "), but they came out
with a 14-2 run and cut a one-time 20-point lead down to four. Then
O'Neal returned to the game and the series returned to its natural
order.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't done anything but establish the fact that we're able
to win on our homecourt," Jackson insisted.</TE>
<TE>   That's like saying Denzel Washington's Oscar established the fact
that he can act.</TE>
<TE>   We knew that already, just like we knew the Lakers could defeat
the Nets here or in the swamp.</TE>
<TE>   "They haven't played their best game yet," Kidd said. "We haven't
played our best game."</TE>
<TE>   True, true. But if both of those things happen next game, we know
what the outcome will be.</TE>

<HD>2004 NBA All-Star Game Coming to L.A.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The 53rd NBA All-Star game is coming to Staples Center in 2004, which
is good news for Los Angeles but not necessarily for Laker and
Clipper fans.</LD>
<LD>   While it was estimated by officials during Friday's announcement
at Staples Center that the economic impact to the city from the game
will exceed $50 million, very few tickets are expected to be
available to the public.</LD>
<LD>   Before this year's game in Philadelphia, 76er Chairman Ed Snider
said playing host to the All-Star game is a "nightmare" because the
league keeps most of the tickets for its corporate partners, making
the team look bad to its fans.</LD>
<TE>   "If I could give the game back, I would," Snider said at the time.
"I can tell you this for sure: We will never apply for another
All-Star [game]."</TE>
<TE>   Snider said the league kept about 18,000 of the tickets available
in the 20,444-seat First Union Center, leaving many of the 76ers'
longtime season-ticket holders unable to get into the game. The 76ers
have about 16,000 season-ticket holders.</TE>
<TE>   The situation will be exacerbated at Staples Center, which is home
to two NBA teams and seats 18,997 for basketball.</TE>
<TE>   But that didn't stop Staples Center from lobbying for the game,
which was last played in the Southland at the Forum in 1983.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had a lot of great events in this building--the Grammys,
NHL All-Star game this past year, [U.S.] Figure Skating
Championships," Staples Center President Tim Leiweke said Friday.
"For us, the one event that meant the most to us from day one was the
event that was the hardest to get but the one that obviously we're
pleased to announce today, the NBA All-Star game."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Leiweke acknowledged that some fans would be unhappy.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not out to create any unreasonable expectations that you
have two season-ticket bases of 16,000-17,000 fans per team that are
going to participate in getting tickets to the event," he said.
"We're aware of that."</TE>
<TE>   NBA Commissioner David Stern, on hand for the announcement, said
the league reserves "large numbers of tickets" to accommodate its
business partners, echoing comments made last winter by Deputy
Commissioner Russ Granik.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're going to do is try to come up with a program to deal
with as many season-ticket holders as we possibly can," Stern said.
"But in the form of the announcement and the way we're doing it, it
is really designed to minimize expectations with respect to great
tickets for season-ticket holders.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd just be taking Eddie Snider's troubles and squaring them."</TE>
<TE>   In January, after Snider made his comments, Granik said he
sympathized about the ticket-supply problem. Nevertheless, he said,
All-Star weekend is the league's best opportunity to host its
business partners, even if that means local fans can't attend.</TE>
<TE>   "This is our Super Bowl," Granik said. "It's our chance to
entertain."</TE>

<HD>Angels Ride Sele, Defeat Reds, 4-3</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Aaron Sele was on the money Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels gave him an ace contract--$24 million over three
seasons--in the off-season and Sele has begun to resemble that kind
of doughboy.</LD>
<LD>   Early struggles appear to be behind him after Sele cruised through
7 1/3 innings in the Angels' 4-3 victory over the Cincinnati Reds at
Edison Field. The crowd of 35,341 certainly felt as if they got cash
value for their tickets, as they gave Sele an ovation on his way to
the dugout after he was pulled.</LD>
<TE>   "What I try to do every time out is to go six or seven innings and
give the guys a chance," Sele said. "Tonight I was able to do that."</TE>
<TE>   This was the start of interleague play, which brought Cincinnati,
baseball's oldest franchise, to Edison Field for the first time to
face baseball's most star-crossed franchise, at least this side of
Wrigley Field.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels, though, are not much for history lessons. Their
blue-collar approach was enough to handle the Reds.</TE>
<TE>   Sele gave up only two runs. Garret Anderson continued to provide
clutch hits. The Angels survived rally attempts.</TE>
<TE>   The Reds had the winning run at the plate in the last two innings,
but Al Levine wiggled out of the eighth and Troy Percival got through
the ninth for his 12th save.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't see any one on this team leading the league in
anything," said left fielder Anderson, who had a two-run double in
the fourth inning. "We just play good baseball and get good
pitching."</TE>
<TE>   Sele, who won 69 games the previous four seasons, was hardly
overpowering but won for the sixth time in seven decisions. He struck
out five and did not walk a batter.</TE>
<TE>   Sele (6-3) had been roughed up in the early innings for much of
the season, but he retired the first nine batters he faced Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "He showed right away that he was going to put all four of his
pitches in the zone," Manager Mike Scioscia said. "He worked inside
well and threw hard."</TE>
<TE>   Said catcher Jorge Fabregas: "He was great. He was awesome."</TE>
<TE>   The reviews weren't raves when Sele was 0-2 with a 6.65 earned-run
average after four starts. He wasn't being rocked, but was far from
rock solid.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think Aaron was pressing, but there is always an
adjustment period," Scioscia said. "He needed time to learn the
catchers, learn the staff. We made suggestions that we thought might
help him. That adjustment period is over."</TE>
<TE>   The Reds came in as Central Division leaders and left without Ken
Griffey Jr., who suffered a mild strained hamstring running out a
ground ball to prevent a double play in the fourth inning.</TE>
<TE>   With runners on first and second, Griffey hit a chopper to first
baseman Scott Spiezio, who threw to second base. Griffey, who has
already missed 41 games because of an injured right knee, appeared to
hit the bag awkwardly in beating the return throw to first.</TE>
<TE>   Griffey was examined by Dr. Craig Milhouse and is listed as day to
day.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Reds have won without Griffey and the Angels were not
sure what to expect from Chris Reitsma, a pitcher that they had not
seen before.</TE>
<TE>   "We are facing some guys who haven't had a lot years in the major
leagues, so it's hard to have much of a scouting report on them,"
Scioscia said. "We won't know what pitches they throw until we get
into the batter's box and see them."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels figured things out quickly against Reitsma. It took six
batters.</TE>
<TE>   Reitsma (3-3) struck out three of the first six batters he faced.
Spiezio then singled to center to start the third. Fabregas followed
by rolling a single to right on a hit-and-run play and Adam Kennedy's
ground out scored Spiezio.</TE>
<TE>   Things got worse for the Reds. David Eckstein walked and Darin
Erstad beat out a high chopper to second. Troy Glaus singled, scoring
Fabregas, with Eckstein being thrown out at the plate. Anderson then
ripped a line drive that was just beyond the reach of left fielder
Austin Kearns. Erstad and Glaus scored for a 4-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "What we have on this team are guys who don't try to do things
they are not capable of doing," Anderson said. "Everyone on this team
knows what their role is."</TE>
<TE>   And Sele played his.</TE>

<HD>Minor Injury Slowing Salmon</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Tim Salmon was scratched as a starter from Friday's game with what
Manager Mike Scioscia called a mild strain of the hamstring in his
right leg. Salmon, who was pulled for a pinch-runner after doubling
in the ninth inning Thursday against the Texas Rangers, was examined
by Dr. Lewis Yocum afterward.</LD>
<LD>   Salmon, who struck out as a pinch-hitter to end the eighth inning
of Friday's 4-3 victory over Cincinnati, said the injury is minor.</LD>
<LD>   "Scioscia's way is the logical way," Salmon said. "He's going to
err on the side of caution."</LD>
<TE>   Salmon was unsure when he was injured, but said he felt tightness
since the team returned Monday from Minnesota. At first, he
attributed the problem to playing on the artificial surface at the
Metrodome.</TE>
<TE>   "After you play on the turf, you ache all over," Salmon said. "But
this kept bothering me."</TE>
<TE>   That hasn't been evident at the plate. Salmon has a season-high
nine-game hitting streak. He has batted .459 during the streak and
raised his average from .229 to .273.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More from the he's-not-injured file: Pitcher Kevin Appier said he
felt his arm was fatigued during Thursday's game.</TE>
<TE>   "My elbow locked up, which made it so I couldn't finish my
breaking ball," Appier said.</TE>
<TE>   Appier consulted with Yocum and trainer Ned Bergert, who suggested
changes in his delivery. Appier said he has had the same problem in
the past.</TE>
<TE>   "I had never consulted a doctor about it before," Appier said.
"It's a good news, bad news thing. I haven't been pitching well the
last few starts and now I know why. There are two bones in my arm
that don't roll right when I make a certain pitch."</TE>
<TE>   Appier lasted only 2 1/3 innings, giving up seven runs, in the 9-8
loss to the Rangers.</TE>

<TE>   Record vs. SaberCats--0-1.</TE>
<TE>   Update--San Jose is halfway to the first undefeated regular season
in Arena history. (The best regular-season record since the league
went to a 14-game schedule in 1996 is 12-2, which has been done five
times.) Lately the SaberCats aren't just beating teams, they are
crushing them. In the last four games San Jose has won by an average
of 29.8 points, including last week's 63-35 drubbing of Buffalo, and
the SaberCats are on a record scoring pace of 67.4 points a game.
Quarterback Mark Grieb is having an MVP season, completing 145 of 213
passes for 1,930 yards and 43 touchdowns with only two interceptions.
But Los Angeles quarterback Tony Graziani is right behind, completing
150 of 247 passes for 1,989 yards and 38 touchdowns with four
interceptions. The Avengers, who lost, 78-44, to San Jose on May 11,
were defeated last week by Dallas, 62-55. Receiver Greg Hopkins has
taken over the team lead in receptions (52), and offensive specialist
Chris Jackson leads the league in scoring (128 points), receiving
yards (786) and touchdowns (21).</TE>

<HD>Devil Rays' Bierbrodt Shot During Dispute</HD>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tampa Bay Devil Ray pitcher Nick Bierbrodt, a former Long Beach
Millikan High standout, was shot Friday while in a taxi as he waited
in a drive-through line at a fast-food restaurant in Charleston, S.C.</LD>
<LD>   The left-handed pitcher, who was optioned to the Class-A
Charleston RiverDogs on Wednesday, was shot in the chest and in the
right arm shortly after 3 a.m., according to a police report.</LD>
<LD>   Bierbrodt remained in serious condition at the Medical University
of South Carolina late Friday, hospital spokesman Jeff Watkins said.</LD>
<TE>   According to the report, Bierbrodt was in the right rear seat of
the cab when a man rode up beside the cab on a bicycle.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses said there was a verbal exchange between Bierbrodt and
the man, who then fired shots and rode off on the bicycle.</TE>
<TE>   No arrests had been made late Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Bierbrodt's teammate John Vigue was a passenger in the car but was
not injured, Devil Ray General Manager Chuck LaMar said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Cleveland Indians traded infielder-outfielder Russell Branyan
to the Cincinnati Reds for minor league first baseman Ben Broussard.
Branyan, 26, was batting only .205 with eight homers and 17 runs
batted in in 50 games and had struck out 65 times this season. To
make room on the 25-man roster for Branyan, the Reds put right-hander
Jose Rijo on the 15-day disabled list.... Charles Nagy, who pitched
the last two seasons without any cartilage in his right elbow, was
put on the 15-day disabled list by the Indians and might be out for
the season.... The Detroit Tigers agreed to terms with top draft pick
Scott Moore, a 6-foot-2, 180-pound shortstop from Cypress High.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ronald Laitsch, the literary agent for Jose Canseco's planned
tell-all book, predicted the story will earn an advance of $500,000
and estimated a deal with a publisher will probably be signed by the
end of the month.</TE>
<TE>   Laitsch said he and Canseco met with publishers this week in New
York. During those conversations, Laitsch said Canseco promised the
book will document his steroid use during a 462-home run career.
Canseco also divulged names of players who he said used steroids.</TE>
<TE>   "Those names are not for public consumption yet," Laitsch said.
"We've got to have something to sell."</TE>

1. ARTAX TOO (50-1)
                            PP: 1. Jockey: Jose Santos. Trainer:
                            Jennifer Leigh-Pedersen. Owner: Paraneck
                            Stable
                            Record: 5 starts, 2-0-1 (1st-2nd-3rd).
                            Earnings: $59,830. Sire: Marquetry. Dam:
                            Done With Pleasure
                            Comment: The Virginia-bred colt has won
                            two in a row but against much softer
                            competition and deserves to be the
                            longest shot in the field. Norberto
                            Arroyo Jr. was supposed to ride Artax Too
                            in the Belmont but lost the mount when
                            owner Ernie Paragallo became incensed
                            over the jockey's ride on Magnificent Val
                            in a turf race at Belmont last Sunday.
                            The horse was disqualified for obvious
                            interference in the stretch
2. LIKE A HERO (30-1)
                            PP: 2. Jockey: Pat Day. Trainer: Beau
                            Greely. Owner: Columbine Stable
                            Record: 4-3-1-0. Earnings: $118,910.
                            Sire: Pleasant Colony. Dam: Like a Hawk
                            Comment: A victory in the Alydar Stakes,
                            his third in a row, on May 23 at
                            Hollywood Park earned Like A Hero a trip
                            to the Belmont. Regular rider Laffit
                            Pincay chose not to ride him this race
                            as, after the Alydar, he openly
                            questioned whether the colt was ready for
                            Grade I competition. Greely believes Like
                            A Hero will run well at 1 1/2 miles
3. WISEMAN'S FERRY (20-1)
                            PP: 3. Jockey: Jorge Chavez. Trainer:
                            Niall O'Callaghan. Owner: Finks, Sacks &amp;
                            Swifty Farm
                            Record: 9-3-1-2. Earnings: $366,867.
                            Sire: Hennessy. Dam: Emmaus
                            Comment: A winner once in six starts on
                            the turf in England and Ireland, the
                            chestnut has won two of three on the dirt
                            in this country. He has improved with
                            every start and is the most likely pace
                            rival for War Emblem. He was an
                            impressive wire-to-wire winner in the
                            Lone Star Derby run at 1 1/8 miles and
                            won't give up as easily in the Belmont as
                            pace-setter Menacing Dennis did in the
                            Preakness
4. ESSENCE OF DUBAI (30-1)
                            PP: 4. Jockey: Jerry Bailey. Trainer:
                            Saeed bin Suroor. Owner: Godolphin Racing
                            Inc
                            Record: 7-4-0-0. Earnings: $1,543,200.
                            Sire: Pulpit. Dam: Epitome
                            Comment: Like his Godolphin predecessors,
                            Essence Of Dubai was hyped entering the
                            Kentucky Derby, then flopped in the race.
                            He finished ninth, beaten by 13 lengths,
                            after winning two in a row in Dubai. This
                            will be the third mount for Bailey in the
                            Triple Crown. He finished out of the
                            money with Castle Gandolfo in Kentucky
                            and Medaglia d'Oro in the Preakness
5. SUNDAY BREAK (6-1)
                            PP: 5. Jockey: Gary Stevens. Trainer:
                            Neil Drysdale. Owner: Koji Maeda
                            Record: 7-4-1-2. Earnings: $305,220.
                            Sire: Forty Niner. Dam: Catequil
                            Comment: He'll try to do the same thing
                            A.P. Indy, who was also trained by
                            Drysdale, did 10 years ago: Follow a
                            victory in the Peter Pan Stakes with
                            another in the Belmont. Trouble is, this
                            Japanese-bred doesn't appear to be in the
                            same class as A.P. Indy, who went on to
                            win Horse of the Year honors. He beat a
                            suspect field in the Peter Pan and it was
                            his first stakes victory
6. PERFECT DRIFT (8-1)
                            PP: 6. Jockey: Eddie Delahoussaye.
                            Trainer: Murray Johnson. Owner:
                            Stonecrest Farm
                            Record: 7-3-3-1. Earnings: $467,160.
                            Sire: Dynaformer. Dam: Nice Gal
                            Comment: Perfect Drift was held out of
                            the Preakness after finishing third--4
                            3/4 lengths behind War Emblem--in the
                            Kentucky Derby. The horse continues to
                            train well and would likely benefit from
                            a fast, contested pace set by Wiseman's
                            Ferry and War Emblem. Delahoussaye has
                            won two Belmonts, with Risen Star in 1988
                            and A.P. Indy in 1992
8. MEDAGLIA D'ORO (10-1)
                            PP: 7. Jockey: Kent Desormeaux. Trainer:
                            Bobby Frankel. Owner: Ed Gann
                            Record: 7-3-3-1. Earnings: $364,720.
                            Sire: El Prado. Dam: Cappucino Bay
                            Comment: The second betting choice in the
                            Preakness after a troubled trip in the
                            Derby, Medaglia d'Oro ran horribly at
                            Pimlico. He finished more than 17 lengths
                            behind War Emblem and it didn't look as
                            if he would be running in the Belmont.
                            However, Frankel decided to forge ahead,
                            but maybe such an ambitious campaign has
                            caught up to this colt. The Belmont will
                            be his fourth Grade I race in less than
                            two months
9. PROUD CITIZEN (5-1)
                            PP: 8. Jockey: Mike Smith. Trainer: Wayne
                            Lukas. Owner: Robert Baker, David
                            Cornstein and Bill Mack
                            Record: 8-2-2-1. Earnings: $532,117.
                            Sire: Gone West. Dam: Drums Of Freedom
                            Comment: Followed his second-place finish
                            in the Kentucky Derby with a troubled
                            third in the Preakness. At one point in
                            the stretch in the Preakness, it looked
                            as if he might go by War Emblem, but
                            faltered late. He broke his maiden at
                            Belmont by 9 1/4 lengths June 28, but
                            that was against 2-year-old maidens going
                            5 1/2 furlongs
10. WAR EMBLEM (1-1)
                            PP: 9. Jockey: Victor Espinoza. Trainer:
                            Bob Baffert. Owner: Thoroughbred Corp
                            Record: 9-6-0-0. Earnings: $2,891,000.
                            Sire: Our Emblem. Dam: Sweetest Lady
                            Comment: The favorite to become the 12th
                            Triple Crown winner and the first since
                            Affirmed in 1978. He has won four in a
                            row since losing three of his first five
                            career starts, but better 3-year-olds
                            than him have failed to seal the deal
                            after winning the Derby and the
                            Preakness. He'll take heat again up front
                            and the question is whether he will be
                            able to do that and last for 12 furlongs
11. MAGIC WEISNER (15-1)
                            PP: 10. Jockey: Richard Migliore.
                            Trainer: Nancy Alberts. Owner: Nancy
                            Alberts
                            Record: 11-6-3-0. Earnings: $433,110.
                            Sire: Ameri Valay. Dam: Jazema
                            Comment: The Maryland-bred gave his
                            supporters a thrill in the Preakness as
                            he finished strong, closing to claim
                            second at 45-1. The odds will be a lot
                            smaller today and now we'll see if he can
                            run well outside his home state. All his
                            starts have come at either Laurel or
                            Pimlico. He has finished first or second
                            in his last nine races
12. SARAVA (30-1)
                            PP: 11. Jockey: Edgar Prado. Trainer: Ken
                            McPeek. Owner: New Phoenix Stable
                            Record: 8-2-3-0. Earnings: $96,851. Sire:
                            Wild Again. Dam: Rhythm Of Life
                            Comment: Having failed in the first two
                            legs of the Triple Crown with Harlan's
                            Holiday, McPeek tries with this $250,000
                            2-year-old purchase. Sarava won the Sir
                            Barton on the Preakness undercard, but
                            the Belmont will be his first attempt in
                            a graded stakes. Since switching to the
                            dirt after arriving from England, he has
                            not been worse than third in five races,
                            winning twice</TE>

<HD>Triple Jeopardy</HD>
<DH>Even as War Emblem is poised to become first Triple Crown
winner in 24 years, there is concern whether sport can rally in
public eye</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ELMONT, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>The computer man from Tustin was having a mid-evening drink at the
lobby bar of a Manhattan hotel.</LD>
<LD>   The mention of today's Belmont Stakes jogged his memory slightly.</LD>
<LD>   "Oh, yeah, that race," he said. "That's the one that white-haired
guy's got something to do with, isn't it?"</LD>
<TE>   This is the reality for all of racing: Even though a record crowd
of more than 85,000 may attend the Belmont as War Emblem and trainer
Bob Baffert--he's the white-haired guy--shoot for the first Triple
Crown sweep since Affirmed in 1978, the time-warped sport still
operates in a vacuum.</TE>
<TE>   A victim of its own indifference to TV exposure about a generation
ago, and now struggling to retain a dwindling gambling niche in the
face of competition from lotteries and riverboats and Native American
casinos, racing seldom succeeds in capturing the spotlight. When
Secretariat became the ninth of 11 Triple Crown champions by winning
the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness and the Belmont in 1973, he was an
all-around cover boy, his picture splashed on the front of Time and
Newsweek as well as the expected sports publications.</TE>
<TE>   A more immediate litmus test for racing is that Sports Illustrated
hasn't devoted a cover to a horse winning a race since Sunny's Halo's
Derby victory 19 years ago. Don't bet on a victorious War Emblem
making that magazine's cover this time, either. The Mike Tyson-Lennox
Lewis fight tonight in Memphis, Tenn., has more of a cover smell to
it.</TE>
<TE>   No greater champion of racing than trainer Wayne Lukas, who has
won 13 Triple Crown races, questions whether War Emblem can do a
bootstrap number on the sport.</TE>
<TE>   "You could get on almost any airplane, walk up and down the aisle
and ask people about War Emblem, and not 10% would be able to tell
you who he is," Lukas said.</TE>
<TE>   If Lukas, who will try to stop War Emblem with Proud Citizen, a
colt who ate the winner's dust in the Derby and Preakness, is
exaggerating, he's still not far off.</TE>
<TE>   "The sporting public is very callous," he said. "The top events
have a way of coming and going in a hurry, because there's such a
glut of them. One result comes in, then everybody says, 'That was
fun,' but then in the next breath they're saying, 'What's for
tomorrow?' "</TE>
<TE>   Because of what happened 20 miles from Belmont Park last
September, there has been a surfeit of psychobabble about whether
racing needs a Triple Crown winner owned by a cocky, oil-rich Saudi
Arabian prince who seems to sneer back the answer whenever a tough
question is posed.</TE>
<TE>   "I just hope the horse wins because we need another Triple Crown
champion out there," said Karen Taylor, one of the owners of Seattle
Slew, the 1977 champion who died on May 7.</TE>
<TE>   This is the first time since Sir Barton scored the first Triple
Crown sweep in 1919 that none of the champions are alive.</TE>
<TE>   "We need another star," Taylor said, her eyes welling up once more
at the thought of losing Seattle Slew. "We need that big horse to put
back on a pedestal."</TE>
<TE>   Baffert makes regular attempts at depersonalizing the moment.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not about the owner, the trainer, or even the jockey," he
said. "It's about the horse."</TE>
<TE>   The raw numbers are not encouraging. According to the Jockey Club,
the racing handle of $14.55 billion last year was a record, but the
growth rate was only 1.6%, the smallest increase in eight years.
There were 60,738 races run, a drop of about 10,000 since 1994. Foal
crops have shrunk dramatically. The 2000 group had an estimated
36,700 registrations, down almost 8,000 from 10 years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   War Emblem is a bona fide needle-in-the-haystack story, a horse
who couldn't be sold as a yearling, a last-minute purchase by Prince
Ahmed bin Salman who mushroomed into a Triple Crown powerhouse. The
NBC telecasts of the Derby and Preakness, however, did not generate
exceptional ratings. War Emblem was an afterthought for many
observers at Churchill Downs, where the Derby ratings sank 12% from
the previous year. The Preakness ratings were 2% better than in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Barry Schwartz, chairman of the New York Racing Assn., which runs
Belmont Park, said War Emblem's marketing potential will hinge on how
much the horse runs after the Triple Crown.</TE>
<TE>   "If he comes back in races like the Travers [at the NYRA's
Saratoga in August], then the ball will keep rolling," Schwartz said.</TE>
<TE>   That possibility is remote. Last year, the prince and Baffert
campaigned Point Given, who danced some more dances after winning the
Preakness and Belmont. By August, Point Given was injured, his career
over. The same handlers of War Emblem are not likely to over-race
this lean colt with marginal legs.</TE>
<TE>   Horse owner Bob Lewis would prefer to see the industry's glass as
half full. On the Triple Crown sidelines this year, Lewis has
previously raced two Triple Crown wannabes--Silver Charm and
Charismatic, who were beaten in the Belmont in 1997 and 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have a [Triple Crown] winner alive," Lewis said during a
chat Friday morning at Lukas' barn. "It would be good if we could
pick up on that again. It would be a great stimulus and give the
sport some positive vibes. I think racing is getting stronger again.
Look at how many people Charismatic brought out [a Belmont record of
85,818] when he ran here. The [horse] sales to me seem to be on the
upswing. I think there's a broader segment of the population buying
horses these days. A lot of new blood is coming into the game."</TE>
<TE>   The book written by Laura Hillenbrand, "Seabiscuit: An American
Legend," has been a publishing phenomenon. More than 600,000 copies
have been sold and the story is being made into a major movie.
Several other racing books have followed. Baffert is poised while his
publisher, awaiting today's result, considers a revision of the
trainer's 1999 autobiography.</TE>
<TE>   Like the rest of racing, though, that might be a tough sell.</TE>
<TE>   "No question, the connections of War Emblem come with a stigma,"
Lukas said. "The guy who owns the horse is a deep-pocketed Saudi. And
every chance he gets, the guy who trains him is Barnum and Baileying
it all over the place."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   War Emblem had a scare during a morning gallop on a sloppy track
Friday. One of trainer Bill Mott's horses spooked and got in War
Emblem's way, but Mick Jenner, who was aboard the Derby-Preakness
winner, steered him to the outside and out of danger.</TE>
<TE>   "Mick's a seasoned gallop boy," Baffert said. "He saw it coming
and took the fast lane."</TE>
<TE>   Despite almost two inches of overnight rain Thursday and Friday,
Belmont officials are promising a fast track for today, when the
weather is supposed to be dry with temperatures in the low 70s....
The track was wet-fast Friday as You won the $250,000 Acorn for
3-year-old fillies by 7 1/4 lengths. Trainer Bobby Frankel's horse,
ridden by Jerry Bailey, finished the mile in 1:34 and paid $5. Willa
On The Move ran second, 4 3/4 lengths ahead of favored Bella
Bellucci. The field was cut to five with the scratch of Proper
Gamble.</TE>

<HD>He's Not Game for World Cup at Any Time</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>After giving the World Cup a look, Art Spander of the Oakland Tribune
says he remains unimpressed by the global pastime:</LD>
<LD>   "Guilty, your honor. I watched soccer at 2 o'clock. In the
morning. Revoke my U.S. citizenship. Make me eat steak-and-kidney pie
for a week.</LD>
<LD>   "[Soccer is] a sport in which everything takes place between 11:30
p.m. and 4 a.m. To borrow from Mr. Dickens, the worst of times.</LD>
<TE>   "Yawn. I'll never complain about a three-hour baseball game
again."</TE>
<TE>   More Spander: After the U.S. team's 3-2 upset of Portugal, "the
Portuguese prime minister urged the country not to lose faith in the
team. Of course it should. Losing to a group of kids from a nation
that doesn't know a corner kick from a corner grocery should be a
punishable offense."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who are the only two players to have hit home runs,
at the major league level, before turning 20 and after turning 40?</TE>
<TE>   Taking the green: Thieves dressed in Irish team uniforms made off
with the equivalent of $1,800 in cash from a pizza shop in Ibaraki,
Japan, before Wednesday's World Cup game between Ireland and Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Police said the men, who numbered about 20, "looked like
foreigners."</TE>
<TE>   Leprechauns, perhaps?</TE>
<TE>   Camera shy: Hundreds of soccer fans who took a day off to watch
the World Cup in a tent in Malta's capital of Valletta fled when a
cameraman showed up, fearing employers would spot them on TV.</TE>
<TE>   Scalpers' nightmare: Police officers who work outside Cleveland's
Jacobs Field owe the city council a debt of gratitude for scrapping a
law that once made it illegal to sell sports tickets for less than
face value, says Chris Tomasson of the Akron Beacon Journal: "Imagine
if the law were still on the books. 'Hey, buddy, we heard you just
sold all of Section 577 for 20 bucks. Hands behind your back.'</TE>
<TE>   "There would be huge traffic jams caused by all the police vans
needed to haul away the scalpers.... With the Indians having gone
south in the standings, the [scalpers], who used to make hundreds of
dollars a game, are making less than the nearby panhandlers."</TE>
<TE>   Flying hazard: Vijay Singh grew up next to a golf course in Fiji,
but getting there was an adventure.</TE>
<TE>   He could either take the long way, three miles around Nandi
Airport. Or he could figure out when the planes were arriving and
sprint across the runway between landings, clubs slung over his
shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   "Every hour there would be a flight or two, and you learned the
busy time," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Ty Cobb and Rusty Staub.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Bill Lyon of the Philadelphia Inquirer says boxing is
hitting below the belt with tonight's Lennox Lewis-Mike Tyson
heavyweight bout:</TE>
<TE>   "Fifty-four ninety-five. That's the current market for sleaze.</TE>
<TE>   "For $54.95, the eager entrepreneurs will feed into your TV set
the closest thing sports has these days to pornography. Mike Tyson.</TE>
<TE>   "Tyson is virtually certain to do something vile, vulgar or
cannibalistic, and the promoters know that for the perverted pleasure

<DL>PALO ALTO</DL>
<LD>Stanford pitcher Jeremy Guthrie figures to make a lot of money in the
coming weeks. He gave USC a million reasons why Friday night.</LD>
<LD>   Guthrie stopped a hot-hitting Trojan squad, giving up four hits
over eight innings in a 4-2 victory in the first game of the NCAA
best-of-three super regional before a sellout crowd of 4,092 at
Sunken Diamond.</LD>
<LD>   Selected in the first round of baseball's first-year player draft
Tuesday by the Cleveland Indians, Guthrie was making Indians' brass
smile, staying in command most of the game in improving to 12-1 this
season. Effectively mixing curveballs and sliders with a fastball in
the low 90s, he threw 114 pitches, 68 for strikes. He beat the
Trojans for the third time in five starts.</LD>
<TE>   "I think that Guthrie was certainly the difference," USC Coach
Mike Gillespie said. "He was exceptional, at least for seven innings.
He made what we believe to be a real good offensive club [look] not
very offensive, and that's a credit to him being real special tonight
as opposed to us being inept."</TE>
<TE>   Guthrie took a two-hit shutout with six strikeouts into the eighth
inning. Then the USC batters finally came to life.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Barre lined a single into center field. On the next pitch,
shortstop Michael Moon stunned the Cardinal with a fly ball that
cleared the right-field fence to cut a three-run lead to one. Alberto
Concepcion then hit the next pitch farther, only to watch Stanford
center fielder Sam Fuld catch the ball at the fence in straightaway
center field.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was going over the fence," Guthrie said. "I thought
I made a pretty good pitch."</TE>
<TE>   Guthrie recovered and got Bill Peavey on a groundout to end the
inning.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford (44-16) got a run in the bottom of the eighth, and Dan
Rich came on to get his fourth save and put the Cardinal within one
victory of reaching the College World Series for the fourth
consecutive year.</TE>
<TE>   USC pitcher Anthony Reyes almost matched Guthrie. He gave up four
runs on eight hits and walked one.</TE>
<TE>   There were two mistakes--a two-run homer by Carlos Quentin and a
solo blast by Chris Carter.</TE>
<TE>   USC (37-23) wasn't in awe of Guthrie, at least before the game.
This season, the Trojans had some success against him, scoring 10
runs in 15 innings over two previous games. But they hadn't faced him
in the postseason, when he is often at his best. He is 5-0 with a
2.40 earned-run average over the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   "You could tell tonight on the mound that he had complete
confidence in anything he threw," Moon said. "He showed why he's a
first-round pick."</TE>
<TE>   Stanford provided him with a cushion when Quentin hit a 2-2
fastball just over the fence in left-center field.</TE>

<HD>One Thing Consistent: Defense Isn't Resting</HD>
<DH>Lakers: Players say there's a reason for the Nets' 34.9%
shooting, and it isn't simply an off night.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's not glamorous, it's not pretty and it's often overlooked.</LD>
<LD>   But as the Lakers showed again Friday night in a 106-83
dismantling of the New Jersey Nets in Game 2 of the NBA Finals, their
defense is second to none, especially with an NBA championship on the
line.</LD>
<LD>   While the Nets obviously have their hands full trying to get a
handle on Shaquille O'Neal, their problems aren't limited to defense.
They're not going to win if they make only 34.9% of their shots, as
they did in a wire-to-wire Laker romp.</LD>
<TE>   "That's what we've done for a long time," forward Rick Fox said of
the Laker defense. "That's how we've won championships. We have a
great offensive system, but in that system we're allowed to have
great defensive balance. We can get back, we can close lanes down, we
can control the tempo.</TE>
<TE>   "We have some great individual defensive players on this team. It
all starts with Shaq and Kobe [Bryant], who are willing to play
defense, which makes it easier for Robert [Horry], myself and Derek
[Fisher] to be aggressive. There's a lot of talk about our offense,
but our defense is what wins us championships."</TE>
<TE>   The Nets don't need reminding.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Kidd, whose brilliant play carried the surprising Nets to
the Eastern Conference championship, made only six of 17 shots in
Game 2 after making 11 of 26 in Wednesday night's 99-94 Laker victory
in Game 1.</TE>
<TE>   Keith Van Horn, five for 14 in Game 1, went three for nine.</TE>
<TE>   Kenyon Martin, seven for 22 in Game 1, went two for eight.</TE>
<TE>   That wasn't even the worst of it. Reserve guard Lucious Harris,
who played at Long Beach State, marked his homecoming by making one
of 14 shots in the two games. In Game 2, he missed all nine.</TE>
<TE>   "This team, because we score and we have two dominant players, our
defense is going to get overlooked," Laker forward Samaki Walker
said. "But in the fourth quarter, we're a better team than most
because we play defense.</TE>
<TE>   "We stop teams and we make the plays down the stretch."</TE>
<TE>   Such as they did Friday night, outscoring the Nets, 25-8, in the
last eight minutes after the visitors had closed to within 81-75 with
a 14-2 run that included four three-point baskets, two each by Kidd
and Kerry Kittles.</TE>
<TE>   Kidd didn't make another shot and Kittles made only one.</TE>
<TE>   As long as the Nets were willing to fire up three-point
shots--they made six of 22, after making five of 16 in Game 1--the
Lakers were willing to let them.</TE>
<TE>   "Most definitely," Walker said. "They're a team that likes to go
backdoor a lot. They're energy players--they get a lot of points in
transition--so as long as they're taking contested shots, we feel
comfortable."</TE>
<TE>   Fox expects the Nets to shoot better when the series shifts to
East Rutherford, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll have an energy that's different, they'll have their
fans," he said. "They'll have the support of their rims and their
baskets, a more comfortable environment, which I'm sure we'll get
them off to a better start."</TE>
<TE>   But the Lakers, a third consecutive title in sight, will have
their stoppers.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a very good defensive team," Fox said. "It's not a fluke.
It's not something we do once in a while. We do it consistently,
especially at this time of the year. Individually, we make the
commitment and collectively we support each other.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people talk about, 'Well, teams just shoot poorly.'
Well, there's a reason for that. Eventually, hopefully, after we win
another championship, and another one and another one, people will
look back and say, 'Wow, those were some pretty good defensive
teams.' "</TE>

<HD>36 Years, Same Old Dodgers</HD>
<DH>Baseball: They lose, 4-2, in first game against Orioles
since being swept by Baltimore in 1966 World Series.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>To set the mood for their first regular-season series against the
Dodgers, the Baltimore Orioles played a lengthy retrospective film of
their 1966 World Series victory over Los Angeles on the Camden Yards
video board about an hour before the teams met in an interleague game
Friday night.</LD>
<LD>   Then life imitated art, with a rookie right-hander from Mexico
named Rodrigo Lopez playing the part of Jim Palmer, the Dodger
offense playing the part of, well, the 1966 Dodgers for most of the
evening, and a crowd of 33,624 getting transported 36 years back in
time.</LD>
<LD>   Lopez, who just a few months ago was pitching for the Culiacan
Tomato Growers of the Mexican Winter League, gave up two runs and six
hits in 8 2/3 innings and retired 12 straight batters from the third
to seventh innings to lead the Orioles to a 4-2 victory over the
Dodgers.</LD>
<TE>   Baltimore left fielder Melvin Mora hit two solo home runs off
starter Andy Ashby, in the third and sixth innings, and Brian Roberts
homered in the eighth to pace an Oriole offense that featured eight
hits--seven for extra bases.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers avoided a shutout when Paul Lo Duca, Shawn Green and
Eric Karros singled off Lopez in the ninth, Lo Duca scoring with two
out when center fielder Chris Singleton bobbled Karros' hit.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore Manager Mike Hargrove pulled Lopez for closer Jorge
Julio, a decision that was met with derision from the home crowd.
Julio gave up an RBI single to Dave Hansen to make it 4-2, and the
runners advanced to second and third on Geronimo Gil's passed ball.
But Julio struck out Adrian Beltre to end the game for his 11th save,
enabling Lopez to improve to 6-1.</TE>
<TE>   "I know it wasn't a popular decision when I went out there--I
probably would have been run out of town on a rail if it didn't
work--but it was the right thing to do," Hargrove said.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't going to let him face the tying or the winning run. My
heart was telling me to let him finish the game, but my head was
telling me the smart thing to do was to win the game and let Julio
come in to face Hansen."</TE>
<TE>   The ninth-inning runs ended the Dodgers' string of consecutive
innings without a run against the Orioles at 41, a streak that dated
to Game 1 of the 1966 World Series, when the Dodgers scored single
runs in the second and third innings--their only runs of the
series--in a 5-2 loss.</TE>
<TE>   The Orioles went on to sweep the series with Palmer blanking Sandy
Koufax and the Dodgers, 6-0, in Game 2; Wally Bunker blanking Claude
Osteen, 1-0, in Game 3, and Dave McNally blanking Don Drysdale, 1-0,
in Game 4. That '66 Dodger team won the National League pennant with
a 95-67 record despite being shut out 17 times.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers and Orioles met for the first time since that series
Friday night, and for most of the night, it seemed, not much had
changed. Lopez, a 26-year-old who appeared in only six major league
games before this season, blanked the Dodgers on three hits through
eight innings before tiring in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez mixed his well-placed fastballs with a solid slider and
changeup, and his control was superb--of his 107 pitches, 73 were
strikes.</TE>
<TE>   With the Dodgers swinging at so many first pitches or early in the
count, the game lasted only 2 hours 18 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "He came out throwing strikes, and before you know it, we're in
the sixth inning and we have only two hits," Dodger leadoff batter
Dave Roberts said. "He got into a rhythm, and we didn't do anything
to get him out of it.</TE>
<TE>   "He threw a lot of first-pitch strikes and got into a comfort
zone, so we should have gotten him into some deeper counts."</TE>
<TE>   Through seven innings, Lopez faced only 23 batters, two over the
minimum, and the two hits he allowed were a bloop single to Karros in
the second and an infield single to Roberts in the third.</TE>
<TE>   A double play finished the Dodger second, and Roberts was picked
off first to end the third.</TE>
<TE>   "He mixed his pitches well and had just enough of a changeup to
keep us off balance," Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said. "He used his
fastball on both sides of the plate, threw a lot of strikes and kept
the ball out of the middle.... I can understand our guys wanting to
be aggressive early in the count, because even when he missed, he was
around the plate."</TE>

<HD>Brown Being Evaluated After Hospital Release</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>Dodger pitcher Kevin Brown was released from Centinela Hospital
Medical Center in Inglewood on Friday, but doctors have not decided
whether he will need surgery to repair a herniated disk in his lower
back.</LD>
<LD>   General Manager Dan Evans spoke with Brown on Friday night and
said the pitcher is feeling better, but he's not pain free. If Brown,
on the disabled list because of inflammation in his surgically
repaired right elbow, makes progress in the next few days, he will
likely begin physical therapy at Dodger Stadium next week.</LD>
<LD>   "Is it therapy? Is it surgery? We're not going to jump to any
conclusions," Evans said. "They're going to be real methodical in
trying to determine where he is."</LD>
<TE>   Brown, who is under the care of Dr. Frank Jobe, Dodger team
physician, and Dr. William Dillin, a spinal specialist, underwent
extensive tests Thursday night and Friday morning to determine a
course of treatment.</TE>
<TE>   It appears the Dodgers will opt for a rehabilitation program
designed to strengthen the lower back and reduce or shrink the
bulging disk with medication before considering surgery, which could
sideline Brown for the rest of the season.</TE>
<TE>   There was some good news on the Brown injury front Friday: The
fluid in the back of his elbow is gone.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dominican pitcher Jonathan Corporan's second application for a
visa in order to enter the U.S. and begin his minor league career
with the Dodgers was denied by the U.S. Embassy in Santo Domingo on
Friday because of insufficient paperwork.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers signed Corporan, a 6-foot-2 right-hander with a 93-mph
fastball, to a $930,000 bonus in early April, but the deal has been
put on hold--and could be voided--because of questions surrounding
Corporan's age.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Schugel, the Dodgers' director of international scouting,
will travel to the Dominican Republic on Sunday in an effort to clear
up the matter.</TE>

<HD>England Spices Up a Victory</HD>
<DH>World Cup: Beckham redeems himself for '98 red card with
penalty kick for only goal in 1-0 victory over Argentina.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAPPORO, Japan</DL>
<LD>This time, only the jersey was red.</LD>
<LD>   This time, David Beckham played a full 90 minutes, and when he and
Argentina's Diego Simeone converged at midfield, it was merely to
shake hands.</LD>
<LD>   This time, it was England over Argentina in the World Cup ... on a
penalty kick, of all things ... by Beckham, of all people ...
certifying that the only thing getting sent off Friday at the Sapporo
Dome was Argentina's sense of invincibility every time it steps onto
a soccer field against England.</LD>
<TE>   So much about England's 1-0 victory over its longtime nemesis
dabbled in the surreal.</TE>
<TE>   The match was played on a natural grass field inside a
climate-controlled dome, its air conditioning enhanced by the
bellowing lungs of an England booster section the size of a small
town.</TE>
<TE>   The match was held in Japan, yet there was so much red and white
strewn throughout the stands, it looked, felt, and most certainly
sounded like an England home game.</TE>
<TE>   The match was won by Beckham, who was infamously red-carded the
last time England played Argentina in a World Cup, in 1998, removed
in the 47th minute of a 2-2 thriller that eventually saw his
teammates play short-handed for 73 minutes before being eliminated on
penalty kicks.</TE>
<TE>   Beckham returned from France four years ago a national villain,
hung in effigy in London and heckled mercilessly at stadiums
throughout the land. Beckham knows that the sins of St. Etienne will
never be forgotten, but his 44th-minute penalty kick in Sapporo
figures to go a very long way toward forgiveness.</TE>
<TE>   Contrast the angry mob scenes and the bitter headlines of '98 with
Friday's image of Beckham racing to the corner flag after converting
his kick, grabbing his red shirt with both hands, kissing the England
emblem and then deliriously tugging on the shirt some more--making
sure that all 35,927 in the building, as well as the millions
watching at home, knew precisely what this moment was all about.</TE>
<TE>   That kick, Beckham said, finally "puts the ghosts of France '98 to
rest once and for all."</TE>
<TE>   Almost as significant, it puts England in an unexpected share of
first place in Group F with Sweden, a 2-1 winner over Nigeria, and
drops Argentina, one of the pre-tournament favorites, into third
place--in danger of failing to qualify for the second round.</TE>
<TE>   England and Sweden have four points each at 1-0-1, Argentina has
three at 1-1-0. If England ties or wins its final group game against
Nigeria, it will advance to the next round. If Sweden ties or beats
Argentina, it will do the same.</TE>
<TE>   Several of the main characters from the original French drama
figured prominently again.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Owen, who scored a classic goal in St. Etienne, hit the
post in this one and ran Argentine defenders ragged again before
Mauricio Pochettino took him down in the box for the game-deciding
penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Simeone, whose constant harassing and hard foul on Beckham four
years ago prompted the fit that led to Beckham's ejection, tried
messing with the English midfielder's mind again--offering a friendly
handshake moments before Beckham stepped to the penalty spot.</TE>
<TE>   This time, Beckham didn't bite. "Antics," Beckham said, taking the
gesture for what it was--an attempt to rattle his concentration.</TE>
<TE>   David Seaman, the losing goalkeeper in the '98 shootout, made two
crucial second-half saves, stopping Javier Zanetti's close-range
effort in the 70th minute and blocking Pochettino's point-blank blast
eight minutes later.</TE>
<TE>   Seaman had to do a lot of late scrambling because England, for the
second time in as many games, hit the wall in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a very hard last 15 minutes," England Coach Sven Goran
Eriksson said. "We were tired, but we took our chances.... We played
with a big, big heart."</TE>
<TE>   Argentina Coach Marcelo Bielsa, visibly frustrated on the
sideline, used all three of his substitutions by the 64th
minute--including forward Pablo Aimar for Juan Veron, Argentina's
captain, at halftime.</TE>
<TE>   The move had nothing "to do with an injury," Bielsa said. "The
inclusion of Aimar was due to footballing demands."</TE>
<TE>   Bielsa and Argentina found themselves in an unfamiliar state:
trailing England in a World Cup match and having to resort to pushing
panic buttons.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't get any sweeter than that," Beckham said. "As a
footballing nation, we have waited a long time for this."</TE>
<TE>   Going back to 1986 and Diego Maradona's infamous "Hand of God"
goal for Argentina, the wait had reached 16 years, to be exact.</TE>
<TE>   When asked how it felt to finally be done with it, Beckham's reply
was entirely reasonable, all things considered.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels better," he said, "than four years ago."</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>It was billed as "London's longest lunch hour," and dessert Friday
was sweet indeed--a 1-0 victory over Argentina, England's old
nemesis, in the World Cup.</LD>
<LD>   The country's work force had put down its tools to watch the game
in Sapporo, Japan, at 12:30 p.m. local time.</LD>
<LD>   Many companies, knowing that their staffs would be largely
unproductive anyway, set up televisions or reserved rooms in pubs and
restaurants. Executives mixed with office workers to watch the game
and carry on with post-victory celebrations--expected to last most of
the weekend.</LD>
<TE>   England's last World Cup encounter with Argentina, in 1998, ended
in defeat--after David Beckham, this year's captain, had been sent
off for a foul. The long-standing rivalry between the countries and
Argentina's being favored in some quarters to win the tournament this
year meant Friday's game was a nail-biting experience for England's
fans.</TE>
<TE>   City centers such as Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool and Newcastle
came to a halt. Shopping malls, supermarkets and city councils put up
huge screens in stores, central squares and streets, where people
gathered to watch and cheer as Beckham scored the avenging, winning
goal on a penalty kick at the 44th minute.</TE>
<TE>   During the game, the roads of central London--normally jammed on
Friday afternoon--were "ridiculously quiet," according to the
Automobile Assn.'s "Roadwatch" radio broadcasts.</TE>
<TE>   Train services were heavily reduced, with notices blaming "driver
shortages" and "disruption due to short-term sickness" fooling
nobody.</TE>
<TE>   Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt had advised firms to
give employees the day off.</TE>
<TE>   "I am glad that so many firms have taken a sensible view," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Prime Minister Tony Blair reportedly had cleared his calendar to
watch the game, and younger members of the royal family were said to
be glued to the TV.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts estimated that about a quarter of the country's work
force took the day off, and one economic research group forecast a
shortfall in productivity of about 750 million pounds, more than $1
billion.</TE>
<TE>   There were other winners and losers. Bookmakers, for instance, had
to pay bettors who'd backed England, but they were philosophical
about it.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm happy to say it was a bad day for the bookies," Graham
Sharpe, a spokesman for the William Hill bookmakers, said on Sky TV.
"Our offices came to a halt during the game, and there were big
cheers--even though you might have thought we were shooting ourselves
in the wallet."</TE>
<TE>   After the game, those who weren't already inside a pub or
restaurant joined those who were shouting, "England! England!
England!" and, "Football's coming home!"</TE>

<HD>GAME 2 REPORT</HD>
<DH>Charting The Lead: A look at the Lakers' lead or deficit by
the minute</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>FIRST QUARTER</LD>
<LD>   Highlight reel: Well, so much for the Nets getting off to a fast
start. They were even more sluggish than in the first quarter of Game
1, struggling to get into a rhythm on offense and botching defensive
assignments. Everything was difficult for them and easy for the
Lakers, following a familiar early pattern, and Kerry Kittles seemed
to be the only Net awake at game time. He scored his team's first
seven points, prompting the Lakers to focus on someone.</LD>
<LD>   Not in the box score: The bounce in Shaquille O'Neal's step. With
the finish line in sight, O'Neal appears to be re-energized and eager
to begin his off-season vacation as soon as possible. He moved--and
moved Net defenders--as if his plans don't call for a long series.</LD>
<TE>   Winning numbers: O'Neal's five-for-seven shooting; Lakers'
11-for-19 shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong numbers: Kenyon Martin's one-for-four shooting; Nets'
six-for-25 shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--O'Neal 12, Kobe Bryant 8, Rick Fox 7;
Nets--Kittles 7, Richard Jefferson 6.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--Fox 3, Bryant 3; Nets--Martin 3, Todd
MacCulloch 3.</TE>
<TE>   SECOND QUARTER</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel: Again, it was all about O'Neal. Whether dunking on
lob passes, beating New Jersey defenders on fastbreaks or making
nifty, no-look passes to teammates, O'Neal was at the center of
action and the Nets' frustration. Their blank stares and shoulder
shrugs told the story--and that was from the Nets' bench. Powerless
to stop O'Neal, the Nets nonetheless continued to try. Unfortunately
for them, there are no awards for effort against O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: The contribution of Devean George, whose
playoff disappearance has affected the Lakers' bench production.
George scored only four points, but he was active on defense and did
enough on offense to indicate he might yet become a factor in this
series. The Lakers are keeping their fingers crossed.</TE>
<TE>   Winning number: O'Neal's five-for-six shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong numbers: Jason Kidd's zero points and Lucious Harris'
0-for-3 shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--O'Neal 11; Nets--Keith Van Horn 9.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--O'Neal 5; Nets--Van Horn 4.</TE>
<TE>   THIRD QUARTER</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel: The pace quickened, and that turned out to be bad
news for the Nets. With O'Neal scoring or assisting on 21 of 23
points during one stretch, the Lakers took a 77-57 lead with 1:52 to
play on Brian Shaw's three-pointer at the top of the circle off a
pass from you know who. The Lakers had no problems getting the ball
to O'Neal under the basket, throwing half-court entry passes to him.
The Nets lacked defensive intensity and the Lakers took advantage,
forcing the action around O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: The atmosphere at Staples Center. The crowd
was pretty subdued through the first two quarters, but even this
savvy, showbiz crowd got into the groove while the Lakers were
running and rolling.</TE>
<TE>   Winning numbers: O'Neal's 13 points and seven-for-nine free-throw
shooting; Kidd's 11 points and four-for-five shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong numbers: Harris' 0-for-4 shooting; Aaron Williams'
one-for-four shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--O'Neal 13; Nets--Kidd 11.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--Fox 3, Horry 3; Nets--Kidd 3, Van Horn
2, MacCulloch 2, Williams 2.</TE>
<TE>   FOURTH QUARTER</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel: What's that they say about the Lakers losing
focus? The defending champions appeared headed down that road again,
what with the Nets making three consecutive three-pointers, including
two by Kidd, to pull within 79-72 with 9:52 to play. But the Nets hit
another wall as the Lakers continued to turn to their man in the
middle. With the ball going to O'Neal on every possession down the
stretch, the Lakers had no cause for alarm.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: The body language of the Nets. They looked
mentally and physically drained after being pummeled by O'Neal for 40
points, 12 rebounds and eight assists, watching helplessly as he
dominated in the post. The Nets can't get back to New Jersey fast
enough.</TE>
<TE>   Winning numbers: Ten points for Derek Fisher, always a good sign.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong numbers: Kidd's two-for-seven shooting and the Nets getting
outrebounded, 15-6.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--Fisher 10, Bryant 8; Nets--Kittles 8,
Kidd 6.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: O'Neal 4, Horry 4; Nets--Martin 2, Jefferson
2.</TE>

<HD>With Tyson Involved, Focus Rarely on Fight</HD>
<DH>Analysis: Championship bout against Lewis draws heavy
interest for all the wrong reasons.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEMPHIS, Tenn.</DL>
<LD>In any fight, a victory by the underdog is called an upset.</LD>
<LD>   When Lennox Lewis and Mike Tyson meet tonight for the heavyweight
title here at the Pyramid, it will be an upset if it turns out to be
a fight, not a farce.</LD>
<LD>   The buzz in this town is deafening. Beale Street looks like New
Orleans' French Quarter during Mardi Gras. The parties, events and
celebrity sightings around town are of Super Bowl proportions.</LD>
<TE>   There are media people here from all over the world. Several
British writers, in South Korea covering soccer's World Cup, are
flying here for 12 hours to cover the fight, then will be hopping
back on a plane to return to Asia.</TE>
<TE>   Memphis-Shelby County Airport is expecting up to triple its normal
amount of air traffic. The pay-per-view buys have exceeded half a
million, with the biggest selling period still ahead.</TE>
<TE>   But many of these people are not lured by the prospect of a
sporting event. They are tuning in or showing up to see a freak show.</TE>
<TE>   They want to see the crash, not the auto race. They will watch for
the same reason people watch Jerry Springer, to be eyewitnesses to
the outrageous.</TE>
<TE>   Will Tyson bite Lewis on the ear, as he bit Evander Holyfield's in
their 1997 title match? Will Tyson try to break Lewis' arm, as he did
with Francois Botha in a 1999 fight? Will Tyson bite Lewis on the
thigh, as he did in a brawl at a New York news conference in January?
Or will Tyson come up with some new illegal tactic, something out of
ultimate fighting, something out of the World Wrestling Federation,
something out of a street fight?</TE>
<TE>   Many in America, and the rest of the world, are willing to pay to
find out. Which says as much about the viewing audience as about
Tyson.</TE>
<TE>   Logically, World Boxing Council-International Boxing Federation
heavyweight champion Lewis (39-2-1, 30 knockouts) figures to win. In
the years when most fighters' skills begin to decline, Lewis, 36, has
improved dramatically. In the last three years, he has refined his
jab, increased his variety of effective punches and his mobility, and
improved his ring mastery. Most important, his confidence has grown
considerably.</TE>
<TE>   The confidence change began, in fact, in a fight that ended in a
draw. Most ringside observers, with the exception of two out-of-touch
judges, believed Lewis had beaten Holyfield in their first fight in
March of 1999.</TE>
<TE>   So even though Lewis didn't get the decision, he did get the
confidence that he could beat one of the top heavyweights of his era.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis showed that confidence in the rematch, beating Holyfield,
and he has shown it ever since, with the exception of his first fight
against Hasim Rahman in April 2001. Lewis was overconfident, didn't
train and wound up on his back, a loser.</TE>
<TE>   He showed it was a fluke, however, when he got in shape for the
rematch and knocked out Rahman in the fourth round in November.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis' other loss was the result of one devastating punch thrown
by Oliver McCall in 1994, but Lewis also avenged that defeat by
winning the rematch.</TE>
<TE>   Although it appears Lewis is not far removed from his prime, the
35-year-old Tyson (49-3, two no-contests, 43 knockouts) is 13 years
past his peak.</TE>
<TE>   Those who have reduced the odds to less than 2-1 in favor of Lewis
are thinking of the young Tyson, the Tyson who arrived in the ring in
no-nonsense fashion with nothing more than black trunks, black shoes
and a white towel slung over his shoulder before dispensing with
opponents in a no-nonsense manner. Only four of his first 16
opponents lasted beyond the first round. At 20, he was the youngest
heavyweight champion.</TE>
<TE>   But that was a long time ago. Tyson's last impressive performance
against an impressive opponent was a 90-second knockout of Michael
Spinks. That was in 1988. And some would argue Spinks was nothing
more than a blown-up cruiserweight.</TE>
<TE>   Tyson beat Razor Ruddock, a decent heavyweight, twice in 1991. But
since then, the biggest name Tyson has fought is Holyfield, who beat
him twice.</TE>
<TE>   Tyson has been through imprisonment, three years for rape, three
months for road rage.</TE>
<TE>   He has been through promoters, been through trainers, made and
lost enough money to last several lifetimes.</TE>
<TE>   But, as far as boxing is concerned, he has fought only 22 rounds
in the last six years.</TE>
<TE>   Gone is the confidence that enabled Tyson to bully his way through
so many opponents. Gone are the head movement and mobility that
allowed him to move inside and demolish fighters.</TE>
<TE>   At 6-feet-5, Lewis has 5 1/2 inches on Tyson. At 249 1/4 pounds,
Lewis outweighs Tyson by 15 pounds. With an 84-inch reach, Lewis has
a six-inch advantage.</TE>
<TE>   If Lewis has his jab working, he should be able to hold Tyson at
bay, use his reach advantage to expose himself to minimum damage and
can perhaps win by knockout when a desperate Tyson lets down his
guard. Lewis becomes conservative in big fights and figures to be
that way tonight.</TE>
<TE>   Tyson has a puncher's chance. It worked for McCall. It worked for
Rahman. Lewis has shown a vulnerable chin and Tyson, whatever the
years and undisciplined lifestyle have drained from him, still has a
powerful punch.</TE>
<TE>   If he is to win, Tyson must do so early, while he still has the
stamina.</TE>
<TE>   But the more likely outcome is that Lewis will wear down Tyson,
frustrate him, let him know that he won't be getting through to test
that chin.</TE>
<TE>   Then, around the fifth round, will come the pivotal moment.</TE>
<TE>   Will Tyson dig down deep, show the kind of courage he has never
previously demonstrated, grit his teeth and try to win this fight
fairly?</TE>
<TE>   Or will he throw in the towel mentally, spit out his mouthpiece,
sharpen those teeth and resort to the disgusting tactics that have
brought a curious world to his door tonight?</TE>
<TE>   Boxing purists are less concerned with who wins than how he wins.
With such focus on this fight, their fondest hope is that this is a
shining moment for the sport.</TE>
<TE>   Don't bet on it.</TE>
<TE>   Look for Lewis to win. By disqualification after Tyson resorts to
mayhem in the fifth round.</TE>

<HD>Spanish Accent for Men's Final</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Ferrero defeats listless Safin, and fellow Spaniard
Costa beats Corretja in semifinals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>For those who seemed incredulous that Marat Safin could play so
poorly and indifferently, trying drop shots at the most inopportune
moments, his display a few months ago in Melbourne evidently didn't
have a lasting impact.</LD>
<LD>   These mental shortcomings are becoming the norm, not the
exception, for the Russian. It happened against Thomas Johansson in
the Australian Open final, and reappeared Friday against Juan Carlos
Ferrero of Spain in the semifinals of the French Open.</LD>
<LD>   Though Safin has played in two Grand Slam finals (winning the U.S.
Open in 2000), and Ferrero in none, experience didn't seem to matter
much on the slow red clay of Roland Garros. The 11th-seeded Ferrero
defeated second-seeded Safin, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4, in 2 hours 8 minutes,
following the semifinal between close friends, Spaniards Albert Costa
and Alex Corretja, which was won by Costa, 6-3, 6-4, 3-6, 6-3, in 3
hours 10 minutes.</LD>
<TE>   Corretja had started to make something of a comeback when he went
for a volley in the second game of the fourth set and hurt his right
hand after tumbling to the ground. After an injury timeout, he
returned and lost the next two points and Costa had the key break of
serve.</TE>
<TE>   Costa and Ferrero will play Sunday, the first Grand Slam final for
either Spanish player. It is the first Slam final between Spaniards
since Carlos Moya defeated Corretja in 1998 here.</TE>
<TE>   Ferrero, 22, is one month younger than Safin. He jokingly rejected
the notion that Safin's lack of mental focus was the major factor.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to think this, you know," Ferrero said. "I want to
think I played so great and I won this match for this, not that he
lost his mind."</TE>
<TE>   Said Safin: "I wasn't good enough today. That's it. It's another
day. You have to accept these things. You cannot play all the time
your best tennis. Sometimes, you're playing great, you try, but you
cannot find it."</TE>
<TE>   Effort was not the problem in the first semifinal as the Spaniards
parked themselves well behind the baseline and settled in for a
lengthy battle. Costa and Corretja are close friends--so tight, in
fact, that Corretja will be the best man in Costa's wedding in six
days.</TE>
<TE>   Costa had twin daughters a little more than a year ago, and he has
been more relaxed on the court since then. He also has been working
with a sports psychologist who is the wife of his coach. Still, it
didn't stop him from tightening up; he squandered two match points in
the eighth game of the third set.</TE>
<TE>   He broke through in the next game, advancing when Corretja hit a
backhand wide. Costa still made it interesting, tripping and tumbling
on the clay as the final backhand drifted out.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, I feel a little bit stupid," Costa said. "But I was
completely happy. These things happened. I don't know what I did with
my foot and I fell on the court. But I'm unbelievably happy."</TE>

<HD>Williams Sisters Have a Chance to Do Some Good</HD>
<DH>Tennis: They have never played well against each other, but
will try again in French Open final.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>Their entourage has been remarkably light, almost star-free. No pop
star Brandy in the players' lounge to giggle with Serena Williams or
rapper Jay-Z to reduce Serena to silence, at least temporarily.</LD>
<LD>   The New York hype that was synonymous with the U.S. Open when the
Williams sisters, Venus and Serena, met in the final in September has
been muted in Paris at the French Open. First, there are no daily
tabloids in Paris, and the leading sports newspaper, L'Equipe, has
been preoccupied with the deepening malaise of the French World Cup
team.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe French minimalism will pave the way for another historic
step: A decent match between Venus and Serena, who will play in
today's final at Roland Garros.</LD>
<TE>   That hasn't happened. Certainly not on grass, not on a hard court,
not on clay or in a Grand Slam event. Maybe there were some great
practice sessions in Florida in front of dad and the dogs.</TE>
<TE>   "They haven't really performed up to their potential," said their
mother and coach, Oracene. "Hey, they just haven't got there yet. I
don't know why. Maybe there may always be a little barrier. They're
sisters and you can't neglect that fact."</TE>
<TE>   The prospect of a Williams-Williams final did not have European
television commentators thrilled, in part because of the one-sided,
often flat nature of their previous matches. Venus leads, 5-2, and is
3-0 against Serena at Grand Slams, including a 6-2, 6-4 victory in
the U.S. Open final. Their only meeting on clay came more than four
years ago, in the quarterfinals of the Italian Open, and Venus won,
6-4, 6-2.</TE>
<TE>   But 1998 might as well be another lifetime. Four years ago, the
household was without a Grand Slam title. Serena broke through first,
unexpectedly, and won the 1999 U.S. Open. Venus, who will turn 22 on
June 17, responded quickly to move past her sister, and the others,
winning both Wimbledon and the U.S. Open in each of the last two
years and reaching No. 1 in February.</TE>
<TE>   Many observers believe Serena has emerged as her own person.
Included in that group is Oracene, as well as NBC television
commentator Chris Evert, who noted Venus is untested at Roland Garros
this year. Evert picked Serena to win, and John McEnroe went with
Venus.</TE>
<TE>   Serena, 20, has matured since she lost to Venus in a Wimbledon
semifinal nearly two years ago, double-faulting on match point.</TE>
<TE>   "I've realized tennis isn't the end of everything," Serena said.
"At the time, I used to believe that if I didn't win, the whole world
would go down. That normally doesn't happen, so I think by taking it
lighter, it's kind of enabled me to do a bit better."</TE>
<TE>   Serena won the most recent meeting against Venus, 6-2, 6-2, in a
semifinal at Key Biscayne, Fla., in March, and split two clay-court
finals against Justine Henin in May. On clay, Venus beat Henin in the
Amelia Island final and lost to Kim Clijsters in the Hamburg final in
three sets.</TE>
<TE>   In Paris, Serena has dropped two sets, one to 17-year-old Russian
qualifier Vera Zvonareva in the fourth round and another to defending
champion Jennifer Capriati in the semifinals, an often riveting and
hard-hitting contest. Previously, the sisters had not gone past the
quarterfinals here.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm definitely feeling a bit older, wiser, a bit more
experienced," Serena said. "I've always felt very comfortable on the
clay. Now I feel like a clay-courter."</TE>
<TE>   Said Venus, who has not lost more than four games in a set: "I
wanted to do better here because I was starting to think that maybe I
had a jinx at this tournament. There's always some tournament on the
tour where you always lose.... I didn't want this to become one of
those."</TE>
<TE>   Even if Williams vs. Williams doesn't meet the hype and turns out
to be a one-sided affair, history already has been made. When the WTA
rankings are released Monday, Venus will be No. 1, Serena No. 2 and
Capriati No. 3.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the sisters were smiling, looking relaxed as they
headed into the players' lounge in the early afternoon. That's
nothing new. They are almost always together. And their routine
wasn't about to change, not even on the eve of this Grand Slam final.</TE>
<TE>   "I think you guys take it more seriously than we do," Serena said.
"I mean, we got out there, it's just another match for us. Just
obviously a tougher opponent. But that's about it."</TE>

<HD>Slumping Galaxy to Give Hartman a Shot</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mired in a three-game losing streak for the first time in his
professional coaching career, Sigi Schmid is shuffling his lineup for
today's game against the Chicago Fire in hopes of lighting a fire
under the Galaxy.</LD>
<LD>   Kevin Hartman will replace Matt Reis and start in goal, not only
for today's game, but also for the foreseeable future.</LD>
<LD>   "I think it's a situation where the competition between Kevin and
Matt is very close," Schmid said. "And you have a situation now where
Matt has given up eight goals in the past three games, not that the
eight goals are his fault because it's a combined effort ... but the
competition's so close that you've got to give Kevin an opportunity
to play. He's a quality goalkeeper.</LD>
<TE>   "If the difference between our goalkeepers were like [Chicago
goalkeepers] Zack Thornton and Henry Ring, well then you just keep
going with the guy you've been going with. But with us it's a
different situation."</TE>
<TE>   Hartman, 28, started the season as Major League Soccer's all-time
goalkeeping leader with a 1.12 goals-against-average, and was second
all-time with 32 shutouts. But off-season surgery in November to
repair a broken right wrist slowed him during training camp and Reis
won the starting job.</TE>
<TE>   Reis, 27, was making a name for himself early on as his 0.79 GAA
was third among MLS goalkeepers and, with a record of 4-0-2, he was
the lone keeper to have played at least 150 minutes and not lost.
Then came the Galaxy's three-game free-fall to close out its
franchise-record five-game trip.</TE>
<TE>   Hartman has started one MLS game for the Galaxy this season, a 1-0
overtime loss to Colorado on April 27, and was in the net for the
Galaxy's two international exhibition victories over CSD Municipal of
Guatemala, 2-1, and Aguila of El Salvador, 3-0.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting on the sidelines most of the time, though, has been trying
for Hartman, the 1999 MLS goalkeeper of the year.</TE>
<TE>   "I try to be as unemotional about it as I can," he said. "I want
to be playing the best soccer that I can."</TE>

<HD>Bonds Sees Sights Before 2-1 Loss</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Slugger plays at Yankee Stadium for the first
time, but Giants can do little against Mussina.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Playing for the first time in the House that Ruth Built, Barry Bonds
walked through the fence rather than clearing it.</LD>
<LD>   Mike Mussina kept Bonds and San Francisco at bay, pitching the New
York Yankees past the Giants, 2-1, Friday night in the renewal of one
of baseball's most storied rivalries.</LD>
<LD>   "He gave me his best. He threw almost everything at me," Bonds
said. "It's tough when you don't face someone through the course of a
season."</LD>
<TE>   Said Yankee Manager Joe Torre: "You can tell what kind of player
he is when I sit here as the opposing manager saying that we did well
against him, and he went two for three."</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees began interleague play by ending the Giants' four-game
winning streak. The teams last played meaningful games against each
other in the 1962 World Series.</TE>
<TE>   The matchup drew a crowd of 55,053 that included War Emblem
trainer Bob Baffert--and even drew a few fans who watched from a
building rooftop across the street from Yankee Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds, who began his major league career in 1986, arrived in a
white stretch limousine for his first visit to America's most famous
ballpark. Before the game, as the Giants took batting practice, he
strolled through a gate in left-center field and spent 90 seconds in
Monument Park, studying the likeness of Mickey Mantle and a plaque
honoring Thurman Munson.</TE>
<TE>   "I looked at them all," Bonds said. "I just thought it was nice."</TE>
<TE>   Bonds enjoyed the crowd too.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought the fans were really good out there. A lot different
than Shea Stadium," he said. "Shea fans are a little rowdier. It was
a lot cleaner here. They had me laughing."</TE>
<TE>   Mussina (9-2) won his sixth consecutive decision, pitching into
the seventh inning.</TE>
<TE>   Mariano Rivera pitched the ninth for his 18th save in 20 chances.</TE>

<DL>ELMONT, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>The woman in Billy Turner's office on Belmont Park's backside asks
him to autograph a book about the Kentucky Derby. She opens the book
to the cover page, showing him signatures from many of horse racing's
greatest trainers, from the dearly departed such as Woody Stephens
and Lucien Laurin to Wayne Lukas and Bob Baffert.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not sure I belong," Turner says with a smile, signing anyway.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe he's right, if he's talking about training graded stakes
winners. But he has done something that no other living trainer has.</LD>
<TE>   Until at least this afternoon, when Baffert sends War Emblem out
in the Belmont Stakes to see whether he can duplicate his wins in the
Kentucky Derby and Preakness, Turner is the only living trainer to
have saddled a Triple Crown winner.</TE>
<TE>   He did it in 1977 with Seattle Slew. The only trainer to do it
since was Laz Barrera, the next year with Affirmed. Barrera died in
1991.</TE>
<TE>   The '77 Belmont was about the first horse race I ever covered. By
the end of that week, I could literally say that everything I knew
about horses, I'd learned from Billy Turner.</TE>
<TE>   He was 37 and had never had a super horse before. With Seattle
Slew entering the Triple Crown races undefeated, New York Racing
Assn. officials warned him about what to expect. Not on the track. He
might have been new to the national scene, but he had his barn at
Belmont and they knew he knew racing. They were concerned about him
off the track, where he did not know much about media.</TE>
<TE>   Turner, like his horse, took it all in stride. Four years after
Secretariat had revived interest in the Triple Crown, there were
dozens of us outside his barn every morning and afternoon of Belmont
week.</TE>
<TE>   When evening fell, Turner would invite writers still around to
join him at the tavern across the road, Esposito's. Considering how
early we all needed to be at the track the next morning, we would
stay far too late, Turner telling stories while we listened and
ordered rounds.</TE>
<TE>   The pattern wasn't all that much different for Turner than at any
other time of the year, but he appreciated the new ears.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   We are walking down memory lane while sitting in his small office
inside a barn he shares near the intersection of Seattle Slew Avenue
and Ruffian Road. He is as lanky as ever, but, at 62, his wavy hair
is graying under the ever-present English driving cap popular on the
steeplechase circuit he rode before becoming a trainer.</TE>
<TE>   In Kentucky, the venerable trainers shook their heads at how
someone so inexperienced could be trusted with such a marvelous
animal and second-guessed Turner's every move.</TE>
<TE>   From that, he learned that the horse could win the race but only
the trainer or the jockey could lose it. That lesson would be
hammered home later in the year, but, on the first Saturday in May,
they won by a length and three-quarters.</TE>
<TE>   He feared only one other 3-year-old that year, the speedy
Cormorant, but he faded in the stretch in the Preakness and finished
fourth.</TE>
<TE>   With home-track advantage in the Belmont, Turner, by now a
confident veteran, defied the stewards who mandated that the horses
should be in the paddock 15 minutes before the race and got his there
moments before the procession to the track. He was pretty sure they
wouldn't scratch Seattle Slew.</TE>
<TE>   He suggested they fine him instead, which they did--$250.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't have everybody do this kind of thing," he told them.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle Slew won by four lengths and Turner figures he would have
broken Secretariat's record for the 1 1/2-mile race if the track had
been fast, as it had been in 1973 for Secretariat's historic
31-length victory, instead of muddy.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a faster horse than Secretariat," Turner says.
"Secretariat would lock into a perfect rhythm and just keep going.
But he wouldn't have had a chance against Slew because he couldn't
accelerate like that."</TE>
<TE>   Seattle Slew was also a feisty competitor who didn't like it when
he was behind, much like War Emblem.</TE>
<TE>   "Angel Cordero was ahead of him on For The Moment at the
three-quarter pole in the Derby and looked over and saw Slew looking
at him, not at the horse but at him," Turner says. "Angel told me it
was the most intimidating look he'd ever gotten, from a horse or a
human. Slew knew he could handle the horse, but it was like he was
sizing up the man. Slew was made up of a different kind of stuff."</TE>
<TE>   The next year, in a victory over Affirmed, Cordero rode Seattle
Slew and said it was like flying an airplane.</TE>
<TE>   By then, Turner was out of the picture, having been fired by the
owners after Seattle Slew had finished fourth in the Swaps at
Hollywood Park in his first race after the Belmont.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Seattle Slew died on May 7, 25 years to the day after he won the
Kentucky Derby.</TE>
<TE>   Turner used to visit Seattle Slew periodically at Three Chimneys,
the Kentucky farm where he stood at stud.</TE>
<TE>   "The last time I saw him was three years ago," Turner says. "He
whinnied when he heard my voice and came to the front of the stall,
sort of demanding I come see him. He was always the boss, even though
I always knew he respected me. It was good to know he liked me too."</TE>
<TE>   Esposito's is no longer with us, either. The brothers who owned it
died and now it is a church.</TE>
<TE>   "We had many a prayer service in there before the races," Turner
laughs, "but it was hardly a church."</TE>
<TE>   The reporters, of course, stopped coming to see him years ago. On
this morning, the horde is at Baffert's barn.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if War Emblem will win today, Turner says, "He's the best
horse. But I've seen a lot of best horses not win the Belmont."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he misses the attention, he says, "I needed a break. The
experience was emotionally exhausting."</TE>
<TE>   But, he says, laughing, a 25-year break is a little excessive.</TE>
<TE>   He has had some decent horses since 1977, but only one, Play On,
made it to a Triple Crown race, finishing second in the 1984
Preakness. He has 21 horses now, most at Belmont and the rest at
Saratoga.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure," he says, "I'd like to do it all over again."</TE>
<TE>   Coincidentally, he says, his eyes lighting up like Broadway on a
Saturday night, he has been working with some investors who have been
asking him to check into dosages, as Baffert and Lukas do, and they
might have a plan to get him back into the big time. I smile and wish
him good luck.</TE>

<KH>Mark Heisler ON THE NBA</KH>
<HD>Nets Just Can't Catch, or Create, Any Breaks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Heisler</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Showtime's still over, we learned again Friday night.</LD>
<LD>   Byron Scott, trying to win a title in this millennium the way he
won his three in the last one, turned his running, gunning Nets loose
again ... 83 points worth.</LD>
<LD>   In two games, both losses, the Nets, the fastest-breaking team
left in the NBA, are averaging 89 points, which Scott's old Lakers
often had in the middle of the third quarter, but in case you hadn't
heard, times have changed.</LD>
<TE>   These days, no one runs against good teams, especially in the
playoffs. The Nets are out to prove they can speed up the waltz-time
Lakers, but it hasn't happened yet.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to get back to playing Net basketball," Scott said
after the Lakers' 106-83 walkover. "And that's being aggressive and
going up and down the floor.</TE>
<TE>   "Jason [Kidd] has pushed it but we don't have guys running with
him. We've got to get guys to run with him."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe they can go back in a time machine and get James Worthy and
Michael Cooper to run the wings?</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Scott has been asked all season about trying to run his
way to a title in a slow-down era and now he has a team in the NBA
Finals.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean," he said before Game 1, "all the questions before we even
started the playoffs were, 'You guys are going to have to run a
half-court offense because you're not going to be able to run in the
playoffs.'</TE>
<TE>   "My question was, 'Why?' If we rebound the ball, defend people and
get the ball to Jason, what's going to stop us running in the
playoffs that didn't stop us during the regular season?"</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, his team is down, 2-0, in the Finals.</TE>
<TE>   Modern teams now work on balancing the floor on offense, keeping
two players back to protect against fastbreaks when the ball changes
hands. And no one does it better than the Lakers, who are masters of
pace, with Phil Jackson's variation of Tex Winter's triangle offense
running the clock down.</TE>
<TE>   OK, so the Nets aren't getting many breaks.</TE>
<TE>   Scott's Laker teams were also fabulous in the half-court, with
Magic Johnson running the show, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar dropping sky
hooks on everyone and Big Game James, not to mention the
sharpshooting Byron.</TE>
<TE>   Let's just say the Nets aren't quite that good.</TE>
<TE>   In the half court, they run the old Princeton motion offense,
which even Jackson has praised as a flowing, entertaining system.
However, Jackson has his defenders sagging to protect against the
famous Princeton back-door cuts the Nets ran for layups all season.
So far, the Nets have none in the Finals.</TE>
<TE>   Let's see, no easy shots on the break, no back-door layups. What's
left? Let's see if we can beat the Lakers shooting 20-footers!</TE>
<TE>   Good luck. The Nets may be athletic, fun to watch and tenacious as
all get out, but shooters they ain't, having placed No. 22 in
three-point percentage during the season.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the other end of the floor, where a whole new array
of problems open up for Scott, starting with the one and only
Shaquille O'Neal, averaging 38 points and shooting 58% so far.</TE>
<TE>   As if in tribute to his old Laker coach, Pat Riley, Scott believes
in manly, Riles-type, knife-between-the-teeth, no-gimmick defense,
with everyone playing his own man. This means only one of them on
O'Neal, which is cruel and unusual punishment for Todd MacCulloch,
Aaron Williams and Jason Collins.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, he's a monster," said Scott after O'Neal went for 40
Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   "The second half, we doubled him a little bit. He kicked [passed]
it, got other guys involved. They knocked down shots.... You know,
he's just a dominant player. I don't know what to really do against
Shaq now."</TE>
<TE>   Good luck. The hours are ticking down to Sunday's Game 3, and
Shaq's coming back for more.</TE>
<TE>   Playing in the East, which is peopled by relative smurfs, the Nets
had only a handful of games against the great, big, West post players
like O'Neal and Tim Duncan.</TE>
<TE>   Having single-covered everyone all season, the Nets came late and
softly when they tried to double-team Friday night and had trouble
rotating to pick up the Laker cutters, besides.</TE>
<TE>   In case you hadn't heard, the Nets are out of the East now and so
far, out of their element. Of course, it's still early so anything is
possible, including further humiliations.</TE>

<HD>Megahertz Tries to Light It Up</HD>

<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Trainer Bobby Frankel ranks third on the all-time list behind the
late Charlie Whittingham and Ron McAnally in stakes victories at
Hollywood Park.</LD>
<LD>   Counting the one he had at the current meet with Skipping in last
month's Jim Murray Memorial Handicap, Frankel, who became a member of
the sport's Hall of Fame in 1995, has 109 stakes victories in
Inglewood. That leaves him one behind McAnally, but Whittingham is
far ahead with 222.</LD>
<LD>   One of the stakes that has eluded Frankel is the Honeymoon
Breeders' Cup Handicap, which will be run for the 51st time today.</LD>
<TE>   Megahertz, a 3-year-old, English-bred filly Frankel trains for
owner Michael Bello, could change that.</TE>
<TE>   A winner once in eight starts in France, Megahertz has been
perfect since coming to this country and joining the Frankel barn.
She won three minor stakes at Santa Anita during the winter and
spring--the Blue Norther on Jan. 9, the Some Sensation on March 15
and the Providencia on April 13.</TE>
<TE>   The Honeymoon, which carries a purse of $200,000-added and is run
at 1 1/8 miles on the turf, will be Megahertz's first venture into
graded stakes company. The Grade II race lured seven others, among
them La Martina, who finished a nose behind the likely favorite in
the Providencia.</TE>
<TE>   With Alex Solis in New York to ride Beat Hollow for Frankel in the
$400,000 Manhattan Handicap, Patrick Valenzuela, Hollywood Park's
leading rider, will be aboard Megahertz for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   McAnally, meanwhile, will be trying for a second consecutive
victory in the Honeymoon after winning a year ago with Innit.</TE>
<TE>   McAnally's representative is longshot Alozaina, an Irish-bred
filly who will be making her U.S. debut after winning one of five in
France, at the Honeymoon distance. She will be ridden by Goncalino
Almeida.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Palmeiro, who was gelded earlier in the year, will try for his
second consecutive victory in the $150,000 All American Handicap
today at Bay Meadows.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Mr. and Mrs. Jerry Moss and trained by John Sadler, the
4-year-old son of Pleasant Tap had won only two of his first 15
before winning an allowance race at Hollywood Park on May 8.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Lumpkins, who is planning to ride at Del Mar this summer,
will be atop Palmeiro. Prodigious, Boss Ego, Moonlight Meeting,
Ironman Dehere, Last Parade, Proceed With Care, Out Of Mind and I've
Decided complete the field in the 1 1/16-mile race.</TE>

<HD>Card Full at Belmont</HD>

<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There is plenty more to be interested in at Belmont Park than merely
War Emblem's quest to become a Triple Crown winner.</LD>
<LD>   The exceptional 12-race card includes four other graded stakes,
two pick fours, one of which has a guaranteed $500,000 pool, and a
pick six with $1 million guaranteed.</LD>
<LD>   Players looking for a single in either pick four--the first is on
races 8-11 and the second is on 9-12--or the pick six could do worse
than settle on Beat Hollow.</LD>
<TE>   A 5-year-old Sadler's Wells horse owned and bred by Juddmonte
Farms and trained by Bobby Frankel, Beat Hollow is the one to beat in
the $400,000 Manhattan Handicap.</TE>
<TE>   The ninth race on the card, the Manhattan is a Grade I at 1 1/4
miles on the turf. A winner of three of four in England and France in
1999 and 2000, Beat Hollow has won two of three since coming to the
U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Jockey Alex Solis, who does not have a mount in the Belmont
Stakes, is in to ride Beat Hollow.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the Belmont Stakes and the Manhattan, the other races in
the pick six are the $250,000 True North Breeders' Cup Handicap at
six furlongs, the $200,000 Just A Game Breeders' Cup Handicap at one
mile on the turf, the $200,000 Riva Ridge Breeders' Cup at seven
furlongs and a $49,000 allowance race at seven furlongs on the turf.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The ninth at Hollywood Park is a wide-open grass
race. It's refreshing to see something other than maiden claimers in
the final race of the day.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: A certain pick-six player or players. There was one
winning ticket Thursday at Hollywood Park, worth $415,482.80.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Hunan. The 6-year-old, who will make his U.S. debut in
today's fifth at Hollywood Park, has not been 1-2-3 in his last 15
races.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three singling Megahertz in the
seventh, using Wyrick and Wheater in the eighth and all in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners (through Thursday): Previous day/meet total: 1/84. Money:
Previous day/meet total $3.40/$472.40. Total money bet: $566.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sammy Sosa hit his 21st home run and rookie right-hander Mark Prior
had a career-high 11 strikeouts and gave up four hits in seven
innings as the visiting Chicago Cubs defeated the Seattle Mariners,
2-0, Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Sosa took over the major league home run lead from Barry Bonds and
Alex Rodriguez. He homered on Joel Pineiro's first pitch of the sixth
inning to break a scoreless tie.</LD>
<LD>   Fred McGriff hit his 10th homer of the season off Pineiro with two
out in the eighth.</LD>
<TE>   Sosa also doubled in his first regular-season game at Safeco
Field. He went 0 for 2 for the National League at Safeco in last
summer's All-Star game.</TE>
<TE>   In the first game between the Cubs and the Mariners, Prior (2-1)
made up for a poor performance in Houston last Saturday, when he
lasted only 3 2/3 innings and gave up seven runs.</TE>
<TE>   Making his fourth start since being called up from triple-A Iowa
on May 22, the former USC standout dazzled the Mariners with his
curve and a fastball clocked at 99 mph.</TE>
<TE>   In his career-high seven innings, Prior threw 124 pitches, 86 for
strikes, and walked one.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona 7, Boston 5--Miguel Batista pitched seven innings to help
the Diamondbacks defeat the Red Sox in their first Fenway Park
appearance.</TE>
<TE>   Batista (3-3) held Boston to one run and three hits through five
innings before giving up three runs in the sixth and one in the
seventh. In all, he gave up five runs and seven hits, two walks and a
wild pitch and struck out five.</TE>
<TE>   Byung-Hyun Kim recorded the last two outs for his 15th save in 17
chances.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 13, Texas 7--Every Atlanta batter either drove in a run or
scored by the third inning at Arlington, Texas, as the Braves roughed
up Chan Ho Park in the shortest start of his career.</TE>
<TE>   Park (2-3), making his sixth start of the season after signing a
$65 million, five-year contract last winter, gave up nine runs and
eight hits and got only four outs.</TE>
<TE>   About the only good news for Texas was Ivan Rodriguez returning
from the disabled list and going four for four with a walk, scoring
twice and driving in a run. Rodriguez, who was out with back
problems, doubled in his first two at-bats since April 14.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 12, Florida 7--Torii Hunter had three hits and three
RBIs at Minneapolis as the Twins ended the Marlins' four-game winning
streak.</TE>
<TE>   Every Twin starter had a hit and an RBI other than Corey Koskie.
David Ortiz was the only starter who failed to score a run.</TE>
<TE>   Johan Santana (1-0), making his first start of the season, had a
career-high eight strikeouts and gave up four hits in 5 1/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 12, Kansas City 6--Tino Martinez homered and had a
season-high four hits as the Cardinals won at Kansas City, Mo.</TE>
<TE>   Albert Pujols doubled three times and drove in three runs for the
Cardinals, whose 12 runs were a season high.</TE>
<TE>   Darryl Kile (4-3) went 5 1/3 innings, giving up three earned runs
and six hits.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 4, Chicago White Sox 3--Tony Armas Jr. won for the first
time in five starts, and Troy O'Leary hit a two-run homer as the
Expos won at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Kenny Lofton stole his 500th career base in the sixth inning for
Chicago, and Frank Thomas hit his 12th home run of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 8, Colorado 0--Roy Halladay pitched a two-hitter for his
first shutout of the season and the Blue Jays won at Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   Halladay (7-2) didn't allow a baserunner until Benny Agbayani led
off the sixth with a double into the gap in right-center. It was his
third career shutout.</TE>
<TE>   New York Mets 4, Cleveland 3--Roberto Alomar won in his return to
Jacobs Field and Al Leiter, facing the Indians for the first time
since the 1997 World Series, pitched into the eighth as the Mets
ended a five-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Alomar went one for four in his first appearance in Cleveland
since being traded to New York on Dec. 11 in a blockbuster,
eight-player trade. Edgardo Alfonzo drove in two runs.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 11, Detroit 1--Scott Rolen went four for four and
drove in five runs to lead the Phillies at Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Jimmy Rollins and Marlon Anderson had three hits each in
Philadelphia's sixth victory in 28 road games. Detroit has lost four
in a row and eight of nine.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego 8, Tampa Bay 4--Ramon Vazquez hit a grand slam and Brian
Lawrence gave up three runs in seven innings as the Padres ended a
seven-game losing streak with a victory at St. Petersburg, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego's Bubba Trammell had a solo homer in his return to
Tropicana Field.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 5, Houston 3--Terrence Long hit two solo homers, and Mark
Mulder won his third consecutive start as the Athletics won at
Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   Mulder (5-4) gave up three runs and five hits in 7 1/3 innings,
striking out eight. The lanky left-hander has rebounded after losing
a career-high four consecutive starts and spending nearly a month on
the disabled list.</TE>

<LD>Today's officiating topic: Shaquille O'Neal's tendency to roll into
the lane on his free throws, sometimes before the ball reaches the
rim or the vicinity of it.</LD>
<LD>   It was a favorite topic of Dallas owner Mark Cuban and the Phoenix
Suns this season, and on Thursday Sacramento Coach Rick Adelman
joined the chorus.</LD>
<LD>   "Who's that?" O'Neal said Friday night.</LD>
<TE>   Adelman. Of the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know who that is," he said, deadpan.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the riding of referees by opposing coaches and players,
O'Neal was called for only one lane violation on his own shot in 717
attempts this season.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal said he was in the bathroom when someone shouted about
Adelman being on television, talking about O'Neal's free-throw
mechanics. O'Neal made 63.8% of his free throws in the Western
Conference finals, and he assumed that annoyed Adelman and the Kings,
who haven't yet let go of their seven-game defeat.</TE>
<TE>   "If I would've missed them, he wouldn't have said nothing," O'Neal
said. "Don't cry. Dry your eye. Here comes Shaq with these four
little guys."</TE>
<TE>   Four little guys ... ?</TE>
<TE>   "My teammates," he said, smiling.</TE>
<TE>   So, O'Neal seemed unconcerned, as did Phil Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, I like the rhythm that he's in on the free-throw line,"
the Laker coach said. "I think that's incidental and nit-picking."</TE>
<TE>   When the Suns made an issue of the apparent violation, O'Neal lost
his touch for a time, then was in and out of the lineup for seven
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With the luxury tax looming and the Lakers relying more on players
willing to play beside O'Neal and Kobe Bryant and for a championship
at a cut salary, it becomes more critical that O'Neal maintain his
weight and fix his arthritic toe, Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's obvious that ... as a franchise we can't go forward if he's
going to play 50 games a year, or 55 games a year, or 60," he said.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal will consider nonsurgical procedures after the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the major thing that we're talking about in the
off-season, that Shaquille and I have been discussing over the last
years, is how to come back ... where he doesn't have to deal with the
weight, first and foremost," Jackson said. "That's a difficult
proposition, the older you get.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe start playing in March, April, something like that. That
would be what I'm sure he really wants to do."</TE>

<KH>GAME 2LAKERS 106, NEW JERSEY 83</KH>
<HD>Smurfing the Nets: Once again, there is no answer for
O'Neal as Lakers take a 2-0 advantage</HD>
<DH>In What May Have Been Lakers' Last Home Game, Big Guy Is
Big Difference</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On so many nights, the other 11 pushed him along as best they could,
for this, for the handful of games in June they believed would make
them champions again.</LD>
<LD>   Shaquille O'Neal, playing through all that tormented him for so
long, scored 40 points Friday night at Staples Center, where the
Lakers defeated the New Jersey Nets, 106-83, for a two-games-to-none
lead in the best-of-seven NBA Finals.</LD>
<LD>   Their precious three-peat, what has driven them all for so long,
is two victories away, because they've come upon a more seamless
game, and they've come back to O'Neal, just in time for the Nets.</LD>
<TE>   Charismatic again, grinning and acting up again, O'Neal took 12
rebounds and had eight assists, a game high. When the Lakers needed
him late in the Western Conference finals, when only he could save
them, O'Neal scored 41 points in Game 6, then 35 in Game 7.</TE>
<TE>   When they needed him to overwhelm the Nets, too proud--or
stubborn--to double-team with all their hearts, O'Neal scored 36
points in Game 1, then those 40 in Game 2. Since 1985, when the
league went to the 2-3-2 Finals format, no team has come back from an
0-2 deficit.</TE>
<TE>   "Can't do nothing with him," said Kobe Bryant, whose 24 points
were quiet in comparison. "Can't do anything. You know, he's like
Wilt, Kareem, Jordan, all those other guys.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing you can do about that. He's just going to
demoralize the team. Pretty much just gonna have to deal with that."</TE>
<TE>   Their chins up, their words brave, the Nets trudged back to New
Jersey. Game 3 is Sunday at Continental Airlines Arena.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't done anything," Laker Coach Phil Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Jackson was moved to write on the locker-room grease board:
"That's more like it."</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, O'Neal dedicated his near triple-double to Sacramento
King Coach Rick Adelman, who, four days after being eliminated by
O'Neal, griped again that no one has the courage to officiate the
Laker center. O'Neal made 12 of 14 free throws, often posing over the
swishes, his right wrist hinged poetically over his head.</TE>
<TE>   "Can I go a day without somebody saying something negative about
me?" O'Neal asked rhetorically. "So, that's for those who question
me. I was upset today.</TE>
<TE>   "The guys got me the ball and, you know, we have a little formula
that our game goes through. Our formula is simple: First one to four
games. Now, we got two."</TE>
<TE>   The man who once, so long ago, could not win a championship now
carries them in bunches.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers suddenly--and again--are as large as O'Neal makes them.
He scored 12 points in the first quarter, in case there was any doubt
about Game 1, and about the risk Net Coach Byron Scott was taking
with his inattentive defensive strategies. He had 11 in the second
quarter, and then 13 in the third, when the lead went from four to 20
in 9 1/2 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, it wouldn't be a Laker game if they went end-to-end, so
the Nets twice drew to within six points in the fourth quarter before
the Lakers finished on a 23-6 run.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Kidd scored 17 points, all in the second half, and Kerry
Kittles scored 23 points.</TE>
<TE>   Scott smiled wearily afterward and said what they all had been
thinking, from Todd MacCulloch to Aaron Williams to young Jason
Collins, all game, all in way over their heads.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a monster," Scott said. "I don't know what to do with him
right now. The second half, we doubled him a little bit. He kicked it
out, got other guys involved. They knocked down shots. You know, when
we tried to come on the dribble, he's still stepping through, getting
his shot off. You know, he's just a dominant player. I don't know
what to really do against Shaq right now."</TE>
<TE>   Rick Fox scored 10 points, Robert Horry scored nine and Derek
Fisher scored 12. The Lakers had 16 fastbreak points and made nine of
16 three-point attempts. In the second half, they made eight of 12
three-pointers, so there was nowhere for the Nets to go, other than
back to Jersey for Games 3, 4 and, if necessary, 5.</TE>
<TE>   So, at the end, the Lakers waved.</TE>
<TE>   A handful of them stood on the floor and looked to the top deck,
and to the folks dancing in the private boxes, and to the floor
level, and they waved, as though to say, "Thank you," as if to say,
"See you at the parade."</TE>
<TE>   They'd deny it, of course.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets' desperation now can't be understated. After Game 1,
Kenyon Martin, a surly sort anyway, mulled the potential of a Game 2
loss and said, "If we do, then it will be over quick."</TE>
<TE>   When they shot 39.4% from the floor, including 31.3% from the
three-point arc in Game 1, they Nets said they were a little nervous,
that they'd be over that quickly. So, in Game 2, they shot 34.9% from
the floor, 27.3% from the arc.</TE>
<TE>   "Please, let's get out of here right now," Net guard Lucious
Harris said. "Please, let's go back home and come Game 3, we still
have a chance."</TE>
<TE>   Thing is, O'Neal, too, is going home, to Newark. To the
conclusion, perhaps, of the Finals.</TE>
<TE>   "He's seemed to gather energy during the playoffs," Jackson said.
"You know, that's been the remarkable part of it, that he's energized
by the playoffs. This was his show."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal was glad to have it. His mother, Lucille, sat courtside, in
a seat opposite the Laker bench. He occasionally made eye contact,
when his dunks were particularly ferocious, and she called him,
"Baby," and leaped from the chair.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we are gaining energy because in a lot of people's minds
we're not supposed to be here," he said. "We had a sub-par season. We
had a sub-par playoffs. We know what it takes to get to this level.
Now we're here, we're just hungry and we want to have the feeling at
the end of this year that we had the last two years. Like I said,
we're just going to our form, first one to four."</TE>
<TE>   And that would get them to three.</TE>

<TE>   Watching Game 7 against the Kings was one of the most fun and
frightening sporting experiences of my life. Knowing that the outcome
of the season hinged on every layup, free throw, rebound and field
goal had me on the edge of my couch. Game 7 was "Hoosiers," "Rudy"
and "The Natural" all rolled up into one. The Laker road win over a
very good Sacramento team showed that they can play with as much
heart as style.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Forget the Phil Jackson critics. The team that was down by 20
points at the end of the first quarter of Game 4 had no business
winning Game 7. He transformed the impotent to the sublime. Call him
Zen-Master, Guru, Yogi or Savant. I call him Phil--Mr. Jackson if he
pleases.</TE>

<TE>   In all the years I watched Byron Scott play for the Lakers, I
never realized he was a southpaw until I read his quote in today's
[June 4] paper: "Phil Jackson is one of the best coaches in the
league." Considering an argument can be made that Phil Jackson is one
of the best coaches of all time, Scott's comment must certainly be
taken as a left-handed compliment.</TE>

<TE>   Congratulations to the Kings. They may not have won Game 7, but
Arco Arena lived up to its reputation of being the loudest arena in
the league. Only problem is, I'm not sure if the high decibels were
due to the cowbells going clang-clang, or the Kings' shots going
clank-clank.</TE>

<TE>   Nine years ago, when the Lakers traded Sam Perkins for Doug
Christie, I thought it was a mistake. Turns out to have been a great
move. The Lakers wouldn't have won the Sacramento series without him.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Let me be the first to congratulate the Lakers for a job well done
against Sacramento. But for all this new talk of a "heart of a
champion," allow me to humbly pose one suggestion to the L.A. squad:
Had you demonstrated even a hint of this so-called winner's heart in
January and February (let alone for any four consecutive quarters
since), you would have had home-court advantage in the playoffs. This
would have made your task the last two weeks considerably easier.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   At a time when most of the globe is patting the Kings on the back
for their effort against the Lakers and crowning them "soon to be NBA
champions," I'd like to offer a more realistic perspective.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings just failed to beat a team that entered the playoffs
perhaps arrogantly and sloppily, injured, shooting poorly, and
playing defense only in spurts, at least in the beginning. If they
cannot emerge victorious with those factors working in their favor,
what makes anyone think that they will when the Lakers are at full
strength?</TE>
<TE>   Had Kobe Bryant not gotten food poisoning, this series might not
have been close. I can't imagine what it would have been like without
Mike Bibby.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Holten</TE>
<TE>   Manhattan Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I propose that, henceforth, any player who costs his team a
victory by committing a totally inexcusable mistake, such as drawing
a technical foul in the fourth quarter of a Game 7, be accused of
having pulled a Webber.</TE>
<TE>   Burt Prelutsky</TE>
<TE>   North Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the aftermath of what was obviously an emotional and intense
series, it was simply amazing (but not shocking) to hear players and
coaches from both teams continue with their trash-talking.</TE>
<TE>   "They felt it was their time. It was not their time." (Shaquille
O'Neal)</TE>
<TE>   "If you want to say they're the better team, you say it, but I'm
not." (Rick Adelman)</TE>
<TE>   "I know the Kings deserved to win." (Chris Webber)</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's obvious what happened in Game 6; that's all I have
to say." (Adelman)</TE>
<TE>   I remember something I used to tell my players when I coached
youth sports: If you lose, you have nothing to say; if you win, you
don't have to say anything.</TE>

<TE>   Bill Plaschke is such a great writer. Doesn't he deserve a plum
assignment, like covering the World Cup? Wouldn't Mrs. P. enjoy
seeing Japan on the paper's dime? Please do something, anything, to
keep Plaschke from writing any more articles on the Lakers and the
NBA playoffs. As former Laker Eddie Jones once said, "Some people
just don't know anything about basketball."</TE>
<TE>   Everybody knew who Eddie was talking about.</TE>

<TE>   Well, I guess it's official. The Lakers have now lowered
themselves down to the rest of the league. I've been a season-ticket
holder for the last three years and have gone to games since 1985 and
I have just one thing to say to the Staples Center sound crew: Shut
up!</TE>
<TE>   Why am I told, during a poorly played game by some bad recording,
to "Make some noise" or "We can't hear you"? Whatever happened to
letting the play on the court determine the crowd noise?</TE>

<LD>Here it is, the height of the Stanley Cup playoffs. Summer is just
around the corner. All is well in Hockeytown L.A. and boom, I receive
in the mail a "2002-2003 Los Angeles Kings Season Invoice." Although
they included only a modest 3.85% price increase!? That is due by
June 14!? The current season isn't over and they're asking us to pony
up for the next one.</LD>
<LD>   Now I wouldn't mind if they would pick up a high-priced free agent
with the interest they will earn on my money, but what are the
chances of that happening?</LD>
<LD>   Hopefully my 2001 tax refund is just around the corner to help pay
for the tickets.</LD>

<LD>Dear Eric Karros,</LD>
<LD>   I've got a big fat roasted crow on order for lunch today because
of you, and I couldn't be happier that I'll be eating it.</LD>
<LD>   I want to publicly apologize for giving up on you. I admit I was
thinking some pretty bad thoughts about you and your future in
baseball. Heck, I was ready to trade you to Tampa Bay for a ball girl
and some sun block. I didn't believe the reports of your bad back,
not for one minute. I simply figured that you were a dead fastball
hitter who could no longer get around on one.</LD>
<TE>   Well, I was wrong. Now that we're into June and the season is a
couple of months old, I know that your stats this year are no fluke,
and that your terrible season-and-a-half slump is over. You are back,
and I cannot begin to tell you how good it is to see it.</TE>
<TE>   So, please accept this apology and continue to lead this, the most
enjoyable Dodger club in years, to the Series.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Smith</TE>
<TE>   San Gabriel</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I see now that Kevin Brown, a supposedly physically fit, major
league millionaire baseball star, has severely injured his back
catching his child while falling off of the bed.</TE>
<TE>   Hey Kevin, here's a trick to keeping your balance: Take your
wallet out of your pocket before you play with the kids.</TE>

<TE>   It sure was refreshing to read that Eric Karros has come out
against the Colorado Rockies for doctoring the baseballs at Denver.
It seems they don't fly as far when they're heavier and Eric is
concerned for "the integrity of the game." Wonderful!</TE>
<TE>   I'm looking forward to hearing that he's also in favor of steroid
testing for the same reason.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Monson</TE>
<TE>   Temecula</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Judging by some of the remarks in your May 30 article, "Steroid
Problem Is Divisive Issue," it would seem some baseball people are on
other drugs besides steroids.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee Manage Jerry Royster, a former player, says it's a dead
issue because there is no rule against it.</TE>
<TE>   Hey, pop-fly brain, there is a rule--it's called the law. Steroids
are illegal--unless you can prove that every player using them has a
doctor's prescription.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Blue</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Well, so much for rebuilding the Dodger farm system. Why is it
that no matter how much research is published using provable
statistics, the Dodgers' brass seems oblivious to it?</TE>
<TE>   Why can I, in just a few seconds, find pages and pages of
documents proving that high school players who are drafted high
rarely, if ever, pan out, but the Dodgers cannot? And high school
pitchers? Forget about it! They have been universally a huge
collection of busts. So what does Dan Evans do? With his first five
picks he takes four high school pitchers and a high school catcher.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger fans, be prepared: In five years we will still be reading
articles how the Dodgers' hands are tied because of an empty farm
system. And, oh yeah--the Oakland A's? They didn't take a single high
school player until the 19th round. Which team would you like to be
rooting for over the next seven-10 years?</TE>

<LD>The Fairplex Park racing meet being moved to Santa Anita, whether
it's this year or next, is one of the most ill-conceived ideas to
come down the pike in quite some time.</LD>
<LD>   Nowhere is there a mention of the long tradition of fair racing in
Pomona.</LD>
<LD>   Nowhere is there a mention of how the little guy (lesser-known
jockeys, trainers, owners) rely on those three weeks to survive.</LD>
<TE>   Nowhere is there a single utterance of the most important thing:
What is good for the racing fan? If the Fairplex Park meeting
accomplishes one thing, it is this: It creates new fans.</TE>
<TE>   Do the racing executives care? Of course not. They thumb their
noses at the fans who exist, and don't give a road apple about the
much needed future fan base. Shame on them.</TE>

<HD>Nets Just Can't Deal With Shaq</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICK MAJERUS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This is how bad it was for New Jersey, which flat-out got shellacked:
It's tough to win a game once, much less twice, but that's exactly
what they Lakers did. And they did it easily.</LD>
<LD>   The Nets made a run, right after Kobe Bryant missed a dunk. But
this time, unlike Game 1, the Lakers just gathered themselves, took a
deep breath and regained control. For the Nets, it was one of the
bigger non-run runs I've ever seen. It wasn't like New Jersey had
anything to do with it. The Lakers just got a little complacent, got
full of themselves. But then, yawn, shift gears, back in control, end
of game.</LD>
<LD>   I like Derek Fisher a lot. He had a lot to do with what happened.
He did a great job on Jason Kidd, especially in the first half. He
was like some kind of adhesive, like the stickum wide receivers put
on their hands. He couldn't have gotten any closer to Kidd if he'd
been the resin.</LD>
<TE>   And then there was Shaquille O'Neal, taking on one of the more
porous defenses of our time. Republicans are talking about Tom
Daschle being this big obstructionist. Well, New Jersey, sign him up,
because there isn't anybody on your team obstructing anything that
Shaq is doing.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody puts a body on Shaq. They've got three guys to play him,
which means 18 fouls, and I think they better use all 18. Looks like
the ship is sinking anyway, so why not try? Shaq's got them so
intimidated it's silly. I think they got one decent shot deep in the
post all night, and that was Aaron Williams, who got really bold and
went to the basket--when Samaki Walker was in.</TE>
<TE>   I loved the story the other day where Shaq was asked about Todd
MacCullouch and called him "respectable." Shaq played it just like
the Zen Master taught him. Respectable? Hell, he threw the guy a bone
and now the dog has no bite. MacCullough took it like somebody had
just named him all-world or something.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey needs a new plan to cover Shaq. The Nets have to fight
him for that real estate. Right now, Shaq's like a condo developer
who just muscled his way onto the Promenade in Santa Monica and has
set up shop. Nobody gave him the land. He just took it.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets are getting no pressure on Shaq from their post players.
They might as well go to the mascot. He'd do better. They also have
to make him work defensively. Right now, he is like a guy in a lounge
chair on a cruise.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets are also making it easy on the Lakers because they are
applying no pressure on the perimeter. The Lakers, who are awfully
good at moving the ball quickly and getting it in to Shaq in scoring
position, are having a field day. Quarterbacks in the NFL should have
this much time to get set up. Brett Favre would play 10 more years if
he were left alone this much.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers are so good at so many things, that you really have to
pressure them, obstruct them, play all out all the time. They want a
score and know how to get it. They always know where and when their
points are coming.</TE>
<TE>   The other side of the coin is New Jersey. The Nets are trying to
do the hardest thing in basketball. They are trying to run a
fastbreak, but when the fastbreak isn't there, they are trying to
immediately change tempo and run a rhythm offense to the second side
of the floor.</TE>
<TE>   Unless the Nets can find a great deal of energy at home, this one
is nearing the victory lap. But I'm glad I've been along for the
ride, because it has changed me.</TE>
<TE>   I've decided that I will now take films of Shaq shooting free
throws and show them to my Utah team. This remains the most amazing
part of this entire postseason. We all knew the Lakers were great and
could repeat. But did we have any idea, one iota of an inkling, that
(take a deep breath here) SHAQ COULD SHOOT FREE THROWS!</TE>
<TE>   Look at the form. There is none. He is the antiChrist of the foul
line. Yet those babies keep going down.</TE>
<TE>   He reminds me of one of those senior citizens in Florida, driving
along the highway, hands in a death lock at 10 and 2 o'clock, poised
for that bold move from the far left lane.</TE>
<TE>   He is the living example of the power of concentration. There used
to be seven wonders in the world. Now there are eight.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rick Majerus, Utah basketball coach, will be The Times' guest
analyst on the Lakers for the rest of the playoffs. Majerus, the
fourth-winningest active coach in major college basketball, will
begin his 14th season at Utah this fall.</TE>

<HD>Mexico Can't Relax</HD>
<DH>Group G: Ecuador needs a victory more in second game.
Mexico's Aguirre will coach Spanish club after World Cup.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SENDAI, Japan</DL>
<LD>Mexico Coach Javier Aguirre's message to his players has been urgent
if unoriginal: There's no tomorrow.</LD>
<LD>   There's no tomorrow for Ecuador if it cannot beat Mexico on
Sunday, there's no tomorrow for Mexico if it cannot salvage at least
a tie against its Latin American rival ... although, to be perfectly
honest about it, Aguirre's future is fairly set, win, lose or draw.</LD>
<LD>   Aguirre concluded negotiations with Osasuna this week and has
agreed to coach the Spanish club, for whom he once played, after the
World Cup. Aguirre's resuscitation of Mexico's dead-in-the-water
World Cup qualification campaign last year caught Osasuna's
attention, and Mexico's 1-0 victory over Croatia apparently sealed
the deal.</LD>
<TE>   So Aguirre, 44, knows where he is headed.</TE>
<TE>   The same cannot be said for his hard-working but limited Mexican
team, which surprised many with its performance against Croatia. Now
the second round is within sight, making a victory or a tie against
Ecuador, a 2-0 loser to Italy in its opener, essential.</TE>
<TE>   "They come in with a defeat," Aguirre said of Ecuador, "which
makes them very dangerous, because there is no tomorrow. It's going
to be a do-or-die match."</TE>
<TE>   Mexico holds a 5-1-2 all-time advantage over Ecuador. The teams
first played in 1970, but not again until 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Aguirre said he wants to make sure his players guard against
overconfidence.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to maintain the mentality of winning, because this is a
game where we will either win or die," Aguirre said. "I told [the
players], 'Imagine if you had lost to Croatia. How then would we
expect to come out? There's no tomorrow, so we'd be out to kill.'</TE>
<TE>   "How do you think Ecuador is going to come out? Exactly like that.
If you don't expect them to be that way, then we are in trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Ecuador's loss to Italy was the country's first appearance in a
World Cup. Ecuador qualified by finishing second in South American
qualifying--behind Argentina and a point ahead of Brazil.</TE>
<TE>   Aguirre said he was concerned by Ecuador's team speed because
"it's better than ours. In addition, they handle the ball well and
they have some scary players."</TE>
<TE>   But Ecuador will most likely be without veteran midfielder and
team leader Alex Aguinaga, who has not fully recovered from a thigh
strain.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Hernan Dario Gomez has announced he plans to replace
Aguinaga in the lineup with Ivan Kaviedes, who scored three goals
during qualifying.</TE>
<TE>   Aguirre had two complaints about his team's performance against
Croatia. He felt Mexico did not play well around Croatia's penalty
area, failing to create scoring chances. And he was not pleased with
how his players dealt with aerial balls, often giving up the fight in
the air because the Croatians were taller and more physical.</TE>
<TE>   Two additions to the eligibility list could help solve the first
problem. Midfielders Jesus Arellano and Joahan Rodriguez, who sat out
the Croatia game because of red-card suspensions, give Aguirre two
new attacking options. He is expected to use them on the right flank,
displacing either Gabriel Caballero or Sigifredo Mercado or both.</TE>
<TE>   None of the Mexican players are going to grow six inches
overnight, so Aguirre has emphasized in practice a more aggressive
approach when jockeying to win headers.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand they're tall, but we have to compete," Aguirre said.
"Sometimes we didn't compete, and that worries me."</TE>

<HD>Williams Enters Plea of Not Guilty</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former NBA star Jayson Williams pleaded not guilty Friday to charges
he fatally shot a limousine driver and then tried to make it look as
if the victim fired the gun himself.</LD>
<LD>   Williams entered the plea to first-degree manslaughter and other
charges during an arraignment in Flemington, N.J., before Superior
Court Judge Edward M. Coleman. He remained free on $270,000 bail.</LD>
<LD>   Williams, accompanied by his wife, Tanya, did not speak during or
after the hearing. Defense attorney Joseph Hayden entered the plea on
his behalf.</LD>
<TE>   If convicted on all charges, he could face nearly 45 years in
prison.</TE>
<TE>   A second man, John W. Gordnick, pleaded not guilty to charges that
he tampered with evidence to conceal Williams' role in the Feb. 14
shooting of limousine driver Costas Christofi.</TE>
<TE>   Gordnick remained free on $50,000 bail and faces a maximum
sentence of nearly 12 years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Acting Hunterdon County Prosecutor Steven C. Lember said his staff
has almost finished its investigation and has turned over two packets
of evidence to the defense. Within weeks, Lember said, defense
attorneys also will receive copies of crime-scene photographs.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides are lining up nationally known experts, including
forensic expert Henry Lee and pathologist Michael Baden, both of whom
testified during O.J. Simpson's trial in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   The judge scheduled a status hearing for Sept. 6.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors originally charged Williams with second-degree
manslaughter, which required them to prove only that he recklessly
caused the driver's death.</TE>
<TE>   But a grand jury raised the charge last month, finding Williams
demonstrated extreme indifference to human life.</TE>
<TE>   First-degree manslaughter carries a maximum penalty of 30 years in
prison. The maximum for the lesser charge is 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Hayden has called the shooting "a tragic accident." He told the
judge Friday that he planned to file a motion challenging the grand
jury's decision to raise the manslaughter charge.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Houston Rocket Coach Rudy Tomjanovich will be among the team's
representatives who will go to China to meet with officials of the
Shanghai Sharks regarding the availability of 7-foot-5 Yao Ming.</TE>
<TE>   The Rockets could select Yao with the No. 1 pick in the June 26
NBA draft, but there are details to be worked out with the Shanghai
team and government officials.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of concerns on both sides, so there needs to be a
face-to-face meeting to discuss the issues," Rocket General Manager
Carroll Dawson said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting is not about Yao's abilities on the court but is about
clearing up details of his availability throughout the NBA season,
Dawson said.</TE>
<TE>   "Basketball is not the issue, we've seen him play a number of
times since he was 17," he said. "We think he has a tremendous
upside. This is not a basketball meeting. It is the other things that
we have to get wrapped up."</TE>
<TE>   Dawson said the Rockets received an invitation from Shark
President Bai Li and General Manager Li Yaomin.</TE>
<TE>   Tomjanovich and Dawson will be joined on the trip by Rocket
general counsel Michael Goldberg and director of media relations
Nelson Luis.</TE>

<HD>It's Not Futbol, but NBA's Global Appeal Is Growing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The World Cup draws an estimated 500 million viewers from around the
world every day.</LD>
<LD>   The NBA Finals certainly don't have that kind of global appeal,
but they draw plenty of international attention.</LD>
<LD>   There are no official estimates as to how many people worldwide
watch the NBA Finals, but NBA Executive Vice President Heidi
Ueberroth said audiences are continuing to grow.</LD>
<TE>   Play-by-play announcer Anthony Suntay of the Philippines, who
called Friday night's game from Staples Center, said about 15 million
of the 76 million people in his country would be watching Game 2,
which was televised live at 9 a.m. Suntay said the NBA has been
popular in his country for nearly two decades.</TE>
<TE>   Japanese television play-by-play announcer Naotaka Hirota said
about a million people would be watching in his country. The game was
shown live at 10 a.m. in Japan.</TE>
<TE>   He said the World Cup in his country is drawing television
audiences that are about three times that.</TE>
<TE>   The NBA Finals are available in more than 205 countries and 750
million homes. The coverage is delivered in 36 languages, including
Creole, Hindi, Tagalog, Arabic and Maltese.</TE>
<TE>   Counting the television, Internet, film and digital technology
available through NBA Entertainment, each game has the ability to
reach 2.5 billion people.</TE>
<TE>   More than 150 international media members, mostly print
journalists, are covering the Finals in person, and 30 international
networks are beaming the games back to their countries.</TE>
<TE>   Game 2 was televised at 3 a.m. in Italy. Italian commentator
Federico Buffa, who was at Staples Center on Friday night, said maybe
300,000 Italians would stay up to watch the game.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, he said 80% of the country's 60 million people
would be watching Italy take on Croatia in the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "It a different audience," Buffa said. "The NBA attracts more
youngsters."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if Kobe Bryant, who lived in Italy in his youth, was the
most popular NBA player in his county, Buffa said that honor belonged
to Allen Iverson.</TE>
<TE>   "The people like his me-against-the-world attitude," Buffa said.
"But Kobe is very popular, maybe No. 3. Shaquille O'Neal is also very
popular."</TE>
<TE>   As for how Buffa became Italy's top basketball commentator, he
said it wasn't because of his basketball skills.</TE>
<TE>   "Mainly, I'm a journalist," Buffa said.</TE>
<TE>   Howard Cosell would have loved that.</TE>
<TE>   NBA Commissioner David Stern, interviewed before the game, said he
is pleased with the game's international growth and sees room for
more growth.</TE>
<TE>   He cited the NBA Entertainment channel's NBA TV, available in 10
million DirecTV homes and 10 million digital cable homes, as an area
where growth is expected. The channel this season was carried in
three foreign countries--Israel, Turkey and Greece. He said it would
be available in 10 foreign countries next season.</TE>
<TE>   NBA Executive Vice President Gregg Winik, who has been with the
NBA Entertainment division since 1990 and whose father Barry was with
NBA Entertainment before that, says the 1992 Olympic Dream Team was
the catalyst for huge international growth.</TE>
<TE>   The other thing, Winik said, was the arrival of satellite
technology in the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "We used to have to ship tapes and literally bicycle them around
the world," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Stern established NBA Entertainment, the equivalent of NFL Films,
when he was NBA executive vice president in 1982.</TE>
<TE>   "We had spent $130,000 to buy each team a VCR and pay someone to
monitor each telecast and ship them to New York," he said. "We needed
to centralize things."</TE>
<TE>   NBA Entertainment's initial functions included documenting games
and events and creating programs such as "NBA Inside Stuff" to
promote the league.</TE>
<TE>   International television coverage soon fell under NBA
Entertainment's umbrella.</TE>
<TE>   Stern remembers when a man representing Italian TV came into his
office in 1983.</TE>
<TE>   "CBS had cut its coverage to four regular-season games and the man
wanted to know if we could provide him with game telecasts," Stern
said. "He wanted to know how much we would charge per game.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'What was CBS charging you?' He said, '$5,000 a game.' I
said, 'Then that's what we will charge.' "</TE>
<TE>   And that was the start of the NBA becoming a global sport.</TE>

<HD>Same Question Swamps Scott</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A throng of reporters from around the world wondered whether New
Jersey Net Coach Byron Scott would change his solo coverage on Laker
center Shaquille O'Neal for Game 2. Scott smiled broadly when the
first question was asked.</LD>
<LD>   "You think I'm going to sit here and tell you, right?" he said,
chuckling. "OK. I've also got some property in the swamp I want to
sell you, too...."</LD>
<LD>   Another reporter spoke up. "Actually, I had the same question,"
the fellow said.</LD>
<TE>   To which Scott managed to say above the rising laughter, "I've got
the same answer for you too. Next question?"</TE>
<TE>   A few minutes later, someone else wished to talk about the Nets'
plans for O'Neal on Friday. "Just to clarify, you're going to play
Shaq straight up?"</TE>
<TE>   Said Scott: "Did I say that?"</TE>
<TE>   Adopting a more serious tone, he praised Jason Collins, who had
perhaps the best success of any of the three centers whom Scott
played. O'Neal had 36 points and 16 rebounds in Game 1.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought Jason Collins did a terrific job," Scott said. "I
thought he did a better job of keeping his body on Shaq than Aaron
[Williams] and Todd [MacCulloch]. Will he play more? Probably.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as playing single coverage or double- or triple-teaming
Shaq, like I said, I've got some property in New Jersey that I'd like
you to see."</TE>
<TE>   When the game began, MacCulloch matched up against O'Neal. The
one-on-one strategy didn't pan out, however, with O'Neal scoring 12
points on five-of-seven shooting in the opening quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Williams and Collins tried to check O'Neal and met with similarly
unsuccessful results. O'Neal had 23 points and the Lakers led, 49-43.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Nets vowed to play better in the first quarter Friday than
they did in the opening 12 minutes Wednesday in Game 1. They were
every bit as bad, however. They trailed, 29-14, in Game 1, making six
of 22 shots (27.3%). They trailed, 27-21, in Game 2, making six of 25
shots (24%).</TE>
<TE>   "I think we're over it," reserve guard Lucious Harris had said
before the game when asked about the Nets' first-quarter woes. "We'll
see in Game 2. I think that we will come out a little better in Game
2."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It took 22 years for one of the four former American Basketball
Assn. teams to advance to the NBA Finals. But the Nets became the
third ABA team in four seasons to make it to the championship round,
following the Spurs in 1999 and the Pacers in 2000.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Beth Daniel topped a short list of survivors Friday at the LPGA
Championship, making a birdie on her last hole to escape with a
one-under-par 70 and a two-stroke lead over Karrie Webb at
Wilmington, Del.</LD>
<LD>   Daniel, the only player to break par in both rounds at punishing
DuPont Country Club, was at 137 and had the 36-hole lead at a major
championship for the first time in 10 years.</LD>
<LD>   Only four players remained under par entering the weekend--Daniel,
Webb, Se Ri Pak and Carin Koch.</LD>
<TE>   Annika Sorenstam finished with a five-over 76 and was nine strokes
back entering a weekend that only figures to get more difficult. It
was her worst score in relation to par on the LPGA Tour since a 79 in
the second round of the 1999 Samsung World Championship--62
tournaments ago.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wayne Levi had an up-and-down round that included six birdies and
four bogeys, but his 68 gave him a one-stroke lead through two rounds
of the PGA Seniors Championship at Akron, Ohio. Larry Nelson, Larry
Ziegler and Walter Hall also shot 68s and were at 138.... Loren
Roberts, who failed to qualify for next week's U.S. Open at Bethpage
State Park, shot a three-under 68 to take a one-stroke lead over
David Gossett during the suspended second round of the Buick Classic
at Harrison, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   College Basketball</TE>
<TE>   A women's coach forced to resign a day after Vanderbilt hired him
did indeed earn two graduate college degrees as he stated on a
resume, Miami of Ohio officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Questions surrounding Tom Collen's academic background cost him
his job at Vanderbilt, which he took after quitting as coach at
Colorado State. Both schools now have new coaches, and Collen is out
of work.</TE>
<TE>   Collen, a 1983 Miami graduate, asked the school last week to check
into his academic credentials. Miami told Vanderbilt last month that
Collen held only one master's degree in two subjects.</TE>
<TE>   But a further review found that the registrar's office made a
mistake on Collen's transcript when he graduated. The office
incorrectly entered that he earned one master's degree in two areas
of study, but the record should have shown two separate degrees,
Miami spokesman Richard Little said.</TE>
<TE>   Motor Racing</TE>
<TE>   Kenny Brack, who finished second last year in the Championship
Auto Racing Teams series, moved into a tie for 13th place by earning
a single point for being the fastest qualifier at the Shell 300 at
the Grand Prix of Monterey at Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca.</TE>
<TE>   Brack averaged 114.989 mph in a Toyota-powered Lola around the
2.2-mile road course, guaranteeing a spot on the front row for
Sunday's race.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sterling Marlin got his first pole of the season without turning a
wheel when qualifying for Sunday's Pocono 500 in Long Pond, Pa., was
canceled because of a wet track. The 43-car field was set on the
basis of Winston Cup points.... Greg Biffle won the pole for today's
inaugural Busch Series Inside Traxx 300 at Gladeville, Tenn., with a
qualifying speed of 161.288 mph in 29.753 seconds.... The appeal of
driver Paul Tracy's runner-up finish in the Indianapolis 500 will be

<HD>Frustrations Endanger Stadium Plan in L.A.</HD>
<DH>Pro football: Leiweke says downtown coalition close to
withdrawing from the process.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Recent threats of legal action, public rancor and stepped-up
competition from the Coliseum have so frustrated a group looking to
build an NFL stadium in downtown Los Angeles that it is "close" to
pulling out, said a key member of the coalition.</LD>
<LD>   Tim Leiweke, president of Anschutz Entertainment Group, said
Friday he plans to meet with his fellow coalition members in the
coming days and weigh whether to end the process.</LD>
<LD>   "I think it will take a couple of weeks to reach a consensus
within the group," Leiweke said.</LD>
<TE>   He added that Denver billionaire Philip Anschutz, who owns Staples
Center and is pivotal to the NFL deal, has become disenchanted,
particularly considering he had to be talked into spending millions
of dollars on a football stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "He's never wanted to be in a position where we were getting
leveraged," Leiweke said. "That was always his No. 1 concern.... I
always assured him that I wouldn't let that happen. If we got to a
point where suddenly this became a huge political battle, we'd bow
out."</TE>
<TE>   Although there were indications the stadium push is still inching
forward--AEG dropped off detailed renderings of the proposed stadium
at Mayor James K. Hahn's office Friday--another member of the
coalition, Casey Wasserman, said the likelihood of building a
privately financed, 64,000-seat stadium adjacent to Staples Center is
"less than it was three weeks ago."</TE>
<TE>   The latest setback was a decision earlier this week by the
Coliseum Commission, which allotted as much as $1 million to promote
their venue as an NFL site. Members of the downtown group see the
Coliseum as an unworkable alternative. They say that, instead of
enticing an NFL team to relocate, it simply clouds the picture in
L.A. "It's crazy that we can't speak with one voice in this
community," Leiweke said.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates of the Coliseum say the only voice that counts belongs
to whichever NFL owner wants to relocate and decides to choose the
Coliseum as his team's new home.</TE>
<TE>   "The one thing a team is concerned with is: What are the economics
for them?" said Pat Lynch, general manager of the Coliseum. "We want
to take this money and prepare credible financial proposals and
projections for teams to show them how great they would do in this
particular facility."</TE>
<TE>   Among the major obstacles facing the Coliseum is how to pay for a
$400-million renovation, particularly when no developers are lining
up to do so. Lynch said he trusts the financing plan created in 1999,
when the Coliseum was vying for the league's 32nd team, and said he
is confident developers would eventually emerge. The Coliseum has not
presented a proposal to the league.</TE>
<TE>   The apparent unraveling of the downtown proposal highlights how
difficult it is to get a major project completed in L.A., which has
been without an NFL team since the Raiders and Rams left after the
1994 season.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, AEG received a letter from the City of San
Diego hinting at legal action if the group tried to woo the Chargers
before they trigger their escape clause in their Qualcomm Stadium
lease. "We assure you that we have no intention of interfering with
the contractual obligations of the Chargers or any other NFL team,"
Leiweke wrote in his response to the city.</TE>
<TE>   In another snag, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors last
month voted to sue the city, arguing that a redevelopment plan that
would ease the way for a new stadium ultimately strips tax revenue
from the county. County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky said the suit has
nothing to do with the proposed construction of a new stadium,
however, and spoke with Leiweke on Friday to reiterate that.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, Leiweke said the rapid-fire developments have taken
their toll.</TE>
<TE>   "You have some business people who believe there's a better idea
for South Park and the land there," he said. "You have council people
writing op-eds and attacking us. You have lawsuits from the county,
and people accusing us of wanting a subsidy for billionaires. We
didn't want any of that. We were trying to do the right thing.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to whip up controversy. I don't want to use
political chips on this. And I don't want to develop enemies because
we're trying to do the right thing."</TE>

<HD>Red Wings Forced to Grind It Out</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LONNIE WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RALEIGH, N.C.</DL>
<LD>Detroit has discovered how tough it is to score against Carolina, so
the play of Coach Scotty Bowman's reunited "Grind Line" will be the
key for the Red Wings for the rest of the Stanley Cup finals.</LD>
<LD>   With the best-of-seven series tied at 1-1 heading into tonight's
Game 3 at Carolina's Entertainment &amp; Sports Arena, Kirk Maltby,
Darren McCarty and Kris Draper will be counted on to do the dirty
work for the Red Wings, thanks to the Hurricanes' smothering style.</LD>
<LD>   "There's not a lot of room out there and it's that they play such
a great trapping style," McCarty said. "You have got to have a lot of
patience. With our style of play, this really benefits us a little
bit more, where we can get in there and play the body and grind it
around. That's where we are at our best."</LD>
<TE>   Over the first two games, Detroit's big guns have been shooting
blanks. Captain Steve Yzerman and fellow wingers Brendan Shanahan,
Brett Hull, Luc Robitaille and Igor Larionov have not scored. The
Hurricanes have effectively shut down Yzerman &amp; Co. with their
ability to block shots and cut off passing lanes.</TE>
<TE>   That has not been the case for the Red Wing grinders. Maltby and
Draper have accounted for three of Detroit's five goals against
Carolina goaltender Arturs Irbe.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we feel confident with our game," said Draper, who scored
the clinching goal in Game 2. "We are a line that likes to get in
there and cycle the puck and take it to the net. We feel strong,
playing down low, getting loose pucks and creating chances for one
another.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe we feel that we can be a factor in this series."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Both teams still seem confused by the officiating. There have been
33 penalties in the two games and minor infractions that might not
have been called in the first three rounds of the playoffs are being
called now.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Carolina Coach Paul Maurice nor Bowman is complaining,
though.</TE>
<TE>   "It works the same for both teams, so there shouldn't be
advantages for one or the other," Maurice said.</TE>
<TE>   Bowman said it's not fair to condemn officials because they are
only doing their job.</TE>
<TE>   "They get criticized, whatever they do," he said. "There's always
been criticism that they are not going to call this, not going to
call that.</TE>
<TE>   "There's more focus now. Everybody is watching, especially the
hockey world and their supervisors. There's less chance to get away
[with penalties] now."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the penalties, there hasn't been a lot of scoring, since
neither team has been effective on the power play. Detroit is two for
15, Carolina one for 14.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In good shape and without any physical problems, Mario Lemieux
said he will return to the Pittsburgh Penguins next season.... John
MacLean of the Dallas Stars, a 19-year NHL player and two-time
All-Star, has retired.</TE>

<HD>Sweden's Larsson Doubles His Pleasure</HD>

<SE></SE>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KOBE, Japan</DL>
<LD>Henrik Larsson still has the touch.</LD>
<LD>   Eight years after his last World Cup goal, the striker netted two
Friday as Sweden beat Nigeria, 2-1, and sent the Super Eagles out of
the tournament in the first round.</LD>
<LD>   Larsson scored the game-winning goal in the 62nd minute after he
was fouled in the area by Ifeanyi Udeze.</LD>
<TE>   Bolivian referee Rene Ortube, who had told Sweden to play on
several times in the first half after the rough Nigerian defense put
a few Swedish players on their backsides in the area, whistled for a
penalty after Udeze brought down Larsson from behind.</TE>
<TE>   Larsson, who last scored a World Cup goal in the United States
eight years ago when Sweden beat Bulgaria, 4-0, in the third-place
match, drove his right-footed shot past Nigeria goalkeeper Ike
Shorunmu, who got a hand to the ball but couldn't clear it.</TE>
<TE>   In the first half, Larsson scored after taking a pass from Freddie
Ljungberg in the 35th minute.</TE>
<TE>   Larsson beat one defender into the box and poked his shot into the
right corner despite the closing presence of three Nigerian
defenders.</TE>

<LD>Tiger Woods launches his quest to achieve the second leg of golf's
Grand Slam at the U.S. Open paired in Thursday's first round and
Friday's second round with Chris DiMarco and Northern Ireland's
Darren Clarke.</LD>
<LD>   For the first time in its 102-year history, the Open will be
played from the first and 10th tees in an attempt to speed up play
and to avoid any delays from possible bad weather.</LD>
<LD>   The United States Golf Assn. released its pairings Friday for the
first two days of the Open, to be played at the Bethpage Black layout
in Farmingdale, N.Y., the first public facility to stage a U.S. Open.</LD>
<TE>   Woods has a 10:35 a.m. (PDT) start time Thursday on the 10th tee
and a 5:35 a.m. time Friday on the first tee.</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion Retief Goosen will play the first two rounds
with two of last year's other major winners--British Open champion
David Duval and PGA champion David Toms.</TE>
<TE>   Woods won the Masters in 2001 and again in April, his third
Masters victory and seventh major championship title. Of the last 10
majors, Woods has won six, dating to the 1999 PGA Championship.</TE>
<TE>   Sergio Garcia of Spain is paired for the first two days with Joe
Durant and Rocco Mediate; Phil Mickelson is in a group with K.J. Choi
and Lee Janzen; Ernie Els is with Stewart Cink and Len Mattiace;
Colin Montgomerie is with Craig Stadler and Mark O'Meara, and John
Daly is with Nick Faldo of England and Stuart Appleby of Australia.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Plaschke</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You forget how he limped.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly all season Shaquille O'Neal limped, hobbling to the car,
walking on the side of his foot to the airplane, wincing when nobody
was watching.</LD>
<LD>   You forget how he boiled.</LD>
<TE>   Weary of constant fouling, he took a swing at Chicago's Brad
Miller and was suspended three games and was ripped in this column
and hid from the media and never threw another jab all season.</TE>
<TE>   You forget how he was embarrassed.</TE>
<TE>   Midway through these playoffs, Phil Jackson confronted him for his
inactivity, then told newspaper reporters, humiliating O'Neal such
that he angrily waved Jackson away during an important timeout.</TE>
<TE>   You forget these things, watching the best center in the history
of basketball carry the Lakers through these NBA Finals, his latest a
40-point effort in the Lakers' 106-83 victory over the New Jersey
Nets in Game 2.</TE>
<TE>   You should not.</TE>
<TE>   The astonishing thing about his easy domination is that it comes
at the end of his most difficult season.</TE>
<TE>   The amazing thing about Superman is that he is human.</TE>
<TE>   Or didn't you hear the story he spun late Friday night when asked
for a reason he trampled the Nets again and gave the Lakers a
two-games-to-none lead?</TE>
<TE>   Realistically, this is his stage and the Nets simply can't stop
him.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, though, he turned it into a potty joke.</TE>
<TE>   "That game was dedicated to Rick Adelman," O'Neal said, referring
to Thursday's charge from the Sacramento King coach that O'Neal steps
over the line on his free-throw attempts.</TE>
<TE>   Then he explained exactly how he heard the quote, describing a
scenario that was as pleasant as the sweat that he had just dumped
over nearly a dozen prone Net defenders.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm at home, in the bathroom ... flipping through channels, and
he's complaining about how I'm stepping over the line," O'Neal said
of Adelman. "So the game's dedicated to him. I don't believe people
still question me after all the tough times and after all the hard
work I've been through."</TE>
<TE>   It is easy to forget that he was questioned throughout this
season, but he was, and not just by Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   I have criticized him for firing his free-throw coach. On Friday
he made 12 of 14 free throws, and has been terrific in every tough
spot at the line.</TE>
<TE>   His teammates have subtly criticized him for not getting back on
defense. But in two games in this series, he has five blocked shots
and 22 defensive rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone criticized him--and is still criticizing him--for his
weight and its effects on his arthritic right big toe. Yet he has
played 40 minutes in each of the two games, huffing and hacking and
hanging on for as long as the Lakers have needed him.</TE>
<TE>   "Can I go through one day without somebody saying something
negative about me?" O'Neal said. "So that's for those who question
me. I was upset today."</TE>
<TE>   Whether he really used a throwaway quote from the coach of an
eliminated team as motivation--O'Neal is a marketing whiz,
remember--he certainly did play angry.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the game was six minutes old, he had converted a
left-handed bank, a right-handed bank, a jump hook and his first of
nearly two handfuls of dunks.</TE>
<TE>   He soon controlled the game such that public address announcer
Lawrence Tanter began pronouncing his name in several different ways,
more wildly pitched with each ensuing basket.</TE>
<TE>   "The man was hot, I wanted to give him his props," said Tanter.</TE>
<TE>   Were you watching? What was your favorite?</TE>
<TE>   The time he dunked off an inbounds lob from Rick Fox?</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe when he took a pass from Brian Shaw, threw it back to
Shaw, then spun around for an alley-oop dunk?</TE>
<TE>   Byron Scott, the Nets' coach, was watching.</TE>
<TE>   "I just don't know what to do against Shaq right now," Scott said.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps best of all was O'Neal's second exchange with Shaw--this
time with O'Neal throwing a no-look spinning bounce pass that led to
a layup.</TE>
<TE>   "He's seemed to gather energy during the playoffs," Jackson said.
"You know, that's the remarkable part of it."</TE>
<TE>   So remarkable, in fact, that the Lakers eventually began standing
around and watching him, the best seats in the house. And so when
O'Neal left the game late in the third quarter with the Lakers
leading by 20?</TE>
<TE>   The Nets went on a 15-2 run before O'Neal was rushed back into the
game.</TE>
<TE>   At which point he sent a desperately flopping Jason Collins
skidding across the floor, then turned and easily threw down another
dunk.</TE>
<TE>   Said Jackson: "This was his show."</TE>
<TE>   Said Scott: "He's a monster."</TE>
<TE>   A claim made all the more impressive because O'Neal is clearly
also just a man.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, that was his mother sitting courtside Friday, Lucille
Harrison shouting and pointing as her son walked off the floor to a
standing ovation.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, that was a quiet look for approval that O'Neal gave her as he
walked, looking only at her amid the 19,000 screaming and chanting
fans, like, did I do good?</TE>
<TE>   She didn't need to say anything. Nobody needed to say anything.</TE>
<TE>   For the biggest man at the end of his longest season, summer is
coming and silence awaits.</TE>

<HD>Stern Doesn't Want to Hear It</HD>
<DH>NBA: Commissioner says he might crack down on complaints
about officiating. Adelman won't give Lakers credit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NBA Commissioner David Stern suggested Friday that coaches' moaning
and groaning about officiating has grown tiresome, making his
comments a day after further complaints by Sacramento King Coach Rick
Adelman about his team's loss to the Lakers in the Western Conference
finals.</LD>
<LD>   "We accomplished a lot of things we wanted to accomplish, but it's
real difficult to let that last series go," Adelman said Thursday in
Sacramento. "I'm still not real happy. I'm trying to figure out why
we didn't play [Wednesday], basically."</LD>
<LD>   Adelman alluded to Game 1 of the NBA Finals between the Lakers and
New Jersey Nets at Staples Center.</LD>
<TE>   Ralph Nader, a consumer advocate, had weighed in on the subject
Wednesday, apparently in support of the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   Stern said of coaches' complaints, "We haven't come down hard on
them, but it's become so commonplace we would laugh. Perhaps we
shouldn't be so easy on them because fans are more open to
suggestions of problems. We're going to encourage coaches to be more
muted in their suggestions [of impropriety]."</TE>
<TE>   Coaches who criticize the officiating of regular-season games
often are fined $7,500 or more. But complaining about the work of
referees during the playoffs goes unpunished.</TE>
<TE>   Laker Coach Phil Jackson was displeased by the work of the
officials in Game 5 of the conference finals, when Shaquille O'Neal
fouled out late in the final quarter of the Kings' one-point victory.</TE>
<TE>   Adelman then complained when the Lakers shot 27 free throws during
the fourth quarter of Game 6. O'Neal shot 10 free throws in the final
quarter of the Lakers' four-point victory, which set up the deciding
Game 7 Sunday in Sacramento. The Lakers won Game 7, 112-106 in
overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Adelman expressed his frustration after Sunday's game and again
Thursday, in separate interviews with the Sacramento Bee and on "The
Last Word," a cable sports-talk show.</TE>
<TE>   "People can say what they want, that we should be happy," he told
the Bee. "We missed free throws in the last game and, yes, that hurt
us. You can say all of that, and fall in line that the Lakers are a
better team and they showed their championship mettle and it's
baloney.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't buy into it, and if you want me to say that they are a
better team, I'm not going to say it. But they beat us and you give
them credit, but I don't think they are the better team. If someone
wants to say they proved it, well, maybe to those people, but not to
me."</TE>
<TE>   Adelman stopped short of saying the Lakers earned preferential
treatment from the officiating crews in Games 6 and 7.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never been one to say because [the Lakers] won two
championships, then they deserve something more in the third time
they are going for it," Adelman said. "They are supposed to win the
third championship like they won the other two. It's like you've got
to beat them. I don't know what that means, with a board or a gun,
what do you [have to] do?"</TE>
<TE>   Adelman acknowledged that he was speaking out in the hope that the
league would improve its officiating. He did not send videotapes to
the league office to illustrate his complaints.</TE>

<LD>My wife always finds it funny the way I get lost, living in a little
town while growing up and still not knowing how to go from one end of
the city to the other.</LD>
<LD>   Wait until she hears this one--she'll just crack up. They have us
parking in a different lot at Staples Center for the playoffs, so I
came out the wrong gate, got all twisted around, took a shortcut
through the Convention Center and found myself in the middle of
Erotica L.A.</LD>
<LD>   I didn't panic. The folks in the porno industry are known for
being obliging, so I went to the first porn star I could find and
told Julie Meadows I was looking for the Lakers.</LD>
<TE>   "So am I," she said, and then she removed her dress.</TE>
<TE>   I'm a professional, and I'm used to people taking off their
clothes when I talk to them, and I've also been married for 29 years,
so I've trained myself to not look.</TE>
<TE>   I figured as long as I was here and the porn industry is like the
No. 1 business in the Valley, I'd ask her what she thought about
secession.</TE>
<TE>   "Sex session?" she said. "Fine by me."</TE>
<TE>   I tried to explain the misunderstanding, but finally gave up and
asked, "By any chance, do you know Bill Dwyre?"</TE>
<TE>   "Oh yes," she said, but obviously she was putting me on.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   AS BORING as the playoff opener between the Lakers and Nets had
been, I wondered what would hold more excitement: The second game of
the playoffs in Staples or Erotica L.A. in the Convention Hall? So I
went to work to find out.</TE>
<TE>   NBA Commissioner David Stern was scheduled to give a 3:30 p.m.
news conference in Staples to announce L.A. will host the 2004
All-Star game, but it didn't start until 3:44. The doors to Erotica
L.A., the sixth annual porn convention here, swung open at 4. That
explains why I was breathing hard when I arrived at Erotica L.A.</TE>
<TE>   "Have you seen Rick Majerus?" I asked. "You know, the basketball
coach?"</TE>
<TE>   Tawny Roberts, whom you might have seen in "The Sleaze Show,"
pointed to her husband, 6-foot-9 Rick, who had played for San Jose
State, as if he might know.</TE>
<TE>   If I wanted to talk to tall people I would have stayed at Staples.
"By any chance could you explain the Princeton offense to me?" I
asked. "Majerus tried in his column, but he couldn't do it."</TE>
<TE>   Tawny nodded, and for the next two or three minutes she showed me
some things, and I had no idea that's what they call "the Princeton
offense."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   BACK AT Staples, reporters were working on their stories, and
moaning about the lack of quality play. And we were two minutes into
the first quarter. The Lakers went up by 10, and Michelle Pfeiffer
had her baseball cap pulled down tight over her face, and nothing
bothers a reporter more than a cover-up.</TE>
<TE>   When the Lakers went up by 11 in the second quarter I noticed the
seat next to Ellen DeGeneres was empty. I wondered if the exodus to
Erotica L.A. had already begun. I decided to beat the rush.</TE>
<TE>   A very nice woman, and I do have to say they have very friendly
women in the porn industry, introduced herself as Christi Lake and
said she takes applications from fans, and then, well, spends time
with them. She asked if I was a fan.</TE>
<TE>   I told her in my line of work there is no cheering allowed in the
press box, and she seemed to understand. She gave me a gift for my
wife, and said it requires only four triple-A batteries. I told her
we're always running out of triple-A batteries with three TV remote
controls in the house, so I didn't want to cause any more
frustration.</TE>
<TE>   I turned down a gift bag from the NBA when I picked up my media
credentials; in hindsight, I hope it didn't include a supply of
triple-A batteries.</TE>
<TE>   "You're so lucky to be able to go to Laker games," said Dallas, a
representative for "The Resort at Sheri's Ranch, the world famous
brothel," and I see no reason to press my luck by adding any further
comment here.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ORGANIZERS TOLD me this event attracted 25,000 people last year. I
called LAPD to see if there was a risk of being arrested. "Not unless
you do something wacky," the public information officer said. "If you
see a public nuisance like someone getting naked, feel free to call
me." That's funny, two Times reporters told me the same thing.</TE>
<TE>   The porno folks asked me to sign a paper agreeing not to grope
anyone or ask them to get naked. It was like I was dating again. I
found it odd I was the only one being asked to sign a paper, but then
I found the whole experience educational.</TE>
<TE>   For example, I learned the value of eye contact. I was talking to
one woman, telling her how dull Stern had been and how he could use a
little spice in his life when I'm embarrassed to say I noticed for
the first time I was talking to a full-size doll. To be honest, it
wasn't much different than talking to USC Athletic Director Mike
Garrett.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE NETS came within four points in the opening moments of the
third quarter, and I'm glad I was back in Staples to witness it. I'm
not sure--beyond the opening tip--the Nets will ever be that close
again.</TE>
<TE>   I'm going back East now for the next two games, and from what I
understand there's no Erotica N.J. scheduled to provide some kind of
excitement.</TE>
<TE>   I wonder if the wife would like to join me; it's hard to know,
since she's not speaking to me these days.</TE>
<TE>   "Talk to Mimi," as I recall, was the last thing she said.</TE>

<HD>Spain's Win Speaks Volumes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Grahame L. Jones</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Outspoken goalkeeper Jose Luis Chilavert of Paraguay had boasted all
week about how he was not only going to shut out the Spanish but also
score two goals against them, one on a penalty kick and the other on
a free kick.</LD>
<LD>   Idle boasts.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, Real Madrid forward Fernando Morientes stole the show in
front of 24,000 in Jeonju, South Korea, Friday, scoring two
second-half goals to power Spain past Paraguay, 3-1, and into the
second round.</LD>
<TE>   Spain is the first team to qualify for the final 16, and will play
Cameroon, Germany or Ireland for a place in the quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   The victory was not as clear-cut as the score might suggest,
however. In fact, the Spanish trailed until the second half, when
Morientes was sent into the game by Coach Jose Antonio Camacho and
quickly put things right with goals in the 53rd and 69th minutes,
canceling Carles Puyol's 10th-minute own goal.</TE>
<TE>   Fernando Hierro put the game out of Paraguay's reach with a
penalty kick seven minutes from the end after Raul had been fouled.</TE>
<TE>   "I got out there and I struck lucky," said Morientes. "Things
worked out well. The first goal was a straightforward header, but I
don't know much about the second. It hit everything, my chest, my
ankle."</TE>
<TE>   Morientes could not resist a dig at Paraguay's goalkeeper, saying,
"Chilavert played a part because he came out late on both the goals."</TE>

Angeles; the Sparks have won all five games played there. The Lynx,
whose last game was a 78-68 overtime loss to Seattle on Tuesday, are
led by Katie Smith (18.3 points), last year's top WNBA scorer who is
second in the league in three-point shooting percentage (.667). Spark
Coach Michael Cooper hopes reserve guard Sophia Witherspoon keeps

<LD>As smooth and polished as a politician, he has movie-star looks.</LD>
<LD>   On another team, in another place, Laker forward Rick Fox might be
the center of attention, the hawker of hamburgers, seller of soda.</LD>
<LD>   As a teammate of Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, he's a bit
player.</LD>
<TE>   How does he do it? How does he subjugate his ego?</TE>
<TE>   "With an understanding that I wouldn't be here without them," Fox
said. "An understanding that I wouldn't have two [championship
rings], working on a third, without those two. An understanding that
their games are much better than the rest of ours.</TE>
<TE>   "You take the time to appreciate the opportunity to play with them
and to realize your role. That's the difference in our success, I
think. The supporting cast is not caught up in [believing] that we
should share in the success or we should share in any glamour or
endorsements or commercials. That's not really for us. We have a
smaller role on this team, to keep this thing tied together, and we
do it.</TE>
<TE>   "Day in and day out, I'm gracious to know it's because of Shaq and
Kobe that I can continue this situation. That's something a lot of
people don't know how to do--be humble and just keep your mouth shut
and play."</TE>

<TE>   Just As Long as He Wears No. 8 on the Court</TE>
<TE>   Bryant continues to make fashion statements with his choice of
off-court attire.</TE>
<TE>   Friday, he arrived at Staples Center wearing a Jackie Robinson
jersey. He also has appeared wearing the jerseys of Pedro Martinez,
Joe Namath, Hank Aaron, Joe Montana and Jerry West.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant said his selection of the Montana jersey for Game 7 of the
Western Conference finals against Sacramento was out of respect for
the quarterback's penchant for engineering come-from-behind
victories.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, he claims there is no pattern to his selections.</TE>
<TE>   "You mean is there a method to my madness?" Bryant told NBA.com
Thursday. "No, not really."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   $450 Seems Like a Lot to Pay for a Nosebleed</TE>
<TE>   Tickets for the playoffs this week were selling through brokers
for as much as $10,000 a seat.</TE>
<TE>   That was way too much for Raymond Murillo, 19, who instead saved
two weeks' salary--and got a little help from his brother Joey--to be
able to sit in the farthest reaches of Staples Center. His back was
to the wall, but he didn't mind paying $450 to see the Lakers on
Friday with his girlfriend, Nellie Roth.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't care," said Murillo, 19, a student at Mt. San Antonio
College in Walnut. "I just wanted to be in the building."</TE>
<TE>   A few seats away, several naval personnel, including Arthur Torrez
from the USS Belleau Wood, paid $90 for seats with an obstructed view
of the court.</TE>
<TE>   Torrez will be deployed to active duty in a few months and said
being at the game will be a nice memory to take with him.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't really see the game, but we can feel the excitement," he
said.</TE>

<TE>   No Comment Yet From Michael Jordan</TE>
<TE>   Ahmad Rashad's last appearance on NBC will be Sunday. He
interviewed O'Neal and Bryant after practice Thursday for a feature
that will run on the 5 p.m. pregame show before Game 3.</TE>
<TE>   "After 20 years [with NBC], that will be that," Rashad said Friday
night.</TE>
<TE>   Rashad also works for NBA Entertainment as the executive producer
and host of "NBA Inside Stuff." He is committed to that show, which
is headed for ABC under the new contract for next season.</TE>
<TE>   Rashad and NBC did not have a real amicable parting.</TE>
<TE>   With Bob Costas being brought in to serve as the host of the
pregame show during the Finals, Hannah Storm and Rashad, who had been
co-hosting the show, were asked to co-host the postgame show carried
by CNBC.</TE>
<TE>   While Storm accepted, Rashad declined that assignment.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's just say they didn't offer me anything on the network,"
Rashad said.</TE>

<HD>Talking Is Getting the Nets Nowhere</HD>
<DH>New Jersey: Kidd isn't as impressive as Game 1, and defense
doesn't seem to have a clue how to handle O'Neal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The New Jersey Nets promised they would be significantly better to
start Game 2 of the NBA Finals on Friday at Staples Center. They
weren't. The Nets vowed to play with confidence and poise and show
the Lakers they are worthy and dangerous opponents. They didn't and,
so far, they aren't.</LD>
<LD>   Now what?</LD>
<LD>   The Nets couldn't win in Game 1, when point guard Jason Kidd was
superb, scoring 23 points, taking 10 rebounds and adding 10 assists.
They certainly couldn't win with him playing as poorly as he did
during Game 2.</LD>
<TE>   What's more, New Jersey couldn't win Game 1 when they tried to
stop Laker center Shaquille O'Neal without double-teaming him, and he
responded with 36 points and 12 rebounds. The Nets failed to win Game
2 when they attempted the same strategy, and O'Neal ended up with 40
points, 12 rebounds and eight assists.</TE>
<TE>   What now?</TE>
<TE>   Game 3 of the best-of-seven series is Sunday in East Rutherford,
N.J. The Nets have until then to sort out their numerous
shortcomings.</TE>
<TE>   Late Friday, the Nets continued to talk a better game than they
have played in their first Finals.</TE>
<TE>   They said all the things you would expect from a team that finds
itself down by two games to none.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to stay aggressive, we have to stay positive, we have to
stay together," Kidd said after the Nets' 106-83 loss to the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a lot of fight left," guard Kerry Kittles said after
leading the Nets with 23 points on nine-of-19 shooting.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be tough, but that's our situation right now," said
reserve guard Lucious Harris, who missed all nine of his shots.</TE>
<TE>   And there also was this from center Todd MacCulloch, who has been
helpless while trying to guard O'Neal: "It would probably be more
disheartening if we had played perfect games or near perfect games,
but we haven't."</TE>
<TE>   Apart from shooting bricks to begin Games 1 and 2, the Nets'
biggest failing has been to at least slow O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal's dominance became comical when, at one point in the third
quarter, he faked New Jersey forward Aaron Williams into the air.
Williams came to rest on O'Neal's back, looking like a child hopping
on his father's back for a piggyback ride.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the fact remains that Williams stands 6 feet 9 and
weighs 225 pounds, appearing small only when compared with the 7-1,
335-pound O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   Less humorous was a third-period knee-to-knee collision between
Kidd and Laker forward Rick Fox, which resulted in Kidd's third foul
and a noticeable limp.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not broke, so I'll be ready to play on Sunday," Kidd said.
"It's do or die. It's been do or die for a while now. Gotta play
through it."</TE>
<TE>   Kidd's game improved despite the collision. Early on, Kidd and the
Nets were brutal--shooting 24% and trailing, 27-21, in the first
quarter Friday after making 27.3% and trailing, 29-14, in the opening
quarter Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Kidd hardly looked to shoot in the first half and when he did, he
missed. Scoreless after missing five attempts in the first half, Kidd
forced the issue to start the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   He would score 17 points, take nine rebounds and add seven assists
by game's end. But his six-for-17 shooting stood out in the final box
score.</TE>
<TE>   "The game is about making shots," Kidd said. "We had plenty of
them. We didn't do it. They held serve.... We have to keep our heads
high and be positive. There's a big game Sunday. If we win that one,
maybe we'll give them a little bit of a scare.</TE>
<TE>   "With the Lakers, they probably feel they haven't played their
best game. That could be scary, but we haven't played our best game
yet either."</TE>
<TE>   At this point, that's a small consolation for the Nets, whose best
doesn't figure to equal the Lakers' best.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey needs a flawless Kidd at the point and inspired play
from his supporting cast if it hopes to inject something approaching
intrigue into what has been a one-sided Finals.</TE>
<TE>   "Please, let's get out of here right now," Harris said.</TE>
<TE>   "Please, let's go back home and when Game 3 comes, we'll still
have a chance."</TE>

<HD>Security for South Korea Game Is a Concern</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>The pressure on South Korea to advance to the second round of the
World Cup is so intense that it has raised concerns here that
Monday's game against the United States in Daegu might provoke crowd
trouble, should the home team lose.</LD>
<LD>   Indicative of the concern was the decision by Kim Dae-Jung, South
Korea's president, not to attend the match, although he was present
for South Korea's 2-0 victory over Poland in Busan earlier in the
week.</LD>
<LD>   "It is a precautionary measure to have President Kim stay away
from the stadium, considering the emotional nature of the match," a
presidential spokesman told the Korea Times on Friday.</LD>
<TE>   "Imagine that cases of violent protest take place at the stadium
with President Kim inside. This is something that we must guard
against."</TE>
<TE>   With the U.S. having defeated Portugal, 3-2, the Koreans and
Americans hold the top two places in Group D, and the winner of
Monday's match will almost certainly advance to the final 16. A tie
would benefit the U.S. more than South Korea, which has to close
against Portugal while the U.S. has a potentially easier finale
against Poland.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Embassy in Seoul has expressed "confidence that the
Korean authorities will take necessary steps to prevent possible
mishaps" at the game, but nonetheless has decided to close at noon
Monday, ostensibly to allow its staff to watch the 3:30 p.m. game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The American team is trying to maintain an even keel, despite the
euphoria of its surprise victory over favored Portugal.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't be too high coming off that," defender Jeff Agoos said.
"Even if we had lost, you can't be too low coming off the game.
You've got to be a little bit more even. You've got to put that game
behind you.</TE>
<TE>   "We celebrated last night and now we move on to [play] South
Korea. The games are coming pretty fast for us, so we've got to have
the mind-set that South Korea is the most important game for us."</TE>

<LD>As the NBA Finals begin to shift to New Jersey, the biggest fear
Friday night was that the biggest basketball series of the year
wouldn't even rate as the second-biggest sporting event in the New
York area next week. All the suspicions about the superiority of the
Lakers, along with the inexperience of the Nets, made an early
appearance in the series. The groundwork for a swift and boring
conclusion was laid.</LD>
<LD>   The possibility of New York tuning out basketball became real.</LD>
<LD>   After all, given the option of going to bed early or watching Game
1, New York collectively fluffed its pillow on Wednesday. This wasn't
the kind of reaction David Stern and NBC wanted to see. Several
markets grabbed better TV ratings than New York. Even New Orleans was
bigger on the Finals.</LD>
<TE>   With War Emblem snorting in the starting gate at Belmont, the
Yankees and Mets warming up in the bullpen and Tiger Woods teeing off
at Bethpage [in Farmingdale, N.Y], Lakers-Nets might be relegated to
hockey status in the nation's largest market.</TE>
<TE>   Quite simply, there will be no buzz about basketball unless the
Nets create one.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets entered Game 2 attempting to destroy one possibility.
There hasn't been a sweep in the Finals since 1995, when Shaquille
O'Neal and the Orlando Magic were routed by Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Now, winning the series is almost out of the question for the
Nets.</TE>
<TE>   Prolonging the series is the issue. And if they can't make that
happen, then they'll disappear quickly, just like the audience.</TE>

<LD>It's not like the New Jersey Nets don't know problems. They featured
Derrick Coleman and sold Julius Erving. Rollie Massimino once quit as
coach before his introductory announcement news conference, and Larry
Brown left in midseason. The Nets are identified with a swamp and a
turnpike exit.</LD>
<LD>   And perhaps soon NBA Finals ignominy.</LD>
<LD>   That's because the Nets went where few ever have gone Friday
night, down two games to none to the Lakers.</LD>
<TE>   No team ever falling behind 0-2 since this format began in 1984
has recovered to win the championship, and the last to come back from
0-2 was Bill Walton's 1977 Portland Trail Blazers. More likely, the
Nets are looking at being the first team to be swept in the Finals
since Shaquille O'Neal's Orlando Magic in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   After the Lakers won the first game of the Finals, 99-94, on
Wednesday, Coach Phil Jackson expressed some concern.</TE>
<TE>   The victory was similar to the first one against Sacramento in the
Western Conference finals, after which his team had been fortunate to
win one of the next three games.</TE>
<TE>   So before Friday night's victory in Game 2, Jackson told his
players they had given back the Nets their confidence and this game's
mission was to take it away again.</TE>
<TE>   No problem.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers audience-this was no crowd-remained unusually quiet
most of the game, Apparently many were stunned that it actually was
the Nets in the Finals. But they broke into "MVP" chants for O'Neal
as the Lakers pulled away with a 12-0 run late in the third quarter,
O'Neal knocking over Nets like they were duck pins while Bryant and
Brian Shaw sandwiched in threes for a 77-61 Lakers lead after three
quarters.</TE>
<TE>   "Every game on, I have to make myself known," O'Neal said, "make
my presence known."</TE>

<HD>Nets Must First Speak to Mr. Scott</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE VACCARO</AU>
<BD>Newark Star-Ledger</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Byron Scott gets to try on the rest of the coaching uniform now, in
what may be his team's last legitimate hour as a viable contender.
The Nets don't need his cool reassurances anymore. They don't need to
draw confidence from him, or follow his self-assured footsteps past
the skeptics and the doubters.</LD>
<LD>   The Nets are in dire need of a coach right now.</LD>
<LD>   They need an X and O man, a strategist, someone who can make a
difference with his chalkboard. As often as Scott has served as a
psychological cornerman for the Nets this season, tending to their
hidden wounds, rubbing salve on their bruised egos, this is not what
the Nets scream for any longer.</LD>
<TE>   The Nets don't need coaxing. They need coaching.</TE>
<TE>   This isn't a mental crisis, it's a physical one, one that can only
be remedied on a blackboard. And that is Scott's final frontier as a
coach. He has to come up with something. He has to dip into a basket
of tricks, retrieve a plan to allow the Nets to throw an uppercut
Sunday night and jump back into the series.</TE>
<TE>   And he needs to do it quickly, because he has already allowed too
large a chunk of this series to vanish without summoning such a
counter-attack.</TE>
<TE>   Coaching. Not coaxing.</TE>
<TE>   He has gotten a splendid handle on the other aspects of the gig so
far. Now we'll see how the whole outfit looks on him, head to toe. It
better be a snug fit.</TE>

<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>What I remember most about Ukari Figgs is how calm she was last year,
no matter what the situation. Not Prozac calm, but tranquil. And it
seemed a terrific trait for the point guard of the Sparks to have.
They were being pushed to the title by Coach Michael Cooper, who knew
how great his team could be and was not going to let it fall short of
its goal.</LD>
<LD>   Cooper can be relentless, and I imagine being his point guard can
occasionally be thankless. But whatever the pressure, from opponents
or the coaching staff, Figgs handled it. She was not the most gifted
player on offense, nor was she the quickest or strongest. But
whenever the Sparks needed a big basket or a steadying hand, she
provided it.</LD>
<LD>   As a reward, she was traded to Portland for a talented but
unproven rookie just out of college. Figgs is now asked to apply her
gifts to a young, skittish team that, after Monday's defeat by the
Sparks in Los Angeles, has lost as many games, four, as she lost last
season with the Sparks.</LD>
<TE>   And yet when Figgs returned to Staples Center for the first time
as an opponent, there was no sense of anger or betrayal. Just her
trademark sense of calm.</TE>
<TE>   "The past is the past," she said. "When something happens, there
is nothing you can do to change it. But I don't need to look back and
change the past. I think I have a new opportunity to do something
different with a different team. Hopefully, I'll be able to do that."</TE>
<TE>   The warm ovation and strong hugs she got from her former teammates
reminded Figgs that she will always have a place in L.A.'s legacy.
She knows the Fire is not ready to challenge her former team, at
least not until Jackie Stiles returns to the lineup. Stiles has been
sitting out with a case of bursitis. Figgs also knows that everyone
in Portland is expecting her to be some kind of savior, although
that's not her game.</TE>
<TE>   She will take each challenge as it comes. At some point the Fire
will be ready to receive the kind of help she can provide.</TE>
<TE>   "Trying to fit in with a new team and system has been challenging
because I had been running [the Sparks'] system the last three years.
And as the point guard you have to know where everybody goes," Figgs
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year [the Sparks] did some things different from other teams
in the league, and that's one of the reasons I think [they] were
successful. There are differences in what I have to do here but,
hopefully, after a month and a half I've picked up on them."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Word is that Detroit Coach Greg Williams has a 6-foot-11 shadow
looming over him. That would be Bill Laimbeer, former Detroit Piston
bad boy who reportedly is talking about wanting to coach the Shock,
off to an 0-5 start.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If Laimbeer were to get a WNBA job, be it in Detroit or elsewhere,
he would join Cooper and Orlando's Dee Brown as former NBA players
coaching in the women's league.</TE>
<TE>   Cynthia Cooper, at the helm in Phoenix, is the only former WNBA
player, so far, coaching in the league. Can there be other
first-generation WNBA players like her with the same ambition?</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte's Dawn Staley thinks it's too soon to tell. There are
still too many first-generation WNBA players who don't have playing
out of their systems, she says, even though there are only 26 of the
original 110 players who started with the WNBA in 1997 still in the
league.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that if players know [coaching] is available to them,
they might try it," said Staley, who coaches Temple University's
women's team during the winter. "I think Cynthia did a tremendous
job, going from being one of the best in the WNBA into coaching. But
the transition is really hard. I'll bet she's struggling with things
that she could do and things she could see, and wondering why can't
her players do it.</TE>
<TE>   "It takes a great amount of patience. You have to move people to
that point. And it doesn't happen overnight. You have to be aware of
their progression, and a keen sense of observing things."</TE>
<TE>   Don't look for Staley to seek a WNBA coaching job when she
retires. She is happy at the collegiate level.</TE>
<TE>   "I like college," she said. "I like helping young people fulfill
their dreams, on and off the court."</TE>

<LD>The Canadian province of Quebec, once staunchly conservative and
strongly influenced by the Roman Catholic Church, gave legal status
to civil unions of same-sex couples, as well as permission for gay
couples to adopt children, Atty. Gen. Paul Begin said.</LD>
<LD>   Quebec is the second province to legalize civil unions of same-sex
couples. Nova Scotia was the first. Quebec, however, said the unions
won't be called marriages.</LD>
<LD>   A bill passed by lawmakers gives same-sex couples the same rights
and obligations as married heterosexual couples, including adoption
and artificial insemination.</LD>

<HD>Slain Missionary Is Mourned</HD>
<DH>Reaction: Relatives, friends pray for victim's wife,
injured in the raid in which he was killed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHEN BRAUN and ERIC SLATER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>ROSE HILL, Kan.</DL>
<LD>For more than a year after Martin and Gracia Burnham's abduction by
Philippine rebels, the couple's family and fellow missionaries
awaited their freedom with fraying hope. On Friday, they mourned for
Martin, prayed for Gracia and wondered why her freedom had come at a
violent cost.</LD>
<LD>   The slain man's grieving relatives came together in this tiny town
20 miles outside Wichita--pleading for strength from on high--while
officials of the Burnhams' worldwide missionary order tried to find
out how months of negotiations had collapsed in the chaotic firefight
that killed Martin and Philippine nurse Deborah Yap and wounded
Gracia.</LD>
<LD>   "Things seemed to be really flat, nothing going on, and then
this," said a shaken Dave Zelenak, resource director for the New
Tribes Mission in Sanford, Fla. "We're all a little numb."</LD>
<TE>   Neither the Burnham family nor New Tribes officials had had any
warning, Zelenak said, that U.S.-trained Philippine troops were
planning a quick strike to free the hostages. Mission officials had
maintained close contact with U.S. and Philippine officials in recent
months, Zelenak said, but only learned of the gun battle hours after
the raid.</TE>
<TE>   Paul and Oreta Burnham, the slain missionary's parents, were
notified just after 3 a.m. in a phone call from Albert del Rosario,
the Philippine ambassador to the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   A short time later, the phone rang again. It was Gracia Burnham,
calling from her hospital bed in the Philippines. She had minor leg
injuries but was all right, she said. She couldn't wait to see her
three children. The only thing to do now, she told her father-in-law,
was pray.</TE>
<TE>   In a routine they have followed most every morning for a bleak
year, Paul and Oreta Burnham did just that, joining parishioners of
the Rose Hill Bible Church for a 6 a.m. prayer circle. On Friday,
instead of supplications for safety, the parents prayed for Martin's
soul and Gracia's return to good health.</TE>
<TE>   "We are disappointed, we are saddened," Pastor Robert Varner said.
"It wasn't what we hoped for. But the fact is, there has been some
closure to this."</TE>
<TE>   Then Paul Burnham began the sad wait for his son's final trip
home.</TE>
<TE>   When he took Del Rosario's call Friday morning, "we thought maybe
it could be good news," Burnham said. "We had hoped it would be a
nice reunion, but we know that we'll have to wait for that reunion
until we get to heaven."</TE>
<TE>   He urged the Philippine government to continue military action to
"take care of this Abu Sayyaf group." In the last two years, the
Islamic terrorist organization has abducted 40 other foreigners and
Filipinos, ransoming off many and beheading others.</TE>
<TE>   Zelenak said that Martin Burnham, 42, a graduate of Calvary Bible
College and the Wichita Aviation Education Center, was working in the
Philippines as a missionary pilot. One of 150 New Tribes evangelists
in that country, Burnham spent 17 years shuttling supplies and people
to far-flung islands, Zelenak said. The Burnhams had lived full time
in the country since 1986.</TE>
<TE>   Like her husband, 43-year-old Gracia is a child of missionaries.
Her sister, Mary Jones, told reporters Friday in Ohio that "it's a
miracle that anyone survived a military rescue attempt. And it's a
miracle that they survived for a year in barbaric captivity." Jones
said she was planning to fly to Manila to join her sister.</TE>
<TE>   Zelenak remembered Martin Burnham as "a good man" who recognized
"that living in a remote, Third World country can be pretty
dangerous." Martin and Gracia took precautions when they flew to
Philippine islands where radical Islamic guerrillas have clashed with
government troops since the 1970s, Zelenak said. But the couple
apparently considered themselves in protected territory when they
went to a resort on the Philippine island of Palawan in May last
year. They were abducted, along with another American and 17
Filipinos, in a lightning raid by the Abu Sayyaf rebels. Californian
Guillermo Sobero later was found beheaded.</TE>
<TE>   "They were celebrating their 18th wedding anniversary in a place
they were led to believe was safe," Zelenak said. "It wasn't
considered a risky area, so when we heard what happened, we were all
terribly shocked."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the couple's children--Zach, 15, Mindy, 12, and Jeff,
11--were being driven back to Rose Hill by their maternal
grandparents after a visit to Arkansas, as U.S. officials worked to
organize a reunion with their mother in the Philippines. The
children, who were born and raised in the Philippines, have lived
with Paul and Oreta Burnham since the kidnapping.</TE>
<TE>   As word spread in this town of 3,200, those with flags lowered
them to half-staff and neighbors made their way to the Burnham home,
filling it with flowers and erecting a makeshift memorial in the
yard. Even after dark, mourners stopped to add more flowers, say a
prayer, cry.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know them. I live in Wichita," said Brenda Wilson, 36, as
she stood staring at the memorial. "I just wanted to come by. You
don't have to know them to be sad."</TE>
<TE>   Inside, the family fielded a stream of condolence calls. One came
from Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.</TE>
<TE>   Another was from President Bush, who said that he had not expected
the effort to free the hostages to end in a firefight. Paul Burnham
said he told Bush that he understood and that he backed America's war
on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a terrorist group that has been hurting the Philippine
people for a long time," Burnham said. "We hope they will be able to
eradicate this terror-for-ransom gang."</TE>
<TE>   New Tribes officials said they had felt "growing impatience" in
recent months over the failure of both Philippine government and
private attempts to win the Burnhams' freedom through negotiations.
"We kept wondering, why isn't anything happening?" Zelenak said.
"Twelve months is a long time."</TE>
<TE>   Zelenak also said that colleagues back home had feared the
potential violence of a raid on the guerrillas. "There's always
concern where there are hostage-takers and military action that the
danger factor goes way up," he said. "We were hoping for something
peaceful, but it didn't work out that way."</TE>
<TE>   For more than a year, as teams of missionaries went to the
Philippines to seek the Burnhams' release, the group urged its
members to pray for the couple's safety. Faith, the group said, could
aid the Burnhams' speedy, peaceful return.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the organization's Web site asked again for help:
"Gracia and the families of Martin and Gracia need your prayers."</TE>

<HD>British Art Forger to Get Show of Fakes Under Own Name</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>A convicted forger who conned the world's greatest art experts for
years is to have his own exhibition--of fakes--a British gallery
owner said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Alan Elkin approached John Myatt upon Myatt's release from prison
in 1999 and arranged a show at his gallery in Warwick in central
England. The exhibition is due to open in September but has already
sold several pieces for between $370 and $3,700, Elkin said.</LD>
<LD>   Myatt achieved notoriety when it emerged at his trial that he had
gotten away with forging "lost" works by 20th century masters for the
best part of a decade.</LD>
<TE>   His accomplice John Drewe sold more than 200 of Myatt's paintings
for hundreds of thousands of dollars a time to galleries and private
collections throughout the world, some through top auction houses.</TE>
<TE>   Police have recovered about 70 of the fakes, meaning that more
than 100 are still hanging proudly in public galleries and private
collections.</TE>

<HD>In a Jerusalem First, Gays Take to Streets</HD>
<DH>Activism: Marchers defy religious opposition to hold pride
parade one organizer calls 'glorious.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>JERUSALEM -- Undeterred by the outrage of ultra-Orthodox Jews or fear
of terrorist attack, hundreds of gay activists and their supporters
marched through the heart of downtown Jerusalem under heavy police
guard Friday in the city's first gay pride parade.</LD>
<LD>   By the ebullient standards of San Francisco or even Tel
Aviv--where an annual march has for years drawn tens of thousands--it
was a subdued affair, devoid of floats, marching bands or precision
drills.</LD>
<LD>   One man wore a red velvet dress and a blond wig with waist-length
braids. A teenage girl had strapped rainbow-colored butterfly wings
to her back, and many people waved rainbow banners.</LD>
<TE>   But most of the men and women who walked quietly down King George
V Street, the site of numerous suicide bombings, were dressed in
jeans and T-shirts. For the most part, the sparse crowds that turned
out to watch them neither cheered nor heckled as the marchers passed.</TE>
<TE>   Gay activists in this riven and deeply conservative city said the
mere fact that the parade took place was a victory for a community
that for years has felt unwanted here, and for a city beaten down by
nearly two years of Israeli-Palestinian bloodshed.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a glorious day," said Hagai El-Ad, one of the parade's
organizers and director of the gay organization Open House.</TE>
<TE>   "Our office is on Ben Yehuda Street, where we have many times
heard bombs go off near us," he said. "This is our answer to that, to
have a parade that isn't just about lesbian and gay rights and
equality, but about optimism. This is a chance for people to express
their hope and say that they want to live together in Jerusalem."</TE>
<TE>   A handful of religious protesters held a small
counter-demonstration and hoisted signs saying "You Are Not the
People of Israel" and "Homosexuality, Bestiality and Terrorism
Threaten Humanity." But ultra-Orthodox rabbis had counseled their
adherents to stay away from the march, which they regarded as an
abomination.</TE>
<TE>   Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert expressed understanding for the
marchers but didn't attend and refused to share the costs of the
parade. Nearly half of the City Council's members belong to
ultra-Orthodox or Orthodox religious parties.</TE>
<TE>   "Not an agora of city money is being spent on those sickos, and
the logistical support is from private donations," Jerusalem City
Councilman Eli Smaheyof said. The parade organizers have filed a
court petition asking that the municipality be compelled to share the
costs of the event. A ruling is expected within two months.</TE>
<TE>   Gay life in Israel and the Palestinian-controlled areas of the
West Bank and Gaza Strip is only tentatively emerging from
underground. The Jewish and Muslim religious establishments frown on
open displays of homosexuality, and gay groups have had to fight hard
to gain acceptance. In 1993, Tel Aviv began hosting its gay pride
parade, which has grown into an annual celebration that emphasizes
the city's relatively tolerant atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   But Jerusalem, holy to Jews, Muslims and Christians, has long been
considered a hostile environment for gays.</TE>
<TE>   Parade participants gathered first at Zion Square on Jaffa Street,
another scene of frequent terrorist attacks, briefly infusing a
downtown that most Jerusalemites avoid these days with life and
color. Under arcs of purple, pink and blue balloons, participants
waved placards and flags as they listened to taped rock music in
Hebrew, Arabic and English.</TE>
<TE>   An hour later than planned, they set off up the pedestrian mall
that has been the scene for so many suicide bombing attacks toward
King George V Street. Ilana Tapiro, 46, had come to watch.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm supporting them because I believe in everybody's right to be
free," said Tapiro, a Haifa resident whose daughter lives in
Jerusalem. "People have to wake up and understand that [homosexuals]
are not a virus; they don't do anything bad."</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, Iris Cohen, 37, vehemently disagreed. Shaking with anger
as she saw men holding hands with other men and women kissing women
in the square, Cohen said that gays "contribute to the terrorist
attacks." Their public display, Cohen said, is evidence of how the
nation has strayed from religion.</TE>
<TE>   "It's because these people are violating the Torah, that's why we
have terrorist attacks," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Police hustled away a handful of religious demonstrators who
hurled epithets at marchers. But the parade proceeded largely
peacefully, ending with a rally in the city's Independence Park that
police said drew about 4,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   "This march is symbolic and very powerful," said El-Ad, the
activist. "The reality is that for decades, gay life here has been a
life of complete absence from the public sphere. If you are gay, you
do not exist in this city. For us, it is very moving to be able to
openly walk the streets of a city which is also ours."</TE>

<HD>Indian Spy Plane Shot Down</HD>
<DH>Conflict: Pakistan says it destroyed drone. Report comes
only hours after U.S. envoy expresses optimism about cooling of
rivals' tensions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL WATSON and TYLER MARSHALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NEW DELHI</DL>
<LD>Just hours after a senior U.S. diplomat reported a slight easing of
tensions Friday, Pakistan said its air force shot down a pilotless
Indian spy plane after it crossed the international border.</LD>
<LD>   Pakistani jets brought down the reconnaissance drone around 11
p.m. near the town of Raja Jang south of Lahore, Pakistan's
second-largest city, according to a statement issued in Islamabad,
Pakistan's capital.</LD>
<LD>   Maj. Gen. Rashid Qureshi, a presidential spokesman, called the
incident an example of India's "complete disregard" for
"international norms" and repeated a warning that "if Indian
aggression is launched, Pakistan will defend itself."</LD>
<TE>   In early January, when the two countries were close to war after a
terrorist attack on India's Parliament the previous month, Indian
forces said they shot down a Pakistani drone that had flown over
Indian-controlled territory.</TE>
<TE>   That incident, in the Poonch district of Jammu and Kashmir, was
treated as routine by both sides and did not add to tensions.</TE>
<TE>   The Indian government said Friday that it needed a few more days
to determine whether Pakistan has permanently stopped the
infiltration of fighters into the Indian-ruled portion of Kashmir, a
key condition for an end to its confrontation with Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   The timing of India's assessment would coincide with a visit by
U.S. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, who is expected to arrive
here for high-level talks in the middle of next week.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no established trend as yet" that the infiltrations have
stopped, Indian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Nirupama Rao said
Friday. The previous day, Defense Minister George Fernandes said
fighters were still crossing into the disputed territory from
Pakistani-held areas.</TE>
<TE>   Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee was encouraged by U.S.
Deputy Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage's assurance during a
meeting between the two Friday that Pakistan had promised "to
permanently stop infiltrations," according to an aide to the Indian
leader.</TE>
<TE>   Vajpayee likes and respects Armitage, so his word carries extra
weight, and the Indian leader did not make any specific demands in
the meeting, said the aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity
because of the sensitive nature of the talks.</TE>
<TE>   After meeting with Vajpayee, Armitage told reporters that he
thought "tensions are a little bit down. I feel very good about the
discussions in India."</TE>
<TE>   But Rao said her government still isn't convinced that Pakistani
President Pervez Musharraf is sincere in his commitment to stopping
what India calls cross-border terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "This assurance has been made in the past but had not been
followed up by credible action," Rao told a news conference.</TE>
<TE>   "Therefore, going by past experience, we feel that it is in our
legitimate interests to verify such assurances on the ground. And if
and when we are satisfied that such assurances have been translated
into action, then we can consider reciprocity."</TE>
<TE>   A senior Pakistani official said Armitage had won two concessions
from Musharraf during talks in Islamabad on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The first was a promise to permanently stop the flow of militants
into Indian-controlled territory and not simply open the door again
when the heat is off, the Pakistani source said.</TE>
<TE>   The Pakistani president also agreed to "any kind" of independent
verification to prove the 1972 cease-fire line that divides Kashmir,
called the Line of Control, is closed to infiltrators, the senior
official added.</TE>
<TE>   In return, Musharraf is trying to get a commitment from the U.S.
that it will remain engaged on the Kashmir issue, not just in efforts
to defuse the current crisis but also in searching for a long-term
solution, the source said.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf hopes that Armitage used the concessions as leverage in
New Delhi on Friday to get Vajpayee to make at least a gesture that
could be interpreted as an attempt to de-escalate the crisis,
according to the source. The hope in Islamabad is that this would
eventually lead to direct talks.</TE>
<TE>   Vajpayee wants Indian and Pakistani forces to jointly monitor the
Line of Control. In public statements, Pakistan has been pressing for
an international observer mission; if Musharraf has softened that
demand, it could prove a significant concession.</TE>
<TE>   The two countries' conflicting positions reflect their
long-standing diplomatic strategies. India insists that the dispute
over Kashmir must be settled through bilateral negotiations, without
foreign mediation.</TE>
<TE>   New Delhi fears that outside involvement might force it to hold a
referendum on independence for Kashmir, which Pakistan wants--along
with many Kashmiris, who feel caught in the middle of the 55-year
dispute.</TE>
<TE>   By insisting on an international mission to watch for infiltrators
into Indian-controlled territory, Pakistan hopes to confirm a foreign
role in finally settling the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Armitage called "farfetched" a report that the U.S. and Britain
had offered to send observers to patrol the cease-fire line in
helicopters, and Rao said such a proposal did not come up in
Armitage's talks in New Delhi.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankly, I don't think that is a practical suggestion or a doable
idea at all because the terrain is inhospitable," Rao said. "Nobody
knows it better than the forces of India and Pakistan."</TE>
<TE>   The two armies continued to exchange heavy fire across their front
line Friday.</TE>
<TE>   At least six civilians were killed, three on each side, police
said. And hundreds of terrified residents fled on both sides of the
front line, joining thousands of refugees from recent fighting.</TE>

<HD>Palestinian Gunmen Kill 2 Israelis, Hurt 4</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Two Palestinian gunmen infiltrated a Jewish settlement in the West
Bank and killed at least two Israelis early today, officials said,
hours after armored units moved into Jenin, enforcing a curfew on the
40,000 residents of the Palestinian city.</LD>
<LD>   An army spokeswoman said that armed settlers shot dead one of the
gunmen in the Karmei Tzur settlement just north of Hebron and that
Israeli troops were searching for a second attacker, who escaped.</LD>
<LD>   Four Israelis were wounded in the attack on the settlement,
including two in serious condition, said Yeruham Mendola, spokesman
for the Magen David Adom rescue service. He said the attackers
sneaked into the settlement sometime after 2 a.m.</LD>
<TE>   On Friday, Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat
complained that Israel is waging a "dirty war" with its continued
military strikes, which come in reprisal for attacks on Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   Israel says that Arafat is to blame for continued terrorist
attacks and that he has done nothing to prevent shootings and
bombings by Palestinian extremists.</TE>
<TE>   A senior Israeli official said Friday that Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon, who is heading to Washington this weekend to discuss new
ideas for ending the conflict with Palestinians, will not commit to
any plans until attacks on Israeli citizens stop.</TE>
<TE>   The purpose of Sharon's trip is to offer suggestions on the United
States' emerging Mideast peace plan, expected to be unveiled in
coming days, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, President Bush said Friday that he was optimistic
that talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, which were
scheduled to continue today, and a meeting with Sharon set for Monday
will be fruitful.</TE>
<TE>   "After my meetings ... I'll talk to our country about how I
believe we should move forward," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   In what Israel says are continuing responses to Palestinian
attacks on civilians, about 20 armored vehicles rolled into the West
Bank city of Jenin on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Jenin is the hometown of a 17-year-old Islamic extremist who
killed himself and 17 Israelis in a suicide bombing this week, and a
refugee camp there was the site of bitter fighting during the
Israelis' five-week incursion into the West Bank this spring.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, soldiers declared a curfew, confining residents to
their homes.</TE>

<HD>Shanghai Helping the Hard-to-Market Help Themselves</HD>
<DH>China: Entrepreneurs get tax breaks for employing some of
the port city's million jobless. But willingness to do grunt tasks is
in short supply.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHING-CHING NI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SHANGHAI</DL>
<LD>The first time she lifted a dead body, she turned as cold as the
corpse.</LD>
<LD>   But Wang Qin wouldn't let her staff see her shaking.</LD>
<LD>   It was her job to comb the dead woman's hair, cut her nails and
put on her makeup.</LD>
<TE>   "It was total cultural shock at first," said the 46-year-old
laid-off office clerk who now owns a funeral home. "I didn't know how
to do anything else. But I knew if I wanted to work, I had to find
something no one else was willing to do."</TE>
<TE>   Immigrants all over the world have mastered that simple rule of
survival. But China's "iron rice bowl" generation is just now getting
a crash course in it.</TE>
<TE>   Five decades of Communist rule fostered a widespread culture of
dependency. The members of the Chinese working class leaned on the
state for cradle-to-grave social services. They savored their status
as masters of the proletariat. They never expected to stoop so
low--fending for themselves in a competitive market economy.</TE>
<TE>   But the era of cushy state jobs is gone forever. Harsh economic
reforms have produced an unemployment avalanche. Every year, the
nation's growing jobless figure swells up against an economy unable
to generate enough jobs. Mass labor protests across the country,
particularly in the northern rust belt, provide blunt reminders of
the dire consequences China faces if the unemployed millions fail to
adjust to the fall from a workers' paradise.</TE>
<TE>   A dynamic city with old-economy woes and new-economy wealth,
Shanghai is in an ideal position to push its labor force toward more
financial independence.</TE>
<TE>   A first-of-its-kind program started by the city government and
known as Project 4050 targets the least marketable members of China's
old command economy--women over 40 and men over 50. Lacking skills,
they have long been tagged the weakest link in China's bloated labor
force and face the toughest time finding new work.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than expecting them to make do on about $30 a month in
unemployment benefits, the city urges them to become their own
bosses. If they start a business and hire fellow 4050 workers, they
can enjoy tax breaks and management guidance. Whether that be
delivering food or dressing the dead, it's up to them to figure out
what the market needs and profit from it.</TE>
<TE>   "Shanghai's goal is to promote an entrepreneurial culture," said
Wang Zhenhuan, a project manager. "If 20% of the unemployed state
workers could start their own businesses, they could help employ the
rest of the 80%."</TE>
<TE>   Since it started last year, the program has produced more than 700
small businesses and about 33,000 jobs, according to Wang. That's a
drop in the bucket considering the city's more than 1 million
unemployed, but the Shanghai model is a closely watched experiment
rich with lessons about the hardships of transforming an idle labor
force.</TE>
<TE>   "Any work is better than staying home and doing nothing,"
49-year-old Wang Zhiming said. From the time he was 17, he was a chef
at Shanghai's once renowned People's Restaurant. But he was let go in
1996 after poor business forced the government to trim staff at the
state-owned eatery.</TE>
<TE>   For half the pay and twice the work, he became foreman at the
Green Dining Table, a 4050 enterprise that cooks, packs and delivers
school lunches. But Wang is learning to take pride in his job,
hollering at and hustling five dozen workers, making sure they put
hot meals into 7,000 children's hands without a glitch.</TE>
<TE>   "It was really hard to get used to," Wang said, pausing only after
the last truck drove off. "Now I tell my crew all the time, 'If you
don't work hard today, you have to work harder tomorrow to find a new
job.' "</TE>
<TE>   But the iron rice bowl is a hard habit to break.</TE>
<TE>   Many new entrepreneurs have discovered that it is easy to create
jobs but much harder to find good help.</TE>
<TE>   At the Green Dinning Table, washing the dishes became a daily test
of the will to work.</TE>
<TE>   When the first batch of 4050 workers saw the mountains of dirty
trays, they chickened out and fled.</TE>
<TE>   "They told me this work is not meant for humans," said Han
Zhiqiang, 51, who was laid off as the manager at a state-owned meat
and produce market. He and his wife opened the lunch business last
year on the top floor of a bankrupt clock factory.</TE>
<TE>   "My wife and I had no choice but to roll up our sleeves and start
washing," Han said. "We didn't finish until 3:30 in the morning."</TE>
<TE>   It's easy to get lazy after staying home too long, said Ho
Jingzhen, 46, a single mother who was laid off from a textile factory
four years ago. She now wakes up every day before dawn to make soy
milk from scratch for her Do Bao Bao beverage stand.</TE>
<TE>   She said many job-seekers she has interviewed simply don't
understand what an employer needs. Some have told her upfront that
they don't want to work hard.</TE>
<TE>   "The first thing they want to know is, 'How much does it pay and
is it tiring?' " said Ho, who is on her feet 18 hours a day, soaking
beans, stirring soy, frying tofu and tending to customers. "Then they
tell me they have this or that kind of health problem. Is it OK to
give them only light tasks? I tell them, forget it!"</TE>
<TE>   If it wasn't for the tax breaks, many Project 4050 employers
concede, they would hire migrant workers from China's impoverished
countryside. Like migrants everywhere, such employees tend to work
harder for less.</TE>
<TE>   "Even now, I count on only migrant workers to wash the dishes,"
said Han, who like many other business owners supplements his staff
with younger, non-4050 laborers who also function as role models for
city "slackers."</TE>
<TE>   "They really appreciate the chance to work here," Han said, "and
they can eat a lot more bitterness."</TE>
<TE>   Former state workers, on the other hand, have been spoiled by the
system.</TE>
<TE>   "If they really want a job in Shanghai, they can find one within
24 hours," said Dai Xianhua, a manager at a milk delivery service and
a former manager at one of Shanghai's leading government department
stores. "But they don't want just any job. The state pays them $100 a
month for a family of three to do nothing. Why should they work six
days a week for $60?"</TE>
<TE>   Those willing to change, however, see Project 4050 as a great way
to start over.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to be the boss of an entire factory--even my wife and
neighbors looked up to me," said Pan Defu, 51, who lost his job after
his machine factory went belly up. Then Wang Qin hired him to help
her build her funeral business.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't tell my wife for six months what I was doing," Pan
said in the tiny storefront crowded with paper wreaths, ash boxes and
silk robes for the dead. "In the old days, people like us [funeral
workers] couldn't even find anyone to marry. I stuck with it because
I knew there is a market for what we do. More important than that, I
needed the job to survive."</TE>
<TE>   Jiao Qiankun is literally a rocket scientist who spent more than
20 years at a remote test site. But the 58-year-old said he was
downsized and returned to his native Shanghai with nothing.</TE>
<TE>   "I gave my youth to my country and did everything the party asked
me to do. Now I'm old, and I have no sense of security," said Jiao,
an overqualified bookkeeper and health inspector at the Green Dining
Table. "If I stayed home and dwelt on my resentment, I might die
early from heartache. It's better to work and do something with my
time."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Dismisses Mexico's Plan to Ease Water Debt</HD>
<DH>Irrigation: Offer of 32 billion gallons over four months is
too little, officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD BOUDREAUX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>Mexico offered to deliver 32 billion gallons of its huge water debt
to the United States over the next four months, but the Bush
administration dismissed the proposal as too little relief for
drought-stricken Texas farmers, U.S. officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The offer was part of Mexican President Vicente Fox's much-awaited
plan for settling a conflict that is testing his friendship with
President Bush and becoming a major point of friction between the
neighboring countries.</LD>
<LD>   A high-level Mexican delegation outlined the plan Thursday to U.S.
officials in Washington. The dispute, aggravated by a decade-old
drought afflicting thousands of farmers on both sides of the border,
is so sensitive that neither side would speak publicly about the
substance of the talks.</LD>
<TE>   American officials said privately that the Mexican payback offer
was less than one-third of what they had proposed. Both sides said
they would restudy the issue and meet again soon.</TE>
<TE>   Under a 1944 treaty, Mexico owes the United States more than 480
billion gallons, enough to supply the city of Los Angeles for more
than two years. The treaty obliges Mexico to turn over 114 billion
gallons a year where six Mexican tributaries flow into the Rio
Grande. That water is measured and stored at two Texas reservoirs,
which have been drained to about 15% of their capacity.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico's public position is that the country has no obligation to
begin repaying the debt until late September, the start of a new
five-year treaty period. Fox, who inherited the water debt from two
predecessors, is under pressure from parched Mexican communities and
some border governors to wait.</TE>
<TE>   But he is also under diplomatic counter-pressure because farmers
in Bush's home state of Texas are facing crop failure in a state
election year. Bush has telephoned Fox twice about the debt in the
last month. When Secretary of State Colin L. Powell met his Mexican
counterpart, Foreign Secretary Jorge Castaneda, in Barbados this
week, the first thing Powell said was, "Water, water, water,"
according to U.S. officials.</TE>
<TE>   In Thursday's talks, Washington demanded 32 billion gallons of
immediate relief, an additional 82 billion gallons between now and
Sept. 26, and repayment of the remaining water debt in phases over
the next five years, U.S. officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, they said, the Mexicans offered 32 billion gallons by
Sept. 26 and asked for $100 million in U.S. loans to build a water
system that would reduce Mexico's losses of irrigation and waste
water through leakage and evaporation.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tough issue," one U.S. official said.</TE>

<DL>BRUSSELS</DL>
<LD>The U.S. plans to reposition American troops operating in and around
Pakistan if war breaks out between India and Pakistan, Air Force Gen.
Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Myers told reporters that he could not discuss details of the
contingency plan, which had not been implemented as of Friday.</LD>
<LD>   About 7,000 U.S. troops are in Afghanistan, which shares a border
with Pakistan. A smaller number of American forces are in Pakistan,
and sailors and Marines are in the northern Arabian Sea. Thousands of
troops from allied countries also are in the area.</LD>
<TE>   In Afghanistan on Friday, U.S. and British forces said they
uncovered a cache of weapons and explosives during a raid on a tiny
farming village that soldiers said Al Qaeda had turned into a site
for planning attacks.</TE>
<TE>   About 120 U.S. Special Forces and British marines swept into
Atalay village in southern Afghanistan before dawn Thursday. They
seized four compounds and took 17 people into custody, British Lt.
Cmdr. Gary Lydiate said.</TE>
<TE>   All but five of the prisoners were later released, U.S. spokesman
Roger King said Friday. Those five were thought to have "intelligence
value," though they were still being questioned.</TE>
<TE>   Troops found weapons, plastic explosives and bomb-making
equipment, as well as documents of intelligence value that were being
analyzed, King said.</TE>
<TE>   The contingency plans for the repositioning of U.S. forces were
drawn up by Gen. Tommy Franks, who is responsible for U.S. troops in
Pakistan, Afghanistan and the Arabian Sea, and Adm. Thomas Fargo,
chief of the U.S. Pacific Command, whose area of responsibility
includes India.</TE>
<TE>   Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld has expressed concern that
the dispute over the Himalayan region of Kashmir could distract the
Pakistani military from helping the Pentagon pursue Al Qaeda and
Taliban fighters near the Afghan border.</TE>

<HD>Shortage of Beds Is Straining Hospitals</HD>
<DH>Health: Many facilities in the state delay care and shuffle
patients. The problem may get worse.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After years of empty beds and hospital closures, a growing number of
medical centers in California are straining from surging demand and
not enough beds to provide sufficient care.</LD>
<LD>   The shortage of hospital beds has caused delays in elective
surgery and other admissions, more diversions of patients to other
facilities and problems that have added to the backlog in emergency
rooms.</LD>
<LD>   Hospitals are responding by installing sophisticated bed-tracking
systems, adjusting surgery hours and developing ways to do more
procedures on an outpatient basis. Some have converted offices into
patient rooms, adding a smattering of beds.</LD>
<TE>   But there are few new hospitals being built in the state. And with
a critical shortage of nurses and more hospitals almost certain to be
shuttered, many health providers and analysts said the capacity
crunch being felt by some will spread and get progressively worse.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the effects so far have been matters of inconvenience
rather than life and death, but if the trend continues, experts say
it could have an effect on care.</TE>
<TE>   Ian H. Taras, an obstetrician and gynecologist in the San Fernando
Valley, said he is scheduling caesarean sections into November
because the medical center he uses in Tarzana usually is full.</TE>
<TE>   The most difficult cases, he said, are patients whose needs are
between serious and urgent. Earlier this year, when an expectant
mother of twins went into pre-term labor, he told her to check into
Encino Tarzana Regional Medical Center. But the Tarzana hospital was
packed, and Taras and his patient hastily changed plans and went to
West Hills Hospital a few miles away</TE>
<TE>   "She was counting on going to Tarzana," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Orthopedic surgeon Kent Adamson said he is working more successive
late-night shifts, waiting for an open operating room at Mission
Hospital Regional Medical Center in south Orange County. That's made
his job more stressful.</TE>
<TE>   "It's doable but not the optimal situation," he said. "I feel
we're treading and treading pretty hard and succeeding, but how long
can you stay afloat?"</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of hospitals, especially smaller ones, still have plenty of
unused beds. But statewide, the occupancy rate of available hospital
beds--which had remained at the same level during much of the last
decade--has risen steadily since 1996 to 64% last year, according to
the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development. Many
hospitals are running well above that average, and some are exceeding
the 85% rate that experts consider essentially full.</TE>
<TE>   In the last two decades, more than 100 community hospitals have
closed in California, according to a July 2001 study by Shattuck
Hammond Partners, a consulting firm. The state Department of Health
Services said there are about 450 acute-care hospitals in the state.</TE>
<TE>   Many hospitals have collapsed under financial pressure from
managed care, cutbacks in Medicare and government reimbursements and
what many considered too much competition.</TE>
<TE>   Although hospitals nationwide are running out of beds, in many
ways the problem is more critical in California, which has far fewer
hospital beds per population than most other states. Yet California's
population is growing much more quickly than the nation as a whole,
and for the first time in many years hospital usage and average
length of stays are increasing.</TE>
<TE>   The rise in hospital visits and stays is expected to continue,
reflecting the loosening of restrictions under managed care, the
aging of baby boomers and a higher percentage of critical cases,
which some believe is partly the result of delayed care.</TE>
<TE>   Childrens Hospital Los Angeles said it is facing an unprecedented
increase in demand for services.</TE>
<TE>   Occupancy at the 314-bed hospital is hovering at close to 80%. The
hospital acknowledged that lack of staff and resources has
contributed to delays in treatment.</TE>
<TE>   "But these delays are generally hours, not days," the hospital
said, noting that it has not reached a point in which care has been
compromised.</TE>
<TE>   At Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, 95% of its 850 available beds were
occupied on a recent Friday. The hospital had no flexibility because
the few vacant beds were for only pediatric and obstetrics use.</TE>
<TE>   Linda Burnes Bolton, the hospital's chief nursing officer, said
there was a bed for each of the 75 surgeries scheduled for that day.
But by early afternoon, five doctors who wanted to admit new patients
were told to wait.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a typical Friday," said Bolton, who meets three times
daily with other managers to map out the day's bedding situation.</TE>
<TE>   Until February, when Cedars-Sinai added surgery on Saturdays and
had them go later into the evening on weekdays, the Los Angeles
hospital was forced to cancel three or four surgeries a day. Since
then, the hospital has not canceled any scheduled operations, Bolton
said.</TE>
<TE>   What she and others cannot control are patient visits through the
emergency department, which account for four out of 10 admissions at
major trauma-center hospitals such as Cedars-Sinai. Overcrowding in
emergency rooms has been a burgeoning problem nationwide, with the
large number of uninsured patients who typically go to emergency
rooms when they have health problems. When emergency arrivals
increase, that causes bottlenecks on other floors. But the congestion
flows the other way too.</TE>
<TE>   "If the hospital is full, we hold patients in the ER, so
everything stops. They can't go anywhere, so we fill up," said Dr.
Ray Ricci, chairman of the emergency department at Hoag Memorial
Hospital Presbyterian in Newport Beach, where the average daily
occupancy is close to 90%. "When the hospital is full, the ER is the
final sink of the plumbing system."</TE>
<TE>   Health-care analysts worry that the hospital system in California,
and especially in Los Angeles County--which is facing a huge budget
shortfall and cutbacks in its medical system--will feel mounting
pressure in coming years from capacity constraints.</TE>
<TE>   Many hospital operators in California will not have as much money
to build facilities because they are spending hundreds of millions of
dollars on meeting seismic retrofitting requirements at existing
facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Even if more hospitals could be constructed, many health
professionals wonder whether there would be enough nurses to care for
the additional patients. Indeed, some said constraint of hospital
capacity has as much to do with staffing as it does with space.
Hospital officials point out that the state's mandated
nurse-to-patient ratio means they can't add more beds if they don't
have enough nurses to attend to the patient increase.</TE>
<TE>   Demand, meanwhile, is expected to keep growing.</TE>
<TE>   "It means that most of the existing hospitals will be fuller and
fuller and fuller," said Wanda Jones, president of New Century
Healthcare Institute, a research foundation in San Francisco. For
years, Jones watched California's hospital occupancy rise in the
winter flu season, drop off in the spring and pick up in the fall.
More recently, she said, the pattern of higher bed use has been
steadier.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to experience a fairly substantial 50-year population
growth and a major growth in seniors," said Jones. "We will have to
have additional capacity."</TE>
<TE>   Sutter Health, a nonprofit operator of 26 hospitals in Northern
California, said it will focus mainly on outpatient facilities and
bulk up its ambulatory-care departments rather than add beds. Dr.
Gordon Hunt, Sutter's chief medical officer, is betting that advances
in medical technology and drugs will significantly reduce the need
for beds in the next decade. But he has this caveat:</TE>
<TE>   "It is very hard to plan for future hospital closures," Hunt said.
"We see a lot of hospitals that don't appear to be stable for the
long term."</TE>
<TE>   Tenet Healthcare Corp., the state's largest hospital operator,
with 43 facilities, this year announced two closures: Daniel Freeman
Marina Hospital in Marina del Rey and St. Luke Medical Center in
Pasadena, each with about 165 beds. The two hospitals did not meet
Tenet's profitability requirements.</TE>
<TE>   But Tenet also is building a 10-story addition next to its USC
University Hospital and adding beds to facilities in Los Alamitos and
Redding, Calif., among other places. Hoag Memorial is one of the few
independent hospitals that is undertaking a major expansion,
including a seven-story women's health center on its sprawling
Newport Beach campus. But it will be four years before an additional
80 beds are ready.</TE>
<TE>   Six months ago, the 414-bed hospital installed a tracking system
that automatically signals to admitting staff, housekeeping and
nurses when beds are being vacated.</TE>
<TE>   Hoag has asked doctors to make rounds earlier so patients can be
discharged earlier in the day.</TE>
<TE>   The hospital staff is developing outpatient protocols for some
conditions such as cellulitis, an inflammation of connective tissue,
usually in the lower leg. Ricci said Hoag sees 217 patients for
cellulitis annually, who spend an average of 4.8 days in the
hospital. That would save more than 1,000 patient days each year.</TE>
<TE>   "If we do not have space, we have to make it more efficient," he
said.</TE>

<HD>Ticket for Finals, $12,000; Courtside View? Priceless</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN FIELDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>How much would a person pay to land one precious floor seat for the
NBA Finals, and, with it, entree into the Los Angeles Lakers'
peculiar Xanadu of fame, beauty and power?</LD>
<LD>   The answer, ticket brokers say, is as much as $12,000, enough to
cover a year of tuition, room and board at UCLA or, if you'd prefer,
30 rounds of Botox injections. That's if you can get them at all--far
from a slam-dunk proposition.</LD>
<LD>   Come the playoffs, Staples Center's first few rows become Southern
California's priciest real estate. Studios have been known to bid for
the rights to prize vantage points like they would for bestsellers.
Hollywood couples have written their disposition into divorce
settlements.</LD>
<TE>   Mostly, it is a territory prowled by season ticket holders and
their guests, celebrities and corporate pooh-bahs. Those at Friday's
Game 2 between the Lakers and the New Jersey Nets said there was no
price--not love, not money--that would get them to part with their
seats on the Staples floor.</TE>
<TE>   But if brokers are to be believed, a few, a tiny trickle, a minute
handful of tickets reach a public willing to pay the moon to share
airspace with Jack Nicholson and hear the meaty thud of Shaq's
shoulder meeting the solar plexus of a hapless defender.</TE>
<TE>   For his slice of paradise, Mondo Martinez, a longshoreman from San
Pedro, shelled out $900, a bargain price for a seat a few rows behind
the basket. He came with three buddies, none of whom would qualify as
rich or famous, and all of whom seemed deliriously happy to be so
close to courtside for a championship series game.</TE>
<TE>   "I just can't believe I lucked out," said Andy Aguilar, who got
one of the seats when Martinez's girlfriend couldn't make it. Another
pal, Preston Easley, a maritime injury attorney from San Pedro, said
this was about more than mere hoops.</TE>
<TE>   "Stargazing is part of the fun," Easley said. "It gives it a bit
of luster. You're not just seeing a basketball game."</TE>
<TE>   There are some 20,000 seats at Staples but only 124 floor seats
for the Finals, six fewer than in the regular season to accommodate
the NBC broadcasting team.</TE>
<TE>   Each Finals floor seat ticket has a face value of $2,000 and all
are owned by season ticket holders, most in lots of two or four. It's
been many, many years since any of these seats came up for grabs,
said John Black, the Lakers' director of public relations.</TE>
<TE>   A small percentage make their way into the resale market and, by
Thursday, the city's most entrenched ticket brokers claimed to have
courtside seats for prices ranging from $5,500 to $12,000 a pop.
Seats in the first seven rows of the arena's lower bowl were somewhat
more attainable, ranging from $900 to $9,750 each.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Gabel, a long-suffering Nets fan from Highland Park, N.J.,
said he was offered floor seats from a broker in Connecticut for
$17,000 apiece. Thanks but no thanks, he said. Instead, he bought
four seats in Row B, just off center court, for a price he wouldn't
specify--except to say that each ticket had three zeroes and then
some.</TE>
<TE>   Gabel, an environmental and energy consultant, said he's never
done anything "within 500 miles" of such extravagance, but, well, it
seemed like the thing to do. He came with four friends, one of whom
was celebrating his 40th birthday.</TE>
<TE>   "This is huge for me," Gabel said at halftime. So far, he said, it
had been well worth it, even though his team ended up losing by 23
points. "It's not quite Continental Arena," the Nets' home court at
the Meadowlands, "but it's close to heaven," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers give away house seats for each game (they are reluctant
to say how many), but a hefty chunk are controlled by the league and
sponsors, or are given to guests of the opposing team.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Harris, the team's vice president of sales and marketing,
juggles calls from the celebrities and corporate big shots--or, more
often, from their people--who want the rest.</TE>
<TE>   "It's amusing when they give you the throwaway, 'I'm willing to
pay,' " said Harris. "Sometimes the label or publicist will add, 'Oh,
by the way, they wouldn't be opposed if you wanted to put them on the
video board.' As if that's gonna make a difference."</TE>
<TE>   It's no simple numbers game for Harris, either. In a company town
rife with feuds and tangled personal relationships, the seating chart
at Staples can be as ticklish as a formal dinner at the White House.
At Wednesday's game, the team inadvertently put a celebrity in a
house seat directly in front of her ex-husband.</TE>
<TE>   Penny Marshall, director and Laker fixture, casts an empathetic
eye on all the playoff machinations from her floor seat near the
visiting team's bench.</TE>
<TE>   "I see a lot of people who don't usually come," she said, quickly
adding that she sees them neither as fair-weather fans nor as
desperate for TV time.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't put them down for trying to get tickets," she said. "I'm
going to New Jersey. I was up in Sacramento."</TE>
<TE>   Marshall is one of the longtime A-list Laker regulars, along with
Nicholson, Dustin Hoffman and Dyan Cannon. She sits next to Will
Smith or, when he's working, members of his family. Her brother,
director Garry Marshall, sits a few rows back. Brokers hoping to
resell her seat for the Finals can forget about it.</TE>
<TE>   "I, personally, won't work during the playoffs," she said. "I'll
edit, but I won't shoot."</TE>
<TE>   Among the celebrities now holding tickets for the playoffs are Ray
Romano, Leonardo DiCaprio, Edward Norton, Salma Hayek, David
Schwimmer, Queen Latifah, David Spade, Kim Delaney, Danny DeVito,
Carson Daly, Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, and one of the newest
celebrities in Hollywood, Jack Osbourne, the teenage son of Ozzy
Osbourne, who debuted in the family's television show on MTV this
winter.</TE>
<TE>   "The celebrities all want to be part of the sports world, and our
players all want to be part of the entertainment world," said Charlie
Rosenzweig, vice president of entertainment and player marketing for
NBA Entertainment. "We do our best to accommodate, and it's always a
last-minute scramble."</TE>
<TE>   Not all of the front-row regulars are celebrities, although all
would fall into the category of people with substantial discretionary
income.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Simmons, an attorney in L.A., and not the diet/workout
booster, has two courtside seats and also has seats elsewhere in the
arena that he sold for $900 apiece. The Row A seats weren't for sale.</TE>
<TE>   "I was offered a couple grand for these, and I said no way,"
Simmons said.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Enslie, an investment banker in attendance with a colleague
and two CEO clients, had seats belonging to his bosses , Bank of
America Securities.</TE>
<TE>   Technically speaking, he was working. Still, he said, "I don't
charge overtime for this."</TE>
<TE>   Some say the appeal of courtside seats for the Lakers has little
to do with basketball. "People come purely to watch other people,"
said a Staples Center official. "You're on camera the whole time and,
clearly, with Jack and the others, there's a stature in being there."</TE>
<TE>   But broker Joe Gaynor, a.k.a. Joe the Ticket Guy, said paying five
figures for Lakers tickets is no more irrational than anything else
die-hard sports fans do--and isn't that the point?</TE>
<TE>   "Why do they paint their faces? Why does a guy with a stomach
bigger than his car take his shirt off?" he said. "This could be your
once-in-a-lifetime splurge. How many Finals will you get to see in
your lifetime?"</TE>
<TE>   As for himself, Gaynor said he sat in the fourth-to-last row at
the only World Series game he's ever attended.</TE>
<TE>   "All I cared about was that I was at the game."</TE>

<HD>Anthrax Threat Known, Suit Says</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: White House staffers were warned of attacks and
took Cipro, group says. Action is filed on postal workers' behalf.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A conservative group is suing the Bush administration for access to
documents surrounding last fall's anthrax attacks, saying that top
officials may have known that the bioterrorist assault was coming.</LD>
<LD>   Judicial Watch said Friday it has yet to receive documents from
several agencies after filing requests under the Freedom of
Information Act. The group says the documents will show who knew what
and when they knew it.</LD>
<LD>   Judicial Watch, which also has sued for documents about Vice
President Dick Cheney's energy task force, represents U.S. postal
workers at the Brentwood mail-handling facility in Washington. Two
workers from Brentwood died of inhalation anthrax before officials
shut down the facility, which had handled anthrax-laden letters
headed for Capitol Hill.</LD>
<TE>   Larry Klayman, chairman of Judicial Watch, noted that
administration officials said last fall that some White House staff
had begun taking the antibiotic Cipro on Sept. 11, weeks before the
anthrax attacks were made public.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe that the White House knew or had reason to know that
an anthrax attack was imminent or underway," Klayman said.</TE>
<TE>   White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe denied the charge: "We did
not know about the anthrax attacks. Period."</TE>
<TE>   Johndroe said he didn't know with certainty why staffers were
given Cipro but guessed it was "a precautionary measure in the early
hours of Sept. 11 before the situation could be fully assessed." He
said he has not seen the lawsuit and had no comment on whether the
documents would be released.</TE>
<TE>   Judicial Watch is suing the U.S. Postal Service, the federal
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the FBI, the Department
of Health and Human Services, and the National Institute for Allergy
and Infectious Diseases.</TE>

<DH>Grants: Approval of preparedness reports ensures millions

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Bioterrorism preparedness plans submitted by 24 states and two cities
were approved by the federal government, allowing the release of
millions of dollars in funding for public health programs.</LD>
<LD>   The $1 billion in grants, which will eventually go to all 50
states, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., was the largest onetime
investment ever in the nation's public health systems. Recipients
were asked to issue progress reports on their plans by Oct. 1.</LD>
<LD>   The first 20% of the state and local preparation money was awarded
before the plans were submitted.</LD>
<TE>   Those whose plans were approved were being awarded the remaining
80% of their funds, Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G.
Thompson said Thursday at a Manhattan hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "We have rejected a couple, but overall, they were great plans,"
Thompson said.</TE>
<TE>   In January, Thompson announced that more than $1 billion in grants
would be available to state and local governments if they submitted
preparation plans that won approval from his Office of Public Health
Preparedness.</TE>
<TE>   States were expected to spend the money on building lab capacity;
linking more health departments to the national Health Alert Network,
which provides warnings about disease outbreaks; adding
epidemiologists to state staffs; and developing education and
training programs for doctors, nurses, local public health officials
and the public.</TE>
<TE>   Receiving approval were 24 states plus New York City and Chicago.
Los Angeles and an additional 24 states are receiving some money, but
their full amounts will only be awarded "following further plan
development," according to HHS.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson announced the grants and presented checks to New York
Gov. George Pataki and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, calling the state
and city "national leaders on the public health and emergency
preparedness front."</TE>
<TE>   New York City receives $20.9 million in grants for its
bioterrorism preparedness plans.</TE>
<TE>   It already received $5.2 million in January when Thompson
announced the grants. The state gets $27.1 million on top of its
initial $6.7 million.</TE>

years in prison.</LD>

sister was alive and well.</LD>

<LD>Want a lighthouse? The Interior Department has a deal for you. It's
trying to get rid of 301 of them.</LD>
<LD>   The Coast Guard, which has automated the nation's coastal lighting
system, is willing to give them away to anybody who'll offer them a
good home. There are two catches: Government and nonprofit groups
have first dibs; and lighthouses are extremely expensive to keep up.</LD>
<LD>   Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton will announce next week the
first six being turned over.</LD>
<TE>   Anyone taking on a lighthouse can expect to spend millions of
dollars. It must be maintained according to strict federal standards,

kept up.</TE>

<LD>A teenager has been charged with making false claims of sexual abuse
against a retired priest.</LD>
<LD>   The 14-year-old boy told Utica authorities about two weeks ago
that Msgr. H. Charles Sewall had recently molested him. But
investigators found inconsistencies in his story and the boy
recanted, a prosecutor said.</LD>
<LD>   This week, three men filed $20-million lawsuits alleging Sewall,
67, molested them as teenagers in the 1970s and 1980s.</LD>
<TE>   On May 3, Sewall issued an apology, admitting to sexual misconduct
with a teen in the 1970s.</TE>

<HD>Bishops Rescind Invitation to Advocate</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Roman Catholic bishops on Friday revoked their invitation to a
leading advocate for victims of clerical sexual abuse to address
their convention, saying a lawsuit he joined against them created a
legal barrier to discussion.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops said the lawsuit filed in
Minnesota makes it impossible for them to hear from David Clohessy,
who is the national director of the Survivors Network of Those Abused
by Priests.</LD>
<LD>   Clohessy, members of the network and other victims also had been
scheduled to meet privately with three cardinals on the eve of next
week's conference and address a closed session of the bishops' panel
devising a national policy on disciplining abusive clergy. Because of
the lawsuit, the network's members cannot participate in those
discussions, which will be held as planned, the bishops' conference
said.</LD>
<TE>   Clohessy said he was "stunned" by the bishops' action.</TE>
<TE>   Plans for the meetings had been finalized late Thursday, the same
day Clohessy's group filed the class-action lawsuit against the
bishops' conference and several dioceses. The suit seeks to void
confidentiality agreements in settlements with victims.</TE>
<TE>   Bishop Wilton Gregory, the conference president, said he had been
working with the group for more than a month to arrange for its
participation in the Dallas convention and was upset that his efforts
were "met with a lawsuit."</TE>
<TE>   Two of the dioceses named as defendants--the Archdiocese of St.
Paul and Minneapolis and the Diocese of Jefferson City, Mo.--were led
by members of the committee who were rewriting the bishops' policy on
responding to molestation claims.</TE>

<HD>Columbine Families Settle Lawsuits</HD>
<DH>Courts: The school district and sheriff's office both offer
$15,000 payments to relatives of shooting victims.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>The families of several Columbine shooting victims have settled
lawsuits with the school district and sheriff's office, with one
attorney saying the time had come to "bring this to a close."</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuits accused officials of failing to do enough to prevent
the 1999 slayings at Columbine High School and botching the response
afterward.</LD>
<LD>   The school district will pay an average $15,000 apiece to the
families of seven students, said Bill Kowalski, the school district's
attorney.</LD>
<TE>   "Our view is that it is simply time to bring this to a close,"
Kowalski, the school district's attorney, said Friday. "The
plaintiffs expressed the same desire, and so it was one of the
situations where both sides wanted the same thing."</TE>
<TE>   The Jefferson County Sheriff's Office also offered $15,000 to the
families of 11 victims. Six have accepted and the other five were
expected to, said county attorney spokeswoman Jennifer Watson.</TE>
<TE>   The two settlements leave no more lawsuits related to injuries or
death from the shooting against the school district. Two cases are
pending against the sheriff's office.</TE>
<TE>   Seniors Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 13 people and wounded
about two dozen more before taking their own lives.</TE>
<TE>   Families of victims have said the settlement money is mostly
symbolic.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted answers; we wanted full disclosure of what the school
district and the sheriff did that day and prior to that," said Randy
Graves, the father of Sean Graves, who was wounded and left partially
paralyzed. "I think we accomplished that."</TE>
<TE>   Graves said the $30,000 his son would receive--$15,000 from the
district and the same amount from the sheriff's office--probably
won't cover the future costs of his injuries. "I'm not sure what his
future needs are going to be, and that's what I feel my
responsibility is--to help him for the future," Graves said.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the settlements, the school district and sheriff's
office agreed to drop their demand for legal fees. The settlements
will likely be entered in court next week, officials said.</TE>

<DL>ASHFORD, Wash.</DL>
<LD>Two climbers fell to their deaths on Mt. Rainier, and a couple
planning to be married at the 14,411-foot summit and a minister-guide
survived a separate fall, rangers said.</LD>
<LD>   The bodies of Benjamin Hernstedt, 25, of Tigard, Ore., and Jeffrey
Dupuis, 21, of Big Flats, N.Y., were retrieved by helicopter Thursday
night, said Jill Hawk, chief ranger of Mt. Rainier National Park.</LD>
<LD>   The falls occurred eight days after three people died when they
were caught by high winds and whiteout conditions while descending
the Washington summit.</LD>
<TE>   It was unclear when Hernstedt and Dupuis fell. Neither had climbed
the mountain before, according to their climbing registration cards.</TE>
<TE>   Melody Wyman, 48, and Charles Grubbs, 50, both of Manchester,
N.H., along with Kurt Wedberg, 35, a mountain guide and licensed
minister, fell about 60 feet into a crevasse Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   All three were roped together when at least one lost footing.</TE>
<TE>   Rangers and guides pulled the three to safety.</TE>

<HD>Off-Road Diesels to Be Subject to Clean-Air Rules</HD>
<DH>Pollution: For first time, government will target farm and
construction equipment. Critics say plan could let some engines
escape controls.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY POLAKOVIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Bush administration announced Friday that the federal government
will, for the first time, target high-polluting diesel-powered farm
and construction equipment, but environmentalists warn that the plan
could allow some diesel engines to escape stringent control.</LD>
<LD>   So-called off-road engines, which power bulldozers, steamrollers
and tractors, long have been a missing element in the federal efforts
to clean the air. Thousands of machines used at construction sites
and farms have gone unregulated, posing serious impediments in states
such as California that are struggling to meet clean-air goals.</LD>
<LD>   To deal with the problem, the Bush administration outlined a
four-prong strategy to target diesel fuel and engines that power the
soot-spewing machines. In an unusual step, the proposal is being
jointly crafted by the White House Office of Management and Budget
and the Environmental Protection Agency. The two agencies will draft
a final regulation to be released next year.</LD>
<TE>   "The most significant environmental issues in terms of human
health are elevated levels of fine particles. Other than reducing
power plant emissions, we have to reduce emissions from these
non-road engines. This is a big deal," said Jeffrey R. Holmstead, the
EPA's director of air programs.</TE>
<TE>   Among the strategies the Bush administration is considering are
giving manufacturers of diesel engines breaks for early introduction
of low-polluting machines and credits that they can swap among trucks
and buses on the highways and tractors and cranes, for instance, used
off-road.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole idea is to push the envelope as far as we can and also
provide an incentive to provide cleaner technologies," Holmstead
said.</TE>
<TE>   But the credit-trading component of the program has
environmentalists and Democratic Rep. Henry A. Waxman of Los Angeles,
an architect of the Clean Air Act, crying foul. Critics say the plan
will allow engine manufacturers the choice of cleaning up either
trucks and buses, or farm and construction equipment, rather than
demanding maximum reductions from both sectors.</TE>
<TE>   "These reductions in diesel emissions are absolutely essential and
should not be traded away," Waxman wrote in a letter sent Friday to
EPA Administrator Christie Whitman.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, environmentalists fear that the credit-trading
program could allow the industry to escape a tough new rule governing
diesel exhaust from highway vehicles, which the EPA adopted during
the Clinton administration and successfully defended in court last
month. That measure requires makers of heavy trucks and buses to cut
tailpipe emissions by 95% by 2007.</TE>
<TE>   "The proposed emission-trading scheme between non-road diesel
engines and diesel trucks threatens to undermine the landmark diesel
truck rule," said Frank O'Donnell of the Clean Air Trust. "Both
on-road and non-road diesel engines pose a major public health
threat, and both need to be cleaned up. One should not be traded off
for the other."</TE>
<TE>   Diesel engines used off the highways are tremendous polluters,
releasing 20 times as much soot as the latest generation of diesel
buses or trucks. They are so dirty that tractors, cranes and
steamrollers, among other equipment, produce more soot and smoke than
all the vehicles on the nation's highways, according to the EPA.</TE>
<TE>   "You can still find construction equipment dating back to the
Korean War," said Jerry Martin, spokesman for the California Air
Resources Board.</TE>
<TE>   "The emissions from these vehicles is greater than from all the
cars on the road."</TE>
<TE>   In a report to be released Monday, the nation's state and local
air quality officials conclude that cleaning up much of the 4 million
tons of pollutants released by non-road diesel engines would save
8,522 lives and result in $67 billion in health benefits annually.
The state officials have asked the EPA to pass stringent regulations.</TE>

<HD>Harvard Ponders Admission Policy</HD>
<DH>Education: The Ivy League school may begin accepting
students who break early decisions to enter other colleges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Harvard University might begin granting admission to students who
break signed commitments to other universities, an idea that's liable
to irk colleges across the country.</LD>
<LD>   New guidelines issued by a national admissions organization
prompted Harvard this year to allow students who commit to the
university during its nonbinding fall admissions round to also sign
binding early commitments at other schools.</LD>
<LD>   Before, the university prohibited its students from signing both
types of commitments.</LD>
<TE>   The change has created a vacuum in which the university does not
know which applicants may have made commitments elsewhere and may be
breaking those commitments if they eventually choose Harvard.</TE>
<TE>   In Thursday's Harvard Crimson student newspaper, two members of
the faculty committee that oversees admissions suggested that the
vacuum may be filled by allowing applicants who have accepted early
decisions elsewhere to still attend Harvard.</TE>
<TE>   Another faculty committee member, John E. Dowling, told the
Crimson that Harvard President Lawrence Summers supports the idea and
would raise the issue at a meeting of Ivy League presidents this
month.</TE>
<TE>   Dean of Admissions William Fitzsimmons said Thursday that no
long-term decisions had been made. He also denied Harvard would
change its rules to explicitly allow breaking commitments.</TE>
<TE>   He added, though, that Summers was open to discussing responses to
the "new environment" caused by the change in the National Assn. for
College Admission Counseling guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   The head of a private student counseling service criticized the
university for considering accepting students who break commitments.</TE>
<TE>   "If Harvard does this, it affects every single school," said
Michael London, president of College Coach in Newton, Mass. "They're
hurting all schools but themselves."</TE>
<TE>   More than 400 colleges allow students to apply early to their
first college choice, usually in the fall of their senior year in
high school. Such decisions are binding; Harvard also offers the
nonbinding option.</TE>
<TE>   Colleges use early decisions to determine which applicants are
most enthusiastic and to shape their class before the regular
admissions round.</TE>

<HD>Time Is Enemy of Homeland Defense Plan</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: A tight window for legislative action and myriad
turf battles threaten Bush's proposal for a new Cabinet department.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON and RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush mobilized the power of his office Friday to press for
approval of his Department of Homeland Security, but his plan faces
the twin dangers of jealousy over legislative power and a tight
congressional calendar.</LD>
<LD>   The president, bracing for titanic turf battles, met with
prominent lawmakers and then took to the people of Iowa his case for
consolidating a wide range of homeland security agencies into a
single Cabinet department.</LD>
<LD>   While Bush assigned the utmost urgency to his proposal, it was
headed toward a congressional review that is ordinarily anything but
speedy. In particular, many congressional committees could resist the
prospective loss of jurisdiction over agencies moving to the new
department.</LD>
<TE>   "There's going to be a lot of turf protection in the Congress,"
Bush said before meeting at the White House with congressional
supporters of a new department. "But I'm convinced that, by working
together, we can do what's right for America."</TE>
<TE>   A day after Bush announced his plan on national television, the
White House appealed for the same sort of unity that enabled Congress
to approve several major bills after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks,
often within weeks or even days.</TE>
<TE>   But that spirit may prove difficult to re-create nine months
later, with the November congressional elections sharpening partisan
tensions and producing stalemate or delay on a host of issues. For
example, Congress has yet to complete an emergency anti-terrorism
bill that Bush requested in March.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish we'd all been together on this last fall," Sen. Joseph I.
Lieberman (D-Conn.) told reporters after meeting with Bush to plot
legislative strategy. "We might have had it all in place by now."</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman, chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee,
is sponsoring legislation similar to what Bush has proposed. He said
he plans hearings soon on the Bush proposal and will seek to move
toward a quick floor vote. A House Government Reform subcommittee
also plans a hearing for Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Jane Harman (D-Venice), another participant in the White
House meeting, said afterward that the president had made clear he
was "open to fine-tuning" his plan. "But I don't think they're open
to doing nothing," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to be a tough battle, because we're going to be
stepping on some people's toes," Bush said at a pork exposition in
Des Moines. "You see, when you take power away from one person in
Washington, it tends to make them nervous."</TE>
<TE>   Bush said the new agency, with more than 160,000 employees and an
annual budget of more than $37 billion, would bring together security
functions now scattered throughout the government.</TE>
<TE>   The president also dispatched aides to the Capitol to lobby
lawmakers and their staffs.</TE>
<TE>   In one meeting, Bush's chief lobbyist, Nicholas Calio, and other
White House aides were peppered with questions, from whether the
postal inspection service would be part of the new Cabinet department
(it wouldn't) to whether the administration still plans to give
Congress a detailed proposal for homeland defense (it does).</TE>
<TE>   Calio predicted that lawmakers would rise to the challenge of
approving the new department by year's end. "We think the magnitude
of the task is going to help drive it toward a successful
conclusion."</TE>
<TE>   The congressional calendar is working against the plan. With
Congress hoping to be in recess in August and to adjourn in early
October for the November elections, only about three months remain on
the legislative calendar--not much time for such a complex proposal.
If the debate slides into next year, the new Congress will have to
start fresh.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of congressional committees and subcommittees oversee the
pieces of the bureaucracy that would constitute the Department of
Homeland Security, and many of them don't want to lose their
authority over those agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Even before Bush announced his plan, a tiff in the House between
the Ways and Means Committee and the Transportation and
Infrastructure Committee temporarily delayed approval of a bill to
enhance port security.</TE>
<TE>   The big loser in the reorganization would be the Transportation
Department, which would yield the Coast Guard and the new
Transportation Security Administration, which is responsible for
airport security.</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta argued that
his department was the natural place to lodge the Transportation
Security Administration. On Friday, he put the best face on his
possible loss of not only that agency but also the Coast Guard.
"Those are two major agencies, but no matter what happens we still
have a job to do," Mineta said.</TE>
<TE>   At the Justice Department, some officials said privately that they
would be glad to be rid of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, which has embarrassed its parent department by, for example,
approving student visas for two of the Sept. 11 hijackers exactly six
months after the pair steered their planes into the World Trade
Center.</TE>
<TE>   In Congress, some Democrats felt no obligation to support the
president's plan. Rep. Henry A. Waxman of Los Angeles, top Democrat
on the House Government Reform Committee, said he was perplexed that
the new agency would have no jurisdiction over intelligence.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think they've thought it through," said Waxman, a
frequent Bush critic. "We want to move as quickly as we can. But I
don't think we want to just throw something together that won't
work."</TE>
<TE>   One jurisdictional fight appeared settled when Bush said publicly
for the first time that Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge, who was
appointed to lead a White House office of modest size created in
October by executive order, would testify to Congress on the proposed
agency. Previously, Bush had refused to let Ridge testify on the
grounds that he is a presidential advisor, not an official subject to
Senate confirmation, a stance that angered congressional Democrats.</TE>

<HD>'Special Forces' Official at Okla. Bridge Operation Was
Ex-Convict</HD>
<DH>Crime: Wearing fatigues and claiming to be 'in charge,' he
allegedly got free food and lodging.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TULSA, Okla.</DL>
<LD>TULSA, Okla. -- The man wearing a green beret and camouflage fatigues
called himself Capt. William Clark from the Army's Special Forces. He
arrived two hours after an interstate bridge collapsed and said he
was in charge.</LD>
<LD>   Some emergency workers listened to him for a few days until he
disappeared. Authorities said Friday the man is an ex-convict from
Missouri who impersonated an officer to get free food, lodging and a
pickup.</LD>
<LD>   "It's just a big ego trip," said Lt. Brent Grill, a police
investigator in Van Buren, Ark., where the man is accused of not
paying for rooms he rented. "It's a fantasy of his, which becomes a
reality when he gets to play the part."</LD>
<TE>   Authorities identified the man as Billy Clark of Tallapoosa, Mo.</TE>
<TE>   Clark, 36, allegedly arrived in Webbers Falls just two hours after
the May 26 bridge collapse and told Mayor Jewell Horne he was in
charge. He handled the launch site that sent rescue boats into the
Arkansas River to where the section of the Interstate 40 bridge
collapsed, killing 14 people.</TE>
<TE>   He already knew about one victim--Army Capt. Andrew
Clements--before any bodies had been pulled from the river and asked
to look through the victim's briefcase and laptop computer, the mayor
said.</TE>
<TE>   "He kept trying to say that he was in charge," Horne said. "I
finally looked at him and said, 'No, you're not. Until the governor
declares martial law, you are not in charge in this town.' "</TE>
<TE>   Arkansas authorities in Crawford County issued an arrest warrant
Thursday for Clark on one charge of felony theft of services,
alleging that he didn't pay the $900 bill for eight rooms he rented
at a motel May 28.</TE>
<TE>   Clark told the clerk the rooms were for other rescuers and
Clements' father, and he put "Do Not Disturb" signs on seven of the
rooms, which were never occupied, Grill said.</TE>
<TE>   Police in Searcy, Ark., about 230 miles from Webbers Falls, said a
man who identified himself as a Special Forces captain went to a
dealership and said he needed a truck to transport supplies to the
bridge site. Clark left with a red pickup worth $10,600, employee
Mike Milligan said.</TE>
<TE>   Clark was released Dec. 11 from the Central Missouri Correctional
Center after serving three years for theft, said Tim Kniest,
spokesman for the Missouri Department of Corrections. Clark also
served two years of probation in 1999 for passing bad checks, Kniest
said.</TE>

<HD>Hunt for Utah Girl Unites Strangers</HD>
<DH>Crime: Despite the well-organized efforts of searchers,
three days of looking for 14-year-old Elizabeth Ann Smart have
yielded nothing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE CART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Few know the child they seek, but many knew other abducted children.
That bond has drawn disparate groups of experienced searchers Friday
to the scene of yet another tragedy, the mysterious disappearance of
14-year-old Elizabeth Ann Smart from her bedroom.</LD>
<LD>   These experts use their peculiar skill--honed at countless
searches similar to this one--to establish the grim logistics of
recovering lost children.</LD>
<LD>   "I think in our species we have an instinct to huddle around
children and help them out of trouble," said Bob Smither, who founded
the Laura Recovery Center Foundation after his 12-year-old daughter
was kidnapped and murdered four years ago in Texas. "In some ways,
these situations bring out the best in human nature."</LD>
<TE>   The Laura Foundation has taken the lead in organizing the 1,300
citizens every day who leave work or skip school to join the search,
which has so far yielded nothing after three intensive days.</TE>
<TE>   As the searchers set out again Friday to comb the foothills and
canyons near the girl's home, authorities conceded that their
investigation had stalled.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe we've gotten any leads that we could call really
solid, any at all," said police Capt. Scott Atkinson. He described
the 100 investigators as being frustrated, having gained no traction
since an intruder abducted the girl at gunpoint Wednesday. "The
longer we go without finding her, it becomes problematic."</TE>
<TE>   The Laura Foundation, which produced a handbook on conducting
missing person searches, has organized this massive manhunt by
dividing the area around the Smarts' home into grids, using global
positioning devices, and plugging every scrap of information into a
computer.</TE>
<TE>   All volunteers register and are sent out to specified areas, told
what to look for and how to tag evidence, and are debriefed after
each shift.</TE>
<TE>   The group has been called to about 500 searches, including the
hunt for 7-year-old Danielle van Dam of San Diego, who was found
killed. But Smither said that, even with the compassion that usually
drives people to join searches for children, what's happening here is
unusual.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just amazing," he said Friday, surveying the grounds of a
hospital and the teeming tent city that sprung up as a staging area.
Every imaginable commodity had been donated to aid the search:
batteries, caps, sunscreen, water, fanny packs, cargo trucks and
enough food to feed the gathering throng many times over.</TE>
<TE>   "We make a phone call and suddenly 20,000 fliers are printed and
delivered," said Connie Flukey, marveling at the growing wall of
boxes nearby, built with unidentified but constantly arriving donated
goods.</TE>
<TE>   Flukey drove from Grand Junction, Colo., with three neighbors.
They are part of the Abby and Jennifer Recovery Foundation, which was
established this spring after the disappearance of a mother and
daughter in November.</TE>
<TE>   The Laura Foundation organized the Grand Junction search, and
Flukey's group is its legacy.</TE>
<TE>   "It just keeps going," said the mother of five, adjusting a
walkie-talkie and clutching a cell phone while directing volunteers.
"They helped us, we will help the next community when something like
this happens. Then they will form a group and help. I won't stop
until every state has a recovery center."</TE>
<TE>   Strongest Lead Fizzled</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, what few leads authorities had did little more
than raise hopes momentarily. The case's strongest lead was the
sighting of a man fitting the kidnapper's description in a heavily
wooded canyon late Thursday. An all-night search led by a
back-country SWAT team, tracking dogs and an infrared-equipped
helicopter found nothing.</TE>
<TE>   The sheriff's department said the volunteer searchers who made the
report may have seen a transient who is known to live in Emigration
Canyon. The search was abandoned Friday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   One tip police pursued came from the Smart family's milkman, who
said he saw a suspicious vehicle in the neighborhood. The milkman
gave police a license plate number, but it didn't match any known
plate.</TE>
<TE>   The round-the-clock investigation and search have frazzled the
nerves of many in this tight-knit community. Edward Smart, the girl's
father, was hospitalized Friday for exhaustion.</TE>
<TE>   Later, the Smart family put out a call for pilots, planes and
spotters, and said they were launching an air search today, a day
after Elizabeth Smart was to have graduated from eighth grade.</TE>

<HD>Strict Return of Bowel Drug Lotronex Approved by FDA</HD>
<DH>Health: Despite reports of deaths, the agency allows the
use of the medication, in limited cases, for women with severe
disorders.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Food and Drug Administration approved the limited return Friday
of a bowel disorder drug that was pulled after evidence emerged that
many people taking it developed serious and sometimes fatal ailments.</LD>
<LD>   The drug, Lotronex, will be approved only for women with severe,
diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome who have not responded
to traditional therapy.</LD>
<LD>   The drug was pulled by its manufacturer, GlaxoSmithKline, in
November 2000, eight months after it was approved.</LD>
<TE>   As of March, the FDA said, it had been told of 84 cases of
ischemic colitis and 113 cases of serious complications of
constipation in people taking Lotronex. Scores of people were
hospitalized, and two cases of each kind of ailment were fatal, the
FDA said.</TE>
<TE>   "All drugs have risks," said Lester M. Crawford, the FDA's deputy
commissioner. "It's FDA's job to balance the need for access to
effective medications with those risks."</TE>
<TE>   The FDA brought back the pill after an outpouring of requests from
patients who found relief from the symptoms of the common bowel
problem, which causes pronounced abdominal bloating and pain and
other vexing inconveniences, such as the need to go to the bathroom
on a moment's notice.</TE>
<TE>   GlaxoSmithKline has developed a program to guide doctors and will
ask pharmacists to fill only those prescriptions with stickers
indicating a doctor has participated in the program. Patients will be
asked to read and sign a document explaining the risks of the pill.</TE>
<TE>   "Informed decision-making by physicians and patients is critically
important in managing the risks of marketed medications," said Dr.
Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and
Research.</TE>
<TE>   Lotronex's on-again, off-again history reflects the delicate
balance the FDA must reach in handling drugs with demonstrated lethal
risk and relatively modest proven benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Lotronex was one of 11 prescription drugs withdrawn for safety
reasons in the four years ending in May of last year. Eight of those
drugs were approved from 1993 through 2000, an era when the FDA was
under pressure from members of Congress and the White House to become
more of a partner than an adversary of the $100-billion
pharmaceutical industry. Aside from one antibiotic pill, none of the
11 withdrawn drugs was a proven lifesaver.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of Lotronex accused the FDA of making an irresponsible
decision that will recklessly endanger patients.</TE>
<TE>   "This drug is very, very dangerous," said Dr. Sidney Wolfe of the
consumer group Public Citizen. "I don't know of any other drug put on
the market with a more frequent risk of such a life-threatening
illness.</TE>
<TE>   Wolfe pointed to FDA data that showed the medicine at the dose
suggested by the FDA does not have a statistically better result than
placebos. The benefits of the treatment, he said, do not come close
to justifying the risks of serious side effects, which could result
in surgery, colectomy and death.</TE>
<TE>   "If this were a drug to treat cancer or a life-threatening
illness, it might be worth taking the risk," Wolfe said.</TE>
<TE>   FDA officials, however, said that they targeted the approval to
those whose symptoms are most severe. The goal was "to steer the use
of the drug to patients who are most likely to get the most benefit
of the drug, patients who might be willing to accept more risk," said
Victor Raczkowski, acting director of FDA's division of
gastrointestinal and coagulation drug products.</TE>
<TE>   Illness has severely disrupted the social and work lives of many
of the patients who will qualify for the drug, Raczkowski added.</TE>
<TE>   The drug company calculates that there are 185,000 women
nationwide who could qualify for this drug.</TE>
<TE>   About 15% to 20% of patients who try the drug find some relief,
according to the FDA.</TE>

<HD>Judge Likely to Let Moussaoui Represent Self</HD>
<DH>Courts: Prosecutors say the suspected accomplice in the
Sept. 11 attacks is mentally competent.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Zacarias Moussaoui, charged with conspiracy in the
Sept. 11 attacks, is mentally competent to represent himself in his
upcoming trial, federal prosecutors said Friday, citing a
court-appointed psychiatrist's findings.</LD>
<LD>   Without objection from the Justice Department, U.S. District Judge
Leonie Brinkema is expected to approve Moussaoui's request at a
hearing Thursday in Alexandria, Va., and allow him to fire his
court-appointed lawyers and represent himself. Moussaoui, 34, faces
the death penalty if convicted in the case, which is set for trial
this year.</LD>
<LD>   Such a ruling, however, could throw the already high-profile case
into turmoil and allow Moussaoui, who has no legal training, to use
the courtroom as a platform to voice his extreme anti-American views,
as he did at a hearing in April, legal experts said.</LD>
<TE>   "Under the current legal standard, you basically have to be
chewing the rug to be found incompetent to represent yourself," said
Jonathan Turley, a constitutional law professor at George Washington
University. "And while Moussaoui appears to be extreme, unhinged and
unpredictable, he also appears to be competent under the government's
standards.</TE>
<TE>   "For the judge and the prosecution, there was no good option,"
Turley added. "He could be found incompetent [to represent himself]
and thus incompetent to stand trial, or they find him competent and
he could turn the trial into a circus."</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui has indicated that he intends to do just that. The
French militant of Moroccan descent shocked a packed courtroom two
months ago when he rose and gave a nearly hourlong diatribe, calling
for the destruction of the United States, Jews everywhere and the
"Jewish state."</TE>
<TE>   At that hearing, Brinkema ordered a psychiatric evaluation of
Moussaoui, in part because he claimed his court-appointed lawyers,
along with the government and the judge, were part of a conspiracy to
kill him.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, federal prosecutors said the court-appointed
psychiatrist had a two-hour interview with Moussaoui recently and
concluded that he did not appear to have a "major mental disease or
defect."</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui was arrested in mid-August after officials at a
Minnesota flight school called the FBI and said he was acting
suspiciously. He was indicted in December and charged with conspiring
with Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda network to carry out the
attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon along with 19
hijackers.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. authorities have said Moussaoui was intended to be the 20th
hijacker; his defense lawyers say he never had any contact with any
of the hijackers.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Dunham Jr., Moussaoui's chief public defender, said Friday
that he will ask the judge next week to delay a decision on
Moussaoui's competence until he can be evaluated more thoroughly. And
if Brinkema does allow Moussaoui to represent himself, Dunham said,
she should at least relax some of the restrictions proposed Friday by
the Justice Department and allow his legal team to remain as standby
counsel.</TE>
<TE>   In their motion, the prosecutors said Moussaoui should not be
allowed to see any classified documents that include much of the
evidence against him. They also argued that his access to a telephone
to interview prospective witnesses and to research materials should
be restricted.</TE>
<TE>   "Clarence Darrow couldn't defend himself under these
restrictions," Dunham said.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Dunham acknowledged, "everybody is concerned about
what he is going to try and do if he is allowed to represent
himself."</TE>
<TE>   Dunham noted that the government wants to put a stun belt on
Moussaoui during the trial. In their Friday filing, prosecutors said
a stun belt "may be required to protect both the dignity of the court
proceedings in this case and the nation's security." The final
decision rests with the judge.</TE>
<TE>   If Moussaoui is allowed to represent himself, he will essentially
be in control of the courtroom much of the time.</TE>
<TE>   Under federal law, Moussaoui would be allowed to call whomever he
wants as witnesses and question them, and to cross-examine any
witnesses the government calls to testify against him. And he will be
able to give opening and closing arguments, and say whatever he wants
for as long as he wants, Turley and other constitutional law experts
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure what other options there are" for Brinkema and
prosecutors, said Laurie Levenson, a constitutional law professor at
Loyola Law School and a former federal prosecutor. She said
Moussaoui's public defenders have a good chance of at least sparing
his life by raising questions about the lack of definitive
connections between him and the hijackers, particularly since he was
in custody on Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "But his goal here seems to be to use this trial as a forum to get
his anti-American message out," Levenson said. "It may cost him his
life to do so."</TE>

<HD>Pataki Proposes Reforms for Strict N.Y. Drug Laws</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ALBANY, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>Gov. George Pataki released proposals Friday to change
three-decade-old drug laws to allow more addicts to get treatment and
to relax some mandatory sentences.</LD>
<LD>   Pataki said in January that he wanted to ease the state's drug
laws, calling them outdated and saying they didn't address the
complexities of addiction.</LD>
<LD>   The state's drug laws are among the nation's harshest and can
bring mandatory life sentences for possession of relatively small
amounts. In the 1970s, Gov. Nelson Rockefeller insisted on their
adoption, when drugs plagued the cities.</LD>
<TE>   Pataki's proposals were developed after discussions with
prosecutors, prison reform advocates and others, said Chauncey
Parker, his criminal justice services coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   "We talked with many different people in an effort to truly reach
compromise," Parker said Friday. Draft legislation was sent to
Assembly members, the governor's office said.</TE>
<TE>   The plan would expand categories of offenders who could be
referred for drug treatment, give more leeway to judges when
sentencing nonviolent offenders and reduce sentences in some cases.</TE>
<TE>   Major traffickers or violent offenders would not be eligible for
treatment and could get longer sentences.</TE>
<TE>   The Republican-controlled state Senate endorsed Pataki's proposal
as balancing the need for treatment of addicts with tougher penalties
for hardened criminals.</TE>
<TE>   An Assembly proposal backed by Democrats gives judges more
sentencing discretion than the governor favors and would lessen the
power of prosecutors to block addiction treatment for certain
defendants.</TE>

<DL>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Space shuttle Endeavour delivered a new crew to the international
space station Friday to relieve the three men who have been living
aboard the orbiting outpost for six months.</LD>
<LD>   Space station astronaut Daniel Bursch was so excited to see his
ride home that he rang the ship's bell and announced the shuttle's
arrival seven minutes early. His crewmate Carl Walz jumped ahead in
the hatch-opening procedures but had to wait.</LD>
<LD>   Bursch, Walz and Yuri Onufrienko, their Russian commander, moved
into the space station in early December and did not expect to stay
so long. Robot-arm problems at the station and then shuttle launching
delays added more than a month to their stint in orbit.</LD>
<TE>   Replacing them aboard the space station are two Russians and one
American, astronaut-biochemist Peggy Whitson, only the second woman
to settle in.</TE>
<TE>   Endeavour will remain at the space station for eight days, during
which the shuttle astronauts will conduct three spacewalks, one of
them to fix the wrist on the space station's robot arm.</TE>
<TE>   When Bursch, Walz and Onufrienko return to Earth aboard Endeavour
on June 17, they will have spent 194 days in space, a U.S. record.</TE>

<HD>Skakel Is Found Guilty of 1975 Moxley Murder</HD>
<DH>Verdict: The trial of the Kennedy cousin in the girl's
slaying turned on circumstantial evidence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NORWALK, Conn.</DL>
<LD>A jury on Friday found Kennedy cousin Michael Skakel guilty of
murdering neighbor Martha Moxley with a golf club nearly 27 years
ago, in a case that relied on circumstantial evidence and reported
confessions.</LD>
<LD>   There were no eyewitnesses and no direct physical evidence linking
the 41-year-old Skakel to the slaying. He looked surprised, and
spectators gasped, when the verdict was announced. Skakel began to
shake when the panel was polled and each juror pronounced him guilty.</LD>
<LD>   Moxley's mother, Dorthy, and brother John--both of whom had
testified during the more than three-week-long trial--sat in the
front row of the courtroom, hugging and weeping.</LD>
<TE>   After the verdict, which came after three days of deliberations,
Superior Court Judge John F. Kavanewsky denied Skakel's request to
speak. His lawyer said later that he had wanted to proclaim his
innocence.</TE>
<TE>   "I am so blessed and so overwhelmed.... This is truly Martha's
day," Moxley's mother said with a huge smile. But, her brother added,
"Victory doesn't bring Martha back."</TE>
<TE>   Skakel, a nephew of Ethel Kennedy's, was handcuffed and taken to a
correctional institute in Suffield, Conn. He faces 10 years to life
in prison when his sentence is imposed July 19.</TE>
<TE>   John Moxley suggested a sentence that "builds upon 27 years and
goes up."</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyer Michael Sherman called the jury's decision against
Skakel--who like Moxley was 15 at the time of the attack--"the most
upsetting verdict I ever had in my life." He said he would appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not over. I believe Michael Skakel. He did not do it,"
Sherman said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice to say once in a while that justice delayed doesn't
have to mean justice denied," countered prosecutor Jonathan Benedict.</TE>
<TE>   Moxley's battered body was found beneath a pine tree on her
family's Greenwich, Conn., estate Oct. 31, 1975.</TE>
<TE>   The attack was so violent the 6-iron used to beat her to death had
shattered. The club was traced to a set owned by Skakel's mother.</TE>
<TE>   The Skakels and Moxleys were neighbors in the exclusive, gated
Belle Haven waterfront enclave. The infamous case became the subject
of books by Dominick Dunne, ex-Los Angeles police detective Mark
Fuhrman and journalist Tim Dumas. Dunne and Fuhrman attended the
trial regularly.</TE>
<TE>   Norwalk's small, redbrick courthouse was crowded with
representatives of 70 news organizations, and the rear parking lot
became a tent city of temporary television studios.</TE>
<TE>   The case--which depended completely on circumstantial
evidence--rested on simple assumptions of sibling rivalry and
jealousy: that Skakel murdered the pretty and popular high school
student because she discouraged his advances while flirting with
Thomas, his older brother.</TE>
<TE>   At the core of the prosecution's case were two confessions Skakel
allegedly made in the late 1970s while attending a school for
troubled youths in Poland Spring, Maine.</TE>
<TE>   John D. Higgins, a classmate at the Elan School, told the jury
that Skakel had sobbed while hazily remembering the night of Moxley's
murder.</TE>
<TE>   Higgins said Skakel told him that a party had occurred at his
house and that "he later was in his garage and he was going through
some golf clubs. And he related that he was running through some
woods, he had a golf club in his hands, he looked up, he saw pine
trees. The next thing that he remembers is that he woke up in his
house."</TE>
<TE>   Higgins said Skakel made an escalating series of statements that
led to a confession.</TE>
<TE>   "He said that he didn't know whether he did it; he said that he
may have done it, he didn't know what happened. Eventually he came to
the point that he did do it, he must have done it. I did it," Higgins
told the court.</TE>
<TE>   Testimony also was introduced from Gregory Coleman, who told a
grand jury in 1998 and a probable cause hearing in 2001 that Skakel
in 1978 explained that he killed Moxley because she "spurned his
advances."</TE>
<TE>   "I am going to get away with murder. I am a Kennedy," Coleman
quoted Skakel as saying.</TE>
<TE>   Coleman died from an overdose of heroin last year. He admitted
that he had used the drug shortly before his grand jury testimony.</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Pease, a classmate at the Elan School, said Coleman told
her that Skakel had talked about killing a girl.</TE>
<TE>   "He said that he had beaten some girl's head in with a golf club
and killed her," Pease testified.</TE>
<TE>   Skakel did not appear as a witness during the trial.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers contended that he was miles away at a cousin's
house when Moxley was killed. They also sought to cast doubt on a
former family tutor and pointed out that the tutor and Thomas Skakel
were early suspects in the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   James Dowdle told the court that Skakel had watched television at
his home with a group of friends and didn't leave until 10:50 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Joseph A. Jachimczyk, a forensic pathologist called by the
defense, testified that Moxley had died about 10 p.m.--when Skakel
supposedly was at his cousin's home.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said the precise time of Moxley's death could not be
determined--it could be between 9:30 p.m. on Oct. 30 and 5 a.m. on
Oct. 31--and argued that Skakel could have committed the killing
after returning to Belle Haven.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for Skakel claimed he went straight to bed after returning
from his cousin's.</TE>
<TE>   But Andrea Shakespeare Renner, a friend of Skakel's sister Julie,
told the court she was sure that Skakel remained at home while others
left for his cousin's house.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors also placed in evidence portions of a tape in which
Skakel told a ghostwriter of a book he was planning that he had
panicked when Dorthy Moxley knocked on the door of the Skakel home
Halloween morning, looking for her daughter.</TE>
<TE>   "How could the sight of Dorthy Moxley create panic in an innocent
person?" Benedict asked in closing arguments. "Only a person seeing
that poor girl under the tree could create panic."</TE>

<LD>The Bush administration has approved $305 million in grants to draw
housing-seekers to the World Trade Center area and keep current
residents from moving, officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The grant program has drawn criticism from some groups for
funneling money to residents of a neighborhood where nearly 90% of
households earn more than $60,000 a year. Such housing grants usually
are restricted to low- and more moderate-income brackets.</LD>

<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Having stayed away for the last month, I see no reason to jump on War
Emblem's bandwagon now.</LD>
<LD>   There are some, who after tearing up Kentucky Derby future book
tickets on Sunday Break, Johannesburg, the distance-challenged Came
Home and assorted others, believe War Emblem is a slam dunk in the
Belmont.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, that same song was sung about Silver Charm, Real Quiet
and Charismatic in 1997, '98 and '99, and all those colts fell short
in their quests to join Affirmed, Seattle Slew, Secretariat and eight
other legendary thoroughbreds as Triple Crown winners.</LD>
<TE>   Those exuding confidence, among them trainer Bob Baffert, who has
developed and nurtured War Emblem for about two months, seem to
believe a Triple Crown winner will be a magic elixir for a sport with
problems. Such an occurrence may indeed provide a short-term boost.</TE>
<TE>   But depending on what happens tonight between Lennox Lewis and
Mike Tyson in Memphis and whether Barry Bonds goes home run crazy
against New York in Yankee Stadium, a historic Belmont victory by War
Emblem may not be the lead story on any television sportscast
tonight, or the top headline on any sports page Sunday morning.</TE>
<TE>   Along with the 10 other 3-year-olds in the field, bettors
searching for a price will be trying to beat War Emblem, who will
probably be even money or less.</TE>
<TE>   Having failed with Private Emblem in the Derby--at least I had the
Emblem part right--and Medaglia d'Oro in the Preakness, Perfect Drift
is my Belmont choice.</TE>
<TE>   A gelded son of Dynaformer, Perfect Drift skipped the Preakness
after finishing third at Churchill Downs.</TE>
<TE>   Perfect Drift was taken out of his game a bit in the Derby,
running closer to the pace than expected.</TE>
<TE>   Given that War Emblem probably will be kept busy up front by the
improving Wiseman's Ferry, who won't go away as easily as Menacing
Dennis in the Preakness, and the 1 1/2-mile distance, Perfect Drift
and jockey Eddie Delahoussaye could get the ideal scenario for
springing the surprise from off the pace.</TE>
<TE>   Perfect Drift's workouts have been solid and maybe he can become
another Triple Crown spoiler on a list that includes, since 1979,
Coastal, Summing, Bet Twice, Easy Goer, Touch Gold, Victory Gallop
and Lemon Drop Kid.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday Break, who wasn't able to run in the Derby because of
insufficient graded stakes earnings and who missed the Preakness
because trainer Neil Drysdale wanted to, could be the second betting
choice.</TE>
<TE>   Thus far, his hype has exceeded his performance. His victory
against suspect opposition in the Peter Pan on May 25 was his first
in a graded stakes. In his only other appearance in a Grade I, Sunday
Break finished third in the Wood Memorial at Aqueduct. He was beaten
by only half a length, but should not have missed with the trip he
had and, in hindsight, the Wood was probably overrated as a Kentucky
Derby prep.</TE>
<TE>   Proud Citizen has been solid in the first two legs of the Triple
Crown, finishing second in the Derby and third in the Preakness, and
he probably won't be far away today.</TE>
<TE>   He and Sunday Break are the only two horses in the field who have
won at Belmont Park.</TE>
<TE>   The feeling is that Magic Weisner, the surprise runner-up in the
Preakness at 45-1, won't be the same outside of Maryland--all his
races have been run at Pimlico or Laurel--and the others, except,
perhaps, Essence Of Dubai, look like pretenders.</TE>
<TE>   Hindered by the lack of pace in the Kentucky Derby, Essence Of
Dubai never fired, but he should get fractions to run at in the
Belmont, he has a new jockey in Jerry Bailey, the country's leading
rider, and gives every indication he will handle 12 furlongs. That
can't be said for many in the field.</TE>

<HD>A Breeding Ground for Resentment</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: A Saudi prince's roots and money have
inspired grumbling that will only increase if his horse wins the
Triple Crown today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID WHARTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The sport of thoroughbred racing clings to a romantic notion about
the kind of horse that wins the Triple Crown--and the kind of man who
owns that horse. The archetypal owner patiently breeds his stock,
preferably on a Kentucky farm, waiting for a magical foal. Or he
spots a gifted yearling at auction and nurtures it to glory.</LD>
<LD>   This vision does not apply to Prince Ahmed bin Salman and his
prized possession, War Emblem, who now stand on the brink of racing's
rarest feat.</LD>
<LD>   The Saudi prince is one of several Middle Eastern royals who have
risen to the top of the American scene by spending hundreds of
millions of dollars to buy the best horses. His farm is in Southern
California, not bluegrass country. He purchased War Emblem less than
two months ago.</LD>
<TE>   So the grumbling began shortly after the jet-black colt won the
Kentucky Derby last month and grew louder with a subsequent victory
at the Preakness. Critics bridle at the idea that, in their minds,
Bin Salman will have bought his way to the first Triple Crown in
nearly a quarter century, and only the 12th ever, with a victory
today in the Belmont Stakes.</TE>
<TE>   But there is another aspect to the controversy.</TE>
<TE>   For all the millions spent, the prince is the first Arab to field
a Derby winner and tempt history. While he is said to be ecstatic
these days--"like a little kid," according to a friend--Bin Salman
must also contend with the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   People within the sport wonder if fans are rooting against him.
Jimmy Breslin, the famed columnist, has urged him to stay away from
the Belmont in Elmont, N.Y., and other newspaper stories have made
references to high gas prices and the fact that most of the hijackers
held Saudi passports.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't surprise me," said B. Wayne Hughes, a friend and
fellow owner. "Look, we're in difficult times right now. The Middle
East is on everyone's mind and he's from the Middle East."</TE>
<TE>   The 43-year-old prince, elegant with a clipped mustache and pocket
handkerchief, has calmly insisted that he is a businessman, not a
politician. But he did not respond to interview requests for this
story, and the situation clearly rankles those close to him.</TE>
<TE>   They describe someone of unexpected exuberance who wraps friends
in big embraces, lifting them off the ground after a victory. They
speak of his penchant for laughter and passion for horses.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel bad for him that this even has to be a topic," said Gary
Stevens, one of his favorite jockeys. His trainer, Bob Baffert, no
stranger to controversy, reacted abruptly when asked to describe the
prince.</TE>
<TE>   "He's very pro-American," Baffert said. "That's all I can say."</TE>
<TE>   Arabs have been a small but influential presence in United States
racing since 1980 when sheiks from the royal family of Dubai began
attending the Keeneland horse sales in Lexington, Ky. In the last
three years, Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid has spent $126 million at
Keeneland, and his brother, Sheik Hamdan bin Zayed, $70 million. The
most active North American owners spent $30 million to $48 million.</TE>
<TE>   "There are mixed feelings about this," said Jason Levin, a
journalist who chronicled the brothers in his book "From the Desert
to the Derby." The industry "is happy to have these guys spend all
this money at the sales, but the old-line Kentuckians and the
breeders would rather not see them come back and win the big races."</TE>
<TE>   Though Bin Salman is a heavy hitter, he ranks below the Dubai
sheiks with $30 million in Keeneland purchases since 1999. And his
arrival to racing was less splashy.</TE>
<TE>   As a young man studying comparative culture at UC Irvine in the
early 1980s--and not telling anyone he was royalty--he called on a
local trainer named Richard Mulhall and began to build a modest
stable, or what passes for modest in this sport.</TE>
<TE>   "We never paid more than $30,000 for a horse," Mulhall recalled.
"A lot of cheap claimers. Just for the fun of it."</TE>
<TE>   Over the next decade, the prince dabbled in racing, drifted away,
then called Mulhall to say he was "really bored and wanted back."
This time he was serious, hiring the trainer to manage a
well-appointed farm near the Santa Anita racetrack in Arcadia and
forming the Thoroughbred Corp. with an eye toward spending.</TE>
<TE>   At a 1996 auction, Bin Salman noticed an unraced filly named Sharp
Cat and asked the advice of prominent trainer D. Wayne Lukas, who
liked the horse but warned, "She's not going to be cheap." Bin Salman
bought her for $900,000, a record sum for a 2-year-old filly. By
1998, Sharp Cat had won $2 million in purses. "That was his first
[love]," Stevens said. "He really got attached to her."</TE>
<TE>   As Thoroughbred Corp. acquired one pricey horse after another,
Hughes recalled telling the prince: "You push all us Americans around
with your money and ruin the sale for the rest of us." It wasn't
criticism, just a friendly jab. Bin Salman later announced that his
wife wanted to meet Hughes.</TE>
<TE>   "Why?" the American asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Because no one has ever spoken to me like that," the prince
replied.</TE>
<TE>   A circle of friends came to know him for more than his wealth and
entourage of assistants. They saw his post-time nerves, his catalog
of superstitions.</TE>
<TE>   He once gave a pre-race interview at Churchill Downs, after which
his horse ran badly. No more pre-race interviews. He avoided having
his picture taken in the paddock, his security men politely shooing
photographers away. "The closer we get to the races, the more
superstitious I will become," he told The Times in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   These quirks were matched by substance, a growing knowledge of
pedigree and confirmation.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not interested in making money per se," trainer Wally
Dollase said. "He loves the challenge of coming up with a good
racehorse."</TE>
<TE>   Dollase admires this competitiveness, but has also felt its sting.
He was Thoroughbred Corp.'s private trainer until 1999 when he was
dumped over "a difference in philosophy."</TE>
<TE>   Others have suffered a similar fate. Of Bin Salman and Mulhall,
Dollase said: "You'd better watch out with these guys because they
can turn on you fast." He mentions last year when his former boss had
a colt, Point Given, that won the final two legs of the Triple Crown
but lost in the Kentucky Derby. The disappointment made Bin Salman
all the more determined to run at Churchill Downs this spring.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to understand this is a very successful man," Dollase
said. "He is used to getting his way."</TE>
<TE>   In Saudi royalty, a labyrinth of thousands of princes and
princesses, Bin Salman holds a relatively privileged position. His
father is among the "Sudeiri seven" brothers who include the ailing
King Fahd, and his half-uncle is Crown Prince Abdullah.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very classy branch of the family," said Richard H.
Dekmejian, a political science professor at USC. "Very highly
educated, very influential."</TE>
<TE>   Never politically inclined, the prince spent the early 1990s
establishing himself as chairman of Saudi Research &amp; Marketing Ltd.,
which controls 18 publications worldwide including a London-based
daily that ranks among the world's most prominent Arabic newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   Asharq Al-Awsat has published numerous pro-American articles since
Sept. 11 and is considered more balanced than its competitors, said
Yigal Carmon, president of the Middle East Media Research Institute
in Washington. At the same time, one of its columnists suggested that
President Bush orchestrated the hijackings, and the paper has run
threats against the U.S. that allegedly came from Al Qaeda and
Taliban leaders.</TE>
<TE>   "There is not as much of the hate you see in papers that are
published in Saudi Arabia," Carmon said. "Not that you don't find
craziness in there sometimes."</TE>
<TE>   As for Bin Salman's father, Prince Salman bin Abdul Aziz is
governor of Riyadh, the Saudi capital, and a powerful figure in Saudi
politics. He is also a man whose name has appeared in news reports on
terrorism, though in contradictory ways.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Osama bin Laden told ABC that Bin Abdul Aziz had put a
bounty on his head. Yet last fall, international peacekeeping troops
came to suspect that a Sarajevo charity founded by Bin Abdul Aziz had
terrorist connections. Cash, documents and computers were seized
during a September raid of the Saudi High Commission for Relief. The
charity denied wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Dekmejian, who met Bin Abdul Aziz during a 1998 research trip,
does not believe the governor is associated with terrorism. "It would
be surprising to me, having observed Saudi politics for a long time,"
the USC professor said.</TE>
<TE>   At the Kentucky Derby, reporters asked Bin Salman in vague terms
about U.S. concerns that Saudi Arabia is funding terrorists. He
replied: "I leave it up to our politicians and your politicians." The
complaining began soon after.</TE>
<TE>   Not that anyone within the sport was blatant. No owner or breeder
wants to jeopardize a future million-dollar sale to the prince.
Trainers might not like his tactics, but they agree with Dollase, who
said, "I just wish I had access to his horses."</TE>
<TE>   Another veteran trainer, John Ward Jr., offered a typical comment.
"I'm going to be very diplomatic about this," he said. "But I will
have to say that on Derby day, there didn't seem to be the emotional
outburst post-race that there is sometimes."</TE>
<TE>   The prince did not help his cause by employing the outspoken
Baffert--who has made enemies with confidence bordering on arrogance.
Nor did Bin Salman mollify critics with his glib response to
questions about buying a Derby victory.</TE>
<TE>   "If you tell me next year who is going to win it," the prince
said, "I'll buy it again."</TE>
<TE>   A subsequent column in USA Today referred to his "fast money" and
stated: "The little guys lose, the big guys win." It also mentioned
George Steinbrenner, the New York Yankee owner known for stocking his
team with pricey free agents. An Associated Press column wondered how
Bin Salman will be received in New York, "the city affected most
deeply by the terrorist attacks."</TE>
<TE>   Breslin, of Newsday, went even farther: "It is understood that
these Saudis won't have the class of a goat. If this Bin Salman had
any, he would stay away and not run his horse out of respect."</TE>
<TE>   The owners of Proud Citizen--another horse running today--have
said they will donate any earnings from the race to the Twin Towers
Fund, which some see as an attempt to position the horse as a fan
favorite over War Emblem.</TE>
<TE>   It is ironic that circumstances have cast the prince as an
interloper. Arabs have bred swift, strong horses since the time of
Muhammad, long before Spaniards reintroduced the animal to North
America, where it had been extinct for thousands of years. Of the
three breeds combined to make what we now call thoroughbreds, two
were Arabians.</TE>
<TE>   Critics have ignored that Bin Salman has bred horses in the U.S.
and Saudi Arabia and purchased yearlings all along. By paying
$900,000 for 90% interest in War Emblem, he took a chance on a colt
that had knee and ankle problems. At least one rival wondered if he
is so different from other owners.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't we all spend money?" owner Bob Lewis asked. "Whether we
have a homebred or we buy a yearling ... any way you slice it, we're
going to pay."</TE>
<TE>   Yet Levin and others suggest that the controversy has attained
critical mass. They say Bin Salman receives undue criticism for his
spending because he is Arab and, at the same time, his nationality is
more of an issue because of his wealth.</TE>
<TE>   Last winter, Baffert reportedly took it as a slight when the
prince was passed over for the prestigious Eclipse Award as owner of
the year, though Point Given, with two of three Triple Crown
victories, was voted best three-year-old. Bin Salman was poised:
Accepting on behalf of the horse, he acknowledged his wife, then
slyly informed the audience that he had only one.</TE>
<TE>   Such jokes suggest he is mindful of his predicament. Unlike the
Dubai sheiks, who attend races infrequently, he is a regular at the
track, dealing with jockeys on a casual basis. Mulhall calls him
"very Americanized ... he does things a lot like Americans do."</TE>
<TE>   Months before Bin Salman's rivals pledged their donation, he
donated $125,000--equal to one of Point Given's breeding seasons--to
the New York Heroes Fund. When War Emblem won the Preakness, he said:
"I enjoy racing in America. I lived here for 10 years."</TE>
<TE>   Then he quipped: "To be honest, sometimes I get embarrassed. So
many people asking for autographs and pictures. I think I am getting
a little more popular than President Bush."</TE>
<TE>   Short of further comments--the prince plans to arrive late at
Belmont to avoid reporters--his defense has been left to people such
as Stevens, who said: "I've seen jealousy in a lot of different
instances in my 23 years as a jockey. If they're not talking about
you, you're not doing any good."</TE>
