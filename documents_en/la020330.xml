<DH>The late Eazy-E, a dropout and petty criminal, was also a
savvy musician and businessman. His widow is selling a tribute
package that includes unreleased music and a documentary.</DH>

<AU>DONNELL ALEXANDER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eric "Eazy-E" Wright came from Compton, stood 5-foot-2 and had a
Jheri curl. The Dominguez High dropout was a hustler who believed
half of what he saw, some of what he heard. He was an autodidact and
a petty criminal, and he brought street smarts to the mainstream like
few before or since.</LD>
<LD>   Eazy-E was crack-era Southern California's Selena, arguably the
most purely gutter black man ever to sell tens of millions of
records, and a real-time hero.</LD>
<LD>   Prior to his classic 1988 single "Boyz-N-the-Hood," it was unusual
to see sagging denim pants on non-incarcerated teenage boys. In 1995,
six years after his group N.W.A's independently financed and
distributed album "Straight Outta Compton" remade not only rap music
but also a number of industries surrounding it, the musician and
businessman died at age 31 of AIDS-related illness.</LD>
<TE>   "Eric did know the streets and he did have game. His game was
being real," says Tomika Woods-Wright, chief executive of Ruthless
Records and the rapper's widow. "He showed that there are so many
different ways to get to that point everyone is trying to get to."</TE>
<TE>   Success through street knowledge. That was his mantra, and
marketing people now attest to this path's power. By demonstrating
the importance of owning your own label, Eazy-E was an inspiration
for such record companies as Death Row, Rap-A-Lot, Bad Boy and No
Limit. His influence is reflected in the mainstream success of
Jay-Z's Roc-a-Fella label and New Orleans' Cash Money Clique, as well
as offshoots that extend into textiles, new media and real estate.</TE>
<TE>   "In Eazy-E, people like Master P saw somebody who was like them,
who made the blueprint," says Frank Williams, editor-at-large for The
Source magazine. KRS-One, Ice-T and Schoolly D, among others, had
explored "gangsta" hip-hop textures before E, but it was the Compton
kid who indelibly branded his approach. Says Williams, "Ruthless was
a seminal moment in black music."</TE>
<TE>   Despite all this, Eazy-E remains little known outside the
hard-core rap world. His widow hopes to change that.</TE>
<TE>   Ruthless, which Eazy-E founded with music industry veteran Jerry
Heller, marked the seventh anniversary of the rapper's death this
week by releasing a DVD/CD package called "The Impact of a Legend."
The collection, which includes an EP of previously unreleased music,
video clips and a computer game set in many of Eazy-E's stamping
grounds, attempts to make his legacy tangible.</TE>
<TE>   It's a complicated mission. In technical terms, Eazy-E was far
from accomplished as an MC. He famously did not pen his own material.
What he did do was assemble a team of brilliant writers, rappers and
producers, including Dr. Dre and Ice Cube, that, as N.W.A, helped
bring to life the sounds and street images in his imagination. It was
a team that altered pop culture as dramatically as Elvis and Chuck
Berry had.</TE>
<TE>   Eazy-E's own raps added a devilish yet appealing presence that
gave the music an extra dimension. If hip-hop's unwritten subtext is
about lifting society up from the bottom, his career can't be
anything less than emblematic of that ethos.</TE>
<TE>   The son of blue-collar parents, Eazy-E got started in music by
putting on house parties with a younger neighbor, Andre Young, who
worked as a DJ and called himself Dr. Dre. The cash he hustled from
the streets (something he boasted about, but never defined) at first
went into showy investments, such as clothes. Then Dre asked him,
along with the producer Laylaw, to help finance the recording of a
few rap songs. When the scheduled vocalists fell through, the money
man became an unlikely MC, according to Dr. Dre.</TE>
<TE>   It took six days for Eazy-E, who was, in Ice Cube's words,
"straight amateur," to record the Ice Cube-penned "Boyz-N-the-Hood."
First through street tapes, the song became a hit. Dre produced a
"clean," vinyl version of the song for L.A. radio station KDAY, which
brought an even larger audience.</TE>
<TE>   Woods-Wright, a self-described "educated 'hood rat," was a student
at Birmingham High School in Van Nuys when she first heard an Eazy-E
record. No way could she know one day that she would document his
career as carefully as a curator.</TE>
<TE>   "You see the tributes to Tupac and the tributes to Biggie," she
says. "Cube and Dre are still writing their history. There's so much
about his career that's been overlooked."</TE>
<TE>   It's true. In a fashion befitting a true pioneer, Eazy-E's career
has receded from the pop consciousness, lacking as it does a much-
photographed bloodied corpse and a quick, sound-bite legacy. His
death didn't provide the imagery of street violence he used to make
his cash, leaving his fame vague. Just another dead rap cat, unable
to tell his story.</TE>
<TE>   So his widow fished through the Ruthless archives to build this
personal project, which also includes karaoke based on Eazy-E solo
hits, a revealing, 20-minute documentary and 10 of his Ruthless
videos.</TE>
<TE>   "Impact of a Legend" works as an object lesson on the careless
thrills of the high-level rap life. "He said, 'Live it to the
fullest,'" Ice Cube recalls in the documentary. "That's what he did,
from the bottom to the top."</TE>
<TE>   Eazy-E fathered nine children, according to his biography,
including two with Woods-Wright. They all live comfortably, she says,
and she hopes the CD/DVD collection will help them understand their
father's legacy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something I can take to Eric's [children], and say, 'This is
what your father did,'" says Woods-Wright. "It does justice."</TE>

<HD>Irreverence With a Twinkle</HD>
<DH>Billy Wilder, who died Wednesday, ingrained in his writing
and directing a sardonic humor, but also a keen understanding of
human character.</DH>

<AU>CHARLES CHAMPLIN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Billy Wilder, who died Wednesday night at age 95, was once asked by a
magazine if there was any film he had wanted to make but had been
unable to. Well, yes, Wilder replied, there was his film about the
Crusades. Those tidings were preposterous enough, because Wilder was,
if nothing else, Hollywood's most acerbic and sharp-eyed observer of
strictly contemporary manners and mores.</LD>
<LD>   But he went on: His story, he said, was set in a small European
village from which all the men left to join a Crusade. But before
they left, they had chastity belts affixed to all their wives and
daughters. His film, Wilder said, would be about the village
locksmith, to be played by Cary Grant.</LD>
<LD>   That was more like it, a synopsis that was pure Wilder: funny,
sardonic, irreverent and at the same time rooted in a keen
understanding of human character.</LD>
<TE>   Wilder, who hit Hollywood in 1934 not knowing a word of English
but became one of its most elegant practitioners, never lost his
heavy Viennese accent, nor his cosmopolitan and essentially European
vision of the ways of the world. His characters were frequently
flawed or at least sublimely dense, like Jack Lemmon as the amazingly
naive flic in "Irma la Douce" (1963) or the TV cameraman being
manipulated by the larcenous Walter Matthau in "The Fortune Cookie"
(1966) (one of Wilder's best films, denied its fullest appreciation
because it was made in the by-then unfashionable black and white).</TE>
<TE>   As a writer-director, Wilder had plenty of attitude, to use a
current word, and William Holden once famously remarked that Wilder's
brain was full of rusty razor blades. Yet most of the time, his view
of his characters was less hostile than amused, and he regarded many
of them, and their ultimate destinies, with a kind of melancholy
forbearance occasionally bordering on sentimentality.</TE>
<TE>   Joe E. Brown's last line in Wilder's 1959 film "Some Like It
Hot"--"Nobody's perfect," as he responds blandly to Lemmon's relating
that he is a man, not a woman--is the most perfect tagline in all of
Wilder's films, perhaps in all of anybody's films. A close second is
Shirley MacLaine's concluding line in "The Apartment" (1960): "Shut
up and deal." Lemmon, as the patsy who declared his independence, and
MacLaine as the seduced and deceived elevator operator who has
declared her own independence and found true love, are going forward
with their lives, free at last. Who needs a sunset; a game of gin is
romantic enough, Wilder is saying.</TE>
<TE>   Many of Wilder's lines, on and off screen, have assumed the
durability of folklore. "France," Wilder remarked after a visit, "is
an interesting country. The money falls apart and you can't tear the
toilet paper." The evening before they were to film the funeral of
Gloria Swanson's monkey in "Sunset Boulevard" (1950), the
cinematographer asked what exactly Wilder had in mind. "Oh, just the
usual monkey funeral," Wilder told him. And Robert Benchley (often
quoted as the author of the line) really did say, "You must get out
of those wet clothes and into a dry martini," but it was written by
Wilder in his first film as a director, "The Major and the Minor"
(1942).</TE>
<TE>   As a director, Wilder had a knack for smart casting and the
ability to get the best out of those he cast. Fred MacMurray
protested that he was a comic actor and a sax player, not up for
portraying the murderer in "Double Indemnity" (1944). Wilder talked
him into it and into a memorable performance. Later MacMurray balked
again at being the philandering boss in "The Apartment," arguing this
time that he had just signed with Disney for some quite different
films. Wilder won him over again.</TE>
<TE>   The words were always what mattered to Wilder, and his visual
style as a director was unobtrusive and seamless. "None of that
shooting from the fireplace; whose point of view is that? Santa
Claus'?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   For all his skills as a director, Wilder always said that he would
as soon have been a writer exclusively; it was just that there were
no longer any Ernst Lubitsches around to do his scripts justice (as
Lubitsch had done for Wilder's and Charles Brackett's "Ninotchka"
[1939]).</TE>
<TE>   As an instance of the writer's perils, Wilder learned by accident
that Charles Boyer had killed a scene, involving a cockroach, that he
and Brackett had written for "Hold Back the Dawn" (1941). "I can't
talk to a cockroach," Boyer had complained to the director, Mitchell
Leisen, who went along with the logic.</TE>
<TE>   To even the score, Wilder said, "Charlie and I wrote Boyer out of
Act 3 entirely, and gave it all to Olivia de Havilland."</TE>
<TE>   The writing was on the wall, so to speak, if you wanted to protect
your words. With Brackett's help, Wilder got to direct that first
feature, "The Major and the Minor." "Paramount thought it would be a
flop," Wilder remembered, "and I would be chastened and go back to
being a nice boy who wrote. But it was a hit."</TE>
<TE>   "We're painters," Wilder said many, many years ago. "It's just
that our canvases cost $2 million each." (Some of Wilder's films cost
less than $1 million, most between $2 million and $3 million.) Today,
Wilder said more recently, "it costs more to publicize a film than it
did to make 'Gone With the Wind.'"</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood was changing in many ways, under the continuing impact
of television and the rising importance of the foreign market. Wilder
seemed unsure just how he fit into the later Hollywood, or how to
find ways to make the kind of films he wanted to make. Into his 80s
he still hoped to make movies and, like Luis Bunuel in Spain, he
still had the stamina to do it.</TE>
<TE>   He had been fortunate in his writing partners--Brackett and then,
for nearly a quarter-century, I.A.L. Diamond. Wilder was devastated
when Diamond died in 1988, and "Buddy Buddy" in 1981 proved to be
their last film, and Wilder's.</TE>
<TE>   To the end of his days, Wilder was honored and courted, an icon
with jokes, an elder statesman who stood for a kind of free-spirited,
highly individual and opinionated filmmaking that now seems to exist,
and only with difficulty, outside the mainstream.</TE>
<TE>   For a time he was a kind of senior creative consultant at United
Artists. "I'm sort of an old doctor, watching the kids do their first
open-heart surgery," Wilder said. "Not that I've given up surgery
myself," although, as it turned out, he had.</TE>
<TE>   Driven out of Europe in 1934, Wilder was one of Hitler's many
inadvertent and unintended gifts to the culture of Western
civilization. There won't be another Billy Wilder along. What you
have to hope is that other filmmakers in later years will have caught
something of his irreverent and questing spirit.</TE>

<HD>After 30 Years, Director's Film Arrives</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NADIA ABOU EL-MAGD</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>CAIRO, Egypt</DL>
<LD>Renowned Egyptian director Salah Abou Seif tried for nearly three
decades to get his country's censors to OK a script about sexual
compatibility, frigidity, female circumcision, masturbation and
prostitution.</LD>
<LD>   Released to Egyptian audiences this year, six years after his
death, the movie that grew out of that script has won praise from
critics who said a story once too hot to handle was made into "a
decent film about sex."</LD>
<LD>   After Abou Seif died in 1996, his son, Mohammed Abou Seif took up
the cause of "Sex School," submitting the script to the government
when a new censor was appointed. Last year, he found a censor who
believed Egypt was ready.</LD>
<TE>   With the official permission needed for any filming in Egypt, the
son shot his father's movie.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed Abou Seif said he closely followed the "Sex School"
script, including directing notes made by his father. He made only
one change: The title became "The Ostrich and the Peacock."</TE>
<TE>   He persevered, he said, "because I knew how important it was for
my father, and because it has been banned for no good reason."</TE>
<TE>   The elder Abou Seif thought that the script, based on his own idea
and written in 1971 by Lenin el-Ramly, could help save marriages by
increasing understanding about sex, his son said.</TE>
<TE>   The "Sex School" script was first rejected in 1971 in what was a
more liberal and secular Egypt. The younger Abou Seif believes that
now, with the rise of religious conservatism, the government allowed
the movie to be made because it wants to encourage an opposite
liberal trend.</TE>
<TE>   He says he is somewhere in the middle: "I'm not extremist about
anything."</TE>
<TE>   Madkour Thabet, the censor who approved the film last year, says
freedom of expression is valued in Egypt, but acknowledged: "What we
lack is practicing it."</TE>
<TE>   The movie sees men as peacocks, strutting into their first sexual
encounters, often with prostitutes, and full of misconceptions about
sex and love. The shy ostrich is the woman, Samira, who cannot
respond sexually to her husband, Hamdy, because she was circumcised
as a child.</TE>
<TE>   "The Ostrich and the Peacock" opens with Hamdy screaming at Samira
after a failed attempt at sex: "You don't love me, I can't take this
anymore. You are frigid. I've been married to a wall for three
years."</TE>
<TE>   They separate. While Hamdy pursues a prostitute, Samira consults
with a marriage counselor on female circumcision, still widely
practiced but barely whispered about in Egypt.</TE>
<TE>   Female circumcision, also known as female genital mutilation, is
known throughout Africa and ranges from clipping or burning the
clitoris to cutting off all the external genitals and sewing the
remnant tissue to leave a tiny opening. The goal is to limit a
woman's sexuality in traditional societies where high value is placed
on a woman's virginity and modesty.</TE>
<TE>   "What is the use of this operation?" the 27-year-old Samira asks
her counselor.</TE>
<TE>   "It has no benefit. It's a bad habit that we should stop," comes
the answer.</TE>
<TE>   "But religion ordered it," responds Samira.</TE>
<TE>   "The majority of people think so, but this is not true," says the
counselor.</TE>
<TE>   The actors underplay any drama in the exchange.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm addressing a minefield topic. In order for nothing to explode
in my face, I had to be straight and swift," Mohammed Abou Seif said.</TE>
<TE>   Samira and Hamdy journey toward reconciliation with the
counselor's help. Sensitive issues are presented as topics for
religious or scientific debate, and little actual sex is shown.</TE>
<TE>   El-Ramly, the scriptwriter, said he'd hoped to see "more
exhibitionist scenes." But Mohammed Abou Seif said, "Whether I like
it or not, I can neither ignore nor forget the ethics and traditions
which I grew up with."</TE>
<TE>   "'The Ostrich and the Peacock' is a decent film about sex," wrote
a critic in the daily Al-Ahram. But a critic for the weekly Sawt
al-Umma said watching the movie was like "sitting in a classroom, not
in a cinema."</TE>
<TE>   The movie won three prizes at Egypt's Alexandria International
Film Festival last year--best story, best music and best new actress
for Basma, who played Samira.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed Abu Seif, 51, dedicated the movie to his "mentor and
father, Salah Abou Seif."</TE>
<TE>   In his half-century career, the elder Abou Seif, a pioneer of
realism in Egyptian cinema, directed 45 movies, many of them now
considered classics. He found themes in attitudes about sex.</TE>
<TE>   "A Woman's Youth," one of his landmark films, is a story of lust
and restraint, desire and morality in which a femme fatale seduces a
young man who left his village to study in Cairo. In "The Beginning
and the End," Nafisah, an ugly girl from a lower middle class family,
becomes a prostitute because she craves love and attention.</TE>
<TE>   "How big is the role of sex in our lives? That same proportion was
reflected in his movies," said Mohammed Abou Seif.</TE>

<HD>Pianist Cain Lets the Music Speak</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pianist Michael Cain's performance at Rocco's on Thursday night was a
compelling study in musical adventure. The owner of bachelor's and
master's degrees in music from CalArts, a faculty member at the New
England Conservatory and the veteran of gigs with (among dozens of
others) Jack DeJohnette and Ravi Coltrane, Cain has the training and
the experience to do just about anything that he wants to do with his
instrument.</LD>
<LD>   At Rocco's, he placed the focus squarely on his piano work, with
bassist Phil Grenier and drummer Chris Vatalaro playing purely
supportive roles. Moving casually through a set of pieces--all
unidentified, but presumably original--Cain worked in highly
spontaneous fashion. Occasionally, he ended a piece by simply
stopping, without any sort of conclusive flourish. Other works began
with seemingly random bits of melody gradually coalescing into more
substantive material.</LD>
<LD>   Cain's opening number, with its low-level harmonic movement and
its continuous repetitions over slightly shifting rhythms, had the
feeling of an improvisatory reference to the work of composers such
as Philip Glass and Steve Reich.</LD>
<TE>   Its diminished sense of chordal cadence was present in other
pieces, as well--reflective, perhaps, of Cain's interest in various
sorts of drone-centered indigenous musics.</TE>
<TE>   But Cain's ability to combine on-the-spot, compositional cohesion
with an arching sense of line more than compensated for the sometimes
static nature of his works. It was difficult, in fact, to determine
where the pre-planned music began and the improvisations
began--always the sign of an inventive musical mind at work.</TE>
<TE>   Cain would have done himself a service, however, to have taken at
least a moment to communicate titles and/or methods for his
fascinating efforts. Informed listeners often are more receptive
listeners.</TE>

<HD>'Murder,' Oscar Winner for Best Documentary, on HBO</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>HOWARD ROSENBERG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Murder on a Sunday Morning" arrives on HBO a week after winning the
Academy Award for best documentary feature.</LD>
<LD>   Although not the emotional equal of "Promises," another nominated
documentary that aired earlier on PBS, it's a dandy film that focuses
on Brenton Butler, a 15-year-old African American who was tried in
the fatal shooting of 65-year-old tourist Mary Ann Stephens in
Jacksonville, Fla., nearly two years ago.</LD>
<LD>   He was on his way to apply for a job at a video store in a white
neighborhood when picked up and bundled off by police, even though he
was at least five years younger and four inches shorter than the
killer described by the victim's husband.</LD>
<TE>   It's immediately obvious police have bungled the case that
filmmaker Jean-Xavier de Lestrade presents through the prisms of
Butler's family and attorneys, public defenders Patrick McGuinness
and Ann Finnell. By alternating their stated strategies with their
questioning of witnesses--McGuinness is especially forthcoming--De
Lestrade creates a disturbing but fascinating primer on the frailties
of a justice system that in this instance has cops seemingly intent
on convicting the wrong person.</TE>
<TE>   Although its music is a bit thick, "Murder on a Sunday Morning" is
noteworthy for its questioning of accepted truths and for putting you
into the shoes of the stony defendant as he hears himself being
falsely accused of murder and observes McGuinness appear to
methodically break down the prosecution's case.</TE>
<TE>   The question is whether it's enough to win him acquittal.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Murder on a Sunday Morning" premieres Sunday night at 10 on HBO.
The network has rated it TV-14-L-V (may be unsuitable for children
under 14, with advisories for coarse language and violence).</TE>

<HD>Some Girl Talk From 13 Notable Women</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Candice Bergen was a girl she was afraid of the dark. She still
is. When "The X-Files'" Gillian Anderson was a girl her ambition was
to be a grown-up. Astronaut Sally Ride wanted to play professional
baseball with the Los Angeles Dodgers.</LD>
<LD>   They are just three of 13 famous women from various walks of life
who tell their unique stories of growing up on the WE: Women's
Entertainment special "When I Was a Girl," premiering Sunday on the
cable network.</LD>
<LD>   With Stockard Channing as host, the hourlong documentary features
actresses Bergen, Anderson, Edie Falco, Wendie Malick, Elizabeth
Perkins, Michelle Rodriguez and Amy Sedaris, opera star Denyce
Graves, astronaut Ride, political pundit Dee Dee Myers, WNBA star
Lisa Leslie, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Anna Quindlen and
Children's Defense Fund activist Marian Wright Edelman.</LD>
<TE>   "I wanted to do this show for a while," said broadcast journalist
Linda Ellerbee, who is executive producer of the special. "We all
grow up to be different women, but the one thing we have in common is
that we were all girls. And we have been girls at different times.
Dee Dee Myers' first memory of the larger world is when her father
went to Vietnam, whereas Marian Wright Edelman's first memory is that
somebody snatched her from [a whites-only] water fountain. She said,
'I didn't know there was black water and white water.'"</TE>
<TE>   During the interviews, Ellerbee said she discovered that all the
women's experiences growing up "were separate to them, but
collectively there were similarities, if such a thing is possible."</TE>
<TE>   The documentary is broken down into five acts. Act 1 recounts the
women's earliest memories.</TE>
<TE>   "For most of them their very first memory was mother," Ellerbee
said. "We ask them to finish sentences like, 'When I was a girl I
thought my mother was....'"</TE>
<TE>   Replies ranged from Falco describing her mother as the most
beautiful woman she had ever seen to Perkins' memory of listening to
her divorced mother crying.</TE>
<TE>   On the other end of the spectrum, Quindlen questions her mother's
decision to put dust ruffles on her bed. Quindlen thought there was a
monster lurking under the ruffles, so she would always run and leap
on her bed to avoid being attacked by the creature.</TE>
<TE>   In Act 2, the women talk about their lives beyond their backyards.
Act 3 chronicles how they coped with adolescence.</TE>
<TE>   "If there is one thing in common, I don't think there was a single
woman who said, 'I think adolescence is really easy,'" Ellerbee said.
Perkins, for example, confesses to being "weird" during that time in
her life.</TE>
<TE>   Training bras are a major topic in this section. "Candice says, 'I
didn't need one then and I don't need one now, but I still had to
have one,'" Ellerbee said. "She went to the drugstore to buy one.
Anna Quindlen talks about the fact that you had to have one, because
the guys [in your class] would come up behind you and would snap the
bra. There had to be something there to snap."</TE>
<TE>   Act 4 examines high school experiences, and in Act 5 the women are
asked what they would tell their younger selves.</TE>
<TE>   The women are interviewed separately. Peppered throughout the
documentary are photos and home movies of the participants. "It's
very dream-like," Ellerbee said.</TE>
<TE>   One especially amusing photograph features a young Bergen and her
famous father, ventriloquist Edgar Bergen, holding an elaborate
funeral for her pet turtle.</TE>
<TE>   "She had the weirdest pets," said Ellerbee, laughing. "She had a
burro that wouldn't move. She would go to the top of the hill [near
her house] and sit on the burro that wouldn't move and pretend to
protect the house from marauders."</TE>
<TE>   The participants seemed to welcome the fact that the program
didn't concentrate on how they became famous.</TE>
<TE>   "The reaction from all of the women was, 'These are the most
interesting questions I've ever been asked. No one has asked me this
before,'" Ellerbee said. "This show [is about] how you became who you
are as a human."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "When I Was a Girl" will be shown Sunday night at 5 and 10 on WE:

<TE>   The biggest winner was Sally Field, who has finally emerged from
the shadow of her "You like me, you really like me!" comments thanks
to the excesses of Berry's pitiful performance. What began as one of
the most touching moments in the history of the Academy Awards
quickly spiraled into a buffoonish display of incoherent rambling and

<TE>   What Halle Berry should have said in her acceptance speech is that
she is thankful she lives in a town where a woman who is beautiful,
famous and black can flee the scene of an accident, pay a minuscule
fine, do a mere 20 hours of community service, feign amnesia about
the whole thing and still win an Oscar.</TE>

<TE>   Valencia</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Why do I feel that Halle Berry legitimately earned her Oscar
whereas Denzel Washington won a popularity contest over Russell
Crowe? Is it because Julia Roberts, one of the most influential
Hollywood insiders, openly lobbied for him? And then others, if
rumors are to be believed, followed suit because it was "his time"?</TE>
<TE>   Not to disparage Washington's talent, but campaigns such as these
did not address his performance in "Training Day" so much as they
confirmed his place in the fold.</TE>
<TE>   This year, Washington is the Insider and Crowe is the Outsider.
And that is why Crowe lost the Oscar for best actor in a leading
role.</TE>

<TE>   It bugs me to no end when I read stupid letters from stupid people
who, I'm sure, will swear up and down they're not racists or bigots
but write bigoted letters anyway. So, "A Beautiful Mind" gets best
picture, best director, best supporting actress and best adapted
screenplay, but because Russell Crowe loses to Denzel Washington, the
fix is on! Political correctness at its worst!</TE>
<TE>   God forbid that Denzel Washington could possibly have won because
he's what--talented, maybe?</TE>
<TE>   When "Godfather II" won best picture, best director and best
adapted screenplay, who was screaming foul from the rooftops when Art
Carney beat out Al Pacino for best actor in "Harry and Tonto"? Who
was screaming "thief!" when Hilary Swank beat out Annette Bening for
best actress in "Boys Don't Cry" while Bening's picture, "American
Beauty," got best picture, best actor and best director? Where were
all the naysayers when "Schindler's List" won best picture, best
director and best adapted screenplay but got shut out of the best
actor and actress categories?</TE>
<TE>   Denzel Washington and Halle Berry won because that's who the
members of the academy voted for. Get over it.</TE>
<TE>   HOWARD MOORE</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I'll tell you why Denzel Washington took home the Oscar for best
actor and Russell Crowe didn't: because any number of talented actors
could have built upon the quirks, twitches and eccentricities
inherent in John Nash's character to craft a stunning performance,
but no other actor working today could have sold us the corrupt,
sadistic, Machiavellian Detective Sergeant Alonzo Harris for two
brutal hours and had us wishing there was more. Great acting makes us
forget it's acting.</TE>

<TE>   In his article, "How Big a Role Did Politics Play?" (March 27),
Robert Welkos loosely examines what role all of the so-called smear
tactics played (or didn't) in tightening this year's Oscar race. What
he obviously hasn't considered is that the "whisper" campaign made so
public by a number of people, including the makers of "A Beautiful
Mind," could have had a completely different effect.</TE>
<TE>   I get the impression that, in addition to being a great film, the
movie was perceived as a victim. And victims get a lot of pity.</TE>
<TE>   The "Beautiful" PR folks should be applauded for blowing wildly
out of proportion all of these little stories few had paid any
attention to, essentially creating a debate about the relationship of
history and art. Art's always going to win in the art crowd, no
question.</TE>
<TE>   TODD MERRIMAN</TE>
<TE>   New York</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The article by Robert Welkos notes that the leading man in the
best picture, "A Beautiful Mind," failed to win an Oscar, even as
Jennifer Connelly did win for playing his wife. At least Russell
Crowe was nominated.</TE>
<TE>   When "Titanic" won for best picture, leading lady Kate Winslet was
nominated but leading man Leonardo DiCaprio was not. When
"Shakespeare in Love" won for best picture, leading lady Gwyneth
Paltrow won an Oscar but leading man Joseph Fiennes was not even
nominated.</TE>
<TE>   I find those cases odder than that of Russell Crowe, who did,
after all, win an Oscar last year. Why would the young men who
literally carried best picture winners not even earn nominations?</TE>
<TE>   I wonder if the mature men who dominate among academy voters are
more comfortable rewarding lovely and talented young women than
handsome and talented young men.</TE>

<TE>   Last Sunday, Halle Berry became the first African American woman
to win an Oscar for best leading actress. Having broken down a race
barrier, it is ironic that Berry is still limited by her gender.</TE>
<TE>   Since men and women must compete in separate Oscar categories,
Berry can triumph over actresses of other ethnicities, but her
performance cannot be evaluated with those of her male peers.</TE>
<TE>   What is the academy's rationale for separating men and women into
separate Oscar categories? Certainly there are instances where
separate awards for men and women are appropriate.</TE>
<TE>   Since men are stronger and faster, it would be difficult for women
to compete with men for the same medals in many Olympic events.
However, acting puts men and women on a level playing field.</TE>
<TE>   There is no Oscar distinction between male and female directors,
male and female editors, and there should not be one for male and
female performers.</TE>
<TE>   It would certainly be racist to reserve separate awards for black
and white actors. Why isn't it considered sexist to separate men and
women into their own Oscar categories?</TE>
<TE>   KIM ELSESSER</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Now that Halle Berry has conquered an imposing racial barrier for
black actresses by being named best actress, it's time for Hollywood
to embrace Asians, American Indians, Hispanics and other minorities
and give them more of an opportunity to shine on the big screen.</TE>

<TE>   Patrick Goldstein attempts to defend "A Beautiful Mind" from "15
rounds of below-the-belt punches" by throwing the lowest punch of all
("Sifting Through the Mud, Looking for a Better Way," March 26). When
it comes to accuracy in movies, Goldstein warns us to be "careful
what [we] wish for," citing the film "13 Days" as "factual to a
T--and a gigantic snoozefest." For a man so critical of "nasty
mudslinging," this is one incredibly cavalier sucker punch.</TE>
<TE>   "13 Days" was one of those rare films that both thrilled and
educated its audience. It reminded us of how much was at stake as
real men and women went about the business of saving the world. It
was based on reality, and it was compelling drama. It inspired much
stimulating discussion long after the lights went up.</TE>
<TE>   If Goldstein is upset by the mudslinging that goes on in this
town, I suggest he stop participating in it.</TE>

show. Now when is the academy going to wake up and give Doris Day the
honorary Oscar she's earned?</TE>
<TE>   It is an absolute disgrace that this underrated and multitalented
lady (a major film, television and recording star) is passed over
year after year. It's about time the academy took note and corrected
this glaring and embarrassing oversight.</TE>

<TE>   The overblown coverage of the Academy Awards by the media points
to the misdirected values in our society. In a world where 80% of the
population doesn't have indoor plumbing, we're celebrating the
frivolous.</TE>
<TE>   One must consider what advances we would achieve in medicine,
health care and living standards if we celebrated the great works of
inventors, researchers and scientists with such enthusiasm, if we
celebrated the work of those who each day try to improve life and
raise the standard of living in order to make the world a better
place.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps then more kids would pursue with enthusiasm such
occupations, and get the credit they deserve for doing so.</TE>

<LD>   Oprah Declines Bush Invitation to Travel</LD>
<LD>   In a measure of Oprah Winfrey's clout, the Bush administration
reportedly asked the talk-show host to join an official U.S.
delegation to tour Afghanistan's schools, celebrating young girls'
return to the classroom.</LD>
<TE>   Winfrey begged off, however, saying she didn't have the time.
"Given her responsibility to the show, she isn't adding anything to
her calendar," a representative of Winfrey's Chicago-based production
company told the Chicago Tribune. "She was invited, but she
respectfully declined."</TE>
<TE>   The White House postponed a trip that was to have included Bush

<TE>   Estefans Granted Restraining Order</TE>
<TE>   Singer Gloria Estefan and her husband, Emilio, obtained a
permanent restraining order to keep a Venezuelan actor-singer away
from them, their family, home, businesses and their gym. The Estefans
had been granted a temporary restraining order against Juan Carlos
Diaz in January.</TE>
<TE>   Diaz, who faces trial for criminal trespass at the Estefans'
estate, did not challenge the order and dropped his request for a
stay-away order against the Estefans and their bodyguard. "I agree
with this because I don't really want any relations with the
Estefans," Diaz told a Florida judge Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The judge banned contact with the Estefans in any way.</TE>
<TE>   Diaz, 33, initially accused Emilio Estefan of making unwelcome
sexual advances toward him at a gym. The Estefans sued Diaz for
defamation and accused Diaz of stalking them.</TE>

<TE>   Springsteen Contributes to Sept. 11 Charity</TE>
<TE>   A New Jersey charity for victims of the Sept. 11 attacks is

<TE>   The Alliance of Neighbors of Monmouth County said the educational
foundation will provide financial aid and assistance to spouses and
children of attack victims. The wellness center will offer services
to meet the emotional needs of families and the community, the group
said.</TE>

<TE>   'Body Worlds' Draws Crowds, Criticism</TE>
<TE>   A protester threw a blanket over a likeness of a pregnant woman
and her 7-month-old fetus during the first week of the "Body Worlds"
exhibit at a gallery in London.</TE>
<TE>   According to BBC News, the show of 175 healthy and diseased body
parts and 25 whole bodies at a gallery in London attracted criticism
and huge crowds as it toured Europe.</TE>
<TE>   The bodies of the people were donated by people before they died
to Prof. Gunther von Hagens. The German artist proceeded to drain the
corpses of fluids and replace them with a type of plastic.</TE>
<TE>   The protester, Martin Wynness, also dropped paint on the floor and
was removed by security guards. Calling the show horrifying and
disrespectful, he said he acted out of concern for his children.</TE>
<TE>   British politicians had expressed disgust with the show, but the
government failed to turn up evidence of laws being broken. Legal
challenges in other countries were also unsuccessful. Organizers say
that the show has been seen by 8 million people in Japan,
Switzerland, Austria and Germany.</TE>

<TE>   Orchestras Commit to Three New Works</TE>
<TE>   The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra and the Philadelphia Orchestra
will commission at least three new works that both will perform as
part of a new partnership. The orchestras will split the $130,000
cost of commissioning the new works and will take turns playing them
for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   "That way we both get the most visibility out of one project,"
said Gideon Toeplitz, managing director of the Pittsburgh Symphony.</TE>
<TE>   The plan helps the orchestras save money and attract the works of
high-profile composers, who will get exposure to a wider audience.
Each orchestra typically budgets $100,000 a year for new music.</TE>
<TE>   "What is unusual here is the number of works over a number of
years," said Jack McAuliffe, vice president of the American Symphony
Orchestra League. Orchestras co-commissioning single works are more
common.</TE>
<TE>   If the orchestras like the partnership, it will continue beyond
the initial three pieces, said Philadelphia Orchestra President
Joseph Kluger.</TE>
<TE>   The companies will premiere "Violin Concerto" by Oliver Knussen,
Roberto Sierra's "Concerto for Violin and Viola" and a yet-to-be
determined work by Russian Sofia Gubaidulina.</TE>

<HD>Bulls and Bears on Rukeyser's Departure</HD>
<DH>Television: The host's dramatic exit from 'Wall Street
Week' prompts a lively debate. He vows to return, but is it all over
but the shouting?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHANNA NEUMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>It never quite rose to the level of the Ted Koppel versus David
Letterman media frenzy, but the demise of PBS' "Wall Street Week With
Louis Rukeyser" has created more than its share of buzz among the
financial set.</LD>
<LD>   At the center has been Rukeyser himself--voice cracking, eyes
dancing, looking for all the world like a parody of the mad newsman
Howard Beale in the 1976 movie "Network" since Maryland Public
Television, the entity responsible for the show, unceremoniously
announced plans to replace him.</LD>
<LD>   "I want you to rise out of your chair--not to shout, 'I'm mad as
hell and not going to take it anymore,' but to ... write or e-mail
your local station saying you heard Louis Rukeyser is still going to
have a program and you'd like to see it," he told viewers on what
turned out to be his last show a week ago. "I promise you that if
enough of you do that, it will do the job."</LD>
<TE>   There has been a sympathetic media outpouring, mingled with
outrage from the 22 most frequent guests, most of whom owed their
fame and in some cases their fat portfolios to exposure on the show
and who are now--surprise!--boycotting the successor program.</TE>
<TE>   "An island of wit, decorum and knowledge in a sea of junk," was
just one of the bouquets to Rukeyser, this thrown by the Baltimore
Sun.</TE>
<TE>   But by week's end, detractors were weighing in as well. An
unabashed egotist, they snickered. A 69-year-old, white-haired
veteran who didn't know how to leave the stage gracefully. A tycoon
fighting to hold on to his national platform to protect his lucrative
empire of speeches, cruise ship lectures and newsletters, estimated
to bring in at least $20 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   "Lou Rukeyser believed too many of his own press clippings," said
Dean Rotbart, a former Wall Street Journal columnist who writes a
media newsletter called newsroomconfidential.com. In a piece
headlined, "King Lou Is Dethroned but Still Won't Shut Up," Rotbart
added, "Lou drowned in his own pomposity and doesn't even know it."</TE>
<TE>   It was Maryland Public Television, which sponsored the show from
Owings Mills, Md., for all of its 32 years, that made the decision to
replace Rukeyser. After his on-air outburst, the producing station
quickly scheduled a replacement edition Friday, featuring as host
72-year-old Marshall Loeb, former managing editor of Fortune;
84-year-old Julius Westheimer, former Baltimore stockbroker;
sixtysomething technical analyst Bernadette Murphy; and 55-year-old
James Grant, editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer. The featured
guest was the baby of the show, 47-year-old Gus Sauter, who manages
mutual funds for Vanguard Group.</TE>
<TE>   Yet if the temporary lineup appears to diminish the chances
Rukeyser can sue PBS for ageism, it also added more pink to the
already red faces at Maryland Public Television, where vice president
Jeff Hankin has been telling reporters that "the purpose of the
change is to make the show relevant to today's investor population."</TE>
<TE>   Rukeyser's rousing of his viewers definitely had impact. USA Today
reported Thursday that PBS affiliates across the country were
recording viewer reaction "unprecedented in volume and venom, with
fans threatening to withhold contributions." The PBS station in
Sacramento alone received 400 outraged viewers' complaints.</TE>
<TE>   "It's clear that 99.99% of the country regards this as stupid and
graceless," Rukeyser said in an interview from his Greenwich, Conn.,
home, citing the thousands of calls logged by one station, all
favorable toward the show.</TE>
<TE>   Rukeyser's ratings were reasonably healthy--about 2 million
viewers weekly, compared with the 8 million or so who regularly tune
in "Antiques Roadshow," PBS' top-ranked program. Although down from
an estimated high of 5 million in 1982, Rukeyser's ratings still made
his show one of the main events in its genre.</TE>
<TE>   "If they had approached me nicely, we could have had an amicable,
proper and gracious parting," Rukeyser said. "So many are now saying,
'Lou, don't desert us.' And I won't."</TE>
<TE>   So abrupt was the departure, Rukeyser said, that Maryland Public
Television confiscated his photographs, shut down the show's Web site
and fired his producer and assistant.</TE>
<TE>   Rukeyser vows to return, saying his phone has been ringing off the
hook with offers for a rival business show. And many loyal viewers
and colleagues will go with him. "I don't think anyone combines his
quick wit and devastating questions," said Frank Cappiello, a
frequent panelist since the show's start in 1970.</TE>
<TE>   But public broadcasting officials are sanguine that by the debut
in late June of "Wall Street Week With Fortune"--the new show they
designed with a reduced role for Rukeyser in mind--the flap will have
faded like an old Hollywood diva.</TE>
<TE>   Among those delighted at Rukeyser's fall are the stock-market
bears, who say that Rukeyser was a great cheerleader for capitalism
who seemed never to want to hear a negative word.</TE>
<TE>   "I find it ironic that the TV show treated him the way he treated
the bears," said William Fleckinstein, a Seattle investment advisor.
"He was extremely disdainful to anyone with a bearish view. He
preferred pompoms to doing research."</TE>
<TE>   Nonsense, said Rukeyser, who insists he warned frequently about
the Internet boom with such pithy, punning lines as, "The new theme
on Wall Street appears to be dot-com all ye faithful."</TE>
<TE>   One thing unlikely to change--either at the new "Wall Street Week"
without Louis Rukeyser or at whatever new venture Rukeyser cooks up
from his Connecticut home--is a guest list heavy on expertise--and
conflicts of interest.</TE>
<TE>   In a piece that aired on another PBS show, "The NewsHour With Jim
Lehrer," media reporter Terence Smith spotlighted the "significant
and profitable financial relationships" panelists and their
investment firms sometimes have with the companies whose stocks they
recommend.</TE>
<TE>   Rukeyser's response? "The suggestion that people of the highest
quality are shills is insulting to them and the viewers," he said.</TE>
<TE>   There is no hint from Maryland Public Television that it plans to
upset that particular apple cart. "We never script the guests," said
vice president Hankin.</TE>
<TE>   What is clear is that PBS' president and chief executive, Pat
Mitchell, has created a climate of change that influenced Maryland
Public Television to try to recast Rukeyser. A former president of
CNN Productions and Time Inc. Television, Mitchell has in the last
two years moved "Masterpiece Theatre" from Sunday to Monday night,
brought the first American detective to the "Mystery" series that has
long featured their British cousins and generally shaken the place
up.</TE>
<TE>   But if Rukeyser is banished, can this really be public television?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a little hard-pressed to see how 'Wall Street Week With Louis
Rukeyser'--without Louis Rukeyser--is going to be a big hit on Friday
nights," said Brian Rogers, a T. Rowe Price mutual fund manager who
withdrew from the show after Rukeyser was removed.</TE>
<TE>   T. Rowe Price, along with Oppenheimer Funds, was an underwriter of
the show. A spokesman said last week it had no comment on whether it
would continue to fund "Wall Street Week."</TE>
<TE>   The show's legacy may be harder to define, measured in the
portfolios of millions of viewers who took or ignored the advice
doled out by guests. One study by Bloomberg News found that over a
five-year period, year-end predictions from Rukeyser's top panelists
beat the performance of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index by 5%.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the grateful support of those whom Rukeyser helped
put on the map. "Being on the show was like getting a papal
blessing," said Mario Gabelli, a New York analyst who was on the show
seven times--but who's counting? "Twenty years ago, when I was a
rookie, it was like getting the Good Housekeeping seal of approval."</TE>

<HD>Memorable Times With Milton Berle</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GLENN SCHWARTZ</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Milton Berle was my first client when I started my public relations
firm in 1985. To outsiders, he called me Mr. Schwartz. Privately, he
called me "kid," "son," "what's his name," "my PR" and words you just
can't print in a family newspaper. He wasn't just a client, he was
like a familiar relative--cranky and funny.</LD>
<LD>   I was 25 years old when I did my first campaign for him. After it
was over, he sent me a cashmere sweater. He used to tell me that he
had underwear older than me. I am 43 now, and I still have that
sweater. It no longer fits.</LD>
<LD>   We worked together more than 12 years, and the thing about Berle
was that every time you were with him, you never forgot. And everyone
who met him, even for scant seconds, felt the same. The waiters, the
cabdrivers, the bellhops, clerks at the 7-Eleven and everyone walking
down the street that just happened to glance his way.</LD>
<TE>   I didn't learn everything from Milton. But I learned a lot--all
with the Berle spin.</TE>
<TE>   Buying cigars, clipping cigars, smoking cigars. I even pretended
to like cigars. It did, however, come with a price. Limo rides were
windows up, no air-conditioning, even in summer. I knew that he cared
for me when he allowed me to crack the window. But only once or
twice.</TE>
<TE>   My clothes always reeked--but it reminded me of our hours
together.</TE>
<TE>   He taught me card tricks; he taught my daughter card tricks. I
learned to eat lox with capers, tell a joke, slide first into the
limo, travel with my own pillow, wear a raincoat in the summer, cut
off the ends of the white bread, not to top him with jokes, not to
interrupt ("Ah, ah, ah! I'm talking. The king is talking," he would
say), and to listen and wait. Lots of listening and waiting. All well
worth it.</TE>
<TE>   We spent a lot of time together. The lunches at the Friars Club
were five, six hours long. I just couldn't leave. The stories were
priceless.</TE>
<TE>   I sat with him in his den one morning and he sang the music from
his Broadway show, "Milton and Me," that never opened--the entire
show. I remember just sitting and listening, smiling the whole time.
I'll never forget that.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't just the show business stories that stuck. It was the
other stuff, the personal stuff.</TE>
<TE>   I remember having Chinese food in a restaurant in New York one
evening. Milton had dry skin, and he was doing a lot of itching. We
talked about that, insomnia and sinus infections. I told Milton that
everyone in the restaurant must have thought we were talking about
Jolson, Hope or Carson. He just had an itch. Just like a normal
person. I remember the dinners with famous people. Schwarzenegger and
Shriver, Dan Rather and Leontyne Price, Muhammad Ali and Captain
Kangaroo. Even in that company, he always had a seat for me at his
table. Did I mention Tiny Tim?</TE>
<TE>   I sat next to Colin Powell at a White House function, met the
first President Bush and took home my place card. All because of
Milton.</TE>
<TE>   When Milton found out Billy Barty died I was again in his den. He
got a lot of those calls. He was the "go to" guy for funny Hollywood
eulogies. I offered to help write it on index cards. Then I got
yelled at because I wasn't union. Being yelled at by Milton Berle is
an honor.</TE>
<TE>   My parents finally had a chance to meet Milton when he performed
at Westbury, N.Y. He told my mother that she looked like my sister,
and took a picture with them. He was in his bathrobe at the time,
cooling down from his show. The picture is still on their
refrigerator and it still looks like they were visiting him in the
hospital.</TE>
<TE>   He remembered my birthday; he even bought me a Piaget watch--a
fake. I didn't let on I knew it was a knockoff. I was touched by the
idea that he actually stopped on the street to buy me anything. That
day we watched the major league All-Star Game together. He loved
baseball, and so did I. That was a good birthday.</TE>
<TE>   Or as Milton would say, "That was a good "Berleday."</TE>

<DH>Recent war movies present a grittier vision of combat--and
a more reverent view of combatants.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNN SMITH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the recent movie "We Were Soldiers," a war correspondent, dazed
after a chaotic and bloody battle in the early phase of the Vietnam
War, faces the microphones of fellow reporters and says: "I'm not
sure how to tell this story." He could have been speaking for
Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   With seven war movies deployed in the last six months and more on
the way, the nation's screens are awash in combat, and the movies
portray the military in a far more positive light than it has been
accustomed to in recent years.</LD>
<LD>   By sheer coincidence, the recent films--including "Behind Enemy
Lines" (set in Bosnia), "Hart's War" (World War II), "Black Hawk
Down" (Somalia) and "We Were Soldiers" (Vietnam)--were all in
production well before the Sept. 11 attacks and were not inspired by
the ensuing resurgence of patriotism. Rather, industry executives
said, they had grown out of a continuing national appreciation for
the veterans of World War II, championed in D-day anniversary
celebrations and in the successful 1998 film "Saving Private Ryan."</LD>
<TE>   But the recent wave of films has struck a chord with audiences
newly appreciative of men and women in uniform. "We Were Soldiers"
has grossed more than $64 million in four weeks; "Black Hawk Down"
has grossed about $108 million so far and "Behind Enemy Lines" nearly
$60 million.</TE>
<TE>   Coming films, although also in production or finished before Sept.
11, feature plots variously based on Navajo soldiers who use their
language to encode military secrets in World War II ("Windtalkers");
a crisis aboard the Soviet Union's first nuclear submarine during the
Cold War ("K-19: The Widowmaker"); POWs captured by the Japanese in
World War II and forced to build a "death railway" in Thailand ("To
End All Wars"); and an American soldier who eluded the Japanese and
built his own empire in the Philippine jungle ("They Fought Alone").</TE>
<TE>   Industry executives stress the coincidence of the timing and
insist these movies were not produced to take advantage of the
national mood. One new film, "Harrison's Flowers," evokes an eerie
comparison with the murder of journalist Daniel Pearl only weeks ago.
MGM delayed the release of "Windtalkers" from November until this
summer because of fears that it would have come too soon after Sept.
11 and the beginning of the military campaign in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Levin, MGM's president of worldwide marketing and
distribution, said that what has fueled studio interest in war movies
was Steven Spielberg's "Saving Private Ryan," which grossed $216
million domestically and spawned a "rebirth of the concept of honor
and sacrifice of military service." In what was then an unprecedented
portrayal of the grisly nature of combat, public response showed that
"an audience wants some kind of realistic look at it, not a
completely sanitized look," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Levin objected to a phrase he hears frequently, "all these war
movies." Any film's success depends on whether it is well made, he
said, not whether its theme tries to connect with current events or a
public sentiment.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, scholars such as film historian Thomas Doherty,
assistant professor of American studies at Brandeis University and
author of the war-movie book "Projections of War," say the films
signal a shift in the national mood. "An antiwar film probably
wouldn't get made or released after Sept. 11," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the military prison drama "The Last Castle" was briefly
delayed last fall and its advertising overhauled to eliminate
potentially disturbing images. The film grossed $18 million.</TE>
<TE>   In the current atmosphere, contemplative or bluntly antiwar
projects probably would seem out of place. "Three Kings," a cynical
look at the Gulf War that was released in 1999, and "The Thin Red
Line," a 1998 World War II film with an anti-military perspective,
grossed a modest $61 million and $36 million, respectively. More
recently, the prisoner-of-war drama "Hart's War" has earned $19
million.</TE>
<TE>   Lack of interest in such approaches is not limited to movies. The
play "War Letters" closed last month in Beverly Hills after 19
performances. "We misread the zeitgeist," said producer Susan Dietz.
"This is about psychology, sociology, politics, the intellectual
climate of war. 'Black Hawk Down' is a two-hour street fight," she
said. "People like the gruesome, bloody, violent nature of certain
films."</TE>
<TE>   Movies tend to reflect the values of their time, Doherty said, and
spins can be remarkably diverse.</TE>
<TE>   For example, in movies about World War I, notably 1930's "All
Quiet on the Western Front," war often was portrayed as a meaningless
waste, he said. Stanley Kubrick's 1957 "Paths of Glory" stands as a
trenchant document of war's potential for hypocrisy.</TE>
<TE>   "When World War II comes along, Hollywood suddenly has to tell you
a different story. Now war is a moral enterprise. The message in
World War II films [such as 'Casablanca' in 1942] is you must
sacrifice, and good people do die. It's worth it in the end."</TE>
<TE>   Korean War movies were somewhat more ambiguous. "The Bridges at
Toko-Ri" (1954) offered an examination of the war's ultimate futility
but featured vivid aerial combat scenes--and military justification.
"I Want You" (1951) explored the effects of that war on a small-town
family.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Vietnam War Portrayed as 'Total Moral Confusion'</TE>
<TE>   In the major Vietnam War movies ("The Deer Hunter," 1978; "Coming
Home," 1978; "Apocalypse Now," 1979; "Platoon," 1986; "Full Metal
Jacket," 1987; "Born on the Fourth of July," 1989), war was "total
moral confusion," Doherty said. None of those was made until years
after the last U.S. helicopter left Saigon.</TE>
<TE>   In the relatively small genre of war movies, the World War II
theme is the most popular. Vietnam presents filmmakers with a sticky
dramatic problem, mainly that the U.S. couldn't claim victory. UCLA
film historian Howard Suber said, "We were the big guy, defending
forces of truth, justice and saving the world for democracy, and we
couldn't bring down the folks crawling around in caves like rats.
That's not how the story is supposed to go."</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, Doherty said he thinks American culture is "in a place
where it appreciates the uniform again, but it still doesn't feel
good about the Vietnamese War."</TE>
<TE>   The films "Black Hawk Down" and "We Were Soldiers" sculpt the
genre to appeal less to ideology than to concepts of male bonding and
the "warrior code," Doherty said. They're fighting for their brothers
in arms with the slogan "leave no man behind."</TE>
<TE>   "We Were Soldiers," as well as the coming "K-19: The Widowmaker,"
starring Harrison Ford as the captain of the Soviet submarine, also
reflect a new appreciation for the courage and humanity of the enemy.</TE>
<TE>   An antiwar film is a difficult proposition in any era, Doherty
said. Paraphrasing filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard, he observed that war's
inherent drama and excitement can be so compelling that they work
against any message.</TE>
<TE>   "We Were Soldiers," based on the book "We Were Soldiers Once ...
and Young" by Joseph L. Galloway and retired Lt. Gen. Harold G.
Moore, intends to blaze a middle path. Galloway described the book
and movie as "antiwar" not "anti-Vietnam War."</TE>
<TE>   The movie comes at a time when perspectives on the Vietnam War
have evolved and become more nuanced. Beyond the obvious value of
hindsight, scholars have gained access to declassified war documents
and open dialogues with military leaders and policymakers on both the
U.S. and North Vietnamese sides. Combat veterans such as Tim O'Brien
("The Things They Carried") and dissidents such as David Harris ("Our
War") continue to publish memoirs.</TE>
<TE>   Galloway asserted that no previous war films about Vietnam told
the truth. Those films "portrayed the American soldiers as if they
were all clones of Lt. Calley," he said, referring to the most
prominent figure in the My Lai massacre of Vietnamese villagers.
"They just have a picture of your average American soldier as a baby
killer, village burner, a dope-crazed fool who's rampaging across the
country," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I did four tours in Vietnam. I didn't see soldiers like that. I
saw guys willing to give up their lives for the guys next to them.
They were drafted; many went unwillingly. They were very honorable
people. They made the best out of a truly awful situation.
Absolutely, that was the majority."</TE>
<TE>   In Vietnam-era books, Galloway and Moore saw "a lot of political
baggage, a lot of finger-pointing," Galloway said. "We thought no one
has thought to say 'thank you' to those who did serve honorably."
Their book, however, points a finger at U.S. policymakers who adopted
a disastrous strategy of aiming to win by attrition.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to the homespun tone that bothered critics of the
movie version of "We Were Soldiers," author David Halberstam ("The
Best and the Brightest") said Moore and Galloway's book spoke more
directly to the futility of the war, driving home the point that
after 305 U.S. soldiers and 3,561 Vietnamese were killed in the
battles at Ia Drang in late 1965, the soldiers withdrew from the
valley. "The terrible sacrifice and then ... gone," Halberstam said.</TE>
<TE>   The movie depicts U.S. soldiers as battered but victorious. In
reality, each side claimed victory. Though Halberstam called the book
the "single best piece of reporting on combat in war," he found the
movie more "conventional."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   How Much Realism Does the Public Want?</TE>
<TE>   Speculations about Hollywood's current motives abound. Some say
that, faced with a shifting tide, Hollywood may be trying to drape
itself in the American flag to make up for earlier left-wing
sympathies. Others think the new movies may reflect a general urge to
revise history so that Americans don't come across as losers.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, the industry respects the bottom line. "Hollywood is
the quintessential capitalist industry," said film historian Suber.
"If money is to be made with an extreme right-wing view of war in
Vietnam, I guarantee you it will be made."</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood is still gauging what the public wants and how much
graphic realism it will tolerate.</TE>
<TE>   Sony Pictures' "Black Hawk Down" raised combat gore and intensity
to new levels, MGM's Levin said. Many people before its release
"wondered whether it had gone too far," he said, but "if you look at
the box-office gross, [it] didn't hold back the success of 'Black
Hawk Down.'"</TE>
<TE>   MGM's "Windtalkers" contains scenes so violent that some viewers
at a screening at the ShoWest theater owners' convention in Las Vegas
said they had to shut their eyes. Even so, "I think 'Windtalkers' is
totally acceptable," said Levin.</TE>
<TE>   Some filmmakers already perceive the market is saturated with the
simplistic, "they're all heroes" war movies.</TE>
<TE>   It takes an average of two years to bring a project to the screen,
and with the uncertainties of the war in Afghanistan, the public mood
could change quickly, said John Davis, producer of "Behind Enemy
Lines."</TE>
<TE>   Davis said he's developing a coming-of-age film in which a
soldier's real struggle to be a hero takes place in an "artificial
context": the Korean War.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the film is finished, he anticipates the public will
be ready for a more philosophical vision of war.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Angelenos are understandably proud of Miguel Harth-Bedoya.</LD>
<LD>   We watched him win over the Los Angeles Philharmonic and its
audiences, and rise from assistant to associate conductor, his
current post. But as important as the orchestra has been to him, he
has actually made his career elsewhere.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to his Philharmonic post, he is music director of
three orchestras--in Eugene, Ore. (where it is his last season); Fort
Worth, Texas (his first season); and Auckland, New Zealand. Now his
name is starting to be mentioned for the next level of orchestra,
such as the New Jersey Symphony, which is searching for a music
director. He is increasingly popular as a guest conductor for opera
companies and symphony orchestras in America and abroad.</LD>
<TE>   As a result, Harth-Bedoya's local appearances have the quality of
snapshots of his artistic growth. Sometimes those appearances with
the Philharmonic have seemed a bit too glossy, too posed. He has an
undeniable flair for lightweight, colorful repertory. But his
association with it also presents the danger of typecasting.</TE>
<TE>   That was not the case Thursday night with the Philharmonic. His
program at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion may not have been the
weightiest imaginable, but it demonstrated scope, substance and
imagination by containing two works by Pulitzer Prize-winning
American composers--John Harbison and Joseph Schwantner--along with
Dvorak's Seventh Symphony. All three pieces called for color,
especially Schwantner's Percussion Concerto, for which Evelyn Glennie
was soloist.</TE>
<TE>   But there's more to them than that. Indeed, the Dvorak symphony is
exactly the kind of repertory work that can show the direction of
Harth-Bedoya's development. This is the first great Dvorak symphony
(although some think that the Sixth is). Written in D minor, it is
darker and more dramatic than the two symphonies that followed. It is
also Dvorak's most nationalistic symphony, with its subtext of Czech
patriotism and anti-Hapsburg sentiment. Conductors often compete to
see who can wring the most fervor from it.</TE>
<TE>   Harth-Bedoya, however, didn't so much wring as ring. The essential
character of his performance was buoyancy and momentum. The opening,
a characterization of a nationalist rally at a Prague train station,
was less fervent or furious than propulsive. Harth-Bedoya thrust the
symphony forth, like a blast-off, enjoying the lift and then, in the
lyrical second theme, basked in the floating lyricism. And throughout
the four movements, there was always the sense the dramatic intensity
and vibrant energy were there not for their own sake but to release
something else.</TE>
<TE>   It is fresh and unusual to hear this work as a rendering of growth
and bloom, but not everything seemed tight. Harth-Bedoya stopped,
ever enticingly, to smell the flowers, and sometimes he seemed to
wander slightly in the slow movement and the Finale. But he never
lingered too long, and he always picked up his step when he needed
to. The dance-lilt of the Scherzo was a pure joy. Best of all, this
is Harth-Bedoya's Dvorak and no one else's.</TE>
<TE>   Both the American pieces were written in the early '90s. Harbison,
who was the Philharmonic's composer in residence in the '80s, has
been unjustly neglected since, so it was a doubly nice gesture to
revive his "The Most Often Used Chords," given that it was composed
for the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra. That said, this enjoyable
piece, which cleverly plays around with elementary tonal devices,
came off as a bit stiff, in part, perhaps, because it was played by a
slightly too large band (somewhere between chamber orchestra and
full-sized one).</TE>
<TE>   Though not written for Glennie, it has become her vehicle, and she
made quite a spectacle of it. The composer, from Chicago, originally
made a name for himself with precious, quiet music, exquisitely
colored. His showier, more obvious side, which this concerto reveals,
is less interesting, but his color sense doesn't fail him.</TE>
<TE>   And there is certainly enough going on to keep Glennie excitingly
busy. She was in her element, dashing barefoot among instruments (set
up in front of the orchestra and behind it). Glennie and Harth-Bedoya
share a gift for rhythmic onslaught and relish color, and together,
they made a harmless concerto into tonal theater and an audience
happy.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

$12-$78, Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, 135 N. Grand Ave. (213) 850-2000.</TE>

<CX>   Philharmonic work--A review of the Los Angeles Philharmonic in
Saturday's Calendar mistakenly gave the impression that the work
described as a vehicle for percussionist Evelyn Glennie was John
Harbison's "The Most Often Used Chords." In fact, the work being referred
to was Joseph Schwantner's "Percussion Concerto."</CX>

<LD>An outgoing young girl withdraws in class, frustrated at her
inability to answer questions. A bright, exceptionally articulate
little boy is unable to learn to read. An unusually creative
11-year-old forgets what she's doing from one moment to the next and
is so socially inept that she has no friends.</LD>
<LD>   They are the kids who can't keep up, the lonely kids, the kids who
get in fights and disrupt class, or are picked on and bullied.
Teachers often don't have time for them. They're called "lazy" and
"stupid" by adults and peers. Soon, they believe it.</LD>
<LD>   The subject of learning disabilities is often reduced to a
polarizing, sound-bite debate over the rising use of Ritalin and
other drugs to treat them. The documentary, "Misunderstood Minds,"
however, airing at 10 p.m. Sunday on KCET-TV, is an intimate,
compelling reminder of the anguish and long-lasting damage suffered
by children whose learning and behavioral problems are very real.</LD>
<TE>   It is also an encouraging look at how lives can turn around when
help is forthcoming.</TE>
<TE>   Produced and directed by "Frontline" filmmaker Michael Kirk, and
hosted by ABC "Nightline" correspondent Chris Bury, the report spans
three years in the lives of five children and their families. It also
hears from the doctors, psychologists, psychiatrists, speech and
language pathologists.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the five have hopeful results; one teenage boy's future is
less certain. His serious learning disability wasn't caught until the

<HD>Branagh Excels in 'Richard III'</HD>
<DH>The actor captures the audience from the outset with a
chilling, poignant performance in Sheffield. In London, Jude Law
struggles in 'Dr. Faustus.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATT WOLF</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>SHEFFIELD, England</DL>
<LD>Two British actors have returned to the stage with different results.</LD>
<LD>   Kenneth Branagh is playing to sold-out audiences at the Crucible
Theatre, giving one of the most bracing performances of his career in
"Richard III." But Jude Law's appearance at London's Young Vic as the
title character in Christopher Marlowe's "Dr. Faustus" is just plain
boring.</LD>
<LD>   From the very outset, Branagh's Richard captures a startled
audience. The actor delivers Richard's celebrated opening soliloquy
clad only in underpants, his body strapped into a contraption that
looks like a cross between a medieval rack and some frighteningly
chic bed frame.</LD>
<TE>   The impact is twofold. It presents Richard almost literally laid
bare as he is laying himself bare to the audience. That first speech
tips us off to the malformed wretch that Richard feels himself to be,
well before he begins exerting the venomous charm that will
ultimately carry him through to the throne.</TE>
<TE>   Physically, you get the disturbing sense that Richard is trying to
have himself stretched, as if a machine could put right the misshapen
body that has contributed to poisoning his spirit.</TE>
<TE>   In front of the various women whom Richard woos, he stands
stiff-backed and upright. Elsewhere, alone and unclothed, he's a
pitiful, pasty-faced figure with a bum leg and a limp and useless arm
that, at one point, finds him crawling abjectly across the stage.</TE>
<TE>   As directed by Michael Grandage, Branagh's Richard is funny,
chilling and poignant all at once.</TE>
<TE>   The first two qualities are common enough in a play about so
enjoyably vile a central figure. For all Richard's murderous intent
as he climbs to the throne, he is a malevolently funny showman whose
asides to the audience win comic respect.</TE>
<TE>   But Branagh goes well beyond this evil jokester; he presents a
Richard wrestling with endless pain. Nor is the performance just
about physical trappings; Richard's ravaged soul remains as visible
as his sad, stooped body.</TE>
<TE>   Branagh, who started in theater, has returned to the stage after a
10-year absence during which he pursued a film career as an actor and
director. His re-emergence is a revelation.</TE>
<TE>   Less successful is Law's return to the stage after a two-year
absence. Law is starring in a Young Vic Theatre Company production of
Marlowe's infrequently staged play.</TE>
<TE>   The play traces its own deathly arc in which the scholarly Faustus
sells his soul to the devil and faces a life of damnation. Law works
hard to diminishing effect, and his performance turns out to be a
bore.</TE>
<TE>   The low comic interludes--such as the arrival of the Seven Deadly
Sins--in director David Lan's production make for unfunny viewing.</TE>
<TE>   And where Branagh's supporting cast mostly shines (Barbara Jefford
is especially good as a vengeful Queen Margaret), the six actors who
appear with Law are tiresome.</TE>
<TE>   You have to admire the stamina of a performer who has chosen a
leap into the deep end of the dramatic repertoire. As it happens, Law
was educated at the same south London school as the first-ever
Faustus--Edward Alleyn, back in 1589.</TE>
<TE>   But despite a charismatic star's valiant efforts, the play just
sits there. It runs through May 4.</TE>

<HD>'Light' Smokes Are Latest Legal Target</HD>
<DH>Tobacco: Oregon verdict is industry's first defeat on
low-tar cigarettes as regulatory and court actions heat up.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRON LEVIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Over the last three decades, cigarette makers have stemmed the loss
of customers by promoting low-tar, or "light," cigarettes, enabling
countless smokers to switch brands rather than quit. But the savvy
marketing strategy has triggered a recent surge of legal and
regulatory attacks on the tobacco industry worldwide.</LD>
<LD>   The companies stand accused of promoting the illusion that light
brands mean less intake of tar, the soup of cancer-causing compounds
in tobacco smoke. Tobacco officials deny deceiving anyone.</LD>
<LD>   But a jury in Portland, Ore., last week dealt the industry its
first defeat in a case focused on the marketing of light
cigarettes--hitting Philip Morris Cos. with a $150-million punitive
damages verdict. Light-cigarette class actions are pending in nearly
a dozen states, including California, and soon will be filed in
others.</LD>
<TE>   Brazil recently banned use of the words "mild," "light" and
"ultra-light" on cigarette packages and ads, on grounds the terms are
inherently misleading. The European Union has voted for similar
restrictions, though it remains for member nations to ratify them.
Canadian authorities are weighing a ban on the terms, and many
nations are seeking to include a similar prohibition in the Framework
Convention on Tobacco Control, the global tobacco treaty being
negotiated under the auspices of the World Health Organization.</TE>
<TE>   In recent court papers, the U.S. Justice Department said banning
the terms is one of the goals of its multibillion-dollar racketeering
suit against the tobacco industry.</TE>
<TE>   At issue are the tar and nicotine numbers that appear in cigarette
ads--and the industry's failure to acknowledge, until recently, that
smokers often inhale much more tar than do the smoking machines that
generate the numbers. Research by industry and independent scientists
has shown that after switching to lights, smokers continue to
regulate their nicotine dose by drawing deeper, inhaling more often
and even blocking with their fingers the air dilution holes in
cigarette filters.</TE>
<TE>   As a result of this pattern, known as compensation, the
theoretical benefits of lower-tar cigarettes are reduced or
eliminated.</TE>
<TE>   A 1975 Philip Morris memo, provided to jurors in the Oregon case,
shows that cigarette makers have known this for a long time.</TE>
<TE>   Summarizing tests in which smokers puffed regular Marlboros as
well as Marlboro Lights, the memo said smokers of the light
cigarettes inhaled deeper and more often and therefore "did not
achieve any reduction in smoke intake by smoking a cigarette ...
normally considered lower in delivery." These findings, the memo
said, were "in agreement with" previous tests.</TE>
<TE>   In a major report on light cigarettes issued in November, the
National Cancer Institute said the steady decline in tar yields in
the average cigarette has had "little meaning for the smoker,"
because of the difference in the way machines and people smoke.</TE>
<TE>   "The reality that many smokers chose these products as an
alternative to cessation ... makes this deception an urgent public
health issue," the report said.</TE>
<TE>   Tobacco companies began rolling out "low-delivery" brands about 30
years ago, and "lights"--cigarettes with machine-measured tar yields
of 15 milligrams or less--now have a market share of about 87%,
according to the U.S. Office on Smoking and Health. Like a number of
other brands, the country's top-selling smoke, Marlboro Lights, has
the low-tar designation embedded in its name.</TE>
<TE>   But the introduction of light brands merely accelerated a trend
that began in the 1950s, when filtered cigarettes were launched in
response to the first cancer scare. During the last 50 years,
machine-measured tar yields have declined more than 60%.</TE>
<TE>   As cigarette makers are quick to point out, health authorities
were firmly behind this trend.</TE>
<TE>   In 1981, for example, the annual Surgeon General's report called
on smokers to switch to low-tar brands if they would not or could not
quit.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, health authorities were aware that compensation could
occur in the switch from harsher to lighter-tasting brands. But they
say they did not grasp the extent of this--nor comprehend the
addictive power of nicotine--until millions of internal industry
documents were disclosed in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   But even staunch tobacco foes say there is blame to go around. The
Federal Trade Commission adopted the official machine-test method in
the 1960s to standardize tar and nicotine measurements. Over the
years, the FTC was warned the results could be misleading, including
by the industry.</TE>
<TE>   "There is absolutely no excuse for the FTC not to have taken
action in some fashion," said Judith Wilkenfeld, a former FTC
official who now is director of international programs for the
Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, an anti-smoking group in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The agency "should long ago have taken its imprimatur off the test
methodology" or else required the industry to tell consumers in ads
"that these numbers were misleading," Wilkenfeld said.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1997, the FTC, in consultation with the Department of Health
and Human Services, has been trying to revise the test method.</TE>
<TE>   During the last couple of years, tobacco companies have begun
putting information about the compensation phenomenon on their Web
sites. Two of the three top U.S. manufacturers--Philip Morris and
Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.--also print a small disclaimer in
their ads, noting that tar and nicotine intake vary with the way
people smoke.</TE>
<TE>   The companies say the attacks are groundless.</TE>
<TE>   "Those cigarettes were never advertised as being safe" and come
with the same health warnings as all other brands, said William
Ohlemeyer, a Philip Morris vice president and associate general
counsel.</TE>
<TE>   The Portland jury found these arguments unpersuasive, ordering
Philip Morris to pay $168,000 in compensatory damages and $150million
in punitive damages.</TE>
<TE>   The case was brought by the family of Michelle Schwarz, who smoked
Philip Morris' low-tar Merit brand before dying of lung cancer at the
age of 53.</TE>
<TE>   Since the punitive damages award was nearly 900 times greater than
actual damages, the trial judge is likely to pare the amount, and
Philip Morris has vowed to appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the outcome, it's unclear whether the case represents a
major new area of legal vulnerability for the industry. Last year,
Brown &amp; Williamson won a similar light-cigarette case in South
Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   Still, light-cigarette class actions are popping up across the
country--with cases now on file in Illinois, Massachusetts, Florida,
New Jersey, Ohio, West Virginia, Tennessee, Missouri, Minnesota and
in Alameda County Superior Court in Oakland, where a case was filed
against Philip Morris on Oct. 31. So far, courts in three of the
states have certified the cases as class actions. Steve Sheller, a
Pennsylvania attorney involved in the cases, said additional claims
soon will be filed in Utah, Kansas, New Hampshire and Vermont.</TE>
<TE>   The suits have been filed under state consumer protection laws and
seek reimbursement for billions of dollars spent on light cigarettes.
According to plaintiffs' lawyers, people should get their money back
because cigarette makers deceived them about the actual tar
deliveries of the cigarettes.</TE>

<HD>Volcker Plans to Make Case for Andersen</HD>
<DH>Accounting: Former Fed chief hopes to get charge dropped,
but prosecutors seem to have other ideas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS S. MULLIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul A. Volcker said Friday that
accounting firm Andersen, having accepted his reform proposal,
planned to open talks with the Justice Department over dropping its
indictment in the Enron Corp. case.</LD>
<LD>   But there was no indication that the Justice Department, incensed
by Andersen's legal and public relations tactics, had any intention
of backing off. Federal investigators appeared to be working toward
getting a second indictment that would name individuals instead of
just the firm, one former federal prosecutor said.</LD>
<LD>   Volcker, whose team hopes to rescue and then govern the stricken
Big Five accounting concern, said at a Manhattan news conference that
a "critical mass" of partners supports his plan for a slimmed-down,
ethics-friendly Andersen but that the idea won't work unless the
criminal charges were withdrawn.</LD>
<TE>   Noting that the Easter and Passover holidays are times of
"reflection and penance and resurrection," Volcker said Andersen's
posture toward the Justice Department was "not a matter of
confrontation but of cooperating together to get reform in the common
interest."</TE>
<TE>   The chairman of Arthur Andersen Worldwide said time was running
out for the U.S. partnership to cut a deal with the Justice
Department for it to have any hope of maintaining its global network
of affiliates. Many overseas affiliates already have announced plans
to split from Andersen and ally with Big Five rivals such as KPMG or
Ernst &amp; Young.</TE>
<TE>   Aldo Cardoso, Paris-based head of Andersen Worldwide, the
accounting firm's global division, said in an interview after
Volcker's news conference that it was "a matter of days, if not
hours" before the bulk of the foreign affiliates defected. There
would be no way to keep the network together if Andersen remained
under indictment, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen has lost nearly 100 clients in the wake of the Enron
scandal. Its chief executive and worldwide managing partner, Joseph
F. Berardino, said Tuesday that he would step down as soon as an
interim successor is named, which could come at a meeting Tuesday in
London.</TE>
<TE>   Volcker's plan, which Andersen's 1,700 U.S. partners reluctantly
embraced during a five-hour teleconference Thursday, calls for the
firm to sell its consulting business and most of its tax practice and
return to what Volcker called its "historical roots" as a pure
auditing firm.</TE>
<TE>   The makeover would remove the conflict between auditing and
consulting work that Volcker said led Andersen into its current
problems. It also would shrink the firm significantly. About 60% of
Andersen's partners are on the consulting side, said C.E. Andrews,
one of two partners selected to manage the transition under the
Volcker plan.</TE>
<TE>   Volcker could not say how many workers would lose their jobs.</TE>
<TE>   The March 14 federal indictment accuses Andersen of obstruction of
justice in what the government described as a broad effort to destroy
documents and conceal evidence of wrongdoing in the case of its
former client Enron--an effort that involved several Andersen offices
in the United States and London.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen got another black eye Monday when the government unveiled
damning details of the firm's role in an alleged cover-up of
accounting wrongdoing in the early to mid-1990s at Waste Management
Inc. Andersen settled that case in June with a record fine of $7
million and a promise to abide by securities laws in the future.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Andersen decided against settling the Enron case and
pleading guilty to criminal wrongdoing. Instead, the firm attacked
the indictment as "an extraordinary abuse of prosecutorial
discretion." It successfully pushed for an early trial date of May 6,
and it launched an advertising and promotional campaign, recruiting
legendary UCLA basketball coach John Wooden to decry the indictment.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors lashed back in a court filing Thursday that accused
Andersen of trying to "flood the public record with slanted and
outright false" statements about the government's case.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen's aggressiveness may have backfired and given the
government even more reason to stand its ground, John C. Coffee, a
securities law professor at Columbia University, said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "The [Justice Department's] fear would be that if they drop the
indictment at this stage, any future indictment of a corporation will
invite the same kind of public relations battle, cheerleader teams
and drama school for corporate executives," Coffee said.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department spokesman Bryan Sierra said Friday that the
government's position regarding Andersen had not shifted, "regardless
of changes they make or who's in charge."</TE>
<TE>   Any settlement must contain three elements, he said: "meaningful
reform, cooperation and full acceptance of responsibility."</TE>
<TE>   Legal experts said the government would not consider anything
short of a guilty plea as full acceptance of responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen believes that a criminal plea--which would bar it from
auditing public companies--would doom the firm.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors disclosed this week that they had impaneled a special
grand jury to "continue investigation of all criminal activity
related to the demise of Enron."</TE>
<TE>   Former federal prosecutor Christopher Bebel, a partner in Houston
law firm Shepherd, Smith &amp; Bebel, believes that prosecutors are
considering indicting individuals, which would strengthen their case
against the audit firm.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the various factions involved in a potential settlement
of claims against Andersen and Enron remained far from a deal, said
Eric D. Green, a Boston University law professor appointed to mediate
the legal dispute involving former Enron employees, shareholders and
the two firms. He said that "there can be no assurance that an
agreement will be reached."</TE>
<TE>   Also Friday, Andersen said its insurance carrier refused to pay
$217 million to settle lawsuits stemming from its audit of a failed
Arizona investment group. An Andersen spokesman declined to say why
the payment was refused, but the action raised a question about the
firm's ability to pay future settlements.</TE>

<HD>DoubleClick Agrees to Settle Lawsuits Over Internet Privacy</HD>
<DH>Courts: Advertising firm says it will purge information
collected about computer users' Web-surfing habits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>DoubleClick Inc. said Friday that it will pay $1.8 million to settle
lawsuits claiming that the largest Internet advertising firm violated
privacy laws by gathering marketing information about computer users.</LD>
<LD>   Many of the suits were dismissed last year by a federal judge in
New York, but plaintiffs were appealing the ruling of U.S. District
Judge Naomi Buchwald. As part of the settlement, the plaintiffs will
drop the appeal and their pending suits in state courts in Texas and
California.</LD>
<LD>   The suits claim DoubleClick's online profiling--the practice of
gathering marketing information on consumers' Web-surfing
habits--violates privacy laws. As such, the lawsuits were a threat to
DoubleClick's basic business.</LD>
<TE>   Besides the $1.8 million in legal fees that DoubleClick will pay
to plaintiffs' lawyers, the company will formalize
"privacy-protection" policies it adopted in recent years. "The
company's view of the world changed a great deal after the lawsuits
were filed," said plaintiffs' lawyer Seth Lesser.</TE>
<TE>   DoubleClick said in a regulatory filing Friday that it's
cooperating with several state attorneys general investigating its
data collection and ad service practices.</TE>
<TE>   New York-based DoubleClick sells data it collects about computer
users to advertising firms so they can target online ads. The
company's shares Thursday closed unchanged at $11.99 on Nasdaq. They
are up 5.7% this year.</TE>
<TE>   In July 2000, DoubleClick and other companies that amass data on
Web surfers agreed to take steps to improve consumer-privacy

<HD>For Sale: Fickle Shoppers' Loyalty</HD>
<DH>Retail: Discount stores are working on ways to hang on to
consumers who move from one chain to another.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLIE EARNEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For discount retailers, Colleen Aprati represents both their fondest
dream and their worse nightmare.</LD>
<LD>   The south Orange County resident has a household income of
$110,000, but she is perfectly comfortable shopping in big, boxy
stores with very few frills. Discounters would love to snag customers
like her.</LD>
<LD>   The problem is, how to keep them?</LD>
<TE>   "I have no loyalty, no loyalty at all," the 46-year-old
stay-at-home mom said recently as she shopped at a Target in Foothill
Ranch. Aprati said she could just as easily have been at Wal-Mart, or
Kmart for that matter. "I go to all three," she said.</TE>
<TE>   As discounters and other retailers step up their battle for
consumers, especially in lucrative markets such as Southern
California, they're finding that there are many shoppers like Aprati.</TE>
<TE>   Egged on by a wobbly economy and growing options, consumers are
insisting on low prices--especially for basic goods--reliable quality
and a pleasant shopping experience. Yet discount shoppers appear to
be particularly fickle. Analysts say they'll often prowl anywhere for
the best deal, and they're willing to take the time to find
it--switching from one store to another without batting an eye.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no such thing as loyalty anymore," said Sarah Scheuer,
spokeswoman for the National Retail Federation in Washington. "It
could be any retailer who steps in and fills the void, if they have
the right price, the right product and the right level of customer
service--consistently."</TE>
<TE>   How to build or instill loyalty has become a major challenge for
retailers as they expand and jockey for position. Kohl's, considered
a hybrid of a department and discount store, is expected to open at
least 30 stores in Southern California next March; Target is putting
up nearly a dozen more stores in the state; and Wal-Mart is building
3 million square feet of warehouse space in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   To attract and keep shoppers, retailers are trying to claim the
lowest prices, increasingly offering jazzy brands and targeting
specific consumers with ads and other promotions.</TE>
<TE>   Target Stores Inc.'s attempts to lasso customers include a credit
card program that allows customers to accumulate points as they use
the co-branded Target Visa card, and receive a discount certificate
when they reach a specific threshold of expenditures.</TE>
<TE>   Price, of course, has always mattered to shoppers, a reality that
pushed Wal-Mart Stores Inc. to a level of success so lofty that it's
now the world's largest company. But recently, analysts say,
consumers have become even more driven to find bargains as economic
uncertainties made them more cautious and recession-driven markdowns
trained them to seek out sales.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart Corp., once the discount retail leader, has felt the wrath
of demanding shoppers. The Michigan-based retailer, which filed for
bankruptcy protection this year, saw many of its customers flee as
its stores became shoddy and poorly stocked. Kmart is reorganizing by
closing poorly performing stores and sprucing up its image.</TE>
<TE>   Target has been the most aggressive to cater to the affluent
consumer. The retailer says its typical shopper has a household
income of $49,000, considerably higher than the average in the United
States. Wal-Mart also is moving to attract more of the high-end
market.</TE>
<TE>   "I think people with money are feeling very smart about going to
Sam's Warehouse or Costco and filling up their BMW trunk with a case
of tomato juice just to say, 'Aren't I smart?'" said Tom Holliday,
president of Retail Advertising &amp; Marketing Assn., a division of the
National Retail Federation.</TE>
<TE>   One strategy discounters are taking to build loyalty is through
brands. Target, for example, has been marketing itself as the cool
choice in discount shopping, partly by pairing with names like
Mossimo, a youth-oriented Southern California clothing brand that is
sold only at Target stores.</TE>
<TE>   "People will be wearing a pair of zany warmup pants that cost
$180, and they have on a $12 Mossimo shirt from Target," Holliday
said. "They don't care if it all matches up in terms of all being
expensive."</TE>
<TE>   Kari Reinhardt, 30, said her favorite store is Nordstrom, but she
buys toys, snacks, cleaning supplies and lingerie from Target because
it's "kind of the cool store."</TE>
<TE>   "Ever since they introduced the [Mossimo] line, I buy clothes
here," said Reinhardt, who is the mother of twin 8-year-olds, Matthew
and Brandon.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Riverside homemaker is selective about
discounters--she said Kmart seems like a place her grandmother would
have shopped--Reinhardt is open to trying Kohl's when it comes to
town. She thinks she'll like Kohl's because it is sometimes compared
to another store she frequents, Mervyn's, a unit of Target.</TE>
<TE>   "Mervyn's, Target, Gap," Reinhardt said, tugging at the silver
belt, pink T-shirt and white shorts she was wearing, to reveal where
each was purchased. "That would be right up my alley. Absolutely."</TE>
<TE>   Mission Viejo resident Pam Kennedy, 42, is another switch-hitter.
The mom shopped recently at Target, where she took particular note of
Waverly, a well-known brand of bedding. She said her last lawn chairs
were the Martha Stewart brand, from Kmart.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to run to Wal-Mart next for garden furniture," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, there are plenty of shoppers who stick determinedly to
a favored store. Esther Heredia of Santa Ana loves her nearby
Wal-Mart.</TE>
<TE>   "This is my store," said the 63-year-old grandmother of 12, who on
a recent shopping trip had collected T-shirts, a diaper bag and
pillowcases. "I like the prices. If I have a little extra [money],
here I am."</TE>
<TE>   The growing Latino market has become a focal point for retailers
trying to build loyalty in places such as Southern California. Kmart
recently announced a radio advertising campaign to target the
multicultural consumer.</TE>
<TE>   The company said that nationally about one-third of its shoppers
are Latinos and blacks. The ads, which will feature music by Jose
Feliciano, among others, are intended to "build an emotional bond"
with shoppers and "drive consumer loyalty," the company said.</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart, meanwhile, has continued to emphasize the basics: low
prices and well-stocked shelves. The company uses timeworn techniques
that reinforce a down-home feeling: Greeters are stationed at the
door, and the store manager's telephone number is printed on the
receipt.</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart probably will draw--and keep--more California shoppers in
the future by opening Supercenters, a format that includes a full
line of groceries.</TE>
<TE>   "You'll be looking at Supercenters coming to California and
Southern California in late 2003 and coming full force in the years
2004 through 2007," said Burt Flickenger, whose Connecticut
consulting firm Reach Marketing works with discounters and their
suppliers.</TE>
<TE>   In rapidly growing Corona, where Kmart, Wal-Mart and Target all
exist within a three-mile radius, residents bemoan the fact that a
shuttered House2Home store couldn't make it, and they eagerly await
the opening of perhaps two Kohl's stores in their city next year.</TE>
<TE>   Christine Lessing, 53, who works from her home in Corona, said
she's ready to give Kohl's a try.</TE>
<TE>   "If another store would come, in the right price range, I think
people would welcome it," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Another high-growth area that discounters are targeting is Fresno,
where blistering competition turned the three Kmart stores there into
losing propositions and caused that company to shutter the stores.</TE>
<TE>   Fresno also has three Wal-Marts and four Target stores, two of
which recently opened.</TE>
<TE>   It's a matter of the "survival of the fittest," said Allison
Larsen, a spokeswoman for the Fresno Economic Development Corp.</TE>

<HD>Baby Boomers Fuel Surge in Drug Spending</HD>
<DH>Health: Demand for medications to treat high cholesterol,
depression, arthritis and ulcers boosts sales.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The growing demand for prescription drugs, especially among baby
boomers determined to remain healthy and active, is driving the rise
in prescription spending as much as the industry's price increases,
according to data released this week.</LD>
<LD>   And health-care experts say that trend probably won't abate,
suggesting that prescription drug spending will continue to push up
overall health-care costs.</LD>
<LD>   The drug industry counters that using more and better drugs
reduces other health-care costs, offsetting the rise in spending on
prescriptions.</LD>
<TE>   In a report released Friday, the National Institute for Health
Care Management said prescription drug spending rose 17.1% in 2001,
the fourth consecutive year of increases of at least 17%.</TE>
<TE>   The study said about one-third of the increase was linked to price
hikes, with the rest attributed to more prescriptions being written
or to patients switching to more- expensive drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Seven of the top 10 drug types--in terms of 2001 retail sales--are
used extensively by older Americans, said the institute's research
director, Steven Findlay.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly a part of the rise is due to that generation merging into
its middle-aged years. Most people suffering from depression are
older. Those most vulnerable to the side effects of older anti-ulcer
drugs [and thereby likely to switch to newer, more-expensive ones]
are also older. Cholesterol-fighting drugs are definitely
age-related," Findlay said, citing the three biggest drug classes in
2001 sales.</TE>
<TE>   Other major categories of drugs used heavily by older consumers
are anti-arthritis, anti-hypertension, narcotic painkillers and oral
diabetes medications.</TE>
<TE>   Findlay said the shifting demographics probably were a factor in
the sharp rise in the number of prescriptions written, which climbed
from 1.9 billion 10 years ago to 3.1billion in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "Quite a few of these are for chronic conditions affecting older
Americans," Findlay said.</TE>
<TE>   The drug industry responded to the study by saying that
medications play a huge role in creating healthier Americans who
require less care.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of 'Another Year of Escalating Costs,' NIHCM should have
called the study 'Another Year of Improving Health Care,'" said Alan
F. Holmer, president of the Washington-based Pharmaceutical
Manufacturers Assn., an industry trade group.</TE>
<TE>   "The study reflects the fact that more people are now being
treated for diseases such as diabetes, asthma, depression and
elevated cholesterol," Holmer said. "New medicines for these diseases
can save lives and get people back to work faster."</TE>
<TE>   That sentiment was echoed by Frank Lichtenberg, a Columbia
University professor of finance and economics whose research on the
efficacy of new patented drugs has been funded in part by the
pharmaceutical industry.</TE>
<TE>   Using a government database of more than 20,000 Americans,
Lichtenberg said he found clear evidence through 1998 that
medications recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration
were not only more effective than older drugs but resulted in
healthier outcomes and fewer acute-care emergencies.</TE>
<TE>   That more than compensated for the higher cost of the drugs,
Lichtenberg said.</TE>
<TE>   But several experts disagreed, saying the latest and most
expensive drugs haven't been around long enough to determine their
clinical effect.</TE>
<TE>   With the large baby boom group in middle age, the number of acute
health episodes, such as heart attacks and cancer, probably won't
diminish, they say.</TE>
<TE>   "Some drugs definitely offset or reduce other health-care costs,"
said Eric P. Michael, a Minneapolis-based pharmaceutical expert for
William M. Mercer Co.</TE>
<TE>   He cited the leukemia drug Gleevec, which has helped many patients
avoid the need for painful bone marrow transplants.</TE>
<TE>   "But others clearly don't offset," Michael said. "There is no
clear-cut medical benefit that warrants the increase in price, and
the average consumer won't know which is which."</TE>

<HD>Consumer Spending Revs Up in February</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. consumer spending rose in February at the fastest pace since a
car-sales-led surge in October, as the economy sailed ahead at full
tilt in the early stages of its emergence from recession.</LD>
<LD>   Spending grew 0.6% last month after a 0.5% gain in January, the
Commerce Department reported.</LD>
<LD>   The gain was led by purchases of big-ticket items such as cars and
furniture and outpaced the 0.5% rise projected by private economists.</LD>
<TE>   "It looks as if the economy is in a fairly healthy state of
recovery," said Bill Cheney, chief economist at John Hancock
Financial Services in Boston. "These numbers are a lot better than
one would have been expecting a month or two ago."</TE>
<TE>   February's spending increase was the sharpest since a 3% buying
jump in October, which occurred as consumers flocked to car showrooms
to take advantage of no-interest financing deals.</TE>
<TE>   Growth in Americans' incomes appeared to encourage the enthusiasm
for shopping. Personal income-- which includes wages, salaries and
money from other sources such as rents and interest on bank
deposits--climbed 0.6% in February after a 0.5% rise in the prior
month.</TE>
<TE>   The income rise last month was the biggest since December 2000 and
was double the 0.3% increase expected by U.S. economists in a Reuters
survey.</TE>
<TE>   Taken together, the income and spending figures added to growing
evidence of a surprisingly strong momentum in the U.S. economy as it
pulls out of a mild recession that began last March.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer spending remained resilient throughout the slump and--as
evidenced by Friday's report as well as consumer confidence numbers
that have rolled out this month--is showing no sign of tailing off
just yet.</TE>
<TE>   A closely watched gauge of consumer sentiment by the University of
Michigan bolted higher in March to 95.7, the highest reading since
December 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Spending in February was especially strong in the key category of
durable goods, such as cars, furniture and appliances.</TE>
<TE>   Durable goods spending jumped 1.7% in February, rebounding from a
0.8% drop in January. Purchases of nondurable goods rose 0.3% in the
latest month, while service expenditures grew 0.6%.</TE>
<TE>   Because consumer purchases drive two-thirds of U.S. economic
activity, the spending number bodes well for gross domestic product
in the first quarter, which ends Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the Commerce Department ratcheted up its estimate of
gross domestic product for the fourth quarter of last year, revising
the pace of growth to 1.7% from a previously reported 1.4%, cementing
beliefs the economy had entered 2002 already in recovery and on sure
footing.</TE>

<HD>New Enron Bonus Plan Draws Fire</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Enron Corp. asked a Bankruptcy Court judge Friday for permission to
hand out up to $137 million in bonuses and severance payments to
remaining employees over the next year.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal drew immediate fire from a lawyer representing former
employees, who said it is unfair to more than 4,000 fired Enron
workers who got about $5,600 each in severance.</LD>
<LD>   The proposed retention and severance plan covers about 1,700
employees and could end up costing $47.4 million to $137 million
depending on the success of Enron's push to sell assets, the company
said. The new bonus plan is potentially even more generous than the
$55 million paid to about 550 people Nov. 30, two days before Enron
filed the largest corporate bankruptcy in U.S. history.</LD>
<TE>   Critics have demanded that Enron and its creditor committee
challenge those early bonuses, but no action has been taken. Enron
said Friday that the creditor committee has approved the new bonus
and severance plan and has agreed not to challenge bonuses already
paid to any employee who remains with the company through Aug. 31.</TE>
<TE>   Enron said it needs to pay the latest round of retention and
incentive bonuses and to provide a severance plan to keep key
employees laboring at the task of salvaging a smaller version of the
company.</TE>
<TE>   "For Enron to successfully reorganize the viable power and
pipeline business and to liquidate certain non-core assets to
maximize value for our creditors, we need to ensure that our critical
employees are committed to the completion of these tasks," Enron
interim Chief Executive Stephen F. Cooper said.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Lowell Peterson, who represents several laid-off Enron
workers, acknowledged that retention bonuses are not unusual in
bankruptcy cases, but added: "It's the enormous disparity that
bothers me."</TE>
<TE>   "We have people who can't afford medicine" after losing their
Enron jobs, Peterson said. "What I have a problem with is the
creditor committee absolutely opposing any severance for thousands of
employees, but then saying, 'Yeah go ahead and pay something like
$137 million to a handful of executives.'"</TE>
<TE>   Calls to lawyers for the creditor committee were not returned
Friday. A hearing is scheduled for April 12 on a motion to pay former
Enron workers as much as $30,000 each, Peterson said.</TE>
<TE>   The Enron plan breaks into three pools:</TE>
<TE>   * Retention bonuses for nearly 1,300 employees valued at about $40
million. These are paid quarterly over the next year and are based on
each eligible employee's salary.</TE>
<TE>   * Severance benefits valued at up to $7 million. The 1,700
eligible employees would each receive at least $4,500 and as much as
eight weeks of pay.</TE>
<TE>   * An unusual "liquidation incentive" payment plan tied to how much
cash Enron employees generate through asset sales, which could total
as little as $7.4 million or as much as $90 million. Between 150 and
200 Enron employees will participate, Enron spokesman Eric Thode
said.</TE>
<TE>   Enron's management committee, a group of about 20 top executives
including Chief Operating Officer Jeffrey McMahon, are not included
in the bonus plan, Thode said. Also not included are about 21,000
employees of Enron subsidiaries that have not filed for bankruptcy
protection.</TE>
<TE>   Kenneth N. Klee, a UCLA law professor who specializes in
bankruptcy, said he has never seen a bonus plan tied to asset sales.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost the kind of commission you would give to an
auctioneer or a liquidation agent," Klee said.</TE>
<TE>   "Generally, a turnaround manager would be compensated for that.
However, it aligns incentives. Those who are doing the work get
paid."</TE>

<HD>Purchases of Company Stock by U.S. Executives Rise 8.8%</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. executives and directors made open-market purchases of $924
million of shares in their companies in the first quarter, an 8.8%
increase from a year earlier, as the outlook for earnings improved.</LD>
<LD>   AOL Time Warner Inc. Chairman Stephen Case, Tyco International
Ltd. Chairman Dennis Kozlowski and officers of other companies whose
stocks have plunged led the buying, according to the Washington
Service, which tracks insider buying and selling via filings made
with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</LD>
<LD>   Investors like to see executives buy shares in the open market, as
opposed to acquiring stock via options, because it suggests strong
conviction about future performance.</LD>
<TE>   "Increased buying is definitely a good sign," said Phil Larkins,
market strategist for Legacy South Inc., which manages about $400
million in assets. "Insider buying tends to accelerate when the
economic outlook and earnings outlook is positive."</TE>
<TE>   Corporate profits are expected to rebound this year after diving
in last year's recession.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest executive buyer in the quarter was Omega Healthcare
Investors Inc. director Donald McNamara, who paid $31.8 million for
10.9 million shares of the real estate investment trust. McNamara
didn't immediately return a call seeking comment. Company spokesman
Bob Stephenson declined to comment. Omega shares have fallen 13% this
year and have lost more than 60% of their value in the last two
years.</TE>
<TE>   At AOL, the largest Internet and media company, Case bought
1million shares for $24.1 million, which "underscores the confidence
I have in the company and its growth prospects," he said. AOL's
shares have fallen 26% this year after advertising sales fell more
than expected and revenue increases slowed for its online service.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco's Kozlowski paid $14.7 million for 500,000 shares of the No.
1 maker of electronic connectors because "the company is
substantially undervalued by the marketplace," he said. Tyco has
dropped 45% this year amid concerns about its accounting methods and
possible conflicts of interest on its board.</TE>
<TE>   Personal sales of stock by insiders also declined in the first
quarter. Total sales fell 37% from a year earlier to $8.86 billion,
according to Washington Service.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say the fewer sales in part reflect the end of the bubble
in shares of Internet, computer and telecommunications equipment
companies. But the decline also could indicate that many executives
believe their stocks are undervalued at current prices.</TE>
<TE>   The dollar value of insider stock sales always far exceeds the
value of open-market purchases because the sales data include stocks
acquired through options.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft Corp. officials led insider sales in the first quarter,
as they have for the last six years. Shares of the largest software
company rose 53% last year, making the stock the top performer in the
Dow Jones industrial average.</TE>
<TE>   Founder Bill Gates reported sales of $556.7 million in the
quarter, topping all sellers, according to Washington Service. Gates
has a regular program in which he periodically sells a small fraction
of his Microsoft holdings to diversify his investments, said Caroline
Boren, a company spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet Healthcare Corp. Chairman Jeffrey Barbakow sold 2 million
shares of the second-biggest U.S. hospital chain for $130 million.
The executive exercised options and sold shares "for personal estate
planning reasons and to assure that his exercise was done in a
careful, orderly fashion before the 10-year option grant expired in
June 2003," the Santa Barbara-based company said in a statement.</TE>

<HD>Kmart Posts $753-Million Loss After Filing for Chapter 11</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kmart Corp., the biggest U.S. retailer to file for bankruptcy, had a
$753-million loss in the five weeks after it sought protection from
creditors as consumers abandoned the discount chain in favor of
rivals.</LD>
<LD>   The results include an $815-million write-down for tax benefits
that were lost because of the company's bankruptcy, Kmart said in a
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</LD>
<LD>   This is the first time the retailer has provided details about its
financial condition since filing for Chapter 11 on Jan. 22. Kmart
sought bankruptcy protection after holiday sales fell and key
suppliers, such as grocery distributor Fleming Cos., halted shipments
because of concerns about being paid.</LD>
<TE>   "Unless they can demonstrate that they're taking steps to
recapture market share, this is not a very good omen," said Kurt
Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Trend Report.</TE>
<TE>   Sales at stores open at least a year declined 0.1% in January and
11% in February, Kmart said in the filing. In contrast, February
same-store sales jumped 10% at larger rival Wal-Mart Stores Inc., and
8.5% at Target Corp.</TE>
<TE>   The company had gains of $138 million from canceling leases on
stores that had been closed and $173 million from a reduction in the
amount that must be set aside to cover general lawsuit claims,
spokesman Michael Freitag said.</TE>

<HD>Drug Companies Accused of Deceptive Lobbying</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THERESA AGOVINO</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The pharmaceutical industry is under fire for bankrolling campaigns
in several states that cultivate a grass-roots image while lobbying
for drug makers.</LD>
<LD>   Tactics have included funding an obscure group that reached out to
advocates for the poor and telemarketing blitzes that urge voters to
contact health departments and lawmakers. The common goal is to
defeat legislation that would create lists of preferred, lower-cost
drugs for Medicaid patients.</LD>
<LD>   Many advocates and public officials said they were caught off
guard by the effort. Noting that the industry traditionally uses a
more polished approach to lobbying, they see the tactics as an
attempt to hide the drug makers' involvement.</LD>
<TE>   "I've never seen anything so sophisticated and done so
deceitfully," said Adam Searing, project director of the North
Carolina Health Access Coalition.</TE>
<TE>   At least one activist who participated in events sponsored by
industry-funded groups was unaware of the connection. The Rev.
Timothy McDonald, president of the Concerned Black Clergy of Atlanta,
didn't know the Consumer Alliance received money from the industry
when he joined a news conference in March.</TE>
<TE>   Taking money from the pharmaceutical industry raises questions
about the group's integrity, he said.</TE>
<TE>   He said knowing of their involvement would not have affected his
opposition to the drug lists, known as formularies, but he added, "It
makes me really uneasy they didn't tell us."</TE>
<TE>   Pharmaceutical representatives say they intended no deceit, noting
that they had issued a news release announcing their relationship
with the Consumer Alliance.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the industry has pledged to be more forthright in lobbying
against formularies.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll have to be more upfront about our conducting an educational
campaign," said Jeff Trewhitt, a spokesman for the Pharmaceutical
Research and Manufacturers of America, the industry's
Washington-based trade organization.</TE>
<TE>   The industry argues that formularies are an unfair form of price
control and also infringe on doctors' decisions to choose the best
drug.</TE>
<TE>   Several states, including California, Florida and Michigan, have
adopted them to curb spiraling Medicaid costs. Under their programs,
pharmaceutical companies agree to provide discounts in exchange for
having their products included. Doctors need special permission to
prescribe unlisted drugs.</TE>

<HD>Library Tower Deal Disclosed</HD>
<DH>Real estate: Developer MaguirePartners buys out its partner
in West Coast's tallest building. Sale was held up by need for terror
insurance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Developer MaguirePartners said Friday that it bought out its partner
in the tallest building on the West Coast, the 73-story Library Tower
in Los Angeles, in what industry observers say is one of the largest
recent transactions involving a downtown skyscraper.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles real estate company did not disclose the value of
the deal for the building, which stands 1,017 feet tall. But people
familiar with the negotiations said the transaction, which involves
the assumption of debt and new equity investment, values the
1.3-million square-foot building at about $360million.</LD>
<LD>   MaguirePartners, which teamed with a private equity fund managed
by Credit Suisse First Boston Equity to complete the purchase, did
not identify the seller, but real estate brokers said it is the
insurance company Dai-Ichi Life of Japan.</LD>
<TE>   The Library Tower transaction was complicated by the high cost and
scarcity of terrorism insurance that came about after the Sept. 11
attacks on the World Trade Center in New York.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the fate of one of the building's largest tenants,
Andersen, came into question during negotiations as the accounting
firm's role in the Enron Corp. scandal unfolded.</TE>
<TE>   "Trying to put this deal together ... was a bear," said Robert F.
Maguire III, managing partner of MaguirePartners, which built the
12-year-old skyscraper.</TE>
<TE>   After meeting with insurers around the globe, MaguirePartners
eventually acquired terrorism coverage as part of an insurance policy
for its entire portfolio of nearly 13million square feet of
commercial space, spreading the cost over multiple buildings. The
firm did not disclose the identity of the insurance firm.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a high-profile building," said MaguirePartners advisor
and attorney Paul S. Rutter. "It was extremely important to everybody
in the transaction that the terrorism risk be covered."</TE>
<TE>   The fate of Andersen, an original tenant that occupies about 10%
of the building, remains up in the air. The firm is preparing for
widespread layoffs and faces a potential breakup as it battles
lawsuits and a charge of obstruction of justice filed by federal
officials.</TE>
<TE>   Maguire, whose company uses Andersen as its chief accountant, said
that if the firm remains intact it probably would stay in the
building because its rents--signed under long-term leases--are far
below current market prices.</TE>
<TE>   If Andersen were to vacate its space, which totals about 160,000
square feet, Maguire said, he was confident that he would find
tenants willing to pay higher rents. The building is 95% occupied,
the company said.</TE>
<TE>   For Maguire, the completion of the Library Tower purchase is part
of a remarkable comeback from the mid-1990s when his firm was in deep
financial trouble and he lost control of the giant Playa Vista
development near Marina del Rey. Taking advantage of the rebound in
Southern California real estate values in recent years, Maguire has
been able to sell properties at top dollar and refinance buildings
under favorable terms. His firm is currently building the first
office building complex at Playa Vista and a smaller commercial
project in Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   About a year ago, Maguire's company bought out Dai-Ichi's interest
in another downtown skyscraper, Gas Company Tower, which the two
partners had owned for many years.</TE>
<TE>   The cylindrical Library Tower, on 5th Street near Flower Street,
and nearby Gas Company Tower were among a handful of downtown
skyscrapers that Maguire's firm built during the 1980s and early
1990s.</TE>
<TE>   MaguirePartners has benefited from a turnaround in downtown real
estate values and a growing list of attractions, including sports
venues, restaurants and new housing. Office occupancy and leasing
rates have held up relatively well even as conditions deteriorated
dramatically for landlords on the Westside and in other major office
markets.</TE>
<TE>   "This [Library Tower] acquisition is important for our firm given
our long-standing commitment to downtown Los Angeles and our desire
to increase market share downtown," Maguire said.</TE>
<TE>   Maguire and Dai-Ichi were represented by Secured Capital and Jones
Lang La Salle, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   The transaction values Library Tower at about $275 a square foot,
according to people familiar with the deal. Although high by downtown
standards, the value pales in comparison to prices paid for some
Westside properties during the real estate run-up that began in the
late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, for example, Orange County real estate mogul Donald Bren
paid well in excess of $400 a square foot for the 34-story Fox Plaza
in Century City.</TE>

<HD>Japanese Stocks Drop at the End of Fiscal Year</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Asian markets ended the first quarter with a whimper Friday, with
Japanese stocks taking a tumble on the final trading day of that
country's fiscal year.</LD>
<LD>   Many stock, bond and commodity markets in Asia and
elsewhere--including the United States--were closed Friday in advance
of Easter Sunday or, in the case of India, for a Hindu celebration.</LD>
<LD>   The end of the Japanese financial year brought a fresh attack of
nerves to equities investors worried about massive bad loans held by
the country's banks. Tokyo's Nikkei-225 index closed down 308.17
points, or 2.7%, at 11,024.94--down 15% for the fiscal year ending
March 31.</LD>
<TE>   But the market was up 4.6% for the January-to-March quarter and
has had a 17% bounce from an 18-year low in February, leading some to
suggest better times ahead.</TE>
<TE>   The March quarter close was key for the Tokyo market as banks now
must report much lower market prices for their large stock holdings,
rather than book value. But hopes for a Friday rally were dashed by
February industrial output data showing weaker-than-expected growth.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, stocks rose modestly in Korea and Malaysia on Friday
and dipped in Thailand and Taiwan.</TE>
<TE>   The dollar slipped briefly below 132.40 yen, with some traders
saying the escalating Israeli-Palestinian conflict might be hurting
the greenback. The yen closed at 132.63 per dollar, up from 132.68 on
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The best-performing Asian market for the quarter was the tiny
Pakistan bourse. The Karachi 100-share index is up 46% this year,
fueled by hopes of economic stability after the country signed on as
a key ally in the U.S. war on terror.</TE>
<TE>   Other big first-quarter gainers in the region included South
Korea, up 29%, and Thailand and Indonesia, both up 23%. On the
downside, China's Shanghai B index shed nearly 12% and Hong Kong's
Hang Seng index slipped 3%.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. indexes were mixed, with the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 down less
than 0.1% for the three-month period while the Dow industrials rose
3.8%.</TE>

<HD>More Fans Drawn to Orbitz Even as Criticism Grows</HD>
<DH>Travel: Rivals say travel site's quick rise depended on
collusion among airlines. The government is investigating.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Online travel site Orbitz stirred controversy even before it was
launched nine months ago, and its critics are still bellowing. But
there's a new twist: Orbitz now has a growing legion of fans among
consumers.</LD>
<LD>   Orbitz has rocketed to the top ranks of the Internet travel
industry, even as it faces louder protests from its rivals and
investigations by the Transportation and Justice departments for
possible antitrust violations.</LD>
<LD>   The Transportation Department recently asked for more information
from Chicago-based Orbitz and others in the industry and noted that
Congress also asked the agency to investigate Orbitz's business.</LD>
<TE>   Orbitz was founded by the five largest U.S. airlines, which poured
$150 million into its development. Its critics contend that the
service gets deeply discounted seats from the carriers under
marketing agreements that aren't available to other travel agencies.
These are usually the "Web-only fares" also sold on the airlines' own
Internet sites. Federal regulators are looking at whether through
this arrangement Orbitz effectively represents collusion among the
airlines that would give them a stranglehold on the market and curb
competition.</TE>
<TE>   "We welcome competition as long as it's fair," said Antonella
Pianalto, executive director of the Interactive Travel Services
Assn., a trade group for online travel firms. "When Orbitz has fares
that no one else has access to, that's not fair competition."</TE>
<TE>   Orbitz freely acknowledges that it's arranged to sell the cheapest
fares available from those airlines and some other carriers in
exchange for providing sophisticated Internet technology that helps
the airlines drive down their costs of distributing tickets. Orbitz
claims it can save an airline up to 30% compared with peddling
tickets through other channels. But Orbitz, which denies any
wrongdoing, says its service is unbiased and predicts the government
will agree.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no exclusive right to any fare," and the airlines are
free to sell their cheapest fares to any other firm if they want,
said Jeff Katz, Orbitz's chief executive. He added that Orbitz
provides "no preference for one airline over another."</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, the flap over Orbitz is likely to intensify because
the online travel business--which already accounts for more than 10%
of airline purchases--is expected to grow more sharply in the coming
years. In January, 47.5 million U.S. visitors booked $2.3 billion of
travel on Internet sites, and both levels were monthly records,
according to research firm ComScore Networks Inc.</TE>
<TE>   The airlines, anxious to cut costs further, stopped paying basic
commissions to travel agents who book their flights. That's expected
to force most agents to charge higher fees to consumers, in turn
driving more consumers to book on the Internet, on which they can
find the cheapest fares and minimal fees.</TE>
<TE>   And there are plenty of Internet competitors vying for their
business. They're led by Expedia Inc., which recently sold majority
ownership to Barry Diller's USA Networks Inc., and Travelocity.com
Inc., which is majority owned by Sabre Holdings Corp., a leading
computer reservations system provider for travel agents.</TE>
<TE>   Right behind them is Orbitz, which was formed in late 1999 by UAL
Corp.'s United Airlines, Delta Air Lines Inc., Northwest Airlines
Corp. and Continental Airlines Inc. AMR Corp.'s American Airlines
signed up later, and more than 40 other carriers also have reached
marketing pacts to put their best fares on Orbitz. Overall, Orbitz
has access to 455 airlines and hundreds of hotels, car rental
agencies and other travel service firms.</TE>
<TE>   From the start, Orbitz raised hackles of rival online sites and
other critics because of its airline ownership, even though two of
the major critics, Expedia and Travelocity, had a big head start in
the online travel business.</TE>
<TE>   Their complaints about Orbitz is "a little like Coke and Pepsi
teaming up to run Dr Pepper out of the market," said Orbitz's Katz.</TE>
<TE>   And the critics weren't appeased when the Transportation
Department, after an initial review, gave Orbitz the green light to
open last year. Now, with regulators poring over Orbitz again, the
critics expect a different outcome.</TE>
<TE>   "We're clearly pleased the [Transportation Department] is
launching this new investigation," Sabre spokesman Michael Berman
said. Noting Orbitz's contention of having better technology that
makes its site so appealing to travelers, Berman said, "It's not
really that significant a technology. There's something else giving
them an advantage, and we think the ... investigation will prove
that."</TE>
<TE>   Transportation Department spokesman Bill Mosley said regulators
are investigating not only "whether Orbitz could be a vehicle for
airline collusion," but also whether federal regulations covering
Sabre and the other computer reservations system operators should be
overhauled to cover online travel sites. Currently they do not.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Zoghlin, Orbitz's chief technology officer, said the site's
fast growth reflects its consumer-friendly design, its ability to
sift through billions of fares and flights at lightning speed and its
quick response to travelers' problems.</TE>
<TE>   "We are 100% focused on how consumers interact with us," he said,
and "we leave no stone unturned to drive down the distribution costs"
for the airlines, which in turn keeps down fares.</TE>
<TE>   Katz also said Orbitz was growing rapidly because "consumers have
told us loudly that they like it."</TE>
<TE>   But Orbitz's rivals aren't buying it, declaring that its airline
ownership gives it an unfair edge.</TE>
<TE>   "If Orbitz continues the way it's continuing, it will eliminate
competition," said Pianalto of the travel services association. "If
we want competition in airline pricing, you have to have independent
sites out there forcing the airlines to compete, and they don't have
to do that on Orbitz."</TE>

<HD>Federal Pension Agency to Take Over LTV Plans</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The government's pension insurance program, in its largest pension
takeover ever, is assuming control of three underfunded retirement
plans covering 82,000 workers and retirees of steel company LTV Corp.</LD>
<LD>   The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. said Friday that the plans were
underfunded by about $2.2billion, with combined assets of nearly
$2.2billion and benefit liabilities of $4.4billion.</LD>
<LD>   The PBGC is guaranteeing the basic pension benefits of
participants in the three plans. Retirees will continue to receive
monthly checks, and the benefits of other employees will be held
until they reach retirement age.</LD>
<TE>   LTV, once the nation's third-largest steel company, sought
bankruptcy protection from creditors in December 2000 and is being
liquidated.</TE>
<TE>   The three plans terminate Sunday. The largest plan, the LTV Steel
Hourly Pension Plan, covers about 65,000 participants and is
underfunded by nearly $1.8 billion. The LTV Steel Salaried Defined
Benefit Retirement Plan has more than 14,000 participants and is
underfunded by about $316 million. The LTV Steel Mining Co. Pension
Plan, with about 3,500 participants, is underfunded by about $70
million.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, the PBGC is preparing to take over the LTV Railroads
Pension Plan covering nearly 700 participants and underfunded by
nearly $2 million.</TE>
<TE>   Not affected are the pension plans of LTV subsidiary LTV
Copperweld &amp; VP Buildings.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has been notified that the Securities and
Exchange Commission enforcement staff plans to pursue a case against
the securities firm for allegedly trading Treasury bonds based on
inside information, a person familiar with the case said.</LD>
<LD>   The agency began investigating Goldman after a consultant the firm
had hired gave traders advance warning Oct. 31 that the Treasury
Department would stop selling 30-year bonds. The $3-trillion Treasury
market rallied, with the 30-year bond having its biggest one-day gain
in 14 years.</LD>
<LD>   Goldman, the SEC and the Treasury Department declined to comment.</LD>
<TE>   Goldman spokesman Peter Dietlmaier said Nov. 12 that the firm was
among those told of the Treasury Department's decision before the
announcement and did not engage in wrongful behavior.</TE>

<LD>Robotic Vision Systems Inc., a maker of semiconductor inspection

investigating accounting practices that led to a restatement of
earnings last May.</LD>
<LD>   Robotic Vision restated results for its fiscal year that ended

correct accounting errors involving recognition of revenue at its
Acuity CiMatrix division, the Canton, Mass.-based company said in a
May 21 statement.</LD>
<LD>   The restatement resulted from a review by Robotic Vision's audit
committee, outside counsel and auditors. New procedures and other
safeguards were implemented at that time, the company said.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Tyco International Ltd. Chief Executive Dennis Kozlowski and Chief
Financial Officer Mark Swartz lent $14.1 million in 2000 to Warren
Musser, a board member of former affiliate TyCom Ltd., the company
said.</LD>
<LD>   The loan, which has been repaid, was not reported publicly by Tyco
because disclosure was "neither necessary nor was it required," said
Brad McGee, Tyco's chief strategy officer.</LD>
<LD>   Musser was a board member of TyCom, the largest maker of undersea
cable, when Tyco offered to buy the 11% of the company it didn't own
for $748 million in October 2001. Tyco reached a definitive agreement
with the affiliate 15 days later.</LD>
<TE>   Shareholders filed lawsuits claiming that the pace at which the
transaction was completed indicated the companies didn't negotiate in
good faith. Tyco, based in Bermuda and run from Exeter, N.H., has
said the lawsuits are without merit.</TE>
<TE>   Musser wasn't a member of a special committee of TyCom directors
that reviewed the Tyco offer, McGee said. He repaid the loan, made in
December 2000, a year later.</TE>
<TE>   Musser didn't respond to a request for comment.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nextel Communications Inc., the mobile-phone company controlled by
Craig McCaw, had a wider fourth-quarter loss after a $1.6-billion
write-down on assets in an international unit that may seek
bankruptcy protection.</LD>
<LD>   The loss attributable to shareholders was $1.8 billion, or $2.25 a
share, from $61 million, or 8 cents, a year earlier, Nextel said in a
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</LD>
<LD>   The international unit, NII Holdings Inc., said in January that it
may file for bankruptcy protection after missing an $8.3-million
payment to banks. NII was buffeted as Argentina defaulted on $95
billion in bonds and devalued its currency.</LD>
<TE>   Nextel said last month that its fourth-quarter U.S. loss widened
to $127 million from $42 million. Nextel delayed reporting full
results until determining charges for the asset write-down, then
estimated at $1 billion to $2 billion.</TE>

<AU>Calpine Reduces 2001 Earnings by $11.5 Million</AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Calpine Corp. said it is lowering 2001 profit by $11.5 million
because it didn't get some plant-emission credits it bought last
year.</LD>
<LD>   The step lowers the San Jose energy company's 2001 earnings per
share by 3 cents to $1.87.</LD>
<LD>   The restatement is related to the purchase last year of emission
credits, which the electricity company often buys to help it obtain
environmental permits for new power plants, Calpine said. Since
reporting its 2001 results in January, the company discovered that
credits it had bought weren't available.</LD>
<TE>   Calpine has sued the broker that sold the emission credits to
recover the loss. The company said the loss won't affect future
profit.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>XO Communications Inc., a money-losing telecommunications company,
said it is considering a $500-million bid by financier Carl Icahn for
50% of the company and it may file for bankruptcy protection "in the
very near future."</LD>
<LD>   The Reston, Va.-based company on March 11 rejected a takeover
proposal from bondholders led by the financier. It said it planned to
implement a competing plan from buyout firm Forstmann Little &amp; Co.,
led by buyout veteran Ted Forstmann, and Telefonos de Mexico to
inject $800 million and receive an 80% equity stake.</LD>
<LD>   XO made the disclosures in its annual report, filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.</LD>
<TE>   XO also said "it has become clear" that to implement a
balance-sheet restructuring necessary for it to run its business, the
company "will need to commence a bankruptcy proceeding" and seek a
reorganization that will eliminate its current equity and much of its
debt.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ever since the Lakers beat Sacramento last weekend they've looked
vulnerable, even in victories.</LD>
<LD>   If it's not shaky defense, it's rebounding or free-throw shooting.
If it's not any of those, it's $1,500 courtside seats threatening to
take out their $208-million center.</LD>
<LD>   Yet they're still in the hunt for the best record in the league,
still confident that they're the team to beat come playoff time, even
if the only thing about the franchise that really looks great right
now is the up-and-about Chick Hearn.</LD>
<TE>   Maybe this team is as resilient as its legendary broadcaster. The
Lakers keep buying time, keep bouncing back often enough to prevent
Staples Center from booking extra concert dates in June.</TE>
<TE>   Like Shaquille O'Neal after a nasty tumble into the seats, they're
still standing.</TE>
<TE>   And as much as the crowd booed Scottie Pippen throughout the
Lakers' 91-79 victory over Portland Friday night, they'd like what
the Portland forward had to say about the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll be fine," Pippen said. "Phil [Jackson] will get them
together."</TE>
<TE>   If the Lakers decide they want to play some defense, there's a
championship out there for the taking.</TE>
<TE>   Lately it's been their opponents who have been taking whatever
they want. Layups, open jump shots, free trips through the lane.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix scored 62 points in the first half against the Lakers
Wednesday night. That was just after Cleveland scored 72 points in
the second half Tuesday night, giving Laker opponents 134 points in
four consecutive quarters.</TE>
<TE>   "Defense is just competitive nature and high energy, working
hard," Jackson said. "The rest of it comes with confidence in what
you're doing, knowing what the moves are. I think we got hit at all
three spots the other night."</TE>
<TE>   As hot as the Trail Blazers have been since the All-Star break,
they weren't the true test Friday night at Staples Center. They don't
set up their offense to run screen-and-rolls as often as Phoenix did
the other night. They lack a center who can either draw O'Neal
outside or challenge him inside. And they didn't have their top
scorer, Rasheed Wallace, who was out with a back injury.</TE>
<TE>   So this was simply a chance to see if the Lakers wanted to put in
the necessary work, the type of effort it will take to get another
downtown parade.</TE>
<TE>   They had it.</TE>
<TE>   There was Kobe Bryant slapping at balls in the passing lanes and
harassing Pippen at midcourt, causing him to lose the ball out of
bounds. Samaki Walker and Robert Horry blocking Shawn Kemp and Dale
Davis shots inside. Even Derek Fisher got into the act, trying his
best to block a shot by Davis, who's 10 inches taller. Fisher fouled
him, but he showed the right intent. No easy layups. Seven blocked
shots. It was a whole different attitude, as if something got into
the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   "Two games in a row, teams scored, like, 120 points on us," Bryant
said. "That's what got into us."</TE>
<TE>   Back in business? Not quite. Just when the Lakers have one problem
solved, another pops up. Somebody call tech support.</TE>
<TE>   They let countless good defensive efforts go to waste because they
couldn't finish the task and grab the rebound. Portland hung in a
game it had no business hanging in with 24 second-chance points,
before 32.6% shooting and the unstoppable combination of O'Neal and
Bryant (34 points apiece) finally caught up to the Blazers.</TE>
<TE>   In the fourth quarter, O'Neal chased a loose ball toward the
sideline and appeared to have everything under control. But as he
leaped over the first row of seats his left foot got caught on a
seat, his right foot hit a spectator, and he fell hard. His left arm
landed on the the metal riser behind the walkway around the court.</TE>
<TE>   This time, Bryant was quick to the scene, hopping over the
courtside seats to check on his teammate.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal brushed some peanut shells off his arm, and after a timeout
he returned to dominate inside and push the Lakers to a cozy lead.</TE>
<TE>   So O'Neal played the Superman role. And Hearn was super, too.</TE>
<TE>   Even after heart surgery and a hip replacement, he actually looks
less frail than the Lakers have at times recently. He's still more
than a week away from his return to the microphone. Friday night he
watched his first Laker game in person since Dec. 16. He received a
standing ovation when he was shown on the video screen during a
timeout five minutes into the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers are 6-13 this season when opponents score 100 or more
points, and are 46-8 when holding opponents to less than 100.</TE>
<TE>   As potent as the Lakers' offense can be--they're third in the
league in scoring--they aren't going to win many shootouts. And
though they might have the two biggest guns in the game, they don't
have the overall firepower of Dallas and Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   They showed Friday that they know what they must do. They've got
to play defense. And watch out for those chairs.</TE>

<HD>Spiezio's Suspension Is Reduced by a Game</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Angel first baseman Scott Spiezio won a small victory Friday, a
one-game reduction in his suspension, but will still have to sit out
five games.</LD>
<LD>   Bob DuPuy, president and chief operating officer of Major League
Baseball, ruled on appeals by Spiezio, Troy Glaus and the San Diego
Padres' Ryan Klesko and Bobby Jones of penalties stemming from their
roles in two brawls during a March 9 exhibition game. Klesko had his
suspension reduced by one game and will sit out four. The suspensions
for Jones (seven games) and Glaus (two games) were not reduced.</LD>
<LD>   Spiezio was hoping that his suspension would be dropped to three
games.</LD>
<TE>   "Deep down inside, I don't feel I deserve this many games," he
said before the Angels' 4-2 exhibition victory over the Colorado
Rockies on Friday at Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I pretty much did what anyone would have done in my
situation. I was protecting my teammates. I think some punishment was
warranted, but I still thought it was steep. At least I can be happy
that what I said and what they saw on the tapes convinced them to
take one game off."</TE>
<TE>   Klesko, who was ejected after the first brawl but returned to the
field during the second, also had hoped for more of a reprieve.</TE>
<TE>   "I was thinking it was going to get reduced to at least four or
three games, just looking at prior cases," he said. "They gave me
that extra day, I think, because I went back out, but I went back out
to make sure no one else got hurt, to pull the other guys off. I
wasn't looking to punch anybody, like some of the other guys that got
suspensions."</TE>
<TE>   Spiezio will sit out the Angels' first five games. Glaus will
begin his suspension when Spiezio returns.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to try to be inventive of ways to keep my timing,"
Spiezio said. "It's going to be real tough. I have never had to sit
there, be healthy and watch a game being played and know there is no
chance of me getting [in]."</TE>
<TE>   The suspensions leave Manager Mike Scioscia with a hole in his
lineup. Larry Barnes, one possible stopgap at first base, turned up
Friday with a sore back, which may reduce his chances of winning a
spot on the opening-day roster.</TE>
<TE>   Barnes was injured in his last at-bat Thursday. He was examined by
Dr. Lewis Yocum before Friday's game and did not participate in
pregame workouts.</TE>
<TE>   "He said it was just a strain in my ribcage," Barnes said. "He
gave me anti-inflammatory medicine. I should be swinging it tomorrow.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what direction they are going. Obviously, I'd like
to get in there and get some at-bats to show what can do."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In Friday's game, Bengie Molina had a two-run double and Glaus a
run-scoring single in a three-run fourth inning for the Angels in
front of 12,765. Brad Fullmer broke a scoreless tie with a single
that scored Garret Anderson in the second.</TE>
<TE>   Aaron Sele, making his last spring training start, went five solid
innings, throwing 84 pitches. He gave up two runs and six hits. Sele,
who signed a three-year, $24-million contract as a free agent,
finished 3-0 with a 4.44 earned-run average in six spring starts. He
has won at least 15 games each of the past four seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "His pitch count is where it needs to be," Scioscia said. "His
command has improved with every start."</TE>
<TE>   Brendan Donnelly, competing with Matt Wise and Mark Lukasiewicz
for the last bullpen spot, pitched a perfect sixth inning, although
center fielder Darin Erstad had to chase down a drive by Todd Zeile
at the wall to start the inning.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, diminutive shortstop David Eckstein was filling in as
an infielder until second baseman Adam Kennedy recovered from a
broken finger.</TE>
<TE>   Eckstein starts this season as the shortstop and leadoff batter,
having taken advantage of the opportunity. Eckstein, who hit .285 and
stole 29 bases last season, was hitting .333 with 19 runs and five
stolen bases in 21 spring games before Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "He's always been a confident player, whether it was when he
walked on at Florida to win a position or in the minor leagues where
he had to battle every year because everyone thought he was an
overachiever," Scioscia said. "Defensively, I think he will feel more
comfortable at shortstop than last year."</TE>
<TE>   Eckstein had played primarily second base before moving to
shortstop after Kennedy's return.</TE>
<TE>   He came to camp this season taking nothing for granted.</TE>
<TE>   "This spring was nice, but I was still on edge," Eckstein said.
"There are a lot of great guys in this organization. If you don't
play well, they are going to step into your shoes."</TE>

<HD>Forbes Is With Players</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Magazine reports that teams turned a $75-million
profit last season, disputing Selig.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Major league players and members of Congress have gone on record
doubting baseball owners' claims of impending financial disaster, and
now Forbes magazine has too.</LD>
<LD>   In its April 15 issue, the financial publication disputes
baseball's cry of poor.</LD>
<LD>   Forbes' report says baseball's 30 major league teams combined to
turn an operating profit of $75 million last season. Commissioner Bud
Selig testified to the House Judiciary Committee in December that
baseball had operating losses of $232 million.</LD>
<TE>   Selig also said only nine teams made money last season; Forbes
said 20 teams were profitable.</TE>
<TE>   Forbes did agree with the commissioner on one account: The Dodgers
lost more money last season than any other team. But while Dodger
officials have put the club's losses in the $50 million-$65 million
range, Forbes says it was more like $29.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   The club had no comment Friday, referring questions to the
commissioner's office.</TE>
<TE>   With negotiations for a new collective bargaining agreement set to
resume next week, Forbes' report could provide more ammunition for
the players' union in its public relations war with the owners.
Players have disputed management's claims of hundreds of millions of
dollars in annual losses, and the sides are not in agreement about
the cause of what owners say is baseball's competitive-balance
problem.</TE>
<TE>   Many in baseball believe a work stoppage is inevitable because
neither side appears ready to capitulate on major differences, and
Forbes' story won't make things easier for owners seeking significant
changes to the current system.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, owners reacted angrily to the Forbes report.</TE>
<TE>   "It is dishonest," baseball spokesman Rich Levin said. ''They came
to us asking us to show them our books, which we did.</TE>
<TE>   "Rob Manfred [executive vice president of labor relations] went
through all the clubs' finances with them. They showed him what they
had, and he showed them where they were wrong, and they completely
ignored the whole session."</TE>
<TE>   Forbes' study, which the magazine claims included data provided
directly from some teams, determined that baseball had $3.57 billion
in revenues. Owners put the figure at $3.55 billion, so there's not
much disagreement about that.</TE>
<TE>   However, Forbes and baseball had big differences in expenses, with
baseball reporting $3.78 billion and the magazine at $3.495 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Forbes' annual lists of the richest and most profitable are often
disputed. Similarly, discrepancies in baseball accounting are nothing
new.</TE>
<TE>   "There are multiple ways to look at the numbers, and these numbers
have been called into question as long as there has been labor strife
in baseball," said David Carter of the Sports Business Group, an
L.A.-based consulting firm. "You can look at it in terms of actual
cash flow, how are you doing year to year, or you can look at it in
terms of book profits and losses.</TE>
<TE>   "Many owners are incurring losses, other owners are claiming book
losses. Because of tax breaks, some owners showing a loss are
actually doing all right financially. Owners are trying to lump every
possible expense into this. Owners are always trying to show they're
in the worst financial position, and players are trying to show
they're doing OK."</TE>
<TE>   Selig is doing better than most in baseball, according to Forbes.</TE>
<TE>   His family's Milwaukee Brewers had the highest operating profit in
baseball--$18.8 million--after accounting for revenue sharing. The
New York Yankees, which Forbes estimated had the highest franchise
value at $730 million, were second on the profit list at $18.7
million. The San Francisco Giants ($16.8 million), New York Mets
($14.3 million) and Seattle Mariners ($14.1 million) complete the
most profitable teams.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers, despite their big losses last year, were third in
franchise value at $435 million, trailing only the Yankees and New
York Mets ($482 million).</TE>
<TE>   The two least-valuable teams were the Montreal Expos ($108
million) and Minnesota Twins ($127 million). They were targets for
elimination in the off-season and could be again next winter.</TE>
<TE>   Attempts to contact several baseball officials late Friday were
unsuccessful. Mike Ozanian, a senior editor at Forbes, said baseball
declined to release details of clubs' specific expenses.</TE>
<TE>   ''They didn't offer us their books, what they offered us was the
same exact numbers that they used to give before Congress," he said.
''As Congress said, there wasn't anywhere near sufficient breakdowns
to see where the numbers came from.</TE>
<TE>   "I would be willing to sit down and show them where everything we
had came from if they would do the same."</TE>
<TE>   Levin disagreed with Forbes' numbers, saying they are not audited
and that baseball's are audited at three levels.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of it is accounting semantics, but let's be clear that a
lot of these teams are doing poorly," said Carter, who believes some
small-market teams could be in trouble but is suspicious when clubs
backed by deep-pocket corporations cry poverty.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the same undercurrent, same backdrop as we've seen before
[in labor negotiations]. The union is trying to show the owners are
making money in a vibrant business, and owners are trying to use
their means and standard accounting practices to show they aren't."</TE>

<HD>Sweeney Is a Big Deal to Royals</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mike Sweeney, the power-hitting first baseman the Kansas City Royals
hope to make the cornerstone of their future, agreed Friday to a
$55-million, five-year extension through the 2007 season.</LD>
<LD>   Sweeney gets $8 million this year, the final season of a $13
million, two-year contract. He would have been eligible to become a
free agent after the World Series.</LD>
<LD>   "My representatives said on the free market I'd probably be worth
$14, $15 [million a year], somewhere around there," Sweeney said.
"But to me, it's not about the money. It's about being fair, not
trying to get the most.</LD>
<TE>   "For me this is the right place. I wrote on a piece of paper the
pros and cons, and the pros outweighed the cons to stay in Kansas
City. It's not about money, but having peace in your heart. I have
peace in my heart to sign this contract."</TE>
<TE>   The new deal can be terminated by Sweeney if the Royals do not
have a .500 or better record in either the 2003 or 2004 season.</TE>
<TE>   Sweeney gets a complete no-trade clause for this season and next,
and then a limited no-trade clause. If Sweeney does accept a trade,
the average yearly salary for the remainder of the contract would
increase to $12.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   "This is big," Royal General Manager Allard Baird said. "Ownership
really made a strong commitment. They said be aggressive. We need to
keep him. He is our cornerstone."</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Sweeney had one of the best seasons in team history,
hitting .333 with 29 homers and a team-record 144 runs batted in. He
also hit 44 doubles that year and became the first American Leaguer
since Al Rosen in 1953 to hit at least .330 with 200 hits and 140
RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, although slowed by injury, he batted .304 with 29
homers and 99 RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Derek Bell said goodbye to the Pittsburgh Pirates, even though the
Pirates have yet to officially say goodbye to him.</TE>
<TE>   Bell, whose inflammatory remarks two weeks ago all but assured his
release, packed his bags and hugged several Pirate clubhouse
employees before leaving. He had reported for treatment on a groin
injury that has sidelined him since March 18.</TE>
<TE>   Bell's exit came two days before the Pirates break camp for
Monday's season opener at New York, and shortly after he discussed
his status with General Manager Dave Littlefield.</TE>
<TE>   Littlefield said the Pirates made no roster move or trade Friday
involving Bell. However, Bell must pass through waivers--a process
that takes 48 hours--before he can be released.</TE>
<TE>   Bell all but assured himself of not being on the team when he
threatened in mid-March to go into "Operation Shutdown" if he wasn't
handed the right fielder's job.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rickey Henderson's contract was purchased from triple-A Pawtucket
by the Boston Red Sox.... Dave Hollins, an All-Star third baseman the
last time the Philadelphia Phillies went to the World Series in 1993,
earned a roster spot when the team released infielder Kevin
Jordan.... The Texas Rangers purchased the contract of left-handed
reliever Rich Rodriguez from triple-A Oklahoma.... Luis Sojo plans to
talk with New York Yankee officials about taking a position in the
organization. "I'm 99% sure I'm retired," Sojo said. "The Yankees are
always going to be my first option.".... The Cincinnati Reds put
utility infielder Juan Castro on the 15-day disabled list and
recalled shortstop Gookie Dawkins from triple-A Louisville.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   One year to the day after Barry Bonds hit his record 73rd home
run, the two fans locked in a lawsuit over ownership of the ball will
head to trial.</TE>
<TE>   A San Francisco court commissioner said the trial over who owns
No. 73 will start Oct. 7--exactly one year after Bonds launched the
ball into a mob on the right-field porch at Pacific Bell Park.</TE>
<TE>   One man, Alex Popov, got a glove on the million-dollar memento,
but lost it after other fans pounced on him.</TE>
<TE>   Popov, a health-food restaurateur from Berkeley, sued the man who
ended up plucking the ball from the scrum.</TE>
<TE>   That man, Patrick Hayashi, says the ball is his because Popov
never really caught it. He has said he found the ball loose amid the
fracas and that Popov is trying to bully him into surrendering it.</TE>

<DH>Gary or Roy Williams Is Going to Get a Step Closer to First
Championship</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>The former members of the Can't Win the Big One Society have heard
the talk coming out of the Final Four.</LD>
<LD>   "It's stupidity," Connecticut Coach Jim Calhoun said. "Totally
unfair."</LD>
<LD>   It makes no sense to Arizona's Lute Olson either.</LD>
<TE>   "How many big ones do you have to win before the 'big one,' just
in order to get that chance?" he wanted to know.</TE>
<TE>   They are coaches who couldn't win the so-called big one.</TE>
<TE>   Then they won it.</TE>
<TE>   Now Kansas Coach Roy Williams and Maryland Coach Gary Williams are
in the crosshairs as they prepare their teams for an NCAA semifinal
game today.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas forward Drew Gooden all but rolled his eyes as another
microphone was stuck in his face. The most-asked question at the
Final Four? Gooden smiled.</TE>
<TE>   "'Is there any pressure for us to win it for Coach Williams?' I'm
tired of answering that."</TE>
<TE>   Dean Smith was practically the charter member of the Can't Win the
Big One club, reaching the Final Four six times before winning the
first of his two NCAA titles in 1982.</TE>
<TE>   Roy Williams--here at the Final Four trying hard to become the
next to be kicked out of the club--was there beside Smith that night
as a North Carolina assistant coach.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the celebration, Williams leaned in close.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so happy for you, because it will shut those people up,"
Williams told Smith.</TE>
<TE>   "He looked at me and said, 'I don't know that I'm any better coach
than I was 21/2 hours ago.'"</TE>
<TE>   Williams more or less shrugs at the question after reaching three
Final Fours in 14 seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something I know people are going to say and I have got to
live with," says Williams, whose 29-12 tournament record is one of
the best among active coaches.</TE>
<TE>   "If we ever do win it, they'll move on to somebody else. If we
don't, they'll keep coming after me."</TE>
<TE>   It's easy to forget that only 41 coaches have won the NCAA title.</TE>
<TE>   There have been 63 champions since 1939, but John Wooden won 10
titles, Adolph Rupp won four, Bob Knight and Mike Krzyzewski three
each, and six others have won two.</TE>
<TE>   Olson won in 1997, the fourth of his five trips to the Final Four.</TE>
<TE>   "How I really felt was that winning an NCAA championship was not
going to be the determining factor about what kind of coach I am,"
Olson said.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always felt it's more critical how much you get out of the
kids who play for you, and how you're looked on by them, five, 10
years down the road.</TE>
<TE>   "And also how people in my profession look at me, whether I do a
good job or a bad job. I put a lot of stock in what people in
coaching think of me."</TE>
<TE>   Calhoun won in 1999, his first trip to the Final Four.</TE>
<TE>   But he had lost in the regional final three times before--once on
one of Christian Laettner's famous buzzer beaters for Duke, in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   This season, Connecticut reached the Elite Eight again before
losing to Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   "A couple of years removed from winning the national championship,
this team with a freshman and two sophomores was a minute from the
Final Four," Calhoun said. "Maybe this was a better coaching job than
the year we won.</TE>
<TE>   "John Chaney got elected to the Hall of Fame without winning the
'big one' or getting to the Final Four. People in the profession know
what John Chaney has done. The greatest measure of excellence is
time.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're John Chaney, he never won a national
championship--although he did at the Division II level. It's more
important he won 20 games every year, all those years."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Boeheim of Syracuse hasn't won a national championship in 21
trips to the tournament. Lou Carnesecca never won one for St. John's.
Gene Keady has never gotten Purdue to the Final Four. Neither did
Norm Stewart at Missouri.</TE>
<TE>   Calhoun insists winning a one-loss-and-you're-out tournament
shouldn't be the referendum on a career.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, he saw a writer from one of the nation's most respected
newspapers, who'd told him seven or eight years ago a coach hadn't
really accomplished anything until he'd made the Final Four.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him I disagreed with him then, and after winning it all, I
disagree with you now," Calhoun said.</TE>
<TE>   "I can give you coaches I won't name who have won a national
championship, and time has not been as kind to them as it will be to
Roy Williams, Gary Williams and Kelvin Sampson--even though he's
still a little young." [The Oklahoma coach is making his first trip
to the Final Four, as is Indiana's Mike Davis.]</TE>
<TE>   Roy Williams created expectations by reaching the Final Four twice
in his first five seasons, most recently in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Now, having not advanced past the Sweet 16 since 1996, people ask
him where he has been.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing else was as painful, though, as 1997, when Kansas was 34-1
and No. 1 in the nation before losing to eventual champion Arizona in
a regional semifinal.</TE>
<TE>   Until then, Williams admits, winning a national championship had
been his No. 1 goal.</TE>
<TE>   "After the heartbreak of 1997 and not being able to have Jacque
Vaughn, Jerod Haase, Scot Pollard and B.J. Williams go to the Final
Four with that great team, the pain was too hard and it made me sit
back a little bit and look at things a little differently," Williams
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It took probably at least the next year to get it clear in my
mind. I decided my No. 1 goal was to live long enough to coach my
grandchildren in Little League baseball and ... basketball."</TE>
<TE>   The drive is still there, though.</TE>
<TE>   "Want to win it? As much as I want to breathe," Williams said.
"But at the same time, it's not the only thing. I really mean it."</TE>
<TE>   More than a few coaches admit they'll be pulling for him.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's just a shame when that monkey gets on people's
backs," Olson said. "I like a lot of the coaches in this Final Four,
but I would be happy if Roy won.</TE>
<TE>   "No one does a better job of preparing and recruiting. You know
he's doing it the right way."</TE>
<TE>   Maryland's Gary Williams took his alma mater to the school's first
Final Four last year.</TE>
<TE>   But for him, more than not winning the big one, it has been not
winning the Duke one.</TE>
<TE>   The Blue Devils knocked Maryland out in the semifinals last year.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the Terrapins have outlasted Duke in the tournament for
the first time since 1985, when Lefty Driesell was coach.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, not winning the big one is what helps a coach
eventually do it.</TE>
<TE>   "I think you have to go through it," Gary Williams said. "As a
coach, if you have been through it, I think you can get your players
through it, but last year was my first experience as a coach. You
talk to people that have been through that and get some tips from
them, people you respect in the business, and they certainly help
you....</TE>
<TE>   "The big thing I found out last year was, you prepare for the game
just like you prepare for a regular-season game. In other words,
whatever you did with your team to get to the Final Four, then you
have to prepare the same way for the game--or the two games--that you
play there."</TE>
<TE>   Getting there again and again, after all, is a measure of a
sustained excellence.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just like the Buffalo Bills," Olson said. "They dropped four
straight Super Bowls. How many big ones did they have to win to get
to all those Super Bowls?"</TE>
<TE>   Marv Levy never won a championship.</TE>
<TE>   Olson and Calhoun did.</TE>
<TE>   And although they say it didn't change them, those around them
believe it made them calmer, and more complete.</TE>
<TE>   But still the same coaches.</TE>
<TE>   "I got to go on Letterman and throw out the first pitch at Fenway
Park, so I can't say it didn't change my experience, but it didn't
change the actuality," Calhoun said.</TE>
<TE>   The difference, they believe, is in others.</TE>
<TE>   "It definitely changes the way people look at you," Olson said.
"And it probably relieves pressure.</TE>
<TE>   "All I remember is, seeing Jim Calhoun out recruiting during the
summer after he won the national title.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'It's amazing how much smarter the two of us are than we
were four or five years ago.'"</TE>

<LD>Shaun Powell of Newsday on the Angels' trade of Mo Vaughn to the New
York Mets:</LD>
<LD>   "Say this about the Vaughn trade: It spread happiness from coast
to coast. One side couldn't wait to reel him in and the other
couldn't wait to shove him out.</LD>
<LD>   "This must be somewhat disturbing from a Mets' standpoint. On any
trade, you want the other team to feel a sense of regret, not relief,
over losing a player.</LD>
<TE>   "Did Anaheim trade Vaughn to the Mets or dump him on them? There's
a difference and, obviously, it'll take months before we find out
who'll laugh last."</TE>

<TE>   Trivia time: UCLA's Bill Walton holds the record for points scored

record did he break?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Longshot at best: John McGrath in the Tacoma News Tribune,
speculating on George Karl's leaving the Milwaukee Bucks to coach at
the University of Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "Would Karl, who'd have to take an 80% pay cut for a college job,
be willing to walk away from the bucks he's earning with the Bucks in
Milwaukee?</TE>
<TE>   "This is just a hunch, but I'd be surprised if the possibility of
returning to the Northwest--where he worked for seven variously
enjoyable, intensely eventful seasons--didn't at least intrigue the
ex-Sonics' coach."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Teaching politeness:  Reader Edith Kelly wrote the San Francisco
Chronicle that she attended an exhibition game in Arizona and saw
Giant pitcher Jay Witasick refuse to sign a boy's program until the
lad said, "Please."</TE>
<TE>   Said Witasick: "You just have to ask right," adding that if he had
ever asked his mother for breakfast the way the boy asked for the
autograph, "I would have ended up wearing it instead of eating it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Should be called off: Tom FitzGerald in the San Francisco
Chronicle: "Mike Tyson and Lennox Lewis are scheduled to fight June 8
at the Pyramid in Memphis, assuming Tyson stays out of the slammer
that long. What should the fight be called?</TE>
<TE>   "Geoff Calkins of the Memphis Commercial Appeal offers, 'the

<TE>   You can't miss him: Mark Bradley in the Atlanta

<HD>McInnis Has Great Timing</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Guard makes 20-foot shot at the buzzer to
give Clippers key 96-94 victory over Suns.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>Jeff McInnis ran a fade pattern in the dying seconds Friday, turning
his back to the basket in order to accept an inbounds pass from
Darius Miles. McInnis desperately wanted to get closer to the basket,
but Phoenix Suns blocked his path.</LD>
<LD>   Three seconds, two seconds, one second...</LD>
<LD>   McInnis stopped where he was, roughly 20 feet from the basket,
turned and lofted a jump shot over Stephon Marbury. The ball left his
hands a nanosecond before the final buzzer sounded, swishing through
the hoop to the sounds of Clipper cheers.</LD>
<TE>   The Clippers had pulled out a 96-94 season-saving victory over the
Suns before a stunned crowd of 18,508 at America West Arena. Now,
tonight's game against the Utah Jazz at Staples Center is meaningful.</TE>
<TE>   A loss Friday would have been devastating to the Clippers' playoff
hopes. After all, they have only nine games remaining. But by
rallying from an 18-point deficit against the Suns, the ninth-place
Clippers moved within 31/2 games of the eighth-place Jazz in the
battle for the final Western Conference playoff spot.</TE>
<TE>   The teams also play Wednesday at Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   Three seconds before McInnis' winning basket from the right wing,
Marbury had tied the score, 94-94, by swishing a three-point basket
over McInnis on the left wing. After a Clipper timeout, McInnis saved
the season.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we've had some pretty good wins this season," Coach Alvin
Gentry said after the Clippers ended a three-game losing streak.
"This was a good win because it came under a crisis situation."</TE>
<TE>   It's one thing to rally from 18 points down to defeat the New York
Knicks on Feb. 3, with a good chunk of the season still ahead of
them. And it's quite another to erase an 18-point deficit against the
Suns, winners of three games in a row, this late in the season and
with so much at stake.</TE>
<TE>   "Tonight was the first time I felt like we were putting too much
pressure on ourselves," McInnis said after scoring the last of his 20
points.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers played like a team that knew what to do in the first
half against the Suns. They simply didn't get the job done--missing
open shots, failing to adequately defend and generally making a mess
of the first 24 minutes. They tied a season low with 32 points by
halftime. They also scored 32 points en route to a 30-point loss Dec.
14 against the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   Down, 43-25, after a 19-2 Phoenix run late in the half, the
Clippers regrouped. A 7-0 Clipper run to end the half cut their
deficit to a more manageable 43-32. Next, power forward Elton Brand
scored two of his team-leading 23 points on free throws and McInnis
made a three-pointer to start the third quarter, and suddenly the
Clippers were within 43-37.</TE>
<TE>   A 10-0 run late in the third vaulted the Clippers into the lead,
66-63. Things stayed tight until the end, when Marbury made his tying
three-pointer after a defensive breakdown.</TE>
<TE>   McInnis and Corey Maggette were supposed to switch defensive
assignments if McInnis got picked off by a Sun. When it happened,
Maggette stayed with his man and left McInnis to scramble after
Marbury.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all mental plays," McInnis said. "We didn't switch and
Stephon made the big three. It's playoff time now. One mistake could
mean the season."</TE>
<TE>   McInnis and his teammates gathered around Gentry, who gave them
several options with the ball at half court after the timeout. First,
Miles could find Quentin Richardson for a medium-range jumper or a
quick drive to the basket. Second, Miles could go to Brand on the low
block. Third, Miles could give it to McInnis.</TE>
<TE>   "Stephon cut me off from where I wanted to go," McInnis said. "So
I stepped back and hit the shot. I wanted to get as close as I could.
I had no intention of taking a deep shot. Stephon played good
defense. I just had to let it go."</TE>
<TE>   McInnis jogged away in a mild celebration and his teammates
sprinted from the bench to mob him. They weren't about to quibble
about the way things transpired Friday. A victory was a victory.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody stepped up tonight," Brand said. "It was definitely one
of our better wins. We regrouped at halftime. The guys hit big shots.
We definitely needed that one. If we lost, [tonight's game against
Utah] wouldn't mean anything. Now it means something."</TE>

<HD>Maggette Bemoans Missed Free Throw in His Return</HD>

<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>Clipper forward Corey Maggette said he felt fine after playing his
first game since dislocating two bones in his right hand after
punching the scorer's table in disgust Feb. 21 against the Orlando
Magic.</LD>
<LD>   His hand felt fine. His left knee, upon which he had arthroscopic
surgery while he was on the injured list, felt fine. His conditioning
was fine. His defense was fine.</LD>
<LD>   "It was fine," Maggette said. "Everything's good. It was great
going out there and playing however many minutes I played. I would
have been happy if I played only one minute."</LD>
<TE>   For the record, Maggette scored five points in eight minutes in
the Clippers' victory over the Phoenix Suns. He made one of two free
throws with nine seconds to play, which enabled the Suns to rally to
tie the score, 94-94, on Stephon Marbury's three-point basket with
three seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm disappointed I missed that free throw," Maggette said. "It
slipped."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Alvin Gentry did not place any limits on Maggette's playing
time before the game but wasn't about to start him in place of
Tremaine Fowlkes--at least not yet. Fowlkes has started at small
forward since Feb. 25.</TE>
<TE>   Maggette had been starting in place of the injured Lamar Odom.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got to try to work him into the rotation now," Gentry said.
"I thought he was fine and did a good job."</TE>
<TE>   In order to make room on the roster for Maggette, the Clippers put
forward Obinna Ekezie on the injured list because of tendinitis in
his left knee.</TE>

<HD>Jordan Gives Immediate Power Boost</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dodgers hoped there would not be a vast drop-off in power when
they traded slugger Gary Sheffield to the Atlanta Braves in a
four-player deal that brought them Brian Jordan.</LD>
<LD>   In the Dodgers' first game at Dodger Stadium since last October,
Jordan showed Friday night that there is reason for optimism.</LD>
<LD>   For the second night in a row, Jordan hit a three-run homer as the
Dodgers defeated the Cleveland Indians, 8-4, in an exhibition before
an announced crowd of 22,022.</LD>
<TE>   It was the third homer of the spring for the 35-year-old Jordan,
who batted .295 with 25 homers and 97 runs batted in last season.
Jordan began Friday's game with six homers at Dodger Stadium and was
happy to christen his new home as he prepares for the season opener
against the San Francisco Giants.</TE>
<TE>   "It felt good to start off like that," he said. "It will feel even
better Tuesday."</TE>
<TE>   Dodger left-hander Odalis Perez, also acquired in the Sheffield
trade, gave up four runs and nine hits in five innings as the Dodgers
faced the Indians at home for the first time since 1966. Perez struck
out three, walked one and also hit a batter.</TE>
<TE>   Perez, who will follow Kevin Brown and Hideo Nomo in the rotation,
gave up three runs in the fourth on consecutive singles by Jim Thome,
Wil Cordero, Ricky Gutierrez and Milton Bradley and a sacrifice fly
to right field by pitcher Chuck Finley.</TE>
<TE>   Finley, who gave up six runs--four earned--and six hits in four
innings, surrendered Jordan's blast in the first inning after leadoff
batter Dave Roberts drew a walk and Shawn Green did the same one out
later.</TE>
<TE>   Up stepped Jordan, who hit a three-run shot against Miguel Batista
in the Dodgers' 7-5 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks Thursday
night at Las Vegas. Finley was ahead in the count, 0 and 2, when
Jordan hit a blast into the left-field pavilion.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm starting to feel comfortable," said Jordan, who also lined
out to right field and hit a fly ball to right.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mike Piazza of the New York Mets has no regrets about the way he
responded after being hit with a pitch by Dodger reliever Guillermo
Mota in an exhibition game Thursday at Vero Beach, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Mota hit Piazza with a 3-and-0 pitch in the seventh inning. After
he was replaced by a pinch-runner, Piazza remained on the bench, then
confronted Mota when the pitcher passed the Mets' bench on the way to
the clubhouse in the middle of the eighth. Piazza walked alongside
Mota, then grabbed his shirt and both benches emptied. No punches
were thrown.</TE>
<TE>   "Under the circumstances, I was actually pretty restrained,"
Piazza told the Associated Press on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "Especially in a situation like that, it's a 3-0 pitch ... a big
league pitcher doesn't miss that badly. That's ridiculous," Piazza
said.</TE>
<TE>   It was the fourth time that Piazza had been hit in 19 spring
games. Five days earlier, he had been hit with a pitch by Montreal's
Britt Reames.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe [Mota] was a little bit in the wrong place at the wrong
time. I'm sure that's a little bit evident," Piazza said.</TE>
<TE>   Mota, acquired last Saturday in a trade for Matt Herges, is
working to improve his mechanics and movement on his fastball.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got a guy out there, a young pitcher," Dodger Manager Jim
Tracy said. "Obviously, control is an issue with this guy. I'd like
to say his control would be that good, but it's not."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Roberts, who spent eight years in the Indians' organization before
winning the center field job with the Dodgers this spring, said it
would be strange to face his former team.</TE>
<TE>   "They were the first organization that gave me the opportunity to
play in the big leagues, and so I'll definitely always be grateful
for that," Roberts said. "But it's definitely business and I've got
to take care of my business."</TE>
<TE>   Roberts did not waste any time.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Lawton, the Indians' leadoff hitter, belted a pitch from
Perez to the wall in center field, where Roberts made a leaping catch
for the first out of the game. Roberts walked in his first at-bat,
struck out with two runners on in the second, bunted for a base hit
and scored a run in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The outfield fence at Dodger Stadium is emblazoned with images of
former Dodgers celebrating the stadium's 40th anniversary.</TE>
<TE>   The players and managers featured between numerals that mark the
passing of each decade are: Tommy Davis, Sandy Koufax, Wes Parker,
Don Drysdale, Maury Wills, Don Sutton, Steve Garvey, Ron Cey, Reggie
Smith, Steve Yeager, Fernando Valenzuela, Orel Hershiser, Steve Sax,
Kirk Gibson, Tommy Lasorda, Ramon Martinez, Brett Butler, Eric
Karros, Brown and Green.</TE>

<TE>   Andy Ashby will start today for the Dodgers against Cleveland's
Danys Baez at 1:10 p.m. After the game, the Dodgers will fly to
Seattle. They play the Mariners Sunday with left-handers Kazuhisa
Ishii and Omar Daal scheduled to pitch for the Dodgers.</TE>

<TE>   Update--Defenseman Keith Carney is doubtful because of a deep cut
on his right elbow suffered in Thursday's game against Phoenix. The
Ducks recalled defenseman Aris Brimanis from minor league Cincinnati.
The Canucks are pushing for a playoff spot, having won seven of nine
games. Vancouver has allowed only 14 goals in its last nine games.
Duck defenseman Oleg Tverdovsky, whose consecutive-games played
streak ended at 363 Wednesday because of a groin injury, did not
skate with the team Friday but is hoping to play tonight. A Duck
victory would move them past Nashville into 13th place in the Western
Conference.</TE>

<HD>Comments a Surprise to Fife</HD>

<LD>Indiana guard Dane Fife was once defiant in his support of former
coach Bob Knight. Fife was one of several Hoosiers who threatened to
transfer after Knight was fired two years ago by Indiana President
Miles Brand.</LD>
<LD>   Yet even Fife was taken aback this week by comments from former
Hoosiers who said they would be rooting against Indiana.</LD>
<LD>   The comments were made by Pat Knight, Bob's son, and longtime
Indiana employee Steve Downing, both of whom are now employees of
Texas Tech.</LD>
<TE>   "I love the kids to death," Pat Knight told the Avalanche-Journal
in Lubbock. "I have no feelings for [Coach] Mike Davis at all."</TE>
<TE>   Fife's reaction?</TE>
<TE>   "I was a bit surprised at what they said because I think we had a
great relationship," Fife said. "But they have their issues with
Indiana, and at the same time I understand that. But, you know, I was
surprised. That's basically what I'm going to say."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma Coach Kelvin Sampson said he hopes his father, Ned, will
be able to attend today's game against Indiana.</TE>
<TE>   Ned Sampson, 72, had surgery last week in San Jose to remove a
blood clot on his brain. Kelvin Sampson said his dad did make the
trip to Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   "The trip took a lot out of him," the Sooner coach said. "He's
tuckered out. He's really tired. They had to drain fluid from around
his brain on Monday or Tuesday before he left. So this is something
he's still recovering from. He had major surgery."</TE>
<TE>   A few Oklahoma players were heartened after visiting the elder
Sampson in the hospital last week.</TE>
<TE>   An interview room filled with reporters erupted in laughter when
Oklahoma guard Ebi Ere described his visit with Ned Sampson.</TE>
<TE>   "For a man that just had surgery on his head, had fluid taken out,
he was the happiest person I ever saw," Ere said.</TE>

<LD>Indiana vs. Oklahoma</LD>
<LD>   At Georgia Dome in Atlanta</LD>
<LD>   3 p.m., channel 2</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   STYLE OF PLAY: Oklahoma thrives on rattling opponents with its
physical, suffocating defense while talking the most trash of any
team in the Final Four. The stingy Sooners are giving up only 64.4
points while getting 9.1 steals a game. Indiana, which began the
tournament averaging 70.2 points, prefers to slow things down in the
half-court and dump the ball low to silky forward Jared Jeffries. And
when he's being double-teamed, Jeffries gladly kicks the ball out to
Hoosier perimeter shooters, who are knocking down 50.9% of their
three-point shots in the tournament. Against Kent State, Indiana made
15 of 19 three-pointers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MATCHUP TO WATCH: Quannas White vs. Tom Coverdale. The point
guards are hobbling. White, a junior college transfer, hurt his ankle
in practice this week but said he should be fine, come tipoff.
Coverdale, a junior second-year starter, has severely injured his
left ankle twice in the tournament and there is speculation that he
might not play at all today. If Coverdale can't play, the Hoosiers
will go with freshman Donald Perry, who's averaging 14.8 minutes in
the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   INTANGIBLES: Sporting Cinderella's slipper, Indiana is just happy
to be here. But the Hoosiers are hurt a bit by former coach Bob
Knight's silence on their success and stung by Knight loyalists'
support of Big 12 member Oklahoma, a conference mate of Knight's new
team, Texas Tech. The Hoosiers will try to take out their frustration
on the Sooners. Oklahoma, meanwhile, is inspired by the recovery of
Coach Kelvin Sampson's father from brain surgery last week.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MAGIC NUMBERS: Oklahoma, a No. 2 seed in the West Regional, is
riding a 12-game winning streak and the Sooners have won 16 of 17.
Indiana, the No. 5 seed in the South Regional, is 16-1 this season,
22-4 all-time, when Jeffries makes a three-pointer.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FINAL ANALYSIS: Oklahoma is too strong, too deep and too athletic
for Indiana. Still, the same was said about top-ranked Duke, which
was toppled by the Hoosiers in the Sweet 16. The Hoosiers' only
chance for advancing to Monday night's title game is to duplicate the
success they enjoyed from behind the three-point line against Kent
State.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Since Arizona won the 1997 NCAA tournament with freshman Mike Bibby
at point guard, several teams have advanced to the Final Four with a
first-year player at the position.</LD>
<LD>   Aaron Miles of Kansas is the latest, a Portland, Ore., import who
revels in distributing the ball to his experienced teammates. He
averages 6.8 assists and has an assist-turnover ratio of 2.3-1.</LD>
<LD>   "Kids nowadays come into the college game so much more prepared
than they were 10 or 15 years ago," Jayhawk Coach Roy Williams said.
"The kids are more worldly, they're not as naive, not as scared."</LD>
<TE>   Miles is a fast learner. He held a 3.7 grade-point average and was
student body president at his high school.</TE>
<TE>   Although Williams pulled him in the late moments of close games
early in the season, Miles' confidence accelerated after a 15-point,
15-assist game against Texas Tech in the Big 12 Conference
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "We've played 36 basketball games and that experience has been
important to him," Williams said. "Going through a very difficult
schedule, kids are more ready to do things."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There is no team from the South in the Final Four, so a few folks
here are trying to make Maryland feel at home.</TE>
<TE>   Two billboards read, "Welcome to Garyland," a reference to
Maryland Coach Gary Williams.</TE>
<TE>   "Cost me a thousand bucks for those two billboards," he said,
laughing.</TE>

<LD>Maryland vs. Kansas</LD>
<LD>   At Georgia Dome in Atlanta</LD>
<LD>   5:30 p.m., channel 2</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   STYLE OF PLAY: It's not often that Maryland, averaging 85.3
points, is asked about its need to refrain from getting into a
run-and-gun game. But the Terrapins, who aren't reluctant to run, yet
excel in half-court sets with the inside-out combination of 6-foot-8,
260-pound power forward Lonny Baxter (thunder) and 6-3, 164-pound
shooting guard Juan Dixon (lightning), would seemingly be out of
their element in a track meet with Kansas. The Jayhawks, with their
three-guard lineup, are most at home in transition, as evidenced by
their nation-leading 91-point average. But Maryland might not want to
slow it down much, either, because Kansas is shooting 50.8% and four
of its top five scorers are shooting at least 50.5%.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MATCHUP TO WATCH: Steve Blake vs. Aaron Miles. Often in the NCAA
tournament, teams' fortunes are determined in the backcourt. This
duel of point guards features Blake, a third-year starter who,
although he was scoreless at the time, waved off a play drawn up for
Dixon in the regional final against Connecticut and made a clutch
three-point basket, against Miles, a pass-first, shoot-second
freshman in the mold of Jacque Vaughn.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   INTANGIBLES: Kansas Coach Roy Williams is as superstitious as they
come. So imagine how startled he was to find out that, should his
Jayhawks get bounced by Maryland, the Terrapins would be playing the
2,002nd game in school history Monday night for the 2002 title.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MAGIC NUMBERS: Maryland, top seeded in the East regional, has won
17 of its last 18 games and is making 85.7% of its free throws in the
tournament, second-best in NCAA history. Dixon is the second-leading
scorer in this year's tournament with 104 points in four games.
Kansas, top seeded in the Midwest Regional, has won 20 of 21 and has
the top two rebounders in the tournament, Drew Gooden at 13 and Nick
Collison at 11.5. Kansas guard Jeff Boschee has made at least one
three-point basket in 35 consecutive games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FINAL ANALYSIS: On paper, Kansas should run Maryland out of the
Georgia Dome. But the Jayhawks, with a freshman point guard, have
been skittish at times, especially against Holy Cross in the first
round and against Illinois in the Elite Eight. Maryland, with its top
seven scorers returning from last year's Final Four team and Baxter,
Blake and Dixon having started together for the last three seasons,
doesn't figure to get rattled. The coach named Williams who sheds his
tag of not being able to win the big one should be Maryland's Gary.</TE>

<HD>Singh Hoping for a Different Kind of Feeling in Texas</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vijay Singh misses the pressure of winning--something he hasn't done
on the PGA Tour in nearly two years.</LD>
<LD>   "I haven't felt that--I want to be right in there to feel that,"
Singh said Friday after shooting a bogey-free, seven-under-par 65 to
take a two-stroke lead over Northern Ireland's Darren Clarke in the
Shell Houston Open at the Woodlands, Texas.</LD>
<LD>   Singh, who was at 12 under with a 132 total, hasn't won on the PGA
Tour since the 2000 Masters, although he did win twice last year,
taking consecutive European tour events in Asia.</LD>
<TE>   Singh started Friday two shots behind first-round leader Jim
Carter, who ended up six strokes back after a second-round 73. Singh
birdied the first and fifth holes, then strung birdies at Nos. 8, 9
and 10.</TE>
<TE>   His tee shot at the par-three, 175-yard 16th wound up in the
bunker to the left and behind the hole, but Singh's shot out of the
sand from 54 feet away found the cup, breaking a tie with Clarke for
the lead. Singh also finished with a flourish, rolling in a 12-footer
at No. 18 for his final birdie.</TE>
<TE>   Clarke matched Singh's 65; and J.P. Hayes, who had a 68, was three
strokes back at nine under.</TE>
<TE>   Clarke had eight birdies--including the final two holes--and a
single bogey.</TE>
<TE>   "I kept hitting it to 10, 15 feet, kept giving myself chances
everywhere," Clarke said.</TE>
<TE>   Hays, from El Paso, made the cut for only the third time in his
eight tournaments this year. He started Friday with one birdie and 10
pars, then birdied Nos. 12, 13 and 15 in his bogey-free 68.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dana Quigley, seeking his second consecutive Senior PGA Tour
victory, shot a seven-under 63 to take a two-stroke lead in the
Emerald Coast Classic at Milton, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Eichelberger had a hole in one in his round of 65 on the
Moors Golf Club. Quigley, who won the Siebel Classic in Silicon
Valley two weeks ago and is third on the money list with $599,910,
credited his success this year to a sports psychologist.</TE>
<TE>   "He struck a nerve with me," Quigley said. "I really have a
mind-set to birdie all the holes. It's an amazing way to play golf."</TE>
<TE>   Eichelberger recorded the 12th hole in one of his career, using a
seven-iron on the 185-yard eighth hole. "I didn't see the ball go
in," he said.</TE>

<HD>Stronach Keeping His Plans on Track</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Despite struggles, most notably at Gulfstream
Park, Canadian forges ahead with purchase of Lone Star Park.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shortly after Bobby Frankel won this year's Santa Anita Handicap with
Milwaukee Brew, the Hall of Fame trainer marveled at the lack of
interference from the horse's owner, Frank Stronach.</LD>
<LD>   "It's an easy job," Frankel said. "They send me the horses, and
then nobody calls. Even in the paddock, [Stronach] wasn't interested
in me. All he wanted to do was meet Gary Tanaka [the owner of another
horse]. I feel like an orphan."</LD>
<LD>   Frankel might be an exception, since laissez-faire is not
Stronach's style, but maybe the owner of Santa Anita is ignoring his
California trainer because he's too busy signing off on racetrack
deals or trying to put together more. The Canadian industrialist
recently added another track, buying Lone Star Park near Dallas for
$80 million.</LD>
<TE>   Should other operators want to peddle their tracks to Stronach,
$80 million is a good starting figure. There's something about that
number that appeals to this wheeler-dealer. Santa Anita, the jewel in
a company that now owns nine thoroughbred tracks, one harness track
and a greyhound facility, cost him $126 million, but Golden Gate
Fields, Gulfstream Park and now Lone Star were all acquired for
outlays of about $80 million. Stronach was even prepared to pay $80
million for Los Alamitos but was turned down.</TE>
<TE>   Since Stronach began his plunge, outdistancing Churchill Downs and
other suitors in coming away with Santa Anita at the end of 1998, he
has turned the game upside down, but he has yet to turn it around. At
Gulfstream, where they ran the $1-million Florida Derby two weeks
ago, horsemen and bettors are staggering toward the finish of the
longest and, arguably, most tumultuous season.</TE>
<TE>   Since the 90-day meet began, there has been a horse shortage, a
familiar national problem that has given Gulfstream a taste of
reality. The closing of the stable area at Hialeah, the faded relic
of South Florida's halcyon days, is partly responsible. For whatever
reasons, many afternoons the cards are unattractive and betting is
off about $1 million a day.</TE>
<TE>   A weekend concert series, which Gulfstream promotes more than its
racing, has hardly helped. It's Cyndi Lauper one day, Three Dog Night
another, and although Gregg Allman and other acts might draw
thousands of people to a backyard concert park, they are not bettors
in the true sense. Their contribution to the handle is paltry.</TE>
<TE>   What the concert-goers do mostly is clog the traffic in and out of
the track. One day, Irv Cowan, the owner of champion filly Hollywood
Wildcat and a serious player, was 90 minutes getting in.</TE>
<TE>   "Can you imagine how much they lost out on handle while I was
sitting in my car?" Cowan said to friends.</TE>
<TE>   Another day, Shug McGaughey, a prominent trainer, was caught in a
similar traffic snarl.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey," he pleaded to one of the city cops, "I got a horse to
saddle in the next race and I got to get in there. Any way you can
get me through?"</TE>
<TE>   "You got a horse to saddle?" asked the incredulous cop. "Are they
running horses in there today too?"</TE>
<TE>   Concerts with horseracing are not new. Del Mar has been mixing the
two for several years. Some track executives believe that just
getting a younger crowd to visit the grounds gives the tracks a shot
at expanding their market. More than 20 years ago, the New York
tracks hired one Ted Demmon, a whiz-bang from the fast-food ranks, to
hype business. Demmon immediately launched a series of post-race
concerts and outre promotions.</TE>
<TE>   One fall at Belmont Park, Demmon outdid himself. The cast of
"Dallas," the enormously successful TV soap opera, was on hiatus
because of an actors' strike and Demmon hired, for a reported
$40,000, Larry Hagman, who played J.R. Ewing, the nefarious linchpin
of the show. Before, between and during races, Belmont was a
whirligig of Demmon-inspired "Dallas" knockoffs. There was a "Who
Shot J.R.?" contest; there was a J.R. look-alike competition; and
Hagman, astride a Tennessee walker, even led the horses in a post
parade.</TE>
<TE>   The sawed-off Demmon bounced around Belmont, dressed in Western
garb and wearing a cowboy hat bigger than he was. Several of his
lieutenants wore matching hats.</TE>
<TE>   "They paid $5,000 for those hats," the head of one of Belmont's
budget-strapped departments grumbled. "Can you imagine me going to
Jim Heffernan [president of the track] and asking for $5,000 to buy
cowboy hats?"</TE>
<TE>   Not any more than imagining Frank Stronach writing a check to pay
Styx for a concert on Florida Derby day. Good thing for the
Gulfstream coffers that Styx didn't ask for $80 million. Stronach's
just in love with that figure.</TE>

<KH>BOYS' SOCCER PLAYER OF THE YEAR</KH>
<HD>Los Alamitos Finds Its Drive With Kolovos</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN ORTEGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ask Cameron Kolovos of the Los Alamitos High boys' soccer team what
his height and weight is and he'll say 5 feet 7 and 140 pounds.</LD>
<LD>   Pose the same question to Griffin Coach Trey Scharlin and he'll
tell you Kolovos is 5-5 and "a buck thirty-five."</LD>
<LD>   There is no dispute, however, about the large role the senior
midfielder played in Los Alamitos' drive to the Southern Section
Division II title.</LD>
<TE>   The Griffins (27-1-1) posted 19 shutouts and gave up a minuscule
12 goals to earn a No. 3 ranking in Student Sports magazine's latest
national winter soccer poll. But Kolovos directed an offense that
averaged nearly three goals a game.</TE>
<TE>   "He's beautiful to watch," Scharlin said of The Times' player of
the year. "He's very talented on the ball. He sees the field better
than anyone."</TE>
<TE>   That talent and vision make Kolovos a very dangerous player,
according to Huntington Beach Marina Coach Jeff Schofield. His Viking
squad handed Los Alamitos its only loss of the season, 1-0, in a
semifinal of the Long Beach Millikan tournament in December, but
dropped 3-1 and 5-1 decisions to the Griffins in Sunset League play.</TE>
<TE>   "He just makes things happen," Schofield said. "When he gets the
ball, something is going to happen."</TE>
<TE>   That wasn't always the case.</TE>
<TE>   Kolovos, who has committed to the University of San Francisco, was
often knocked off the ball by bigger and stronger defenders during
his first varsity season as a sophomore.</TE>
<TE>   "He was fine going forward," Scharlin said. "But he had problems
with his back to a defender."</TE>
<TE>   Los Alamitos failed to make the playoffs two years ago, but things
began to change last season when the Griffins won the league title
and advanced to the semifinals of the Division I playoffs before
losing, 3-2, in double overtime to eventual champion Millikan.</TE>
<TE>   Moving Mike Munoz from his outside midfield position to forward
and giving Kolovos more responsibility at center midfield played a
big part in Los Alamitos' improvement. The two worked very well
together, as did Kolovos and forward Jon Bornstein this season.</TE>
<TE>   "My coaches did a real good job teaching me how to break down
defenses," Kolovos said of his improvement. "About 80% of it was
mental. All the tactical stuff and skills came really easy to me."</TE>
<TE>   Los Alamitos was 13-1-1 after its first 15 games, but Kolovos said
a 3-1 victory at Marina in the second game of Sunset League play and
a 4-0 victory over Anaheim Esperanza in the fifth league contest set
the tone for the rest of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "Once we beat Marina on the road, everything started clicking,"
Kolovos said. "And when we beat Esperanza, we made it a goal to try
and go 10-0 in league play."</TE>
<TE>   The Griffins capped a perfect league season with a 4-1 victory at
Esperanza before beating Valencia, 4-0, Newport Harbor, 4-0, and
Riverside Rubidoux, 2-0, in the first three rounds of the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   That was followed by a 3-1 victory over La Puente Nogales in the
semifinals and a 1-0 defeat of powerful Irvine Woodbridge in the
championship game at La Mirada High.</TE>
<TE>   "We never looked ahead," Kolovos said. "But after [going 10-0 in
league play], the team attitude and spirit was definitely to win [the
Southern Section title]. Anything less would have been a
disappointment. Anything less than a [Southern Section] title would
have been unacceptable."</TE>

<HD>A First for Headley?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Trainer Bruce Headley has dominated the Potrero Grande Breeders' Cup
Handicap in recent years.</LD>
<LD>   His horses have won the Grade II, which carries a $200,000 purse,
three of the last four years. Headley scored with Son Of A Pistol in
1998 and Kona Gold the last two years.</LD>
<LD>   Neither of those horses will be running in the 20th renewal of the
Potrero Grande this afternoon at Santa Anita, but Headley can win the
race again and accomplish a first.</LD>
<TE>   Kalookan Queen, who is trained by Headley for owner Luis Asistio,
will try to become the first female to win the 61/2-furlong race.
Very Subtle, who won the 1987 Breeders' Cup Sprint, was second to
Gulch in the 'Grande in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   A 6-year-old Lost Code mare, Kalookan Queen has been worse than
third only once in 19 starts, winning eight times. Five of her
victories have come at Santa Anita, including her first Grade I win
when she took the Santa Monica Handicap on Jan. 26.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Solis, the meet's leading rider, will be trying for his third
consecutive win in the Potrero Grande as he takes his usual place
atop Kalookan Queen, who, most recently, was second to Above
Perfection in the Las Flores Handicap on Feb. 23.</TE>
<TE>   Other contenders include Romanzo, who has won two in a row for
trainer Dean Greenman; Elaborate, who will be adding blinkers in
hopes of ending a six-race losing streak; Alyzig, the runner-up at
19-1 to Snow Ridge in the San Carlos Handicap four weeks ago; Ceeband
and Reba's Gold.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The ninth is a wide-open turf allowance at nine
furlongs. Contention runs very deep in the field of 11.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot:  Post position three. In dirt races under a mile at
Santa Anita, the post had accounted, through Friday, for 47 wins,
more than any other spot in the starting gate.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not:  Angel Medina. The trainer was zero for his first 39 at
Gulfstream Park.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three using Richillini, Siward, Lucky
Mudd and Fire Brigade in the fifth, singling Taormina in the sixth,
using Great White Father, Valid Redress and Rock Opera in the
seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous Day/Meet Total: 1/189. Money: Previous Day/Meet
Total: $3.60/$1,114.20. Total money bet: $1,164.</TE>

<HD>Kansas Turns Out a Finnish Product</HD>
<DH>College basketball: Williams' teachings, dad's genes and a
Scandinavian heritage shaped Gooden's NBA-ready game.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>Talk about versatile.</LD>
<LD>   Kansas forward Drew Gooden scores, rebounds, runs the floor with
ease. He combines elusive post moves with a feathery jump shot.</LD>
<LD>   And he is as comfortable on his grandfather's farm in Finland as
he is in Lawrence, Kan., or his family's Bay Area home in Richmond.</LD>
<TE>   Gooden's mother's family still lives in Finland, decades after
their daughter, Ulla, met an American named Andrew Gooden. He was
playing professional basketball overseas and she married him.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew and Ulla have divorced, and she lives with her second
husband in Arkansas. But those summer days of Gooden's youth spent by
a Finnish lake have their charms.</TE>
<TE>   You fish.</TE>
<TE>   "Pike, mostly," Gooden said.</TE>
<TE>   And you soak.</TE>
<TE>   "You go in the sauna, scrub yourself, wash your body off, then you
hop in the lake," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, the lake's cold. The lakes don't warm up in the
summertime. But it's like a ritual that the Finns do."</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Gooden, a high school standout in the San Francisco area,
played college ball at Central Washington.</TE>
<TE>   He was knocking around, hoping to extend his career when a scout
suggested Finland.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Gooden didn't even know where it was.</TE>
<TE>   "That scout, he's the reason for my success right now," Drew
Gooden said with a laugh. "One of my dad's friends kind of hooked him
up to play in Finland. He says, 'You know, if it wasn't for me, Drew
here wouldn't have been born.'"</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Gooden is 6 feet 3; on his Finnish team, that meant he
played center.</TE>
<TE>   When he and Ulla--a 5-9 blond who is now a nine-handicap
golfer--welcomed their first son, a doctor told them their 9-pound
baby would grow to be 7 feet tall.</TE>
<TE>   "His mother may have had other plans, but me, as an ex-warrior, I
wanted to get him into sports, especially basketball," Andrew Gooden
said as he watched Kansas practice at the Georgia Dome on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "So I put a basketball in his crib. It was maybe about three years
before he could finally shoot with the ball.... "</TE>
<TE>   Drew was a bit of a late bloomer, first preferring baseball and
football before he sprouted upward.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't even play basketball his freshman year in high school.
His father wouldn't allow it after Gooden got an F in physical
education, mostly for refusing to wear the required uniform.</TE>
<TE>   After his sophomore year, he grew four inches, and by his senior
season at El Cerrito High, he was a star.</TE>
<TE>   Gooden never reached 7 feet, but at 6-10, he is a big man with a
small man's skills. He averages 20 points and 111/2 rebounds a game,
and he thrives in the Kansas running game in a way former Jayhawk big
man Eric Chenowith never could have.</TE>
<TE>   Not that Gooden fit in immediately at Kansas.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Roy Williams nicknamed him "Hurricane Drew" for his
undisciplined play.</TE>
<TE>   When Gooden found himself sitting on the bench his freshman year,
he called home.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'Dad, I really don't like playing here,'" Andrew Gooden
said.</TE>
<TE>   Gooden's father had a talk with Williams.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him, 'Roy, don't start him because he called, start him
only when you think he deserves to,'" Andrew Gooden said.</TE>
<TE>   Slowly, Drew came around. When he was a sophomore, Gooden's
defensive lapses once upset Williams so much, the coach threw his
sport coat into the stands.</TE>
<TE>   But Gooden went from averaging 11 points as a freshman to 16 as a
sophomore to 20 in this, his junior--and quite possibly last--college
season.</TE>
<TE>   More important, he now understands how to play Kansas' structured
and disciplined style.</TE>
<TE>   "That whole first year for me was a learning experience," Gooden
said. "I knew nothing about Xs and O's, knew nothing about team
defense and team defensive principles.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a big adjustment for me, where for Nick [Collison] and
Kirk [Hinrich, both coaches' sons], they already had that teaching,
that upbringing as far as basketball knowledge. They had a head start
on me.</TE>
<TE>   "My whole first year, I was trying to catch up with them, the
mental part of the basketball game. I think that was the biggest
part--the mental part and Coach's coaching philosophy."</TE>
<TE>   From those early struggles, a contender for national player of the
year was born.</TE>
<TE>   "I chose to wear the number zero because I came from nothing, and
because I'm unpredictable," Gooden said. "If they made X, I'd wear
that jersey."</TE>
<TE>   Jason Williams of Duke was named Associated Press player of the
year Friday, but he and Gooden shared the National Assn. of
Basketball Coaches' award, and the Wooden Award--for which voting
ended well after Williams' missed free throw in Duke's Sweet 16
loss--will be awarded April 7.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Drew had a fantastic year. I think Jason Williams had a
fantastic year also," Roy Williams said. "The NCAA tournament is one
game and you are out. Tiger Woods played in a match-play tournament
several weeks ago, and he's the best golfer in the world and he
played No. 64 and he lost. But I think Drew, throughout the course of
the season, the first day to the last day, has played exceptionally
well.</TE>
<TE>   "At the start of the season, I think Jason was clearly going to be
the college player of the year, if he had a good year. Drew wasn't
really on the radar.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's just come so, so far and played so, so well that
he's probably made a lot of those contests a lot closer than people
expected them to be."</TE>
<TE>   Gooden is thankful for the way things have worked out in Lawrence,
a place once so foreign to him that people wonder why a Bay Area kid
chose to go to school there.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know. I ask myself that every day," Gooden said, to
laughter. "But you know, everything turned out great for me....</TE>
<TE>   "Kansas plays a very traditional type of basketball, very
fundamentally sound, team-oriented. I think it took me time to adjust
to that.... I finally adjusted probably a couple of months ago."</TE>
<TE>   Just in time to leave? Gooden has asked people to let that wait
until later.</TE>
<TE>   For now, he's enjoying where he is. "Everybody wants to follow the
footsteps of their father," he said. "I was lucky and fortunate to
have my father around in my life. I just wanted to be him, whatever
he was.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a construction worker. I felt that I wanted to be a
construction worker when I got older. He played basketball; I wanted
to play basketball. He showed me clippings of him in college. I
wanted to show my son clippings of me in college."</TE>
<TE>   He played in Finland....</TE>
<TE>   Enough's enough. Drew Gooden will play in the NBA.</TE>

<LD>Center Bryan Smolinski has not scored a goal in his last 26 games,
right wing Steve Heinze in his last 25.</LD>
<LD>   Their lack of production hasn't crippled the Kings, who are
13-7-3-2 since Heinze scored his 15th goal Jan. 15 against Nashville,
12-7-3-2 since Smolinski scored his 12th Jan. 17 against Buffalo.</LD>
<LD>   But Coach Andy Murray fears it might catch up with the Kings.</LD>
<TE>   "We actually haven't needed them to score," Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether it's 25 or 26 games without a goal, whatever it is, it
didn't matter because we didn't need the goals. But we're going to
need them now.... We think in this next short segment of [eight]
games they're going to be necessary."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cliff Ronning, Nashville's leading scorer before he was traded two
weeks ago, is scoreless in six games with the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   "Cliff's been getting two or three good chances a game," Murray
said, "so we have to think those are the same goalies he was scoring
against when he was with Nashville, so he'll get his [points]."</TE>

<HD>Hearn Returns, but Only to Watch</HD>

<LD>Chick Hearn pulled himself from a wheelchair an hour before Friday
night's game at Staples Center, wobbled down a short corridor and
turned into the Laker locker room, where he was greeted with smiles
and laughter.</LD>
<LD>   "Now it's time," he said, "to come back and join the world again."</LD>
<LD>   More than three months after surgery to replace a heart valve, and
five weeks since hip-replacement surgery, Hearn, the legendary
broadcaster, returned to Staples Center, just to watch.</LD>
<TE>   "I wanted to get the feel of the building again," Hearn said. "I
wanted to see the players, the coaches, the press. I wanted to hear
the ball bouncing again. I'm excited about that."</TE>
<TE>   Hearn is scheduled to call his first game since Dec. 16 on April
9, when the Lakers play host to the Utah Jazz. His streak of 3,338
consecutive games broadcast ended on Dec. 20, when the Lakers played
without him in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   He has been in and out of the hospital twice since.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, Chickie, what's up man?" Kobe Bryant shouted. "How you
feeling?"</TE>
<TE>   "Pretty good," Hearn said, brightening. "I can still go to my
left."</TE>
<TE>   "My man," Bryant said.</TE>
<TE>   And, as Hearn wondered about the recent Laker defense, a large
hand covered his face from behind.</TE>
<TE>   A voice, falsetto: "What's my name? I'm a Laker girl."</TE>
<TE>   Hearn laughed and turned, and Shaquille O'Neal hugged him.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rasheed Wallace, Portland's leading scorer and a matchup problem
for the Lakers, did not make the trip. A lower back strain limited
him to 11 minutes in Wednesday's game against San Antonio, a game the
Trail Blazers won.</TE>
<TE>   "They obviously can win without him on the floor, that's all I
know," Laker Coach Phil Jackson said. "Their replacement is a
$20-million player. So obviously, he's a hell of a ballplayer in his
own right."</TE>
<TE>   Shawn Kemp, in the fifth year of a seven-year, $107-million
contract, actually won't make that much until next year, when he is
due $21.5 million. The year after, he'll get $25 million.</TE>
<TE>   Portland, playing to hold on to the fifth spot in the Western
Conference, probably will rest Wallace at least one more game,
tonight against Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Since the 1994-95 season, the Trail Blazers are 22-15 against the
Lakers. In the same period, however, the Lakers have won all of their
four playoff series against Portland, last year in a three-game,
first-round sweep.</TE>

<DH>Pro basketball: O'Neal, Bryant score 34 apiece and Shaq
survives a fall into seats in 91-79 victory over Trail Blazers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Lakers could lug around their regular-season motivation in their
change pockets, so insignificant is their collective drive from July
to April.</LD>
<LD>   But every so often, a game, an opponent, a moment, pulls at their
attention.</LD>
<LD>   So inspired by the deeds and words of the Portland Trail Blazers,
so displeased by their recent play, and perhaps prodded by the
approaching playoffs, the Lakers played a game Friday night that
approached their June potential.</LD>
<TE>   They limited the Trail Blazers to four fourth-quarter field goals
and won, 91-79, at Staples Center, where Shaquille O'Neal scored 34
points and took 14 rebounds, Kobe Bryant scored 34 points and took
seven rebounds, and Samaki Walker had a season-high 17 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Scottie Pippen missed 16 of 18 field-goal attempts, most without a
defender in sight; the Trail Blazers, who played without leading
scorer Rasheed Wallace, missed 28 of their final 36 shots.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal outscored the Trail Blazers, 12-11, in the last quarter,
despite taking a frightening fall over a courtside seat. He suffered
a cut thumb, nothing serious, but stayed down for a while.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to do a full body check," he said. "I took five seconds.
'OK, toes don't hurt, knees, back, neck ... I'm OK.'"</TE>
<TE>   After some games spent dragging his arthritic toe behind him,
O'Neal looked more like himself, however, like the MVP in a league
otherwise stocked with skinny-shouldered small forwards.</TE>
<TE>   With their 51st victory, the Lakers stayed two losses behind the
Sacramento Kings, who won earlier in Charlotte and lead the Pacific
Division and Western Conference by 11/2 games.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, O'Neal walked slowly, with a slight limp, to his car.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to blame it on my toe, even though it is my toe,"
he said. "Deep down, in the back of my mind, I know it's my toe. I'm
a step slow. But I'm still the same guy. I'm not rebounding like I
should. I'm not blocking shots like I should. But I'm the same guy. I
can't wait until the playoffs start. We're on a mission for No. 3."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant and O'Neal started the fourth quarter, a variation from
Phil Jackson's recent philosophy, because the Lakers had only a
three-point lead, and perhaps because Bryant had fallen out of rhythm
after a lengthy second-quarter rest.</TE>
<TE>   Early in the quarter, Pippen made a three-pointer to bring the
Trail Blazers to within 73-71. It was his first field goal after 12
consecutive misses, a streak that moved the Staples Center crowd to
derisively beg him to shoot.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers scored 12 of the next 14 points. O'Neal had seven of
them and the Trail Blazers, like the Kings on Sunday, went away. The
Lakers won in Sacramento with as taut a game as they'd played in
weeks, because they like to beat the Kings. Along come the Trail
Blazers, with their "Kobe stopper" and 18 wins in 21 games and their
second-half rise in the Pacific Division standings, all enough to
catch the Lakers' eye, and so the Lakers' effort.</TE>
<TE>   "It amazes me," Jackson said. "The importance of these games, the
importance of putting yourself out for a game, and preparing. Those
three things are a combination of things that make us play better
against teams of a higher quality."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Jackson said, as he did last year before an eight-game
winning streak flung them into the playoffs, "We have to put strings
[of wins] together, though. I still think we need to get a string of
games together in the win column to feel like we have momentum. I'd
still like to see that."</TE>
<TE>   Ruben Patterson, self-proclaimed Kobe stopper, scored six points
in 19 minutes, did a reasonable job on Bryant, and then had no
interest in playing along with the Lakers-are-OK theme.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we can beat those guys," he said. "I think we can beat
the Lakers. I wouldn't mind seeing them in the first round. I'm not
scared of them. They're not that good."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers shrug at Patterson's joy with himself, but they watch
... and listen. When O'Neal was hacked in the lane by Patterson and
stumbled to the floor, Patterson reached down to help up his former
teammate.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal would not take his hand.</TE>
<TE>   Patterson reached again, this time with both hands, and grabbed
O'Neal by the wrist. And then he pulled. Hard.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal wouldn't help, and Patterson wound up dragging O'Neal like
a mop through the lane, while everyone laughed at his attempt to cozy
up.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, with the whole thing becoming very uncomfortable, and
Bryant on the bench holding a towel to his face to hide his smirk,
Robert Horry leaned over and helped O'Neal to his feet.</TE>

<LD>Before the baseball season has even begun, the Dodgers have already
lost the pennant. Those two esteemed, knowledgeable experts, Bill
Plaschke and T.J. Simers, have proclaimed that the year is over for
Jim Tracy and company.</LD>
<LD>   Boy, it was great while it lasted.</LD>

<TE>   After reading about Omar Daal's trade demand, it seems as if the
Dodgers have found a replacement for Gary Sheffield.</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Akren</TE>
<TE>   Chino</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In reading the Dodger notes recently about Eric Gagne's proposed
move to the bullpen, I noticed Scott Boras was quoted as saying, "If
Eric's role is anything other than a starting pitcher, that's
certainly not something that was communicated to Eric and myself."</TE>
<TE>   Since when must a major league team communicate its plans to an
agent? It didn't seem to bother Gagne, because he seems to want to
contribute to a winning team any way he can.</TE>
<TE>   Seems to me, since Kevin Malone is no longer around to be taken
advantage of, Scott Boras feels left out. Good!</TE>

<TE>   I read that Dante Bichette prayed for guidance before announcing
his retirement. While it is sad to see Dante retire, I say if God
really is a Dodger (and how else do you explain the sky being blue
and white?), he'll have a similar conversation with Chad Kreuter, Tom
Goodwin and Marquis Grissom before opening day.</TE>

<LD>As we Laker fans eagerly await Chick Hearn's return, I would like to
express my personal "slaaaaam dunk" to Paul Sunderland, for the
exceptional job he has done keeping Chick's seat warm, giving us his
excellent "words-eye view" of the Lakers' games during Chick's
absence.</LD>
<LD>   While filling in for, arguably, the finest basketball play-by-play
announcer to ever sit behind a mike, Paul has maintained the
consistent high quality and objectivity that we have enjoyed over the
years with Chick. In my opinion, he has certainly earned the position
of being the "first voice" off the bench. Thanks, Paul!</LD>

<LD>All this posturing by the NFL isn't fooling anyone. They are
desperate to get back in Los Angeles. But they don't want to set any
dangerous precedents about spending their money, and L.A. seems to
have made it clear that we aren't spending our money. So they are
between a rock and a hard place and they continue to make all these
inane remarks, trying to shift the winds in their favor.</LD>
<LD>   People, we have all the power. It is up to our political leaders
to lay it on the line to them that, if they want in, they are going
to have to pay, and pay dearly. Any NFL presence in L.A. needs to be
preceded by their committing big bucks to the community. Schools,
parks, senior citizens, billboard removal and anything else our
elected officials feel we need help with. Force the NFL to commit
money to our well being. Otherwise, they can't come in.</LD>
<LD>   We all know they are frantic to put a team here. Make them pay us
for the privilege.</LD>

<LD>Once again, Magic Johnson just cannot keep that mouth of his shut. In
the last 10 days or so, Magic has been busy campaigning for the
Knicks' GM position, and lo and behold, it was Magic, not Jerry West,
who lured Shaq to the Lakers. Now, our once-proud son wants to be the
mayor of Los Angeles and lead the city to the promised land. Maybe
someone should remind him that his name is Magic and not Moses.</LD>
<LD>   Magic, you failed miserably in 1994 when you couldn't lead a dozen
or so Lakers during your brief coaching experience. What makes you
think you can lead a city of more than 9 million?</LD>
<LD>   Relax Magic, and please sit down next to Dyan Cannon where you
belong.</LD>

<HD>Too Bad Angels Won't Face Mets This Season</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The other day Angel closer Troy Percival was quoted as saying, "We
may miss Mo's bat, but we won't miss his leadership." Mo Vaughn's
reaction has led me to believe that he's schizophrenic. Let the
following serve as evidence:</LD>
<LD>   1) Confused: Mo Vaughn's response was, "I got hardware, I got
playoff appearances, I got an MVP. I've been to the playoffs twice.
What the hell has he done?" I must have missed the part where
Percival questioned his credentials.</LD>
<LD>   2) Deluded: Vaughn went on to eloquently point out that "You don't
even ... play every ... day and you're sitting there talking about
position players who play every day." No Mo, he's talking about
you--someone who missed the entire 2001 season after deciding to have
surgery right before spring training.</LD>
<TE>   3) Paranoid: Referring to the surgery, he said, "I kept playing,
they had surgery on [the arm] and infected it again. I had to rehab
my whole situation by myself. So the Angels, they better leave me
alone." An employer who's paying you $50 million has the right to a
healthy employee.</TE>
<TE>   4) Misinformed: Mo also asked about Percival, "Has he led his team
to a pennant?" Have you, Mo? Certainly not with your .226 career
postseason batting average.</TE>
<TE>   Good luck, Mets.</TE>
<TE>   Josh Engel</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With apologies to Chris Dufresne:</TE>
<TE>   News item: In the off-season, Mo Vaughn expresses his desire to go
back to the East Coast, partly because of lax West Coast fans.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Gee Mo, you never noticed this before you signed
your gigantic contract? Too bad you never got to play in Anaheim
before, what with Boston being in the National League and all. Hey,
wait a minute ...</TE>
<TE>   News item: Vaughn blasts Troy Percival for saying Vaughn won't be
missed and Darin Erstad is team leader. Mo asks, "Has [Percival] led
his team to a pennant?"</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Well, no, Mo, same as you. You don't get a pennant
for being a wild-card team. You actually have to make it to the World
Series.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Mo blasts Percival again, asking "What the hell has he
done?"</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Let's see: shown up every day ready to go, made
more All-Star teams than you (4-3), concentrates on team instead of
self. Your MVP trophy didn't get the Sox to the Series, did it, Mo?</TE>
<TE>   News item: Mo blasts Angels, saying "That organization destroyed
my arm."</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Hey, Mo, maybe you destroyed it lifting your
wallet containing the $13 million you got last year for not playing,
or maybe when you struck out 308 times in the two seasons you did
play, or by maybe hoisting some extra double cheeseburgers instead of
hitting the treadmill, or holding yourself back from joining that
fight in Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   My thought: Good riddance, Mo. At least the Angels were able to
get a major league arm for you.</TE>

<LD>After attending a great event Sunday, the Yamaha Indy 400, I am
stunned at the attendance and support from local race fans.</LD>
<LD>   Where were you people? This was a great race with a lot more
excitement than other events I've spent more money for. Maybe the
cost of tickets was too steep for a first-time event of this kind.
Maybe the weather was a factor. But maybe the promoter should
promote! In a race heavily dominated by Chevy engines, where were the
Chevy dealers? Why weren't they giving tickets away for weeks before?</LD>
<LD>   A little advice from Mr. Penske might have gone a long way to make
this successful. My party of four had a great time, but lowering the
ticket prices would go a long way to get more people out. Heck, give
them away, people still buy $6 beer and $8 cheeseburgers when they
get there.</LD>

<LD>Last Saturday, a fan defended Steve Lavin and sarcastically wrote,
"Maybe the coach should have put himself in the game and hit a couple
of threes."</LD>
<LD>   Even if possible, this wouldn't be a good idea because the team
hasn't been taught any plays to get him open.</LD>

<TE>   The future of UCLA basketball in Westwood looks bright, with a run
to the Sweet 16 and several promising freshmen on the team. This all,
of course, is contingent on Steve Lavin's taking the job at DePaul.</TE>
<TE>   John Boyte</TE>
<TE>   Newhall</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I am by no means a UCLA basketball fan, but consider these
scenarios: Under Steve Lavin, the Bruins will typically have an
uneven, uninspired regular season, then peak for the late- or
postseason. Last year and so far this year, the Lakers under Phil
Jackson have had uneven and uninspiring regular seasons and peaked in
2001, and will hopefully peak in 2002, for the postseason. Jackson
escapes criticism and remains celebrated and amusing. Lavin is mocked
and criticized.</TE>
<TE>   I understand that Jackson has a run of titles whereas Lavin's run
is to the Sweet 16. But Jackson had the league's best player on his
first tour of duty and has possibly the league's two best players
this run. Despite raves about recruiting each year, Lavin does not
have Final Four talent.</TE>
<TE>   I am not comparing the abilities of these two coaches, only the
perceptions we have of them that are widely divergent despite some
shared tendencies.</TE>
<TE>   While I'm on local coaches, I wonder if it is a coincidence that
the week all the heartwarming Henry Bibby stories came out, rather
than the stern taskmaster ones, the Trojans tanked their tournament
game.</TE>

<LD>Given Mike Tyson's history, it's a pretty good bet that his scheduled
fight with Lennox Lewis on June 8 in Memphis will never take place.
Somehow, Tyson will find a way to screw things up. If the fight
happens to take place, look for Tyson to do something to end the
fight early, probably by hitting Lennox repeatedly below the belt,
but only because Lennox is too tall for Tyson to bite his ear.</LD>

<TE>   Chris Dufresne's pungent comment about Michigan possibly being the
"Gomorrah of the Great Lakes" is clever but representative of yellow
journalism in that it doesn't tell the whole story. This story is
almost 10 years old, involves a few losers like Chris Webber and
resulted in a wholesale dismantling of the basketball program by the
university.</TE>
<TE>   He also was confused by the fact that we consider Harvard to be
the "Michigan of the East" and Stanford the "Michigan of the West".
He should have also noted that the U.S. World &amp; News Report
(alphabetically) listed Michigan as one of the 20 schools on its
Honor Roll based on ethics, gender equity, won-lost record, number of
sports and graduation rate. Now you know the rest of the story.</TE>

<LD>Will the 43rd time be the charm for Two Unpredictable?</LD>
<LD>   A 7-year-old mare owned by Ignacio Leyva and trained by Brinnard
Millington, Two Unpredictable will try again to win her first race
when she starts against eight other $2,500 maidens in tonight's sixth
at Los Alamitos.</LD>
<LD>   Bred in Arizona, Two Unpredictable, who, shockingly, is by
Unpredictable, has managed three second places and eight thirds in
her career and has made the board in four of her last five at Los
Alamitos.</LD>
<TE>   Most recently, she was second, eight lengths behind the winner, at
14-1, despite hopping in the air at the break. Apprentice Juan Leyva
will again ride.</TE>
<TE>   Later in the evening, Bee Dashing, a three-time stakes winner in
2001, is among seven scheduled to go in the $27,150 Dillingham
Handicap at 350 yards.</TE>
<TE>   A 3-year-old daughter of Pritzi Dash, Bee Dashing has won six of
13 in her career and Eddie Garcia, who rode her to victory in a
stakes Nov. 16, will be reunited with her tonight.</TE>
<TE>   Rounding out the field are Gettinouta Dodge, Corazon Caliente,
Miami Cartel, Agouti, Mega Secret and War And Remembrance.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Brisco County Bell. Virnima. 3. Red Sparks A Flying.
4. Everybody Knows. 5. Jazzist. 6. Sundaymorncomndown. 7. Brown
Effort. 8. Famous Alibis. 9. Mega Secret. 10.Topflyte.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Four!  We'll start by using Kelseys Big Sister and Brisco County
Bell in the first; Virnima and Orla Rimal in the second; Red Sparks A
Flying, the entry of Marmeta and Safe Harbor and Gary Johnson in the
third; and singling Everybody Knows in the fourth. Total cost: $12.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Solongretsina gets a big jockey change to Alex
Bautista after having a troubled trip last week as he starts in the
fourth and Fabulous Girl could be the one to catch in the sixth as

<HD>Weather Is Nicer, Course Tougher</HD>
<DH>Golf: Neumann increases lead to two shots with a 70.
Sorenstam tied for second as greens get difficult to read.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RANCHO MIRAGE</DL>
<LD>The weather improved in the desert Friday, but there wasn't a lot of
improvement in the scores in the second round of the $1.5-million
Kraft Nabisco Championship at Mission Hills Country Club.</LD>
<LD>   Liselotte Neumann held a two-stroke lead over Beth Daniel, Rosie
Jones and Annika Sorenstam after shooting a two-under-par 70. She led
by one stroke after a 69 in the first round, which was played in
cold, blustery weather.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a beautiful today," said Neumann, who has a two-day total
of 139. "I mean a little bit of wind, but compared to yesterday it
was like nothing. Very perfect conditions. Ideal."</LD>
<TE>   The conditions and a round of 71 had Sorenstam, the defending
champion, feeling good about the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "Overall, I think I'm in great shape," she said. "I probably could
not have asked for more. Being close to the lead is very much what I
want.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm hitting it incredibly well, really solid. I'm hitting some
great putts out there, just having a really hard time reading the
greens."</TE>
<TE>   Sorenstam would have been only a stroke off the lead if she hadn't
bogeyed the 171-yard, par-three 17th. She hit a six-iron into the
bunker and couldn't get up and down.</TE>
<TE>   She might have been tied for the lead or held it outright had she
been able to read the greens a little better. Daniel had the same
problem and had her caddie read them.</TE>
<TE>   "I had my caddie read them too," Sorenstam said. "I read them with
glasses, I read them without glasses. It's just there is a special
shine to the greens, and I find that very difficult to read. They are
not really green; it's kind of yellow-greenish, and that makes it
difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody told me that everything breaks to Indio, but I really
don't know where Indio is anymore. I've given up."</TE>
<TE>   Neumann, who had three birdies and one bogey, said not only
reading the greens made things tough Friday but also the pin
placements.</TE>
<TE>   "I think what was tougher today was some of the pins were really
tucked in the corners," she said. "Just on 18, for example, it just
like three, four steps from the edge."</TE>
<TE>   However, the Swede who now lives in Baco Raton, Fla., birdied the
526-yard, par-five 18th. She hit a pitching wedge to within 12 feet
and made the putt. She made a 30-foot putt on the second hole for a
birdie and a two-footer on 11 for her other birdie.</TE>
<TE>   Neumann is familiar with Mission Hills, where she has an honorary
membership. If she could hold on to the lead through the final two
rounds, it would be her second major victory. She won the U.S. Open
as a rookie in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   Neumann, who ranks 14th on the all-time LPGA money list, finished
tied for 16th last weekend at Tucson, going 68-69 over the final two
rounds.</TE>
<TE>   She had only four top-20 finishes last year and her best finish
was a tie for fifth in the Office Depot Hosted by Amy Alcott, which
will be played next week at El Caballero Country Club in Tarzana.</TE>
<TE>   She credits an improved putting stroke for her overall improvement
this year.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel comfortable with the putter right now," she said. "I've
had great speed. So if I end up with a 15- or 20-footer, I'm happier
than maybe messing up and missing the green. So I'm playing a little
bit on the safe side, I must admit."</TE>
<TE>   Neumann also credits a rigid workout regime for her improved play.</TE>
<TE>   "This off-season I spent a lot of time in the gym," she said. "I
got myself a trainer and really dedicated myself to getting in better
shape. I looked up my stats last year and realized I was about 150th
in driving distance and about 150th in accuracy too. That's just a
terrible combination."</TE>
<TE>   Daniel, a Hall of Famer with 32 victories, has won only one major
title--the 1990 LPGA Championship. She has come close a number of
other times, including a second-place finish in the Dinah Shore in
1983.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember it very well," she said. "I let that one get away. It
was a very windy day--about a 40-mph wind. I stood up on the sixth
tee and hit my shot just as the wind died and it went into the lake."</TE>
<TE>   She's not optimistic about her chances this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm probably less capable of winning a major on this course than
any other," she said, "just because of the way it plays."</TE>
<TE>   Jones, who birdied 17 and 18, tied for the low round of the day
with a 69. Kris Tschetter, who was alone in fifth place at 143, also
shot a 69. So did amateur Lorena Ochoa, Sophie Gustafson and Karine
Icher.</TE>
<TE>   Jones had a 72 in the first round after a double bogey on 18. "I
kind of felt like I lost all my Easter eggs," she said.</TE>
<TE>   However, Jones, who has 12 victories in 20 years on the tour, was
feeling better after Friday's round.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like I played the back nine as well as I have in the 20
years I've played here," she said.</TE>

<HD>Magic Wins, but Ewing Sits It Out</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orlando Magic center Patrick Ewing did not play in a game for which
he was sound Friday night for the first time in his 17-year NBA
career.</LD>
<LD>   Ewing, whose 1,175 games played rank 22nd all-time, didn't get off
the bench during the Magic's 114-106 victory over the Indiana Pacers
at Orlando, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   "It's disappointing, but that's life," said the 39-year-old Ewing.
"I've had a great career, you know, but it had to happen some day, if
you play long enough."</LD>
<TE>   Orlando Coach Doc Rivers said he was unaware he was responsible
for Ewing's first DNP-CD, but defended it as the smart tactical play.</TE>
<TE>   "They were small most of the game," Rivers said. "I thought this
was a tough matchup game for Patrick."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy McGrady had 29 points and nine rebounds, and the Magic held
off a fourth-quarter charge. Indiana trailed by 24 late in the third
quarter, but cut the deficit to five in the final minute.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando's Mike Miller had 15 points and six assists in his return
from an ankle sprain and bone bruise that sidelined him for three
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 108, Boston 82--Michael Finley scored 24 points at Boston
as the Mavericks reached their 50th victory at the earliest point in
team history.</TE>
<TE>   Dirk Nowitzki had 18 as Dallas improved to 50-22. The Mavericks
had won at least 50 games in three other seasons, but the fastest
they reached that point was in their 74th game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 79, San Antonio 76--Gary Payton had 19 points and eight
assists at Seattle for the SuperSonics, who have won six of seven
games.</TE>
<TE>   It was the second consecutive loss for the Spurs after a
league-best 13-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Miami 92, Atlanta 80--Eddie Jones, coming off one of his worst
games, scored 16 points at Miami as the Heat ended a four-game losing
streak. Jones scored only two points in 38 minutes against Toronto on
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento 92, Charlotte 87--Chris Webber had 23 points and 12
rebounds at Charlotte, N.C., as the Kings ended the Hornets'
seven-game winning streak. The win was only the Kings' second in 11
games at Charlotte.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 110, Golden State 103--Jerry Stackhouse scored 21 points
and five other Piston players scored in double figures at Auburn
Hills, Mich. Detroit's Ben Wallace grabbed 21 rebounds, and blocked
three shots. His second block gave him 248 for the season, which
broke a franchise record set by Hall of Famer Bob Lanier during the
1973-74 season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 98, New York 77--Wally Szczerbiak scored 25 points,
including a wide-open three-pointer to cap a 17-1 run in the second
quarter at New York. Minnesota ended an 11-game losing streak at
Madison Square Garden, gaining its first victory in New York since
Jan. 16, 1991.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Miami Heat put forward Jim Jackson on the injured list because
of a sprained right ankle and activated Malik Allen before Friday's
game against Atlanta.... The Seattle SuperSonics signed National
Basketball Developmental League MVP Ansu Sesay to a 10-day contract.
The 6-foot-9 forward averaged 13.9 points for the Greenville Groove.</TE>

<KH>Today's Men's Final Four / Game 1</KH>
<HD>Opening Act May Steal Show</HD>
<DH>College basketball: Oklahoma, Indiana will try to upstage
the de facto 'title' game that follows their NCAA semifinal today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>We'll try to hurry this Indiana-Oklahoma game advance story along so
as to make way for the really important game advance story featuring
Kansas and Maryland.</LD>
<LD>   We'll keep this short and tight and to the point because, while
today's Indiana-Oklahoma winner technically moves on to Monday
night's national title game, the first of the two national semifinals
at the Georgia Dome has sort of a consolation-game feel to it.</LD>
<LD>   For one, it's the first game, an opening act, something to watch
until the pizza guy arrives. All-powerful and dictating CBS has the
choice of determining which game it wants to save for prime time, and
there was never a doubt which game CBS was going to squeeze for
optimal ratings effect.</LD>
<TE>   Let's face facts: Neither Indiana (24-11) nor Oklahoma (31-4) is a
top-seeded team. In a nut, Indiana is a nice story and Oklahoma is a
football school.</TE>
<TE>   Neither has a head coach named Williams desperate to win the
at-long-last championship that will forever rid him of the label
"best coach never to have won a title."</TE>
<TE>   The presumption here is that Kansas vs. Maryland has everything
you want in a title game; too bad it's not. Too bad one of the
Williams coaches, Roy or Gary, has to leave Atlanta without a ring.
Too bad the brackets couldn't be rearranged.</TE>
<TE>   So wouldn't it be something if the Indiana-Oklahoma winner ended
up winning it all?</TE>
<TE>   It's not a far-fetched assumption if you consider the evidence.
Oklahoma, a No. 2-seeded team most considered a No. 1 based on merit,
has defeated Maryland and Kansas this season.</TE>
<TE>   You could look it up. Oklahoma whipped Maryland by 16 points on
Dec. 21 and then, quite impressively, deflated Kansas in the Big 12
Conference tournament championship game, ending the Jayhawks' 18-game
winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   You could argue Oklahoma is really the team to beat and has the
easiest path to Monday's title game, given its timely matchup against
a gutsy-but-wounded Indiana squad that may or may not field its
starting point guard.</TE>
<TE>   The game may hinge on the availability of Indiana junior Tom
Coverdale, who could not participate in last week's South Regional
net-cutting ceremony because he was in a wheelchair.</TE>
<TE>   Against Kent State, Coverdale turned his left ankle about as
severely as one could without requiring a plaster cast. He did not
practice all week and did not practice Friday at the Georgia Dome,
although he did take a few practice shots.</TE>
<TE>   His status is questionable, which makes Indiana's status
questionable.</TE>
<TE>   Will he play?</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, it's really hard to tell," Coverdale said. "They
haven't allowed me to do much on it."</TE>
<TE>   To suggest Coverdale is important to Indiana's cause is to suggest
Bob Knight has a temper. Coverdale has limped his way to the Final
Four. He first rolled his left ankle midway through a first-round
victory over Utah, played hurt in victories over North Carolina
Wilmington and Duke and then turned his ankle with 9:35 left in last
week's regional final victory over Kent State.</TE>
<TE>   Coverdale is the Hoosiers' second-leading scorer at 12.2 points a
game. He and forward Jared Jeffries are the team's best pressure
players, each having scored 70 points in the final five minutes of
Indiana games this year.</TE>
<TE>   Coverdale was off his game in the victory over Duke, but it was
his shot, his only basket, with 1:01 left that gave Indiana its first
lead.</TE>
<TE>   Coverdale is also a key defender. He held Duke's Jason Williams to
six-for-19 shooting and Kent State's Trevor Huffman to two for seven.</TE>
<TE>   If Coverdale can't go, you wonder how Indiana can make up the
points on offense and defense.</TE>
<TE>   If Coverdale can't go, the point guard spot falls to Hoosier
freshman Donald Perry, who averages 13.5 minutes and 2.3 points.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm ready," Perry said Friday. "I'm ready right now to help this
team."</TE>
<TE>   Now would be a good time.</TE>
<TE>   "He has no choice but to be ready," Coach Mike Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Oklahoma players think this is all a hilarious ruse.
Any competent Sooner assistant coach could have easily compiled a
list of injured and/or ill players who have risen from wheelchairs
and/or training tables to lead their teams to inspirational wins.</TE>
<TE>   Remember Willis Reed against the Lakers? Notre Dame quarterback
Joe Montana in the Cotton Bowl? Kirk Gibson in 1988?</TE>
<TE>   Heck, there's already been one Lourdes-like healing in this
tournament, if you recall the saga of Kirk Hinrich, Kansas' junior
guard. Hinrich "badly" injured his ankle in an opening-round victory
over Holy Cross. Williams, the Jayhawk coach, all but counted him out
for the second-round game against Stanford. Fans were lighting
candles in Lawrence.</TE>
<TE>   Two days later, Hinrich played 21 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "He was on the sideline," Oklahoma guard Ebi Ere said. "Didn't
practice, he came back that next game and got him 20."</TE>
<TE>   Hinrich actually scored only 15 points against Stanford, but Ere's
point was that he and his teammates didn't just fall off the
Boomer-Sooner wagon.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, I think he's going to play too," Sooner guard Hollis Price
said of Coverdale. "He's probably hurt, but this is a
once-in-a-lifetime chance right here."</TE>

<KH>FINAL FOUR NOTES</KH>
<HD>Top Awards Go to Howland, Williams</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Norwood;Eric Stephens</AU>
<BD>From Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pittsburgh's Ben Howland--passed over for coaching jobs at Loyola
Marymount, UC Irvine and UC Santa Barbara in the past--was named the
Associated Press coach of the year Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "Things work out for a reason," said Howland, who played at
Cerritos High and was a longtime assistant at UCSB before getting his
first break at Northern Arizona.</LD>
<LD>   Duke's Jason Williams was named the AP player of the year in
voting that was complete before the NCAA tournament began. Both
awards were announced in Atlanta, where today's Final Four is being
held.</LD>
<TE>   "I wish I was playing," said Williams, who missed a free throw
that would have tied the score in the final seconds of Duke's NCAA
tournament loss to Indiana. "We didn't win a national championship,
but at least I have one."</TE>
<TE>   Williams returned to school for his junior season even though he
might have been picked first in the NBA draft, and expects to
complete his degree this summer before beginning his professional
career.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not really worried about draft position," said Williams, who
averaged 21 points and five assists. "I don't care if I'm the No. 1
pick, or if I go No. 5. As long as I realize my goal of playing in
the NBA, I'll be happy."</TE>
<TE>   Howland guided Pitt to a school-record 29 victories and took the
school to its first round of 16 appearance since 1974.</TE>
<TE>   He showed his coaching skill by making the transition from
Northern Arizona, where his teams twice led the nation in three-point
shooting, to Pittsburgh, a Big East school that thrived on defense.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ben McDonald, a former UC Irvine star who also played in the NBA
and CBA, is in his first season as an Indiana assistant.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unbelievable, me being a teacher last year and now I'm here
and we're playing in the Final Four," McDonald said.</TE>
<TE>   He spent last year as a substitute teacher in the Long Beach
Unified School District but was hired by Indiana Coach Mike Davis
through the recommendation of Herb Livsey, a one-time Irvine
assistant who later worked for the Continental Basketball Assn.,
where Davis also coached.</TE>
<TE>   Robyn Norwood</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cal State Northridge Coach Bobby Braswell may be a candidate for
the Oregon State job, made vacant when Ritchie McKay became the coach
at New Mexico on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Braswell is in Atlanta attending the Final Four. Reached there, he
said, "I would obviously have some interest if they were interested."</TE>
<TE>   Braswell, 39, was a finalist for the Oregon State job two years
ago after guiding Northridge to its first NCAA tournament berth but
lost out to McKay. Oregon State Athletic Director Mitch Barnhart is
in Atlanta looking for candidates.</TE>
<TE>   "We have not had any contact," Barnhart said. "Some people have
called on his behalf."</TE>
<TE>   Braswell completed his sixth season at Northridge and led a
rebuilding Matador team to a 12-16 record in its first season in the
Big West Conference. Before arriving at Northridge, he was an

<KH>Today's Men's Final Four / Game 2</KH>
<HD>Kansas, Maryland Can Do the Math</HD>
<DH>College basketball: Despite their winning traditions, both
teams realize that adding to their legacies of March failure will
only multiply their problems.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>To Maryland, it's a trick solution to a math problem: Two times
(Final) Four might equal No. 1.</LD>
<LD>   To Kansas, it's a twist on physics: A team in motion stays in
motion, even when said team has been at rest the last eight years.</LD>
<LD>   But only one answer can be correct. Only one team can win
tonight's NCAA semifinal.</LD>
<TE>   A Maryland victory would soothe the sting of blowing a 22-point
lead in last season's semifinal loss to Duke and transform the defeat
into the necessary learning experience that could lead to the
Terrapins' first national championship.</TE>
<TE>   A loss would mean that the unexpected absence of nemesis Duke from
the Final Four made no difference, that for the second year in a row
the Terrapins couldn't get past a semifinal.</TE>
<TE>   A Kansas victory would erase the pain of eight consecutive early
NCAA exits and turn the frustration into the necessary dues paid for
enjoying this year's shot at a title against the winner of the
Oklahoma-Indiana semifinal.</TE>
<TE>   A loss would mean that Coach Roy Williams' first Final Four
appearance in nine years was just that, an appearance, a quick
how-do-you-do followed by a limp back to Lawrence, where he won't be
two club lengths from criticism even on his favorite golf course.</TE>
<TE>   "At Kansas, our folks think we should always be good," Williams
said. "Some of them think we should always be the best or always be
really good. That's not as easy as it appears."</TE>
<TE>   Expectations haven't been as weighty at Maryland, which stood in
line behind Duke even through a recent rise to the nation's upper
echelon. And in today's game, Gary Williams isn't even the most
well-known coach with his surname.</TE>
<TE>   "Coach Williams has brought this program a long way," Maryland
guard Juan Dixon said. "He's done a great job. Hopefully we can do
something special. I think we have a great chance of winning this
tournament."</TE>
<TE>   That the Terrapins do, primarily because of Dixon and fellow
senior Lonny Baxter. They combined for 56 points in a hard-fought
Elite Eight victory over Connecticut and match up well against Kansas
stars Drew Gooden and Kirk Hinrich.</TE>
<TE>   Dixon might be the best guard in the nation, averaging 20.1 points
with 85 steals and 99 assists. He makes three-point shots from NBA
range, penetrates quickly and draws a lot of fouls, which he converts
into points as a 90.8% free-throw shooter.</TE>
<TE>   Hinrich is the nation's most accurate shooter among guards, making
54.2% of his field-goal attempts, including 47.4% from three-point
range. He also has 182 assists and along with Gooden keys the
signature Jayhawk transition game.</TE>
<TE>   "[Dixon] is so quick and active on the court," Hinrich said. "He
seems like he can be anywhere at any time."</TE>
<TE>   The frontcourt battle between Gooden and Baxter is every bit as
intriguing. Both are Wooden Award finalists with complete games.</TE>
<TE>   Gooden, a wiry 6-foot-10 junior, averages 20.0 points and is
savage on the boards, averaging 11.5 rebounds and helping Kansas grab
nearly 10 more a game than its opponents.</TE>
<TE>   Baxter, a senior, is two inches shorter than Gooden, but at 260
pounds, outweighs him by 30. He bulls his way to easy baskets, is
shooting 55.2% and averages 15.2 points and 8.1 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we have an advantage at all three main positions," Dixon
said, giving an edge to powerful Maryland senior swingman Byron
Mouton over Jayhawk three-point specialist Jeff Boschee.</TE>
<TE>   Mouton and forward Chris Wilcox must assist Baxter in countering
Kansas' devastating edge on the boards. Besides Gooden, the Jayhawks
have excellent rebounders in forwards Nick Collison and Wayne Simien.
Even Hinrich gets into the act, grabbing 4.8 a game.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have just two great inside players like me and Chris
going against Gooden and Collison, it doesn't get any better than
that," Baxter said. "It's going to be a very physical inside game,
very intense. I can't wait to get on the floor and play them."</TE>
<TE>   And look for any edge.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas (33-3) believes its three freshmen provide one. Simien,
point guard Aaron Miles and swingman Keith Langford combine for 23.2
points a game and more energy than can be quantified.</TE>
<TE>   Maryland (30-4) believes its Final Four experience of last season
will make the difference. Even when that experience consisted of
allowing a large lead to slip away against Duke.</TE>
<TE>   "That game, you know, it just stays with you. You can't get rid of
it," Gary Williams said. "You have to live with it. Hopefully that
makes you better, for going through that situation."</TE>
<TE>   Kansas and Maryland, two of the nation's elite programs, still
have something profound to prove.</TE>
<TE>   It appears to be a classic case of an immovable object meeting an
irresistible force. But as both Williamses have learned, no object is
immovable, no force irresistible.</TE>
<TE>   There is just a basketball game between two excellent teams, and
the loser will have even more to prove next season.</TE>
<TE>   If that seems unfair, consider the winner, expected to beat either
Oklahoma or Indiana in the final. To slip would bring Kansas or
Maryland, programs that have won everything but a national title,
right back to square one.</TE>

<HD>Heitzler Sues CART Over His Firing as Chairman</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Joseph Heitzler, fired as chairman and chief executive of
Championship Auto Racing Teams Inc., responded to a lawsuit filed by
the organization earlier this week with one of his own.</LD>
<LD>   Heitzler charged in an action filed Thursday in Los Angeles
Superior Court that his termination was in response to actions he
took to eliminate conflicts of interest and self-dealing by several
of CART's directors.</LD>
<LD>   Among the allegations is that several directors sold their
holdings in CART before the organization adopted a controversial
engine change for the upcoming racing series to prevent a potential
stock loss.</LD>
<TE>   "As a result of these actions, [Heitzler] antagonized several
members of CART's board of directors," the lawsuit stated. "On or
about Dec. 4, 2001, at CART's board of directors meeting in Phoenix,
Ariz., several CART directors sought to terminate [Heitzler's]
employment 'for cause.' ... This attempt was rejected by a majority
of CART's board."</TE>
<TE>   The suit alleges breach of contract, fraud and negligent
misrepresentation, and seeks $2 million plus interest and attorney's
fees along with punitive damages.</TE>
<TE>   With the blessing of his NASCAR Winston Cup team, Robby Gordon
announced he will try the Memorial Day weekend double by racing in
the Indianapolis 500 and the Coca-Cola 600 in Concord, N.C., on May
26.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon has four top-six finishes in seven Indianapolis 500 starts
and was leading on the next-to-last lap of the 1999 race before
running out of fuel and finishing fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Although this will be his third try at driving 1,100 miles on the
same day, Gordon has yet to accomplish the feat.</TE>
<TE>   The only driver to complete the full distance in both races is
fellow NASCAR star Tony Stewart, who did it last May.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pro Football</TE>
<TE>   Johnnie Morton, a free-agent receiver who spent eight seasons with
Detroit after a standout career at USC, signed a seven-year contract
with the Kansas City Chiefs.</TE>
<TE>   Shaun Williams re-signed with the New York Giants after starting
every game at free safety the last two seasons. Williams received a
seven-year contract that included a $7-million signing bonus spread
over the first two years of the deal.... Kicker Steve Christie
re-signed with the San Diego Chargers and is expected to compete with
erratic Wade Richey in training camp.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jurisprudence</TE>
<TE>   Unbeaten junior-lightweight champion Floyd Mayweather Jr. received
a six-month suspended sentence and two days of house arrest in a
domestic violence case in Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Soccer</TE>
<TE>   Former Galaxy defender Greg Vanney was a surprise addition when
U.S. national Coach Bruce Arena selected a roster of 18 players for
Wednesday's game against Mexico at Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Vanney, who left Major League Soccer this year to play for Bastia
in the French league, is one of only two foreign-based players called
in for the game. The other is defender Frankie Hejduk from Bayer
Leverkusen in Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's match is the last home game for the U.S. team before
Arena selects the 23 players he will take to South Korea for the
World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   The last game before the squad is chosen is against Ireland in
Dublin on April 17. The roster for Wednesday's game: goalkeepers Tim
Howard and Tony Meola; defenders Carlos Bocanegra, Hejduk, Carlos
Llamosa, Pablo Mastroeni, Eddie Pope and Vanney; midfielders DaMarcus
Beasley, Landon Donovan, Cobi Jones, Brian Maisonneuve, Richard
Mulrooney and Brian West; forwards Clint Mathis, Brian McBride, Ante
Razov and Josh Wolff.</TE>
<TE>   Costa Rican striker Paulo Wanchope might miss the World Cup
because of a knee injury, his English club Manchester City said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   A day after USC tailback Justin Fargas was hurt in practice, team
trainers reexamined his knee and believe he suffered only a mild
sprain. They will check the injury again next week.</TE>
<TE>   The team also received word that another tailback, Malaefou
MacKenzie, has been granted a sixth season of eligibility by the
NCAA. MacKenzie, who redshirted in 1998 because of injury, sat out
last season because of a knee sprain and the death of his father in
Western Samoa.</TE>
<TE>   Olympic champion Rulon Gardner plans to return to wrestling after
losing a toe to frostbite while stranded in Wyoming's backcountry.</TE>
<TE>   Gardner said he was "relaxed and comfortable" one day after the
amputation of the middle toe on his right foot. Doctors were
optimistic he will not lose any more toes.</TE>
<TE>   Olympian Amy Peterson, competing in the United States for the
final time, was second in the 500 and 1,000 meters as the U.S.
women's team qualified for the final of the World Short Track
Speedskating Team Championships at West Allis, Wis.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. men failed to advance. Rusty Smith won the 500 and 1,000,
but the team finished four points behind Italy and Canada.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. team was without Olympic medalist Apolo Anton Ohno.</TE>

<HD>Oklahoma Stays With the Program</HD>
<DH>Final Four: Sooners stop Duke, 86-71, and reach their first
NCAA women's title game, 12 years after team nearly disbanded.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN ANTONIO</DL>
<LD>The first meeting between the Duke Blue Devils and the Oklahoma
Sooners will be remembered as the night the Oklahoma program, which
was nearly dropped by its administration 12 years ago, reached
unprecedented heights.</LD>
<LD>   By running a game but ultimately short-handed Duke team into the
ground Friday, the Sooners advanced for the first time to the NCAA
championship game with an 86-71 victory before 29,615 at the
Alamodome.</LD>
<LD>   The Sooners (32-3) will play Connecticut on Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   "There's no way we win this game without having played in the Big
12," Oklahoma Coach Sherri Coale said. "We've been tested and tested
by having to play Baylor, Colorado, Texas.... I'm proud of the way we
did this, by playing together and keeping our poise when Duke made
its runs. The way these players handle their business never ceases to
amaze me."</TE>
<TE>   Four Sooners finished in double figures as Oklahoma shot 46% from
the field. The leader was a surprise. Senior guard Rosalind Ross, who
says she is playing on a right knee "held together by one ligament,"
burned the Blue Devils for a career-high 26 points and 10 rebounds.
Stacey Dales added 17 points, Caton Hill had 14 points and LaNeishea
Caufield 12.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma also corralled the Duke starting backcourt. Sophomore
Alana Beard, who had carried Duke (31-4) to the Atlantic Coast
Conference championship and the East Regional title, scored 15 points
before fouling out. But she was hounded into a six-for-15 shooting
night by Caufield.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think they did anything special defensively," Beard said.
"It was on us. Offensively, we didn't execute the way we needed to.
It was a lot of little things and turnovers [16]."</TE>
<TE>   Duke guard Monique Currie scored only eight points on three-for-10
shooting against the Sooner All-American Dales.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew that LaNeishea had a tough assignment against Alana, who
is a great player," said Ross, who made seven of 14 shots. "We had to
help out any way we could. I felt I did that."</TE>
<TE>   Duke, which last appeared in the Final Four in 1999, when the Blue
Devils made it to the championship game, had won 22 consecutive games
and 28 of 29 before Friday's matchup.</TE>
<TE>   But the Blue Devils have been doing it the hard way. After two
players left the team before the Virginia Tech game on Dec. 6, Duke
has been making do with eight scholarship players.</TE>
<TE>   Friday, the Blue Devils were against a team as hot as they were.
The Sooners, whose first NCAA tournament berth was three years ago,
also came into Texas blazing with nine consecutive victories and 17
wins in their last 18 games. The Sooners had two other impressive
streaks working this season; they were 12-0 against nonconference
opponents and 10-0 on neutral courts.</TE>
<TE>   Duke started out fine, leading, 13-7, at the 5:22 mark. But
Oklahoma's defense tightened. Then the Sooners put a 20-2 run on the
Blue Devils and remained in charge the rest of the half. The Blue
Devils' only field goal during their six-minute freeze was Beard's
layup.</TE>
<TE>   It looked for a moment that Duke would recover, closing within
29-24 on a free throw by Iciss Tillis, who finished with a team-high
19 points.</TE>
<TE>   But the Blue Devils could not take advantage of two steals, with
Currie and Beard both missing fastbreak layups. Oklahoma regained its
poise and led, 40-28, at halftime.</TE>
<TE>   The Blue Devils kept filing down the Oklahoma lead until only a

<DH>Leaving Booing Behind, Potvin a Fixture in L.A.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CALGARY, Canada</DL>
<LD>It probably says something about Felix Potvin's comfort level that
while the Kings steeled themselves this week for a final playoff
push, their No. 1 goaltender spent a day off Monday on a boat in the
picturesque Burrard Inlet off West Vancouver, fishing for salmon.</LD>
<LD>   He was relaxed. He was ready. His job was secure.</LD>
<LD>   After an unhappy departure from Toronto, where his star slowly
faded after trips to the Western Conference finals in his first two
seasons with the Maple Leafs, and too-quick rejections by the New
York Islanders and Vancouver Canucks, Potvin has resurrected his
career with the Kings.</LD>
<TE>   Though he joined the team only 13 months ago, Potvin, 30, will
make his 100th start for the Kings tonight against the Calgary
Flames, his 87th in 98 regular-season games since the Canucks all but
gave him away Feb. 15, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   For "future considerations," which turned out to be a third-round
draft pick, the Kings acquired the key player in their head-turning
stretch-drive and playoff runs last spring, the most indispensable
component in their surprising emergence this season as one of the
NHL's stingiest and most successful teams.</TE>
<TE>   "It's turned out to be pretty good for me," Potvin said.</TE>
<TE>   Son of a firefighter and a native of the Montreal suburb of Anjou,
Canada, the quiet and steady Potvin rode to the rescue of a team
desperate for consistent goaltending and provided it almost from the
day he arrived.</TE>
<TE>   "He's meant everything to us," Coach Andy Murray said, "because if
you don't have good goaltending in this league, you don't have a
chance."</TE>
<TE>   Never was that more evident than early this season.</TE>
<TE>   A string of wobbly performances threatened to shatter Potvin's
confidence, thoughts of history repeating undoubtedly entering his
mind. His goals-against average ballooned to the highest figure among
the league's starters.</TE>
<TE>   It would have been understandable for the Kings to have their
doubts. They couldn't forget what Potvin had done for them last
spring, when he sparked a turnaround that carried them from 12 points
out of the playoff race in February to the Western Conference
semifinals in May.</TE>
<TE>   Neither could they ignore what was right in front of them.</TE>
<TE>   Potvin's spectacular spring--a 1.96 goals-against average over the
last 23 games of the regular season, consecutive 1-0 victories over
the Colorado Avalanche in the playoffs--had all but faded from memory
as the Kings lost 10 of their first 12 one-goal decisions and sank to
the bottom of the Western Conference.</TE>
<TE>   In similar circumstances--a strong start by Potvin, followed by a
dip--the Islanders and Canucks had given up on the goaltender.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, though, had embraced Potvin last season and he had
saved them, far exceeding their expectations.</TE>
<TE>   "We had rolled the dice a little bit on Felix," said General
Manager Dave Taylor, who traded for Potvin at a time when the
goaltender was awaiting possible assignment to the minors, "and he
had done more for us than we ever would have imagined."</TE>
<TE>   So even as Potvin reached the low point in his season Nov. 20,
giving up three goals in eight minutes against the Flames before he
was pulled in favor of Jamie Storr for the third time in eight
starts, the Kings' faith never wavered.</TE>
<TE>   That faith was soon rewarded.</TE>
<TE>   Since the end of November, Potvin has fueled the Kings'
turnaround, compiling a 2.00 goals-against average and .919 save
percentage, figures that rank among the league's best, over his last
44 starts. Their current three-game winless streak notwithstanding,
the Kings have put together the league's best record since Dec. 8,
when they bottomed out at six games below .500.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings love his work ethic, his team-first approach and his
businesslike demeanor, and Potvin and his family enjoy living in
Manhattan Beach.</TE>
<TE>   After signing Potvin to a one-year, $3-million contract last
summer, with a club option for next season at $3.3 million, Taylor
said this week that he'd be open to talking to the goaltender about a
longer-term deal this summer.</TE>
<TE>   It's a far cry from his final days in Vancouver, where the booing
got so vicious that his wife, Sabrina, often left her seat in the
General Motors Place in tears.</TE>
<TE>   "Felix was a good fit for the Kings at the time, and we were a
good fit for him--the style of hockey that we play," defenseman
Mattias Norstrom, the Kings' captain, said. "I believe it's a lot
about timing, where you go and at what time in your career. And what
kind of team you're coming to.</TE>
<TE>   "When he came to us, it was a good fit for both parts."</TE>
<TE>   For a few tense weeks in November, however, it threatened to split
apart. Or so it might have seemed to anyone outside the team.</TE>
<TE>   But even as Storr provided stellar relief, the Kings continually
propped up Potvin, who quietly worked at improving little flaws in
his game, having been assured by Murray that his time would come
again.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all about confidence," Sabrina Potvin said. "The coach
really trusted him and I think he felt that. It's important for a
goalie to have the faith of his coach."</TE>
<TE>   Potvin said he never doubted himself, even as he moved from team
to team over the last few years. After displacing Grant Fuhr in
Toronto, he'd seen the former Edmonton Oiler great get bounced around
the league for a few years before returning to glory with the St.
Louis Blues. He'd seen Sean Burke land on his feet with the Phoenix
Coyotes after unsuccessful stops elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people go through tough stretches," Potvin said. "It's a
long season. I've never been the type to give up or stop working. I
just took my time and worked hard in practice and eventually things
turned around."</TE>
<TE>   Potvin had no great epiphany; he simply played his way out of his
slump. He tends to shy away from video analysis and discussions of
technique.</TE>
<TE>   "I think playing goal is such a reaction position that it's hard
to analyze it, especially the way I play," he said. "I have my own
style. I like to stay deeper in the net and react to everything.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really easy to over-analyze it and then you start thinking
about it too much and you don't react anymore. I'd rather go on
instinct and do what comes natural."</TE>
<TE>   At this point, the Kings aren't about to question him.</TE>

<LD>Freshman Trevor Bell singled to right field with two out in the
bottom of the seventh inning to score Bryan Phipps from second base
for Crescenta Valley in a 1-0 victory over Arcadia in a Pacific
League game Friday night at Verdugo Park in Glendale.</LD>
<LD>   The win moved the Falcons (10-1, 5-0), ranked sixth by The Times,
into first place ahead of two-time defending league champion Arcadia
(9-2, 4-1).</LD>
<LD>   Kris Krise (3-1) pitched a one-hitter for Crescenta Valley,
striking out five and allowing only a leadoff triple in the fifth by
Nolan Bruyninckx. Krise retired eight in a row to close the game.</LD>
<TE>   "Me and Trevor [Bell] are like the one-two punch," Krise said.
"This is a big step forward for us. We have been looking forward to
this game for a whole year."</TE>
<TE>   Bell doubled in the first inning but was one of six Falcon
baserunners stranded in the first six innings. Crescenta Valley had
the bases loaded with one out in the fourth inning but PJ Rousey
popped out and Phipps flied out.</TE>

<HD>Hear Them Roar at the Women's Final Four</HD>

<DL>SAN ANTONIO</DL>
<LD>It took some blind faith and crossed fingers to bring the 2002 NCAA
women's Final Four to the Alamodome, a structure meant to draw a
football team to town. Lots of empty seats wouldn't convince the
skeptics that the women's game, played by people who don't dunk and
don't much want to, was worth much time or attention.</LD>
<LD>   For the skeptics, for the e-mailers who say it's wasted energy to
watch or think or read about women's basketball, who say eighth-grade
boys play a more interesting game, who babble that no one would
choose to be in San Antone when they could be in Atlanta, here are
your answers.</LD>
<LD>   The dome was packed with 29,619 people Friday. Fans clogged the
Riverwalk, caused traffic gridlock. They chanted "Boomer Sooner" and
yodeled "Rocky Top" and packed stuffed Husky dogs in their shoulder
bags and wore Blue Devil horns painted on their faces.</LD>
<TE>   They came to see Oklahoma beat Duke, 86-71, and Connecticut beat
Tennessee, 79-56.</TE>
<TE>   But they saw so much more.</TE>
<TE>   They saw student-athletes. You can be sure none of the women in
the Final Four has received $200,000 from a street agent. The large
majority will leave school with a diploma and not with the keys to an
oversized SUV.</TE>
<TE>   They saw Rosalind Ross, the Oklahoma guard who scored a game-high
26 points. She is playing on one knee. Her right knee is held
together by a thin strand of ligament and lots of hope. Did you know
that?</TE>
<TE>   They saw Duke assistant coach Joanne Boyle, who nearly died of a
brain aneurysm in December. She was on the bench Friday night, using
the chalkboard and giving high-fives with arms that didn't work for
many days.</TE>
<TE>   They saw Oklahoma Coach Sherri Coale navigate the sideline in
stiletto heels. You don't know tough until you pace for 40 minutes
wearing stilettos.</TE>
<TE>   They saw Connecticut and that alone is worth the price of
admission.</TE>
<TE>   The Huskies are 38-0 and there isn't a minute when someone isn't
asking them about going undefeated and what a disappointment it will
be if they don't go undefeated and wouldn't the season be pretty much
a waste if they aren't 39-0 and national champions Sunday night.
That's some pressure and the UConn players laugh about it, giggle
about it, joke about it, accept all the silly questions with grace
and consider the pressure something to embrace as part of being
really good.</TE>
<TE>   They saw Sue Bird, the Connecticut point guard, the best point
guard in the country. Bird has the kind of easy athleticism, the
quiet charisma, the unstudied modesty and extraordinary ability of
soccer's Mia Hamm. Bird is going to shine in the WNBA and on U.S.
national teams and little girls are going to want to be Sue Bird.</TE>
<TE>   They saw Tennessee Coach Pat Summitt tear off her pale green suit
coat in anger and put it back on in quiet surrender. There was
speculation about whether Summitt would wear Tennessee orange because
UConn Coach Geno Auriemma grumbles about the great Vol Orange Nation.
That would be too obvious for Summitt. She wore green, then turned
green as the Huskies firmly established themselves as the superior
program.</TE>
<TE>   Connecticut has won four of its last five games against Tennessee.
UConn destroyed Tennessee two years ago in Philadelphia in the NCAA
final. As Summitt said Friday night, "Can I go to UConn's
graduation?" She wants to see seniors Bird, Swin Cash, Asjha Jones
and Tamika Williams get diplomas and go away.</TE>
<TE>   They saw a sweet moment at the end of the UConn-Tennessee game.</TE>
<TE>   Auriemma and Summitt, the two best coaches in the country, have
become wary of each other, have found slights, real and perceived,
have become uncomfortable with each other. Picture Bob Knight and
Mike Davis. That uncomfortable.</TE>
<TE>   But as the players were shaking hands, Auriemma went to Summitt
and gave her a hug. A real hug, not a fake, arm's-length hug. Summitt
whispered into Auriemma's ear. It was a speech, not a false
"congratulations."</TE>
<TE>   "A lot has been said and whatever has been said and how it's been
said, yeah, some things have bothered me. But it's never been about
Pat. What Pat said to me tonight, it's gonna stay between the two of
us," Auriemma said. "But what she told me says a lot about the
character of Pat Summitt."</TE>
<TE>   You could get a hint of what Summitt whispered to Auriemma by what
she told her freshmen. "Now you can see," Summitt said in a quiet
locker room to a teary-eyed and stunned constituency, "how hard you
have to work, how much you have to want it. UConn is a great team and
Geno's done a great job with them. I admire how hard they play every
single possession. It speaks for their character."</TE>
<TE>   And it speaks to Summitt's character, her ability to unabashedly
praise her fiercest rival. Just as it speaks to the improvement of
the Final Four that the largest crowd ever to watch women's
basketball came to the Alamodome.</TE>
<TE>   This tournament belongs in the dome and in our consciousness ...
and on our front pages.</TE>

<HD>Agassi's Semifinal Win Is a Set Piece</HD>
<DH>Tennis: He moves within one victory of his fifth Key
Biscayne title when Rios retires due to injury. Federer upsets
Hewitt.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KEY BISCAYNE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Andre Agassi won one set Friday, enough to make him a finalist at Key
Biscayne for the seventh time.</LD>
<LD>   The four-time champion advanced when Marcelo Rios retired because
of recurrent knee tendinitis with their semifinal match tied after
two sets at the Nasdaq-100 Open.</LD>
<LD>   Agassi lost the first set, 7-6 (7), and won the second, 6-4.
During the ensuing changeover, Rios briefly consulted with trainer
Doug Spreen, then retired and shook Agassi's hand.</LD>
<TE>   "I was very surprised," Agassi said. "The last thing you're
expecting is for the match to come to kind of an abrupt end."</TE>
<TE>   The ninth-seeded Agassi's opponent Sunday will be 12th-seeded
Roger Federer, who upset No. 1-ranked Lleyton Hewitt, 6-3, 6-4.</TE>
<TE>   Rios said his inflamed right knee has bothered him for two months,
and he was unsure whether he would even be able to take the court.
The knee hurt when he pushed off to serve or run, he said, and the
pain became too severe to play a deciding third set.</TE>
<TE>   The 699th victory of Agassi's career was his first in three
matches against Rios.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, Agassi can add to the Key Biscayne titles he won in
1990, 1995, 1996 and 2001. His opponent, Federer, is in a Tennis
Masters Series final for the first time and has yet to lose his serve
or a set in the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Federer, best known for ending Pete Sampras' 31-match Wimbledon
winning streak last year, snapped Hewitt's 15-match winning streak
with a dominating performance.</TE>
<TE>   Federer, 20, comes to the net more than most players of his
generation, and he mixed it up nicely against Hewitt. He hit 29
winners, won 19 points at the net and lost only six points on his
first serve, which topped out at 127 mph.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never beaten the No. 1 player before," Federer said. "It's
quite a special moment for me."</TE>
<TE>   For nearly two hours against Agassi, Rios appeared intent on
making the final for the first time since winning the 1998 title. The
Chilean left-hander mixed angles, speeds and spins to keep Agassi off
balance.</TE>
<TE>   "It got to where I was almost saying 'good shot' before he even
hit the ball," Agassi said. "It's very frustrating."</TE>
<TE>   Said Rios: "If I wasn't injured, there was no way he could beat
me. I was playing much better than him. But that's the way it goes."</TE>
<TE>   In the women's final today, top-seeded Jennifer Capriati plays No.
8 Serena Williams, each bidding for her first Key Biscayne title.</TE>

<DH>Women: Connecticut crushes Tennessee, 79-56, to move within
one game of unbeaten championship season.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN ANTONIO</DL>
<LD>The grim expressions said it all.</LD>
<LD>   For the better part of Friday night, Coach Pat Summitt and her
Tennessee Lady Vols sat stone-faced on their bench, watching the
Connecticut Huskies toss in shot after shot while they struggled
mightily and futilely against the reigning power in the women's game.</LD>
<LD>   Tennessee may have six national championship banners hanging in
its gym, the last one coming in 1998. But that was then.</LD>
<TE>   Connecticut is now, especially after easily handling the Lady Vols
for the second time this season, 79-56, in the second semifinal of
the women's Final Four at the Alamodome.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, against West Regional champion Oklahoma, the undefeated
Huskies (38-0) shoot for their third national championship in eight
years. A victory would make them the second team--Tennessee was the
first--to win 39 games in a single season.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to feel weird knowing Sunday is the last game," said
Connecticut guard Sue Bird, who had 18 points, as did fellow senior
Asjha Jones. "But it's also the biggest game of the year. And I don't
think our heads will get filled with other stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee (29-5), the Midwest Regional champion, spent all night
searching for a clear shot at the Connecticut basket. All they got
was a hand in the face, with the Huskies' quicker defenders beating
the Lady Vols to their favorite spots on the floor and messing up
their plays.</TE>
<TE>   The shots Tennessee took rarely were the shots Tennessee wanted;
they were often the only shots the Lady Vols could get. Tennessee
made only 31.4% of its shots, had 10 shots blocked, and no Lady Vol
finished in double figures. Kara Lawson was the team's top scorer
with nine.</TE>
<TE>   "We rushed a lot of our shots," said Tennessee freshman forward
Shyra Ely, who scored six points. "We didn't get good looks [at the
basket]."</TE>
<TE>   Connecticut, the Mideast Regional champion, did miss shots. But
the Huskies, thanks to pinpoint passing, unselfishness and
undisguised zeal to play at a high level, never appeared to take a
bad shot.</TE>
<TE>   The Huskies made 16 of 33 shots in the first half, and 13 of 32
the final 20 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "You never expect anything like this going in," said Connecticut
Coach Geno Auriemma. "All day long I was preparing myself for
anything to happen. But the way we played defensively tonight, the
way we took it to a very good team, I'm really proud of my kids right
now. It's a very special group."</TE>
<TE>   At least Summitt and Tennessee can take solace in the fact that
Connecticut's Fab Four--seniors Bird, Jones, Swin Cash (13 points)
and Tamika Williams (eight)--graduate this spring.</TE>
<TE>   "I was thinking about that," Summitt said. "They are a great team,
and Geno has done a great job with them. What I really admire most is
how hard they play and how inspired they are on every possession.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I'll go to their graduation and cheer."</TE>
<TE>   Not all will be gone.</TE>
<TE>   Connecticut sophomore starter Diana Taurasi continued her
impressive play, with 17 points, 10 rebounds and five assists.</TE>
<TE>   After losing, 86-72, to Connecticut at home in January, Summitt
expected this Final Four matchup to be different, or least closer.</TE>
<TE>   Not a chance.</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee's only lead was 2-0, when Brittany Jackson made the
game's first field goal. Connecticut scored the next eight points and
spent the rest of the game finding ways to torment the Lady Vols.</TE>
<TE>   By halftime Connecticut's lead was 38-25. With 9:38 to play the
Huskies were cruising, 68-39.</TE>

<HD>Jordan Feels Good, Looks Good in Victory</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: In best game since surgery, he scores 34
for Wizards.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Michael Jordan got a burst of youth from his children.</LD>
<LD>   Jordan's sons were in town for the holidays Friday, and he smiled
and laughed as he watched them play assistant general manager Rod
Higgins' sons on the Washington Wizards' practice court for than an
hour around midday.</LD>
<LD>   Then, right before Friday night's tipoff against the Milwaukee
Bucks, Jordan told Coach Doug Collins: "Don't be afraid to put me in
soon. I feel good."</LD>
<TE>   Jordan went on have his best game since his knee surgery, scoring
34 points on 12-for-22 shooting in 26 minutes as the Wizards moved
into a tie for ninth place in the Eastern Conference with a 107-98
victory over the Milwaukee Bucks.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always good to see your kids, even though they call you
old," said Jordan, who also made 10 of 12 free throws. "It was fun
hanging out with them today. I just felt good all day. I came into
the game loose. I felt the best I've felt since coming back."</TE>
<TE>   The Bucks, already without flu-stricken Ray Allen, finished the
game without starters Sam Cassell and Glenn Robinson, who were
ejected in the second half. Cassell punted the ball off the
scoreboard and into the crowd after he was called for an offensive
foul late in the third quarter. Robinson was assessed consecutive
technicals for arguing a call early in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan had his best scoring night since he had 37 against Miami on
Feb. 23, four days before the right knee surgery that caused him to
miss 12 games. It was the first game in which he made more than half
his shots since Jan. 24, when he was 18 for 29 against Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   The victory helped turn the focus back on this season after two
days of speculation on Jordan's status for next year.</TE>
<TE>   That bit of drama started Wednesday, when Collins said he'd be
surprised if Jordan plays next season. On Thursday, Jordan said he
does plan to play next season unless his knee doesn't improve. Before
Friday's game, Collins said he'd been told "by the organization" not
to discuss the subject any more.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Official Must Pay in HIV Case</HD>
<DH>Medicine: Judge orders a former S.F. health commissioner to
pay $5 million to ex-lover, who accused him of hiding the fact that
he had the virus and infecting him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN M. GLIONNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>A former city health commissioner here was ordered to pay $5 million
for allegedly infecting a former lover with HIV and lying about his
medical condition.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Commissioner Loretta M. Norris ordered former
official Ronald Hill to pay the award, which included $2.5 million in
punitive damages, last month. The decision was made public this week.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, the San Francisco district attorney's office said it
would consider filing criminal charges against Hill, who was
appointed to the city's Health Commission in 1997 by Mayor Willie
Brown.</LD>
<TE>   Under state law, it is a felony to intentionally expose someone to
HIV, prosecutors say.</TE>
<TE>   "What this man did was wrong on so many levels," said Thomas
Lister, Hill's former lover. "What surprised and appalled me most was
that a person appointed as a public health guardian on the basis of
his HIV status would lie about his condition and knowingly infect
someone with HIV. It's sickening."</TE>
<TE>   Lister filed suit in January 2001 after discovering papers
revealing Hill's HIV status. Norris issued a summary judgment in the
case after Hill did not respond to the suit or appear in court. Hill,
44, could not be reached Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Lister, 36, a manager at an area brokerage firm, said he met Hill
in March 2000 shortly after moving to San Francisco from New York
City. At the time, he said, both men professed to be HIV-negative.
The two had unprotected sex, according to Lister's lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Months later, Lister discovered medical papers from Hill's doctor
that bore evidence of his HIV status.</TE>
<TE>   "When I showed him the papers, he said, 'What is this?' And I
said, 'I think you know what this is. It has your name on it.' But
all he gave me were excuses, saying he was taking medication only as
a preventive measure because a former lover had the disease."</TE>
<TE>   Lister said he soon began to feel ill, and a test in October 2000
confirmed that he had contracted the disease. He said he had been
monogamous during his and Hill's five-month relationship. Baron
Drexel, Lister's attorney, said his client continued to contact Hill
after the couple broke up and that Hill continued to deny having HIV.</TE>
<TE>   Hill resigned from his post in October 2000 after he was arrested
in Sonoma County for allegedly passing $3,000 in bad checks.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with a local legal paper shortly after Lister
filed his suit, Hill denied having lied to him, saying he had made no
secret about his HIV status.</TE>
<TE>   Drexel said the judge's decision "sends a message that lying about
sex, and in particular whether you have a disease like HIV, is
outrageous and not acceptable.</TE>
<TE>   "Especially in Mr. Hill's position, that makes the culpability all
that much greater," he added. "This has all the elements of betrayal.
Whether you're talking homosexual or heterosexuals, everyone in our
society in this day and age fears this reality."</TE>
<TE>   Lister said he filed a police report, but was told by local
prosecutors that they would not charge Hill because they could not
prove intent on his part.</TE>
<TE>   After the recent legal decision, Lister said he again contacted
the office of Dist. Atty. Terence Hallinan and was told the
prosecutors would pursue the case.</TE>
<TE>   Fred Gardner, a spokesman for Hallinan's office, said the case is
difficult because to get a conviction, prosecutors would have to
prove an intent to give another person the virus.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a new area," Gardner said. "It may be the first case of
its kind to come to this office."</TE>
<TE>   In a much-publicized case in 1989, a Los Angeles Superior Court
jury handed down a $21-million verdict against the estate of deceased
actor Rock Hudson because he had kept his AIDS infection secret from
his lover. Marc Christian, Hudson's partner, later tested negative
for the virus. A judge reduced the award to $5.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Lister said he has not seen Hill in nearly a year. He wants him to
go to jail:</TE>
<TE>   "There needs to be jail time for a just punishment. He needs to
spend several years in a cell to sit and think about what he did."</TE>

<HD>Labor Leader Wants Padilla to Step Down</HD>
<DH>Workers: Shift on bid for liquor license for a nonunion
grocery prompts call to resign City Council presidency.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a dramatic break with a traditional ally, a labor leader on Friday
called on Alex Padilla to resign as head of the Los Angeles City
Council after he backed away from opposing a nonunion supermarket.</LD>
<LD>   Ricardo F. Icaza, president of the Los Angeles County Federation
of Labor, said Padilla betrayed union grocers by breaking a promise
and dropping a fight against a liquor license for the Superior Super
Warehouse market in Pacoima.</LD>
<LD>   "The most important thing a public official has is his or her
credibility," Icaza wrote in a letter to Padilla released Friday.
"When that is gone, there is nothing left. That is why you should
immediately resign as president of the Los Angeles City Council."</LD>
<TE>   Padilla said he broke no promise and has no plans to step down.</TE>
<TE>   The split is remarkable because organized labor has been widely
seen as the key ally--in terms of funding and volunteers--in
Padilla's dramatic climb to city leadership.</TE>
<TE>   He supported the project because of a shortage of supermarkets in
that part of the northeast San Fernando Valley, Padilla said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's disappointing, because there was no promise," Padilla said.
"The needs of my constituents are important, and we need to bring
more supermarkets, banks and other basic amenities to the community."</TE>
<TE>   Icaza sent the letter in his capacity as president of United Food
and Commercial Workers Local 770, which has about 29,000 members
including workers in grocery stores, packing houses and food
processing plants. Icaza said it is the largest union in the county
federation.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to opposing the liquor license because Superior is
"anti-union," Icaza said residents of the area are concerned because
five other businesses in the neighborhood have liquor licenses.</TE>
<TE>   Mimi Song, president of the Superior chain of 13 stores, called
the attack on Padilla unfair. She said she is not anti-union just
because her stores are not unionized.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Padilla is working for the community," she said. "He is
trying to do something to develop the community."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Icaza questioned whether Padilla changed his
position after Superior hired as its lobbyist James Acevedo, a
longtime political advisor and sometimes paid consultant for Padilla.</TE>
<TE>   "I was convinced the reason he changed was [that] Acevedo
influenced him not to go forward," Icaza said.</TE>
<TE>   Acevedo, a city harbor commissioner, has reported that he was paid
$2,500 by Superior in recent months specifically to lobby Padilla,
the City Council and a zoning administrator. Acevedo lists Superior
as a client from July 1 to Dec. 31, 2001. Earlier last year, Acevedo
was receiving $5,000 a month from Padilla's campaign committee for
consultant services.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla said Acevedo lobbied him "very little" and said the
contact had no influence on his decision to support the liquor
license. "Absolutely not," Padilla said.</TE>
<TE>   Acevedo said he told Padilla he was hired to organize the
community to support the store but did not lobby Padilla directly.</TE>
<TE>   The store on Laurel Canyon Boulevard opened in late 2000, creating
more than 200 jobs. To obtain an interim liquor license, it needed
the City Council to declare that alcohol sales were a "public
convenience and necessity." In October 2000 and May 2001, Padilla
introduced motions opposing such a determination.</TE>
<TE>   Icaza said Padilla asked his union to send members to the meeting
at which the council first turned down Superior's request. But the
union was not notified when Padilla asked the council to approve the
determination in August 2001, giving the store an interim license, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We found out after the fact," Icaza wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla declined to testify against a permanent liquor license for
Superior at a March 14 appeal hearing by the state Alcohol Beverage
Control Board. The agency is scheduled to take more testimony in
April before making a decision.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla said he opposed the license at first because he was new in
office and the store was new in his district.</TE>
<TE>   "I was not comfortable going forward at that time," he said. "I
wanted to see the store establish a track record."</TE>
<TE>   The store has taken steps to help reduce crime, such as installing
more lighting, Padilla said.</TE>
<TE>   Xavier Flores, executive director of Pueblo y Salud, an alcohol
prevention group, said he and other members of a community coalition
that opposes the liquor license are upset by Padilla's actions.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very, very angry," Flores said. "We think he hurt his own
community." He did not join in the call for Padilla's council
presidency resignation.</TE>
<TE>   Local 770 endorsed Padilla's election in 1999 and provided dozens
of volunteers, Icaza said. If Padilla does not resign, Icaza plans to
bring a group of labor leaders to City Hall next week to complain
about Padilla's conduct. In the letter, Icaza said that Padilla "set
a new standard for betrayal and duplicity" in favoring the license
after previously asking union members to attend a meeting at which he
introduced a motion to oppose it.</TE>
<TE>   "If you refuse [to resign], we will work with the rest of the
labor movement and the community to have you removed," Icaza wrote.</TE>

<HD>D.A. Reassigns 3 Who Supported Bamieh Bid</HD>
<DH>Election: Bradbury says their backing of the candidate who
lost to his handpicked successor was a factor but 'did not play a
major role.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV and JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two Ventura County prosecutors and a criminal investigator have been
reassigned in part because of their support for candidate Ron Bamieh,
who was soundly beaten in a bitter contest earlier this month by the
district attorney's handpicked successor.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors Adam Pearlman and Mark Pachowicz and investigator Mark
Volpei will be transferred to the child support enforcement division
early next month under the directive of retiring Dist. Atty. Michael
D. Bradbury. Their duties will be primarily to go after deadbeat
parents.</LD>
<LD>   All three were vocal supporters of Bamieh, who was beaten March 5
by a 2-1 margin by Chief Assistant Dist. Atty. Greg Totten,
Bradbury's chosen replacement.</LD>
<TE>   Bradbury acknowledged Friday their support of Bamieh was a factor
in his decision to reassign the three, but stressed their overall job
performance was also a consideration. He declined to elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't say that their conduct during the election did not play a
role," said Bradbury, who will step down at the end of the year after
more than two decades in office. "I can say it did not play a major
role."</TE>
<TE>   Pearlman and Pachowicz said they were informed of their transfers
by a supervisor, but said they were not given an explanation nor
directly contacted by Bradbury. "I've got his explanation," Pearlman
said, "which is 'You supported Ron, you go to child support.'"</TE>
<TE>   Other prosecutors who supported Bamieh said Friday they now fear
retribution. Bamieh declined to comment on Bradbury's move.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney said he was swapping Pearlman and Pachowicz
with two other prosecutors, Eric Bond and Roger Enman, both of whom
had been promised a transfer to the felony division after a rotation
in child support.</TE>
<TE>   Pearlman and Pachowicz are senior deputy district attorneys who
have both tried high-profile felony cases. Pachowicz was one of the
prosecutors who sent Spencer Brasure to death row for the 1996 kidnap
and torture of 20-year-old Redondo Beach resident Anthony Guest.</TE>
<TE>   Pearlman was the lead prosecutor on the Narinder Virk case, set
for trial April 15. The Port Hueneme woman is accused of trying to
drown her two children.</TE>
<TE>   "My performance evaluations have been excellent," Pearlman said.
"There's nothing they've told me I've been doing wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Volpei had worked closely with Bamieh on the slaying of
20-year-old college student Katrina Montgomery, who disappeared from
an Oxnard party in 1992. Her killer was convicted of first-degree
murder last year and received a death sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Volpei, who could not be reached for comment, was recently named
investigator of the year by a statewide association.</TE>
<TE>   The reassignment of the three men could have long-term career
implications. This summer the state is set to take over the district
attorney's child-support division. Those prosecutors will ultimately
lose their status as deputy district attorneys and become state
employees, said Mike Botula, spokesman for the new state
child-support agency.</TE>
<TE>   In that capacity, they can only pursue misdemeanor cases, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "They become more of a family law attorney or a civil law attorney
than a criminal prosecutor," Botula said.</TE>
<TE>   After the election, Bradbury said he would extend an olive branch
to those in the Bamieh camp. "The most important challenge facing us
is healing some wounds and mending some relationships," he said then.
"That means a lot of forgiving and forgetting."</TE>
<TE>   Totten, who could not be reached for comment Friday, also had
talked about the importance of mending fences.</TE>
<TE>   But Howard Asher, a senior deputy public defender who has observed
Bradbury for 20 years, said this week's move is more in keeping with
his character.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no conceivable explanation for reassigning two
experienced prosecutors other than they backed the wrong horse,"
Asher said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is payback time for those people who had the temerity to
speak their mind about a political issue in their own office. I doubt
all the shoes have fallen. My guess is more heads will roll."</TE>

<HD>Man Held in Shooting at Bank</HD>
<DH>Crime: Suspect wounded a teller in the shoulder during a
robbery attempt, authorities say.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Quartz Hill man who allegedly shot a teller in the shoulder while
trying to rob a bank was arrested Friday on suspicion of attempted
murder and robbery.</LD>
<LD>   Ryan Layton, 20, was arrested at a nearby carwash shortly after
the 9:45 a.m. robbery of Antelope Valley Bank in Quartz Hill. He was
held without bail at the Los Angeles County sheriff's Lancaster
Station.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities said Layton entered the bank in the 42000 block of
50th Street West wearing a yellow bandanna on his face and
brandishing a chrome revolver.</LD>
<TE>   "He jumped over the counter and walked up and down the line of
tellers saying, 'Give me all your money. Give me the money,'" FBI
spokesperson Cheryl Mimura said. "When he approached the last teller,
he shot her in the shoulder area." He then fled empty-handed.</TE>
<TE>   The teller, whose name was not released, was airlifted to
Providence Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills, where she was
in stable condition late Friday, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses described the suspect as being "very thin," about 6 feet
2 and 130-140 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's officials said Layton matched the description "very
well."</TE>
<TE>   Mimura said this was the first bank robbery of the year in the
Antelope and Santa Clarita Valley areas of north Los Angeles County.</TE>

<HD>Holiday About Service, Not Sales</HD>
<DH>Tribute: Supporters seek to honor Cesar Chavez by extolling
activism, countering commercialization.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE CHAVEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Cesar Chavez Day White Sale," the ad read.</LD>
<LD>   Paul Chavez, the son of Cesar E. Chavez, joked this week about the
Central Valley newspaper ad, an inevitable byproduct of how we
Americans often tend to mark the passage of a holiday.</LD>
<LD>   "You know you hit the big time when someone has a sale about you,"
he laughed.</LD>
<TE>   But department store sales, lazy three-day weekends and a day off
from school are what the relatives of the late United Farm Workers
Union leader are determined to avoid as they shape California's
newest holiday.</TE>
<TE>   "We will make sure the legacy of my father is carried out in a
meaningful way, substantive and respectful of his works," Paul Chavez
said. "We were concerned that the holiday be more than just another
day off."</TE>
<TE>   Monday marks the state's second annual Cesar Chavez Day of Service
and Learning. After a long campaign to declare his March 31 birthday
a state holiday, its supporters are setting out to establish new
traditions and ways to honor the man who still is provoking political
debates, more recently over whether city and state workers really
need a day off to celebrate his memory.</TE>
<TE>   Just as the federal holiday for Martin Luther King Jr. has evolved
into a day of parades, prayer and multicultural exchanges, Cesar
Chavez promoters want their state holiday devoted to community
service and educating young people.</TE>
<TE>   "We are viewing the construction of a new holiday and all the
rights and rituals that go with it," said Jorge Garcia, dean of the
School of Humanities at Cal State Northridge and a professor of
Chicano studies.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia predicts that holiday commemorations will grow in
popularity over the years because of the immensity of the Latino
population in California and other states.</TE>
<TE>   But, what's emerging in lessons, lectures, Web sites and publicity
materials particularly geared to youth is the presentation of Chavez
not so much as a champion of farm workers or even as a Latino icon,
but as a contemporary American hero.</TE>
<TE>   Andres Irlando, executive director of the nonprofit Cesar E.
Chavez Foundation in Los Angeles, said that to keep his legacy
relevant today, Chavez is being presented as a "universal, ecumenical
figure who stood for values that transcend one particular
movement.... He is harmonious with very basic American ideals of
justice, equality and freedom."</TE>
<TE>   To help establish the fledgling holiday, the state gave nearly $5
million in 2001 and again this year to fund 64 community service
projects and education campaigns. There are the basic school
beautification murals to be painted, poetry to be read and essays to
be written.</TE>
<TE>   There are ambitious projects, like an Orange County plan to allow
2,800 second-graders from 20 schools to glean leftover vegetables
from harvested fields and donate the produce to food banks.</TE>
<TE>   In Sacramento County, elementary school children will rescue duck
eggs from a rice field that is about to be plowed under. The state
gave the so-called Project Net a $23,000 grant for incubators and the
hatched ducklings will be released into the wild.</TE>
<TE>   The Chavez foundation and the Mexican Cultural Institute will host
a community festival at La Placita Olvera in downtown Los Angeles on
Sunday afternoon, with presentations, a photo exhibit and activities
for children.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday evening, the Monterey Park Boys and Girls Club was
packed with 300 youths and their parents for a celebration that could
have been a textbook example of what the Chavez family and foundation
is aiming for.</TE>
<TE>   With a $108,000 state grant, the club designed a "World
Peacemakers Hall of Fame," with a poster-size portrait of a smiling
Chavez hanging between Mother Teresa and Martin Luther King Jr.</TE>
<TE>   The youths have read biographies about the poor son of migrant
farm workers who had only an eighth-grade education but galvanized
grape and lettuce pickers and gained national support for what became
the United Farm Workers Union.</TE>
<TE>   A photo wall gave a pictorial history of Chavez, including
pictures of his family during the Depression, Chavez limping with
blistered feet during a 1966 march to Sacramento for better working
conditions for farm laborers, Chavez fasting in 1988 to protest the
use of pesticides. He is shown signing a landmark union contract in
1970 with growers.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez Admired for His Nonviolent Ways</TE>
<TE>   "I kind of heard of him before, but didn't really know what he was
about," said Andrea Hernandez, 16, of Rosemead. "What I like about
him are his nonviolent ways. We have all these drive-bys and
violence, but he never used violence to achieve his goals."</TE>
<TE>   Priscilla Cordova, 13, of Monterey Park said she knew that Cesar
Chavez led strikes, but didn't know why. "But now I learned how you
can touch people's lives by doing good works."</TE>
<TE>   Cordova and Hernandez will be part of a group of youths who will
help rebuild a playground for farm workers' children near Chavez's
burial site at La Paz, the farm workers national headquarters in
Keene, Calif., near Tehachapi.</TE>
<TE>   Already, four other states--Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and
Colorado--have declared Cesar Chavez holidays. Across the country at
least 29 schools, 17 streets, 17 libraries and parks, four plazas and
one bridge have been named after him since his death in 1993 at age
66.</TE>
<TE>   Several cities, including San Fernando, give their employees the
day off. (Because the birthday falls on a Sunday this year, those
city and state workers will have Monday off.)</TE>
<TE>   That has come, of course, with some debate.</TE>
<TE>   Only last week a shouting match broke out in Los Angeles City Hall
when the council debated whether to allow city employees to take
Cesar Chavez Day as a paid day off instead of Columbus Day. While
some workers took a day, union negotiations will decide the final
outcome.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez supporters worry that as the holiday grows, so does the
potential for trivialization and commercial corruption.</TE>
<TE>   Backers Worry About Beer, Tobacco Sponsors</TE>
<TE>   "Look at what's happened to Cinco de Mayo with beer and tobacco
sponsors having their name on everything," professor Garcia said,
recalling a restaurant table card he saw last year promoting "El
drinko for el Cinco."</TE>
<TE>   While some commercial buy-in is important to support the holiday,
the challenge will be to keep it focused on the man and his values,
according to Garcia.</TE>
<TE>   A team of scholars, teachers and relatives worked through the
summer to assemble a Web-based school curriculum on Chavez, which was
unanimously approved by the State Board of Education last month. On
the site, users have access to grade-appropriate lessons,
biographies, videos and primary resources on Chavez.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis called on the state's about 210,000 workers to
seek volunteer opportunities in their hometowns on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Leone Tiffany, an office worker at the Ronald Reagan state
building, said she will refrain from eating grapes or lettuce on
Monday, in remembrance of the Chavez's 1968 boycott of California
grapes. Several other state workers said they will simply relax and
enjoy another day off.</TE>
<TE>   Guillermo Hernandez, director of the Chicano Studies Research
Center at UCLA, hopes the Chavez holiday will someday reach national
dimensions.</TE>
<TE>   "If someone in 1963 had said a Mexican in 40 years would have
libraries and research centers named after him ... people would have
said, 'You are out of your mind!'" Hernandez said. "But Cesar Chavez
is one of the solid foundations of contemporary Chicano leadership in
the country."</TE>

<HD>Bystander Injuries Stemming From Police Pursuits Rise</HD>
<DH>Accidents: Number of pedestrians hurt climbed to 69 last
year, nearly double the 1998 figure. Total chases also rose in 2001.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW BLANKSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The number of police chases and the number of resulting injuries
among pedestrians increased significantly last year, according to Los
Angeles police statistics.</LD>
<LD>   Pursuits rose to 769 in 2001 from 597 in 2000, the figures show.
Pedestrian injuries climbed to 69 in 2001, nearly double the number
in 1998.</LD>
<LD>   ''Any time there's injuries, there's obviously cause for
concern,'' Los Angeles Police Department Cmdr. George Gascon said.
''This shows we need to continue to assess our [pursuit] practices to
minimize injuries to the community and the officers.''</LD>
<TE>   The recent figures contrast with 1995-2000 statistics compiled by
the California Highway Patrol, which reported LAPD pursuits decreased
36%. Statewide, the five-year decrease was 32%, according to the CHP.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD also reported that traffic accidents during chases
increased between 2000 and 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Accidents involving the suspect's vehicle climbed to 372 in 2001
from 280 the previous year, while accidents involving other vehicles
jumped to 151 in 2001 from 116 in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Debate over police chases was rekindled after a driver fleeing
police earlier this month struck pedestrians Anna Polivoda, 76, and
her husband, Henry, 79, near the Beverly Center. They sustained
broken bones and head injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Tremine Tillman, 23, of Van Nuys was later arrested and charged
with evading arrest and hit-and-run driving. The LAPD says the police
cruiser was no longer chasing Tillman--initially noticed because of a
questionable registration--when the accident occurred.</TE>
<TE>   Under LAPD rules, patrol officers have the discretion to chase any
driver who attempts to flee. But Gascon, who heads the group that
trains recruits and officers, said a cornerstone of the policy is
assessing the safety risks to bystanders and officers.</TE>
<TE>   Police, he said, are supposed to weigh many variables before and
during a chase. They include traffic volume, whether the area is
residential or commercial and whether the driver can be identified
and apprehended later.</TE>
<TE>   As for any changes in policy, Gascon said the department
constantly monitors pursuits and makes any necessary adjustments in
training.</TE>
<TE>   The number of police chases had been dropping after a 1996 report
by the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California that
highlighted increased numbers of pursuit-related crashes, injuries
and deaths.</TE>
<TE>   ACLU Executive Director Ramona Ripston expressed concern Friday
over the rise in injuries and said the LAPD needs a more concrete
policy, especially when it comes to pursuing people accused of minor
traffic violations.</TE>
<TE>   ''If police are pursuing someone who has murdered, raped or robbed
a bank, that's one thing," she said. "But they should not engage in
these high-speed chases for minor motor vehicle violations. They're
too dangerous.''</TE>
<TE>   The most recent LAPD numbers show 57% of pursuits were initiated
by traffic violations, 35% by felonies and 6% by misdemeanors.</TE>
<TE>   The ACLU's 1996 report focused on whether officers should be
allowed to pursue drivers and whether any offense or crime should
justify a chase.</TE>
<TE>   It also found that most of the LAPD's fatal chases involved
drivers wanted for violating the vehicle code, generally less serious
offenses.</TE>
<TE>   Some police agencies, such as the Santa Monica Police Department
and Orange County Sheriff's Department, prohibit officers from
starting a pursuit over minor traffic violations.</TE>

<HD>Project to Help Church Stand Up to More Quakes</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Officials at Camarillo's St. Mary Magdalen Chapel credit God and good
architecture for keeping their church unharmed for 88 years, but now
the Catholic parish is spending $1.5 million to ensure it continues
standing through future quakes.</LD>
<LD>   The chapel was closed on Jan. 1 to allow for extensive earthquake
retrofitting--a project scheduled for completion this summer. In the
meantime, the 300 parishioners worship at the parish's second
location, St. Mary Magdalen Church, on Las Posas Road. The original
chapel's location in the Old Town section of the city didn't allow
for expansion, so a second church was built in 1975 to accommodate
the growing congregation.</LD>
<LD>   "Everyone--from the engineers to the architect--is amazed at the
stoutness of the facility and its survivability," said Joe Esseff,
the parish's business administrator. "It's a miracle there hasn't
been more earthquake damage."</LD>
<TE>   The retrofit project has been in the works for more than two
years, beginning with structural designs created by Los Angeles
engineering firm Nabih Youssef and Associates. Workers began boring
holes in the building's outside walls early last year to determine
where to place steel reinforcements to tie the wall cavities
together. This exterior work allowed the chapel to remain open in
2001.</TE>
<TE>   Brent Nuttall, company vice president, said the retrofit had to be
approached differently because of the historic nature of the
structure. The chapel was designated county landmark No. 22 in March
1972, so the fixes had to comply with state historic building codes,
as well as the city of Camarillo's seismic strengthening ordinance.</TE>
<TE>   The chapel has a rich historical significance in the county. It
began as the private chapel for the Camarillo family, owners of the
10,000-acre Rancho Calleguas upon which many city landmarks were
built.</TE>
<TE>   Construction began in 1912 at the behest of Juan Camarillo Jr., a
devout Catholic. The building was completed the next year and
dedicated in 1914. The chapel was built in honor of Camarillo's
parents, Juan and Martina. The three are buried--along with city
founder Adolfo Camarillo and other family descendants--in a crypt
that remains on chapel grounds. The chapel became a parish through
the Los Angeles Archdiocese in 1940.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal is to maintain the historical integrity of the church,"
Esseff said. "Luckily, we've had a very innovative construction crew
and engineering firm that have had to use a lot of flexibility and
creativity."</TE>
<TE>   Financed through the church's building fund and reserves, the
project involves securing the roof with steel bolts to the supporting
walls, adding a new foundation and concrete walls to the bell tower,
sandblasting the outside of the chapel and repainting.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, the church plans to refurbish its pews and flooring
and replace an outdated sound system.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Courselle of Dan Courselle Construction said no major
earthquake damage has been discovered during the course of
retrofitting.</TE>
<TE>   That comes as no surprise to Msgr. John Hughes, a member of the
parish staff since 1969, who attributes the building's sturdiness to
its builder, A.C. Martin.</TE>
<TE>   "They built excellent buildings, not just ours but the old
courthouse in Ventura too," said Hughes, who is retired from
administrative duties at the chapel but continues to celebrate Mass.
"Considering that they weren't into retrofitting at the time it was
built, it's actually one of the more modern buildings of its day,"
said Hughes.</TE>

<HD>Patients, Allies Protest Closing of 2 Clinics</HD>
<DH>Health: About 100 say the facilities in East L.A. and Bell
that provided care to 30,000 indigent and low-income people a year
must be reopened.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEORGE RAMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than 100 patients and their supporters rallied outside an
Eastside nonprofit health clinic Friday to protest its abrupt closing
and that of another clinic in Bell. Both were operated by the
Community Health Foundation of East Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The sudden closures leave a gaping hole in medical care for
thousands of the area's low-income and indigent patients, many of
them Spanish speakers who relied on the clinics for inexpensive
medical care. The two facilities were part of a network that once
served 300,000 people a year.</LD>
<LD>   Although staffers said they were told last week that the clinics
would close Friday, it was still a shock for the protesters, as well
as for patients coming for appointments, to find the once-popular
facility on Whittier Boulevard shuttered. Ringing phones inside went
unanswered.</LD>
<TE>   "Where am I going to go now?" wondered Dolores Torres, an elderly
woman who came for a midday appointment. "I've been coming here for
years."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the protesters called on Los Angeles County Supervisor
Gloria Molina to wield her influence to reopen the clinics, which
were closed because of $6.5 million owed to vendors, public agencies
and employees.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Molina, who represents East Los Angeles, said the
supervisor was "very disappointed and shocked" by the closures.</TE>
<TE>   In the last year, the foundation has been dogged by allegations
that some patients were charged for care that was supposed to be free
and that others were double-billed.</TE>
<TE>   Audits by state and county investigators found evidence of such
practices, and Los Angeles County officials asked the foundation's
governing board to clean up the mess by dismissing those responsible
for double-billing or overcharging patients.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, the board said it had conducted its own investigation
and found no hint of any wrongdoing. It also said "due process" must
be observed if any employees were dismissed.</TE>
<TE>   Though no criminal charges have been filed in connection with the
allegations, the protesters Friday laid the blame for the clinics'
closures and the foundation's other financial troubles on its former
longtime executive director, Rudy Diaz.</TE>
<TE>   "He's to blame," more than one protester chanted.</TE>
<TE>   Diaz, who could not be reached for comment, was forced to resign
two months ago by federal officials, who looked into the accusations
of overcharging and overbilling.</TE>
<TE>   Then the foundation's governing board stepped down too, in hopes
that federal health officials would continue to grant funds for
low-cost care for the Eastside.</TE>
<TE>   About the same time, county and state health officials canceled a
series of contracts the foundation needed to keep its last two
clinics open. Among the pacts terminated were three federal grants
totaling $3.2 million that were administered by the county.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a Molina aide said the county has arranged for the
clinic's patients to receive low-cost care elsewhere. Among the
clinics named were AltaMed Health Service Corp. in East Los Angeles,
County-USC Medical Center in Lincoln Heights and Clinica Oscar Romero
in the Pico-Union district, west of downtown.</TE>
<TE>   "There should not be anyone left without medical service who was
getting it before," said Molina staffer Martha Molina, who is not
related to the supervisor.</TE>
<TE>   She added that county officials were working Friday to interview
out-of-work clinic employees, who haven't been paid in the last two
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The Eastside clinic was a familiar landmark, having offered
low-cost health care for 31 years. It originally was known as the
East L.A. Health Task Force and later grew into a nonprofit
foundation.</TE>
<TE>   At one time, the foundation operated 13 clinics, including three
in area housing projects and four in local schools. As many as
300,000 patients received care there annually.</TE>
<TE>   With budget problems forcing the closing of the other facilities,
about 30,000 a year were being treated at the clinics in East Los
Angeles and Bell.</TE>
<TE>   Out on Whittier Boulevard on Friday, employees who found
themselves locked out said something should be done to reopen the
clinic.</TE>
<TE>   "We never thought that it was going to close," said medical
assistant Ana Telleria. "People felt comfortable coming here."</TE>
<TE>   Lourdes Esperanza, another clinic employee, added, "We've been
here for 31 years. You can't expect to phase us out in one week.
Something has to be done."</TE>

<HD>Homeless Carry Their Cross</HD>
<DH>Poverty: Marchers come to downtown Santa Ana on Good Friday
to call attention to people who live on the streets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE ANTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Daniel Newburn prayed to God Thursday night that it wouldn't rain,
but it did. He and his girlfriend and her four young children, all
homeless, found refuge under a tarp in the backyard of the Catholic
Worker house in Santa Ana.</LD>
<LD>   Friday--Good Friday--was another day, and maybe it would bring
promise and opportunity. It began with an offer from Dwight Smith,
who runs the Catholic Worker house, where 100 homeless people spent
the last two nights. "For carrying the cross, he gave me $10,"
Newburn said. "That's a blessing in itself."</LD>
<LD>   Newburn was among about 100 people who followed the heavy,
weathered wooden cross through downtown Santa Ana on Friday to call
attention to Orange County's estimated 20,000 homeless.</LD>
<TE>   The protesters reenacted Christ's suffering on his way to
crucifixion--stopping 14 times to pray and sing, mostly in front of
government agencies they say have failed the county's homeless,
leaving them with one-tenth the number of shelter beds needed and
inadequate medical and mental health care.</TE>
<TE>   "It brings to mind all of the hurtful things that are being done
to the poor," said Robert Brophy, 73, a retired university professor
who joined the march. "The least powerful suffer in the world because
they are the least powerful and don't have a say."</TE>
<TE>   Newburn, 36, and Christian Walker, 26, came not for the $10, but
in gratitude to Smith and his wife Leia, who took them in three days
ago when they had no other place to go.</TE>
<TE>   There's a story behind how Newburn, Walker and her kids ended up
on the street. It is unique to them, but it contains elements that
are shared with others--stories with long-forgotten beginnings,
complicated middles and no sure end in sight.</TE>
<TE>   "We came here from Arkansas three months ago. I was having family
problems," said Walker, who declined to elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   They came to California with $300. They stayed with relatives for
a month. They moved into a series of transient hotels. The money's
gone now, and Newburn said he can't find a job. For now, the six of
them live on the $900 a month Walker gets in welfare.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, God will bless us with a house or something," Newburn
said.</TE>
<TE>   Behind them walked Deena Snow. She carried a blanket, a backpack
and a Bible. Her story is complicated too, full of details that, like
her age, she is hesitant to divulge. This much she would say: "My
house of 40 years was stolen from me." She worked at a Kmart during
the Christmas season, but that was a temporary job and she hasn't
been able to find another.</TE>
<TE>   "I stay in different places. Where I can. Sometimes underneath a
cement bench. Sometimes at the Armory [shelter]," she said. "I
haven't given up. In the meantime, I do a lot of praying."</TE>
<TE>   So does David Michels. He used to work at the National Guard
Armory, earning $8 an hour helping the homeless. Now, he's struggling
on the other side. His wife, Candy, is in a nursing home, being
treated for a number of ailments, including a chronic intestinal
disorder.</TE>
<TE>   Their 3-year-old daughter Sarah was riding Michels' shoulders.
She's autistic.</TE>
<TE>   "I got my hands full," Michels, 34, said. "Between taking care of
my wife and taking care of my baby, I couldn't work.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people on the streets have health problems and mental
illness," he added. "I didn't understand how much mental illness was
out there until I saw it for myself.</TE>
<TE>   "I just need a place to plant the family so I can get things
rolling again."</TE>
<TE>   Bill Mowery hasn't seen his family, four kids ages 19 to 16, in a
while. How long, he can't say. They're living with their half-sister
in upstate New York. It is there that Mowery said his wife, addicted
to crack cocaine and heroin, died a few years ago.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Mowery, who wore sturdy shoes and a torn wool jacket,
nursed a cold as he followed the cross through Santa Ana to the steps
of the city jail, where each person kissed the raw wood.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good cause that highlights a national tragedy," he said,
shaking his head. "You've got to believe that God is not pleased."</TE>

<HD>Dolphins' Deaths Linked to Algae</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH R. WEISS and TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Scientists have discovered toxic algae blooms off Catalina Island,
confirming suspicions that a neurotoxin that induces crazy behavior
in animals and inspired Alfred Hitchcock's movie "The Birds" is
linked to the recent deaths of dolphins and sea lions.</LD>
<LD>   A federal lab also detected high levels of telltale domoic acid in
urine samples in two of the 31 dead dolphins that have washed ashore
on Southern California beaches in the last two months. Biologists are
waiting for an analysis of brain tissue to be certain of the link.</LD>
<LD>   "We have a little bit of a smoking gun," said John Heyning, a
marine biologist leading the investigation. "The tests prove they
were exposed to domoic acid. It doesn't prove they were killed by
it."</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a volunteer group attempted to rescue a confused
dolphin--thought to be suffering from the same poisoning--from a
canal of seawater used to cool an Oxnard power plant.</TE>
<TE>   The volunteers were hoping to snag the animal in a net, hoist it
onto a flatbed truck and whisk it to a marine mammal rehabilitation
and testing center in Laguna Beach. The group will try again today.</TE>
<TE>   Sam Dover, a veterinarian on the scene, said that although he will
not know until the animal is tested, he suspects the dolphin has lost
control of its neurological functions, including its usually keen
sense of navigation.</TE>
<TE>   Water samples collected in at least two places off Catalina have
identified invisible blooms of a single-cell plankton, in the genus
Pseudonitzschia, which produces the potent toxin that attacks the
brain and nervous system.</TE>
<TE>   Such blooms have been well documented in cooler waters off the
coast of Canada and Washington and in Monterey Bay. Scientists don't
know what causes them.</TE>
<TE>   A recent bloom in Monterey Bay prompted the California Department
of Health Services to issue an advisory against eating mussels, clams
and scallops, as well as anchovies, sardines and crabs caught there.</TE>
<TE>   Domoic acid is concentrated in these filter-feeding animals.
Although three human deaths have been recorded in Canada, domoic acid
poisoning is almost exclusively a problem for dolphins, sea lions and
seabirds that feed on sardines and anchovies that consume the algae.</TE>
<TE>   Public health officials, animal rescue workers and wildlife
biologists have been scrambling since the body count began rising
over the last five weeks from dolphins and sea lions washed ashore on
beaches in Ventura, Los Angeles and Orange counties.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County health officials have stepped up testing of
near-shore waters to make sure the algae blooms pose no public health
hazard. So far, the tests have been negative.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony F. Michaels, director of USC's Wrigley Institute for
Environmental Studies, found a bloom on his way to Catalina. He
stopped to take water samples when he saw a seal lion behaving
"extremely erratically." Initial lab results confirmed the presence
of Pseudonitzschia.</TE>
<TE>   The Catalina Island Marine Institute has also turned up positive
tests, said Gregg Langlois, a marine biologist with the state
Department of Health Services.</TE>
<TE>   "There could be a bunch of localized blooms," said Heyning, the
investigator who works at the National History Museum of Los Angeles.
"We really don't know for sure."</TE>
<TE>   Heyning said that as far as he can tell, all of the affected
dolphins have been male. It is just one of many mysteries surrounding
the recent rash of deaths.</TE>
<TE>   Dolphins cannot live long once they beach themselves, and
virtually all of them were found after they had died.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the sea lions, which commonly haul themselves out of the
water to rest, have survived. Four sea lions with suspected domoic
acid poisoning are being nursed back to health at the Fort MacArthur
Marine Mammal Care Center in San Pedro.</TE>
<TE>   "Some exhibit seizures and they look very disoriented," said
Jackie Jaakola, the center's director. "Their eyes are pointed in
different directions."</TE>
<TE>   As upsetting as the deaths of these seemingly smiling or
puppy-eyed creatures can be, wildlife biologists stress that the
naturally occurring poisoning holds no serious threat to the
otherwise healthy species.</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 200,000 California sea lions feed and frolic in state
waters. Federal officials estimate that 330,000 common dolphins
thrive off the West Coast.</TE>
<TE>   The common dolphins, with their distinct two-toned gray and white
markings, generally remain far offshore.</TE>
<TE>   They are most often spotted while escorting boats on the passage
to Catalina or other Channel Islands.</TE>
<TE>   "There are plenty of animals out there and we don't want the
public in shock that all of the dolphins are dying off," said Joe
Cordaro, a wildlife biologist with the National Marine Fisheries
Service.</TE>
<TE>   "The populations of dolphins and sea lions are doing very well."</TE>
<TE>   Wildlife officials have yet to receive reports of dead or erratic
behavior of seabirds, as happened during one of the largest outbreaks
of domoic acid poisoning in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   At that time, wildlife officials saw large-scale deaths of
pelicans and cormorants in the Monterey Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Domoic acid poisoning is thought to be the inspiration for
Hitchcock's horror movie "The Birds."</TE>
<TE>   In the real life event that captured the late director's
imagination, hundreds of gulls and shearwaters went berserk one
summer morning in 1961, attacking the seaside town of Capitola, near
Santa Cruz.</TE>
<TE>   Disoriented and crazed, they dove into street lamps, crashed
through windows and nipped a few people.</TE>
<TE>   The incident fascinated Hitchcock, who was vacationing nearby. He
included newspaper clippings about the Capitola attack in his studio
proposal for the movie that appeared two years later.</TE>

from an Oxnard canal, volunteers will try again today. They suspect
it has been affected by domoic acid and want to take it to a Laguna
Beach marine center.</CP>

<HD>An Indian Casino in El Toro's Future?</HD>
<DH>Land use: Local tribe seeking federal status may seek to

<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Juaneno Band of Mission Indians is joining the ranks of those
eyeing a piece of the closed El Toro Marine base.</LD>
<LD>   The tribe, which has topped a list of finalists for federal
recognition status since 1995, includes the 4,700-acre base as part
of its historic territory, stretching from Bolsa Chica to Camp
Pendleton. If it gains recognition by the Bureau of Indian Affairs,
which tribal leaders hope will come next year, the tribe could make a
claim for federal property within its aboriginal lands, including El
Toro.</LD>
<LD>   And that's where things could get interesting. If the planets so
align, Orange County could find itself home to a casino.</LD>
<TE>   Gambling halls are operated by 46 of about 110 tribes in
California, with more planned after state voters' approval of
Nevada-style Indian gaming in 1998 and 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Federal recognition must come before any attempt to claim land for
the tribe, Juaneno Chairman Damien Shilo said. But a casino is a
possibility, he said, because the federal government encourages
economic development for tribes, including gaming. Other options
include outlet stores or a power plant, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "There are so many variables for what could happen," Shilo said.
"I think it would be a very positive thing for the community. [El
Toro] is an ideal location. We've got the best lot on the block."</TE>
<TE>   The fate of El Toro was thrown open this month when voters
replaced Orange County's plans to build an international airport
there with zoning for a park and limited development.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy then announced that it would decide by April 23 whether
to sell the property to developers, who would build under the new
zoning.</TE>
<TE>   If the Indians were given land, however, it would be their
sovereign territory and not subject to local zoning controls. A
casino would be subject to the state regulations approved in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Shilo said the casino idea would be dropped if enough residents in
nearby cities opposed it. Tribal leaders still smart from the
drubbing the tribe got in 1997 when word leaked that some members had
signed an agreement with Las Vegas investors to buy 20 acres in San
Juan Capistrano for a casino. City leaders quickly denounced the
idea, saying a casino would ruin the city's small-town flavor.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts to recognize the Gabrielino-Tongva Nation in Ventura
County were opposed last year by Ventura County Dist. Atty. Michael
Bradbury, who warned that the gaming industry considers Los Angeles,
Orange and Ventura counties "large, untapped markets."</TE>
<TE>   But a well-run gambling hall would be an attractive and lucrative
addition, Shilo said. Its revenue could help fund improvements at the
base, such as golf courses and hotels, he said. The Pechanga Band of
Mission Indians in San Diego County and the Agua Caliente Band of
Cahuilla Indians in Riverside County use some of their millions in
casino revenue to donate police and firefighting equipment to area
agencies, for example.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the equivalent of six Costcos in your city," said Shilo of
casino revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Board of Supervisors Chairwoman Cynthia P. Coad said federal
recognition of the tribe is the first step, and that anything else
that happens would fall within the authority of the federal
government. If the tribe were to gain land at El Toro, it should be
free to build a casino, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very proud of the heritage and history that this group of
Indians has in Orange County and Southern California," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, supervisors urged federal recognition for the
Juanenos, who first applied for official status in 1982. The tribe,
also known as the Acjachemen, uses the name Juanenos because of
Mission San Juan Capistrano, which they helped build. The tribe would
be the first in Orange County to gain federal recognition; it
received state recognition in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Federal recognition is far from guaranteed. Since the Federal
Acknowledgment Program was established in 1978 to handle modern
claims, the Bureau of Indian Affairs has recognized only nine tribes
out of 147 petitions. Four more tribes have been granted sovereign
status by Congress. The federal government recognizes 561 tribes
nationally, according to the bureau.</TE>
<TE>   A bureau spokesman said the agency won't comment on the pending
recognition application.</TE>
<TE>   Indian tribes in California have gained political clout in recent
years, fueled by a wealth of campaign contributions that casinos have
made with their proceeds. California tribes spent $68 million in 1998
on the ballot measure legalizing casinos on reservations, which
passed overwhelmingly but was overturned by a federal judge. Tribes
spent $24 million more on a replacement measure two years later,
which got 65% of the vote. That measure ratified a deal between Gov.
Gray Davis and tribes that gave them monopoly rights to operate
Nevada-style casinos in California.</TE>
<TE>   From 1995 to 1998, California tribes accounted for $8.5 million in
contributions to state legislators, including those from Orange
County. From January 1999 to June 2001, seven tribes with major
casino operations spent $32 million on California campaigns,
according to a review of campaign reports filed with the state.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates for a park, museums, university, housing and sports
fields at El Toro dismissed the casino idea as too remote to worry
about. But those who still hope to see an airport built at El Toro
said the prospect of the Indians getting a slice of the base is
intriguing because the land wouldn't be subject to local control.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the Juaneno tribe could operate a wonderful airport
there, and they could have duty-free shops," said pro-airport
consultant David Ellis.</TE>

<HD>Two Truck Spills Snarl I-5 Traffic</HD>
<DH>Freeways: A big rig severs its fuel tank and spews oil; and
a mixer flips and loses concrete.</DH>

<LD>Two accidents involving large trucks snarled traffic along Interstate
5 in south Orange County for several hours Friday morning and sent
one driver to the hospital. The first accident was just after 7:30
a.m., when a big rig hauling a mobile home ran over a piece of metal,
which severed the truck's fuel tank, said Officer Denise Quesada of
the California Highway Patrol. Diesel fuel covered the freeway near
the San Joaquin Hills toll road, and an estimated 100 gallons spilled
into a storm drain.</LD>
<LD>   No injuries were reported, but a crew from the state Department of
Fish and Game was called in to determine any environmental risk.</LD>
<LD>   All northbound lanes of the freeway were closed for about 20
minutes. By 9:30 a.m., all but two lanes were reopened, but traffic
was backed up to the San Diego County line. Crews worked into the
afternoon cleaning up the spill, Quesada said.</LD>
<TE>   In the second incident, shortly before 9 a.m., a mixer truck
filled with concrete apparently blew a tire and overturned on the
southbound side of the freeway near La Paz Road, Quesada said. The
concrete spilled over two lanes of the freeway and covered about 200
feet. The carpool and No. 1 lanes of the freeway remained open during
cleanup, but traffic at one point was backed up to Sand Canyon Road,
Quesada said.</TE>
<TE>   The driver, whose name was not released, was taken to South Coast
Medical Center in Laguna Beach. Quesada said she did not know how
badly the driver was hurt.</TE>

<HD>Criminal Probe in Death of Girl, 1</HD>
<DH>Investigation: Police and child-welfare officials had
visited the Anaheim home at least three times in recent months on
reports that the child was bruised and scratched.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Anaheim home where a 1-year-old girl was found dead this week
under suspicious circumstances had been visited earlier by police,
social workers and counselors from a private child-welfare group who
had all been alerted to possible problems in the home, according to
housemates and officials at the welfare organization.</LD>
<LD>   Police are investigating the death Tuesday of Samantha Rose
Gutierrez to determine whether foul play was involved. Detectives
have questioned the girl's parents but said there are no suspects,
noting that the coroner's office is still trying to determine the
cause of death. Police have taken Samantha's two brothers, ages 2 and
5, and her 1-month-old sister into protective custody while the
investigation continues.</LD>
<LD>   The home was visited at least three times in recent months by
various officials who were told that Samantha had scratches and
bruises on her body, said Lorri Galloway, executive director of Eli
Home, a nonprofit group that takes in child-abuse victims and
conducts parenting classes in Anaheim.</LD>
<TE>   Galloway said her group became aware of possible problems in
January when a housemate of Samantha's family who was attending a
parenting class told Eli Home representatives that she was concerned
about the child's welfare.</TE>
<TE>   Eli Home called the Social Services Agency, which asked police to
investigate, Galloway said.</TE>
<TE>   Police officials confirm that they visited the house Jan. 17, but
said the officers found no evidence of abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Still concerned about Samantha's well-being, Eli Home counselors
went to the house a few days later to talk to the parents, Galloway
said. The counselors observed a bruise and a scratch under Samantha's
eye and bruises on her left arm, she said. Galloway said she also
made a second call to Social Services, where officials told her they
were investigating the case.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Riley, head of the agency's Children and Family Services
Department, declined to comment on the case because it is under
investigation, but he acknowledged that his department is "very
familiar with the case."</TE>
<TE>   Galloway believes the system might have failed Samantha.</TE>
<TE>   She said her unease comes after talking to Dulce Soriano, 27, the
housemate who alerted Eli Home.</TE>
<TE>   Soriano and her husband, Luis, 31, said in an interview Friday
that social workers had been to the house at least twice in recent
months, once in November and another time shortly after Samantha
showed up with a cast on her right arm a week before Christmas, they
said. Dulce Soriano said she was concerned about Samantha and
approached Eli Home representatives hoping that they could help the
child.</TE>
<TE>   "She was constantly crying," she said of the little girl. The two
families occupy two separate bedrooms and share a kitchenette and
living room.</TE>
<TE>   Luis and Dulce Soriano said they were awakened Tuesday about 6:20
a.m. by loud bangs on their bedroom door. Luis answered the door and
found Samantha's mother frantically saying her child was dead.</TE>
<TE>   Dulce Soriano ran to the second bedroom and saw Samantha lying on
the bed, she said. Luis Soriano told Dulce to call 911.</TE>
<TE>   The paramedics arrived shortly thereafter but the child was dead.</TE>
<TE>   Luis Soriano said he went to get Samantha's father, a construction
worker, at his workplace and gave him the news.</TE>
<TE>   "He was very shocked," Luis Soriano said. "He said, 'Don't kid me,
I don't believe you.' I told him, 'No, your daughter is dead.' He
cried all the way home."</TE>
<TE>   Police officials interviewed the Sorianos on Friday, but declined
to provide further information about the case. Samantha's parents are
staying with relatives while the investigation continues, Dulce
Soriano said. They could not be reached for comment.</TE>

<HD>Tribute to a Golden Tradition</HD>
<DH>Family: A Buena Park couple celebrating their 50th wedding
anniversary are the fourth generation to reach the half-century mark.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY WRIDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Barney and Breezy Brown celebrated 216 years of marriage Friday,
displaying their black-and-white 1952 wedding pictures alongside the
half-century anniversary photos of three past generations.</LD>
<LD>   While the good-humored Buena Park couple did not want a big
fuss--"When I heard my wedding dress was going to be on display I
said, 'Oh come on!'" Breezy said--there is no such thing as a small
party with this family.</LD>
<LD>   They are 62 in all, with seven children and their mates, 23
grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren. Five more
great-grandchildren are due this year.</LD>
<TE>   It's impressive enough that the couple, formally known as Byron
and Helen, survived 50 years of marriage--and their nicknames. But
the Brown brood paid tribute Friday to four generations of Browns who
have shown they can commit.</TE>
<TE>   Barney Brown's parents, grandparents and great-grandparents each
were married for more than 50 years to the same spouse.</TE>
<TE>   With all those years of experience, no Brown wisdom has been
passed down for succeeding at wedded bliss. But they knew how to
celebrate it. Barney Brown still remembers attending his
grandparents' 50th anniversary party when he was 13, and later, that
of his own parents. Both were at the same Falcon Avenue house in Long
Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "It comes on slow, one year at a time, and then huh! There it is,
50 years," Barney said, clearly enjoying the company of his offspring
all stuffed into the family homestead off La Palma Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   And how, apart from room additions, did they raise seven children?</TE>
<TE>   "People ask me that," Breezy said with a smile, shaking her head,
"and I don't know either, but you get up every morning and live the
day."</TE>
<TE>   Their son had one explanation, referring to dehydrated food, for
how his parents made ends meet: "I didn't know milk was liquid until
I was 4."</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, Paul wasn't the brightest child," Breezy joked of her son,
who graduated from college with a degree in biochemistry.</TE>
<TE>   The roots of the marriage were unique. Breezy, 68, and Barney, 72,
were born and raised in north Long Beach and attended Jordan High
School there.</TE>
<TE>   But they met at a dance at the local Mormon church, where Barney
was a member, when Breezy was just shy of 16. Soon after, they became
a couple, and Breezy later was baptized into the church.</TE>
<TE>   Barney joined the Army right after graduating and spent a year in
Korea. While he was gone, he thought he and Breezy should get
engaged.</TE>
<TE>   "All the other girls in school were getting them, so I figured I'd
get her a ring before I got home," he explained.</TE>
<TE>   So he sent a brochure home to his parents and his father bought a
ring. Barney's parents invited Breezy and her parents to dinner, and
Barney's father made the wedding proposal.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone was there but you," joked Breezy.</TE>
<TE>   "Wait, she hadn't seen you in a year and married you 10 days after
you got back from Korea?" asked third child Diane Jones, 45, of
Seattle. "Wow, Mom. That's brave."</TE>
<TE>   The Browns married when Breezy was 18, and had their first child a
year later. They moved 47 years ago to their present home, which was
then brand-new. Fields of corn grew around them, and nearby Knott's
Berry Farm was still a working farm. Barney ran a printing business
out of the garage.</TE>
<TE>   The Brown children aspire to the half-century marriage.</TE>
<TE>   "Me and my husband have only been married six years, and it's sure
given us a goal," said Elizabeth Anderson, the youngest Brown child.
"My oldest sister, Diane, has been married 25 years, so she's halfway
there."</TE>

<HD>Rampart Report Is a Year Overdue</HD>
<DH>LAPD: Chief, seeking a new term, is behind on a promised
second document. An official blames the complexity of the
investigation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GLOVER and MATT LAIT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shortly after the Rampart corruption scandal came to light in 1999,
Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard C. Parks promised to get to the
bottom of the department's troubles and publicly explain what went
wrong in two comprehensive reports.</LD>
<LD>   The chief issued the first report two years ago, documenting the
administrative and managerial failures of the LAPD that police
officials believe contributed to the misconduct in Rampart. But the
second report, which is supposed to reveal "the exact nature and
disposition of each allegation," has yet to be written.</LD>
<LD>   Parks initially said the second report would be completed by early
last year. Department officials now say that document is still weeks,
if not longer, away from completion. It has been delayed, they said,
because the corruption investigation has dragged on longer than
expected, involving hundreds of allegations and making it more
difficult to chronicle them all.</LD>
<TE>   One effect of that delay is that the report, now more than a year
overdue, probably will not be made public until after the city Police
Commission decides whether to give Parks a second term as chief.</TE>
<TE>   He is scheduled to appear before the commission Monday to discuss
his reappointment. The author of the second report stressed, however,
that the delays in producing it are not related to Parks' bid for
another term, but rather are the result of difficulties in gathering
large volumes of material and working with other agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Police commissioners have said that they will evaluate Parks, in
part, on his handling of the Rampart scandal. The documents related
to the department's response to the scandal are available to the
commission even though the final report is not complete.</TE>
<TE>   Although Parks won initial praise for trying to uncover the
scandal, many critics have complained that the chief failed to make
good on his pledge to investigate corruption wherever it led in the
department.</TE>
<TE>   "If Parks had intentionally planned to cover up Rampart, I don't
think he could have done a better job," said USC professor Erwin
Chemerinsky, who has studied the LAPD and who, working for the city's
police union, produced his own report on the corruption.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD's investigation, according to Chemerinsky and other
department observers, minimized the scope of police wrongdoing. Once
completed, the second report could help prove whether that criticism
is valid.</TE>
<TE>   "A report like this is long overdue. It's essential," said Gary
Wigodsky, an alternate public defender. "The LAPD is sitting on a
mountain of evidence that corroborates these [corruption]
allegations."</TE>
<TE>   Known in the LAPD vernacular as an "after-action report," the
second document is supposed to account for every allegation of
criminal or administrative misconduct that arose from the Rampart
probe.</TE>
<TE>   That would mean that police officials would have disclosed for the
first time what detectives found in the course of their 2 1/2-year
investigation. Much of the investigation was spurred by the
admissions and allegations of former LAPD Officer Rafael Perez, who
agreed to cooperate with authorities in exchange for a lighter
sentence for stealing cocaine.</TE>
<TE>   In dozens of interviews, Perez described what he said was an
out-of-control group of anti-gang officers who routinely planted
evidence, lied in police reports, committed perjury, beat gang
members and covered up unjustified shootings.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond Perez's accusations, LAPD investigators uncovered other
allegations of police misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   Cmdr. Daniel Koenig, who is responsible for drafting the
after-action report, said the document will be comprehensive.</TE>
<TE>   "The chief committed to [issuing the report], and that commitment
will be met," he said. "People have a right to know what the hell
happened."</TE>
<TE>   Koenig said he has been receiving information for the report from
various department officials, adding that he hopes that the document
can be released as soon as mid-April. However, he cautioned that it
could take longer to write and edit the report.</TE>
<TE>   After-action reports are undertaken by the LAPD after serious
episodes. In recent years, for instance, such reports have been
produced after the 2000 Democratic National Convention and after the
bloody 1997 North Hollywood shootout.</TE>
<TE>   One widely publicized after-action report came after an
investigation into the taped allegations of former Det. Mark Fuhrman,
who told an aspiring screenwriter tales of police brutality and
discrimination.</TE>
<TE>   That report, also written by Koenig, concluded that Fuhrman
exaggerated or lied about his claims of brutality, but was telling
the truth when he spoke of institutional harassment of women.</TE>
<TE>   A number of new policies and practices were recommended after the
Fuhrman report.</TE>
<TE>   First Report Led to Call for Change</TE>
<TE>   Policy revisions also were recommended after the LAPD's first
report on the Rampart scandal. The so-called Board of Inquiry report
addressed mostly the administrative and managerial failures of the
department.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, the Board of Inquiry concluded that corrupt officers
took advantage of lax department supervision to carry out criminal
acts.</TE>
<TE>   The breakdowns included failures to check the backgrounds of
police recruits, to monitor police officer misconduct and to
supervise officers in the field.</TE>
<TE>   One section of the Rampart after-action report, Koenig said, will
assess whether the reforms recommended in the Board of Inquiry report
have been implemented and, if so, how they are working.</TE>

<HD>3 Soldiers Killed, 1 Hurt in Accident at Ft. Irwin</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A mortar round exploded prematurely during a training exercise Friday
at Ft. Irwin, killing three soldiers and wounding a fourth in the
latest live-fire accident to hit the U.S. military.</LD>
<LD>   The soldiers from Fort Riley, Kan., were killed by the
120-millimeter round shortly before 2:30 a.m., said Maj. Rob Ali, a
spokesman for the base, set 120 miles east of Los Angeles near
Barstow. The wounded soldier was not seriously hurt.</LD>
<LD>   The names of the dead were withheld pending notification of
relatives.</LD>
<TE>   There have been 32 accidental on-duty Army fatalities since Oct.
1, according to military statistics. There were 28 during the same
period last year.</TE>
<TE>   "We go out of our way to ensure the safety of these people during
training, but human error being what it is, we're bound to have
accidents no matter how many safeguards we put in place," said Rep.
Jim Gibbons (R-Nev.), a member of the House Armed Services and
Intelligence committees.</TE>
<TE>   Fatal accidents in other branches of the military are also up
slightly. There have been nine accidental on-duty Air Force
fatalities so far this fiscal year, compared with five during the
same period last year.</TE>
<TE>   There have been 24 Marine and 14 Navy on-duty accidental
fatalities so far this year, compared with 37 for the Marines and 20
for the Navy in all of fiscal 2001. A breakdown of the 2001 data
wasn't available.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, a Navy helicopter crashed on a Sierra Nevada ridge in
Central California, killing two crew members. Last week, two soldiers
at Ft. Drum in New York were killed and 13 were injured when errant
artillery shells hit near their mess tent.</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 23, a soldier from Ft. Bragg, N.C., was shot and killed
and a second was wounded when they tried to disarm a sheriff's deputy
they thought was participating in their training exercise.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the central reality here is pretty clear: War and
simulated war are by definition unpredictable activities." said Loren
Thompson, a defense analyst at the Lexington Institute. "They're
risky not just because someone is shooting at you, but because
anything could happen next."</TE>

<HD>L.A. Prosecutors Focus Attention on 'Little Crimes'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARRETT THEROLF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo has sent out a team of prosecutors across
Los Angeles to battle small problems before they become larger.</LD>
<LD>   Delgadillo said the Neighborhood Prosecutor Program is designed to
partner the prosecutors who litigate quality of life issues, such as
graffiti and dog barking, with the citizens who are troubled by those
issues. The 18 attorneys are working out of new offices in police
stations.</LD>
<LD>   On March 1, a prosecutor was assigned to each Los Angeles Police
Department division and now are hearing about "everything from gang
activity to problems with the noise of leaf blowers," said Mary
McGuire, a spokeswoman for the city attorney's office.</LD>
<TE>   They are "the little crimes that erode our neighborhoods and pave
the way for more serious crimes," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In the City Council motion to approve the program in January,
sponsors complained that "the traditional prosecutorial system is, by
design, both insulated from the community and largely reactive."</TE>
<TE>   Deputy City Atty. Anthony Paul Diaz is the neighborhood prosecutor
working out of the LAPD's Devonshire station. He said many quality of
life issues can be resolved quickly when the appropriate authorities
are involved.</TE>
<TE>   They are "not solved just in the courtroom, but really in the
community," Diaz said.</TE>

<HD>Last Call! Historic Bar Closing</HD>
<DH>Landmarks: J. Sloans, in West Hollywood, was a speak-easy
and drew stars. Regulars resent plans for a dress shop.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It survived bootleggers, Prohibition, carousing movie stars and
yuppie-bred fern bars.</LD>
<LD>   But what is claimed to be Los Angeles' oldest continuously
operating neighborhood tavern will close Sunday. So it can be
converted into a women's dress shop.</LD>
<LD>   The planned make-over of the 83-year-old J. Sloans pub in West
Hollywood has caused an uproar among customers who say there can be
no replacement for its wood-beamed simplicity and its beer-fueled
congeniality.</LD>
<TE>   The dress shop is reportedly planned by actress Elaine Joyce, who
owns the 1,500-square-foot building used by the bar at 8623 Melrose
Ave. Joyce is the wife of playwright Neil Simon.</TE>
<TE>   Generations of customers are expected on the last day.
Anticipating a full house, bar owners Manny Galindo and Eddie Harrah
have canceled the band that would have played to make room for as
many patrons as possible.</TE>
<TE>   Frequently seen in movie and television scenes, J. Sloans has been
a favorite for generations of Hollywood stars too. Customers such as
Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy frequented the place in the 1940s and
'50s. More recently, actors Dennis Quaid, George Clooney and Matt
Dillon relaxed there.</TE>
<TE>   Film industry types routinely rented out the place for
Oscar-watching soirees and wrap parties. Five years ago, the bar made
international headlines when Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein
announced he was buying the bar and giving it to a screenwriter as
partial payment for a script--a deal that wasn't consummated.</TE>
<TE>   Mostly, J. Sloans was a neighborhood hangout.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to be. We don't have any parking here," explained
bartender Jo Lynn Van Holten as she wiped down the battered bar
Friday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   J. Sloans was exempt from the normal requirement of 25 parking
spaces for a bar where dancing is permitted. But then, J. Sloans was
exempt from plenty of restrictions placed on other bars.</TE>
<TE>   "Because it opened in 1919 and predated the Alcoholic Beverage
[Control Board], it was grandfathered in," Galindo explained Friday
as he sat at a table in the bar and accepted condolences from a
steady stream of customers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the only license of its kind in Los Angeles. I can sell beer
to go. I can have naked bartenders. I don't, of course. But I can do
things that other bars can't, if I want to."</TE>
<TE>   J. Sloans had an outlaw image when it opened. Prohibition was
looming, so its first owner picked a spot well outside what were then
Los Angeles city limits, figuring authorities wouldn't bother
enforcing the national ban on alcoholic beverages there.</TE>
<TE>   The Melrose Avenue location was also next to the Red Car trolley
system's western terminal, which meant there was a steady flow of
customers--even if the flow of beer and liquor was supposed to be cut
off.</TE>
<TE>   "This place was a speak-easy back then," Galindo said. "When
Prohibition was repealed, they kicked the doors open and kept going."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, no one could remember what the bar's original name was.
But by the 1950s the place was called Bailey's. Then a large
theme-bar company, Grand American Fair, owned it from about 1970 to
1995. It was renamed J. Sloans and decorated with such things as
antique harnesses and a sleigh hanging from the rafters. An aging,
steam-driven pipe organ taken from the Bijou Theater in Plattsburgh,
N.Y., was installed above its bar.</TE>
<TE>   There was a series of owners after that. In 1997, J. Sloans
bartender Troy Duffy almost joined them.</TE>
<TE>   Duffy was at work one night when Weinstein, co-chairman of Miramax
Films, joined him and his pals over a pitcher of beer. Duffy was
signed to a multimillion-dollar deal to write and direct his first
screenplay, "Boondocks Saints." And as part of the deal, Weinstein
offered to buy J. Sloans for Duffy. Both the movie and purchase
eventually fell through.</TE>
<TE>   Landlord Joyce, whose acting credits include "Beverly Hills 90210"
and "Fade In, Fade Out," could not be reached Friday for comment. The
Melrose Avenue property has been in her family since 1956; she and
Simon were married 2 1/2 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   West Hollywood city officials, meantime, said they were puzzled by
Joyce's plans. A dress shop would not be exempt from city parking
regulations; as many as six parking places would be required for such
a retail store.</TE>
<TE>   City Councilman Steve Martin, who has lived in the neighborhood
for 20 years, stopped by the bar Friday afternoon to sign a petition
calling for its continuation. "This is the kind of place that should
be preserved," he said. "This place is really the precursor of the
House of Blues and what is now the Sunset Strip."</TE>
<TE>   West Hollywood letter carrier Ruben Martinez, who for years has
eaten lunch each day at J. Sloans, stopped in for a final tuna
sandwich and a glass of cranberry juice. "I'm going to miss this
place. It really is like the bar in 'Cheers,'" said Martinez, of
Highland Park.</TE>
<TE>   At a nearby table, Scott Van Sanford, a computer technician who
lives in the neighborhood, was washing down a hamburger with a mug of
Budweiser. It would be tragic for Los Angeles to lose a landmark like
J. Sloans, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Not to be blasphemous, but I'm still hoping that on Easter we'll
find out that Sloans has risen from the dead," he said.</TE>

<HD>Check This Out: Deputies Delighted With Drive-Up Arrests at
Inspection Area</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the amusing aspects of the courthouse detail for officers,
writes L.A. County Sheriff's Deputy Mike Ascolese, is the number of
"arrests you can generate just by standing at the inspection area"
for vehicles with citations.</LD>
<LD>   "One lady pulled up to have her son's car checked, only to be
dismayed when the car was impounded," Ascolese related in Star News,
a department publication. Reason: The car was stolen.</LD>
<LD>   Shhhh! Long Beach resident John Creamer noticed a hospital's
building directory that might confirm the suspicions of employees
everywhere about their bosses (see photo).</LD>
<TE>   They'll clean your clock: A marquee that seemed to advertise a
unique hands-on (and feet-on) approach to laundry caught the eye of
Kent Moore of Corona del Mar. Observed Moore: "I suppose this means
that they give you the 'rough and tumble' with the 'spin' service"
(see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Something else to kick about: Dennis Williams and Nicholas Hobart
noted that in my fascinating discussion of Reseda's cinematic
contributions, I forgot to point out that the main character in "The
Karate Kid" moves to that town from New Jersey. Hobart, by the way,
wins the award for today's most far-flung correspondent, having
e-mailed from Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   No hairy situation? Joyce Hiller of Redondo Beach came across an
ad for a sales job with an abbreviation that could be mistaken for a
health guarantee--a creepy health guarantee (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Food for thought: At a skating event in Japan, George Rossano
spotted an apparent reminder to spectators to be sure to fill up on
food beforehand (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Sign of spring: Pasadena police set up a neighborhood traffic
check, complete with electronic readout of the speed of passing
vehicles. Soon afterward, a dad and his son were observed in the
street, wearing baseball gloves. They proceeded to clock the speed of
the boy's pitches.</TE>
<TE>   Double-talk of the day: Walter Gillespie of L.A. forwarded a
Medicare form that stated: "This release will be good for a maximum
of five years unless you specify a shorter or longer length of time
below. Length of time is not to exceed five years." Someone karate
kick the writer awake.</TE>
<TE>   Marquee madness (cont.): Joe Pranzo of Lake Arrowhead recalled a
theater sign that combined the titles of two 1949 movies with risque
effect: BIG CAT/HOUSE ACROSS THE STREET.</TE>
<TE>   Timothy Leary would have been proud: David Whiteacre remembered an
extraordinary closure notice in Chicago before that city's 2000
marathon. The second line was supposed to say: "Use Lake Shore
Drive," but the sign maker was either lazy or couldn't fit it all in.
So, the sign said: ROAD CLOSED USE LSD.</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: This column is also temporarily closing while I take a
one-week vacation.</TE>

weekly potluck dinner, a few of his neighbors mull over the latest
dust-up over their communal garden. It's supposed to be free of
polluting pesticides, but the group is fretting about one headstrong
gardener.</LD>
<TE>   "She uses slug bait," Joe Linton, a bespectacled artist, says
incredulously. "I know, I know. It's bad. I think she would do so
much better if she had a smaller plot."</TE>
<TE>   Such is life in the Los Angeles Eco-Village, an outpost of organic
lettuce and solar panels plunked down in the middle of the urban
core.</TE>
<TE>   The community is tiny, just two blocks lined with 1920s-era
apartment buildings east of Vermont Avenue on the northern fringe of
Koreatown. Most of the 500 people who live on Bimini and White House
places have no particular environmental agenda.</TE>
<TE>   But sprinkled among them are about 30 self-proclaimed
Eco-Villagers, sending a green current rippling through this largely
working-class, immigrant neighborhood. Thanks to them, the streets
are lined with apple, plum and grapefruit trees. Vegetables sprout
from courtyards. Bicycles have replaced some of the cars.</TE>
<TE>   It's an evolving utopia, where neighbors still squabble and raw
radishes aren't always appetizing enough to eat.</TE>
<TE>   "Eco-Village," said Lois Arkin, a 65-year-old woman who helped
found the community a decade ago, "is a state of mind."</TE>
<TE>   The mind-set is sharply at odds with much of the rest of this
teeming neighborhood of auto shops, drive-through restaurants and
graffiti that stain even tree trunks.</TE>
<TE>   Devivo and his girlfriend, Antje Spors, moved in a year and a half
ago. They are authors of a book about "instinctive nutrition," which
urges people to choose raw foods based on what their senses tell them
their bodies need.</TE>
<TE>   "We used to live in an anonymous apartment building in Hollywood,"
said Spors. "If somebody would say hi to you in the elevator, you
were really lucky."</TE>
<TE>   In Eco-Village, everyone says hi. Roam the halls of the group's
main abode, a two-story apartment building painted sunflower yellow,
and you will find sculptors and psychologists, bike messengers and
teachers. The head of the Los Angeles County Bicycle Coalition lives
here. So does the assistant manager of the Hollywood farmers market.
It's an ethnically diverse group that includes people from Nigeria,
Germany, China and El Salvador.</TE>
<TE>   Arkin, who has lived in the neighborhood for 22 years, was the
first Eco-Villager. In the late 1980s, she and a group of like-minded
friends wanted to start a community that reflected their beliefs.
They had their eyes on an 11-acre site in Montecito Heights, a former
landfill where they could build their village from scratch.</TE>
<TE>   But then Vermont Avenue erupted. Two buildings near 1st Street
burned to the ground as mobs surged through the neighborhood during
the 1992 riots. Arkin decided she had to stay.</TE>
<TE>   "We were asking the question: What should our priorities be in
urban L.A.?" she recalled. "Should we be building sexy new
developments on precious open space, or should we be reinventing our
existing neighborhoods to be healthier and more sustainable? It was
unanimous to say, 'Hey, let's heal the neighborhood.'"</TE>
<TE>   Naomi Orr, an elderly African American, was already living on
Bimini when Arkin and others in the largely white eco-crowd started
passing out environmental newsletters, planting trees and throwing
block parties. Little by little, she said, neighbors who had never
exchanged a hello began greeting each other by name.</TE>
<TE>   It took years before other environmentalists began to move in to
join Arkin's urban experiment. Even now, some are more
self-sufficient than others. Not all Eco-Villagers have forsaken
their cars, and only a couple of them have made the switch to solar
power.</TE>
<TE>   But if anyone doubts the vision, consider this. An Eco-Village
nonprofit group now owns two Bimini Place apartment buildings, bought
without the help of a bank, using $1 million worth of handshake loans
from dozens of supporters.</TE>
<TE>   Now Orr lives alongside ponytailed guys who wheel mountain bikes
down the hall. She considers herself "a part-time Eco-Villager."</TE>
<TE>   "I love it here," she said. "A lot of people say, 'Why don't you
move into a senior building?' Well, I'm very content here, and I
actually feel very safe."</TE>
<TE>   Orr is gamely trying to fit in. But some habits, she admitted, die
hard.</TE>
<TE>   "They do ask you to save the vegetables for compost, but I'm not
good at that, because I sometimes forget," Orr said apologetically.
"See, I'm not a vegetarian. I'm almost 74 years old, and I'm just not
good at evolving."</TE>
<TE>   Many Eco-Village units rent for about $400 a month, a bargain in a
city painfully short of affordable housing. Similar apartments in the
area cost upward of $600 monthly.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most impressive apartments belongs to T.H. Culhane, a
tech-loving UCLA grad student determined to live in a self-contained
"biosphere." In practice, this means a tangle of wires and tubes
slithering across the floor, the walls, the tub and the toilet.</TE>
<TE>   Rooftop solar panels provide his electricity. Dirty water from the
shower is recycled to irrigate the garden. Culhane even built a
composting toilet--basically a seat rigged over a five-gallon bucket.
Instead of flushing away waste, he drops in a handful of grass and
leaves, periodically emptying the bucket into a compost bin wedged
next to the bathroom door.</TE>
<TE>   "It's in here? That's incredibly compact," marveled John Stern, an
aerospace engineer visiting Culhane's apartment. "This is excellent
odor control. It's really working."</TE>
<TE>   "This is a biosphere," Culhane reminded him. "I'm in my own bubble
here."</TE>
<TE>   As he explained the workings of a compost system that uses
earthworms, pill bugs and air siphoned in with aquarium pumps, Fabien
Bronner, Devivo's 10-year-old son, clomped around the apartment
wearing Culhane's anti-gravity boots. Then he strummed a few chords
on the solar-powered electric guitar.</TE>
<TE>   A fifth-grader with a bristling crew cut who speaks four
languages, Fabien said he loves living in Eco-Village. In other
neighborhoods, he said, "there's garbage all over the place and car
pollution."</TE>
<TE>   "Eco-Village is cleaner. There are more trees here. It's more
interesting, the way people live," he said. "It feels like a
homeland."</TE>

<HD>'Psychics' Bilked and Badgered Clients, Indictment Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two self-described psychics were accused in a federal indictment
Friday of conning or badgering clients into paying thousands of
dollars in fees to free the customers from bad karma.</LD>
<LD>   Sonia Merino, 50, of Manhattan Beach and her daughter-in-law,
Nasta Merino, 23, of Thousand Oaks, were arrested and charged with
five counts each of mail fraud.</LD>
<LD>   One client told investigators that he gave Sonia Merino more than
$518,000 in checks, a 1999 Volkswagen Beetle, a CD player and a
personal computer over a three-year period. The unnamed person said
he went to Sonia Psychic Advisor on South Sepulveda Boulevard in
Manhattan Beach for a tarot card reading in 1996 after a failed
romance, according to a government affidavit.</LD>
<TE>   The initial fee was minimal, but Sonia Merino told him he needed a
series of costlier sessions, the affidavit said.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, she asked the man for $750,000 to pay a group of
psychics to conduct all-night meditations on his behalf, according to
the affidavit.</TE>
<TE>   After paying most of what she demanded, the man happened to watch
a television expose on psychic frauds, the affidavit related.
Suspicions aroused, he began investigating on his own and discovered
that on a night when Sonia Merino was supposed to be meditating with
other psychics, she was at home, the affidavit said.</TE>
<TE>   The man then went to the Manhattan Beach Police Department, which
began an investigation with the criminal branch of the Internal
Revenue Service. In addition to mail fraud, Sonia Merino, along with
her husband, Steve, 44, was charged with tax fraud for allegedly
underreporting $750,000 in income from 1995 through 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Capozzola, attorney for Sonia and Steve Merino, reacted
angrily to their arrest, saying they had been cooperating with
investigators.</TE>
<TE>   He said many of Sonia Merino's clients testified before the
federal grand jury that they were helped by her psychic healing
powers. "It's a matter of belief," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The government affidavit said Sonia Merino also sold clients what
she described as "holy water" from the Vatican. Analysis showed it
was Manhattan Beach tap water, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Nasta Merino was accused of selling at least one person "holy
water" from Ste.-Anne-de-Beaupre, site of a Catholic shrine near the
city of Quebec, Canada, frequented by invalids seeking miracle cures.
It, too, came from a local tap, the affidavit said.</TE>
<TE>   The affidavit said Sonia and Nasta Merino advertised in a South
Bay newspaper mailer, offering psychic readings for as little as $10.</TE>
<TE>   The pair would tell clients that additional sessions, ranging up
to $20,000, were needed to drive away a curse or some negative
spiritual force, the document said.</TE>
<TE>   One victim was quoted in the affidavit as saying that Sonia Merino
threatened to put a curse on her when she refused to pay several
thousand dollars for a series of sessions.</TE>
<TE>   Another told of being badgered with phone calls every few hours
throughout the night.</TE>
<TE>   IRS investigators said they have interviewed more than 40 former
clients of the Merinos, most of whom thought they had been
victimized. Bond for Sonia and Steve Merino was set at $125,000 each.
Nasta Merino's bond was set at $50,000.</TE>

<HD>Accused Officer Is Called Devoted Father, Worker</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAREN BRISCOE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A San Bernardino police officer charged with sexually assaulting or
raping 11 women while on duty was described Friday as a devoted
father who worked a graveyard patrol shift to leave time to
participate in Little League games.</LD>
<LD>   "As far as we knew, he was a hard-working officer," said Richard
Lawhead, vice president of the San Bernardino Police Officers Assn.</LD>
<LD>   Ronald Allen VanRossum, 37, a 14-year veteran of the department,
is charged with more than two dozen felony counts: 11 of kidnapping
for the purpose of rape, eight of rape, two of sexual battery and,
under color of authority, five counts of oral copulation and one
charge of sodomy.</LD>
<TE>   The charges cover the period from April 28, 2000, to Nov. 1, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   VanRossum's arraignment, initially set for Friday, was continued
to April 19 by San Bernardino County Superior Court Judge W. Robert
Fawke.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica attorney Bill Hadden, who has defended police
officers for 20 years on criminal and other matters, said he expected
that his client would plead not guilty. Hadden spoke to VanRossum for
the first time Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "He's holding up better than I would," Hadden said.</TE>
<TE>   Lawhead said VanRossum and his wife, who works for the San
Bernardino city Water Department, have two children. The officer had
few close colleagues on the force, Lawhead said, because of his
overnight shift. He worked without a partner.</TE>
<TE>   According to Lawhead, VanRossum joined the department in the
civilian post of community service representative. Later, he worked
on bike patrol, where Lawhead worked with him. VanRossum had several
different assignments during his career, according to Lawhead. He
worked vice and other specialty assignments, Lawhead said, before
returning to patrol a couple of years ago, which Lawhead said is not
uncommon.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators were able to locate the alleged victims by retracing
every stop VanRossum made in the last two years as a patrol officer,
according to Lawhead. A history of every officer's stop is recorded
by a computer.</TE>
<TE>   "If he's guilty of all charges, he should be prosecuted to the
fullest extent," Lawhead said. "I think we all feel that way, if he's
tarnished our reputation. As police officers, we're held to an even
higher standard."</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Hadden said he has just been given several
thousand pages of information about the investigation and will start
to go through it all this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   The complaint alleges that VanRossum threatened women with arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Hadden said he understood "that at least some of [the women] have
had extensive law enforcement contact in the past." He said he has
been led to believe that some of them may have police records.</TE>
<TE>   All the women have asked to remain anonymous.</TE>
<TE>   VanRossum, who was arrested Thursday, is being held at the West
Valley Detention Center in lieu of $3-million bail. He has been on
leave since Nov. 7, five days after San Bernardino police arrested a
woman who told them she had been sexually assaulted by an officer.
That began the investigation that led to his arrest.</TE>

<LD>   The man, whose name was withheld pending family notification, was
struck at 5:20 p.m. as a Metrolink train passed him going the

<HD>Firefighters Pull 2 Kids From Apartment Blaze</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL CHAMBERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two small children left alone at home were saved from their burning
Palmdale apartment Friday afternoon by three firefighters who braved
the flames. Authorities said their mother, who had gone to work and
left the children, ages 1 and 5, to watch each other, was arrested
about two hours later on suspicion of child cruelty.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles County firefighters said the toddler started the blaze
by covering a lamp with a towel, which then ignited. A neighbor
reported the fire in the 38700 block of 20th Street East at 12:36
p.m.</LD>
<LD>   When the first engine arrived four minutes later, the second-floor
apartment was engulfed in flames and smoke, and "There were 10 to 20
residents yelling that two children were trapped in a back bedroom,"
said Capt. Dirk Wegner. He and firefighters Mike Grodde and Joseph
McMurray were the first to arrive.</LD>
<TE>   "The tenants were doing the best they could, but there was just
too much fire for a garden hose," Wegner said. "It was just the three
of us, and we knew the next unit was five minutes out. But we knew we
had kids in there. When kids are involved, it ups the ante."</TE>
<TE>   With fire burning in the living room between the front door and
the bedroom, Wegner manned the hose as McMurray ran through the
flames to the 5-year-old girl and then carried her to safety. Grodde
raised a 24-foot extension ladder to the bedroom window and pulled
out the 1-year-old boy.</TE>
<TE>   "Joe and Mike saved them," Wegner said. "No question it was a
close call. In a matter of minutes, or seconds really, those kids
wouldn't have made it."</TE>
<TE>   The children were being treated for smoke inhalation at a hospital
but were otherwise unharmed, officials said. They also were placed in
protective custody.</TE>
<TE>   Their mother, Gabriela Camacho, 25, was being held at the
sheriff's Lancaster station, with bail set at $50,000.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty-two firefighters responded to the call and doused the blaze
in less than 15 minutes. Fire officials estimated the damage at about
$65,000.</TE>

<HD>Ventura Boy, 15, Convicted in Beating Death of Transient</HD>
<DH>Verdict: Judge says even though Rocky Mattley was a
tag-along, he is accountable for the attack on the homeless man at
the beach.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 15-year-old Ventura boy was convicted of second-degree murder
Friday for participating in the beachside slaying of a homeless man
who was beaten by a group of party-going teens last summer.</LD>
<LD>   Rocky Mattley, a freckle-faced youth with no prior criminal
record, was convicted after a four-day trial in Ventura County
Juvenile Court.</LD>
<LD>   Although defense lawyers argued that he was a tag-along to three
older teens, Judge John E. Dobroth said he had no choice but to hold
Mattley accountable because he participated in the deadly assault.</LD>
<TE>   After the ruling, Mattley looked to his parents, seated in the
front row of the courtroom. His mother rushed out in tears. His
father whispered "I love you" as the bailiff led the boy away.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Public Defender Howard Asher predicted the likely outcome
during his remarks in court.</TE>
<TE>   "Rocky candidly acknowledged that he kicked the man a couple of
times," Asher said. "There doesn't seem to be a defense theory that
excludes liability."</TE>
<TE>   Outside the courtroom, prosecutors Maeve Fox and Stacy Ratner said
the court now faces a greater challenge: deciding how to rehabilitate
a juvenile whose first offense was aiding and abetting murder.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys oppose sending Mattley to the California Youth
Authority, where he could be held until his 25th birthday.</TE>
<TE>   Ratner said there are a variety of alternative placements, but she
acknowledged that many group homes won't accept a juvenile convicted
of murder.</TE>
<TE>   All sides agree that the goal is not punishment, but helping
Mattley make a fresh start.</TE>
<TE>   "I think all the parties feel the same way," Fox said. "The goal
is to get him the backing he needs to get stability in his life."</TE>
<TE>   The deadly assault occurred the night of June 30 after a group of
teenagers allegedly robbed 58-year-old James Clark, then kicked, beat
and threw rocks at the homeless veteran as he lay in a sleeping bag
near the mouth of the Ventura River, close to Surfers Point.</TE>
<TE>   Clark died after sustaining severe multiple blunt-force injuries
that included a crushed kidney, a broken rib and possible skull
fracture.</TE>
<TE>   Police later arrested Robert Coffman, 19, of Oak View; Timothy
Becker, 18, of Ventura; Christopher Dunham, 19, of Ventura; and
Mattley. They obtained conflicting statements from the four suspects.</TE>
<TE>   Mattley admitted in a taped interview to kicking "a bum" as he and
the other teenagers headed to a beach party. He also admitted
throwing a rock at the man.</TE>
<TE>   According to court testimony, Mattley later "freaked out" after
learning that the homeless man had died. He told friends he didn't
realize the assault could result in death.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County prosecutors have since charged all four teenagers
with murder. They elected to prosecute Mattley in Juvenile Court
because he was 14 at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Mattley's trial before a Superior Court judge began earlier this
month with testimony from the medical examiner and continued
Wednesday as defense lawyers pushed to throw out the youth's
statements to police.</TE>
<TE>   Dobroth denied the request Friday, rejecting defense arguments
that police coerced the boy and violated the law by preventing him
from talking to his parents before the interrogation.</TE>
<TE>   The judge found Mattley knew what he was doing when he consented
to an interview and seemed eager to tell his side of the story,
telling detectives: "If it has to do with the bum, I think I can help
you out."</TE>
<TE>   The other suspects are scheduled to stand trial April 26. They
face possible life sentences in prison, if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   During a preliminary hearing last month for Coffman and Becker,
Ventura Police Det. Pat Stevens testified that the two men admitted
assaulting Clark while heading to a party with Mattley and Dunham.</TE>
<TE>   The group took the homeless man's radio and backpack, which held a
container of pennies, Stevens said. They pelted the victim with the
coins and then kicked him in the face, arms and chest, he said.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Will Offer Valley City Nearly All It Asks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARON BERNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Negotiators for the city of Los Angeles plan to offer the proposed
new San Fernando Valley city nearly all of the parks, police stations
and other assets that proponents had requested, according to a
document released this week.</LD>
<LD>   The asset list, to be presented to the City Council on Tuesday and
used in negotiations with secession supporters, would turn over six
police stations, 31 fire stations and 22 libraries to the new city if
it is created by voters in November.</LD>
<LD>   The city would also transfer 111 parks, three animal shelters and
13 municipal buildings to the new city, along with 26 maintenance
yards and parking lots.</LD>
<TE>   "On 90% of the issues, the city agrees with the Valley," said
former state Assemblyman Richard Katz, who serves on the board of
Valley Vote and has been active in its effort to put a secession
proposal on the ballot. "It's the first time they've actually done
that."</TE>
<TE>   Katz said his group learned recently that several additional
parks, including the popular Hansen Dam recreation center and the
Sepulveda Basin area, were not owned by the city, and so could not be
transferred.</TE>
<TE>   But, he said, the new city could lease them from the federal
government and other owners.</TE>
<TE>   Still in dispute are four fire stations near the proposed new
city's border with Los Angeles. Those fire stations, although in the
Valley, were not offered because they service neighborhoods that
would remain in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Katz said the status of those fire stations would be decided as
negotiations continue between the two sides. He suggested that the
proposed Valley city take ownership of them but agree to service Los
Angeles residents in case of fire.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, state Controller Kathleen Connell is expected on Monday
to release her review of the financial viability of proposed Valley
and harbor area cities.</TE>

<HD>4 Wounded in Drive-By Shootings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four people were wounded Friday in separate drive-by shootings in
South Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The first shooting left two women critically wounded in an
industrial neighborhood at South San Pedro Street and West Slauson
Avenue just before 2:30 p.m.</LD>
<LD>   The women, in their 20s, were in a car and became involved in a
dispute with three or four males in another car, Sgt. Randy Goens
said. One of the men fired a semiautomatic rifle, striking each woman
once in the upper body, Goens said.</LD>
<TE>   About two hours later, shots were fired at a father and son on
South Bronson Avenue near Adams Boulevard in the Jefferson Park
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   The 18-year-old was struck three times, including once in the
head, police said. His father, Hyman Lewis, 44, said he ran to his
son "and I told him to pray to God." He said his son is not a gang
member. But a friend said he had warned the young man Friday not to
wear colors that would make him a target for gang members.</TE>
<TE>   The young man was in critical but stable condition.</TE>
<TE>   Ten minutes after that shooting, a 25-year-old man suffered a
graze wound to his head in the 4100 block of Hillcrest Drive during
another drive-by attack, police said.</TE>

<HD>Times Sues County Over Meetings</HD>
<DH>Court: The action claims supervisors routinely violated
state law by discussing matters in secret.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAURA LOH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Times filed a lawsuit Friday against the Los Angeles
County Board of Supervisors, alleging its members violated state law
by holding private meetings to discuss county business.</LD>
<LD>   The complaint claims that in a series of in-person and telephonic
meetings, supervisors planned ways to defeat a proposed ballot
initiative that would increase wages for the county's home
health-care aides.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit also contends that the supervisors' health deputies
act as a "shadow board" by holding private meetings about matters
before the board votes on them, and that supervisors have private,
individual discussions with the county administrator every Monday
about items on the board's Tuesday agenda.</LD>
<TE>   County Counsel Lloyd Pellman, after hearing about the lawsuit,
denied that the board violated open meeting laws.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not aware of any violations of the Brown Act," Pellman said.
"I cannot imagine any organization of any size operating in a manner
where its chief appointed individual--as the chief administrative
officer is for the county of Los Angeles--would be restrained from
meeting with his bosses on a basis where the public had to be able to
be in attendance."</TE>
<TE>   The Times reported this month that the supervisors tried to thwart
the health-care initiative in closed meetings. The content of those
meetings surfaced after the county declined the newspaper's public
records request but accidentally enclosed the documents sought along
with the denial letter.</TE>
<TE>   Richard McKee, president of the California First Amendment
Coalition, is a co-plaintiff in The Times lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   "The Times is bringing this suit on behalf of the public, to
enforce a law that keeps the government running in the open," said
Susan Seager, an attorney for the plaintiffs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's usually really hard to enforce the Brown Act, because
usually when governments talk in secret, it stays secret. Because of
their mistake, we were able to get a window into their closed
sessions," Seager said.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit alleges that in private meetings from Dec. 18 through
Jan. 8, the board voted to kill the health-care initiative using a
tactic that is illegal under the state elections code, rescinded that
decision after realizing it would not hold up in court, and discussed
whether the meetings had violated the Brown Act.</TE>
<TE>   All of the meetings, including the ones discussing the legality of
the board's actions, violated the Brown Act because the public was
neither notified nor allowed to attend, the complaint alleges.</TE>
<TE>   The board will hold a public hearing Tuesday to air complaints
that the county routinely violates open government laws. All but one
supervisor has already proposed changes or asked for reports on
alleged violations.</TE>
<TE>   "I think ... the Board of Supervisors are all committed to
conducting themselves individually and collectively in an ethical way
that conforms to the law, mindful of the interests of the taxpayers
that they serve," Pellman said.</TE>
<TE>   Because of Pellman's involvement in the meetings in question,
Supervisors Gloria Molina and Don Knabe have recommended that the
county hire a lawyer to review their suggestions for reform.</TE>
<TE>   Signatures are being collected for the initiative, which would
appear on the November ballot.</TE>

<HD>New Soda Tax Idea Reignites an Old Debate</HD>
<DH>Capitol: Bill raises the issue of using laws for social
engineering. Sponsor cites state budget woes and a desire to cut
childhood obesity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Citing California's huge budget shortfall and its growing number of
overweight children, a state lawmaker is proposing a new tax on soda
to fight childhood obesity.</LD>
<LD>   The idea is given little chance of passing, at least not in this
election year, but it's reigniting an old debate at the Capitol about
the proper role of tax policy as a social engineering tool.</LD>
<LD>   The California Soda Tax Act by Sen. Deborah Ortiz (D-Sacramento)
is seen as the leading edge of a broader initiative to tax or levy
fees on a variety of eating and drinking habits.</LD>
<TE>   One lawmaker, in fact, has introduced a bill to study taxing a
wider range of junk food to finance health programs for children.
Another may try to impose a fee on retail sales of alcoholic
beverages to bolster trauma rooms.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman John Campbell (R-Irvine) described the soda proposal
as the latest attempt to demonize a legal product to justify
increasing taxes. Targets of so-called sin taxes have traditionally
included tobacco, alcohol and gambling.</TE>
<TE>   "Where will this ever stop?" asked Campbell, a self-described soda
abstainer who handles budget matters for his caucus. "Are they going
to tax the butter on my carrots because carrots are healthier without
butter?</TE>
<TE>   "I think if you ate too much tofu it's probably bad for you, so
does that mean we should tax tofu in big jars?"</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz's plan would impose a surtax on distributors of soda and
other sweetened drinks--but not diet beverages--at a rate of about 2
cents per 12-ounce can. She said the tax could raise as much as $300
million a year.</TE>
<TE>   A more traditional sin tax is also under consideration this year
as state officials attempt to close a projected $17.5-billion budget
shortfall. Ortiz wants to raise the state excise tax on a pack of
cigarettes by 65 cents to $1.52, which would give California the
highest tax of that variety in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   But it's the soda tax that has ignited a lively discussion, as
Ortiz hoped it would.</TE>
<TE>   Reducing childhood obesity, she contends, should be one of the
major policy objectives in California. She believes that the
increased prevalence of the condition is being fueled by young people
consuming more sweetened drinks and less milk.</TE>
<TE>   "In this culture of the 'Big Gulp,' it's really quite alarming,"
said Ortiz, chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Health and Human
Services and another soda abstainer. "I don't think there's any one
staple of a child or teenager's diet that is so utterly devoid of any
nutritional value as soda."</TE>
<TE>   Sean McBride, a spokesman for the National Soft Drink Assn.,
countered, "It's overly simplistic to say if we eliminate soft drinks
from the food supply that people will be healthy."</TE>
<TE>   McBride offered an alternative to the big-government approach to
diminishing childhood obesity: 30 minutes of exercise a day and a
balanced diet.</TE>
<TE>   He cited Arkansas, Washington and West Virginia as states that
impose special or excise taxes on soft drinks. In California, only
sales taxes are now applied to carbonated beverages.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates of Ortiz's proposal cite a changing environment as cause
for government intervention.</TE>
<TE>   Children are spending too much time staring at video game,
computer and television screens, they say. At the same time, young
people are being bombarded by attractively packaged foods with poor
nutritional quality.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't just hold an individual responsible when we've created
an environment that supports the genetic expression of obesity," said
Joanne Ikeda, a nutrition specialist in UC Berkeley's department of
nutritional sciences.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole childhood obesity problem is based on the myth that
just fat kids have problems," said Ikeda, an advisor to the National
Assn. to Advance Fat Acceptance, a group dedicated to improving the
quality of life for fat people.</TE>
<TE>   "The truth of the matter is all children, regardless of their size
and shape, are practicing poor lifestyles in terms of health."</TE>
<TE>   In California, an estimated 30% of children are overweight or at
risk of being overweight, with as many as half of all children in
some school districts weighing too much, said Harold Goldstein,
executive director of the California Center for Public Health
Advocacy.</TE>
<TE>   "What this means about future rates of heart disease, cancer,
diabetes and stroke is staggering," he said. "We're sitting on a time
bomb."</TE>
<TE>   The soda tax idea builds on a junk-food bill by state Sen. Martha
Escutia (D-Whittier), also proposed as a way to combat childhood
obesity.</TE>
<TE>   Approved by the Legislature last year, the measure mandates that
foods sold at elementary and middle schools meet certain nutritional
requirements, among other changes, by 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Consumption Not Seen as Dropping Sharply</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz said she does not expect a new tax on soda to drastically
reduce its consumption in California. She said her key goal is to
raise money to help get schools out of the business of selling soda
and junk food to children to fund programs.</TE>
<TE>   Money from the tax also would be used to teach children to care
for their teeth as well as to treat and prevent obesity by educating
them about nutrition and getting them involved in physical
activities.</TE>
<TE>   "They need labor-intensive programs that require them to learn new
habits and include repeated visits," said Dr. Lynda K. Fisher, a
pediatric endocrinologist at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz has also drawn the ire of the tobacco industry for proposing
the cigarette tax increase. She said that proposal could raise $800
million for tobacco education, cancer research and medical services
for the working poor. The plan is supported by a variety of health
groups.</TE>
<TE>   "It would pour revenues to those programs that need to be done
better," said Ortiz, a former smoker.</TE>
<TE>   Brendan McCormick, a spokesman for Philip Morris USA, said tobacco
taxes are not a long-term solution to the state's fiscal problems,
particularly when it comes to health care programs. Using a declining
revenue source to fund programs with increasing costs doesn't add up,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If programs are worth funding for the broader population, they
should have a broader-based funding source, rather than singling out
smokers," McCormick said.</TE>
<TE>   Three states--Connecticut, New York and Utah--have raised state
excise taxes on cigarettes this year, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The tobacco and soda taxes are regressive, which means that
lower-income families would bear a relatively higher share of the
burden, said Jean Ross, executive director of the California Budget
Project, a group that advocates for the poor during the budget
process.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Ross described Ortiz's proposals as a logical response to a
politically difficult situation: trying to fund worthy programs in
lean fiscal times.</TE>
<TE>   Mustering the political will to raise taxes is considered a
longshot around the Capitol because it is an election year and
because Gov. Gray Davis, who is seeking a second term, has repeatedly
said he will do his best to avoid tax increases.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, lawmakers are not stopping at soda and cigarettes as
possible tax targets.</TE>
<TE>   To address concerns that California students are struggling at
school because they are sick, lawmakers led by Assemblywoman Wilma
Chan (D-Alameda) are pushing a package of proposals to improve their
health.</TE>
<TE>   Chan has introduced a measure that would require the state to
study the feasibility of taxing junk foods to pay for dental and
health services for children.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota charges sales taxes on candy, chewing gum and ice cream,
and Texas imposes them on candy, Goldstein said.</TE>
<TE>   Californians, however, have not responded kindly to similar taxes.
It took infuriated voters less than 15 months to repeal a so-called
snack tax that state officials imposed on snack food, bottled water
and candy. Revenues from the sales tax were used to help close a
$14-billion state budget shortfall in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Gloria Romero (D-Los Angeles) said she may try to
impose a fee on the retail sale of alcoholic beverages to help fund
trauma centers. To draw a nexus between alcohol consumption and
trauma centers, she has cited a court ruling that fees imposed to
mitigate harm done by sellers of a product are reasonable.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone buys the connection, however.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's an unfair tax," said Sy Fried, president of the Wine
&amp; Spirit Wholesalers of California. "Why should alcohol support a
trauma caused by drugs?"</TE>
<TE>   Larry McCarthy, president of the California Taxpayers Assn., said
he does not believe that Romero's proposal bears any of the
characteristics of a fee, which he contends should not finance a
general government service that provide benefits to the broader
community.</TE>
<TE>   The thread that connects proposals by Chan, Ortiz and Romero, he
said, is that they all send a chill through the state's business
community.</TE>
<TE>   "It sends a really damaging signal about California," McCarthy
said. "That kind of signal scares investment away."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge on Friday sided with Thousand Oaks and Ventura County
officials by temporary halting Adelphia Communications Corp.'s
purchase of Verizon's Americast cable system.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Court Judge Audrey B. Collins granted a temporary
restraining order to force the companies to maintain separate cable
operations, at least until an April 12 preliminary hearing.</LD>
<LD>   "Despite Adelphia's legal maneuvering, we were able to get the
matter before the court ... to protect the interests of the city
residents," said Jason R. Alcala, a deputy city attorney for Thousand
Oaks.</LD>
<TE>   The companies must temporarily keep their employees, operate the
cable systems separately and segregate money received from former
Verizon customers, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia attorneys are reviewing the order and "should have a
better understanding of the implications by next week," said regional
Vice President Lee Perron.</TE>

<HD>Josef von Stroheim, 79; Film, TV Sound Editor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS MCLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Josef Erich von Stroheim, an award-winning motion picture and
television sound editor who was also the son of the legendary silent
film director Erich von Stroheim, has died. He was 79.</LD>
<LD>   Von Stroheim died March 22 at Valley Presbyterian Hospital in Van
Nuys of complications from lung cancer.</LD>
<LD>   Among Von Stroheim's motion picture credits are "Day of the
Dolphin," "Carnal Knowledge," "Blume in Love," "Jeremiah Johnson,"
"The Getaway," "A Star Is Born," "Three Days of the Condor" and
"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore."</LD>
<TE>   He also worked on numerous television shows, including "The Cisco
Kid," "Range Rider," "Wild Bill Hickock" "The Real McCoys," "The
Untouchables," "Flipper," "Mannix," "Wonder Woman" and "Scarecrow and
Mrs. King."</TE>
<TE>   Von Stroheim was born in Los Angeles in 1922 and grew up in
Bel-Air. He entered the motion picture business in 1939 as a still
photographer in the MGM publicity department, often riding to work in
the morning with Clark Gable.</TE>
<TE>   But from shooting stars, Von Stroheim's career took a dramatic
detour during World War II. After enlisting in the Army in 1942, he
served as a combat photographer in Europe and later the South
Pacific. At war's end he was in Tokyo, where his subjects included
Japanese Gen. Hideki Tojo, who was later executed for war crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Although the work of combat photographers has been used in
countless documentaries and history books, they rarely receive credit
beyond the standard "Army Pictorial Services."</TE>
<TE>   Von Stroheim was a member of the International Combat Camera
Assn., part of whose mission is to lobby film companies for
individual attribution and to arrange museum exhibits to raise combat
photographers' public profile.</TE>
<TE>   As a sound editor, Von Stroheim won two Emmys for his work ("QB
VII" and "The Immortal") and five Motion Picture Sound Editors Golden
Reel Awards, including for "The Getaway," "Three Days of the Condor"
and television's "The Untouchables" and "Mission Impossible."</TE>
<TE>   Von Stroheim, who retired in 1988, was a longtime member of the
Motion Picture Editors Guild board.</TE>
<TE>   "He was one of the top sound editors in the business," said
Stanley Frazen, former guild president.</TE>
<TE>   Von Stroheim is survived by his wife, Harriet; daughters Lori vS
Manz of Las Vegas and Vicki von Stroheim-Seay of Honolulu; and two
grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service will be held at noon today at Pierce Bros.
Valhalla Mortuary in North Hollywood.</TE>

<HD>Boy Convicted in Fatal Beating of Transient</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 15-year-old Ventura boy was convicted of second-degree murder
Friday for participating in the beachside slaying of a homeless man
who was beaten by a group of party-going teens last summer.</LD>
<LD>   Rocky Mattley, a freckle-faced youth with no prior criminal
record, was convicted after a four-day trial in Ventura County
Juvenile Court.</LD>
<LD>   Although defense lawyers argued that he was a tag-along to three
older teens, Judge John E. Dobroth said he had no choice but to hold
Mattley accountable because he participated in the deadly assault.</LD>
<TE>   After the ruling, Mattley looked to his parents, seated in the
front row of the courtroom. His mother rushed out in tears. His
father whispered "I love you" as the bailiff led the boy away.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Public Defender Howard Asher predicted the likely outcome
during his remarks in court.</TE>
<TE>   "Rocky candidly acknowledged that he kicked the man a couple of
times," Asher said. "There doesn't seem to be a defense theory that
excludes liability."</TE>
<TE>   Outside the courtroom, prosecutors Maeve Fox and Stacy Ratner said
the court now faces a greater challenge: deciding how to rehabilitate
a juvenile whose first offense was aiding and abetting murder.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys oppose sending Mattley to the California Youth
Authority, where he could be held until his 25th birthday.</TE>
<TE>   Ratner said there are a variety of alternative placements, but she
acknowledged that many group homes won't accept a juvenile convicted
of murder.</TE>
<TE>   All sides agree that the goal is not punishment, but helping
Mattley make a fresh start.</TE>
<TE>   "I think all the parties feel the same way," Fox said. "The goal
is to get him the backing he needs to get stability in his life."</TE>
<TE>   The deadly assault occurred the night of June 30 after a group of
teenagers allegedly robbed 58-year-old James Clark, then kicked, beat
and threw rocks at the homeless veteran as he lay in a sleeping bag
near the mouth of the Ventura River, close to Surfers Point.</TE>
<TE>   Clark died after sustaining severe multiple blunt-force injuries
that included a crushed kidney, a broken rib and possible skull
fracture.</TE>
<TE>   Police later arrested Robert Coffman, 19, of Oak View; Timothy
Becker, 18, of Ventura; Christopher Dunham, 19, of Ventura; and
Mattley. They obtained conflicting statements from the four suspects.</TE>
<TE>   Mattley admitted in a taped interview to kicking "a bum" as he and
the other teenagers headed to a beach party. He also admitted
throwing a rock at the man.</TE>
<TE>   According to court testimony, Mattley later "freaked out" after
learning that the homeless man had died. He told friends he didn't
realize the assault could result in death.</TE>
<TE>   The other suspects are scheduled to stand trial April 26. They
face possible life imprisonment.</TE>

<HD>Los Angeles Wants Its 'Doris Day' Parking</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW BENDER</AU>
<BD>Andrew Bender is a writer in Santa Monica.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I hear there's a fabulous new shopping experience called the Grove,
next to the Farmers Market. I may never visit.</LD>
<LD>   Oh, I'm sure the stores are lovely, the movie theaters state of
the art and the restaurants decent.</LD>
<LD>   But I won't go because they've gotten rid of the free parking.</LD>
<TE>   Chalk it up to my East Coast mentality. I grew up in New England,
where people still know the value of a dollar, and I used to live in
Philadelphia, where finding a parking space even three blocks away
was cause for rejoicing. But here in California we are soft. We
require what my friend Steve calls "Doris Day" parking.</TE>
<TE>   It's almost a movie cliche: It's the late '50s, Doris is driving
her convertible though Manhattan, every hair in place, humming "Que
Sera Sera," and she finds a parking space in front of the very
building she's visiting.</TE>
<TE>   Undoubtedly the filmmakers were Californians and thus could be
excused for not knowing that nobody in the history of Manhattan has
ever found Doris Day parking, not even Doris Day. In Los Angeles,
safe, clean, close, free parking was always thought of as an
entitlement.</TE>
<TE>   Given this history, this
being-charged-for-parking-when-you're-already-spending-your-hard-earn
ed-money thing should chill the blood of every Angeleno.</TE>
<TE>   I refuse to visit the new Hollywood &amp; Highland complex because its
$10 parking fee is extortion. And whose idea was it to make people
pay to park at Disneyland ($7 and up)? As if anyone would park there
to go someplace else.</TE>
<TE>   The Beverly Center makes you pay for parking no matter how much
you spend or how short your stay. The city of West Hollywood's public
coffers must flow like Cosmopolitans at the Sky Bar, with revenues
from a restricted parking racket that is vicious in the speed of its
enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   Don't get me started on valet parking. Some restaurants charge
$4.50 or more for it. Some hotels require you to valet park and
charge for the privilege. And if you're leaving after an event, you
might wait 20 minutes for your car.</TE>
<TE>   My dentist's office has valet parking too. It's free--my dentist
validates--but I feel horrible if I don't tip the guy a buck after
he's repositioned my seats and mirrors and handed over my car with
barely a "Thank you, sir."The main shopping districts in Beverly
Hills and Santa Monica have it about right, with municipal lots
offering two hours of free daytime self-parking, with a reasonable
charge thereafter. There's a similar arrangement at the Century City
Shopping Center. I say it's "about right" because the lots often are
full.</TE>
<TE>   One of the few shopping areas that never charged for parking was
the Farmers Market, and now, with the Grove, even that's gone,
replaced by a snarky validation system.</TE>
<TE>   In L.A. free street parking usually is hardly ever more than a
couple of blocks away. I have my parking areas for the Music Center,
Third Street Promenade and Chinatown. I've even found on-street
parking outside Dodger Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Don't ask me where they are unless you're a close friend or
trusted colleague. But if you hear of any such parking near the
Grove, I'd be...uhh...kind of curious.</TE>

<LD>In the aftermath of the dog-mauling trial of Marjorie Knoller and
Robert Noel, we should take a hard look at what we can do to prevent
more tragedies like the one that befell Diane Whipple.</LD>
<LD>   Before her death, many of Whipple's neighbors had complained about
Noel and Knoller's dogs. Now people wonder why the authorities did
not act sooner. If San Francisco's animal control department is
anything like Los Angeles', I can see how such a tragedy can happen.</LD>
<LD>   In fall 1999, a couple rented the house next door. They had two
fairly large dogs (pit bull/lab mixes) that they kept in their
backyard all day and night, exposed to the elements. When it rained,
the dogs would howl. When it was 105 degrees, the dogs would whimper.
Soon the dogs were barking nonstop, banging against the fence, trying
to break out. On two occasions, they did break out and chased people.
I asked my neighbors to fortify their fence, but they responded with
insults and threats.</LD>
<TE>   I called the county animal control department but no officers came
out. Soon, the dogs began breaking out with greater regularity. They
mauled a tiny beagle being walked by its owner. They broke into a
neighbor's yard and had to be pepper-sprayed. Animal control's
response was to mail form letters to the owners, asking them to
control their animals. The dogs broke into two other yards, killing
one pet and attacking two others.</TE>
<TE>   Animal control finally sent an officer out. It was then that I
began to be educated in the baffling policies of the department.</TE>
<TE>   When a dog is suspected of being vicious, animal control sends an
officer to observe the dog, but only in its own home and only
interacting with its owners. This is misleading. Most vicious dogs do
not behave viciously with their owners. The dogs should be observed
in a public place, interacting with strangers.</TE>
<TE>   Animal control is not concerned with dogs that chase or lunge at
people if the intended victims get away. Only if a human is bitten
does animal control become interested.</TE>
<TE>   After several more incidents involving their dogs attacking people
and pets, my neighbors were evicted. I wrote to animal control,
asking them to find out where these people were moving to, and,
providing they were still in L.A., to make sure that their dogs were
secure. Otherwise, I wrote, the dogs will break out again, and more
people and pets will be injured or killed.</TE>
<TE>   It is policy to end an investigation when subjects under
investigation move, even if they remain in L.A. Animal control cases
are filed by addresses, not names. If a subject moves, the old case
is closed. The department puts millions of people and pets in
jeopardy by allowing the owners of vicious dogs to get a clean slate
every time they move. Any new victims have no way of knowing that
there have been previous complaints.</TE>
<TE>   Within the first three months at their new address, my former
neighbors' dogs severely mauled a dog, attacked a woman pushing her
baby in a stroller, attacked a mail carrier and chased an elderly
woman, sending her to the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   A resident in the owners' new neighborhood contacted animal
control and was told that there were no previous complaints against
the dogs. Had he not found and talked to me, he never would have
known about the previous attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Will it take a high-profile death to force Angelenos to examine
how the animal control department investigates dangerous dogs?</TE>

<LD>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors needs a 12-step program
to overcome its addiction to secrecy. For starters, it needs to admit
it has a problem. In a story earlier this week, Times reporter Evelyn
Larrubia reviewed a year's worth of county records and found that the
board had publicly discussed just 7% of the items on its agendas. The
rest it decided without discussion, continued to another date or
moved to a closed session.</LD>
<LD>   Where does the other 93% of the fact-finding, debating and
deal-making required to run a $15-billion government serving almost
10 million residents get done? Behind the scenes, apparently, hashed
out in closed meetings, in unpublicized gatherings of supervisors'
deputies and in tete-a-tetes between individual supervisors and
county administrators. Chief Administrator David Janssen told
Larrubia, "Nine times out of 10, by the time [the matters] come to
the board the problems have been resolved." He didn't seem to realize
that the public's problems are supposed to be resolved in public.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisors Michael Antonovich and Don Knabe deny or rationalize
the board's habitual secrecy. All supervisors defend at least some of
these practices, saying they are efficient ways to handle routine
matters that would otherwise bog down board meetings, not smarmy
attempts to conceal dastardly deeds.</LD>
<TE>   The problem here is twofold: First, state law prohibits the use of
"personal intermediaries" to develop a collective agreement, as well
as anything that can be construed as a "serial meeting" in which
consensus on an agenda item is reached. Discussion, debate and even
information acquisition are supposed to be open to the public. It is
clear that all that has already occurred when meetings with 70-plus
items on the agenda routinely end by noon. Democracy is not
efficient. Second, the supervisors have lost all credibility when it
comes to defending closed meetings. Sometimes they are trying to keep
dastardly deeds secret.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, the county denied a Times request for the
minutes of a closed December meeting, only to inadvertently include
the documents with the denial. The records revealed that four of the
five supervisors tried to quash a proposed initiative to raise the
salaries of in-home health aides for the elderly. If that weren't
smarmy enough, it was also illegal, or so the county counsel, who had
devised the scheme, later decided.</TE>
<TE>   The board could use a refresher course on the letter and spirit of
public access laws, and not one delivered by either the county
counsel or chief administrator. Supervisors Zev Yaroslavsky, the only
one to vote against the initiative caper, and Gloria Molina offer
solutions, from opening deputies' meetings to tape- recording closed
meetings. Their proposals will be taken up Tuesday. This is one
meeting that is likely to last past noon.</TE>

<LD>Much of the eastern United States, especially New York City--badly
beleaguered by Sept. 11's attacks, the resulting economic stumble and
a severe municipal budget deficit--now confronts the kind of
developing water shortages only too familiar to Westerners,
especially Southern Californians. It's a reminder that ordinary water
will remain an extraordinary issue nationally.</LD>
<LD>   The West Coast, inured to drought, was largely spared this time
around. Inland, Salt Lake City got timely Olympic snows, but much of
the Rocky Mountains' snowpack is below average, raising concerns for
summer wildfires and fish habitat. Already, wildfires have scorched
thousands of acres in Colorado and Arizona, with ominous implications
elsewhere as summer heat waves move north. The East's drought is
already a reality for consumers. Starting Monday, Gotham and large
suburban populations will be under a California-style drought
emergency with mandatory water conservation steps.</LD>
<LD>   Early New Yorkers relied on private wells and curbside pipes of
hollow logs. Like Los Angeles, New York eventually took water from
distant areas--and survived court challenges. Massive water tunnel
projects are still underway. But even all that is insufficient.</LD>
<TE>   The current problem's scale impresses: The 19 reservoirs serving
the city and Westchester County can hold 558 billion gallons.
Normally, they'd have about 500 billion gallons now, but they contain
barely 280 billion. With consumption at 1.3 billion gallons per day,
that's not much margin and puts a lot of faith in summer rains. New
Yorkers responded to voluntary conservation requests, cutting hourly
consumption by 1.25 million gallons, or 2%, a lot of showers
shortened. Still, beginning next week, New Yorkers will endure
conditions that ring familiar in Southern California: no driveway
carwashes, sidewalk hosings or gushing fountains. Farewell,
restaurant water glasses. And hello, no April Fooling Day.</TE>

<HD>Welfare Reform Fantasy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Bush administration has brainstormed up a proposal for fixing the
welfare system that's so touchy-feely it would make Oprah blush. Why
not, his policy wonks wonder, let welfare moms meet part of their
work requirement by joining their children in organized
activities--say hiking with the local Scout troop, coaching a soccer
team or teaching finger painting to squirming Head Start kids?</LD>
<LD>   Tough guys will no doubt scream that this is mollycoddling. We
think it reflects a pragmatic realization that the best way to break
the multi-generational cycle of dependence is to bolster today's
welfare kids. For such a creative approach to work, however,
President Bush must first back away from a bad idea.</LD>
<LD>   Just six years ago the public assistance system was a failure, at
least for taxpayers. Then the Clinton administration and Congress
rewrote the law, telling welfare recipients--primarily single
mothers--that they had a certain amount of time to get a job and off
welfare or the government would throw them off. Since then, the
number of families who depend on public assistance has plummeted from
5 million to just over 2 million.</LD>
<TE>   Emboldened by this success, Bush is eager to tighten the rules
when the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families law comes up
for renewal this year. He wants to require states to push seven out
of 10 remaining welfare recipients into jobs within five years, a
boost from the initial goal of getting three out of 10 employed.</TE>
<TE>   What Bush doesn't grasp, or is ignoring, is that the drop in
welfare rolls to date owed more to a booming economy than a new moral
imperative. In fact, his effort to speed up the purge would be overly
optimistic even in the best of times.</TE>
<TE>   In the first five years of reform, those who were eager to work or
easy to employ quickly got jobs in the robust economy. Some of those
remaining on welfare are unmotivated, undependable and largely
unemployable. But even a layabout's child deserves clothing, shelter
and attention. That's why the president should set a more realistic
goal of nudging perhaps five out of 10 recipients into jobs by the
next deadline and also pay for child care, so that the mothers who do
work won't be scarring their children.</TE>
<TE>   The current Bush proposal, which would require 500,000 more
parents to get jobs, ignores child care expense. Child care in
California alone could cost an additional $400 million. But until
Bush takes care of this fundamental need, he can't move on to his
more innovative ideas. He thinks, for instance, that he can reduce
the welfare ranks by giving states as much as $1 million each  to
teach young people about the benefits of marriage and young men about
responsible fatherhood.</TE>
<TE>   Although many studies prove that children who grow up in
two-parent homes are less likely to grow up impoverished, we're not
sure that young people will accept the message from government
preachers. But marriage is an antidote to poverty, so we encourage
Bush to read Daniel Patrick Moynihan's research from the mid-1960s.
What really encourages and strengthens marriages, Moynihan found, are
good, steady jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Which brings us back to that dependency cycle, and the standard by
which society should judge the success of reform. If society is going
to significantly cut welfare costs for future generations, it must
encourage welfare parents to work but also make sure that, working or
not, they are able to take care of their kids. Bush's people have
some fresh ideas on how to encourage this. They shouldn't undercut
themselves by skimping on child care and Head Start funding or by
setting an unrealistic numbers goal.</TE>

<LD>Re "Idea to Double-Deck the 101 Is on the Level," March 25: I was
impressed by three glaring absences from the 101 Freeway mitigation
debate.</LD>
<LD>   First, no one seems to be interviewing the myriad commuters who
would benefit from traffic relief on the nightmarish 101 Freeway.</LD>
<LD>   Contrary to the assertions of the NIMBYs, who have inappropriately
dominated the freeway situation to date, these taxpaying commuters
own the freeway right of way as much as its local neighbors.</LD>
<TE>   Second, none of the NIMBYs who oppose double-decking had any
better solutions for a problem that is not going away. Do these folks
recommend more homes get knocked down to expand the freeway?</TE>
<TE>   Third, it should be mentioned that although the elevated 110
Freeway carpool lanes are indeed a success, the 110 busway is not; in
fact, ridership shows it is a failure.</TE>
<TE>   Like it or not, transit officials know that cheaper busways pull
fewer commuters out of their cars than a quieter, smoother rail line.
The MTA just authorized a Valley busway that closely parallels the
101 Freeway. If Caltrans can expedite its conversion into a light, or
even heavy, rail with no at-grade street crossings, the speedy
freeway alternative that would connect to the Red Line would likely
please NIMBYs and commuters alike.</TE>
<TE>   Kenneth S. Alpern</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Having long observed and experienced the "parking lots" on the 101
Freeway, I am surprised, to say the least, at the shortsighted
proposals of Caltrans to solve the problem: widening the freeway or
double-decking it. By the time either plan is finished, the growth in
population and the number of automobiles will bring the 101 to the
same situation that exists today.</TE>
<TE>   I believe that a more practical approach would be to reduce the
number of automobiles that use the freeway by providing alternate
transportation.</TE>
<TE>   An elevated monorail, along the center of the freeway (or along
one side) from downtown to Calabasas (Agoura? Westlake? or?) would
conceivably take people out of their one-passenger cars. Properly
placed stops and, possibly, adjacent parking lots would make such a
program quite attractive.</TE>
<TE>   The time is long overdue for Caltrans to look for other means of
transportation besides making it possible for even more automobiles.</TE>

<LD>Re "Fueling a Green Energy Quest," editorial, March 25: Contrary to
The Times' opinion, the energy crisis of 2000-01 has refreshed, not
"disrupted," California's drive for increasing renewable electricity
generation.</LD>
<LD>   The Davis administration's renewed push for green power has
resulted in more megawatts from renewables in the last four years
than in the previous decade. Financial incentives for power plants
fueled by solar, wind, water, geothermal, "biomass" energy and others
supported 4,539 megawatts in 2001, with the potential to produce 470
megawatts more from 41 new renewable power plants in the next four
years.</LD>
<LD>   Through innovative auctions conducted by the Energy Commission's
Renewable Energy Program, renewable energy projects can receive up to
1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour during the first five years of operation.</LD>
<TE>   The $240-million awards boost efforts to expand the state's use of
renewable energy from 12% today to 17% by 2006--positioning
California to meet the state Senate Bill 532 target of 20% by 2010.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis' renewable agenda also includes $100 million in
incentives for up to half the system cost to consumers producing
their own electricity using renewable energy and over $50 million in
research projects for developing advanced renewable electricity
systems.</TE>

<LD>Given the myriad serious problems facing this country, from terrorist
attacks to unemployment, overseas job flight and the decimation of
the health care system, literally the last thing we need is a
multibillion-dollar Maginot Line in space ("Kill Vehicle Scores a Hit
With Proponents of Missile Defense," March 26). The issue is not
whether it works; the issue is whether anybody can manage to say,
without laughing, that we are probably going to be attacked by a
costly, antiquated weapon like the ICBM.</LD>
<LD>   If Congress has taken so many payoffs from the weapons contractors
that it feels it has no choice but to approve this program, can't we
just give the contractors the money? That way we can still have our
corporate welfare system for Raytheon, et al., but without the
dangerous boondoggle.</LD>

<TE>   I am continually amazed at the ingenuity and inventiveness of the
defense industry--and the arrogance. Developing a system that can be
described as hitting a bullet with a bullet is a fantastic scientific
achievement. However, when queried about the ability to cloak a
warhead from the exoatmospheric kill vehicle's infrared sensors by
cooling or insulating, its response is that it is "technologically
unfeasible." I find that answer disingenuous, since we use similar
cryogenic technology to cool the sensors in the kill vehicle. And
even if cooling the warhead isn't feasible, wouldn't placing it
inside one of 10 identically heated balloons also render infrared
discrimination moot?</TE>
<TE>   Any country that can design, construct and launch an ICBM armed
with nuclear weapons can certainly develop a cloaking system, or are
we to blithely assume its scientists are not as ingenious or
inventive as ours?</TE>

<LD>Re "Libraries Challenge Net Filter Requirement," March 25: As a
recently retired school library media teacher, I see a more serious
problem than pornography for children and youth who are increasingly
using the Internet for doing school homework and research. This is
the wide availability of inaccurate, biased and otherwise unreliable
information.</LD>
<LD>   After all, students know pornography when they see it, and filters
may offer some protection. But young people typically accept any
hits, usually the first few, that a search engine brings to them.
This information may or may not be reliable, and most students do not
care.</LD>
<LD>   Obviously, filters will not help, and students should not be
denied the use of the Internet as an information source. The solution
to this problem is to have library media teachers available to teach
and guide students in every California school. Unfortunately,
California is last in the nation regarding the number of students per
credentialed school librarian.</LD>

<LD>Re "Price of Free Trade: Famine," by Marc Edelman, Commentary, March
22: It is not free trade that causes famine and other ills in Latin
America. Inept, corrupt and oppressive governments do the most harm.
Rich countries do the rest by subsidizing and protecting their
agricultural, textile and steel industries--the very areas where poor
nations have competitive advantage.</LD>
<LD>   The anti-globalization crowd is coy about broaching plans for
development, but if you read between the lines they write you will
find advocacy for the same misguided policies--state socialism and
protectionism--that have caused so much human misery in the past.</LD>
<LD>   We all share a concern about the world's poor. But economic and
political freedom is not the problem.</LD>

<LD>Glad to hear that the Shrine Auditorium is getting renovated ("You

times, including to work the Academy Awards as a scenic artist. But
one indelible memory is from the late 1960s, when, as a college
student, I attended a Cream concert. Ginger Baker did a long drum
solo and fell off the back of the stage; later an announcement was
made (I am not making this up) that a baby had just been born in the
women's bathroom. Wish I knew the follow-up story about mother and
child.</LD>

<HD>Sheriff Baca Stumbles Over Vignali Clemency</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Informants Named Vignali's Father," March 26: I have been
employed as a police officer for the past 19 years and am appalled at
L.A. County Sheriff Lee Baca's endorsement of clemency for Carlos
Vignali.</LD>
<LD>   I hope that, before his decision to endorse Vignali, Baca took
into account the numerous law enforcement officers who have lost
their lives in the war against drugs. Baca said he is disgusted that
the White House did not do due diligence in the Vignali matter. Well,
Sheriff Baca, I am disgusted with you for even considering Vignali
for clemency.</LD>
<LD>   John C. Borrego</LD>
<TE>   Temecula</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Writing a clemency recommendation is a serious task. We've seen
the consequences of what happens when it's done in a slipshod
fashion, as done by Baca and former U.S. Atty. Alejandro Mayorkas, in
the case of Horacio Vignali's son Carlos.</TE>
<TE>   However, Mayorkas is at least to be commended for realizing the
seriousness of his mistake, accepting the blame for his actions and
apologizing.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, Baca, a good man and fine sheriff, looks
immature and possibly corrupt by comparison for refusing to accept
any blame whatsoever for his part in Vignali's release and for
failing to assign an aide to perform even the most basic background
research into the case, and also into the big-buck donor who asked
him to intervene--and his son.</TE>
<TE>   Let's hope Baca learns to accept his share of the responsibility
in this travesty of justice.</TE>

<LD>Re "Even If You Dress It Up, a Kangaroo Is Still a Kangaroo," by
Jonathan Turley, Commentary, March 21, and Michael Ramirez's cartoon,
March 23, on military tribunals: I must say that Ramirez got it
right. This constant blathering about civil rights is losing its
sting. When you whine about everything, you lose the credibility
required to exact people's attention.</LD>
<LD>   When you consider the recent problems with the Lockerbie trial,
such that complications may have caused a retrial or acquittal, it is
clear. We want military tribunals. No O.J. Simpson trial,
technicalities, constant extensions or trial motions here; we want
justice, something that is difficult in a normal trial.</LD>
<LD>   To refer to our military courts as something other than just is a
slap in America's face. Our military courts, run by a blind, deaf
monkey, are more just than 99.9% of the world's courts, especially
compared with the backward, medieval, dare I call them, civilizations
that the terrorists come from. Being ex-military, I am sure our
military courts are not "kangaroo," just as I am sure that those who
whine about them are jackasses.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Just after World War II, I was a civilian chaplain at the large
prison outside of Manila, where Japanese prisoners of war, convicted
by military tribunal, were being held. I had to witness several
hangings. In an article published in a U.S. magazine, the Christian
Century, I criticized the military trials.</TE>
<TE>   Among the points I raised were the following: 1) The crimes were
committed during the heat of war, when armies are first of all
concerned with self-preservation; 2) many misdeeds were apparently
done under orders of the commanding officer of an area; 3) a military
jury is made up of a panel of military men untrained in evaluating
evidence and conditioned to the idea of punishing the enemy; 4)
prosecution tends to be vindictive in military trials; 5) evidence
was not equally available to the defense; and 5) public sentiment is
against the accused, since they are identified with the enemy.</TE>
<TE>   I am glad that reports indicate a possible change in procedures,
but I still feel that a regular, nonmilitary court would be a better
way of dealing with the present prisoners.</TE>

<LD>Re "Cloak of Silence Covered Abuse at Jesuit Retreat," March 24:
Surely there must be a mistake! Can Fathers Thomas Smolich and Greg
Aherne, current and former Jesuit superiors, really subscribe to the
ethical position that they need not report to authorities
molestations of mentally impaired human beings under their watch
because the victims are not minors?</LD>
<LD>   How can they ethically justify sending sexual predators to live at
Bellarmine High School and Santa Clara University, where adolescents
are the majority population? These actions fly in the face of the
Jesuit training in ethics I received as a student at that same
university. Compassion for members of one's "family" cannot justify
actions that are likely to harm those most vulnerable. Precisely this
compassion makes it necessary to report all complaints of abuse to
civil authorities, where more objective professionals can examine the
evidence on both sides.</LD>

<TE>   When are Roman Catholic clergy "abuses" and "mistreatment" of
children and the mentally disabled going to be called what they
really are? It is important--and ultimately beneficial to the victims
and the church--that the truth be told. But let's be sure that we
tell the truth in no uncertain terms. These innocents weren't simply
abused or mistreated. They were raped.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan Schoerner</TE>
<TE>   South Pasadena</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   We are overlooking the most terrible irony of the pedophile-priest
issue. As these priests were satisfying their sexual urges with
children and mentally fragile adults, Catholic couples were being
advised that the only non-sinful way to avoid having too many
children was to abstain from sex. So these clerics were unable to
"just say no" to sex, even as their parishioners were told to do
exactly that.</TE>

<TE>   For 2,000 years Christian priests have tried to stop massacres,
pillage and the worship of pseudo-heroes who lead the way to
destruction and death at home and abroad. If we lacked for a model,
"the Prince of Peace," it would be necessary to invent one.</TE>

<LD>I have to put in my two cents' worth about the March 25 letters on
the dog-mauling case. I have had Doberman pinschers for the last 20
years since I was attacked in my own home. Having to certify someone
who wants to own an aggressive breed of dog won't work. The answer
lies with how the dog has been socialized. I have never trained any
of my dogs to be aggressive. They have only received obedience
training. Those Presa Canarios were not socialized properly. They
were also trained to kill for the sake of high wagers for pit
fighting. That's what sent those two dogs over the edge.</LD>
<LD>   I owned a dog 25 years ago that wasn't from an aggressive breed of
dog. She became vicious for what seemed like no apparent reason. When
she started snapping at children and trying to kill our other dog, I
had her destroyed. I couldn't afford to have this dog around with
people, let alone small children. She was socialized but something
snapped. Marjorie Knoller and Robert Noel should have recognized
this. It was their own fault. They were unprepared, untrained and
uneducated on how to have control over such dogs.</LD>

<TE>   In response to the dog-mauling verdict, a letter writer suggests
that the Legislature pass laws outlawing certain breeds. His is a
predictable but ridiculous reaction. We don't outlaw whole groups of
people because one of their number commits a murder. That's common
sense. We don't restrict SUVs, even though the evidence is clear that
they waste fuel, pollute disproportionately and are lethal to the
occupants of standard vehicles involved in collisions with them.
That's a matter of choice. Some are too eager to restrict the rights
and freedoms of others in a flawed pursuit of personal safety.</TE>
<TE>   There will always be those who wish to stoke their machismo,
compensate for their sense of impotence or create a better gladiator.
Outlawing pit bulls or Presa Canarios will only give rise to another
breed engineered for violence. But it is the owner who controls, or
fails to control, an aggressive dog and who has the responsibility
for the dog's actions. Outlawing breeds would be futile, burden
responsible owners and marginalize a majority of fine animals.</TE>

<TE>   The breed of dog, Presa Canario, that killed Diane Whipple, is not
a pet. It is a mix of bull mastiffs, Staffordshire bull terrier, pit
bulls and Dogue de Bordeaux, an ancient breed (still bred) related to
the Molossian mastiff, favored by gladiators.</TE>
<TE>   They were often pitted against lions, bears, etc. for sport. The
Presa Canario, in its present form, was used as a fighting dog--not
for betting, but for the purpose of weeding out the weak, to create a
more fearsome creature or, as breeders say, "more stout of heart and
courageous."</TE>
<TE>   The animal should be banned, as in Denmark, Sweden, Britain and
Italy, where pit bulls, Staffordshire and Dogo Argentino have been
illegal since 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Until local and state governments in the U.S. are held accountable
for dogs that maim and kill, we will continue to think twice about
walking down unfamiliar neighborhood lanes.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   My feeling is that common sense shows us that there are several
dog breeds that are particularly aggressive and have a violent, evil
streak within them.</TE>
<TE>   I refer especially to pit bulls and the Rottweilers, which we have
seen over and over again are responsible for more devastating attacks
than any average breed. While I do believe that the way they are
raised makes some difference, it does not eliminate that natural
inbred tendency to attack.</TE>
<TE>   I do feel the right decision was made to convict the owners of the
dog that killed Diane Whipple, as they clearly knew the nature of
their pets, and yet they were more or less confined within a
residential building ripe for such horrific attacks. They need to be
held accountable for the actions of their dogs on all counts.</TE>

<LD>Re "Roots of Mideast Crisis Span the Globe," Commentary, March 26:
Mohammad Tarbush is wrong when he calls the idea that "Judaism is a
nationality as well as a religion" an "anachronistic Zionist idea."
It is, rather, a fundamental truth about the Jewish people, many of
whom are nonbelievers.</LD>
<LD>   Particularly in the 20th century, Jews have been defined as
persecuted not by their religious beliefs but by their ethnicity.
Ironically, it is the Palestinians who are clearly not a people.</LD>
<LD>   They are, in fact, indistinguishable in culture, religion,
language, cuisine, dress, appearance, etc., from Jordanians and other
neighboring Arabs. Their "peoplehood" is an artificial creation
cynically invented for political purposes.</LD>
<TE>   Even if one accepts that a Palestinian national identity is now a
fact, one may ask how long their struggle to return to their homeland
will remain a just cause. I am sure that Tarbush would argue that the
Palestinians will never give up their claims to their former homes.
In that case, why deny the Jews the right to return to their homeland
after only 2,000 years of exile? That is the real double standard in
the Middle East.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The history of the Palestinian debacle has been grossly and
maliciously distorted in the Arab world. First, in September 1972,
King Hussein of Jordan conducted a war of extermination against the
Palestinians, forcing Arafat, the PLO and numerous ordinary
Palestinians to flee into neighboring Lebanon.</TE>
<TE>   From the creation of the Hashemite family Kingdom of Transjordan
by the British in the aftermath of World War I, to 1967, Jordan owned
the West Bank. Not one Israeli settlement or one Israeli citizen
existed on that land during that period. Why was no Palestinian state
created by the Hashemites and why was the Arab world not outraged by
the Jordanian occupation of historic Palestine?</TE>
<TE>   Second, during Israel's war in Lebanon in the early 1980s, the
Syrian-sponsored Palestinian Amal militias waged war on Arafat and
the PLO, killing hundreds of their fellow Palestinians in the cause
of Greater Syria. To this day, Syrian troops occupy Lebanon's Bekka
Valley and control the Lebanese government. Where's the outrage in
the Arab world over that double injustice?</TE>
<TE>   Leopold Rosenfeld</TE>
<TE>   Beverly Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   How very typical of Tarbush to assign the blame for the crisis in
the Middle East to everyone except the Arabs. It's the fault of those
horrid British who assigned a sliver of land to the Jews in 1917, and
the awful French who "promoted illegal immigration," and Germany and
Russia and European and American intellectuals, etc., ad nauseam.</TE>
<TE>   In the process, Tarbush denies a Jewish national identity, assigns
a historical nationality to the Palestinians, who never had such an
identity until 1967, and in general plays fast and loose with both
morality and history. He ignores the 1920s Arab pre-statehood
pogroms, the massive expulsions of Jews from Arab countries and the
54 years of Arab military attacks.</TE>
<TE>   By playing the perennial victim and by using outright
prevarications to prove his supposed victimhood, Tarbush may assuage
some inner pathology, but he does the Palestinian cause, which is
badly in need of self-examination, no good whatsoever.</TE>

<TE>   Crown Prince Abdullah's initiative fell short of reckoning the
Palestinian catastrophe. Predictably, it will gain support in the
Arab summit in Beirut, but it will fail to materialize into real
success.</TE>
<TE>   A peace plan in the Middle East would work only when the United
States and the rest of the international community pressure the
Israelis and the Palestinians equally into implementing the United
Nations resolutions and financially compensate the Palestinians for
the loss of their properties, lives and all the devastations they've
endured.</TE>

<TE>   Re "The Only Hope for Peace," Opinion, March 24: We welcome the
underlying sentiment of the coming together of both Arab and Jewish
Americans in support of an end to the violence and bloodshed in the
Middle East. However, the unified message expressed by George Salem
and Marvin Lender fails to mention the Tenet report, which calls for
a cessation of violence as the prerequisite for the Mitchell plan.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line is that Arab American groups need to speak out
against all terrorism, including Palestinian suicide bombers. The
arsonist and the firefighter are not morally equivalent; neither are
the Palestinian suicide bombers and the Israeli response to them.</TE>

<HD>Cantor Brings Joy to an Old Tradition</HD>
<DH>Yonah Kliger of Temple Emanuel in Beverly Hills uses a warm
and welcoming style to teach about his faith and transmit a passion
for Jewishness.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA RICHARDSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"How do we show the Torah we love it?" asks Yonah Kliger, the
youthful cantor at Temple Emanuel in Beverly Hills.</LD>
<LD>   The 20 or so tots in the preschool session consider the large
scroll cradled in Kliger's arms. They answer as if it were a new baby
brother.</LD>
<LD>   "You don't slap it?" one suggests.</LD>
<TE>   This is not quite the answer Kliger is looking for, yet it is
technically accurate, so he says, "That's absolutely right!"</TE>
<TE>   Sure of themselves now, the other children jump in: "You don't
kick it?--You don't push it?--We don't bite it?"</TE>
<TE>   Yep, they're all correct, the cantor says. "I'm glad you all
remember how to show the Torah we love it," he says with a smile. The
children, age 2 to 4, are terribly pleased with themselves for
getting it right.</TE>
<TE>   As Kliger looks out on the small faces singing in Hebrew and
clapping along with him as they wriggle in their parents' arms, he
sees himself. He grew up at this temple, attending the day school,
Sabbath services, high holy days and celebrating his bar mitzvah.
Then, six years ago, at age 24, he became a rarity: a cantor helping
to lead a congregation that remembers him as a child.</TE>
<TE>   Kliger, a compact man who wears his chestnut hair in a ponytail,
attended Temple Emanuel's religious school up to age 15 and then
taught in the school throughout his four years at UCLA. He even
hosted his own wedding there three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   As a boy, he was torn between musical theater and a career as a
cantor. He says he was swayed one night at 15. On the eve of Yom
Kippur, the Jewish day of atonement, he was singing a prayer before
the congregation.</TE>
<TE>   In his office, which has a piano and conga drums, he sings the
first phrases of that prayer, the Kol Nidre. His tenor voice rises
softly.</TE>
<TE>   "Let all our vows today, all the promises we made and the
obligations be null and void should we, after honest effort, find
ourselves unable to fulfill them," he reads from a translation after
he is done.</TE>
<TE>   Historically, because Jews considered themselves bound by any
vow--even one made under duress--the Kol Nidre brought comfort to
those forced by the Inquisition to convert to Christianity.</TE>
<TE>   "I think before that night I didn't really understand its
significance, its beauty," Kliger said. "I was singing, and I felt
this connection with the congregation on a completely different
level."</TE>
<TE>   Recognizing that not all Jews will be moved by solemn classical
liturgy, Kliger spearheaded a service dubbed "Shabbat Unplugged,"
named for MTV's live acoustic performances. The laid-back format has
modern music and encourages far more participation from the
congregation than standard services. The service draws a
standing-room-only crowd of about 300 younger Jews on the fourth
Friday of each month.</TE>
<TE>   One of them is Matt Roberts, 30, who is not a member of Temple
Emanuel but does pro bono public relations work for it. His sense of
Judaism is more cultural than religious, he said, and Kliger's style
appeals to him.</TE>
<TE>   "I grew up in a more conservative Jewish congregation, and as I
got older, I started coming here more and more," Roberts said. "At
the Friday night services, that's as close as I get to a feeling of
spirituality."</TE>
<TE>   Kliger says it is not his role to lead people like Roberts to God,
but to simply accept people wherever they are on a spiritual path. "I
think that's a very personal journey everyone makes individually. I
try to instill a real sense of joy and family in the Judaism I
present."</TE>
<TE>   Kliger's mother, Marian Kliger, says she is awestruck by her son.
"I could tell you the stereotypical things about being proud, but
it's more profound than that," she says. Watching him singing to the
congregation, "when he's just totally lost and he closes his eyes ...
there are moments when I can hear the sob in his voice, and it's so
old and he's so young.... Then I remember carrying him, and I start
crying."</TE>
<TE>   Technically, a cantor's job is the interpretation of liturgy
utilizing sacred music. Cantors also teach, preparing children to
enter adulthood at the bar mitzvah or bat mitzvah ceremony. The job
also calls for spiritual virtuosity; it is the cantor's voice, manner
and soulfulness that invite the congregation to merge with a prayer.</TE>
<TE>   More than 500 generations have passed since cantors in Europe left
their seats amid the congregation to sing a prayer or two--and then
swept and cleaned the synagogue after worship, said Scott Colbert,
executive vice president of the American Conference of Cantors.</TE>
<TE>   The art of the cantor became more formalized 250 to 300 years ago,
and professional cantors gained prominence during the 19th century.</TE>
<TE>   "The cantor is not a minister of music; he or she is a full
partner in bringing people to God," Colbert said.</TE>
<TE>   It was also the cantor's job to bring secular folk music to the
Jewish community.</TE>
<TE>   "For centuries, Jews have been enclosed within walls and were
separated from the mainstream," Colbert said. "So the cantor was
someone who, with his incredible music talent, could bring the world
of secular music inside."</TE>
<TE>   In the United States, the period of great cantors endured through
the 1930s. Stars were technically brilliant with impressive voices
and a deep knowledge of the Torah. A promising student studied with
the greats--the late Joseph Rosenblatt or Mordechai Hershman of New
York, Pierre Pinchik or the Koussevitsky brothers, Colbert said.</TE>
<TE>   The Holocaust, however, almost destroyed the Eastern European
cantorial tradition. Many of the great cantors perished in
concentration camps, and their loss jeopardized what had largely been
an oral tradition. But in 1948, Hebrew Union College Jewish Institute
of Religion founded the School of Sacred Music, helping to revive the
tradition. Today, there are about 1,000 cantors nationwide, Colbert
said.</TE>
<TE>   For Marian Kliger, the Holocaust left her wrestling with how to
raise an observant Jewish child who asked baffling questions about
God. "Being a grandchild of Holocaust survivors, Yonah would see the
numbers on their arms and ask, 'How could God let that happen to
you?'" she said. "So it was difficult. I didn't intellectualize God
to him, I left it that God is a part of everything--it was just a
given."</TE>
<TE>   Today, Kliger says his mission is to transmit a joy and passion
for Jewishness. His style is warm and welcoming, a modern approach to
an ancient tradition.</TE>
<TE>   "Traditional cantors were trained in a style of music and in a
vision of a liturgy where the cantor was the [sole] representative of
the community before God," said Laura Geller, Temple Emanuel's rabbi.
"He would sing and people would respond, 'Omein!'"</TE>
<TE>   But younger American Jews have a variety of musical experiences to
draw upon, and a spiritual shift has taken place among more liberal
congregations, Geller said. "I grew up in a synagogue where the choir
was hidden, and as a little girl I only heard the voices; I thought
they were angels. But that wouldn't work now."</TE>
<TE>   As temple architecture has become less soaring and majestic and
more intimate and serviceable, reflecting cultural changes, Geller
said, so too has the style of prayer. "The dominant metaphor now is
not that of God soaring above a congregation," she said, "but of God
living within."</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the preschool session, Kliger reminds the children
that the Torah is delicate. In addition to never kicking or biting
one, it is not to be touched with fingers.</TE>
<TE>   "What we do is we give it a big kiss in our hands, hold the kiss
tight, then let it out at the Torah," he says, showing them.</TE>
<TE>   So they do, giving their hands long, sometimes wet kisses and
balling up little fists. Kliger sits down on a stool, and the
children walk past, opening their hands wide to release the kiss,
fingertips hovering very near, but never actually touching the Torah.</TE>

<HD>Visit by Virgin Mary Is a Promising Premise That Goes
Unfulfilled</HD>
<DH>"OUR LADY OF THE LOST AND FOUND" By Diane Schoemperlen;
Viking, 349 pages, $24.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I wanted to love this novel, I really did. I fell head over heels for
the book's brilliant set-up: a middle-aged writer, living a quiet
life in an undisclosed city, is visited by the Virgin Mary. The
unmarried narrator, though not the religious sort, immediately
recognizes the Mother of God for who she is and invites her to stay
for the week.</LD>
<LD>   The premise is high-concept enough that you begin to wonder, after
the first few pages, who will play Mary in the film. I was thinking
Meryl Streep. And maybe Sissy Spacek as the novelist.</LD>
<LD>   "It strikes me now as the ultimate testament to the power of her
presence that I had not a doubt in my mind about her reality, not
then and not since," she writes. "I knew from the very beginning that
it was really her: Mary, Mother of God, Queen of Heaven, Our Lady of
the Angels."</LD>
<TE>   At this point, you begin to think about the juicy possibilities
that surely await further along in the book. For instance, what does
Mary--one of the best known and most beloved women in history--have
to say about Jesus and Joseph, unanswered prayers and miracles,
angels and the devil, heaven and hell, asking her son to turn water
into wine and watching him die on a cross? Thumbing through the book,
you wonder how Schoemperlen--a Canadian novelist who is not Roman
Catholic--was going to pack it all into 349 pages.</TE>
<TE>   Sadly, she doesn't try. At least not in any direct fashion. Those
questions--or any others of significance--go unasked while Mary and
the novelist together make meals, walk the neighborhood, shop at the
mall and watch the evening news.</TE>
<TE>   Early on, the narrator even apologizes for the mundane questions
("Are you not fond of olives?") that she asks Mary:</TE>
<TE>   "It has been my experience that if you ask too many questions too
soon, [the interview subjects] have a tendency to clam up and say
nothing. But if you just let them talk, eventually they will tell you
everything you want or need to know."</TE>
<TE>   But Mary never opens up. Which leaves you, chapter after chapter,
wanting to dive into the book, push the narrator aside, and yell,
"OK, enough about the waffles! Mary, who ends up in heaven?"</TE>
<TE>   The narrator grapples with some lofty issues best left for
academics: for example, the nature of history and time and the
intersection of physics and theology. For a few, the book's premise
may be a perfect spark to detail Werner Heisenberg's uncertainty
principle. But I just didn't get it. Especially because the narrator
could have stopped her internal noodling and just asked the Mother of
God--who was seated right next to her!</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Mary wants to remain a mystery, which could be one of the
book's points that I missed between the explanation of "wave-particle
duality of light" and the philosophy of Heraclitus.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the book has its charms. Mary, a person most of us know
only from statues, paintings and the few Gospel verses in which she
is mentioned, walks into our world, carrying with her a pair of
running shoes and a good sense of humor. She uses the bathroom, needs
naps and gets money out of an ATM. (Of course, the narrator doesn't
ask her about the bank account.)</TE>
<TE>   Her first words to the startled novelist, "Fear not," echo the
angel Gabriel's first words to Mary. And the book's structure is
inventive: a novelist fictionalizing her real-life experience with
Mary. The writer promises to keep many details of the miraculous
visit a secret--both because Mary has requested it and the fear of
millions of pilgrims flocking to her house if word leaked out.</TE>
<TE>   So the narrator tells the reader with a wink that "this is a work
of fiction," and is careful not to give her name or the name of her
city, saying only that "it is a medium-sized city in the western
hemisphere on the northern shore of a large lake."</TE>
<TE>   The book also provides a healthy dose of Marian history,
concentrating mostly on the apparitions in the last 2,000 years.
There are plenty to choose from--20,000 by some counts. But the book
stays with some of the most famous: Mary's visits to St. Ignatius of
Loyola, St. Teresa of Avila, and Juan Diego in what is now Mexico
City.</TE>
<TE>   But Mary doesn't give us many insider details about her visits,
sticking mostly with straightforward accounts that can be found in
Catholic bookstores. The narrator fills in the holes with research
she did after Mary left.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, we learn much more about the writer--and her struggle
toward a life of faith--than about the Virgin Mary. Which is a
problem when you have mysterious and glorious Mary as a prominent
character in your book.</TE>
<TE>   It's like standing at the base of Mt. Everest with Sir Edmund
Hillary by your side and not taking one step toward the summit.</TE>

<HD>Roman Catholicism Finds Converts Even During Current Time
of Crisis</HD>
<DH>Religion: Hundreds in Boston will join the church during a
service tonight. Some believe that their commitment despite sex-abuse
scandal is a triumph of faith.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Megan Denell's search for a spiritual home brought her to the doors
of the Roman Catholic Church, where she found a strength of community
like nothing she had experienced.</LD>
<LD>   It wasn't long before she learned that her new fellowship came
with pain as well as joy.</LD>
<LD>   The sex-abuse scandal in the Boston Archdiocese--in which some
church officials have admitted they did little to stop priests
accused of molesting minors--erupted just as Denell took steps to
become a Catholic.</LD>
<TE>   Yet despite a stomach-churning reaction to the crisis, Denell and
hundreds of others in Boston still feel the strong pull of faith and
plan to convert to Catholicism during an Easter vigil service
tonight.</TE>
<TE>   They'll be baptized, confirmed and receive the Eucharist, the
culmination of months of study for the Rite of Catholic Initiation of
Adults, which prepares non-Catholics to become members of the church.
The program includes education about the church's history, its
rituals and the principles behind the faith.</TE>
<TE>   Denell, a 26-year-old administrator for a local arts foundation,
said she's come to realize that the church is much greater than some
flawed people who have helped run it. Those tainted leaders include
Cardinal Bernard Law, who has faced calls for his resignation in the
wake of the scandal.</TE>
<TE>   "The cardinal is not the essence of the church," she said. "The
essence of the church is Christ. The essence of the church are the
people who are there."</TE>
<TE>   Church officials say participation in the adult initiation program
has remained steady even during the sex-abuse scandal. This spring,
713 people are taking part.</TE>
<TE>   Don Schroeder, 33, grew up surrounded by the Catholic Church.
Raised a Presbyterian, he attended a Jesuit high school while growing
up in Lyndhurst, N.J., and then went to Holy Cross College in
Worcester, where he was on that Jesuit school's executive board of
campus ministry.</TE>
<TE>   After college, the strictures of the Catholic Church and his own
ambitions as an attorney turned his focus away from religion. But the
birth of his first child, combined with the death of a friend in the
Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center, sparked reflection that
led him to Catholicism. Last fall, he started a Catholic initiation
program at Boston College.</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder was disgusted by revelations of how church officials
shuttled defrocked priest John Geoghan from parish to parish, even
though he'd been accused of sexually abusing children. And he
believes Law should resign for his role in the Geoghan transfers and
his handling of the crisis.</TE>
<TE>   But Schroeder has not wavered in his decision to become a
Catholic.</TE>
<TE>   "These aren't things that are going to dissuade me from following
through," he said. "The ties I've formed through my upbringing and my
adulthood are just too strong."</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Bob VerEecke, who leads the initiation class at St.
Ignatius in Newton, Mass., said the commitment of the new converts
has been valuable to him at a time when he and other priests feel
pain and discouragement.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of people who are just so angry, they don't want
anything to do with the official church, and that's hard," he said.
"To have people who are affirming of the process and who I am as a
priest is very comforting."</TE>
<TE>   Catholicism has survived other dark times over the centuries, and
the people who join the church this weekend are a sign of its
continuing perseverance, said Tammy Liddell, a lay campus minister at
Boston College.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it makes a statement that our faith is bigger than
anything that can happen and anything that can go wrong," she said.</TE>
<TE>   People joining the church now have few illusions about its
problems, Denell said. She's learned that the church and its leaders
are not infallible. But she's been impressed by the honest
soul-searching she's seen in the leaders in her Catholic community,
she said.</TE>
<TE>   In a way, Denell said, this is a good time to join the church
because it is on the cusp of change that can make it stronger. And
she can be part of it.</TE>
<TE>   "While it's a painful time, it's a really exciting time," Denell
said. "I feel as though the people are going to go forward and say,
'We need change.' I feel hopeful about the future."</TE>

<HD>Hugh D. Graham, 65; Scholar Challenged Bush on Records</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hugh Davis Graham, a Vanderbilt University political historian who
spearheaded a lawsuit to block President Bush's reinterpretation of a
law on the release of White House records, has died. He was 65.</LD>
<LD>   Graham, a highly regarded scholar of civil rights policy and a
Pulitzer Prize-nominated author, died of cancer Tuesday at his home
in Santa Barbara.</LD>
<LD>   In November, he and a group of other historians and journalists
asked a federal judge to strike down Bush's executive order that
gives an incumbent president or a former president's representative
the right to withhold the release of their presidential papers to the
public. The order also extends to "vice presidential records."</LD>
<TE>   Immediately at issue were 68,000 pages of "confidential
communications" from President Reagan's White House.</TE>
<TE>   Graham and his fellow plaintiffs argued that Bush's executive
order violated the 1978 Presidential Records Act, which was passed by
Congress to make clear that a president's papers and files are the
government's property.</TE>
<TE>   The measure was enacted in the wake of Watergate and President
Nixon's efforts to control access to his papers and secret White
House tapes.</TE>
<TE>   The law, which took effect in 1981, said most of a former
president's papers would be available to the public 12 years after
the chief executive left office.</TE>
<TE>   A White House spokeswoman in November described Bush's executive
order as "establishing an orderly process" for implementing the 1978
law.</TE>
<TE>   "Bush's order is wrongheaded and dangerous on many counts," Graham
told an audience at the Lyndon Johnson Presidential Library in
Austin, Texas, in November. "It attempts to change a public law not
by persuading Congress to revise it, but by executive decree. It is
disingenuous, turning the statute on its head, displacing a premise
of eventual openness with a license for permanent closure."</TE>
<TE>   In January, a year after they were scheduled to be made public,
8,000 pages of Reagan presidency documents were unveiled at the
Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, including memos
from Chief of Staff James A. Baker III. An additional 60,000 pages
that were to be released in January 2001 are expected to become
available in early April.</TE>
<TE>   Graham viewed the release of the Reagan papers as a mere public
relations ploy to curb criticism over Bush's executive order.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a gesture so that they can say, 'See, we're good guys, we're
producing these documents and everyone can come look at them,'"
Graham said in January. "They're trying to get the monkey off their
back. But it's not going to get us off their backs."</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit, filed in Washington on behalf of the American
Historical Assn., the Organization of American Historians, the
National Security Archive and the Reporters Committee for Freedom of
the Press, in addition to Graham and Stanley I. Kutler of the
University of Wisconsin, is pending.</TE>
<TE>   A native of Little Rock, Ark., Graham graduated magna cum laude
from Yale University in 1958 and later received his master's and PhD
from Stanford University.</TE>
<TE>   After a two-year stint in the Marine Corps on Okinawa, Graham
worked briefly as a reporter for the Tennessean in Nashville in 1960
then taught history at Foothill College in Los Altos Hills, Calif.,
and at San Jose State College (now University).</TE>
<TE>   From 1964 to 1966, he worked in the Peace Corps in Washington,
first in the Office of Public Affairs and then as director of the
Western region. He later taught history at Stanford, Johns Hopkins
University in Baltimore and the University of Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   Graham began teaching at Vanderbilt in Nashville in 1991, but he
moved to Santa Barbara early last year after his illness rendered him
unable to teach.</TE>
<TE>   He continued to write, however, and finished his final book,
"Collision Course: The Strange Convergence of Affirmative Action and
Immigration Policy in America," which has just been published by
Oxford University Press.</TE>
<TE>   Graham wrote or edited 15 books, mostly dealing with U.S. policy
issues in the second half of the 20th century.</TE>
<TE>   He was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in history in 1991 for
"The Civil Rights Era: Origins and Development of National Policy,
1960-1972."</TE>
<TE>   This week, an academic conference on Reagan's presidency that
Graham helped organize was held at UC Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   Graham is survived by his wife, Janet; two brothers, Court TV
anchor Fred Graham of Washington and historian Otis L. Graham Jr. of
Wilmington, N.C.; and his son, Holter Graham of Baltimore. Another
son, Hugh Patterson Graham, died in 1977 at age 8.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service will be held later at Vanderbilt.</TE>

<HD>Monks Protest Proposal for a Firing Range Next Door</HD>
<DH>Religion: Benedictines say police gunfire would disrupt
their quiet lifestyle. The department says other options are
impractical.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>OCEANSIDE</DL>
<LD>Benedictine monks here are protesting a plan by the Police Department
to build an outdoor firing range next door to the contemplative
order's Prince of Peace Abbey.</LD>
<LD>   Abbot Charles Wright, who heads the abbey, says the constant
rat-a-tat-tat will destroy an ingredient essential to the monks' life
of prayer and devotion to God: silence.</LD>
<LD>   "Silence invites us to transcend this world," Wright said. "Our
whole way of life would be disrupted by a firing range. We would hear
every shot, particularly when they start using automatic weapons."</LD>
<TE>   The firing range would be within 2,500 feet of the abbey, down a
hill in what is known as Wire Mountain. Wright is concerned that to
help pay the cost of construction the city would open the range to
other police agencies, which would make for even more noise.</TE>
<TE>   Police officials acknowledge that possibility. But they insist
that berms and fences would muffle the noise to a level below what is
acceptable under the city's noise ordinance.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have anything against the monks," said Officer Rich
Davis, the range master. "They have their views; we have our needs.
It's not a luxury. For the safety of the public and our own officers,
we have to train with firearms."</TE>
<TE>   The 170-officer department lost its lease on a firing range
several miles away. The owner wants to develop the property, and has
given the police until October to leave.</TE>
<TE>   The Planning Commission sided 7 to 0 with the police over the
monks. The monks have appealed to the City Council, and are employing
a two-prong strategy.</TE>
<TE>   First, they are praying that the council will overturn the
commission. If that fails, the abbey has retained a lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   "We're new to politics," said Wright.</TE>
<TE>   City officials like the site near the abbey because it is already
owned by the city. The city has received a $150,000 federal
construction grant toward the estimated $900,000 cost. The range
would be open seven days a week, 7 a.m. to 10 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Founded by the Catholic Church in 1958, the abbey sits on 130
acres of lush hillside property in the city's San Luis Rey Valley,
bounded on the north by Camp Pendleton.</TE>
<TE>   On a clear day, the 25 monks have a panoramic view of the Pacific
Ocean, from San Diego's Mt. Soledad on the south to Catalina Island
on the north.</TE>
<TE>   Wright notes that the monks have no beef with the Police
Department, nor any objection to firearms training. The monks allowed
the police to put a communications tower at the abbey and to use the
abbey as a command post during Y2K planning.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, relations between the monks and the Marines at Camp
Pendleton are good, said Wright, who served in the Army before
joining the religious life and has been an auxiliary chaplain.</TE>
<TE>   "We think of ourselves as the prince of peace but that does not
make the Marines into the prince of war," Wright said. "We prefer to
think of them as the neighbors who handle their problems differently
than we do."</TE>
<TE>   Wright, 66, who has been at the abbey since 1964, believes the
institution may be paying a price for having been so quiet, so
other-worldly in the past.</TE>
<TE>   Public officials, he said, seem unaware that the abbey plays host
to thousands of people each year who attend retreats and conferences,
and that the facility is the collection spot for a daily delivery of
food to the poor of Tijuana.</TE>
<TE>   "We've kept such a low profile, they really don't know what we
have up here," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Once accepted into the order, the monks remain for life. They make
their own plywood coffins, and 10 are buried in the abbey cemetery.</TE>
<TE>   "Death is not scary to us," Wright said. "We know it's what we're
here for. 'Nobody gets out of this life alive,' as Brother Benno used
to say." Brother Benno, noted for his work feeding the poor, died in
1992.</TE>
<TE>   Life in the abbey is not bound by a vow of silence, though the
monks spend their days in study--the abbey has a library of 40,000
books on religious topics--and prayer. Six times daily the
monks--ranging in age from 24 to 94--gather for prayer. Each has
chores tending the property and its 17 buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Some meals are taken in silence, though sometimes a monk reads
aloud from a book considered uplifting.</TE>
<TE>   They believe the Oceanside police should do their firing at ranges
at Camp Pendleton. Indeed, 56 state, federal and local
law-enforcement agencies use those ranges, according to base
officials.</TE>
<TE>   But Oceanside police say the long drive to the Marine ranges and
the uncertainty of scheduling make that impractical. Officers need to
be close to the city to respond to emergencies, Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   "If we only shot once or twice a year, [Camp Pendleton] might be
something we could look at," Davis said. "But it just doesn't work
out. The monks have to understand that."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Gen. Tikka Khan, 87, the former chief of the Pakistani army who was
once called the "Butcher of Bengal" for his ruthless crackdown on
separatists in what became Bangladesh, died Thursday in Islamabad
after a lengthy illness.</LD>
<LD>   Khan was military commander in East Pakistan in 1971, when
military ruler Gen. Yahya Khan ordered a crackdown against ethnic
Bengali separatists led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.</LD>
<LD>   Khan's tactics won him the nickname "Butcher of Bengal" among
Bengalis before he was removed from his command a few months later.</LD>
<TE>   India came to the defense of the Bengali separatists, and war
broke out Dec. 3, 1971. Pakistan surrendered in the east 12 days
later, and Rahman became the first prime minister of an independent
Bangladesh, as East Pakistan was renamed.</TE>
<TE>   After Pakistan's defeat, Khan was appointed army chief and defense
minister by Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. In the late 1980s,
Khan served as secretary general of Benazir Bhutto's Pakistan
People's Party.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Kenneth Wolstenholme, 81, the TV announcer who made the most famous
call in English soccer history, died of heart failure Monday at a
hospital in the Devonshire town of Torquay.</LD>
<LD>   Wolstenholme's words when England beat Germany in the 1966 World
Cup final--"They think it's all over.... It is now"--are as resonant
to English sports fans as Al Michaels' remark "Do you believe in
miracles? Yes!" at the end of the U.S.-Soviet hockey game at the 1980
Lake Placid Olympics is to Americans.</LD>
<LD>   With England leading Germany 3-2 in the closing minutes at Wembley
Stadium, many fans started celebrating.</LD>
<TE>   Just as Wolstenholme told his BBC-TV audience, "Some people are on
the pitch; they think it's all over," England's Geoff Hurst scored
his third goal of the game to make it 4-2, and Wolstenholme added in
the next breath, "It is now."</TE>
<TE>   Wolstenholme's phrase became part of the English lexicon. It was
the title of a sports quiz show, and has been used to advertise
everything from dog food to stationery.</TE>

<LD>CHATTANOOGA, Tenn.--The Ten Commandments plaque in the Hamilton
County courthouse is serving as the backdrop for a makeshift wedding
chapel.</LD>
<LD>   There's no precise figure on the number of couples exchanging vows
near the plaque since it was posted Dec. 18, but it has become a
popular location.</LD>
<LD>   "It is the preferred spot for couples to exchange vows," said Mark
Sandilands, pastor of the Power of Touch Church, who performs
courthouse weddings.</LD>
<TE>   Last fall, Hamilton County commissioners decided to display the
commandments in the courthouse and two other county buildings. Their
presence will be challenged in U.S. District Court on April 29 by the
American Civil Liberties Union, which considers them a violation of
church-state separation.</TE>
<TE>   Rutherford County is the 10th Tennessee county to authorize Ten
Commandments displays.</TE>

<LD>PHILADELPHIA--Early evidence shows religiously based social service
programs might be more effective than secular ones, but studies have
been few and their methods uneven, a University of Pennsylvania
survey concluded.</LD>
<LD>   A review of about 100 studies on faith-based efforts such as
rehabilitation for prison inmates showed somewhat better success
rates than other nonreligious programs.</LD>
<LD>   "The early returns look quite positive," said chief researcher
Byron R. Johnson of Penn's Center for Research on Religion and Urban
Civil Society. The report said more research is needed before making
any conclusions.</LD>
<TE>   A separate review of 670 studies found overwhelming evidence that
people who worship regularly have lower rates of depression, drug and
alcohol abuse, suicide, nonmarital childbearing and other health and
social woes.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>GREAT FALLS, Mont.--Attorneys for Alan Reavley say they'll fight
prosecutors' attempts to use his comments at a Roman Catholic retreat
to convict Reavley of a double murder 37 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Such comments are privileged and confidential, just as a
confession to a priest is confidential, defense attorney Jeff Sutton
said.</LD>
<LD>   Cascade County Atty. Brant Light says courts should hear witness
reports that Reavley broke down crying at a 1994 retreat and said he
had once "killed some people" as a young man.</LD>
<TE>   Light believes those people were Jim and Lois Arrotta, who were
stabbed to death in a bungled 1964 burglary. Sutton said Reavley
denies any involvement in the crime.</TE>
<TE>   Great Falls detectives questioned 200 participants in Catholic
retreats that Reavley attended.</TE>
<TE>   Confidentiality in retreats is important, said the Rev. Jay
Peterson, vicar general of the local Catholic diocese. However, the
diocese didn't hesitate when police detectives asked for names of
participants at Cursillo retreats over the last decade or so,
Peterson said.</TE>

<LD>LAIE, Hawaii--Oscar-winning director Kieth Merrill didn't film his
spectacular mini-epic about Jesus Christ appearing in ancient America
for commercial success, he said, but to present a distinctive belief
of his Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</LD>
<LD>   Free showings of the 65-minute "The Testaments: Of One Fold and
One Shepherd," shot mostly on Kauai, began at the church's Polynesian
Cultural Center this week. It already is being shown at Mormon
visitors centers in Salt Lake City and suburban Washington, D.C.</LD>
<LD>   According to the faith's Book of Mormon, Jews migrated to the New
World centuries before Jesus Christ and taught the same beliefs, then
Jesus himself came to minister after his resurrection.</LD>
<TE>   Merrill said he believes those events are true, though he used
invented characters and composites in the film version. Church
President Gordon B. Hinckley had final approval of the script.</TE>

<LD>GAYA, India--Nearly 250 Buddhist monks ended a two-day siege of a
shrine in India after the local government pledged to consider their
demand for Buddhist control of the site.</LD>
<LD>   The Mahabodhi temple in Bodh Gaya, Bihar state, is where Buddha is
said to have attained enlightenment. It is managed by a nine-member
panel of five Hindus and four Buddhists under a 1949 state law that
says a Hindu must chair the panel.</LD>
<LD>   Many Hindus believe Buddha was an incarnation of Vishnu, the Hindu
god of preservation, and Hindus also worship at the site. Vishwa
Hindu Parishad, the hard-line group widely blamed for recent
Hindu-Muslim riots in western India, demands a stake in the shrine.</LD>
<TE>   The Buddhist protesters say their religion has no links with
Hinduism. Buddhists comprise less than 1% of India's 1 billion-plus
people.</TE>

<LD>NEW YORK--A dispute in the United States' Greek Orthodox Archdiocese
over the way it is governed was worsened when parishes were given
just two weeks to respond to a proposed new charter.</LD>
<LD>   The touchiest issue is whether U.S. Greeks should gain more
autonomy from the Ecumenical Patriarch in Istanbul, Turkey,
especially in choosing bishops.</LD>
<LD>   Under the proposed charter, the Istanbul patriarchate would
continue to name all U.S. bishops. The U.S. bishops' synod and the
Archdiocesan Council, which includes priests and lay delegates, would
have an undefined advisory role in Istanbul's choice of the head
archbishop. With other bishop appointments, the synod would consult
the council and submit three nominees to Istanbul.</LD>
<TE>   However, U.S. Greek negotiators wanted Istanbul to choose future
archbishops from three nominees sent by the U.S. synod after
consultation with the Archdiocesan Council. The U.S. synod would
elect other bishops.</TE>
<TE>   The debate was reported by the Greek press and Orthodox Christian
News Service, a Web site.</TE>

<LD>NAUVOO, Ill.--Mormon hotelier and farmer William H. Walker heeded the
call more than 150 years ago, devoting one day in every 10 to
building a grand temple envisioned as the spiritual home of his
fledgling religion.</LD>
<LD>   Less than a decade later, that temple lay in ruins--ravaged by
fire and storm after persecution forced the Mormons to abandon the
city they carved in the Mississippi River wilderness.</LD>
<LD>   Today, great-grandson and hotelier Kay Walker spends one morning a
week on the same high river bluff, helping rebuild the temple. The
work is almost complete. The temple is due to be dedicated at the end
of June, following a six-week-long open house.</LD>

65,000-square-foot temple; the spire reaches more than 160 feet into

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Choreographer Rod Rodgers, an important transitional figure in the
history of African American concert dance, has died. He was 64.</LD>
<LD>   Rogers died Sunday in a Manhattan hospital of complications from a
stroke.</LD>
<LD>   Honored in January by the International Assn. of Blacks in Dance,
Rogers belonged to a generation of artists equally at home creating
black-identified work and pieces that explored the themes and styles
(including abstraction) popular with his nonblack colleagues.</LD>
<TE>   "It is simply a question of what is more important," he told the
Negro Digest in 1968, "my total living experiences or those
experiences which I consider particularly relevant to my blackness."</TE>
<TE>   Rodgers was born in Cleveland and grew up in Detroit, learning tap
and jazz dance at an early age. Later, he performed in clubs and
resorts while studying with teachers who had trained with such black
dance pioneers as Katherine Dunham and Pearl Primus.</TE>
<TE>   In 1962, he moved to New York City, where he studied with such
modern dance luminaries as Erick Hawkins and Charles Weidman before
forming a racially mixed company in 1966.</TE>
<TE>   From the first, Rodgers' choreography bridged the gap between the
black traditions that Dunham and Primus had introduced into concert
dance and the very different modern dance world that Hawkins and
Weidman inhabited.</TE>
<TE>   In his "Rhythm Ritual," for instance, dancers manipulated long
wooden poles not only for percussive accompaniment, but, as a Times
review noted in 1974, "as arm extensions capable of great expressive
fluidity." Traditional African dances also had used poles, but
Rodgers managed to free the concept from any folkloric links,
emphasizing the kind of movement flow associated with modern dance
technique.</TE>
<TE>   While continuing his pure-movement experiments, he also
choreographed a series of works using his modern dance expertise to
honor such African American icons as writer Langston Hughes
("Langston Lives," 1981), civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.
("The Legacy," 1984) and educator George Washington Carver ("Against
Great Odds," 1986).</TE>
<TE>   Besides his work for his company, he choreographed television
specials, operas and off-Broadway productions, and some of his pieces
have gone into the repertoires of such major regional ensembles as
Philadanco and the Cleo Parker Robinson Dance Company.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout his career he sought to discourage black artists from
what he called "oversimplified traditional images," and told dance
historian Lynne Fauley Emery in 1970 that he had "tried not to be a
professional black man."</TE>
<TE>   In a 1992 Times interview, he explained that "when we talk about
celebrating the creative struggle of black Americans, we extend that
to include not just struggles for freedom and social change, but also
struggles to create innovative works."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Rodgers was remembered as "a dance warrior" by Lula
Washington, artistic director of the locally based Lula Washington
Dance Theatre. "He always went about doing his work and doing his
choreography and keeping his company going, but he was also an
advocate for how black artists were represented in dance," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "His voice will be truly missed. He was like a mentor to Erwin
[her husband] and myself and he always took time to give us input and
direction."</TE>
<TE>   His survivors include his companion, Kim Grier; two brothers; two
sisters; four sons; and a grandson.</TE>

<LD>As farmers cheered, federal officials let the water flow Friday from
a canal into fields for the first time since last summer, when
irrigation was halted amid fears over endangered sucker fish.</LD>
<LD>   Because of drought, federal officials decided last year to cut off
water to about 1,000 farmers in California and Oregon who use it to
irrigate fields of wheat, potatoes and other crops. The decision led
to confrontations pitting farmers against environmentalists, salmon
fishermen and Indian tribes.</LD>
<LD>   Federal officials decided to open the taps Friday because of
increased snow and rain this winter. But only two months of
irrigation water have been authorized, because federal agencies are
still awaiting opinions, due June 1, from biology experts on the
long-term environmental impact of water releases.</LD>

<HD>Peggy Wayburn, 84; Author and Conservationist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HYMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Peggy Wayburn sat down to write her second book about Alaska,
she chose to begin with a simple statistic: Anyone wishing to explore
the entire state would have to visit about one million acres per
day--for a year.</LD>
<LD>   It was a simple, elegant number meant to impress upon readers the
enormity of a place that Wayburn argued should be left as is.</LD>
<LD>   A prolific nature writer and environmentalist who was instrumental
in preserving millions of acres in Alaska and creating some of
Northern California's most cherished parks, Peggy Wayburn died March
21 in San Francisco after a long illness. She was 84.</LD>
<TE>   Known primarily for five books she wrote on the outdoors, Wayburn
also was published in a variety of magazines and was an accomplished
photographer whose images graced many calendars. She was involved in
a number of conservation organizations, including the San
Francisco-based Sierra Club.</TE>
<TE>   A native of New York City who was a member of Phi Beta Kappa at
Barnard College, she moved to San Francisco in 1945 and quickly fell
in love both with the area's beauty and with doctor and outdoorsman
Edgar Wayburn. Their first date was spent hiking on Mt. Tamalpais,
just north of the city. They were married in 1947.</TE>
<TE>   Edgar Wayburn was a rising figure in the Sierra Club, and by
default--at least initially--Peggy Wayburn was thrust into some of
the state's most contentious environmental battles.</TE>
<TE>   In California, the club was battling to protect small but
important places previously overlooked by the state and federal
governments. The Wayburns were part of the push that would eventually
lead to the creation of Point Reyes National Seashore in 1962 and,
later, Redwoods National Park and Golden Gate National Recreation
Area.</TE>
<TE>   But in 1967, the Wayburns took their first trip to Alaska--a
voyage they would take dozens more times over the next 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   "What Peggy and Ed found in Alaska were vast, intact, pristine
ecosystems," said Deborah Williams, executive director of the Alaska
Conservation Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   "Peggy felt that human beings have a profound obligation to be
good stewards to the land," Williams said, "and she saw in Alaska
both an opportunity and responsibility to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Upon returning to California, the Wayburns began pushing the
Sierra Club to pay more attention to Alaska. It was a critical time
for the newly created state, with tremendous pressures to divvy up
tens of millions of acres of federally owned land between the
fledgling state government and the many tribes native to the area.</TE>
<TE>   It also was a time when there was a growing awareness that intact
ecosystems in the United States were rare. Environmentalists began
pointing out how the West--even with its expansive national parks and
forests--was missing vital members of its natural communities. Not
only did Alaska still have all its native species, but it had them in
almost unimaginably large numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Inspired, Wayburn wrote two books on the state. The first,
"Alaska, the Great Land" was co-written by Mike Miller and published
in 1974. Along with John McPhee's "Coming Into the Country," it was
influential because it expressed how different--and how wild--Alaska
still was to an audience that mostly never had seen the state, nor
ever would. The book also became a staple on Capitol Hill in the
1970s as the debate over federal land in Alaska heated up in
Congress.</TE>
<TE>   The second book, "Adventuring in Alaska," was the first Sierra
Club adventure guide and remains in print. It was one of the first
comprehensive guidebooks for the state, offering readers practical
travel tips and a myriad of facts on Alaska's natural wonders.</TE>
<TE>   In December 1980, just weeks before leaving office, President
Carter signed the Alaska Lands Act, which set aside 104 million acres
in the state as either national parks, national wildlife refuges or
national forests. Carter has since called it one of the most
important accomplishments of his presidency.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, President Clinton awarded Edgar Wayburn a Presidential
Medal of Freedom, citing his and Peggy's work in Alaska during a
White House ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   "I think what captivated my parents about Alaska was that it was
California 500 years ago and there were such great pressures [to
develop it]," said Cynthia Wayburn of Seattle, one of the couple's
four children.</TE>
<TE>   "What Mom was able to convey in her books was that there should be
places where life can go on as it has gone on for thousands and
thousands of years."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to her husband and daughter Cynthia, Peggy Wayburn is
survived by two other daughters, Diana Wayburn of New York and Laurie
Wayburn of Boonville, Calif.; a son, William of Seattle; and three
grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service is planned April 7 at the Presidio in San
Francisco. Donations in her name can be made to the Sierra Club
Foundation, Alaska Conservation Foundation or Earthjustice.</TE>

<HD>Jacquie Lynn, 73; Acted in Comedies as a Child</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Her Hollywood career was brief--it began when she was 3 and ended
before she was 5--but Jacquelyn Woll worked with screen greats Laurel
and Hardy, Marie Dressler and Little Rascal Spanky MacFarland.</LD>
<LD>   Billed as Jacquie Lynn, she made her film debut in the Laurel and
Hardy feature "Pack Up Your Troubles," appearing in a memorable scene
in which she reads "Goldilocks and the Three Bears" to a sleepy
Laurel.</LD>
<LD>   Woll, who was rediscovered by Laurel and Hardy fans a decade ago
after a lifetime out of the public eye, died of a heart attack March
21 at her home in Granada Hills. She was 73.</LD>
<TE>   Born Jacquelyn Dufton in Kent County, England, in 1928, she came
to the United States with her widowed mother--her father, a British
naval officer, had died of pneumonia--at age 2 and was raised in
Brentwood.</TE>
<TE>   Cowboy star Tim McCoy, a family friend, suggested to Jacquelyn's
mother that she take her cherub-faced blond daughter to see producer
Hal Roach.</TE>
<TE>   Roach, who preferred natural rather than trained child actors,
cast her in the Laurel and Hardy film and two Our Gang comedies,
including "Free Wheeling," in which she is a passenger in the gang's
mule-pulled taxi wagon and says, "Spanky, don't you think we're going
rather faw-st?"</TE>
<TE>   On loan to MGM, she appeared in "The Strange Love of Molly Luvain"
with Ann Dvorak and "Prosperity" with Dressler and Polly Moran.</TE>
<TE>   But when Jacquie Lynn's new stepfather asked more for her services
than the studio was willing to pay, her Hollywood career came to an
abrupt end.</TE>
<TE>   She later attended UCLA but left to get married before graduating.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, her Hollywood days were a pleasant childhood
memory--she remembered Laurel's sweet smile and had a big crush on
child actor Dickie Moore.</TE>
<TE>   But for Christmas 1991, her son gave her a videotape copy of "Pack
Up Your Troubles" that had a picture of her on the cover in her
pajamas sitting with the two men she had called Uncle Stan and Uncle
Ollie.</TE>
<TE>   The tape included old home movies of Woll playing with Laurel's
daughter Lois, and in her narration Lois Laurel said Laurel and Hardy
and Little Rascals fans were looking for Jacquie Lynn.</TE>
<TE>   "Those pictures happened so long ago; I had no idea anyone was
interested. It comes as a big shock," Woll said in Leonard Maltin and
Richard W. Bann's "The Little Rascals: The Life and Time of Our
Gang."</TE>
<TE>   She attended two conventions of the Laurel and Hardy appreciation
society, the Sons of the Desert.</TE>
<TE>   "People from the Laurel and Hardy group were always so pleasant
and nice to her," said Woll's husband, Martin, a retired banker. "We
heard from them ever since; they always sent her Christmas cards."</TE>
<TE>   But after two Laurel and Hardy conventions, his wife had had
enough.</TE>
<TE>   "She said, 'You know, I've told them everything I know at the
first two,'" Martin Woll said. And though she agreed to attend the
next convention in Memphis in July, Woll said, "My wife didn't want
to be in the limelight."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to her husband of 52 years, Woll is survived by her
daughter, Marcia Burnham of Benecia, Calif.; sons Martin Jr. of
Chatsworth, Michael of Ojai and Peter of Newhall; and five
grandchildren.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>In one sense, Israel's attack on the headquarters of Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat on Friday was a widely expected
retaliation for a series of increasingly grisly suicide bombings.</LD>
<LD>   But to many U.S. officials and other analysts, the incursion provided
a vivid illustration of the central problem behind the shattered
Arab-Israeli peace process: Neither Arafat nor Israeli Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon, they argued, is a strong enough leader to make peace.</LD>
<LD>   "In 1993 [when Israel and the Palestinians signed a peace treaty at
the White House], we were dealing with [Israeli Prime Minister] Yitzhak
Rabin. Now we're dealing with Ariel Sharon. Big difference," a Bush
administration official said emphatically.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. officials express little or no sympathy for Arafat. In private,
they describe the Palestinian leader as indecisive, evasive and
exasperating.</TE>
<TE>   But they also blame Sharon for operating--in their view--with no
apparent strategy beyond lashing out against terrorists and fending off
internal political challenges.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't a clue where Sharon is trying to go," said Patrick L.
Clawson of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a think tank
that has been largely sympathetic to Israel. "His government doesn't
appear to know where it wants to go, much less how it wants to get
there."</TE>
<TE>   The combination of Arafat and Sharon is a major reason the Bush
administration actively avoided intervening in the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict during its first months in office, a decision that has since
been widely criticized.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't have much to work with," a U.S. official said with a shrug.</TE>
<TE>   Now, with the peace process in ruins, the administration has little
choice. Bush's special envoy, retired Marine Corps Gen. Anthony C. Zinni,
is staying in Israel to try to patch together a cease-fire, however
unpromising the landscape.</TE>
<TE>   In the short run, at least, "unpromising" may be an understatement.
U.S. officials and nongovernmental analysts said Sharon's attack on
Arafat's headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah seemed likely to
lead to more violence, not less.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, they said, it isn't clear that removing Arafat from his
leadership role--even if only temporarily, by cutting off his ability to
communicate--will make it easier for Israel to end the Palestinian
uprising by cracking down on terrorist cells.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat, who won his primacy among Palestinians not through military
victories but through defiance amid a long string of defeats, appears
entirely comfortable in the role of hostage.</TE>
<TE>   "He'll just make himself a symbol of Palestinian resistance," warned
Geoffrey Kemp, who was a Middle East advisor to President Reagan. "The
irony of this situation is that as long as the Israelis hold him
prisoner, he's the headline--which is exactly what he wants to be."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, if Israel seeks to destroy Arafat's nascent government
bureaucracy, the Palestinian Authority, it risks strengthening the main
political alternative in the West Bank and Gaza Strip: the militant
Islamic movement Hamas.</TE>
<TE>   It was Hamas that mounted the worst of this week's terrorist attacks,
the suicide bombing of a Passover dinner in a seaside hotel Wednesday,
which killed 22 people, including the bomber.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the most sinister action possible, because it damaged
everyone," Kemp said. "It was a shot at the fundamental right of Jews to
live in Israel, but it was also a shot against Arafat in the
Palestinians' internal war of succession, a shot against Zinni and his
negotiations, and a shot against the Arab leaders who were about to hold
a summit in Beirut.</TE>
<TE>   "The horrible dilemma is that the extremists are in the saddle," he
said. "In the center, where the opportunity to make peace should be,
there's a vacuum."</TE>
<TE>   At first glance, this week's summit meeting of Arab leaders in Beirut
appeared to be a ray of hope. For the first time, a resolution calling
for a peace deal with Israel was approved by every Arab country,
including longtime hard-line states such as Syria, Iraq and Libya.</TE>
<TE>   But the resolution had no apparent effect on either side in the
Israeli-Palestinian war. U.S. officials said they considered it a
positive development, but more symbolism than substance.</TE>
<TE>   "Where's the step forward?" asked Clawson. "If you go back to the
peace process in the early 1990s, Arab countries were talking then about
real peace with Israel, including trade and investment and travel.</TE>
<TE>   "The only reason it's gone as far as it has is that it was proposed by
Saudi Arabia. Nobody wants to annoy the Saudis," he said. "It was nice
that someone made a stab at a peace plan, but there wasn't much there."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the main threat to peace in the Middle East is no longer a
conventional war between Israel and its Arab neighbors, as was the case
in 1967 and 1973. Instead, it's the continuing war of attrition between
Israeli security forces and Palestinian militants--an "asymmetrical war"
in which each side seeks to inflict crippling pain.</TE>
<TE>   And despite the terrible violence of the last week, neither side
appears ready to give up.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian figures across the political spectrum in the West Bank and
Gaza have issued calls to support Arafat as a symbol of resistance.</TE>
<TE>   Inside Israel, the main political pressure on Sharon is to be tougher
on the Palestinians, to not ease up.</TE>
<TE>   "There is strong support for what he is doing today, but confidence in
his government--confidence in general, but also [in] security and the
economy--are all sliding downward," said Stan Greenberg, an American
pollster who has advised Israel's opposition Labor Party.</TE>
<TE>   "There is anger at the Palestinians and a belief that there is nobody
to negotiate with . . . " he said. "So the entire peace camp [and] peace
process have no legitimacy" in the eyes of Israeli voters.</TE>
<TE>   Noted Kemp: "There's legitimate fury on the Israeli side. But it is
important, while understanding the Israelis' fury, to recognize that the
fury is just as intense on the Palestinian side.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest change that's occurred over the past several years is
this: What is gone now, on both sides, is empathy. Neither side feels any
empathy for the other."</TE>

<HD>A Case of Where, Not What</HD>
<DH>Prosecutors say Zacarias Moussaoui's travels-- from an Afghan
terrorist training camp to an Oklahoma flight school-- are key to his
indictment in the Sept. 11 attacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK FINEMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When FBI and immigration agents arrested Zacarias Moussaoui at his
motel in suburban Minneapolis on Aug. 16, they suspected he might be a
potential airline hijacker.</LD>
<LD>   He wanted to fly "the Big Bird," he'd said. He was in a hurry to
learn. And despite more than 50 hours at the controls, he couldn't even
solo a single-engine Cessna.</LD>
<LD>   But the only direct evidence of his breaking the law were technical
violations of his visa.</LD>
<TE>   More than seven months later, U.S. prosecutors say they have
sufficient evidence to warrant that the French-born Moussaoui should die.
He is, they say, a conspirator in Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorism
network and in the Sept. 11 attacks that killed thousands in New York,
Pennsylvania and Arlington, Va.</TE>
<TE>   But while the investigation into Moussaoui has revealed a global
odyssey that intersected a world of terrorism, prosecutors have yet to
produce direct evidence that he ever committed a terrorist act. Nor have
they presented direct proof that Moussaoui was involved in planning the
Sept. 11 hijackings or that he was the intended 20th hijacker before his
arrest, as authorities have privately suggested.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Moussaoui appears to be little more than a bit player in his
own indictment. The conspiracy charges that were handed down Dec. 11 by a
federal grand jury in Alexandria, Va., mostly outline the government's
case against Bin Laden's Al Qaeda forces and the renegade Saudi terrorist
leader himself.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Moussaoui's movements--from his attendance at Al Qaeda's Khalden
training camp in Afghanistan in 1998 to his pilot training last year in
Norman, Okla.--form a virtual map of key arteries in Al Qaeda's global
network.</TE>
<TE>   Interviews with scores of law enforcement agents on three continents,
as well as religious leaders and friends, relatives and colleagues of
Moussaoui's, show that his trail alone testifies to Al Qaeda's far reach,
its roots, recruitment and regional leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Several of Moussaoui's key contacts--from London to Kuala Lumpur--have
emerged since his arrest as major Al Qaeda players. The group's name is
Arabic for "the Base."</TE>
<TE>   An ethnic Moroccan, Moussaoui trained at a terrorist camp at the same
time as an Algerian who would later plot to blow up Los Angeles
International Airport and a Briton who would try to set off a shoe bomb
on a Miami-bound flight from Paris, government officials say.</TE>
<TE>   In London, Moussaoui was steeped in radical Islam by firebrand imams.
And in Malaysia, he had been the guest of Bin Laden's operations chief
for Southeast Asia, an Indonesian cleric who also was host to two Sept.
11 hijackers and oversaw a massive bombing plot in Singapore, according
to authorities in the region.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui's three-member defense team, led by federal public defender
Frank W. Dunham Jr., declined to comment on the case. They have asserted
in court that Moussaoui is innocent and that the case against him is
circumstantial at best. Moussaoui announced in court that "in the name of
Allah," he was offering no plea.</TE>
<TE>   On balance, the case against Moussaoui so far is built only in small
part on what he did, and far more on where, when and with whom he did it.</TE>
<TE>A Time of the 'Big Noise' in London</TE>
<TE>   Zacarias Moussaoui never spoke seriously of God, of Islam or the holy
war Muslims call jihad, when he left France in 1993 at the age of 25, his
mother, Aicha, said. In September of that year, he enrolled in the
graduate program at London's South Bank University, majoring in
international business.</TE>
<TE>   But just as he arrived, South Bank, an urban campus of sooted windows
and aged brick a mile south of the London Bridge, was on the brink of
becoming a hotbed of Islamic extremism--an era Muslim leaders in London
called "the Big Noise."</TE>
<TE>   From 1993 to 1995, Islamic groups were forming chapters at more than
50 university campuses throughout the United Kingdom. And South Bank,
with a large percentage of foreigners among its 17,000 students, was an
ideal incubator for a new generation of self-aware young Muslims like
Moussaoui.</TE>
<TE>   Even today, after Britain has banned such groups from its campuses,
light poles and trash bins surrounding South Bank are plastered with
leaflets protesting the U.S. presence in Afghanistan and promoting such
events as a fundamentalist Islamic gathering at Trafalgar Square.</TE>
<TE>   One gathering in London's Wembley arena by the now-banned Hizb
ut-Tahrir, or Party of Liberation, in August 1994--midway through
Moussaoui's studies--drew an estimated 8,000 fist-shaking, feet-stamping
Muslims. They rallied behind the twin causes of creating a global Islamic
state and destroying Israel. Ideas, witnesses say, Moussaoui would
espouse at mosques from London to Oklahoma years later.</TE>
<TE>   After he graduated from South Bank in June 1995, Moussaoui started
attending Imam Abdul Haqq Baker's services at South London's Brixton
Mosque, an unadorned set of weather-worn brick row houses across from the
Brixton Police Station.</TE>
<TE>   Baker, a classmate at South Bank, said Moussaoui attended the mosque
regularly until 1997. Then, Baker said, Moussaoui was politely told he
wasn't welcome anymore.</TE>
<TE>   The reason was Moussaoui's advocacy of violent struggle against
Israel, Russia, India, the U.S. and other nations that he and other young
worshipers saw as the enemies of Islam.</TE>
<TE>   "Those views were incompatible with those of the mosque," Baker said.
"He [Moussaoui] was very arrogant and aggressive about his views. So we
asked him to please stay away."</TE>
<TE>   It was then, Baker and other sources said, that Moussaoui and
similarly minded Brixton congregants turned to more radical preachers,
such as Sheik Abu Hamza, a one-eyed, handless, Egyptian cleric, and his
Finsbury Park mosque 11 subway stops to the north.</TE>
<TE>   Western law enforcement agents said Moussaoui attended the Finsbury
Park mosque in 1997 at the same time as Richard Reid, the man now in
custody for trying to detonate bombs hidden in his shoes on an American
Airlines flight to Miami in December.</TE>
<TE>   Hamza, a British-trained civil engineer, said he had just returned to
London from Afghanistan that year after losing his hands and eye to a
land mine while serving with the Taliban. He has run the Finsbury Park
mosque ever since.</TE>
<TE>   In a rare interview recently, the cleric said that he is "very much
against the American government" but denied preaching violence. He said
he couldn't recall whether Moussaoui was a member of his flock, but
added, "It's not only him. It's everyone who was here at the time. The
more they dream, the more their heart is open, and the more zealous they
become."</TE>
<TE>   The cleric said he thinks Bin Laden "is a good guy." And his mosque's
small bookshop is still selling jihad journals and a CD-ROM, "Beginners
Guide to Unarmed Combat," which teaches how to kill enemies with
household items or brute force.</TE>
<TE>   Also on sale: Years' worth of videos of Hamza's weekly Friday sermons,
praising and recruiting for "Sheik Osama."</TE>
<TE>   In one typical entreaty, Hamza encourages his followers to go to
Afghanistan and pledge the bayat oath of loyalty to Bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   "Osama gives the bayat to show that we are all one people and all one
country," Hamza said in the video, spreading the stumps of his arms at
the dais and fervently urging the faithful to join Afghanistan's
then-ruling Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   "You go there," he told them.</TE>
<TE>   And in April 1998, government officials say, Moussaoui did--the
culmination, his mother would later call it, of years of "brainwashing"
by "those phony imams" in Britain.</TE>
<TE>Camp Mates Included Ressam and Reid</TE>
<TE>   When Moussaoui walked into Al Qaeda's introductory Khalden camp in
remote eastern Afghanistan, the terrorism sanctuary was teeming with
scores of new recruits. They came from more than half a dozen countries.</TE>
<TE>   Ahmed Ressam, a 34-year-old Algerian later dubbed "the millennium
bomber" for his plot to blow up LAX on the eve of 2000, was there.</TE>
<TE>   So was alleged shoe bomber Reid, according to government officials'
accounts of interviews with Al Qaeda suspects now being held at
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and elsewhere. Moussaoui and Reid trained in the
same group at the camp that year, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Khalden's class of 1998-99, those officials say, included "the hardest
of the hard-core" radicals. Most of the recruits were young, ambitious
and inspired to follow a fatwah, or religious decree, issued by Bin Laden
earlier that year. The fatwah called on Muslims "to kill Americans,
including civilians, anywhere in the world where they can be found," U.S.
prosecutors say.</TE>
<TE>   Ressam left Afghanistan in February 1999 for Canada with sophisticated
detonators in hand. There, he would spend most of the year assembling
materials for the bomb meant for Los Angeles. The plot failed when U.S.
Customs agents, who suspected he was a drug smuggler, discovered the
explosives in his car as he crossed the border at Port Angeles, Wash., in
mid-December.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui returned to London, where his trail disappeared. He
resurfaced in September 2000 in Malaysia.</TE>
<TE>A Rogues' Gallery at Malaysian Condo</TE>
<TE>   When Moussaoui arrived at Yazid Sufaat's condominium in the secluded
evergreen park complex 20 miles south of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia's Special
Branch intelligence service already was well aware it had been used by
terrorism suspects in the past.</TE>
<TE>   Sufaat, a 1987 biochemistry graduate of Cal State Sacramento, bought
the three-room condo with his wife as a weekend retreat, Malaysian
officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Eight months before Moussaoui's visit, Special Branch agents had
followed a Yemeni to the condo. The Yemeni was on the CIA's terrorist
watch list. He stayed there three days in early January 2000, sometimes
in the company of two other Arab men.</TE>
<TE>   The Yemeni later was identified as a key suspect in the October 2000
bombing of the U.S. destroyer Cole in the Yemeni port city of Aden. The
other two were future Sept. 11 hijackers.</TE>
<TE>   But neither Malaysian nor U.S. officials had a clue at the time that
any such plots were afoot, they say. And Moussaoui, they say, was on no
one's watch list when he arrived in September 2000.</TE>
<TE>   His visit didn't attract notice until Sept. 11, when Moussaoui was
already in U.S. custody and a search of his belongings in Oklahoma and
Minnesota uncovered the Malaysian connection.</TE>
<TE>   Sufaat had signed three letters vouching for Moussaoui's employment.
They were dated October 2000 on the stationery of Infocus Tech, a
software and computer firm in Kuala Lumpur.</TE>
<TE>   The letters, seized by the FBI in Moussaoui's Norman apartment,
identified Moussaoui as an Infocus marketing consultant for the U.S.,
Britain and Europe with a $2,500-a-month allowance. The company's lawyer
says Sufaat holds no position with the company, but corporate records
show his wife is an officer and part owner of Infocus Tech.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a company half-owned by Sufaat was linked to another
terrorism plot. Green Laboratory Medicine, a Malaysian government
subcontractor that tested blood and urine samples of foreign workers for
drug use, was identified by investigators in neighboring Singapore as
having ordered several tons of urea, a potentially powerful bomb
ingredient. Malaysian and Singaporean authorities say several Western
embassies and a visiting U.S. warship were among potential targets.</TE>
<TE>   Sufaat was detained Dec. 9 under Malaysia's Internal Security Act,
which allows authorities to hold terrorism suspects without charges
indefinitely. He soon started cooperating with authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Sufaat identified an Indonesian businessman and part-time cleric named
Riduan Isamuddin, better known as Hambali, as the man who instructed him
to provide lodging to Moussaoui. Further investigation revealed Hambali
was the director of Al Qaeda operations in Southeast Asia, Malaysian
officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Hambali was a business partner of Wali Khan Amin Shah, one of three
men convicted by a federal jury in New York City in a January 1995 plot
to blow up 12 U.S. jumbo jets within 48 hours over the Pacific Ocean.
Hambali also led the plot to blow up Western targets in Singapore this
year, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Hambali is a fugitive wanted in at least three nations. He left
Malaysia, investigators say, soon after he ordered Sufaat to look after
Moussaoui.</TE>
<TE>   Before Moussaoui left town, Sufaat also helped him set up an Internet
address: http://www.pilotz123@hotmail.com.</TE>
<TE>   And in the months ahead, Moussaoui used that account again and again,
apparently with a singular purpose:</TE>
<TE>   He wanted to learn how to fly.</TE>
<TE>An Urgency to Start Flight Training</TE>
<TE>   "Hello, Mrs. Brenda," Moussaoui wrote in broken English in an Oct. 22,
2000, e-mail to Brenda Keene, admissions director at the Airman Flight
School in Norman.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very busy latelly [sic] to prepare my departure to the U.S. I
hope to come in the next mont [sic] (maybe two weeks) if everything goes
well. I think that when we meet (hopefully) we will have the opportunity
to discuss further the financial situation, so for the moment I leave
this . . .</TE>
<TE>   "Fly well, bye, bye."</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui had begun his e-mail relationship with Keene three weeks
before, requesting basic information about the school and its
professional pilot program, a package that includes everything from a
private license to commercial ratings for jetliners.</TE>
<TE>   Back in London on Oct. 22, Moussaoui was following up with the first
of four more e-mails. Not once did he use his full or real name. Each was
signed "zuluman tangotango." And all betrayed not only a difficulty with
English but also an urgency to begin flight lessons.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui's indictment states that Ramzi Bin al-Shibh, a Yemeni who
once shared an apartment with suspected hijacking ringleader Mohamed Atta
in Germany, had been trying, yet failing for months, to enter the U.S.
Bin al-Shibh's aim was to attend a Florida flight school where two Sept.
11 hijackers were training.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of October 2000, Bin al-Shibh had been denied a U.S. visa
for a fourth and final time. Through timing alone, the indictment implies
that Moussaoui may have been Bin al-Shibh's replacement as a hijacker.</TE>
<TE>   In perhaps the strongest link in the official case against Moussaoui,
the indictment says that Bin al-Shibh, who is named as a co-conspirator,
wired Moussaoui $14,000 from Germany, and Moussaoui called Bin al-Shibh's
German phone number from pay phones in Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   Bin al-Shibh also wired money to Atta and other future hijackers while
they were studying at flight schools in Florida throughout 2000.</TE>
<TE>   And by Feb. 10 last year, when Moussaoui again e-mailed "Mrs. Brenda"
in Oklahoma, prosecutors say he had made at least one trip to
Pakistan--the entry point for visitors to the then-Taliban-ruled
Afghanistan that was Bin Laden's Al Qaeda base.</TE>
<TE>   "First I wish a happy new year (a bit late I admit) and I hope that
everybody in your school is in the best of healt (sic) and flying mood.</TE>
<TE>   "I do apologize for the long delay but life is never as you plan.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully this time I am ready."</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui was interested in the $21,999 complete package, he wrote,
but insisted on paying first for a private pilot's license and "if I
succeed I will carry on paying the rest on a monthly basis."</TE>
<TE>   Then suddenly, in a second e-mail 12 days later on Feb. 22 headed,
"URGENT flying to you tomorrow," Moussaoui wrote that he was leaving from
London and landing in Oklahoma City at 5:35 p.m. Friday, Feb. 23.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be nice," he wrote, "if someone will be receiving me."</TE>
<TE>Chances of Success at School Looked Dim</TE>
<TE>   When Juan Carlos Merida wheeled the Airman Flight School van up to the
arrival hall at Oklahoma City's Will Rogers Airport, he recognized
Moussaoui instantly.</TE>
<TE>   Merida, a veteran pilot from Panama, had seen hundreds of Moussaouis
come and go in his years of working at the Norman flight school as an
instructor and jack-of-all-trades. The school has trained an average of
600 pilots--many of them foreigners--each year since 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Yet as Merida drove Moussaoui to the Sooner Hotel he wasn't optimistic
about the young Frenchman's chances of success.</TE>
<TE>   "I could barely understand him through his accent," Merida said. "I
wondered how he was going to get through the course. . . . And after I
took him to the hotel, where many of our students stay, he said it wasn't
good.</TE>
<TE>   "It was too expensive, and too public. He wanted an apartment to
himself, with a private entrance. And cheap."</TE>
<TE>   A few days later, Moussaoui found one. He traded his $32.25-a-night
mini-suite at the Sooner for an upstairs one-bedroom apartment in an
aging house half a block from the Oklahoma University campus. Keene said
it rents for about $325 a month.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui had arrived with more than $35,000 in cash, declaring it to
U.S. Customs at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. Soon after he
moved into the apartment, he opened a bank account with $32,000. He
bought an old beaten-up white sedan for about $1,000.</TE>
<TE>   He told Keene that first day that he'd pay only the $4,995 for the
private pilot lessons and the rest if and when he soloed and passed.</TE>
<TE>   "He was very secretive," Keene said. "He didn't speak about his
private life at all. He didn't even let on what he wanted to do with his
license."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, he never got it.</TE>
<TE>   On May 29, when Moussaoui still couldn't solo despite more than 50
hours of flying time with an instructor, the school's operations
director, Dale Davis, took him aside and broke the bad news "in a nice
way."</TE>
<TE>   "The main thing we talked about was his English," Davis said. If he
wanted to continue lessons, Moussaoui would have to start paying by the
hour--at $100 an hour--Davis told him. And he'd need about 25 hours more.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui opted out.</TE>
<TE>   In the following weeks, Moussaoui spent his time in Oklahoma, much of
it with two Muslims he had met through a mosque in Norman, according to
those who knew them and government officials. Both men now are in federal
custody, presumably held as material witnesses against Moussaoui.</TE>
<TE>   One of those friends, Hussein al-Attas, who was detained with
Moussaoui in Minnesota, said Moussaoui talked to him for hours about the
plight of Muslims and their need to fight the West, official sources say.
A 19-year-old Yemeni who had memorized the Koran cover to cover, al-Attas
would accompany Moussaoui on the next--and final--leg of his journey.</TE>
<TE>   The other, another fellow worshiper at the mosque named Mukarram Ali,
lent Moussaoui a Compaq laptop computer that would briefly be the focus
of federal investigators' efforts to determine whether--and
what--Moussaoui was plotting.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui took his next step by e-mail, as pilotz123.</TE>
<TE>'Mrs. Zacarias' Gets Ready to Fly</TE>
<TE>   "Hello," Moussaoui's e-mail to the Pan Am International Flight Academy
in Miami began, "I am Mrs. Zacarias! [sic]</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, I need to know if you can help to achieve my 'Goal' my
dream. I would like to fly in a 'professional' like manners [sic] one of
the big airliners. I have to made my mind which of the following: Boeing
747, 757, 767, or 777 and or Airbus 300 (it will depend on the cost and
which one is the easiest to learn).</TE>
<TE>   "The level I would like to achieve is to be able to takeoff and land,
to handle communication with [Air Traffic Control], to be able to
successfully navigate from A to B (JFK to Heathrow for example).</TE>
<TE>   "In a sense, to be able to pilot one of the Big Bird, even if I am not
a real professional pilot. . . . I have around 55 hrs of fly in a
[Cessna] 152, and I passed my written [private pilot license exam] last
month.</TE>
<TE>   "I know I could be better but I am sure that you can do something.</TE>
<TE>   "After all we are in AMERICA, and everything is possible.</TE>
<TE>   "Have a nice day, waiting for a positive fly.</TE>
<TE>   "Thanks you</TE>
<TE>   "Zac"</TE>
<TE>   Two months later, Moussaoui was on the road north.</TE>
<TE>   Al-Attas drove him from Norman to Minneapolis on Aug. 9. He had waited
more than two months for an opening at one of Pan Am's four regional
centers that offered such programs, according to school Vice President
Marilyn Ladner.</TE>
<TE>   The previous month, Moussaoui made a down payment to Pan Am by credit
card. In late July and early August, Moussaoui made the pay phone calls
from Oklahoma to Bin al-Shibh's number in Germany. And on Aug. 1 and 3,
Bin al-Shibh wired the $14,000 in money orders to Moussaoui in Oklahoma
from train stations in Dusseldorf and Hamburg.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 10, Moussaoui checked into the Residence Inn near Pan Am's
flight school in suburban Minneapolis-St. Paul. The next day, he paid the
school about $6,300 in cash. He only meant to stay five or six days.</TE>
<TE>   His first class was Aug. 13. On Aug. 16, Moussaoui was in jail.</TE>
<TE>   "Our people there recognized Mr. Moussaoui's behavior as not right,"
Ladner said in a telephone interview from the academy's Miami
headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Here was a student with bad English who couldn't fly solo in a
single-engine Cessna after more than 50 hours of dual air time, who
wanted to learn to fly a Boeing 747 and the inner workings of air traffic
control, Ladner said. Program managers and instructors at the Minneapolis
school feared Moussaoui could be a potential hijacker. They called the
FBI.</TE>
<TE>   Agents showed up at Moussaoui's motel the next day. He was arrogant
and combative when they questioned him, sources said. One of the agents
was a former military pilot, who immediately shared the flight school
instructor's concerns.</TE>
<TE>   The agents asked Moussaoui about his immigration status. As a French
citizen, he told them, he had been admitted for a 90-day stay under the
U.S. visa waiver program when he landed Feb. 23 at O'Hare. Then, he said,
he formally applied for an extension.</TE>
<TE>   He invited the agents into his room, where he produced documents to
show his status was legal. The documents included an application dated
March 23, 2001, to the Immigration and Naturalization Service to extend
his stay. With the Airman school's endorsement, Moussaoui had asked the
INS to allow him to remain in the U.S. for another year.</TE>
<TE>   He even sent the INS a $120 check to pay for the extension, and he
showed the agents an INS reply acknowledging it.</TE>
<TE>   But the FBI agents decided that wasn't enough. Technically, Moussaoui
couldn't extend his 90-day visa waiver entry permit to study at a flight
school, government officials said. He would have had to leave the country
and reenter on a student visa, they told him. Then, they asked Moussaoui
if they could search his belongings, which included Ali's borrowed Compaq
computer.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui refused. The FBI turned him over to the INS, impounded his
duffel bag and computer and began an intensive effort to get a warrant to
search the computer's hard drive.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Moussaoui had committed no crime. Justice Department officials in
Washington determined that no judge would find sufficient probable cause
to grant a warrant. The FBI worked up a plan to deport Moussaoui to
France, where counterterrorism laws would permit French investigators to
hold him for three days while they probed his computer.</TE>
<TE>   Just days after Moussaoui's arrest, the French government forwarded a
report to Washington quoting the parents of a young Frenchman who had
died fighting alongside Islamic rebels in the Russian territory of
Chechnya. The parents blamed Moussaoui for recruiting their son.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, just hours after the Sept. 11 attacks, federal judges in
Oklahoma City and Minneapolis granted the FBI search warrants for
Moussaoui's belongings.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI served them almost simultaneously at the Residence Inn in
Minnesota and Moussaoui's apartment in Oklahoma, where agents found a
flight manual and pilot software for a 747. They also found the Infocus
Tech letters there, along with a hand-held aviation radio and a notebook
that listed Bin al-Shibh's telephone numbers in Germany.</TE>
<TE>   But when they turned on the laptop and searched its files in
Minneapolis, the only suspicious item they found was a file on
crop-dusting--a discovery that led to an emergency order grounding
crop-dusters throughout the country as a precaution against a potential
chemical weapon attack.</TE>
<TE>   The ban on crop-duster planes lasted for days, drawing the ire of
farmers and pilots throughout the country. But federal investigators
concede they still have no idea what--if anything--Moussaoui planned to
do with the information.</TE>
<TE>   The crop-duster evidence was circumstantial, but sufficient to justify
the ban under post-Sept. 11 circumstances. And now, prosecutors are
counting on the same circumstances to win a conviction at Moussaoui's
trial.</TE>
<TE>   Jury selection begins Sept. 30.</TE>

Minneapolis office when they become suspicious of Moussaoui's motives.</TE>
<TE>   Aug. 16, 2001</TE>
<TE>   FBI agents question Moussaoui and decide to hold him on immigration
charges. He protests, producing documents to show he legally applied to
extend his 90-day stay. He refuses to allow agents to search his

<HD>Davis Gets More Money From Prison Guards</HD>
<DH>Politics: Latest $251,000 comes after he raises their pay and seeks
to close private institutions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO
</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis received an additional $251,000 from California's
prison guards union earlier this month, only weeks after the governor
granted the officers a pay hike of as much as $1 billion and fulfilled
their wish by proposing to close five private prisons.</LD>
<LD>   The California Correctional Peace Officers Assn.'s donation, dated
March 13, is the largest single check Davis has received since taking
office in 1999, though three other donors have given lump sums of
$250,000.</LD>
<LD>   With the latest check, the union has contributed $306,000 directly to
the Democratic governor, plus $356,000 through the union's "Governor's
Cup" golf fund-raisers at Pebble Beach.</LD>
<TE>   Davis has brought in more than $1 million a month since taking office,
and has roughly $30 million available for his November election campaign
against Republican Bill Simon Jr. The governor defends his constant push
to raise money, saying it's required to compete against independently
wealthy candidates such as Simon.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Thursday, Davis made no mention of the prison guards'
March 13 donation, but said there is no connection between his official
actions and campaign donations.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 16, he signed legislation that will grant prison guards a
33.76% pay hike by 2006, giving them virtual parity with California
Highway Patrol officers and police in Los Angeles, San Diego and other
big cities. He included the proposal to close the privately operated
prisons as part of his budget, released on Jan. 10.</TE>
<TE>   Union President Don Novey said that despite the donation, the guards
haven't decided whether to endorse Davis or Simon in this year's
campaign. He would not specify why the union made the latest donation,
except to say there was no connection between the money and the
governor's recent actions.</TE>
<TE>   "That had nothing to do with it, but I guess it would be good cannon
fodder," Novey said, adding that though Davis often inquires about
donations, the union's executive board made the decision about the amount
and timing.</TE>
<TE>   Novey said the union will spend addition sums in the coming election:
"I put notice to my Republican friends that we will not determine the
money we're putting into the governor's race until we've done the
interviews with the two final candidates for governor."</TE>
<TE>   The union gave a single check for $425,000 to Republican Gov. Pete
Wilson in October 1994. Like Davis, Wilson signed labor pacts giving
guards bigger raises than most other state employees.</TE>
<TE>   Simon spokesman Jamie Fisfis said the Republican candidate holds out
hope that he can win the union's endorsement.</TE>
<TE>   Fisfis also criticized Davis for accepting the donation after taking
actions that benefited the donor: "The governor has a duty to avoid the
appearance of impropriety or that he is bullying donors by holding
special chits or legislation over their heads. In this case, he has
failed that duty."</TE>
<TE>   In the Thursday interview, Davis defended his decision to shut five of
the state's nine corporate-run prisons when their contracts expire on
June 30, saying private firms should not be involved in public safety
matters. He twice noted that he has not discussed the issue with the
union leadership since he took office. The issue was among those the
union asked Davis about when he was running for governor in 1998,
however.</TE>
<TE>   "I do believe philosophically--although I didn't have a conversation
on this in the three years and three months that I've been
governor--there are some things a state should do," Davis said. "If we
learned anything from this energy debacle, it is that private companies
will do what's in the interest of their shareholders, and sometimes those
interests are antithetical to the public. I see no reason why private
companies should be in the business of building prisons."</TE>
<TE>   Davis said the decision to shut the private prisons will save the
state $5 million, although the facilities' advocates say the decision
could cost the state money. Davis said a recent decline in prison
population to 156,000 from a high of 162,000 played a role in the
decision.</TE>
<TE>   Recent state audits have given high marks to the five targeted private
prisons. The facilities house a combined 1,400 low-security inmates, most
of whom have been convicted of drug-related crimes. The prisons' owners,
who range from publicly traded corporations that operate in several
states to a firm founded by two men in Bakersfield, have mounted a
letter-writing and lobbying campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "Good Lord," Gary White, co-founder of Mesa Verde, a private prison in
Bakersfield, said upon hearing of the $251,000 donation. "What we're
doing is planning for the worst and hoping for the best. . . . The only
thing that would change his mind is an overwhelming public response. It
doesn't look very good."</TE>
<TE>   The union, which doesn't represent private prison employees, argues
that public safety should be the government's domain.</TE>
<TE>   As reported by The Times on March 15, a union lobbyist who has since
left the organization hailed the governor's decision to close the private
prisons in a telephone recording intended for union members. He extolled
the labor contract, citing a legislative analysis estimating that the
richer salaries and benefits "conservatively" would cost the state $500
million to $1 billion annually by 2006, the contract's final year.</TE>
<TE>   Under legislation by Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San
Francisco), candidates must post donations of $5,000 or more on the
California secretary of state's Web site within two weeks of receiving
them. The $251,000 donation, though received on March 13, became public
late Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Six-figure donations are not unusual for Davis. He has received 53
donations of $100,000 or more since 1999; several donors have given
cumulative sums of $100,000 or more.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest single donation to Davis' 1998 campaign was $500,000 from
the Southern California District Council of Carpenters. The prison guards
union spent $2.3 million directly and indirectly in so-called independent
expenditures on Davis' behalf in the 1998 election after it endorsed him
over then-Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren.</TE>
<TE>   Current law imposes no cap on donations to candidates for statewide
office, but limits will take effect after the November election.</TE>

<HD>Arctic Drilling Study Cites Wildlife Risk</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE
</DL>
<LD>Oil development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, the
keystone of President Bush's energy strategy, poses a potential threat to
caribou and other wildlife that already are fighting the effects of
Arctic warming, government scientists concluded Friday.</LD>
<LD>   In a long-awaited review of the environmental consequences of oil
drilling in the northern Alaskan refuge, biologists for the U.S.
Geological Survey said oil development would "most likely" restrict the
area available for caribou calving. This would lead to impaired
reproduction and calf survival for the 123,000 caribou that flock each
spring to the refuge's 1.5-million-acre coastal plain to bear their
young.</LD>
<LD>   The scientists considered a range of oil development scenarios, but
many of the conclusions did not identify each scenario's results, leaving
the report's findings open to interpretation.</LD>
<TE>   The administration quickly moved to downplay the findings, pointing
out that the heaviest threats are likely posed by development scenarios
that are much more substantial than Congress is considering. But drilling
opponents said the report lays out realistic consequences of development
on the fragile tundra.</TE>
<TE>   "The Bush administration believed this scientific study would revive
their sagging case for drilling in the pristine Arctic. Now that their
pseudo-environmental arguments have been exposed as little more than big
oil's wishful thinking, the administration should . . . finally put aside
plans to drill in the pristine wilderness of the Arctic," said Sen. John
F. Kerry (D-Mass.), who has threatened a filibuster if Arctic drilling is
inserted into Senate energy legislation likely to be debated in the
coming weeks.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the effects could be either substantial or almost nonexistent
depending on the level and location of oil development, said Bill Seitz,
the USGS' deputy regional director in Alaska.</TE>
<TE>   "This is probably the first time we've brought some up-to-date
information that tries to quantify what some of these impacts are going
to be," Seitz said. "Some scenarios have no impact at all. One [with the
heaviest effects] looks at full-blown development. But I think everyone
would agree now that development . . . is going to be something much
smaller, and much less intrusive."</TE>
<TE>Study Started in the 1980s</TE>
<TE>   The USGS often works closely with the oil industry, preparing federal
oil and gas estimates. The team of biologists that prepared the report,
relying on the work of dozens of independent researchers, began its study
in the 1980s, when it was part of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.</TE>
<TE>   Their analysis looked at five scenarios, ranging from draining the oil
pool on the border between ANWR and the existing Prudhoe Bay oil field,
which would have relatively little effect on the refuge, to full oil and
gas leasing throughout the coastal plain, including building permanent
roads and an airport.</TE>
<TE>   Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton has emphasized that ANWR oil,
estimated at 5.7 billion to 16 billion barrels, could lessen dependence
on foreign oil.</TE>
<TE>   Interior spokesman Mark Pfeifle said the report underscores that the
effects on wildlife can be minimal with appropriate mitigation.</TE>
<TE>   "The report bolsters the administration's mandate that production in
the ANWR area must require the most significant environmental protections
ever imposed on energy production," Pfeifle said.</TE>
<TE>House Proposal Highly Restrictive</TE>
<TE>   Pfeifle said none of the development scenarios studied by the USGS is
as limiting as the restrictions passed by the House of Representatives
last year; it would restrict development to 2,000 acres.</TE>
<TE>   Presumably, that would be located in the northwest corner of the
coastal plain, where most of the oil is believed to be. Additionally,
techniques such as ice roads and slant drilling would minimize any harm,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   USGS Director Charles G. Groat said Friday that he has asked the
scientists to analyze within the next 10 days the effect of more limited
oil development.</TE>
<TE>   Some caribou scientists said it would be difficult to quickly analyze
development limited to the northwest end of the coastal plain because
little data of that kind exist.</TE>
<TE>   Drilling opponents doubt that limiting oil development to the
northwest quadrant would provide substantial benefits. Most of the polar
bear dens on the coastal plain are located there, for example. And the
Sierra Club says a 2,000-acre footprint under consideration could still
support a broad level of development.</TE>
<TE>   "We did one scenario that was consistent with the 2,000-acre
footprint, and it would sustain 53 drilling pads and 250 miles of roads
and pipelines," Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club, said in
an interview.</TE>
<TE>   "What this [USGS] study shows is what every previous study has shown,
that turning this refuge over to the oil industry will have very damaging
effects on its use as wildlife habitat," Pope said.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates for oil development in the refuge said they would not take
the study seriously as long as it failed to consider the true, limited
scope of oil activity now being contemplated.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a report that's based on very fictional development scenarios,"
said Kim Duke, executive director of Arctic Power, an Anchorage-based
drilling lobby group. "They've taken a worst-case scenario with a great
part of this report, but even that can be mitigated. Thirty years of
development in Prudhoe Bay has shown no adverse impacts on wildlife."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the USGS report points as an example to the caribou herd at
Prudhoe Bay, whose numbers have been robust but whose calving activity
has been significantly displaced by oil fields.</TE>
<TE>   Similar displacement for ANWR's Porcupine caribou herd would be
difficult because the coastal plain is much narrower within the refuge,
and the herd may be "particularly sensitive" to oil development, the
report concluded.</TE>
<TE>Arctic Is Warmed by Climate Shift</TE>
<TE>   It is "remotely conceivable" that caribou could find new calving areas
with equally good food supplies and protection from predators, but it is
"quite unlikely," it said.</TE>
<TE>   A general climate shift has warmed up the Arctic summers over the last
several years, providing longer periods of green forage but also
producing unusual freeze-thaw events in the spring that have made it
difficult for caribou to reach the calving grounds--a significant stress
for the herd, the researchers found.</TE>
<TE>   A further problem, biologists noted, is the relative weakness of the
Porcupine herd, which has been in a steady cyclical decline from a peak
of 178,000 in 1989 to 123,000 today.</TE>
<TE>Dwindling Caribou Numbers Feared</TE>
<TE>   The herd could reach the lowest levels ever recorded from 2005 to
2010--just when oil development would be getting underway, the report
said.</TE>
<TE>   "An example we like to give is that on average, if we decreased calf
survival by 5%, the herd wouldn't grow or recover from declines like it's
in now," said caribou biologist Ken Whitten, who was a junior author on
the report.</TE>
<TE>   "The point being, it wouldn't take much," Whitten said. "It doesn't
have to be a catastrophic change in calf survival to have an effect on
the herd."</TE>
<TE>   The report also said the lumbering musk oxen that live in the refuge
are "particularly vulnerable" to disturbance during the winter months,
when oil road building and construction are busiest.</TE>
<TE>   The wind and snow leave the animals with little food or energy to move
away from the oil activity.</TE>
<TE>   "Musk oxen . . . are vulnerable to disturbance from activities
associated with petroleum exploration and extraction because of their
year-round residency, their small population numbers and their need to
conserve energy for the nine months of winter if they are to successfully
reproduce," the report said.</TE>
<TE>   About 43% of the Beaufort Sea's land-based polar bears den within the
Arctic refuge. But studies have shown these bears are rarely disturbed by
outside activity, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   "Aggressive and proactive management, therefore, can minimize or
eliminate most of the potential adverse effects of human developments on
denning polar bears," it said.</TE>

<HD>Troops Hit the Heart of Palestinian Power Base</HD>

<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>First the tanks and armored bulldozers punched holes in the high
brick perimeter walls that shielded Yasser Arafat's headquarters and
sanctuary.</LD>
<LD>   Then they smashed through the metal gates on three sides of the
compound, which takes up a city block. The black iron door that once
glided open for visiting dignitaries lay askew in the debris.</LD>
<LD>   Now that they'd gained entry, the tanks and armored personnel carriers
roared into the Palestinian Authority president's parking lot and across
his helipad, homing in on three buildings that were the heart of the
headquarters.</LD>
<TE>   Arafat's offices, where he had been confined for more than three
months, are in the middle building.</TE>
<TE>   The building to the east is the intelligence division, where the
Israeli forces opened a garage-size hole in the facade and then strafed
it with sustained fire from heavy-caliber tank-mounted machine guns.</TE>
<TE>   The building to the west is the governor's offices. There, too, troops
opened a gap and blew a metal door off its hinges. Inside, they shot
through each room and tossed stun grenades for good measure.</TE>
<TE>   They also smashed the snack bar. A red soft-drink vending machine and
an ice cream stand protruded from the rubble.</TE>
<TE>   The region's most powerful army was a well-armed wrecking crew Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Piece by piece, Israeli forces were dismantling Arafat's headquarters,
his power base. With it, the army of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon was
symbolically dismantling Arafat's legendary mystique as the ultimate
survivor. Arafat was no longer in charge but utterly besieged, trapped in
a couple of rooms, surrounded by the enemy.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon says he is dismantling the "terror infrastructure" that he
charges Arafat built and operated out of his headquarters, after the
Palestinian leader failed to stop a deadly wave of suicide bombings and
gun attacks by Palestinian militants.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout much of Friday, the Israelis pounded the headquarters with
stun grenades--more for psychological impact than actual damage--and
fought sporadic gun battles with Arafat's guards. They shelled the
intelligence office, and snipers were posted in spots.</TE>
<TE>   A mighty Merkava tank belching black smoke pulled up and parked in the
driveway on the western side of the compound, a few yards from Arafat's
office. It swiveled and bobbed its turret, returning always to its main
target, the heart of the compound.</TE>
<TE>   Two armored personnel carriers roared past the Merkava, stopped at the
hole in the wall of the governor's offices, opened their hatches and
disgorged their troops. The men conducted room-to-room searches for
weapons and suspects.</TE>
<TE>   Infantry had also entered the intelligence building on the eastern
flank. Arafat was essentially caught in a pincers movement, with soldiers
inching toward him from two sides.</TE>
<TE>   "Probably they will reach him in the end," a Palestinian security
official said.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat used the time to grant one interview after another to
Arabic-language television stations and to telephone various foreign
leaders to appeal for help.</TE>
<TE>   The facade of the intelligence building was splattered with
copper-colored scorch marks. The air was full of grayish dust from the
debris, patted down periodically by a cold rain.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Eitan, head of the Central Command that
oversees the West Bank, said his forces had seized control of all of the
compound except the floor of the building where Arafat lives.</TE>
<TE>   Israel has intimate familiarity with Arafat's building. The
three-story structure served as the Israeli military base until Israel
withdrew from Ramallah in 1995 as part of the landmark Oslo accords that
were to end Israel's occupation of the West Bank. The bottom floor has
guard rooms, the middle floor houses Arafat's office, dining room and
sleeping quarters, and the top has more offices.</TE>
<TE>   Part of it was built originally as a prison during the British mandate
period.</TE>
<TE>   Fighting subsided by nightfall Friday, but between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m.
today, steady bursts of machine-gun fire and a huge explosion could be
heard at the compound.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond it, most of Ramallah was a ghost town Friday. Stores and
offices were shut, and few people, except gunmen, ventured outside.
Dozens of tanks and other armored carriers were seen moving through the
city.</TE>

<HD>Suspected 'Friendly Fire' Case Disclosed</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: The first U.S. soldier killed in Operation Anaconda
may have been strafed by gunship, Pentagon says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The first U.S. soldier killed in Operation Anaconda this month in
Afghanistan may have been hit by fire from an American warplane, in an
attack that caused a major setback in the battle, the Pentagon disclosed
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The Pentagon also released a report that acknowledges some errors--but
largely defends the military's conduct--in a series of "friendly fire"
and other "incidents that warranted review" in Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   Initially thought to be the victim of enemy mortar fire, Army Chief
Warrant Officer Stanley L. Harriman of Wade, N.C., may instead have been
killed when an AC-130 gunship strafed a convoy in which Harriman was
traveling in the early hours of Operation Anaconda on March 2.</LD>
<TE>   At the time, the attack on Harriman's convoy was blamed for a
full-scale retreat by the Afghan forces with whom he and other American
Special Forces soldiers were riding.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to prompting criticism of the Afghan fighters, the retreat
enabled Al Qaeda forces to concentrate on U.S. infantrymen. It was a
serious setback on the first day of what became the biggest infantry
battle of the war.</TE>
<TE>   Although the incident is still under investigation, Gen. Tommy Franks,
the commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, said Friday that the plane
radioed that it had "engaged" an enemy convoy at the same moment that
Harriman's unit reported it was under attack.</TE>
<TE>   If Franks' suspicions are confirmed, the incident would raise the
number of U.S. friendly-fire fatalities in Afghanistan to four, military
officials said. Fourteen Americans have been killed in combat or hostile
situations, and 19 others have been killed in aircraft crashes or other
accidents.</TE>
<TE>   During a briefing at the Pentagon, Franks disputed reports that large
numbers of Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters had escaped U.S. forces in
Operation Anaconda or that thousands of Al Qaeda and Taliban loyalists
were gathering in Pakistan. "There are not thousands of Al Qaeda
regrouping . . . whether it's Pakistan or anyplace else," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Franks acknowledged that allied forces don't appear to have come
close to apprehending or killing Osama bin Laden, Taliban supreme leader
Mullah Mohammed Omar or other top members of Al Qaeda and the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not have credible evidence that any one of these principals has
been missed by a day or two," Franks said. "I have not seen anything that
convinces me if we'd only been a little quicker, we'd have had him."</TE>
<TE>   Franks provided a status report on 10 military investigations, some
ongoing.</TE>
<TE>   In general, the document acknowledges communications failures and
other procedural breakdowns but avoids assigning blame and defends the
military's handling of incidents in which allied fighters or Afghan
civilians were killed.</TE>
<TE>   Several cases center on deadly mistakes made while trying to
distinguish friend from foe. The new details on Harriman's death
underscore the confusing circumstances allied forces continue to confront
in a war in which U.S. troops are often embedded in Afghan militias.</TE>
<TE>   Harriman, 34, was driving a pickup truck in a caravan moving slowly
across muddy terrain toward the Shahi Kot valley in eastern Afghanistan
early on March 2 when the convoy came under fire so intense, some
survivors later wondered whether they'd stumbled into an ambush. Harriman
and two Afghan fighters were killed almost immediately, and two dozen
others were wounded.</TE>
<TE>   To fighters in the caravan, Franks said, it would have been difficult
to distinguish fire from an AC-130 from the mortar rounds or
rocket-propelled grenades that the Taliban and Al Qaeda have used.</TE>
<TE>   The report shed little light on the war's deadliest friendly-fire
incident, a Dec. 5 strike by a B-52 bomber that killed three Green Berets
and about 25 Afghan fighters in Showali Kowt, near the former Taliban
stronghold of Kandahar in Afghanistan's south.</TE>
<TE>   In several other prominent and still disputed cases, the Pentagon all
but rules out accepting responsibility for any wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   At least 16 Afghans were killed, and 27 taken into custody, before
U.S. forces realized that the compounds targeted didn't house any Al
Qaeda or Taliban fighters. Franks said Friday that the deaths were
"regrettable" but that U.S. forces were fired upon first.</TE>
<TE>   The report repeats an earlier claim that a Red Cross warehouse bombed
in October "had a long and continuous association with Afghan military
activities" and that the Red Cross failed to include the structure on a
list of sites provided to the military before the bombing began.</TE>

<HD>Bomber Died in Church Blast, Pakistani Authorities Conclude</HD>
<DH>Asia: Police are probing possible links between the attack and
suspected terrorists arrested in FBI-assisted roundups.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL WATSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>Investigators have concluded that the man who killed four Christian
worshipers here blew himself up with high explosives and say the
technically sophisticated assault suggests he had expert training.</LD>
<LD>   Pakistani police supported by FBI agents arrested more than a dozen
suspected members of Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist network in
raids Thursday and are probing for possible links to the March 17 church
attack, a senior Pakistani government official said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The blasts killed five people, including U.S. Embassy employee Barbara
Green and her 17-year-old daughter, Kristen Wormsley. FBI and Pakistani
investigators are now certain that the fifth, unidentified victim was the
attacker, the source said.</LD>
<TE>   In addition to the grenades the attacker threw at the worshipers, he
was wired with a belt full of high explosives that were detonated with "a
kind of pull switch," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't done by an ordinary terrorist," said the source, a top
official in Pakistan's anti-terrorism campaign who asked not to be
identified because the investigation is continuing.</TE>
<TE>   But he added, "We can't say with certainty if there is any connection
with Al Qaeda or another extremist group or some other agency."</TE>
<TE>   If the investigation does lead to Al Qaeda, it would make the
Protestant church bombing the network's first confirmed, successful
terrorist attack since Sept. 11. Richard C. Reid, who is accused of a
botched attempt to blow up an airliner with explosives in his shoes, is
also suspected of being an Al Qaeda terrorist.</TE>
<TE>   In Afghanistan, suspected Al Qaeda or Taliban fighters are known to
have wired themselves with grenades to become walking bombs, ready to
detonate if U.S. or other forces tried to arrest them.</TE>
<TE>   Although Shiite and Sunni Muslim extremists have been attacking each
other's mosques for years in Pakistan, the attackers rarely use weapons
any more complicated than assault rifles or a few grenades tossed through
a door. The Protestant church attack was more complicated.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems it has been carried out by some really, really expert
handlers," the Pakistani official said. "I personally feel that he came
in as a 'worshiper' alongside the other people. He was very well-dressed,
with trousers and formal shoes and a jacket and tie."</TE>
<TE>   FBI agents have taken a sample of the man's DNA and his jacket for
forensic testing in the U.S. to look for clues to his identity and
nationality, and anything that might point to his sponsors, the source
said.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani police also published a composite drawing of the suspect, a
cleanshaven man in his early 20s, in local newspapers Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   During the church service, the man went to a restroom close to an
entry gate, took off his jacket and removed the pins from three of seven
Russian-made grenades in the belt, the source said. The grenade pins were
later found in the jacket pocket, he added.</TE>
<TE>   The belt concealed as much as half a pound or more of high explosives,
which detonated with a blast that caused much more damage than grenades
would have. But the attacker "might not have known this was the fate he
would meet," speculated the Pakistani source, a military officer.</TE>
<TE>Bomber May Have Been Booby-Trapped</TE>
<TE>   Investigators are concentrating on several clues suggesting that the
terrorist might have been unknowingly booby-trapped rather than bent on
suicide, a style of attack that is rare here.</TE>
<TE>   The man threw one grenade to his right, another to his left and the
third down the church's center aisle, before a much larger explosion blew
him up and caused extensive damage, the source said.</TE>
<TE>   Each of the grenades was attached to the belt by threads, and a small
cord linked the "pull switch" to a detonator on the high explosives. That
suggests that the belt explosives went off when the attacker pulled off
the fourth or fifth grenade, the Pakistani official said.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the remaining four grenades would have been as close as an
inch to the belt's hidden explosives, they didn't explode because the
safety pins were still in place, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators are interrogating survivors, including Iranian, Iraqi
and Afghan citizens who attended the service, to see if any are linked to
the terrorist, the source said.</TE>
<TE>   More than 65 people were arrested Thursday in raids on more than five
sites in Faisalabad, Lahore and Multan. Two suspects were killed and two
were injured. At least 28 of those detained were foreigners, most of whom
are believed to be Al Qaeda members, Pakistani sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the Pakistanis detained belong to groups that President Pervez
Musharraf banned as terrorist organizations in January, the source said.</TE>
<TE>   He said Pakistani newspaper reports claiming that U.S. "commandos"
participated in the raids were "absolutely false," nor were FBI agents
involved, he said. But a Pakistani Interior Ministry official said FBI
agents had provided "technical assistance," which he did not explain.</TE>
<TE>   A large number of FBI agents are working in Pakistan and are easily
spotted at Islamabad's best hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Although the anti-terrorism official said the FBI and Pakistani
officials "have a good working relationship," the presence of U.S.
investigators here is a highly sensitive political issue, especially if
they are heavily armed and directly involved in arrests, as local reports
claimed Friday.</TE>
<TE>   FBI agents are officially working on at least two criminal
investigations in Pakistan: the church attack and the abduction and
slaying of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl in the port city of
Karachi.</TE>
<TE>   The trial of British-born Islamic extremist Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh,
the prime suspect in Pearl's killing, should begin April 5 with a formal
reading of the indictment, a judge ordered at a hearing Friday.</TE>
<TE>   For security reasons, the trial will be held inside Karachi's main
jail. It is scheduled to last a week.</TE>
<TE>   Three other suspects will also face trial, and police say they are
still searching for more people involved in the plot to kidnap Pearl, who
was abducted Jan. 23 while investigating suspected links between "shoe
bomber" Reid and Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Sheikh's father, Saeed Ahmad Sheikh, insisted that his son was
innocent.</TE>
<TE>   Saeed Ahmad Sheikh said his son rescued a woman in 1992 after she fell
on a London railway line.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a very proper type of a person," Sheikh's father told reporters
before Friday's hearing. "A person who has a record of saving someone's
life cannot take other lives."</TE>

<HD>Russia Admits Abuses Occur in Chechnya Raids</HD>
<DH>Caucasus: Military leaders issue guidelines and acknowledge the
problem of 'disappearances.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW
</DL>
<LD>In the first broad effort to curb "disappearances" and other abuses
in occupied Chechnya, Russian military leaders issued new instructions
ordering troops to treat civilians politely, identify themselves during
raids and keep public records of all detainees, officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   In announcing the new rules, known as Order 80, the commander of
Russia's armed forces in the separatist republic acknowledged for the
first time that disappearances are an endemic problem.</LD>
<LD>   "We are raising the responsibility of all officials so people will not
go missing without a trace," said Lt. Gen. Vladimir Moltenskoi, who
signed the order. "There are facts showing that innocent or
not-so-innocent people have gone missing during special
operations--either through the fault of individual commanders or others
who conducted these operations."</LD>
<TE>   Human rights groups welcomed Moltenskoi's comments. But they cautioned
that it remains to be seen whether the new rules will increase military
accountability or whether--coming more than two years after the
occupation began--they are too little too late.</TE>
<TE>   "All of this has been promised before, and most of it is already in
Russian law," said Diederik Lohman, director of the Moscow office of New
York-based Human Rights Watch. "You can produce laws and decrees, but in
the end it all comes down to implementation. Right now, soldiers and
officers don't really feel there is a real chance they will be prosecuted
if they break the law."</TE>
<TE>   Human rights groups and Chechen civilians have long complained about
so-called document sweeps or "mopping up" operations in which Russian
troops go door to door interrogating and detaining men they suspect of
having links to rebels. Military officials said they have changed tactics
and now conduct only "targeted" special operations.</TE>
<TE>   Lohman noted that after several controversial sweeps last summer,
Moltenskoi ordered that military officials give local civilian
authorities a list of all people detained in such operations. However,
Human Rights Watch has documented the disappearance of more than 50
people since then.</TE>
<TE>   "We've found there is a selective approach to recording those
detained," Lohman said. "The only people on the list are the people
who've been released."</TE>
<TE>   Under the new rules, soldiers entering a household are required to
identify themselves and their rank and state the reason for the search.
Civilian legal authorities, clergy and journalists are allowed to
observe. Lists of those detained must be delivered to local authorities
along with information about their place of confinement. And, except in
rare instances, soldiers are not allowed to wear ski masks or otherwise
disguise themselves. Their vehicles must carry registration numbers.</TE>
<TE>   "[The order] stresses that internal investigations and those by
prosecutors have revealed facts of looting, verbal abuses, rudeness and
abuse of power on the part of federal servicemen," said Sergei
Yastrzhembsky, an aide to President Vladimir V. Putin.</TE>
<TE>   Russian troops entered Chechnya in 1999 after rebels, who had
controlled the republic since 1996, were blamed for a series of bombings
that killed about 300 people in Russia. Since then, the military has
reoccupied nearly the entire republic, and it conducts frequent
operations to find rebels hiding amid the civilian population.</TE>
<TE>   Yastrzhembsky said Russian authorities have done their best to
investigate reported abuses: 33 servicemen have been convicted of various
crimes, and 62 others face trial, 12 of them on murder charges.</TE>
<TE>   However, human rights groups say Russian authorities have dragged
their feet in many of the investigations and that the number of
prosecutions is a small fraction of the number of cases documented.</TE>
<TE>   Yastrzhembsky accused Human Rights Watch and other groups of relying
on unverified information. And Vsevolod Chernov, the chief prosecutor in
Chechnya, insisted again Friday that uniformed gunmen who commit abuses
are actually Chechen rebels disguised as Russian soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   Human rights groups have questioned such assertions, noting that many
of the troops arrive in armored vehicles, and that any armored vehicles
belonging to rebel forces were destroyed early on in the conflict.</TE>
<TE>   The human rights group Memorial described the new rules as meeting
their "minimal demands."</TE>
<TE>   "If Order 80 is implemented and observed, it could help prevent many
serious crimes against peaceful residents of Chechnya and significantly
improve the human rights situation . . . " the group said in a statement.
"However, serious improvement will only occur if wide-scale 'sweep'
operations are curbed."</TE>

<HD>Taiwan Grapples With Leaks on Official Slush Fund</HD>
<DH>Asia: Revelations could hobble island's discreet style of
diplomacy. They also raise the issue of accountability.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TYLER MARSHALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TAIPEI, Taiwan
</DL>
<LD>Publication of leaked documents detailing how Taiwan's leaders used
a huge slush fund to buy influence and favors abroad has rocked this
fledgling democracy.</LD>
<LD>   The revelations focus mainly on how then-President Lee Teng-hui and a
handful of trusted aides handed out money to finance diplomatic
initiatives large and small--from trying to influence major decisions in
Washington, to apparent espionage efforts in China, to funding research
at Harvard University by a Taiwan-friendly former senior Japanese defense
official.</LD>
<LD>   Airing of such details is potentially devastating for Taiwan's
discreet, money-driven style of diplomacy. But the existence of a largely
unsupervised fund of about $100 million at the island's main intelligence
arm, the National Security Bureau, also has exposed a gaping hole in
accountability for public funds.</LD>
<TE>   A clumsy police raid to try to halt the hard-edged weekly Next from
publishing the revelations early last week added to the scandal's impact,
threatening further damage to Taiwan's image abroad and unleashing an
intense debate at home about the limits of press freedom.</TE>
<TE>   Exactly who leaked the incriminating documents and why remain a
mystery. Some theorize that disgruntled intelligence officials were
trying to embarrass their masters in revenge for efforts by President
Chen Shui-bian's government to bring them to heel. Others believe that
the move is part of a high-stakes fight between political factions
jostling for advantage in the run-up to the next presidential election,
in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Jimmy Lo, a member of a Taiwanese parliamentary faction loyal to Lee,
blames Beijing.</TE>
<TE>   "China is behind this," he said in an interview. "They want all these
secret ties to be exposed."</TE>
<TE>   So far, however, there are few definitive clues.</TE>
<TE>   "I not only don't have a theory myself but don't even know if the
intelligence community knows what's going on," said Bi-khim Hsiao, a
respected member of parliament from Chen's ruling Democratic Progressive
Party.</TE>
<TE>Efforts to Contain Leaks Prove Futile</TE>
<TE>   Despite the government's attempt to suppress the leaks, information
continues to dribble out, much of it now carried in media outside Taiwan.
Thursday's editions of the Hong Kong daily Sing Tao, for example, carried
details of a document detailing a September 1998 meeting in Taipei
between Lee and Gerald Cassidy, head of the Washington-based political
consultancy Cassidy &amp; Associates.</TE>
<TE>   Taiwan is believed to have paid several million dollars to the firm to
represent its interests in Washington. According to Next magazine, the
money used was interest on the slush fund account.</TE>
<TE>   The scandal has compromised Taiwan's ability to continue lobbying
quietly and effectively in key foreign capitals. Pursuing such a
diplomatic strategy is crucial to the island, which is formally isolated
from most of the world community because of pressure from Beijing.
Communist China insists that Taiwan is an errant province that belongs
under mainland control.</TE>
<TE>   The publicity associated with the slush fund revelations is unwelcome
to those who have dealings with Taipei, because they prefer their ties to
be confidential to avoid risking Beijing's wrath.</TE>
<TE>   "The greatest damage is the breach of mutual trust," Hsiao said. "Many
of those involved in some way with the Taiwan government in a completely
legal yet confidential way will now be unsure. This will have a major
effect."</TE>
<TE>   Noted a diplomat based in Taipei, the Taiwanese capital, who spoke on
condition of anonymity: "Whoever's behind this has really hurt Taiwan.
Whether they get caught and charged is almost irrelevant at this point.
The bottom-line loser here is Taiwan's unofficial diplomacy."</TE>
<TE>   The police raid on Next's editorial and printing facilities could also
backfire diplomatically, mainly because so much of the international
goodwill enjoyed by Taiwan stems from its successful transition during
the last 15 years from authoritarianism to democracy.</TE>
<TE>   Chen's conciliatory response to a letter from the New York-based
Committee to Protect Journalists protesting the magazine raid has been
viewed as an attempt to ease worries about a possible press crackdown.
Next executive Mark Simon condemned the raid as "a thinly veiled attempt
to suppress the stench of scandal in the name of national security."</TE>
<TE>   National Security Bureau officials told some members of parliament
earlier in the week that computer disks containing copies of the
documents detailing the slush fund activities were mailed to Next
magazine; a security bureau employee; and two members of parliament from
the People First Party, who had earlier accused the intelligence bureau
of keeping secret funds.</TE>
<TE>   The large-circulation daily China Times also obtained a copy of the
documents and printed a story about their content last week. The paper
was not raided by police, but its editor in chief, Huang Ching-lung is
under investigation on charges of breaching national security.</TE>
<TE>   Next reporter Hsieh Chung-liang faces a similar charge. He was
questioned for an hour Thursday by authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Assertions in the media include Next magazine's report that Lee
dispatched an industrialist to lobby former Japanese Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto "with cash" to press the United States to deploy
American aircraft carriers to the area in 1996 after relations between
Beijing and Taipei deteriorated sharply. The Hong Kong newspaper Sing Tao
reported that Hashimoto received what it called a $10,000 "gift coupon"
approved by Lee.</TE>
<TE>   Sing Tao also reported that Lee authorized the National Security
Bureau to fund a two-year research project at Harvard undertaken by
Japan's Masahiro Akiyama, a former deputy defense minister perceived to
be friendly to Taiwan.</TE>
<TE>   Next also reported that slush fund money went to five mainland Chinese
trading companies, implying that the money was used for spying.</TE>
<TE>   Many countries supplement conventional diplomacy by hiring influential
experts to promote their causes and lending financial backing to
supportive academic work. Neither Sing Tao nor Next claimed that
foreigners named in their reports acted illegally.</TE>
<TE>Work to Establish an Oversight Committee</TE>
<TE>   Those who monitor affairs here see a positive side to the scandal.
They believe that the revelations are likely to put an end to slush funds
and that parliament has already begun work to establish an oversight
committee to monitor Taiwan's intelligence community--something the
island's young democracy has never had.</TE>
<TE>   There also is a move to introduce a system of classifying government
documents by sensitivity, ending the long-standing practice that any
document not issued to the public is viewed as secret.</TE>
<TE>   "In the old days, there was no record at all of any intelligence funds
because they were treated by Chiang [Kai-shek, Taiwan's first president]
as his pocket money," Justice Minister Chen Ting-nan said in an
interview. "There's been a lot of progress since then, and we'll see more
soon."</TE>

<HD>Serbia Says War Crimes Suspects to Face Arrest</HD>
<DH>Balkans: The prime minister warns that the Yugoslav republic risks
sanctions. Action is expected within days.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia
</DL>
<LD>Serbia could begin arresting war crimes suspects within days, its
prime minister said Friday, stressing that it has little choice if it
wants to avoid punishing sanctions and international isolation.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. Congress has given Yugoslavia until Sunday to cooperate with
the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague or risk losing $120 million in
financial aid. Serbia is the main Yugoslav republic.</LD>
<LD>   "If we do not cooperate, we could face international isolation and
U.S. sanctions, literally within days," Serbian Prime Minister Zoran
Djindjic warned.</LD>
<TE>   Arrests, he said, could come "within three to four days," sending a
signal to the 15 suspects hiding in Serbia that they no longer can expect
to find safe haven there.</TE>
<TE>   The suspects include one of the tribunal's most-wanted fugitives: Gen.
Ratko Mladic, the wartime military leader of the Bosnian Serbs. He was
indicted on a charge of genocide in 1995 along with former Bosnian Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic.</TE>
<TE>   Vladan Batic, Serbia's justice minister, said Friday that the
republic's police were ready to make arrests.</TE>
<TE>   But Batic also sent an open letter to the U.N. Security Council and
U.S. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell demanding that ethnic Albanian
militants who committed atrocities against Serbs in Kosovo, a Serbian
province, also be indicted for war crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Serbian authorities have long been criticized for their refusal to
cooperate with the tribunal, which many in Belgrade see as anti-Serb.</TE>
<TE>   That attitude must end, Djindjic warned, or Yugoslavia will forfeit
"millions of dollars, the International Monetary Fund, standby deals, the
World Bank . . . everything that has to do with European integration."</TE>

<HD>Asylum Seekers Escape in Australia</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>WOOMERA, Australia
</DL>
<LD>As many as 20 asylum seekers, including a child, escaped from an
Australian detention center Friday by scaling fences topped with razor
wire or cutting holes with bolt cutters thrown to them by protesters
outside.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities recaptured 12 refugees after the escape, which occurred
amid clashes between police and demonstrators at the Woomera Detention
Center in central Australia.</LD>
<LD>   Inside the center, detainees flung chairs, rocks, bedposts and garbage
bins at staff, who responded with tear gas, Immigration Department
spokesman Paul Oliver told Associated Press.</LD>
<TE>   The search for the remaining fugitives continued Friday night. Oliver
gave no details of how or where the 12 were recaptured.</TE>
<TE>   About 300 mostly Afghan and Iraqi asylum seekers are being held at the
center. The demonstrators were protesting Australia's policy of detaining
all refugees who arrive illegally in the country.</TE>
<TE>   One escaping refugee dashed through a hole in a fence with both arms
raised, yelling: "Freedom! Freedom!" She was immediately tackled by a
security guard, but protesters wrestled her free and she ran off.</TE>
<TE>   Another refugee ran out shouting, "After two years I'm free!"</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for No One Is Illegal, one of about 20 groups involved
in the protest, said one of the escapees, an Iranian woman, had taken
shelter in a protester's tent surrounded by hundreds of demonstrators to
prevent her recapture.</TE>
<TE>   "They are demanding that her visa be processed and that she be freed,"
protester Andrea Maksimovic told Reuters.</TE>
<TE>   "Police are trying to negotiate with us, but I think they are just
biding their time until reinforcements arrive and then they'll do a clean
sweep of the camp," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The refugees escaped by scrambling over the razor fences around the
center, and they appeared afterward to be bleeding. Protesters
immediately put new clothes on the escapees and whisked them away from
police, who then began scuffling with rioters.</TE>
<TE>   Ten police officers on horseback rode into the crowd in an attempt to
quell the escalating violence. As they did, more refugees broke out, some
of them escaping through holes in the fences.</TE>
<TE>   Oliver said 15 to 20 people escaped. Speaking by telephone from the
center, he said one security officer suffered minor injuries from gravel
thrown in his face.</TE>
<TE>   The clashes subsided Friday night, and the protesters drifted away
from the camp. But unrest continued inside the center, Oliver said. More
protests were planned for the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Under Australia's detention policy, refugees, including young
children, are locked up until their asylum applications are dealt with--a
process that can take three years. The Woomera detention center has often
been the scene of hunger strikes by refugees.</TE>
<TE>   The policy of mandatory detention has broad public and bipartisan
political support in Australia, and the conservative government's tough
stand against illegal immigration was seen as a key factor in its
third-term election victory in November.</TE>
<TE>   Australia accepts more than 10,000 U.N.-approved refugees for
resettlement each year.</TE>

<HD>Holy Week Highlights Pope's Suffering</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ROME
</DL>
<LD>Pope John Paul II, not strong enough to walk with a cross in the
Good Friday procession, stood as the ceremony neared its end and, for a
few minutes, held the cross that had been carried by other celebrants.</LD>
<LD>   Stooped, trembling and often grimacing in pain, John Paul's suffering
was evident.</LD>
<LD>   But the pontiff has insisted on officiating at Easter ceremonies, and
the Vatican is setting up a special altar in St. Peter's Basilica to
avoid having him climb steps, an aide said.</LD>
<TE>   In keeping with a Good Friday tradition, John Paul spent an hour in
the Basilica hearing confessions from people of various nationalities
chosen from the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   On Holy Thursday, in a sharp break with tradition, John Paul let two
cardinals perform the ritual washing and kissing of the feet of priests,
which symbolizes humility. On Palm Sunday and in ceremonies Thursday, the
pope sat on the side while a cardinal celebrated Mass.</TE>
<TE>   John Paul, who became the Roman Catholic pontiff in 1978, suffers a
Parkinson's disease-like tremor and has had difficulty walking since hip
surgery in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   The ongoing decrease in his strength and stamina has been dramatic.
Just a year ago, the pope was able to move down a line of a dozen
priests, pouring water on each man's right foot from a golden pitcher,
wiping them dry and bringing the feet to his lips.</TE>
<TE>   Cheers of "Viva il papa!" and strong applause resounded from the
faithful when the pope blessed them. Instead of reading a closing speech,
the pope offered improvised reflections on the suffering of Jesus.</TE>

<HD>Lindh Said to Know of Attack Plans Separate From Sept. 11</HD>
<DH>Investigation: An e-mail from the 'American Talib' to his mother in
California is among court documents filed by the U.S. government.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD A. SERRANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Days before he allegedly joined a terrorist training camp run by
Osama bin Laden, John Walker Lindh told his mother that he would not
return to California because "I don't intend to leave Pakistan until I
finish what I came here for."</LD>
<LD>   The e-mail does not directly show that Lindh, 21, conspired to murder
Americans, as U.S. authorities have charged, or that he had prior
knowledge of the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the
Pentagon.</LD>
<LD>   But the computer message, released Friday by federal prosecutors,
provides a window into Lindh's state of mind last spring. Shortly after
he sent the e-mail, prosecutors said, Lindh joined a terrorist training
camp and met Bin Laden, part of what they called his "effort to go on a
jihad."</LD>
<TE>   The April 5 e-mail was included in government documents responding to
legal motions filed recently by Lindh's defense team, which has sought to
remake him as a religious wanderer seeking out the Muslim faith rather
than someone conspiring to kill Americans.</TE>
<TE>   To further bolster its case, the government also released portions of
statements that Lindh made to U.S. investigators after his arrest last
fall.</TE>
<TE>   While Lindh said he was "very ashamed at the high death toll" on Sept.
11, he admitted he had been told of plans for three separate attacks on
the U.S. but did nothing to alert America, government lawyers said.</TE>
<TE>   They also strongly rebutted defense assertions that Lindh was tortured
and held in dirty, inhumane conditions after his arrest. Rather, they
said, he was fed, clothed and housed as well as or better than the U.S.
military personnel who arrested him.</TE>
<TE>   For example, prosecutors said, "while the Navy physician who was
treating him had to sleep on a concrete floor in a sleeping bag in a room
with a hole in the wall and a hole in the ceiling, Lindh slept on a
stretcher in a container that protected him from the elements."</TE>
<TE>   When his case goes to trial in August, a federal jury must decide
whether Lindh became an enemy of the U.S. or was simply a Taliban soldier
fighting the Northern Alliance.</TE>
<TE>   In a message to Lindh, his mother, Marilyn Walker, had pleaded with
him to return home to Marin County for a visit. But her son made it clear
in his e-mail that he was determined to stay in Central Asia.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what I can say to you to make you realize that what I'm
doing here is serious," he wrote her. "I came here to Pakistan for a
specific purpose. I don't intend to leave Pakistan until I finish what I
came here for, just as I didn't leave Yemen until I finished what I went
there for."</TE>
<TE>   Lindh's lawyers maintain that he was studying the Muslim faith, and
that he never became a supporter of Bin Laden or terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   But government lawyers took the opposite view. By May 1, they said,
Lindh had entered a terrorist training camp where he "embraced the
Taliban." "Lindh had long abandoned his family in his effort to go on a
jihad," prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   There is no evidence that Lindh helped plan the Sept. 11 attacks. But
the government, in seeking to have him imprisoned for life, contends that
he conspired with other terrorists to murder Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said Lindh was so aware of the hatred for Americans that
he claimed he was "Irish and not American because he thought it would be
safer for him" in the Al Qaeda training camp.</TE>
<TE>   Later, after he surrendered to the Northern Alliance and was arrested
by U.S. troops, Lindh "stated that he heard . . . from talk around the
camp that America was supposed to be attacked three different times."</TE>
<TE>   The government released other "highly incriminating" statements Lindh
allegedly made after his arrest.</TE>
<TE>   He told his captors that it had been a mistake for Bin Laden and Al
Qaeda to attack governments that are supported by the United States.
Rather, the government said, Lindh advised that "it was more effective to
attack the head of the snake"--a reference to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   He also stated that he "understood the strategy" behind bombings of
American embassies, naval ships and military installations.</TE>
<TE>   Lindh told U.S. investigators that he "understood the mission of many
who attended the camps was to engage in, among other things, suicide
operations in the United States and Israel, and to fight on the front
lines with the Taliban," prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   "Thus," they added, "the meaning of the word 'terrorism' is no mystery
to the defendant."</TE>
<TE>   But prosecutors also released statements from Lindh that might help
his case.</TE>
<TE>   Lindh "related he didn't understand why [Al Qaeda] bombed the World
Trade Center," according to the government's filing. He also said that
"when he heard about the World Trade Center bombing, he was very ashamed
due to the high death toll."</TE>
<TE>   The government also rejected the defense assertion that Lindh was
"tortured" by his U.S. captors--kept naked inside a metal container, for
instance, to make him talk.</TE>
<TE>   "We take this opportunity to correct the record," prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   Lindh, who had been wounded in the leg before he was arrested, was
immediately given medical treatment, antibiotics, morphine and Valium,
the government said.</TE>
<TE>   "Lindh was then taken back to the same residence where the Special
Forces personnel were staying and was given a bed in which to sleep, food
to eat and water to drink," prosecutors said. His diet was said to have
included "calorie-rich" food and sweets such as lemon poundcake, fudge
brownies and bubble gum.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said Lindh was placed in the metal container for his own
safety and well-being.</TE>
<TE>   "His ragged clothing was removed, he was searched, and he was then
placed in a large metal container, where he was initially secured to a
stretcher," prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   "Within an hour or two, he was wrapped in two comforters for warmth.
He was given plenty of water. Within two days, he was provided medical
scrubs and was released from the stretcher."</TE>
<TE>   The government said Lindh was given the same type of ready-to-eat
meals provided to U.S. soldiers, as well as haircuts, a Koran and the
location of Mecca so he would know in which direction to pray.</TE>

<HD>Bids Pour in for Hijacker's 2 Rental Cars</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>POMPANO BEACH, Fla.
</DL>
<LD>Two rental cars driven by terrorist Mohamed Atta before the Sept.
11 attacks are for sale, attracting offers up to $250,000, the vehicles'
owner said.</LD>
<LD>   James P. Glynn said he has received bids from dealers in collectible
cars and museums--and one person who wanted to charge people to
sledgehammer the white 1995 Ford Escort and 1996 faded-blue Chevrolet
Corsica.</LD>
<LD>   Glynn, owner of Fedtrust Liquidators, said he would only consider
legitimate collectors or museums, and would donate the proceeds to the
American Legion and the Florida Sheriff's Youth Ranch Program.</LD>
<TE>   "At some point, whether it's the Smithsonian or another museum . . .
there will be a format where these vehicles can be displayed without it
being a carnival," Glynn said.</TE>
<TE>   The cars have been advertised on the company's Web site but were not
among the vehicle listings Friday. A spokeswoman said she expected they
would be posted again.</TE>
<TE>   Glynn bought the vehicles in January from car rental owner Brad
Warrick, who placed them in storage for four months after they were
returned by the FBI in their investigation of the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people had a lot of negative feelings about those cars,"
Warrick said. "It was time to part with them."</TE>

<HD>Powell Puts Blame on Palestinian Terror</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Secretary of State says he understands the Israeli
response. But he reiterates that Arafat is a legitimate leader and is key
to a cease-fire.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>As Israeli tanks rumbled through the compound of Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat on Friday, Secretary of State Colin L.
Powell placed the blame for the latest Mideast upheaval squarely on
Palestinian terrorists. But he said the United States will forge ahead
with its latest diplomatic effort to work out a cease-fire.</LD>
<LD>   "Let's be clear about what brought it all to a halt: terrorism,"
Powell said in an appearance at the State Department. "Terrorism . . .
has dealt a serious blow to the effort to achieve a cease-fire."</LD>
<LD>   Powell also made clear, however, that despite Israeli Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon's wrath toward Arafat, the Bush administration continues to
view Arafat as the legitimate leader of the Palestinians and a figure who
can contribute to bringing about peace.</LD>
<TE>   "Chairman Arafat is the leader of the Palestinian people, and his
leadership is now even more central to trying to find a way out of this
tragic situation," Powell said.</TE>
<TE>   Powell urged Arafat to end the wave of suicide bombings that have
killed 25 this week alone. He said the Israeli response was
understandable, and though he advised caution, there was no U.S. call for
Israel to withdraw its tanks and troops from Arafat's compound.</TE>
<TE>   "While we understand the Israeli government's need to respond to these
acts of terror and the right of the Israeli government to decide what
actions best serve the interests of the Israeli people, we call on Prime
Minister Sharon to carefully consider the consequences," Powell said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very difficult situation. Israel is trying to defend itself,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Seeking to deflect criticism that the Bush administration has not been
fully engaged in settling the conflict, Powell listed signs of recent
progress and insisted that the two sides had been approaching agreement
before the latest suicide bombings disrupted the talks.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a process moving forward. We have some successes over the past
week or two," Powell said. "And then, suddenly, the bombing of the night
before last, the bombing again today, the random shootings--all done by
terrorists who do not want to see peace."</TE>
<TE>   President Bush, on vacation in Texas, had no comment on the situation,
though aides said he was talking with national security officials. White
House officials believe it would serve no purpose to have Bush appear
publicly while events are fluid and murky, aides said. They added that he
might have something to say over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Powell said that despite the spike in violence, the administration's
Mideast envoy, retired Marine Corps Gen. Anthony C. Zinni, would remain
in the region to press for the U.S. peace initiative. He said the
administration was considering every alternative but that he himself
would go to the Middle East "only when there is a reason to go."</TE>
<TE>   Aides said Powell talked by phone Friday with Sharon, Arafat and U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, among others.</TE>
<TE>   Some commentators sympathetic to the Palestinians faulted Powell for
failing to criticize the Israeli push into the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   "To the Palestinians, it looks like the United States has sided almost
entirely with the Israelis," Edward G. Abington Jr., a former U.S.
diplomat and advisor to the Palestinians, told CNN.</TE>
<TE>   But some analysts said the administration was probably reluctant to be
seen as pressuring Israel after the carnage of the last few days.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a sense of outrage and sympathy at this latest Passover eve
bombing," said Philip C. Wilcox Jr., a former U.S. diplomat in Israel who
is president of the Foundation for Middle East Peace, a Washington think
tank. "Perhaps the Americans didn't think this was the time to lean on
the Israelis."</TE>
<TE>   Wilcox said Powell's words suggested that the fundamental approach of
the Bush administration remains unchanged. The administration clearly
still believes that the focus must be on halting terrorist bombings as
the first step toward a cease-fire, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In his comments, Powell sought to build a case that there has been
movement toward peace in recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   He pointed out that Arab League leaders this week voted for a Saudi
Arabia peace proposal that would give Israel acceptance by its Arab
neighbors in return for a withdrawal to its pre-1967 borders and other
concessions.</TE>
<TE>   He noted that earlier this month, the United Nations passed a Security
Council resolution introduced by the United States that called for a
Palestinian state.</TE>
<TE>   Powell also maintained that Sharon had shown "a great deal of
flexibility" in negotiations over a cease-fire plan laid out by CIA
Director George J. Tenet.</TE>
<TE>   "In recent weeks, there was a cause for guarded optimism," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The secretary urged other world leaders to join in calling for an end
to the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "At this critical moment, we call on our friends throughout the
international community to condemn terror unequivocally," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But some important U.S. allies were critical of Israel. The European
Union's foreign policy chief, Javier Solana, urged Israel to look for a
nonmilitary solution.</TE>
<TE>   "Military means are not going to solve the problem of terrorism," said
Cristina Gallach, a Solana spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   France demanded an Israeli withdrawal from Arafat's compound and
insisted that "Israeli authorities respect the security and the physical
integrity of Mr. Arafat," in the words of a Foreign Ministry spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Russian Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov said Israel's announced
intention to isolate Arafat "is not the way that could help find a
political solution to the current situation."</TE>
<TE>   Bush spent the day at his ranch in Crawford, Texas. By midmorning,
said Gordon Johndroe, a White House spokesman, the president had
conferred several times by telephone with Powell and Condoleezza Rice,
national security advisor.</TE>
<TE>   Johndroe said Bush also convened a meeting of the National Security
Council, which met using a secure videoconference hookup for more than an
hour.</TE>

<DH>Mideast: Raid on Arafat's complex is denounced. Leaders call for
international intervention.</DH>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>BEIRUT
</DL>
<LD>From streets choked with tear gas to presidential and royal
palaces, Arabs across the Middle East condemned the Israeli attack on
Yasser Arafat's headquarters Friday, saying the Jewish state prefers
aggression to peace.</LD>
<LD>   Palestinian refugees protested in Lebanon, Jordan and Syria, burning
tires or meeting truncheons and water cannon blasts with chants of "Death
to Israel!" while political leaders framed Israel's offensive as a
rejection of an Arab peace overture and urged international intervention.</LD>
<LD>   "This is not only against Arafat, it is against the peace plan
submitted by the Arabs," said Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri,
referring to a Saudi peace proposal endorsed Thursday by the Arab League
at a summit in Beirut. The Arab nations offered Israel peace and normal
relations in exchange for a withdrawal from territory it seized in 1967
and other concessions.</LD>
<TE>   Lebanon's information minister, Ghazi Aridi, accused Israeli Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon of aiming to "bring down the Palestinian Authority
and reoccupy all the Arab lands."</TE>
<TE>   Arab leaders held telephone conversations with Arafat, the Palestinian
Authority president, who was inside his besieged compound in the West
Bank city of Ramallah.</TE>
<TE>   "Sharon has declared war, a war that he cannot win because the will of
the people is stronger than the Israeli tanks," Egyptian Foreign Minister
Ahmed Maher said.</TE>
<TE>   King Abdullah II of Jordan accused Israel of escalating the violence
and threatening Arafat's life and said the Jewish state had violated all
international conventions, the official Jordanian news agency reported.
The monarch telephoned Arafat earlier Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak sent an urgent message to President
Bush calling for immediate American intervention, Egyptian state media
reported. Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa, also an Egyptian,
called Arafat, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, European Union foreign
policy chief Javier Solana and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan. Annan
convened an emergency session of the U.N. Security Council to discuss the
crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Moussa said the Arab League would hold a meeting in Cairo today to
discuss what steps Arab states can take.</TE>
<TE>   Iranian radio quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi as
saying, "The occupation of Ramallah today is another example of the state
terrorism of the Zionist regime."</TE>
<TE>   In many Arab countries, TV images of Israeli forces entering Ramallah
added to the anger against Israel, already heightened after 18 months of
Israeli-Palestinian violence.</TE>
<TE>   In Egypt, state-run television preempted its regular programming to
follow developments in the Palestinian territories. Pan-Arab satellite TV
network Al Jazeera broadcast footage of the raids on the compound.</TE>
<TE>   At entrances to the Ein el Hilwa refugee camp in southern Lebanon,
Palestinians burned tires in protest. A general strike closed shops and
schools, and thousands of angry Palestinians shouted anti-Israel slogans
and waved Palestinian flags.</TE>
<TE>   In Jordan, Palestinian refugees in two camps near Amman, the capital,
called for holy war and for the removal of the Israeli ambassador. Riot
police threw tear gas canisters at hundreds of protesters at one camp.</TE>
<TE>   Syrian police used water cannons and truncheons to prevent about 2,000
Palestinian protesters in the Yarmouk refugee camp near Damascus, the
capital, from marching toward the U.S. Embassy.</TE>
<TE>   And in a peaceful protest, about 1,000 Palestinian supporters marched
through Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, chanting, "Death to Israel!"</TE>

<DL>PARIS
</DL>
<LD>The 15 European Union nations collectively protested Israel's
attack on Yasser Arafat's West Bank headquarters Friday, with Italy
pressing Israel to guarantee the Palestinian Authority president's
safety.</LD>
<LD>   The EU also called on Israel to withdraw its troops from the West Bank
city of Ramallah, where Arafat's complex is located.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, the EU urged the Palestinian Authority to halt the
"spiral of violence" and punish those responsible for the recent string
of attacks on Israelis.</LD>
<TE>   Spain, which holds the rotating EU presidency, said Israel's fight
against terrorism and its response to recent attacks must be compatible
with safeguarding the Palestinian Authority and its president--"the
legitimate representatives of the Palestinian people."</TE>
<TE>   In France, President Jacques Chirac said that "any attack on
[Arafat's] ability to act, or on his person, would be extremely serious."</TE>
<TE>   The French leader also urged Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon to "immediately take all measures to stop the violence."</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing can excuse or justify blind terrorism against civilians,"
Chirac told France Info radio. "Everyone knows there cannot be a military
solution to the conflict in the Middle East."</TE>
<TE>   French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine accused Israel of obsessing
over Arafat and trying to "asphyxiate" him.</TE>
<TE>   Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's government asked Israel to
guarantee Arafat's security and respect his elected position.</TE>
<TE>   It also said it had made a new appeal to the Palestinian Authority to
prevent acts of terrorism against unarmed civilians and to dismantle
terrorist structures.</TE>
<TE>   Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou condemned the Israeli
military action, saying his country had "ties, both friendly and
personal, with President Arafat."</TE>
<TE>   "For us, Arafat is not an enemy, and beyond this he is also a personal
friend," said Papandreou, who also condemned the terror attacks on
Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   About 1,500 Greek and Palestinian protesters chanting, "Freedom for
Palestine!" and banging steel drums gathered outside the Israeli Embassy
in Athens.</TE>

<HD>U.N. Members Express a Fear of All-Out War</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Security council is nearly unanimous in criticizing
latest Israeli action against Arafat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS
</DL>
<LD>The Security Council held an emergency meeting on the escalating
Middle East crisis Friday, with diplomats voicing fears that Israel's
assault on Yasser Arafat's headquarters could lead to all-out war.</LD>
<LD>   If Israel harmed Arafat, it would be "the mother of all mistakes," a
Palestinian official angrily declared.</LD>
<LD>   Israel's U.N. ambassador vigorously defended the military strike as a
justified response to terrorism. But almost all of the 28 other diplomats
who addressed the council Friday criticized the Israeli move for being
"dangerous and unwise," as Ireland's U.N. ambassador said in a comment
typical of the hastily convened Good Friday debate.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. officials blocked Arab efforts to have the Security Council
condemn the Israeli incursion, citing Secretary of State Colin L.
Powell's comments earlier in the day putting the blame for the clash on
Palestinian suicide bombers.</TE>
<TE>   "Terrorists have set back the vision of a Palestinian state that would
live in peace side by side with the state of Israel," said James B.
Cunningham, the deputy U.S. delegate to the U.N., echoing Powell.</TE>
<TE>   Cunningham, like Powell, condemned what he called Arafat's failure to
"bring the perpetrators to justice" and praised Israeli Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon for what he called his "flexibility" in cooperating with
U.S. cease-fire negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   But the U.S. representative tempered Powell's pro-Israel message by
deploring "the killing and wounding of innocent Palestinian civilians" in
the West Bank city of Ramallah, the site of Arafat's compound.</TE>
<TE>   "We understand that Israel has a right to self-defense, but we call on
Prime Minister Sharon and his government to carefully consider the
consequences of their actions," Cunningham said. "Chairman Arafat is the
leader of the Palestinian people, and his leadership is now and will be
central to any meaningful effort to restore calm. We have made it clear
to the Israeli government that he should not be harmed."</TE>
<TE>   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who spoke with Powell shortly after
returning from the region Friday morning, called on Israel to "halt the
assault on the Palestinian Authority." The destruction of Arafat's
fledgling government "will not bring peace; it will bring the region even
closer to war," Annan said in a statement issued before the Security
Council began its evening session.</TE>
<TE>   Annan did, however, reiterate his strong condemnation of recent
Palestinian suicide bombings.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand, in fact I share, the anger of the Israeli government
and people over these attacks," he told the council Friday night. "The
intention of such attacks, which I have consistently and unreservedly
condemned as morally repugnant, is to subvert the possibility of any
peaceful settlement. Terrorism will not bring the Palestinian people
closer to their long-deserved claim of the right to self-determination."</TE>
<TE>   But Israel should stop using "disproportionate lethal force and other
measures that violate international laws and standards in response to
terrorist attacks," Annan said.</TE>
<TE>   Israel's U.N. ambassador, Yehuda Lancry, dismissed criticism of his
government's military action, calling it an ethically and legally
defensible response to the terror attacks that have killed scores of
Israeli civilians in recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "As for Chairman Arafat, we want to send him the message that there is
no inviolable immunity for him as the mastermind of terrorism and
violence," Lancry said. Arafat "gave safe haven to dozens of Palestinian
terrorists" in his Ramallah compound, he charged.</TE>
<TE>   The United Nations had been closed for the Good Friday holiday, but
Arab nations demanded that the council meet immediately to discuss U.N.
intervention in the conflict. The formal request for the meeting came
from two of the more moderate Arab states: Jordan, representing the Arab
League, and Qatar, speaking for the larger Organization of the Islamic
Conference.</TE>
<TE>   The Arab diplomats said they had hoped an emergency session could
force Israel to withdraw its forces from Arafat's headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   "This is another mad Sharonic step that will ensure that the region
will be faced with more and more difficulties and more and more
bloodshed," said Nasser Kidwa, the Palestinians' chief U.N.
representative.</TE>
<TE>   Kidwa, who said he had spoken to Arafat by phone earlier in the day,
echoed fears in the region that the Israeli siege could lead to the
Palestinian leader's death, either deliberately or inadvertently.</TE>
<TE>   "We need our elected president to live," he said. "If the Israelis
choose to take the ultimate crazy step, I think this will be the mother
of all mistakes."</TE>
<TE>   But in closed-door consultations before the council's public debate,
the U.S. delegation distributed copies of Powell's statement, which
emphasized Israel's right to defend itself. The Powell message was a
clear signal, diplomats here said, that the United States would veto any
resolution critical of Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Arab diplomats decided to avoid a confrontation with Washington in
part, they said, because they did not want to undermine the impact of an
American-backed Security Council resolution just two weeks ago that for
the first time endorsed the creation of an independent Palestinian state
alongside Israel.</TE>
<TE>   For Arabs and others here, the submission and passage of Resolution
1397 marked an unexpected and welcome reversal of the Bush
administration's contention that the Security Council should avoid
substantive involvement in the conflict.</TE>

<HD>Harvard Gene Study in China Is Questioned</HD>
<DH>Ethics: U.S. officials accuse school of coercion in its research
among the country's rural poor. Work is suspended.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AARON ZITNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Federal officials on Friday issued a stinging rebuke of research
practices at Harvard University and raised questions about the ethics of
working with one of the world's most coveted caches of genetic
information: the rural population of China.</LD>
<LD>   Thanks to their isolation, the people of rural China have a genetic
uniformity that makes it easier to track disease genes. Researchers from
a variety of American institutions are working there to find the genetic
basis for obesity, hypertension, asthma and other ailments.</LD>
<LD>   But in letters Friday to two Harvard units, the federal Office for
Human Research Protections underscored the ethical pitfalls of working
with impoverished people in developing countries. Particularly in
authoritarian countries, these people might be easily coerced into
volunteering for research and yet unable to afford the new treatments
that result, the office said.</LD>
<TE>   The letters said that Harvard research supervisors failed in a variety
of ways to make sure that the rights of research participants were
protected.</TE>
<TE>   Consent forms often included complex language that rural Chinese
subjects would probably not understand, federal officials said.
Researchers in one study recruited thousands more volunteers than were
authorized. And supervisors failed to show that volunteers would benefit
in any way from the research they had participated in--a prime
consideration in deciding whether a research project is ethical.</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials had particular concerns about how researchers
navigated China's much-criticized law that limits most couples to having
a single child.</TE>
<TE>   In one asthma study, supervised by the Harvard-affiliated Brigham and
Women's Hospital, researchers sought out families that on average had
more than four children. Federal officials said they were "concerned"
that identifying these families "could have placed them at risk" with the
Chinese government for violating the one-child law.</TE>
<TE>   And in a study of lead levels in the blood, supervised by Harvard's
School of Public Health, researchers apparently asked women to
participate just as they were registering with the government to marry.
Federal officials said this might "possibly coerce the women into
enrolling [in the study] with the thought that it might improve their
chances for marriage or conception permission."</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, the Harvard School of Public Health said that "we
fully agree" with the thrust of the federal letter. But the school noted
that federal officials "found no instances of harm to any participants in
our studies."</TE>
<TE>   The school also said that the federal study of its practices prompted
it to make a variety of changes in the way it handled research
supervision. Among other things, it has added staff and begun shadowing
researchers to monitor how people are recruited for research studies.</TE>
<TE>   Brigham and Women's, in a statement, said that it also "understands
that no study participants were harmed and that the confidentiality of
the patients involved was maintained."</TE>
<TE>   "The pace and scope of international collaborative research is
increasing, so we will see more and more cases like this," said Eric
Meslin, director of the Indiana University Center for Bioethics. "When
the U.S. exports its research rules, the interpretation and application
get murkier the farther you get away from" the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Research institutions that take federal money are obliged to follow
federal rules aimed at protecting the people who volunteer for medical
experiments. An ethics board at each institution is supposed to review
all research to make sure volunteers are protected.</TE>
<TE>   But as research becomes more complex and international, the job of
these ethics boards has become more complex.</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials, for example, found that the Brigham and Women's
ethics board "lacked the background and expertise to review the
above-referenced research because of its apparent failure to consider the
cultural conditions, including the social, economic and political status
of the subject population."</TE>
<TE>   Violations of the federal rules can prompt federal officials to shut
down a research project. Harvard officials said that all the research in
question had been completed or suspended until all federal and university
questions were answered.</TE>
<TE>   In their letters, federal officials ordered the School of Public
Health and Brigham and Women's Hospital to provide an array of
information about their research in China, including how its supervision
of research had been improved. The letters said that both units had
already made a number of improvements that satisfied some of the
government's concerns.</TE>
<TE>   A third and similar letter went to the Massachusetts Mental Health
Center, requiring it to provide more information about two studies in
China.</TE>
<TE>   Twelve of the 14 Harvard studies drawing federal attention were
conducted by Dr. Xiping Xu, associate professor of occupational
epidemiology. Ten were conducted through the public health school and two
through the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Xu's work in China was the focus of an extensive report two years ago
in the Washington Post.</TE>
<TE>   The Harvard School of Public Health said that Xu was now required to
submit to a review of his research involving human subjects every three
to six months, instead of the usual 12. All of Xu's research involving
human subjects was suspended last August and will not resume until the
federal government and the school are satisfied that new oversight
procedures are in place, a school official said.</TE>
<TE>   Brigham and Women's said that Xu had told hospital reviewers that he
had taken measures "intended to ensure that participants were aware of
the risks and benefits of participation. The hospital has been and
continues to be engaged in addressing each of the issues cited by"
federal officials.</TE>

<HD>Student Debt Relief Divides Campus</HD>
<DH>Education: Missouri law school had sought to exclude graduates
joining the military because of its stance on gays. Faculty called
unpatriotic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS
</DL>
<LD>The letter writer did not mince words. "Have the faculty members
who endorsed this decision been on the planet Earth since 9/11?"</LD>
<LD>   The object of her scorn: the law professors at Washington University.
The reason: their decision to help pay off the student loans of graduates
who take jobs serving the public--unless those jobs are in the United
States military.</LD>
<LD>   In an effort to encourage more students to consider low-paying jobs
such as prosecuting criminals or advising nonprofit groups, the law
school faculty this month voted to help graduates in such "public
service" posts with their often-staggering student debt. But, on a 12-11
vote, they excluded graduates who go to work for any organization that
discriminates.</LD>
<TE>   And that, in their view, left out the military, which has ousted some
gays and lesbians from the ranks under the "don't ask, don't tell" policy
.</TE>
<TE>   The decision drew immediate fire. Irate alumni bombarded the dean's
office with complaints. Incensed veterans proclaimed themselves insulted.
Indignant letters filled the paper, calling the move "ludicrous,"
"disgraceful" and "downright anti-American." Even the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch editorial board, on most issues proudly liberal, declared
that the faculty had gone too far.</TE>
<TE>   The pressure was tremendous. And this week, law school Dean Joel
Seligman bowed to it. "This has been an agonizing issue," he said. "I
cannot overstate that." Then he announced that he was overruling the
faculty. The debt relief program, he declared, now would be open to
graduates entering the military.</TE>
<TE>   The response has been more anger.</TE>
<TE>   In a debate shadowed by the horror of Sept. 11, students and faculty
have been pressed to examine--and defend--their views on patriotism,
principle and justice. Many are finding that the sands have shifted: Even
on a liberal campus that for years has criticized the military's stance
on homosexuality, it's no longer considered politically correct to bash
the Pentagon. Not with a war on terrorism to be won.</TE>
<TE>   Some faculty are even fearful of speaking on the record, lest they
alienate their colleagues on the bitterly divided campus.</TE>
<TE>   Aftershocks of Sept. 11 "have colored this debate in a really
unfortunate way," said second-year student T.J. Hill, president of
Outlaw, the school's gay and lesbian organization.</TE>
<TE>   The fault lines run like this:</TE>
<TE>   Those who back the dean argue the need to treat all students equally,
whether they go to work for the Sierra Club, the district attorney or the
Army. It would have been hypocritical, they say, to discriminate against
aspiring military lawyers in the name of protesting discrimination. And
it would be unfair to punish students for a personnel policy set by
Congress and the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   "Just because someone is patriotic and opts to serve their country, I
don't think that in any way suggests that they personally want to
discriminate against homosexuals," said Randy Soriano, 32, a third-year
student who came to Washington University after serving in the Marines as
an infantry captain. "I sacrificed 7 1/2 years of my life to serve my
country. For the school to [imply] that's wrong . . . is a slap in the
face."</TE>
<TE>   Others counter that standing up for the rights of homosexuals must
trump any other consideration. A law school committed to justice, they
say, should not reward students who choose to work for an organization
that discriminates, whether it's the Ku Klux Klan or the Marines.
Even--or perhaps, especially--in this era of surging patriotism, they
argue that it's important to hold the government to task when its
policies seem unjust.</TE>
<TE>   "We wouldn't be tolerating this if it were about racial
discrimination" rather than discrimination based on sexual orientation,
said law professor Richard Kuhns. Excluding the military from the
program, he said, would have been "an important, if small, step making
the point that discrimination is wrong."</TE>
<TE>   The debate is, in many ways, a rerun. Last year, for the first time in
a decade, the law school allowed the military to recruit on campus--over
the fierce protests of many students and faculty. Administrators said
then that they had no choice: A new federal law threatened to yank funds
from any university that blocked the Defense Department from recruiting.</TE>
<TE>   This time around, there was a choice. But it was more about symbolism
than substance.</TE>
<TE>   On average, just five law school graduates a year go into the
military--out of a class of 200. Fewer still would qualify for debt
relief because their expected incomes of about $41,000 a year (including
benefits such as housing allowances) are relatively high for public
service jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Pete Milne, the law school's business manager, estimates that most
graduates taking jobs as military lawyers would be entitled to write off
at most $3,000 in debt each year for several years.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, students earning less than $25,000 a year could get their
entire loans forgiven. (Most graduates would fall somewhere in the
middle. The median starting salary for a public interest job is $34,000,
which would qualify a student to get half his debt waived.)</TE>
<TE>   But the amount of relief is not the point for Josh Girton, a
second-year student who hopes to serve as a Marine Corps lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   With tuition at Washington University topping $27,000 a year, Girton
expects to have "a ton" of debt by the time he graduates. He could make
the money to pay it off fairly quickly in private practice, where the
median starting salary is $80,000. But Girton is committed to the Marines
"out of a sense of indebtedness to my country," he said. So he was
stunned to learn that his professors did not deem the military a public
service job worthy of subsidy.</TE>
<TE>   "I was outraged," he said. "It was disrespectful."</TE>
<TE>   His classmate Hill could say the same--only he would be saying it
about the dean's decision to put the military back on the subsidy list.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very painful," he said. "For a few days, I was so proud to go to
a university that really stood by its principles. Now I see it's like any
other institution, subject to political pressure. It devalues my degree."</TE>

<HD>Smallpox Vaccine Gift to U.S.</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>MEGAN GARVEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A pharmaceutical company agreed Friday to donate more than 75
million doses of smallpox vaccine to the U.S. government, greatly
speeding federal health officials' goal of being able to vaccinate every
American in the event of an outbreak of the deadly disease.</LD>
<LD>   The doses had been stockpiled at the Swiftwater, Pa., branch of the
French vaccine maker Aventis Pasteur since the United States ended its
mandatory inoculation program in 1972. Federal health officials said they
believed the doses were potent but that they must undergo further
testing.</LD>
<LD>   "If we determine that the Aventis vaccine remains effective, we could
substantially boost our nation's smallpox vaccine stockpile at relatively
little cost to taxpayers," Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G.
Thompson said Friday. He called the additional doses "a huge insurance
policy."</LD>
<TE>   Smallpox was eradicated worldwide in the late 1970s but is considered
one of the most dangerous of potential bioterrorist threats, because U.S.
officials say they cannot be certain that former Soviet stockpiles of the
virus did not fall into the wrong hands. Officials believe such an attack
is unlikely.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. government last fall ordered 154 million additional smallpox
vaccine doses at a cost of $2.76 per dose from Acambis, a British
pharmaceutical company that had previously been contracted to provide 54
million doses of the vaccine by 2004 or 2005. All those doses now are
expected to be delivered by year's end.</TE>
<TE>   The announcement of the government's immediate access to additional
doses, valued by company officials at $150 million, comes a day after
federal health officials announced they would be able to successfully
dilute the existing 15.4 million doses in the U.S. stockpile, making it
possible to vaccinate five times as many people with the supply on hand.</TE>
<TE>   The Washington Post first reported the existence of the vaccine in
Thursday's editions, saying the Aventis stockpile has been "long
forgotten" in the company's freezers.</TE>
<TE>   A company spokesman, however, said the U.S. government has known about
the supply for years and the company offered the doses to federal
officials shortly after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Before the terrorist and anthrax attacks, Aventis had considered
destroying the supply.</TE>
<TE>   "Since mid-October, we have had numerous discussions with a number of
government agencies," said Aventis spokesman Len Lavenda. "This was not
stumbled upon, a janitor did not find it sweeping a hallway, but there
are a number of reasons it was not publicly exposed."</TE>
<TE>   Thompson said Friday that the existence of the Aventis stock was kept
quiet because federal officials did not want to raise expectations about
the available doses of the vaccine until they knew the 30-year-old
batches would work.</TE>
<TE>   Laboratory testing has already indicated the Aventis supply is as
effective as the vaccine already in the government's hands, officials
said, and clinical trials at the National Institutes of Health are
scheduled to begin shortly to confirm the vaccine's value before the
government acquires the supply.</TE>

<HD>Israel Corners a Defiant Arafat</HD>
<HD>'I Want to Be a Martyr,' Besieged Palestinian Chief Says</HD>
<DH>Mideast: The army seizes most of Ramallah and detains 95. Two
officers and five Palestinians are killed in gun battles in the city.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>Tossing stun grenades as they moved from room to room, Israeli
commandos blasted their way deep into Yasser Arafat's compound here
Friday until they had the Palestinian Authority president cornered. As he
sought cover from heavy fire, Arafat vowed that he would not be taken
alive.</LD>
<LD>   "They want me to be a hostage or a prisoner or a dead person," the
defiant Palestinian Authority president told an Arabic-language
television station. "I want to be a martyr, a martyr, a martyr."</LD>
<LD>   Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said he holds Arafat, his longtime
archenemy, responsible for a wave of suicide bombings that has killed
dozens of Israelis, including an attack on the opening night of Passover
that Israelis have called a watershed event. Arafat heads a "coalition of
terror," Sharon said Friday, that must be eliminated.</LD>
<TE>   Sharon said the offensive would last "weeks" and "know no borders."</TE>
<TE>   In a drama that unfolded throughout the day, Israeli tanks and
infantry seized almost all of Arafat's headquarters, cutting electricity
and phone lines, as part of what Sharon said would be a decisive,
far-reaching campaign to "isolate" Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   By nightfall, Arafat was confined to a couple of rooms, his aides
said, after troops moved in on him from the east and west. The Israeli
army said it had seized 95 people and a cache of weapons, including 25
fighters captured early today after an all-night gun battle. One of them,
the army said, was a senior member of Arafat's Fatah movement.</TE>
<TE>   Five Palestinians and two Israeli officers were killed in gun battles
around the compound and fighting elsewhere. Some of the dead and about 25
wounded were Arafat's bodyguards who tried to fight off the Israelis. The
casualties also included civilians.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials insisted that they don't intend to kill or capture
Arafat, and relayed those assurances to U.S. officials. But on the
ground, Palestinians were convinced that the opposite was true.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, while calling for Israeli
restraint in the attack on Arafat's headquarters, laid the blame on the
shoulders of Palestinian attackers.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's be clear about what brought it all to a halt: terrorism," he
said in Washington. "Terrorism . . . has dealt a serious blow to the
effort to achieve a cease-fire." But he said the United States will press
ahead with its latest diplomatic effort to work out a truce.</TE>
<TE>   It was not completely clear what Sharon planned to do with Arafat. At
the least, Sharon probably intends to humiliate the Palestinian leader in
the eyes of his people. Or he may be planning to expel Arafat, as many in
the Israeli government favor doing.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon and Arafat have battled each other for decades. In 1982, Sharon
led Israel's invasion of Lebanon in pursuit of Arafat, who then commanded
the Palestine Liberation Organization from Beirut. Sharon laid siege then
to Arafat's positions, eventually forcing him to escape to Tunisia--where
he regrouped and lived to fight another day.</TE>
<TE>   The destruction of the Ramallah compound, a blocklong collection of
white stone and brick buildings, is Israel's most direct assault yet on
Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they're trying to scare the Palestinian people to make us
raise the white flag of surrender," said Nidal Nafez, 32, one of the few
people who ventured out of their homes in Ramallah on Friday. "They're
saying, 'This is your leader and we can kill him.' . . . But it won't
work, because all of us have arrived at the point of no return."</TE>
<TE>   The reaction throughout the Arab world was equally harsh. Just one day
after Arab leaders endorsed a historic peace initiative at a summit in
Beirut, protesters took to the streets in Lebanon to denounce the Israeli
incursion. Lebanese President Emile Lahoud, the host of the summit, said
the Israeli action was a slap in the face to the Arab leaders who
attended.</TE>
<TE>   "Hours after the Arab peace initiative was issued from the Beirut
summit, Israel replied with a barbaric war and a flagrant and brutal
aggression," Lahoud said.</TE>
<TE>   Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah, who had offered up the peace initiative,
told reporters in Beirut that the raid was a "savage, despicable act, an
inhuman and cruel act."</TE>
<TE>   If Israel had hoped to stamp out terror with the military actions, it
did not succeed Friday. The latest suicide bomber was an 18-year-old
Palestinian woman from a refugee camp near Bethlehem.</TE>
<TE>   The woman, Hayat Akhras, walked to the entrance of a suburban
supermarket in Jerusalem, where Israelis were shopping just before the
advent of the Jewish Sabbath. A guard became suspicious and prevented her
from going inside. She blew herself up near the doorway, killing herself
and two other people. About 30 people suffered mostly minor injuries.</TE>
<TE>   One of the dead was apparently the guard who prevented wider tragedy.
He was a neighborhood fixture, heightening the fury over the attack.</TE>
<TE>   "I ran over to where the bomb went off, but there was no one to save,"
said Shay, a neighborhood kiosk vendor who gave only one name. "They come
to our stores and kill us. It's one-sided. We have to kill them now. If
Arafat can't control them, the army will have to take the territories
back."</TE>
<TE>   The Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, a militia linked to Arafat's Fatah
movement, claimed responsibility for Friday's bombing. Akhras was the
third female suicide bomber in the 18-month intifada against Israeli
rule.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials revealed Friday that the combat reserve call-up
announced the day before will involve at least 20,000 men and women, an
indication that the military operation begun Thursday night in Ramallah
will expand throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip and will be
wide-ranging and open-ended.</TE>
<TE>   It is the largest call-up in a decade, Israeli officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Busloads of men and women were already reporting for duty Friday at
sign-up centers across the country and bidding farewell to their spouses
and parents. The mass mobilization reminded many here of scenes from the
eve of the 1967 Middle East War.</TE>
<TE>   The scene in Ramallah was one of full-scale onslaught.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli forces used armored vehicles and bulldozers to punch holes
first in the perimeter walls of Arafat's compound and then in the sides
of buildings. Troops were searching office to office, room to room in the
two buildings that flank Arafat's offices on the eastern and western
sides. By late afternoon, they had moved to within spitting distance of
where Arafat sits.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat spent most of the day giving telephone interviews to
Arabic-language television stations and other news outlets and talking to
world leaders. Pictures showed him in a windowless room flanked by two
aides, a gun on the table in front of him.</TE>
<TE>   Although the focus was on Arafat's headquarters, Israeli forces had
seized control of most of the city. Israeli snipers took up positions on
rooftops in downtown Ramallah. Tanks rumbled through streets in almost
every neighborhood of the city that just two years ago was widely seen as
the prosperous, de facto capital of a Palestinian state.</TE>
<TE>   At downtown's Manara Square, armed Palestinians staked out corners and
lay in wait to ambush tanks that were as close as a block away.</TE>
<TE>   Soldiers also took over offices used by Palestinian and foreign media,
forcing several news organizations to abandon the premises.</TE>
<TE>   A Palestinian cameraman for an Egyptian television network was shot in
the face when Israeli troops opened fire on his van, which was marked
with signs saying "TV," witnesses said. In video footage by a passenger
in the van, the source of the fire was not clear.</TE>
<TE>   One of the dead Friday was an older, gray-haired man found in a fetal
position on a sidewalk near Arafat's compound. He had been shot twice and
apparently bled to death.</TE>
<TE>   Another was a fighter in camouflage fatigues, his head wrapped in a
checked kaffiyeh. He had fired wildly toward Israeli soldiers, then was
felled by a single bullet to the neck.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Music Awards Nurture the Grass-Roots</HD>
<DH>Ceremony:* Honoring area artists in 12 categories, the
first such show will benefit Big Brothers-Big Sisters. Sixty
contenders are competing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANDY LEWIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's not going to cure the post-Oscar blues for limo companies,
couture designers or jewelry makers, but the first Orange County
Music Awards today should provide a bit of recognition and community
spirit for the area's grass-roots musicians.</LD>
<LD>   "We decided not to go with any big production numbers," quipped
organizer Martin Brown, publisher of Live magazine and a journalist
who has been writing about the county's music scene for more than two
decades.</LD>
<LD>   Brown doesn't mind that the awards will be handed out in the
600-seat Galaxy Theatre in Santa Ana instead of in a spanking-new
$94-million home like the Oscars' Kodak Theatre.</LD>
<TE>   That's because Brown's goal has nothing to do with glitz or
glamour.</TE>
<TE>   "Orange County is a rich source of all different kinds of music,
but everyone's off doing their own thing," said Brown, whose partner
in putting the awards together is Allison Badger, producer of "Sound
Affects," a music show airing since the beginning of the year on
Orange County PBS-affiliate KOCE-TV Channel 50. "There's a jazz
scene, a hip-hop scene, a very vibrant blues scene and all the great
pop-rock bands we have, but there's not the sense of community, of
people working together toward a common goal of exposure for
musicians in this area."</TE>
<TE>   The acts that have gotten national and international exposure and
even a few Grammy nominations over the last decade aren't the ones
vying for Orange County Music Award trophies. The 60 contenders in 12
performance categories, running from jazz and punk-pop to indie roots
and world music, are, for the most part, musicians who still play
clubs and coffeehouses regularly. Two categories will recognize best
song and best out-of-county artist.</TE>
<TE>   Nominations come from a 20-member panel of print, radio and
television entertainment reporters, talent bookers from local clubs,
and promoters, who screened more than 100 CD bio-photo submissions.
All the categories and nominees are listed on the event's Web site,
www.orangecountymusicawards.com.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing I don't think we did a good job tapping into is
the county's hip-hop scene, which is so far underground they just
don't want to emerge," Brown said. "We got just one submission from a
hip-hop artist. I told him we couldn't have a category unless we had
more submissions, and he contacted a bunch of other people he knew,
but we couldn't make any progress with that." Consequently, rap was
folded with blues and R&amp;B into a single category.</TE>
<TE>   The big surprise for Brown in a region celebrated for its punk
scene was the low number of punk bands that expressed interest. "It
may just be the punk attitude that awards shows are stupid," he
said.The irony wasn't lost on Brown that the event he's been working
to put on for the last three years ended up becoming a reality just a
few days after the VH1 News special, "Orange County: American Hip
Factory," celebrated the county's punk-alternative music scene.</TE>
<TE>   Net proceeds from today's awards show will benefit Big
Brothers--Big Sisters of Orange County. Brown said a debate among the
event's organizers on whether to try to raise as much money for the
charity as possible or make the show, itself, the best they could
resulted in spending more money on the event. "This is a first step,
and it won't be a perfect evening," he said. "But we want to be sure
to be able to do it again next year to get other things going, like
symposiums where musicians can come in contact with the people who
can actually impact their careers."</TE>
<TE>   As with other music awards, announcements of winners will be
interspersed among live performances by several of the nominees, from
alternative rock bands Nice and Scarlet Crush to South
American-steeped band Alturas and singer-songwriters Jay Buchanan and
Kerry Getz.</TE>
<TE>   Surf-music pioneer Dick Dale will be one of the few celebrity
presenters. "We didn't want to go the route of inviting C-list
Hollywood celebrities from daytime soaps that nobody watches," Brown
said. "So we have presenters like [former Doll Hut owner] Linda
Jemison and [Chain Reaction owner] Tim Hill." Dale will hand out a
lifetime achievement award, the recipient of which Brown said is "a
closely guarded secret." Badger added that KOCE will give a bit of
television exposure to the winners Monday at 7 p.m. on its nightly
local news program, "Real Orange."</TE>
<TE>   If that gives participants a little taste of show-biz, that's OK
with Brown.</TE>
<TE>   "The other thing we're attempting is to show bands that they have
to pay attention to the business side as well as to the musical
side," he said. "This sorts out the bands that are serious about what
they're doing as opposed to the ones who just want to party."</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County Music Awards will take place tonight at the
Galaxy Concert Theatre, 3503 S. Harbor Blvd., Santa Ana. 7:30 p.m.
$15. (714) 957-0600.</TE>
