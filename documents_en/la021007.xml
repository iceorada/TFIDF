<LD>For some reason, it had never occurred to me that it might be raining
in a rain forest. I knew it rained at one time or another, which is
why they call it a rain forest, but I never expected it to rain with
me actually in it. It wasn't until we were slogging through the
jungle entanglements of Panama's Chagres National Park and it began
pouring that I realized it could rain whenever it pleased, which it
did with great frequency.</LD>
<LD>   My second misconception regarding rain forests was that I thought
I would be seeing them from the glass-enclosed top deck of a
luxurious air-conditioned bus, while a guide pointed out interesting
features through a PA system. Wrong again. Had I known we would be in
the forests themselves trying to make our way through thick growths
of vines and trees and ferns and palms in storms that rattled the
world with lightning and thunder, I might not have mentioned Panama.</LD>
<LD>   To backtrack a bit, we were itching for someplace to get away for
a while when I suggested Panama. I was thinking of a trip through the
canal, a city tour, dinner at fine restaurants, sunny days on
tropical beaches and that luxury ride through forests alive with
harpy eagles and howler monkeys.</LD>
<TE>   The first few days were pretty much what I'd anticipated, but then
came the rain forests, which my wife, the
explorer/adventurer/death-defying Cinelli, could hardly wait to
enter. I knew it wouldn't be a bus ride in the park when our guide,
Peter Garcia, pointed to a log at the shore of Madden Lake and said,
"Climb aboard!"</TE>
<TE>   "That's a tree," I said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a dugout canoe," Peter explained.</TE>
<TE>   "Isn't this great!" Cinelli said.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, my God.</TE>
<TE>   I had never ridden in a tree before, and though I got wet, it took
us to where we wanted to go, which was at the edge of the jungle
itself. Being dry really wasn't an option in Panama at that time of
year. Not only was it the rainy season, but the humidity itself was
at the drenching level every day, storm or no storm.</TE>
<TE>   We hiked up yellow-clay trails as slick as ice, crossed knee-deep
stream beds and plowed through thickets where, I'm sure, snakes and
jaguars watched our every move. Panama supposedly has more kinds of
birds than anyplace else in the world, but I never saw one. Peter
shouted, "Look, a toucan!" gesturing toward the forest beyond the
stream. I ooohed and aaahed but later admitted to Cinelli I hadn't
seen anything. I was just trying to please Peter.</TE>
<TE>   After what seemed like hours, we reached our destination, which
was a waterfall. If you've ever seen more than one waterfall, you
know there's not a lot of difference between them. A waterfall is a
waterfall is a waterfall. Big deal. Let's go back.</TE>
<TE>   Going back meant crossing the lake again, this time in a sudden
storm. Lightning struck all around us. Thunder roared. Peter stayed
calm, Cinelli loved it and I waited patiently to die.</TE>
<TE>   We made it to a village of Empera Indians, where we were greeted
by half-naked people whose ways hadn't changed for thousands of
years. I've seen topless women before, but never in a rain forest. It
was a new experience. They fed us fish in a large, one-room cabana
where, Peter explained, "They ate, slept and procreated." Although
not, of course, at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   Having survived that, Cinelli, now stimulated by her jungle
challenge, wanted to fly to one of the nearby San Blas islands in the
Caribbean to experience other feats of human endurance. I fought it
for two reasons. I think of small planes the way I think of dugout
canoes. Neither is actually meant as an instrument of human
transportation. Also, we would have to fly through thunderheads that
ate small planes.</TE>
<TE>   Peter suggested instead a lodge in the jungle called Burbayar,
which means "spirit of the forest" in the language of the Kuna
Indians. Owned by a Basque who calls himself Inaki, it consists of a
series of cabanas on about 100 acres of land at the edge of the
Nargana Forest, a pristine area protected by both the government of
Panama and the Kunas. The jungle embraces Burbayar as its own.</TE>
<TE>   The idea of a lodge pleased me, and the idea of more jungle
pleased Cinelli. The only way to reach Burbayar was in a
four-wheel-drive vehicle on a strip of land that defied the term
"road." For an hour, we bounced over ruts as deep as chasms and slid
to the edges of jungle cliffs that dropped into green oblivion.
Getting to Burbayar was the emotional equivalent of reaching an
outpost in Antarctica.</TE>
<TE>   It was worth it. We slept in individual thatched-roof cabanas that
overlooked the forest and gloried in the peace that lay like soft
music over the lodge. The rain whispered rather than roared. The
jungle glistened. We hiked through a rain forest again, but by now I
was able to perceive its beauty and not its peril. When it came time
to leave, after three days of deep serenity, I realized we had
journeyed to Paradise.</TE>
<TE>   I hear the jungle calling even as I write, a dream place very deep
inside of me.</TE>

<DH>A childhood trauma in which bad luck played a leading role
set the tone for Paul Auster's writing</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>

<LD>Loss, grief and redemption.</LD>
<LD>   Paul Auster could be speaking of his new novel, "The Book of
Illusions" (Henry Holt), a story about a college professor whose wife
and two children die in a plane crash. Or he could just as easily be
talking about any of his nine previous books whose central characters
frequently suffer the vagaries of bad luck, chance or life. Or the
55-year-old New Yorker could be talking of his screenplays or poetry.</LD>
<LD>   But on this October afternoon at the Argyle Hotel on the Sunset
Strip, he isn't. He is just talking baseball.</LD>
<TE>   The game, Auster asserts, is beautiful. Its geography, its design.
The way it's both a team and an individual sport. And, unlike the
commotion of football and basketball, it's beautiful in the way you
can actually watch a play develop and unfold.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a game of numbers, stats and history, and the fact it's
played every day makes it like life," says Auster, in L.A. on his
national book tour. "You have your good days and your bad days."</TE>
<TE>   "A good team is still going to lose 40% of its games," says the
critically acclaimed author whose American audience continues to
expand but who still is more popular in Europe. "And a good hitter is
still going to make an out 70% of the time. It's a game of constant
defeats. That's instructive, I think."</TE>
<TE>   He sounds like a Cubs fan or maybe the Red Sox. But it's worse
than that: He's a Giants fan--the New York Giants--a franchise that
abandoned East for West decades ago. And that's instructive about
Auster, a man whose daily routine begins with reading the sports page
then progresses to the obituaries.</TE>
<TE>   "So much of my work is about loss and how people put themselves
together after a crisis," says Auster, dressed in dark clothes and
sunglasses. "What is the end result of grief? Can you go on living or
not?"</TE>
<TE>   Right now, Auster is wondering whether he can survive this tour,
only his third. In spite of his dislike for the spotlight, he decided
to do it out of a sense of loyalty to his publisher, who has treated
him well through the years. "Publishing is a hard business," he says.
"The fact is, without extra effort, books die for the most part."</TE>
<TE>   The tour's constant demand for travel and interviews is physically
grueling. Eleven cities from coast to coast in less than a month.
It's midafternoon in Los Angeles, his fourth stop, and he's already
exhausted. He politely asks when the photographer will be finished
because all he wants to do is go lie down before he is to give a
nighttime reading in downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   His smoking doesn't exactly help his energy. For 25 years, he's
enjoyed between 10 and 20 Schimmelpennicks, a small Dutch cigar, per
day. (It's the same brand that his character--played by William
Hurt--lights up in the film "Smoke.") The habit has given him a
gravelly smoker's voice and left his teeth a few shades darker than
normal.</TE>
<TE>   "I quit cigarettes," he jokes. "Smoking these little cigars was a
transition toward not smoking, but I got stuck on the transition."</TE>
<TE>   The tour has been no less taxing psychologically. "Writers are not
performers," says Auster, a trim and fit man with graying hair. "If I
were a musician this would be a piece of cake."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, touring supplies its gratifying moments. It forces him to
connect with his audience, something that almost by nature, writers
are hesitant to do, he says.</TE>
<TE>   "Writers are shut-ins mostly," he adds. "But I can't say I've been
unhappy about everything. You meet people who come up with a big bag
of every book you've written, shake your hand and say something nice
about you. It's moving."</TE>
<TE>   Reviewers also have nice things to say about his work, especially
his latest. The normally guarded Kirkus Reviews enthused: "Auster's
10th novel is one of his finest; an elegant meditation on the
question of whether an artist or his public 'owns' the work he
creates, and a thickly plotted succession of interlocking mysteries
reminiscent of his highly praised "New York Trilogy." ... In many
ways, a summa of Auster's entire oeuvre, and a gripping and immensely
satisfying novel in its own right."</TE>
<TE>   The inspiration for "The Book of Illusions" is as much a mystery
as the random events that befall many of his characters. One day,
while talking a walk a dozen or so years ago, the character Hector
Mann suddenly came to him.</TE>
<TE>   "There Hector Mann was in my head, complete with his name, white
suit and mustache," says Auster. "I have no idea how he got there."</TE>
<TE>   In the novel, Hector Mann is an accomplished silent-movie
star--the creative and comic force behind such films as "Tango
Tangle" and "Mr. Nobody"--who suddenly vanishes and is presumed dead.
Decades later, a college professor struggling to cope with the death
of his wife and children takes up a biography of the enigmatic
performer and soon discovers Mann may be alive after all.</TE>
<TE>   Though Mann's origins may be a mystery, the integral role that
silent movies plays in the novel is not. Auster has always loved the
pre-talkie cinema.</TE>
<TE>   "Silent movies express something about the human condition in a
way that is highly entertaining and highly strange," says Auster.
"The fact they are silent makes them deeper and more like dreams than
like reality. Everyone from a 3-year-old to a 90-year-old can respond
to a [Buster] Keaton or a [Charlie] Chaplin film. It's so
authentically human."</TE>
<TE>   Considered Filmmaking</TE>
<TE>   As an undergraduate at Columbia University, Auster was a film
reviewer for the college newspaper. In fact, he debated shelving his
ambition to become a novelist for becoming a filmmaker. "I realized
my personality was such that it would be a bad idea to be a
filmmaker," says Auster. "I was so shy and intimidated about talking
in front of people I thought I wouldn't be able to do it. The irony
is only after I started publishing novels that filmmakers approached
me to collaborate on a script or adapt something of mine for the
screen."</TE>
<TE>   If using a silent movie as a plot device sounds a bit surreal, it
is. Auster's fascination with the bizarre machinations of reality can
be traced to a seminal event that occurred when he was 14. At a
summer camp in upstate New York, he was among a group of about 16
boys who went on a hike in the woods when a thunderstorm rolled up on
them. The storm was so violent that it trapped the boys in the woods
for nearly an hour pelting them with hard rain as lightning flashed.
When it was over, Auster discovered that a boy inches away from him
had been struck--and killed--by lightning.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the fundamental thing that happened to me as a young
person," he says. "My philosophy of life was formed that afternoon."</TE>
<TE>   Writes in Longhand</TE>
<TE>   Having a philosophy is well and good, but you still have to
communicate it. And like most writers, Auster has his own unique
style. He writes in longhand six, sometimes seven, days a week. His
workday begins around 8; he takes a break for a sandwich and a walk
at about 12:30. By 2, he's back at his desk in his Park Slope
brownstone--where he lives with his writer wife, Siri Hustvedt, and
their 15-year-old daughter--and writes until 4 or 4:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   He builds his narratives paragraph by paragraph. He won't go on to
the next block until he's satisfied with the previous one. He may
spend a day or two reworking the same paragraph, which he may
eventually reshape 20 times or more.</TE>
<TE>   When he's happy enough with the paragraph, he immediately types it
up, saving it to be edited yet again later. The entire typed
manuscript will usually be revised at least three times, before he
even hands it to his editor. It took him 2 1/2 years of actual
composition to complete "The Book of Illusions."</TE>
<TE>   "When I start writing, I have a general sense of the shape of the
book," he says. "I have a feeling about the tone, the rhythm and the
music. But every time I set out to write a novel thinking I would be
doing one thing, I always wind up doing another. The book I finish is
never the book I thought I was going to write.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of stumbling and groping," he says. "You discover
everything in the past is of no use, no help. It doesn't matter that
you've written X number of books because you've never written this
one before. You discover what you're doing in the process of doing
it."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, kind of like trying to hit a baseball.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the opening scene of the recently released film "Secretary," the
heroine, Lee Holloway (played by Maggie Gyllenhaal) has just been
released from a mental institution. For reasons that are unclear, she
seeks relief from life's stresses and disappointments by cutting
herself. As part of her rehabilitation, she attends a secretarial
school after which she lands a job with a lawyer, E. Edward Grey
(James Spader). He is verbally abusive, puts her in a yoke to carry
out her secretarial duties, tells her precisely what to eat for lunch
and spanks her over secretarial errors. Though their erotic roles fit
like a lock and key, Mr. Grey, in particular, experiences
self-loathing after his sadistic forays.</LD>
<LD>   Over the course of the movie, the protagonists experience a
profound transformation. By revealing themselves to one another as
troubled people with destructive, unconventional sexual fixations,
the film implies, Lee and Mr. Grey find happiness and are able to
overcome their self-destructive impulses.</LD>
<TE>   The movie raises an interesting question: Is it possible to have a
sadomasochistic relationship that is healthy, perhaps even
therapeutic? No psychologists or mental health professionals
interviewed for this story thought that two people with
self-destructive erotic fixations could "heal" one another and
transcend their sexual impulses by falling in love. Judy Kuriansky, a
New York psychologist who saw the film, said she found the subject so
difficult for a general audience that there "ought to be a seminar
after to explain it."</TE>
<TE>   A lot of sadomasochism is like a sexual drama where partners
invert their public and private roles, so that, for instance, a
high-powered professional who has to be in control at work all the
time gives up control to a partner, said Paul Abramson, a professor
of psychology at UCLA and co-author with psychologist Steven D.
Pinkerton of "With Pleasure: Thoughts on the Nature of Human
Sexuality" (Oxford University Press, 2002). "The roles are clearly
defined and the focus or intent is to provide additional erotic
stimulus," said Abramson. "What the masochist gets is giving up
control in a world where he or she often always has to be in control.
The sadist is often someone who always wants to be in control but is
not in control in real life, which is why there is often a gender
reversal, with women playing the sadist."</TE>
<TE>   "For perversion to be erotically exciting, the person has to feel
like he or she is committing a sin," Diane Ackerman writes in her
1995 book, "A Natural History of Love." "Some moral code has to be
transgressed, someone has to be hurt or humiliated, physically abused
or degraded, or reduced to an inanimate object." A crucial ingredient
that produces excitement is risk, or pretending to be at risk, writes
Ackerman, quoting the work of psychoanalyst Robert Stoller, who
studied unconventional sexual behavior.</TE>
<TE>   This is part of what makes playing at sadomasochism exciting for
couples who are otherwise quite conventional. Lonnie Barbach, a San
Francisco-based clinical psychologist, said she sees couples in her
practice who engage in non-abusive sadomasochism because it is fun
and playful but also because it requires emotional risk-taking, which
builds intimacy. "Most S&amp;M relationships can only happen where two
people feel vulnerable and safe," said Barbach. "No one is going to
criticize or judge you. The trust is a really important aspect of it.
To be really vulnerable, you have to know your lover will stop on a
dime. Often, it is the masochist who is really in control. The sadist
can only go as far as the masochist will go."</TE>
<TE>   Sadomasochism can be part of a loving relationship, said Beverly
Palmer, a professor of psychology at Cal State Dominguez Hills, as
long as there is mutual respect for each others' bodies and desires
and the behavior is "a fleeting variation of one's sexual script"
rather than a compulsion.</TE>
<TE>   "The two people have to relate to each other as people, not
objects," said Palmer, who has a private practice in Torrance. "If
people are engaging in S&amp;M in the service of distorted needs, a need
to hurt or be hurt, or a need to be shamed or to shame, it generally
is not part of a loving relationship."</TE>
<TE>   Kuriansky, a clinical psychologist for 30 years, said that in
cases where conventional couples have battles over control, she
sometimes assigns what she calls " 'Who's the Boss' homework." "One
night she gets to order him around and he gets to do her bidding, and
then it is his turn," said Kuriansky, author of "The Complete Idiots
Guide to a Healthy Relationship," (Alpha Books; 2001). "We always ask
that they be polite. A therapist has to be very, very precise because
the homework can be misinterpreted and get out of control."</TE>
<TE>   The role-playing is meant to allow partners to experience what it
feels like to be in charge, then to switch roles, and experience what
it feels like to be ordered around. Partners may experience a range
of feelings from empowerment to submissiveness, and associated
emotions ranging from satisfaction and sexual thrill to anger and
shame. The need to have power over one another and the underlying
deeper need for love is unleashed. Couples become more cooperative
and intimate, she said. Or at least that is the goal.</TE>
<TE>   "Couples start thinking about who is telling who what to do, and
the words become different," said Kuriansky. "They become less
defensive and less aggressive and the relationship becomes more
equal."</TE>
<TE>   Pepper Schwartz, a University of Washington sociologist, said that
this kind of erotic play for many couples is not necessarily a
symptom of oppression and depression in the rest of the relationship.
"Sexual fantasies of being spanked, being taken by six cowboys or
being treated badly are common," said Schwartz. "We just don't talk
about them because we as society still have a white picket fence
around sexuality. What S&amp;M is usually about is people who want to
explore sexual fantasies in a safe place with someone they respect
and love. For others, S&amp;M is their main arousal modus operandi, and
they can't put it away. If two people, who are not going to get their
sexual needs met by the most of the rest of the general population,
find each other and make each other happy, why not?"</TE>
<TE>   At one time or another, say some experts, everyone in a long-term
relationship is sadistic and/or masochistic. We all torture our
spouses or partners "while feigning unawareness," writes David
Schnarch, a sex therapist and author of "Passionate Marriage: Keeping
Love and Intimacy Alive in Committed Relationships" (Owl Books,
1997). "Normal marital sadism," writes Schnarch, who runs the
Marriage and Family Health Center in Evergreen, Colo., is withholding
sex and intimacy while pretending to want to please a partner, or not
giving a mate the emotional gratification that they crave. Normal
marital sadism and its requisite deceit, writes Schnarch, "perverts
our sexual potential."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps if the filmmakers were to write a sequel to "Secretary,"
the less titillating subject of marital sadism could be explored.</TE>
<TE>   Lee and Mr. Grey could torture each other in the many ways other
married couples do. She could wear fetching pajamas, but when he
tried to initiate sex, she could have a headache. He, in turn, could
pretend not to hear her when she asks him to take out the trash for
the third time.</TE>

<DH>At new L.A. arts center, it's OK to judge a book by its
cover</DH>

<LD>Ann Marie Hovie's book "Naked Haiku" is a series of poems she
composed while working as a figure model, transferred onto fabric
scrolls. Miriam Schaer's "Mo(u)rning Prayer" is an altered corset
that opens to reveal a small book in the shape of a Star of David.
Katherine Ng's book "Spirit Vessel" is strips of letterpress-printed
paper woven into the shape of a vase.</LD>
<LD>   None of these would ever find their way onto shelves at Barnes &amp;
Noble or a neighborhood library, but they are books--artists' books
and art objects in themselves. The book as art may take on sculptural
forms, looking nothing like a conventional book, having no covers, or
covers made of metal, glass, clay or fabric. Pages may be cut apart
or come tumbling out, telling a story or constructing a narrative
with images and words, or sometimes without words at all. These books
may incorporate painting, photography or letterpress printing.
Existing books may be altered or deconstructed and in the
transformation take on new meaning.</LD>
<LD>   While cities such as San Francisco, New York, Chicago and
Minneapolis have established book arts centers offering exhibitions,
education programs and workshops in bookbinding, artists' books and
printing, Los Angeles has gone without. But that is changing with the
creation of the Los Angeles Book Arts Center.</LD>
<TE>   Lisa Deutsch and other local book artists had been talking about
starting a center for years, but a few months ago Deutsch e-mailed
friends about drawing up formal plans and found everyone more than
willing to rally to the cause. As the center's first president, she
envisions it as "an umbrella to encompass all things--books,
letterpress, paper arts, the book as sculpture. Book arts encompasses
so many different areas, so it's important to be a resource for all
these artists to come together and show their work. These disciplines
are largely ignored or pooh-poohed as not being fine art, and they
don't get the recognition they deserve."</TE>
<TE>   Deutsch herself is used to people being confused about her
occupation. "They usually say, 'So, you're a book illustrator,' or,
'Oh, you mean you're a graphic artist.' "</TE>
<TE>   In addition to such workshops as "22 Accordion Folds" and "The
Altered Page," the center is sponsoring a book arts exhibit at the
Christine Willis Gallery through October and plans a sale of artists'
books in November. Deutsch and others are looking for a permanent
venue and applying for nonprofit status. Funding so far has come from
membership dues, class fees and some donations.</TE>
<TE>   Aspiring book artists have had access to an increasing number of
classes in recent years around Southern California, ranging from
basic bookbinding to creating artistic journals. But they've been in
scattered locations, from rubber-stamp stores to private studios to
high schools, art colleges and museums, and advanced classes are
often difficult to find. The California Center for the Book,
headquartered at UCLA, is affiliated with the Library of Congress and
offers programs relating to reading, writing and literacy. Some
events are book arts related but incorporate lectures and
discussions, not hands-on workshops.</TE>
<TE>   "Students in my classes would ask, 'Where can I sell my books?
Where can I teach? Can I show my book somewhere?'" says Deutsch, a
former attorney who now owns Artistic License Unlimited, a custom
bookbinding studio. "There was nothing for them, and I couldn't guide
them; I couldn't put them anywhere."</TE>
<TE>   Book artist and curator Gloria Helfgott, who has been working with
Deutsch in establishing the center, found a welcoming community when
she moved here from New York several years ago. What was missing, she
says, "was a center. I loved having a place to go in New York and
being able to see exhibitions every month. You were exposed to what
was going on around the world. The workshops I've been running in my
studio have helped a lot to centralize the book arts community a
little bit."</TE>
<TE>   Helfgott curated the recent "SO CALled Books" exhibit at UCLA of
works by Southern California artists, including Ng, Susan King, Ed
Ruscha, Lezley Saar and Sue Ann Robinson, and produced the center's
first show. She'll also teach classes through the center. Her wish is
for "a viable organization that keeps to its mission to stress
artists' books and books as an art form, as well as educate the
public and open it up to outreach programs in schools."</TE>
<TE>   Beth Thielen, whose works have been exhibited at the J. Paul Getty
Museum (the Getty Research Institute has a collection of 4,100
artists' books), says she hopes the center will take book arts into
higher realms: "We've been having workshops in L.A. for years, and
people have been learning [binding] structures forever, and everyone
has these wonderful blank books. But there hasn't been the kind of
ongoing process where there's a development of content and form. Some
artists, such as Gloria and Katherine Ng, have contents that are
deeply married to the form, but to establish a center where we could
build on that would be really great."</TE>
<TE>   Establishing a book arts center in San Francisco has been
essential for promoting bookbinding and book arts there, says Mary
Austin, who started the San Francisco Center for the Book with
Kathleen Burch in 1996 as an outgrowth of the Pacific Center for the
Book Arts, a 22-year-old Bay Area organization that promotes book
arts through lectures, workshops, exhibitions and study groups. The
San Francisco center started out offering a dozen workshops; classes
for 2002 will number 272.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the appeal of books is universal," Austin says. "In this
highly technical world, having a tangible item to make or communicate
through broadens who we are as people. A lot of people who take our
classes are Web designers, and there seems to be a draw to this
tangible object."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles is ripe for supporting a center for book arts, says
Judith Hoffberg, a longtime collector as well as historian, critic,
curator and editor of "Umbrella," a newsletter about book arts and
mail art. Artists' books are "now accepted not only throughout the
U.S. but around the world as well," she says. "Libraries are building
collections, and there are major private collections. I think in a
day and age when digital has taken over our world, there is nostalgia
and appreciation for the finely created book and the magnificent
structures that have been evolving."</TE>

<LD>CAVIAR</LD>
<LD>   The Strange History and</LD>
<LD>   Uncertain Future of the</LD>
<TE>   World's Most Coveted Delicacy</TE>
<TE>   By Inga Saffron</TE>
<TE>   Broadway Books</TE>
<TE>   272 pages, $23.95</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Serving as Moscow correspondent for the Philadelphia Inquirer in
the mid-1990s, Inga Saffron developed an intense relationship with
one of Russia's most prized delicacies:</TE>
<TE>   "I rolled the eggs over my tongue, allowing the taut spheres to
detonate a few at a time.... New and different tastes came in
explosive bursts, as the initial fishiness gave way to more complex
flavors and aromas. I was reminded of other rich foods--olives, pine
nuts, smoked salmon. But it was the physical sensation, the way the
firm casings of the eggs gave way as they popped against my tongue
and cheek, that dominated the experience. What I realized was that
caviar was something you experienced in your mouth, not your
stomach."</TE>
<TE>   Caviar are the lightly salted eggs of the sturgeon, an ancient
fish that has been swimming around since before the dinosaurs but
whose future now looks bleak. In her sharp-eyed, informative and
briskly written book "Caviar," Saffron examines the natural, economic
and gastronomical history of the sturgeon and its eggs.</TE>
<TE>   A "big, slow-moving beast, sweetly curious about the goings-on
above its head and lumpenly passive when it runs into danger," the
sturgeon was once found all over the world, in the major rivers of
China, Central Asia, Europe and North America.</TE>
<TE>   In the 19th century, Hamburg merchants made a fortune selling
caviar from sturgeon caught in the Elbe River. The trouble was,
business was so profitable that within a few decades the sturgeon had
been fished out. The same thing happened in 1880s America, in New
Jersey, of all places.</TE>
<TE>   Springing up alongside the sturgeon-rich Delaware River, a little
boomtown appropriately known as Caviar, Saffron tells us, "supplied
more of the world's caviar during the 1880s than any place on earth."
But before long, the sturgeon of the Delaware River met a fate
similar to their German cousins in the Elbe. Although
industrialization and pollution were an additional threat to
sturgeon, it would seem from Saffron's account that in most cases it
was overfishing that decimated the sturgeon even before pollution had
a chance to do its damage.</TE>
<TE>   In one of history's nicer ironies, by the 1920s only the Soviet
Union, a state newly consecrated to the welfare of the masses, was
still producing caviar, the comestible most strongly associated with
luxury and elitism. And what saved the Russian sturgeon from falling
victim to the same sad fate as its American and European counterparts
was strict, centralized government control of the caviar industry.
Earlier, in America, many of the people involved in the caviar
business were sufficiently concerned about the perils of overfishing
to beg for government regulation. But then (as now) there was a
stubborn ideological resistance to regulate an industry even for its
own good.</TE>
<TE>   The Soviets achieved an admirably efficient, reliable and very
profitable system with regard to the production and distribution of
caviar. Saffron aptly compares it with the system used by De Beers in
controlling the production, supply and price of the world's diamonds.</TE>
<TE>   The collapse of the Soviet Union spelled chaos and, quite
probably, doom for the sturgeon, as jobless former Soviets scrambled
to make some much-needed cash in the newly unregulated caviar
business.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, in the early 1990s, there was a great boom. Caviar was
everywhere. But all too soon, not surprisingly, sturgeon were not.</TE>
<TE>   Although, as Saffron describes, there are unscrupulous people
who've turned the sale and distribution of caviar into a fishy
version of the illicit drug trade, the problem goes beyond that. One
of the people Saffron portrays is an honest and likable Russian
caviar producer who understands the problem and supports efforts to
restock the waters and restrict the catch. Still, he wants to make a
living and thus is inclined to take an overly optimistic view of the
problem. Saffron also explains very lucidly the difficulties that
have plagued international regulatory efforts. While many of the
former Soviet republics have failed to address the problem, she
notes, Iran has been doing an admirable job of regulating and
restocking its part of the Caspian Sea.</TE>
<TE>   If the wild sturgeon is endangered, what about fish farms? Saffron
takes us on a fascinating visit to Northern California, where a small
group of assiduous individuals are doing their best to breed the
once-populous white sturgeon in captivity. She also visits an even
more ambitious project in Volgograd, involving a much wider range of
breeding stock.</TE>
<TE>   Not only does Saffron ably convey the enthusiasm and dedication of
the men engaged in these projects, she also gives us a good sense of
the economic precariousness of such enterprises. It can take at least
10 years before a baby sturgeon is old enough to bear its precious
eggs. In a time of melting icebergs, disappearing rain forests and
the spread of HIV, it may seem frivolous (though at least
considerate) of us to worry whether future generations will know the
pleasure of tasting caviar. But the paradigm that emerges from the
sturgeon's story is one that can be seen again and again: You can't
have your caviar and eat it too--not unless firm measures are taken
to ensure a balance between consumption and supply.</TE>

<HD>When Chickens Come Home to Roost</HD>
<DH>Poultry becomes a staple of pop culture through books,
crockery--and the real thing</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA DANE ROGERS</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a moment of perfect bucolic clarity, Pam Percy gazed out upon the
Wisconsin farmscape beyond her house and beheld a mist-shaded pond,
the late-summer garden aglow with ruby tomatoes and golden sunflowers
and a clutch of contented chickens bustling around her yard.</LD>
<LD>   It was what one might call her chicken epiphany.</LD>
<LD>   "They were doing typical chicken things--strutting, running,
pecking and taking their dirt baths. They had a timeless quality
about them," Percy recalled. "They created such a peaceful feeling
and gentle pace, I thought to myself, 'All's right with the world.' "</LD>
<TE>   Five years later, Percy, a producer for Wisconsin Public Radio, is
author of a book that tells you more than you ever knew there was to
know about poultry: "The Complete Chicken: An Entertaining History of
Chickens" (Voyageur Press).</TE>
<TE>   A monument to chicken trivia, the book catalogs exotic breeds--for
those who don't know an Australorp from a Frizzle or
Wyandotte--includes tips for distinguishing one cockscomb from
another or saying cock-a-doodle-doo in 21 languages; and presents a
lineup of chicks in art, literature, music and popular culture,
including politics and flicks. (The book has its own Web site:
www.thecompletechicken.com).</TE>
<TE>   Who knew there was a chicken icon in King Tut's tomb? That Stephen
Foster wrote a chicken song? Or that chickens aren't dumb clucks?
They can be taught to play poker, baseball and tick-tack-toe.</TE>
<TE>   The book is also a testament to a design motif that's been around
for 5,000 years. The regal image of the rooster has adorned Greek
vases, Roman coins, medieval church spires and the flag of the French
Revolution. Today, decorative chickens rule the roost in many
home-furnishing stores, especially those with Gallic inclinations.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got the eagle, the French have the rooster. It's
practically their national symbol," says Bringier McConnell, head of
French Country Living, a Great Falls, Va.-based emporium and catalog
operation. "We've sold them on potholders, throw rugs, tapestry
pillows. We've got rooster light fixtures, wood and ceramic rooster
effigies," at www.frenchcountry.com.</TE>
<TE>   Sur La Table, a Seattle-based kitchenware chain that has stores in
Newport Beach, Pasadena, Santa Monica and at the Los Angeles Farmers
Market, offers a crowing cockerel pie bird, rooster pitchers, rooster
dishes and a life-size, hand-painted porcelain rooster figurine for
$364. Renee Behnke, company president, thinks she knows why they're
selling like hotcakes. "Everyone wants a French country kitchen, and
chickens and roosters epitomize the French-country look"
(www.surlatable.com).</TE>
<TE>   On her own picturesque spread near Milwaukee, Percy has been
selling free-range chicks and eggs since 1986. But her cache of
decorative "chickenalia"--defined as "anything shaped like a chicken
or with a chicken on it"--has eclipsed her real-life flock. The
enthusiasm led to her book, which she researched for a decade.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to elevate the image of the chicken. They have a
fascinating history."</TE>
<TE>   "Extraordinary Chickens," a lavishly illustrated picture book from
Harry N. Abrams came out in 2000 and is in its sixth printing.
Another new book, "Counting My Chickens" by the Duchess of
Devonshire, a memoir of her English country life, is due out next
week. And a PBS chick-u-mentary, "The Natural History of the
Chicken," just won two Emmys.</TE>
<TE>   Chickens are also hitting fashion runways. Check out the sultry
model in a silver rooster-feather headdress from Christian Dior Haute
Couture in the October Vogue.</TE>
<TE>   "They're beautiful creatures," says Percy, speculating on the
bird's timeless appeal. "They're fun to watch and a link to the past.
I see them out of my window, and I feel removed from the 21st
century. Chickens, I think, fill some kind of need."</TE>
<TE>   Certainly that can be said of live chickens. "Ever since Martha
Stewart started crowing the praises of pedigreed poultry, folks who
knew chickens only as hot wings and McNuggets have started raising
them," said reporter Bill Geist in a recent spot on "CBS Sunday
Morning."</TE>
<TE>   (Stewart's prized Araucana hens lay eggs in shades of pastel blues
and greens.)</TE>
<TE>   On the CBS feature, New York decorator Bunny Williams welcomed
cameras to her Connecticut estate and the sight of her fancy flock
frolicking in their $2,500 designer aviary.</TE>
<TE>   This chicken thing has spread from coast to coast. In Seattle, a
July "house tour" showcased 25 urban chicken coops, but Murray
McMurray Hatchery in Webster City, Iowa, ships mail-order chicks to
plenty of chic ZIP codes too. McMurray, which bills itself as the
oldest breeder of rare chickens in the country, also sells turkeys,
game birds, rabbits, tchotchkes, books and professional
poultry-raising equipment (www.mcmurrayhatchery.com). Clubs for
chicken breeders also are popping up.</TE>
<TE>   Percy has surrounded herself with chickens, from the live ones
lolling on the front porch to the collectibles filling every corner
inside her Victorian farmhouse. Most of the objects photographed in
the book are in her personal collection, including the Herend,
Quimper and Limoges roosters on the foyer shelf; the everyday china,
"Poppy Trail" introduced in 1934 by the Metlox Manufacturing Co.; and
a framed portrait of a majestic clucker in a formal pose, a 19th
century chromolithograph by a British illustrator of some renown,
J.W. Ludlow.</TE>
<TE>   "There's definitely a chicken theme," she says, "but it's not over
the top. At least not to me." Though she approached chicken fatigue
while writing the book--"I dreamed about chickens .... I talked about
chickens so much I began to bore even myself"--she has a follow-up
book in mind.</TE>
<TE>   For now, she's focusing on her day job: executive producer of
"Hotel Milwaukee," a popular Wisconsin Public Radio variety show. "I
only have time to obsess about chickens at night and on the
weekends."</TE>
<TE>   Luckily, her husband, writer Martin Hintz, shares her enthusiasm.
"Thank goodness, he's chicken-enlightened," Percy says, "because my
chickens and I are a package."</TE>

<HD>'The New Old Thing': The Accent Wall</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Washington Post</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Recently we got hit by a swinging style pendulum: During an online
chat on Washingtonpost.com, a reader asked what we thought about
using a strong accent color on just one wall of an otherwise neutral
room. We rather breezily dismissed the idea as dated.</LD>
<LD>   A cyber-reader took exception. Two top shelter magazines had just
pronounced the accent wall a "stylish way to personalize a room," she
wrote. What's more, a designer had created a purple accent wall on
HGTV's "Designing for the Sexes" show. "The results were incredible."</LD>
<LD>   Like Marimekko, Pucci prints, the miniskirt and other icons of the
'70s, the accent wall has staged a comeback. "It's the new old
thing," says Kenneth X. Charbonneau, a New York-based color
consultant and something of an industry oracle on the subject of
paint. "It went away, but it came back because white walls came back
and designers were getting bored."</LD>
<TE>   He points out the advantages of the one-wall approach: "Experiment
with a space you don't spend much time in.... Put the accent color on
the stair wall, or the wall you pass on your way to the living room.
No one's asking you to sit there and look at it full time."</TE>
<TE>   Well-chosen colors can help relate one room to another. "Look into
the living room and pick the most gorgeous color in it, like a silk
throw pillow in citrus green, and put that color on your accent
wall," Charbonneau says. "In small doses it's delicious."</TE>

<LD>"Captain Underpants"</LD>
<LD>   by Dave Pilkey</LD>
<LD>   "Captain Underpants" is a fiction book that I really, absolutely,
positively love! The author has written an interesting story about
two boys who get themselves into serious trouble. Some of the
characters are: George, Harold, Mr. Krupp, Captain Underpants and Dr.
Diaper. Mr. Krupp gets hypnotized into being Captain Underpants. He
fights crime.</LD>
<TE>   I like this story because it has romance (just kidding), action
and adventure.</TE>

<TE>   "The Giving Tree"</TE>
<TE>   by Shel Silverstein</TE>
<TE>   This book is about a tree and a little boy. They played with each
other every day. One day the tree gave the little boy all his apples.
Then the next day there were no more apples, so he used the tree
branches to make the house he moved into with his family. Then years
passed. He used the tree to make a boat to take his family to New
York. When he got really old, he could only use the tree to sit on.</TE>
<TE>   I really like this book. I recommend it.</TE>

<LD>Part 1</LD>
<LD>   Today is my very first day at my new school ... that makes me the
new kid.</LD>
<LD>   The reason I'm the new kid and not just any old kid is because my
dad got transferred to a new job, and we had to move. He says he's
the new kid too.</LD>
<TE>   In my opinion, there is nothing on this Earth ickier than being
the new kid. I know because in my old school, I was the one who
always showed the new kids around. I always felt sorry for them. They
looked so lost and so scared. They didn't know where anything
was--like the bathrooms and the cafeteria. And the funny way the
pencil sharpener worked. I never thought I'd be a new kid myself, and
it's worse than I ever imagined.</TE>
<TE>   I had to sit in the only desk that wasn't taken--in the front
row--just across from the teacher, Ms. Howard.</TE>
<TE>   But that's not the worst part. The worst part is happening right
now. It's lunchtime and I am sitting all by myself at a big table.
Everyone is sitting with friends ... and I am here all alone.</TE>
<TE>   Even my apple doesn't taste good. How can an apple not taste good?</TE>
<TE>   I miss my old school and my friends. I miss everything. I wish
there were a way to time travel back to the past ... and I would be
in my old school. I know one thing. If I ever saw a kid sitting
alone, I would go over to the kid and say, "Hi, my name is Elaine and
please come sit with me and my friends at a table where everyone is
talking and the apples taste good."</TE>
<TE>   There's only one good thing about the first day. It's almost over.</TE>
<TE>   I can go home in 2 1/2 hours and 10 minutes and hug my dog Charlie
and read my new Nancy Drew and have cookies and milk.</TE>
<TE>   First days are horrible.</TE>
<TE>   Tomorrow will be better.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday: Will Elaine's second day as a new kid get better?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cherie Troped loves to write stories and knows that it's really,
really hard to be the new kid. This story will be on The Times' Web
site at www.latimes.com/kids.</TE>

<HD>In 'Truth' Beats the Heart of a Textone</HD>
<DH>Carla Olson, leader of the '80s band, was 'waylaid.' But
she's back now.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE APPLEFORD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The woman on stage has done this before. Carla Olson is no amateur,
but at 50 she still looks just as she did back in the early '80s as
the celebrated leader of the Textones: blond hair long and straight,
dark vest over a white shirt, a restless electric guitar in her
hands.</LD>
<LD>   She is one of three guitarists crowding the stage at the Derby,
where the dueling is overlapping but cohesive, at the place where the
roots of rock, folk and blues meet. There is a bit of the Byrds now
and then, but most of all the Rolling Stones, a sound raw and
sophisticated, and a personal obsession since Olson's days as a
teenager in Austin, Texas.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm always headed back to Loserville," she sings anxiously, with
toughness and warmth. "I can't stop, don't think I ever will."</LD>
<TE>   Olson and the band are gathered at the Los Feliz-area nightclub to
celebrate the release of "The Ring of Truth," her first album since
1994 and maybe the best of her career. The album is also a welcome
showcase for ex-Rolling Stones guitarist Mick Taylor, a frequent
Olson collaborator over the years and a major player too often
missing from action.</TE>
<TE>   Just as important for Olson is that the long-delayed project marks
a high point in a recent twist to Olson's resume: her work as a
record producer, somehow still a rare achievement for a woman, and
the source of unexpected new forays into jazz and other styles.</TE>
<TE>   "This is our party, so I'm going to be as silly as I can be
tonight," Olson says from the stage. But silliness is not her
specialty. Instead, it is a darker, muscular rock sound steeped in
roots and "classic rock" radio.</TE>
<TE>   That lineage shows clearly on "The Ring of Truth," which was
completed last summer. Olson's title song is the kind of thoughtful
ballad on age and rebellion that could easily fit into the repertoire
of a Jackson Browne or Bonnie Raitt.</TE>
<TE>   It's been a long time in the making. There have been regular club
shows and overseas trips between production gigs, all of which have
helped keep the bills paid. But Olson acknowledges that her career as
a recording artist was largely "waylaid" over the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't had a record deal in a long time," says Olson, who
lives in Studio City with her husband and longtime manager, Saul
Davis. "And keeping a band together is really tough. When you get
older and you get families and people to support, it's not easy to
keep a band together. And I like playing with the same people."</TE>
<TE>   There was a moment when Olson and the Textones, which also
included future Go-Go Kathy Valentine, seemed poised for mainstream
success, with the likes of Bob Dylan and John Fogerty openly in
support of the singer-songwriter. A 1984 album, "Midnight Mission,"
won critical acclaim but little airplay, and the Textones disbanded
in 1989. Other intriguing projects followed, including an acoustic
album with Gene Clark of the Byrds. Another was planned, but Clark
died before recording began.</TE>
<TE>   She found another esteemed collaborator in Taylor, whose years
with the Stones coincided with some of that band's most powerful
albums, "Sticky Fingers" and "Exile on Main Street" among them. He
abruptly quit the Stones in 1975 for a solo career that would prove
erratic, but his playing has rarely faltered, and Olson seems to
understand what musical settings best suit him.</TE>
<TE>   The two met in 1982, when Taylor was in Los Angeles while touring
with John Mayall. "It took a while for us to actually get his
confidence, to where he knew what we were going to do was admirable
and that we weren't out to exploit him," says Olson of Taylor. They
have since worked together often, recording a fiery live album, "Too
Hot for Snakes," at the Roxy in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   His playing erupts on an epic scale on "Ring of Truth," with lead
lines that are languid and soulful. During two days of recording in a
North Hollywood studio, he improvised at length during the
nine-minute "Great Black Hole" and a 12-minute recasting of the
Stones' "Winter."</TE>
<TE>   "That's the way I like to record," says Olson. "I much prefer just
getting in there, don't rehearse a whole lot. And Mick didn't even
have chord charts. He said, 'Just look at me when you're going to
change chords.' " She laughs. "He's so instinctive. He's such a
natural player. He can just go where he wants to go--quickly."</TE>
<TE>   Taylor was performing in Germany the night of the Derby release
party but hopes to join Olson for some select dates later this year
or next.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very good album," says Taylor, speaking from his London
home. "Once she sent me the finished album, I was really surprised
with how bright and powerful and sparkling the production was. She's
learned to become a very good producer."</TE>
<TE>   Olson first began serious work in that capacity in 1997 for
singer-actress Mare Winningham. In the years since, she's recorded a
wide range of styles, from elegant jazz and blues with Phil Upchurch
to some rowdy Texas guitar heroics with Jake Andrews.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very easy because she is a musician and knows how to
relate to musicians," says Upchurch, whose well-reviewed "Tell the
Truth!" was Olson's first jazz project. "I've worked with producers
who have no idea how to communicate with a musician. With her, the
communication was always dead-on."</TE>
<TE>   Sipping coffee at the Bakery, the North Hollywood studio where she
does most of her work, Olson says she aims for that same raw
spontaneity on all of her productions. "Things that are impromptu can
be so fresh," she says. "I really like working like that. I like that
kind of pressure. It brings out the best in me and the best in my
players. Flying by the seat of your pants, you know!</TE>
<TE>   "I've tried to develop a relationship with the performers where
it's not an adversarial relationship," she adds. "I'm here to help.
I'm not going to tell you what to do. And most of the people I've
worked with have a real sense about themselves. They know what they
want to sound like. And I need to help them get there."</TE>
<TE>   Olson's attitudes are little different from when she arrived in
Los Angeles from Texas in 1979. And she isn't going to change now.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at me," she says with a laugh. "Long hair. I've been wearing
cowboy boots all my life. I'm just what I am. I can't be trendy."</TE>

<HD>Holding a Grudge or a Dead Raccoon? Jilted Network Takes It
Out on Paula Zahn</HD>
<DH>Media* Since Fox News lost anchor Paula Zahn to rival CNN
last year, the digs have been plentiful--some humorous, others not so
funny.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID BAUDER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NEW YORK--Shortly before CNN unveiled the new studio it had built in
Manhattan for Paula Zahn's "American Morning" last month, a telephone
rang at the desk of a reporter.</LD>
<LD>   A publicist for Fox News Channel was calling. For anyone writing
about Zahn's show, she wanted to point out how much better Fox's
morning show, "Fox &amp; Friends," was doing in the ratings.</LD>
<LD>   With that in mind, CNN's new studio "is nothing more than
rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic," said Fox spokeswoman
Tracey Spector.</LD>
<TE>   As digs go, this one was relatively mild. But it follows a
pattern.</TE>
<TE>   Ever since Zahn jumped to CNN from Fox News Channel last fall, her
former employers have badmouthed her relentlessly. The jibes are
sometimes brutal, sometimes humorous and once even profane. The
underlying message seems clear: It's not wise to cross Fox News
Chairman Roger Ailes.</TE>
<TE>   Zahn was host of a prime-time news hour on Fox News Channel last
year when CNN weighed in with an offer she couldn't refuse--her own
three-hour morning show, reportedly at twice the salary.</TE>
<TE>   When Ailes learned of the offer, he fired her. CNN immediately
signed Zahn, and the cable channel put her on the air six months
earlier than it had expected.</TE>
<TE>   That dismissal is an important distinction to Fox. More than a
year after it happened, network representatives called Associated
Press to complain that a story about Zahn did not say that she had
been fired.</TE>
<TE>   Ailes set a tone for the post-Zahn era with a comment that quickly
became legendary, in part with the help of Fox's on-air
personalities. In an article about Zahn's firing, he minimized how
she had improved ratings in her time slot while at Fox News Channel.</TE>
<TE>   "I could have put a dead raccoon on the air this year and got a
better rating than last year," Ailes told the New York Times. "That's
all just the growth of our network. All our shows are up."</TE>
<TE>   Subsequently, the "Fox &amp; Friends" anchors talked about Zahn on the
air with a stuffed raccoon toy on the table in front of them. Fox
anchor Steve Doocy, cameras in tow, presented Zahn a gift basket that
included the stuffed raccoon after the new studio opened.</TE>
<TE>   Ailes sued Zahn's agents, claiming breach of contract. A New York
State Supreme Court judge dismissed the complaint in March.</TE>
<TE>   "From the very beginning, this was a case of sour grapes by Roger
Ailes," Zahn said at the time. "I am glad the judge saw it for what
it was and dismissed the suit as meritless."</TE>
<TE>   In the last year, Zahn's "Fox &amp; Friends" rivals have been her most
frequent needlers.</TE>
<TE>   In January, disc jockey Mancow, a "Fox &amp; Friends" contributor,
called Zahn a "knucklehead." Because she's the enemy, he said, "I
just want to punch her in the face."</TE>
<TE>   Two months later, Mancow performed an on-air skit with an actor he
said was portraying Zahn. He hit the actor in the face, knocked him
down and shouted, "I'll kill you, Paula. We will kill you, Paula."</TE>
<TE>   "That was great," anchor Brian Kilmeade said, although co-anchor
E.D. Hill urged Mancow to stop as he kept pounding away. Hill has
said that Zahn is host of a "bad program, but she's a nice woman."</TE>
<TE>   Mancow also made an off-color remark about Zahn that refers to her
hobby of playing the cello.</TE>
<TE>   When the CNN studio opened in Manhattan, trucks carrying Fox signs
circled the block around it. People distributing Fox merchandise and
wearing Fox T-shirts passed by the studio window, according to CNN.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Fox News Channel spokesman Robert Zimmerman was quoted
in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution: "Paula Zahn's supposed attempt
at reinventing herself as a journalist is like putting a fresh coat
of paint on an outhouse."</TE>
<TE>   Zahn would not comment for this story, but her network came to her
defense. CNN spokeswoman Christa Robinson said Ailes seemed obsessed
with his lost anchor.</TE>
<TE>   "At first, it was somewhat amusing, but one year later it's
getting old and, frankly, a little bizarre," Robinson said.</TE>
<TE>   "Paula simply chose to leave Fox to join CNN. Given the success of
her show and her reputation in the industry, I'm sure this was a
disappointment for them. Their actions are deliberate, sad and speak
for themselves."</TE>
<TE>   A Fox News Channel spokeswoman, Irena Steffen, said that "we don't
go out of our way to shoot at her."</TE>
<TE>   CNN and Zahn have attacked Fox, she said, declining to provide
examples. Both the "dead raccoon" and "outhouse" remarks appeared in
stories after CNN statements defending Zahn's ratings and describing
"American Morning" as a more traditional news show than its cable
rivals.</TE>
<TE>   "Why don't you ask why she's making a mountain out of a molehill?"
Steffen asked. "Why don't you ask why she's turning this around and
why she's making herself into a victim?"</TE>
<TE>   Steffen again pointed out the "Fox &amp; Friends" ratings advantage.
"As a former network star, it's sad Paula has sunk to this level, but
we wish her well," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The publicist turned down requests to talk with Ailes.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the motivation here may be revenge from a former political
street fighter who hates to lose, particularly to chief rival CNN.
Ailes retaliated months after Zahn's exit by plucking CNN's Greta Van
Susteren to fill Zahn's old time slot.</TE>
<TE>   Oddly, Ailes' best revenge may simply be the ratings; Fox News
Channel passed CNN in average viewership earlier this year and hasn't
given up the lead since.</TE>
<TE>   It would seem to make all the trash talk redundant.</TE>

<HD>Inspired by Criminals Who Couldn't Cut It</HD>
<DH>Avid fans of the Italian heist movie 'Big Deal on Madonna
Street,' brothers Anthony and Joe Russo decided to remake it with a
Cleveland angle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For their first feature, "Welcome to Collinwood," Cleveland-born
brothers Anthony and Joe Russo decided to transpose one of their
favorite films, the 1958 Italian classic "Big Deal on Madonna
Street," from post-World War II Rome to an economically depressed
Cleveland of today.</LD>
<LD>   "One of the reasons we thought to remake it was because we saw a
lot of similarities between post-World War II Rome and Cleveland,"
Joe Russo says. "Cleveland was kind of brutalized by the industrial
crunch."</LD>
<LD>   The $8-million production, which opened Friday, attracted the
attention of Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney as
producers--Clooney also has a small part as a hot-tempered
safecracker in a wheelchair--and an eclectic cast that includes
William H. Macy, Patricia Clarkson, Sam Rockwell and Michael Jeter.</LD>
<TE>   But attempting the comedy-caper genre can hold a minefield of
problems. For every "Big Deal on Madonna Street," there are such lame
farces as "The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight" (1971). Even
renowned French director Louis Malle couldn't pull off the first
American remake of "Big Deal," the disastrously labored 1984 version,
"Crackers," which was set in San Francisco with Donald Sutherland and
Sean Penn.</TE>
<TE>   "The first draft we wrote we hated," Anthony Russo says, speaking
in Los Angeles last week. "The sensibilities of the late '50s Italy
are just radically different than the 21st century America. It was a
long process in terms of us finding the voice. At the same time, we
feel very close to the Italian sensibility, to European cinema and
cinema history, and Cleveland is just chock-full of European
neighborhoods."</TE>
<TE>   One reason the writing-directing brothers loved "Big Deal" so
much, Joe Russo says, is that it is a universal story about lovable
losers. "Everybody could identify with the underdog characters, and
what happened to them was so tragically funny, we felt that would
translate. It was just trying to find a new voice to apply it to."</TE>
<TE>   Directed by Mario Monicelli, "Big Deal on Madonna Street"
satirized such acclaimed caper dramas as John Huston's "The Asphalt
Jungle" (1950) and Jules Dassin's dazzling 1955 "Rififi."</TE>
<TE>   Instead of accomplished, analytic thieves, "Big Deal" is populated
with wannabes who team up to steal money from a safe in a pawnshop by
breaking into the apartment next door and plowing through the
conjoining wall.</TE>
<TE>   There's the hopeless accomplice of a jailed car thief, a thief who
is taking care of his mother, a hot-tempered Sicilian diligently
guarding his sister's virginity, a financially strapped photographer
taking care of his baby by himself because his wife is in jail for
smuggling cigarettes, and a handsome but hapless boxer with a glass
jaw. The film, which was nominated for a foreign-language Oscar,
starred Vittorio Gassman, Claudia Cardinale and Marcello Mastroianni.</TE>
<TE>   There had been crime-caper films before "Big Deal on Madonna
Street," most notably the 1952 British comedy "The Lavender Hill Mob"
with Alec Guinness, but the international success of "Madonna" really
created the genre of bumbling but sweet thieves attempting an
elaborate heist. Even Dassin got into the act with his acclaimed 1964
"Topkapi."</TE>
<TE>   Other popular entries in the genre include "The Hot Rock" (1972)
with Robert Redford, William Wyler's "How to Steal a Million" (1966),
"Gambit" with Michael Caine and Shirley MacLaine, "Palookaville"
(1996) and Wes Anderson's "Bottle Rocket" (1996).</TE>
<TE>   The Russos realized the key ingredient in making a comedy caper
work was getting the right cast. In "Topkapi," for example, Peter
Ustinov won an Oscar for his role as a hapless thief; "How to Steal a
Million" worked due to the charm of Audrey Hepburn, Peter O'Toole and
Hugh Griffith.</TE>
<TE>   With "Collinwood," Joe Russo says, "we were trying to create a
film that was emotionally grounded and a character piece. You really
care about these characters. So we got people who are supremely well
trained so they would approach the characters from an emotional point
of view and let the humor come from the situation."</TE>
<TE>   Their edict to the actors was simply don't try to be funny. "We
know that all of these actors had an amazing capacity for drama and
comedy," Anthony Russo says. "We would know they would never pander
to humor."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Joe Russo says, they wanted these characters to "sort of
present the arc of the ethnic Americans through the 20th century.
Even though the film is a comedy, we wanted to address an important
theme--is there any physical reward in the American dream? When these
characters get to where they get to at the end of the film, do they
have to look inside to find value when all the material things they
were chasing after slipped away from them?"</TE>

<HD>Does Riefenstahl Make a Fascist Statement?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALLAN deSOUZA</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Flicking through the Calendar section, I was surprised to see a
full-length photograph of a naked woman, her skin slicked down with
oil. It wasn't an ad for the Tropicana's mud wrestling, nor Playboy's
final acceptance into the mainstream; no, this was a review by David
Pagel of Leni Riefenstahl's latest show at Fahey/Klein Gallery ("Leni
Riefenstahl: Grace and Beauty in Africa," Sept. 20).</LD>
<LD>   It is unusual to see full-frontal nudity in a daily paper (at
least in the United States), and I presume its acceptance was due to
it being a photograph of a black, "tribal" woman. The reasoning must
be that she is in her "natural" state, rather than this being a
prurient sexual display, which it would have been had she been a
white woman. Don't misunderstand me: I have nothing against nudity,
but I am bothered by this racial double standard.</LD>
<LD>   It's a fallacy to pretend that "tribal" women are not sexually
alluring to white men; National Geographic and its ilk have provided
the first masturbatory images for many a young boy. I'm reminded of
the massive disavowal by generations of white Southern American boys,
say, or white South African boys whose primary caregivers and first
objects of affection and sexual interest were black nannies, but who
then grew up to perpetuate a slave or apartheid system.</LD>
<TE>   That would make for an illuminating study, but I'd like to
concentrate on the photograph's caption, "Leni Riefenstahl's
photographs celebrate the beauty and sensuality of tribal people in
the Sudan," and on Pagel's concluding sentence, that "it's important
to remember that Riefenstahl is neither an anthropologist nor a
tourist, but an artist--an old-fashioned Romantic, whose quest for
beauty has taken her to the far ends of the Earth."</TE>
<TE>   Beauty uber ales may well be Pagel's usual shtick, but the
questions that he raises here but leaves unanswered (and unconsidered
when it matters most) are whether the pursuit of beauty is neutral
and whether it transcends other concerns such as--in this case--a
melding with fascism.</TE>
<TE>   There's a spectrum of debate and opinion whether art and artists
should bear social responsibility or whether it is all a matter of
individual freedoms, but to suggest that the pursuit of beauty
overrides all other concerns smacks a little too much of the
particular past that Riefenstahl's apologists would have us
conveniently forget.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, there is often a nostalgia and sense of loss that
motivates the pursuit of beauty--a nostalgia that also seeps into
acts of rebelliousness and personal liberation, whether from henna
parties or tattooing and piercings of "urban primitives" or
goddess-worship or drumming circles or suburban rap or militant
environmental groups. It's unsurprising that such examples fall on
the left of the political compass, but prevailing models for
Euro-American rebellion have always tended to be drawn from
philosophies and physical markings of "the primitive" and the
"oriental."</TE>
<TE>   What is more problematic is that such nostalgia fits seamlessly
into the right in general--most notably its various fundamentalist
strains--and into a fascist aesthetic in particular. It's not
necessary to know about Riefenstahl's Nazi ties; her ongoing
obsessions with the noble savage as an untainted specimen fixed in
time, as well as her focus on blood and physical prowess, are
sufficient cause for question.</TE>
<TE>   The Nazis didn't invent the cult of the body, but, syncretic breed
that they were in spite of their protestations at purity, they were
adept at tapping into an existing body culture, especially of
masculinity, and overlaying it with regurgitations from every past
imperial or martial society.</TE>
<TE>   They were also complex if not contradictory racists; they could
feel personal injury at the success of Jesse Owens at the same time
as admiring the physicality of tribal people. Riefenstahl's current
images, particularly because of their "beauty and sensuality," fit
snugly into National Socialist ideologies of racial purity. The Jews
were targeted as much because they were Jewish and European, and
because they were integrated into European society and not safely at
a distance as are the Nuba of Sudan.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Riefenstahl's skills and previous cinematic innovations,
her work remains a celebration of the mythically classical and, in
that sense, is profoundly anti-modernist. To the Nazis, modernism was
degenerate precisely because it was a process of mongrelization.
Riefenstahl travels widely, even "to the far ends of the Earth," but
continues to celebrate untainted spheres of separation. It's one
thing for her to enter the world of the Nuba; it would be another for
the Nuba to enter hers.</TE>
<TE>   Pagel has it wrong. If only Riefenstahl were merely a tourist and
anthropologist; unfortunately, even though she's seductive with a
camera, her fascist affiliations are still somewhat naked.</TE>

<HD>Hateful Sisters, Set to Music</HD>
<DH>Theater* 'Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?' makes its debut
as a musical in Houston this week. Where it goes from there is
undecided.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KRISTEN HAYS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Jane Hudson lives in a gloomy mansion with her paralyzed sister,
Blanche. She over-paints her face and lips to almost clown-like
dimensions and lives for the glory days when she was a child star in
vaudeville.</LD>
<LD>   She also hates Blanche, a once glamorous movie star who snapped
her spine while trying to mow down her sister with a car. Jane beats
the wheelchair-bound Blanche, steals money from her and serves
Blanche roast rat for "din-din."</LD>
<LD>   "She's terrifying--she really is. The more mad she goes, the more
we seem to enjoy it," says Millicent Martin, who portrays Jane in a
new musical based on the campy gothic thriller "Whatever Happened to
Baby Jane?" Martin takes on the role Bette Davis immortalized on film
almost 40 years ago. Leslie Denniston portrays Blanche, played by
Joan Crawford.</LD>
<TE>   The new $2.3-million show, produced by Houston's Theatre Under the
Stars, debuts Wednesday for a three-week run. It still tells the tale
of Jane and Blanche, shackled together by need and guilt. But Theatre
Under the Stars founder and president Frank Young says the musical
explores the sisters' history more than the movie, which revived the
fading careers of Davis and Crawford and tantalized movie gossips
with tales of their on-set battles.</TE>
<TE>   Young says the musical "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?" offers
more about the sisters' childhoods and how their father favored Jane,
leading to the destructive adult relationship of the sisters. He also
said it offers more humor and less camp.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not what everybody thinks this is," Young says. "They all
think it's either a drag show or very dark and macabre, something
they're not sure they want to bring their kids to. This is an
old-timey Broadway musical. There are a lot of laughs, but it's
dark."</TE>
<TE>   In the film, Blanche's disability keeps her imprisoned in the
house. Jane, who can come and go as she pleases, dreams of
resurrecting her career--in one scene she even dresses up like a
little girl with ruffled dress and bow in hair and rasps her once
signature song, "I've Written a Letter to Daddy," to a con artist who
is supposedly coaching her comeback.</TE>
<TE>   The entire musical takes place in the house, where a drunken Jane
looks in a mirror and sees herself as a star surrounded by dancers.
Blanche is a former MGM musical star who escapes Jane's abuse by
losing herself in television reruns of her old movies. Flashbacks
serve up splashy musical numbers that showcase the stars as they were
when audiences adored them.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't want to go onstage and do a send-up of Bette Davis and
Joan Crawford," Martin says. "We wanted it to stand on its own, so
it's not just a remake of the film with music added." Martin, a
two-time Tony nominee started her stage career in the chorus of the
London production of "South Pacific." She has a string of stage
credits there and in New York, including "The Boy Friend," with Julie
Andrews, and "42nd Street," with Jerry Orbach.</TE>
<TE>   She has made guest appearances for the past two years as Gertrude
Moon on TV's "Frasier," and previously played Lili Faversham on NBC's
"Days of Our Lives." She also appeared opposite Michael Caine in the
film "Alfie."</TE>
<TE>   Denniston, known as Maeve Stoddard on CBS' "Guiding Light" from
1985 to '88 and Carolyn Crawford on "As the World Turns" from 1990 to
'91, also appeared on Broadway in "City of Angels" and "To
Grandmother's House We Go."</TE>
<TE>   Henry Farrell, whose novel inspired the film, also wrote the story
for the musical. Composer Lee Pockriss, who co-wrote "Itsy Bitsy
Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini" and "Johnny Angel," wrote the
music for "Baby Jane" while lyricist Hal Hackaday provided the words.</TE>
<TE>   Pockriss has only one other Broadway musical to his credit, 1963's
"Tovarich," which earned star Vivien Leigh a Tony Award. Hackaday
wrote lyrics for several musicals in the 1970s, including three that
had short runs after New York premieres: "Minnie's Boys" and
"Goodtime Charley," and 1987's "Teddy and Alice."</TE>
<TE>   "Baby Jane" has generated interest from producers, tour-booking
agents and national theater chains such as Nederlander. It may or may
not go to Broadway. "This is going to be an absolute triumph or a
disastrous embarrassment. There is no middle ground," says Young.</TE>
<TE>   The show got its start with a 1998 workshop and concert in
Brighton, England. Producer Michael Rose, whose West End productions
in London produced "Tap Dogs" and "Hot Shoe Shuffle," had acquired
the rights to "Baby Jane." Martin joined other cast members and a
17-piece orchestra that brought the musical concept to life under the
direction of David Taylor, who is directing the Houston debut.</TE>
<TE>   Many Producers on Hand</TE>
<TE>   Van Kaplan, producer of the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera, a
56-year-old musical theater, is among the throngs of independent
producers who will attend the musical's opening to see if they want
to add it to upcoming seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things we are most interested in is the development
and creation of new musical theater work," Kaplan says.</TE>
<TE>   In years past, musicals usually got their start in New
York--either on or off-Broadway--and then toured the country before
independent producers could obtain the rights to do their own
versions. But Broadway producers are taking fewer chances, relying on
revivals of established shows to avoid multimillion-dollar failures.</TE>
<TE>   Also, independents may have to wait years for the rights to big
hits such as "The Producers" or "Hairspray," while other shows, like
the Tony-winning musical "Urinetown," may not appeal to audiences
outside of New York City.</TE>
<TE>   "A show with 'urine' in the title is very New York," Young says.
"Here, we pushed the limits with 'La Cage aux Folles' [the story of
gay lovers who run a transvestite club], and at the intermission
there were a lot of walkouts."</TE>
<TE>   So independent producers like Young and Kaplan develop their own
shows that cost less outside of New York and gain their footing
outside the purview of often blistering critics. They joined forces
in the nonprofit Independent Presenters Network to share interests
and sometimes invest in shows they want to produce.</TE>
<TE>   Theatre Under the Stars has produced other shows of its own,
including "Jekyll &amp; Hyde," which recouped its costs from a subsequent
tour before getting a lukewarm reception in New York. Houston also
was the world premiere site for Disney's "Beauty and the Beast," in
1993, which turned into a Broadway hit. If Broadway snubs "Baby
Jane," Young says he can offer it to the IPN for a 40-week tour. If
that doesn't work, he can license it to individual theaters.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a Plan A, a Plan B and a Plan C," Young says. "We can
afford to fail. Our audiences like to come in and see something
different."</TE>

<HD>Polyphonic Spree a Hallelujah Good-Time Treat</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Most bands want to make new converts at their concerts. When the
Polyphonic Spree made it's California debut at the Fold in the Derby
on Friday, it seemed there might be some real conversions.</LD>
<LD>   "Where do we sign up?" shouted one fan as the scruffy, sprawling
Dallas ensemble--two dozen singers and musicians, all cloaked in
white robes and ecstatic joy--brought its sunny, apostolic pop into a
gloomy world. Indeed, it wouldn't have been surprising if half the
audience spontaneously donned robes (they were on sale in the back),
joined the choir and at the end got on the bus as one of the flock.</LD>
<LD>   It was "Godspell" minus the messianic angst. It was (in the words
of one fan) "the Muppets get stoned and go to church"--though not
specifically religious. It was the Brian Wilson Glee Club and "Tommy"
and "All You Need Is Love" rolled into one. And it just may be the
antidote to, well, whatever is bugging you.</LD>
<TE>   A cynical observer could project a certain dark potential in the
evangelical zeal of curly-topped, mutton-chopped leader Tim
DeLaughter (formerly of the more conventional band Tripping Daisy) as
he leapt and pointed upward, singing such lines as "Hey, it's the sun
and it makes me shine." Talk about your cult bands.</TE>
<TE>   But the music, bubbly '60s English flower-pop with percolating
French horn and piccolo and tubular bells and tympani joining more
standard instrumentation with perhaps more spirit than precision, is
guilelessly disarming. It's easy to see how this group has become the
hipsters' pick of the moment, making true believers of such notables
as David Bowie, who took the band to London recently for the Meltdown
Festival he curated. (Bowie's "Five Years" was Friday's encore.) And
the smiles of the musicians and fans alike were undeniable.</TE>
<TE>   Let it all shine on.</TE>

<HD>Jimmy Eat World Spices a Dour Picnic</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANDY LEWIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When punk rock exploded 25 years ago, one of the odder results was
the sight of hordes of fans singing along en masse to songs preaching
anarchy and individuality. A generation later we have similarly
disorienting events such as Saturday's This Ain't No Picnic gathering
at Oak Canyon Ranch in Santiago Canyon, where indie-rock bands that
plumb the depths of alienated youth can create a community of the
emotionally isolated.</LD>
<LD>   You couldn't even call it a festival, because there was little
that was remotely festive until the very end, when main-stage
headliners Guided by Voices and Jimmy Eat World introduced at least a
modicum of joy to the mix. Prior to that, fans often looked on,
expressionless, as various bands offered up songs channeling inner
pain and yearnings for emotional connection.</LD>
<LD>   No picnic, indeed.</LD>
<TE>   The upside of the annual event is its celebration of musical
independence. The thrust of the noon-till-sundown show, featuring
nearly two dozen acts, was the very antithesis of the prefab sounds
that have dominated the sales charts and Top 40 radio in recent
years.</TE>
<TE>   It provides a refreshing reminder that plenty of musicians and
fans are still attuned to music that doesn't fit the commercial
formulas. Case in point: the Mars Volta, the band created by singer
Cedric Bixler and guitarist Omar Rodriguez after they pulled the plug
on the highly regarded At the Drive-In.</TE>
<TE>   Their set was a lesson in neo-psychedelic experimentalism, more
admirable for the sense of musical and emotional liberation it
conveyed than as music you'd want to hear again in an unaltered state
of consciousness.</TE>
<TE>   Blonde Redhead paid more heed to the idea of song structure, but
the trio still emphasized sonic mood in frequently extended jams,
which singer-guitarists Kazu Makino and Amadeo Pace punctuated with
mournful vocals, Makino's high-pitched cat-like yowl evoking memories
of Yoko Ono. The Donnas highlighted the second-stage lineup with a
punk punch as muscular as most of their male counterparts, but with a
sultriness that's rarely been part of the genre.</TE>
<TE>   Pop punk band of the moment Jimmy Eat World is far more pop than
punk, but it's easy to see why the quartet has caught on with a
significant number of fans. The group has given them something to
catch: lyrical and instrumental hooks, sing-along-ready melodies and
expressions of sincerity, even hope, for a disillusioned generation.
It capped the main-stage portion on a note so rejuvenating you wanted
to spread the checkered blanket and break out the potato salad.</TE>

<HD>TLC Serves Slices of Life--and Teens Bite</HD>
<DH>Television* The channel attracts young viewers with daytime
shows about real people such as 'A Wedding Story' and 'A Baby Story.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANICE RHOSHALLE LITTLEJOHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kids will always want their MTV for videos and pop culture fads. And
yes, they're "watching the Frog" and the flawless beauties on the WB.
But when it comes to daytime drama, teenage girls are tuning into
TLC.</LD>
<LD>   That's right; after a day spent at school, a growing audience is
punching the buttons for the Learning Channel.</LD>
<LD>   Thanks to the real-life sagas of TLC's daytime bloc--"A Wedding
Story," "A Baby Story," "A Dating Story," "A Makeover Story" and "A
Personal Story"--the network that set its sights on adult viewers is
getting some younger eyeballs.</LD>
<TE>   The formats for the shows are all pretty well set, with a personal
story told more or less from beginning to end. So in "A Baby Story,"
for example, each episode begins with the couple in the early phases
of pregnancy. The cameras follow various prenatal visits, stay on the
couple as they face any possible complications and go right into the
delivery room when the baby is born. A denouement catches up with the
parents and the newborn a few weeks or months after delivery date. "A
Wedding Story" follows the story from the planning to the reception,
and after. In all cases, real people are featured, warts and all.</TE>
<TE>   According to data from Nielsen Media Research, TLC has seen a 7%
increase in female viewers 12-29 over the previous year in
daytime--tying TLC with Lifetime in daytime ratings for women in that
age group.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the shows that had scores of women chatting on the phone, and
online, are the talk around the lockers on high school and college
campuses. And word is traveling fast.</TE>
<TE>   "My best friend and I would watch the shows after school--then
we'd go back to school and tell people about it and they'd be like,
'What are you talking about?' " says Chasne Turner, 15, a 10th-grader
at Sentinel High in Corona. "Eventually, we'd come to school and
everybody would be talking about, 'Did you watch? ... ' It's
definitely the topic of conversation."</TE>
<TE>   "It's interesting and it's also informative, so I don't feel like
I'm wasting my time watching TV," confesses Selma Alamin, 15, an
11th-grader at Falls Church High in Virginia. "And my parents don't
like me watching music videos because there's always naked girls in
the videos. Whenever I watch TLC, they don't say anything, so I like
that."</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, TLC's executives are pleased with the brain
boom.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever age your viewers are, it's all about the network being
relevant to them," says Roger Marmet, TLC vice president of
programming and acting general manager. He credits the cult success
of its neighbor-helping-neighbor remodeling show, "Trading Spaces,"
for the demographic shift. "If we can bring in younger viewers now in
daytime and also have shows in prime time that are relevant to them
and also have them stick around for several years, then we've done
our job in connecting with viewers."</TE>
<TE>   A New Season of Stories</TE>
<TE>   The network kicked off a new season of episodes with the wedding
celebrations, live births, blind dates, physical transformations, and
the life-altering surgeries starring average men and women, largely
from the United States and Canada.</TE>
<TE>   "The strategy behind everything being a 'story' was to link
together programming with a first-person account of their
experiences, not filtered through a reporter," Marmet says. "It's
just really a day in the life, and a really special day in the life,
of these people. It's not a report about these things but traditional
storytelling."</TE>
<TE>   It's reality television that's really about real life. "It's fun
to watch a show where you're experiencing a major moment in
somebody's life with them," says Banyan Productions Chairman Susan
Cohen Dicker, who produces the "Wedding," "Dating" and "Makeover"
series, as well as "Trading Spaces." ("A Baby Story" and "A Personal
Story" are produced by True Entertainment and Film Garden,
respectively.) "No matter how many you do, even as a producer of
them, you never know how somebody's going to react and what's going
to happen and you really are there at that moment, which kids
recognize because it's not as scripted and its not as manipulated."</TE>
<TE>   That's certainly the appeal for Savanah King. "It's really an
eye-opener," says the 18-year-old freshman at Lane College in
Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   "These shows just give you a different outlook on the world and
how it really is."</TE>
<TE>   "It makes sense to me," says San Francisco family psychologist
Brenda Wade of the appeal of reality TV on kids. "If you think about
what's going on developmentally during that time period, kids are
trying to come up with a script. They're literally trying to figure
out--Who am I? Where do I fit it? Who are my peers? What is life all
about? And what would be more interesting to someone who is trying to
figure out all these things than to see someone else's story," says
Wade, who watches TLC with her 17- and 19-year-old daughters.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a kind of programming that wasn't available before when
we used to have 'Leave It to Beaver' and things like that," Wade
continues, "and this was the problem back then--we thought everyone
else's life was like 'Leave It to Beaver.' Oh, weren't we surprised
when we found out that it was dysfunction at the junction for
everybody. Now these reality shows come right down front, and it's,
ah ha, that's what goes on in other people's homes and families. It's
more than voyeurism; they're trying to learn about people and trying
to create their own inner script."</TE>
<TE>   But programmers still have a lot to learn about young people, says
Media Week online columnist Marc Berman. "Teens are much more worldly
than what programmers give them credit for in terms of what they'll
watch on television," says Berman, whose 8-year-old son and
11-year-old daughter are fans of "A Baby Story"--even before the
birth of their sister five months ago.</TE>
<TE>   "This is really a validation for the teen viewer. Just because
they're in that 12-to-18 demographic does not mean they're only
watching 'Dawson's Creek' or MTV and VH1, or even UPN to some extent.
They're interested in all sorts of different things and they want to
watch different kinds of things when they turn on the television."</TE>
<TE>   The Formula Works</TE>
<TE>   Still, with teen loyalties changing as fast as Gap ads, Marmet
says it's unlikely that TLC will be doing special "teen week"
episodes of these shows just to attract more young viewers. Besides,
the network has a formula that's working well and, to paraphrase the
adage, there's no point in futzing with it.</TE>
<TE>   "If you go out there and target teens overtly, you stand a chance
of alienating [them]," Marmet says cautiously. "It's a very fickle
demographic, teenagers, and if they think they're being marketed to,
it's a turn-off. It's adults saying, 'Hey kids, it's cool.' You do
that and you'll have a very skeptical bunch of kids."</TE>
<TE>   For Cohen Dicker, creating a real-life teen story series is
intriguing. "As a mother of a preteen, that marketplace really
interests me, but it's nothing we've gotten anybody to buy into yet,"
she says.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is finding compelling stories about kids. "You need to
be of a certain age to really express yourself in a certain way and
have a life history that makes your story more interesting," she
says. "That doesn't mean teens don't warrant it, but we need to make
sure that there's enough of a story to share."</TE>
<TE>   As Wade sees it, the warm and fuzzy TLC tales can provide teens
with a positive outlook on their own life stories. "Teenagers like
happy endings," she says. "And they're trying to get a happy-ending
script together if they can."</TE>
<TE>   On TLC: "A Baby Story" is shown at 9 and 9:30 a.m., repeated at 3
and 3:30 p.m. weekdays;</TE>
<TE>   "A Wedding Story," is at 10 and 10:30 a.m., repeated at 2 and 2:30
p.m. weekdays; "A Dating Story" is at 1 and 1:30 p.m. weekdays;</TE>
<TE>   "A Makeover Story" is at noon and 12:30 p.m. weekdays. "A Personal
Story" is at 11 and 11:30 a.m. weekdays.</TE>

<LD>Give Rosanna Gamson credit. As artistic director of Rosanna
Gamson/World Wide, the choreographer-dancer presented her company
members in an evening of their own works over the weekend at Highways
Performance Space. The seven pieces, performed under the banner
"Terra Nova: New Dance/New Theater," ran the, well, gamut.</LD>
<LD>   On the plus side was Gamson's "Darker," exquisitely danced by
Peter Kwong and the choreographer. With a live, mournful cello score
by Shane W. Cadman, this duet about love and its aftermath exuded
lyricism, highlighted by sensuous unisons. Another potent duet: Cesar
Cazares' "UnWinding," with Lilia Lopez rocking in neo-Keystone Kops
mode (shimmying and leaping), and Barnaby Levy moving robotically to
Eduardo F. Lopez's sound collage.</LD>
<LD>   "Ausencia" (Absence), choreographed by Edgar Ovando, offered a
startling display of Butoh-inspired back bending as Ovando, Cazares
and Erica Finley maneuvered ritualistically to a tape of women
chanting.</LD>
<TE>   Also alluringly austere: Johnny Tu in his solo, "Cardboard
Blanket." Bursting with elegant, occasionally violent arm gestures
and stamped with tai chi-like deliberateness, Tu explored life among
the homeless.</TE>
<TE>   Less successful were works making use of props and spoken text:
"From Delphi to Dodona," choreographed and performed by Deborah Rosen
with Jeremy Jacobs, featured lunges and athletic lifts, but the
shower of fortune cookies was overkill as they divined the future.
Indeed, Grace Umali's and Richard Owens' live musical accompaniment
proved more compelling. "Stone Blind Love," created and performed by
Dana Wieluns and Bill Celentano, saw the duo acrobatically moving
within a circle of stones and spouting poetry, to little effect.</TE>
<TE>   "Berserker," Paul Outlaw's take on Nat Turner and Jeffrey Dahmer,
was an unfortunate cross between Karen Finley and the comic
Gallagher.</TE>
<TE>   Neither profound nor funny, Outlaw splattered tomatoes and smeared
his naked body with red noodles, popcorn and honeydew chunks,
simultaneously giving irksome voice to the pair.</TE>

<LD>To promote their new film, "Swept Away," which Screen Gems opens
Friday in limited release, Madonna and her husband, the British
director Guy Ritchie, made a playful 30-minute special that recently
aired on MTV.</LD>
<LD>   "Why did you hire me to star in your film and not Julia Roberts?"
the pop star asks Ritchie, to which the filmmaker replies, "Actually,
I did ask her and she said no."</LD>
<LD>   Jokes aside, does anyone doubt that Madonna would love to carve
out a film career as successful as Oscar-winner Roberts if only she
could finally cross over from music to film?</LD>
<TE>   Over the years, Madonna has had mixed success dabbling in movies.
The promise she showed in 1985's "Desperately Seeking Susan"
evaporated the following year in the box office bomb "Shanghai
Surprise" with then-husband Sean Penn. She was engaging in the 1992
ensemble hit, "A League of Their Own," but then came the stilted
melodrama "Body of Evidence." Madonna won over many critics with her
title role in the musical "Evita" but stumbled in "The Next Best
Thing."</TE>
<TE>   In "Swept Away," Madonna plays a rich, snotty, spoiled woman of 40
who meets her match in a strapping young fisherman after they wind up
shipwrecked on a beautiful, deserted island. Ritchie's film is a
contemporary adaptation of Lina Wertmuller's acclaimed 1974 sexual
polemic, "Swept Away ... by an Unusual Destiny in the Blue Sea of
August."</TE>
<TE>   The fisherman, Giuseppe, is played by a hunky actor named Adriano
Giannini, who happens to be the son of Italian actor Giancarlo
Giannini, who played Giuseppe in Wertmuller's film.</TE>
<TE>   Whether Madonna can find success with Ritchie behind the camera
remains to be seen. But Paul Dergarabedian, president of the box
office tracking firm Exhibitor Relations Co., notes that Ritchie's
previous films, the modern British gangster vehicles "Lock, Stock and
Two Smoking Barrels" and "Snatch" starring Brad Pitt, each attracted
a following. They also garnered attention for their distinctively
blunt juxtaposition of violence and humor.</TE>

<HD>Hannibal's Hunt for 'Red' October</HD>
<DH>Box Office* 'Dragon' sets a record for films opening this
month with $37.5 million. 'Alabama' still sweet; 'Greek Wedding'
bests 'Blair Witch Project.'</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Halloween came early this year with trick-or-treating courtesy of
Hannibal Lecter.</LD>
<LD>   "Red Dragon," directed by Brett Ratner and starring Anthony
Hopkins in his third turn as the cannibalistic psychiatrist, leaped
into first place this weekend with an estimated $37.5 million,
averaging an impressive $11,165 per theater.</LD>
<LD>   The Universal picture, which also stars Edward Norton, Ralph
Fiennes and Emily Watson, set a record for films opening in October,
surpassing the previous milestone set by "Meet the Parents," which
brought in $28.6 million two years ago for the same studio.</LD>
<TE>   "Red Dragon," the second movie based on the first of three Thomas
Harris books featuring Lecter, did not bring in as much as
"Hannibal," which opened with $58 million in February 2001. Still,
"Red Dragon" grossed more than four times as much as the $8.6-million
original 1986 film version, "Manhunter," took in during in its entire
theatrical run.</TE>
<TE>   The second film in the series and the first with Hopkins in the
role of Hannibal, "The Silence of the Lambs" opened in February 1991
with $13.8 million and went on to earn a total of $165 million as
well as several Oscars, including best picture, best actor (Hopkins)
and best-adapted screenplay for Ted Tally, who also scripted "Red
Dragon."</TE>
<TE>   "Sweet Home Alabama" dropped a respectable 39% from last weekend,
grossing an estimated $21.6 million in second place for a 10-day
total of $65.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   Disney's romantic comedy is well on its way to becoming Reese
Witherspoon's highest-grossing movie, outpacing last year's surprise
hit "Legally Blonde," which took in $96.5 million at the box office.
Jackie Chan's "The Tuxedo" came in at No. 3, with $10.1 million,
dropping only 33% and grossing a total of $28.1 million in 10 days.</TE>
<TE>   IFC Films' "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" has become the
highest-grossing independent film ever, coming in at No. 4, taking in
$8.4 million over the weekend for a total of $148 million. The record
was previously held by Artisan's "The Blair Witch Project," which in
1999 made $140.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   The MGM hit "Barbershop" came in at No. 5 five, dropping only 32%
from last weekend with an estimated $6.8 million and a cumulative box
office of $60.2 million in four weeks. Although the movie prompted a
flurry of criticism from some African American leaders for what they
considered inappropriate humor at the expense of civil-rights icons
Rosa Parks and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., the movie has
continued to do extremely well.</TE>
<TE>   In sixth place was the computer-animated "Jonah: A VeggieTales
Movie." Considering that it is not well-known among many mainstream
moviegoers, the well-reviewed Christian-oriented film did very well
in its first weekend out, grossing $6.5 million in only 940 theaters.
Artisan Entertainment, the movie's distributor, did not release it in
the Northeast because video sales there of the "VeggieTales" series
have never caught on as well as in other parts of the country. But
because of its impressive opening, the studio plans to expand the
film's release next weekend.</TE>
<TE>   The Goldie Hawn/Susan Sarandon film "The Banger Sisters" continues
to hang in the top 10, coming in at No. 7. The Fox Searchlight
picture made $3.6 million over the weekend for a total of $24.3
million in its third week.</TE>
<TE>   Paramount's expensive flop "The Four Feathers" was in eighth
place, grossing only $2.1 million over the weekend for a total of $15
million. Disney's "Moonlight Mile" did very well its second weekend
in release, grossing $2 million in 434 theaters. The film, which has
grossed a total of $2.4 million, rose 507% because the studio added
nearly 400 theaters from last weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Rounding out the top 10, Fox Searchlight's "One Hour Photo" made
an additional $1.7 million for a total of $28.7 million. This
weekend's top 10 movies grossed an estimated $100.3 million, up
nearly 25% from the comparable weekend last year.</TE>
<TE>   In other box-office news, Paramount Classics' drama "Bloody
Sunday," chronicling the 1970s massacre of civilians by British
troops in Northern Ireland, grossed an amazing $16,000 per screen in
its limited New York release. The film, directed by Paul Greengrass,
was released on only two screens in New York and made $32,000 over
the weekend. The movie opens Friday in Los Angeles.</TE>

<HD>'Sights Once Seen' an Epic Reimagining of a Trip West</HD>
<DH>Robert Shlaer uses the daguerreotype process to recapture
lost images first made on Fremont's 1853 expedition to the Rockies.</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If the early 19th century process of daguerreotypy represents
photography in its infancy, you might assume that today's digital
technology brings the medium to full maturity. For better or for
worse. Technically, the photographic process has never been easier or
quicker. But that ease lends photographs a commonness that makes them
less consequential, simpler to dismiss with jaded half attention.</LD>
<LD>   The conditions of infancy offer a good corrective. For all of its
logistical challenges and sticky surfaces, infancy is a time of
wonder and discovery. Everything, absolutely everything, is fresh.
New. A source of awe.</LD>
<LD>   A compelling exhibition now at the Huntington Library sends us
back to that state of utter openness, back to the era of the
daguerreotype and its power of first impressions. The show, "Sights
Once Seen: Daguerreotyping Fremont's Last Expedition Through the
Rockies," takes us on a circuitous, provocative journey. Our guide is
Robert Shlaer (born in 1942), a man who straddles 19th and 21st
centuries, having given up a career in theoretical biology to become
a professional daguerreotypist.</LD>
<TE>   The daguerreotype, a unique positive image on a copper plate
covered with highly polished silver, made its dramatic debut in
France in 1839. That same year, in England, another photographic
process--the calotype--was unveiled. It offered less image clarity
than the daguerreotype, but being a negative-positive process, it had
reproducibility in its favor.</TE>
<TE>   Photography's technical evolution spun off from the calotype, but
for nearly 20 years, daguerreotypes were the rage. "Their exquisite
perfection," a journalist marveled, "almost transcends the bounds of
sober belief."</TE>
<TE>   Because daguerreotypes turned out best under the controlled
conditions of the studio, the process was used primarily for
portraiture. The outdoors proved too fickle an environment to produce
consistent results, and the process required a good deal of
on-the-spot preparation of plates, relatively long exposure time and
development shortly thereafter. Landscape daguerreotypes exist, but
not in great numbers, and daguerreotypy never attained the
scientific, cartographic and political usefulness that later photo
processes did on survey expeditions of the American West. But it's
not, as we learn from this show, for lack of trying.</TE>
<TE>   As early as the 1840s, survey teams attempted to document their
explorations via daguerreotypes, but with scant success, and
photography's key role in the era is generally ascribed to the late
1860s and '70s. Yet the first comprehensive photographic
documentation of an expedition occurred much earlier, as Shlaer's
show (organized by the Museum of New Mexico) and its tremendously
useful catalog reveal. In 1853-54, Solomon Nunes Carvalho (1815-1897)
successfully produced 300 daguerreotypes on a five-month expedition
headed west from Kansas City across the Rockies. The journey was
organized by the larger-than-life figure of Col. John Charles Fremont
(1813-1890), Civil War major general, California senator,
presidential candidate, dubbed the "Pathfinder" for his successful
explorations blazing overland trails to the West.</TE>
<TE>   Fremont had brought along daguerreotype equipment on several of
his expeditions, even his first in 1842, but he never managed to
produce legible images. For his fifth and final journey in 1853, he
hired a professional. The stakes were high and his ambition bold.
Photographs were to have measurable impact on government decisions in
the decades to come--persuading Congress to establish Yellowstone as
the first national park, for instance. Fremont recognized early their
potential in lobbying for a cause.</TE>
<TE>   The transcontinental railroad was, at this time, still a twinkle
in the eyes of the nation's legislators. Political feuding had
erupted over which states it should pass through. Fremont, echoing
the platform of his father-in-law, former Missouri Sen. Thomas Hart
Benton, advocated a central route, keeping roughly to the 38th
parallel and bypassing the Southern, slaveholding states. Fremont had
tried to prove the route passable once before in 1848, but the
expedition failed, sacrificing 10 men to freezing and starvation. In
1853, Congress agreed to sponsor several expeditions to determine the
most viable route, but Fremont missed out on a commission. With
characteristic bravado, he financed his own survey and set out to
demonstrate the viability of the central route in winter, under the
most challenging conditions.</TE>
<TE>   As expeditions go, this one failed almost as badly as the one
before. Crossing the Wasatch Mountains in the deep snow and bitter
cold, the company was forced to abandon all extraneous baggage and
kill its horses for food. The group gave up on the journey in the
Little Salt Lake Valley of Utah, finding refuge among a small
settlement of Mormons. The men arrived there barefoot and desperate,
and yet in possession of the 25 pounds of daguerreotypes that
Carvalho had made along the way.</TE>
<TE>   The images were brought to New York, copied (by Matthew Brady's
famous studio) using the wet plate method, and the prints were given
to artists to make engravings. The reproductions were intended to
illustrate Fremont's report on the expedition, but the report was
never written. The daguerreotypes and their copies went into storage
in a New York warehouse. In 1881, a fire destroyed all of the images
but one, burning a hole right through photographic history.</TE>
<TE>   Shlaer's project patches that hole, not only through extensive
scholarship, but also through the creation of a new set of
daguerreotypes, made from 1994-1998, when Shlaer meticulously
retraced the expedition's route. The results, soberly installed in
the Huntington's Library Exhibition Hall, number 101 scenes and are
accompanied by numerous reproductions of surviving engravings made
from Carvalho's daguerreotypes. Shlaer's images are small (4 inches
by 5 inches), just a bit smaller than an average postcard, a perfect
scale for the hand. Their surfaces are slightly milky, and certain
areas verge from the monochrome toward tones of sand and blue smoke.</TE>
<TE>   Fremont's expedition was no pleasure trip, and Carvalho's images
no romantic travelogue. Judging by the engravings, Carvalho recorded
the beauty of the terrain, but with priority on information over
drama. Engravers subsequently took some liberties with the images,
positioning coyotes and camp scenes in the foreground for added
interest. Shlaer abides by the straightforward tone set by his
predecessor, shooting broad vistas and interesting topographic
features with an emphasis on maximum clarity and description. The
drama in the work is implicit--in the arduous nature of the trek
itself for the 19th century surveyors, and in the newness of the
landscape to Americans before the West was easily accessible.</TE>
<TE>   Like the post-Civil War photographers of the West, whose darkroom
wagons sometimes appeared within the frame, Shlaer inserts himself
into a picture or two. In one image, he stands beside his van, which
he calls his Travelling Daguerrean Saloon. Venting hoses slither off
the roof of the vehicle and into the adjacent woods, dispelling
mercury vapors used to develop the plates.</TE>
<TE>   Without Carvalho's originals for comparison, it's impossible to
track the cultural and geological changes that have imposed
themselves on the land in the last 150 years. Nearly all of Shlaer's
daguerreotypes show a still-pristine wilderness. A paved road, or
more poignantly, a span of railroad tracks, occasionally slices
through the frame, but what latter-day developments Shlaer edited out
of his field of vision can't be known. His enterprise hasn't the same
symmetry, then, as the Rephotographic Survey Project of the late
1970s, whose participants paired their own images with those made
from very nearly the same tripod holes a century earlier by Andrew
Russell, Timothy O'Sullivan, William Henry Jackson and others. Shlaer
used a detective's cunning to gather clues from journals,
reproductions and other accounts, but he still had relatively little
to go by in determining placement, angle, scope and even the subjects
of his pictures.</TE>
<TE>   Like a work of historical fiction, Shlaer's project is of the
present and the past, a fascinating blend of speculation, imagination
and documentation. Shlaer has filled a void, but in the spirit of the
best historical inquiries, he fills it, in part, with new questions.</TE>
<TE>   Experiencing the work becomes, as a result, slightly but
evocatively destabilizing. Our frame of reference remains stubbornly
out of alignment with Carvalho's and Fremont's. Shlaer's project
exposes the gap, but it also attempts to bridge it. In reconstructing
these views, Shlaer revives the sense of awe and adventure that
allied the new medium of photography to the untamed American West. He
sends us back to our wise infancy--as a nation and as consumers of
the visual.</TE>

<LD>In the music business, fall is the season of the heavy hitters. This
week is a prime example, with rock legends Elvis Presley and the
Rolling Stones duking it out for supremacy on the sales chart with
new hits collections, while powerhouse rapper Xzibit enters the fray
with "Man vs. Machine," the follow-up to his platinum-selling
"Restless" two years ago.</LD>
<LD>   In its first week in stores, the Stones' "40 Licks" two-CD
compilation appears to be outselling the Presley "30 #1 Hits" album,
now in its second week of release. Presley's album sold 500,000
copies its first week out, according to Nielsen SoundScan figures,
entering the sales chart at No. 1.</LD>
<LD>   Late last week, Xzibit led the Stones at the Wherehouse chain, but
the veteran rock bad boys were ahead at Tower Records, setting up a
horse race as to which will land at No. 1 when Nielsen numbers for
the week ending Sunday are released on Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   All this star power makes it a lousy time to be a rising band
looking for attention, right?</TE>
<TE>   Not for scrappy Maryland pop-punk band Good Charlotte. The quartet
is sneaking up on the heavyweights with its sophomore album, "The
Young and the Hopeless."</TE>
<TE>   "It's selling more than Xzibit for us, and twice as much as the
Elvis record across the entire chain," says Tower Records' Southwest
region director, Bob Feterl. "It's selling a lot stronger on the East
Coast, but if someone had told me it would be outselling Xzibit and
Elvis, I wouldn't have believed it. They've got to be pretty happy."</TE>
<TE>   The group's debut album moved just 7,000 copies in its first week
two years ago but has since sold more than 300,000, the result of the
band's constant touring and increasing visibility on packages such as
this year's Vans Warped Tour.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they built their fan base the right way," says Wherehouse
senior rock buyer Bob Bell. "Their first record has been selling
steadily for a very long time, and now all those fans have been
waiting for this one."</TE>
<TE>   It's the second time this year a young punk band has come out of
nowhere to land in the upper reaches of the sales chart. In June,
Florida punk group New Found Glory's "Sticks and Stones" entered at
No. 4, with first-week sales of 91,200.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of these pop-punk records take people by surprise," Bell
says. "They're not necessarily on the industry's radar screen. For
this record to be outselling the Stones and 'American Idol' and a lot
of other high-profile new releases, it's pretty impressive."</TE>

<HD>'Aga-Boom' Speaks the Language of Clowns</HD>
<DH>The all-Russian program showcases the talents of circus
veterans to create a performance that's raucous and silly.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The stereotyped image of Russia is so gloomy--the winters, the
wars--that the last thing one expects from an all-Russian theatrical
program is infectiously silly fun. But that's what the clown show
"Aga-Boom" provided at the Ivar Theatre in Hollywood over the
weekend.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, the grand finale of "Aga-Boom" came closer to being
literally riotous--as in so funny that the audience did more than
just laugh--than any theatrical experience within memory. But more
about that in a moment.</LD>
<LD>   The creator and director of "Aga-Boom" is Dmitri Bogatirev, a
former Cirque du Soleil clown. His colleagues are Cirque alumna Irina
Ivanitska, Ringling Bros. and Great Moscow Circus veteran Alexander
Chervotkin, plus dancer and contortionist Elena Chervotkina.</LD>
<TE>   The primary theme of the evening was the Sisyphean struggle to
clean up our rooms--and by extension, our world. The evening began
with Ivanitska, in a white fright wig, stark makeup and yellowish but
motley cloak, sweeping the floor, generating more and more dust as
she moved.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with a prominently displayed red gadget on the wall that
said "Do Not Touch," she struggled with the temptation and finally
succumbed, at first without serious consequences. But eventually her
encounter with the gadget brought on chaos and the arrival of her
compatriots.</TE>
<TE>   First Chervotkin appeared, in a giant suit that appeared ready for
outer space or earthly hazmat duty, his features made up in an
exaggerated Buster Keaton-like pallor that suggested perpetual
ambivalence.</TE>
<TE>   Then Bogatirev arrived, dressed more formally in classic baggy
pants, red nose and serious 5 o'clock shadow, with hair leaping
vigorously off his pate in three directions, including straight up.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the ensuing routines used cleaning materials--toilet
paper, a mop and its detachable parts, and plastic garbage bags. Most
of these materials ended up as trash themselves. If you paused to
think, you might have found an environmental statement in there
somewhere.</TE>
<TE>   But "Aga-Boom" was devoid of an explicit message--or even speech
of any kind. As in Cirque tradition, however, the sounds of the
evening were wild, a recorded score that helped shift the scenes and
moods, credited only to sound designer Yuri Fedorko.</TE>
<TE>   Physical dexterity and grace emerged, despite the apparent
unwieldiness of the costumes. Chervotkin demonstrated his seatless
unicycle, and Bogatirev was able to spin a valise and toy airplanes
into patterns.</TE>
<TE>   The pacing began to slow during a paper folding and tearing
routine that went on too long. But Chervotkina varied the rhythms
with an act in which she manipulated a white, neutral mask so that it
appeared to grow out of her lithe, black-clad frame from a range of
unusual angles.</TE>
<TE>   Only one audience volunteer was drafted for duty on stage--to take
care of a "baby" created from a mop. But virtually the entire
audience became swept up in the aforementioned grand finale, in which
a succession of ever-bigger inflated garbage bags were hurled into
the auditorium. Everyone took vast delight in batting them around the
theater, to the accompaniment of maniacal music.</TE>
<TE>   The kids in the audience were on cloud nine, but hardly more so
than the adults. Parental alert: There is talk that "Aga-Boom" may
return to town for the holidays.</TE>

<HD>Royalty for Power Rock's Masses</HD>
<DH>With weighty riffs and real hooks, Queens of the Stone Age
provide proof that hard rock continues to thrive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE APPLEFORD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rock is not back. It never left, even if new bands somehow
disappeared from the charts and magazine covers in favor of teen pop
and other diversions. Most of the acts now being celebrated as
rescuing rock from oblivion have in fact been releasing exciting,
worthwhile material since the late '90s. Right when rock supposedly
died.</LD>
<LD>   Count among those bands Queens of the Stone Age, though to
categorize them as "garage rock" would be to grossly underestimate
their raw power. At the Palladium on Friday, the band made hard rock
that was smart and heavy, exploring themes of dread, paranoid
delusions, sex and drugs, set across minimalist patterns and played
with an intensity that frayed into dementia.</LD>
<LD>   That's a heavy load, but never humorless. The sound was often dark
and heavy, with riffs like bricks, and yet it also swung with real
hooks, opening with the thrashy "You Think I Ain't Worth a Dollar,
but I Feel Like a Millionaire," taken from the band's just-released
third album, "Songs for the Deaf."</LD>
<TE>   It's a sound designed to be heard in the openness of the
California desert, which is where the core members of Queens of the
Stone Age first emerged. Singer-guitarist Josh Homme and
singer-bassist Nick Oliveri began making music during the late '80s
in a psychedelic metal act called Kyuss--critically acclaimed and
mostly ignored by the masses--playing rock that was ultra-heavy but
never stringent.</TE>
<TE>   Queens is a more sophisticated version of that old Kyuss
blueprint. At the Palladium, the mostly instrumental "Song for the
Dead" showed the band at its most aggressive, all big beats and
hyperactive guitar, while "The Sky Is Fallin' " featured epic,
slashing chords with a swirling Eastern flavor, as Homme crooned
peacefully above the noise.</TE>
<TE>   The stage lights were turned low for the unannounced entrance of
Mark Lanegan, former singer of the Screaming Trees, and now a
permanent part of the rotating Queens confab. He gripped the
microphone stand like a javelin during "Hangin' Tree," leading the
band through some darker, meditative passages.</TE>
<TE>   Lanegan also ripped through the raunchy, elastic rock of "In the
Fade," with the band sounding a lot closer to T. Rex than Black
Sabbath. Homme soon asked fans to hold up their lighters during "No
One Knows," a nod to the band's first radio hit, and they did--at
least those who managed to slip a lighter past the Palladium's
security.</TE>
<TE>   ... And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead offered a fitting
opening for the headliners with a tight rock set that could have come
right out of CBGB's, the bare-bones punk rock club in New York.</TE>
<TE>   The Austin, Texas, quartet was often just as direct as the Hives,
but then shifted into something more challenging, edging toward the
experimental territory of Sonic Youth.</TE>
<TE>   Drawing largely on material from its self-titled major label
debut, the band's set was raw and unpredictable. And at one point,
singer Conrad Keely ended a song by complaining about his guitar. He
then handed it to a fan pressed against the barricade, sneering, "He
can keep it."</TE>

<HD>In the Beginning ... a Haunting Spectacle</HD>
<DH>In 'Genesi,' Romeo Castellucci gives an eerie, dark
rendering of the biblical story.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first book of the Bible has been a kind of wonder machine for
Italian artists for centuries. Michelangelo paints the finger of God
and it seems no longer just symbol. Lift your head up in the Sistine
Chapel and you feel the electricity surge. In the beginning was the
word, and in contemporary Italy, composer Luciano Berio and poet
Edoardo Sanguineti have been led by Genesis to produce a work,
"A-Ronne," in which the birth of language becomes physical sensation.</LD>
<LD>   There is almost no language in Romeo Castellucci's "Genesi--from
the museum of sleep," an extraordinary theatrical work given its
American premiere by his company, Societas  Raffaello Sanzio, at the
Freud Playhouse on Friday night, as part of the UCLA International
Theatre Festival. For this Italian director, little known in America,
Genesis is a circusy chamber of horrors.</LD>
<LD>   But despite its many pretensions, this creation epic is full of
its own kind of wonder, dark and peculiar as that may be. "I can't
get my head around the concept of Genesis," Castellucci writes in his
provocative program note, "without thinking of creation as a crisis."</LD>
<TE>   Castellucci has plenty to say--and to show--beginning with the
idea that everything in Genesis "is genetic and genital." He is an
intellectual who cannot stop himself from referencing. He is a
sideshow huckster who thrives on shock. And he is a genius of theater
who transcends all his pretensions to produce a primal spectacle
utterly strange yet eerily familiar. "Genesi" contains three long
acts, each its own kind of haunting, grim, yet ineffably beautiful
nightmare.</TE>
<TE>   First a few words about Castellucci and his company, which he
formed in 1981 with his choreographer wife, Claudia, and Chiara Giudi
(who is credited here with "vocal score and dramatic rhythm") in
Cesina, Italy. The troupe includes a contortionist and the six
Castellucci children.</TE>
<TE>   For the elaborate "Genesi" production, there are credits for
machine technique, statics and dynamics, taxidermy, plastic art,
scene collaboration, production collaboration. Castellucci's credits
are for "scenes, direction and other sounds." The main sounds,
presumably, are those of the gripping electronic soundtrack by Scott
Gibbons</TE>
<TE>   Though a mainstay at the more adventurous European festivals and
theater venues, Societas  Raffaello Sanzio, a not easily translatable
name that implies a society sanctioned by the painter Raphael, has
only been seen once in the United States, when it performed its
violently bizarre version of Shakespeare's "Julius Caesar" in
Connecticut three years ago, a production that UCLA will present in
early November.</TE>
<TE>   The first act of "Genesi" is the most surreal. It opens in Madame
Curie's lab, where radium glows. Lucifer, an anorexic, takes off his
clothes and struggles painfully through the narrow gap between two
poles. The anguish, of which there is much in this museum of sleep,
has begun. The stage illuminates with images that vanish just as you
take them in. Adam is the contortionist. The naked Eve is an old
woman with a mastectomy. For a few seconds at the back of the stage,
there are two mechanized stuffed sheep seen copulating in a glass
case. Odd machines come out of nowhere. At the top of the stage a
frame gushes with soapy water.</TE>
<TE>   At intermission, everyone seemed to have noticed a different
reference. A colleague comes up plausibly with Max Ernst's surrealist
drawings. A friend suggests Tod Browning, the director of "Freaks."
Joseph Cornell's boxes are mentioned. I think I'm clever noticing the
similarity to the grotesque animators, the Brothers Quay, until I see
a program note of thanks to them from Castellucci.</TE>
<TE>   The second act is a softer dream but no less disturbing. The
children wander in dreamy, gauzy haze. One small boy dressed in
old-fashioned white top hat and tails rides in on a slow, white
miniature train. The children shower. There is sweetness and there is
horror. They are children in Auschwitz.</TE>
<TE>   In the final act, the idea that creation and destruction are flip
sides of the same coin is most dramatically spelled out through Cain,
with withered arm, and Abel. Their conflict is slow and balletic.
Throughout the act, two dogs scavenge for food. The set is an
interesting Expressionist abstraction, stunningly lit.</TE>
<TE>   "I will confess that Schechina (the last Sephiroth) and Max
Klinger are the key words," Castellucci says in his none-too-helpful
notes to the first act. But that only underscores the fact that
witnessing "Genesi" transcends the need for explanation. You slowly
come to terms with its remarkable images in your own way. You find,
within yourself, references, meanings, the scary places of your
psyche.</TE>
<TE>   At curtain call, in a final bit of ingeniousness, Castellucci
wakes you up. The troupe appears as a happy circus family. The
children, and the youngest looks no more than 4 or 5, play clapping
games. The contortionist takes pretzel bows. Anorexic Lucifer looms.
The players, all extraordinary, are Michele Altana Maria Luisa
Cantarelli, Matar Fall, Renzo Mion, Aras Hamzayev and Franco Pistoni.</TE>
<TE>   Castellucci's version of "Julius Caesar," in which Mark Anthony,
having had a laryngotomy, can't speak his lines, comes to the Freud
Playhouse for three performance Nov. 1-3.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>All signs point to a crossroads season this year for the WB's
undisputed ratings champ, "7th Heaven," airing tonight at 8.</LD>
<LD>   The drama has followed the home-and-hearth high jinks of Eric and
Annie Camden and their seven offspring for seven seasons now, and one
can almost sense the pressure on the series to keep things
interesting for its loyal legion of fans.</LD>
<LD>   Last month's season premiere ranked 45th nationally in the
Nielsens, and while that might be cause for concern at big networks
CBS or NBC, the numbers (a 5.5 rating, or more than 9 million
viewers) represented a high-water mark for a series that has led all
WB shows during the last four years.</LD>
<TE>   "7th Heaven" also began running repeats last month on ABC Family.
This amiable show of homespun values has turned into quite a
franchise.</TE>
<TE>   But tonight's episode, "Bowling for Eric," threatens to shake up
things in a big way when family patriarch Eric (Stephen Collins)
learns that he must have double-bypass heart surgery. Stunned and
even fearful, he reluctantly schedules a family meeting to drop the
bombshell, only to change his mind at the last minute, explaining
that he brought everyone together for a mandatory bowling outing.</TE>
<TE>   Eric does manage to tell his brother (guest star Ed Begley Jr.)
about the impending surgery, adding that the bowling excursion would
allow the family to have one more night of normality before
"everything changes."</TE>
<TE>   But the trip to the lanes and Eric's evasiveness on questions
about his sudden odd behavior largely come across as annoying
contrivances, and it isn't until the final quarter-hour that the
episode regains its footing with some deeply affecting scenes.</TE>
<TE>   Eric's crisis plays out in unusual ways during the next few weeks,
but the one thing the series can't afford to lose is its heart.</TE>

<HD>Organic, and They Mean It</HD>
<DH>Food* Products that meet strict federal criteria will
qualify for a special USDA label. Until now, regulations have varied
from state to state.</DH>

<LD>Shoppers who want to buy organic foods can be bewildered by the
labels' often fuzzy claims, and may even suspect that the edibles
they're paying a premium for aren't truly pesticide- or hormone-free.
After all, terms such as "organically produced," "pesticide free,"
"100% natural," or even "certified organic" aren't guarantees of
purity.</LD>
<LD>   But new government-approved labels, which will debut in two weeks,
should eliminate some of that guesswork. Under the guidelines, foods
must meet strict U.S. Department of Agriculture production criteria
to be identified as "organic," and only products that contain 95% or
more organic food can carry the USDA organic logo.</LD>
<LD>   Previously, private certifying agencies and a patchwork of
regulations, which varied by state, determined which products could
claim to be organic. Some standards were more lax than others.
Consequently, consumers had no assurances what labels meant.</LD>
<TE>   "Anyone could slap on the word 'organic' and hike up the price,"
said Barbara C. Robinson, the USDA official in Washington, D.C., who
is overseeing this program. "Now standards are uniform nationwide,
and consumers know what they're getting. It helps the organic food
industry too, because now they know exactly what to do."</TE>
<TE>   After 10 years of intense debate among organic growers and
retailers, conventional farmers, consumers, environmentalists and
animal rights activists, the USDA has created four organic
categories: 100% organic, organic, made with organic ingredients and,
for those products with less than 70% organic ingredients, a simple
listing of the organic items in the ingredient panel.</TE>
<TE>   But the USDA's definition of "organic" goes beyond defining
whether or not the food has been sprayed with chemicals. The organic
label can't be used on products made with genetically modified
ingredients, synthetic chemical fertilizers or pesticides, or sewage
sludge, which is sterilized waste that can contain heavy metals like
lead and mercury. Nor can it be used on products that have been
irradiated, a process in which radiation is used to kill germs.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers still must wrestle with some confusion in the health
food aisle. Terms such as "free-range," "hormone-free" and "natural"
may still appear on foods, but they haven't been certified by the
government.</TE>
<TE>   For a product to carry the 100% organic label, an organic grower
must prove to an independent certifying agent that the farm has been
chemical-free for at least three years.</TE>
<TE>   Chickens, for instance, can't be given growth hormones or
antibiotics, and must be fed only organic feed. Every step in the
production process, such as that by manufacturers and handlers, must
also be certified as organic.</TE>
<TE>   Although the rules take effect Oct. 21, consumers may still find
some products with the old labeling system on the shelves. To
determine whether the package adheres to the new regulations, look
for the USDA logo (which will appear for the "100% organic" and
"organic" categories) or for the stamp of the inspector that
certified the product as organic.</TE>
<TE>   "These regulations level the playing field," says Barbara Haumann
of the Organic Trade Assn. in Greenfield, Mass., which represents
organic growers, manufacturers and retailers. Now everyone has to
abide by the same rules, she says.</TE>
<TE>   Violators making false claims will be fined $10,000 per offense.
The USDA will depend on a network of independent inspectors, state
agricultural agents, and on self-policing within the organic foods
industry to catch offenders. "It's not easy to get an organic
designation," says the USDA's Robinson. "Because this is competitive,
you're going to call if you think someone else is cheating. The folks
who are doing this legitimately are our eyes and ears."</TE>
<TE>   Still, some experts worry that the new organic labels will create
even more confusion among consumers, who may erroneously assume the
government seal means the products are better in quality or more
nutritious. "All the labels mean is that the food is grown or
processed in a different way, not that it's safer or healthier," says
Regina Hildwine, senior director of food labeling and standards with
the National Food Processors Assn., an industry trade group in
Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, heirloom tomatoes sun-ripened at local farms tend to be
more flavorful than those picked early and shipped across the
country. And the notion of eating veggies that haven't been sprayed
with pesticides that contaminate the ground water, or drinking milk
from cows who haven't dined on hormones or antibiotics, may be
appealing, says Molly Anderson, an ecologist and director of the
Tufts Institute of the Environment in Medford, Mass. But scientific
evidence that they're better for you "is inconclusive," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Although conventionally produced fruits and vegetables, for
instance, may have more pesticide residues on their skin than
organically grown produce, the levels on all produce fall within
legally safe amounts, Anderson said.</TE>
<TE>   "Organic is better for consumers if you look at the big picture,
because it's better for the environment," says Anderson. "You may pay
a little more at the supermarket, but look at it as a down payment on
the quality of life that your kids will enjoy."</TE>

<LD>To nicotine patches, gum and inhalers, add another convenient tool
for smokers trying to quit--the telephone.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, investigators at UC San Diego reported that phone
counseling services known as "quitlines" nearly double the likelihood
that a smoker trying to quit will succeed. California and 32 other
states operate the toll-free services, in which addiction counselors
work with smokers to develop strategies for avoiding cigarettes. The
report, which appeared in the Oct. 3 New England Journal of Medicine,
is the first test to determine whether the quitlines are having any
effect.</LD>
<LD>   "This is very good news for smokers," said Shu-Hong Zhu, an
assistant professor of preventive medicine at UC San Diego, which
operates the service for the state of California. The study, he said,
demonstrates that phone counseling is as good as the nicotine patch
in helping people quit.</LD>
<TE>   Addiction counselors consider smoking the hardest habit to break
this side of heroin.</TE>
<TE>   In one study, heavy drug users undergoing treatment rated tobacco
as their "most needed" drug, ahead of alcohol and methadone, among
others. Even long-term programs have trouble maintaining success
rates much higher than 10% among heavy users.</TE>
<TE>   The UC San Diego quitline program got roughly the same result: 1
in 10 callers smoke-free after a year. Among smokers who called the
service once but never followed up, only 1 in 20 were smoke-free
after a year.</TE>
<TE>   Quitlines are much more likely to reach low-income smokers than
walk-in clinics are, Zhu said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the quitline service is vastly underused. In California,
which has an estimated 4 million smokers, the statewide line received
only 55,000 calls last year. Zhu expects that to change as the word
gets out. (For English service, call [800] 662-8887; for Spanish,
[800] 456-6386.) The service typically involves a 40-minute planning
session with a counselor and two or three follow-up calls. And you
can't beat the price.</TE>

<HD>The Evidence Speaks Well of Bilingualism's Effect on Kids</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUDY FOREMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kids who grow up in bilingual homes may be slower to speak than other
kids, but once they've learned both languages they appear to have a
number of intellectual advantages.</LD>
<LD>   People who speak two languages early in life quickly learn that
names of objects are arbitrary, said Suzanne Flynn, a professor of
linguistics and second-language acquisition at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology. "So they deal with a level of abstraction
very early."</LD>
<LD>   Also, bilingual kids become exceptionally good at learning to
ignore "misleading information," said Ellen Bialystok, professor of
psychology at York University in Toronto.</LD>
<TE>   Bialystok tests bilingual and monolingual 4-year-olds with what
she calls the "tower game," which involves building towers with
either Lego or Duplo blocks. Duplo blocks are similar to the familiar
Lego ones, but they're roughly twice as big. Every block, regardless
of its size, holds one "family," Bialystok tells kids. The child's
task then becomes to look at a tower and say how many families it can
hold. The trick is that a tower made of seven Lego blocks is the same
height as a tower made of four Duplos. To answer correctly the
question of which tower holds more families (the Lego tower), the
child has to ignore this obvious visual fact.</TE>
<TE>   "By age 5, monolingual children can do this," said Bialystok, but
bilingual kids can do it at 4. "This is the advantage of
bilingualism"--in other words, a child can focus attention and ignore
distractions.</TE>
<TE>   Bilingual kids also learn another useful skill--how to switch back
and forth between tasks when the rules (such as the rules of a
language) change, said Adele Diamond, director of the Center for
Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience at the University of
Massachusetts Medical School in Waltham.</TE>
<TE>   Learning to adapt to a new set of rules means learning how to
inhibit--or not pay attention to--a previously learned set, a skill
that depends on development of a particular part of the brain, the
prefrontal cortex, which functions in concert with other areas.</TE>
<TE>   In bilingualism, said Diamond, "you are constantly having to
exercise inhibition because otherwise one language would intrude. We
think this puts such a heavy demand on the system that it pushes the
brain to mature earlier."</TE>
<TE>   This ability to filter out distractions and switch back and forth
between tasks may give bilingual kids a leg up in school, she said.</TE>
<TE>   In many studies, researchers use the Stroop test. The child is
presented with a list of colors, but each color's name is written in
ink of a different color. For instance, the word "red" would be
written in green ink. Sometimes, the rule is that the child must say
the name of the color and sometimes the child must say the color of
the ink instead. For kids who can't yet read, Diamond uses pictures
of circles on a computer screen.</TE>
<TE>   Diamond then uses functional MRI scans to see which areas of the
child's brain are needed when the rules keep switching. Constant rule
switching, she said, causes the brain to recruit extra neural
circuits, whereas tasks that don't involve rule switching do not.</TE>
<TE>   Large Area of Brain Used</TE>
<TE>   Even in monolingual people, language processing is so central to
being human that the brain devotes a huge amount of "real estate" to
it, said Patricia K. Kuhl, director of the Center for Mind, Brain and
Learning at the University of Washington.</TE>
<TE>   For 99% of right-handed people, the brain processes language
mostly in the left hemisphere. In left-handers, it's often, though
not always, reversed.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, speech production is governed by Broca's area, a
small region in the left inferior frontal cortex of the
brain--beneath the temple. Language comprehension, on the other hand,
occurs in Wernicke's area, which lies farther back. (Sign language,
by the way, uses the same areas, as well as visual processing areas.
If a person who communicates by sign language has a stroke in Broca's
area, he may become aphasic--unable to speak--just like a person who
uses oral speech.)</TE>
<TE>   Getting the brain up to speed for language processing takes years.
A recent imaging study by Steven Petersen, a cognitive neuroscientist
at Washington University in St. Louis, showed that even in kids ages
7 to 10, the brain was working harder at language tasks than brains
of adults. That's because "kids are still learning," he said. And
kids who learn two languages, not surprisingly, have an even tougher
challenge.</TE>
<TE>   When babies are born, they are "citizens of the world," said Kuhl,
who studies language development in babies in the U.S., Sweden, Japan
and Russia. Newborns don't classify sounds; they simply hear and
respond (by turning their heads) to all sounds. But over the first
six months, as they become "bathed" in their native language, a
baby's brain does a kind of statistical analysis that said, in
essence, "This sound is important. I'd better file it away for future
use." Or, "This other sound is not important. I can forget it."</TE>
<TE>   Using computer-generated vowel sounds and sophisticated
statistical analyses of babies' responses, Kuhl has shown that by 6
months of age, Swedish babies and American babies "have totally
different perceptions of the exact same sound" from the computer.
Other researchers, including those from the University of British
Columbia, have shown similar results.</TE>
<TE>   These distinctions become ingrained for life. While Japanese
babies learn that there's no meaningful difference between the sound
for "L" and the sound for "R," American babies learn there is. The
result, for Japanese adults, is that it is very difficult to
distinguish between "L" and "R" because the two sounds, said Kuhl,
are in the same storage "bin."</TE>
<TE>   But mapping exactly where language "bins" reside is a tricky, and
fascinating, business. Neuroscientist Joy Hirsch of Columbia
University uses functional MRI scanning to study bilingual adults,
half of whom became bilingual as toddlers and half of whom learned a
second language as an adult. The question was simple: "When one
learns a second language, is that represented in the same area of the
brain as the native language?"</TE>
<TE>   Hirsch's subjects, who spoke a variety of languages--English,
Chinese, German, French, etc.--were shown a picture and were asked to
describe it first in one language, then in the second language. In
adults who had learned a second language early, as toddlers,
electrical activity in Broca's area looked virtually identical,
regardless of which language was being used. But when people had
acquired a second language later, the scans showed two separate parts
of Broca's area lighting up.</TE>
<TE>   This suggests that when the learning is early, "the brain treats
multiple languages as one language. But when one learns later in
life, the sorting out seems to be done more spatially," says Hirsch,
whose research has been used by both sides in the bilingual education
debate.</TE>
<TE>   At the Montreal Neurological Institute, Denise Klein also finds
brain differences depending on when people learn a second language.
Using PET scans, she has found that people who are fully bilingual in
French and English use the same area of the brain as an "internal
dictionary," regardless of which language they're speaking. By
contrast, people who are not truly bilingual, that is, who learn a
second language after childhood, need to recruit additional brain
areas to find words in their nonnative language, suggesting the brain
has to work harder to do this.</TE>
<TE>   Neurosurgeons, too, have documented that multiple languages can be
stored in discrete parts of the brain. Dr. George Ojemann, a
professor of neurology at the University of Washington School of
Medicine in Seattle, operates on people who suffer severe epileptic
seizures, some of whom are bilingual, and maps the precise location
of each language.</TE>
<TE>   With the patient awake and able to speak, Ojemann shows a picture
of, say, a banana, and asks the patient to name it. By using very
precise electrical stimulation of specific regions in the brain,
Ojemann can get the patient to talk, say, in French but not English,
then stimulate a nearby area and get the opposite result.</TE>
<TE>   Separate Circuits</TE>
<TE>   Though there is some overlap, this suggests that there are
"somewhat separate neuronal circuits for different languages," said
Ojemann, who has recently been able to map different languages to
single neurons.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have two languages, all lines of evidence show there is
separate real estate for different languages" in the brain, agrees
Patricia Kuhl of the University of Washington.</TE>
<TE>   So what, if anything, does all this imply for bilingual education?
"We are nowhere near knowing what it implies," she said, though
researchers are trying to find out. Even though the answers are not
all in, she added, there seems to be a "great advantage" to being
multilingual.</TE>

<HD>Giving Birth Their Way</HD>
<DH>Pregnant women who've had a previous C-section have a tough
time persuading doctors to let them deliver vaginally</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARI ROAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Women who have had a caesarean section often want to deliver their
next child vaginally--and many are physically capable of doing so.
But across the nation, they're increasingly denied that option.</LD>
<LD>   Vaginal birth after caesarean--known as VBAC--a childbirth
practice heralded only a few years ago as a way to spare women from
another surgery, has fallen so far out of favor that women now say
they have to fight for it.</LD>
<LD>   This year, hospitals in upstate New York; central Ohio; Spokane,
Wash.; Des Moines; Aspen, Colo.; and elsewhere have announced that
they will no longer offer the VBAC option.</LD>
<TE>   Only 16.5% of U.S. women with prior caesarean sections had a
vaginal birth last year, according to the National Center for Health
Statistics, a 20% drop from the previous year. California's rate, at
14.5%, is among the lowest in the nation, and some local hospitals
report current rates of less than 5%. In Southern California, where
few hospitals forbid vaginal births after a caesarean, many women
nevertheless say their obstetricians actively discourage the option.</TE>
<TE>   Ginger Clinton, a 24-year-old Simi Valley woman, sought a vaginal
birth earlier this year because of a difficult recovery after the
caesarean birth of her first child. Although doctors said she was a
good candidate for a vaginal delivery, she had to change physicians
twice before finding one who supported her request.</TE>
<TE>   "I was at the end of my second trimester when I went to the third
doctor, and then my insurance company almost didn't let me switch
doctors," said Clinton, who had a successful vaginal delivery in
July. "It was worth the battle, but, golly, it was a lot of work."</TE>
<TE>   Women's health experts agree that VBAC can be a reasonably
safe--even preferable--option. The American Academy of Obstetricians
and Gynecologists concluded in a 2000 report that the benefits of a
vaginal birth after a caesarean outweigh the risks for many women.
And the federal government has set a goal of 37% VBAC deliveries as
part of its Healthy People 2010 objectives, up from the 28% rate
reported in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   But safety, cost, convenience and malpractice concerns have sent
the rates plunging, not increasing.</TE>
<TE>   The decline started in 1999 when the American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommended that a doctor and an
anesthesiologist be "immediately available" when a VBAC patient is in
labor. Before 1999, a doctor and surgical team were advised to be
"readily available," widely interpreted to mean that they be within
30 minutes of the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   The policy change addressed a complication of VBAC, called uterine
rupture, in which the caesarean scar from a previous birth ruptures.
Such an event occurs in an estimated 1% of VBAC patients, and both
the mother and baby can die or be seriously harmed.</TE>
<TE>   Although the revision was designed simply to ensure women's
safety, it began to drive the procedure from everyday practice.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been absolutely no change in the underlying scientific
background on VBAC," says Dr. John Aiken, an obstetrician at
Northridge Hospital Medical Center. "But because of this ...
requirement, the physician has to be on site. A lot of physicians
don't come in to the hospital until their patient is fully dilated
[ready to give birth]. So they can't meet the criteria."</TE>
<TE>   Both hospital administrators and doctors say it's too costly and
inconvenient for a doctor to sit with a patient in labor (which may
last many hours).</TE>
<TE>   "There really isn't any incentive for the physician to do VBACs,"
said Dr. Roger K. Freeman, an obstetrician at Long Beach Memorial
Medical Center and chairman of the obstetricians task force on VBAC.
"It's more time-consuming, more worry. And they don't get paid any
more for it."</TE>
<TE>   Clinton's doctors were blunt in denying her VBAC attempt. "One
doctor said he wouldn't be willing to wait during my labor. The other
doctor said even if he was [available], the chance of having the rest
of the team there isn't very good," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Some women, patient advocates and doctors are upset that
nonmedical issues may lead to unnecessary surgery that has attendant
risks of its own. One patient advocacy group, International Cesarean
Awareness Network, plans to petition the obstetricians group, the
American Hospital Assn. and insurance groups, protesting the
increasing loss of VBAC as an option.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all about money," says ICAN's president, Anita Woods of
Kansas City, Mo. "It has nothing to do with safety. We are being
railroaded by money concerns."</TE>
<TE>   Decisions to forbid VBACs have divided doctors and health
executives in many cities. Ridgecrest Regional Hospital, a Mojave
Desert hospital about 150 miles from Los Angeles, for example, voted
earlier this year to drop VBACs because it could not supply
round-the-clock doctor and anesthesiology services, says Tina Wallum,
administrator of patient care services.</TE>
<TE>   "This caused a lot of discussion among our medical staff," Wallum
says. But, she adds: "It's not that we're opposed to VBAC, but we
believe it should be attempted in a setting that can provide that."</TE>
<TE>   The new policy means that women who want the option will need to
travel 90 miles to a hospital in Lancaster, Wallum says.</TE>
<TE>   Weighing the Risks</TE>
<TE>   The risk of infant death due to a uterine rupture during a VBAC is
about 1 in 1,000, twice the rate among other laboring women,
according to studies. Uterine ruptures can cause permanent injuries
in babies and lead to hysterectomies.</TE>
<TE>   But women who have successful VBACs avoid the much longer recovery
time and risks associated with C-sections. For the mother, those
risks include infection, hemorrhage, blood clots, injuries to other
organs and exposure to major anesthesia. The risks to the baby from
C-sections are higher rates of respiratory disorders, fetal trauma
and fetal death.</TE>
<TE>   Few medical experts disagree with the idea that doctors should be
on hand during a VBAC patient's labor, but some say women are being
misled into thinking that such labor is extraordinarily risky.</TE>
<TE>   "The patient is not being told, 'I don't want to sit with you in
the hospital,' " says Ellie Shea, a longtime birth educator in the
South Bay. "She hears, 'This is a matter of safety for you; you
should really have a caesarean.' It's hard for women to sort out
whether they should pursue a VBAC and whether they are endangering
their babies if they do so." Shea is also a doula, a person trained
to provide emotional support and comfort during labor.</TE>
<TE>   Juliet Babros, a Redondo Beach public relations executive, was
resolute about wanting to try a VBAC for her second child. She
delivered the baby vaginally, without incident, last week. "I had a
slow recovery with the caesarean," she says. "I didn't feel like I
could respond to my baby as quickly. Now I have a 2-year-old, and I
want to bounce back quicker. I want to get home quicker."</TE>
<TE>   She explained her reasoning to her obstetrician, who was so
unenthusiastic that Babros decided to find a new doctor. Her second
doctor supported her wishes but warned that she would be subjected to
numerous restrictions during labor, and that another caesarean was
still a possibility.</TE>
<TE>   Statistics show that VBACs are successful in 80% of women who are
considered good candidates for the procedure.</TE>
<TE>   "They treat you as this high-risk person," Babros says. "When you
talk to doctors about it, you get so fearful because they are
fearful. They tell you the worst-case scenarios and maybe none of the
benefits."</TE>
<TE>   Cedars-Sinai Medical Center offers a class to help pregnant women
reach a decision, says Dr. Kimberly Gregory, director of
maternal-fetal medicine. "The class is an opportunity to get a
perspective about the risks and benefits in a more objective way,"
Gregory says. "VBAC is fairly safe if you're willing to accept that
1% [uterine rupture] complication rate."</TE>
<TE>   To keep the risk low, the American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists recommends that women try VBAC only if they've had only
one caesarean via a type of incision called a low transverse (a
horizontal incision on the lower part of the uterus). The low
transverse scar is much less likely to rupture than other types of
caesarean scars during a VBAC attempt, studies show. Candidates
should be healthy women, carrying babies in a head-down position, who
are in their 37th to 40th week of pregnancy.</TE>
<TE>   Coming Full Circle</TE>
<TE>   Only a few years ago, health insurers and hospitals were so
enamored of VBACs as a cost-cutting measure (vaginal births are less
expensive than surgical births) that almost every former caesarean
patient was urged to try it. That practice led to a dramatic increase
in uterine ruptures and scores of lawsuits from families nationwide
who suffered injuries or deaths.</TE>
<TE>   Jacqueline Gang, a San Pedro woman who is expecting her second
child, was surprised when her obstetrician balked at her request to
try a vaginal birth.</TE>
<TE>   "He came right out and said it was for liability reasons," says
Gang, who has hired a doula to help advocate for her during her
labor. "Part of me was a little offended at his honesty.... I want my
doctor to do what is in my best interest."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the lawsuits arose from cases in which the patient was not
a good candidate for a vaginal birth, said Dr. T. Murphy Goodwin,
chief of maternal-fetal medicine at USC's Keck School of Medicine,
where dozens of VBAC-related lawsuits in the 1990s led to payouts
totalling $24 million.</TE>
<TE>   "We select our patients for VBAC much more carefully now," Goodwin
said. "There is a much greater appreciation for who is a good
candidate."</TE>
<TE>   To reduce possible complications, the American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists recently admonished doctors to avoid
using drugs that start or speed up labor in VBAC deliveries. Use of
labor-inducing drugs, called prostaglandins, have doubled in the last
decade (from 9.3% of all deliveries in 1990 to almost 20% in 2000).
But the drugs dramatically increase the risk of a uterine rupture
during VBAC, according to a study published last year in the New
England Journal of Medicine.</TE>
<TE>   A quicker physician response time, better selection of patients
and disuse of labor-inducing drugs should reduce the risk of
complications from VBAC, experts say. But not many women stand to
benefit from the changes, says Shea, the birth educator.</TE>
<TE>   "If women know to ask some questions or understand what is
happening behind the scenes, they are more likely to get a VBAC," she
says. "But it's hard for the average woman to advocate for herself."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The power of the mind is impressive--but there are limits. The mind,
for instance, cannot spontaneously cause a woman to become pregnant
and cause her to give birth to a child.</LD>
<LD>   Yet sometimes the mind gets a definite A for effort.</LD>
<LD>   Women, extremely rarely, can show up in doctors' offices looking
very, very pregnant and so utterly convinced that they're
expecting--maternity frocks and all--that in bygone eras many a
doctor was fooled.</LD>
<TE>   Who can blame them?</TE>
<TE>   These women's periods become irregular, even halt. Their bellies
distend.</TE>
<TE>   Their breasts grow tender--sometimes exude clear fluid or milk.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes they experience morning sickness, feel the fetus
move--even get as far as to be admitted to hospital with labor pains.</TE>
<TE>   The technical term for such a "phantom pregnancy" is pseudocyesis,
from the Greek words pseudes (meaning fake) and kyesis (meaning
pregnancy). The Greek physician Hippocrates described it more than
2,000 years ago, noting that some women "imagine that they are
pregnant seeing that their menses are suppressed and their matrices
swollen."</TE>
<TE>   Queen Mary Tudor of England suffered from two episodes of
pseudocyesis after her marriage to Philip of Spain in 1554. The
pressure to produce an heir was intense. She was sure she was
pregnant, but both times the day of delivery came and went with no
result.</TE>
<TE>   In 1814, Joanna Southscott, a New England religious leader,
similarly claimed she was pregnant--less convincingly, you'd think,
since she was over 60 years old and also claimed the fetus was the
Messiah. But her large abdomen and swollen breasts convinced several
doctors. When she died soon afterward, more than a dozen physicians
were present at the autopsy. It revealed no pregnancy but a distended
bowel and a lot of abdominal fat.</TE>
<TE>   Usually, episodes of pseudocyesis last nine months. But one woman
in 18th century Paris reportedly sustained the belief in her
pregnancy for an impressive 18 years.</TE>
<TE>   "I think, madam," said her physician, "that the best thing you
could do would be to swallow a private tutor for your son, or his
education will be sadly neglected."</TE>
<TE>   All in all, more than 500 reports of pseudocyesis exist in the
medical literature, in females age 5 to 79. Its causes are still a
mystery.</TE>
<TE>   You'd think some clues might come from other animals. After all,
chickens, rabbits, mice and dogs can develop false pregnancies. Dogs,
for instance, will gain weight, develop swollen mammary glands and
start nesting. Sigmund Freud's dog reportedly suffered from this.
(Wonder what Freud made of it.)</TE>
<TE>   But false pregnancies in such species have a different underlying
cause, stemming primarily from physiology. In rabbits, for instance,
pregnancy is pretty much assured with each episode of intercourse (no
wonder the creatures are so prolific). Intercourse with an infertile
male is enough to trigger hormones that make a female bunny act
pregnant.</TE>
<TE>   But in human beings, pregnancy and intercourse aren't so tightly
linked--and it is the mind that seems to set the condition rolling.</TE>
<TE>   It goes something like this: A woman may very much desire a baby.
Then maybe her periods become irregular or stop. (Stress can actually
cause this to happen, via release of the hormone cortisol.) She
believes that she is pregnant.</TE>
<TE>   Congratulated and fussed over by family and friends, the woman
starts dressing pregnant, unconsciously distending her abdomen and
carrying her body in a pregnant way.</TE>
<TE>   Accumulations of gas in the abdomen--and movements of that
gas--can mimic pregnancy and fetal movements. Weight gain, nausea and
fatigue--all can be induced by the mind, behavior changes or hormonal
fluxes.</TE>
<TE>   Other hormones can come out of kilter too, causing changes in
breast physiology.</TE>
<TE>   "This is truly, if you will, mind over matter--it's perhaps the
most graphic expression in humans of a situation where the psychology
of what's going on drives hormonal changes," says Dr. John O'Grady,
director of obstetrical services at Baystate Medical Center in
Springfield, Mass.</TE>
<TE>   These days, pseudocyesis is rare indeed, says Dr. Alan DeCherney,
professor of obstetrics and gynecology at UCLA. The pressure to have
kids is less intense. Doctors' exams are more thorough.</TE>
<TE>   And these days, of course, there are early, reliable pregnancy
tests--and ultrasound to directly view the fetus.</TE>
<TE>   "It used to be that when a patient had symptoms of pregnancy we'd
say, 'We can't really tell whether you're pregnant or not' and we'd
have to wait till she was 12 weeks along for physical signs,"
DeCherney says.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we can tell four days after her period, or even sooner.
There's no time to get wrapped up in the fantasy."</TE>

<HD>Even a Little Alcohol Can Impair Drivers' Decisions</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With 38% of all traffic deaths involving alcohol, many states have
lowered the legal limit of alcohol in the blood to 0.08%. But is that
low enough? A new study done at Texas A&amp;M University found that
drinking only one or two beers can significantly impair driving
skills, especially one's ability to make split-second decisions.</LD>
<LD>   The study compared the driving performance of 19 men and women
while they were sober and after they had drunk an alcoholic beverage
that brought their blood-alcohol level to 0.04%, half the legal limit
in some states. A 120-pound woman can reach the 0.04% level after
only one beer; for a 150-pound man, it may take two beers.</LD>
<LD>   The driving tests included recovery from a skid, steering, braking
smoothly and several other maneuvers. The non-driving exercises
involved balance, vision and reaction time tests. The test were
repeated when drivers had more to drink, reaching blood-alcohol
levels of 0.07%, then 0.10%.</LD>
<TE>   At a level of 0.04%, the drivers' ability had declined
significantly. Not surprisingly, their scores got worse as their
blood-alcohol level increased.</TE>
<TE>   The study demonstrates that a person doesn't have to appear drunk
to be a danger on the highway. "I've seen people who can pass the
standard tests of walking a straight line for nine steps and standing
on one leg [after drinking] and still not be able to drive well. They
can still mess up in a decision-making situation," says Maurice E.
Dennis, director of the Center for Alcohol and Drug Education Study
at Texas A&amp;M in College Station, Texas.</TE>

<TE>   Breast Self-Exams May Not Prevent Cancer Deaths</TE>
<TE>   Breast self-exams for women have been touted for years as a way to
detect breast cancer at an earlier stage. But a new study has found
that women who receive intensive instruction in breast self-exams are
as likely to die as women who do not.</TE>
<TE>   The study involved more than 266,000 factory workers in Shanghai.
About half were given intensive instruction in self-exam, including
monthly reminders, and practiced self-exam under medical supervision
every six months for five years. The others received no information.
After 10 or 11 years, the death rates from breast cancer in both
groups were the same: There were 135 breast cancer deaths in the
instruction group of 132,979 women and 131 deaths in the control
group of 133,085 women. In the instruction group, more women found
benign lesions, leading researchers to conclude breast exams without
mammography may increase the chances of having a benign breast
biopsy.</TE>
<TE>   "This study confirms what we knew ... there is still no study that
[breast self-exams] will make a difference in mortality and no study
saying that it doesn't. If there is an effect on mortality, it is a
small one," said Debbie Saslow, director of breast and gynecologic
cancer for the American Cancer Society in Atlanta. The cancer society
continues to recommend mammograms, clinical breast exams by a doctor
or a nurse, and breast self-exams, in that order, she said.</TE>

<TE>   Explanation for Lethal Effects of Chronic Tiredness Is Offered</TE>
<TE>   Chronic tiredness more than doubles the risk of a heart attack,
and some studies have shown that it can be as harmful as high
cholesterol. Now Dutch researchers have discovered a possible
explanation for the life-threatening effects of prolonged fatigue,
sometimes called "vital exhaustion."</TE>
<TE>   There is a delicate balance in the mechanisms that form and
dissolve blood clots, and these processes follow a daily rhythm, said
psychophysiologist Rob van Diest, the study's lead author.</TE>
<TE>   Van Diest and colleagues at Maastricht University found that the
ebb and flow of clotting factors differed in 29 men who suffered from
vital exhaustion compared with 30 healthy men.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, the amount of fibrinogen--a protein that is
important in the blood's clotting--was higher in the exhausted men
than those in the control group, and it was highest early in the
morning.</TE>
<TE>   Other studies have shown that a high fibrinogen level increases
the risk of heart attacks, which occur most often in the morning.</TE>
<TE>   The Dutch researchers also found that the mechanisms that normally
counteract the blood-clotting process were less active in men with
vital exhaustion.</TE>
<TE>   "This study is one of the first to provide a possible explanation
for why prolonged fatigue may be related to the early- morning excess
of heart attacks," Van Diest said.</TE>

<TE>   Study Finds Diet Drinks Helped Limit Weight, Blood Pressure</TE>
<TE>   People who turn to artificial sweeteners to lose weight may be on
the right track.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, a long-term study comparing diet drinks and
foods with those containing sugar found that overweight men and women
consuming sugar, mostly in drinks, gained weight, and their blood
pressure increased.</TE>
<TE>   The comparison group that consumed artificial sweeteners lost a
little weight, and their blood pressure remained stable.</TE>
<TE>   The findings were unexpected, report the researchers, because
other researchers have found that people who eat less sugar tend to
eat more fat and so should gain weight. Research has also shown that
people who ate food flavored with saccharin gained weight.</TE>
<TE>   For 10 weeks, nutrition researchers in Denmark supplemented the
usual diets of 41 overweight people with either sucrose, mostly as
beverages, or with artificial sweeteners, such as aspartame,
acesulfame K, cyclamate and saccharin. The amounts of calories as fat
and protein were the same.</TE>
<TE>   People in both groups ate more food and drink over 10 weeks, but
those in the sugar group consumed the most.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the 10-week study, those in the sugar group gained
about 3.2 pounds more on average than the sweetener group.</TE>
<TE>   According to Anne Raben and her colleagues at the The Royal
Veterinary &amp; Agricultural University in Frederiksberg, the sugar
group may have tipped the scales because calories in fluids are less
satisfying than those in solid foods, making it easier to consume too
many in sweet drinks.</TE>

<LD>Question: I am having trouble getting insurance and suspect my
prescription for Luvox, which I take for trichotillomania, might be
to blame. It's usually prescribed for psychological problems. Is
there a non-drug treatment for my compulsion to pull my hair so I can
stop taking Luvox?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: People who suffer from trichotillomania have an
uncontrollable urge to pull out their hair, sometimes leaving bald
spots.</LD>
<LD>   Luvox belongs to the same category of drugs as Prozac and Zoloft.
All help control symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorders,
including hair pulling. Insurance companies can deny people coverage
for many reasons, so we can't say whether Luvox is responsible in
your case.</LD>
<TE>   Cognitive behavioral therapy might help you overcome this
compulsion. One preliminary study suggests that St. John's wort also
might be helpful.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Many years ago I had chronic hives. Eventually a doctor
prescribed Tagamet, which worked like a charm.</TE>
<TE>   A few years ago, I started getting hives again. Tagamet is now
over-the-counter, and it still works.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is that I take it every day and night and need it to
get a full night's sleep. I've taken six to eight tablets a day for
quite a while. Are there any concerns?</TE>
<TE>   A: Large doses of cimetidine (Tagamet) must be medically
supervised, so discuss this with a dermatologist, who could help you
discover the cause of your rash.</TE>
<TE>   Cimetidine can interact with many other drugs, so don't combine it
without checking. Some people report mental confusion or impotence at
high doses. You also might take extra vitamin B-12, since
acid-suppressing drugs can interfere with efficient absorption of
this nutrient.</TE>
<TE>   Q: I keep hearing about the value of tea over coffee. Would the
benefits also apply to iced tea? What about canned iced tea?</TE>
<TE>   A: Tea is made from the leaves of a type of camellia bush, and it
is full of beneficial plant compounds called flavonoids. These combat
oxidation much as vitamin C or E do and might help prevent heart
disease or some kinds of cancer.</TE>
<TE>   But tea flavonoids lose their antioxidant punch over time. Iced
tea is as good as hot tea if you make it fresh. But canned iced tea
or tea that's been sitting in the fridge doesn't have the same power.</TE>

<HD>A Measure of Heart Risk</HD>

<LD>The easiest way to assess your heart disease risk may be to measure
your waist. A study of more than 9,000 white men and women found that
the thickness of a person's midsection is more closely associated
with other risk factors, such as cholesterol and glucose levels and
blood pressure, than body mass index, or BMI.</LD>
<LD>   BMI, which is based on height and weight, has been used since the
1980s to estimate the risk of obesity-related diseases.</LD>
<LD>   But researchers at the New York Obesity Research Center at St.
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center say their study indicates that waist
circumference is a better indicator of fat distribution and is
therefore more useful in assessing heart disease risk.</LD>
<TE>   Since their study found such a close relationship between the
major risk factors and waist size, it also confirms earlier findings
that too much abdominal fat is dangerous to your health.</TE>
<TE>   Using data from a national health and nutrition survey, the
researchers found that the risk of having a waist size of 35 inches
for men and 33 inches for women was equal to the risk of a BMI of 25,
which is the standard cutoff for being overweight. If the waist grows
to 39 inches for men and 37 inches for women, the risk is equivalent
to a BMI of 30. At that size, the researchers report, it's time to
lower high blood pressure and lose weight.</TE>
<TE>   The study was published recently in the American Journal of
Clinical Nutrition.</TE>

<LD>American Heart Assn.'s Heart Profiler</LD>
<LD>   www.americanheart.org/heartprofilers.com</LD>
<LD>   Background: The AHA, the heart disease research and education
nonprofit organization, has teamed with drug maker Kos
Pharmaceuticals Inc. to help consumers make sense of test results and
learn about the latest research.</LD>
<TE>   What works: The profiler lets you search by the condition central
to your diagnosis, whether high cholesterol, high blood pressure or
family history. Have test results handy: You'll need to enter them to
get complete advice. The best page may be the risk-factor analysis,
which gives numbers connecting age, ethnicity and test-result
readings to overall heart disease risk. Given that the profiler is
sponsored by a maker of cholesterol-lowering drugs, it's not
surprising that drug therapy is strongly suggested for high LDL
scores. In some cases, that recommendation may be premature; often
patients can improve cholesterol readings with diet and exercise. It
would be nice if the site gave a better idea of how much we should
change our lifestyle before considering drugs. But this is a good
guide to how doctors think about treatment.</TE>

<HD>Tighter Restrictions Urged for Use of Hormone Therapy</HD>
<DH>Menopause* With recent studies showing dangers of long-term
estrogen use, a new report summarizes what is known about its risks
and benefits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARI ROAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Women and their doctors are now getting some help making the
complicated decisions about hormone therapy.</LD>
<LD>   But the guidance only goes so far--and doesn't resolve such basic
questions as how long a woman can safely take hormones.</LD>
<LD>   Responding to recent studies that cast doubt on the role of
hormone therapy in preventing major ailments such as heart disease,
the North American Menopause Society last week released a report
summarizing what is known about hormones and recommending appropriate
uses for the drugs.</LD>
<TE>   Many post-menopausal women have been taking hormone therapy based
on the conviction that it might help prevent heart disease and even
some types of cancer.</TE>
<TE>   However, a major study, the Women's Health Initiative, found that
hormone therapy with estrogen and progesterone slightly increases the
risk of heart disease, stroke and breast cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Based on this information, the authors of the new report--a panel
of leading experts in menopause--are recommending much tighter
restrictions on the use of hormones.</TE>
<TE>   "These guidelines bring the focus back on why hormone replacement
was actually introduced in the first place: to deal with
menopausal-related symptoms," said Dr. Wulf Utian, executive director
of the North American Menopause Society.</TE>
<TE>   The guidelines were released at the group's annual meeting last
week in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   "The way the original news [regarding the Women's Health
Initiative] was dumped onto women and their health providers, without
any real commentary or analysis of what it meant, created enormous
chaos. While we don't profess that this is a final answer, we think
that providing some well-considered recommendations will be of
value."</TE>
<TE>   Given what is now known about hormone therapy, the panel
recommended:</TE>
<TE>   * Hormone therapy be confined to treatment for menopausal
symptoms, such as hot flashes and vaginal dryness.</TE>
<TE>   * Hormone therapy (both estrogen-plus-progestogen and estrogen
alone) should not be used for prevention of heart disease.</TE>
<TE>   * Even though some hormone therapy products are approved for the
prevention of osteoporosis, alternative treatments should be
considered because of the risk associated with hormone therapy.</TE>
<TE>   * Hormone therapy should be limited to the shortest duration
possible to treat symptoms.</TE>
<TE>   * Lower-than-standard doses of hormone therapy should be
considered when treating menopausal symptoms.</TE>
<TE>   The advisory committee could not reach a consensus on several
points, however, including how long to prescribe hormone therapy for
such problems as hot flashes.</TE>
<TE>   Previously, short-term therapy was considered to be three to five
years; long-term therapy was defined as longer than three to five
years--but there are no data on when the risks of hormone therapy
begin to outweigh the benefits.</TE>
<TE>   The panel recommended that women and their doctors reevaluate the
need for hormones at each visit.</TE>
<TE>   Nor could the panel agree whether hormone therapy should be
recommended to women with premature menopause. Moreover, the doctors
could not decide whether the findings of the Women's Health
Initiative, which studied a traditional hormone regimen consisting of
conjugated equine estrogens (known as Premarin) and
medroxyprogesterone acetate, could be generalized to other types of
hormone therapy, such as estrogen skin patches and plant-based
hormone products.</TE>
<TE>   Women and their doctors shouldn't assume that other forms of
hormone therapy are any safer, the report cautions.</TE>
<TE>   "We chose to put out a report saying, look, we don't know all the
answers," said Utian. "Even a group of experts cannot come out with
consensus on certain points. That is good for the public to know."</TE>
<TE>   The guidelines appear to be founded on a rigorous examination of
the scientific data, said Cindy Pearson, director of the National
Women's Health Network, a consumer organization based in Washington,
D.C.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a big step forward," Pearson said. "If this had been
common practice in the last 10 years, millions fewer women would have
used hormone replacement therapy. Women have had life-threatening
conditions that we now know are associated with hormone replacement
therapy."</TE>
<TE>   While the guidelines should help educate women and doctors on the
appropriate use of hormones, Pearson said she worries that misleading
advertising from dietary supplement manufacturers, pharmaceutical
companies, compounding pharmacies and other businesses selling
menopausal remedies may confuse consumers.</TE>
<TE>   "There are so many companies sending messages directly to women
and to health care providers, making claims that haven't been
proven," she said.</TE>

<HD>The Danger of Too Much Iron</HD>
<DH>Doctors say high levels of the mineral may be more of a
problem than deficiencies are. Excessive absorption can lead to
serious illnesses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM HATHAWAY</AU>
<BD>HARTFORD COURANT</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A growing number of doctors are now convinced that for many people,
too much iron in the blood is a bigger health problem than too
little.</LD>
<LD>   "For years we were getting, 'Rah, rah, the more iron the better.'
Now that has changed around completely," said Richard Stevens, a
cancer epidemiologist at University of Connecticut Health Center who
has studied the potential health risks of elevated levels of iron.</LD>
<LD>   Iron deficiency is a significant problem for many people,
particularly women of childbearing age. In the last decade, however,
evidence has mounted that high levels of iron can have severe, even
fatal consequences, for people who can't properly absorb the vital,
but potentially toxic, mineral.</LD>
<TE>   Particularly at risk are men and post-menopausal women of Northern
European ancestry--the groups most susceptible to genetic mutations
that can lead to hemochromatosis, in which iron is excessively
absorbed in the liver, pancreas and other organs.</TE>
<TE>   Hemochromatosis can lead to cirrhosis, diabetes, arthritis and
impotence and has been implicated in some forms of heart disease and
cancer. The damage is irreversible unless it's discovered early. If
it is, a change in diet, such as reducing consumption of red meat and
alcohol and an ancient treatment, blood-letting, can help return iron
in the blood to normal levels.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is that most of the early symptoms of hemochromatosis,
such as fatigue, joint pain, sexual dysfunction in men and frequent
headaches in women, are also symptoms in more common disorders. A
more specific symptom--bronzing of the skin-- doesn't always occur,
experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Also complicating the issue is that while the health threats of
hemochromatosis are clear, much uncertainty remains about how many
people are at risk of contracting the disease and the level of risk
posed by moderately elevated levels of iron.</TE>
<TE>   Most hemochromatosis patients have genetic mutations that
predispose them to the disease. By one estimate, as many as one in
250 people of Northern European ancestry possess two copies of the
mutation, making it one of the more common genetic diseases. But many
people with the mutations do not develop hemochromatosis.</TE>
<TE>   The risk of developing excess iron levels seems to increase with
age.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Dr. Richard Wood, a Tufts University nutrition expert,
and his colleagues analyzed blood iron levels in more than 1,000 men
and women, ages 67 to 96, in the landmark, long-term Framingham Heart
Study. While 2.7% had abnormally low levels of iron, more than four
times that many-- 12.9%--had too much of the mineral, according to
the research, published in the American Journal of Clinical
Nutrition.</TE>
<TE>   Stevens' studies have suggested that even moderately high levels
of iron can increase the risk of cancer. Animal studies have shown
conclusively that iron is indeed a carcinogen, he said.</TE>
<TE>   However, there is some ambiguity in studies on the health risks of
excess iron, noted Dr. Herbert Bonkovsky, director of clinical
research at the Liver-Biliary-Pancreatic Center at the University of
Connecticut Health Center.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, one recent study showed people with a genetic
predisposition to hemochromatosis did not appear to suffer any more
health problems than those without the mutation, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bonkovsky suggests that men over 40 and women over 50 get tested
for iron levels, which is generally not included as part of most
physicals.</TE>

<HD>Battling an Aggressive Killer</HD>
<DH>Disease* Triggered by trauma or infection, sepsis can lead
to organ failure and death, particularly among those with weak immune
systems.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM HATHAWAY and HILARY WALDMAN</AU>
<BD>HARTFORD COURANT</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On any given day in the medical intensive care unit at Yale-New Haven
Hospital in Connecticut, three or four of the 14 beds are occupied by
patients whose own bodies threaten to kill them before their disease
does.</LD>
<LD>   They are the victims of sepsis, an overwhelming immune response to
infection or trauma that can plow through the body like a freight
train, shutting down lungs, kidneys and heart. Across the country
this year, an estimated 225,000 people will die of sepsis.</LD>
<LD>   "Eighty percent of sepsis patients have something else wrong with
them, but anybody can get this," said Dr. Mark D. Siegel, director of
the medical intensive care unit at Yale-New Haven. "From the time it
starts, a patient who is immuno-suppressed from AIDS or cancer could
be dead in a matter of hours."</LD>
<TE>   In the last decade, the medical community has become more adept at
recognizing and preventing the devastating series of events that
leads to severe sepsis, which used to kill more than 60% of its
victims. But about one-third of people who become septic still are
expected to die.</TE>
<TE>   Though the death rate in severe cases has been cut nearly in half
in recent years, some experts expect the death toll from
sepsis--already larger than breast, prostate and colon cancers
combined--will continue to rise.</TE>
<TE>   A study by Emory University and the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention showed that the incidence of sepsis more than tripled
between 1979 and 1999, increasing by an average of 16% each year. In
that 20-year period, the number of cases rose from 78 per 100,000
people to 259. Experts say that is primarily because more and more
elderly patients with frail immune systems have been treated with
life-saving techniques, such as chemotherapy and intensive care
ventilators, that also carry a risk of a potentially
sepsis-triggering infection.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not optimistic we can reduce that number," said Dr. Gordon
Bernard, professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical
School and chief of pulmonary and critical care at Vanderbilt
Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't mean there aren't things that can't be done, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Elderly people, for instance, can remain current with vaccinations
for flu and pneumococcal pneumonia. Hospitals can reduce the risk of
infection by simply making sure that nurses and doctors keep their
hands washed, Bernard said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like a turn signal," Bernard said. "You should do it 100% of
the time, but sometimes you don't."</TE>
<TE>   Also, doctors and hospital staff need to learn more about sepsis
and recognize the symptoms of its onset, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In the early stages, sepsis can be mistaken for a low-grade
illness. Patients might have a low fever. The difference is that with
sepsis the heart and breathing rates might be unusually rapid. Blood
tests will show white blood cell counts that are unusually high or
low.</TE>
<TE>   Antibiotic treatment of the underlying infection must be prompt to
prevent events that lead to widespread organ failure, doctors say.</TE>

<HD>Celery Doesn't Have 'Negative Calories,' but Lots of
Positives</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like urban legends, some food myths will not die. One such myth is
that celery contains "negative calories," (that is, you would have to
expend more calories to eat a stalk of celery than you would get from
it). Celery is extremely low in calories, with just 6 per 8-inch
stalk, but no food has negative calories.</LD>
<LD>   Like cucumbers and iceberg lettuce, celery is almost entirely
water, about 95%. Four ounces, or about three ribs, of raw celery
contain about 13% of the vitamin C and about 10% of the fiber you
should get each day, along with a good supply of potassium. Celery is
fairly high in sodium (35 milligrams per stalk), but not so high that
people on low-sodium diets should worry.</LD>
<LD>   When you buy celery, look for a glossy surface and a light color.
The darker varieties have more nutrients but are also stringier and
not so tasty.</LD>
<TE>   The leaves on a bunch of celery should be green and not wilted.
The ribs should be firm, without cracks or bruises.</TE>
<TE>   Look for any areas that appear to have been trimmed to hide
bruises or rotting. If the celery is damaged, it will not keep and is
potentially dangerous because of a natural carcinogen celery produces
in very small quantities. Damaged celery produces more of this
material.</TE>

<LD>Question: I'm 27 and not really overweight but a bit on the flabby
side. To try to firm up, I've recently attended Pilates classes--one
at a studio and another at my gym. The moves in these classes were
very different.</LD>
<LD>   Isn't there a particular form or method the instructors should be
teaching?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: In some workout facilities, the once-strict Pilates method
has been diluted. A U.S. District Court recently declared "Pilates"
to be a generic form of exercise--like kickboxing or yoga.
Consequently, the name has moved into the mainstream. This means that
gyms, studios and instructors are free to use the term "Pilates,"
even though the instructors may not be teaching the original method
developed by Joseph Pilates in the 1920s. (The original Pilates
fitness system emphasizes flexibility and strength, usually on
specific machines.)</LD>
<TE>   Some fitness clubs are thankful for this ruling--creating hybrids
that blend Pilates with yoga, martial arts or weight training.
Long-time Pilates instructors don't approve of what they call the
"watered down" method, saying the authentic exercises are lost by
gyms turning Pilates into a gimmick.</TE>

<HD>Prenatal Care Can Help Prevent Preeclampsia</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN FIELDING and VALERIE ULENE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There was a time--just a few decades ago--when pregnancy was
considered relatively dangerous.</LD>
<LD>   Today, because of improved medical care, a woman's risk of serious
complications or death during pregnancy and delivery is extremely
low. Nevertheless, one serious problem continues to plague pregnant
women and obstetricians: preeclampsia.</LD>
<LD>   During the last decade, the rate of preeclampsia has increased by
nearly one-third, and the condition currently affects about 8% of all
pregnancies. In women with preeclampsia, arteries throughout the body
constrict, narrowing the opening through which blood can flow and
diminishing the blood supply to virtually all organs in the body,
including the placenta and fetus. This narrowing of the vessels also
causes blood pressure to rise, sometimes to dangerous levels.</LD>
<TE>   These changes can lead to life-threatening complications. For the
fetus, preeclampsia can result in abnormal growth and prematurity;
for the mother, it can cause extensive damage to internal organs such
as the kidneys, liver, lungs and brain.</TE>
<TE>   In the most severe cases, the mother may develop liver or kidney
failure, bleeding disorders or seizures that can lead to coma and
death. Once seizures occur, the condition is referred to as
eclampsia.</TE>
<TE>   Women who are younger than 20, older than 40, overweight or
carrying twins or triplets are more likely to develop preeclampsia,
as are those with certain medical conditions, such as diabetes and
high blood pressure.</TE>
<TE>   The exact cause of preeclampsia is not known. At one time, it was
believed that poisonous toxins in the pregnant woman's blood were
responsible (hence, the condition was called "toxemia of pregnancy").
However, no such toxins have been identified.</TE>
<TE>   Simple blood pressure measurements and urinalyses provide the
earliest and best clues that preeclampsia is developing. A diagnosis
is made when significant elevations in blood pressure are detected
after the 20th week of pregnancy and are accompanied by evidence of
protein in the urine.</TE>
<TE>   The "and" is important because not all pregnant women with high
blood pressure have preeclampsia. Some suffer from chronic
hypertension--their blood pressure was elevated before they became
pregnant. (If their blood pressure was not measured before they
became pregnant, it may be difficult at first to determine if they
have preeclampsia.)</TE>
<TE>   Other women have high blood pressure readings during pregnancy
because of gestational hypertension. In these women, blood pressure
rises during pregnancy, but there is typically no protein detected in
the urine. And, unlike preeclampsia, gestational hypertension usually
is not associated with any significant complications for either the
fetus or the mother.</TE>
<TE>   The treatment of preeclampsia is based on several factors,
including the severity of the disease and the age of the fetus. The
problem is "cured" by delivering the baby, although this is not
practical if the fetus is premature and the mother's health is not in
immediate jeopardy. Therefore, mild preeclampsia is often managed
with bed rest and medications to lower blood pressure. Because
preeclampsia can deteriorate quickly, close monitoring of the mother
and fetus are necessary throughout the remainder of the pregnancy.</TE>
<TE>   In more severe cases, premature delivery of the baby is sometimes
warranted. Evidence that the fetus is failing to grow properly or
that the mother's kidney or liver function is deteriorating, for
example, may prompt immediate delivery. Except for early delivery,
there is little evidence to suggest that the current medical
treatments for preeclampsia are effective.</TE>
<TE>   The best thing a woman can do to protect herself against
preeclampsia and eclampsia is to get prenatal care. A recent study
found that women who receive no prenatal care are more than seven
times as likely to die from complications of preeclampsia and
eclampsia as women who receive any prenatal care.</TE>

<LD>Sometimes, the best time to schedule the first prenatal visit is
before getting pregnant.</LD>
<LD>   The doctor can obtain a baseline blood pressure and help a woman
get in the best possible health before her pregnancy begins. This is
particularly true for women with chronic high blood pressure or other
risk factors for preeclampsia.</LD>
<LD>   Women with hypertension should get their blood pressure under
control before becoming pregnant, using lifestyle changes such as
salt restriction and weight loss in lieu of medications whenever
possible.</LD>
<TE>   In severe cases, however, medications may be indicated. Although
certain types of antihypertensive drugs should be avoided in
pregnancy (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors such as captopril
and angiotensin receptor blockers such as losartan), other types can
be safely taken.</TE>

<LD>The U.S. Department of Agriculture's new labels are designed to help
consumers figure out--at a glance--the exact organic content of the
foods they buy.</LD>
<LD>   Only products in the first two categories, in which 95% or more of
the ingredients are organic, can bear the USDA organic certification
seal. This includes products made domestically and imported from
abroad. No genetically modified organisms, chemical pesticides,
irradiation or sewage sludge can be used to make products that carry
the "organic" label.</LD>
<LD>   * 100% organic: Exclusively cultivated and processed according to
USDA standards.</LD>
<TE>   * Organic: At least 95% of the ingredients are organic. (For some
packaged foods, key ingredients, such as spices or enzymes, aren't
available in organic versions.)</TE>
<TE>   * Made with organic ingredients: At least 70% of the ingredients
are organic. In this category, the word "organic" can be printed on
the front of the package, but the product can't use the USDA logo.
These products can't contain any added sulfites, either.</TE>
<TE>   * Some organic ingredients: Less than 70% of the ingredients are
organic. On these products, organic ingredients can be listed on the
side panel of the package along with other ingredients, but no
organic claims can be made on the front of the package.</TE>

<HD>Rethinking the Game Plan</HD>
<DH>Many investors have learned the hard way that risk is not
always rewarded and that some market 'truths' are only half-truths.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's nothing like a bear market to test an investor's ability to
tolerate risk.</LD>
<LD>   Stuart Siegel, a 47-year-old Los Angeles resident, readily admits
he failed that test.</LD>
<LD>   "I think I'm pretty typical," Siegel said. "My thought was to be
aggressive, earn as much as possible and retire early. I was reaching
for the moon."</LD>
<TE>   Now Siegel is fixated on how to protect his nest egg from
additional losses--not just in the near term, but in bear markets
that may be far in the future.</TE>
<TE>   "I lost 45% to 48% of my portfolio before I realized that I don't
have the stomach for this," Siegel said. "I will never do that
again."</TE>
<TE>   As the longest market decline since the Great Depression ground
its way through the third quarter, millions of Americans learned the
same cruel lesson. Following advice about how much risk the "average"
investor should be willing to accept in return for stock market
rewards, they discovered too late that they aren't "average."</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Southland financial planners say, 5% to 30% of their
clients have pulled out of the stock market in recent months rather
than face the prospect of further losses. And the planners are loathe
to stop them, even though many believe that stock prices are,
finally, getting close to a bottom.</TE>
<TE>   These planners, who once thought young investors with lots of time
could handle lots of risk--particularly when these investors
described themselves as risk tolerant--now think that they and their
clients underestimated their threshold for pain.</TE>
<TE>   "The market is showing us that the reality of living through a
bear market is a lot different than reading about it in a book or
financial magazine," said Christopher Orndorff, managing principal at
Los Angeles investment firm Payden &amp; Rygel.</TE>
<TE>   The number of people bailing out of stocks--investors on balance
pulled money out of equity mutual funds at a record pace this
summer--has taught planners that they need to be more forceful when
explaining market risks to their clients.</TE>
<TE>   Classic asset allocation models, which typically recommend that
investors have a significant percentage of their money in stocks even
as they approach retirement, are still valid, planners say.</TE>
<TE>   But some also say they have become less inclined to talk their
clients out of portfolios that the planner might consider too
conservative, assuming the stock market will someday recover.</TE>
<TE>   "I do believe that asset allocation will work long-term. The
problem is that the stomach cannot always handle the long term," said
Linda A. Barlow, a financial planner in Santa Ana. "We don't deal
with computers. We deal with live bodies, and they are having a hard
time holding on."</TE>
<TE>   Many investors have been victimized by their faith in market
"truths" that turned out to be half-truths. If you're trying to
develop an investing game plan that reflects the lessons learned in
the last two years, without becoming overly fearful of the future,
recognizing these half-truths may help you prepare yourself for
whatever markets bring next:</TE>
<TE>   Half-truth: Risk and reward go hand-in-hand.</TE>
<TE>   Real truth: Only some risks are rewarded.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, investors were both warned about
stocks and lured into them with the promise that financial markets
reward those who take risks, said Christopher Jones, executive vice
president of financial research and strategy with Financial Engines,
an investment Web site based in Menlo Park, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   "But there are good risks--the kind that you get compensated
for--and there are bad risks," he said. There still is ample reason
to believe that, over time, you will be fairly compensated for taking
the risk of owning a diversified portfolio of stocks. But the odds
are far lower that you'll be well-rewarded for the risk of holding
just one stock (say, your employer's), or a portfolio concentrated in
one industry.</TE>
<TE>   This is the trap that snared Siegel. He thought the risk of being
100% invested in a mix of technology stocks was just a bit higher
than the risk of being fully invested in a diversified portfolio of
stocks. Moreover, he thought his portfolio would perform better, on
average, over time, because he was taking more risk than the average
well-diversified investor.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the concept of no-pain, no-gain," said Alan Skrainka, chief
market strategist at brokerage Edward Jones &amp; Co. in St. Louis. "But
the risk-reward principle only applies to diversified asset classes
and only over a long period of time."</TE>
<TE>   Despite many investors' temptation to keep shrinking away from
equities, Skrainka argues that each additional losing month in the
market boosts the odds that new buyers will be well-compensated for
the risk they're taking, over the long run.</TE>
<TE>   When you are surrounded by bad news--the country may go to war;
Wall Street and Main Street are beset with scandal; corporate profits
are down; the economy is tenuous--investors perceive the stock market
as being a very risky place. As a result, stock prices are lower, and
their potential for appreciation is greater, Skrainka said.</TE>
<TE>   "Bear markets all follow the same script," he said. "They start
when you're surrounded by nothing but good news and are convinced
that stocks can do nothing but go up. They end when you're surrounded
by bad news and convinced that putting money in the stock market
would be a terrible idea."</TE>
<TE>   Skrainka's advice for true long-term investors: "Grit your teeth
and write a check to your favorite mutual fund." But stick with a
diversified approach, he cautions.</TE>
<TE>   As many people found out too late, "Being all in technology stocks
is a terrible idea, because you are taking on all kinds of risk
that's just risk," said Financial Engines' Jones. "It's unlikely that
you are ever going to get compensated for taking that chance."</TE>
<TE>   Half-truth: If you have a lot of time, you can handle a lot more
risk.</TE>
<TE>   Real truth: If you have a lot of time, your portfolio can handle
more risk, but whether you can live with it day to day is another
issue.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1990s, many investors believed that if they had a 20-year
or longer time horizon, they could comfortably handle the ups and
downs of the stock market along the way. So, the argument went, true
long-term investors could afford to keep virtually all of their
savings in stocks, with the idea of maximizing returns.</TE>
<TE>   That may well be accurate in theory, said Jones. But in practice
it only works if an investor is so steadfast that he or she can
handle losing more than 50% of his or her portfolio without bailing
out or shifting strategy. And the market of the last two years has
shattered the illusion that the vast majority of investors are that
impervious to pain.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems to me that all our investors have a dollar amount in
their heads. If their investments fall below that number, they can't
stand it," said Laura Tarbox, a Newport Beach-based financial
planner. "We are getting much more careful about asking people just
how much they're prepared to lose."</TE>
<TE>   That has led to a new appreciation of the importance of non-stock
assets in portfolios--bonds, money-market accounts, real estate,
etc.--even for investors with very long time horizons.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Brown, a financial planner at Denver-based investment
advisory firm Brown &amp; Tedstrom, says he turns down potential clients
who aren't willing to diversify. No matter how willing investors are
to tolerate losses, keeping all of their money in stocks is a recipe
for disaster, Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to live in a world where my clients are so on the
economic edge that they're all basket cases," he said. "Every
portfolio needs shock absorbers."</TE>
<TE>   Broad diversification was an unpopular message when stock prices
were rising rapidly, said Louis Barajas, a Los Angeles financial
planner who focuses on Latino clients. Diversification was seen as
nothing but a drag on returns.</TE>
<TE>   "When everybody else was earning 20% a year, our clients weren't,"
he said. "We had them in six or seven asset classes that weren't
doing as well as stocks. But now we're looking good. Diversification
works better in a down market than it does in a good one."</TE>
<TE>   It isn't enough to put assets in different investment
classes--such as stocks, bonds, cash and real estate--planners
stress. Investors need to diversify within those asset classes too,
Orndorff said.</TE>
<TE>   For example, fixed-income holdings should consist of a mix of
government bonds, corporate bonds and mortgage-backed securities,
many financial advisors say.</TE>
<TE>   Stock portfolios always should include shares of big companies and
small ones, growth stocks, value stocks and foreign stocks, across an
array of industries.</TE>
<TE>   Half-truth: Historical performance is an indicator of future
returns.</TE>
<TE>   Real truth: Historical performance is just an indicator of past
performance, especially when "history" is only a few years long.</TE>
<TE>   Most investors have heard the caveat that "past performance is no
guarantee of future results." But during the bull market,
advertisements and analyst reports trumpeting any star mutual fund
manager's stellar 12-month or five-year "track record" seemed much
more compelling investment guides.</TE>
<TE>   Few investment pros dispute that market history can be
instructive. It provides a glimpse of average returns for various
asset classes. It tells volumes about volatility, and gives an idea
of what to expect in the way of long-term returns for different
markets.</TE>
<TE>   But investors can be easily misled by focusing on the fairly
recent past, which is what "historical performance" came to mean to
many in the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "We all become victims of our most recent experience," Orndorff
said. "If you were talking to someone in 1980, they would say that
inflation is a real problem and stocks are miserable investments. If
you were talking to someone in 1999, they would say inflation is dead
and you should throw all your money in equities--they never go down."</TE>
<TE>   Stock returns in the late 1990s were abnormally high by historical
standards. Meanwhile, market volatility was abnormally low. For many
investors, that made the concept of market risk hard to grasp.</TE>
<TE>   Investors thought the question of volatility was simply whether
they'd earn 10% or 20% on their stocks in a given year--when it
really meant that their portfolio could be cut to ribbons, Brown
said.</TE>
<TE>   The last bull market also threw off computer programs designed to
pick the right asset allocation for financial planners' clients,
Orndorff noted.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people would blindly feed data into these programs, not
realizing what an aberration the 1990s were," he said. "The models
look for investments that have high returns and low volatility, so
when you feed in just that recent stock market data, the program is
going to tell you to put more and more of that asset in the
portfolio."</TE>
<TE>   Much longer views of market performance give a more accurate
picture.</TE>
<TE>   The more than 75 years of market statistics compiled by Ibbotson
Associates, for instance, show that long periods of abnormally high
stock market returns tend to be followed by periods of abnormally low
returns.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to try to ignore recent history and look out over a much
longer period of time," Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   History says the stock market eventually will recover from its
current despair. But history also says any recovery in the near term
may be weak because of the hangover from the 1990s boom.</TE>
<TE>   Investors whose financial goals are shorter-term in nature must
take that possibility into account when designing or redesigning a
portfolio, financial pros say.</TE>

<HD>Equity Funds: Bad to Worse</HD>
<DH>On average, stock funds fell 17.2% in the quarter and every
category lost money. Investors still wonder: Where's the bottom?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN and TOM PETRUNO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even Wall Street's biggest bulls have a hard time sugar-coating the
stock market's performance of the last few months.</LD>
<LD>   Beset by corporate financial scandals, doubts about the economic
recovery and fears of a U.S.-Iraq war, share prices have continued to
slide, extending the worst bear market in a generation.</LD>
<LD>   How bad was it in the third quarter ended Sept. 30? The average
domestic stock mutual fund lost 17.2%, one of the biggest quarterly
losses ever, according to fund tracker Morningstar Inc.</LD>
<TE>   At this stage of the downturn that began more than 30 months ago,
there is almost no place to hide: Fewer than 1 in 100 stock funds
gained ground in the quarter, and every equity fund category lost
money, on average--even gold-oriented funds and real estate-related
funds, which had been market stars in the first half of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, investors last quarter began selling stocks that, until
then, they had regarded as keepers. That knocked many
"value"-oriented mutual funds into the red for the year.</TE>
<TE>   The selling hasn't stopped: On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial
average closed at 7,528.40, nearly a five-year low. The
technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index ended at a six-year low
of 1,139.90.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most comforting fact left for investors who are trying
to find a reason to be optimistic is simply that things are already
so bad. Isn't this the way it's supposed to feel at the bottom?</TE>
<TE>   The decline in blue-chip stocks, as measured by the Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 index, equals the drop of 1973-74 at about 48% from the
bull market peak. The '73-74 bear market had been the worst since the
Depression years.</TE>
<TE>   Unless the economy is going to reprise the 1930s experience, some
Wall Street bulls say, why should share prices lose more than half
their value?</TE>
<TE>   The market's bears have an answer: Stock valuations, using such
classic measures as price-to-earnings ratios, aren't nearly as cheap
as they were at the end of 1974, when many big-name shares were
valued at P/Es in single digits.</TE>
<TE>   The S&amp;P 500 now is priced at 15 to 18 times this year's estimated
operating earnings, depending on whose earnings estimate is used.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, even though the Nasdaq composite index has plummeted
77% from its March 2000 peak, many technology stocks remain highly
valued, even assuming a corporate profit recovery arrives in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Chip giant Intel Corp., for example, at $13.71 a share Friday, is
priced at 18 times analysts' average earnings estimate for 2003,
according to Thomson Financial.</TE>
<TE>   Some veteran money managers worry that even if the market is
bottoming, the psychology will remain so negative toward stocks that
share prices will do little more than move sideways for years.</TE>
<TE>   John Bollinger, head of Bollinger Capital Management in Manhattan
Beach, said the 1990s "cult of equities" has soured to the point
where many investors may give up on the market entirely, just as they
did after the mid-1970s slump.</TE>
<TE>   "I fear we're losing a generation of investors, many of whom may
never come back," Bollinger said.</TE>
<TE>   Stock mutual funds have faced net withdrawals since June.
Foreigners also have soured on U.S. assets. And U.S. corporate
managers have lost their appetite for mergers, diminishing another
key source of demand for stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last three years, the return on the average domestic
stock fund is a negative 8.5% per year, according to Morningstar. The
average fund also is negative for the last five years, with a loss of
2.2% per year.</TE>
<TE>   But the gloomier the discussions get, the greater the likelihood
that the bear market is nearing an end, some Wall Street veterans
say. At least, that's the way it has generally worked.</TE>
<TE>   Oakmark Funds' Bill Nygren, a well-known value stock manager whom
Morningstar last year named its equity fund manager of the year,
warns that investors who sell stocks now may be "making the same
mistake they made three years ago when they sold value and bought
growth"--basing their decision on recent returns rather than a
thoughtful long-term asset allocation strategy.</TE>
<TE>   For investors who are still daring to keep track of their stock
fund portfolios, the third quarter produced some shifts that may have
lasting significance.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the third-quarter highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Growth beat value. Growth-oriented funds lost less than their
value-style counterparts, reversing the recent pattern. Large-cap
growth funds, for instance, fell 15.8% on average versus an 18.3%
decline for the average large-cap value fund.</TE>
<TE>   The financial sector's woes were especially damaging to value
funds, according to fund tracker Lipper Inc., as the bear market and
investigations of Wall Street conflicts of interest weighed on major
investment banking stocks such as J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. and
Citigroup Inc. Those stocks long have been among value fund managers'
favorites.</TE>
<TE>   Also, investors rushing to sell stocks and funds in the midsummer
meltdown may have been taking profits in the few sectors in which
they still had them--mainly value--said Don Cassidy, senior analyst
at Lipper.</TE>
<TE>   Real estate funds, big winners in the first half and a classic
value sector, turned negative in the quarter but still held up better
than most categories, falling 8.8% on average. They suffered another
decline last week, pushing the average fund into the red for the
year, according to Morningstar.</TE>
<TE>   Growth funds' relatively stronger showing didn't spread to the
technology sector. The average tech fund dropped 26.6% in the quarter
and is down 51.4% for the year, after diving 38.3% in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   * Big-cap beat small-cap. In general, smaller stocks had been
performing better than bigger stocks since the bear market began in
March 2000. That reversed in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The average small-cap growth fund's 19.8% drop in the quarter was
four percentage points worse than the average large-cap growth fund's
loss, Morningstar data show.</TE>
<TE>   Large-cap "blend" funds, which hold a mix of growth and value
stocks, fell 16% in the quarter, versus a loss of 19.1% for small-cap
blend funds.</TE>
<TE>   One reason smaller shares were hit harder may be that, with the
drumbeat of war growing louder in Washington, investors felt more
comfortable holding more liquid blue chip stocks, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   As with value stocks, profit-taking in previously
strong-performing smaller stocks also may have been a factor.</TE>
<TE>   * Foreign funds were in a world of hurt. Foreign stock funds had
held up in the first half, helped in part by a weaker dollar.</TE>
<TE>   But Wall Street's summer sell-off hammered many foreign markets as
well. And the dollar began to strengthen again versus the euro and
the yen, so the currency benefit that U.S. owners of foreign shares
had reaped in the first half was halted.</TE>
<TE>   The average European stock fund slid 21.8% in the quarter,
compared with the 17.2% drop in the average U.S. fund. Germany's
economy slowed to a crawl in summer, deepening concerns about the
European economic outlook.</TE>
<TE>   The average Japanese fund was down 13.4% in the quarter as the
Nikkei-225 index fell to a 19-year low.</TE>
<TE>   Latin American funds plummeted 23.4%, on average, in the quarter.
That category was hurt by worries that a leftist candidate might win
Brazil's presidency, and by fears that the U.S. economy would fall
back into recession, hurting Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Still, other emerging markets fared better: The average
diversified emerging-markets fund was off 16.1% in the quarter and
13.3% in the nine months.</TE>
<TE>   * Gold funds lost momentum. The average gold-stock fund fell 3.7%,
as the metal's price stalled out in June before rallying again in
recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Year to date, gold funds still rank as the top performer among all
equity funds with a 44.9% gain, on average. The funds rose 20.2% last
year.</TE>
<TE>   * "Bear" funds rolled in the dough. The handful of stock funds
that always follow a bearish strategy--using short-selling and other
techniques to achieve returns in the opposite direction of indexes
such as the Nasdaq 100 or the S&amp;P 500--naturally made money in the
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   ProFunds UltraBear, up 33.8%, was the best-performing fund of any
type in the quarter. Its gain through the first nine months was
71.4%. The Prudent Bear fund rose 17.5% in the quarter and 73.8% in
the nine months.</TE>
<TE>   Investors who believe the bear market has longer to run may be
tempted to look at these funds as a hedge against greater portfolio
destruction. But analysts warn that if the market should rebound,
these funds would instantly be among the worst performers.</TE>

<HD>Tax Deductions Can Shield You From Some Capital Losses</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Capital losses may be painful for investors, but they're potentially
helpful for taxpayers willing to harvest the losses for current and
future tax deductions.</LD>
<LD>   "The only thing good about bad markets is most of your
[investment] sales aren't taxable," said Philip J. Holthouse, partner
in Los Angeles tax law and accounting firm Holthouse Carlin &amp; Van
Trigt. "At least losses are deductible."</LD>
<LD>   There's one caveat: Paper losses don't count. To claim a capital
loss on your tax return, you must have "realized" the loss by selling
the investment for less than you paid. And if you have a loss within
a tax-deferred account, such as a 401(k) plan, you generally can't
take advantage of it. Just as profits are sheltered from tax within
these accounts, so are losses.</LD>
<TE>   However, if the big declines in stock prices this year--and the
large recent outflow of cash from stock mutual funds--are any
indication, Americans are up to their elbows in realized capital
losses. Here's a primer on investment losses, when to trigger them
and what to do with them.</TE>
<TE>   * Triggering a loss:</TE>
<TE>   To write off a capital loss, you must have realized the loss by
selling the depreciated stock or fund.</TE>
<TE>   For example, if you bought 100 shares of Cisco Systems at $65 a
share ($6,500 total) and sold them for $10 ($1,000), you'd have a
capital loss of $5,500.</TE>
<TE>   That loss can be used to offset any capital gains--realized
profits--from the sale of other investments during the year,
including capital gains paid out by mutual funds in their annual
"distributions."</TE>
<TE>   As with most things in the tax code, however, it's not quite that
simple.</TE>
<TE>   To calculate your net capital gains or losses, you first must
group the securities according to how long you owned them. If you
held a security for a year or less before selling it, it's classified
as a short-term loss or gain. If you held it for more than a year, it
goes in the long-term category.</TE>
<TE>   On Schedule D of your federal tax return, you first offset
long-term losses against long-term gains and short-term losses
against short-term gains. If you have more losses in either the
short- or long-term category than gains in that category, leftover
losses can be used to offset gains of the other type, if you have
any.</TE>
<TE>   This is a crucial exercise, because long- and short-term gains are
taxed at different rates. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 20%
rate, while short-term gains are taxed at ordinary income tax rates,
which can exceed 38%.</TE>
<TE>   Here's how the math works: Suppose you sell your holdings of stock
A, realizing a short-term gain of $1,000. You also own shares of
stock B, which you bought for $3,000 but which are now worth $2,000.
By selling stock B, you generate a loss that completely offsets the
short-term gain from selling stock A. And since short-term gains are
taxed at regular income tax rates, that would save someone in the 31%
bracket $310 in federal income taxes.</TE>
<TE>   A caveat: It's not always advisable to sell an investment simply
to generate a tax loss. Generally you should have other reasons for
wanting to sell the security--for instance, conditions in its
industry have changed and you no longer think a company is a good
long-term investment.</TE>
<TE>   * Wash sales:</TE>
<TE>   One reason you should carefully consider whether to sell a
security is that so-called wash sale rules prohibit you from selling
a stock to trigger a loss and then immediately repurchasing it. You
must wait at least 31 days to repurchase the same security. If you
purchase an identical security before that point, you'll trigger the
wash sale rules, which effectively wipe away the capital loss.</TE>
<TE>   What if you're a mutual fund investor and you want to sell one
fund and buy another that's similar? If you purchased the identical
fund, you would trigger wash sale rules, but you probably could buy
another fund--even another fund that was similar to the one you just
sold--without triggering a wash sale, as long as there was some
difference that mattered.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, you could sell one growth fund and buy
another--assuming the funds had different managers and didn't own all
of the same stocks. In some circumstances, you might even be able to
justify buying a fund that had substantially the same investments.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, you might sell XYZ Corp.'s S&amp;P 500 index fund and
buy ABC Corp.'s S&amp;P 500 index fund if you could point to some
compelling difference between the two. Such as? If ABC Corp. charged
lower annual management fees on its fund; if you had other accounts
with ABC and wanted to consolidate your holdings to one fund company;
or if ABC could be traded on the Web, while XYZ could not, those
would all be differences worth trading a security over.</TE>
<TE>   * Reduce ordinary income:</TE>
<TE>   If your total realized losses exceed your gains in any one year,
you can use up to $3,000 in excess capital losses to reduce the
amount of ordinary income (such as wages, dividends and interest)
subject to tax. This loss is reported on line 13 of the 1040 tax
form. Instead of showing a taxable capital gain there, you'd put the
amount of the loss--up to $3,000--in brackets.</TE>
<TE>   Since ordinary income tax rates can exceed 38%, a $3,000 deduction
against ordinary income is particularly valuable. It can save a
high-income taxpayer roughly $1,140 in federal taxes each year versus
the $600 you'd save if that loss was used to simply offset capital
gains that would have been taxed at lower rates.</TE>
<TE>   * Carry losses forward to reduce future capital gains and income:</TE>
<TE>   Say you've offset all your capital gains, have $3,000 in losses to
offset ordinary income, and you still have losses left over. Now
what? Capital losses can be carried forward to offset future capital
gains--plus as much as $3,000 in ordinary income each year--until
they're used up, or you die, whichever comes first, Holthouse said.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers have been debating proposals that would raise the
maximum amount that taxpayers could write off against ordinary income
to as much as $20,000 annually, said Brenda Schafer, senior tax
research coordinator with H&amp;R Block in Kansas City, Mo.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not clear right now whether this legislation is going
anywhere," Schafer said. "But you wouldn't want to be in a big hurry
to trigger a gain to use up capital losses. If they do change that
limitation, you'd be wishing you hadn't done that."</TE>
<TE>   * Special rules for funds:</TE>
<TE>   If you invest primarily through mutual funds, there are a two
important tax-related issues to keep in mind.</TE>
<TE>   First, although funds are required to distribute annual realized
capital gains to shareholders, they aren't allowed to distribute
capital losses. If your fund, like most, is down for the year, the
only way to realize that loss is to sell the fund.</TE>
<TE>   Second, remember that determining your net gain or loss on a fund
you've owned for several years usually isn't as simple as comparing
the amount of money you invested in the fund with what it's worth
now. In years when your fund made money, you probably received a
capital gains distribution from the fund and paid tax on it. If
you've held a fund for several years, you probably have already paid
taxes on a large chunk of the gains you may realize when you sell the
fund.</TE>
<TE>   * Consider the "deemed sale" election:</TE>
<TE>   There's a little known "election" that taxpayers can make until
Oct. 15 of this year. It essentially allows you to pretend to sell a
stock that you hold at a gain; pay the tax on the gain; and then
start the clock running on the holding period again. Why would you do
that? Because if you hold the asset for five years after the
so-called deemed sale, you would reduce the maximum capital gain tax
on that asset to 18% from 20%. In other words, for every $1,000 in
gains earned on that stock after the deemed sale, you would save $20
in federal tax.</TE>
<TE>   Deemed sales cannot be used to trigger a loss, tax officials say.
The option is a one-time-only election that was created five years
ago in an obscure capital gains law that provided lower capital gains
tax rates for long-held assets. Because the new rate applied only to
assets acquired after Jan. 1, 2001, legislators wanted to give people
who had held stocks for decades the chance to get this lower rate on
stock they continued to own. Thus, they created the deemed sale
election.</TE>
<TE>   Still, unless you have such huge capital losses that you're
certain you couldn't use them up in your lifetime, it doesn't make a
lot of sense to trigger a gain to offset a capital loss that might
come in handy later, Holthouse said.</TE>
<TE>   On this issue, and others, it might be best to consult a tax
advisor.</TE>

<HD>Time to Work on Strategy, Not Guess the Market</HD>
<DH>It's never too late to make sure you aren't violating the
cardinal rules of investing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What do I do now?</LD>
<LD>   That question is on the minds of many investors these days as the
bear market trashes portfolios and lays waste to dreams of early
retirement, vacation homes and high-priced college educations.</LD>
<LD>   After 2 1/2 years of falling stock prices, it's clearly too late
to make amends for errors made during the giddy days of the bull
market. Investors who put all of their money in technology stocks, or
thought bonds were too boring, even when investing for short-term
goals, already have paid the price.</LD>
<TE>   And trying to guess where the market is headed from here will set
the stage for disappointment. The market has rallied several times
since its March 2000 peak--most recently after a sharp sell-off in
July--only to fall to fresh lows, trapping investors who jumped into
stocks thinking the turnaround had arrived.</TE>
<TE>   But paralysis isn't an option either. In these tough times, it's
more important than ever to make sure you aren't violating some of
the cardinal rules of investing:</TE>
<TE>   * Match assets with goals:</TE>
<TE>   Make sure your money is invested in ways that match what you plan
to do with it. Money for goals that need to be financed within five
years--purchasing a house, paying college expenses, etc.--should be
invested in short-term assets that are high on liquidity and low on
volatility. That means money market accounts, short-term bonds or
certificates of deposit that mature before the money is needed.</TE>
<TE>   Medium-term goals, which you expect to fund in five to 10 years,
should be financed with a fairly conservative mixture of fixed-income
and equity investments.</TE>
<TE>   Long-term goals--those 10 years or more in the future--can be
financed with a diversified portfolio that has a majority of the
assets in stocks. Even long-term investors need to assess their
appetite for risk, however. Some people can't stomach steep losses,
even if they don't plan to cash in the investments for years.</TE>
<TE>   * Diversify:</TE>
<TE>   It's tempting to go from being all in stocks to being all in bonds
and other low-risk options. But every portfolio needs a mix of
assets, at all times.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, putting money into different asset classes isn't enough.
Make sure you've got a spectrum of investments in each major class.
For instance, diversify within your stock portfolio by buying either
a well-rounded group of mutual funds (or index funds) or by buying
stocks in a wide array of industries and with both U.S. and overseas
business.</TE>
<TE>   Diversify within your bond portfolio by mixing conservative assets
such as government bonds or municipals with more volatile securities,
such as corporate bonds and mortgage-backed securities.</TE>
<TE>   Although trying to time the market isn't advisable, keep in mind
that interest rates are at 40-year lows. Long-term bonds generally
fall in value when interest rates rise, so it may not be the best
time to load up on them unless you plan to hold them to maturity.</TE>
<TE>   * Rebalance:</TE>
<TE>   The natural ebb and flow of investment returns is certain to throw
off even the most logically formulated investment plan.</TE>
<TE>   Check how much money you have in each asset class in your
portfolio at least once a year. If high returns on bonds--or low
returns on stocks--have thrown your investment mix off kilter, shift
money between asset classes to restore the balance.</TE>
<TE>   People who did that in 1999 probably sold stocks and bought bonds
and look like geniuses today. Rebalancing now probably will entail
trimming bonds and buying stocks.</TE>

<HD>A Need for Stability Gives Dividends Renewed Luster</HD>
<DH>Yields may not be high, but during a deep bear market they
can cushion stock funds' losses and attract investors seeking a
regular income stream.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When it comes to dividends on stocks, the market's motto has evolved
since 2000 from "cash is trash" to "show me the money."</LD>
<LD>   With every major market index deep in the red year-to-date, stocks
that pay dividends have come back into vogue--not only for the modest
cushion provided by steady cash income, but also for the
conservative, old-fashioned image these companies portray in a
back-to-basics environment.</LD>
<LD>   The income that dividends provide has helped bolster relative
performance at conservative equity funds this year such as Fidelity
Growth &amp; Income, Vanguard Windsor II and Mairs &amp; Power Growth, which
are down 22.4%, 21.3% and 14.8%, respectively--in each case better
than the funds' category averages.</LD>
<TE>   Still, while dividend income may be getting trendy once again with
individual stocks, it probably isn't a major focus for investors who
are evaluating their current equity funds or looking for new ones,
analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   And fund companies primarily market other sorts of products,
including bond funds and real estate-oriented funds, to investors who
are specifically seeking a regular income stream. Most fund companies
don't play up a general stock fund's dividend returns.</TE>
<TE>   As for investors, there are several reasons dividend-paying stock
funds haven't attracted more attention, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index had recorded five
straight years of gains in excess of 20% during the market surge of
1995-99, cash dividends had become an afterthought for many
investors. Earning a 2% to 4% annual yield from dividends in that
environment seemed almost irrelevant.</TE>
<TE>   "When market returns are high no one cares about dividends," said
Phil Edwards, chief fund analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, in a deep bear market, dividends' relative importance in
diversified funds also is, well, relative. For many investors, the
pain of loss isn't much different if a fund is down 20% because there
is no dividend buffer, versus a loss of 18% with that buffer.</TE>
<TE>   Many fund investors also dislike the tax implications of dividend
income. Most fund owners choose to automatically reinvest, in more
fund shares, any dividends their funds pay. So they don't get a
check--but they owe taxes nonetheless, unless their fund is held in a
tax-deferred retirement account.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to pay taxes on dividend income, and when the overall
market is down the investor isn't at all happy about that," Edwards
said.</TE>
<TE>   Those looking specifically for a current income stream and willing
to accept the tax bite are likely to focus on real estate funds,
government bond funds or others that offer greater income than the
typical dividend-paying stock fund, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think you can really look to equity funds for income.
It's not like the old days, when a lot of stocks were paying 6%"
dividends, said Sheldon Jacobs, editor of No-Load Fund Investor
newsletter in Ardsley, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if there's a 2% annual yield on a fund, the price
fluctuations are going to overwhelm whatever the income may be," he
said. Also, investors who want quarterly income checks from their
stock funds need to choose carefully: Some funds pay out dividends
just once a year.</TE>
<TE>   George Mairs, longtime manager of Mairs &amp; Power Growth, based in
St. Paul, Minn., notes that before the modern era of growth-stock
investing that began in the 1960s, typically half or more of the
average annual returns on stocks came from cash dividends (the rest
was price appreciation).</TE>
<TE>   Equities often offered a bigger income stream than bonds before
the 1960s, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll probably never get back to that situation, but the attitude
toward dividends is changing, and hopefully significantly," Mairs
said.</TE>
<TE>   The S&amp;P 500's dividend yield, which bottomed at 1.1% in March 2000
at the end of the bull market, has risen gradually since then, said
Arnold Kaufman, editor of S&amp;P Outlook, a newsletter for investors.
But the current 1.9% yield is far shy of the index's 4.2% average
since 1926 and the 3.8% average since 1945.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Kaufman said he is sensing "a turning point for
dividends." Among the 7,500 stocks that S&amp;P tracks, 299 raised their
dividends in the third quarter as the market sank, up from 226 in the
same period a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   "Dividend-paying stocks have been outperforming the non-dividend
payers. They're something of a safe harbor in a bear market," Kaufman
said. "Companies that pay dividends tend to be more conservative, and
investors are more interested in conservative companies right now."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, not even a high dividend yield can fully protect a
stock if the company's fundamentals weaken. Philip Morris Cos. stock,
a favorite of many value-style investors, has plunged from $51 in
mid-August to under $37, after the company warned of slowing earnings
growth and amid more jury verdicts against tobacco firms in
cigarette-liability cases.</TE>
<TE>   Morris' annualized dividend yield has risen from 5% in mid-August
to 7% as the share price has tumbled, but that may be little
consolation to investors who bought at $51 and have lost 28% of their
capital, on paper.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Mairs said he hopes investors continue to perceive value in
cash dividend income.</TE>
<TE>   "What shareholders should do is go to the annual meetings and
suggest that the dividends be raised," Mairs said. "Hopefully
everybody will start clapping and something will happen."</TE>
<TE>   One argument for managements to return more profit directly to
shareholders via dividends is that many of the big corporate mergers
of the 1990s have been disasters. Also, companies' use of cash to
repurchase their own shares has run into the same trouble many
individual investors have faced: share prices just keep falling.</TE>
<TE>   These factors could contribute to a renewed appreciation for
higher dividend payments, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards said stock funds that long had been known as equity-income
funds "were dying in the late 1990s, but what saved them was the
downturn in the market," bringing so-called value investing back into
style. One of the hallmarks of value stocks is an above-average
dividend yield.</TE>
<TE>   Vanguard Windsor II, for example, is among the "steady-Eddie type
of funds" that have provided solid long-term returns and also avoided
the worst of the bear market thanks to its value approach, Edwards
said.</TE>
<TE>   It's no stampede, but income-paying funds are one of the few
categories tracked by Lipper Inc. that have reaped cash inflows from
investors in recent months, said Don Cassidy, senior analyst with
Lipper Inc. in Denver.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly there is a preference for the conservative these days,"
Cassidy said. "The investing world is upside down from where it was
three years ago.... The psychology has changed because people are not
buying on hope anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Mairs, who has been with Mairs &amp; Power since 1952 and has run the
fund since 1980, said he long has favored stocks that pay dividends.
"Their presence provides stability" in a portfolio, he said.</TE>
<TE>   One of Mairs &amp; Power Growth's biggest holdings and best-performing
stocks this year is Wells Fargo &amp; Co. The bank has a tradition of
raising dividends every nine months. The stock was up 10.8% in the
first three quarters. Its annualized dividend yield is about 2.5% at
the current share price.</TE>
<TE>   Two holdings Mairs and co-manager William Frels have added to the
portfolio this year are General Electric Co. and Merck &amp; Co. The
classic growth stocks, which got cheap enough for Mairs' taste this
year, now sport yields of 3% and 3.2%, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Those aren't the 6% dividend yields that some market veterans
fondly remember, but they're a buffer against share price declines,
Mairs said.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, if predictions of single-digit annual average gains on
stocks hold true in coming years as the market struggles to recover,
even 2% or 3% dividend yields could make a big difference in overall
returns.</TE>

<HD>Standout Funds Find Success by Sticking to the Basics</HD>
<DH>They may not have soared with the bull, but a few managers
say their consistent methodology is why their portfolios are relative
bright spots.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a market so dreary that only 3% of stock mutual funds are in the
black this year, a strong performance by a portfolio manager may just
be relative.</LD>
<LD>   Funds that have eked out modest gains this year, or posted losses
much smaller than their category average, arguably are doing a more
impressive job for shareholders than those that simply rode the
tailwinds of the 1990s bull market to lofty gains, some analysts say.</LD>
<LD>   The other possibility is that some funds just got lucky.</LD>
<TE>   One small-cap value fund whose performance has stood out this year
is Royce Special Equity, which rose 8.7% in the first three quarters.
Being a "dyed-in-the-wool balance sheet skeptic" has helped manager
Charlie Dreifus steer clear of landmines, said Morningstar Inc.
analyst Shannon Zimmerman.</TE>
<TE>   New York-based Dreifus said his stock-picking starts with a search
for strong, undervalued businesses. Screening for firms with high
return on capital leads him to solid business niches, he said. Then,
his assessment of a company's takeover value based on the sum of its
parts tells him whether the share price is a bargain, Dreifus said.</TE>
<TE>   But the most important research is poring over financial
statements in a search for "accounting purity," he said. It's a task
Dreifus relished long before this year's avalanche of accounting
scandals, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's my way of requiring companies to portray the economic
reality. If you're going to the library to look at the company's
financial statements, they should be in the nonfiction section."</TE>
<TE>   Dreifus can sound a bit like Shirley MacLaine when he sums up his
methods: "It sounds rather strange but financial statements talk to
me," he said. The filings of fewer than one in 10 companies that he
reads give him enough comfort to invest, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The financials are a mosaic, a puzzle that comes together,"
Dreifus said. Pieces of the puzzle that might not sit right with him
include changes in research spending or provisions for doubtful
accounts--numbers that might be massaged as a firm stretches to meet
its quarterly financial goals.</TE>
<TE>   Other things he watches for include potential dilution from stock
options, joint ventures with unspecified partners and
asset-depreciation schedules longer than the industry standard.</TE>
<TE>   Dreifus said he sometimes undertakes another form of "detective
work" to check on a company's frugality: "I'll drive around the
[company] parking lot looking for cars with sequential license
plates, a leased fleet," he said. "Are we looking at a multitude of
Mercedeses or Ford Tauruses? You can guess which I'd rather see."</TE>
<TE>   Dreifus, who described his portfolio as filled with "mundane
businesses," acknowledges that his cheapskate investing style has not
always fared so well. In the go-go market of 1999 his fund lost
9.6%--dismal even for the then out-of-favor small-value category.</TE>
<TE>   "I was totally out of sync with that market," Dreifus said. "It
made no sense to me."</TE>
<TE>   His recent holdings have included casual shoemaker K Swiss Inc.,
restaurant chain Bob Evans Farms and everyday gift maker Russ Berrie
&amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-cap value fund category, the Yacktman and Yacktman
Focused funds, which lost 1.9% and gained 0.6%, respectively, in the
first three quarters, were relative bright spots. Both funds are run
by Buffalo Grove, Ill.-based Donald Yacktman, who like Dreifus
champions a back-to-basics value-oriented approach.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a methodology we've consistently stuck with," Yacktman
said. "In 1999 we looked dumb, and now we look brilliant. That's the
nature of this business."</TE>
<TE>   Yacktman said his portfolio generally lacks "the kind of stocks
everyone likes to talk about at the cocktail hour." One of his
holdings, for example, is Lancaster Colony Corp., which is in such
disparate businesses as specialty foods and truck splash guards.</TE>
<TE>   But he also has taken a chance on beaten-up stocks such as Liberty
Media Corp. in the broadcasting sector; conglomerate Tyco
International Ltd., which Yacktman believes was oversold this summer
in the wake of fraud allegations against its former chief executive;
and the bonds of Qwest Communications International Inc., the
beleaguered telecom firm that Yacktman believes can be viable under
its new management.</TE>
<TE>   In the large-cap value category, the team-managed Clipper fund is
among this year's relative performance leaders, with a loss of 13.1%
in three quarters compared with a 25% drop for its category average.</TE>
<TE>   The fund has consistently avoided some of the weakest areas of the
market, such as technology and telecom, said Bruce Veaco, one of five
managers who steer Beverly Hills-based Clipper.</TE>
<TE>   One of the keys to successful value investing is determining
whether stocks are cheap for good reason, Veaco said. "We look at
sectors or stocks that are out of favor and try to determine, 'Is the
concern justified?' " he said. "We looked at the telecom industry,
for instance, and said, 'Hmmm, these concerns are justified.' All the
overspending of the late 1990s will take more time to work off."</TE>
<TE>   But in July, the Clipper crew found several companies in other
industries that met its main criterion for purchase: A discount of at
least 30% to the managers' estimate of the stock's "intrinsic value."
The fund, which had held about 30% of assets in cash over the last
several years, spent that down to about 10%, Veaco said.</TE>
<TE>   Clipper added drug stocks Pfizer Inc., Merck &amp; Co. and Wyeth,
believing the shares were oversold because of investor concerns about
weak product pipelines and possible government price controls.</TE>
<TE>   Clipper also has added to holdings in grocery chains Safeway Inc.
and Kroger Co., which have tumbled on worries over recent earnings
weakness and competition from Wal-Mart Stores Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Like all stock-pickers, the Clipper managers have made mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   Veaco said McDonald's Corp., which the fund bought last year, is
more of a troubled business than the managers realized. Clipper has
revised its intrinsic per-share value estimate for the firm to $30
from $40, he said. But with the stock now around $18, "We're not even
thinking about selling it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   For growth-fund investors, managers who have held this year's
losses to less than 15% may look like heroes, relatively speaking.</TE>
<TE>   In the large-cap growth sector, Chase Growth, managed by Derwood
Chase, has limited its year-to-date loss to 9.1%, versus 30.9% for
the category average. Marsico Focus, whose manager, Tom Marsico,
helped build the Janus funds into an industry powerhouse in the
1990s, is down 14.1%.</TE>
<TE>   Small-cap growth funds that have held up well include Hennessy
Cornerstone Growth, whose manager, Neil Hennessy, uses a
computer-driven model to pick stocks; Neuberger Berman Fasciano, run
by Michael Fasciano; and Baron Growth, run by Ron Baron. These funds
are down 6%, 9.4% and 12.1%, respectively, versus the category
average of 31.4%.</TE>

<HD>Value Funds Falter in Race With Growth</HD>
<DH>As price-to-earnings gap between the sectors narrows, some
analysts now see good buying opportunities among trampled growth
funds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Is "value" style investing still in charge on Wall Street?</LD>
<LD>   Value-oriented stock mutual funds are en route to their third
straight calendar year of superior performance compared with "growth"
funds. But value's margin of leadership has thinned in a stock market
where almost nothing seems to work.</LD>
<LD>   Large-cap value funds fell 18.3% in the third quarter, on average,
leaving the category down 25% for the year, according to data from
Morningstar Inc.</LD>
<TE>   By contrast, large-cap growth funds are down 30.9% for the year
after an average loss of 15.8% in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Small-cap value funds, once a haven from the bear market, are down
15.5% for the year, on average. That's still far better than the
31.4% average loss for small-cap growth funds, but the two categories
suffered nearly equal losses in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Growth funds typically focus on stocks of companies whose sales
and earnings are expected to grow at a faster pace than the average
company's over the long run. That includes many technology firms.</TE>
<TE>   Value funds, on the other hand, try to follow the "buy low, sell
high" maxim, favoring shares that offer some element of value--a
below-average price-to-earnings ratio, for example, or an
above-average dividend yield.</TE>
<TE>   But these days, with the crash in many growth stocks, it can be
hard to tell growth from value using measures such as P/Es.</TE>
<TE>   The gap in average P/Es between growth and value stocks, which
peaked in June 2000 at the end of the bull market, has narrowed
substantially, said Daniel Seitz, senior analyst at Instinet Research
in New York. With the gap now smaller than usual, the downside for
growth stocks may be limited even if they are not ready to recover as
a group, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Other analysts argue that the shaky global economy could continue
to work against growth stocks, just as an improving economy fueled
their dominance from 1998 through early 2000, before the pendulum
swung sharply to value when the technology bubble burst and the
economy began to careen toward recession.</TE>
<TE>   Growth-stock critics also say that even with the technology-heavy
Nasdaq composite index down more than 77% from its 2000 peak, the
growth sector may not be sufficiently washed out. On many stocks,
P/Es still are higher than usual for a bear market bottom.</TE>
<TE>   For long-term investors, however, there may be buying
opportunities these days among downtrodden growth funds, many Wall
Street pros say.</TE>
<TE>   If investors learned anything from the last few years, they say,
it should be that markets are cyclical. The time to buy growth funds
such as Harbor Capital Appreciation or Turner Midcap Growth,
growth-stock fans say, is when they're out of favor, not when they're
flying high. Those two funds--down 32.9% and 37.1%, respectively, in
the first three quarters--clearly are out of favor.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of where the market is headed, many financial advisors
say the hard-to-read economy shows why it makes sense to hold a mix
of growth and value funds rather than make a bold bet one way or the
other.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty difficult to get that timing down," said Mark Mallon,
who recently was appointed chief investment officer at American
Century, the Kansas City, Mo.-based mutual fund company. "That's why
we would advise people that it always makes sense to have some eggs
in each basket."</TE>
<TE>   Over the long haul, growth and value styles have performed roughly
equally, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Though data now show value with bigger gains historically, either
sector's performance can be skewed "when you stop the clock" after a
particularly good, or bad, run of a few years, Mallon said.</TE>
<TE>   A recent survey by American Century found that although most
investors don't firmly grasp the differences between growth and value
stocks, 68% understand that diversifying across both styles helps to
stabilize a portfolio over time.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some say there may be a good old-fashioned reason for
patient investors to now tilt portfolios slightly toward growth: It's
the most out of favor.</TE>
<TE>   "I might skew a little toward growth right now, but that doesn't
mean I expect it to take off tomorrow," said Phil Edwards, chief fund
analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards said Harbor Capital Appreciation, Turner Midcap Growth and
ABN AMRO/Veredus Aggressive Growth (which lost 42% in the first three
quarters) are examples of growth funds with decent long-term records
that might fare well if and when the economy looks like it's in a
sustained recovery. In 1999, as the market roared, those funds gained
46%, 126% and 113%, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   When the economy rebounds decisively, growth funds would seem to
be the natural beneficiaries, Edwards said. Harbor Capital
Appreciation showed a glimpse of that potential during the market's
short-lived rally in the fourth quarter of 2001, zooming 25.9%, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, analysts urge investors to proceed with caution whichever
way they lean.</TE>
<TE>   "The worldwide and domestic economies are so soft, I have a hard
time making the case that growth runs away from value at this point,"
said Don Cassidy, senior analyst at fund tracker Lipper Inc. in
Denver.</TE>
<TE>   One of the biggest problems for the market in recent weeks has
been the spate of corporate earnings warnings, dashing hopes for a
profit resurgence.</TE>
<TE>   Some are more emphatically anti-growth. "In short, your children
will curse the day you became a growth investor," wrote Richard
Young, editor of the newsletter Young's Intelligence Report, in a
recent article, "The Case Against Growth Stocks."</TE>
<TE>   Young noted that the Dow Jones industrials, "the Nasdaq of the
1920s," sank 89% before bottoming out, and that Japan's Nikkei index,
"the Nasdaq of the 1980s," has languished for more than a decade and
recently hit a 19-year low.</TE>
<TE>   "The only law of growth stocks is that they thrive in a condition
of certainty and optimism," Young wrote. "After all, would you have
taken a chance on Cisco [Systems] or AOL at the height of their
valuations in the late 1990s if the economy were in doubt, or Wall
Street and corporate America showed they couldn't be trusted?"</TE>
<TE>   Mallon said his best guess is that growth and value stocks may
alternate in leadership over the next few years. "This year it's more
a story of where we are in the economic recovery," he said. "Is the
economy going to recover or fall back into a 'double dip' recession?
It's a difficult question."</TE>
<TE>   Growth stocks could get a bounce soon from being "oversold,"
Mallon said, but that could be based more on technical market chart
patterns than company fundamentals.</TE>
<TE>   "In the very short term, it wouldn't surprise us if growth had a
little run versus value. Over the next couple of years value could
regain the edge, then maybe they'd move onto similar footing. If we
got back into an expansion in the economy, then growth could assert
itself later in the cycle. That would be a fairly typical pattern."</TE>

<HD>High-Quality Bonds Shine in Rush to Safety</HD>
<DH>But with Treasury yields at generational lows, the big
question is whether they are primed for a rebound, which would send
prices down.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the bond market, there was no substitute for quality in the third
quarter--continuing a trend that took hold in the spring.</LD>
<LD>   Mutual funds that focus on long-term U.S. government bonds racked
up strong returns in the quarter ended Sept. 30 as fearful investors
rushed into Treasury securities, pushing yields down to 40-year lows.</LD>
<LD>   That made older, higher-yielding bonds more valuable, driving
their prices up. The result was an average total return (price change
plus interest earned) of 7.9% for long-term government bond funds in
the quarter, according to Morningstar Inc.</LD>
<TE>   Other high-quality bond categories also benefited from investors'
hunger for relative safety, as stocks fell to multiyear lows, the
economic recovery appeared to falter and President Bush threatened
war with Iraq. Municipal bond funds and investment-grade corporate
bond funds generated total returns in the 2% to 5.5% range in the
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   As usual in a period of falling market interest rates, longer-term
bonds performed better than shorter-term issues.</TE>
<TE>   In general, bonds continued to shine at stocks' expense. Most bond
fund categories gained 5% to 12% in the nine months, according to
Morningstar.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, the average domestic stock mutual fund plummeted
26.7% in the period.</TE>
<TE>   In the three years ended Sept. 30, government bond funds produced
an average annual return of 8.4%, while stock funds lost 8.5% a year
in the same period, Morningstar said.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds' healthy returns during stocks' long bear market have taught
many investors an important, if belated, lesson about the wisdom of
portfolio diversification.</TE>
<TE>   But with Treasury bond yields at generational lows--the 10-year
T-note yield was at 3.67% on Friday, down from 5.05% at the start of
the year--the big question now is whether yields are primed to
rebound over the next year. If that happens, bond prices would sink
and bond fund returns could go negative.</TE>
<TE>   Many bond market pros are worried by what they say has been almost
panicked buying of Treasuries in recent months. "Extreme bullish bond
sentiment," read the headline on a report last week from investment
firm Bridgewater Associates Inc. in Wilton, Conn.</TE>
<TE>   The fear is that yields could whiplash if economic data begin to
point to a sustained recovery and/or if the United States decides
against going to war with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, experts note that some of the demand for high-quality
bonds in recent months has been tied to technical factors. For
example, the surge in mortgage refinancings has led to earlier
payoffs of mortgage-backed bonds, driving some portfolio managers and
traders to lock in yields on Treasury bonds instead.</TE>
<TE>   That demand could dry up if market interest rates begin to
rebound.</TE>
<TE>   Noting the large cash inflows into bond mutual funds in recent
months, some market pros fear that investors are loading up at what
could be the low point for bond yields for years to come.</TE>
<TE>   "Big flows happen at market extremes," said John Mousseau, a
municipal bond portfolio manager at Cumberland Advisors in Vineland,
N.J. "Which is why, on a big-picture basis, we're constructive on
equities and very cautious on bonds," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, analysts note that warnings about bonds, particularly
Treasury issues, have been rampant for months but the market
continues to rally.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone believes the Treasury buying is overdone, but it shows
you there is nearly zero risk appetite, and I don't see that
unwinding," said Gregory Peters, a credit strategist at brokerage
Morgan Stanley in New York.</TE>
<TE>   What could keep bond yields at current levels into 2003, or drive
them even lower? If the economy weakens, forcing the Federal Reserve
to cut short-term interest rates again, high-quality bonds almost
certainly would benefit, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   War with Iraq also could increase demand for safe-haven
securities. Likewise, if the stock market continues to tumble,
high-quality bonds may be the natural beneficiaries.</TE>
<TE>   But with Treasury bond yields at such low levels, many long-term
investors probably will be looking at other, higher-yielding
securities--especially investment-grade corporate bonds and tax-free
municipal bonds, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think in three years you will see rates lower than they
are now," said Joe Jackson, who helps invest $3 billion for BB&amp;T
Asset Management in Raleigh, N.C. Even so, at current yields,
"high-quality corporates look like a very attractive place over the
longer term," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Corporate bond mutual fund managers, however, have to be careful
in their bond-picking, given the number of big-name firms that have
spiraled into bankruptcy protection over the last year--such as Enron
Corp., WorldCom Inc. and Adelphia Communications Corp.</TE>
<TE>   "You really have to scrub the names and buy something you're
comfortable with," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   Quality concerns are less pronounced in the municipal bond market,
where defaults are far rarer. That has helped stoke demand for muni
issues, even though yields have dropped sharply this year.</TE>
<TE>   A Moody's Investors Service index of high-quality 10-year
municipal bonds yielded an annualized 3.4% as of last week, down from
4.5% at the start of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Because muni yields are tax-exempt, the true returns are higher. A
California muni bond yielding 3.4% would be equivalent to a fully
taxable bond yielding 5.35% for a California investor in the combined
36.5% federal and state combined tax bracket (for married couples,
that bracket begins at taxable income of about $113,000).</TE>
<TE>   With 10-year Treasury yields at 3.67%, a true yield of 5.35% on a
10-year muni is considerably more attractive, analysts note.</TE>
<TE>   The segment of the bond market that continues to vex many
investors is the corporate junk-bond sector. The average junk bond
mutual fund lost 3.6% in the third quarter and is down 7.3% year to
date, according to Morningstar.</TE>
<TE>   Soaring default rates among junk issuers have kept many investors
away from the sector, despite yields that are near 10-year highs.</TE>
<TE>   "Investors seem to be on strike against any assets perceived to
carry a high risk premium," said Kingman Penniman, head of high-yield
research firm KDP Investment Advisors Inc. in Montpelier, Vt. KDP's
index of 100 junk issues now yields 11.98%.</TE>
<TE>   If and when the economy is shown to be in a sustained
recovery--and stock prices with it--junk bonds should rally, bond
market pros say. But when that will happen is still an open question.</TE>
<TE>   Because many junk-bond-issuing companies will need to raise
capital in the stock market in the long run, "in order for high-yield
to perform, the stock market has to be at least stable, if not
strong," said Brendan White, a senior portfolio manager who invests
$1.1 billion for Fort Washington Investment Advisors in Cincinnati.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For many investors, this year has been about not investing.</LD>
<LD>   More than $2.2 trillion in cash sits in money market mutual funds.
That is approaching the $2.7-trillion value of all stock mutual
funds, according to the Investment Company Institute, the funds'
chief trade group.</LD>
<LD>   More striking has been the buildup of cash in basic bank savings
accounts. Americans have pumped a net $360 billion into savings
accounts this year, and a total of $900 billion has flowed in since
March 2000, when the stock market peaked, according to the Federal
Reserve Bank of St. Louis.</LD>
<TE>   At $2.67 trillion now, the savings account total dwarfs the
$1.06-trillion value of all bond mutual funds.</TE>
<TE>   There also is far more in savings accounts than in small
(under-$100,000) bank certificates of deposit. Small CDs hold about
$900 billion, Federal Reserve data show. Savers have been reluctant
to lock up their money in CDs at current rates, preferring instead to
have ready access to their cash.</TE>
<TE>   With the Fed keeping short-term interest rates at 40-year lows,
investors are earning next to nothing on cash accounts, of course.
The seven-day average annualized simple yield on taxable money market
funds was 1.25% as of last week, according to fund-tracker IMoneyNet
Inc. That is down from 1.6% at the start of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Many money funds and many bank savings accounts are yielding less
than 1%. After accounting for taxes owed on that interest, and the
rate of inflation, the real return on cash accounts is zero or
slightly negative. And most economists believe there is little
prospect of short-term rates rising soon, given the still-struggling
economy.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, a zero return on cash accounts has been more appealing to
many Americans than the idea of losing another significant sum in the
stock market.</TE>

<HD>Guide to Morningstar's Top-Rated Funds</HD>
<DH>The research company's 'star' system, revamped midyear,
ranks mutual funds relative to those with similar investment goals
over a three-year period.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With more than 10,000 mutual funds to choose from, many investors
cringe at the task of making selections.</LD>
<LD>   In this quarterly report, The Times and independent research firm
Morningstar Inc. provide several ways to evaluate funds--including
measurements designed to help investors determine a fund's
performance relative to that of its peers using Morningstar's
revamped "star" system.</LD>
<LD>   The tables on the next several pages list the best-performing
funds in each of Morningstar's major fund categories over the last
three years (ended Sept. 30), as determined by the firm's proprietary
rating system. That system weighs returns against the risk a fund
took, as implied by its volatility.</LD>
<TE>   The three-year period includes the end of the bull market surge of
1999 and early 2000 as well as the bear market that began in March
2000. Only funds with three years of history are included.</TE>
<TE>   In a bear market, "good" performance can be relative, of course.
Here's how the funds were ranked:</TE>
<TE>   * First, each fund has an overall star ranking (5 stars is best, 1
is worst) based on its risk-adjusted performance versus its peers in
48 fund categories, as measured over several periods (three, five and
10 years, as applicable). This marks a recent change for Morningstar,
which until midyear had based its star ratings on performance within
a broad class of funds, such as domestic equity or municipal bond.</TE>
<TE>   According to Morningstar, the new system is fairer because it
measures a fund's performance against that of others with the same
investment goals. Now, funds are graded on a bell curve within each
category, so the comparisons are "apples to apples," according to
Morningstar.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new system, more than half of the funds in Morningstar's
universe gained or lost stars at midyear. For example, in the
large-cap growth category, American Funds' Growth Fund of America
gained a fifth star, as did large-cap blend fund Fidelity Growth &amp;
Income. Conversely, several small-cap value funds have lost stars.</TE>
<TE>   * Second, within each overall rating score (i.e., first the 5s,
then the 4s, etc.) funds are ranked by actual three-year performance
within the category as a whole, expressed as a percentile figure (1
to 100, with 1 being best). That is the "three-year rank" column.</TE>
<TE>   For funds with multiple classes (i.e., A and B shares, etc.), only
the best-performing class is included.</TE>
<TE>   To determine order, ties in the first two columns were broken by
manager tenure.</TE>
<TE>   * Next, a secondary, three-year star rating appears in the third
column, assessing a fund's performance based solely on the trailing
three-year period, a span that many financial analysts use to get a
snapshot of performance in recent years. The number of stars (again,
on a scale of 1 through 5, with 5 being the best) is an assessment of
performance and level of risk for that fund compared with its peer
group: small-cap value, for example, or large-cap growth.</TE>
<TE>   Funds that are less than 5 years old will have the same overall
and three-year ratings, but older funds (whose overall ratings are
based on a weighted average of the different periods) may have
different three-year and overall star ratings.</TE>
<TE>   A word about categories:</TE>
<TE>   Morningstar does not categorize funds based solely on a fund's
self-description. Rather, it also looks at each fund's actual
holdings to determine category.</TE>
<TE>   The largest groups of funds are domestic equity funds, which
Morningstar organizes by the average size (market capitalization) of

<HD>Bank Sector Hit by String of Negative Earnings Reports</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: An index of financial stocks drops almost 10%
in a week as borrowers fall behind on loan payments.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For evidence of Wall Street's touchiness about the state of corporate
earnings, look no further than the banking industry.</LD>
<LD>   Negative earnings announcements from a string of banking companies
last week slammed stocks in the sector, pushing an index of financial
stocks down almost 10% for the week and adding steam to the market's
downward momentum.</LD>
<LD>   The latest blows came Friday, when New Orleans' Hibernia Corp. and
Chicago's Northern Trust Corp. said third-quarter profits would be
lower than analysts expected, two days after similar warnings from
Detroit's Comerica Inc. and Bank of New York Co. Shares of Hibernia
and Northern Trust both lost more than 5%, and all 52 members of
Bloomberg's index of U.S. bank stocks lost ground--a troubling
reversal for a sector that reported record earnings in 2001.</LD>
<TE>   Slower-than-expected economic growth has been a primary cause of
the recent profit shortfalls as borrowers fall behind on loan
payments. For instance, Comerica, a well-regarded business bank with
a large presence in California, said it added more than $200 million
to its loan loss reserves. Of the stocks in the Bloomberg index,
Comerica had the worst week, with a 24.16% decline.</TE>
<TE>   Regulators have been pressing regional bankers to add to reserves
for bad loans, as Comerica was forced to do on its lending to
independent filmmakers. That has created fears of more widespread
troubles, especially since rising mortgage delinquencies, home
foreclosures and other indicators are revealing that consumers may be
less able to provide a crutch for the economy.</TE>
<TE>   Comerica's announcement, especially, seemed "to be the beginning
of the reassessment to the negative" among investors in regional bank
stocks, research firm CreditSights warned investors last week.</TE>
<TE>   The pressure to increase reserves may make banks even more
cautious in commercial lending, said analyst Michael Mayo at
Prudential Securities, who has "sell" recommendations on five of the
18 banks he covers. The Federal Reserve has reported seven straight
quarters in which banks have tightened their lending requirements.</TE>
<TE>   Despite that, a Fed report to Congress last month said there is
little evidence that creditworthy borrowers are having trouble
getting loans. Lending to smaller businesses--the backbone of the
California economy--held up better than to large companies.</TE>
<TE>   Other big losers last week included banks that earn large fees for
credit cards, for managing trusts and investments and for processing
securities transactions. Among these were Bank of New York, down
21.81%; Synovus Financial Corp. of Columbus, Ga., down 17.15%;
Northern Trust, down 15.6%; and Mellon Financial Corp., down 13.2%.
By contrast, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index lost 3.2% for the week.</TE>
<TE>   "The fee-based banks had been doing great, but the market is
realizing that fee income won't be as strong as it thought," said
Bert Ely, an Alexandria, Va., banking consultant.</TE>
<TE>   The recent decline in bank stocks is a reversal of fortune for a
sector that had enjoyed some success in the months after the
terrorist attacks despite struggles at the biggest banks, Citigroup
Inc. and J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co., whose ties to corporate scandals
were under scrutiny even as their loans to major corporations went
south.</TE>
<TE>   The Fed's slashing of interest rates after the attacks allowed
banks to cut rates on deposits just as huge sums were flowing out of
the stock markets and into the safety of insured bank accounts. That
pool of cheap funds propped up earnings despite rising delinquencies
in commercial loans.</TE>
<TE>   But as talk of yet another Fed rate cut continues, there's no room
to push deposit rates lower, and many banks are seeing large lending
"spreads" shrink as their loan rates decline.</TE>
<TE>   "Interest rates going lower is not good for us," James Hance, Bank
of America Corp. chief financial officer, said in a recent interview.
"They're already too low. We would be better served profit-wise if
interest rates were higher, because the cost of funds can't go any
lower."</TE>
<TE>   Ely said the fall in bank stocks could allow San Francisco-based
Wells Fargo &amp; Co. to expand to the East Coast by acquiring weaker
institutions. Wells is one of the few banks whose shares are still in
the black for the year--up 3.7% as of Friday.</TE>

<HD>Improprieties by Some Contributors Cause Concern Among
Nonprofits</HD>
<DH>Philanthropy: Bad publicity and the prospect of returning
'unclean' donations could compound effects of a slow economy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAUREN WEBER</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Good corporate deeds suddenly aren't looking quite so good.</LD>
<LD>   Recent disclosures about the charitable giving habits of L. Dennis
Kozlowski, the former Tyco International Ltd. chief executive who has
been accused of stealing company funds to make $43 million in
personal donations, have thrown corporate philanthropy under a harsh
spotlight.</LD>
<LD>   The charges against Kozlowski have brought nonprofit groups into
the swirl of scandal that is plaguing corporate America.</LD>
<TE>   As a result, some executives at nonprofit organizations worry that
corporations will tighten their charitable belts out of concern that
their every move will be scrutinized. This anxiety comes at a time
when corporate donations have already been hit hard by recession and
the swooning stock market.</TE>
<TE>   "Directors of companies are shaking in their boots," and they may
be reluctant to make large gifts, said Dick Bennett, executive
director of development at the Weatherhead School of Management at
Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. "Everyone's looking
over their shoulders."</TE>
<TE>   For nonprofit groups, the specter of bad publicity and the
possibility of having to return "unclean" contributions can create
internal crises and derail important projects.</TE>
<TE>   Now experts on philanthropy are asking how companies can prevent
the kinds of abuses that prosecutors say took place at Tyco.</TE>
<TE>   "Self-regulation doesn't appear to have worked very well,
especially in the CEO office," said Dwight Burlingame, associate
executive director of the Center on Philanthropy at the University of
Indiana. He suggests that companies send out annual reports on
corporate social responsibility, detailing their giving: "It creates
some transparency."</TE>
<TE>   CEOs frequently have significant influence over corporate giving,
but systems of checks and balances are needed so that donations don't
simply become ego-gratification vehicles for status-conscious
executives, Burlingame said. Philanthropy "should be a shared
responsibility with a corporate contributions committee."</TE>
<TE>   Warren Dennis, a corporate governance lawyer at Proskauer Rose,
says most companies already have systems to make sure donations are
clean. The test is the financial statements: "If it's legitimate," he
said, "it's in the books."</TE>
<TE>   Experts agree that corporate donations should benefit the
company--and, by extension, the shareholders--and not individual
executives or directors.</TE>
<TE>   "We expect that corporate contributions are in the interests of
stockholders rather than in the interests of the board," said Paul
Hodgson, senior research associate at the Corporate Library, a
corporate governance watchdog group.</TE>
<TE>   Hodgson and others, including nonprofit groups, say the whiff of
impropriety and the resulting scrutiny won't have a long-term effect
on charitable giving. And they agree that Kozlowski's alleged
behavior probably is atypical.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, "there'll be a temporary cautiousness on the part of
CEOs," said Ed Morgan, president of the Bowery Mission, a homeless
services organization in New York. "But it's going to be very, very
temporary and very mild."</TE>
<TE>   This could be bad news for organizations whose budgets already
have been hurt by the recent economic slowdown.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the screws will be tightened down even further because of
the governance issues," said Bennett of Case Western's Weatherhead
School.</TE>
<TE>   Weatherhead recently moved into the Peter B. Lewis Building, a
facility mostly financed by the chairman of Cleveland-based auto
insurer Progressive Corp. Lewis gave 60% of the funding for the
$61.7-million building.</TE>
<TE>   Bennett said he was confident that Lewis' money, and that of other
corporate donors, came from clean and appropriate sources. The Lewis
donation came from the executive's personal foundation and a
foundation in his parents' names.</TE>
<TE>   Still, many executives at nonprofit organizations stress the
economy as more of a concern than the remote possibility that
donations are tainted by scandal or that donor companies will
collapse.</TE>
<TE>   Even Bennett cites economic concerns when discussing a campaign
Weatherhead launched this year to increase the school's endowment to
$200 million from $80 million. Corporations are a major part of that
goal, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm feeling it's a stretch goal, but I'm also an optimist," he
said. "I think eventually things will turn a bit on the economic
side."</TE>
<TE>   Joe Ptacek, a fund-raiser with Mercy Housing, a national builder
of affordable housing, said: "The Tyco issues and the corporate
philandering won't affect giving. It'll be the economy at large."</TE>

<HD>Princess Cruises Considers Bids by Royal Caribbean,
Carnival</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BONNIE HARRIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Call it the Princess' prerogative.</LD>
<LD>   After spurning Carnival Corp.'s aggressive courting for more than
a year in favor of another, P&amp;O Princess Cruises may now want to
change its mind.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, U.S. regulators cleared the way for both Carnival, the
world's biggest cruise line, and No. 2 Royal Caribbean Cruises to
pursue their respective bids for the No. 3 company, and the
sought-after Princess quickly considered making the most of either
deal, saying Carnival's didn't look so bad after all.</LD>
<TE>   "She's the crown jewel, considering all of her options," said Mike
Driscoll, senior editor of Wilmington, N.C.-based Cruise Week.</TE>
<TE>   London-based Princess indicated a willingness to enter into talks
this week with Carnival, whose $5.4-billion offer of cash and stock
already is favored by Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, Princess had expressed a preference for Royal
Caribbean's deal, which would allow the firms to remain separate,
with individual stock listings in New York and London. Carnival has
said it is open to making a dual-listing transaction, which prompted
Princess Chief Executive Peter Ratcliffe to say Friday that a deal
with Carnival "is both feasible and financially more attractive."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the final coupling, a merger would create the world's
largest cruise company, with more than 40% of the market, at a time
when travel remains in a worldwide slump, revenue is flat after more
than a year of deep discounting to get passengers on board, and years
of expansion have loaded the industry with debt and an oversupply of
luxury vessels.</TE>
<TE>   Although both U.S. and European regulators said that neither a
Princess-Carnival nor Princess-Royal Caribbean pairing would be
anti-competitive, some see the consolidation as a remedy for an
industry with too much capacity and too little room to raise prices.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the long term, I would expect them [the merged companies] to
have more pricing power," said Paul Keung, an analyst for CIBC World
Markets in New York. "In the short term, I doubt there'd be much
change, given the uncertainty of the industry right now."</TE>
<TE>   A Princess-Royal deal would combine 75,000 berths and control of
42% of the North American market. A Princess-Carnival pairing would
blend 88,000 berths and command 49% of the market.</TE>
<TE>   The United States now has 20 ports of call, compared with four
less than a decade ago. Cruise operators will launch 11 new cruises
out of New York alone in 2003--four more than last year.</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California, Carnival's Mexico cruises has become so
popular that it operates a $40-million terminal in Long Beach next to
the Queen Mary. The cruise line has two L.A.-based ships that carry
about 4,000 passengers, while Princess and Royal each have one.</TE>
<TE>   Carnival and Royal--which are both based in Miami--have said jobs
would not be cut as a result of a merger with Princess, and that new
hiring would likely take place in South Florida. Princess has about
12,000 employees, including 750 based at the company's local
headquarters in Santa Clarita.</TE>
<TE>   It was the post-Sept. 11 travel drop that led Princess and Royal
to propose a marriage last fall, which they touted would be a merger
of equals that would save $100 million annually. A month later,
Carnival stepped in with an unsolicited $4.5-billion bid that has
since been raised to $5.4 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Most cruise lines last year had to offer cut-rate prices to fill
the floating resorts, and at least two lines--Renaissance Cruises and
American Classic Voyages--folded last year as bookings dropped 50%.</TE>
<TE>   But by adjusting itineraries to keep passengers from having to
travel overseas, along with rates that were slashed to 20-year lows,
travelers were lured back more quickly than expected. The
International Council of Cruise Lines said the $20-billion cruise
industry would end 2002 with a record 7.4 million North American
passengers.</TE>
<TE>   "Consumer confidence in the cruise industry helped it rebound
beyond anyone's expectations of last September," said Michael Crye,
president of the council.</TE>
<TE>   By the second quarter, cruise rates had inched back up to within
7% of 2000 prices, Driscoll said. Cruise bookings through summer were
up 25% over the same time last year.</TE>
<TE>   But as the industry now moves into its off-season, rates have
already begun to fall again, he said, noting that a seven-night
Caribbean cruise on Holland America this fall is selling for $399 a
person.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts said such uncertainty would prevent a newly merged
cruise company from raising prices, particularly because they
generally come down after mergers because of greater efficiencies in
purchasing and distribution.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a very real opportunity here for consumers to really
benefit from either merger," said Jim Winchester, an analyst for
Lazard Freres &amp; Co. in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "And with the significant increase in capacity coming on over the
next few years, cruise companies will be required to be very
competitive," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Even with U.S. regulators' go-ahead, Carnival would still have to
win the votes of a majority of Princess shareholders to make it work.</TE>
<TE>   Princess management had consistently backed its original deal with
Royal, saying Royal's strong routes in the Caribbean would better
complement Princess' routes in Europe, Australia and Alaska. In
addition, the average age of its ships would be 6 years, making it
the most modern fleet of the major cruise lines.</TE>
<TE>   "They'd definitely have a better regional presence to face up to
Carnival," said Paul Sheehan of Jupiter Asset Management, which holds
Princess shares.</TE>
<TE>   Sheehan said with a Royal deal, Princess also would retain an
independent listing on the London Stock Exchange, autonomy that is
particularly appealing to its management.</TE>
<TE>   But Carnival executives are betting that their cash and stock
offer will be more attractive than Royal's because it comes with less
risk and a bigger premium to Princess shareholders. And now Princess
finally is warming up to the idea.</TE>
<TE>   A bidding war is unlikely, however. Analysts said Royal, which is
carrying about $4.4 billion in debt compared with Princess' $1.4
billion, has probably already offered its best hand. And Carnival has
a debt-equity ratio that is well below Royal's at $3.1 billion--or
26% of its $12 billion in equity--so it has little reason to sweeten
its deal any further.</TE>
<TE>   Royal Caribbean's chairman and chief executive, Richard Fain,
issued a statement expressing disappointment that Carnival's bid
received antitrust clearance but said, "We have no doubt that our
agreed merger represents a compelling opportunity to create
significant value for both P&amp;O Princess shareholders and Royal
Caribbean shareholders."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the Federal Trade Commission, in a 3-2 vote, closed its
10-month investigation of both proposed mergers, saying neither deal
would adversely affect consumers. The announcement was made after
markets closed.</TE>
<TE>   In New York Stock Exchange trading, Carnival stock fell 45 cents
to $23.68, and Royal lost 18 cents to $15.87.</TE>

<HD>EBay Shareholders Sue Firm, Officers Over IPOs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two EBay Inc. shareholders have sued the world's largest Internet
auctioneer and its executives, accusing them of improperly benefiting
from shares of initial public offerings underwritten by Goldman Sachs
Group Inc.</LD>
<LD>   EBay shareholders James Nolan and Michael Marra, in separate suits
filed last week in Santa Clara County Superior Court, accused board
member Robert Kagle, founder Pierre Omidyar, Chief Executive Margaret
Whitman and former Vice President Jeffrey Skoll of breaching their
fiduciary duties and usurping corporate opportunities.</LD>
<LD>   The House Financial Services Committee is probing whether Goldman
Sachs, the biggest underwriter of U.S. initial share sales, let
executives buy shares before they were traded in exchange for
investment banking business.</LD>
<TE>   Documents released by Congress show that in the last four years
stock allocations yielded instant profits to executives at EBay,
Global Crossing Ltd. and 19 other firms.</TE>
<TE>   The EBay shareholders said in the suits that the executives
"breached their fiduciary duty of loyalty, and usurped corporate
opportunities belonging to EBay, by accepting, selling and personally
profiting from IPO shares allocated by Goldman in exchange for
directing EBay's investment banking business to Goldman."</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Pursglove, a spokesman for San Jose-based EBay, said he
could not immediately comment on the suits.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of EBay rose 45 cents Friday to $52.35 on Nasdaq</TE>
<TE>   The shareholders are asking a judge to set up a constructive trust
for the company for the profits the executives reaped from the sale
of their IPO shares.</TE>
<TE>   Goldman was EBay's banker on the $1.5-billion acquisition of
electronic payments company PayPal Inc., which closed on Friday.</TE>

<HD>Shaking Up and Turning Around EMI</HD>
<DH>Music: The company's chairman and vice chairman discuss
changes they made and the industry's prospects.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHUCK PHILIPS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>EMI Group was once hailed as the music company that brought the world
the Beatles, Frank Sinatra and Nat King Cole.</LD>
<LD>   But by the time record veterans Alain Levy and David Munns took
over the British company's struggling music operations last October,
employees were joking that EMI stood for "Every Mistake Imaginable."</LD>
<LD>   Levy became chairman of EMI's Recorded Music division, and Munns
vice chairman. Their arrival followed a decade-long string of profit
warnings, management shakeups and financial setbacks at the world's
third-largest music company. Last year EMI posted a loss of about
$310 million.</LD>
<TE>   After slashing 1,800 jobs, firing 400 artists and shutting down
several record labels, Levy and Munns are finally putting some hits
on the charts by such new acts as Norah Jones, Coldplay, Kylie
Minogue and the Vines.</TE>
<TE>   But the industry is suffering from piracy of music over the
Internet, which is slowing CD sales. Levy and Munns, who previously
transformed PolyGram, spoke candidly in their first joint interview
about EMI's problems and other troubles facing the music industry.</TE>
<TE>   Question: EMI was a mess when you took over. The stock market now
values EMI at about a third of what it was worth during the
mid-1990s. How do you deal with that?</TE>
<TE>   Levy: It's very annoying to see the valuation put on record
companies these days. The market is based on perception, and people
now have a perception that the music industry is doomed. Is that the
reality? I don't think so. The only thing to do is work hard to build
a quality music catalog for the future.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Before joining EMI you took a break from the music business.
What looked different when you returned?</TE>
<TE>   Levy: What struck me most was how the music business is a world in
itself, one where executives are often richly rewarded--even when
they fail. In other industries, people understand that when [sales]
go down by 10%, you take a salary cut. When the market is down here,
these guys think it's everybody's fault but their own. When we
arrived, we could see there was a total disregard for the
shareholders in this company.</TE>
<TE>   Some of these executives make the same amount of money as the
heads of investment banking firms--plus they demand a guaranteed
bonus, even if they fail to make a profit. We put a stop to it here.</TE>
<TE>   Q: You cleaned house by firing hundreds of employees. You also
notified many senior executives that they either had to accept a 50%
salary cut or walk. Can you talk about that?</TE>
<TE>   Munns: We said to quite a few people around the world, "We've got
a job for you, and this is what we feel a fair amount in pay should
be; do you want the job?" Few left.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Your predecessors signed superstar Mariah Carey to an
$80-million-plus contract. Then you backed out of the Carey deal
after just one record and paid her $29 million to leave. Why?</TE>
<TE>   Levy: I know that decision shocked people. We can't really talk
much about it. I just want to say that we have absolute respect for
the artist and think she's a great star. The issue was the lack of
profitability of the deal and the risk profile. We ended it because
the deal was unlivable for the company.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Universal Music Group immediately signed Carey to an estimated
$20-million, three-album contract and is preparing to release her
next album. How will you guys feel if it's a hit?</TE>
<TE>   Levy: Believe me, if I had the same contract Universal got, we
wouldn't be having this discussion.</TE>
<TE>   Munns: I can't imagine any circumstance in the future where we
would regret the decision we made.</TE>
<TE>   Q: So why turn around last week and sign British rock star Robbie
Williams to a $70-million-plus deal, paying him nearly $40 million
upfront?</TE>
<TE>   Munns: We can't discuss the details about Robbie's deal. After the
Carey deal, we made it clear that we are not going to do crazy record
deals that have a huge risk in them. I assure you that this is not a
deal in that category. We'll make money on it with no sweat.</TE>
<TE>   Q: It's an unusual deal. I'm told that you invested about $25
million for a stake in a management company run by Williams and will
share in revenue generated by any of his sponsorship, publishing and
acting deals as well as from concert receipts. Why do this?</TE>
<TE>   Levy: Our goal is to transform EMI from a recording company into a
music company that shares in all kinds of revenue generated by the
artist. It's less volatile than record sales alone. You spread the
risk. Record companies spend an enormous amount of money launching
and developing an act--and we only get about 10% of the revenue. The
idea here is to tap into a share of the other revenues.</TE>
<TE>   Q: When you took over, EMI was posting profit warning after profit
warning. How do things look today?</TE>
<TE>   Levy: The company is in pretty good shape now. It's not
hemorrhaging anymore. But now we need to rebuild the artist roster
around the world, particularly in North America.</TE>
<TE>   It's funny though. I've got analysts already asking me why our
market share in America hasn't gone up in the last six months. This
is a business built on artistic creation. It takes time to cultivate
music careers. That's something we're very focused on.</TE>
<TE>   Munns: Companies need to continue building music catalogs. We need
to develop each artist's career patiently with a long-term,
multi-album approach. If we abandon that principle, we will end up
with a very fragile company and industry.</TE>
<TE>   Levy: What people have been concentrating on in the last five
years is signing as many deals as possible in order to land
blockbuster No. 1 hits. It looks great in the short term. But in the
long term, it doesn't work. That's why we want to sign and support
artists we can develop so that in 10 years we create a legacy, a rich
catalog of music.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Many wonder whether there will even be a music business in 10
years. With piracy eroding profits generated by new hits and
obliterating profit from old catalog sales, what makes you so
optimistic?</TE>
<TE>   Levy: Because the issues we've been facing in the music business
are now starting to affect film, TV and software companies. As [high
speed-Internet] connections accelerate the [piracy] problem for other
industries, intellectual property companies will unite into a strong
coalition to lobby the government. There's more pain to come, but the
music industry will survive.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What makes you think you can convince people that swapping
music on the Internet is stealing?</TE>
<TE>   Munns: Eventually, people will begin to understand that this is
just plain wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Why should music fans feel any moral obligation to enrich music
executives whom critics have accused of price-fixing and of cheating
their own artists?</TE>
<TE>   Munns: People enjoy bashing businessmen. I don't have a problem
with that. But I don't believe the American public is corrupt at
heart. People don't allow banks to be robbed. And they don't allow
cars to be stolen out of showrooms. We are in a business in which we
own intellectual property. We pay for it legally and we have a right
under law to be compensated for its use.</TE>
<TE>   Levy: I came up in an era when management believed a hit record
could solve all problems. But no amount of hits will end the piracy
epidemic. We're operating in an unknown arena here. We need to put
the brakes on piracy. But we also need to develop a consumer-friendly
product in the digital delivery world. And we need to do it fast.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Some of your competitors believe that EMI is destined to be
gobbled up?</TE>
<TE>   Levy: Some of our [competitors] have great uncertainties about
their futures and whether they fit into their parent company's
schemes. We don't have those problems.</TE>
<TE>   Some of our friends say we'll get gobbled up. We know nothing
about that. We just do our jobs as well as possible to increase the
value of the company for our shareholders and artists.
Everybody--including the so-called gobblers--is afraid of the future
right now.</TE>
<TE>   Munns: We're the third-biggest record corporation in the world.
There is no reason why we can't stand alone and be a successful
independent music company.</TE>

<HD>ImClone Plans More Erbitux Clinical Tests</HD>
<DH>Pharmaceuticals: The company is optimistic about a
250-patient trial underway. Larger tests will begin next year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ImClone Systems Inc. and Bristol-Myers Squibb Inc. are beginning a
new round of clinical tests of Erbitux, a promising drug to treat
colon cancer.</LD>
<LD>   A 250-patient trial now underway is expected to satisfy the Food
and Drug Administration for approval, the companies said last week.
Larger trials are scheduled to begin next year.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, shares of ImClone jumped 7% on the news to close at
$7.77 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The stock has lost 87% this year.
Bristol-Myers shares fell 6% to $21.76 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</LD>
<TE>   The companies' application for approval to market the drug, which
has shown promise in treating colon cancer without the side effects
of chemotherapy, was rejected by regulators in December because of
scientific flaws in the clinical studies.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, ImClone and Bristol--which committed $2 billion to
ImClone to share in Erbitux profits--have been caught up in the
controversy surrounding insider trading charges leveled at ImClone's
former Chief Executive Samuel Waksal and his friend, Martha Stewart,
chief executive of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Waksal and Stewart, who has not been charged in the case, have
maintained their innocence.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the House Energy and Commerce Committee will hold its
second ImClone hearing. Committee Chairman Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin
(R-La.) has said his panel will focus on what went wrong with Erbitux
and on ways to improve the FDA's review process.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission
also are investigating New York-based ImClone.</TE>
<TE>   Desperately ill patients and their advocates have complained that
the insider trading scandal surrounding ImClone is needlessly costing
lives.</TE>
<TE>   The companies said Friday that they may have a plan in place by
the end of the year to provide the drug to some of the nation's most
ill patients.</TE>
<TE>   Usually, patients needing unapproved treatments are enrolled in
clinical trials meant to gather data for FDA approval. Needy patients
not involved in the trials can still obtain experimental drugs
through "compassionate use" and "expanded access" programs allowed by
the agency.</TE>
<TE>   Patient advocates have been negotiating with ImClone for at least
13 months to start an expanded-access program.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still disappointed we don't have an expanded-access program,"
said Frank Burroughs, who founded the Abigail Alliance for Greater
Access to Developmental Drugs after his 21-year-old daughter died
while trying in vain to obtain Erbitux.</TE>
<TE>   Waksal was forced to step down as chief executive and has been
indicted on insider trading and a host of related charges.</TE>
<TE>   He also is accused of tipping off family members and Stewart to
sell their ImClone stock in the days before the FDA publicly
announced its rebuff of the Erbitux application, sending the stock
plummeting.</TE>

<HD>Consolidation Seen Among Game Firms</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: Analysts expect some troubled companies to
sell assets or go out of business in the next year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For video game companies, these are feast years. With hundreds of new
titles this holiday, the industry is expecting record sales.</LD>
<LD>   But not everyone is benefiting from the boom. A number of
firms--including Infogrames, 3DO Co., Acclaim Entertainment Inc.,
Irvine-based Interplay Entertainment Corp. and Midway Games Inc.--are
pressured by debt, declining sales and mounting costs.</LD>
<LD>   Their predicament illustrates the increasingly volatile nature of
a games business that's driven by blockbuster hits,
multimillion-dollar development costs and Hollywood-style marketing
budgets. Analysts predict a round of consolidation over the next year
as some companies sell their assets or simply go out of business.</LD>
<TE>   "You are seeing the cream rise to the top," said Edward Williams,
an analyst with investment banking firm Gerard Klauer Mattison in New
York. "Over the next 12 months, there's an inevitable thinning of the
ranks."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the companies now at the bottom of the heap were once at
the top, and many of them hold out hope that they may again dominate.
After all, the history of video games is rife with stories of
success, failure and redemption.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica-based Activision Inc., which was in bankruptcy in the
early 1990s, today is the nation's second-largest game publisher
after plodding its way back to the top, one hit at a time. And Atari,
once the undisputed leader of the video game industry, withered in
the 1980s and now is part of Infogrames.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys all think they're one holiday season away from a hit,"
Williams said, citing Take-Two Interactive Software Inc., which
pulled out of a nose dive last year with "Grand Theft Auto 3," a
sleeper title that became the best-selling console game of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Companies such as Redwood City, Calif.-based Electronic Arts Inc.,
and Calabasas-based THQ Inc. have managed to weather the ups and
downs of the industry by cultivating proven franchises. For EA,
perennial hits such as "Madden Football," "Fifa Soccer" and "The
Sims" have provided a fund to experiment with newer titles. Instead
of trying to cover every genre, however, EA has stayed on top by
sticking with tried and true formulas and wandering off only
occasionally.</TE>
<TE>   For Infogrames, its current hard times are particularly painful
because the French game publisher benefited three years ago from an
earlier round of consolidation by amassing a portfolio of game
companies. The company declined to comment for this story.</TE>
<TE>   Led by Bruno Bonnell, its charismatic French chief executive and
founder, Infogrames spent more than $300 million in three years
acquiring companies such as Hasbro Interactive, Shiny Entertainment,
GT Interactive Software, Accolade Inc. and Paradigm Entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   Infogrames didn't stop there. It also bid top dollar for licenses
to movies and television shows, including the "Survivor" television
show, "Men in Black II" and the upcoming sequels to "The Matrix."</TE>
<TE>   The shopping spree turned Infogrames into Europe's largest game
company and one of the top five game publishers in the United States.
But the properties had little in common, and many of them bled money.
The most troubled property was GT Interactive, responsible for the
bulk of a $322.6-million net loss at Infogrames' U.S. subsidiary in
2000. Some of the studios it purchased lost talent as owners cashed
out or left to start other companies.</TE>
<TE>   Its licenses have yet to pay off. The company released its
"Survivor" game just as the show's popularity fizzled. And its "Men
in Black" game failed to wow either critics or consumers. Its
"Matrix" games will not be released until next year, but analysts
question whether the games will perform well enough to justify the
$47 million Infogrames paid to license and develop the titles.</TE>
<TE>   So far, Infogrames has not been able to consolidate its disparate
empire and generate a profit. Its U.S. business has recovered and
eked out a $1-million operating profit and a $700,000 net loss for
the fiscal year that ended in June. The subsidiary completed the year
with just $6 million in cash. Its French parent did worse, posting a
net loss of about $78 million on revenue of about $750 million, $419
million from its U.S. arm.</TE>
<TE>   The upshot is that the onetime acquirer may find itself being
acquired if it can't turn a profit this fiscal year to satisfy
creditors holding convertible bonds worth $122.4 million and $302.5
million due in 2004 and 2005, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a company with all the signs of being up for sale," said
Michael Pachter, analyst with Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Infogrames' Bonnell recently denied to European journalists that
the firm is shopping itself around.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, if Bonnell were to change his mind, Infogrames has a
number of valuable assets it could sell, including its "Backyard
Sports" and "Test Drive" franchises, its Hasbro licenses to produce
games based on Monopoly and Scrabble, and its publishing contracts
with independent game studios for such titles as "Unreal 2003,"
"Neverwinter Nights" and "Sid Meier's Civilization III."</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, many other companies on the consolidation watch have
desirable assets. Midway has the "Mortal Kombat" franchise, 3DO owns
the "Army Men" series and Acclaim has had steady success with its BMX
titles and "Burnout" driving games. Interplay, which appeared to be
at death's door after ousting its founder and selling Shiny
Entertainment to Infogrames in April, has Black Isle Studios and the
license to the "Baldur's Gate" franchise.</TE>
<TE>   But Wall Street has been unimpressed, pushing several stocks to
new lows. Infogrames' U.S. subsidiary touched a 52-week low of $1.40
on Nasdaq on Friday before closing at $1.69, down 26 cents. For the
year, its stock is down more than 76%. Interplay closed at just 11
cents, also down 76% for the year. Acclaim is at $1.27, down from
$5.18 on Jan. 2. Midway's shares are off by 63% for the year at $5.51
on Friday. After a one-for-eight reverse stock split last month,
3DO's shares lost nearly 92% of their value this year and are trading
at $1.34.</TE>
<TE>   Acclaim declined to comment. Midway and Interplay could not be
reached for comment. Trip Hawkins, chief executive of 3DO, with a
market value of little more than $10 million, said his firm would sit
out this holiday season to retrench and focus on releasing a few key
titles it hopes will help it revive.</TE>
<TE>   "Theoretically, anybody can stage a comeback," said John
Riccitiello, president of Electronic Arts, the nation's largest game
company. "But each time the industry goes through one of these
cycles, it gets harder to make a comeback. The market gets bigger.
Consumer expectations rise. Development budgets, marketing budgets
rise. And when the stakes go up, there will be winners and there will
be losers."</TE>

<HD>Far From Rich After Court Victory</HD>
<DH>Tobacco: Ex-smoker Patricia Henley has yet to see a dime of
the millions in damages she won four years ago.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA GIRION</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Betty Bullock won worldwide attention last week for winning a record
$28-billion jury verdict against Philip Morris Cos., which sold the
cigarettes that gave her lung cancer.</LD>
<LD>   But Patricia Henley knows the grim reality of what usually happens
after beating Big Tobacco in court. Henley was the first sick smoker
to get her case to trial in California. And she did convince a jury
in 1999 that Philip Morris should pay her $50 million in punitive
damages.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly four years after Henley's victory, she has received none of
the award and lives on disability payments, worrying about how she
will pay the rent.</LD>
<TE>   "Everybody thinks I won," said the 55-year-old Glendale resident.
"I haven't seen a dime."</TE>
<TE>   Chances are Bullock won't see a dime either. Though the Newport
Beach woman's award is by far the largest in four years of plaintiff
victories--reversing a four-decade winning streak for the tobacco
industry--Henley's experience shows the kind of protracted appellate
battle Bullock faces.</TE>
<TE>   Of 11 sick smokers who won damage awards before Bullock, only one,
a Florida man, has been paid. The cases of all the rest are on
appeal. Many of the smokers are expected to die before appeals are
exhausted. That's what happened to Richard Boeken after he won a
$3-billion punitive damage award in Los Angeles last year, the
largest before Bullock's.</TE>
<TE>   "The tobacco companies' basic position is it ain't over until it's
over," said Northeastern University law professor Richard Daynard,
director of the Tobacco Products Liability Project, which encourages
smokers to sue.</TE>
<TE>   "Their desperate fear is that plaintiffs attorneys around the
country are going to try to start taking these cases in large
numbers," he said. "The quicker people receive their money, the more
likely it is that large numbers of attorneys will actually take these
cases."</TE>
<TE>   In Henley's case, jurors in San Francisco listened to six weeks of
testimony and reviewed documents that detailed the company's
promotion of cigarettes in spite of their hazards. During trial,
Henley was asked whether she accepted any personal responsibility for
smoking.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'You bet I do. I'm the one who is going to die.' "</TE>
<TE>   Jurors deliberated for less than two days before returning a
punitive damage award that was more than three times the $15 million
Henley had sought. She and her lawyer weren't sure that they had
heard it right.</TE>
<TE>   "It was really a shock to the whole tobacco industry that they
could be held responsible and at such a large number," said Madelyn
J. Chaber, Henley's lawyer. "This is an industry that considered
itself invincible, and they were taken down several notches."</TE>
<TE>   For Henley, the suit was never about getting rich. It was about
making Philip Morris pay.</TE>
<TE>   "I was not supposed to live," she said. "How can you take it with
you?"</TE>
<TE>   The trial judge reduced the punitive damages by half. An appeal is
pending.</TE>
<TE>   Henley plans to use any punitive damages that are collected by her
or her estate to endow a foundation to teach children the hazards of
smoking and to help those suffering from respiratory diseases.</TE>
<TE>   "I made it very clear in deposition I will not take a nickel of
your blood money," she said. "When I take a bite out of Philip
Morris' profits it will be the children who do not buy their products
because I talked to them and because they know what I say is the
truth."</TE>
<TE>   Henley also won $1.5 million in compensatory damages. If she ever
collects, she plans to invest that money and use the interest to help
with her monthly expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Life has been a struggle since she was found to have inoperable
lung cancer almost five years ago. Henley was forced to give up the
drain-cleaning business she ran.</TE>
<TE>   Things had been tight, but last week they got much worse. On
Friday--the very day the jury handed Bullock her $28-billion
judgment--Henley received a letter from the Social Security
Administration informing her that her $666 monthly disability payment
had been cut to $304.50 because she had gotten married. Her husband's
disability payments were similarly slashed, leaving the couple with a
combined monthly income of $1,352. Their rent is $1,000.</TE>
<TE>   "We can pay most of our bills," Henley said. "But we won't be able
to eat."</TE>
<TE>   Her suddenly dire financial situation has made urgent an idea
Henley has to put together a singing act. She figures she can earn
$50 an hour performing in retirement homes. The problem is that she
hasn't been able to sing for longer than 20 minutes since she got
sick, and the retirement homes want one-hour acts.</TE>
<TE>   "This product took away my life," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Henley smoked her first cigarette at age 15 outside a school
dance. "The guy I liked smoked Marlboro," she recalled. "I wanted to
show off for him, so I had to smoke Marlboro."</TE>
<TE>   Henley went on to smoke up to 3 1/2 packs a day. Thirty-five years
after that first cigarette, she quit.</TE>
<TE>   "I made a big deal of it," she said of her decision to stop
smoking. "I told all my friends and family so I would be so
embarrassed if I went back. I made such a hoopla of it, I couldn't go
back on my word."</TE>
<TE>   Three weeks later, in early 1998, Henley was in a clinic getting
an X-ray for what she thought was pneumonia. After a second X-ray,
the doctor called her to show her a "big spot, bigger than anything
they've seen."</TE>
<TE>   Lacking medical insurance, Henley checked into the county hospital
for a diagnosis. A sign affixed to her headboard read "52/35/3 1/2."
Hers was the only bed she could see with such a sign.</TE>
<TE>   "I called the nurse and said, 'What in the world is this?' "</TE>
<TE>   "She said, 'You're 52 years old. You smoked for 35 years, and you
smoked 3 1/2 packs a day.' I told her, 'You get that off my bed now.'
"</TE>
<TE>   The next day, five doctors appeared at Henley's bedside.</TE>
<TE>   "They said, 'You have less than four months to live and you are
going to die the worst death known to mankind.' "</TE>
<TE>   Henley outlasted the prognosis, enduring a year of chemotherapy
and radiation treatments that continue to sap her strength. Her
oncologist told her that her cancer appears to be in remission, but
she lives with the knowledge that death could come any day.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have small-cell carcinoma, it's easy to get rid of the
first time," she said. "But when it comes back, it comes back with a
vengeance. And when it does, it will kill you within days. We know
that's what I have to look forward to, but we don't know when."</TE>

<HD>Anxiety Trips Up a Recovery on Wall Street</HD>
<DH>Markets: Worries about corporate earnings and the prospect
of war with Iraq are keeping investor confidence at bay.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Six straight weeks of losses have dragged major stock market indexes
to new multiyear lows, but with anxiety over corporate earnings and
the prospect of war with Iraq still on the rise, experts are
reluctant to say the worst is over.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrials and the Nasdaq composite index sank to
fresh lows Friday, and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended just slightly
above its July low as conflicting economic data and profit warnings
from the likes of Bank of New York Co., EMC Corp., Schering-Plough
Corp. and Boeing Co. provided the latest reasons to dump stocks.</LD>
<LD>   "It's hard for the market to get any confidence," said Chuck Hill,
research director at earnings tracker Thomson Financial/First Call in
Boston.</LD>
<TE>   With the S&amp;P 500 coming off its worst quarter in 15 years and the
average domestic stock mutual fund down 17.2% in the three months
ended Sept. 30, that's a common feeling among investors these days.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't help that the fourth quarter got off to a dismal start,
with the S&amp;P 500 sliding 3.2% last week despite a big bounce Tuesday.
The index now is down 30% year to date.</TE>
<TE>   The chief culprit is the rapidly deteriorating outlook for
corporate profits, some market pros say.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts' consensus estimate of year-over-year operating earnings
growth in the third quarter for companies in the S&amp;P 500 has shrunk
to 5.9% from 16.6% in early July, Hill said. And fourth-quarter
projections are being ratcheted down at a fast clip as well.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard for the market to maintain any sustained rally when
analysts are slashing estimates like this," Hill said.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts are reacting in large part to what they are hearing from
corporate executives. Among the 5,000 U.S. companies that First Call
follows, warnings of profit shortfalls this quarter have outpaced
positive "pre-announcements" by 2.4 to 1.</TE>
<TE>   That's a big change from the first half of the year, when the
economy, and earnings, seemed to be on solid recovery tracks.</TE>
<TE>   The ratio of negative to positive earnings pre-announcements was
1.6 to 1 at this point in the second quarter and 1.3 to 1 at this
point in the first.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, aluminum giant Alcoa Inc., the first Dow index company
to report its third-quarter results, provided little encouragement,
recording its sixth straight drop in quarterly profit.</TE>
<TE>   Third-quarter reporting season heats up starting Oct. 14, but a
smattering of reports due this week from General Electric Co., Yahoo
Inc., Abbott Laboratories and several regional banks might offer
early clues about the broad trends in sales and earnings.</TE>
<TE>   Hill expects S&amp;P 500 earnings to beat analysts' expectations by
the usual 2 percentage points or so once the third-quarter numbers
have been tallied, but he fears that profit reports may be
"accompanied by comments about how lousy business is," which wouldn't
help lift the glum mood on Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   In its warning Thursday, data-storage company EMC pointed to a
"brutal" business climate.</TE>
<TE>   On the economic front, the mixed message of recent weeks continued
Friday as the government said nonfarm payrolls fell by 43,000 in
September, compared with expectations of a small increase, while the
unemployment rate was a better-than-expected 5.6%.</TE>
<TE>   Richard DeKaser, chief economist at National City Corp. in
Cleveland, said corporate leaders have adopted a "wait-and-see
disposition that yields self-fulfilling results": Their reluctance to
hire workers, make capital investments and launch ventures is keeping
economic activity, and thus sales and earnings, restrained.</TE>
<TE>   "The ramp-up in war jitters is the paramount concern" among
executives, DeKaser said. He said confidence among executives and
investors may not return until there is a clearer sense about what
may happen in the U.S.-Iraqi standoff over weapons inspections.</TE>
<TE>   But some experts insist that the economy is in better shape than
recent earnings warnings, and falling stock prices, would indicate.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at the stock market and the corporate bond market
you'd think we're in a recession again. But if you look at the
economy you don't find anything like that," said Scott Grannis, chief
economist at Western Asset Management in Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   He expects growth to continue at a modest 2% to 3% pace. Because
the stock market already has "priced in" a recession, by Grannis'
estimation, share prices could be primed to turn around sooner than
later, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody seems braced for the worst, but we could be seeing the
market bottom, or at least the bottoming process," Grannis said.</TE>
<TE>   If he's right, that would fit with October's historical role as a
"bear killer." Some of the worst market declines of the post-World
War II era have ended in October.</TE>
<TE>   In a report Friday, Michael Painchaud of Market Profile Theorems,
a Seattle-based investment research firm, predicted that the Dow
would surge to 11,000 by March. That would be a 46% rise from
Friday's close of 7,528.40.</TE>
<TE>   Painchaud said several signs pointed to a rally: Corporate
insiders turned bullish in August, buying shares of their own
companies at a brisk pace; the S&amp;P 500 performance chart from the
last three years looks similar to the 1972-74 downturn, which
preceded a dramatic rebound; and corporate earnings in 2003 probably
will be healthier than the recent spate of warnings suggests, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   First Call's Hill said that although the next couple of weeks
could be ugly for the market, later this month investors may start
looking optimistically toward 2003, with the hope that earnings by
then will be rebounding at a stronger pace.</TE>
<TE>   The market has often bottomed in October in part because investors
and company executives begin to shift their focus to the coming year,
Hill said.</TE>

<HD>He's Raised the Tobacco Bar</HD>
<DH>Michael Piuze's Massive Verdicts Against Industry Set Him
Apart</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Michael Piuze was in his 20s, he found himself in a south
Florida jail on a traffic violation. Piuze asked if he could place
the phone call he figured he had a right to make.</LD>
<LD>   "Boy, Jefferson Davis didn't write that in the Constitution,"
Piuze recalled a guard telling him.</LD>
<LD>   Piuze said he was "roughed up" by guards during that five-day jail
stint.</LD>
<TE>   The incident inspired him to go to law school. And now Piuze is
the one who's dishing out the punishment.</TE>
<TE>   The 58-year-old lawyer scored a $28-billion verdict against Philip
Morris Cos. last week, the largest-ever punitive damage award to an
individual plaintiff. That comes on top of a $3-billion verdict Piuze
won against the tobacco company last year on behalf of another
smoker.</TE>
<TE>   A late arrival to the nation's tobacco wars, the veteran personal
injury and product liability lawyer has quickly emerged as a star of
the anti-tobacco bar. The attorney, who works with a few paralegals
out of a Brentwood office suite, has two more tobacco cases on deck,
including one scheduled for trial Jan. 2.</TE>
<TE>   Piuze (pronounced "pews") has won praise for his performance in
the courtroom, where, observers say, he has a knack for connecting to
jurors with his "regular Joe" perspective and homespun anecdotes.
Even his opponents have referred to him as a gifted storyteller with
"a seductive quality."</TE>
<TE>   In his private life, though, Piuze claims few close friends. He
exudes intensity, colleagues say, racing a custom-built Porsche on a
professional track at speeds exceeding 150 mph and sticking to a
tough exercise regimen. Fees from blockbuster verdicts in other cases
have made him a wealthy man, with a home in Malibu and a fleet of
exotic sports cars that he insists on washing himself, according to
people who know him. He is married but separated from his wife.</TE>
<TE>   "He loves fast cars, he loves beautiful women and he's very
intense at what he does," said Garo Mardirossian, a lawyer who has
worked with Piuze on tobacco cases. "Money is usually the last thing
on his mind. He's already made money that he never thought he could,
so he does things because he believes in the cause."</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear how much in fees, if anything, Piuze will eventually
collect from his two mega-verdicts against Philip Morris. Plaintiffs'
lawyers working on contingency generally get 30% of whatever is
ultimately paid out, and tobacco verdicts usually are reduced and
delayed for years on appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers who have opposed Piuze say he is dogged in his pursuit of
what he considers fair compensation for his clients and is unwilling
to accept less. Vincent Galvin, who opposed Piuze in an auto accident
case, said: "You don't have settlement negotiations with Mike, and
that's very unique among plaintiffs' lawyers. I think he's very
capable." Litigating against him "is a challenge and it forces you to
be on your game."</TE>
<TE>   William S. Ohlemeyer, vice president and associate general counsel
for Philip Morris, was critical of Piuze's pursuit of a
multibillion-dollar award against his company: "Guys like Michael
Piuze aren't going to bully us."</TE>
<TE>   Piuze asked the jury for up to $20 billion, which Philip Morris
considered far out of proportion to the $850,000 that the jury
awarded for compensatory damages. That, said Ohlemeyer, "is something
that an exceptional lawyer, a good lawyer, a fair-minded lawyer,
wouldn't do. You know, I know, he knows the law doesn't allow that."</TE>
<TE>   After working as a lawyer defending insurance companies for three
years, Piuze opened his own small firm in 1976. Handling insurance,
medical malpractice and auto accident cases, he has won some of the
biggest verdicts in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, he obtained a $15-million verdict against General
Motors Corp., the latest outcome in a 10-year-old case that had
bounced between trial and appeal. Piuze's client had fallen asleep at
the wheel of his Chevrolet Blazer, which then veered off the road and
flipped over. The roof collapsed and paralyzed the then-18-year-old
driver. Piuze argued that the vehicle's roof had been poorly
designed. The case is on appeal.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1990s, he represented a pair of diamond wholesalers
who said $8 million worth of precious stones had been stolen from
their store. A federal grand jury later indicted his clients for
allegedly faking the theft and engaging in bank fraud. The pair
pleaded no contest to three related felony bank fraud counts.
Representing the pair, Piuze accused their insurance company of bad
faith for trying to rescind its policy and obtained a settlement of
about $3 million.</TE>
<TE>   Piuze has been a maverick within the plaintiff's bar, sometimes
clashing with his fellow lawyers. In the late 1980s, manufacturers
and other interests successfully lobbied for a California law that
would limit product-liability claims. In a compromise with business
interests, trial lawyers agreed to forgo lawsuits against tobacco
companies, which were not their bread and butter.</TE>
<TE>   Piuze, who had been planning to sue on behalf of a smoker, was
left with no case. California lawmakers repealed the ban in 1997,
clearing the way for Piuze to take up his tobacco crusade.</TE>
<TE>   As a lawyer, Piuze describes himself as a "combatant." People who
have worked with him say he shuns traditional trial preparation,
often cramming before key court days. In the tobacco case, he relied
primarily on documents and research already unearthed by state
attorneys general pressing their own cases against cigarette
manufacturers.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not a preparer," Piuze said. Many litigators, he said,
"prepare for a living but rarely if ever go into battle. I'm not
belittling preparation, but I feel there are other people that do it
way better than me."</TE>
<TE>   In the case of Big Tobacco, however, Piuze had done a degree of
personal homework. The son of a truck driver, Piuze described himself
as a "non-student" while growing up in Worcester, Mass. Around age
13, while working in the kitchen at a New Hampshire summer camp, he
started smoking, quickly developing a two-pack-a-day habit. He smoked
Marlboros for more than 20 years and said he ignored federal health
warnings about cigarettes during the 1960s because, at the time, "a
very substantial portion of our population didn't believe anything
our government said." He quit in 1981 at the insistence of one of his
daughters.</TE>
<TE>   In representing Betty Bullock, a Newport Beach grandmother and
longtime smoker who is dying of lung cancer, the plaintiff in his
most recent victory, Piuze challenged the idea that his client bore
personal responsibility for her condition. With his voice cracking
and tears welling in his eyes, he told jurors that "she stayed long
enough to do this. She's hung on." Bullock, he said, was acting as a
responsible person by taking on Big Tobacco, "to say, 'To heck with
them.' "</TE>
<TE>   Experts say the massive verdict in the Bullock case is likely to
be cut. Indeed, a judge reduced Piuze's $3-billion verdict last year
to $100 million, and Philip Morris is still appealing the case. Piuze
declined to discuss the possibility of having the Bullock case award
slashed. But colleagues say he has been irritated by the prospect
that his biggest wins face stiff challenges later.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been very frustrated by the legal system," said Gary
Dordick, an attorney and longtime friend of Piuze. "Mike has probably
lost more money on appeal than 99% of the other lawyers in California
added up. Our jury system is based on 12 people in the community
being there in the courtroom and determining what's fair. Then you

<LD>British American Tobacco and other cigarette makers are asking U.S.
legislators to restrict Philip Morris Cos.' exclusive agreements with
retailers because they limit competition.</LD>
<LD>   The companies, which also include JT International USA, Liggett
Group Inc. and Wind River Tobacco, said in a statement that they
wanted to prohibit companies from requiring retailers to limit sales
of rival cigarettes.</LD>
<LD>   Philip Morris, the world's largest cigarette maker, whose brands
include Marlboro, has sent coupons to some customers and is giving
them clothing and duffle bags to keep them from switching to
lower-priced, generic brands.</LD>
<TE>   Philip Morris tries to limit advertising for rivals at retailers,
the companies said.</TE>
<TE>   The owners of 16,000 U.S. stores support the initiative by British
American Tobacco, the statement said, without naming them. It was
announced at the National Assn. of Convenience Stores' annual meeting
in Orlando, Fla.</TE>

<HD>Data Likely to Show Weaker Consumption</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Spending at U.S. retailers declined in September and consumer
optimism soured early this month, signs that the economy's biggest
source of strength may be starting to fade, reports this week are
likely to show.</LD>
<LD>   Retail sales fell 1.1% in September, the first decrease in four
months, the Commerce Department is expected to report Friday. The
University of Michigan probably will report the same day that its
consumer sentiment index fell this month to 85.2, the weakest since
November.</LD>
<LD>   The statistics suggest a pall over the economy at the beginning of
the final three months of the year, which include the holiday
shopping season. Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of
gross domestic product, and though such spending was strong enough
last year to make the recession one of the mildest on record, pent-up
demand is lacking.</LD>
<TE>   Most of the expected decline in retail sales will reflect the
weakest month for auto dealers since May. New cars and light trucks
sold at a 16.3-million-unit annual rate in September, down from an
18.7-million-unit pace a month earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding auto dealers, sales at retailers probably rose
0.1%. That is one-fourth the August increase and is expected because of
weak results at department stores.</TE>
<TE>   Also this week, the Labor Department is expected to report
Thursday for a seventh straight week that more than 400,000 people
applied for unemployment insurance benefits in the week ended
Saturday. That is a level for initial claims that economists say is
consistent with a weak job market.</TE>
<TE>   Discounting by automakers and other producers to lure customers is
keeping a lid on inflation. The producer price index probably rose
0.1% last month after showing no change in August, the Labor
Department is expected to report Friday. Through August, the price of
goods at the wholesale level was 1.6% lower than a year ago, Labor
Department figures showed a month ago.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the so-called
core index for producer prices probably rose 0.1% in September after a
0.1% decline. For the 12 months ended in August, core prices fell
0.3%, the largest decline on record.</TE>
<TE>   Higher costs for imported oil as rising Middle East tensions
stoked concern that supplies might be disrupted probably led to a
0.3% increase in the Labor Department's import price index, scheduled
for release Thursday. Prices of imported goods were down 1.3% over
the 12 months ended in August.</TE>
<TE>   Other reports this week:</TE>
<TE>   * Today, the Fed will report on consumer borrowing in August.</TE>
<TE>   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan addresses the American Bankers Assn.
annual convention.</TE>
<TE>   * Thursday, the Commerce Department will report on wholesale

<HD>FDA Nominee to Face Senate Panel Today</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mark McClellan will need to persuade U.S. senators today that his
experiences as a doctor and economics advisor qualify him to be the
next head of the Food and Drug Administration.</LD>
<LD>   Officials from industries regulated by the agency support
President Bush's nomination. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), who
heads the committee that will review the appointment at a hearing
today, plans to question McClellan about his lack of government
agency work, spokesman James Manley said.</LD>
<LD>   The drug, food and medical device safety agency oversees products
that account for about 22 cents of every $1 spent by U.S. consumers,
said Brad Stone, an agency spokesman. The FDA has about 10,000
employees and a yearly budget of $1.6 billion.</LD>
<TE>   A call to McClellan's office was directed to the White House press
office.</TE>
<TE>   "Dr. McClellan is highly respected and highly qualified for the
post," said White House spokesman Scott McClellan, who is also the
nominee's brother. "He has diverse experience in research, medicine
and economics."</TE>
<TE>   McClellan already has won confirmation from the Senate once, when
Bush named him to the White House's advisory Council of Economic
Advisors. He also lacks ties to FDA-regulated companies, which will
help him in the Senate, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   McClellan has spent much of his career examining the cost of
health care. He has published more than 25 articles, looking at
topics such as Medicare reimbursement. He also served in the Clinton
administration as a Treasury official.</TE>

<HD>Merrill, Morgan May Cut Thousands of Jobs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co., two of the world's
top investment banks, are preparing to cut thousands of jobs, sources
familiar with the companies said.</LD>
<LD>   The cuts are the latest for the global investment banking sector,
which is estimated to have shed about 60,000 jobs since the start of
last year. The banks have been slashing costs as the bear market has
cut to a trickle lucrative takeover deals and initial public
offerings.</LD>
<LD>   Banking industry sources said J.P. Morgan, the second-largest U.S.
banking company, could cut as many as 3,000 workers.</LD>
<TE>   The source said the latest round of J.P. Morgan job cuts would
trim its 20,000-member investment banking staff by 10% to 15%. The
source said most of the cuts would hit staff in New York and Asia and
added that Europe might emerge unscathed.</TE>
<TE>   A J.P. Morgan spokesman in London declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, sources said that Merrill Lynch, the biggest
full-service brokerage in the U.S., was also preparing further job
cuts. The bank, which currently employs more than 50,000, has cut
about 15,000 workers in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   Sources said the bulk of the cuts would focus on New York and
London.</TE>
<TE>   A Merrill Lynch spokesman said the company continued to actively
manage its resources, including expenses and headcount, in line with
the business environment.</TE>

<HD>Intel Expects Industry Recovery in Early 2003</HD>
<DH>Computers: Its CEO says users' greater demands for data
transmission and wireless solutions will restore growth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>SEVILLE, Spain</DL>
<LD>Intel Corp., the world's largest chip maker, expects a recovery in
the computer industry in early 2003 after an improvement in the
economy, Chief Executive Craig Barrett said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The recovery in the computer industry will come before a rebound
in the telecommunications business, in which there has been too much
investment based on unmet expectations, Barrett said at the European
Technology Roundtable Exhibition conference in Seville.</LD>
<LD>   "I expect the computer sector to recover in the early part
of 2003," Barrett said. "For the communications sector, I don't think
you are going to see much recovery until the end of 2003 or 2004."</LD>
<TE>   Chip sales plunged by a third last year, the industry's
steepest-ever slump. Intel and rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. have
been trying to shore up demand for PCs with faster products and price
cuts. Orders haven't recovered, and some analysts have said demand
won't come back until 2003. Intel last month chopped $200 million off
its third-quarter sales forecast.</TE>
<TE>   New technologies such as wireless solutions and increased
data-transmission needs by users will restore growth, Barrett said.</TE>
<TE>   "Never been more optimistic about the future of our industry than
I am right now, even though we are in the middle of this deep
recession," Barrett said.</TE>
<TE>   Intel is cutting its investments in technology companies to about
$200 million this year, from about $1 billion in previous years.</TE>
<TE>   "The drop is solely related to the marketplace. The venture
capital market has dried up with a lack of new investments," Barrett
said.</TE>
<TE>   In China and India, however, there hasn't been a drop
in investment, and that is helping those countries fuel growth in
computer technology, Barrett said.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Intel shares fell 13 cents to $13.71 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>DMV Closes Toyota of Cerritos, Alleging False Ads, Fraud</HD>
<DH>Autos: The agency, issuing its most severe penalty, says
the dealership failed to sell vehicles at advertised prices and
forced customers to buy extra accessories.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ABIGAIL GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California's Department of Motor Vehicles shut down auto dealership
Toyota of Cerritos for one day Sunday for what the agency called
false advertising and fraud, a DMV spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   The DMV, which licenses sellers as well as drivers, accused Toyota
of Cerritos of failing to disclose advertised prices and failing to
sell vehicles at advertised prices.</LD>
<LD>   The dealership also was accused of advertising vehicles at one
price while requiring customers to buy extra accessories to get the
car at that price, the DMV said.</LD>
<TE>   Toyota of Cerritos could not be reached for comment. Callers to
the dealership were told only that "we are closed today" before being
directed to voicemail.</TE>
<TE>   The dealership is in Cerritos Auto Square, one of the largest auto
retail centers in the country.</TE>
<TE>   "This action says the department will consistently take a strong
stand against fraud by car dealers in California," DMV Deputy
Director John McClellan said in a news release. "All dealers, large
and small, need to get the message that false advertising and
deceptive practices toward consumers just won't be tolerated anywhere
in the state."</TE>
<TE>   DMV investigators arrived at Toyota of Cerritos at 9 a.m. Sunday
to close the dealership and post notices explaining that the
dealership's license to sell cars was suspended for one day, said DMV
spokesman Steve Haskins.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota of Cerritos will have its license reinstated today and is
expected to be open for business, Haskins said.</TE>
<TE>   The dealership, which entered into an agreement with the DMV, will
pay a $100,000 fine and reimburse the DMV $45,000 for investigative
and legal costs, the agency said.</TE>
<TE>   The company will pay unspecified restitution to consumers the DMV
says were harmed by the dealership's sales practices and pay for
three annual DMV audits, the agency said.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota of Cerritos was placed on three years' probation and
received two additional days of forced closure, which were stayed for
the probationary period. If the dealership does not incur additional
violations during its probation, the extra two days of license
suspension would be waived, the DMV said.</TE>
<TE>   Haskins said the allegations-- which were filed against the
dealership under its corporate name, Mr. Wheels Inc., on July 12,
2001 --stemmed from customer complaints.</TE>
<TE>   Suspending a dealership's license, an action taken only a few
times each year, is the DMV's most severe penalty, Haskins said.</TE>

<HD>Chief Executive Takes the Lid Off Tupperware Sales Routine</HD>
<DH>Household products: Rick Goings turns to the Internet, TV,
kiosks and retailers to augment business from home parties.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DELBERT ELLERTON</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tupperware Corp. Chief Executive Rick Goings is doing away with the
one-party system as he tries to sell more plastic food-storage
containers.</LD>
<LD>   Goings is expanding beyond Tupperware's home parties to malls, the
Internet and television to boost sales and profit in Europe, the
company's biggest market, and build up its independent sales force of
1.2 million.</LD>
<LD>   "The party is at the core," he said. "But how do we also provide
more access to other consumers who want to buy Tupperware products?"</LD>
<TE>   Goings' plan, which includes selling in stores for the first time
in 50 years, helped boost sales in the U.S. by 32% in the last two
years as consumers bought new products such as $49 water-filter
pitchers and $16 ice cream scoops. Investors are counting on Goings
duplicating that feat in Europe, where sales have declined for six
straight years.</TE>
<TE>   "If they get Europe growing at the same rate as the U.S. did last
year, earnings will be very good," said analyst Gary Soura of
Schneider Capital Management, which owned 739,100 Tupperware shares
as of March.</TE>
<TE>   Investors could use some good news. Earlier this month, Goings
lowered Tupperware's 2002 profit forecast, in part because the
company cut prices and increased spending on incentives to motivate
its sales staff and recruit new representatives in Europe. Tupperware
may miss that forecast unless sales pick up in Europe, analysts and
investors said.</TE>
<TE>   The Orlando, Fla.-based company's stock has fallen more than 40%
since Goings took over in August 1997. The shares fell 29 cents
Friday, to $16.16 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Founded in 1946 by inventor Earl Tupper, the company sent
salespeople into homes to demonstrate how the containers' airtight
seal worked. The gatherings proved so successful that Tupperware
stopped offering its products in stores in 1951, in favor of direct
sales.</TE>
<TE>   Tupperware returned to retail shelves last year when Goings teamed
with Kroger Co., the biggest U.S. supermarket chain, and discount
retailer Target Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Tupperware, which had $1.1 billion in sales in 2001, has more than
600 mall kiosks in the U.S. It opened its first one four years ago.
Its products are getting exposure on three one-hour shows a month on
USA Interactive's Home Shopping Network, Goings said.</TE>
<TE>   Expanding distribution helped Goings revive the Tupperware party
as the company recruited more independent salespeople.</TE>
<TE>   "A larger sales force [means] increased sales," said Rommel
Dionisio, an analyst at Friedman Billings Ramsey &amp; Co., who rates the
shares "buy" and doesn't own them.</TE>
<TE>   Sales from Tupperware parties in North America rose to $183.7
million last year from $151 million in 1999, the company said. Sales
through other channels rose to $22.2 million from $7.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   Goings, a former Avon Products Inc. executive, also gave the
Tupperware party a makeover to keep up with changing lifestyles as
more women work outside the home.</TE>
<TE>   "More [parties] take place in the evening," he said. "It's wine
and cheese. It's often girls' night out."</TE>
<TE>   Though total U.S. sales rose to $234.6 million last year, they
still lag levels of more than a decade ago. Until Tupperware expanded
its U.S. distribution, sales had fallen to $176.7 million in 1997
from $285.2 million in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   "In the U.S., Tupperware parties had faded," Soura said.
"Tupperware wasn't in the forefront of consumers' minds."</TE>
<TE>   Goings' marketing strategy has helped Maier Runyon, an
Atlanta-based Tupperware distributor, who employs 1,400 independent
sales representatives and had $3 million in sales last year.</TE>
<TE>   "We weren't doing much advertising," said Runyon, who operates the
business with her husband, Scott. "Now, you can't go a week without
seeing Tupperware on TV or at the malls."</TE>
<TE>   Goings also is adding redesigned products such as Rock 'n Serve
microwaveable containers and new items such as Open House Chip 'n Dip
bowls.</TE>
<TE>   Goings said Tupperware doesn't compete against companies such as
Newell Rubbermaid Inc. that make less expensive storage containers.</TE>
<TE>   Sales in Europe peaked at $595.1 million in 1995. Revenue has
fallen every year since then, dipping to $400.4 million last year as
high unemployment and inflation in Germany hurt sales, Goings said.</TE>
<TE>   The company expects sales in Europe this year to be unchanged from
2001, spokeswoman Jane Garrard said.</TE>
<TE>   Goings is expanding the number of kiosks at European malls to 300
by the end of the year from 130 now. He said the company is hedging
to protect against currency fluctuations.</TE>
<TE>   Tupperware will start selling on the Internet in the third quarter
and is considering using the Home Shopping Network in Italy and
Germany, Goings said.</TE>

<HD>Labels, Webcasters Reportedly Reach Deal</HD>
<DH>Internet: Sources say the long-awaited pact calls for lower
royalty payments by small online radio stations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Record labels and small Internet radio stations reached a
long-awaited agreement Sunday that calls for significantly lower
royalty payments for online music broadcasts, sources close to the
negotiations said.</LD>
<LD>   Unless Congress changes the law quickly to implement the deal,
however, these Webcasters will have to pay three years of back
royalties Oct. 20 at the full rate set by the librarian of Congress.
That rate--0.07 cent per song per listener, or $92 per listener per
year for an all-music station--could drive many small Webcasters out
of business.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement Sunday came in response to pressure from leaders of
the House and Senate judiciary committees, who are expected to take
the lead in trying to implement a compromise through legislation.
Lawmakers have been heavily lobbied by small Webcasters who fear that
their industry will be destroyed if they are forced to pay high
royalty rates.</LD>
<TE>   The deal offers no relief to large Webcasters, such as Yahoo
Inc.'s Santa Monica-based subsidiary Launch, or mid-size ones such as
Radio Free Virgin in Los Angeles or Live365 in Foster City, Calif.
Negotiations last week between the labels and large Webcasters on a
long-term deal failed to bear fruit, despite signs of progress.</TE>
<TE>   Sources on both sides of Sunday's deal, who spoke on the condition
of anonymity, said it was a two-year agreement that calls for
Webcasters to pay back and future royalties equal to 8% to 12% of
their revenue or 5% to 7% of their expenses, whichever was higher.</TE>
<TE>   The deal, which also would let back royalties be paid in
installments, initially applies only to Webcasters with less than $1
million in revenue.</TE>
<TE>   One potential sticking point for the small Webcasters' deal is
payments to artists. Today, the labels are bound by contract to pay
about half of the Webcasting royalties directly to performing
artists. Some artists' unions and trade groups are insisting that any
legislation for small Webcasters should also mandate direct payments
to artists, but the labels have not agreed to such a provision.</TE>
<TE>   The artists unions flexed their muscles last week, lining up top
Democrats to oppose a bill to delay Webcasting royalty payments for
six months. The sponsor, House Judiciary Committee Chairman F. James
Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.), withdrew the bill, avoiding almost
certain defeat on the House floor.</TE>
<TE>   Sensenbrenner is expected to take a bill implementing the deal to
the House floor as early as today.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed rate for small Webcasters is higher than the
percentage of revenue that cable and satellite TV companies pay for
their digital broadcasting services. Still, it would generate
significantly smaller royalties than the 0.14 cent per song
originally proposed by a federal arbitration panel, the source said.</TE>
<TE>   The librarian of Congress cut the panel's proposal in half, but
small Webcasters still pleaded for a percentage-of-revenue deal that
would take into account the slumping advertising market. Large
Webcasters favored a per-song royalty but were eager for a lower
rate.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Oil Thirst Vexes Moderate Muslims</HD>
<DH>Energy policy fosters perception problems.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK LENZI</AU>
<BD>Mark Lenzi is a former Peace Corps volunteer and
Fulbright scholar working as an environmental engineer in Baku,
Azerbaijan.</BD>
<DL>BAKU, Azerbaijan</DL>
<LD>Ground breaking last month on the monumental Baku-Ceyhan oil pipeline
marks the beginning of a project that could affect the average
American much more than any war with Iraq, and it is a fascinating
case study in how Muslim nations view the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   For years, just the concept of an oil pipeline that would stretch
for more than 1,000 miles through Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey was
thought to be a pipe dream.</LD>
<LD>   However, this region is where Central Asia meets the Middle East,
and now that the project is underway it appears that no price is too
high for Washington and world oil companies to link the oil of the
Caspian Sea region with the Mediterranean Sea without passing through
unstable southern Russia or Iran.</LD>
<TE>   Although President Bush hailed the construction as "enhancing
global energy security" and "a model for future cooperative efforts
in the region," the fact is that the million-barrel-a-day pipeline
will severely harm a region that has already been devastated by years
of shameless oil exploitation by the Soviet Union and the West.</TE>
<TE>   The area around the oil fields in Azerbaijan has by far the worst
environmental damage I have ever seen. It is an ecological disaster
of epic proportions.</TE>
<TE>   Many in this Muslim nation, sandwiched between Iran and Russia,
have expressed faint optimism about the pipeline and the possibility
that it will bring some economic income. Yet they hold no illusions
that anyone other than the leadership, a few oil tycoons with
government contacts and the West will benefit. How could they? Gas
prices here, right outside oil fields and refineries, are exactly
what they are in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The Muslims here are moderate and want to give the West the
benefit of the doubt, but the underlying view by many is that the
U.S., under the leadership of a former oil boss, will go to any
length--even 1,100 miles of inhospitable territory--to keep oil
prices down.</TE>
<TE>   Lost in the debates about Iraq, the war on terrorism and the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict is the underlying fact that Muslims'
exasperation with the U.S. goes much deeper than any of these issues.</TE>
<TE>   If you scratch below the surface, you find what really bothers
moderate Muslims: It is that the average American believes it is his
or her God-given right to have gasoline at about $1 a gallon and to
own a sport utility vehicle; and that practically no one in the U.S.
knows or cares that their government overlooks the practices of
brutal regimes in places such as Myanmar or Equatorial Guinea in the
name of cheap gasoline.</TE>
<TE>   For every American who even knows where Equatorial Guinea is,
there are 1,000 Muslims who not only know where it is but view
Western oil practices there as exploitive.</TE>
<TE>   For many Muslims here and around the world, places such as Kabul
seem just as far away and unknown as they did to Americans before
Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   However, when you face daily exploitation, by politically corrupt
regimes propped up by the West and by the misuse of resources right
outside your window, you become angry. Maybe not to the point of
taking action, but there are millions of moderate Muslims who are
nonetheless angry inside. These are precisely the people the U.S.
must win over if the war on terrorism or any long-term plans for the
Mideast are to succeed.</TE>
<TE>   From a strictly economic point of view, the pipeline probably
makes a lot of sense--the oil companies would not build it if it
didn't. However, my worry is that the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline is
symbolic of the perception problems the U.S. is facing in the Muslim
world. Washington needs to recognize the perception problem it has
with moderate and liberal Muslims and take immediate actions to
remedy the situation.</TE>

<HD>Ryder Shoplifting Case Steals the Scene</HD>
<DH>Prosecution of the actress shines an unflattering spotlight
on D.A.'s office.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOEL MOWBRAY</AU>
<BD>Joel Mowbray is a reporter for National Review and
contributing editor to nationalreview.com. E-mail:
jdmowbra@erols.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the public spectacle masquerading as a shoplifting trial for
actress Winona Ryder, the prosecution will complete its 10-month
quest to finally bring a celebrity to "justice."</LD>
<LD>   Whether or not Ryder turns out to be an innocent victim of
circumstances, the whole mess has already claimed a victim: the
public.</LD>
<LD>   Even though cynics scoff at the idea of sympathy for celebrities,
most taxpayers should be outraged at the unprecedented expenditure of
resources to relentlessly pursue a relatively minor case against
someone with no criminal record.</LD>
<TE>   In the three months before a June court date, the office of L.A.
County Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley assigned one attorney nothing but the
preparation for a preliminary hearing on a shoplifting case.</TE>
<TE>   To put this in perspective, a typical deputy D.A. would deal with
20 to 30 cases a day during the same three-month time span in which a
staffer focused solely on a single pretrial hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Some lawyers in the district attorney's office are fed up with
what they see as prosecutorial zeal.</TE>
<TE>   One deputy D.A., who asked not to be named, said the aggressive
actions are not sitting well with his colleagues: "Most of the
lawyers here think this is just a spectacle--and an utterly
ridiculous waste of resources for such a petty case."</TE>
<TE>   Yet there were at least eight lawyers and paralegals working
full-time in the frenzied few weeks leading up to today's trial--a
little less than one attorney for each item allegedly stolen.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office has pursued its case against Ryder
with a tenacity typically reserved for murderers. In fact, the
prosecution has literally put the Ryder case ahead of murder cases.</TE>
<TE>   The lead deputy D.A. assigned to Ryder's case is trying to
postpone a murder trial so she can fulfill her duties prosecuting the
shoplifting charge.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, though, the D.A.'s office had issued a press release
stating its "strong objection" to Ryder's attorney requesting a
continuance in May so that he could defend a client in a murder case.</TE>
<TE>   In short, the D.A. criticized Ryder's attorney for seeking a
continuance in a shoplifting matter to handle a murder trial, while
his office sought a continuance in a murder case to try a shoplifting
charge.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the prosecution's publicly aired "case" amounts to
almost all smear and no substance. It is entirely possible that Ryder
did steal several items from Saks, but the district attorney has
waged a public campaign that would minimize the possibility of
finding an open-minded jury.</TE>
<TE>   Since her Dec. 12 arrest, Ryder has been portrayed by prosecutors
as a serial shoplifter with a drug habit who was caught red-handed on
camera. Yet the facts tell a different story.</TE>
<TE>   The cheapest personal shot is the attempt to paint her as a junkie
because she had two individual pills of endocet, which even the
prosecution concedes is the generic version of Percocet--a drug for
which she has a prescription.</TE>
<TE>   Then there are the prosecutors' public hints that they have
evidence showing that the actress has a history of shoplifting.</TE>
<TE>   Both of these "prior bad acts," however, boil down to a single
witness in each case cryptically stating that maybe Ryder had taken a
single item, or was intending to do so.</TE>
<TE>   Ryder has never been arrested or detained, even by private
security. In other words, there is no there there.</TE>
<TE>   The most damning lingering rumor is that Ryder can be seen on
surveillance tape clipping sensor tags off the Saks merchandise.
Truth is, no such evidence exists.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the D.A. admitted at the preliminary hearing in June
that the tape had no "gotcha" moment, the coverage of this admission
received far less attention than other aspects of the case.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, this case appears to be less about justice than
politics.</TE>
<TE>   "This is Hollywood, and the D.A. is putting on a show for the
voters," one deputy D.A. said.</TE>

<LD>Enough debating--let's invade Iraq today. Invading Iraq will set the
Iraqi people free, prevent future nuclear and biological terrorism
and boost U.S. military morale. Most important, invading sovereign
nations is fun. I would rather sit with my kids and watch U.S. troops
march up and down Baghdad with color commentary from Sean Hannity and
Bill O'Reilly than spend four hours watching the Giants mud-wrestle
the Eagles.</LD>
<LD>   But why stop at Iraq? So many invadeable countries are out there,
waiting for us:</LD>
<LD>   Maldives. This small, helpless Indian island paradise will make a
wonderful stopover for stressed-out Army rangers. Someone stole my
suitcase when I stayed there years ago, and not one person on the
whole disagreeable island helped me, so the payback, no matter how
regrettably delayed, will be sweet.</LD>
<TE>   Australia. Beyond reproach in friendship and loyalty, the Aussies
have turned in a disappointing performance, given the bounty of an
entire continent to despoil. Vegemite, Men at Work, Olivia
Newton-John--the sum total of two centuries of industrial and
intellectual development? Sorry, mates.</TE>
<TE>   Norway. The Norwegians are friendly, capable and
self-sufficient--perfect cover for a sleeping enemy. The nation-state
equivalent of the kid who keeps his head down and sits in the back
row, Norway has ducked the global spotlight for 50 years. Note: Let's
stock up on ice for the future water shortage.</TE>
<TE>   Saudi Arabia. Militarily, usurping this kingdom amounts to little
more than a milk run on the convoy home from Baghdad. Politically,
morally and philosophically, the value of the Saudis as friend or foe
can be debated, but, walletarily, debate this: 49 cents a gallon!</TE>

<HD>Iron Felix Should Be Left to Rust</HD>
<DH>Russia shouldn't revive the KGB founder's image.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHRYN STONER-WEISS</AU>
<BD>Kathryn Stoner-Weiss is an assistant professor of
politics and international affairs at Princeton University.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the United Nations debated what to do about Saddam Hussein,
history was being remade in Russia. The popularly elected mayor of
Moscow, Yuri M. Luzhkov, in an apparent change of heart, announced
his approval for the resurrection of one of the most compelling
symbols of evil of the Soviet state: an imposing statue of the
founder of the dreaded KGB, Felix Dzerzhinsky.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush has said that he looked into the soul of Russian
President Vladimir V. Putin and liked what he saw. But as Bush and
his national security team speak with Putin and with Russia's foreign
and defense ministers, they should be mindful of what the return of
"Iron Felix" might mean for Russia's still fragile democracy and
future as a friend to the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   Like Hussein, Dzerzhinsky effectively waged war on his own people.
Historians estimate that his secret police were responsible for
thousands of deaths in the years after the Bolshevik seizure of power
in 1917. The institution he founded was directly responsible for the
deaths of millions of Soviet citizens.</LD>
<TE>   A 30-foot iron statue of Dzerzhinsky was erected in 1958 outside
the Lubyanka prison, headquarters of the KGB. "Iron Felix" stood in
the middle of Lubyanka Square, an unwavering symbol of the power of
the Soviet state and its repressive apparatus, until it was torn down
in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   The fall of Iron Felix was a bold declaration that KGB repression
would have no role in Russia's democratic future.</TE>
<TE>   Given that Luzhkov has twice before declared that the statue would
never again find a place of honor in the new Russia, it is hard not
to see Putin's hand in the resurrection of Iron Felix. After all,
prior to ascending to the presidency of Russia, Putin briefly served
as head of Russia's Federal Security Service, the post-Soviet KGB.
And before the demise of the Soviet Union, he was a KGB spy.</TE>
<TE>   A close reading of Putin's autobiography, "First Person," reveals
that even while deputy mayor of St. Petersburg in the early 1990s, he
was still informing for the KGB. As recently as 1999, Putin was
rumored to have a small bust of Dzerzhinsky on his desk.</TE>
<TE>   Putin has encouraged Russians to think that not all of Soviet
history was bad. He has tried to establish a new, healthy Russian
nationalism in the wake of a decade of difficult transition that has
thrown about a third of his post-communist comrades into poverty.</TE>
<TE>   But in turning to Iron Felix, Putin's Russia is appealing to
exactly the wrong elements of the Soviet past.</TE>
<TE>   At a time when political pluralism, freedom of the press and
freedom of expression are in serious doubt in Russia, the possible
resurrection of Iron Felix does great damage to concepts and values
that should be at the heart of Russian democracy: equality before the
law, the presumption of innocence and even freedom of speech.</TE>
<TE>   These are all freedoms and values that Dzerzhinsky, and the KGB he
built, violently and brutally opposed.</TE>
<TE>   Reviving Iron Felix, then, is not only an insult to the memories
of the millions of victims of the KGB but also a challenge to the
very legitimacy of Russia's new democracy. When Bush peered into
Putin's soul, did he see this?</TE>

<HD>New Taxation Through Legal Representation</HD>
<DH>States scrambling to make up budget shortfalls are playing
litigation lotto.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN TURLEY</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Turley is a law professor at George
Washington University.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Outside of Las Vegas is a little pawn shop that does big business. It
buys everything from jewelry to cowboy boots to dentures from broke
gamblers who need money for gas to get home. It is a testament to the
rule that where there are fools, there are opportunities.</LD>
<LD>   This month, the pawn business has moved into the big time. Broke
state officials across the country have been looking for businesses
to buy their assets at a fraction of their worth to pay for budget
shortfalls.</LD>
<LD>   Like every itinerant gambler, they want to avoid facing the public
with the news that they bet on the economy and lost in a big way.</LD>
<TE>   Looking around for things to sell, many states have quickly
latched onto their most valuable movable commodity: tobacco damages.
This is fitting because states first won, and then squandered,
billions in windfall damages to their residents.</TE>
<TE>   This scandal began when state leaders cut outrageous contingency
deals with private lawyers that guaranteed fees as high as a billion
dollars. Rather than using government lawyers for these lawsuits,
politicians allowed private attorneys to pocket billions in damages
suffered by citizens. Then, flush with the expected cash from the
settlements, state officials spent wildly.</TE>
<TE>   When the economy soured, they woke up with a huge budget headache
and an unpaid bill.</TE>
<TE>   Now these same leaders are selling off the remaining awards for a
fraction of their worth to make up for budget shortfalls.</TE>
<TE>   In return for ready cash now, the states trade away the full value
of damages to be paid over time. Thus, residents in some states may
receive as little as 25% of the damages that they incurred through
smoking, while attorneys and businesses could receive the other 75%.</TE>
<TE>   Take Maryland. Lawyer Peter G. Angelos was given a contract to pay
him 25% of the state's damages, or about $1 billion. (Angelos
recently agreed to accept the paltry sum of $150 million in fees.)
Lt. Gov. Kathleen Townsend, who is running for governor, now has
proposed selling off some of the remaining damages at 72 cents on the
dollar. She is not alone. Fifteen other states have sold off these
damages at discounts as low as 25 cents on the dollar.</TE>
<TE>   This may be one reason why states are looking for new litigation
prospects. State governments are crowding into courtrooms seeking
damages for products ranging from paint to guns.</TE>
<TE>   It is part of a new era of government revenue generation: seeking
millions not in taxation but in litigation.</TE>
<TE>   The result is a type of government ambulance chasing that would
make the most hardened slip-and-fall lawyer blush.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Rhode Island and other states have sued paint
companies for their use of lead paint in public housing and
government buildings.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit suggests that the dangers from lead were known long
before lead paint was banned. Yet this ignores the fact that the
government had much of the same available knowledge and decided to
use the paint anyhow. Moreover, the injuries to children in public
housing were in part caused by a failure of the state in allowing
walls to crumble without new paint or maintenance.</TE>
<TE>   In California and other states, gun manufacturers are the
designated defendants of the day.</TE>
<TE>   State officials argue that gun manufacturers should be liable for
violent crimes and should pay them hundreds of millions of dollars.
One common claim is that these companies should have better monitored
the use of their guns in crime and avoided selling to dealers
responsible for such sales.</TE>
<TE>   Once again, however, the question is the government's own
responsibility. The government could demand the same information and
regulate gun licenses based on improper sales. It could also outlaw
handguns.</TE>
<TE>   There is nothing more dangerous than a politician short of cash.</TE>
<TE>   Hope springs eternal in litigation lottery. The question is
whether citizens will impose some discipline on their leaders and
stop the litigation-liquidation cycle. First, however, they will have
to catch them. These days, every sound of an ambulance siren can
empty out an entire state Legislature.</TE>

<LD>Here's the war report from home: Consumers have been in the trenches
battling a double-dip recession with their own spending, but they may
be starting to lose the struggle. Congress is caught up in the White
House's obsession with Saddam Hussein, and neither the administration
nor lawmakers are doing anything significant to battle the slump.</LD>
<LD>   Far from being isolated from the economy, a war with Iraq is
linked to it. The prospect of war is increasing business and investor
uncertainty. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that war could
cost the U.S. as much as $9 billion a month. Oil prices could shoot
up as well. The cost of reconstructing Iraq is unclear, but would be
significant. Partly because of the threat of war, the U.S., Japanese
and European economies are seeing a contraction in manufacturing
demand. Businesses are taking a wait-and-see stance.</LD>
<LD>   The economic numbers are so anemic that normally they would be
impossible to ignore. Last year, the number of Americans living in
poverty increased from 31.6 million to 32.9 million. Median household
income declined 2.2%. The ranks of the uninsured increased by 1.4
million, to 41.2 million. Car sales are slumping despite continued
loan rate-cutting, and retailers are anticipating a dismal Christmas.</LD>
<TE>   Congress and the Bush administration should take more steps to
increase confidence in the economy and to stimulate it, beginning
with the corporate reforms that have somehow evaporated. The Bush
administration has failed to back legislation requiring companies to
report stock options as expenses, for example. Legislation to make
401(k) pension investments more worker-friendly is stuck in Congress;
tough restrictions on offshore tax havens have gone nowhere. A
handcuffed Andrew S. Fastow, former chief financial officer of Enron,
doing the perp walk Wednesday makes a good photo op but doesn't fool
investors.</TE>
<TE>   Nor has Congress put its own financial house in order. It keeps
passing stopgap measures to avoid a government shutdown, but it
hasn't approved any of 13 required spending bills. It's also the case
that in the next five months, about 3 million workers and their
families risk losing unemployment benefits unless Congress extends a
temporary program providing extra weeks of benefits.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration and the House are proposing to boost
spending on homeland security but cut spending on higher education,
job training, public housing, community health centers and child
care. It is social spending, however, that most quickly alleviates
the worst effects of an economic slowdown and stimulates the economy.</TE>
<TE>   The White House and lawmakers need to give consumers some
ammunition to fight against an economic downturn. Otherwise, all
they'll be waving is a white flag.</TE>

<LD>A shortened school calendar. Children encouraged to create more and
think up their own projects. A move away from high-stakes testing in
public schools and toward fostering "zest for living." More local
control over what students learn and when. This seemingly
1970s-vintage recipe is a tsunami of change for Japanese public
schools--the very schools that reformers in the U.S. had held up as a
model of academic rigor and emphasis on basics.</LD>
<LD>   As it turns out, while American parents and businesses have been
fretting about kids who aren't gaining the academic skills needed to
succeed in global markets, Japanese parents and businesses have been
worried about teen stress and suicide, soaring dropout and truancy
rates and a lack of the creativity needed to succeed in global
markets. The full slate of reforms started this school year, which in
Japan means back in April. As outlined in Education Week, the biggest
change has been to shrink the school week from six days to five. The
national requirement for what students must learn each year also
shrank by almost a third. And a new study period allows students to
set up their own courses in nontraditional subjects, such as the
environment or ethnic diversity.</LD>
<TE>   There's a lesson in all this for school reformers on both sides of
the Pacific. Education clings to an ever-swinging pendulum: The vogue
is phonics, then whole-language reading instruction, now phonics
again. The same for interdisciplinary learning, dress codes and
lockers: Now you see them, now you don't.</TE>
<TE>   This doesn't mean the time has come for American schools to shed
standardized testing and bring kindergarten back to the days of
cookies and naps. Japan's infatuation with childhood creativity comes
from a different starting point: Its children already know how to
read and calculate.</TE>
<TE>   It would be a shame, though, to forget about the value of
fostering thoughtfulness and individuality in the schools, or to push
out of alignment the more rounded lives American children lead, with
time for extracurricular activities and undirected play. Politicians
will have to be smart enough this time to stop the pendulum at the
right point, before it reaches another extreme.</TE>

<LD>The United Nations, spurred by Washington, is pushing Iraq to let
inspectors scour the country for its biological and chemical weapons.
But what Iraq has may be peanuts compared with the stockpiles in
Russia.</LD>
<LD>   Inside Russia--but not far from Afghanistan--are 2 million
artillery shells filled with nerve gas such as VX and sarin. The
United States has spent hundreds of millions of dollars to design a
plant to destroy those chemical weapons before they fall into the
hands of other nations or terrorists. But for the last three years,
Congress has blocked additional spending and some involved in
building the facility are now being laid off.</LD>
<LD>   The main bottleneck is in the U.S. House of Representatives. It
should agree to resume funding for the plant in the Russian town of
Shchuch'ye, near the border with Kazakhstan, that would destroy the
deadly armaments.</LD>
<TE>   Since the Cold War ended, the United States has helped finance
Russia's destruction of nearly 6,000 nuclear warheads once aimed at
the U.S. Hundreds of missiles, launchers and missile-firing
submarines also have been destroyed. The Bush administration deserves
praise for supporting this program.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. record on destroying chemical weapons like those in
Russia is dismal, thanks to congressional reluctance to spend
promised funds on destruction.</TE>
<TE>   For the sake of comparison, U.N. inspectors reported in 1999, soon
after they left Iraq for the last time, that Baghdad had not
accounted for at least 15,000 artillery rockets that had been its
preferred delivery method for nerve gas and for more than 500
artillery shells filled with mustard agents. There is little doubt
Iraq has continued producing sarin and VX gases in the years since,
but the Russian stockpile would be hard to match.</TE>
<TE>   A State Department official said last month that the United States
has spent more than $6 billion to ensure that nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons materials and technology in the former Soviet
Union are safe from theft or surreptitious sales by underpaid workers
in economically ravaged nations. That's money well spent.</TE>
<TE>   Several Republican congressmen have complained, however, that
Russia has not fully accounted for all weapons of mass destruction
and has not provided practical plans for destroying those they agreed
to scrap.</TE>
<TE>   Congress in 1993 required that the president certify that states
of the former Soviet Union were spending money to destroy weapons and
were not replacing them before the U.S. allotted money for
destruction. The president was allowed to waive certification if need
be, but Republicans on the House Armed Services Committee have
ordered additional conditions before U.S. money can be spent on
destroying Russian chemical weapons.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration is seeking the ability to waive those
conditions as well if national security so requires. Some conditions
are difficult or impossible to meet, such as a minute detailing of
the stockpile that former Democratic Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia says
the Russians may not have or be able to put together.</TE>
<TE>   Congress should grant at least a temporary waiver, preferably a
permanent one. The longer the weapons exist, even in heavily guarded
facilities thought to be secure, the greater the danger an enemy
nation or terrorists will acquire them.</TE>

<LD>Re "New Alliance Rises to Fight Secession," Oct. 1: Shame on The
Times for writing such a one-sided article. The assumption is that
anyone opposed to secession has some self-interest. That couldn't be
further from the truth. I am running the Public Safety Coalition
campaign because I am a lifelong Valley resident who feels strongly
about remaining in Los Angeles. I fought the secession movement in
the 1970s as a Valley political activist and have always believed in
one Los Angeles. What the article failed to mention is that those in
Valley VOTE have spent two years hiding their money sources. Why are
they embarrassed? What terrible special-interest money is pushing
secession?</LD>
<LD>   Steven Afriat</LD>
<LD>   Sherman Oaks</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The anti-secession fund-raising alliance of L.A. City Council
members Jack Weiss, Cindy Miscikowski and Jan Perry with downtown
lobbyists who represent a wide array of special interests shows the
most callous disregard for the current reform-minded mood of the
people of L.A. While our citizenry may or may not agree that Valley
secession is the answer, few disagree that a City Hall dominated by
lobbyists is a huge part of the problem. Looking at this so-called
Public Safety Coalition, it's hard to see how lobbyists for cable
companies, developers and landfill operators fit under its umbrella
but easy to see how some might view this as a transparent example of
special interests banding together to protect their stranglehold on
City Hall. For City Council members to depend on lobbyists this way
to fund their fight against secession further compromises their
objectivity and the people's faith in the system.</TE>
<TE>   The creation of this unholy alliance underscores the urgent need
for reform. A good starting point would be the passage of the measure
proposed by the Ethics Commission but tabled by the council that
would require council members to recuse themselves from votes on
issues that involve the political consultants/lobbyists who helped
them get elected. This could be an important first step of so much
that remains to be done, whether secession passes or not.</TE>

<LD>I loved your very well researched and fascinating "Ukulele Strikes a
New Chord" (Oct. 1). I came back from my Hawaiian vacation this
summer with a ukulele, which my teenage boys and I could not stop
strumming all the way home. Every evening in Maui we were serenaded
by yet another group of ukulele-strumming songsters, and I fell in
love with the gentle genre. I now constantly play the CD I bought
featuring the world's "biggest" star, "Iz" [Israel Kamakawiwo'ole],
and his ukulele, whenever I need soothing or to just recall that
Hawaiian feeling.</LD>

<HD>Illegal Immigration: L.A. Is the Doorstep</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the Oct. 2 installment of "Enrique's Journey," the following
appeared: "Chiapas is fed up with Central American immigrants, says
Hugo Angeles Cruz, a professor and migration expert at El Colegio de
la Frontera Sur in Tapachula."</LD>
<LD>   I have news for him. Southern California is pretty fed up with it
too. While The Times' article goes to great lengths to explain the
impoverished plight of illegal immigrants, the fact remains that they
are, indeed, illegal immigrants. I realize that is a concept that is
rather difficult for many to grasp in these bleeding-heart-liberal
politically correct times.</LD>
<LD>   If you want to know why housing in Southern California is
unaffordable for most of us, and why finite resources of everything
ranging from clean drinking water, electricity, food, gasoline and
education are in short supply and/or more expensive, perhaps at least
some of the blame can be placed at the doorstep of illegal
immigration. It also explains why sections of downtown Los Angeles
look more like Tapachula, and one can now hear roosters crowing from
City Hall. Oh yeah, right. I forgot. It's all part of the
wonderfulness of "cultural diversity."</LD>
<TE>   Chiapas being fed up with Central American immigrants has to be,
without a doubt, the ultimate irony. Obviously, there are those who
feel Mexico shouldn't have to shoulder the burden of illegal
immigration. After all, that's the exclusive franchise of the United
States, isn't it?</TE>
<TE>   David Arthur</TE>
<TE>   Colton</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I have been so deeply moved and impressed by Sonia Nazario's
series on Enrique, the young Honduran emigrant struggling through
terrible obstacles. As a sixth-generation Californian, a small and
hateful part of me wants to shut down the borders and preserve our
staggering wealth for a few. The bigger and better part of me knows
that justice demands that we radically rethink our immigration policy
so that we can welcome into our lands the millions of Enriques.</TE>
<TE>   But we cannot merely throw open our borders. We must rethink our
lifestyles, the maintenance of which is the root cause of so much of
the poverty of countries like Honduras. Then and only then will the
forces be reduced that drive so many to come here at such terrible
cost.</TE>
<TE>   Hugo Schwyzer</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Enrique's is a sad story that would have never taken place if the
federal and state governments had enforced the immigration laws so
that his mother wasn't here in the first place. On illegal
immigration, The Times has tried to make us the enemy, instead of the
irresponsible lawbreakers.</TE>

<LD>Re "White House Economic Policies Are Bankrupt," Commentary, Oct. 2:
Joseph Stiglitz has it turned around. Those on the Bush team came to
power with a preconceived agenda. Their tax cut was at the top of the
list, and they utilized whatever the current situation presented to
achieve it. The tax cut was, by turns, pushed as the solution to
keeping the economy booming, then preventing recession and now moving
the country toward recovery. In reality, the tax cut was seen by
these people as an end all by itself. Whatever economic situation the
country happened to be in at the time was just the window dressing
used to push the real agenda: Pass the tax cut.</LD>
<LD>   In similar fashion, a war in Iraq is being pushed as the solution
to rid the world of Saddam Hussein and his supposed weapons of mass
destruction.</LD>
<LD>   The Bush people are desperately trying to link Hussein with Al
Qaeda and 9/11, but once more, this is just window dressing to enlist
popular support. The war is really about controlling the region's oil
and establishing American dominance, not only over the Middle East
but over the entire world. Hussein is just a convenient puppet or
boogeyman, who we created and who is useful for this one last
purpose.</LD>
<TE>   Kirk Evans</TE>
<TE>   Canoga Park</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Stiglitz should have his tenure terminated for this biased attack.
While President Bush may not deserve better than a C grade, he
certainly has not failed in the face of the conditions he inherited
from President Clinton and the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. The tax
cut was broader and, therefore, more effective in boosting a slowing
economy than anything funneling money directly to the states could
have done for the same price in the same time window. The Ferrari
analogy is inappropriate.</TE>
<TE>   The attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, caused a serious redirection of
attention by the government. Resources were reallocated to
accommodate the needs of the country. Another impact was the
devastating blow to the psyches of the people and the economic
fallout hitting an already struggling economy. We serenely thought
the government had protections in place to deal with the brazen
corporate crooks. They crossed lines thought unbreachable. Bush
didn't cross the line. He is rightfully demanding punishment for the
bad guys. Everyone deserves a piece of the blame, including the
president, Congress--and Stiglitz, for not recognizing the storm
clouds over the economy as Clinton's chairman of the Council of
Economic Advisors.</TE>

<LD>Re "Rising Above a Scandal" (Oct. 3), on the priestly misconduct at
St. Edward Church in Dana Point: One of the parishioners said, "I
don't come here for a priest. I come here for God." Another
parishioner implies that with all the misdeeds, the spirituality is
still there. Really? Most parishioners interact with a priest when
they come to church for Mass or confession. The church teaches that
the priest celebrates the sacraments of Mass and penance for the
flock "in persona Christi" and is the face of Christ for the
parishioners. When the "face of Christ" is arrested for child
molestation, what spirituality is left for the parishioner?</LD>

<LD>Re "Democrats Pick Lautenberg to Replace Torricelli," Oct. 2: How
many Democrats does it take to hold the New Jersey Supreme Court
justices' noses? It reminds me of the days after World War II--how
the Soviet-ruled governments made up the laws and regulations as they
went along. They paved the way for the complete takeover of the Iron
Curtain countries. The elections were fraudulent also. I hope the New
Jerseyites are happy. Unfortunately, there is more at stake this
time. It affects not just one state but the entire country. Aren't we
ever going to learn from history?</LD>

<HD>Rapid Transit Needed Along Existing Freeways</HD>

<LD>How many more times do the voters of Southern California have to
flush down the costly schemes of additional subway construction
before it finally goes away ("MTA Subway Plan Faces Many Hurdles,"
Oct. 2)? The only new rapid transit that makes any sense is a rail
network down the middle of existing freeways (no costs for right of
ways, no tunneling, no disruption or termination of existing
businesses, no ridiculous $300 million spent for each mile). As for
train riders, imagine how many drivers who now use their autos only
to and from work downtown will switch when they are bumper to bumper
on the freeways and see commuters on the trains speeding by at 40 to
50 mph.</LD>
<LD>   Concerned voters should contact members of the MTA Board of
Directors, as well as appropriate elected officials, to enforce the
demonstrated will of the people who have overwhelmingly rejected
further wasteful subway construction.</LD>

<TE>   The Red Line subway is the most promising, forward-thinking
addition to the L.A. transportation system since the freeways were
built. Extending this line down Wilshire Boulevard, not just to LACMA
but through Beverly Hills, Westwood and Santa Monica, would eliminate
thousands of cars from the road per day.</TE>
<TE>   I sincerely hope that city, state and national representatives,
particularly Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), support the MTA
and help build Los Angeles the public transit system it should have
had 30 years ago. Gridlock and pollution are the worst things about
this great city, and the subway is the best way to get rid of them.</TE>

<HD>Irvine Mayor Has Become a Major Player</HD>
<DH>Campaign: Thanks in part to his leadership against El Toro
airport, Larry Agran is no longer on the fringe of Orange County
politics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Irvine Mayor Larry Agran's enemies brand him an opportunist, an
egoist--even a Marxist.</LD>
<LD>   They ask how conservative Irvine can get behind a man who ran for
president as a stand-in for George McGovern, had the city host
members of a baseball team from then-Marxist Nicaragua, and champions
a much-despised proposal for the Orange County CenterLine, which
would link the well-manicured sprawl of Irvine with urban Santa Ana
by light rail.</LD>
<LD>   "He's like the old Mayor Daley and Boss Tweed rolled into one,"
said Bill Mavity, treasurer of the anti-CenterLine group Fund
Alternatives Instead of Rail.</LD>
<TE>   The wonkish, soft-spoken mayor who casts himself as a populist
underdog says he has grown accustomed to the tags. But as he runs for
reelection as mayor, heading a slate of like-minded Irvine City
Council candidates, Agran has acquired a new label: Goliath. That's
what his opponent, Mike House, called him at a recent event.</TE>
<TE>   Strengthened by his leadership of the successful movement to kill
the proposed El Toro airport and instead build a "Great Park" at the
closed 4,700-acre Marine base, Agran has become a progressive titan
in a conservative area.</TE>
<TE>   "No one sees him as a peripheral force ... anymore," said Fred
Smoller, chairman of the political science department at Chapman
University. "This guy is a mainstream player in the county."</TE>
<TE>   Agran's political power has been cemented by his New
Democrat-style shift toward the center, including alliances with The
Irvine Co. and other power brokers he once railed against. His
willingness to shorten the proposed CenterLine route so that it
doesn't go through communities that oppose it has further undercut
his critics.</TE>
<TE>   But it remains to be seen whether Agran's coattails are long
enough to carry his slate of "Agranistas"--a label they defiantly
adopted following the Nicaragua incident--on to the City Council with
him come Nov. 5.</TE>
<TE>   A trio of opponents including House, who call themselves the New
Priorities Team, is seeking to take control of the city. Their
platform: The El Toro fight has been won and it is time for new
leadership focused on keeping taxes down and helping the city's
financially strapped schools instead of building transit-oriented
villages and holding taxpayer-sponsored multicultural events at City
Hall.</TE>
<TE>   "Larry's moving away from what people came to Irvine for," said
Christina Shea, a longtime Agran opponent and former mayor who is
running for City Council on the New Priorities slate. "They came for
this sprawled, beautiful place, with lots of green and houses set
back from the street. We are not into these high-density, no-cars
ideas.... People in Irvine like their cars."</TE>
<TE>   At a recent Chamber of Commerce candidates forum, Shea and running
mate Chuck DeVore sought to paint Agran's allies on the
ballot--Councilwoman Beth Krom and photo-processing store owner Mitch
Goldstone--as puppets.</TE>
<TE>   The four candidates are vying for two open council seats, along
with Linda Lee Grau, who is not affiliated with either slate.</TE>
<TE>   Agran's lone opponent in the race for mayor is House. But Shea and
DeVore directed their attacks at Agran during the forum.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor stood his ground, belittling the New Priorities
candidates for what he said was their promise to trim millions of
dollars worth of fat from the city budget. Exactly what fat were they
talking about, he asked. He seemed unimpressed by their vague
answers.</TE>
<TE>   He also said he resented the implication that he is a puppet
master controlling his allies on the council. "That is an insult to
our entire community," Agran said in a later interview.</TE>
<TE>   But even as Agran kept his cool, one of his Agranistas stumbled.</TE>
<TE>   Goldstone acknowledged--and later disavowed--a $50,000 loan from
an out-of-state uncle, which he reported as coming from himself.
State law does not allow candidates to misrepresent the source of
contributions. Such a contribution also would exceed the city's $340
limit.</TE>
<TE>   Campaign finance has become a key issue in the Irvine election,
with outside political action committees expected to pour tens of
thousands of dollars into advertising for both sides. Also getting
involved are nonprofit organizations with anonymous donors funding
large political mailings.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been ratcheted up to unbelievable levels," termed-out
Councilman Greg Smith said of the money it now takes to run a viable
campaign in Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   Smith contends that Agran's supporters are the ones who have
exploited loopholes in the city's campaign finance law, thereby
triggering a fundraising race. He says the mayor's vows to get money
out of politics are disingenuous. And he says the same thing about
Agran's promises on CenterLine.</TE>
<TE>   "This business about letting people decide whether it will go
through their neighborhoods is a whole lot of smoke," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Agran team says Smith and others are trying to create an issue
where one doesn't exist.</TE>
<TE>   "The reality is: CenterLine will go nowhere unless the residents
approve it," said Councilman Chris Mears, a close Agran ally who is
not up for reelection. "Our opponents are just trying to misconstrue
the facts so they seem to create some kind of threat to the city.
Nobody is going to force this down anybody's throat."</TE>
<TE>   It's not the CenterLine rhetoric that has annoyed the Agranistas
the most, however. The biggest annoyance is that their opponents are
trying to trumpet their role in killing the proposed El Toro airport.
Shea says she was instrumental in fighting the airport during her
term as mayor, and her running mates say they were at the front lines
as private citizens.</TE>
<TE>   "These people are like blisters," Agran said. "They show up after
all the hard work is done. I don't recall a single instance in which
they took part in that campaign."</TE>
<TE>   El Toro remains at the top of Agran's platform. He insists that
the airport threat is not gone. He has been promising voters that if
reelected, he will personally be involved in ripping out the runways
with a jackhammer within months.</TE>
<TE>   "Here we are having marched 90 yards down the field and I am
determined not to fumble the ball heading into the end zone," Agran
said. "If my opponents are saying the airport is already dead, they
are betraying an ignorance that is shocking."</TE>
<TE>   Smoller says Agran is smart to keep pounding on the airport theme.</TE>
<TE>   "The Great Park thing has been an amazing victory, and it was his
vision," Smoller said. "Voters will reward that kind of
effectiveness."</TE>
<TE>   Yet others bristle when Agran is cast as a visionary--and not only
those from the right.</TE>
<TE>   Former close Agran aide Stephen Smith accuses Agran of selling out
on his way to the political center. He said he was shocked to learn
that the mayor was accepting campaign contributions from Irvine Co.
executives at the same time that the company had a high-density
development proposal before the city that will increase its
population by a third. The proposal was approved unanimously by the
City Council in June</TE>
<TE>   "He would never have done that a decade ago," Smith said of
Agran's push to get the development approved.</TE>
<TE>   Agran says the development on unincorporated land has been part of
the city's General Plan for years and will preserve open space. If
city officials had rejected it, he said, theIrvine Co. could have
simply taken its proposal to county officials and gotten approval for
an even bigger development.</TE>

<HD>U.S. to Give Beacons Away</HD>
<DH>Landmarks: Lighthouses at Point Sur and Pigeon Point will
be among the first to be transferred to states and local groups.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLY ANN CONNELL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>POINT SUR, Calif.</DL>
<LD>They are remnants of a bygone era, the solitary towers with their
beacons, sprinkled along the Pacific Coast. For years, the federal
government has continued to own dozens of increasingly dilapidated
lighthouses in California, and hundreds along America's coasts
overall.</LD>
<LD>   But now the U.S. Department of the Interior has announced that it
is placing on a fast track a plan to give away lighthouses. It is
starting with 20 lights, including the Pigeon Point Lighthouse and
the Point Sur Lighthouse at the northern end of the Big Sur Coast.</LD>
<LD>   The federal agency says lighthouses, while still serving as
navigational aids, have principally become historic and tourist
sites. It says those functions can best be put in the hands of states
and local groups.</LD>
<TE>   News of the impending U.S. giveaway startled some lighthouse
aficionados across the country, a deeply committed group that follows
and cares for favorite lighthouses like old friends.</TE>
<TE>   But state officials and local volunteers in California say that
there is no cause for alarm and that they will continue to care for
and restore the two lighthouses that are landmarks just off
California 1. The state Department of Parks &amp; Recreation owns the
land surrounding both Point Sur and Pigeon Point light, which is near
Pescadero, south of San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Despite some news accounts that made it appear such lighthouses
might simply go to the highest bidder--ending up as hotels or private
homes--the two California landmarks are expected to remain in the
care of the state and devoted followers. Private owners will have the
chance to acquire lighthouses around the nation, but only as a last
recourse and with tight strictures on how the properties can be used.</TE>
<TE>   A federal law in 2000 gave public agencies and nonprofit groups
priority in the maintenance of the lights, with potential private
owners considered only if those entities are not interested.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been our unwritten intention for some time to get those
two lighthouses," said Roy Stearns, spokesman for the state parks
system. "Nobody had formalized a proposal to get them, so we've been
caught a little off-guard by being forced to deal with it now."</TE>
<TE>   The suddenness of the lighthouse giveaway follows the Department
of Interior's recent announcement that it would search for new
operators to defray the substantial cost of using the aging lights.
While the buildings and surrounding properties shift to new
operators, the beacons will continue to be operated by the Coast
Guard as navigational aids.</TE>
<TE>   The Interior Department plans to "give away" 300 lighthouses in
all over the next 10 years, hoping that local governments and private
nonprofit groups can raise the substantial funds needed to preserve
the structures.</TE>
<TE>   The federal official who is leading the effort to find new owners
for the lights said local groups should not fear that all of the
cherished properties will be snapped up by private owners.</TE>
<TE>   "Since the program is based on preservation planning for these
lighthouses, past records showing commitment will certainly give a
natural advantage in the process," said Kevin Foster, chief of the
National Park Service's Maritime Heritage Program.</TE>
<TE>   State parks officials say such commitment has been in ample supply
in volunteers at Point Sur lighthouse, a striking outpost on the
coast for more than 100 years.</TE>
<TE>   The lighthouse and several support buildings stand on what appears
to be an enormous rock that juts into the Pacific Ocean.</TE>
<TE>   It largely has been the work of the Central Coast Lighthouse
Keepers Assn. that has kept the Point Sur buildings in their historic
condition.</TE>
<TE>   The group, mostly retirees, gathers regularly to scrape, paint and
rebuild the lighthouse and other structures. Members negotiate
contracts for the work they cannot do, such as removing lead paint.
They manage the lighthouse Web site. Many also work as state park
docents, giving three-hour tours on weekends.</TE>
<TE>   In one "banner year," the group raised $200,000 for work around
the property, said Doug Williams, treasurer of the organization. And
it's not atypical for the association to bring in $50,000 a year for
improvements.</TE>
<TE>   The group has become creative in raising funds for the light and
support buildings. When a cellular phone company approached the state
about placing a plain antenna at the site, the lighthouse keepers
quickly produced an alternate plan that resulted in a $110,000
restoration of a historic water tower, with the antenna inside, said
Williams, a Pebble Beach resident who is a retired professor from the
Naval Postgraduate School.</TE>
<TE>   Such restoration is not cheap. The volunteer organization has
raised the bulk of the money to rebuild the historic barn at Point
Sur for $500,000, after a 1998 storm, and to restore the carpenter's
shop for another $200,000. More recent projects have included the
restoration of the upper deck and lantern room of the lighthouse
itself for $300,000, Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   The group is poised to not miss a beat when the federal government
turns over control of the lighthouse. Williams said the association
members are a little insulted by e-mails on their Web site from
outsiders who say they would be interested in living at the
lighthouse, or running a bed and breakfast there.</TE>
<TE>   The recent Interior Department proposal is not the first to
suggest a transfer of Point Sur. During President Reagan's
administration, when James Watt was the secretary of the interior,
the Point Sur Lighthouse was put on the block for $1 million. But
there were no takers for the property, so isolated that water must be
trucked in.</TE>
<TE>   The Pigeon Point lighthouse on a bluff jutting out into the
Pacific Ocean to the north has also required substantial care in
recent years, with decay so severe that large chunks of iron and
brick fell off the tower last December, forcing the closing of part
of the grounds.</TE>
<TE>   "We've known that this lighthouse was going to be decommissioned
for some time," said Judy Pfeil, one of the senior volunteer docents
who leads tours at Pigeon Point, 50 miles south of San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   The 130-year-old lighthouse has one of the largest circular towers
on the West Coast, at 115 feet high.</TE>
<TE>   The support group expects that the end of federal control will
mean a state takeover--not the invasion of some private developer.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government is expected to declare the lighthouses
surplus within a month. Then would-be owners will have 60 days to
express interest in owning the lighthouses, according to the National
Park Service's Foster.</TE>
<TE>   The service's Maritime Division will go over the proposals and
possibly transfer control of the historic structures within a year,
Foster said.</TE>
<TE>   State parks officials say they will continue to look to private
groups to provide much of the care.</TE>
<TE>   And the support groups seem never to lack for volunteers, people
who become fascinated by buildings that offer a glimpse of the past.</TE>
<TE>   "Never in a million years would I have thought that I would become
so involved," said Cynthia Hudson, who took a break from washing the
visitor center windows at Point Sur. "But all it took was coming on
one tour, and I was absolutely hooked."</TE>

<LD>Andre Delvaux, 76, the Belgian director, scriptwriter and actor
considered the godfather of his country's film industry and revered
for bringing Belgian art films to international attention, died
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Delvaux died of a heart attack in Valencia, Spain, after giving a
speech at the World Arts Meeting.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Heverlee, near Louvain, Belgium, Delvaux studied German
philosophy at the Free University of Brussels and piano at Belgium's
Royal Conservatory. He fell in love with the cinema while working as
a pianist accompanying silent films.</LD>
<TE>   In 1960, Delvaux made a four-part series about Italian director
Federico Fellini for Belgian television. He followed that with
several more television series about film directors.</TE>
<TE>   By the mid-1960s, Delvaux himself was working on feature films.
His work shifted between dream and reality, and his style was quickly
labeled magic realism.</TE>
<TE>   Never a filmmaker for the masses but for the connoisseur of the
cinema, Delvaux won numerous international prizes, including a
British Academy Award for his first full-length film, "The Man Who
Had His Hair Cut Short," in 1965. Other films included "One Night ...
A Train" (1968), starring Yves Montand and Anouk Aimee, and "To Woody
Allen, From Europe With Love" (1980).</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Teresa "Tess" Russell, 81, a radio music librarian, talent
coordinator and producer of KMPC's "The Dick Wittinghill Show," died
Sept. 12 of heart failure at her home in Laguna Beach.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Manchuria and reared in China, she moved to Las Vegas in
1947, where she met and married conductor and composer George
Russell.</LD>
<LD>   After settling in Los Angeles in 1949, she became music librarian
at KLAC radio and three years later moved to KMPC, where she would
spend nearly three decades working with Wittinghill and lining up
talent for several programs. By 1980, she was music director of the
station and national director of artist relations for Al Ham's "Music
of Your Life."</LD>
<TE>   Russell worked for the last two decades of her life with the
Society of Singers to aid singers in need. She helped Ginny Mancini
organize the group in 1984 and served as its vice president of artist
relations. Russell recruited performers for annual fund-raising
events and for two CDs, "A Gift of Music" and "An All-Star
Christmas," that raised hundreds of thousands of dollars to assist
singers.</TE>
<TE>   Russell was also an active volunteer with the South Coast Medical
Center, helping to organize its gift shop. Los Angeles County
recognized her for Outstanding Accomplishments to Foster Children.</TE>

<AU>JANET WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Leo Hetzel opens the faded gray ledger.</LD>
<LD>   The first entry, dated 1959:</LD>
<LD>   Feb. 8 .85 (inch)</LD>
<TE>   The notations are talismans of the past, watermarks left by a
woman dead now for 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Elefrida McArthur lived in a tiny, broken-down cottage at the
confluence of Harding and Silverado creeks in eastern Orange County.
For 33 years--132 seasons--she kept the "rain book" for Modjeska
Canyon, a tightknit Santa Ana Mountains community.</TE>
<TE>   It made sense for Mrs. McArthur, as she was always called, to be
the one to keep the rain book. Her neighbors two doors down, who had
kept it for decades, had passed away. Her house was perched on an
embankment under a Roosevelt-era concrete bridge, in the flood plain
of the two creeks.</TE>
<TE>   Why keep a rain book in sunshine-filled Southern California? First
of all, it chronicles other things as well: drought, fire, quakes.</TE>
<TE>   But mainly, it is because there are seasons here along the rural
edge, where the waterways have never been encased in concrete. "Rainy
season" and "fire season" dance back and forth across the peaks,
scouring new terrain, threatening the tiny communities tucked below.</TE>
<TE>   When someone exclaims that surely this is the hottest, wettest,
windiest, all-around worst such weather ever, the book can be
consulted, the claim disproved--usually.</TE>
<TE>   February is indisputably always the rainiest, sluicing great
sheets across the narrow roads, dripping clammy fingers down your
back.</TE>
<TE>   McArthur began in February 1959, taking her readings at 8 a.m.
First page:</TE>
<TE>   Feb. 8 .85 (inch)</TE>
<TE>   9 .04</TE>
<TE>   11 1.44</TE>
<TE>   Page after page, month after month, she measured what fell into
tiny, calibrated plastic beakers in her backyard. For her, like
everyone in the canyon, the seasons ran from July 1 to June 30.</TE>
<TE>   68-69 Jan. 13 through 29</TE>
<TE>   Worst flood in 50 years. Part of Foster's house down. Much damage,
all in canyons. Our sea wall held except corner.</TE>
<TE>   Feb. 24 Killer flood. 5 houses down in Modjeska, scores more mud
damage. Silverado 1/3 homes lost. 5 deaths. 5.75 inches in 24 hours.</TE>
<TE>   Unwritten were the harsh details. Boulder-clogged creeks roared
like runaway freight trains through the night. Ropes of windy rain
lashed the steep, soggy mountain slopes. A giant live oak cracked and
tumbled downward, unleashing 20 tons of mud and water onto the
Silverado Canyon volunteer firehouse--perhaps the cruelest spot
possible, as five dozen neighbors had gathered there seeking refuge.
Marine helicopters worked through the howling darkness, airlifting
the wounded, a young woman in labor, the dead.</TE>
<TE>   Feb. 25 3.75 in.</TE>
<TE>   Feb. 26 4.00 inches.</TE>
<TE>   Feb. 27 Rain gauge gone down creek. could get no reading.</TE>
<TE>   More than 30 years later, Hetzel snorts at that inscription. "The
reason she couldn't get a reading is because her whole backyard was
gone. She was an old-fashioned American farm woman. She didn't panic
easy. She was tough."</TE>
<TE>   "My mother was very much a person of duty," said her son, Floyd
McArthur. "She was a person who always liked to read things, and
learn things."</TE>
<TE>   1979-80</TE>
<TE>   No rain 191 days. Very bad.</TE>
<TE>   Nov. 24 Fire. Trabuco. Almost to Modjeska. 28,090 acres. Indian
Truck Trail start. 6 fires around Orange, Riverside, LA, San Berno.</TE>
<TE>   Three cabins and four outbuildings were destroyed one canyon over.
Choking, acrid smoke burned the eyelids.</TE>
<TE>   1977-78</TE>
<TE>   Feb. 10 creek up 2.50 inches</TE>
<TE>   I lost 15 feet of my backyard + all the trees along the back</TE>
<TE>   April Leo and I put in gabion baskets, wall across our backyards</TE>
<TE>   It is Leo Hetzel's entrance into the journal. He and his wife,
Marija, eight months pregnant with their first child, had moved next
door in July.</TE>
<TE>   Jan. 1-5 I was gone. Leo took reading.</TE>
<TE>   Jan. 4, 1982. I got butted by the goat. Hurt my back, stayed with
Jean for 10 days.</TE>
<TE>   That's when Hetzel was entrusted with the rain record. "It was an
honor," he said. "Besides, it had to be done."</TE>
<TE>   In less than two weeks, McArthur was back on the job.</TE>
<TE>   On page 80 is McArthur's last entry, before her death.</TE>
<TE>   "I left two pages blank before I started mine," Hetzel says.</TE>
<TE>   The driest year on record since McArthur started the Modjeska rain
book was 2001-02: 6.92 inches. Deer and cougars crept down from the
mountains to canyon backyards, desperate for the water they smelled
in sprinklers and hoses.</TE>
<TE>   The last week of September, after days of triple-digit heat,
Hetzel took the book from its shelf and turned the pages slowly.
Within 24 hours, a long, black cloud blanketed Santiago Peak. Shortly
before 8 p.m., a steady, cool rain began. A benediction.</TE>

<HD>Hotel Secures a Place in History</HD>
<DH>Tourism: Downtown Ventura's Pierpont Inn, built in 1910, is
named to national registry, an honor that is likely to be a boon for
business.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KELLY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Pierpont Inn, way station and occasional home of celebrities and
future presidents for nearly a century, has been made a member of the
Historic Hotels of America.</LD>
<LD>   "Not only do we get a big shiny plaque, but it helps us market to
the rest of the country," said Cynthia Thompson, business development
coordinator for the Pierpont, on Sanjon Road in downtown Ventura.</LD>
<LD>   "There is a huge market for cultural tourism, especially after
Sept. 11," Thompson said. "Americans want to connect more with their
history."</LD>
<TE>   Of the 192 hotels listed by the Historic Hotels of America, 21 are
in California. Among them are the Ojai Valley Inn and Spa, the
Millennium Biltmore in Los Angeles and the El Encanto Hotel &amp; Villas
in Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   In order to be listed, a hotel must be more than 50 years old,
have a full-service restaurant and be designated as a historic site
in the city or county where it is located.</TE>
<TE>   "Marketing to the cultural tourist has becoming an increasingly
important part of our promotional effort," said Kathy Janega-Dykes,
executive director of the Ventura Visitors and Convention Bureau.
"California has the highest number of heritage travelers. They are
people interested in learning about the history of a community. The
Pierpont will benefit from this."</TE>
<TE>   Some travelers make a point of visiting all the hotels and inns
nationwide with the historic designation, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The Craftsman-style Pierpont, which has sweeping views of the
ocean, was commissioned in 1910 by Ojai socialite Josephine Pierpont,
who hired architect Sumner P. Hunt to build it.</TE>
<TE>   Pierpont predicted that the then-nascent automobile industry would
soon take off, and when it did, those traveling between Los Angeles
and Santa Barbara would want an elegant place to spend the night.</TE>
<TE>   She was right on both counts--cars multiplied, roads were built
and people sought out quiet hideaways up and down the coast.</TE>
<TE>   Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, Bette Davis, Bing Crosby and John
Travolta are just a few of the celebrities who have stayed at the
Pierpont, Thompson said.</TE>
<TE>   Former President George Bush lived at the 77-room Pierpont for a
time in 1949, along with his wife and son, now-President George W.
Bush. In those days, the elder Bush was learning the oil business in
petroleum-rich Ventura and Santa Barbara counties.</TE>
<TE>   These days, the inn is sometimes home for celebrities performing
with the Rubicon Theatre Company in Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   "I came here last fall to play at the Rubicon and I was struck by
what an extraordinary location this was," actor David Birney said
last week at a celebration honoring the inn's historic designation.
"This place, with its enormous legacy, supports the theater."</TE>
<TE>   Assemblywoman Hannah-Beth Jackson (D-Santa Barbara) spoke at the
celebration of the importance of local history.</TE>
<TE>   "It is so critical that we are able to take a step a back and
enjoy the traditions of what made us what we are," she told the 150
people gathered on the back terrace of the inn.</TE>
<TE>   After extensive renovations, Pierpont Inn &amp; Racquet Club co-owner
and managing partner Spencer Garrett applied for national historic
status, which was granted in July.</TE>
<TE>   Historic Hotels of America, based in Washington, D.C., is run by
the National Trust for Historic Preservation. The group serves as a
marketing tool for places like the Pierpont, said spokeswoman Mary
Billingsly.</TE>
<TE>   "Hotels seek us out to market their history; other times we seek
out hotels," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Color photos and descriptions of the Pierpont will be included in
a glossy booklet put out by the organization featuring each of its
member facilities.</TE>
<TE>   "Preservation pays," Thompson said. "It increases the identity of
a city, it creates a tourist attraction, it creates a sense of
community pride in the city and it creates a feeling of good will in
outsiders who visit the city."</TE>

<DL>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands</DL>
<LD>Prince Claus, the German-born husband of Queen Beatrix who employed
wit, charm and patience to overcome Dutch hostility and win the
affection of his adopted nation, died Sunday. He was 76.</LD>
<LD>   Claus had been in and out of intensive care for several months
with respiratory and heart problems. Doctors at the Amsterdam Medical
Center said he died of Parkinson's disease and pneumonia, according
to a government statement.</LD>
<LD>   "He was a remarkable man, who won a warm place in the hearts of
the Dutch people," Prime Minister Jan-Peter Balkenende said in a live
televised broadcast. "With his passing, a great man is gone."</LD>
<TE>   Beatrix, 64, and the royal couple's three sons were at Claus's
bedside when he died, Dutch television reported.</TE>
<TE>   It will be the first royal funeral since the death of Beatrix's
grandmother, Queen Wilhelmina, in 1962. Her mother, Queen Juliana,
abdicated in 1980. Claus' body will be taken to the royal palace in
The Hague on Monday, the government said. His body will be kept there
to let the public pay respects. Claus will be buried in the
Oranje-Nassau family tomb in Delft. No funeral date was set.</TE>
<TE>   Claus' entry into Dutch society was hard fought, because the
nation still bore scars inflicted by the Nazi army in which he had
served.</TE>
<TE>   It helped that he and the queen produced the first male heir,
Willem Alexander, to the Dutch throne in nearly a century. The couple
had two more sons, Prince Johan Friso and Prince Constantijn.</TE>
<TE>   Claus appeared frail during one of his last television appearances
in March 2001, when he and the queen announced the engagement of
Crown Prince Willem Alexander to an Argentinian investment banker,
Maxima Zorreguieta. Claus advised his prospective daughter-in-law to
learn the Dutch language and customs, as he had done 35 years
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Though born a German aristocrat, Claus showed a humility that
appealed to the unassuming Dutch. In 1997, he asked the public to
refrain from marking his birthday because it coincided with the
funeral of Britain's Princess Diana.</TE>
<TE>   During a speech at an African fashion show in 1998, Claus
expressed admiration for Nelson Mandela's casual style of dress. In
what he called "the Declaration of Amsterdam," he ripped off his own
necktie and tossed it at his wife's feet, calling it "a snake around
my neck."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Before casting a vote on the $3.4-billion water bond issue on the
November ballot, a reasonable voter might ask what California got for
the three other water bonds passed in the last six years.</LD>
<LD>   The answer isn't simple. The past bond sales didn't buy a big new
dam or reservoir to carry the state safely through drought.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, like cash hurled from a helicopter, the money has landed
in hundreds of scattered projects, including no-flush urinals in
Pasadena schools, $500 vouchers for coin-laundry owners in San Diego
and the planting of native willows along the San Joaquin River.</LD>
<TE>   Proposition 50 promises to be more of the same. Unusual in that it
was written by a small group of environmentalists, not hammered out
in the Legislature, the measure has nonetheless won the support of
much of the state's water industry. Backers call it a necessary
mortgage payment on a more drought-resistant, safe and
environmentally healthy water system.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents, including the California Farm Bureau Federation and the
California Taxpayers' Assn., say the latest bond measure once again
has plenty of money for preserving land, but not enough for
developing new sources of water.</TE>
<TE>   A September poll by the nonprofit Field Institute showed likely
voters were almost evenly divided on the measure. But television
advertising in support of the bond issue hasn't begun, and the Yes on
50 campaign has the generous support of a handful of developers who
stand to benefit from $950 million in bond sales earmarked for
purchase and restoration of coastal wetlands.</TE>
<TE>   Donors to a political committee established by the measure's chief
backer, the Planning and Conservation League, include the owners of
land at such preservation battlegrounds as the Bolsa Chica wetlands
in Orange County, the Ballona wetlands in West Los Angeles and the
Cargill Inc. salt ponds along San Francisco Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Ending Epic Struggles</TE>
<TE>   For example, Playa Capital Co., builder of a 1,087-acre
development near the Ballona wetlands, has donated $830,000 this year
to the Planning and Conservation League's Conservation Action Fund.
Signal Landmark, which is trying to build houses on the Bolsa Chica
mesa, gave $200,000.</TE>
<TE>   Other developers have donated to a separate political committee
run by the Trust for Public Land, which helped pay to qualify
Proposition 50 for the November ballot. One $25,000 donation came
from land speculator Brian A. Sweeney, who seeks to build mansions on
a rugged parcel north of Malibu coveted for preservation by the Santa
Monica Mountains Conservancy.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Caves, the league attorney who helped write the measure, said
the aim is to end several epic struggles over development along
California's coast.</TE>
<TE>   "The bulldozers are moving at Ballona, and the question is, can we
come up with a resolution ... so that we have, at the end of the day,
a chance to have a large, functioning, coastal wetland in Los
Angeles," said Caves. "That's key to the long-term environmental
health of the Santa Monica Bay, and if they put apartment buildings
all over it, that opportunity's lost."</TE>
<TE>   Environmental Focus</TE>
<TE>   The bond measure, Caves said, targets land for its ecological
value, not to win political donations from developers.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody has a guaranteed acquisition, nobody has a guaranteed
price," he said, noting that any land bought with bond money must go
through government review and appraisals.</TE>
<TE>   A good share of the bonds--$1.5 billion--is dedicated to local and
state agencies for desalinating ocean water, removing contaminants
such as perchlorate, upgrading water treatment plants, preventing
pollution and improving security at water structures.</TE>
<TE>   If past water bond sales are a guide, the money would be disbursed
through competitive grants to hundreds of projects such as drilling
wells in North Hollywood, retrofitting machines for developing X-ray
film so they use less water and installing temporary, inflatable dams
on the San Gabriel River to skim off water to be stored underground.</TE>
<TE>   Though there's no guarantee that voters will pass the measure, the
Legislature and governor are counting on it.</TE>
<TE>   On the last day of the legislative session, lawmakers dipped into
Proposition 50's hypothetical money. They passed a law, signed by
Gov. Gray Davis last month, that earmarks $150 million to help pay
for a transfer of water from the Imperial Irrigation District to San
Diego. That transfer is critical to helping the state meet a federal
deadline to reduce its Colorado River consumption.</TE>
<TE>   The governor has yet to take a position on the measure. But he
signed a bill that dedicates $50 million of the bond money to the
Salton Sea, which could become too salty to sustain fish if too much
water is transferred from the Imperial Valley.</TE>
<TE>   CalFed's Future</TE>
<TE>   A big chunk of Proposition 50--$825 million--would keep alive the
CalFed Bay-Delta Program, an ambitious, many-tentacled effort started
by former Gov. Pete Wilson and U.S. Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt
in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   They created CalFed to make peace among farmers, environmentalists
and city water districts. Its aim is to restore the endangered salmon
runs and native fish of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and also to
make it a more reliable source of water for Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   CalFed has charted its 30-year course and spent $1.5 billion in
state money in the last three years. But its mantra--"We all get
better together"--has rung hollow lately with agribusiness, which
uses roughly 80% of California's water and seeks a bigger, faster
investment in new reservoirs.</TE>
<TE>   Many water industry officials say that if voters reject
Proposition 50, CalFed's funding will dry up. They warn that the
state will plunge back into the combative days of the early 1990s,
when interest groups clashed repeatedly over the shipment of Northern
California water to the South Coast and San Joaquin Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "We go back to the days of gridlock," said CalFed Executive
Director Patrick Wright, "where we potentially have a fight every
year over water project operations."</TE>
<TE>   Without another infusion of cash from Proposition 50 or the
federal government--and a big appropriation this year from Congress
is a long shot--restoration of rivers would also halt, Wright said.</TE>
<TE>   In the last several years, the decline of chinook salmon, delta
smelt and splittail has reversed, and CalFed has breached small dams
and screened pumps in several streams.</TE>
<TE>   "To keep the program going," Wright said, "we will need a
significant new infusion of funds either from a new bond or from new
federal funding."</TE>
<TE>   In the last six years, only public schools have won more bond
money from California voters than water projects.</TE>
<TE>   In November 1996, voters passed Proposition 204, a $995-million
water bond issue. Three-quarters of that money had been spent as of
July.</TE>
<TE>   In March 2000, voters passed Proposition 13, the $2.1-billion Safe
Drinking Water, Clean Water, Watershed Protection and Flood
Protection Bond Act. Of that, $751 million remains.</TE>
<TE>   Bubbling Streams</TE>
<TE>   And just last March, voters approved a $2.6-billion bond measure,
Proposition 40. Television ads for the bond issue showed images of
bubbling Sierra streams, but most of the money is dedicated to urban
and state parks and the purchase of wildlife habitat.</TE>
<TE>   Those measures were drafted by lawmakers and negotiated in the
Legislature. Proposition 50, however, was largely written by three
environmentalists: Caves, the Planning and Conservation League
attorney; Leslie Friedman Johnson, a lobbyist for the Nature
Conservancy; and Barry Nelson, senior policy analyst with the Natural
Resources Defense Council in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   "They did a pretty good job of targeting some very distinct
needs," said Steve Hall, executive director of the Assn. of
California Water Agencies, which has endorsed the bond issue.</TE>
<TE>   Many water districts, especially those serving farmers, are
frustrated that no new permanent dam or reservoir has come from the
previous three water bond sales.</TE>
<TE>   "What we keep seeing in water bonds is not development of water
for the population," said Tess Dunham, the state Farm Bureau's water
resources director, "but continual acquisition of land and, of
course, most of that comes from agriculture."</TE>
<TE>   Some bond money has been used to study five places in Northern
California where a reservoir might be built or expanded, with
planning documents to be finished in 2004. And millions of dollars
have been invested to boost supplies in such places as Kern County by
capturing flood flows and percolating it underground to be stored for
a drier day.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact of the matter is, we're not ready to build surface
storage yet," Hall said. "People who believe we could have got to a
surface reservoir today don't understand what it takes to get there."</TE>
<TE>   To appease those eager for new reservoirs, the bond measure
authors sent a letter in August to state Sen. Mike Machado
(D-Linden), chairman of the Yes on Prop. 50 campaign, promising to
help sponsor yet another water bond measure in 2004. It would focus
on development of bigger water supplies--including new reservoirs.</TE>

<TE>   Voters OKd 12 Bonds Since 1996</TE>
<TE>   There have been 14 bonds on statewide ballots since 1996. The 12
bond measures approved total $23 billion.</TE>

<HD>Mollie Wilmot; Palm Beach Socialite Played Host to Cargo
Ship in 1984</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mollie Wilmot, a Palm Beach socialite who lived next door to the
Kennedy family estate and regularly entertained the likes of the Duke
and Duchess of Windsor in grand style, was not used to having
uninvited guests.</LD>
<LD>   But after a 197-foot Venezuelan freighter slammed into the sea
wall of her oceanfront mansion one stormy November morning in 1984,
Wilmot simply fell into the role of gracious hostess: She served
finger sandwiches, caviar and coffee to the ship's 12
Spanish-speaking crew members, and martinis to the swarm of
journalists who showed up at her door.</LD>
<LD>   Wilmot, who good-humoredly endured her 15 minutes of fame and grew
to have an affinity for the 660-ton guest that overstayed its
welcome, died in her New York City apartment Sept. 15.</LD>
<TE>   Wilmot left instructions not to reveal her age, but longtime
friends estimated that she was in her early 80s. The cause of death
was not disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   The Mercedes I, an empty cargo ship, had anchored off the Florida
coast Thanksgiving night 18 years ago during a fierce coastal storm
that generated 15-foot waves.</TE>
<TE>   But around 6:30 the next morning, the freighter pulled loose from
its mooring, crashed through Wilmot's sea wall and lodged itself
within feet of her swimming pool.</TE>
<TE>   Wilmot, a thrice-divorced department store heiress, had spent
Thanksgiving evening with the Pulitzer family and then come home and
gone to bed.</TE>
<TE>   When a maid woke her at 9:30 a.m., Wilmot later told a reporter,
she initially thought the maid was announcing the arrival of "the man
who was coming to photograph my home for Town &amp; Country."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the maid informed her that a "barge" had crashed into the
sea wall.</TE>
<TE>   Wilmot told the Associated Press that she was speechless when she
first saw the beached freighter in her backyard.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like the QE2 coming up, this huge monster," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Wilmot canceled the Town &amp; Country photo shoot, but there was no
lack of photographers at her home that day or during the next 103
days before the Mercedes finally checked out of its plush berth.</TE>
<TE>   The novelty of a huge freighter stuck in a Palm Beach socialite's
backyard was simply too good a story to ignore. News helicopters
constantly circled overhead and reporters, some from as far away as
Sweden, camped out in Wilmot's backyard.</TE>
<TE>   Overnight, the socialite with the blond hair, large white-frame
sunglasses and white Pekingese named Fluffy became an international
celebrity.</TE>
<TE>   Ever the attentive host, Wilmot fed the freighter's crew--and
their pet cat--for 10 days until they flew home to Venezuela.</TE>
<TE>   She also had hot cocoa served to the reporters stationed outside.</TE>
<TE>   As officials wrangled over who was responsible for removing the
freighter--the Venezuelan company that owned the ship was
bankrupt--Wilmot's neighbors dropped in for cocktails to discuss
their ideas for what to do with what came to be known as "Mollie's
Mercedes."</TE>
<TE>   Some joked that Wilmot should hang Christmas lights on the beached
freighter. Others suggested she open a restaurant, a discotheque or a
casino.</TE>
<TE>   Camera-toting sightseers, meanwhile, flocked to the pricey
neighborhood to view the hulking eyesore that obscured Wilmot's
million-dollar ocean view.</TE>
<TE>   "It certainly has aroused tremendous curiosity," she told the
Associated Press seven weeks into her ordeal. "I don't like all the
people coming around, but I understand.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still absolutely in awe of the thing every time I look out
there."</TE>
<TE>   Inspired by the saga of Mollie and the Mercedes, two local DJs
wrote a song called "The Wreck of the Rust Tub Mercedes."</TE>
<TE>   A postcard featuring an aerial photo of the ship lodged in
Wilmot's backyard sold about 145,000 copies in Germany, and local
entrepreneurs sold freighter-shaped chocolates, Mercedes baseball
caps and T-shirts.</TE>
<TE>   When a local bar had a Mollie Wilmot look-alike contest with
customers decked out in blond wigs and her signature white-framed
sunglasses, the fun-loving Wilmot served as a judge.</TE>
<TE>   Born Mollie Netcher in Chicago, Wilmot was an heiress to the
Boston Store fortune and spent much of her youth in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   She spoke fluent French and was known for her wit, sense of style
and philanthropy, which included the Multiple Sclerosis Society and
equine research at Cornell University.</TE>
<TE>   Wilmot bought her one-acre Palm Beach estate on North Ocean
Boulevard, just south of the Kennedy compound, in the early 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a strong possibility that if the boat had washed up on
the Kennedy property," she told People magazine in January 1985, "it
would be gone already."</TE>
<TE>   Wilmot tried to escape the constant intrusions and media glare,
but she couldn't evade her newfound notoriety.</TE>
<TE>   In New York that January, she was greeted in the street by
strangers who knew her name. She even saw herself on TV when she
switched on the set in her Hilton Hotel room in Istanbul.</TE>
<TE>   When she returned home in early February, no progress had been
made in removing the freighter.</TE>
<TE>   It took 105 days before Wilmot's backyard leviathan was finally
removed, at a cost of $220,000 paid by the Florida Department of
Natural Resources.</TE>
<TE>   On March 6, 1985, rusting and stripped for salvage, the Mercedes
was finally towed a mile off a Fort Lauderdale beach and sunk to make
an artificial reef.</TE>
<TE>   The sunken Mercedes became a popular spot for divers, and one
couple even used it as the setting for an underwater wedding. Wilmot,
however, declined an invitation to attend.</TE>
<TE>   Although Wilmot complained a decade after the Mercedes' unexpected
arrival that "no one ever lets me forget about it," she named one of
her yearling racing colts "Raise the Mercedes."</TE>
<TE>   She also kept the ship's bell as a souvenir and had three framed
photos of the freighter on her wall.</TE>
<TE>   Wilmot, who had no children, is survived by her sister, Francice
Bushkin, of Santa Barbara.</TE>

<HD>Supervisors Eye $1 Vehicle Tax</HD>
<DH>Finance: Fee, added to registration cost, would generate
$570,000 a year for high-tech fingerprint machines at county's
smaller police stations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County motorists would pay a buck more each year to register
a car under a proposal the Board of Supervisors will consider on
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The $1-a-vehicle surcharge would raise about $570,000 a year,
money that would be used to buy and install computerized fingerprint
machines at the county's smaller police agencies.</LD>
<LD>   A portion of the funds would also maintain high-tech fingerprint
equipment already in place at two county jails and an east county
booking station, said Sheriff Bob Brooks.</LD>
<TE>   A 1997 state law authorized counties to collect the fee if
supervisors determine that there is a need to update crime-fighting
technology, Brooks said. The county initially used state grants to
cover the cost of buying new equipment, but the sheriff said that
revenue has dried up.</TE>
<TE>   With the surcharge, fingerprint machines can be installed in
Fillmore, Moorpark, Ojai, Port Hueneme and Santa Paula, said Brooks.
Because of the steep cost, those cities have not yet updated their
equipment.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a tremendous crime-fighting tool for the larger
agencies," Brooks said of the equipment. "Now we'd like to expand it
so all these databases can be linked."</TE>
<TE>   The new technology does away with the ink-and-roll method of
taking fingerprints. Suspects are asked to place a hand on a
glass-topped counter--similar to a copy machine--that scans palms and
fingerprints in minute detail. Digitized copies are stored in
computer databases for future use, either to identify suspects or to
link them to a crime scene.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, detectives had to painstakingly sift through thick
notebooks when searching for a match to fingerprints, shoe prints or
bullet shell casings taken from a crime scene. Today, images of such
evidence can be scanned into a computer.</TE>
<TE>   In a matter of hours, sometimes minutes, the computer can search
for a match through the databases of other police agencies, the state
Department of Justice and the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   State law specifies that the new technology be used primarily to
help identify motorists suspected of driving drunk or committing
other crimes involving a vehicle, said sheriff's Cmdr. Brent Morris.
But the stored information has also been helpful in solving other
crimes and could eventually be used as a tool to apprehend suspected
terrorists, said Morris, who heads the department's technical
services division.</TE>
<TE>   "There are plans to eventually link to federal government
databases," he said. "There are so many forms of identification that
it is much more secure to use fingerprints to identify someone."</TE>
<TE>   Santa Paula Police Chief Bob Gonzales said he welcomes any help
his department can get. His officers still roll suspects'
fingerprints onto paper and then attach a copy of them to a report.
The new system would allow officers to instantly add fingerprints to
a centralized database.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be money well spent," Gonzales said. "I hope the
supervisors approve it."</TE>
<TE>   At least one supervisor, however, is questioning whether the
surcharge--which would expire in five years--should be approved.</TE>
<TE>   Board Chairman John Flynn is not convinced that supervisors should
approve a new tax to underwrite the technology update. Many social
and health care services in the county are underfunded, he noted.</TE>
<TE>   Flynn said he is irritated that the proposal was placed as a
consent item, a portion of the agenda typically reserved for issues
that are not controversial.</TE>
<TE>   "We should never put a new tax on the consent agenda," he said. "A
dollar doesn't sound like much, but a lot of people might not agree."</TE>

<HD>Salary Dispute Goes to Mediator</HD>
<DH>Education: Lengthy negotiations haven't settled Capistrano
Valley teachers' pay demands.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAIRE LUNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After more than a year of negotiations, school board members and
teachers in Capistrano Unified, the county's only district yet to
agree on a labor contract, will enter fact-finding talks this month
mediated by the state labor board.</LD>
<LD>   Parents received fliers detailing each side's position at
back-to-school events last week at the South County district's
elementary and middle schools. More literature is expected to be
handed out at this week's high school sessions.</LD>
<LD>   The main sticking point has been salary, with the Capistrano
Unified Education Assn. seeking a 4.11% raise, retroactive to last
year. The district has offered a 2% raise for last year, with another
2% increase for the current year.</LD>
<TE>   Officials from both sides said Friday they were eager to reach a
settlement during the fact-finding hearing, which is expected to take
two days.</TE>
<TE>   The Public Employment Relations Board, an agency administering
collective bargaining laws for the state's public employees, handles
the process. The hearing involves one person from each party
presenting arguments to a neutral, district- and union-approved
arbitrator who will issue a report.</TE>
<TE>   "The hope is that the report forms a basis for settlement," said
Jerilyn Gelt, a labor relations specialist for the state board. "It's
not binding, it's simply advisory."</TE>
<TE>   About 40 districts statewide each year apply to start the
fact-finding process, with a handful settling before it starts and
more than half settling during the hearing, Gelt said.</TE>
<TE>   District spokesman David Smollar said that the union was
"resorting to hyperbole and rhetoric" in referring to the district's
unspent money from last year.</TE>
<TE>   That $18.5 million includes a state-mandated reserve, funding for
state-required programs and $3 million set aside to fund the contract
settlement with the district's 2,300 teachers, Smollar said.</TE>
<TE>   "They're taking the ending balance from 2001-2002 and saying that
it's a pot of unspent funds available to them," he said. "That's
absolutely false, and they know it's false."</TE>
<TE>   But Vicki Soderberg, the union's chief negotiator, said the
district is maintaining a larger reserve than necessary, saving money
it should put into teacher's salaries and consequently lowering
teacher morale.</TE>
<TE>   A PTA president at one Capistrano Unified elementary school said
although she understands both sides' positions, she agrees with
district officials that economic conditions preclude giving the
teachers the money they're requesting.</TE>
<TE>   "There are people in this economy who have no jobs or who aren't
getting any [cost-of-living adjustment] increase," said the woman,
who asked to remain anonymous because the parent organization
officially remains neutral. "Compared to how other people have it,
the teachers are doing OK."</TE>

<HD>Davis' Wife Cancels Visit; Schipske Supplies Reasons</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A mysterious phone call. Threats of demonstrators. A potential
security breach.</LD>
<LD>   Those were the reasons Democratic congressional candidate Gerrie
Schipske gave to explain why California First Lady Sharon Davis
canceled an appearance at Schipske's Sunday afternoon campaign event
in Huntington Beach. But there were no pickets outside the event at
the Chimayo at the Beach restaurant.</LD>
<LD>   And the first lady's staff said they knew nothing about any
potential security breach--or mysterious phone calls. The governor's
wife didn't appear, her spokesman said, because other plans bumped
Schipske's event off her schedule.</LD>
<TE>   It's a very different story from what Schipske and her staff told
supporters. They spoke of a shadowy Arab American group phoning the
Democratic Party to warn the first lady not to show up because
anti-Schipske pickets would be out in force.</TE>
<TE>   Schipske, who is trying to unseat Rep. Dana Rohrabacher
(R-Huntington Beach) in the newly redrawn 46th District in the Nov. 5
election, cast the threatened demonstration and the first lady's
cancellation as a point of pride for her pro-Israeli stance.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to go ahead and have the event because I am not
going to be bullied," Schipske said as the $75-per-person fundraiser
began. "But the primary concern is for the first lady's safety."</TE>
<TE>   That came as news to Davis' staff. "We didn't know anything about
protesters," said Gabriel Sanchez, a spokesman for Davis. "It was
true she wasn't able to attend, but it was because there were
conflicts in her schedule."</TE>

<LD>An American Airlines jet carrying 125 passengers and crew members hit
a passenger jetway at Los Angeles International Airport because the
pilot failed to set the brakes, according to the airline's
preliminary report.</LD>
<LD>   No passengers were injured Saturday, but the plane's left wing and
the accordion-like structure that connects the aircraft to the
terminal were damaged.</LD>
<LD>   American Flight 21, which arrived from New York's John F. Kennedy
International Airport at 9:07 p.m., was taken out of service.</LD>
<TE>   Todd Burke, a spokesman for American Airlines, said the Boeing 767
jet had stopped and the engines had been shut down when the accident
occurred.</TE>
<TE>   The jetway had not yet moved toward the aircraft, and the plane's
door was closed, Burke said. Because the brake wasn't set, the plane
rolled about 25 feet, and the left wing hit the jetway.</TE>

<HD>Keeping the 'Rain Book' Alive</HD>
<DH>When a Weather Chronicler Died, Leo Hetzel Was 'Honored' to
Take Over</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Leo Hetzel carefully opens the faded gray ledger.</LD>
<LD>   The first entry, dated 1959:</LD>
<LD>   Feb. 8 .85 (inch)</LD>
<TE>   The brief notations are talismans of the past, watermarks left by
a woman dead now for 10 years, yet still honored every time the rain
falls.</TE>
<TE>   Elefrida McArthur lived in a tiny, broken-down cottage at the
confluence of Harding and Silverado creeks in eastern Orange County.
For 33 years--132 seasons--she kept the "rain book" for Modjeska
Canyon, a tightknit Santa Ana Mountains community named for Helena
Modjeska, a Polish American actress of the late 1800s who reportedly
packed up and left her canyon estate for a sunny isle in Newport
Harbor after a particularly nasty rainy season.</TE>
<TE>   It made sense for Mrs. McArthur, as she was always called, to be
the one to keep the rain book. Her neighbors two doors down, who had
kept it for decades, had passed away. Her house was perched on an
embankment under an old concrete bridge, in the flood plain of the
two creeks.</TE>
<TE>   Why keep a rain book in sunshine-filled Southern California? First
of all, it chronicles other things as well: drought, fire, quakes.</TE>
<TE>   But mainly, it is because there are seasons here along the rural
edge, where the waterways have never been encased in concrete. "Rainy
season" and "fire season" dance back and forth across the peaks,
scouring new terrain, threatening the tiny communities tucked below.</TE>
<TE>   "Lord willing and the creek don't rise" is a jaunty tagline from a
hillbilly song. Until, that is, you have lived through the dark,
pounding maelstrom of a storm-fed winter creek that rises in seconds
from your waist to your neck.</TE>
<TE>   One way to cope with the uncontrollable is to pin it down on
paper--thus, the water book. Such a record also helps to keep things
in perspective. When someone exclaims that surely this is the
hottest, wettest, windiest, all-around worst such weather ever, the
book can be consulted, the claim disproved--usually.</TE>
<TE>   February is indisputably always the rainiest, sluicing great
sheets across the narrow roads, dripping clammy fingers down your
back.</TE>
<TE>   McArthur began in February 1959, taking the reading at 8 a.m.
First page:</TE>
<TE>   Feb. 8 .85 (inch)</TE>
<TE>   9 .04</TE>
<TE>   11 1.44</TE>
<TE>   12 .42</TE>
<TE>   Page after page, month after month, she hoarded drops of moisture
that fell into tiny, calibrated plastic beakers in her backyard.</TE>
<TE>   For her, like everyone in the canyon, the seasons ran from July 1
to June 30, dry to drenched to dry again.</TE>
<TE>   '63-64 Nov. 20 2.67 inches Creek running</TE>
<TE>   The day the creeks first run, canyon children whoop and shriek and
slide down the suddenly muddy banks to the sweet, splashy water,
tasting the raindrops on their upturned tongues. The peepers sing all
night long--shy toads trilling bell-clear mating calls. The whole
world is wet and slippery and joyful. New grass and tadpoles sprout
overnight.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hard frost one Christmas and mist on Mother's Day. Snow in
November on the peaks above. Mrs. McArthur captured it all in spare,
cursive script. Shrieking Santa Anas are "that wind." Months of
parched, dusty heat are "very hot." A bone-dry February brings mild
amazement: "I'm surprised at this."</TE>
<TE>   68-69 Jan. 13 through 29</TE>
<TE>   Worst flood in 50 years. Part of Foster's house down. Much damage,
all in canyons. Our sea wall held except corner.</TE>
<TE>   Feb. 24 Killer flood. 5 houses down in Modjeska, scores more mud
damage. Silverado 1/3 homes lost. 5 deaths. 5.75 inches in 24 hours.</TE>
<TE>   Unwritten were the harsh details. Boulder-clogged creeks roared
like runaway freight trains through the night. Ropes of windy rain
lashed the steep, soggy mountain slopes. A giant live oak cracked and
tumbled downward, unleashing 20 tons of mud and water onto the
Silverado Canyon volunteer firehouse--perhaps the cruelest spot
possible, as five dozen neighbors had gathered there seeking refuge.
Marine helicopters worked through the howling darkness, airlifting
the wounded, a young woman in labor, the dead.</TE>
<TE>   Feb. 25 3.75 in.</TE>
<TE>   Feb. 26 4.00 inches.</TE>
<TE>   Feb. 27 Rain gauge gone down creek. could get no reading.</TE>
<TE>   More than 30 years later, Leo snorts as he reads that inscription.
"The reason she couldn't get a reading is because her whole backyard
was gone. She was an old-fashioned American farm woman. She didn't
panic easy. She was tough."</TE>
<TE>   "My mother was very much a person of duty," said her son, Floyd
McArthur. The rain book "was something she took quite seriously. She
was a person who always liked to read things, and learn things, and
discover things. When she took a job, she was quite faithful."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   1979-80</TE>
<TE>   No rain 191 days. Very bad.</TE>
<TE>   Nov. 24 Fire. Trabuco. Almost to Modjeska. 28,090 acres. Indian
Truck Trail start. 6 fires around Orange, Riverside, LA, San Berno.</TE>
<TE>   Walls of orange flame hissed and crackled over the mountain
flanks, urged on by 80 mph Santa Ana winds. Three cabins and four
outbuildings were destroyed one canyon over. Choking, acrid smoke
burned the eyelids of those trying to sleep. Suspected cause: arson.
Damage to the watershed totals $7 million.</TE>
<TE>   Dec. 4 and 5 First rain of season</TE>
<TE>   Jan. 28 Water very dirty and black from fire--1.15 inch</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   1977-78</TE>
<TE>   Jan 15 my big oak in back yard fell down. 2.50 inches</TE>
<TE>   Feb. 10 creek up 2.50 inches</TE>
<TE>   I lost 15 feet of my backyard + all the trees along the back to
high water</TE>
<TE>   April Leo and I put in gabion baskets, wall across our backyards</TE>
<TE>   It is Leo Hetzel's entrance into the journal. He and his wife,
Marija, eight months pregnant with their first child, had moved next
door in July. It was a broiling, buggy month, Marija recalls: convoys
of ants and dust everywhere. "A real Modjeska special," she says with
a laugh.</TE>
<TE>   In January hard rains fell, and 200-year-old live oaks crashed to
the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Leo and Mrs. McArthur won FEMA loans and put in metal baskets
filled with rocks to reinforce their backyards' ragged edges. They
are there today, barely visible, clogged with dried leaves and earth,
holding fast.</TE>
<TE>   Jan. 1-5 I was gone. Leo took reading.</TE>
<TE>   Jan. 4, 1982. I got butted by the goat. Hurt my back, stayed with
[daughter] Jean for 10 days.</TE>
<TE>   Mrs. McArthur had two very good friends in the canyon: Mrs. Mary
Hunt and Mrs. Roberta Smith. Mrs. Smith rode to church in Mrs.
McArthur's big old Dodge, the two of them quarreling about whether
the overarching oak and sycamores should be pulled out of the wending
road so it could be straightened. To this day, the trees stand, and
neighbors slow down to wave each other by.</TE>
<TE>   One January day, Mrs. McArthur went to visit Mrs. Hunt, and Mary's
goat butted her. She went down and had to leave the canyon for 10
days. Leo was entrusted with the rain record.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an honor," he said. "Besides, it had to be done."</TE>
<TE>   In less than two weeks, Mrs. McArthur was back on the job.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Oct. 1, 1987-7:42 a.m. We had a severe earthquake, center Whittier
area (6.1). Here it shook up and down. I had to hold onto the kitchen
water faucet to keep from wanting to fall down.</TE>
<TE>   To keep from wanting to fall down. As if to admit that she was
falling would be to give in.</TE>
<TE>   After 79 pages of fire, flood and wind dancing uninterrupted
through the columns, there is a single entry on top of Page 80:</TE>
<TE>   1992-93 july 13 .50</TE>
<TE>   Then, END OF MRS. MCARTHUR'S MESSAGES in Leo's square capitals.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time I see that page, I feel sad," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Mrs. Smith was in the late stages of Alzheimer's disease, but her
family brought her to the church in Silverado Canyon for Mrs.
McArthur's funeral. She sat in the back keening for her old friend up
front.</TE>
<TE>   Mrs. McArthur's son gave the rain book to Leo.</TE>
<TE>   "I left two pages blank before I started mine," Leo says.</TE>
<TE>   1992-93 December 7 Rained all night 2.15 inches</TE>
<TE>   Santiago Creek started running good.</TE>
<TE>   Why continue the pursuit of a simple woman begun in the middle of
last century, when the seasons have been sterilized, blanched out of
the planned communities with their "earth tone" stucco and airtight
windows? Because every whisper of a Santa Ana, every lick of fire,
every slick suburban street after a storm remind us that nature still
holds sway.</TE>
<TE>   The driest year on record since Elefrida McArthur started the
Modjeska rain book was 2001-02: 6.92 inches. Deer and cougars crept
down from the mountains to canyon backyards, desperate for the water
they smelled in sprinklers and hoses.</TE>
<TE>   The last week of September, after days of triple-digit heat, Leo
took the book from its shelf and turned the pages slowly. Within 24
hours, a long, black cloud blanketed the peaks of Saddleback. Shortly
before 8 p.m., a steady, cool rain began. A benediction.</TE>

<HD>Response to LAX Shooting Flawed, Study Says</HD>
<DH>Safety: Agencies' poor coordination tops the list of
mix-ups. City Council will review findings, which suggest forming
central police bureau.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER OLDHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Numerous law enforcement agencies grappled with deployment mix-ups
and communication snafus in the aftermath of a grisly Independence
Day shooting at Los Angeles International Airport, according to a
report to be presented to the City Council's Public Safety Committee
today.</LD>
<LD>   The document, requested by City Councilman Jack Weiss after the
deadly attack at the El Al Airlines ticket counter in the Tom Bradley
International Terminal, illustrates the jurisdictional complexities
that surround crime investigation at the world's fifth-busiest
airport.</LD>
<LD>   Although city officials and security experts praised the response
by numerous law enforcement agencies to the shooting, the report
lists several areas that need improvement, both in crime
investigation techniques and in the way the airport handles
evacuations.</LD>
<TE>   Some of these areas, such as the need for better coordination
among agencies and more efficient sharing of resources, are not
unique to the shooting, but would arise in many major incidents at
LAX, officials agreed.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, the sheer number of personnel who arrived after
Egyptian immigrant Hesham Mohamed Hadayet gunned down two people
before he was killed by an El Al security guard caused confusion,
according to the report, compiled by airport Police Chief Bernard J.
Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   Ten agencies responded, including 425 people from the Los Angeles
Police Department, airport police, the city agency that operates LAX
and the FBI. Officials from the Customs Service; the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; the California Highway Patrol; and the
Beverly Hills Police Department also were involved.</TE>
<TE>   The response was so large partly because the event took place on
Independence Day, when the nation was on high alert for terrorist
attacks, and because the shooting had a possible terrorist link, the
report said.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the council's Public Safety Committee said they're
interested in discussing how well the agencies worked together and
whether it was clear who was in charge.</TE>
<TE>   "It is one thing to say that the system worked well during an
attack that lasted less than two minutes. But after all, this attack
was brought to a close by El Al," said Weiss, who declined to discuss
specifics of the report. "My question is, what's the best structure
so that if an attack occurs in the future, local authorities can
bring it to an equally swift conclusion?"</TE>
<TE>   After the shooting, some participants spoke of tension between the
LAPD and the FBI over which agency had jurisdiction in the criminal
investigation. The FBI typically heads airport investigations that
might involve terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The uneasiness that emerged between the two agencies during the
investigation is evident in a report compiled by the LAPD recounting
its role in the July 4 shooting. In the report, which the committee
will also review today, the LAPD is critical of the FBI's
organizational techniques.</TE>
<TE>   "The majority of the involved special agents ... had limited job
tenure and insufficient investigative experience relating to
homicides," according to a memo included in the report and signed by
Lt. Clay Farrell, acting commanding officer of the Robbery-Homicide
Division.</TE>
<TE>   To deal with agency duplication problems, the report proposes
having a single check-in location and incident report for each event,
as well as forming rapid response teams that would be charged with
taking control of incidents at LAX.</TE>
<TE>   City Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski, who chairs the Public Safety
Committee, said the panel will discuss whether criminal
investigations at LAX would run more smoothly if there were a
"centralized police agency" that combined the LAPD with airport
police. Several officials, including Police Commission President Rick
Caruso, called for merging the two agencies after the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   To deal with communication breakdowns detailed in the
report--including delayed transmission or failure to send information
to all agencies--the airport police force is upgrading its radio
system, said Michael DiGirolamo, deputy executive director of airport
operations and public safety.</TE>
<TE>   Coordination problems among law enforcement agencies were
exacerbated by the fact that investigators mixed with thousands of
passengers who were evacuated from airport terminals and went without
food, water and restroom facilities for hours, the report found.</TE>
<TE>   The city's airport agency has since put an evacuation plan in
place that sets aside holding areas for evacuees from each terminal
and addresses how to let them back in.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one thing to evacuate a terminal; that's relatively easy.
You stand up and say, 'Get the hell out of here!' " DiGirolamo said.
"Our biggest problem was keeping people informed outside and getting
them back in the terminal in an orderly fashion."</TE>

<HD>Scouting a Main Street for Valley</HD>
<DH>Cityhood: Would it be Ventura Boulevard or Van Nuys? The
former has name recognition, but the latter will have a government
center.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MASSIE RITSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If the San Fernando Valley aspires to be its own city, where would
main street be? Which of the Valley's roadways best summarizes the
area's character and commerce?</LD>
<LD>   "Well, it would be Ventura Boulevard. It always has been," said
Sam Hodes, picking up his morning paper at a newsstand just off the
busy street. "It's the hub of the Valley--Encino, Sherman Oaks,
office buildings."</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter used the same
words--"hub of the San Fernando Valley"--to describe the area's
quintessential thoroughfare. But she was talking about Van Nuys
Boulevard, which she thinks could become "a place with a heart and a
voice" with an injection of money for economic development.</LD>
<TE>   Ventura Boulevard, which runs east-west, is cafes with twinkly
lights, music stores and clothing boutiques. Van Nuys Boulevard,
which runs north-south, is car dealerships, bail bondsmen and a
satellite office of Los Angeles City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Talk to people where the two boulevards intersect, and they'll
agree: The Valley's main street is Ventura Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   "That's where the Starbucks are. When somebody says, let's go meet
somewhere, it's always Ventura," said Jay Schram, a general
contractor who lives in Beverly Hills. Van Nuys also has spots to
meet, he conceded, but "it's kind of become the ghetto."</TE>
<TE>   Recognizing that perception, Galanter, whose district includes Van
Nuys, wants the city's community developers to use federal money to
study how to revive Van Nuys Boulevard. Different Band-Aids have been
applied over the years, but the changes need to be more than
cosmetic, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal is to have the street be more than a traffic mover,"
said Galanter, who has a Yale degree in urban planning.</TE>
<TE>   If the Valley does become its own city after the Nov. 5 secession
vote, Van Nuys--the community--stands to become the civic center. And
as the main route to courthouses, state and federal offices and a
$34-million government building going up to serve Valley residents,
Van Nuys Boulevard would be the primary artery of the sixth-largest
city in the country. That, said Nancy Hoffman of the Mid Valley
Chamber of Commerce, settles the main street debate.</TE>
<TE>   "This is how I look at it," Hoffman said. "When I go into other
cities--whether it's San Francisco or Sacramento--the main street
revolves around the civic center. And we have a civic center" on Van
Nuys Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Most recently, the stretch of Van Nuys near the government cluster
has been the beneficiary of a Targeted Neighborhood Initiative.
Several million dollars in federal grants have gone toward trees,
lighting and other improvements.</TE>
<TE>   Along one block of Van Nuys, at Delano Street, one cafe has been
painted a peachy orange and the facade of a Chinese restaurant looks
like hot mustard. The new looks stopped traffic for a while and some
of the colors had to be toned down, but now the area "looks
maintained instead of run-down, like it used to be," said Elaine
Zheleznyak, a nurse who works nearby. Even with those improvements,
she still considers Ventura Boulevard and its trendy shops, offices
and restaurants to be the Valley's main street.</TE>
<TE>   But Ventura Boulevard comes up short as an embodiment of the
Valley, said Scott Schmidt, government liaison director for the
Valley Industry and Commerce Assn. As Ventura cuts through the
southern end of the Valley, it hugs mostly affluent, leafy areas.</TE>
<TE>   "Van Nuys really brings together the diversity that you see in the
San Fernando Valley, uniquely," said Schmidt, whose agency moved
there from Ventura Boulevard last year.</TE>
<TE>   There could be other nominees, of course, for the Valley's main
street. In an informal survey last week, there were votes for
Sepulveda and Lankershim boulevards. Sherman Way's width and palms
give it a nice look. In the West Valley, there's Topanga Canyon
Boulevard. The East Valley has Laurel Canyon Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe there need not be an answer to the main street question.</TE>
<TE>   "Who cares?" Galanter said. "The Valley is a big place. It ought
to have a number of main streets."</TE>

<HD>Scouting a Main Street for a Valley City</HD>
<DH>Secession: Would it be Ventura Boulevard or Van Nuys? The
former has name recognition, but the latter will have a government
center.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MASSIE RITSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If the San Fernando Valley aspires to be its own city, where would
main street be? Which of the Valley's roadways best summarizes the
area's character and commerce?</LD>
<LD>   "Well, it would be Ventura Boulevard. It always has been," said
Sam Hodes, picking up his morning paper at a newsstand just off the
busy street. "It's the hub of the Valley--Encino, Sherman Oaks,
office buildings."</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter used the same
words--"hub of the San Fernando Valley"--to describe the area's
quintessential thoroughfare. But she was talking about Van Nuys
Boulevard, which she thinks could become "a place with a heart and a
voice" with an injection of money for economic development.</LD>
<TE>   Ventura Boulevard, which runs east-west, is cafes with twinkly
lights, music stores and clothing boutiques. Van Nuys Boulevard,
which runs north-south, is car dealerships, bail bondsmen and a
satellite office of Los Angeles City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Talk to people where the two boulevards intersect, and they'll
agree: The Valley's main street is Ventura Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   "That's where the Starbucks are. When somebody says, let's go meet
somewhere, it's always Ventura," said Jay Schram, a general
contractor who lives in Beverly Hills. Van Nuys also has spots to
meet, he conceded, but "it's kind of become the ghetto."</TE>
<TE>   Recognizing that perception, Galanter, whose district includes Van
Nuys, wants the city's community developers to use federal money to
study how to revive Van Nuys Boulevard. Different Band-Aids have been
applied over the years, but the changes need to be more than
cosmetic, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal is to have the street be more than a traffic mover,"
said Galanter, who has a Yale degree in urban planning.</TE>
<TE>   If the Valley does become its own city after the Nov. 5 secession
vote, Van Nuys--the community--stands to become the civic center. And
as the main route to courthouses, state and federal offices and a
$34-million government building going up to serve Valley residents,
Van Nuys Boulevard would be the primary artery of the sixth-largest
city in the country. That, said Nancy Hoffman of the Mid Valley
Chamber of Commerce, settles the main street debate.</TE>
<TE>   "This is how I look at it," Hoffman said. "When I go into other
cities--whether it's San Francisco or Sacramento--the main street
revolves around the civic center. And we have a civic center" on Van
Nuys Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Most recently, the stretch of Van Nuys near the government cluster
has been the beneficiary of a Targeted Neighborhood Initiative.
Several million dollars in federal grants have gone toward trees,
lighting and other improvements.</TE>
<TE>   Along one block of Van Nuys, at Delano Street, one cafe has been
painted a peachy orange and the facade of a Chinese restaurant looks
like hot mustard. The new looks stopped traffic for a while and some
of the colors had to be toned down, but now the area "looks
maintained instead of run-down, like it used to be," said Elaine
Zheleznyak, a nurse who works nearby. Even with those improvements,
she still considers Ventura Boulevard and its trendy shops, offices
and restaurants to be the Valley's main street.</TE>
<TE>   But Ventura Boulevard comes up short as an embodiment of the
Valley, said Scott Schmidt, government liaison director for the
Valley Industry and Commerce Assn. As Ventura cuts through the
southern end of the Valley, it hugs mostly affluent, leafy areas.</TE>
<TE>   "Van Nuys really brings together the diversity that you see in the
San Fernando Valley, uniquely," said Schmidt, whose agency moved
there from Ventura Boulevard last year.</TE>
<TE>   There could be other nominees, of course, for the Valley's main
street. In an informal survey last week, there were votes for
Sepulveda and Lankershim boulevards. Sherman Way's width and palms
give it a nice look. In the West Valley, there's Topanga Canyon
Boulevard. The East Valley has Laurel Canyon Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe there need not be an answer to the main street question.</TE>
<TE>   "Who cares?" Galanter said. "The Valley is a big place. It ought
to have a number of main streets."</TE>

<HD>Nearly 1,000 Attend Rally</HD>
<DH>Politics: Yaroslavsky, Hahn and Romer are on hand at a
Tarzana event organized in support of health care and school
initiatives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PIERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A coalition of church groups, unions and community organizations
rallied with political leaders in Tarzana on Sunday to urge voters to
pass school and health care initiatives and to defeat secession
efforts in next month's elections.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly 1,000 people attended the event, held at Temple Judea and
sponsored by L.A. Metro Industrial Areas Foundation, a grass-roots
organization seeking improved health care and reforms in education
and immigration.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles Unified School District Supt. Roy Romer pushed for the
approval of a $3.35-billion school construction bond initiative,
Measure K.</LD>
<TE>   It would fund 120 new schools, expand 79 existing campuses, end
most busing programs and remove portable classrooms from district
playgrounds.</TE>
<TE>   "Will you fight for us to get a seat for every one of our
children" in school? Romer asked, waving his fists. "Let me hear
you!"</TE>
<TE>   Megan Guerrero, an administrator at Esperanza Elementary School in
the Pico-Union area, said she was "tired of turning students away"
because of overcrowding, and "tired of telling parents their children
can't come" to their neighborhood school.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor James K. Hahn said that a city breakup would not result in
better services for the Valley and that Los Angeles was committed to
building more affordable housing. Hahn was later asked by the
principal of Trinity Street Elementary School if he would meet with
newly appointed police Chief William Bratton to talk about recent
burglaries at the campus in South-Central L.A.</TE>
<TE>   "As soon as he's on board, I want [Bratton] to meet with you,"
Hahn responded, triggering applause.</TE>
<TE>   County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky told the gathering that the
county needs money from both the federal and state governments to
keep clinics open. He urged the audience to support Measure B, which
would provide $168 million to support emergency and trauma services
in the county.</TE>
<TE>   "This will save the most critical services and give us some
breathing room," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Many at the rally also called for legislation to give driver's
licenses to illegal immigrants. State Sen. Richard Alarcon (D-Sylmar)
said he would continue to push for such laws, even though one was
recently rejected by Gov. Gray Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Natalie Vasquez, a 17-year-old student at L.A. Unified's Bravo
Medical Magnet School in East L.A., said immigration laws need to be
revised.</TE>
<TE>   She said she had been accepted into Scripps College in Claremont
to study medicine, but couldn't find federal or state grants because
she is undocumented.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes me feel like everything I've done is worthless," she
said.</TE>

<DL>SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina</DL>
<LD>Nationalists made strong gains in Bosnia's first elections organized
without Western help since the end of the 1992-95 war, according to
partial preliminary results late Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The election commission said no races had been decided by Sunday
night. Final results of the Saturday vote are expected by Oct. 22.</LD>
<LD>   A Serb nationalist, Mirko Sarovic, looked poised to win the Serb
spot on Bosnia's three-member multiethnic presidency. With 77% of the
vote tallied, he'd won 38%.</LD>
<TE>   Dragan Covic of the nationalist Croatian Democratic Union was in
the lead for the Croat presidency with 65% of the vote. It was
unclear what percentage of ballots had been tallied in that race.</TE>
<TE>   With 69% of ballots counted, Sulejman Tihic lead with 28% in the
race for the Muslim post.</TE>

<HD>Leftist Runs Far Ahead in Brazilian Vote</HD>
<DH>Election: Lula wins the first round handily, but he will
probably face a conservative in a runoff. The results are a rebuke to
pro-market reforms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR TOBAR and CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>RIO DE JANEIRO</DL>
<LD>Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva won a big victory in the first round of
Brazil's presidential election Sunday, but the leftist leader failed
to achieve a majority and will probably face Jose Serra, the
conservative ruling-party candidate, in a runoff.</LD>
<LD>   With about three-quarters of the votes tallied, the man known here
simply as "Lula" was leading Serra by 47% to 24%. If the results
stand, the two men will face each other in a second round Oct. 27.</LD>
<LD>   "We prepared ourselves to fight this election in one round, and we
prepared for two rounds," Lula said early Sunday. "If we win in the
first round, that would be excellent."</LD>
<TE>   The large vote for Lula--running for president for the fourth
time--signaled a rebuke to the eight years of pro-market reforms and
globalization engineered by outgoing President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso and his Brazilian Social Democratic Party.</TE>
<TE>   "A large amount of the public recognizes Cardoso as a good
president but believes that his government made grave mistakes," said
Helio Jaguaribe, a political science professor in Rio de Janeiro.
"They think his administration created an economic model that should
be replaced."</TE>
<TE>   Finishing third and fourth in the six-candidate field were two
center-left candidates. Anthony Garotinho, a former governor of Rio
de Janeiro state, came in third with 16%. Ciro Gomes, a former
Communist Party activist and later finance minister, was fourth with
13%.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly three-quarters of the Brazilian electorate voted for left
and center-left candidates in early returns. And Lula was leading,
often by a large margin, in all but three of Brazil's 26 states.</TE>
<TE>   Bush administration officials fear a Lula victory could signal a
turn away from free-market reform throughout the region. Lula has
promised to seek better terms for Brazil in negotiations over the
proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas. Businessmen were also
anxious to see what Lula's strong showing will mean for the stock and
currency markets when they open this morning.</TE>
<TE>   "The people who moved toward Lula wanted clean politics,
seriousness in government, opportunity for new leaders, safety on the
streets and a return to hope and happiness in their homes," said Rio
economist Paulo Rabello de Castro. "They see Lula as the best
alternative to eight years of center-right rule."</TE>
<TE>   Cardoso tamed inflation, privatized government businesses and
brought growth to Brazil, but he failed to narrow the great chasm
between rich and poor. After he was elected to a second term in
1998--defeating Lula in the first round--economic growth slowed to a
crawl.</TE>
<TE>   Unable to run for reelection again because of term limits, Cardoso
handpicked Serra to be his successor.</TE>
<TE>   "Brazil is full of problems, but many good things have already
been accomplished," Serra said Thursday during the last debate of the
campaign. "The important thing is that tomorrow be better than
today."</TE>
<TE>   A former health minister in Cardoso's government, Serra gained
notoriety when he threatened to break pharmaceutical patents unless
foreign drug companies cut prices on AIDS medications. Still, he was
unable to distance himself from the financial crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "We will make it to the second round, if God wills it," Serra said
Sunday as he cast his vote in Sao Paulo, South America's largest city
and the country's economic nerve center.</TE>
<TE>   A runoff between Serra and Lula would be a showdown between two
opposing visions of Brazil's future. Serra is a favorite of the
financial markets, and it is widely expected that he would continue
most of Cardoso's economic plan.</TE>
<TE>   Lula has called for increased spending on health and education and
has said that Brazil is the victim of unfair trade agreements with
the United States that hurt working people and the poor.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe we can turn Brazil around and begin to grow again,"
the candidate said at a news conference last week. "It's the only way
out for a big country like Brazil, to resolve the very serious
internal social problems ... by creating jobs and creating an equal
distribution of income."</TE>
<TE>   Whoever is the next president of Brazil will inherit seemingly
intractable economic problems. About 11 million Brazilians are
unemployed, while Brazil's public debt has spiraled up to $260
billion, greater than half the gross domestic product. The national
currency, the real, has dropped precipitously amid fears that Brazil
might default on its debt.</TE>
<TE>   Many well-off Brazilians, fearing a President Lula would
intentionally default on the debt, withdrew their savings from the
country even before the election, creating a crisis for the banking
system.</TE>
<TE>   In August, Lula, Serra and the other candidates agreed to respect
the terms of a $30-billion bailout agreement reached between
Cardoso's government and the International Monetary Fund.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement calls for a sharp reduction in government spending
next year. But Lula has given mixed signals as to whether he would
respect the budget targets.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the Workers' Party candidate turned out to have earned an
outright victory Sunday, he would face a difficult task in trying to
govern. His party is not likely to win more than 140 seats in the
594-member National Congress, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   A former trade unionist, Lula founded the Workers' Party in 1980.
In recent years, the party has won elections in several cities and
states, earning a reputation for being made up of honest--if not
always efficient--administrators.</TE>
<TE>   Under the tutelage of marketing wizard Duda Mendonca, the Workers'
Party refashioned the image of its leader. The radical laborite of
the late 1970s was transformed into an avuncular statesman as
comfortable meeting with business leaders as with trade union
militants.</TE>
<TE>   The party's most radical members disparagingly called the media
campaign "Lula Light." Still, the party's militant left wing remained
loyal, even when Lula named a conservative businessman, Jose Alencar,
as his running mate.</TE>
<TE>   One commercial converted the party's revolutionary symbol--a red
star--into an oversized toy that children tossed about a beach,
conveying a key part of Mendonca's message: There's no need to fear
Lula and the Workers' Party.</TE>
<TE>   Lula's campaign created a political program meant to balance the
clamor for change with concerns that his party was too radical to
govern Brazil. He called for a break with the "neo-liberal" economics
of the past but said he would not default on Brazil's public debt.</TE>
<TE>   The Workers' Party's candidates for governor were not doing as
well Sunday in Brazil's largest states, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo.
In the latter, incumbent Workers' Party Gov. Benedita da Silva was
running a distant second to Rosinha Matheus, the wife of presidential
candidate Garotinho.</TE>
<TE>   It was clear Sunday that much of what appealed to voters about the
Workers' Party was Lula himself and the story of how the son of an
impoverished family of seven children from the northern state of
Pernambuco became a national leader.</TE>
<TE>   Lula voted at a school in Sao Bernardo do Campo just across the
street from the house where he once lived, in a working-class
neighborhood normally lost amid the vast Sao Paulo urban sprawl.</TE>
<TE>   Awaiting his arrival were hundreds of friends, former neighbors
and fellow union members who have known him for decades, long before
he first rose to prominence as a union leader at the nearby
Volkswagen plant.</TE>
<TE>   When the bearded and diminutive candidate voted at 10 a.m., in a
gray suit, sweating profusely and giving a thumbs-up to raucous
well-wishers, voters were lined up halfway around the block.</TE>
<TE>   The candidate was jostled by supporters and reporters entering and
leaving, and the school grounds were awash in leaflets extolling Lula
and other Workers' Party candidates.</TE>
<TE>   For most of the solidly pro-Lula voters assembled there--like
Flora Aguilar, a 67-year-old school cafeteria worker--the possible
victory of the local hero after four tries was "the big step we've
been fighting for.... It's an incredible emotion we are feeling now."</TE>
<TE>   "I've known him for 40 years. "We grew up together, went out for
beers together, were officers in the union together," said Jose
Perreira, 60, a retired Volkswagen metalworker. "It's been a war to
achieve the level where he is now. But I never had any doubt he would
make it ."</TE>
<TE>   About 115 million Brazilians were expected to cast votes using
innovative computerized ballot boxes. In the most remote areas of the
vast country--in the Amazon jungle, for example--the boxes
transmitted their data via satellite. Still, problems arose in
several cities, with some voters waiting in line for three hours.
Some illiterate residents of Rio were confused by the system and took
up to 45 minutes to cast their ballots.</TE>
<TE>   Voting is obligatory in Brazil, and those who fail to show up at
the polls on election day face fines.</TE>
<TE>   In Rio, where the weeks before the election saw stores shut down
in reaction to fears of violence orchestrated by drug dealers, about
3,000 army soldiers patrolled.</TE>
<TE>   Tobar reported from Rio de Janeiro and Kraul from Sao Bernardo do
Campo. Times staff writer Paula Gobbi in Rio contributed to this
report.</TE>

<HD>Doc Scandal in Belfast</HD>
<DH>N. Ireland: Sinn Fein aide allegedly had files 'likely to
be of use to terrorists.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BELFAST, Northern Ireland</DL>
<LD>A Sinn Fein party aide was arraigned Sunday on charges of possessing
stolen British government documents--a charge that politicians said
gravely threatened Northern Ireland's Catholic-Protestant government.</LD>
<LD>   Denis Donaldson, 52, the head of administration for the Irish
Republican Army-linked party in the Northern Ireland legislature,
pleaded not guilty as prosecutors accused him of possessing documents
"likely to be of use to terrorists."</LD>
<LD>   Det. Inspector Paul McClatchey testified that when officers raided
Donaldson's home Friday, they found a document-filled bag containing
the home addresses and other details of potential targets for IRA
assassination.</LD>
<TE>   More than 200 Sinn Fein supporters protested outside Belfast
Magistrates Court as Judge Mark Hamill ordered Donaldson held without
bail for a week.</TE>
<TE>   "I am sure that in the fullness of time, when all the dust settles
down, Denis Donaldson will walk free," said Sinn Fein leader Gerry
Adams, who attended the hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Another person arrested in the raids was charged Sunday night with
possessing information likely to be of use to terrorists. Fiona
Farrelly, 46, was ordered held without bail after prosecutors said
police had seized a laptop and more sensitive documents.</TE>
<TE>   Two others arrested Friday--including a former British civil
servant suspected of passing documents to Donaldson until quitting
his job in September 2001--were still being interrogated.</TE>

<HD>Ivory Coast Gun Battles Resume</HD>
<DH>Africa: Government goes on offensive to reclaim the
rebel-held north after cease-fire efforts collapse.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>YAMOUSSOUKRO, Ivory Coast</DL>
<LD>Heavy gunfire erupted around Ivory Coast's second-largest city
Sunday, heralding the start of a government offensive to reclaim the
rebel-held north after cease-fire efforts collapsed.</LD>
<LD>   Government troops riding in pickup trucks raced north toward
rebels who have seized half of this once-stable West African nation
since launching a bloody failed coup attempt Sept. 19.</LD>
<LD>   "There's firing all over the place," said a frightened resident
cowering in her home in the central city of Bouake, which has been in
rebel hands for more than two weeks. Reached by phone, the woman said
the shooting started Sunday afternoon and was still going on two
hours later.</LD>
<TE>   Presidential spokesman Toussaint Alain said Ivorian troops had
launched operations "aimed at liberating urban sites occupied by
illegal fighters."</TE>
<TE>   "They will continue until law is reestablished over the entire
national territory," he said in a statement from Paris. "At stake is
the defense of the young Ivorian democracy and its institutions,
imperfect as they are."</TE>
<TE>   French military officials, who have forces positioned east of
Bouake, said there was no fighting in the city itself Sunday. But
they said there were gunfire exchanges south of the city.</TE>
<TE>   Rebels took up defensive positions south and east of Bouake, the
French officials said. Rebel official Kone Messamba said the
insurgents sent 50 vehicles with men and weapons from their northern
stronghold, Korhogo, to reinforce Bouake.</TE>
<TE>   The gunfire came as President Laurent Gbagbo told West African
mediators that he would not sign a cease-fire agreed to last week
unless rebels disarm first. Frustrated, the envoys from six West
African countries--including foreign and defense ministers--packed
bags to leave, saying they would consult with their heads of state on
what to do next.</TE>
<TE>   "We came here with the best intentions, now it's basically a
problem for Ivory Coast," said Kwame Addo Kufuor, Ghana's defense
minister.</TE>

<HD>Mayor of Paris Stabbed During All-Night Party</HD>
<DH>Europe: The Muslim suspect reportedly tells police that his
dislike of gays and politicians led him to attack the official, who
is recovering.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEBASTIAN ROTELLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>An assailant stabbed Mayor Bertrand Delanoe early Sunday during an
all-night party for the public at City Hall, leaving the mayor
hospitalized but in good condition with a wound in the abdomen.</LD>
<LD>   The suspect, a devout Muslim, told interrogators that his dislike
of gays and politicians caused him to attack the mayor, who is openly
gay, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   "He explained his strong religious views made him reject
homosexuality as unnatural," said Jean-Claude Dauvel of the Paris
prosecutor's office, according to media reports.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities quickly subdued the suspect. He was identified as
Azzedine Berkane, 39, a Frenchman of Algerian descent with a criminal
record and psychiatric problems.</TE>
<TE>   The incident occurred about 2:30 a.m. as Delanoe was greeting
party-goers in a ballroom in the elegant City Hall during the
festival dubbed Nuit Blanche, or "Sleepless Night." City Hall had
been opened to the public and decorated as a 1930s nightclub as part
of the all-night extravaganza, which drew tens of thousands of
Parisians to art exhibits, concerts, swimming pools and landmarks
such as the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre.</TE>
<TE>   The incident was the third serious attack on a French politician
this year. In March, a mentally disturbed sometime environmentalist
gunned down eight City Council members at City Hall in suburban
Nanterre. In July, a neo-Nazi would-be assassin fired a shot at
President Jacques Chirac during a Bastille Day parade.</TE>
<TE>   "Already on a number of occasions, we have seen how many elected
officials have been exposed to numerous aggressions," said Prime
Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin on Sunday. He said France must
"reinforce [its] overall security measures so that French society can
be a peaceful society."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said they had not detected any connections between
Islamic extremist groups and the mayor's assailant. Berkane is
reportedly a computer technician who lives with his parents in a
tough housing project in suburban Bobigny north of Paris. He has an
arrest record and has been treated at least once for psychiatric
troubles, authorities said. Nonetheless, the fact that he is a
self-described devout Muslim added another troubling element to the
latest act of headline-making violence in France.</TE>
<TE>   The French government has become increasingly concerned about
rising crime, Islamic fundamentalism, alienated immigrant communities
and the potentially explosive convergence of those problems. As the
repercussions of the Sept. 11 attacks have radicalized Islamic
extremists in Europe, law enforcement agencies here and in
neighboring nations worry not just about organized terrorism but
about the threat of more ambiguous, ideologically tinged acts that
some investigators call "individual jihad."</TE>
<TE>   Whether political or not, street violence is a top priority of
Chirac's new center-right government. On Sunday, the president called
the attack on Delanoe "senseless." Politicians across the spectrum
visited the mayor in the hospital, where he was expected to spend a
week recovering from surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Delanoe, a 52-year-old Socialist elected last year, is the French
capital's first leftist mayor since 1871. He disclosed his
homosexuality in 1999, but the French took the news in stride and
neither the mayor nor other politicians have made it an issue.</TE>
<TE>   Governing in a coalition with the Greens party, Delanoe has a
low-key, populist style. He sometimes takes the subway to work.</TE>
<TE>   Security was light at City Hall on Saturday night, witnesses said.
Television footage from before the attack showed Delanoe walking
through the festivities without any bodyguards visible around him.</TE>
<TE>   The attacker, who stabbed Delanoe without a word, told
investigators that he had not planned the assault but acted
spontaneously when he saw the mayor approach, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   As Delanoe lay wounded in a knot of horrified officials, the mayor
insisted that the party had to go on, according to Deputy Mayor
Christophe Girard.</TE>
<TE>   "He told me the 'Nuit Blanche' should continue unchanged and not
to dramatize what had happened," Girard told journalists.</TE>

<HD>At Least 10 Palestinians Killed in Gaza Strip Raid</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Israeli tanks and combat helicopters attack in a
'pinpoint' operation 'against terrorist infrastructure,' the army
says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>At least 10 Palestinians were killed and scores wounded early today
when Israeli tanks and armored vehicles backed by combat helicopters
raided a Gaza Strip neighborhood, witnesses and officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The Israeli forces shelled buildings and traded fire with
Palestinian gunmen in the town of Khan Yunis until withdrawing about
four hours after the incursion began, residents said.</LD>
<LD>   The dead included a 50-year-old woman whose house was destroyed by
Israeli tank fire, hospital officials said. More than 70 people were
reported wounded.</LD>
<TE>   Most of the deaths and injuries occurred when an Israeli
helicopter launched a missile toward a crowd of people--civilians and
militants-- who ventured from their homes around dawn when the tanks
appeared to be withdrawing, witnesses said.</TE>
<TE>   Haider Kidra, director of the Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis,
confirmed at least 10 dead, with several of the wounded in critical
condition. He said a boy who looked about 10 years old was among the
dead whose ripped bodies were rushed to the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   The action against the crowded city of Khan Yunis took place on
two fronts: one column of armor roared into the city's industrial
Amal neighborhood while a second invaded a refugee camp on Khan
Yunis' western outskirts.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli army confirmed that a "pinpoint" operation was in
progress in Gaza "against terrorist infrastructure" but declined
further comment. Khan Yunis is a stronghold for the radical Islamic
Hamas organization, and previous Israeli forays into Gazan
neighborhoods have been carried out to kill Hamas militants or to
destroy metalworks factories that the army contends are used to
produce mortars and other weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Hamas has been responsible for many of the suicide bombings that
have terrorized Israel. Before this morning's raid, Palestinian
militants had fired a rocket at a Jewish settlement in Gaza; no
injuries were reported.</TE>
<TE>   Jawad Tibi, a member of the Palestinian Legislative Council who
lives in Khan Yunis, told the Associated Press that a missile fired
by a helicopter slammed into a three-story apartment building. Three
people were wounded and an ambulance attempting to evacuate them came
under gunfire, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Sunday, two Palestinians were killed in separate incidents
in the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   The army said it killed a member of the Islamic Jihad movement in
the Jenin refugee camp after he opened fire. And a Palestinian farmer
was shot in the back while picking olives. Residents said he was
killed by Jewish settlers, who human rights organizations say have
been harassing Palestinian farmers in recent days as the olive
harvest gets underway. The Israeli police said they were
investigating the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   The killings came as European Union foreign policy chief Javier
Solana met Israeli Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer and Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres in a fresh bid to end Israeli-Palestinian
violence. No information emerged from the talks.</TE>
<TE>   Solana was due to meet Palestinian Authority President Yasser
Arafat today. Arafat's security advisor Mohammed Dahlan told
reporters after talks with Solana in Gaza that the EU official and
Arafat would "review the steps Israel has taken to destroy peace
efforts and the ongoing attacks on the Palestinian people."</TE>
<TE>   Ben-Eliezer criticized contacts between the European Union and
Arafat as a "waste of time" and accused the Palestinian leader of
doing "everything in order to block this process" of reforming the
Palestinian Authority.</TE>
<TE>   Solana said before arriving in the region Saturday that he would
emphasize the need for Israelis and Palestinians to resume peace
talks stalled since 2000 and push forward a new plan from the
"quartet" of U.N., U.S., Russian and EU mediators.</TE>
<TE>   In September, the quartet outlined a peace plan demanding that
Palestinians reform their governing authority and that Israel
withdraw troops from West Bank cities, aiming at a final peace
settlement in three years.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Middle East envoy William Burns is to follow Solana to the
region.</TE>

<HD>Founder of Opus Dei Becomes Newest Saint</HD>
<DH>Religion: Influential Catholic group has fielded criticism
for its methods of recruitment and practices such as
self-flagellation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VATICAN CITY</DL>
<LD>Pope John Paul II raised to sainthood Sunday the founder of Opus Dei,
in effect giving the ultimate seal of approval to an influential but
much criticized Roman Catholic group that calls for holiness in
everyday life.</LD>
<LD>   Spanish-born Josemaria Escriva de Balaguer "was a master in the
use of prayer, which he considered an extraordinary 'weapon' with
which to redeem the world," John Paul said in his homily at the
canonization service in St. Peter's Square.</LD>
<LD>   Escriva ceaselessly reminded his followers that their spiritual
life and their family, professional and social lives "should not be
separate but should constitute a single existence 'holy and filled
with God,' " the pontiff said. "His teaching is relevant and urgent
today.... He continues to remind us of the need not to let ourselves
be daunted by the materialistic culture that threatens to dissolve
the more genuine identity of Christ's disciples."</LD>
<TE>   An orderly and well-dressed crowd that police put at 300,000, made
up largely of people from around the world associated with Opus Dei,
filled the square and extended down a major street to the Tiber
River.</TE>
<TE>   "We try with all our heart to get to heaven, to go with God and to
work to get people to God," explained Rosa Marcela Ojeda de Lozano,
58, an Opus Dei member who came from Mexico City with her husband.
"All the people in Opus Dei win heaven through their professional
work.... I'm the general manager in an institute of the family. I try
to make the world better."</TE>
<TE>   Opus Dei, which means "God's Work," claims 84,000 members
worldwide, including 1,800 priests. It also has hundreds of thousands
of "cooperators" who take part in some activities but have not
formally joined. Most members live independently whether married or
single, but thousands are "numeraries" who commit themselves to
celibacy, live in group houses for men or women, donate their
salaries to the organization and live off stipends from it.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the criticism of Opus Dei focuses on how these numeraries
are recruited, how they live and whether they really feel free to
leave. Particularly controversial is the practice of mortification by
self-flagellation or by wearing around the thigh for up to two hours
a day a "cilice," a centuries-old aid to spirituality that can range
from a belt of prickly cloth to a band with dull spikes.</TE>
<TE>   The canonization of Escriva, a Spanish priest who founded Opus Dei
in 1928, came just 27 years after his death, in one of the quickest
passages to sainthood in Catholic history. He is the 468th saint
proclaimed by John Paul, who has declared more saints than all his
predecessors in the last four centuries combined.</TE>
<TE>   John Paul, 82, has consistently shown support for Opus Dei. In
1982, he made it the church's only "personal prelature," a term for a
jurisdiction that governs people rather than a geographical area such
as a diocese. Papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls is one of the
group's most prominent members.</TE>
<TE>   Many educated professionals are in Opus Dei. Toward the end of
Gen. Francisco Franco's 1939-75 dictatorship in Spain, many of the
technocrats in his government were Opus Dei members. Reflecting its
growing strength in the United States, Opus Dei opened a $43-million
New York City headquarters last year.</TE>
<TE>   The group has also been accused of using financial clout to wield
disproportionate influence within the church--with the rapid
canonization of its founder often cited as one example.</TE>
<TE>   Critics charge that Opus Dei numeraries make friends with young
Catholics, introduce them to group activities and induce them to take
the initial steps of joining before they are made fully aware of what
is involved.</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth Louise Heil, 26, a California woman living in Rome who
works at the Vatican Museums and the Opus Dei press office, said she
joined the group during her senior year of college, although not as a
numerary.</TE>
<TE>   Opus Dei "gives me a very concrete way of making my faith real in
my everyday life," she said. "It makes you realize that everything
you do can be for the glory of God and also helping others."</TE>
<TE>   Heil said that recruiting friends and relatives to join Opus Dei
is simply a way to help them.</TE>
<TE>   "If you firmly believe people are happy only if close to God, then
you want your friends and family to be happy," she said. "It's a very
linear process. It's nothing Opus Dei made up. Early Christians
brought their friends to meet Jesus."</TE>
<TE>   Wearing the cilice, Heil said, helps people learn to care less
about their own comfort and more about helping other people.</TE>
<TE>   People take classes before becoming numeraries, she added, so "it
personally surprises me that [some] people don't understand what
they're getting into."</TE>
<TE>   Mary Claire Jensen, a librarian from Thousand Oaks who was present
for the service, blamed the criticism on "misunderstanding" and
predicted that now "maybe some of the controversy will die down."</TE>
<TE>   "When I met my husband, who was already a member of the Work, I
thought this was just another funky group. I didn't understand. Then
I learned it wasn't," said Jensen, who remains a cooperator. Jensen
said she credits Escriva's intercession with saving the life of her
son when he was born 17 years ago with cardiac and respiratory
arrest.</TE>
<TE>   The canonization "will leave no doubt in anybody's mind that Opus
Dei is fully blessed by the church," said Father Thomas Bohlin,
chancellor of the Prelature of Opus Dei. "It will put to rest a lot
of silly things that have been said."</TE>
<TE>   Maria De Cristofaro of The Times' Rome Bureau contributed to this
report.</TE>

<HD>Bin Laden Is Reportedly on Tape</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Voice says 'youths of God' are planning more
attacks against the U.S.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>CAIRO</DL>
<LD>The Arab satellite station Al Jazeera broadcast an audiotape Sunday
in which a male voice attributed to Osama bin Laden says the "youths
of God" are planning more attacks against the United States.</LD>
<LD>   "By God, the youths of God are preparing for you things that would
fill your hearts with terror and target your economic lifeline until
you stop your oppression and aggression" against Muslims, the voice
on the tape says.</LD>
<LD>   It wasn't immediately clear when the tape was made. The short
message was broadcast with a picture of Bin Laden in the background.</LD>
<TE>   In Washington, a White House official said: "We're aware of the
tape and its contents. We will be reviewing it."</TE>
<TE>   The man on the tape says his message is addressed to the American
people, whom he urges to "understand the message of the New York and
Washington attacks which came in response to some of your previous
crimes."</TE>
<TE>   "But those who follow the activities of the band of criminals in
the White House, the Jewish agents, who are preparing for an attack
on the Muslim world ... feel that you have not understood anything
from the message of the two attacks," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "So let America increase the pace of this conflict or decrease it,
and we will respond in kind," he says. The reference appeared to be
to the U.S.-Iraq confrontation, which could date the tape to recent
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Al Jazeera has become known for its broadcasts of audiotapes and
video footage of Al Qaeda leaders.</TE>

<HD>Military Inc. Dominates Life in Pakistan</HD>
<DH>Asia: The armed forces prevail not only in government but
also in the economy. Elections this week are unlikely to alter the
situation much.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL WATSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KARACHI, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>Generals have governed Pakistan longer than politicians, and over
their many years in power, the military has refined the skill of
stealth rule to an art. So when voters go to the polls Thursday in
the first general elections since Gen. Pervez Musharraf seized power
in an October 1999 coup, the men in uniform won't be surrendering
power--just sharing some of it.</LD>
<LD>   A growing number of detractors say Musharraf, who declared himself
president last year, is trying to disguise military rule as liberal
democracy. Musharraf, who will remain president and commanding
general after the legislative elections, forced through
constitutional changes in August to guarantee the armed forces a
central role in government.</LD>
<LD>   Musharraf has granted himself the power to dismiss an elected
parliament and prime minister. He also has created a National
Security Council and given several seats to military officers.
Opponents say that will allow the military to oversee an elected
government.</LD>
<TE>   In addition, Musharraf has extended the military's reach into
state-run companies and agencies, installing loyal officers in place
of civilians at the top of the entities that control everything from
the phone system and postal service to road construction and computer
databases on citizens.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From Cereal to Fertilizer</TE>
<TE>   This administrative power melds with the military's already
enormous commercial enterprises, which dominate large parts of
Pakistan's economy with a network of companies that make products
such as breakfast cereals, milk and fertilizer. The military's
business ventures include an airline, an FM radio station, a pay-TV
channel, insurance, real estate and travel agencies, and one of the
country's largest banks. All this in a nation that devotes a very
high 29% of its budget to the armed forces, according to the World
Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Critics call this the relentless militarization of Pakistani
society and charge that the generals who seized power promising to
rid the country of corruption are now supervising a more subtle form
of it.</TE>
<TE>   Ayesha Siddiqa-Agha, a security analyst at Qaid-e-Azam University
in Islamabad, the capital, has spent years investigating the
military's business interests and says they aren't nearly as clean as
they claim.</TE>
<TE>   "When you dig into them, you find out they are inefficient, and
there is evidence of corruption," Siddiqa-Agha said. "There is also
evidence of corruption linked to monopolization of government
contracts. That has increased in the past three or four years."</TE>
<TE>   Military regimes have governed Pakistan for more than half of the
55 years since Britain granted the Indian subcontinent independence.
But the armed forces, especially the army, have strengthened their
control over government and the economy under Musharraf, said Mian
Raza Rabbani, a former federal law minister.</TE>
<TE>   "After Oct. 12, 1999, Pakistan has perhaps witnessed the greatest
militarization of civil society in its entire history," said Rabbani,
secretary-general of exiled former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's
Pakistan People's Party. "Never has the military been inducted into
such low levels of civil society."</TE>
<TE>   Maj. Gen. Rashid Qureshi, Musharraf's spokesman, said Rabbani and
Siddiqa-Agha are wrong and insisted that the 1999 coup gave Pakistan
a high-quality government that is cleaning up the problems it
inherited.</TE>
<TE>   "In the last years, there has been no martial law or military
government," Qureshi said. "It's a government of civilians. President
Musharraf selected the best Pakistani civilians available in the
world. And they are the ones who formed the cabinets at the central
level and at the provincial level. There is no 'militarization of
society.' "</TE>
<TE>   But Siddiqa-Agha, former director of naval research for Pakistan's
navy, said Musharraf has put about 500 uniformed officers in control
of government agencies and state-run corporations. The president has
made no commitment to return any of those jobs to civilians, and a
newly elected government isn't likely to insist on it, she added.</TE>
<TE>   "The military is still powerful, and the fear is there,"
Siddiqa-Agha said. "You don't want to go out of your way and annoy
the military as soon as you take over."</TE>
<TE>   One military man now heading a civilian agency is Maj. Gen.
Farrukh Javed, whom Musharraf installed as chairman of the National
Highway Authority, which is planning projects worth more than $800
million this fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the head of a private consortium building a major
highway admitted at a news conference that he won the $117-million
contract--awarded without competitive public bidding--with the help
of retired army Brig. Aftab Siddiqui, the father-in-law of
Musharraf's son Bilal.</TE>
<TE>   Sheikh Yousaf, who owns Husnain Construction Ltd., said the
brigadier was a consultant on the project. But he isn't on the
payroll anymore, Yousaf added. When reporters pressed for more
details, Yousaf's son ran onto the stage and told him not to answer
any more questions.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan's water and power agency is another major state entity
run by a man handpicked from the army. Lt. Gen. Zulfiqar Ali Khan has
headed the agency since 1998, when then-Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
asked the military to take charge of it because it was a mess, said
Qureshi, the presidential spokesman. Khan retired from the army last
year, but in his portrait on the agency's Web site he is dressed in
army khaki and a beret.</TE>
<TE>   One of Pakistan's biggest employers, the utility is accused of
squandering money and, in at least one case, stealing it.</TE>
<TE>   In June, Pakistan's auditor-general reported that $32 million was
embezzled from the utility from 2000 to 2001. And it is one of three
state-run entities that "are unanimously seen as the most corrupt
institutions and responsible for most of the harassment of the
private sector," John Wall, the World Bank's director for Pakistan,
told a Paris conference in April.</TE>
<TE>   The second company that Wall singled out was the Karachi Electric
Supply Corp. Ltd., also run by Khan and army Brig. Tariq Saddozai.
The government insists that both firms are well run.</TE>
<TE>   "The army was asked to assist a civilian government [in 1998] to
reform these two institutions, and today you will find they are
vastly improved," Qureshi said. The water and power agency "was
collapsing four years ago. It's been reformed and is much better than
what it was, and that was what the army has been able to do."</TE>
<TE>   Third on the World Bank corruption list was the tax-collection
agency. It is headed by a civilian.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Praise for Officers</TE>
<TE>   Some military officers have garnered praise for their efforts to
eliminate graft at public agencies. Transparency International, a
Berlin-based anti-corruption organization, lauded Brig. Mohammad
Behram Khan of the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board in February for
committing himself to award contracts to low bidders and to shun
bribes and kickbacks. He also saved the utility millions in
consulting fees, the group said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, complaints of foul water supplies and chronic shortages
remain. A leaked report by the utility's staff said the drinking
water for about 14 million people is heavily polluted with toxic
waste. Khan was replaced last month by a retired army brigadier.
Utility officials did not respond to an interview request Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond running many public agencies, Pakistan's armed forces wield
still more economic clout through four foundations created to aid
retired personnel and their families by giving them jobs, a practice
dating back to British rule. The largest is the Fauji, which
translates as "military."</TE>
<TE>   The Fauji was established as a charity in 1953, with an endowment
of $300,000. It is now a corporate empire that includes sugar mills,
a cement factory and a natural gas supplier. Another foundation, the
Army Welfare Trust, controls one of Pakistan's biggest financial
institutions, Askari Commercial Bank Ltd. Such conglomerates,
Siddiqa-Agha said, take business from private companies.</TE>
<TE>   Like the defense budget, the military's business dealings are
largely beyond public scrutiny, and the armed forces discourage
journalists and others from asking questions, Rabbani and others
complain.</TE>
<TE>   Shaheen Sehbai, ex-editor of the English-language daily the News,
said he often was pressured by officials to either not publish, or at
least tone down, stories that Musharraf's government didn't like.</TE>
<TE>   In July 2001, his newspaper uncovered an alleged $17-million
insider fraud at the Employees Old Age Benefit Institution, the
government's pension fund. Sehbai said he quickly took heat from
senior officials.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Exile in Virginia</TE>
<TE>   "If you expose corruption, you pay," said Sehbai, who now lives in
self-imposed exile in Virginia and publishes the crusading South Asia
Tribune on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   He said police are harassing relatives he left behind, including
several who have been jailed for questioning on what Sehbai insists
is a trumped-up charge that he robbed his former brother-in-law's
house at gunpoint. A cousin's 18-year-old son has been in jail since
late August without charge. Qureshi, Musharraf's spokesman, insisted
that police are acting independently in a criminal investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Sehbai fled Pakistan with his wife and four children in February,
after publishing a story that said Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh, convicted
in the murder of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, had
admitted links to Pakistan's Inter-Service Intelligence agency.</TE>
<TE>   Sehbai said he was urged to apologize to the ISI's political and
media chief, Maj. Gen. Ehtasham Zamir. But he refused.</TE>
<TE>   "They wanted me to go and tell them that I wouldn't do it again,
and then they would all be happy.... I won't do that. I'm not going
to tell them I'm sorry."</TE>
<TE>   Rabbani, of Bhutto's party, and other politicians accuse Musharraf
of using the ISI to rig Thursday's election by coercing opposition
candidates to quit and join parties that support him.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of candidates have been threatened with prosecution on
corruption charges, or punishment, if they don't change allegiance,
Rabbani charged. Musharraf's officials deny the claim. Rabbani's
office has submitted a thick file on the alleged tampering to
Pakistan's election commissioner, who has promised to investigate.</TE>
<TE>   "In the history of Pakistan, we have not seen such interference in
an attempt to gerrymander the results of the elections," Rabbani
said.</TE>

<DH>Mideast: The growing military ties between the U.S. and
Qatar as the threat of war looms bring advantages for both sides.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DOHA, Qatar</DL>
<LD>Standing beside the ice skating rink at the center of the largest
indoor shopping mall in the Persian Gulf region, Yousuf Haidar
proudly explains what he sees happening around him.</LD>
<LD>   "Qatar is joining the modern age," said Haidar, 40, a furniture
store manager on a shopping spree with his family. "The world is
finally learning about Qatar."</LD>
<LD>   If the U.S. invades Iraq, the world will get a chance to learn a
great deal about this once-isolated emirate, a moderate, pro-Western
ally in a region conflicted about how to deal with the expected war.</LD>
<TE>   Qatar is perhaps best known as the home of Al Jazeera, the
upstart, sometimes biased, often-controversial pan-Arab TV network
financed by the nation's ruling family. For five years, the station
has attracted an audience of 30 million. It has provided a soapbox
for the family's views, which include support for a free press and
rapprochement with Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Though neighboring nations are reluctant to be seen as overly
friendly with the United States, Qatar's supreme ruler, Sheik Hamad
ibn Khalifa al Thani, has put out the welcome mat for the American
military, its troops, its heavy bombers and its command and control
structure. Qatar has approved plans to greatly expand Al Udeid Air
Base, outside Doha, the capital, a probable nerve center in the event
of an attack on Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The new closeness between the U.S. and Qatar is a marriage made of
considerable convenience even if it does annoy neighboring Saudi
Arabia, whose Prince Sultan Air Base has previously been the major
U.S. outpost in the region.</TE>
<TE>   Qatar has only a tiny army and a dozen French-made fighter jets.
By inviting the U.S. military, the nation gets the kind of security
that it feels is necessary for economic growth in an unstable region.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. gets a foil to Saudi Arabia, which has criticized
President Bush's go-it-alone rhetoric about Iraq and wants a strong
U.N. resolution before allowing air sorties against Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   "Only the United States can balance the powers in this region and
provide us with stability," said Hassan M. Saleh Ansari, director of
the Gulf Studies Center at the 9,000-student University of Qatar.
"This is a relationship that works for both sides."</TE>
<TE>   S. Rob Sobhani, adjunct professor of international relations at
Georgetown University, said the Qatari leadership could be hailed
throughout the Arab world if its bases are used by the U.S. for a
quick knockdown of Saddam Hussein, with few casualties. That acclaim,
he said, would bring more respect for Hamad's vision of a
pluralistic, pro-Western future.</TE>
<TE>   "Qatar is doing things that are clearly going to expose Saudi
Arabia's bankrupt foreign policy," Sobhani said by telephone. "Saudi
Arabia is governed by men in their 70s and 80s who resist all change.
The [Qatari] emir is in his early 50s, and his vision is much
different."</TE>
<TE>   Public opinion is difficult to gauge in a society that does not
hold national elections and where dissent is often banned. Still,
there are those who doubt the wisdom of the emir's invitation to the
U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Mohamed Saleh Musfir, former editor of a leading Arabic-language
newspaper here and now a political science lecturer at the University
of Qatar, finds the presence of the U.S. military "very provocative."</TE>
<TE>   "This will lead the fundamentalists to be even stronger in their
arguments and to be stronger in their actions," Musfir said. "Nobody
knows what will happen; there is a gloominess, a darkness in our
future."</TE>
<TE>   During the 1991 war against Iraq, Qatar was a secondary staging
area; Qatari troops joined the coalition forces and acquitted
themselves well. In retaliation, Iraq fired a Scud missile at Qatar,
but it landed in the vast desert.</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, Musfir said, most people supported military action to
liberate Kuwait. Now, there is no sense of urgency and also
widespread disbelief that Iraq has stockpiled weapons of mass
destruction as the Bush administration insists, he added.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe this [expanded air base] is not to protect us but to
protect U.S. interests and the Israeli influence in the region,"
Musfir said. "Once, Iraq was a potential enemy, but now it is the
U.S. and Israel."</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 2,000 U.S. Air Force and Army troops are stationed at
Al Udeid, many living in a sprawling tent city. The base services
several dozen transport and refueling aircraft that have been part of
the air campaign over Afghanistan. With a 15,000-foot runway--the
longest in the region--the base could easily accommodate heavy
bombers. A Qatari official says the U.S. has suggested that it may
want to station as many as 9,000 troops in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Next month, the U.S. Central Command in Tampa, Fla., is to bring
600 personnel here for a three-week exercise called Internal Look.
The exercise is meant to test the command's ability to quickly
reallocate forces needed to provide logistics and strategic
coordination.</TE>
<TE>   Ivan Eland, director of defense policy at the libertarian Cato
Institute in Washington, said the Qatari base "is politically
important in prodding the Saudis to change their opposition to the
use of their facilities." The alternative, Eland said, is that "the
Saudis would be conspicuously left out of any military operation"
against Iraq, a blow to Saudi Arabia's self-image.</TE>
<TE>   Already annoyed at the Qatari ruling family for its financial
support of Al Jazeera, which has broadcast interviews with critics of
the Saudi royal family, the Saudi government recalled its ambassador
to Qatar for consultations. Two days later, an anonymous Saudi
diplomat was quoted as criticizing the Qatari government for moving
unilaterally to support the American military without consulting
other Persian Gulf nations.</TE>
<TE>   Ansari said the Saudi reaction was predictable.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people in the Arab world do not give Qatar any credit,"
he said. "They believe Qatar is small and irrelevant and shouldn't
have its own initiatives."</TE>
<TE>   Hamad, however, has had a blizzard of initiatives since he deposed
his father in a bloodless coup in 1995 and then sued him to return
billions of dollars in oil revenue that Hamad said should be used to
upgrade public services. Hamad has survived at least two coup
attempts, one apparently launched from inside Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a man who knows his own mind and is not afraid of what
others think," said Joseph Ghougassian, who served as U.S. ambassador
from 1985 to 1989 when Hamad was crown prince and defense minister.
The two have remained close.</TE>
<TE>   "He used to tell me: 'I will be ruler of a sovereign nation, and
the size of the nation should not dictate what our policies are,' "
Ghougassian said. "He would say: 'I will do what I think is best even
if that means I am alone.' "</TE>
<TE>   Roughly the size of Connecticut with a population of about
640,000, Qatar is rich and is getting richer as its gas reserves, the
third-largest in the world, begin to pay off.</TE>
<TE>   "The emir has made Qatar rich," said Emadi Issa, 45, a grocer. "If
he says the Americans are good, they are good. But I do not fear
Saddam like the Americans do."</TE>
<TE>   Hamad, however, remembers the crippling economic impact on Qatar
of the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s that disrupted normal shipping
lanes. As an oil and gas exporter, Qatar remains vulnerable to such
disruptions, which the emir hopes the U.S. military will keep from
reoccurring.</TE>
<TE>   To remove its image as a backwater of the Persian Gulf, Qatar has
embarked on an aggressive modernizing campaign. Dozens of high-rise
hotels, government buildings and the City Center mall--the five-level
emporium with the indoor skating rink and 225 stores--have sprouted,
with dozens of cranes at work on other projects.</TE>
<TE>   The maverick emir also has fostered pro-Western initiatives. He
opened a dialogue with Israel and permitted his wife, Sheika Mozah
Nasser Misnad, to be more visible by championing causes such as
education. A new constitution is being written that will allow for an
elected parliament, and voter registration drives have been started.</TE>
<TE>   Yet even those who support the U.S. presence in Qatar are
concerned about a backlash caused by the growth in U.S. military
personnel unfamiliar with the emirate's conservative lifestyle.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope the Americans show respect to our society," said Ansari,
who studied at the University of Michigan and is married to an
American. "We don't like to hear stories from Japan" about U.S.
personnel fighting in public and abusing local women, he said,
adding, "That is the kind of thing that destroys relationships."</TE>
<TE>   At the ice rink, a young enlisted man, identifiable as an American
serviceman by his short haircut and Dallas Cowboys sweatshirt,
declined to give his name. Invisibility is the preferred mode for
off-base activity.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not here," he joked. "Pretty soon there will be a lot more of
us, and they won't be here either."</TE>

<SE>ENRIQUE'S JOURNEY</SE>
<AU>SONIA NAZARIO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At 1 a.m., Enrique waits on the edge of the water.</LD>
<LD>   "If you get caught, I don't know you," says the man called El
Tirindaro. He is stern.</LD>
<LD>   Enrique nods. So do two other immigrants, a Mexican brother and
sister, waiting with him. They strip to their underwear.</LD>
<TE>   Across the Rio Grande stands a 50-foot pole equipped with U.S.
Border Patrol cameras. In daylight, Enrique has counted four sport
utility vehicles near the pole, each with agents. Now, in the
darkness, he cannot see any.</TE>
<TE>   He leaves it up to El Tirindaro, a subspecies of smuggler known as
a patero because he pushes people across the river on inner tubes by
paddling soundlessly with his feet, like a pato, or duck. El
Tirindaro has spent hours at this spot studying everything that moves
on the other side.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique, 17, tears up a small piece of paper and scatters it on
the riverbank. It is his mother's phone number. He has memorized it.
Now the agents cannot use it to locate and deport her. She left him
behind in Honduras more than 11 years ago and entered the United
States illegally to seek work. In all, Enrique has spent four months
trying to find her.</TE>
<TE>   El Tirindaro holds an inner tube. The Mexicans climb on.
He paddles them to an island in midstream. He returns for Enrique with
the tube.</TE>
<TE>   He steadies it in the water.</TE>
<TE>   Carefully, Enrique climbs aboard. The Rio Bravo, as it is called
here, is swollen with rain. Two nights before, it had killed a
youngster he knew. Enrique cannot swim, and he is afraid.</TE>
<TE>   El Tirindaro places a plastic garbage bag on Enrique's lap. It
contains dry clothing for the four of them. Then El Tirindaro paddles
and starts to push. A swift current grabs the tube and sweeps it into
the river. Wind whips off Enrique's cap. Drizzle coats his face. He
dips in a hand. The water is cold.</TE>
<TE>   All at once, he sees a flash of white--one of the SUVs, probably
with a dog in back, inching along a trail above the river.</TE>
<TE>   Silence. No bullhorn barks, "Turn back."</TE>
<TE>   The inner tube lurches along. It is May 21, 2000. Agents will
catch 108,973 migrants in this area alone during fiscal 2000. The
tube sloshes and bounces. Enrique grips the valve stem. The sky is
overcast, and the river is dark. In the distance, bits of lights
dance on the surface.</TE>
<TE>   At last, he sees the island, overgrown with willows and reeds. He
seizes the limb of a willow. It tears off. With both hands, he lays
hold of a larger branch, and the inner tube swings onto the silt and
grass. They have crossed the southern channel. On the other side of
the island flows the northern channel, even more frightening because
it is closer to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   El Tirindaro circles the island on foot and looks across
the water. The white SUV reappears, less than 100 yards away. It is
moving slowly along the dirt trail, high on the riverbank.</TE>
<TE>   Its roof lights flash red and blue on the water, creating a
psychedelic sheen. Agents turn to aim a spotlight straight at the
island.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique and the Mexicans dive to the ground face-first. If the
agents spot them and lie in wait, it could spell doom for Enrique. He
is closer to his mother than ever. Authorities could deport the
Mexicans back across the river, but they could send him all the way
to Honduras. It would mean starting out for the ninth time.</TE>
<TE>   For half an hour, everyone lies stone-still.</TE>
<TE>   Crickets sing, and water rushes around the rocks. Finally the
agents seem to give up. El Tirindaro waits and watches. He makes
certain, then returns.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique whispers: Take the others first.</TE>
<TE>   El Tirindaro loads the Mexicans onto the tube. Their weight sinks
it almost out of sight. Slowly, they lumber across the water.</TE>
<TE>   Minutes later, El Tirindaro returns. "Get over here," he says to
Enrique. "Climb up." He has other instructions: Don't rustle the
garbage bag holding the clothes. Don't step on twigs. Don't paddle;
it makes noise.</TE>
<TE>   El Tirindaro slips into the water behind the tube and kicks his
legs beneath the surface. It takes only a minute or two. He and
Enrique reach a spot where the river slows, and Enrique grabs another
branch. They pull ashore and touch soft, slippery mud.</TE>
<TE>   In his underwear, Enrique stands for the first time on U.S. soil.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NEARLY FROZEN</TE>
<TE>   As El Tirindaro hides the inner tube, he spots the Border Patrol.</TE>
<TE>   He and the three immigrants hurry along the edge of the Rio Grande
to a tributary called Zacate Creek.</TE>
<TE>   Get in, El Tirindaro says.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique walks into the creek. It is cold. He bends his knees and
lowers himself to his chin. His broken teeth chatter so hard they
hurt; he cups a hand over his mouth, trying to stop them. For an hour
and a half, they stand in Zacate Creek in silence. Effluent spills
into the water from a three-foot-wide pipe close by. It is connected
to a sewage treatment plant on the edge of Laredo, Texas. Enrique can
smell it.</TE>
<TE>   El Tirindaro walks ahead, scouting as he goes.</TE>
<TE>   At his command, Enrique and the others climb out of the water.
Enrique is numb. He falls to the ground, nearly frozen.</TE>
<TE>   "Dress quickly," El Tirindaro says.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique steps out of his wet undershorts and tosses them away.
They are his last possession from home. He puts on dry jeans, a dry
shirt and his two left shoes. It has been three days since his right
one was stolen, and all he has been able to find is a second left
shoe to replace it. He told his mother about it when he called her,
but there was no time for her to send any money for a proper pair.</TE>
<TE>   El Tirindaro offers everyone a piece of bread and a soda. The
others eat and drink. Enrique is too nervous. Being on the outskirts
of Laredo means they are near homes. If dogs bark, the Border Patrol
will suspect intruders.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the hard part," El Tirindaro says.</TE>
<TE>   He runs. Enrique races behind him. The Mexicans follow, up a steep
embankment, along a well-worn dirt path, past mesquite bushes and
behind some tamarind trees, until they are next to a large, round,
flat tank. It is part of the sewage plant.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond is an open space.</TE>
<TE>   El Tirindaro glances nervously to the right and left. Nothing.</TE>
<TE>   "Follow me," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Now he runs faster. Numbness washes out of Enrique's legs. It
disappears in a wave of fear. They sprint next to a fence, then along
a narrow path on a cliff above the creek. They dash down another
embankment, into the dry upstream channel of Zacate Creek, under a
pipe, then a pedestrian bridge, across the channel, up the opposite
embankment and out onto a two-lane residential street.</TE>
<TE>   Two cars pass. Winded, the four scuttle into bushes. Half a block
ahead, another car flashes its headlights.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   PUFFS OF CLOUDS</TE>
<TE>   It is a red Chevrolet Blazer with tinted windows. As they
reach it, locks click open. Enrique and the others scramble inside. In
front sit a Latino driver and a woman. Enrique has met them before,
at a house across the river frequented by El Tirindaro. They are part
of his smuggling network.</TE>
<TE>   It is 4 a.m. Enrique is exhausted. He climbs onto pillows in back.
They are like puffs of clouds, and he feels immense relief. He smiles
and says to himself, "Now that I'm in this car, no one can get me
out." The engine starts, and the driver passes back a pack of beer.
He asks Enrique to put it into a cooler. The driver pops a top.</TE>
<TE>   For a moment, Enrique worries: What if the driver has too many?</TE>
<TE>   The Blazer heads toward Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   Border Patrol agents pay attention to Blazers and other SUVs.
Headlights tilted up mean there are people in the back, weighing down
the vehicle, says Alexander D. Hernandez, a supervisor in Cotulla,
Texas. Weaving means the load is heavy and causing sway. When the
agents notice, they pull alongside and shine a flashlight into the
eyes of the passengers. If the riders do not look over but seem
frozen in their seats, they are likely to be illegal immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique sleeps until El Tirindaro shakes him. They are out of
Laredo and half a mile south of a Border Patrol checkpoint.</TE>
<TE>   "Get up!" El Tirindaro says. Enrique can tell he has been
drinking. Five beers are gone. The Blazer stops. Enrique and the two
Mexicans, with El Tirindaro leading, climb a wire fence and walk
east, away from the freeway. Then they turn north, parallel to it.
Enrique can see the checkpoint at a distance.</TE>
<TE>   Every car must stop.</TE>
<TE>   "U.S. citizens?" agents ask. Often, they check for documents.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique and his group walk 10 minutes more, then turn west, back
toward the freeway. They crouch next to a billboard. Overhead, the
stars are receding, and he can see the first light of dawn.</TE>
<TE>   The Blazer pulls up.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique sinks back into the pillows. He thinks: I have crossed the
last big hurdle. Suddenly he is overwhelmed. Never has he felt so
happy.</TE>
<TE>   He stares at the ceiling and drifts into a deep, blissful sleep.</TE>
<TE>   Four hundred miles later, the Blazer pulls into a gas station
on the outskirts of Dallas. Enrique awakens. El Tirindaro is gone. He
has left without saying goodbye. From conversations in Mexico,
Enrique knows that El Tirindaro gets $100 a client. Enrique's mother,
Lourdes, has promised $1,200. Clearly, this is all business, and the
driver is the boss; he gets most of the money. The patero is on his
way back to Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Along with fuel, the driver buys more beer, and the Blazer rolls
into Dallas about noon. America looks beautiful. The buildings are
huge. The freeways have traffic exchanges with double and triple
decks. They are nothing like the dirt streets at home. Everything is
so clean.</TE>
<TE>   The driver drops off the Mexicans and takes Enrique to a large
house. Inside are bags of clothing in various sizes and American
styles, to outfit clients so they no longer stand out.</TE>
<TE>   They telephone his mother.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   LOURDES</TE>
<TE>   Lourdes, 35, has come to love North Carolina. People are polite.
There are plenty of jobs for immigrants, and it seems to be safe. She
can leave her car unlocked, as well as her house.</TE>
<TE>   A gray album holds treasures: pictures of Belky, her daughter back
home. At 7, Belky wears a white First Communion dress; at 9, a yellow
cheerleader's skirt; at 15, for her quinceanera, a pink taffeta dress
and white satin shoes. There are pictures of Enrique too: at 8 in a
tank top, with four piglets at his feet; at 13 in the photograph at
Belky's quinceanera, the serious-looking little brother.</TE>
<TE>   Lourdes has not slept. All night, since Enrique's last call from a
pay phone across the Rio Grande, she has been having visions of him
dead, floating on the river, his body wet and swollen. She told her
boyfriend, "My greatest fear is to never see him again."</TE>
<TE>   Now a female smuggler is on the phone. The woman says: We have
your son in Texas, but $1,200 is not enough. $1,700.</TE>
<TE>   Lourdes grows suspicious. Maybe Enrique is dead, and the smugglers
are trying to cash in. "Put him on the line."</TE>
<TE>   He is out shopping for food, the smuggler says.</TE>
<TE>   Lourdes will not be put off.</TE>
<TE>   He is asleep, the smuggler says.</TE>
<TE>   How can he be both? Lourdes demands to talk to him.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the smuggler gives the phone to Enrique.</TE>
<TE>   "Sos tu?" his mother asks anxiously. "Is it you?"</TE>
<TE>   "Si, Mami, it's me."</TE>
<TE>   Still, his mother is not sure. She does not recognize his voice.
She has heard it only half a dozen times in 11 years.</TE>
<TE>   "Sos tu?" she asks again. Then twice more. She grasps for
something, anything, that she can ask this boy--a question that no
one but Enrique can answer. She remembers what he told her about his
shoes when he called on the pay phone.</TE>
<TE>   "What kind of shoes do you have on?" she asks.</TE>
<TE>   "Two left shoes," Enrique says.</TE>
<TE>   Fear drains from his mother like a wave back into the sea. It is
Enrique. She feels a moment of pure happiness.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WAITING</TE>
<TE>   She takes $500 she has saved, borrows $1,200 from her boyfriend
and wires it to Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   In the house with the clothing, the smugglers wait. From the bags,
Enrique puts on clean pants, a shirt and a new pair of shoes. The
smugglers take him to a restaurant. He eats chicken smothered in
cream sauce. Clean, sated, in his mother's adopted country, he is
happy.</TE>
<TE>   They go to Western Union. But there is no money under his mother's
name, not even a message.</TE>
<TE>   How could she do this?</TE>
<TE>   At worst, Enrique figures, he can break away. Run.</TE>
<TE>   But the smugglers call again.</TE>
<TE>   She says she has sent the money through a female immigrant who
lives with her, because the woman gets a Western Union discount. The
money should be there under the woman's name.</TE>
<TE>   It is.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique has no time to celebrate. The smugglers take him to a gas
station, where they meet another man in the network. He puts Enrique
with four migrant men being routed to Orlando, Fla. They stay
overnight in Houston, and at midday, Enrique leaves Texas in a green
van.</TE>
<TE>   Five days later, Lourdes' boyfriend gets time off from work to
drive to Orlando, where Enrique has been staying with other migrants
and waiting for him to arrive. Her boyfriend is handsome, with
graying temples and a mustache. Enrique recognizes him from a video
that his Uncle Carlos had brought back from a visit.</TE>
<TE>   "Are you Lourdes' son?" the boyfriend asks.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique nods.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's go." They say little in the car, and Enrique falls asleep.</TE>
<TE>   By 8 a.m. on May 28, Enrique is in North Carolina. He awakens to
tires crossing highway seams: Click-click. Click-click. "Are we
lost?" he asks. "Are you sure we aren't lost? Do you know where we
are going?"</TE>
<TE>   "We're almost there."</TE>
<TE>   They are moving fast through pines and elms, past billboards and
fields, yellow lilies and purple lilacs. The road is freshly paved.
It goes over a bridge and passes cattle pastures with large rolls of
hay. On both sides are wealthy subdivisions. Then railroad tracks.
Finally, at the end of a short gravel street, some house trailers.
One is beige. Built in the 1950s, it has white metal awnings and is
framed in tall green trees.</TE>
<TE>   At 10 a.m., after more than 12,000 miles, 122 days and seven
futile attempts to find his mother, Enrique, 11 years older than when
she left him behind, bounds from the back seat of the car, up five
faded redwood steps, and swings open the white door of the mobile
home.</TE>
<TE>   To the left, beyond a tiny living room with dark wooden beams,
sits a girl with shoulder-length black hair and curly bangs. She is
at the kitchen table eating breakfast. He remembers a picture of her.
Her name is Diana.  She is 9.  She was born in California, not long after
Lourdes came to the United States, while she lived with a former boyfriend
from Honduras.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique leans over and kisses the girl on the cheek.</TE>
<TE>   "Are you my brother?"</TE>
<TE>   He nods. "Where is my mother? Where is my mother?"</TE>
<TE>   She motions past the kitchen to the far end of the trailer.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique runs. His feet zigzag down two narrow, brown-paneled
hallways.</TE>
<TE>   He opens a door.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, the room is cluttered, dark. On a queen-size bed, under a
window draped with lace curtains, his mother is asleep. He jumps
squarely onto the bed next to her. He gives her a hug. Then a kiss.</TE>
<TE>   "You're here, mi hijo."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm here," he says.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CONCLUSION</TE>
<TE>   "The Odyssey," an epic poem about a hero's journey home from war,
ends with reunion and peace. "The Grapes of Wrath," the classic novel
about the dust bowl and the migration of Oklahoma farmers to
California, ends with death and a glimmer of renewed life.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique's journey is not fiction, and its conclusion is more
complex and less dramatic. But it ends with a twist worthy of O.
Henry.</TE>
<TE>   Children like Enrique dream of finding their mothers and living
happily ever after. For weeks, perhaps months, these children and
their mothers cling to romanticized notions of how they should feel
toward each other.</TE>
<TE>   Then reality intrudes.</TE>
<TE>   The children show resentment because they were left behind. They
remember broken promises to return and accuse their mothers of lying.
They complain that their mothers work too hard to give them the
attention they have been missing. In extreme cases, they find love
and esteem elsewhere, by getting pregnant, marrying early or joining
gangs.</TE>
<TE>   Some are surprised to discover entire new families in the United
States--a stepfather, stepbrothers and stepsisters. Jealousies grow.
Stepchildren call the new arrivals mojados, or wetbacks, and threaten
to summon the Immigration and Naturalization Service to deport them.</TE>
<TE>   The mothers, for their part, demand respect for their sacrifice:
leaving their children for the children's sake. Some have been lonely
and worked hard to support themselves, to pay off their own smuggling
debts and save money to send home. When their children say, "You
abandoned me," they respond by hauling out tall stacks of money
transfer receipts.</TE>
<TE>   They think their children are ungrateful and bristle at the
independence they show--the same independence that helped the
children survive their journeys north. In time, mothers and children
discover they hardly know each other.</TE>
<TE>   At first, neither Enrique nor Lourdes cries. He kisses her again.
She holds him tightly. He has played this out in his mind a thousand
times. It is just as he thought it would be.</TE>
<TE>   All day they talk. He tells her about his travels: the clubbing on
top of a train, leaping off to save his life, the hunger, thirst and
fear. He has lost 28 pounds, down to 107. She cooks rice, beans and
fried pork. He sits at the table and eats. The boy she last saw when
he was in kindergarten is taller than she is. He has her nose, her
round face, her eyes, her curly hair.</TE>
<TE>   "Look, Mom, look what I put here." He pulls up his shirt. She sees
a tattoo.</TE>
<TE>   EnriqueLourdes, it says, across his chest.</TE>
<TE>   His mother winces. Tattoos, she says, are for delinquents, for
people in jail. "I'm going to tell you, son, I don't like this." She
pauses. "But at least if you had to get a tattoo, you remembered me."</TE>
<TE>   "I've always remembered you."</TE>
<TE>   He tells her about Honduras, how he stole his aunt's jewelry to
pay drug debts, how he wanted to get away from drugs, how he ached to
be with her.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Lourdes cries.</TE>
<TE>   She asks about Belky, her daughter in Honduras; her own
mother; and the deaths of two brothers. Then she stops. She feels too
guilty to go on.</TE>
<TE>   The trailer is awash in guilt. Eight people live here. Several
have left their children behind. All they have is pictures. Lourdes'
boyfriend has two sons in Hondruas. He has not seen them in five
years.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique likes the people in the trailer, especially his mother's
boyfriend; he could be a better father than his own dad, who
abandoned him to start another family.</TE>
<TE>   Three days after Enrique arrives, Lourdes' boyfriend helps him
find work as a painter. He earns $7 an hour. Within a week, he is
promoted to sander, making $9.50. With his first paycheck, he offers
to pick up $50 of the food bill. He buys Diana a gift: a pair of pink
sandals for $5.97. He sends money to Belky and to Maria Isabel Caria
Duron, his girlfriend in Honduras.</TE>
<TE>   Lourdes brags to her friends. "This is my son. Look at him! He is
so big. It's a miracle he's here."</TE>
<TE>   Whenever he leaves the house, she hugs him. When she comes home
from work, they sit on the couch, watching her favorite soap opera,
with her hand resting on his arm.</TE>
<TE>   Over time, though, they realize they are strangers. Neither knows
the other's likes or dislikes. At a grocery store, Lourdes reaches
for bottles of Coke. Enrique says he does not drink Coke--only
Sprite.</TE>
<TE>   He plans to work and make money. She wants him to study English,
learn a profession.</TE>
<TE>   He goes to a pool hall without asking permission. She becomes
upset.</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally, he uses profanities. She tells him not to. Both
remember their angry words.</TE>
<TE>   "No, Mami!" he says. "No one is going to change me."</TE>
<TE>   "Well, you'll have to change! If not, we will have problems. I
want a son who, when I say to do something, he says OK."</TE>
<TE>   "You can't tell me what to do!"</TE>
<TE>   The clash culminates when Maria Isabel telephones collect and her
call is rejected because some of the migrants in the trailer do not
know who she is.</TE>
<TE>   That was right, Lourdes says; they cannot afford collect calls
from just anyone.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique flares and begins to pack.</TE>
<TE>   Lourdes walks up behind him and spanks him hard on his buttocks,
several times.</TE>
<TE>   "You have no right to hit me! You didn't raise me."</TE>
<TE>   Enrique spends the night sleeping in her car.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, however, their love prevails. Their differences ease.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique and his mother are conciliatory at last. They are living
in her trailer home to this day.</TE>
<TE>   More than that, they might be joined by Maria Isabel.</TE>
<TE>   One day, Enrique phones Honduras. Maria Isabel is pregnant, as he
suspected before he left. On Nov. 2, 2000, she gives birth to their
daughter.</TE>
<TE>   She and Enrique name the baby Katherine Jasmin.</TE>
<TE>   The baby looks like him. She has his mouth, his nose, his eyes.</TE>
<TE>   An aunt urges Maria Isabel to go to the United States, alone. The
aunt promises to take care of the baby.</TE>
<TE>   "If I have the opportunity, I'll go," Maria Isabel says. "I'll
leave my baby behind."</TE>
<TE>   Enrique agrees. "We'll have to leave the baby behind."</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>President Bush's much anticipated speech on Iraq this evening is
officially billed as an address to the nation. But his words will be
carefully weighed far beyond America's frontiers.</LD>
<LD>   For the president, that could be a problem.</LD>
<LD>   The same folksy style, chin-first body language and no-frills
rhetoric he has successfully used to strip down complex issues and
reach into America's emotional heartland for political backing are a
turnoff to much of the world outside. And as he searches for new
allies abroad as well as backing at the U.N. for a Security Council
resolution tough enough to force Saddam Hussein from power, his style
frequently works against him.</LD>
<TE>   "It reinforces his image as a cowboy with a loose gun who's ready
to destroy the world," said Denis Lacorne, a senior associate at the
Center for International Studies and Research in Paris. "His
language, his style--they don't help."</TE>
<TE>   In the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, Bush aimed similar
rhetoric at Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda terrorist network,
vowing to "smoke Osama out and get him running" and likening Bin
Laden's status to that of a 19th century Wild West outlaw: "Wanted,
dead or alive." At that time, however, the United States was riding a
groundswell of support internationally, and those abroad realized
that with American outrage still white-hot, it was not a time for
diplomatic niceties.</TE>
<TE>   "His language after 9/11 was even more colorful than now, but
people understood he was angry," noted a senior U.N. official who
asked to remain anonymous. "There was genuine sympathy then, but not
now. Now there is skepticism, disdain."</TE>
<TE>   Though the world may have moved on, much of America has not, and
Bush's words play well in a domestic environment where television's
Fox News features its Iraq coverage under logos such as "Baggin'
Baghdad."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the Senate's majority leader, Tom Daschle (D-S.D.),
predicted Sunday that the Bush administration will receive strong
support from both Democrats and Republicans in the chamber for a
resolution empowering the United States to go to war with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "It will pass, and I suspect that there will be a broad bipartisan
coalition in support of it," Daschle said on NBC-TV's "Meet the
Press." The margin could be as wide as 75 to 25, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Some powerful Democrats were still holding out. Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy (D-Mass.), speaking on CBS-TV's "Face the Nation," said he
would not back the resolution. "The president hasn't made the case. A
war ought to be the last resort, not the first resort," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Daschle, the most senior congressional official to have
questioned the resolution, said he was leaning toward supporting what
he described as "the first preemptive, unilateral authorization of
the use of force" that Congress has ever considered.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, British officials said Foreign Secretary Jack Straw is
scheduled to travel to Iran, Jordan, Kuwait and Egypt this week to
drum up support in the Muslim world for the U.S.-British position on
Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the Bush persona is problematic even in Britain, America's
only clearly enthusiastic ally on the Iraq issue.</TE>
<TE>   During the summer lull in domestic politics, a period when British
commentators were far more intent on criticizing Bush's style and
motives than on measuring the threat from Iraq, polls in Britain
turned heavily against a confrontation that could lead to war.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last month, Prime Minister Tony Blair has persistently
tried to turn Britain's national conversation on Iraq away from one
revolving around Bush to one focused on Hussein. Early in September,
during a news conference in his Sedgefield constituency, Blair said
in a miffed tone that he thought "some of the criticism of George
Bush is just a parody of the George Bush that I know and work with."</TE>
<TE>   Said James Naughtie, host of BBC Radio's "Today" show, which is
morning coffee for Britain's political class: "Blair is very, very
aware of the difficulty British people have tuning in to the Bush
style. They find that homespun language almost alienating, the
simplification of issues which are clearly not. He comes across as
someone who can only speak in sound bites from grainy old
black-and-white westerns."</TE>
<TE>   The foreign take on Bush isn't all negative.</TE>
<TE>   Diplomats at the U.N. still talk approvingly of his speech last
month to the General Assembly, where he is widely credited with
having laid out a well-argued case against Hussein, noting how the
Iraqi leader had defied numerous Security Council resolutions since
the 1991 Persian Gulf War and had "attempted to assassinate ... a
former American president"--a reference to Bush's father.</TE>
<TE>   But there was a collective wince here two weeks later when Bush
wrapped the case against Hussein in highly personal terms at a
Republican fund-raiser in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   "This guy really hates us," he told the gathering. "After all,
this is a guy who tried to kill my dad at one time."</TE>
<TE>   The use of such down-home language also rekindled long-simmering
suspicions abroad that a Bush family vendetta is, at least in part,
propelling the world to the brink of war.</TE>
<TE>   "He made a great speech at the United Nations and delivered it
effectively, but his default mode plays very badly abroad," noted
David Malone, a former Canadian ambassador to the U.N. "The
president's gunslinging rhetoric, loose rather than precise ... is
often counterproductive [overseas], however effective it is
domestically."</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, the two recent American presidents most tarred by
domestic scandal are among those most admired by foreigners. Richard
Nixon is judged in Europe as a leader who understood the nature of
realpolitik like few others, while Bill Clinton is regarded as a
brilliant orator and savvy statesman. Last week, Clinton wowed
delegates to the annual convention of Blair's Labor Party with a
speech questioning the need for a preemptive strike against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   President Reagan, though scorned initially in Europe for his
Hollywood roots, was seen as a polished speaker and moved easily in
the circles of power.</TE>
<TE>   "When he didn't have anything to say, he shut up," Malone said.</TE>
<TE>   A number of comments from Bush, exposing gaps in his knowledge of
world affairs, haven't helped his image. He has referred to Greeks as
"Grecians" and Africa as a country, lumped together the Serbs and
Albanians of Yugoslavia's Kosovo region as "Kosovians" and shown
surprise that a large share of the Brazilian population is black.
This year in Tokyo, he described relations with America's World War
II adversary Japan as one of the great enduring alliances, extending
back a century and a half.</TE>
<TE>   Faux pas aside, some say they are genuinely mystified by the
president's choice of words.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't make sense," noted the U.N. official. "If you have a
plan to attack Iraq, why do it in a way that alienates everyone?"</TE>
<TE>   Undeterred, Bush last week once again had the United Nations
itself in his rhetorical sights, using colorful language and a
conservative Republican posture.</TE>
<TE>   "The United Nations must show its backbone," he said after meeting
with congressional leaders at the White House, adding, "We will work
with members of the Security Council to put calcium in the backbone
so this organization is able more likely to keep the peace as we go
down the road."</TE>

special correspondent Wallace from London. Times staff writer Robin
Wright in Washington contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>French Tanker Explodes Off the Coast of Yemen</HD>
<DH>Asia: Local and European experts prepare to investigate
whether the blast near a port was an accident or a terrorist attack.</DH>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>SANA, Yemen</DL>
<LD>The French-flagged supertanker Limburg burned in the Gulf of Aden
early today as Yemeni and French experts prepared to investigate
whether an explosion was an accident or a terrorist attack.</LD>
<LD>   The Yemeni government has ruled out an attack similar to the
October 2000 suicide assault on the U.S. destroyer Cole, saying a
fire aboard the Limburg caused the blast.</LD>
<LD>   But a director of the ship's owner, Euronav, said he believed that
terrorists using a boat could have been responsible for Sunday's
blast as the vessel prepared to dock at Mina Dabah, near Mukalla in
Yemen.</LD>
<TE>   Yemeni firefighters with foreign help were still trying to put out
the raging flames and clean up a massive oil spill fast approaching
Mukalla.</TE>
<TE>   Footage of the tanker Sunday showed the bright blaze of a fire in
the right side almost concealed by thick black smoke.</TE>
<TE>   Oil industry sources said the tanker was carrying 397,000 barrels
of crude oil and had been approaching Mina Dabah to load more oil
when a hole was blown in its side.</TE>
<TE>   All but one of the eight French and 17 Bulgarian crew members were
accounted for, and Yemeni officials said that at least 17 crew
members were in the hospital. Euronav said the missing man was a
Bulgarian.</TE>
<TE>   French President Jacques Chirac announced Sunday that French
investigators would travel to Yemen to join local experts in
examining the tanker. A Yemeni official said the team was expected to
be in the Arab state today.</TE>
<TE>   Euronav, a subsidiary of Belgian shipping group Compagnie Maritime
Belge, or CMB, said the blast occurred while the Limburg was meeting
a pilot vessel to bring it into the port.</TE>
<TE>   "In my opinion, this was a terrorist attack," Euronav director
Jacques Moizan said Sunday. "The crew saw a high-speed vessel
approaching on the starboard side.... An explosion followed with
fire."</TE>
<TE>   Yemeni Transport and Marine Affairs Minister Said Yafai said one
of the ship's tanks exploded, igniting the fire.</TE>
<TE>   A Yemeni official quoted the tanker's captain as saying that a
small fire on board had set off the explosion.</TE>
<TE>   Capt. Peter Raes, a director of the management companies for CMB,
said he doubted the explosion had occurred inside the ship. He said
the Limburg's captain told him a witness had seen a small fishing
boat approach and collide with the tanker.</TE>

<HD>A Debate Erupts Over the Debate</HD>
<DH>Politics: Simon asked the Green Party candidate to be a
guest, but the Davis camp was wary of event becoming 'a circus.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK Z. BARABAK and NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Republican gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon Jr. made a last-ditch
effort to upend today's debate with Gov. Gray Davis, inviting as his
personal guest a Green Party candidate and political polar opposite
whose presence would have signaled an effort to ideologically
double-team the incumbent Democrat.</LD>
<LD>   The invitee, Peter Camejo, had not been included in the debate by
the host Los Angeles Times because he failed to reach a threshold of
viability for third-party candidates. Officials at the paper informed
the Simon campaign that Camejo would not be allowed into the paper's
headquarters, where the two-man debate is scheduled to begin at noon.</LD>
<LD>   Camejo said Sunday that he will come anyway as Simon's guest.</LD>
<TE>   The last-minute tussle, which included a short threat Sunday by
the Davis forces to boycott the debate, underscored the stakes for
both campaigns today. Comfortably ahead in the polls, Davis is
seeking to deal with as few unpredictable events as possible before
the Nov. 5 election. Simon, trailing since a confluence of negative
publicity dominated much of the summer, is trying mightily to shake
up the race.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's effort to leap ahead of Davis has long included the
strange alliance between himself--a conservative Republican-- and the
far more liberal Camejo. The Simon campaign for months has pushed for
Camejo to be included in debates and has sent memos to political
reporters talking up the Green Party candidate's prospects, hoping to
draw attention to weaknesses on Davis' left flank. Expanding that
move onto a debate stage would have been a risky venture, but Simon
appeared to be aiming for a debate in which Camejo came at Davis from
the left and Simon from the right. Such pincer moves against the
front-runner are common in multi-candidate debates.</TE>
<TE>   Martha Goldstein, a spokeswoman for The Times, said that in
extending invitations only to Davis and Simon, the newspaper applied
rules that have recently governed participation in the presidential
debates. Those guidelines require participants to meet a threshold of
at least 15% of the likely vote in public opinion surveys.</TE>
<TE>   "It would seem you want to have a discussion among the two
candidates most likely to win so voters can draw real inferences and
conclusions about where they stand on issues," Goldstein said.</TE>
<TE>   Camejo received 4% of the likely vote in a Los Angeles Times Poll
published last week, little more than four other minor-party
candidates on the ballot. Other polls recorded similar levels of
support. Simon has not pressed for the presence of the other minor
candidates, some of whom would challenge him for conservative voters.</TE>
<TE>   In communications over the last few weeks, Camejo has strenuously
objected to his exclusion, Goldstein said, and it was feared he might
try to force himself on stage or otherwise disrupt the scheduled
60-minute debate if allowed into The Times building.</TE>
<TE>   Camejo said Sunday that he simply wants to observe the debate and
speak to the news media afterward, and he promised not to disrupt the
proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to be available to the media that does want to hear my
point of view, and I do not see why the Los Angeles Times or Davis
has any right to prevent me from being heard," Camejo said, as he
pledged to attend despite the paper's promised lockout.</TE>
<TE>   He brushed off the earlier threats by the Davis campaign that his
presence would lead to cancellation.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not going to leave the room because Gov. Davis tells me to
leave the room," Camejo said, adding that he intends to present his
invitation today. If barred, he said, he would "explore his
options"--such as joining in the Green Party protest outside, or
looking at possible legal action.</TE>
<TE>   Camejo, a onetime Berkeley radical who now runs a progressive
investing business in the Bay Area, said he opposes both Simon and
Davis and does not believe in trying to "spoil" an election. He
argued that winner-take-all voting laws passed by Democrats and
Republicans should be blamed for thrown elections.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Rollins, a strategist for the Simon campaign, said he was
"outraged by the fact the L.A. Times is censoring who we can bring as
our guest." He insisted that Camejo's presence was not a ploy but
rather a result of the friendship developed with Simon after they
participated in a two-way debate last month.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has been leery of giving any publicity to Camejo, whose
left-leaning positions in theory threaten to siphon liberal support
away from the incumbent. "We're not interested in participating in a
circus," Roger Salazar, a spokesman for the Davis camp, said early
Sunday. "If Simon wants to clown around, he can do it elsewhere."</TE>
<TE>   Later, Salazar confirmed that Davis would attend as scheduled. "We
believe the Simon campaign was obviously trying to use [Camejo] as a
prop," he said. "We had a very clear understanding from the Los
Angeles Times that no props would be allowed."</TE>
<TE>   Excluding candidates from high-profile debates is a perennially
touchy matter for sponsoring organizations. In the last presidential
race, Green Party candidate Ralph Nader vehemently protested his
omission from the debates between Republican George W. Bush and
Democrat Al Gore, to no avail. Given the closeness of the
presidential contest, some analysts suggest that Democratic votes
that Nader drew away from Gore cost him the White House.</TE>
<TE>   If current public opinion surveys on the California race are any
indication, however, Camejo is not in a position to have the same
sort of impact this year.</TE>
<TE>   Although many poll respondents have indicated distaste for both
Davis and Simon, Camejo is running well below what would be needed to
affect the election. In addition, polls have shown that it is not
Davis but Simon who has the weakest hold on his party base. Davis ran
stronger among liberals and core Democrats than Simon did among core
Republicans, according to The Times Poll. Davis also ran stronger
than Simon among the independents, the unaligned voters who could be
swayed by a third-party candidacy.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, The Times Poll found Republicans to be more
dissatisfied with their gubernatorial choices than Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever happens with Camejo, Nader could resurface: He was a
last-minute addition to Simon's guest list. Although it was unclear
whether he planned to attend, The Times' Goldstein said his presence
would not be a problem.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not a candidate for governor and hasn't demonstrated any
reason to think he'd disrupt the proceedings," Goldstein said.</TE>
<TE>   The debate will be televised on KTLA-TV Channel 5.</TE>

<HD>3 Rampart Probes Lax, LAPD Says</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: Investigators did incomplete reviews of police
shootings that Perez called unjustified.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATT LAIT and SCOTT GLOVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Police Department detectives did not thoroughly
investigate three shooting cases that corrupt ex-officer Rafael Perez
said were unjustified and covered up, a top police official said last
week.</LD>
<LD>   Assistant Chief David Gascon, responding to inquiries from The
Times, said he was "not satisfied" with the department's efforts to
investigate two shooting cases that left men injured.</LD>
<LD>   He also acknowledged that a third shooting, in which Perez said he
had been told about an officer who tried to cover up an embarrassing
misfire, was never reinvestigated by the department's Rampart
Corruption Task Force.</LD>
<TE>   In all three cases, department investigators did not interview
witnesses or review other material that might have challenged the
official police accounts.</TE>
<TE>   Some officers involved in the cases remain on duty, patrolling the
streets of Los Angeles three years after Perez accused them of lying
and fabricating evidence to justify their actions in shootings.</TE>
<TE>   City leaders said they had been assured repeatedly that the Police
Department was thoroughly investigating all allegations of misconduct
made by Perez about the incidents collectively known as the Rampart
scandal. The LAPD has investigated five other shootings that Perez
said were suspicious and concluded that, in at least two, he helped
the department uncover officer misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just stunned," Mayor James K. Hahn said Friday when he
learned of Gascon's comments. "It doesn't seem like the kind of thing
that can just fall through the cracks. I can't imagine what the
explanation is."</TE>
<TE>   Police Commission President Rick Caruso agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "This blows me away," he said. "There's no excuse for not doing
everything possible to get to the bottom of those allegations."</TE>
<TE>   Referring to Hahn's decision last week to nominate former New York
Police Commissioner William J. Bratton to head the LAPD, Caruso
added: "Herein lies the reason it's healthy to have somebody from the
outside become chief of this department."</TE>
<TE>   Perez, a former anti-gang officer convicted of stealing cocaine
booked as evidence, identified eight allegedly improper shootings
more than three years ago during his debriefings with police and
prosecutors. In return for a reduced sentence on the charges against
him, Perez told investigators about some shootings that he said he
knew about firsthand and others that he had heard about from other
officers.</TE>
<TE>   For months, LAPD officials have told The Times that they were
trying to evaluate the status of the investigations into each of
those eight cases. Last week, in response to repeated requests for
information, Gascon, after consulting with Interim Chief Martin
Pomeroy, acknowledged that the department had not done significant
follow-up in three of the cases.</TE>
<TE>   He said the department now intends to do that review.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope to go back and make sure that the actual investigation is
done to our satisfaction so we know that we have not only the quality
that we need to make a determination, but [also] address any
inconsistencies that may have been raised," Gascon said.</TE>
<TE>   Gascon said the three shootings were deemed "lower priorities"
when detectives were overwhelmed by the sheer volume of Perez's
allegations.</TE>
<TE>   The statutory deadlines for filing criminal charges had either
elapsed or were about to expire on two of the cases when Perez, as
part of his plea deal, spoke to detectives in September 1999.
Nonetheless, Gascon said, the department should have put more effort
into investigating the criminal and administrative implications of
Perez's allegations in those two shootings, both of which were the
subjects of previous articles in The Times.</TE>
<TE>   Officials in the district attorney's office declined to comment.
One former prosecutor, however, said he was not surprised that the
LAPD's shooting investigations were less than thorough.</TE>
<TE>   "The LAPD was extraordinarily recalcitrant. It was very difficult
to get their cooperation in reviewing the shootings," said Richard
Rosenthal, the former deputy district attorney who prosecuted Perez
and worked on the district attorney's corruption task force. "They
decided which shootings they wanted to review, and then gave us very
few supplemental reports showing us what they had done."</TE>
<TE>   Rosenthal, who now works as the civilian monitor of the Portland
Police Department in Oregon, said the alleged cover-ups would have
been very difficult to prosecute.</TE>
<TE>   "But that does not excuse not reinvestigating shootings," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the officers implicated by Perez in improper shootings
remain on the job and on patrol. One of the officers Perez accused of
covering up a shooting was assigned to work on the department's
so-called board of inquiry report critiquing the Rampart scandal at
the same time she supposedly was under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   All but one of the officers involved in the cases identified by
Perez failed to return phone calls, declined to comment for this
story, or have previously declined to discuss their roles in the
incidents. One officer, speaking on condition of anonymity,
corroborated Perez's allegations about one of the shootings.</TE>
<TE>   One of those incidents that Gascon said did not receive sufficient
investigation took place in the waning hours of Dec. 31, 1995.
According to the official police account, officers from the Rampart
Division's anti-gang CRASH unit were attacked while looking for
revelers firing guns into the air to celebrate the new year.</TE>
<TE>   Two men on the balcony of an apartment building on Linwood Avenue
opened fire on Officers Brian Hewitt, John Collard and Daniel Lujan,
police said.</TE>
<TE>   The officers, according to police documents, took cover and
returned fire, wounding the two suspects. They were booked on
suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon on a police officer. Both
men admitted firing their guns in the air, but vehemently denied
shooting at police. In court, they pleaded guilty to the lesser
charge of negligently discharging a firearm and were sentenced to
probation.</TE>
<TE>   That was the end of the case until Perez spoke out, telling
authorities that it was the suspects on the balcony who were
attacked, not the officers.</TE>
<TE>   According to transcripts of his debriefings with investigators,
Perez said the officers watched as the men fired shots into the air.
During a break in their shooting, Perez alleged, the officers, who
had taken cover behind a car and a concrete column, opened fire on
the suspects without warning.</TE>
<TE>   Perez, who said he arrived in the immediate aftermath of the
shooting, said he and the other officers began collecting their shell
casings and were planning to leave without reporting the incident
when they discovered blood and determined that a suspect had been
hit.</TE>
<TE>   The officers then entered the building and arrested the wounded
men, Perez said.</TE>
<TE>   Police officials acknowledge that there are several pieces of
circumstantial evidence that raise serious questions about the
account given by officers the night of the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   For one, despite the officers' claim that they came under heavy
fire from at least two suspects, the LAPD's officer-involved shooting
report makes no mention of any bullets or damage in the area where
the officers were.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, if the officers had been attacked by suspects who
then holed up in the building, LAPD protocols would have suggested
that officers then call for a SWAT team to take over. No such call
was placed.</TE>
<TE>   Two officers involved in that incident, Hewitt and Collard, have
since been fired from the LAPD for misconduct unrelated to the
shooting. Lujan was found guilty of misconduct at an internal LAPD
proceeding earlier this year in another case brought to light by
Perez, but the officer's only punishment was an official reprimand
because the proceeding was not completed within the one-year statute
of limitations, according to department sources.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, one officer who was at the scene that evening told
The Times in an interview that Perez was telling the truth and that
officers were not provoked when they opened fire on the suspects.</TE>
<TE>   After Perez's statements to authorities, however, police never
interviewed that officer.</TE>
<TE>   The second shooting that has raised new questions occurred Oct.
15, 1995. In that incident, rookie Officer Daniel Widman and his
partner were dispatched to a domestic violence call in the 1700 block
of South Catalina Street.</TE>
<TE>   As Widman searched the apartment for a man who had allegedly hit
his wife, he saw what he thought was a large amount of blood smeared
on the walls, police documents state.</TE>
<TE>   "That is when the hair on the back of my neck stood up, and I was
thinking that this was serious," the officer would later tell
investigators.</TE>
<TE>   He drew his gun. Seconds later, the suspect opened the bedroom
door, emerging with a shiny object near his waist, according to
police. At the same moment, the officer said he heard a loud boom and
saw a flash of light, which he believed to be a muzzle flash.</TE>
<TE>   Officer Widman, concluding that he had been shot, fired at the
suspect. The bullet hit him in the abdomen.</TE>
<TE>   But when police searched for the weapon Widman believed the
suspect was holding, they found only a hand mirror.</TE>
<TE>   The scenario that Widman, other officers at the scene, and
ultimately shooting investigators pieced together was that the "boom"
Widman heard was the sound of the bedroom door being flung open by
the suspect and striking a dresser; the shiny object the officer saw,
they concluded, was the hand mirror; and the flash was light from
Widman's flashlight bouncing off the mirror.</TE>
<TE>   The "blood" turned out to be ketchup.</TE>
<TE>   In a tape-recorded interview shortly after the incident, a
shooting team investigator seemed skeptical of the account given by
Widman, repeatedly asking the officer if he was sure the shooting had
not been an accident.</TE>
<TE>   When Widman insisted that it had not, the detective pressed on.</TE>
<TE>   "OK, Dan. We are going to go over this again," the detective said.
"Wait till two or three years down the line and you get in front of
the judge and the jury ... and you are going to have to explain to
them why you shot this guy."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the case never made it to a jury. The city paid the
victim, Jose Vega, $425,000 to settle a lawsuit he filed as a result
of the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   When Perez told investigators about the shooting in 1999, he said
he wasn't there and didn't even recall the name of the officer
involved, just the circumstances, which he said were an open secret
in the Rampart Division.</TE>
<TE>   "They wanted to save the kid's career," Perez said. They asked
him, 'What do you got?' And he goes, 'I don't know. I just shot him.'
And they were like, 'Oh, Jesus.' "</TE>
<TE>   Perez said he was told during a CRASH meeting that sergeants who
responded to the scene that night helped concoct a story to justify
Widman's alleged mistake.</TE>
<TE>   "They came up with some idea of a little mirror," Perez told
investigators. "They made it very clear to us that that was just what
they did to save [Widman's], you know, his job ... covered it up.
Fixed it."</TE>
<TE>   LAPD officials now concede that the department has not taken
adequate steps to determine whether Perez's account was true. Gascon
declined to comment on specifics of the department's work.</TE>
<TE>   Widman and his partner continue to work at the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   The third shooting that Gascon said last week has yet to receive
attention by the department involves a May 14, 1998, incident in
which an officer allegedly fired his gun by accident.</TE>
<TE>   According to the official police report on the incident, Officer
Sonny Garcia chased down a drug dealer whom he thought might have
been armed. As Garcia tried to arrest the suspect, the man struck a
hard blow to Garcia's hand, which was holding his service weapon.
Garcia said he lost control of his gun for a moment and then fired it
by accident.</TE>
<TE>   Perez said he heard about the alleged cover-up of that shooting
from other officers, but did not witness it.</TE>
<TE>   According to Perez, officers discussing the incident said Garcia
had accidentally fired his gun during the chase, not because of a
physical altercation.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just simply a mistake. But he didn't know how to explain
it," Perez told investigators. "Instead of saying, hey, I was running
and my gun accidentally went off, things are made up and--and added
to the story to make it sound like, 'OK, I can--we can understand how
that happened.' "</TE>
<TE>   One LAPD official said the case might have been assigned a lower
priority partly because the alleged cover story the officer told
would not have subjected him to any less criticism than the version
he gave.</TE>
<TE>   "It just didn't make sense," said the high-ranking LAPD source.
"For that reason, I don't think it was a top priority."</TE>
<TE>   Caruso, the Police Commission president, said he has been asking
department officials to produce a long-promised report that is
supposed to account for the LAPD's investigation of all allegations
arising from the Rampart scandal. That report is more than two years
overdue.</TE>
<TE>   "If this is how they treated cases with such a high profile, how
did they treat cases that didn't get so much attention?" Caruso said.
"That's what scares me."</TE>

<DH>An LAPD unit formed to catch pickpockets on commuter trains
and buses finds it's busier protecting female riders from perverts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAITLIN LIU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Why, Tom Brown asked himself, is that creepy guy standing on the bus
when there are empty places to sit, and why is he rocking his lower
body back and forth into the shoulder of that seated teenage girl?</LD>
<LD>   In his backward baseball cap, baggy T-shirt and Bermuda shorts,
Brown might be mistaken for a low-budget tourist. But packed under
his beach-casual garb is a gun, and in his pocket his Los Angeles
Police Department badge--which Brown flashed at the sullen man, a
35-year-old cook, before hauling him away in handcuffs and booking
him on suspicion of lewd acts on a minor.</LD>
<LD>   In crowded mass-transit systems, female riders have long suffered
the torment of getting pinched, fondled or rubbed against by sleazy
men. For the last three years, a tiny unit within the 350-officer
Metropolitan Transportation Authority police force has been trying to
put a stop to it.</LD>
<TE>   Brown and five colleagues were originally dispatched to catch
pickpockets. But the undercover officers soon noticed behavior
similar to that of pickpockets in a different breed of criminals.
These characters--virtually all men, except for the occasional
teenage boy--also stared at other riders, then aggressively moved in
to make bodily contact. Like pickpockets, they focused at the level
where wallets are typically tucked or purses worn--the waist and
below. It helped them that female passengers, while visibly agitated,
often did nothing to stop them.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the Pickpocket Detail, as it's still called, is making
four sex-offender busts for every pickpocket arrest. In its history,
it has made 140 arrests for sexual offenses-- 62 so far this year, 44
last year and 21 the year before that.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles is not alone in being concerned about transit
perverts. Seoul subways have broadcast warnings against seamy
behavior. Train operators in Tokyo, where riders are often crammed
together so tightly that they can hardly breathe, have set aside cars
for female riders to create a groper-free zone.</TE>
<TE>   In New York City, the subway's 3,000 patrol officers made more
than 400 sex-crime arrests last year, 285 of them involving incidents
of public lewdness. There are no special crackdowns in New York on
transit perverts per se, but the conduct is discouraged through a
"strong uniformed presence" on station platforms, said Deputy Chief
Ronald Rowland of the Police Department's transit bureau.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Special Assignment</TE>
<TE>   Transit law enforcement experts believe Los Angeles is unique in
assigning undercover officers to hunt actively for gropers on buses
and trains.</TE>
<TE>   Other agencies might have officers "trolling for illicit behavior
in all manners ... but nothing aimed directly" at sexual predators,
said Kurt R. Nelson, author of the 1999 book, "Policing Mass
Transit."</TE>
<TE>   The suspects whom Los Angeles officers have cuffed range in age
from 17 to 82, and include day laborers, businessmen, a chemical
engineer, a teacher's aide, a gynecologist and a pastor. An estimated
80% are married with children.</TE>
<TE>   The offenders' behavior seems compulsive. Officers have busted the
West Los Angeles gynecologist twice and the North Hollywood pastor
three times. Going up and down a bus aisle, left and right, an
offender might leave several victims in his wake in a single ride.</TE>
<TE>   There is a clinical explanation for what such men do. Frotteurism
or frottage is a sexual deviance defined as a recurrent urge to
engage in "touching and rubbing against a nonconsenting person" for
sexual arousal and gratification, according to the American
Psychiatric Assn.'s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders.</TE>
<TE>   All the known cases of people with this disorder are male. Los
Angeles transit police note that every victim they know, except for a
long-haired boy who was mistaken for a girl, is female.</TE>
<TE>   Habitats for such men tend to be crowded public places, such as
buses, subways, elevators and spectator-heavy events. Frotteurism "is
a very impulsive behavior, frequently not planned ... and it has an
aggressive component to it," said Martin Kafka, a psychiatrist and a
clinical assistant professor at Harvard Medical School.</TE>
<TE>   Others say the behavior can be driven by a desire for power and
control.</TE>
<TE>   "In some cases it has to do with anger," said Charlene Steen, a
Napa psychologist who has written three books on sex offenders. "In a
lot of cases it has to do with people who don't know how to make
appropriate contact with females."</TE>
<TE>   Treatment options include cognitive behavioral therapy,
antidepressants and drugs that reduce sex drives. Unless there is
intervention, experts say, men with this condition are likely to prey
on women again and again.</TE>
<TE>   That's why officers believe that keeping track of suspicious
characters can pay off.</TE>
<TE>   Take the case of the guy officers dubbed "Clark Kent." A few
months ago, an officer saw the man, wearing thick black-framed
glasses, grope a woman on a bus. But the Spanish-speaking victim
refused to cooperate with authorities--who needed her statements to
press charges--so an arrest couldn't be made.</TE>
<TE>   Officers soon began having "Clark Kent" sightings. They watched
him park his car at a supermarket parking lot just so he could take
buses up and down the same street. A couple of months after the
fondling incident, an officer came upon "Clark Kent" rubbing up
against a female passenger, and he was finally arrested.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Disguising Intent</TE>
<TE>   Sexual predators like to prowl buses in search of victims because
the swaying motions of the vehicles help mask what they are trying to
do, officers say.</TE>
<TE>   The perpetrators seem especially emboldened during rush hour, when
riders are elbowing and jostling each other for room to stand.
Officers say they realize some contact can be incidental, and say
they take pains to arrest only men whose conduct is obviously
sexually motivated.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the men arrested by the undercover agents wind up being
charged with misdemeanor sexual battery, if the victim is an adult,
or felony lewd conduct, if the victim is younger than 18.</TE>
<TE>   The defendants usually end up pleading out, with sentences ranging
from probation for first-time offenders, who are usually sent to a
treatment program, to prison for repeat offenders or felons.</TE>
<TE>   Police and transit experts believe that sex crimes like these are
vastly underreported.</TE>
<TE>   Victims are often too intimidated to stop the offenders, and later
too embarrassed or unsure about what happened to tell authorities
about it. The molester may never get caught unless an officer is
watching and can intervene immediately.</TE>
<TE>   "Undercover work has a very important place in policing work of
this nature," said Greg Hull, director of operations, safety and
security programs for Washington, D.C.-based American Public
Transportation Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Research shows that many, though not all, of those obsessed by
lecherous touching also engage in other deviant sexual behavior, such
as exhibitionism, voyeurism or pedophilia. When booking suspects,
officers often find a history of criminal activity such as rape,
child molestation or peeping. Outstanding arrest warrants sometimes
turn up for such offenses as felony lewd acts.</TE>
<TE>   "The 'bumper and grinder' ... that's a person who we can have an
'Amber alert' on three years from now," said Paul Lennon, the MTA's
chief of security and law enforcement, referring to the system that
has been used repeatedly in recent weeks, interrupting broadcasts and
using digital freeway signs to post urgent messages about child
abductions. "Take them off the street before they escalate."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sending a Message</TE>
<TE>   Female bus riders say police crackdowns are necessary to allay
their fears and to send a message that such behavior is not
acceptable.</TE>
<TE>   "If they can do it to me, they can do it to others," said Briselda
Guerrero, 30. The Los Angeles nanny first met undercover officers in
June 2001, when they caught a man victimizing her during a bus ride.
Recently, officers intervened again as she used her arm to block
another predator.</TE>
<TE>   A female passenger on a different bus, 15-year-old Alejandra
Trejo, said she frequently encounters such prurient men but never
reported them because she didn't think it would do any good.</TE>
<TE>   That changed on a recent bus ride she and her mother took through
Koreatown.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles girl felt someone repeatedly press against her,
she said.</TE>
<TE>   It was, police said, the 35-year-old cook whom Officer Brown had
been watching. Another officer immediately approached the girl and
asked her what had happened.</TE>
<TE>   Brown said he had become suspicious when he saw the suspect hover
over Trejo and remain, even after seats around him opened up. The man
allegedly continued pressing into the girl's shoulder through three
bus stops.  "It's repulsive and disgusting," Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   The cook eventually entered into a plea bargain that resulted in a
sentence of nine days in jail and 18 months' probation.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of guys like that. Some of them do worse things
on buses," Trejo said.</TE>
<TE>   Her mother, Josefina Romero, who was sitting in a different seat
on the crowded bus and hadn't seen what happened, was elated at the
arrest.</TE>
<TE>   "It's great," Romero said, beaming at the officers. "They are
protecting my daughter."</TE>

<LD>   In a show of support to states' rights activists, a California man
returned three bulls to two Western Shoshone sisters after buying
them at a government auction of the sisters' confiscated cattle.
Boone Tidwell returned the bulls to Carrie and Mary Dann in Fallon,
60 miles east of Reno. He paid $1,200 for them at the Bureau of Land
Management auction Friday. Two other out-of-state bidders paid
$58,062 for 229 other cattle formerly owned by the sisters, who owe
nearly $3 million in grazing fees. The cattle were confiscated by the
BLM last month from the Danns, who insist the land belongs to the
Western Shoshones.</LD>

<LD>   With Mission Control back in operation, NASA aimed for a launch
today of the shuttle Atlantis, but a new problem threatened to
further delay the flight. A heater in a water-dump line was running
too hot aboard Atlantis, and engineers scrambled to gauge the effect
on the 11-day mission.</LD>
<TE>   The space station assembly mission already has been delayed nearly
seven weeks, first by cracked fuel lines that grounded the entire
shuttle fleet and then by Hurricane Lili, which forced an
unprecedented shutdown last week of Mission Control at the Johnson
Space Center in Houston. If the problem controller setting has to be
replaced, officials said, Atlantis would face a delay of several
days.</TE>

<LD>   The American Academy of Pediatrics says the nation's smallpox plan
should involve limited vaccinations if a case occurs, not universal
inoculations before there's even an attack. Potential side effects
are too severe, and available vaccines have not been tested on
children, who may be at higher risk for bad reactions, the academy
said in a policy statement released today.</LD>
<TE>   Based on studies from the 1960s, 15 out of every million people
vaccinated will face life-threatening reactions, and one to two will
die.</TE>
<TE>   The academy's policy is more conservative than one being finalized
by the Bush administration, which plans to offer the vaccine to all
280 million Americans.</TE>

his most important but least visible advisors: his father.</LD>
<LD>   For although the White House refuses to confirm it, friends and
associates of both men say former President Bush frequently has
weighed in with his son on international issues. In early 2001, the
elder Bush counseled his son to ease his initial hard line toward
North Korea; the younger Bush took his advice. Later that year, the
elder Bush assured the ruler of Saudi Arabia that the president would
take a more active role in Arab-Israeli peacemaking; the younger Bush
soon did.</LD>
<LD>   And this summer, the elder Bush played an important but unseen
role in his son's decision to seek the approval of the U.N. Security
Council before taking any military action against Iraq, according to
an associate of the former president.</LD>
<TE>   Before the president's stay with his parents in Kennebunkport in
early August, he appeared headed toward a confrontation with Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein without a serious attempt to send U.N. arms
inspectors back to Baghdad. Hard-liners in the administration, led by
Vice President Dick Cheney, argued that another round of inspections
merely would give Hussein more time to build weapons of mass
destruction.</TE>
<TE>   But after four days at Walker's Point, his family's imposing home
atop a rocky bluff, the president told aides he had decided to go to
the U.N. first. "The change in the president's attitude took place
not as a result of the debate [that Republicans waged in public that
month], but after he spent time in Kennebunkport," the Bush associate
said. "There were conversations and very in-depth conversations....
It was interaction between the president and his father" that changed
the policy.</TE>
<TE>   White House officials refused to comment concerning that account.
So did spokesmen for the former president, who has worked hard to
remain invisible in the workings of the current administration.</TE>
<TE>   But the two George Bushes did spend considerable time together
during the August vacation--on the golf course, aboard the elder
Bush's 31-foot speedboat Fidelity II and around the dinner table. In
the weeks after those Kennebunkport activities, three former aides to
the elder Bush opened up a barrage of public comment supporting a
slower, more diplomatic course on Iraq--instead of the quick march
toward war that Cheney seemed to favor.</TE>
<TE>   Former national security advisor Brent Scowcroft and former
Secretaries of State James A. Baker III and Lawrence S. Eagleburger
all urged the president to win the support of traditional U.S. allies
before plunging ahead. Scowcroft and Eagleburger said the elder Bush
did not ask them to make their statements, and said they did not know
that the president apparently had decided to follow much of their
advice already. Baker refused to comment.</TE>
<TE>   But the three former aides' statements had the effect of
bolstering the president's decision at a time when Cheney and other
hard-line conservatives were warning him that the U.N. was a trap.
"The president's instincts are fine ... but the most important person
in this [debate] is Cheney. He keeps digging at this wound,"
Eagleburger told reporters last week. He said he did not know what
advice the former president had given his son.</TE>
<TE>   Other officials and former officials have said that the Bushes
speak frequently, and that the president has his father's telephone
number on a speed dial button on the Oval Office phone. "Forty-three
feels comfortable calling him, and he feels comfortable calling 43,"
said a former aide to the elder Bush, using the family's shorthand
for the current president.</TE>
<TE>   He said the 41st president often calls the 43rd "right after he's
spoken to a world leader" to offer a report. In recent months, the
former president has met with Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah, British
Prime Minister Tony Blair and King Mohammed VI of Morocco, the former
aide said.</TE>
<TE>   Other former presidents also have reported to the White House
concerning their meetings with foreign leaders, he noted. Much of
this has nothing to do with the younger Bush; it has to do with the
nature of the job. "But [the elder] Bush is in a different position.
He's a foreign policy wonk. His role is heightened because his son is
the president. He wants to make sure that whatever he does does not
interfere with what 43 is doing," the former aide said. "He wants the
administration to know what he's doing."</TE>
<TE>   The relationship between the Presidents Bush, according to
associates of both men, is a mixture of love, pride, fierce loyalty,
deep-seated political allegiance--and an occasional flash of friendly
rivalry.</TE>
<TE>   "There is that factor in their relationship. It's not an easy
one," a former aide to the elder Bush said. "They have their
competitive ways as well as their pride in each other." The elder
Bush has gone out of his way to avoid being seen as meddling ever
since the 2000 New Hampshire primary campaign, when he stepped in to
defend "this boy"-- a paternal phrase that backfired.</TE>
<TE>   A photograph of the two men that speaks volumes about their
relationship hangs on a wall in the White House's West Wing. Taken
several hours after George W. Bush's inauguration in 2001, it shows
the new president seated at his still-empty desk in a bare Oval
Office, while his grinning father stands nearby, unable to conceal
his pleasure at seeing his son in his old seat.</TE>
<TE>   But differences between the two Bushes have surfaced repeatedly
concerning issues of foreign policy. The older Bush--who served as an
ambassador and as director of the Central Intelligence Agency before
he became president--carefully cultivated traditional diplomatic
relationships when he was in the White House. The younger Bush, a
former Texas governor who spent little time on foreign policy until
he ran for president in 2000, often has said he is impatient with
traditional forms of diplomatic "nuance." Friends and allies of the
elder Bush were infuriated this summer when members of the current
administration--even, at one point, the president himself--appeared
to criticize the former president's decision in 1991 to call a
cease-fire in the Persian Gulf War without overthrowing Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   "The implication seems to be that our decision in '91 [to stop
short of Baghdad] was some kind of oversight," complained a former
aide to the former president. "It wasn't. It was carefully thought
out at the time. There were good reasons for it." The elder Bush
remained silent concerning the issue, but former aides noted that he
staunchly defended his decision in the years before his son was in
the White House.</TE>
<TE>   In at least two earlier cases, the elder Bush quietly nudged his
son's policies in a more moderate diplomatic direction. In spring
2001, the former president sent a note to his son's national security
advisor, Condoleezza Rice, and to Secretary of State Colin L. Powell,
forwarding a proposal that the new administration support South
Korea's attempts to negotiate with the mercurial Communist regime of
North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, the administration was in the middle of a review of
its policy toward the two Koreas. In one of his first forays into
foreign policy, the new president abruptly had ruled out resuming
talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, creating a major
embarrassment for Powell, who had said the talks would resume. When
the policy review was completed in June, it recommended that the
talks resume--a complete reversal of the earlier policy.</TE>
<TE>   Later in 2001, the former president telephoned the ruler of Saudi
Arabia to assure him that his son valued the U.S.-Saudi relationship
and would urge Israel to exercise restraint in its dealings with the
Palestinians. At the time, U.S.-Saudi relations appeared to have
tumbled into a crisis because Abdullah had concluded that the new
president was insensitive to Arab concerns. After Arab officials
disclosed the telephone call, the White House acknowledged that it
had occurred.</TE>
<TE>   Before the elder Bush's call, Abdullah bluntly had refused an
invitation to visit the White House--a deliberate snub of the new
president. After the call, he agreed to reconsider, and in April he
visited the younger Bush at the president's ranch near Crawford,
Texas.</TE>

<HD>He's Fit, 'Happy' and a Hit in N.J.</HD>
<DH>Senate: As Lautenberg is out drumming up votes, his GOP
opponent is left in the costly position of having to refocus his
campaign in the homestretch.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS S. MULLIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNION CITY, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Frank R. Lautenberg, at 78 the Democrats' brand-new Senate candidate
from New Jersey, tackled the age question head-on Sunday,
salsa-dancing his way through the annual Hispanic State Parade in
heavily Latino--and heavily Democratic--Union City.</LD>
<LD>   In taking over the candidacy from incumbent Sen. Robert Torricelli
last week, Lautenberg already had removed Republican challenger
Douglas R. Forrester's most potent issue: Torricelli's ethics.</LD>
<LD>   Forrester, 49, has responded to the late-inning switch by trying
to paint his new opponent as an old-fashioned tax-and-spend liberal.
Refocusing will be expensive for Forrester, who already had produced
broadcast commercials and campaign literature hammering away at
Torricelli's character.</LD>
<TE>   Torricelli bowed out of the race when it became clear that
Forrester was starting to pull away by attacking the Democrat for,
among other things, accepting expensive gifts from a commodities
trader now in jail for campaign-finance violations dating to
Torricelli's 1996 Senate race. In quitting the campaign, Torricelli
said he didn't want to be responsible for losing the Senate--which
the Democrats now control by a one-vote margin.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for Forrester and the Republicans are pursuing a legal
effort to keep Lautenberg's name off the ballot. They lost the first
round last week, when the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled unanimously
that the Democrats' candidate switch was legal. The GOP is now asking
the U.S. Supreme Court to review the matter, contending the late
change is unfair.</TE>
<TE>   "Why is it unfair when he's the one who wanted Torricelli out of
the race?" asked Lloyd Nixon, a resident of neighboring West New
York, N.J., who was watching Sunday's parade. "I know why Forrester's
mad. How can you jump from a 14-point lead to minus 4 in one day?
It's like driving a race car and you ran out of gas."</TE>
<TE>   Nixon was referring to new polls showing that Lautenberg--who had
served 18 years in the Senate before retiring in 2000--had
instantaneously reversed the double-digit lead that Forrester had
built up against Torricelli.</TE>
<TE>   The main reason Lautenberg decided not to run for a fourth term
was that he hated fund-raising, he said back when he made his
retirement announcement in early 1999. Despite a huge personal
fortune amassed as founder of the computer firm ADP, Lautenberg had
said, campaigning inside the New York media orbit was so expensive
that he would have to spend half of every day for 18 months on
fund-raising.</TE>
<TE>   Lautenberg's loathing for passing the hat underlines the contrasts
between him and Torricelli--a dynamo who had quarterbacked the
Democrats' overall fund-raising efforts in both the House and the
Senate before his personal campaign-finance problems ended his
career.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the well-known personal antipathy between Lautenberg and
Torricelli is making it hard for the Republicans to lump them
together in negative ads.</TE>
<TE>   "The Lautenberg-Torricelli ticket, they're calling it, but these
are two guys who never liked each other, and they're on the record
that way for years," said Joel Benenson, a New York-based pollster
and political consultant who worked for the Torricelli campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Forrester's toughest problem now is name recognition--both his and
Lautenberg's, Benenson said.</TE>
<TE>   "New Jersey voters know Lautenberg. They've pulled the lever for
him three times," Benenson said. "But almost two-thirds of voters
just seven days ago said they didn't know enough about" Forrester, he
added, citing his firm's polling for Torricelli.</TE>
<TE>   If familiarity will be a big advantage for Lautenberg, the
difficulties of throwing a campaign together on the fly will be a
problem. The Democrats have had to scrap bales of signs and handouts
for Torricelli and scramble for material with Lautenberg's name.</TE>
<TE>   As late as Friday, press secretary Juliet Johnson's office phone
answered: "Torricelli headquarters," while her cell phone had been
updated to: "Lautenberg for Senate."</TE>
<TE>   The candidate himself dismissed such problems as trivial.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't serve 18 years in the Senate not knowing what I was
getting into," Lautenberg said Sunday during a pause in the parade.
He called on Forrester, who did not attend the parade, to drop his
legal challenge and debate the issues.</TE>
<TE>   Lautenberg marched two miles in shirt-sleeves and with his tie
tugged loose at his neck, crisscrossing the street to greet onlookers
in Spanish that was rusty but warmly received.</TE>
<TE>   "Arriba los Hispanos!" Lautenberg said repeatedly. "Viva Colombia!
Viva Cuba!" he said, nodding to two of the city's most populous
ethnic groups.</TE>
<TE>   Jenny Munoz gave the candidate a kiss during one of his detours to
the side of the street.</TE>
<TE>   "I love him because he's happy all the time, like me," she said in
Spanish. She added in English that she had been born in Bremerhaven,
Germany, and come to the U.S. in 1962 by way of Cuba, where she met
her late husband.</TE>
<TE>   "I worked for Democrats ever since I could vote," Munoz said.</TE>

<HD>Impending Clash With Iraq Begets a Clash of Administrations</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald Brownstein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Al Gore turned heads the other day with his campaign-style
denunciation of President Bush's strategy toward Iraq. But Gore was
only part of a larger trend that's attracted much less notice.</LD>
<LD>   In speeches and congressional testimony, almost all of the Clinton
administration's leading architects of national security and foreign
policy have come out against Bush's approach to Iraq. The clash of
nations is generating a clash of administrations.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the Clintonites, especially former President Clinton
himself, have framed their disagreements less belligerently than
Gore. But all have reached the same bottom line, arguing that Bush is
moving too quickly toward war.</LD>
<TE>   While all say they eventually could support an invasion to destroy
Iraq's suspected weapons of mass destruction, the Clintonites insist
that war, if it comes at all, should come only after another attempt
at disarming Iraq through U.N. inspections. Only then, they maintain,
can the United States mobilize broad international support for an
invasion--and reduce the risk of what Clinton last week called the
"unwelcome consequences" of an attack.</TE>
<TE>   In raising these arguments, the Clinton administration alumni
never have seemed so much like a government in exile. Though insiders
say they aren't coordinating these remarks, in the last few weeks
virtually identical objections to Bush's course have come from
Clinton, Gore, former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, former
national security advisor Samuel R. "Sandy" Berger, retired Gen. John
M. Shalikashvili (Clinton's choice as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff) and retired Army Gen. Wesley K. Clark, who directed the NATO
war in Kosovo. They probably didn't agree this much when they were in
office.</TE>
<TE>   Intriguingly, the Clintonites' dissents are dividing them not only
from the Bush team but also from the Democrats closest to them during
their tenure: the congressional "New Democrats" associated with the
centrist Democratic Leadership Council.</TE>
<TE>   When Bush last week unveiled the compromise congressional
resolution that would authorize him to use force almost immediately
against Iraq, he was flanked by Sens. Evan Bayh (D-Ind.) and Joseph
I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), the current and prior chairmen of the DLC.
Almost all of the congressional New Democrats--including New York
Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton--are likely to vote for the resolution.</TE>
<TE>   The Clinton alumni haven't specifically opposed the resolution.
But their arguments challenge its underlying grant of power to Bush
to invade Iraq virtually as soon as he wants.</TE>
<TE>   At the core of the conflict between the Bush and Clinton teams is
a very different conception of how America can best pursue its aims
in the world.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration generally believes that if the United
States demonstrates enough resolve, the rest of the world will follow
our lead; the Clintonites are much more concerned about maintaining
international legitimacy and support for American actions.</TE>
<TE>   That's not only because they believe it will be easier to both
invade and rebuild Iraq if other countries are on board; they also
maintain that as the world's dominant power, the United States
benefits from strong international institutions that establish
expected rules of behavior. As Shalikashvili put it: "Every time we
undermine the credibility of the United Nations, we are probably
hurting ourselves more than anybody else." No Bushie outside the
State Department would ever say that.</TE>
<TE>   To maximize international unity against Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein, the Clintonites want to launch a new round of tougher,
unfettered arms inspections and invade Iraq only if those inspections
fail. The Clintonites see that approach as a win-win: either Hussein
disarms or he resists, providing the evidence that will rally a broad
international coalition to depose him.</TE>
<TE>   If the United States acts sooner, and virtually alone, the
Clintonites see a long list of potential dangers. They worry that
other nations would cooperate less in the war against terror if we
invade Iraq over their objections. They fear that Hussein would be
more likely to use chemical and biological weapons, or funnel them to
terrorists, if he believes he's doomed anyway. They're concerned that
a war without broad international support could destabilize friendly
governments in the region (like Pakistan and Jordan)--or create a
radicalized post-Hussein Iraq that becomes a source of anti-American
recruits for Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Above all, Clinton, Gore, Albright, Berger, Shalikashvili and
Clark all have argued that Bush's doctrine of preemptive attack may
establish a precedent that haunts America. While Clinton has said
that any president would act against an imminent security risk, he's
suggested that attacking Iraq now would give license for other
nations to invade antagonists they consider potential threats. Think
India and Pakistan, or China and Taiwan.</TE>
<TE>   It's not too surprising that the Clinton and Bush teams would
divide so sharply. In effect, the Clintonites are arguing for a
bulked-up version of their containment policy toward Iraq, which the
Bushies always considered inadequate. And if the Clintonites think
Bush is moving too quickly toward war, the Bushies feel Clinton was
too slow to use force as the threat from Al Qaeda or Iraq
metastasized.</TE>
<TE>   More revealing is the split between the Clintonites and the New
Democrats in Congress. Part of the difference is politics: Opposing
Bush is easier for former administration officials who aren't running
for anything this year. But something more substantive is at work
too.</TE>
<TE>   The former Clinton officials base their arguments on the belief
that Iraq doesn't pose an unacceptable threat in the near-term.
Intellectually, most elected Democrats probably agree. But as
officeholders still accountable to voters, they are less willing to
take the risk that they are wrong. "Sure, there are risks to
preemption," says Bayh. "But after Sept. 11, we've learned there are
real risks to not acting." In other words, if in doubt, take him out.</TE>
<TE>   That conclusion will swell the vote for Bush's resolution, even
among Democrats who agree with almost everything Clinton and his
colleagues have said. While the Clintonites have persuasively
cataloged the dangers of acting too quickly in Iraq, it's the dangers
of inaction that are likely to carry the most weight as Congress
moves toward authorizing a second Persian Gulf War.</TE>

<DL>ROCKVILLE, Md.</DL>
<LD>One of the six people killed in a suburban Washington shooting spree
was buried Sunday as investigators completed a profile that focuses
on where the killer might live.</LD>
<LD>   Police also were awaiting an FBI psychological profile of the
shooter, Montgomery County Police Chief Charles A. Moose said. Police
have begun to use a geographic profile submitted by investigators
that uses crime locations to determine where the killer feels
comfortable traveling and may live.</LD>
<LD>   "To us, the motivation of the offender is not relevant. We're
looking at the geography," said Kim Rossmo, a police researcher who
compiled the profile.</LD>
<TE>   Moose would not offer specifics about what the geographic profile
revealed. Investigators were making progress, he said, but "some of
the more desirable smoking-gun leads just aren't there."</TE>
<TE>   Family and friends gathered Sunday to bury Premkumar Walekar, a
54-year-old taxi driver killed Thursday at an Aspen Hill gas station.</TE>

<HD>Riordan Might Look Out for Dickens' Ghosts</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Richard Riordan ran for governor as Mr. Fiscal Responsibility, but,
nearly seven months after his loss, some of his campaign's unpaid
creditors are calling him Scrooge.</LD>
<LD>   After spending more than $9 million and losing the Republican
primary in March, Riordan reported in July that his campaign had
unpaid debts of $305,000.</LD>
<LD>   Many of those owed money are flabbergasted that they cannot get
paid by Riordan, a venture capitalist and multimillionaire.</LD>
<TE>   "They offered me 50 cents on the dollar, which is ludicrous, given
the man's net worth," said Walter Lukens, president of Lukens Cook
Co., a Virginia firm owed $11,000 by Riordan's campaign for direct
mail services.</TE>
<TE>   Lukens has hired an attorney who has been talking to an attorney
for the Riordan campaign about getting the bill paid.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate to see someone with a fiscally responsible public point of
view stiff people who worked so hard on his campaign," Lukens added.</TE>
<TE>   David Gould, Riordan's campaign treasurer, said many creditors
have accepted settlements in which Riordan is paying 50 cents on the
dollar out of his own pocket.</TE>
<TE>   "On a legal basis, he does not have a legal obligation to pay for
the debt of a committee," Gould said. "Usually in campaigns, if the
money isn't there, people get stiffed."</TE>
<TE>   Gould, who was unsure how much the debt has been reduced, blamed
the red ink on the failure of some Riordan supporters to come through
on their commitments to help fund the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Randy Spradlin, president of a Virginia direct-mail firm, said
he's owed $39,000. He submitted his bill to the Riordan campaign in
February and has followed it up with several calls, he said, but to
no avail.</TE>
<TE>   "They have not paid me a penny," Spradlin said. "When we took the
job in the first place, they were quick to point out that Riordan was
wealthy, so we should not worry about getting paid."</TE>
<TE>   Simon Engineering New Jabs at Davis</TE>
<TE>   Not all the jabs Republican gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon Jr.
takes at incumbent Gray Davis are in his television commercials.</TE>
<TE>   At Simon campaign headquarters in Sacramento, the staff has put up
a display in the front entrance that plays off the recent railroad
industry fund-raiser that Davis canceled to avoid the appearance of
impropriety after he signed a railroad bill.</TE>
<TE>   It's a battery-powered toy train with paper money and plastic
coins taped all over it. The train goes round and round a circular
blue plastic track on the floor. In the middle is a hand-written
sign: "Davis Money Train."</TE>
<TE>   Not that Simon has escaped critical attacks, even in places that
used to be safe for him.</TE>
<TE>   Conservative radio talk shows have served as a kind of refuge for
Simon, allowing him to convey his message without the distraction of
Democratic attacks. But as the election looms closer, even
conservative radio cannot guarantee Simon safe harbor.</TE>
<TE>   That was evident last week when he appeared on the "Mark &amp; Marino"
show on KRLA-AM (870) in Los Angeles. Midway through the show an
unfriendly caller slipped through.</TE>
<TE>   He identified himself as Mike from Sherman Oaks, then started
taking Simon to task for fines against his family's municipal bond
firm in New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not idiots," Mike told Simon. "We know you're not governor
material. Run for council."</TE>
<TE>   The host, Mark Larson responded: "I think he's getting his talking
points from Garry South," a reference to Davis' chief strategist.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Takes Questionable Credit</TE>
<TE>   The mailer arriving at households in Assemblyman Tom Harman's
Huntington Beach-based district crowed, "Your Nest Egg Just Got
Bigger!"</TE>
<TE>   It outlined changes to bring state law into conformity with
federal Roth IRA limits, allowing tax breaks for larger annual
contributions. Except Harman didn't vote for the IRA bill.</TE>
<TE>   And most people's retirement accounts didn't grow--they shrank,
thanks to a tanking stock market fueled in part by corporate fraud,
charged Harman's Democratic opponent, Bill Orton.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Harman didn't vote to reform the tax laws or clean up
corruption," Orton said.</TE>
<TE>   A Harman staff member confirmed that his boss didn't vote for the
IRA bill, but not because he didn't support the idea. Democrats
amended $402 million worth of tax increases into the bill, which led
to Harman's "no" vote. It passed anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Back on the Beat for Dennis Zine</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles City Councilman Dennis Zine, a former LAPD cop,
returns to the force this month as a reserve officer. But before he
could become a man in blue again, Zine had to travel outside city
limits to get his uniform--a Long Beach company is the L.A. Police
Department's supplier.</TE>
<TE>   "Why are we giving business to Long Beach when we need business in
the city?" he wondered.</TE>
<TE>   Pulling out his receipt last week for a reporter, Zine also
questioned why he had to shell out $125 for two short-sleeve
shirts--in polyester, no less! There's got to be a cheaper deal, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   One question, Councilman: If you still have the LAPD uniform you
wore before you retired, why do you need a new one? Has the
cop-turned-councilman--how do we say it--taken on a new "stature" in
his loftier office?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm basically the same size," Zine replied. Moving from being a
sergeant on motorcycle duty to a weekend substitute in a patrol car
requires a different style of pants, he said, and different patches
on the shirt.</TE>
<TE>   'Quack' Charge Sparks Free Speech Debate</TE>
<TE>   An Orange County political mail house has found itself dead center
in a court fight over Nevada's political ethics commission.</TE>
<TE>   Picture Perfect Campaigns of Irvine did two pieces for the Nevada
Republican Liberty Caucus that were critical of GOP Assembly
candidate Earlene Forsythe, who lost her Las Vegas-area primary by
nine votes to former congressional aide Francis Allen.</TE>
<TE>   One piece referred to Forsythe, a nurse practitioner, as a
"quack"; the other called her a carpetbagger from Reno. Forsythe
filed two complaints with the state ethics commission, which can levy
fines up to $5,000. The commission threw out the complaints
unanimously, ruling that a group's members "have a constitutional
right to free speech that can't be bridled by state ethics laws."</TE>
<TE>   The American Civil Liberties Union and the Nevada Press Assn.,
however, are suing to challenge the commission's right to exist.</TE>
<TE>   Liberty Caucus spokesman Dan Burdish says the group called
Forsythe a quack because she "flew down" from Reno to run, not to
malign her professionally.</TE>
<TE>   Picture Perfect's Jim Bieber, meanwhile, said, "All of my best hit
mailers have an animal theme."</TE>
<TE>   Constituents Not Ready for Such Openness</TE>
<TE>   Public exposure is usually welcomed by politicians, but it isn't
necessarily a pleasant thing, according to Ventura County Supervisor
John Flynn.</TE>
<TE>   Flynn and his colleagues were recently discussing how to fill a
vacancy on a county treasury committee. Supervisor Judy Mikels was
bemoaning how difficult it is to get people to sit on boards because
they are required to disclose finances.</TE>
<TE>   That's when Flynn, a 29-year officeholder who knows a thing or two
about conflict-of-interest statements, jumped in.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of like taking your clothes off in public," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Points Taken</TE>
<TE>   * A group of nine Los Angeles downtown hotel managers met last
week with members of the city's Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau board to
discuss their complaints about bookings by the bureau. The hotel
managers, who are furious about the lack of conventioneers to fill
their rooms, gave the bureau board until Oct. 15 to address their
leadership concerns.</TE>
<TE>   * Mary Polanco, Concepcion Molina and Lupe Padilla may not be
household names in Southern California politics, but their offspring
are. The three women will be honored at a benefit Thursday for La
Posada, a shelter for teenage mothers. The women will be accompanied
by their grown children: state Sen. Richard Polanco, Los Angeles
County Supervisor Gloria Molina and L.A. City Council President Alex
Padilla.</TE>
<TE>   * With a debate over secession raging in Los Angeles, it probably
was a good idea that the League of California Cities decided to
instead hold its annual event this month in Long Beach, especially
given this year's theme: "Strength in Unity."</TE>
<TE>   * San Fernando Valley mayoral candidate Mel Wilson often uses
sports metaphors in his speeches. It comes naturally. Wilson was a
Kodak All-American football player from Cal State Northridge who went
on to play in the pros as a defensive back for the New York Giants,
Kansas City Chiefs and Calgary Stampede before a knee injury ended
that career.</TE>

<HD>Lawsuit May Force Change in Prison Ban on Beards</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ray Morrison believes that shaving his beard would betray the tenets
of his Orthodox Jewish faith. At the state prison in Lancaster, where
Morrison is serving a 10-year sentence for assault with a
semiautomatic weapon, he is paying a price for that belief.</LD>
<LD>   The state Department of Corrections does not allow prisoners to
grow facial hair, and Morrison, 38, has been punished nine times for
refusing to shave. Since his incarceration in 1997, he has lost phone
and visitation privileges, been placed in solitary confinement and
sacrificed "good-time" credits that would have reduced his sentence.</LD>
<LD>   "I've said to Raymond, 'Please, please shave the beard,' " said
his mother, Donna Goldstein-Kekstadt. Yet her son has refused, she
said, saying that he is committed to abide by the rules of the faith
he adopted in prison.</LD>
<TE>   California corrections officials imposed the ban on long hair or
facial hair on male prisoners in 1997, the year an inmate shaved his
beard and walked out, unrecognized, from a San Diego County prison.
But in the coming weeks, a federal lawsuit filed by Muslim prisoners
in Solano may force the state to allow inmates to grow beards, if
it's part of their religious custom.</TE>
<TE>   Security Issue</TE>
<TE>   The prospect frightens prison guards, who say the ability to tell
who's who can be a matter of life and death in a maximum-security
lockup. But inmate advocates say the change would restore one of the
many prisoner privileges lost since the tough-on-crime 1990s, when
California corrections officials tightened rules on visitation,
exercise, clothing and hairstyles.</TE>
<TE>   "This would be an important step toward recognizing that people in
prison do retain certain constitutional rights," said attorney Steve
Fama of the nonprofit Prison Law Office in San Rafael.</TE>
<TE>   The challenge to the beard ban, which is under review by the 9th
Circuit Court of Appeals, contends that it violates prisoners' 1st
Amendment right to exercise their religion. But because prison
officials say long beards can hide weapons and drugs, the lawsuit
calls for facial hair only a half-inch long or less, said Susan
Christian, the attorney for the inmates.</TE>
<TE>   Preliminary Injunction</TE>
<TE>   The 300 Muslims at Solano state prison have been allowed to wear
beards since February, when U.S. District Court Judge Lawrence K.
Karlton granted a preliminary injunction. California has appealed the
lower court's decision. If the appeal is unsuccessful and the state
does not take the case to the U.S. Supreme Court, the beard ban would
have to be altered for all California prisons, the state attorney
general's office said.</TE>
<TE>   That would not sit well with the California Department of
Corrections. Spokesman Russ Heimerich said that even short beards
allow inmates to radically alter their appearances, increasing their
chances of escape.</TE>
<TE>   "This is more than just a religious freedom issue," Heimerich
said. "It's a safety and security issue, pure and simple."</TE>
<TE>   State officials are not worried about whiskers alone. They are
also challenging the constitutionality of the federal law that
Karlton relied on when he issued the Solano injunction.</TE>
<TE>   That law, the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons
Act, creates a more stringent legal test for prison regulations that
inhibit religious practices. Before its passage in 2000, prison
officials had to prove that such regulations served a legitimate
purpose. Now, they must prove that the rules are the "least
restrictive" way to achieve security goals.</TE>
<TE>   The California attorney general's office argues that Congress
overstepped its constitutional powers in passing the law. State
attorneys have also argued that the law violates the 1st Amendment
because it gives religious prisoners more rights than their
non-religious counterparts.</TE>
<TE>   In California, Deputy Atty. Gen. Tami Warwick said the law could
eventually be used to alter many other prison regulations, costing
untold millions and putting prisoners' rights ahead of prison safety.</TE>
<TE>   The state is facing a number of other lawsuits whose outcomes may
hinge on the appeals court's decision, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Among them is a challenge to the long-hair ban, which has been
criticized by Native Americans and Sikhs. Many Native Americans cut
their hair only when in mourning, and Sikhs do not cut any body hair.</TE>
<TE>   But Warwick is also worried that the new law could be invoked to
protect the most unorthodox and personal concepts of "religious"
observance, forcing wardens and guards to sort out esoteric
theological issues that even scholars disagree on.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the idea that men must wear beards is not shared by all
Muslims, nor is it shared by all Jews. While the Muslims at Solano
believe the half-inch beard is an acceptable compromise, Morrison
refuses to cut his beard at all, Goldstein-Kekstadt said.</TE>
<TE>   Although less-Orthodox Jews might compromise, experts acknowledge
that some traditions justify Morrison's position. But the
interpretation of some extremist groups of what constitutes
"religion" is proving more troublesome.</TE>
<TE>   In Ohio, for example, some imprisoned white power groups say they
are practitioners of Asatru, the pre-Christian religion of the
Vikings, according to Todd Marti, an assistant solicitor in the Ohio
attorney general's office. As symbols of their faith, they often wear
chains with symbols of the god Thor.</TE>
<TE>   Conveniently, the chains also signify gang rank, Marti said.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio, along with six other states, Puerto Rico and the Virgin
Islands, mentioned these concerns in a friend-of-court brief filed
earlier this year in support of California's appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "Under the old law, we had a rational basis for stopping these
things," Marti said. "Now we have to show that we have the
least-restrictive regulation."</TE>
<TE>   Regulations Vary</TE>
<TE>   Grooming regulations at state prison systems vary: Ohio prisoners,
for example, are allowed to wear half-inch beards. In federal
prisons, facial hair has been allowed since the 1970s. When federal
inmates change their appearances, prison guards simply take new
security photos of them.</TE>
<TE>   Aaron Levinson, director of the Anti-Defamation League's San
Fernando Valley office, has asked California prison officials to
switch to a similar system so inmates such as Morrison can grow
beards.</TE>
<TE>   The department has rejected the idea. Heimerich has said it would
be too expensive and complicated.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Levinson and Goldstein-Kekstadt say they are amazed that
prisoners rounded up during the war in Afghanistan have more latitude
than Morrison, a U.S. citizen.</TE>
<TE>   Although some of the 600 detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, were
initially forced to shave their beards, they have since been allowed
to grow them out, according to Lt. Cmdr. Barbara Burfeind, a U.S.
Navy spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   "We're bending over backward for the Al Qaeda prisoners," Levinson
said. "In California, our own citizens are being treated worse."</TE>
<TE>   Goldstein-Kekstadt is trying to have her son transferred to her
home state of Illinois, where state prisoners can grow long beards,
but are limited to non-contact visits and subjected to more intense
searches.</TE>
<TE>   Thus far, she has been unsuccessful.</TE>
<TE>   While Morrison has been punished at Lancaster for refusing to
shave, he has not been forced to remove his beard. In addition to
those citations, he has been cited for violations, including fighting
and possession of alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not a model inmate," Lt. Ron Nipper said. "He's got his
beard. He can work that out with the courts."</TE>

<HD>Protection Debated for One of Last Wild Rivers</HD>
<DH>Environment: Bid for U.S. safeguards faces opposition from
power companies, sportsmen.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN M. GLIONNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GOD'S BATH, Calif.</DL>
<LD>In those stressful days following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks,
when Jenna Olsen desperately pined for an emotional outlet, she knew
just where to find it. She hurried to a pristine waterfall along the
isolated Clavey River that tumbles over salmon-colored rocks into a
succession of blue-green pools.</LD>
<LD>   "My soul sort of called out for this place," she said.</LD>
<LD>   The little-known Clavey is one of California's most remote and
wildest rivers, unblocked by dams and unscarred by the hand of man as
it courses 47 miles through the forested wilderness of the western
Sierra, not far from Yosemite National Park.</LD>
<TE>   The cold, free-flowing Clavey's waters have given birth to
world-class rapids, frisky wild trout and a surrounding ecosystem of
native species. And all of it, say those who relish this river, is in
peril.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, naturalists barely held off a utility that wanted to
build a 413-foot-high dam in one of the Clavey's narrow granite
canyons. Olsen fears the utility will be back.</TE>
<TE>   Olsen, executive director of the Tuolumne River Preservation
Trust, insists that the Clavey is a poster river for a bill before
Congress to protect a huge swath of federal lands and free-flowing
sections of rivers from invasive development.</TE>
<TE>   Sponsored by Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), the California Wild
Heritage Act of 2002 would protect 2.5 million acres of federal land
from invasive development and give portions of 22 rivers protection
under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. Included are the Clavey and the
Tuolumne's south fork in the Stanislaus National Forest and the
Southern Kern, San Diego and Kings rivers in Southern California. The
bill would increase by 450 miles the 1,900 miles--1% of the state's
190,000 miles of rivers--that already are protected from logging and
mining that occur on many federal lands.</TE>
<TE>   The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act requires government oversight
agencies such as the Bureau of Land Management or U.S. Forest Service
to create a protection plan for an area extending one-quarter mile to
either side of selected rivers. It leaves the areas open to
recreational use, supporters say.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the wilderness cause has an angry torrent of enemies--from
equestrians and users of all-terrain vehicles to hunters, farmers,
ranchers and the timber and hydroelectric power industries--who say
the Boxer bill would trample on their rights to tracts maintained
with taxpayer dollars. Introduced this summer, along with two
companion bills in the House, Boxer's legislation is being debated by
the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Definitions at Issue</TE>
<TE>   Just what the wild-and-scenic designation means depends on which
side of the issue you stand on. While naturalists say the bill would
merely add a level of future protection to federal land and rivers,
critics say outdoor enthusiasts are being closed out of their own
woods. They call the effort an environmental land grab that would let
roads and trails fall into disrepair.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the plan to apply the designation to the 22 rivers are
exploring alternative legislation that they say would better preserve
the rights of forest users.</TE>
<TE>   "For sportsmen, it's just one more imaginary fence being built,
one more 'Keep Out' sign, one more way our access is being limited,"
said Toby Horst, president of the Backcountry Horsemen of California.
"We're not against wilderness. But we are against these newfangled
areas that are being made off-limits to real people."</TE>
<TE>   While he acknowledges that the Boxer legislation would not ban
equestrian use of such areas, he said that allowing trails to grow
over would discourage riders and have the same effect.</TE>
<TE>   Kay Bargmann said such assumptions are wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "The Clavey is among the last free-flowing rivers in the
Sierra--the rest have been dammed up," said the former board member
of the Clavey River Coalition. "This is about protecting what we
cherish, to share it with future generations and not covet it for
ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the state's electricity interests, which have their own
ideas for the river, aren't giving up easily.</TE>
<TE>   "A dam on the Clavey would provide another means to store water--a
precious commodity in California," said Tony Walker, a spokesman for
the Turlock Irrigation District, which was defeated in its proposal
to dam the Clavey in 1996. "While our plans are now in limbo, we're
opposed to anything that would preclude us from reviving them in the
future."</TE>
<TE>   The Clavey River's north-to-south journey is like a natural luge
ride, an 8,000-foot plunge down the Sierra's western slope. Its
headwaters originate in California's highest terrain in the Emigrant
Wilderness and empty at its eventual confluence with the Tuolumne
River far below.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, the river and its tributaries roar through
rock-hewn gorges and ease gracefully past thousands of acres of
old-growth forest laden with groves of aspen, ponderosa pine and
mixed conifer. In Bell Meadow, at its upper reaches, the river cuts
through the winter grazing ground of Yosemite's deer herd. The year's
new fawns are born there and bald eagles often hover overhead.</TE>
<TE>   The Clavey is crossed by only three backcountry roads and runs
almost entirely through land maintained by the U.S. Forest Service.
Still, anglers are drawn to the state's first officially designated
"Wild Trout River." It has native species found in few other places.</TE>
<TE>   Expert kayakers consider the river's white-water rapids to be the
most challenging on the continent. They include runs designated Class
V, which indicates a high degree of difficulty.</TE>
<TE>   "The Clavey is the classic California white-water run," said
kayaker John Woolard. "In the spring, it's an unfettered, undammed
rush of High Sierra snow melt. It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience."</TE>
<TE>   Letters of Support</TE>
<TE>   Boxer has received scores of letters from people who support
protecting the Clavey. One came from a former Japanese internment
victim who said he needs the solace and beauty of the Clavey "just to
keep me going." Another was sent by a Sonora restaurant owner who
explained that he wanted his grandchildren "to experience nature in
person, not at IMAX."</TE>
<TE>   Another voice of support came from an unlikely source: "Here I am,
a retired aluminum company executive, having spent a career in an
industry that depends on heavy usage of electricity, lobbying my
heart out to save a granite fishing stream and beauty spot for
posterity," Bruce Wilson wrote. "But folks need to have precious
places like the Clavey to refresh their souls and God made only a
few."</TE>
<TE>   But critics point to what they call the bill's Achilles heel: By
restricting access and not maintaining existing roads and trails,
they say, officials would handicap efforts to fight the kind of
forest fires that swept the Western United States this summer.</TE>
<TE>   "The state's highest fire danger runs right through the heart of
that country," Sherry Brennan, a spokeswoman for the Tuolumne County
Farm Bureau, said of the Clavey area. "How are they going to fight a
fire they can't even reach? These politicians need to understand that
what often looks and sounds good on paper becomes an entirely
different story when it comes to practical application."</TE>
<TE>   Olsen, of the Tuolumne River Preservation Trust, insists that the
argument doesn't hold up.</TE>
<TE>   Under the bill, all means of firefighting are allowed. And in the
case of the Clavey, all of the present 500 miles of roads in the
Clavey watershed would be preserved, meaning firefighters could
attack a blaze on the ground and in the air, Olsen said.</TE>
<TE>   Critics also cite other reasons for opposition. The Kern County
Board of Supervisors has said the Boxer legislation would hamper
future decision-makers' options. But it has voted to remain neutral
on the legislation, which would designate nearly 29 miles of the
lower Kern River as wild and scenic.</TE>
<TE>   The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act allows for three designations of
rivers. Wild rivers carry the most severe restrictions, followed by
scenic and recreational rivers. The designations are determined by
the use at the time of the law's passage.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Hilda Solis (D-El Monte), who is sponsoring a House version
of the Boxer bill for Southern California, said existing activities
along the Clavey, including hunting, fishing, livestock grazing and
horseback riding, would be allowed under the legislation.</TE>
<TE>   She said many people have mistaken river restrictions for the more
stringent rules governing new wilderness areas, where motorized
vehicles are prohibited. "We've worked with critics to assure them
we're not trampling on people's property rights," she said, adding
that her staff had assured mountain bike groups that "well-used
paths" would continue to exist.</TE>
<TE>   Don Amador, western representative of the Blue Ribbon Coalition, a
national recreation access group, is exploring legislation that he
said would protect resources but still allow for public access. "It's
very simple," he said. "Resources can be protected hand in hand with
managed recreation."</TE>
<TE>   Dam Project Blocked</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, the Clavey has survived some close brushes with
development. With the rallying cry of "Save the Clavey," more than a
dozen environmental, fishing and rafting groups fought the Turlock
Irrigation District's $345-million dam project six years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Our little slingshot wasn't very powerful in the beginning," said
inn owner Peggy Mosely, who became a lead Clavey River activist. "But
the message got out and I think our efforts to stop that dam changed
the way people look at the environment. And we're not about to give
back what we won. And on the Clavey, that means no development, no
dams, no nothing."</TE>
<TE>   Walker, of the Turlock Irrigation District, said the naturalists
are guilty of their own misinformation. He said the Clavey runs not
as a river, but as a trickle for most of the summer and that, at the
very least, a dam would regulate the river's flow.</TE>
<TE>   "They make all these assertions that this river is so pristine
when miners, farmers and ranchers have used it for generations," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We went to an extreme amount of work and expense to engineer a
dam that was environmentally friendly, to the point that the dam had
gaskets where it would meet the canyon walls to keep it from
squeaking and scaring the deer. We're not ready to give up on our
idea just yet."</TE>
<TE>   On a recent afternoon, Monica Weakly stood atop the Clavey's most
picturesque waterfall. Shouting over the river's roar, the Sierra
Nevada program director for the Tuolumne River Trust said she visits
the spot whenever she can.</TE>
<TE>   "This is God's Bath," she said as she prepared to take a 10-foot
dive into one of the clear cold pools. "It's aptly named. Because
it's just divine."</TE>
<TE>   And then she jumped.</TE>

<HD>Study Helps Carpool Lanes Get Go-Ahead</HD>
<DH>MTA: Ride-share system, popular with the public, works well
enough that the agency will expand it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN and CAITLIN LIU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles County is home to the largest carpool-lane system in the
nation, a 420-mile web of asphalt that has been billed as a key tool
for alleviating the region's worsening traffic gridlock.</LD>
<LD>   For the most part, the county's carpool lanes have lived up to the
billing. But a new analysis has found that some stretches of freeway
fail to meet minimum thresholds for vehicle use, while others are so
crowded that motorists save little time by using them. The analysis
also found that only about one-third of the trips in carpool lanes
are for work. Many more are for leisure.</LD>
<LD>   Still, the study by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority--to
date, the most in-depth analysis of the county's carpool-lane
system--concluded that the special lanes cut travel time for most
carpoolers, encourage ride-sharing and help reduce smog.</LD>
<TE>   Carpool lanes also have the support of a vast majority of the
public, according to the study.</TE>
<TE>   MTA officials say the study's findings reinforce the agency's own
goal of expanding the system by building carpool lanes in nearly
every freeway in the county and connecting the lanes to form a
seamless regionwide system.</TE>
<TE>   MTA officials plan to add nearly 250 miles of carpool lanes in the
next decade.</TE>
<TE>   Planning chief James de la Loza conceded that some carpool-lane
segments have failed to meet specific goals established by the MTA.
But he expects those lanes to improve dramatically, once the system
is expanded.</TE>
<TE>   De la Loza hopes such improvement will take place on the Hollywood
Freeway in the San Fernando Valley. The freeway's carpool lanes have
been open since 1997, but still fail to meet the minimum threshold of
800 vehicles per hour, a goal recommended by most transportation
agencies.</TE>
<TE>   De la Loza said the carpool lanes on the Hollywood Freeway may be
used too little because the segment is short--only 4.5 miles long.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, the carpool lanes on the Orange Freeway between
Orange County and the Pomona Freeway are so congested that travel
speeds average less than 30 mph during rush hours. Carpoolers save
less than three minutes in their commute compared with drivers who
use other lanes of the freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say the time-saving benefit of a carpool lane must be
sufficient to outweigh the time it takes to set up a daily carpool.</TE>
<TE>   "It takes a lot of time to carpool," said Joy Dahlgren, a research
engineer at UC Berkeley's Partners for Advanced Transit and Highways
program. "You have to wait for people, to pick them up."</TE>
<TE>   Because such benefits are minimal on the Orange Freeway, the MTA
study said, the economic benefit to motorists on the freeway will not
surpass the cost of building carpool lanes along the freeway until
2016.</TE>
<TE>   In the Orange Freeway's crowded carpool lanes and others, De la
Loza said, the MTA could try to improve traffic flow by increasing
the minimum occupancy from two to at least three people per car. He
said the MTA might also add more bus lines along the route.</TE>
<TE>   Time Incentive Minimal</TE>
<TE>   The time incentive is also minimal in the carpool lane of the
Ronald Reagan Freeway in the San Fernando Valley. During peak
commuting hours there, the average speed is about 70 mph, while the
average speed in the adjacent lanes is 61 mph, according to the
study. Motorists who carpool on this stretch save only about 10
seconds per mile.</TE>
<TE>   De la Loza said that the MTA would continue to study ways to
improve the county's carpool-lane system, but that it had not imposed
a deadline for meeting the agency's goals.</TE>
<TE>   The MTA study included a survey of more than 3,000 residents that
found that carpool lanes are enormously popular, with 88% public
support.</TE>
<TE>   However, the survey found that only about one-third of carpool
trips are made by people on their way to work. Nearly half of the
carpools in the county are personal or social trips, such as visits
to family and friends, according to the MTA study.</TE>
<TE>   The study also found that about 60% of carpools consist of family
members--husbands, wives and children. About 40% carry co-workers.</TE>
<TE>   Alan Pisarski, author of the book "Commuting in America," said the
MTA's survey results are not surprising.</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California, he noted, commuting patterns have become
diffuse, with employment centers scattered throughout the region. He
said that explains why most carpoolers are spouses and children, a
practice that he calls fampooling.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just getting harder and harder to put together a carpool
with somebody who is going where you are going at the same time you
are going," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Because of this problem, Pisarski said, he doubts that carpool use
in Los Angeles County will increase substantially, even if the MTA
expands and connects all the carpool lanes in the system.</TE>
<TE>   Diamond Lanes Helpful</TE>
<TE>   Jovany Febrez, a filing clerk from Chatsworth, is an example of a
leisure carpooler. He said he doesn't carpool to his Encino job
because it's not convenient.</TE>
<TE>   But he finds the diamond lanes are a great advantage on the
weekend when he, his wife and their three children hit the road in
their minivan to visit family in Pasadena or Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Still, transportation experts say, carpools that include family
members can help reduce congestion and smog by giving working family
members the incentive to drive together instead of taking separate
cars.</TE>
<TE>   The MTA survey also found that residents are almost evenly divided
over whether carpool lanes get enough use. Nearly half of those
surveyed said carpool lanes are underused, but just as many said
carpool lanes get enough use.</TE>
<TE>   This perception can influence how a person feels about carpool
lanes.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy Fant, a Burbank administrative assistant, said the carpool
lanes along her route to work always seem empty, and so she can't
imagine how they can reduce the region's increasing gridlock.</TE>
<TE>   "When you are sitting in traffic and you see an empty lane, that
ticks me off," Fant said. "It's an extra lane that no one uses that
much."</TE>

<HD>Now Irvine Mayor Is a Major Player</HD>
<DH>Campaign: Even opponents concede that Larry Agran is no
longer a fringe player in Orange County politics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Irvine Mayor Larry Agran's enemies brand him an opportunist, an
egoist--even a Marxist.</LD>
<LD>   They ask how conservative Irvine can get behind a man who ran for
president as a stand-in for George McGovern, had the city host
members of a baseball team from then-Marxist Nicaragua, and champions
a much-despised proposal for the Orange County CenterLine, which
would link the well-manicured sprawl of Irvine with urban Santa Ana
by light rail.</LD>
<LD>   "He's like the old Mayor Daley and Boss Tweed rolled into one,"
said Bill Mavity, treasurer of the anti-CenterLine group Fund
Alternatives Instead of Rail.</LD>
<TE>   The wonkish, soft-spoken mayor who casts himself as a populist
underdog says he has grown accustomed to the tags. But as he runs for
reelection as mayor, heading a slate of like-minded Irvine City
Council candidates, Agran has acquired a new label: Goliath. That's
what his opponent, Mike House, called him at a recent campaign event.</TE>
<TE>   Strengthened by his leadership of the successful movement to kill
the proposed El Toro airport and instead build a "Great Park" at the
closed 4,700-acre Marine base--a quest that not long ago was widely
considered nearly as quixotic as his 1992 presidential
campaign--Agran has become a progressive titan in a conservative
area.</TE>
<TE>   "No one sees him as a peripheral force ... anymore," said Fred
Smoller, chairman of the political science department at Chapman
University. "This guy is a mainstream player in the county."</TE>
<TE>   Agran's political power has been cemented by his New
Democrat-style shift toward the center, including alliances with The
Irvine Co. and other power brokers he once railed against. His
willingness to shorten the proposed CenterLine route so that it
doesn't go through communities that oppose it has further undercut
his critics.</TE>
<TE>   But it remains to be seen whether Agran's coattails are long
enough to carry his slate of "Agranistas"--a label they defiantly
adopted following the Nicaragua incident--on to the City Council with
him come Nov. 5.</TE>
<TE>   A trio of opponents including House, who call themselves the New
Priorities Team, is seeking to take control of the city. Their
platform: The El Toro fight has been won and it is time for new
leadership focused on keeping taxes down and helping the city's
financially strapped schools instead of building transit-oriented
villages and holding taxpayer-sponsored multicultural events at City
Hall.</TE>
<TE>   "Larry's moving away from what people came to Irvine for," said
Christina Shea, a longtime Agran opponent and former mayor who is
running for City Council on the New Priorities slate. "They came for
this sprawled, beautiful place, with lots of green and houses set
back from the street. We are not into these high-density, no-cars
ideas....People in Irvine like their cars."</TE>
<TE>   At a recent Chamber of Commerce candidates forum, Shea and running
mate Chuck DeVore sought to paint Agran's allies on the
ballot--Councilwoman Beth Krom and photo-processing store owner Mitch
Goldstone--as puppets.</TE>
<TE>   The four candidates are vying for two open council seats, along
with Linda Lee Grau, who is not affiliated with either slate.</TE>
<TE>   Agran's lone opponent in the race for mayor is House.</TE>
<TE>   But Shea and DeVore directed their attacks at Agran during the
forum.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor stood his ground, belittling the New Priorities
candidates for what he said was their promise to trim millions of
dollars worth of fat from the city budget. Exactly what fat were they
talking about, he asked. He seemed unimpressed by their vague
answers.</TE>
<TE>   He also said he resented the implication that he is a puppet
master controlling his allies on the council. "That is an insult to
our entire community," Agran said in a later interview.</TE>
<TE>   But even as Agran kept his cool, one of his Agranistas stumbled.</TE>
<TE>   Goldstone acknowledged--and later disavowed--a $50,000 loan from
an out-of-state uncle, which he reported as coming from himself.
State law does not allow candidates to misrepresent the source of
contributions. Such a contribution would exceed the city's $340
limit.</TE>
<TE>   Campaign finance has become a key issue in the Irvine election,
with outside political action committees expected to pour tens of
thousands of dollars into advertising for both sides. Also getting
involved are nonprofit organizations with anonymous donors funding
large political mailings.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been ratcheted up to unbelievable levels," said
termed-out Councilman Greg Smith of the money it now takes to run a
viable campaign in Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   Smith contends that Agran's supporters are the ones who have
exploited loopholes in the city's campaign finance law, thereby
triggering a fundraising race. He says the mayor's vows to get money
out of politics are disingenuous.</TE>
<TE>   And he says the same thing about Agran's promises on CenterLine.</TE>
<TE>   "This business about letting people decide whether it will go
through their neighborhoods is a whole lot of smoke," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Agran team says Smith and others are trying to create an issue
where one doesn't exist.</TE>
<TE>   "The reality is: CenterLine will go nowhere unless the residents
approve it," said Councilman Chris Mears, a close Agran ally who is
not up for reelection. "Our opponents are just trying to misconstrue
the facts so they seem to create some kind of threat to the city.
Nobody is going to force this down anybody's throat."</TE>
<TE>   It's not the CenterLine rhetoric that has annoyed the Agranistas
the most, however. The biggest annoyance is that their opponents are
trying to trumpet their role in killing the proposed El Toro airport.</TE>
<TE>   Shea says she was instrumental in fighting the airport during her
term as mayor, and her running mates say they were at the front lines
as private citizens.</TE>
<TE>   "These people are like blisters," Agran said. "They show up after
all the hard work is done. I don't recall a single instance in which
they took part in that campaign."</TE>
<TE>   El Toro remains at the top of Agran's platform. He insists that
the airport threat is not completely gone. And he has been promising
voters that if reelected, he will personally be involved in ripping
out the runways with a jackhammer within months.</TE>
<TE>   "Here we are having marched 90 yards down the field and I am
determined not to fumble the ball heading into the end zone," Agran
said. "If my opponents are saying the airport is already dead, they
are betraying an ignorance that is shocking."</TE>
<TE>   Smoller says Agran is smart to keep pounding on the airport theme.</TE>
<TE>   "The Great Park thing has been an amazing victory, and it was his
vision," Smoller said. "Voters will reward that kind of
effectiveness."</TE>
<TE>   Yet others bristle when Agran is cast as a visionary--and not only
those from the right.</TE>
<TE>   Former close Agran aide Stephen Smith accuses Agran of selling out
on his way to the political center. He said he was shocked to learn
that the mayor was accepting campaign contributions from Irvine Co.
executives at the same time that the company had a high-density
development proposal before the city that will increase its
population by a third.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal was approved unanimously by the City Council in June.</TE>
<TE>   "He would never have done that a decade ago," Smith said of
Agran's push to get the development approved. "And if someone else
had done it, he would have ridden in on a white horse to stop it at
all costs."</TE>
<TE>   Agran says the development on unincorporated land has been part of
the city's General Plan for years and will preserve large swaths of
open space.</TE>
<TE>   If city officials had rejected it, he said, The Irvine Co. could
have simply taken its proposal to county officials and gotten
approval for an even bigger development.</TE>
<TE>   "After 10 years of knock-down, drag-out confrontations with The
Irvine Co., we finally forged an agreement that allows us to move
toward build out in a balanced way," he said. "We are keeping faith
with what our growth plan has been for as long as I have been in
office."</TE>

<HD>Port Talks Fail; Bush May Act</HD>
<DH>Labor: Mediator says collapse of negotiations means there
is a 'good possibility' the federal government will force reopening
of the docks.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Talks between the longshore union and shipping line group collapsed
Sunday night, and a federal mediator said there was a "good
possibility" the Bush administration would invoke the Taft-Hartley
Act to reopen West Coast cargo ports.</LD>
<LD>   Peter J. Hurgten, director of the Federal Mediation and
Conciliation Service, emerged from a meeting with negotiators from
both sides about 11:30 p.m. Sunday, saying there would probably not
be further meetings for "a few days."</LD>
<LD>   While saying there was a good chance Bush would invoke the
Taft-Hartley Act to establish an 80-day cooling-off period, Hurtgen
noted that it was not his decision.</LD>
<TE>   Retailers, manufacturers and others dependent on Pacific Rim
imports, however, have been steadily escalating pressure on Bush to
act in the absence of progress in the talks.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Miniace, president of the Pacific Maritime Assn., which
represents shippers and terminal operators, said a three-member board
of inquiry that must be impaneled as a precursor to invoking
Taft-Hartley was already in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been told the Taft-Hartley Act is imminent," Miniace said
shortly before midnight. Asked if expects ports to reopen in the next
day or two, Miniace replied, "I think so."</TE>
<TE>   But he also raised concerns that work slowdowns that prompted the
management lockout Sept. 29 would continue.</TE>
<TE>   James Spinosa, president of the International Longshore and
Warehouse Union, held out little hope for a quick resolution of the
issues separating labor and management.</TE>
<TE>   "This set of bargaining is over for us. We did our best to
accommodate the mediator," he said. "We're going back to the drawing
board."</TE>
<TE>   Spinosa said the union had offered to extend the old contract for
seven days, which would allow ports to reopen, but that the Pacific
Maritime Assn. had refused.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Sugerman, a spokesman for the shippers, said that offer was
rejected because it was conditioned on removing labor-saving
technology from the talks.</TE>
<TE>   "The union effectively decided tonight to keep the ports shut
down, and to invite Taft-Hartley," Sugerman said.</TE>
<TE>   Hurtgen began talks Thursday, shuttling between negotiators for
the shipping lines and the union at a San Francisco hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, the talks were described as promising. But that early
optimism faded as sessions ran late into each night, with little or
no progress reported on core issues.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific Maritime Assn. closed the ports Sept. 29 after
accusing the union of staging a series of work slowdowns that cut
productivity in half and made operations more costly than closing the
ports entirely.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the employers have said they will reopen the ports
only if the union signs a new contract or agrees to extend the old
one, which would prevent workers from staging disruptions.</TE>
<TE>   Political and economic pressure on all parties has been building
since then, as enormous container vessels, loaded with food,
garments, electronic goods and other imports, stacked up along the
coast. Losses in the billions of dollars have already rippled through
the U.S. economy.</TE>
<TE>   The lockout has exposed the national economy's increasing
dependence on West Coast ports, through which about half of all
seaborne cargo moves.</TE>
<TE>   Retailers with only a few days of inventory on hand are worried
about empty shelves at Christmas, and factories dependent on imported
parts have already started shutting down.</TE>
<TE>   As the losses grew, a growing number of business groups and
legislators called for the Bush administration to invoke the
Taft-Hartley Act, which was last used by President Carter in a failed
attempt to break a coal mining strike. The AFL-CIO has argued
strenuously against using the act.</TE>
<TE>   As a first step, President Bush must appoint a board of inquiry
that would investigate whether the lockout was causing significant
damage to the national economy. If so, Bush could seek an injunction
forcing the ports to reopen.</TE>
<TE>   Even if a deal is cut soon, untangling the backed up cargo at the
ports will take weeks, according to shippers and analysts. The first
casualty will be traffic around the ports. When the word goes out
that the port is opening, truckers are expected to descend on the
ports en masse to try to get first in line. Terminal Island in the
Port of Los Angeles will be gridlock.</TE>
<TE>   The unloading of the ships is likely to be done on a first-come,
first-served basis, although refrigerated cargo, perishables and any
emergency items will get priority.</TE>
<TE>   Large retailers desperate for holiday shipments are also likely to
place pressure on shipping lines to move their goods to the head of
the line, according to industry experts.</TE>
<TE>   But there is a limit to how quickly cargo can move. Shippers are
limited by the size of their berths. Taiwan's Evergreen Shipping
Line, whose terminal is on Terminal Island, can handle two ships at a
time. In a ship that carries 4,000 to 6,000 containers, there will be
space for about 400 refrigerated containers.</TE>
<TE>   Those refrigerated containers will be unloaded first, said Robert
Kleist, a longtime shipping executive and advisor to Evergreen. He
said each shipping line will have to develop a system for giving
priority to containers.</TE>
<TE>   Another bottleneck will be the railroads, which have quit sending
container trains to transfer facilities until they are certain they
won't have a pileup of trains stuck on the West Coast.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the railroads are going to have tremendous demand placed
on them, once the cargo starts to move," Kleist said. "I hope they
have gotten as many locomotives here in Southern California as they
can possibly put on the tracks."</TE>
<TE>   The union and shipping group, which began negotiating in mid-May,
have deadlocked on the issue of technology. Terminal operators want
to speed the flow of goods through their terminals by using scanners,
sensors and electronic tracking devices, which will keep track of
thousands of containers on ships and in the yard.</TE>
<TE>   That technology would eliminate about 400 highly paid marine clerk
jobs, union negotiators said. They said they would accept the losses
only if they were guaranteed jurisdiction over all new jobs related
to the technology, including computer programming and repair, plus
some planning jobs that are now nonunion</TE>
<TE>   For decades, as technology changed the nature of dock work, the
union has fought to defend or expand its jurisdiction and thus retain
control of the waterfront. It has used that control to win some of
the best wages and benefits in blue-collar America. Average wages
range from $80,000 to $167,000 per year, according to the shipping
group.</TE>
<TE>   Already, the port closures have cost Southern California
communities $375 million in lost trade from the ports of Los Angeles
and Long Beach, according to a study released this weekend by the Los
Angeles County Economic Development Corp.</TE>
<TE>   California has suffered a $1.2-billion hit to its import and
export business, just from the closure of the two ports, the agency
said.</TE>
<TE>   Those losses are only part of the total economic damage, said the
agency's Wally Baker, because the numbers are based on customs data
and capture only about two-thirds of the total value of goods shipped
through local ports.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the overall money will be collected on those products
once they get delivered, but you will see that it can take a long
time to recover from a one-week shutdown of those ports," Baker said.
"Some of the smaller people will go out of business. They can't stand
this for very long."</TE>
<TE>   Many businesses said they had tried to prepare for disruptions by
accelerating shipping cycles and planning alternate transportation.
But most added that if the ports remained closed for two weeks or
more, there would be little they could do to salvage the goods that
would not make it to manufacturers and retailers around the globe.</TE>
<TE>   By the weekend, at least 160 container ships were stranded along
the coast, with the largest number at the ports of Los Angeles and
Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   With 40 more vessels expected by the end of today, those ports
could be beyond full.</TE>

<HD>A Telling Tale of 2 Temples</HD>
<DH>Religion: Newport Beach neighbors battle over form of
Mormon project, while Redlands twin is half completed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a dusty Redlands hillside where tract homes and orange groves
meet, the most sacred of Mormon buildings is already half complete.
Under the bright sun, workers in hard hats use a crane to guide
large, 5-inch-thick granite slabs into place on the temple's
exterior.</LD>
<LD>   "It's beyond belief," said Mayor Kasey Haws, himself a Mormon,
about watching his church's holiest symbol quickly rise in his town
at the base of the San Bernardino Mountains. "I still have trouble
absorbing it."</LD>
<LD>   Sixty-five miles away in Newport Beach, officials with the Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had hoped a second, identical
temple--announced the same day last year as the one in
Redlands--would have matched the progress of its inland twin.</LD>
<TE>   But 18 months later, the 7-acre site above a canyon on the city's
north end remains vacant. Although church leaders say the essence of
the temple design is ordained by God and therefore nonnegotiable,
construction has been delayed by tenacious residents who live in the
surrounding million-dollar homes. Concerned about blocked views,
excessive lighting and traffic, and a potential drop in property
values, the group of high-powered professionals and others have
fought many aspects of the building's original plans, from its
124-foot steeple to its white color scheme.</TE>
<TE>   On a hunch, one homeowner and part-time sailor even used a sextant
to measure the steeple on the Mormon meeting house across the street
from the temple site. He discovered that the spire is 68 feet high,
or 18 feet shorter than advertised in city documents. Opponents
called the discovery significant because church officials had said
the temple steeple needed to be 124 feet, in part, to rise above the
neighboring spire.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, before an overflow crowd at Newport Beach City Hall,
church officials won Planning Commission approval for the temple
after unveiling another set of plans that included a reduced,
100-foot steeple. But the issue--and all its controversy--most likely
will be appealed by residents or a council member and end up at the
City Council in the weeks to come.</TE>
<TE>   The opposing viewpoints--one secular, one religious--have brought
a stalemate that's left little ground for compromise. Homeowners say
they want to focus on how the 17,500-square-foot building will affect
the surrounding residential neighborhood. Their strategy purposely
left religion out of the debate. Whether it's a Mormon temple or a
Ralphs supermarket is beside the point, they contend. The issue is
whether the project fits in the neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   "We've stuck to the facts," said Steven Brombal, president of the
Bonita Canyon Homeowners Assn. "This is a building issue that has
nothing to do with religion."</TE>
<TE>   Church leaders, by contrast, say religion is an essential part of
the debate. In addition to arguing that the building won't hurt the
neighborhood, church leaders say the temple's design has been
divinely decreed. Therefore, it's impossible to compromise over
neighbors' concerns as is common with other developments.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Mormon meeting houses where regular Sunday services are
held, temples--with their dazzling white interiors and prism-like
windows--are believed by church members to be the spiritual bridge
between heaven and Earth. The sacred space--only 60 exist in the
country, including those under construction--is reserved for life's
most significant events, such as baptisms and marriages. Only church
members in good standing may enter a temple.</TE>
<TE>   And only the church's president, who also is considered a prophet,
can approve a temple's design. Church officials say President Gordon
B. Hinckley, 92, twice visited the Newport Beach property on Bonita
Canyon Road near MacArthur Boulevard to get a sense of what kind of
building was needed. And any city mandate that changes the temple's
architecture is seen by the 11-million member church as an
infringement on its religious briefs and a contradiction of God's
design.</TE>
<TE>   "Although the city may not share the belief that [the church
president] has the divine mandate to do this, we trust that you will
respect the fact that church members do believe it," wrote
Weatherford Clayton, president of the Newport Beach stake, or region,
of the church.</TE>
<TE>   This is how the pingpong match in Newport Beach has gone. Mormon
officials say their theology dictates a 124-foot steeple in Newport
Beach.</TE>
<TE>   A resident digs up a mound of documents that lists Mormon temples
worldwide with either no steeples, or spires under 80 feet. The
church leaders say divine inspiration is different for each of their
126 temples and for each church president, meaning there's no
standard architecture.</TE>
<TE>   Then in late September, Mormon officials say their prophet in Salt
Lake City has approved a second temple design for Newport Beach, this
one with a smaller steeple and a redesigned, California-mission style
building. The plans were publicly unveiled Thursday evening at the
Planning Commission meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Some residents say they were stunned by the unexpected changes,
wondering why they were told for months that no modifications were
possible because the temple design was divinely inspired. Mormon
leaders countered by saying that after "much deliberation and
internal processing and in the spirit of conciliation," the prophet,
using his "unique scriptural mandate," elected to approve the second
set of plans.</TE>
<TE>   "They make unilateral changes," said Bob Dyess, a nearby homeowner
and Newport Beach attorney. "It's their way or the highway. And
that's what is so frustrating about the whole process."</TE>
<TE>   Even the temple's color has generated considerable controversy.</TE>
<TE>   Many Mormon temples--including those in San Diego and Los
Angeles--feature exteriors of brilliant white, lighted at night by
powerful spotlights, reflecting the Gospel command to follow Jesus
out of darkness and into the light.</TE>
<TE>   Under pressure from homeowners and The Irvine Co., the Newport
Beach temple changed its exterior colors from white to off-white and
finally to "Salisbury pink," a hue Mormon officials are quick to say
is more accurately described as a warm, earth-tone salmon.</TE>
<TE>   "They've gone from bad to worse," Brombal said.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph I. Bentley, a leader in the Orange County Mormon community
who has taken much of the brunt of the criticism, wonders if there's
an anti-church undercurrent to many of the complaints.</TE>
<TE>   "We listened to the homeowners, and we listened to The Irvine Co."
to come up with the exterior color, he said. "My gosh, some of them
say they have no problem in general with your building or your faith,
but ...."</TE>
<TE>   The inability of church leaders and homeowners to reach a
compromise by traditional means has led to suspicion on both sides.
Church leaders, fearing a protracted battle, warned city officials
about their constitutional right to freely practice their religion.</TE>
<TE>   An Aug. 28 memo from the Newport Beach city attorney's office
warned planning commissioners that federal law that prohibits
municipalities from imposing a "substantial burden" on the exercise
of religion, unless there's a compelling public interest.</TE>
<TE>   Residents respond by saying Mormon leaders haven't been forthright
in disclosing details of the project, letting mistakes like the
height of the existing steeple intentionally slide by and producing
unrealistic computer simulations that downplay the impact of the
temple on nearby homes.</TE>
<TE>   "This kind of stuff started from get-go," said Lori Kaiden, a
nearby homeowner. "What it comes down to is credibility."</TE>
<TE>   An hour's drive inland from Newport Beach, the quest to build a
temple has gone remarkably more smoothly. It took little more than
two months for the Redlands temple project to get city approval, with
little opposition.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Haws said that Redlands, which has always had a heavy Mormon
influence, is a town that historically has embraced religious
institutions. He points to what's known as "The Lord's Corner" at
Cajon Street and Olive Avenue, the home of three historic churches
that together get the streets closed once a year for an outdoor
ecumenical service.</TE>
<TE>   And earlier this year, the Redlands City Council unanimously
approved a 9,000-square-foot mosque with 50-foot minarets.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just about tolerance," Haws said. "We embrace different
traditions here. Everybody embraces and recognizes that a variety of
religious traditions have served the community well. We are behind
the times, and we plan on staying there."</TE>

<HD>Debate Pits Contrasts in Style</HD>
<DH>Politics: Simon and Davis, neither known for oratory, face
off before TV cameras today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One candidate follows his political script religiously and glad-hands
with robotic efficiency; the other blurts out bromides and exudes
gee-whiz enthusiasm.</LD>
<LD>   In a state of almost 35 million people, a place brimming with
camera-ready charisma, it comes down to this: The two men running for
governor just aren't naturals.</LD>
<LD>   As Gov. Gray Davis and Republican gubernatorial nominee Bill Simon
Jr. face off today in a debate sponsored by The Times, voters will
get their first sustained look this season at the candidates'
personas. With no other face-to-face meetings scheduled between Davis
and Simon, the debate may be the last event where voters can examine
at length the two major candidates for governor.</LD>
<TE>   "As public speakers and communicators, they are both a little
wooden," said Joseph Tuman, professor of political and legal
communication at San Francisco State. "If 'Saturday Night Live' was
in the position of caricaturing California politicians," they would
have a field day, he said.</TE>
<TE>   At the least, today's debate should give voters a sense of where
Davis and Simon stand. And while the candidates' lack of polish may
strip the event of some of its theater, it also may give voters an
easier chance to size up what Simon and Davis stand for.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a more honest race when you have two guys, neither of whom
was president of their high school drama club, who are fairly mundane
public speakers," said Eli Attie, a former speech writer for Al Gore
who now writes for NBC's "The West Wing." "You strip away those
levels of performance and artifice, and you really get to focus on
the race."</TE>
<TE>   "If you really want a spellbinding, charismatic entertainer," he
added, "go to the movies."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Davis certainly has never been accused of being spellbinding.</TE>
<TE>   Take his appearance at an early September labor rally. Hundreds of
nurses and janitors had gathered at a Los Angeles union hall to kick
off the Democratic governor's fall reelection campaign. Clad in
purple T-shirts, the union members whooped and hollered as an array
of labor leaders, their faces reddened by the effort, exhorted them
to get out the vote. "Si se puede!" the workers chanted, jumping up
and down, pumping their fists in the air.</TE>
<TE>   The governor--dressed neatly in a dark blue suit and light blue
shirt, his hair perfectly coiffed--carefully raised and lowered his
fist mechanically, an even smile plastered on his face.</TE>
<TE>   "Davis, I'm afraid to say, comes across as a bloodless
technocrat," said Thomas Hollihan, an associate dean at USC's
Annenberg School for Communication. "There's not a lot of warmth
there. Even when he tries to be passionate, his [mannerisms] seem to
undercut what he's saying."</TE>
<TE>   At every appearance, the governor studiously follows his talking
points, thanking the requisite elected officials and supporters. He
never fails to smile for the camera. But rarely does Davis ad-lib or
offer personal details about his life.</TE>
<TE>   During a speech to the AARP in San Diego last month, press
secretary Steve Maviglio was startled when Davis departed from his
prepared remarks and told a story about his mother-in-law's struggle
with Alzheimer's.</TE>
<TE>   It was a rare moment of openness. For the most part, when the
governor does talk about his life, the anecdotes read like marketable
snapshots: his years in Vietnam, his 1,000-square-foot West Hollywood
condominium, the scolding he got from a flight attendant--his future
wife--for delaying a plane.</TE>
<TE>   "I married a Teamster," he tells union audiences with pride.</TE>
<TE>   When he is challenged, however, Davis' careful delivery can give
way to sharp flashes of anger.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, as Simon repeatedly accused Davis of selling state
policy to his campaign donors, the governor lost patience.</TE>
<TE>   "Bill Simon has no business lecturing me," a furious Davis said
during a news conference in Oakland, jabbing his finger just inches
from a reporter's chest.</TE>
<TE>   But the governor does not often have public outbursts. Everything
about Davis, down to his daily routine, speaks to his discipline: the
perennial French blue dress shirt, the turkey sandwich on wheat (sans
mayo) and steamed broccoli he has for lunch every day.</TE>
<TE>   And then there is "the Hair." Davis' seemingly immutable cap of
gray hair is so much a part of his image that longtime state
politicos claim that no one has ever seen a strand out of place.
Republicans say voters in focus groups bring up the governor's
perfectly combed hair as an example of how overly contained Davis
appears.</TE>
<TE>   "You get the impression you could touch the hair and it would hurt
your hand," said Tuman of San Francisco State.</TE>
<TE>   The governor is not unaware of his bland image, occasionally
poking fun at his predictable mannerisms and staid style.</TE>
<TE>   When Gore would visit California, Davis used to introduce the
famously stiff vice president as his "charisma coach."</TE>
<TE>   "I was too dull and boring to be governor, but I worked hard,"
Davis told a Latino voting organization in July. "And I went on Jay
Leno, not once, but twice."</TE>
<TE>   During a September bill signing ceremony on the banks of the San
Diego River, Republican Mayor Dick Murphy told the crowd that despite
their political differences, the two men share a common bond.</TE>
<TE>   "People accuse me of being boring," Murphy said with a smile.</TE>
<TE>   The governor punched his fist in the air as he said quietly:
"Here's to boring!"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If Davis' sense of humor is understated, his opponent's borders on
cornball.</TE>
<TE>   When a state judge threw out a fraud verdict against Simon's
family investment firm in mid-September, the relieved candidate
jumped into action, conferring with advisors and doing back-to-back
interviews to exult about the decision as he campaigned through
Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   As he left the San Diego Convention Center that day, Simon was
chatting with a New York Times reporter on the phone. Then, suddenly,
he caught a glimpse of someone outside.</TE>
<TE>   "It's Willard Scott!" exclaimed the multimillionaire, gesturing to
his wife Cindy as he tossed the phone to an aide. "Oh, we have to go
talk to Willard--he's right outside!"</TE>
<TE>   Simon dashed outside and grabbed Scott as he approached a black
luxury car. Before the bewildered weatherman knew what was happening,
the beaming GOP candidate was pumping his hand.</TE>
<TE>   The burst of enthusiasm was typical of Simon, whose stern
criticism of Davis on the campaign trail regularly gives way to
boyish exclamations.</TE>
<TE>   In person, the Republican nominee comes across as affable, even
overly earnest, eagerly querying reporters about their taste in
sports and music, and punctuating his sentences with words one
wouldn't expect from a New Jersey-raised investment manager:
"m'self," "buddy," and "golly." He's constantly asking his driver to
pull into McDonald's for his favorite food: cheeseburgers.</TE>
<TE>   Simon appears unfazed, especially for a neophyte politician, by
the oddities of campaign life. He manages to maintain a broad grin in
strange situations, like the time a vendor at the state fair dragged
Simon and his family inside a booth to pose for a photo with several
large parrots.</TE>
<TE>   "Bill Simon in a small group comes across as very warm," Tuman
said. But as a speaker, "what comes across is a wooden delivery and
someone who doesn't seem that in touch."</TE>
<TE>   After 18 months of campaigning, Simon's initial awkwardness on the
stump has given way to a more confident manner. But his speeches,
riddled with platitudes, tend to sound canned, and sometimes he seems
oblivious of his audience.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, he spoke to a gathering of California fire chiefs
whose annual meeting in Ontario happened to be just miles from a
raging wildfire. The air outside the hotel was thick with ash and
smoke. Simon spoke to the chiefs for about 20 minutes, never
mentioning the fire.</TE>
<TE>   When Simon does break from his prepared remarks and try to engage
with an audience, he speaks fervently.</TE>
<TE>   "Please know this one thing," he recently told several hundred
seniors at Leisure World, his brow furrowing with sincerity. "The
Simon family loves California. We want to make a difference. Our
hearts are in the right place, just as I know all of your hearts are
in the right place."</TE>
<TE>   During a Labor Day visit to President Nixon's childhood home in
Yorba Linda, Simon knelt down to talk to Aimee Sanchez, 7, and her
sister Andrea, 5.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you know whose house this was?" Simon asked. Shyly, the girls
shook their heads.</TE>
<TE>   "A fellow named Nixon. He was the president," he told the sisters
reverentially. "Someday, maybe, you'll be president of the United
States. You can be anybody you want to be, if you work hard." The
girls stared at him blankly.</TE>
<TE>   Later, he stopped by a group of square-dancers circling around the
foyer of the Nixon Library.</TE>
<TE>   "Do si do!" he called out. "Honey, I told them you can
square-dance," he said, turning to Cindy.</TE>
<TE>   "You dance like a square," she retorted.</TE>
<TE>   But the candidate decided they should give it a try. Grinning
widely, he shuffled awkwardly among the dancers, occasionally bumping
into his wife.</TE>
<TE>   Their daughter Lulu watched from the sidelines, shaking her head.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh my God," she said, with the embarrassment only a 12-year-old
can muster.</TE>

<HD>Up in Arms on Plans for War</HD>
<DH>March: Westwood rally, one of numerous protests held across
the country, draws thousands opposed to a U.S. attack against Iraq.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEE ROMNEY and DANIEL HERNANDEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thousands of protesters opposed to a war in Iraq converged on the
Federal Building in Westwood on Sunday as part of a coordinated
national effort that stretched from New York City's Central Park to
San Francisco's Union Square and spots in at least a dozen other
cities.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles County Sheriff's Lt. Pat Jordan estimated the crowd at
about 3,000, but a California Highway Patrol officer overseeing the
peaceful rally and march put the number at "well above" the group's
permit--for 3,500.</LD>
<LD>   The rallies, pulled together by an umbrella group called the Not
in Our Name project, were timed to coincide with the eve of the
one-year anniversary of the start of bombing in Afghanistan</LD>
<TE>   Polls have generally shown support for the Bush administration's
actions since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, and for a war on Iraq
with allied and United Nations support.</TE>
<TE>   Central Park's event, where actor Martin Sheen spoke, drew
thousands; San Francisco's also drew thousands; and a Chicago
demonstration attracted more than 1,000. On Saturday, a companion
rally in Portland, Ore., drew an estimated 5,000.</TE>
<TE>   Gathering on the broad lawn of the Federal Building and stretching
along Wilshire Boulevard, protesters toted signs that included "Don't
Invade Iraq" and "No, It's Not Iraq. It's the Economy. We're not
Stupid." Protesters said they hoped to send a strong message to
Congress and fellow Americans that opposition to a war is alive, and
that expressing it is a form of patriotism.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd was packed with the regulars of progressive rallies:
tattooed students pounding drums, Green Party activists promoting
their candidates and the more radical Revolutionary Communist
Progressive Labor Party distributing newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   But the rally also drew first-time demonstrators who said that
they were deeply concerned about the implications of a war and felt
that their voice has not been heard. President Bush is expected to
make his case for a war on Iraq, which he says has developed weapons
of mass destruction, in a televised speech tonight.</TE>
<TE>   In his weekend radio address, Bush urged Congress to give him
authority to move swiftly against Saddam Hussein. Later, while
stumping in Manchester, N.H., for Senate candidate John Sununu, Bush
didn't mention the 50 anti-war demonstrators outside or the
gatherings around the country. But he reiterated his stance that the
United States must disarm Iraq to protect American lives.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been long overdue, for people to come together and voice
their opinion," said Michael Collins, 35, a health insurance
administrator from Westwood who attended the rally with his
daughters, Chris, 9, and Cami, 6. "If we go into Iraq, it's going to
give other countries a reason to side against us.... Why not stand up
now and say something?"</TE>
<TE>   Not in Our Name was born out of a meeting in March in New York.
Since then, nearly 20,000 artists, intellectuals and musicians have
signed a "statement of conscience" against the Bush administration's
resolve to wage war on Iraq, "a country which has no connection to
the horror of Sept. 11." The statement also decries the Patriot Act,
which gave the government greater latitude to curtail civil liberties
in the name of the war on terror.</TE>
<TE>   The lengthy list of signatories on the statement, which was
published in full-page advertisements in the New York Times and Los
Angeles Times, include actor Edward Asner; writers Barbara
Kingsolver, Eve Ensler, Tony Kushner and Alice Walker; musician Steve
Earle; performance artist Laurie Anderson; and language theorist Noam
Chomsky.</TE>
<TE>   At the events across the country Sunday, demonstrators recited a
"Pledge of Resistance" against war, roundups of immigrants and
infringements of civil liberties.</TE>
<TE>   Collins, who is not affiliated with any activist organization, saw
the ad Friday, visited the group's Web site and learned of the rally.
He then photocopied 200 copies of the event announcement and
distributed them to strangers in Westwood.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really terrified that democracy is going to suffer," he said
as he cradled his youngest daughter. "I'm doing it for the kids."</TE>
<TE>   Echoed Rae Wilken, 76, of Canoga Park: "When you have
grandchildren you realize how precious life really is, and it becomes
unimaginable that we would throw bombs at people."</TE>
<TE>   Sabrina Judge, who attended the rally with her husband and
parents, said that in the mix of "fringe" fliers, she was handed a
list of every member of Congress, along with their phone numbers and
e-mail addresses.</TE>
<TE>   "This is something I can go home and use," she said.</TE>
<TE>   A recent Washington Post-ABC poll showed that three in five
Americans favored using force to get rid of Hussein. But 47% opposed
such a move without the support of U.S. allies (46% approved it), and
52% of those polled said they feared Bush would move too quickly to
challenge Hussein. Other polls have reflected greater dissent.</TE>
<TE>   Many Democratic members of Congress have said that calls, letters
and e-mails from constituents have overwhelmingly opposed a war. For
example, an aide for Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) has said that
the senator has received about 15,000 phone calls and 3,500 letters
on the Iraq issue, with the overwhelming majority against a
unilateral, preemptive U.S. strike.</TE>
<TE>   Organizers drew on a network of labor, religious, student and
other activist organizations. Among the speakers was Ron Kovic, the
wheelchair-bound Vietnam veteran who wrote the book "Born on the
Fourth of July" and has become an outspoken peace activist.</TE>
<TE>   "We are sick and tired of being told we're unpatriotic," Kovic
said to cheers, seated on a stage beneath an inflated globe wrapped
in a yellow "Not In Our Name" banner that resembled crime-scene tape.
"Let it sink in, President Bush: We care so much about this country
that we know democracy is being threatened and we are not going to
let it happen."</TE>
<TE>   Steve Boise, 43, wore a hard hat emblazoned with the U.S. flag and
the name of his union local to let people know that "blue-collar
America is talking about this at work."</TE>
<TE>   Boise, a pipe fitter at the Shell Oil refinery in Wilmington, said
he and his co-workers have spent hours discussing a potential war in
Iraq and have decided "it's all about controlling oil in the Caspian
Sea.... This just doesn't make any sense to us."</TE>
<TE>   The rally was his first, but Boise said he attended because "it
feels like our views aren't being expressed.... I don't understand
the doublespeak," he said. "Patriotic now means, 'Sit down and shut
up.' "</TE>

<HD>Up to Old Tricks</HD>
<DH>Angels may play out-of-fashion style, but it looks good on
them</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Angels have stumbled through the baseball desert for four
decades, thirsty for some sort of identity. Gene Autry's team.
Disney's team. The team with the Big A framing the scoreboard. The
team with the rock pile in center field. The team that let Nolan Ryan
go. The team in the shadow of the Dodgers.</LD>
<LD>   But for all the slogans the marketing guys can think up and for
all the curses, hexes and jinxes the die-hard fans can think up, the
men wearing the uniforms this year might have provided the franchise
with a long-lasting identity, a style of play that lends itself to
such adjectives as "scrappy" and "plucky."</LD>
<LD>   To most teams, such words are condescending. Call these Angels by
those terms, and they'll thank you for the compliment.</LD>
<TE>   For so many years, "The Dodger Way to Play Baseball" was a
bestseller at the Dodger Stadium souvenir stands. This year, the
Angels are writing their own success story. Another chapter begins
Tuesday, when the Angels play the Minnesota Twins in the first game
of the best-of-seven American League championship series.</TE>
<TE>   "We are developing an Angel way of playing baseball," bench coach
Joe Maddon said. "We're developing an attitude and a style. That is
very important for us to capture and maintain. It's something that
can sustain itself.</TE>
<TE>   "We may not win every year, but we can contend every year, based
on the method of play we have kind of invented for ourselves this
year."</TE>
<TE>   The Oakland Athletics popularized another brand of baseball, one
in which walks and home runs are emphasized and sacrifice bunts and
stolen bases are disdained, because they cost precious outs.</TE>
<TE>   The A's won 103 games this season and qualified for the playoffs
for the third consecutive season, but they will not be participating
in the championship series. The Angels will, with a "small ball"
style ridiculed by the new breed of statistical analysts.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels emphasize putting the ball in play, fouling pitches off
to exhaust pitchers, stealing bases and executing hit-and-run plays,
risking outs with aggressive baserunning and giving up outs in order
to advance runners via bunt or ground ball.</TE>
<TE>   This is old-fashioned baseball, playing for one run at a time, a
pitching-first strategy in an offense-first era. This, the Angels
decided, would be their best chance for success, for a team built
upon a foundation of starting pitching.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a point we stressed in spring training," center fielder
Darin Erstad said. "The odds are not in our favor to knock out three
or four hits in a row off the pitching in our division. We've got
good pitchers, so how do we get them a lead?"</TE>
<TE>   In that sense, while left fielder Garret Anderson was the Angels'
lone All-Star, shortstop David Eckstein might be the Angels' most
valuable player. He led the league in sacrifice bunts and times hit
by a pitch. He walked more times than he struck out. He grounded into
a double play once a month.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the RAM in our hard drive," Maddon said.</TE>
<TE>   So, when he saw Benji Gil get the sign to steal Saturday, he knew
that Yankee second baseman Alfonso Soriano would be moving to cover
second base. Eckstein poked the pitch through the hole vacated by
Soriano, and Gil sped to third.</TE>
<TE>   Erstad then singled home Gil, breaking a 2-2 tie. The Angels got
six more runs in the inning. The Yankees were dazed and confused,
their season terminated in the first round of the playoffs because
Eckstein spied an opening.</TE>
<TE>   "On a daily basis, he's probably the smartest player on the field,
including both coaching staffs," Maddon said. "He sees everything.
There's nothing you can say to him in the game that he hasn't already
seen for himself.</TE>
<TE>   "The guy is just dripping with intangibles. It rubs off on
everybody else."</TE>
<TE>   Yankee Manager Joe Torre admitted the Angels' baserunning exploits
forced him to sacrifice offense and start strong-armed rookie Juan
Rivera in left field. Still, in Game 2, Garret Anderson tagged up
from first base and took second on a fly ball to left. Shawn Wooten,
not the lightest guy on the field, hustled from first base to third
on a single to center.</TE>
<TE>   The fifth inning of Game 1 of the division series, the one game
the Angels lost, was a work of art, one that hitting coaches will
discuss at clinics for years to come. The Angels scored two runs, but
they forced Roger Clemens to make 38 pitches in the inning.</TE>
<TE>   With one out, Adam Kennedy forced Clemens to throw eight pitches
and drew a walk. The Yankees pitched out, and guessed correctly that
Kennedy would be running, but Eckstein refused to concede the throw
to second base. He threw his bat at the ball, way outside of the
strike zone, and the bat hit enough of the ball to foul it off. The
Angels put the hit-and-run on again, and this time Eckstein singled
Kennedy to third.</TE>
<TE>   Erstad struck out, but Tim Salmon forced Clemens to throw eight
more pitches and also drew a walk. Anderson then poked an outside
pitch into left field, rather than trying to pull it, for a double
that scored Kennedy and Eckstein.</TE>
<TE>   If the Angels did not win, perhaps players would not buy into this
system and would start swinging for the fences and striking out in
reckless numbers. But the Angels had not won a playoff spot in 16
years, so Erstad, the team leader, found little resistance to
enforcing a system that does not enhance individual statistics.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to put our egos in our back pocket," he said. "If you
don't do that, you'll stick out like a sore thumb in here, so you
really don't have a choice."</TE>

<KH>ANGEL NOTES</KH>
<HD>Their Best Trade Was One They Didn't Make</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dodgers said yes. The Angels said no, a decision for which they
give thanks daily.</LD>
<LD>   In July, with the Dodgers and Angels in search of a hard-throwing
reliever, the Cleveland Indians offered Paul Shuey, but only in
exchange for two top prospects. The Dodgers said yes, and Shuey was
theirs.</LD>
<LD>   That proverb about the best trades being the ones not made? The
role the Angels envisioned for Shuey now has been filled by wonder
child Francisco Rodriguez, the newest hero in Anaheim.</LD>
<TE>   Rodriguez, 20, got a standing ovation Saturday, an hour before the
game against the Yankees started. As he walked down the left-field
line, doing his rookie duty of carrying bubble gum and sunflower
seeds from the clubhouse to the bullpen, the fans rose and cheered as
he passed.</TE>
<TE>   In three weeks in the major leagues, the records have come as
easily as the strikeouts. In his first week, he tied Nolan Ryan's
franchise record of eight consecutive strikeouts. In his first two
playoff games, he was the winning pitcher, becoming the first player
in major league history to record his first two victories in
postseason play. He also joined Fernando Valenzuela as the only
pitchers to earn two postseason victories before age 21; Valenzuela
did it for the Dodgers' 1981 World Series champions.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez pitched 5 2/3 innings in the Angels' first-round victory
over the New York Yankees, more than any teammate except Jarrod
Washburn, and his eight strikeouts led the staff.</TE>
<TE>   During Rodriguez' stint at triple-A Salt Lake this summer,
Edmonton coach Phil Roof, a former major league catcher, took a look
at his combination of a 95-mph fastball and an 83-mph slider and told
the Edmonton Sun, "He's got some of the best stuff coming out of the
bullpen I've seen in 20 years."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels fairly drool about Rodriguez setting up--and eventually
replacing--closer Troy Percival. But Percival is signed through 2004,
so there is no hurry for Rodriguez.</TE>
<TE>   "He definitely has the ability to eventually become a closer--I
think a dominant closer," Manager Mike Scioscia said. "Right now,
obviously, we have the leeway not to rush him. We have a pretty good
closer ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   That closer has an amazing record against the Minnesota Twins, the
Angels' opponent in the league championship series. In 20 career
games against the Twins, Percival hasn't given up an earned run.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As the wild-card entry into the American League playoffs, the
Angels are not allowed home-field advantage. So, although they had a
better regular-season record than Minnesota, they must open the
playoffs in the Metrodome.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels will play at home Friday, Saturday and, if necessary,
Sunday. A small number of tickets--single and obstructed-view
seats--remain available, spokesman Tim Mead said.</TE>
<TE>   If the Angels advance to the World Series, they will enjoy
home-field advantage. In the World Series, home-field advantage is
rotated between leagues, and this year that advantage belongs to the
American League champion.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels deferred any announcement about their starting rotation
for this series. Kevin Appier is scheduled to start Tuesday's opener.
After Washburn struggled on three days' rest Saturday, the Angels are
hesitant to try him on three days' rest again Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   They would have to think twice about starting the excitable Ramon
Ortiz, who gave up the most home runs of any major league pitcher, in
an extraordinarily loud domed stadium nicknamed the Homerdome. Rookie
John Lackey also would be available, but the Angels also could
consider adding veteran Aaron Sele to the roster. In his career
against Minnesota, Sele is 15-3 with a 2.84 earned-run average.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As the Angels whooped it up in Texas, celebrating after they
clinched their first playoff berth in 16 years, Gary DiSarcina was
sitting in a sociology class in Massachusetts. His cell phone kept
vibrating, and he suddenly became concerned that an emergency had
befallen his children.</TE>
<TE>   His children were fine, and so were his old teammates. Darin
Erstad had called, and so had Percival, and Tim Salmon. DiSarcina had
toiled for the Angels for a decade before retiring this season, and
the veterans wanted to make sure that their old shortstop and team
leader could share in the celebration, at least via long distance.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a pretty selfless act," DiSarcina said. "It was very
appreciated."</TE>
<TE>   DiSarcina, 34, returned to Edison Field Saturday to throw out the
ceremonial first pitch, and Percival insisted on catching it. After
the game, he joined the Angels in the clubhouse, getting champagne
sprayed all over his shirt and slacks.</TE>
<TE>   DiSarcina enjoys retirement, golfing, spending the summer with his
family and finishing his degree at the University of Massachusetts.
There were no bittersweet feelings, he said, about missing out on
that elusive playoff berth.</TE>
<TE>   "I always tried to imagine what the playoffs would be like here,"
he said. "The only thing I couldn't have imagined would be all this
red. It reminds me of a football game and a tailgate party all in
one.</TE>
<TE>   "It's great to see all the excitement. I knew this city had it in
them. We just didn't give them a good product."</TE>

<DH>Baseball: Twins, targeted for elimination last winter,
instead eliminate A's in Game 5 and qualify to face Angels in ALCS.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>They were no-names in 1999, ridiculed as a bunch of double-A and
triple-A players masquerading as big leaguers, baseball's poster
children for why the sport couldn't survive in a small market with a
horrible stadium and fading fan base.</LD>
<LD>   They took their lumps, losing 97 games in 1999 and 93 games in
2000, and matured into legitimate contenders in 2001, only to be put
on Commissioner Bud Selig's contraction hit list last winter.</LD>
<LD>   Now look at the Minnesota Twins: They're still no-names, but
they'll provide the opponent for the Angels in the American League
championship series after completing a stunning upset of the Oakland
Athletics Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   Catcher A.J. Pierzynski's two-run home run broke open a tight game
in the top of the ninth, and closer Eddie Guardado survived a tense
and turbulent bottom of the ninth, and the Twins held off the A's,
5-4, in the decisive Game 5 of the AL division series before 32,146
in Network Associates Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   The Twins, overcome by equal parts relief and jubilation,
dog-piled Guardado on the mound and then took their raucous
celebration to the visiting clubhouse, where, amid popping corks and
champagne showers, there seemed to be an underlying message to the
commissioner: Hey Bud, let's party.</TE>
<TE>   "Just turn on the television and watch the team you tried to get
rid of," Twin left fielder Jacque Jones said when asked what he'd say
to Selig. "You can't get rid of the Twins. Selig tried it. The A's
were up, 2-1, in the series, and they tried it. We just never quit,
and now we're one step away from the World Series."</TE>
<TE>   They were one step away from tripping and falling flat on their
faces Sunday. Pierzynski followed Dustan Mohr's leadoff walk in the
ninth with a two-run homer to right field off Oakland closer Billy
Koch, his first homer since the day before the All-Star break, to
turn a 2-1 lead into a 4-1 lead, and Cristian Guzman's single and
stolen base and David Ortiz's two-out RBI double made it 5-1.</TE>
<TE>   But Guardado, the Minnesota left-hander, gave up two hits and a
three-run home run to Mark Ellis that made it 5-4, and the A's seemed
on the verge of the kind of magical comeback that marked their
20-game win streak in August and September.</TE>
<TE>   Guardado got Terrence Long to fly to center for the second out,
but Randy Velarde singled to center. Greg Myers, who entered the game
as a catcher in the top of the ninth, came to the plate before A's
Manager Art Howe and several coaches realized Ray Durham, and not
Myers, should be hitting.</TE>
<TE>   Durham then lifted a high foul ball well beyond the first base
bag, but second baseman Denny Hocking ranged over to make the catch,
sealing Minnesota's first trip to the championship series since 1991.</TE>
<TE>   "A.J.'s home run stuck a dagger in them," Twin center fielder
Torii Hunter said. "But man, Ellis' home run almost gave me a heart
attack."</TE>
<TE>   The best-of-seven AL championship series, which opens Tuesday
night in the Metrodome, probably is causing a few palpitations over
at the network office. No New York Yankees, the glamour team from the
media capital of the world. No Oakland Athletics, the upstarts with
the three great young pitchers and MVP-candidate shortstop. And no
great subplot of Yankee first baseman Jason Giambi facing his old
teammates.</TE>
<TE>   "I tell you what, it's TV's worst nightmare, the Twins against the
Angels," Hocking said.</TE>
<TE>   Get over it, say the Twins.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the country wants to see two low-budget teams win,"
Hunter said. "Everyone I talk to is tired of the Yankees--I'm tired
of them--they've got the salary, the big names, and they can play.
We're just making minimum wage, but we're doing the job."</TE>
<TE>   The combined payrolls of the Angels ($62 million) and Twins ($40
million) don't come close to the Yankees' $135-million payroll, but
that doesn't mean it won't be an entertaining series.</TE>
<TE>   The Twins and Angels are very similar--both teams are scrappy on
offense, fundamentally sound and aggressive on the basepaths. Their
starting pitching is solid, if not spectacular, their bullpens are
deep and their defenses sound.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the networks will be proud to have us and the Angels in
the ALCS," Twin Manager Ron Gardenhire said. "We're both teams that
get after it."</TE>
<TE>   And neither was expected to be here. It should be interesting to
see which team out-underdogs the other.</TE>
<TE>   "We're sick and tired of hearing we can't hit left-handed
pitching, we have no power, our pitching staff is unproven, we're too
young, we don't have this or that," Twin first baseman Doug
Mientkiewicz said. "All I know is we're moving on."</TE>
<TE>   The Twins are moving on because they got a superb start Sunday
from ace Brad Radke, who limited a potent A's lineup to one run and
six hits in 6 2/3 innings, striking out four and walking none.</TE>
<TE>   And because Hocking, making his first start of the postseason, hit
a clutch, two-out RBI single to center off A's left-hander Mark
Mulder in the second inning, and Matthew LeCroy followed Guzman's
double in the third with an RBI single to center.</TE>
<TE>   And because Radke, who allowed Durham's solo homer in the third,
seized momentum back from the A's in the fifth. Mulder, starting on
three days' rest, got out of a second-and-third, one-out jam in the
fourth and struck out the side in the fifth, and the A's started to
rumble when Ellis opened the bottom of the fifth with a single.</TE>
<TE>   But Radke got Long to fly to left and Ramon Hernandez to ground
into a 5-4-3 double play, quieting the A's and their fans, and the
Twins held on in the ninth, sending Oakland to its third consecutive
division series Game 5 loss.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, back in Milwaukee, a certain baseball commissioner
couldn't help but take notice of the Twins.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm delighted for them," Selig told the Associated Press Sunday
afternoon. "It's a great story, just because of the way they're
playing. I'm enjoying watching them. The rest of it, the history of
what happened before, it's in the past now."</TE>
<TE>   For Selig, yes, but not for the Twins, who continue to use the
commissioner's plan to eliminate them last winter as a motivational
tool, and who seem to have a similar reaction every time Selig's name
comes up during their postseason run:</TE>
<TE>   Contract this.</TE>

<HD>Giants Live on Another Day</HD>
<DH>NL playoffs: Hernandez shuts down the Braves to force
decisive Game 5 with 8-3 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>The Atlanta Braves need to figure out what's wrong with Tom Glavine,
who hasn't pitched this poorly in October since, well, ever.</LD>
<LD>   At the moment, though, they have more pressing
concerns--outlasting the resilient San Francisco Giants chief among
them.</LD>
<LD>   The Giants pounded Glavine again and staved off elimination Sunday
in Game 4 of the National League division series with an 8-3 victory
at Pacific Bell Park.</LD>
<TE>   A raucous sellout crowd of 43,070, the largest in the ballpark's
three-year history, watched the Giants win their first postseason
game while facing elimination since the 1962 World Series, venting
their frustration in blowing out Glavine and the Braves.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants pounded the two-time Cy Young Award winner for the
second time in as many starts this series, chasing him after only 2
2/3 innings in his second-shortest playoff appearance, and got more
than they needed from Livan Hernandez.</TE>
<TE>   The right-hander continued his postseason dominance of the Braves,
pitching 8 1/3 strong innings and departing to a standing ovation,
helping the Giants force a decisive Game 5 tonight at Turner Field in
Atlanta. "Livan was just on his game and you could tell he wanted
it," Giant Manager Dusty Baker said. "He knows we needed it, and he
enhanced his reputation as a big-game pitcher."</TE>
<TE>   As a 22-year-old rookie with the Florida Marlins in 1997,
Hernandez tied the league championship series record with 15
strikeouts in a 2-1 victory over the Braves. Hernandez was good
against them again Sunday, giving up eight hits and three runs.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez overcame early command problems, escaping a bases-loaded
jam in the second when Glavine struck out, and didn't give up a hit
until the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   He threw 76 strikes in 117 pitches, striking out six with two
walks.</TE>
<TE>   Removed with one out and a runner on first in the ninth,
Hernandez, who struggled this season, spun around while waving his
cap to the crowd in appreciation. Then he was mobbed by teammates
eager for another road game.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried to not put pressure on myself," said Hernandez, 6-0 in
seven postseason appearances. "I know it's a big game. I tried to
stay in the game longer, and this happened today."</TE>
<TE>   The Giants' staying power has given the Braves a lot to think
about.</TE>
<TE>   "The Giants are a pretty good ballclub," Atlanta first baseman
Julio Franco said. "They've got a good pitching staff, a good
defense, and a lot of great players over there, that's why they're
here. You've got to respect them, and we know we've got to beat
them."</TE>
<TE>   How bad was Glavine on Sunday? Much worse than in his first start,
which tells the whole frustrating story for the Braves. He worked
only five innings during an 8-5 loss in Game 1, giving up 10 hits and
six earned runs in one of his worst playoff performances, but was
hurt by several broken-bat bloopers.</TE>
<TE>   That wasn't the case Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants hit line drives throughout Glavine's shortest playoff
appearance since lasting only 2 1/3 innings against the St. Louis
Cardinals in the 2000 division series.</TE>
<TE>   He gave up seven hits and seven runs, increased his earned-run
average to 15.26 against the Giants, and lost his second game.</TE>
<TE>   Rich Aurilia hit a two-out, three-run home run in the third to
give the Giants a 7-0 lead, sending Glavine to the dugout and
searching for answers.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a combination of bad pitching and bad luck, I guess,"
Glavine said. "I made a couple of decent pitches and got bad results
on it, and obviously made some bad pitches and got real bad results
on 'em.</TE>
<TE>   "Other than that, I really don't know what to tell you. I feel
good. I feel like I'm throwing the ball well. I'm just not executing
and getting the results I want."</TE>
<TE>   Glavine, working on three days' rest, did not use fatigue as an
excuse.</TE>
<TE>   "Believe me, I wish I could tell you there was a reason why I've
pitched as poorly as I have this series, but I can't," he said.
"Physically, I feel as good now as I have at any point during the
year, so the short rest has nothing to do with it. Obviously,
something's not right, and I feel badly I've put our team in this
position."</TE>
<TE>   The Giants appreciate the help.</TE>

<HD>Sheffield's Still Waiting</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Gary Sheffield is getting frustrated.</LD>
<LD>   The San Francisco Giants are pitching around the Atlanta right
fielder, who is batting .071 in the National League division series,
and patience isn't among his attributes.</LD>
<LD>   "The thing is, when I try to change my game plan and make 'em
throw me strikes, you don't get a call on a 3-and-2 count," said
Sheffield, hitless in four at-bats in Sunday's 8-3 loss in Game 4 at
Pacific Bell Park. "I'm just going to have to start swinging away and
hope that something hap- pens."</LD>
<TE>   He has contributed in the series, hitting a solo home run in Game
1 and walking three times in Game 3, but Sheffield expects more of
himself. The Braves are hoping for a big performance from him in
tonight's decisive Game 5 at Turner Field.</TE>
<TE>   "The key to it is for us to get a lot of guys on base, like [in
Game 3], when they had to pitch to certain guys," he said. "Right
now, when guys are not on base, they're not going to pitch to certain
guys, especially when they have the lead.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, we can get a lot of guys on and get 'em in. That's the
key."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Russ Ortiz, scheduled to start tonight, won Game 1 for the Giants
at Turner Field and enjoys pitching on the road. The right-hander
worked seven solid innings in his last start, provid- ing an
additional confidence boost.</TE>
<TE>   "You definitely draw from that," said Ortiz, who had a 3.77 road
earned-run average during the season. "That's very important,
especially in a place like Atlanta during this time of the year."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta right-hander Kevin Millwood, who won Game 2, returned home
Sunday morning in advance of tonight's start. He will be working on
three days' rest.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Giants are trying to become the first NL team in the history
of the division series to advance to the championship series after
trailing, 2-1.</TE>
<TE>   Six AL teams have accomplished the feat.</TE>

<HD>Broncos Make Chargers Say Ow</HD>
<DH>Pro football: Denver wins, 26-9, taking advantage of a
defense missing a certain All-Pro linebacker.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>A little humiliation goes a long way.</LD>
<LD>   Just ask the Denver Broncos, whose 26-9 victory Sunday over the
previously unbeaten San Diego Chargers came six days after a shameful
loss at Baltimore, one that left the men in orange awfully red in the
face.</LD>
<LD>   "We just wanted to come out here and get our swagger back," said
Denver's Sam Brandon, whose blocked punt resulted in a safety. "Come
out and make plays like we usually do."</LD>
<TE>   The Broncos and Chargers are 4-1, a half-game behind AFC West
rival Oakland (4-0), the league's only undefeated team.</TE>
<TE>   Denver quarterback Brian Griese, who had three passes intercepted
at Baltimore, rebounded against the Chargers by completing 74% of his
passes for 316 yards with two touchdowns--one coming on Denver's
second play of the game, when Ed McCaffrey turned a short slant into
a 69-yard score.</TE>
<TE>   Griese has thrown touchdown passes in 20 consecutive games, the
longest active streak in the NFL. At one point in the first half, he
completed 13 passes in a row, breaking the string only when he spiked
the ball to stop the clock.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as Griese keeps throwing the ball like he is and we keep
catching it," tight end Shannon Sharpe said, "the sky's the limit for
this offense."</TE>
<TE>   Conspicuously absent from San Diego's defense was All-Pro
linebacker Junior Seau, who watched in street clothes with a sprained
left ankle. It was only the sixth game he has missed in his 13-year
career. Teammate Marcellus Wiley, a standout defensive end, missed
much of the second half because of a groin injury.</TE>
<TE>   Donnie Edwards, San Diego's veteran linebacker, was flanked by
rookie Ben Leber and first-time starter Zeke Moreno, who was filling
in for Seau.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt confident out there," said Moreno, in his second season
out of USC. "Every game I get butterflies, but that just shows you
you're alive."</TE>
<TE>   No need to check the pulse of Denver's defense. The Broncos (3-2)
limited San Diego's top-ranked rushing offense to 79 yards--101 shy
of its average--partly because the Chargers gave up on the run after
falling behind by 19 at halftime. LaDainian Tomlinson, who ran for
217 yards against New England last week and entered the weekend as
the league's leading rusher, carried the ball once in the second
half. He finished with 14 carries for 48 yards.</TE>
<TE>   It was a strong first step for the Denver defense in a three-week
run against top running backs. Next up: Miami's Ricky Williams,
followed by Kansas City's Priest Holmes.</TE>
<TE>   Linebacker John Mobley said the Broncos were surprised that
Charger Coach Marty Schottenheimer "abandoned the run that soon."</TE>
<TE>   But we're talking Schottenheimer, not Steve Spurrier, so things
never got too crazy. Early in the third quarter when the Chargers
were behind, 19-0, for instance, they opted to kick a 24-yard field
goal rather than go for it on fourth and one at the Denver six.</TE>
<TE>   By cutting the lead to 16, Schottenheimer reasoned, his team could
still forge a tie with two touchdowns and two-point conversions.
That's assuming San Diego's offense would get on track, which it
never did.</TE>
<TE>   "We just felt like we had to come out and prove the character of
this football team," Denver linebacker Al Wilson said. "We wanted to
show our fans around the country that Monday night's team is not who
we are."</TE>
<TE>   The player most ready to wash away the bitter taste of the
Baltimore game was cornerback Deltha O'Neal, who was flagged for pass
interference in the second quarter against the Ravens, intentionally
bumped an official while arguing that call and was ejected. The NFL
bumped back with a $15,000 fine.</TE>
<TE>   So O'Neal was understandably elated Sunday after making two
interceptions. On the first, the Chargers were on the Denver six
early in the second quarter, and O'Neal reeled in a pass intended for
tight end Stephen Alexander. O'Neal struck again in the fourth
quarter, picking off another Drew Brees pass and returning it 28
yards for a touchdown. Forever the showman, O'Neal finished off the
runback with a wide-legged waddle across the goal line. It was none
too pleasing to Denver Coach Mike Shanahan, who has come down on
O'Neal before for taunting.</TE>
<TE>   "It was big," Shanahan said of the touchdown, which gave Denver a
26-3 lead. "But until he put that ball safely into the end zone, I
was going to strangle him. It doesn't matter what you do once you get
in the end zone, but you need to act like you've been there."</TE>
<TE>   Hard to blame O'Neal for feeling so free. A week ago, he and Doug
West, the team's equipment manager, were sitting in an otherwise
empty visitors' locker room in Baltimore, watching on TV as the
Ravens rolled up 31 points in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "It felt like punishment," O'Neal said of his stint in that
spacious penalty box. "It felt like you were incarcerated or
something.... Especially seeing the team go down the way we were
going down, all the plays, all the mistakes we were making. It's hard
not to be out there fighting with them. It's hard to explain that
feeling, but I would never in my life want to do it again."</TE>
<TE>   So when he made his way to the end zone Sunday, he couldn't help
but dance. His explanation? "My mind went blank and my legs took
over."</TE>

<KH>BALTIMORE 26, CLEVELAND 21</KH>
<HD>Ravens Lose Lewis, but Hang On to Win</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CLEVELAND</DL>
<LD>Ray Lewis couldn't do anything but watch--and wince--as the Cleveland
Browns rallied.</LD>
<LD>   For the second time in six days, Lewis made a national TV game his
own prime-time special as the Baltimore Ravens built a big lead and
held on for a 26-21 victory Sunday night.</LD>
<LD>   But when his teammates needed their star linebacker the most,
Lewis couldn't help them. He hurt his left shoulder late in the third
quarter and did not return.</LD>
<TE>   "I was cheering on the sideline," Lewis said. "I banged it bad,
and you know me, I want to play. But coach said we have a long
season, and to take a seat."</TE>
<TE>   Before he left, Lewis had an interception, forced a fumble that he
recovered and made four tackles.</TE>
<TE>   When he was injured, the Browns (2-3) trailed, 23-0, but with
starting quarterback Tim Couch sitting dazed on the bench because of
a concussion, Cleveland rallied behind Kelly Holcomb.</TE>
<TE>   After recovering an on-side kick, the Browns drove to the
Baltimore 17 in the final minute, but Holcomb's last pass was picked
off by safety Ed Reed.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess I saved the best for last," Reed said. "We weren't going
to give up because we lost Ray. Ray's the guy that has taught us that
you go all-out no matter what."</TE>
<TE>   Following the game, Couch, who was booed by Brown fans before
getting hurt, broke down while firing back at his critics.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been here four years now, and laid it on the line for this
team and city," Couch said, his eyes filled with tears. "For them to
turn on me and boo me in my home stadium is a joke. It's hard to
take, man."</TE>
<TE>   Brandon Stokley caught two touchdown passes from Chris Redman and
the Ravens (2-2)--who looked pitiful in their first two games this
season--moved into first place in the weak AFC North Division.</TE>

<HD>Defense, Johnson Are in the Zone</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>The Tampa Bay Buccaneers scored another defensive touchdown. No
surprise there.</LD>
<LD>   Keyshawn Johnson reached the end zone. That was out of character.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson had a 76-yard reception for his first touchdown of the
season, then Derrick Brooks scored off an amazing lateral by Warren
Sapp to clinch a 20-6 victory over the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   For good measure, the Buccaneers knocked Michael Vick out of the
game.</TE>
<TE>   "We have some deadly bullets on this team," said Sapp, who was at
his trash-talking, showboating best. "Coach says there should be an
investigation, 'cause it looks like there are 12 of us out there."</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay (4-1) has given up only 27 points in winning four
consecutive games, and the defense hasn't given up a touchdown on the
road all season.</TE>
<TE>   The Falcons (1-3) never got closer than the Buccaneer 14-yard
line.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay is doing more than just stopping the other team. For the
fourth week in a row, the defense scored a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Sapp, of course, was right in the middle of things. He taunted the
Georgia Dome sellout crowd during a timeout, walking along the line
of scrimmage flapping his arms.</TE>
<TE>   On the next play, Falcon backup quarterback Doug Johnson was
sandwiched between Greg Spires and Simeon Rice as he threw, the ball
fluttering right into Sapp's arms at the Atlanta 15.</TE>
<TE>   Falcon lineman Todd Weiner grabbed Sapp from behind, but the big
defensive tackle flipped a lateral to Brooks in full stride. He raced
to the end zone with 6:19 to play, his third score of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Brooks has two more touchdowns than Keyshawn Johnson, who finally
scored with 4 1/2 minutes left in the third quarter to put the
Buccaneers ahead to stay at 10-6.</TE>
<TE>   He finished with six catches for 131 yards.</TE>
<TE>   The Buccaneers finished Vick early in the third. Sapp chased the
young quarterback out of the pocket, and Rice drove him to the turf.
Vick sprained his right (non-throwing) shoulder and didn't return.</TE>

<LD>The celebration--a slight jump before he ran off the field pumping
his fists--was a little bit muted by Bill Gramatica's standards.</LD>
<LD>   That's the way the Arizona Cardinals want it.</LD>
<LD>   Gramatica kicked a 50-yard field goal with 16 seconds left to lift
Arizona to a 16-13 victory over the Carolina Panthers on Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   After tearing a knee ligament last season while celebrating a
field goal, Gramatica toned down his joy.</TE>
<TE>   "The snap was perfect, the hold was perfect, I couldn't ask for
anything better," said Gramatica, who also made field goals of 41 and
28 yards. "It was just an unbelievable feeling, and when I jumped, I
made sure to land with both feet at the same time."</TE>
<TE>   Reminded the Cardinals don't want Gramatica jumping anymore, the
kicker shrugged. "I couldn't help it, I just jumped," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona improved to 3-2, its best start since it began 3-2 in
1991. "This is exactly what I envisioned 18 months ago when I started
putting these guys together," Arizona Coach Dave McGinnis said.
"We've got an open date and we're 3-2 and that's sweet, sweet,
sweet!"</TE>
<TE>   It was the second consecutive week a kicker stopped the Panthers
(3-2). Last week, Carolina's Shayne Graham missed a 24-yarder with 16
seconds left that could have sent the Panthers into overtime in their
17-14 loss to Green Bay. This time it was Gramatica--as well as four
Carolina turnovers, including two fumbles by running back Lamar
Smith.</TE>
<TE>   On Carolina's closing drive, Damien Anderson, a rookie activated
from the practice squad to fill in at running back, had a pair of
catch-and-runs for 12 yards, and Jake Plummer gained six yards on a
quarterback draw to get the ball to midfield and give Gramatica a
chance.</TE>
<TE>   Plummer completed 18 of 40 passes for 221 yards and one touchdown.
He threw one interception.</TE>
<TE>   Rodney Peete completed 20 of 34 for 196 yards and had two passes
intercepted. Smith had only 49 yards in 18 carries.</TE>

<KH>KANSAS CITY 29, N.Y. JETS 25</KH>
<HD>Holmes Carries the Chiefs Again</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Priest Holmes gave Kansas City yet another stellar fourth-quarter
finish.</LD>
<LD>   The running back caught a 19-yard touchdown pass from Trent Green
with 27 seconds left as the Chiefs beat the New York Jets, 29-25,
Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Holmes was unstoppable as a back and receiver.</LD>
<TE>   He ran for 152 yards and a touchdown against the league's
next-to-worst rushing defense, and also caught nine passes for 81
yards and the winning score.</TE>
<TE>   Holmes refused to talk after the game, so Green gushed instead.</TE>
<TE>   "What can't he do?" said Green, who went 23 for 33 for 296 yards
and two touchdowns. "'Teams are going to be focused on him as a
running back, so his ability to catch the ball is going to make him
that much more valuable."</TE>
<TE>   His value to the Chiefs has been immeasurable this season. While
the Jets focused on Tony Gonzalez throughout the game and limited him
to four receptions for 25 yards, Holmes dominated.</TE>
<TE>   On the winning drive, Holmes either ran the ball or had a
reception on six of the 10 plays.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to find a way to stop him," linebacker James Darling
said. "We just needed one more play at the end. If we make that play,
and make them kick a field goal, we go into overtime and you never
know what happens."</TE>
<TE>   The Chiefs (3-2) have thrived in the fourth quarter this season.
Against the Jets (1-4), the Chiefs scored 14 points in the final
quarter and have scored a league-leading 85 fourth-quarter points.</TE>
<TE>   They needed it Sunday to overcome two deficits.</TE>
<TE>   "The fourth quarter as been good to us all year," Kansas City
Coach Dick Vermeil said. "On that last drive, they went on the field
with confidence that they could score and it showed."</TE>
<TE>   With the game tied at 15 entering the fourth quarter, Chad
Pennington threw a 27-yard touchdown pass to Santana Moss to give the
Jets a 22-15 lead. It was Moss' first career touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   The Chiefs answered on their next possession, when Green threw a
60-yard touchdown pass to Dante Hall with 10:15 left to tie the game
at 22.</TE>
<TE>   John Hall kicked a 25-yard field goal with 2:54 remaining to give
the Jets a 25-22 lead, but Kansas City marched 78 yards in 10 plays
for the winning score.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Jets' Curtis Martin had his first 100-yard game of
the season, gaining 119 yards. Chad Pennington went 23 of 30 for 245
yards in his first career start, replacing the ineffective Vinny
Testaverde.</TE>

<KH>CLIPPER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Olowokandi Sidelined Too</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PALM DESERT</DL>
<LD>The Clippers had almost as many injured players as fit ones Sunday at
the College of the Desert.</LD>
<LD>   Center Michael Olowokandi was the latest to be sidelined,
suffering from what was termed a sore left knee. If you're scoring at
home, that makes nine sick or injured and 10 healthy Clippers.</LD>
<LD>   The Clippers play their first exhibition Tuesday against the
Lakers at Bakersfield. Free agents Jason Crowe, James Head and Jason
Lawson are expected to get plenty of playing time because Olowokandi,
forwards Elton Brand and Lamar Odom and guards Keyon Dooling and
Quentin Richardson are not available.</LD>
<TE>   "We've had bad karma, I guess," Coach Alvin Gentry said.</TE>
<TE>   In Olowokandi's case, it's more likely that Gentry's two-a-day
workout schedule in the first week of training camp has taken its
toll. Olowokandi was scheduled to have his knee examined Sunday night
as a precautionary measure.</TE>
<TE>   "He'll have an MRI and an X-ray, and we'll go from there," Gentry
said. "He's got some soreness in it. It's accumulated over the five
days we've been out here. We want to get it looked at."</TE>
<TE>   Brand probably won't be ready for the Oct. 30 opener against
Cleveland after undergoing arthroscopic surgery on his right knee
Sept. 26.</TE>
<TE>   Odom is expected to sit out at least two more months because of a
sprained right ankle.</TE>
<TE>   Richardson injured his knee while running Friday and is to be
reevaluated by the team's medical staff today.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers' initial estimate was that he would be out at least
two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Dooling is scheduled to have an MRI exam on his sprained right
ankle, but probably will not be ready to play for another three
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Batiste has swelling on his left knee, Melvin Ely has a foot
injury, and Chris Wilcox has a strained right quadriceps.</TE>
<TE>   Cherokee Parks has recovered sufficiently from what's now being
called strep throat to give the Clippers 10 fit players, just enough
to scrimmage.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no plans," Gentry said when asked about facing the Lakers
in the exhibition opener. "To me, it's still a preseason game. They
don't give out awards for preseason games. We'll approach it from the
standpoint of trying to learn something."</TE>
<TE>   Of the injured players, he added: "They're frustrated. They see
the potential of our team. One thing about this group of guys, I
don't think there's anybody who wants to be sitting out. They all
want to be playing right now."</TE>

<KH>INDIANAPOLIS 28, CINCINNATI 21</KH>
<HD>Bengals Don't Let Colts Get Away Easily</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Even with a recharged offense, the Indianapolis Colts were happy to
come away with a victory against the winless Bengals.</LD>
<LD>   Peyton Manning threw for two touchdowns and ran for another, and
Marvin Harrison caught nine passes for 145 yards, but the Colts still
needed a late interception to hold off Cincinnati, 28-21, Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "We feel fortunate to win today," Manning said.</LD>
<TE>   Indianapolis (3-1), which had an open date last week, posted its
second victory in a row thanks primarily to Manning and Harrison, who
again proved a potent combination. Manning completed 21 of 34 passes
for 224 yards, and Harrison, his favorite target, caught one
touchdown pass.</TE>
<TE>   Edgerrin James had a three-yard touchdown run early in the fourth
quarter, ending a 34-quarter scoreless drought that dated to Sept.
23, 2001. He gained 60 yards in 22 carries, the first time in 11 home
games that James had failed to break the 100-yard mark.</TE>
<TE>   The Bengals are 0-5 for the second time in three years, but they
were thrilled simply to keep a game close after getting outscored,
119-23, in their first four games.</TE>
<TE>   Jon Kitna completed 31 of 43 passes for 244 yards and guided
Cincinnati to three touchdown drives--two more than it had produced
all season.</TE>
<TE>   Corey Dillon also got going, running for 164 yards and two
touchdowns. "I just hope today gave some guys a little bit of hope,"
said Kitna. "We got our best player [Dillon] going today; that's
going to help us the rest of the season."</TE>
<TE>   Peter Warrick misplayed a punt that led to one Colt touchdown, and
Kitna's last interception deflected off Chad Johnson's hands on a
Cincinnati drive that could have tied the score in the closing
seconds.</TE>

<LD>A consumer's guide to the best and worst of sports media and
merchandise. Ground rules: If it can be read, heard, observed,
viewed, dialed or downloaded, it's in play here. One exception: No
products will be endorsed.</LD>
<LD>   What: Philadelphia Eagles Cheerleaders Lingerie Calendar 2002-2003</LD>
<LD>   Price: $12.99 for 16 months.</LD>
<TE>   When the calendar reached The Times, it seemed logical that a
former Keystone State resident should review the merchandise. Been a
season-ticket holder. Have seen countless Eagle cheerleaders. Didn't
know about the peephole in the wall of the Veterans Stadium locker
room until after moving west, so integrity is intact.</TE>
<TE>   The calendar begins in September 2002 and continues through
December 2003, giving the owner plenty of time to study the contents
before the Eagle coaching and cheerleading staffs find new bodies.</TE>
<TE>   Some highlights ... Sept. 2002: Holds a pillow just as a coach
would tell a halfback to hold a football. Won't fumble. Oct. 2002: No
Heisman Trophy pose, but gives new meaning to armchair quarterback.
Nov. 2002:  Looks like a candidate to lead Eagle pregame stretching
routine. Jan. 2003: This probably isn't how Donovan McNabb absorbs
the playbook. Feb. 2003: Dreaded bed check. Fortunately, no Eagles
present. March 2003: Those spikes must be for thick, natural turf.
June 2003: Like a star wide receiver, tried to cover her but couldn't
be done. July 2003: I believe this is a 15-yard penalty this season.
No removing equipment above the waist. August 2003: In defensive
football terms, Cover 2. Oct. 2003: Weather conditions starting to
get cold. Dec. 2003: The whole Christmas package.</TE>
<TE>   Sadly, after searching vigorously, reviewing each page and picture
over and over and over again, something is missing--the Eagles'
schedule. Guess the calendar just will have to serve as a reminder of
the heart-warming sights of home.</TE>

<KH>MIAMI 26, NEW ENGLAND 13</KH>
<HD>A Dolphin Greatest-Hits Package</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>Zach Thomas busted his chin strap tackling Kevin Faulk, one in a
series of jarring hits that helped the Miami Dolphins knock the New
England Patriots out of first place.</LD>
<LD>   The Dolphins sacked Tom Brady three times, pressured him into
mistakes, pounded the middle with Ricky Williams and handed the
Patriots their second loss in a row Sunday, 26-13.</LD>
<LD>   The victory left Miami (4-1) alone atop the AFC East. The
defending Super Bowl champion Patriots (3-2) fell a game back.</LD>
<TE>   "They have something we want," Dolphin cornerback Patrick Surtain
said. "We want to get where they were last year."</TE>
<TE>   Surtain led a resurgent defense that rebounded from a 48-30 loss
at Kansas City a week ago. Miami took a 16-0 lead in the first half,
when New England totaled only 26 yards and committed two turnovers,
and the Dolphins finished with a 20-minute advantage in time of
possession.</TE>
<TE>   Williams lost a fumble for the second week in a row but topped 100
yards rushing for the fourth time in five games. He gained 105 tough
yards in 36 carries, a team regular-season record.</TE>
<TE>   Jay Fiedler threw for two touchdowns and ran for another, all on
third down.</TE>
<TE>   "We were embarrassed last week with what happened," Miami Coach
Dave Wannstedt said. "To see our team bounce back in every phase was
rewarding."</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots fell to 0-13 in Miami in September and October. They
can take some consolation that Sunday's loss was similar to a 30-10
drubbing in Miami a year ago, when Brady threw for 86 yards. The
Patriots recovered from that defeat, their worst of the season, and
went on to win the Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   This time Brady passed for 240 yards, including touchdown throws
of 34 and 25 yards to David Patten. But much of his success came in
the final eight minutes against a defense that played much better
after giving up five touchdown passes to Kansas City's Trent Green a
week ago.</TE>
<TE>   "We made too many mistakes in the first half and dug ourselves a
hole," New England Coach Bill Belichick said.</TE>
<TE>   Surtain and end Jason Taylor, both of whom have been hobbled by
knee injuries, sparked Miami's defense. Taylor had two sacks and
forced a fumble by Brady to set up the game's first score, and
Surtain's interception led to the next score for a 13-0 lead.</TE>

<LD>   Do they keep veterans with lesser talent and let better younger
players learn in the minors? Do they toss those young players into
the NHL fire? What do you do with $6-million worth of unwanted
veterans?</LD>
<LD>   General Manager Bryan Murray and Coach Mike Babcock will answer
those questions today, as they make their final roster cuts.</LD>
<TE>   Injuries will determine some of those decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Defenseman Pavel Trnka (strained groin) skated Saturday for the
first time in nine days, but may open the season on injured reserve.
Defenseman Vitaly Vishnevski is bothered by a sore knee and is
day-to-day, leaving the Ducks with six healthy defensemen. That may
open a spot for Josh DeWolf, who was brought back from minor league
Cincinnati on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Left wing Kevin Sawyer also hurt his knee Saturday, although it
was not believed to be serious.</TE>
<TE>   Murray said that veterans Denny Lambert, German Titov and Jason
York would be assigned or cut loose today. The three, combined, are
still owed $6.6 million. All were passed over in Friday's NHL waiver
draft and their agents have yet to work out a deal.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that shows that everyone is pretty set with their
rosters," Murray said. "They won't play here."</TE>
<TE>   One or more could be assigned to minor league Cincinnati. But if
Sawyer's injury proves to be more serious, the Ducks may need to
bring in Lambert to fill the enforcer role.</TE>
<TE>   The odd man out would seem to be center Samuel Pahlsson, who was
exposed to last Friday's NHL waiver draft. While that doesn't
necessarily mean he is ticketed to the minor leagues, Pahlsson can
read between the lines.</TE>
<TE>   "They want to go with the young guys," Pahlsson said. "So I'm
going to the minors. All I can do is go and work hard."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   One thing is for certain, the Ducks will have a
less-than-traditional third line.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Cullen, the Ducks' second line center much of the last three
seasons, seems destined to anchor the team's third line this season.
The presence of free agent Adam Oates and a healthy Steve Rucchin
have made the Ducks stronger at center.</TE>
<TE>   Cullen's role may seem unsuited to his skills. He is coming off
his best season, finishing with career highs with 18 goals and 48
points. The challenge for Cullen is to continue that production on a
third line, which is traditionally a checking line.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to be more aware defensively and work on the checking,"
Cullen said. "But we could have a third line that will surprise teams
because we'll have more than two lines contributing offensively."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>We take 'em one game at a time.</LD>
<LD>   Our focus is on this week's opponent.</LD>
<LD>   We don't look ahead.</LD>
<TE>   Welcome to Liars Club, the carefully worded world of football
double talk.</TE>
<TE>   If Oklahoma wasn't looking ahead to this week's game with Texas,
how do you explain the Sooners almost losing at Missouri, a
journalism school, Bob Stoops' troops needing a trick play--touchdown
pass off a fake field-goal attempt--to stave off disaster?</TE>
<TE>   If Texas wasn't looking ahead to Saturday's showdown with Oklahoma
at the Cotton Bowl, possibly the most important step-up game the
program has faced in 30 years, how do you explain the Longhorns
having to thwart a two-point conversion and then needing a
game-saving interception to beat Oklahoma State, a team our
powderblue-clad UCLA lads had no trouble disassembling only a few
weeks ago in Stillwater?</TE>
<TE>   Or, perhaps the very sight of Oklahoma, even when it's followed by
"State" on a jersey, just freaks out Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma has shot Texas' national-title lights out in each of the
last two Red River Shootouts, but no one thought the Longhorns would
start gripping over Oklahoma during "The Star-Spangled Banner" at
Oklahoma State.</TE>
<TE>   Who knows what got into Oklahoma? Maybe, after they jumped out to
a comfortable lead, one of those cartoon bubbles formed over Sooner
heads with the image of them standing over the Longhorn mascot, Bevo,
with dinner knives, the steer divided in a delectable grid--top
sirloin, prime rib, UT-bone.</TE>
<TE>   In sports, it is impossible not to look ahead or underestimate an
allegedly unworthy opponent--it's the reason why college football is
wonderful and why scalpers station themselves outside stadiums.</TE>
<TE>   You can bet Washington Coach Rick Neuheisel warned his players
last week not to look past California and Washington players were
thinking, "Dude, loosen your load, those guys haven't beaten us since
1976."</TE>
<TE>   Some men put up convincing fronts.</TE>
<TE>   You get the idea Notre Dame first-year Coach Tyrone Willingham
wouldn't look past 7:30 if his wristwatch read 7:25.</TE>
<TE>   Pundits attribute Willingham's laser-beam focus and attention to
the task at hand as reasons for the Irish's first 5-0 start since
1993.</TE>
<TE>   "We just need to keep taking everything one game at a time,"
Willingham implored after Saturday's 31-7 win over Stanford. "We
didn't pay attention to the rankings this week and we will continue
not to do so."</TE>
<TE>   Looks good on a chalkboard, but if Willingham wasn't peeking down
the road at the possibilities, how come, after the Stanford game, he
took a playful dig at the Chicago Tribune's national columnist for
having Notre Dame No. 15 in his weekly rankings?</TE>
<TE>   No one is immune from skipping ahead to the next chapter, or
reading the fortune before eating the cookie, not even sportswriters.</TE>
<TE>   To be honest, the report filed Sunday from South Bend by yours
truly was less than satisfactory. In fact, a copy editor could have
intercepted one of my dangling participles and run it all the way
back to the back shop.</TE>
<TE>   They taught us in journalism school to write 'em one story at a
time, yet how could a man concentrate on Stanford-Notre Dame, a
mostly dreadful game interrupted by a seven-minute flurry of Irish
touchdowns, with a fantastic slate of games coming up next weekend?</TE>
<TE>   Next Saturday is next-to-Nirvana, with Texas-Oklahoma, Florida
State at Miami, Tennessee at Georgia, Oregon at UCLA and Penn State
at Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   It's almost too much to digest, really, but you know what your
coach would say:</TE>
<TE>   You've got to take 'em one game at a time.</TE>
<TE>   Weekend Wrap</TE>
<TE>   Rambling thoughts: There are no exceptional teams this year except
Miami, which won its 27th consecutive game Saturday. Any poll,
computer or otherwise, that has any team other than Miami at No. 1
ranks right below Enron on the credibility list. Other than Miami,
the most impressive-looking undefeated team through weekend play may
have been Virginia Tech, which had an open date.</TE>
<TE>   Texas and Oklahoma both played footsy with defeat. Ohio State
struggled at Northwestern, a team that lost to non-bowl championship
series-certified Air Force by almost 50 points. Georgia needed a
last-minute field goal to beat Alabama. Notre Dame's offense
generated one touchdown against Stanford, a school that ranked 112th
in scoring defense, allowing 41.7 points a game. Oregon (5-0) hasn't
beaten a quality opponent since last season's Fiesta Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   North Carolina State (6-0) was idle, which has pretty much been
the case all season with a schedule liberally sprinkled with the
likes of New Mexico, East Tennessee State, Navy and Massachusetts.</TE>
<TE>   Air Force is 5-0, has defeated a school from the Big Ten
(Northwestern) and the Pacific 10 (California), yet has no shot at
the national championship unless Congress intervenes and rewrites BCS
bylaws.</TE>
<TE>   On our rank-o-meter, Notre Dame is a solid team, nowhere near
great--at least not yet. The difference between this year's 5-0 start
and last year's 5-6 finish is Willingham has instilled the confidence
in his players to win close games.</TE>
<TE>   The Irish offense is only average, so they rely on a defense that
is Rockne solid. It's shocking that their secondary doesn't get
burned for more big plays--"They took some chances," Stanford Coach
Buddy Teevens said--yet the Irish have so far managed to play
aggressively without paying a price.</TE>
<TE>   College football sage Beano Cook was way off when he once
predicted two Heisman Trophies for Notre Dame quarterback Ron Powlus,
but he was dead on with his radio comment Saturday that Colorado
ought to hire Tony Soprano's psychiatrist. No team needs couch time
more than the Buffaloes, who continue to confound. A look at the log:
Colorado lost its fourth consecutive opener under Gary Barnett, got
wiped out at home by USC, then throttled UCLA at the Rose Bowl and,
most recently, knocked Kansas State from the national title race
(yes!!).</TE>
<TE>   Colorado has become the team you want to play most in early
September and the team you want to play least in November.</TE>

<HD>A Hurricane Is Coming Through</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LONNIE WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last season, only seven points separated the top six teams in the
Eastern Conference and Carolina, which wouldn't have made the
playoffs in the West, ended up in the Stanley Cup finals.</LD>
<LD>   Parity? Maybe. A soft conference? Definitely.</LD>
<LD>   In any case, the East is up for grabs again with Philadelphia,
Ottawa, the New York Rangers and the Hurricanes leading the way.</LD>
<TE>   The Flyers, who have not won a Stanley Cup in 27 years, are loaded
with talent and have a proven coach in Ken Hitchcock, who takes over
after nearly seven seasons behind the Dallas Stars' bench.
Philadelphia General Manager Bobby Clarke can only hope that
Hitchcock is ready to add to a resume that already includes five
division titles, two Western Conference titles and one Stanley Cup
title.</TE>
<TE>   Ottawa also should be much improved with a strong group of young
but experienced players in Marian Hossa, Martin Havlat and Wade
Redden. The Senators, however, have a history of falling short in the
playoffs under Coach Jacques Martin, who will be on the hot seat.</TE>
<TE>   Another team not to be counted out is the Rangers, who hired a new
coach in Bryan Trottier, who will work with acquisitions Bobby Holik
and Darius Kasparaitis along with returning veterans Pavel Bure, Eric
Lindros, Brian Leetch and Mike Richter.</TE>
<TE>   And then there's Carolina, which is led by Coach Paul Maurice, who
in his eighth season holds the longest current tenure among NHL
coaches. The Hurricanes' run to the finals last season makes them the
team to beat, especially because they re-signed captain Ron Francis
and defenseman Brett Hedican to play with up-and-coming youngsters
Josef Vasicek, Jaroslav Svoboda and Erik Cole.</TE>
<TE>   Capsules in predicted order of finish:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   1. CAROLINA</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Paul Maurice, eighth season.</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 35-26-16-5, 91 points, first in Southeast
Division, third in conference.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Forward Jeff O'Neill, who recorded his third
consecutive 60-point season in 2001-02 with 64 points (31 goals, 33
assists).</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Ron Francis is beginning his 22nd NHL season and he's
still one of the best set-up players in the game. Vasicek and Svoboda
gained a great deal of experience in last season's playoffs and
should only be better this season. Throw in skilled forwards such as
Rod Brind'Amour, Erik Cole and O'Neill along with a strong defense
and goaltending tandem of Arturs Irbe and Kevin Weekes, and it's easy
to see why the Hurricanes are considered favorites.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   2. PHILADELPHIA</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Ken Hitchcock, first season.</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 42-27-10-3, 97 points, first in Atlantic Division,
second in conference.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Forward Simon Gagne, who led the Flyers in goals
with 33, including seven game-winners.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Hitchcock's defense-first style should work well with the
Flyers, who have underachieved in the playoffs the last few seasons.
It's put up or shut up time for high-scoring forward Jeremy Roenick,
who along with Gagne, Mark Recchi, Keith Primeau and John LeClair
should carry the team's scoring load. The big question about the
Flyers will be goalie Roman Cechmanek, who is expected to take over
now that Brian Boucher has been traded.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   3. OTTAWA</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Jacques Martin, eighth season.</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 39-27-9-7, 94 points, third in Northeast Division,
seventh in conference.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Goaltender Patrick Lalime, who appeared in a
career-high 61 games last season and was outstanding in the playoffs
with a 1.39 goals-against average.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: The obstruction crackdown should benefit the Senators,
who have all the pieces in place to make a legitimate run at the
Stanley Cup. Up front, veteran Daniel Alfredsson should get plenty of
scoring help from Marian Hossa, Radek Bonk and Martin Havlat. But the
key to the Senators will be their defense, which is headed by Wade
Redden, who has a habit of being on the ice whenever Ottawa scores.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   4. N.Y. RANGERS</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Bryan Trottier, first season.</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 36-38-4-4, 80 points, fourth in Atlantic Division,
11th in conference.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Forward Eric Lindros, who led the Rangers in
scoring last season with 73 points and in plus-minus with plus-19.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: The main reason the Rangers failed to make the playoffs
last season was their weak special teams. Trottier, who coached
Colorado's power play the last couple of seasons, should help along
with high-scoring winger Pavel Bure, who will sit out the first few
weeks of the season because of a knee injury. If Mike Richter can
hold up in goal and Brian Leetch can regain his consistency, the
Rangers will be in the hunt.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   5. MONTREAL</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Michel Therrien, third season.</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 36-31-12-3, 87 points, fourth in Northeast
Division, eighth in conference.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Forward Saku Koivu, who sat out 79 games before
making an inspirational return from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma last
season.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Goaltender Jose Theodore, who won the Hart and Vezina
Trophies last season, is great but he can't do it all. Having Koivu
for an entire season combined with feisty Donald Audette and the
additions of Mariusz Czerkawski and veteran forward Randy McKay
should provide a stronger scoring punch for the Canadiens, who were
led in scoring last season by Yanic Perreault.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   6. WASHINGTON</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Bruce Cassidy, first season.</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 36-33-11-2, 85 points, second in Southeast
Division, ninth in conference.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Defenseman Calle Johansson, who needs 39 games to
tie Kelly Miller for most games played in franchise history.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Any team that can roll out scorers Jaromir Jagr and Peter
Bondra will always be a threat. Last season, the Capitals failed to
make the playoffs and it cost Coach Ron Wilson his job. Defenseman
Sergei Gonchar, who had 26 goals last season, is one of the most
underrated players in the league. But Washington needs goaltender
Olaf Kolzig to step up and newcomer Robert Lang to stay healthy in
order to be a legitimate threat for the Stanley Cup.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   7. TORONTO</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Pat Quinn, fifth season.</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 43-25-10-4, 100 points, second in Northeast
Division, fourth in conference.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Defenseman Bryan McCabe, who had a career-best 17
goals and 43 points last season.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: The departure of goaltender Curtis Joseph, who signed as
a free agent with Detroit, will hurt and the Maple Leafs are taking a
big chance by counting on veteran Ed Belfour to take over. Winger
Gary Roberts gained respect around the league with his performance in
last season's playoffs and center Darcy Tucker is coming off a strong
24-goal season. But the main man for the Maple Leafs is captain Mats
Sundin, who finished with 41 goals and 80 points last season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   8. NEW JERSEY</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Pat Burns, first season.</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 41-28-9-4, 95 points, third in Atlantic Division,
sixth in conference.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Forward Jeff Friesen, who is looking to regain
his scoring touch after being a bust with the Mighty Ducks.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Burns is the only man in NHL history to win three Jack
Adams Awards as the league's top coach and he will have his work cut
out for him with the Devils. New Jersey will be strong defensively
with Scott Stevens, Scott Niedermayer, Colin White, Brian Rafalski
and Oleg Tverdovsky, but the offense will be a question mark.
Forwards Patrik Elias, Jay Pandolfo, John Madden and Friesen need to
produce in order for New Jersey to have a chance.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   9. BOSTON</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Robbie Ftorek, second season.</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 43-24-6-9, 101 points, first in Northeast
Division, first in conference.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Forward Brian Rolston, who led the NHL with nine
short-handed goals last season.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Big things are expected from winger Sergei Samsonov, who
will have to take over some of the scoring load with the departure of
free agent Bill Guerin. Glen Murray stepped up with a career season
last year and Joe Thornton is emerging as one of the league's top
centers, but unless the Bruins make a late turnaround and re-sign
goaltender Byron Dafoe, this may be a long season with former Duck
Steve Shields in the net.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   10. N.Y. ISLANDERS</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Peter Laviolette, second season.</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 42-28-8-4, 96 points, second in Atlantic Division,
fifth in conference.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Forward Alexei Yashin, who led the Islanders with
32 goals and 75 points last season.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Last season, Laviolette led the Islanders to a 44-point
improvement over 2000-01 but that did not prevent them from being
bounced from the playoffs in the first round. The loss of captain
Michael Peca until at least January and the failure to add any
offense during the off-season will make things tough for the
Islanders, who will need a monster season from goaltender Chris
Osgood to make the playoffs again.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   11. PITTSBURGH</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Rick Kehoe, second season.</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 28-41-8-5, 69 points, fifth in Atlantic Division,
12th in conference.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Goaltender Johan Hedberg, who appeared in 66
games in his first full NHL season and finished with six shutouts.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: If Mario Lemieux can stay healthy and play in a majority
of games, the Penguins will be in the thick of things. But if Lemieux
pulls another disappearing act, the Penguins can mail this season in.
Forwards Alexei Kovalev, Aleksey Morozov and Jan Hrdina can get
things done on offense, but Pittsburgh has too many holes to be
considered a playoff team. It also doesn't help to have forward
Martin Straka out indefinitely because of an off-season back injury.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   12. TAMPA BAY</TE>
<TE>   Coach: John Tortorella, third season.</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 27-40-11-4, 69 points, third in Southeast
Division, 13th in conference.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Forward Vincent Lecavalier, who should be a
better player now that he has been replaced as captain by Dave
Andreychuk.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: It's time for the Lightning to make a jump to a .500
team, especially with Nikolai Khabibulin in goal. Tampa Bay will
continue to be young up front with Ruslan Fedotenko (23) and
Alexander Svitov (19) joining 22-year olds Brad Richards and
Lecavalier. But Tampa Bay probably will depend too much on Khabibulin
because of a suspect group of defensemen, led by Pavel Kubina, who
led rookies in ice time last season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   13. FLORIDA</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Mike Keenan, second season.</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 22-44-10-6, 60 points, fourth in Southeast
Division, 14th in conference.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Defenseman Sandis Ozolinsh, who led the Panthers
with 52 points after being picked up from Carolina midseason.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Winger Kristian Huselius is a solid young player and
Niklas Hagman and Stephen Weiss are not bad but the Panthers simply
do not have enough punch on offense now that Valeri Bure does not
have his brother, Pavel, to play with anymore. Florida's strength
will be on defense with additions of Dmitry Yushkevich, Sven
Butenschon and highly touted rookie Jay Bouwmeester and with Roberto
Luongo, who had a 2.74 goals-against average last season, in the net.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   14. ATLANTA</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Curt Fraser, fourth season.</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 19-47-11-5, 54 points, fifth in Southeast
Division, 15th in conference.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Forward Shawn McEachern, who was picked up in an
off-season trade from Ottawa to help provide veteran leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: With forwards Dany Heatley and Ilya Kovalchuk leading the
way, the Thrashers will be a dangerous team. Heatley (26 goals and 41
assists) and Kovalchuk (29 goals and 22 assists) were the NHL's top
scoring rookies last season. Atlanta made good moves in picking up
forwards Vyacheslav Kozlov and McEachern during the summer. The
Thrashers also did well in strengthening their defense by adding
Richard Smehlik and Uwe Krupp.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   15. BUFFALO</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Lindy Ruff, sixth season.</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 35-35-11-1, 82 points, fifth in Northeast
Division, 10th in conference.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Forward Stu Barnes, who finished second on the
Sabres in scoring last season with 48 points in 68 games.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Ownership troubles and possible relocation of the
franchise will be a major distraction all season for the Sabres, who
are being operated by the league. Miroslav Satan is a good player but
Buffalo will need Ruff to work more miracles to get back into the
playoffs. Ruff will have to get the most out of players such as Tim
Connolly and Jochen Hecht and get his defense to hold up in order for
that to happen.</TE>

<KH>NEW YORK GIANTS 21, DALLAS 17</KH>
<HD>Simple Approach Is Taken in Victory</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>IRVING, Texas</DL>
<LD>By simplifying their offense, the New York Giants made it better.</LD>
<LD>   Sticking to their promise to keep things simple, the Giants'
offense started clicking, with Kerry Collins throwing three touchdown
passes and Tiki Barber running for a season-high 94 yards in a 21-17
victory over the Dallas Cowboys Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   New York (3-2), which had scored three offensive touchdowns in its
first four games, scored two immediately after touchdowns by Dallas
(2-3), including a 17-yard pass from Collins to tight end Marcellus
Rivers with 6:51 left that erased a 17-14 deficit.</LD>
<TE>   That drive typified what the Giants did right all day. They went
80 yards in eight plays, starting with a 23-yard run by Barber.
Collins completed passes to four receivers, with a 20-yarder to Dan
Campbell on third down keeping the drive alive.</TE>
<TE>   "We had more than one guy step up and make plays for us," Coach
Jim Fassel said. "We had good balance. We ran the ball well and Kerry
did a good job of picking the right people."</TE>
<TE>   How's this for balance: New York ran 28 times and threw 27.</TE>
<TE>   And efficiency: The Giants' only long pass turned into a 56-yard
touchdown by Amani Toomer and they scored touchdowns both times they
reached the Dallas 20. New York had only two touchdowns in 11 trips
that deep this season.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, this will get the ball rolling for us," said Collins,
who completed 18 of 27 passes for 228 yards. He also had an
interception that nearly led to a Cowboy field goal--a 45-yard
attempt hit the right upright--and a fumble early in the fourth
quarter that led to a five-yard touchdown pass from Quincy Carter to
Antonio Bryant that put Dallas ahead, 17-14.</TE>

<HD>All Is Forgiven</HD>
<DH>Gretzky may have regretted being traded away, but time is a
great healer for King whose jersey will be retired</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wayne Gretzky never really left Los Angeles. Not during the hiccup in
time when he wore a St. Louis blue note on his sweater, and not
during the three seasons he cheerfully jostled for taxis in New York.</LD>
<LD>   His home was always here. His heart was too.</LD>
<LD>   So when the Kings honor him at a charity dinner today at Staples
Center and retire his jersey to the arena rafters Wednesday, it will
be easy to imagine he has been here all the time.</LD>
<TE>   Easy to pretend the Kings never traded him to the Blues. That
Gretzky and owner Philip Anschutz, strong-willed men who hadn't
gotten full measure of each other, were never at odds after Gretzky
urged club executives to add talent and revive the sagging team.
Anschutz, accustomed to deference and not debate, figured Gretzky
merely wanted more money and backed then-general manager Sam
McMaster's decision to trade Gretzky for an assortment of young
players on Feb. 27, 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Gretzky, who last year became a 20% owner and managing partner of
the Phoenix Coyotes, said he harbors no bitterness. But he resented
being portrayed as greedy, leaving unsaid that if not for him, the
Kings and Staples Center might not exist today.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have loved to finish my career in L.A., but since then,
he and I became friends," Gretzky said. "We talk about it. He made a
business decision, and I understand that. Not everything in life
works out. There are no hard feelings."</TE>
<TE>   But think what could have happened if he had stayed and won the
Stanley Cup championship that still eludes the Kings, who haven't
gotten past the second round of the playoffs since their exhilarating
run to the 1993 finals.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish that could have happened, because in a lot of ways, I
worked harder in L.A. than I did in Edmonton," he said. "In Edmonton,
the team was so good, so powerful and so talented, and being in a
Canadian city, it was a hockey city. When I came to L.A., the team
had finished second to last in the NHL that year and was drawing
6,000 people a game. We as an organization worked hard in the
community selling hockey and getting kids to participate in hockey."</TE>
<TE>   Imagine, finally, that the last jersey he wore before ending his
unparalleled career in 1999 was the black-and-silver model the Kings
will wear Wednesday in homage to the NHL's all-time scoring leader.
Tim Leiweke, president of the Kings and Staples Center, has pictured
that often.</TE>
<TE>   "From my standpoint and the organization's standpoint, I have a
great deal of respect for him and have an extremely good relationship
with him now," said Leiweke, who was hired by Anschutz a few months
after Gretzky was traded. "But it took some time."</TE>
<TE>   While Gretzky mended fences with Anschutz, he also was waiting for
former King owner Bruce McNall to emerge from behind the barbed-wire
fences of federal prison, where McNall served nearly four years on
two counts of bank fraud and one each of wire fraud and conspiracy.</TE>
<TE>   By McNall's count, his misdeeds cost Gretzky about $1 million,
plus about $400,000 in legal fees for McNall and some associates.
Yet, Gretzky stuck with him, visiting him wherever he was moved and
offering support--but never explaining why he put off the Kings'
requests to retire his jersey alongside those of Dave Taylor, Rogie
Vachon and Marcel Dionne.</TE>
<TE>   It was Rick Minch, Gretzky's personal assistant, who told McNall
that although the NHL retired Gretzky's No. 99 and the Edmonton
Oilers retired his jersey, Gretzky wouldn't participate in a ceremony
in Los Angeles without McNall.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was one of the most incredible things anybody had
ever done," said McNall, who is executive-producing three films and
writing a book to pay his legal fees and repay his victims. "I almost
couldn't imagine it. I told him to do what's best for him, but he
said he wouldn't do it until I was able to participate. I was
flabbergasted by it all."</TE>
<TE>   Gretzky is famously loyal to friends. He helped World Hockey Assn.
teammate Bill Flett through alcohol rehabilitation and performed
similar mercies for "countless" others, said his agent, Mike Barnett.
"Whether it be a car here or some other form of assistance, you
couldn't count them all on two hands," Barnett said.</TE>
<TE>   His bond with McNall, though, was unique.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt really strongly that Bruce had gone through a tremendous
amount and had been punished and served his time," Gretzky said, "and
had it not been for the Kings organization and Bruce, I would never
have played in Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   How he became a King and how he and McNall helped the NHL extend
its short reach to unexpectedly far places is worth retelling.</TE>
<TE>   "When Wayne went to L.A., he really changed the lay of the land
for a lot of people," said Glen Sather, who was the general manager
of the Oilers in 1988 and reluctantly obeyed owner Peter
Pocklington's order to trade Gretzky. "He popularized hockey in L.A.
and created a big-time atmosphere. The exposure was immense, not only
there, but in a lot of places.</TE>
<TE>   "The game in the southern part of the States changed dramatically.
He opened the frontier for all of those cities."</TE>
<TE>   McNall added that when people look at the sheer size of another
L.A. star, 7-foot-1, 340-pound Shaquille O'Neal of the Lakers, "they
can't relate." "Wayne looks normal, and that's part of his charm and
mystique," McNall said. "Also, I think he was so young, and you take
records that have been around so long and double them--you don't just
beat it a little bit, you crush 'em--that added to it. He in some
ways was a freak, but he was totally human in terms of his appearance
and his down-to-earthiness.</TE>
<TE>   "I doubt that in any sport, certainly in hockey, there will be
that combination of time and place and circumstances that would allow
it to happen again."</TE>
<TE>   Gretzky and the Oilers ruled the NHL in the 1980s, playing a
high-tempo style and obliterating scoring records. Grant Fuhr was a
money goaltender; and Paul Coffey, Glenn Anderson and Jari Kurri were
world-class players, but none had Gretzky's gift for the subtle
marvels of the game.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew he was going to be somebody special, but the magnitude of
what he ultimately became probably surprised everybody but Wayne and
Walter [Gretzky's father]," said Barnett, who first heard of Gretzky
when he was a 12-year-old phenom.</TE>
<TE>   Gretzky became a 10-time scoring champion and nine-time most
valuable player, leading the young Oilers to the Cup in 1984, 1985,
1987 and 1988. But with success came high salaries, too high for
Pocklington in a small Canadian market. By the late 1980s, he was
asking around to gauge Gretzky's value, and he found an ideal trading
partner in McNall.</TE>
<TE>   McNall, who built a fortune dealing in coins and artifacts, had
purchased 25% of the Kings from Jerry Buss in 1986. He recalls Buss
musing about bringing Gretzky to Los Angeles, and when McNall upped
his stake to 49% in 1987, he asked if Buss thought it remotely
possible. Buss told him Pocklington hinted Gretzky could be had.</TE>
<TE>   That was all McNall had to hear. He was a hockey fan, but he knew
he needed a compelling reason to draw casual fans to the Forum.</TE>
<TE>   "This is Los Angeles. It's not Detroit. It's not Toronto. It's a
star-driven town," McNall said. "I got obsessed with this concept of
getting Wayne."</TE>
<TE>   McNall had been elected chairman of the NHL's board of governors
and at league meetings invariably asked Pocklington if Gretzky was
available. The answer was no until the summer of 1988, when
Pocklington approached him.</TE>
<TE>   "Right away he outlined the cash he needed, $15 million, and that
never changed," McNall said.</TE>
<TE>   Gretzky knew something was up but wasn't sure what. The morning
after the Oilers' fourth Stanley Cup championship he was awakened at
7:30 by a phone call from a Vancouver businessman who wanted to buy
the Canucks if Gretzky would play for them.</TE>
<TE>   "That's when it started to unravel," Gretzky said. "That's when I
said to Peter I wanted to go either to Detroit or L.A."</TE>
<TE>   The choice of Southern California wasn't to boost the acting
career of his wife, Janet Jones, as was speculated. They planned on
having a family--their four children range from 2 to 12--and Janet
wanted to be a full-time mom.</TE>
<TE>   "I just felt there was a reason pulling me to L.A.," Gretzky said.
"I don't know if part of it was Bruce, and part of it was the
challenge of going there. It was a challenge to me. People said,
'Hockey can't be popular in L.A.,' but all I could remember were the
years I was in Edmonton and we'd play L.A. in the playoffs. We hated
them, and the atmosphere was unbelievable. I kept thinking, 'This
could be an unbelievable place.' "</TE>
<TE>   McNall broached the subject over dinner with him and Jones at a
Westwood Boulevard restaurant shortly before their wedding. "I don't
think he believed in a million years this was real," McNall said.</TE>
<TE>   But McNall was scrambling to make it real, persevering when the
reluctant Sather quibbled over players.</TE>
<TE>   "We were talking in my office and I called Peter and I put it on
the speaker phone and put it all in the open," McNall said. "When
Wayne heard Peter basically say, 'We're happy with whatever numbers
and players,' I hung up and Wayne turned and said, 'I am now a Los
Angeles King. I'll never be an Edmonton Oiler again.'</TE>
<TE>   "At that moment, Wayne became as proactive in helping the process
as I was. He said, 'We need to get Marty [McSorley] and this player
and this player.' Peter wanted three first-round picks and I couldn't
get him off that. Wayne said we should stagger it so we don't give up
a pick every year. In a way, it was the beginning of our partnership.
It wasn't an employer-employee relationship but a partnership to
bring hockey to the U.S."</TE>
<TE>   When the Canadian government pressured Pocklington to keep its
native son and Canadian fans vented their fury, Pocklington wavered.
McNall feared the worst when he flew to Edmonton and Pocklington
asked to speak to Gretzky privately.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought, 'He's going to talk him out of it and that's going to
be that,' " McNall said. "But Wayne sensed I was worried and said,
'Bruce, relax.' I told him not to worry about me and that if he
wanted to undo it, we can, that he should do what's in his heart. He
went in and five minutes later said, 'Yeah, Peter talked a little
about undoing it, but there was no way I was going to back out.' "</TE>
<TE>   The Oilers dealt Gretzky, McSorley and Mike Krushelnyski to the
Kings for Jimmy Carson--just off a 55-goal, 107-point season--Martin
Gelinas, first-round draft picks in 1989, 1991 and 1993 and $15
million on Aug. 9, 1988. Hockey would never be the same.</TE>
<TE>   "I distinctly remember how proud Wayne was when the Kings became
the first Los Angeles-based team to sell out in season tickets,"
Barnett said of the 1991-92 season. "We grew up in Canada, and when
you think of Los Angeles, you think of the Dodgers and Lakers and
Rams and the enormous following and success they had. And to think
that despite that, Wayne Gretzky and his teammates were the first
professional sports team to sell out in advance of a season was very,
very gratifying, particularly when they put into perspective where
they were when Wayne arrived."</TE>
<TE>   But at first, Gretzky had serious doubts. He shared them with
friends on the first day of his first King training camp. "I remember
my exact quote: 'I can't believe how bad this team is,' " he said.
"You have to understand, this was the second-worst team in hockey and
I had just come from one of the best teams ever. But we got on a huge
roll and finished second or third overall that year, which was
staggering in itself."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings became a hot ticket, drawing celebrities and fans who
recognized and appreciated his genius. He passed Gordie Howe's goal
and point records and won three scoring titles while a King; he
appeared on "Saturday Night Live" and was among the few NHL players
advertisers sought for national commercials.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings' box-office success made hot-weather hockey trendy.
McNall persuaded Michael Eisner, head of the Walt Disney Co., to buy
an expansion franchise in Anaheim. The Minnesota North Stars moved to
Dallas, and the NHL established outposts in Miami, Tampa Bay and
Nashville.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been involved in just about every sport out there and I
think Gretz maybe was the most significant athlete in the history of
any game because of the impact he made on the sport," Leiweke said.
"I don't know of any other athlete in any other sport that ultimately
changed the dynamic of a league as much as he did hockey."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings peaked in the spring of 1993, when they reached the Cup
finals. It wasn't their best team--Gretzky missed much of the season
because of a back injury--but it was the most successful. "That year,
in my mind, cemented hockey as far as the Los Angeles Kings
organization goes," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The game's future was solidified, but McNall's finances were
crumbling and he was juggling too many balls to enjoy the team's
success. Desperate for cash, he sold 72% of the club to Joe Cohen and
Jeffrey Sudikoff in 1994; the Kings missed the playoffs that spring
and the next. Coach Barry Melrose got into a power struggle with
management and was fired in 1995. The club fell into Chapter 11
bankruptcy that summer before Anschutz and Ed Roski bought it for
$113.25 million in October.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody knew how quickly it could unravel, and it seemed to just
spiral into disarray," Gretzky said. "We went through a lot, and
before you knew it, even I was out of there. That's what was most
disappointing about it."</TE>
<TE>   McMaster, recommended for the general manager job by Gretzky,
traded Gretzky to St. Louis for Craig Johnson, Patrice Tardif, Roman
Vopat and two draft picks. McMaster, who declined to discuss the
trade, was fired a year later.</TE>
<TE>   Said Pat Conacher, a King teammate and now a Coyote assistant
coach: "I don't care if they were getting younger or whatever. You
still want the best player in the league on your team. Why wouldn't
you keep him? I was dumbfounded, knowing everything he did for that
franchise."</TE>
<TE>   Gretzky's stay in St. Louis was brief. He had wanted to play with
winger Brett Hull, but he chafed under taskmaster coach Mike Keenan
and rejected a long-term offer and signed with the New York Rangers
for less money. He enjoyed his first year there, even resolving old
differences with former King teammate Luc Robitaille, who blamed
Gretzky for the trade that sent him away from the Kings. The Rangers
reached the semifinals before losing to Philadelphia but couldn't
build on that. They missed the playoffs the next two years, and
Gretzky was soured when coach Colin Campbell, a longtime friend, was
fired.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the selling points when I went to New York was they never
decide to go young," Gretzky said. "That's the one year they decided
to go young and couldn't come to terms with Mark [Messier] and Mark
left town. It was a draggy two years."</TE>
<TE>   He began considering retirement early in 1999 but said nothing
until midseason, when he told his wife and best friend he was about
to play in his All-Star finale. "My wife said, 'If it's going to be
your last All-Star game, win the truck,' " Gretzky said of the prize
awarded to the MVP.</TE>
<TE>   So he did.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, he retired in April. When he did, there was no doubt
where the family would go. "We'd talk to the kids and say, 'Where do
you want to live and grow up,' " he said, "and it would always come
back to, 'We want to live in L.A.' "</TE>
<TE>   Although he's building a home in Phoenix, the family's permanent
residence is at the exclusive Sherwood Country Club in Thousand Oaks.
He also pays for a suite at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Before he invested in the Coyotes, Gretzky spoke to the Kings
about a front-office job, "but I didn't want to be a figurehead....
Their show was up and running smoothly and that was great, and when
this opportunity came along I said, 'It's close to L.A., as close as
I can be to L.A., it's too good a situation to pass up.' "</TE>
<TE>   However, Leiweke hasn't given up on bringing him back someday. "Is
there a day in the foreseeable future when he could conceivably play
a role here? He's with Phoenix, and I'm not going to tamper," Leiweke
said. "But at the end of the day, Gretz should retire a King and we
missed that opportunity once. If it ever presents itself again, I
hope we'll make it work the next time."</TE>
<TE>   Said Gretzky: "I always put my heart and soul in everything I did
there, when I played, on and off the ice. I thoroughly enjoyed
playing there. It was a really special place to play. I'm proud of
the fact people now say, 'L.A. is a good hockey city.' "</TE>

<HD>Wins Let Mandella Make Grand Plans</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Trainer Richard Mandella broke into the Breeders' Cup win column with
at least 76 trombones in 1993, winning two of the races at Santa
Anita and adding a pair of victories in $100,000 undercard stakes on
the same day.</LD>
<LD>   Since then, Mandella has fired some fairly formidable horses the
Breeders' Cup's way, but win No. 3 has eluded him. Out of 11
post-1993 starters, his best showings have been a couple of seconds.</LD>
<LD>   Until this past weekend, Mandella wasn't even sure he'd be
represented at the 19th Breeders' Cup, to be run Oct. 26 at Arlington
Park in suburban Chicago, but his barn began heating up Saturday at
Santa Anita, and by Sunday night it had come to a boil. Today finds
Mandella making reservations for three horses to go to Chicago.</LD>
<TE>   After Listen Indy ran a respectable third in Saturday's Norfolk,
earning a spot in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile, Mandella won two races
worth $800,000 in just 34 minutes Sunday. Pleasantly Perfect beat
Momentum, the 9-10 favorite, by 3 1/4 lengths in the Goodwood
Handicap to punch his ticket for the Breeders' Cup Classic, and then
Mandella saddled The Tin Man for a one-length win over another
favorite, Sarafan, in the Clement L. Hirsch Memorial Turf
Championship. The Tin Man will move on to the Breeders' Cup Turf, the
race Mandella's Kotashaan won in 1993 en route to the
horse-of-the-year title.</TE>
<TE>   Besides being sons of Kentucky Derby winners--Pleasantly Perfect
was sired by Pleasant Colony and The Tin Man is by Affirmed--Sunday's
winners have another thing in common: They're both lucky to still be
racing. As a yearling, Pleasantly Perfect had a virus near his heart
sac, explaining why his heart rate plummeted instead of rising every
time he exercised. The Tin Man suffered a tendon injury--sometimes
career-ending--as an unraced 2-year-old.</TE>
<TE>   Pleasantly Perfect, ridden by Alex Solis, had never run in a stake
until his fourth-place finish in the Pacific Classic at Del Mar in
August. This time, paying $9.40 as the third choice, he ran 1 1/8
miles in 1:46.80, barely missing Bertrando's stakes record of 1:46.72
in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at his form," Mandella said. "He gets better and smarter
with each race. I think he's pretty smart right now."</TE>
<TE>   Mike Smith, who rode Pleasantly Perfect the first time he won, has
ridden The Tin Man in all 11 of his races, six of them victories. The
4-year-old gelding paid $7 and covered 1 1/4 miles in 1:58.93,
slightly slower than Admise's stakes-record 1:58.48 in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "He ran a dynamite race," Smith said. "He had to run like this to
prove he belongs. I knew Sarafan was coming at us in the stretch, but
my horse was really reaching in the last part."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier at Santa Anita, favored Composure--also ridden by
Smith--was a three-length winner of the Oak Leaf, giving trainer Bob
Baffert his fifth win in the stake in the last six years. Composure
is headed for the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trainer Saeed bin Suroor said that Marienbard would probably run
in both the Breeders' Cup Turf and the Japan Cup (Nov. 24) after his
three-quarter-length win over Sulamani in the Arc de Triomphe at
Longchamp. British bookmakers have made Sulamani the 4-1 favorite for
the Turf, with Marienbard and High Chaparral, the third-place
finisher in the Arc, listed at 5-1. Marienbard, who was 15-1 in Paris
for the Arc and 7-1 in the U.S., gave Sheik Mohammed's Godolphin
Racing and jockey Frankie Dettori their third wins in the Arc.</TE>

Overbook Spinster Stakes, with Printemps finishing third.</TE>

<LD>Andrew Castillo, a senior fullback at San Gabriel Gabrielino High,
remained in a coma Sunday night after suffering a head injury Friday
night against Burbank.</LD>
<LD>   Castillo was in critical condition at Providence Holy Cross
Hospital in Mission Hills after surgery Sunday to remove a blood clot
on the left side of his brain, said Gary Goodson, superintendent of
the San Gabriel Unified School District. A similar surgery was
performed Friday after Castillo was admitted to the hospital.</LD>
<LD>   Castillo walked off the field after a running play, complaining of
a headache, and was being attended to by a coach and administrator
when he fell unconscious, Goodson said.</LD>
<TE>   Coaches from both teams agreed to call the game with 10:45
remaining and Gabrielino leading, 12-7.</TE>

<LD>The view from the sideline has never been this gloomy for longtime
Baldwin Park football Coach Tony Zane.</LD>
<LD>   Sure, the Braves have had their share of early-season adversity
during Zane's 30 years at the school, but the coach had always been
quick to institute a new scheme or impart a few words of wisdom.</LD>
<LD>   That hasn't been the case the last two weeks, after Baldwin Park
Unified School District officials banned Zane from coaching upon
learning he has an irregular heartbeat. Assistant Larry Davis has
coached the Braves in Zane's absence.</LD>
<TE>   Zane felt powerless as he stood on the Baldwin Park sideline
Friday and watched the Braves fall to 0-3-1 with a 35-0 loss to
Whittier Pioneer.</TE>
<TE>   "It was hard to watch," Zane said, "because we were playing a real
good football team and we were playing with a lot of emotion,
especially in the first half."</TE>
<TE>   The coach who guided his team to the Southern Section Division IV
title in 1991 hopes he has observed his last game as a fan.</TE>
<TE>   Zane, 61, taking medication for his condition, submitted a letter
from his doctor to district officials last week. Zane said the letter
explained he is not suffering from heart disease and has not suffered
a heart attack, as was rumored on campus.</TE>
<TE>   Carolyn Wertz, the school district's assistant superintendent, has
said officials would be willing to consider new evidence regarding
Zane's condition.</TE>
<TE>   Zane, who said he has suffered no ill effects while coaching since
being diagnosed with the condition four years ago, is optimistic that
he can quickly return to his job.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing more wrong with me than there has been over the
last three years," he said.</TE>

<TE>   With senior receivers Ryan Jenkins and Tyler Garcia sidelined by
injuries and Glenn Ardrey, another senior receiver, out because of
academic problems, Santa Ana Foothill needed a big game from junior
Yoko Hamamura on Friday against Orange El Modena.</TE>
<TE>   Hamamura delivered, catching four passes for 103 yards and two
touchdowns, including a game-winning 42-yard score with 1:03 left
that completed a 21-point rally during the Knights' 28-24 win. His
first touchdown, a 48-yard play, pulled Foothill to within 24-14 with
10:41 left.</TE>
<TE>   All this despite having no career receptions before Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "They threw it to me once, but I dropped it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hamamura said he was so nervous when he heard his number called in
the huddle with the game on the line that he "couldn't even breathe."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Now that Ventura St. Bonaventure's and Lancaster Paraclete's
winning streaks have been ended at 43 and 28 games, respectively,
Mission Viejo and Newhall Hart have the current longest runs of
success in the Southern Section.</TE>
<TE>   Mission Viejo (4-0), the defending Division II champion, has won
18 consecutive games. The Diablos suffered their last loss to Chino,
17-7, in the quarterfinals of the 2000 playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Hart (3-0-1), winner of four consecutive Division III titles, has
a 26-game unbeaten streak. The Indians, who tied Los Alamitos, 21-21,
in their opener, haven't been beaten since losing to L.A. Loyola
midway through the 2000 season.</TE>
<TE>   Mission Viejo and Hart could meet in the Division II playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   San Clemente's senior quarterback Beau Budde suffered a hairline
fracture in his left foot against Corona Centennial on Friday and is
expected to be sidelined two to four weeks.</TE>
<TE>   His replacement, junior Cole Bergquist, completed 12 of 24 passes
for 115 yards and two interceptions. After completing his first seven
passes--all in the first half--Bergquist struggled as Centennial
pulled away for a 26-12 victory.</TE>
<TE>   "It's huge," San Clemente Coach Eric Patton said of Budde's
injury. "It's like taking USC in the late 1960s and saying, 'O.J.
Simpson got hurt, what do we do now?' You still have other players
and you're still going to compete, but we drop off quite a bit."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   La Verne Damien scored a big victory for tiny Catholic schools
with its 14-9 upset of Division I La Puente Bishop Amat, which at the
time was ranked No. 15 by The Times.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels great because we have always been the little brother
Catholic school that people ignore," said Damien running back Ian
Johnson, who rushed for 174 yards and a touchdown against the
Lancers."</TE>
<TE>   Staff writer Peter Yoon and correspondents John Klima and Eric
Maddy contributed to this report.</TE>

<KH>JACKSONVILLE 28, PHILADELPHIA 25</KH>
<HD>McNabb Can't Stomach Defeat</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JACKSONVILLE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Nobody had to ask Donovan McNabb how he felt after this one.</LD>
<LD>   Led by rookie John Henderson's three sacks, the Jacksonville
Jaguars chased McNabb until he was literally sick to his stomach
Sunday and continued their surprising start with a 28-25 victory over
the Philadelphia Eagles.</LD>
<LD>   McNabb threw for 230 yards and ran for 100, but he paid an extreme
price. He was sacked five times, and toward the end of Philadelphia's
late rally from a 28-10 deficit, he was so exhausted that he had to
pull away from center while he threw up on the field.</LD>
<TE>   "It was the strangest thing I've ever seen," Jaguar cornerback
Fernando Bryant said.</TE>
<TE>   On a steamy day in Jacksonville, the Jaguars (3-1) looked and felt
great. They made all the big plays--including Bobby Shaw's 69-yard
punt return for a touchdown--and Coach Tom Coughlin made the right
calls.</TE>
<TE>   The first came early in the fourth quarter, when Coughlin went for
it on fourth and one from the Eagle two with a 14-10 lead. Stacey
Mack broke Barry Gardner's tackle for the first down and scored from
the one on the next play for a 21-10 lead. "It was just a gut
feeling," Coughlin said. "I feel like these people have to understand
that we're here to win."</TE>
<TE>   McNabb certainly got the picture. Chased repeatedly by the
Jaguars, he became ill with 40 seconds left and the Eagles (3-2)
trying to reduce a 28-18 deficit.</TE>
<TE>   McNabb, who last month signed an NFL-record $115-million contract,
was hooked up to an IV for about 20 minutes after the game.</TE>
<TE>   The loss ended the Eagles' three-game winning streak in which they
outscored Washington, Dallas and Houston by a combined 116-37. But
they made too many mistakes against the Jaguars, including keeping
Jacksonville's second-quarter touchdown drive alive by having too
many players on the field on a punt return.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Craig Johnson was a bit taken aback when he got the news six years
ago. He and two other forwards, along with a first-round draft
choice, had been traded to the Kings from the St. Louis Blues for
Wayne Gretzky, the NHL's all-time scoring leader and Johnson's
childhood hero.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a little weird," he says, "to be traded for the greatest
player of all time. Not all of us combined could come close to
filling his shoes."</LD>
<LD>   Weirder still--or perhaps not, considering the Kings' history--is
that Johnson, a 30-year-old defense-first forward whose 153 points in
eight NHL seasons are 62 fewer than the record 215 Gretzky scored in
the best of his 20, is all the Kings have to show for the Feb. 27,
1996, deal.</LD>
<TE>   Roman Vopat, considered the top player acquired by the Kings,
scored six goals in 133 NHL games but has been out of the league
since 1999. Patrice Tardif, who scored seven goals in 65 NHL games,
has been out of the league since 1996. And Matt Zultek, selected by
the Kings with the 15th pick in the 1997 draft, has never played in
the NHL, though he still toils in the Philadelphia Flyer
organization.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, meanwhile, soldiers on, a regular in the King lineup.
Outstanding skating ability and a seemingly unquenchable work
ethic--he carries 6.5% body fat, lowest on the team--have allowed him
to remain in the NHL despite abdominal and ankle injuries that could
have ended his career.</TE>
<TE>   "I think if you work hard and compete and bring respect to your
job," he says of his longevity, "people are going to recognize that."</TE>
<TE>   The trade couldn't have worked out better for him. He met wife
Brittany, an Orange County native, and started a family. Their boys,
Eric, 4, and Ryan, 1, are frequent visitors to practice, and a baby
girl is due in February.</TE>
<TE>   "When Kings fans look at it and see I'm the only one left from the
Gretzky trade, I'm sure they're a little frustrated," he says. "But
it's nothing I can control."</TE>
<TE>   He didn't ask to be part of the deal. But he would like a
souvenir.</TE>
<TE>   "Ever since I was traded for him, I've always wanted him to sign a
stick and give it to me," says Johnson, who will join his teammates
at Gretzky's jersey-retirement dinner tonight at Staples Center, "but
I've always been afraid to ask.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe you can put that in the paper."</TE>

<LD>Shaquille O'Neal, the long arm of the law, not to mention the thick
arm and the Superman tattooed arm and the highly decorated arm, said
Sunday afternoon that he would like to introduce himself to the new
man, Bill Bratton.</LD>
<LD>   Officer O'Neal, reserve for the Port of Los Angeles Police,
reporting for duty. Sir.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles police chief designate, Bratton hasn't been to
Laker camp yet, but based on his schedule for the past half-week is
due to arrive any day.</LD>
<TE>   "Being that that's what I want to do, I always shake hands with
all of the chiefs and ask them certain questions," O'Neal said. "I
want to know what they're doing, try to read up on them."</TE>
<TE>   Standing Sunday afternoon beside his red SUV, on feet healing
instead of disintegrating for the first time in maybe a year, O'Neal
said he'd like to have his own little LAPD someday. Maybe in
Louisiana, where he attended college in Baton Rouge. More likely in
Orlando, where he spends his summers and one day, when he's given up
his NBA career and mansion in Beverly Hills, will live full-time.</TE>
<TE>   "In this city? No," O'Neal said. "I'd rather go to a smaller town
where I can see everything. When you have 18,000 officers, all those
deputies, you really can't see everything. In a town with 150
deputies, you can talk to them. That's what I want to do, a real
small town where I can talk to people, where they know me and I know
them. Eighteen thousand deputies, that's just too much."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal is in his formative law-enforcement years, his days as a
Sheriff perhaps ahead. He's still spit shining the badge he
occasionally wears on a chain under his street clothes and developing
a management style. Along comes Bratton, the high-profile,
heavy-handed crime fighter who, if his reputation follows, might take
in a Laker game or two and give O'Neal some ideas.</TE>
<TE>   A law-and-order man himself, O'Neal said, "He seems to have done a
lot for New York. Hopefully, he can come here and do a similar job.
His law is the law. It's a good style. Some people are going to think
it's not a good style. But, as long as he's got Mayor Hahn behind
him, he should be fine. I'm sure he'll do a fabulous job."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If Phil Jackson decides he would like to coach the U.S. Olympic
team, his competition likely would come from Utah Jazz Coach Jerry
Sloan, Philadelphia 76er Coach Larry Brown and San Antonio Spur Coach
Gregg Popovich, each of whom has served recent U.S. teams as head or
assistant coaches.</TE>
<TE>   Laker General Manager Mitch Kupchak is on the committee that will
help choose the 2004 coach, as is 76er General Manager Billy King.
Brown said last week he would like to be considered.</TE>
<TE>   USA Basketball won't begin to move on the decision until an annual
meeting in mid-November.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The night before the Lakers play the Phoenix Suns in an Oct. 19
exhibition in Las Vegas, they will room at The Palms, a hotel owned
by Gavin and Joe Maloof, who also own the Sacramento Kings.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers will travel with several rookies who will taste test
everything on Kobe Bryant's room service tray.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers scrimmaged Sunday night at their gym in El Segundo. In
a Clipper-like moment, they were unable to practice earlier in the
day because the gym lights could not be turned on.... Bryant was
treated for what Jackson called "a little nip in his rib cage."</TE>

<HD>It's Official: Da Matta Takes Title</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The prospect of losing a race and winning a championship didn't sit
well with Cristiano da Matta.</LD>
<LD>   Even before Sunday's CART Grand Prix of the Americas in Miami, Da
Matta already was considered the series champion. Mathematically,
three other drivers had chances that could generously be described as
slim.</LD>
<LD>   One by one, the chances of those drivers faded, and in the end, Da
Matta held the huge silver chalice called the Vanderbilt Cup that's
given annually to the CART champion.</LD>
<TE>   Da Matta clinched the points title after holding off Newman/Haas
teammate Christian Fittipaldi by of a 0.734 second. The win was Da
Matta's seventh of the season and 11th in his career.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there isn't a better way to clinch the championship than
with a victory," said Da Matta, who collected a $1-million title
bonus. "If you clinch in fifth place, everybody forgets pretty
quickly that you've won many other races before. When you clinch it
with a win, it's pretty obvious that you were there the whole year."</TE>
<TE>   In a race slowed by six yellow flags, Da Matta's average speed on
the 1.387-mile, 16-turn temporary road course was 68.723 mph,
believed to be the second-slowest winning speed in CART history. Juan
Montoya won in Vancouver in 1999 with an average speed of 65.279 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Da Matta extended his lead to an insurmountable 69 points over
Bruno Junqueira, who finished fifth. No driver can win more than 68
points in the three remaining races.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dale Earnhardt Jr. cruised to his third consecutive victory at
Talladega Superspeedway in the NASCAR Winston Cup Series EA Sports
500, a race that affected the tight championship battle.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Stewart followed Earnhardt across the finish line and jumped
from third to the lead in the Winston Cup point standings. Rookie
Jimmie Johnson and Mark Martin, who were ahead of Stewart in points,
ran into trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Earnhardt's No. 8 Chevrolet was at or near the front of the pack
throughout the 188-lap event, which didn't have a caution flag.</TE>
<TE>   Earnhardt took the lead for good on Lap 150 and was never
challenged, winding up with a race-high 56 laps led.</TE>

<HD>Sorenstam Sets Record With Victory</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Annika Sorenstam shot a seven-under-par 65 Sunday to pull away from
Cristie Kerr and easily win the LPGA Samsung World Championship.</LD>
<LD>   Sorenstam finished with a 22-under 266 at Hiddenbrooke Golf Club
in Vallejo, Calif., six shots ahead of Kerr, with whom she was tied
after three rounds.</LD>
<LD>   It was Sorenstam's ninth victory of the season, surpassing her
career best of eight, set last year.</LD>
<TE>   And with the winner's share of $162,000, she boosted her 2002
earnings to $2,374,000, well over the LPGA record of $2.105 million
she set in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   She also broke the tournament record of 14 under, accomplished
four times, most recently by Juli Inkster in 2000, also at
Hiddenbrooke.</TE>
<TE>   Kerr finished at 16 under after shooting a 71. Michele Redman
eagled the last hole for a 68, finishing third at 15 under. Se Ri Pak
(70) and Rosie Jones (71) tied for fourth, finishing 13 under.</TE>
<TE>   Playing in the final group with Kerr, Sorenstam built a three-shot
lead after the making a birdie on the first hole and never was
threatened thereafter.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Charles Howell III made a clutch up-and-down birdie on the 15th
hole and beat Brandt Jobe and Scott Hoch by two shots for his first
career victory in the Michelob Championship at Williamsburg, Va.</TE>
<TE>   Howell, 23, parred the last two holes for a four-under 67 and won
for the first time in his 68th career start with a 14-under 270.</TE>
<TE>   He became the 14th first-time winner on the PGA Tour this year,
tying the record set in 1991, and the sixth player to do it in this
event.</TE>
<TE>   It was the 22nd and final PGA Tour event on the 6,853-yard River
Course, which will play host to an LPGA Tour event beginning next
year.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hale Irwin birdied the first playoff hole to defeat Gary McCord
and win the Turtle Bay Championship at Kahuku, Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   For Irwin, who had a 0-5 record in Senior PGA playoffs, it was his
third consecutive win at Turtle Bay Resort. He won the event in 2000
and in 1997, when it was held on Maui and called the Kaanapali
Classic.</TE>
<TE>   With the victory, his fourth of the year, Irwin clinched the
Charles Schwab Cup and earned the $1-million annuity.</TE>
<TE>   McCord, also a CBS analyst, closed with a three-under 69 to match
Irwin at eight-under 208. Irwin finished with a 70.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Padraig Harrington made a 12-foot birdie putt on the second
playoff hole to beat Eduardo Romero and win the Dunhill Links
Championship at St. Andrews, Scotland.</TE>
<TE>   Harrington made a 20-foot birdie putt on the final hole of
regulation for a three-under 69. Romero missed an eight-foot birdie
putt at No. 18, finishing with 69 and tying Harrington at 19-under
269.</TE>
<TE>   After both players parred the first playoff hole, Romero missed a
birdie putt from six feet. Harrington then made his birdie putt,
clinching his first victory of the year. Harrington earned $800,000.</TE>
<TE>   Colin Montgomerie birdied nine of his first 12 holes and closed
with a course-record-tying nine-under 63, finishing in a tie for
third with Sandy Lyle (68) and Vijay Singh (70) at 271.</TE>
<TE>   Tennis</TE>
<TE>   Lindsay Davenport had 15 aces, but they weren't enough as she was
upset by Magdalena Maleeva, 5-7, 6-3, 7-6 (4), in the final of the
$2.2-million Kremlin Cup at Moscow.</TE>
<TE>   Davenport was playing in only her sixth tournament of 2002. She
had knee surgery in January, returned in July and has reached three
finals--and has yet to win.</TE>
<TE>   However, by reaching the Kremlin Cup title match, Davenport did
secure a spot in the season-ending WTA Championships at Staples
Center on Nov. 6-11.</TE>
<TE>   Maleeva added to her Kremlin Cup titles in 1994 and 1995. Ranked
23rd coming into the tournament, she defeated Venus Williams and
Amelie Mauresmo en route to the final.</TE>
<TE>   "I never managed to overcome three top-10 players in one event
before," said Maleeva, who won $182,000. "I'm happy, and it is
definitely the best week in my career."</TE>
<TE>   In the men's final, Paul-Henry Mathieu won his first ATP Tour
title by beating U.S. Open semifinalist Sjeng Schalken, 4-6, 6-2,
6-0.</TE>
<TE>   Jill Craybas won the final six games to defeat Silvia Talaja, 2-6,
6-4, 6-4, and win the Japan Open in Tokyo.</TE>
<TE>   It's the first WTA Tour title for Craybas, the 1996 NCAA singles
champion for Florida, who hadn't advanced past the quarterfinals of a
pro tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Kenneth Carlsen beat Magnus Norman, 7-6, (6), 6-3, in the men's
final for his first title since 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   Ernest Kipyego of Kenya won the Cologne Marathon in an
event-record 2 hours 10 minutes 53 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Kipyego beat the previous mark of 2:10:56 set by Germany's Carsten
Eich in 1998 and finished 42 seconds ahead of runner-up Andrew Sambu
of Tanzania.</TE>
<TE>   Claudia Dreher became the first German woman to win the event,
finishing in 2:31:30.</TE>

<KH>SAN FRANCISCO 37, ST. LOUIS 13</KH>
<HD>Rams on Horns of a Dilemma</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>The St. Louis Rams were winless and hurting, and the San Francisco
49ers were only too happy to shove their biggest rivals deeper into
despair.</LD>
<LD>   Jeff Garcia threw for a touchdown and ran for another, and
Garrison Hearst rushed for 116 yards and a score in a 37-13 rout that
ended the 49ers' losing streak at six games against the defending NFC
champions.</LD>
<LD>   Jason Webster staggered the already roughed-up Rams when he
intercepted a pass from career backup Jamie Martin--starting for the
injured Kurt Warner--and returned it 37 yards for a touchdown and
27-3 lead just before halftime.</LD>
<TE>   The 49ers (3-1) looked forward to this game for months. Not only
did they reclaim superiority in the NFC West, they all but ended St.
Louis' playoff hopes--no team has come back from an 0-5 start to
reach the postseason.</TE>
<TE>   "They're down right now, and we wanted to take it to them and not
allow them to get back into a playoff hunt or a position where then
can get rolling," Garcia said.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't want them to have any breathing room."</TE>
<TE>   At a team meeting Saturday night, Coach Steve Mariucci asked how
many of his players had beaten the Rams.</TE>
<TE>   "There weren't a lot of guys standing up," he said. "We have a
really young team and it's a big win for all of us."</TE>
<TE>   Not only were the Rams missing Warner, out for up to two months
with a broken pinkie finger on his throwing hand, but cornerback
Aeneas Williams sat out with a turf-toe injury, ending his streak of
177 starts.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a step backward," Coach Mike Martz said. "This is a real
challenge for this group."</TE>
<TE>   Before the Rams started their three-year run as one of the NFL's
most powerful teams, including two trips to the Super Bowl and one
championship, they lost 17 in a row to the 49ers from 1990-98.</TE>
<TE>   The Rams' start is their worst since the 1963 Los Angeles Rams
opened 0-5 en route to a 5-9 finish.</TE>

<HD>A's Suffer Another Painful Letdown</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>While the Twins celebrated their trip to the American League
championship series Sunday, the A's again watched in disappointment,
losing in Game 5 of the division series for the third consecutive
year and having their 103-win season go down in flames.</LD>
<LD>   Many considered the A's too young and inexperienced in 2000, when
they were eliminated by the New York Yankees, and many thought they
would be hardened by last year's division series, when they lost to
the Yankees after winning the first two games in New York.</LD>
<LD>   But even with three of the best young pitchers in baseball, Tim
Hudson, Mark Mulder and Barry Zito, and a leading
most-valuable-player candidate in shortstop Miguel Tejada, the
heavily favored A's weren't able to close out this series after
winning two of the first three games.</LD>
<TE>   "I thought this was our year to get to the World Series," Zito
said. "We're going to have to be that much tougher next year."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Twin Manager Ron Gardenhire had many decisions to make Sunday, but
every one of them worked out.</TE>
<TE>   He started right-handed-hitting Matthew LeCroy at designated
hitter against Mulder, and LeCroy had two singles and a run batted
in, then went to left-handed designated hitter David Ortiz, who
knocked in what would be the eventual winning run with a double in
the ninth against right-handed closer Billy Koch.</TE>
<TE>   Gardenhire pulled starter Brad Radke with one on and two out in
the seventh for left-hander J.C. Romero, who retired Terrence Long on
a grounder to first.</TE>
<TE>   With a runner on and two out in the eighth, Gardenhire summoned
LaTroy Hawkins to face Tejada, even though Romero struck out Tejada
in the eighth inning of Game 1 and Tejada had a career .409 average
against Hawkins. Good move. Hawkins struck out Tejada.</TE>
<TE>   The toughest move was one Gardenhire didn't make. He stuck with
closer Eddie Guardado, even after the left-hander, who gave up two
walk-off home runs in Oakland this season, to Tejada and Olmedo
Saenz, was tagged for four hits, including Mark Ellis' three-run
homer, in the ninth. Guardado retired Ray Durham to end the game.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the hardest decision I've had all year, it was very
tough," Gardenhire said. "Eddie's given us heart attacks all year,
but he's been our man."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Twins' postgame celebration could cost them utility player
Denny Hocking. Hocking, who started at second base Sunday and had a
double and single in four at-bats, had the middle finger of his right
hand stepped on in the pile of players near the mound.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, we haven't figured out this celebration thing,"
Hocking said. "It's bittersweet. It's not broken, but it will
probably need stitches. The trainer said I might be out for the year.
It looks bleak."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gardenhire didn't announce his AL championship series rotation,
but right-hander Joe Mays, who was rocked for six runs and nine hits
in 3 2/3 innings in Game 2 of the division series, probably will
start Game 1 on Tuesday night.</TE>
<TE>   Right-hander Rick Reed probably will start in Game 2, left-hander
Eric Milton in Game 3 and Radke in Game 4.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Philadelphia football fairy tale:</LD>
<LD>   The outlook wasn't brilliant for the Eagles on this day.</LD>
<LD>   Down by 10 to the Jaguars--can you believe?--and just 40 seconds
to play.</LD>
<TE>   Desperate for a savior, they turned to their $115-million man.</TE>
<TE>   Name's McNabb, and if he can't do it,</TE>
<TE>   There's a good chance nobody can.</TE>
<TE>   Call the Eagles crazy, for all that money spent.</TE>
<TE>   But if you saw Philly's offense without him,</TE>
<TE>   You'd know he's worth every cent.</TE>
<TE>   So he stepped to the line of scrimmage.</TE>
<TE>   This is why they pay him a bunch.</TE>
<TE>   He barked out the signals,</TE>
<TE>   Took a step away from center,</TE>
<TE>   And promptly lost his lunch.</TE>
<TE>   What, you were expecting a happy ending?</TE>
<TE>   They weren't in Philadelphia, where for decades the sports fan
credo has been: Always expect the worst. That way, you're never
disappointed.</TE>
<TE>   Eagle quarterback Donovan McNabb is the richest player in
professional football. Probably deservedly so--the case can be made
that the league could do away with the annual voting and just ship
him the most valuable trophy every December.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday, for the most part, was a fairly typical day for McNabb. He
passed for 230 yards, ran for another 100 and had a sure touchdown
pass dropped in the end zone. The man doesn't get a lot of help, and
on a hot afternoon in Jacksonville, Fla., the Jaguars had him
scrambling all day. They sacked McNabb five times, kept the pressure
on, ran him ragged for four quarters until, with the clock running
down and the game on the line, McNabb could only drop back and watch
his pregame meal get flushed from the pocket, so to speak, right
there on the field.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just a gut feeling," Jacksonville Coach Tom Coughlin said,
except he was referring to the Jaguars' fourth-and-one fourth-quarter
gamble that led to a touchdown in his team's 28-25 upset of the
Eagles.</TE>
<TE>   McNabb, who had a 20-minute appointment with an IV bag immediately
after the game, said he'd been fighting a queasy stomach all day and
was hoping to tough it out till the end, but the stress eventually
caught up with him.</TE>
<TE>   That's one way to release NFL game-day pressure. Arizona kicker
Bill Gramatica has come up with another, and the last time he tried
it out before Sunday, he wound up on injured reserve.</TE>
<TE>   Gramatica tore knee ligaments last December while leaping and
misjudging his landing after converting a first-quarter field goal.
See, the Cardinals don't score that many points. Given an off-season
and one month to recover, Gramatica was able to line up a more
important kick--from 50 yards, with 16 seconds left and the score
tied--and drilled it, enabling the Cardinals to beat Carolina, 16-13,
for their third victory in five games this season.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, the Cardinals are 3-2. That might not seem like a big deal in
Oakland or Miami, but in Arizona, the Cardinals have not been 3-2
since 1991, which explains Coach Dave McGinnis' rather excited
postgame reaction: "This is exactly what I envisioned 18 months ago
when I started putting these guys together. We've got an open date
and we're 3-2 and that's sweet, sweet, sweet!"</TE>
<TE>   Taking his cue from his coach, Gramatica went airborne once more
after his winning kick. Not a season-threatening swoop. Just a
cautious hop--although not cautious enough to prevent several
Cardinal coaches from glaring, bug-eyed, at Gramatica and getting in
his facemask once he returned to the sideline.</TE>
<TE>   Sorry, Gramatica said, "I couldn't help it. I just jumped."</TE>
<TE>   It's an emotional sport. And in Oakland and Tampa, Fla., emotions
had been decidedly mixed after the Buccaneers traded their
future--two first-round and two second-round draft picks--for the
Raiders' past--Coach Jon Gruden. Post-trade through preseason, both
teams were confronted by more questions than solutions.</TE>
<TE>   Had the Buccaneers given up too much?</TE>
<TE>   Why would a smart coach such as Gruden want to join a team that
had just blown out the first two rounds of its next two drafts?</TE>
<TE>   How badly would the Raiders flail without Gruden's emotional
charge, with a nondescript assistant coach named Bill Callahan taking
his place?</TE>
<TE>   Here's how both cities are coming to grips with their feelings:</TE>
<TE>   The Raiders are off to their first 4-0 start since 1990 after a
wild 49-31 shootout victory in Buffalo. That's 49 points seven days
after scoring 52 against Tennessee--a lot of end-zone frolicking for
old bones and joints that supposedly were clogging up the Raiders'
offensive roster.</TE>
<TE>   And the Buccaneers, who have convinced themselves the future is
now, are 4-1 after a 20-6 defeat of the Atlanta Falcons, with Gruden
recasting himself as, of all things, a defensive hard-nose. That used
to be a criticism lodged against Gruden's predecessor, Tony Dungy,
who was too one-dimensional and couldn't devise an offensive scheme
to make proper use of wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday in Atlanta, Gruden was all things to all Buccaneer fans.
His team scored its fourth defensive touchdown in as many games, has
not yielded a touchdown on the road so far this season ... and found
a way to get Keyshawn the damn ball in the end zone for once. Johnson
scored on a 76-yard touchdown pass from Brad Johnson, his first
touchdown of 2002, equaling his scoring output for all of last
season.</TE>
<TE>   The Raiders are the league's last remaining undefeated team, with
San Diego finding the 4-0 altitude too steep in Denver and losing to
the Broncos, 26-9. It was bound to happen sometime, leaving the
Chargers and the Broncos 4-1, a record matched by Miami after the
Dolphins dealt New England its second consecutive defeat, 26-13,
behind Ricky Williams' fourth 100-yard rushing performance in five
games.</TE>
<TE>   So the Raiders are 4-0 and averaging more points a game--41--than
the average age of their starting wide receivers (38). And the
Buccaneers are 4-1 with a defense that has allowed only 27 points in
its last four games.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine that: Gruden to Tampa, a trade that has helped both teams.</TE>
<TE>   It's probably the last thing both cities expected to hear, and
certainly the last thing Al Davis wanted to hear.</TE>

<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>First there was no strike. That was good.</LD>
<LD>   Now there is this, the Minnesota Twins and Angels playing in the
American League championship series. This is great.</LD>
<LD>   The Twins hung on, barely, and beat the Oakland A's, 5-4, Sunday
in Game 5 of the AL division series, earning themselves a spot with
the Angels in the league championship series.</LD>
<TE>   There can be nothing better for baseball than for fans around the
country to finally see these two teams.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a lot in common," Twin first baseman Doug Mientkiewicz
said. "Us and the Angels, we play the game right. You ask Tim Salmon
to sacrifice in Game 7 of this series, he'll do it and he won't
complain. You ask Brad Radke and Jarrod Washburn to come out of the
bullpen, they'll do it.</TE>
<TE>   "You watch this series, you'll see bunts and sacrifices, small
ball, guys doing all the little things your coaches used to try to
teach you. It'll be great."</TE>
<TE>   The Twins played for themselves, Radke said, played for each other
and for the fans of Minneapolis, of Minnesota, of the upper Midwest,
who were angry and sad, discouraged and fighting mad.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago it seemed the Twins would disappear, sold as spare
parts, picked apart by the vultures of Major League Baseball in the
name of contraction. The New York Yankees and Atlanta Braves and
Dodgers, they would have been bidding for Radke.</TE>
<TE>   But it wouldn't have been fun, Radke said, pitching for the
Yankees or Braves or Dodgers or whoever would have picked Radke from
the Twins' carcass. He wouldn't have been playing with his no-name
buddies, with Mientkiewicz and A.J. Pierzynski, with Michael Cuddyer
and Cristian Guzman and Corey Koskie, he wouldn't be in the rotation
with Joe Mays and Eric Milton, he wouldn't have Eddie Guardado saving
his wins.</TE>
<TE>   "You look around this room," Radke said, "yeah, we would have all
had jobs, but we wouldn't have this."</TE>
<TE>   It's not that the Twins aren't supposed to be in the AL
championship series. It's that the Twins shouldn't be at all.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody wanted us gone but us," Mientkiewicz said. "The guys in
this room, we wanted to stay together. For one reason. For this."</TE>
<TE>   Carl Pohlad, the 80-something owner of the Twins who desperately
wanted to sell the Twins to somebody, anybody, contract and go away,
toddled into the Twin clubhouse 35 minutes after the celebration had
begun. He fit in about as well as Michael Eisner did in the Angel
clubhouse Saturday, another wealthy man who wants to dump his team.
Outfielder Jacque Jones came up behind Pohlad and sprinkled some
champagne on the old man's back.</TE>
<TE>   "You need some of this," Jones said. "Thank you, young man,"
Pohlad said.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, Pohlad was pretty much ignored. He still is possibly
the most unpopular man in Minneapolis-St. Paul, blamed for trying to
dump the Twins.</TE>
<TE>   Radke is as popular as Pohlad is unpopular. Radke might very well
have saved baseball in Minnesota. When the Twins were dreadful,
piling up last-place finishes for Pohlad, who said five times in two
minutes Sunday that, "I love young guys because they play hard,"
Radke signed a four-year contract extension.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the one who gave us authority," Twin Manager Ron Gardenhire
said. "When Brad said he wanted to stay here, it meant a lot of his
good friends on this team wanted to stay, some of the other pitchers,
some of the other young guys. It showed that this organization had
some commitment to it. It said that baseball belonged in this
community."</TE>
<TE>   Radke, much like Angel ace Washburn, was scouted by, drafted by
and groomed by the Twins. He won 20 games in 1997 but also had five
losing seasons before going 15-11 last year and 9-5 this year. (He
missed all of June and July with a groin pull.) Still, during the
losing years, when the Twins were 144 games under .500 during six
seasons, Radke was only six games under .500.</TE>
<TE>   "Brad never let the losing change his focus," Mientkiewicz said,
"and he always felt committed to this team and our town. He wanted to
win for the fans in Minnesota. It means a lot to him, just like it
means a lot for Salmon to win for Anaheim."</TE>
<TE>   Radke, who pitched 6 2/3 innings of one-run baseball Sunday on
three days' rest, has owned the Angels. He is 11-4 with a 1.72
earned-run average against them and 6-1 with a 1.38 ERA at Edison
Field, where Radke might get the start in Game 3. But that was too
far ahead for Radke to look, while champagne was still flooding his
eyes and the ice pack on his shoulder hadn't begun to melt.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's talk about the Angels later," he said. "Let's talk about us
now."</TE>
<TE>   Mientkiewicz was eager to talk about the Twins and the Angels.
"This is great for baseball," he said. "It shows it's not all about
the money."</TE>
<TE>   Mientkiewicz played in college for Florida State while Angel
shortstop David Eckstein was playing for Florida. "We hated each
other," Mientkiewicz said, laughing.</TE>
<TE>   "But, really, he's like the Angels and I'm like the Twins," he
said. "I can tell you there wasn't a scout in major league baseball
who didn't look Eckstein in the eye and tell him, 'Son, you're not
going to make it.' Just like me.</TE>
<TE>   "And there's not a person around right now, outside of our
clubhouse and theirs, who can look you in the eye and say he thought
the Twins and Angels would be in the AL finals."</TE>

<KH>OAKLAND 49, BUFFALO 31</KH>
<HD>A Raider Return Trip to the Victory Column</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ORCHARD PARK, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>Cornerback Phillip Buchanon wasn't going to miss the same pass twice.</LD>
<LD>   Moments after allowing a pass by Drew Bledsoe to slip through his
hands, Buchanon intercepted the next one and ran it back 81 yards for
a touchdown, sparking the Oakland Raiders to a 49-31 win over the
Buffalo Bills on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Oakland (4-0) is the NFL's only unbeaten team, following San
Diego's 26-9 loss to Denver. The Raiders matched the best start in
franchise history, last going 4-0 in 1990.</LD>
<TE>   They have Buchanon to thank.</TE>
<TE>   "The first time it happened, I dropped the ball, and I was like,
'Dang, that was the play,' " Buchanon said. "Then something told me,
'Don't worry about it.' "</TE>
<TE>   Buchanon's interception, the second of his rookie season since
taking over for injured starter Charles Woodson, was the key in a
matchup between two of the NFL's most potent offenses, which combined
for 974 yards.</TE>
<TE>   The interception came with Oakland clinging to a 35-31 lead and
Bledsoe orchestrating another scoring threat with eight minutes left.</TE>
<TE>   After almost being intercepted by Buchanon on the previous down,
Bledsoe tried the same play on third and eight at Oakland's 27.
Bledsoe rolled to his right and had Peerless Price open in the flat
when Buchanon leaped and grabbed the ball. He ran it back along the
left sideline.</TE>
<TE>   On Oakland's next possession, Rich Gannon passed to Jerry Rice for
a 20-yard touchdown to seal the victory.</TE>
<TE>   Gannon completed 23 of 38 passes for 357 yards. Charlie Garner had
94 yards rushing and scored two touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Bledsoe and the Bills (2-3) finally ran out of late-game dramatics
after becoming the first team to open an NFL season by having three
of their first four games decided in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Bledsoe was 32 for 53 for 417 yards and two touchdowns, recording
his second 400-yard passing game of the season and sixth of his
career. But he was undone by three interceptions, two of which led to
touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just a poor play on my part," he said of Buchanon's
interception.</TE>
<TE>   Price led Buffalo with 126 yards receiving and a touchdown. Dave
Moore, Travis Henry and Larry Centers also scored touchdowns, while
Mike Hollis made a 30-yard field goal for a Bill team that's
averaging almost 33 points a game.</TE>
<TE>   But Buffalo wasn't helped by a defense that has yet to show it can
contain an opponent.</TE>
<TE>   After allowing the Raiders 495 yards, Buffalo is giving up
averages of 358 yards and 36 points a game.</TE>

<KH>WASHINGTON 31, TENNESSEE 14</KH>
<HD>A Star Is Born for Spurrier</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NASHVILLE</DL>
<LD>Steve Spurrier hopes his third quarterback of the season will be his
last.</LD>
<LD>   Rookie Patrick Ramsey came off the bench and threw for 268 yards
and two touchdowns as the Washington Redskins bounced back after two
straight losses to beat the Tennessee Titans, 31-14, Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Danny Wuerffel made his first NFL start in four years, but the
1996 Heisman Trophy winner lasted only one series before leaving
because of an injured right shoulder. Spurrier sent in Ramsey, and
the rookie didn't give his coach any reason to turn to Shane
Matthews, who had started the first three games.</LD>
<TE>   "We don't have to write about who's going to play quarterback for
a while," Spurrier said. "He's our guy. Hopefully, he can stay
healthy and keep getting better and go the distance."</TE>
<TE>   Ramsey, a first-round draft pick out of Tulane, easily handled
pressure from the blitzing Titans (1-4). He rallied the Redskins
(2-2) from a 14-10 halftime deficit by leading them to two touchdowns
in the third quarter to clinch the victory.</TE>
<TE>   He also impressed Spurrier, which isn't easy to do.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know that he could step up in there with guys flying
around him and make the throws he did. That was crucial," the coach
said. "Anybody who says it doesn't matter who plays back there is
wrong."</TE>
<TE>   "He avoided the rush here and there, stepped up and hit a lot of
good third-down plays, kept drives going. I didn't know he could do
that. None of us did," Spurrier added. "We knew he could look good in
practice, but the game's a different story. He proved to us he could
play."</TE>
<TE>   Ramsey was 20 for 34, and Washington rolled up 442 yards. Stephen
Davis ran for a touchdown and caught another despite spraining a
ligament in his right knee at the end of the first quarter. He
returned in the third quarter, with the knee tightly taped, and
finished with 90 yards in 18 carries.</TE>
<TE>   The game featured two of the NFL's worst defenses, but the
Redskins played much better, coming up with four turnovers and four
sacks. They held Tennessee to 289 total yards.</TE>
<TE>   The Titans lost their fourth straight game and matched their worst
start since relocating to Tennessee in 1997. They also blew a
second-half lead for the third time during the skid and had fans
booing loudly as they struggled.</TE>
<TE>   "I apologize for the effort and the outcome," Coach Jeff Fisher
said.</TE>

<HD>Rolen May Have to Sit Out NLCS</HD>

<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>Third baseman Scott Rolen of the St. Louis Cardinals could not raise
his arm at the shoulder and had limited movement of his forearm after
sustaining multiple sprains that could keep him out of the National
League championship series, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported
Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "It still hurts pretty bad," Rolen said.</LD>
<LD>   The Cardinals open the NLCS Wednesday night.</LD>
<TE>   Rolen injured his left shoulder during Thursday night's playoff
game against the Arizona Diamondbacks, including a severe
hyperextension of the three ligaments supporting his clavicle, the
newspaper reported, citing unidentified sources familiar with tests
performed Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Rolen, injured in a collision with Diamondback pinch-runner Alex
Cintron, underwent an MRI that lasted more than two hours. The exam
revealed sprains in four regions of his shoulder and collarbone.</TE>
<TE>   He said surgery is not being considered.</TE>
<TE>   "To put it at seven days, 10 days or 14 days is a bit premature,"
Rolen said before Saturday night's 6-3 victory in Game 3 of the
division series.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, I'm just waiting for it stop hurting. I'm looking to
make progress day by day. It's kind of hard to think about playing
when it feels like this."</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal Manager Tony La Russa said the MRI agreed with the
original diagnosis "that there wasn't a serious injury there ... that
would require surgery. It's a sprained shoulder and there isn't any
permanent-type damage that we found or anything like that."</TE>

<KH>NEW ORLEANS 32, PITTSBURGH 29</KH>
<HD>Saints Keep Calling Deuce's Number in Win</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>The Pittsburgh Steelers haven't stopped anybody all season, and Deuce
McAllister was no different.</LD>
<LD>   The second-year running back rushed for 123 yards and two
touchdowns in 23 carries as the New Orleans Saints held off
Pittsburgh, 32-29, Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a very poor defensive effort," Steeler Coach Bill Cowher
said. "There were too many big plays. I don't even think they punted
until the fourth quarter. I'm very disappointed in how we performed
defensively."</LD>
<TE>   The Steelers came in ranked 24th in the NFL in total defense, and
McAllister took advantage. New Orleans (4-1) has won all three games
this season when McAllister runs for 100 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "When you can run your offense and don't have to throw it every
time, they can't tee off on you," McAllister said.</TE>
<TE>   Steeler quarterback Tommy Maddox, the MVP of the XFL in its only
season, made his first NFL start since 1992.</TE>
<TE>   A first-round flop in Denver, Maddox played well in place of the
benched Kordell Stewart, but the Pittsburgh defense was riddled
again.</TE>
<TE>   The Steelers (1-3) were shredded for big passing days by Tom Brady
and Rich Gannon earlier this season.</TE>
<TE>   Saint safety Sammy Knight thwarted a late fourth-quarter drive
when he intercepted Maddox.</TE>
<TE>   The Steelers then drove 47 yards, and Maddox hit Terance Mathis
with a 14-yard touchdown pass. Maddox found Hines Ward for the
two-point conversion to bring Pittsburgh to 32-29 with 1:26 left.</TE>
<TE>   The onside kick was recovered by the Saints, however, and New
Orleans ran out the clock.</TE>
<TE>   Maddox completed 22 of 38 passes for a career-high 268 yards and
three touchdowns. He was intercepted once and sacked four times.</TE>
<TE>   "For whatever reason, we were able to make third downs," Maddox
said. "We feel good about ourselves. When you stay on the field
you're able to see things better and make big plays."</TE>
<TE>   New Orleans' Aaron Brooks was 14 for 24 for 207 yards and a
touchdown. He was sacked twice.</TE>
<TE>   The Steelers finally got their running game going after averaging
79.7 yards coming in. Jerome Bettis ran for 84 yards and a touchdown
on 19 carries, and Pittsburgh gained 120 yards on the ground.</TE>

<HD>More Williams Is Better for the Dolphins</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Houston Mitchell</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ricky Williams is sure of this: A team's winning percentage increases
with the number of rushing attempts, and the Miami Dolphins have a
victory to prove it.</LD>
<LD>   Williams ran 36 times for 105 yards in Miami's 26-13 win over New
England on Sunday, setting a franchise record for attempts in a game
and leaving him one 100-yard game shy of tying the single-season
mark.</LD>
<LD>   He did it despite a Patriot defense designed to shut him down.</LD>
<TE>   "Whenever you play a Bill Belichick-coached team, you know they're
going to punch you in the mouth," center Tim Ruddy said. "They
stacked the line a lot on us, but we knew the running game had to be
successful for us to win."</TE>
<TE>   And it was.</TE>
<TE>   Williams carried 15 times for 49 yards in the first half, then got
a much-tougher 56 yards in 21 attempts in the second half--running
when Miami had a 23-6 lead and when New England knew it was coming.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not always being able to get the yards," Williams said.
"When you run the ball, it is also taking time off the clock."</TE>
<TE>   It was something they weren't able to do last week against Kansas
City. The Chiefs are the only team to hold Williams under 100 yards
this season. The Dolphins were behind most of that game, and they
passed to try to move the ball faster and save the clock.</TE>
<TE>   This game was completely different. Williams was a factor
throughout.</TE>
<TE>   "We're never going to give up on the running game," Ruddy said.
"As the game went on, we were able to figure out what they were doing
and had some success with the basic stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Williams' only mistake was his second fumble in as many games--a
problem that plagued him in New Orleans. He fumbled on the opening
drive of the second half, and the Patriots turned it into a touchdown
to cut the lead to 16-6.</TE>
<TE>   His fourth 100-yard game of the season left him one shy of Delvin
Williams' team record, set in 1978. His 36 carries broke Karim
Abdul-Jabbar's regular-season record of 33 attempts set in 1998, but
they were four shy of Lamar Smith's record set in the playoffs in
2000.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Emmitt Smith of the Dallas Cowboys ran for 70 yards against the
New York Giants, putting him within 234 yards of breaking the NFL
career rushing record held by Walter Payton.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's key injuries:</TE>
<TE>   * Atlanta might be without quarterback Michael Vick after he
sprained his right shoulder. Vick injured his non-throwing shoulder
when he was sacked by Simeon Rice. X-rays were negative.</TE>
<TE>   * The Raiders lost leading rusher Charlie Garner early in the
fourth quarter. Garner, who ran for 94 yards, strained his left
hamstring after scoring on a 69-yard pass play.</TE>
<TE>   * Washington starting quarterback Danny Wuerffel injured his
throwing shoulder. Wuerffel gave way to rookie Patrick Ramsey.</TE>
<TE>   * Saints' linebacker Travis Carroll broke his right leg in New
Orleans' victory.</TE>
<TE>   * San Francisco lost receiver J.J. Stokes, who sprained his right
knee in the second quarter.</TE>

<HD>Cisse Returns Home After Relatives Die</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Aliou Cisse, the midfielder who captained Senegal into the second
round of the World Cup, has left his English club, Birmingham City,
and returned home after losing nine members of his family in a ferry
disaster in which nearly 1,000 people drowned.</LD>
<LD>   The ferry Joola capsized during a storm and sank Sept. 26 off the
African coast while en route from the river port of Ziguinchor,
Senegal, to Dakar, the capital. Cisse did not learn the extent of his
loss until later.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a terrible tragedy for Aliou," Birmingham City Coach Steve
Bruce said after Cisse had played in the team's 2-1 victory over West
Ham United on Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   "Just to turn up and play today shows a massive commitment and
great mental strength.</TE>
<TE>   "He did not even tell us about it until [Friday] when he was
arranging his flights.... The whole thing certainly puts football
into perspective."</TE>
<TE>   The national teams of Nigeria and Senegal will play a charity
match in Dakar on Saturday to aid the victims' families.</TE>
<TE>   Ronaldo's Real Debut</TE>
<TE>   Brazil World Cup winner Ronaldo made his long-awaited debut for
Real Madrid on Sunday and scored twice as the European champions
defeated Alaves, 5-2, in a Spanish league game in front of a sellout
crowd of 75,000 at Santiago Bernabeu stadium in Madrid.</TE>
<TE>   Celtic-Rangers Tie</TE>
<TE>   Celtic and Rangers, Scotland's two biggest clubs, played to an
absorbing 3-3 tie in Glasgow on Sunday in the first "Old Firm"
meeting this year between the rivals, but none of the goals was
scored by a Scot.</TE>
<TE>   The match drew 59,027 to Parkhead and was televised live
throughout Britain for the first time. The lead changed hands three
times.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Women Win Cup</TE>
<TE>   Goals in a 13-minute span in the second half by Kristine Lilly,
Heather O'Reilly, Joy Fawcett and Brandi Chastain earned the United
States women's national team a 4-0 victory Sunday over Italy at Cary,
N.C.</TE>
<TE>   The victory gave the Americans their eighth consecutive U.S.
Women's Cup title.</TE>
<TE>   Galaxy Thanks Fans</TE>
<TE>   There was good reason the Galaxy players stayed on the Rose Bowl
field long after Saturday night's 4-0 Major League Soccer playoff
semifinal victory over the Colorado Rapids: It might have been the
team's last game at Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy moves to Carson next season and the players wanted to
thank the 24,742 who turned out.</TE>
<TE>   "When you get 24,000 people out here creating atmosphere, you want
to thank them," captain Cobi Jones said.</TE>

<KH>NHL PREVIEW / WESTERN CONFERENCE</KH>
<HD>Ice in West Should Be Pretty Hot</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LONNIE WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you're looking for excitement, pay attention to the Western
Conference. With several teams ready to knock off the Stanley Cup
champion Detroit Red Wings, the West is not a conference for the
weak. Even the Ducks are taken seriously these days.</LD>
<LD>   But along with excitement, there also are a good deal of
questions. How will the aging Red Wings respond under new Coach Dave
Lewis? Can the San Jose Sharks take the next step? Will a healthy
Peter Forsberg carry the Colorado Avalanche back to the top? Will
Calgary's Jarome Iginla repeat as scoring champion?</LD>
<LD>   Those are just some of the hot topics heading into a season that
is expected to be one of the best in years. But the team to beat will
once again be the Red Wings, who won their 10th Stanley Cup title
last year but will be without legendary coach Scotty Bowman and
goaltender Dominik Hasek, both of whom have retired.</LD>
<TE>   Lewis, a longtime assistant under Bowman, and Curtis Joseph, who
took less money to sign as a free agent with Detroit to replace
Hasek, definitely will feel the pressure.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Wings still are loaded with talent headed by veterans
Nicklas Lidstrom, Chris Chelios, Sergei Fedorov, Igor Larionov, Brett
Hull and Steve Yzerman. Add up-and-coming players such as Pavel
Datsyuk and Jiri Fischer and it's easy to understand why Detroit is
still a favorite.</TE>
<TE>   But the strongest team in the West may be Colorado, which lost in
seven games to Detroit in the conference finals last season. The
Avalanche will be stronger with Forsberg available for a full season
and the recent trade for talented defenseman Derek Morris. Don't
forget, Colorado Coach Bob Hartley still has Joe Sakic, Patrick Roy,
Rob Blake and Adam Foote to work with too.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Capsules in predicted order of finish:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   1. COLORADO</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Bob Hartley, fifth season.</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 45-28-8-1, 99 points; first in Northwest Division,
second in conference.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Forward Steve Reinprecht stepped up in the
playoffs and helped make Chris Drury expendable.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Forsberg's play in the playoffs after sitting out the
regular season proved he's the game's most dominating player. It may
be smart for Hartley to limit Forsberg's playing time to make sure
he's healthy for the playoffs. Roy is still one of the NHL's top
netminders and the addition of Morris makes Blake and Foote even
better. The key to the season will be if young players such as Radim
Vrbata and Reinprecht can take the next step.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   2. DETROIT</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Dave Lewis, first season.</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 51-17-10-4, 116 points; first in Central Division,
first in conference.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Defenseman Nicklas Lidstrom won second
consecutive Norris Trophy and was named MVP of playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Goalie Joseph should do well with the Red Wings, who have
such a strong supporting cast. But because Yzerman will be out until
at least February after off-season knee surgery, the Wings will not
be as dominant as last season when they won the Presidents' Trophy
for the league's best record. Look for Lewis not to rely so heavily
on veterans such as Chelios, Larionov, Hull and Luc Robitaille during
the regular season in order to give more playing time to younger
players.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   3. SAN JOSE</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Darryl Sutter, sixth season.</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 44-27-8-3, 99 points; first in Pacific Division,
third in conference.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Forward Owen Nolan led the Sharks in scoring for
the fourth time in seven seasons in 2001-02.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Expectations are high for the Sharks, but goaltender
Evgeni Nabokov is still unsigned. Backup Miikka Kiprusoff is solid
but the Sharks will need Nabokov in order to be a legitimate Stanley
Cup threat. Brad Stuart leads an outstanding group of defensemen and
Mike Ricci, Vincent Damphousse, Teemu Selanne and Nolan head a
balanced offense for the Sharks, who have improved record-wise for
seven consecutive seasons.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   4. DALLAS</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Dave Tippett, first season.</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 36-28-13-5, 90 points; fourth in Pacific Division,
10th in conference.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Forward Bill Guerin signed as a free agent with
the Stars after scoring 41 goals for Boston last season.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Perhaps no team changed as much as the Stars, who will
feature a high-powered offense under Tippett, a former King
assistant. Goodbye to Joe Nieuwendyk, Jamie Langenbrunner, Randy
McKay, Donald Audette, Martin Rucinsky, Roman Lyashenko and Brad
Lukowich. Hello to Guerin, Phillipe Boucher, Scott Young, Jason
Arnott and Manny Malholtra. The Stars, however, will go only as far
as goalies Marty Turco and veteran Ron Tugnutt will take them.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   5. VANCOUVER</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Marc Crawford, fifth season.</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 42-30-7-3, 94 points; second in Northwest
Division, eighth in conference.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Forward Todd Bertuzzi is coming off a career high
36-goal, 85-point season.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: A horrific first half nearly crushed the Canucks' playoff
hopes last season until they rallied to sneak into the postseason. In
the playoffs, Vancouver had Detroit on the ropes before running out
of gas. The Canucks will be loaded again with forwards Markus
Naslund, Trevor Linden and Bertuzzi the big men offensively.
Defenseman Ed Jovanovski set a career-high in points for the second
consecutive season. Dan Cloutier has emerged as a dependable goalie.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   6. ST. LOUIS</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Joel Quenneville, seventh season.</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 43-27-8-4, 98 points; second in Central Division,
fourth in conference.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Forward Pavol Demitra has 287 points in his last
279 games, including 35 goals and 78 points last season.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: The Blues have plenty of big time scorers in Keith
Tkachuk, Doug Weight and Demitra, but they're thin up front after
that. The same holds true on defense after all-stars Al MacInnis and
Chris Pronger. But the biggest question mark is in goal with Brent
Johnson, who showed sparks of greatness but still struggled at times
last season. Quenneville is the franchise's all-time leader in games
coached and victories.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   7. KINGS</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Andy Murray, fourth season.</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 40-27-11-4, 95 points; third in Pacific, seventh
in conference.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Forward Jason Allison had 19 goals and 74 points
in 73 games.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Goaltender Felix Potvin's 2.31 goals-against average was
his lowest in the NHL but backup Jamie Storr was even better at 1.90.
They will have be a force again this season for the Kings, who have
dropped a notch defensively with the departure of Phillipe Boucher.
In Ziggy Palffy, Adam Deadmarsh and Allison, the Kings have three of
the best forwards in the league. For the Kings to gain home-ice
advantage in the playoffs, they will need Bryan Smolinski and Steve
Heinze to regain their scoring touch.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   8. CHICAGO</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Brian Sutter, second season.</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 41-27-13-1, 96 points; third in Central Division,
fifth in conference.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Forward Eric Daze finally played up to his
potential last season with a career high in goals with 38.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: After a five-year drought, the Blackhawks returned to the
playoffs last season, and are hoping to build on that promising
performance. With Theo Fleury, a free agent signee, joining Alexei
Zhamnov, Steve Sullivan, Eric Daze, Michael Nylander and Kyle Calder
up front, Chicago should score a lot of goals. Phil Housley is the
Blackhawks' top scoring defenseman but they are steady enough to
complement goaltender Jocelyn Thibault.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   9. PHOENIX</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Bobby Francis, fourth season.</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 40-27-9-6, 95 points, second in Pacific Division,
sixth in conference.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Forward Tony Amonte re-signed with the Blackhawks
and holds the NHL's longest active consecutive games streak at 410.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Don't count out one of the hardest-working teams in the
league. Francis has installed a system that brought the best out of
players such as Daniel Briere, Daymond Langkow and Danny Markov.
Goaltending should remain a strong point, thanks to veteran Sean
Burke and newly acquired Brian Boucher. The defense has a strong mix
of experience with Teppo Numminen and Markov teamed up with youth in
Paul Mara and Ossi Vaananen.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   10. EDMONTON</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Craig MacTavish, third season.</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 38-28-12-4, 92 points; third in Northwest
Division, ninth in conference.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Forward Anson Carter is coming off a career
season with 28 goals and 22 assists.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Edmonton needs winger Ryan Smyth to stay healthy and
Carter's second line to become more consistent. On defense, the
threesome of Janne Niimimaa, Eric Brewer and Jason Smith remains one
of the best in the league, but they'll have to splitting more of the
workload with the trade of Tom Poti. Goaltender Tommy Salo needs to
have a better season than he did a year ago in order for the Oilers
to earn a postseason berth.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   11. CALGARY</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Greg Gilbert, second season.</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 32-35-12-3, 79 points; fourth in Northwest
Division, 11th in conference.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Forward Jarome Iginla is looking to improve on
his league-leading 52 goals and 96 points from last season.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Re-signing Iginla kept hope alive for the Flames, who
have not made the playoffs since 1995-96. But Calgary still lacks
enough scoring punch beyond Iginla to reach the postseason. Picking
up Chris Drury from Colorado will help but giving up defenseman Derek
Morris may have been too much of a gamble. Goaltender Roman Turek was
a workhorse last season and finished with a decent 2.53 goals-against
average.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   12. MIGHTY DUCKS</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Mike Babcock, first season.</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 29-42-8-3, 69 points; fifth in Pacific Division,
13th in conference.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Forward Petr Sykora, acquired in a trade with New
Jersey, should help the Ducks' scoring: he has averaged 28 goals and
67 points over the last four seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: By adding veterans Adam Oates and Sykora along with
Russian rookie Stanislav Chistov, the Ducks took some pressure off
Paul Kariya, who had only 32 goals and 57 points last season.
Goaltender Jean-Sebastien Giguere is solid and the defense will be
led by steady Keith Carney, who finished with a plus-14 plus/minus
last season despite the Ducks' losing record.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   13. COLUMBUS</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Dave King, third season.</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 22-47-8-5, 57 points; fifth in Central Division,
15th in conference.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Forward Ray Whitney led the Blue Jackets in
scoring last season with 61 points despite missing 15 games.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: The Blue Jackets did well in picking up free agents Scott
Lachance, Luke Richardson and Andrew Cassels and drafting Rick Nash
with the No. 1 overall pick. But Columbus still has questions with
Marc Denis, who has yet to prove he can perform as a starting
goaltender. The depth on defense, featuring Richardson, Lachance and
promising Rostislav Klesla, has improved, but the Blue Jackets do not
have much depth to go with Espen Knutsen, Mike Sillinger and Whitney.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   14. MINNESOTA</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Jacques Lemaire, third season.</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 26-35-12-9, 73 points; fifth in Northwest
Division, 12th in conference.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Forward Marian Gaborik led the Wild with 30 goals
last season.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: It may have gone unnoticed outside of Minnesota, but the
Wild improved noticeably last season and have a future all-star in
Gaborik, who nearly doubled his point total last season from his
rookie season two years ago. But other than Andrew Brunette and
former King Cliff Ronning, Minnesota is weak up front. But Lemaire
always has his teams play hard and may win more games if goaltenders
Manny Fernandez or Dwayne Roloson can step up.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   15. NASHVILLE</TE>
<TE>   Coach: Barry Trotz, fifth season.</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 28-41-13-0, 69 points; fourth in Central Division,
14th in conference.</TE>
<TE>   Player to watch: Goaltender Mike Dunham set career highs with 23
victories and a 2.61 goals-against average last season.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: There's a lot riding on this season for the club, even to
the point of their ownership offering partial refunds to
season-ticket holders if the Predators fail to make the playoffs,
which is very likely. For Nashville to take the next step to playoff
contention, they must have improved performances from forwards Denis
Arkhipov, David Legwand, and Scott Hartnell, while sophomores Martin
Erat and Vladimir Orszagh must build on their rookie campaigns.</TE>
