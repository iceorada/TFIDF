<HD>O'Reilly Is Factoring In a Few New Fights--With the Right</HD>
<DH>Television* The Fox News talk-show host is taking
unexpected sides. As he upsets his core audience, he's getting more
e-mail and adding more viewers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID BAUDER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>There's nothing unusual about pugnacious talk-show host Bill
O'Reilly's being in a fight. The real surprise this time is the one
he's fighting.</LD>
<LD>   In the last two weeks, O'Reilly has come under attack from the
right, from the same ideologues who helped make the Fox News Channel
personality one of the most popular figures on cable television.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier this month on "The O'Reilly Factor," he had a riveting
confrontation with Bible-toting Stephen Bennett, a Connecticut
minister who speaks out against the adoption of children by gays and
lesbians.</LD>
<TE>   After O'Reilly called Bennett a "religious fanatic," two
conservative groups, Concerned Women for America and the American
Family Assn., urged members to protest.</TE>
<TE>   "I got 100 e-mails telling me I'm going to hell," O'Reilly said.
"That's a little personal."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the Wall Street Journal--normally friendly "Factor"
territory--published a column by its chief editorial writer, William
McGurn, who called O'Reilly "unhinged" for his behavior toward the
writer as a guest. His headline: "The Blowhard Zone."</TE>
<TE>   So many battles, so little time. It's not as if he's ignoring
other ends of the spectrum, either. The rapper Ludacris and his fans
are mad because an O'Reilly segment led Pepsi to drop the musician as
a spokesman. O'Reilly's fight with Hollywood personalities over
disbursement of Sept. 11 charity funds continues.</TE>
<TE>   Whether calculated or not, the dispute with conservative groups
may be as shrewd as the actions of a politician who adroitly
positions himself in the center just before an election.</TE>
<TE>   When Bennett went on the show, he tried to appeal to O'Reilly's
Irish Catholicism by reading Bible quotations against homosexuals.</TE>
<TE>   O'Reilly would have none of it. He couldn't understand why Bennett
would object if a troubled child in foster care were adopted by a
loving gay couple. Bennett couldn't understand why O'Reilly was
advocating gay rights.</TE>
<TE>   The Concerned Women for America seemed hurt, as if slapped across
the face by a brother. Writing to O'Reilly to protest, the
organization's president slipped in a proverb: "Faithful are the
wounds of a friend."</TE>
<TE>   "If you do something wrong, if your slip is showing, your family
is the one that rushes to your side and helps you and corrects you,
because they love you," said the organization's president, Sandy
Rios. "He embarrassed himself, and as a friend of his show, I was
embarrassed."</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, McGurn--who appeared on a segment about two women
kidnapped to Saudi Arabia--seemed betrayed.</TE>
<TE>   "I did not come at this as an O'Reilly hater," he wrote. "I regard
Fox News as a national treasure and even wrote a column for this
paper a few years back about Mr. O'Reilly at a time when he was
whining that the New York Times would not even mention his name."</TE>
<TE>   Rios reacted just like an ideological opposite who went on the
show and couldn't get a word in edgewise. "He was completely twisting
the facts," she said. "He manipulated the entire discussion. Even if
he disagrees with Stephen, he should have at least let Stephen have
his say. I would never support anybody, including Bill, who bullies
their guests."</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, O'Reilly sees things differently.</TE>
<TE>   "We've always said, 'Don't let your ideology hold you captive,' "
he said. "Now if they feel betrayed because I make a point that it's
better to have a child with a stable home, even if it's run by
homosexuals, than to be in the unbelievably chaotic atmosphere of
foster care, if they feel that's a betrayal, then that's on them. We
gave them more than enough time to come on the program and explain
their point of view."</TE>
<TE>   People who pigeonhole O'Reilly as a conservative wouldn't have
expected the exchange. A conservative on some issues, he supports gun
control, opposes the death penalty and is an environmentalist at
heart. He fashions himself a populist.</TE>
<TE>   O'Reilly says now what has always been hard for people at Fox News
to admit: that he once had a hard-core right-wing audience.</TE>
<TE>   "I think our audience has changed," he said. "The e-mail reflects
[that] a very wide cross-section of America watches the 'Factor.' "</TE>
<TE>   The ratings do too. O'Reilly routinely has a bigger audience than
cable competitors Connie Chung and Phil Donahue combined. And if he
wants that audience to keep growing, he'd be wise not to be too
predictable.</TE>
<TE>   O'Reilly recently gave an interview to a gay newspaper, the
Advocate, and spoke to a convention of gay and lesbian journalists.</TE>
<TE>   They're by no means allies; the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against
Discrimination disagrees with O'Reilly's opinion that gay people
should keep their sexual preferences to themselves. But GLAAD
appreciates that O'Reilly has backed them on a key issue and knows he
reaches a constituency unlikely to listen to gay activists.</TE>

<HD>NPR Names Correspondent as Co-Host of 'All Things'</HD>
<DH>Radio* Melissa Block, who reported on New York for the
network, will join the show in February.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CARNEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the first time since 1989, National Public Radio on Monday
named a new co-host for its afternoon newsmagazine, "All Things
Considered."</LD>
<LD>Melissa Block, NPR's New York correspondent, will leave behind her
coverage of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, feature
stories about baseball umpires and performance artists, and also end
her maternity leave to join Robert Siegel on the program in February.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a thrill. It's immensely flattering, and going back to the
show is like a homecoming," said Block, 40, who worked behind the
scenes at "All Things Considered" for nine years. "You're given free
reign to exercise your interests, and that's a wonderful thing. There
are very few places in journalism where you can do that."</LD>
<TE>   Siegel, Noah Adams and Linda Wertheimer had co-hosted the program
for 13 years until the network made Wertheimer a roving correspondent
in January. Then Adams left in March, taking a sabbatical to write a
book about the Wright brothers.</TE>
<TE>   The longest-running program in the history of public radio, "All
Things Considered" is now in its 32nd year, and reaches about 12
million listeners per week.</TE>
<TE>   "We went through a long process. Stations and listeners are
counting on us getting this right," said Jay Kernis, NPR's senior
vice president for programming. "She represents the best of public
radio, and what's very special is that she's grown up through the
show."</TE>
<TE>   Block joined NPR just out of college in 1985, when Adams and Susan
Stamberg hosted "All Things Considered."</TE>
<TE>"I've watched and listened and hopefully absorbed some of the
talent they brought to the show," she said, then admitting "I never
pictured myself in that seat."</TE>
<TE>The Brooklyn native started out by setting up interviews
for Adams, and was an editor, director, producer and senior producer on
the program, sharing Overseas Press Club awards with reporters in
1992 and 1994 for their stories about Cambodian refugees and the war
in Bosnia. She shared another of the awards in 1999, when NPR won for
its coverage of the crisis in Kosovo, for her story on the use of
rape as a weapon of war.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, her reporting of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks was
included in coverage that won NPR a Peabody Award. She's also covered
the crash of TWA flight 800, Hillary Rodham Clinton's U.S.
Senate run, police brutality trials and the 2000 election recount, as
well as quirky New York feature stories about a subway aficionado and a
trio of litter fighters who specialize in snagging plastic bags from
treetops, among others.</TE>
<TE>   Kernis said NPR is negotiating with someone from outside
the network to fill the third slot, replacing Adams, and hopes to
finalize that within a month.</TE>
<TE>   "All Things Considered" is heard locally weekdays on
KPCC-FM (89.3) from 3 to 6:30 p.m. and on KCRW-FM (89.9) from 4 to 7 p.m.</TE>

<LD>TORONTO--If you were judging him on his current reputation, Brian De
Palma would barely get a passing grade, especially for most of his
1990s movies, which include such underwhelming fare as "The Bonfire
of the Vanities," "Mission: Impossible," "Snake Eyes" and "Mission to
Mars."</LD>
<LD>   Something of a critic's darling early in his career, when he made
funky comedies and clever horror films, De Palma has become the
personification of a Hollywood hack. As film historian David Thomson
put it: "He's the epitome of mindless style and excitement--he has
contempt for his characters and audiences alike."</LD>
<LD>   But if you were grading the veteran film director on his ardor for
film festivals, he gets an honor roll A. At a cinema bazaar like the
Toronto International Film Festival, which concluded its 10-day run
Saturday with the North American debut of De Palma's new film, "Femme
Fatale," even the most lunatic movie buff would be lucky to see 20
movies in a week, especially if you leave time for eating, sleeping
and celebrating the pleasures of the new Chen Kaige or Pedro
Almodovar film. But by the time I caught up with De Palma, he was
already on pace to reach 30 films before festival's end.</LD>
<TE>   Yes, De Palma has a film to promote, an erotic thriller starring
Rebecca Romijn-Stamos and Antonio Banderas that has a vitality and
verve that hasn't been seen in his films since the days of "Dressed
to Kill" and "Body Double." But the 62-year-old director would be in
Toronto anyway--he's the ultimate festival junkie. His new film even
has a prolonged heist sequence set at Cannes. De Palma is a regular
here and at Cannes, as well as at festivals in Rotterdam, Holland;
Montreal; Venice, Italy; and Berlin.</TE>
<TE>   While other directors here were ferried around in limos,
accompanied by a phalanx of publicists, De Palma was largely
anonymous, attending screenings by himself. When critic Roger Ebert
couldn't get into a screening here one night, he threw what one local
paper called "a hissy fit," nearly causing an international incident.
When De Palma couldn't get into a screening of "Russian Ark," a
Russian-German film shot in one 96-minute take, he simply found
something else to see.</TE>
<TE>   When I beseeched him to see "City of God," a Miramax film from
Brazil that was my favorite festival entry, he brushed it off, saying
he doesn't bother with films that he can eventually see at the
theater around the corner from where he lives in Greenwich Village.
Instead, he sought out obscure work from Iran, Israel and Korea. "I
can't get enough of Korean movies," he said, chastely sipping bottled
water at the bar of the posh King Edward Hotel here. "There's lots of
things happening in these Korean films. I want more--South Korea,
here I come."</TE>
<TE>   Once he did play his director's card. Having already missed Mike
Figgis' film "Hotel" when it played here last September, De Palma
went to a midnight showing in Rotterdam earlier this year. Stuck near
the end of a long line, he began to worry that he'd get shut out
again. Flagging down a young festival staffer, he said, "Could you
give me a break? I'm Brian De Palma." The staffer gave him a
skeptical glance and said, "You're not Brian De Palma."</TE>
<TE>   "They never believe it's me. What would Brian De Palma be doing
standing in line for a midnight showing of a Mike Figgis movie?" He
frowned. "Why is it that I've never seen another director at these
festivals? All I see is people like you."</TE>
<TE>   By "you," De Palma, of course, means his critical detractors. It's
one of the great ironies of his career. His old friend Martin
Scorsese may have seen more movies, but no American director has a
better intellectual grasp of film history than De Palma. Underneath
those khaki bush jackets he's worn for years beats the heart of a
true cinephile. Despite having made a host of enduring films in his
five-decade career, from "Carrie" to "Dressed to Kill" to "The
Untouchables," De Palma has gotten the kind of critical reception
that a wildcat oil driller gets at a Sierra Club convention.</TE>
<TE>   Even movies that are now considered classics, like "Scarface,"
which is easily the most influential movie among hip-hop fans
everywhere, were trashed when they first appeared. "The reaction to
'Scarface' was horrid--everyone said it was bloody and despicable,"
De Palma recalled. " 'Carrie' was dismissed as a ridiculous B-movie
by everyone, except for Pauline Kael, and even she didn't like
'Scarface.' "</TE>
<TE>   De Palma bristled when it became apparent that I shared his
detractors' disdain for his recent work. "I think you missed a lot in
'Mission to Mars,' " he said brusquely. "It's a beautiful-looking
film. All the critics ever talked about was the banality of the
story."</TE>
<TE>   But wasn't it incredibly banal? "Give me a break," De Palma
snapped. "I just watched the DVD of 'Snake Eyes' from beginning to
end and really liked it--it captured the inner reality of the casino
world. And whatever you say about 'Mission: Impossible,' it has three
or four sequences that will be around for a long time. When it comes
to doing a big action movie, I'm as good as anybody."</TE>
<TE>   OK, so artists are touchy and rarely the best judges of their own
work. In fact, distributors often bring films here to gauge critical
reaction to them. Most of the time distributors don't know what
critics think about a movie until their reviews run. But at a
festival, you can bump into someone who just had dinner with
Newsweek's David Ansen or Entertainment Weekly's Lisa Schwartzbaum
and hear them raving or dissing a new film. A movie that gets good
buzz here could be positioned as an Oscar contender, whereas a movie
that doesn't play well could get bumped to a later release date--or
not get one at all. Festivals are one place where critics still
matter.</TE>
<TE>   Universal Pictures, which is releasing "8 Mile," the Curtis Hanson
movie starring Eminem, showed that movie here as "a work in
progress," largely to assess its Oscar potential without having to
worry about any negative published reviews. The verdict from my
informal poll: It's an audience movie, not an academy film.</TE>
<TE>   Miramax also tested the waters with "The Quiet American," a
Phillip Noyce-directed adaptation of the Graham Greene novel about
the early days of U.S. involvement in Vietnam. Coming into the
festival, its producers were concerned that Miramax had lost faith in
the film, which had tested poorly in the months after Sept. 11,
perhaps because audiences weren't willing to embrace a movie so
openly critical of American military adventurism.</TE>
<TE>   The film's warm reaction here may force Miramax's hand. Michael
Caine, who co-stars as a cynical British foreign correspondent, got a
standing ovation when he appeared at a festival screening, and the
film received glowing reviews, with Variety critic Todd McCarthy
chastising Miramax for not giving the film a release date. A studio
spokesperson now says Miramax, reacting to the positive response
here, will release the film this year in time to qualify for Oscar
consideration.</TE>
<TE>   De Palma's "Femme Fatale" also got some positive reactions,
providing hope that critics might view it as a comeback for the
director. In fact, the film grew out of De Palma's realization that
he needed fresh inspiration. He moved to Paris 2 1/2 years ago,
inspired in part by how one of his favorite writers, Somerset
Maugham, in his later years began cruising around the world in search
of new story ideas.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to get out into the world," he said. "You can't hide in
your big mansion or ride in a limo to fancy restaurants. You have to
want to experience new things."</TE>
<TE>   De Palma had always wanted to make a movie about a film noir-style
woman, like Rita Hayworth in "Gilda" or Jane Greer in "Out of the
Past," who's involved in a heist gone bad. When De Palma's femme
fatale meets a woman who's practically her look-alike--and suicidal
over the loss of her husband and child--she realizes she could steal
more than diamonds. She could steal somebody else's life. De Palma
initially wrote two versions of the story, one set in America, the
other set largely in Paris. "When I got financing for the French
version, I thought, 'Great, now I can stay in Paris even longer.' "</TE>
<TE>   Like most of De Palma's films, "Femme Fatale" is full of
Hitchcockian hommages, especially to "Vertigo," De Palma's favorite
Hitchcock film. De Palma is keenly aware that the old master made his
best films as a younger man. "You have to think very carefully about
what movies you make at my age," De Palma admits. "But I have nothing
left to prove. I'm not going to redeem myself in anyone's eyes by
what I do now. I can almost write the reviews for 'Femme Fatale'
myself. I can hear the critics saying, 'Is De Palma lost in all his
old obsessions again?' But if you didn't like 'Mission: Impossible'
or 'Snake Eyes,' then all I can say is, c'est la vie."</TE>
<TE>   De Palma's time in Paris has paid off: He may not have learned to
love his critics, but at least he can write them off in French.</TE>

<HD>Imagine a Circus by Fellini</HD>
<DH>Entertainment* The Montreal-based Cirque Eloize's 'Nomade'
show puts a surrealistic spin on its story of wandering performers.
There's plenty of clowning around too.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGH HART</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Everybody wants to sleep under the sky, outside, once in their life;
the night sky seems endless, and it's a starting point of reflection
where you try to be connected with other people." That's Jeannot
Painchaud, artistic director for Cirque Eloize, explaining the
opening scene for "Nomade."</LD>
<LD>   The Montreal-based troupe of acrobats is traveling the world
performing "Nomade," a form-fitting production about two wandering
clans of circus performers who juggle, tumble, clown, sing and dance
in a dusk-to-dawn showdown culminating in a riotous wedding.</LD>
<LD>   Cirque Eloize performs "Nomade" at Royce Hall Friday through
Sunday. Trying to explain "Nomade's" surrealistically unfolding story
line, Painchaud says, " 'Nomade' emerges from a dream, but not dreams
about a character from another planet. These are dreams we imagine
from inside.</LD>
<TE>   "The scenes emerge like an image from an old postcard, or
something like that. We try to show these links between people, the
tragic comedy of life and the spirit of the nomads. It's the state of
mind, like you'd see in a family of gypsies a little bit, or a family
of Italians."</TE>
<TE>   To dramatize their vignettes, the "Nomade" cast relies on circus
implements that have been around for ages--tumbling pins, ropes,
trapeze bars. But they make use of the tools in new ways, Painchaud
says. "We try to reinvent the way to use the apparatus. You'll see
the children play a street game with the Russian bar, and then a
scene later, two big men hold the bar up in the air for the balancing
act. Or you'll see the big black ball, which goes back centuries in
the circus, but we use it in this kind of surreal scenario so the man
balancing on it looks as if he is floating on a cloud. It's a little
like Fellini, who is really an inspiration to us."</TE>
<TE>   Painchaud says he needed performers who could conjure a touch of
poetry on stage, so when it came time to cast the "Nomade" ensemble,
technical virtuosity was only one criterion. "What we also look for
are the eyes of the artist, to see them deeply inside. We prefer a
very good [performer] but with a very nice personality and a big
interest in being part of a community so that what the public
receives is some kind of realistic feelings that these characters on
stage, they could be your cousin or grandma or your son."</TE>
<TE>   Casting Isn't Easy</TE>
<TE>   It was tricky finding soulful circus performers willing to
submerge their egos for the common good, Painchaud says. "It's not
easy to do casting for this type of show, because sometimes people
who work so hard to be the best work alone, and they're not always
open to others.</TE>
<TE>   "For what we do, you have to have eyes all around the head, you
have to be really careful of each other on the stage. We choose
people who are interested not just in a job but in having an
experience with a group of people, because our shows go on the road
for many years and they need to be ready for that."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, 14 circus performers from Canada, Belgium, Switzerland,
Poland and Guinea gathered in Montreal and rehearsed "Nomade" for
seven months with four musicians under the direction of Swiss
choreographer Daniele Finzi-Pasca, whom Painchaud likens to Italian
madcap Roberto Benigni. Finzi-Pasca urged the performers to develop
back stories for their characters and insisted that everybody
contribute to the musical numbers.</TE>
<TE>   "When we hired them, half had never sung, not even in the shower,"
Painchaud says. "That was such a job."</TE>
<TE>   Finzi-Pasca even figured out a way to make use of a tone-deaf
Polish gymnast. "It was absolutely impossible for her to sing without
a false note. She was singing badly, so badly," Painchaud says. "Then
the director says, 'OK, you're going to be the soloist.' So now there
is a clown act, and she sings so loud that it becomes funny."</TE>
<TE>   Painchaud enjoys cultivating all-around entertainers since he
started his own circus-biz career as a versatile street performer. "I
used to be a busker," he says. "I had almost an hour show, using a
bicycle, unicycle, juggling, everything."</TE>
<TE>   Plying his trade as a teenage stunt whiz in the early '80s,
Painchaud found himself at the right place at the right time, just as
Cirque Nouveau was gathering steam in Quebec. The movement, which
started in France in the '70s, dispensed with animal acts and
refocused European circus arts in a more lyrical direction by
integrating stunts with theatrical elements of set design, music,
choreography and lighting.</TE>
<TE>   Cirque Nouveau Led Way</TE>
<TE>   In 1981, street comedian Guy Caron and gymnast Pierre Leclerc,
inspired by a visit to Europe, founded the National Circus School in
Montreal to spread the Cirque Nouveau gospel. Three years later,
accordion player Guy Laliberte created the now-famous Cirque du
Soleil. Painchaud happened to see that company's very first
performance and enrolled at the school a few months later. "I was
fascinated by this world. When I arrived in Montreal at age 19, I
discovered the National Circus School, and I tell you,
instantaneously like a cliche, I discovered myself and my vocation,
because all my dreams--traveling, doing art, the physical
challenges--it was all there, all at once."</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, Painchaud started Cirque Eloize with six friends from his
native Madgdalen Islands off the coast of Quebec. Over the last nine
years, the circus has played 200 cities in 20 countries. Painchaud
says his company happened onto its international appeal by thinking
small. "We never tried to do a show for the Chinese, or the German or
the Japanese, because if you want to build something like that, it's
kind of impossible to imagine. But if you do something personal, then
this is naturally something understood by everybody. Because everyone
has feelings. All of our work is based on that, on the heart. What we
look for is to touch the heart. You just try to do a show for
yourself, and if you can do that, it becomes universal."</TE>
<TE>   Cirque Eloize performs "Nomade" at UCLA's Royce Hall on Friday and
Saturday at 8 p.m.; Saturday and Sunday at 2 p.m. $35-$45. (310)

<HD>A Master at Stringing the Audience Along</HD>
<DH>Phillip Huber's puppets play musical instruments, sing,
cavort and soar with humor in this low-tech, high-skill tour de
force.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNNE HEFFLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The marionette work in the Oscar-nominated "Being John Malkovich" was
so stunning that even some professional animators were convinced it
had to have been done via computer imaging.</LD>
<LD>   The man actually pulling the strings, however, was professional
marionette master Phillip Huber, whose impressive talents are on
display in his solo show, "Suspended Animation," at the Santa Monica
Puppet and Magic Center.</LD>
<LD>   Don't expect the film's "angst-ridden marionette melodrama," Huber
warns at the start. His aim, he says, is "simple, unabashed
entertainment." While "simple" hardly describes Huber's artistry in
manipulating the multiple strings that bring his eccentric
cloth-and-wood characters to life, "unabashed entertainment" is right
on the money.</LD>
<TE>   Among the show's beguiling vignettes, performed to a recorded
soundtrack, a violinist named Manuel D'Exterity shows off his
virtuoso talents; an elegant Pierrot conquers the high wire, operatic
diva Priscilla Pipes emotes and a shy skating panda executes all
manner of smooth moves to the music of Offenbach.</TE>
<TE>   Other vignettes include a yodeler, a bubble-gum chewer, glamorous
trapeze artist Louisa and a Liza Minnelli look-alike.</TE>
<TE>   Huber, who performs cabaret-style--he is onstage with his
handcrafted puppets, manipulating them in full view of the
audience--is a subtle part of the performance, silently admonishing
or encouraging the varied characters as needed with a shake of the
head or a smile; echoing their footwork with his own in dance
sequences or deftly using his leg or knee as bench, wall or leaning
post.</TE>
<TE>   In one tour-de-force comical highlight, finicky old pianist Sir
Cedric dusts off his bench with his handkerchief, demands a glass of
wine to be placed just so and carefully lifts his fancy frock coat as
he sits down, all the while giving the audience sly glances over his
shoulder. When he finally starts playing, his renditions of
selections from Rossini are so vigorous that the piano fights back.</TE>
<TE>   A new monkey character, who is getting a tryout, was a bit wobbly
in his acrobatic routine at Saturday's matinee; otherwise the show is
a marvel of keenly observed gestures and actions that are remarkably
true to life: When Huber's pianist and violinist play their
instruments, the illusion is so vivid that their fingers seem to be
moving on keys and strings; when Pierrot painstakingly moves across
the high wire and Louisa does a flip over her trapeze, Huber cuts no
corners in set up or execution.</TE>
<TE>   The show, which ends with an audience question-and-answer session,
is accessible to children, but it is designed for adults who can
appreciate not only the charms of the puppet personalities but the
art and the artist.</TE>
<TE>   "Suspended Animation," Santa Monica Puppet and Magic Center, 1255
2nd St., Santa Monica, Wednesday-Friday at 7 p.m. $35. (310)

<HD>He's Still Rotten to the Core of Punk</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Johnny Rotten isn't happy. For one thing, the air conditioning isn't
working in his trailer backstage at the Inland Invasion punk
festival, and the 101-degree heat, even at 7 p.m., hangs over the
Glen Helen Blockbuster Pavilion in Devore like an extra layer of
skin.</LD>
<LD>   The trailer lights must also be on the blink--unless Rotten just
doesn't notice that it's almost dark as he sits and wonders what he's
even doing here, singing with the Sex Pistols at their first U.S. gig
in six years.</LD>
<LD>   "To me this is just a cheesy little pop festival," Rotten says
with his customary snarl. "I'm certainly not here because of KROQ or
to sell flared jeans."</LD>
<TE>   He's not about to take comfort, he says, in regarding the rest of
Saturday's concert and the attendance of 52,000 as a tribute to the
Pistols' legacy. The Englishman doesn't identify with many of the
bands on the bill--there's a "frivolity" about a lot of American punk
bands that he doesn't like--and he is not pleased that Levi's and
KROQ-FM are sponsoring the event.</TE>
<TE>   Rotten, 46, agreed to do the show, he says, only because the band
members (guitarist Steve Jones, drummer Paul Cook and bassist Glen
Matlock) wanted to do a U.S. date after their 25th anniversary
performance in London in July.</TE>
<TE>   He even seems ambivalent now about the Pistols' 1996 reunion
shows, which were mostly acclaimed. "I don't remember that tour," he
says coolly. "Why should I? I've done a lot since, and I'm constantly
working.... I have my solo stuff and I want to go back and do more
TV."</TE>
<TE>   That may be, but it's only as Johnny Rotten that John Lydon
matters in pop culture--and there's no way to overestimate the effect
that he and the rest of the Sex Pistols have had on rock 'n' roll.</TE>
<TE>   It was absurd--but not totally unexpected--that the Rock and Roll
Hall of Fame failed to induct the Pistols during the band's first
year of eligibility in 2001. The Pistols are still viewed with
suspicion by much of the rock establishment, some of whom point to
everything from Rotten's caustic manner to bassist Sid Vicious' fatal
drug overdose in 1979 as reasons to dismiss the band as more of an
embarrassing chapter in rock than a serious force.</TE>
<TE>   In truth, the Pistols' legacy has endured, and the Inland Invasion
festival was testimony. Backstage, guitarist Jones admits he's
touched by the response of other musicians.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had three or four people come up to me and say they started
in a band because of us," he says. "That's nice. How many people in
the world get an opportunity to hear something like that?"</TE>
<TE>   Others bands, including the Ramones and the New York Dolls from
the U.S., contributed to the punk blueprint, but it was the Pistols
who gave it life with a 1976-77 campaign of anarchy, outrage and
buzz-saw anthems that kicked rock sensibilities in the teeth.</TE>
<TE>   It was leading up to the time of Margaret Thatcher's conservative
government in England,  and working-class youth felt oppressed. The
Pistols reflected their alienation with such taunting choruses about
young people having "no future" under England's "Fascist regime."</TE>
<TE>   The band so outraged British society with its boorish behavior,
including cursing on television and throwing up at Heathrow Airport,
that two labels, EMI and A&amp;M, signed the band to bonuses and then
quickly paid it again to leave.</TE>
<TE>   When it seemed the quartet might be silenced, Warner Bros. Records
released the group's debut album, "Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's
the Sex Pistols," and it was a sensation in England. The album didn't
sell nearly as well here, but it reached a core of young, active rock
fans. The Pistols never performed that many live shows before they
broke up in 1977, but, as the saying goes, it seemed as if everyone
who saw them play started a band.</TE>
<TE>   The effect was especially strong in Los Angeles, where the cult
started its own clubs (notably the Masque in Hollywood) and its own
magazine (Slash). The region also produced many of the bands that
played Saturday, including X, the Circle Jerks, Social Distortion,
Bad Religion and the Offspring. Southern California was also home to
Black Flag, which was among the most revolutionary and intense L.A.
bands ever to step on a stage.</TE>
<TE>   One reason the Pistols didn't become a hit in this country was
that rock radio stations were appalled by their rowdy, raucous sound
and manner. The Pistols, in turn, ridiculed radio and the hit bands
of the day as reactionary and irrelevant. The band's revolutionary
messages were that anyone could be a musician, and that ideas and
passion were more important than millions of dollars of equipment and
virtuoso abilities.</TE>
<TE>   Rotten, who lives in Los Angeles, says he's not certain America
really understood the Pistols' political message.</TE>
<TE>   "I was born into a class in England that was told I was
[worthless] for the rest of my life, and I made sure I wasn't," he
explains. "I am happy about that, and I would like to thank no one
for it except myself."</TE>
<TE>   The Pistols' liberating message was picked up by young musicians
far beyond the boundaries of punk. U2's Bono and Nirvana's Kurt
Cobain are among the countless artists who cited the Sex Pistols'
do-it-yourself spirit.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the Pistols are only a name to many of the younger
members of Saturday's audience, and Rotten and the crowd don't seem
to know what to make of each other in their set's opening moments.
The band plays the familiar chords with the desired intensity and
speed, but Rotten looks lost. He prances about self-consciously and
throws out occasional asides, as if dropping bait into water and
waiting for fish to bite.</TE>
<TE>   It isn't until someone in the crowd drenches him with a beer about
40 minutes into the hourlong set that Rotten snaps into focus and
gains purpose. Like Eminem, he seems to need someone to fight against
to be at his sharpest.</TE>
<TE>   Rotten draws howls from the crowd as he sarcastically
tongue-lashes the offender, then hurls himself into the music as if
it was 1977 again. It also helps that he is at the point in the set
that includes the band's most memorable tunes, "Anarchy in the U.K."
and "God Save the Queen."</TE>
<TE>   The Pistols are no longer revolutionary or threatening, but their
place in rock history gives their performance a captivating edge.
Some fans left before the Pistols came on, worn out from the marathon
affair. The thousands still on hand, however, respond
enthusiastically, with many singing along. There is a sense of
community and bonding in the audience that crosses generations. The
Sex Pistols are back on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ballot this
year, and if the voters don't elect them this time, they might just
as well shut the place down.</TE>
<TE>   The induction dinner, which has become a tame, predictable affair,
could certainly use a Johnny Rotten tirade at the podium. Whether his
relentless sarcasm is genuine or simply a role he has perfected,
Rotten remains a link to the original, untamed spirit of punk.</TE>

<HD>'Wild Kingdom' Inhabits a New Lair</HD>

<LD>If you're old enough to remember nature TV programs before "The
Crocodile Hunter" or if you've seen much stand-up comedy, chances are
you recall "Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom."</LD>
<LD>   Every week on the original series, folksy host Marlin Perkins
would somehow connect the perils of animals living in the wild with
the need to purchase Mutual of Omaha insurance. Perkins would say
something like: "Just as the lioness must protect her cubs from
hyenas, you must protect your family from hidden dangers."</LD>
<LD>   In fact, comics loved poking fun at Perkins'
juxtapositions--Johnny Carson was exceptionally adept at mimicking
Perkins on "The Tonight Show."</LD>
<TE>   On the serious side, "Wild Kingdom" was the television nature
series for more than two decades. The series premiered in 1963 and
continued on prime-time network television until 1971, when it was
put into syndication. The series, which won 41 major awards,
including four Emmys, finally left the airwaves after the 1985
season. Perkins left the show in 1985 and died in 1986. Jim Fowler,
who had been Perkins' co-host, moved up to host in the final season
and was joined by zoologist and conservationist Peter Gros.</TE>
<TE>   The cable network Animal Planet and the financial and insurance
company have resurrected "Wild Kingdom" as a series of six wildlife
documentaries. The new "Wild Kingdom" kicks off tonight with the
premiere of "Lost Elephants of Timbuktu." The hourlong film
chronicles a "lost" herd of truly wild elephants living in the
Southern fringe of the Sahara desert.</TE>
<TE>   "Wild Kingdom" and Animal Planet are a perfect fit, says Michael
Cascio, the outlet's executive vice president and general manager.
The original series, he says, was the Animal Planet of its day.</TE>
<TE>   The new "Wild Kingdom" won't feature any hosts, though Alec
Baldwin narrates the first documentary, but will use state-of-the-art
technology.</TE>
<TE>   "In the case of the first episode, we use global positioning
satellites to find these elephants; nobody knows where they go and
nobody has tracked them before," Cascio says.</TE>
<TE>   On tap for October is "Great Cats of India," which follows the
country's leading wildlife cameraman, Alphonse Roy, as he captures
portraits of India's four great cats. The November installment
explores the world of the black mamba, the deadliest snake on the
planet, and even attaches a minicam to the viper in order to give a
reptile's-eye view of the world.</TE>
<TE>   The three remaining documentaries look at amphibians, marching
sand dunes and research in developing antivenin for snakebites.</TE>
<TE>   Both Fowler and Gros are advisors on the series; they read the
scripts and talk with the filmmakers to make sure the programs are
family-friendly.</TE>
<TE>   Gros, who frequently takes his furry friends to visit Jay Leno on
"The Tonight Show," says that, unlike a lot of wildlife
documentaries, " 'Wild Kingdom' won't show many
survival-of-the-fittest scenes in which animals devour other animals.</TE>
<TE>   "Our niche is family entertainment. We are still trying to educate
people and get them hooked on nature."</TE>
<TE>   Since his days as co-host of the old show, Gros says that
people--children in particular--are much savvier regarding animals
and the environment.</TE>
<TE>   "The downside is what we have done the last 25 or 30 years--and
this is sort of a personal soapbox issue for me--is we have done such
a good job talking about the gloom and doom that young people think
it's too late. We don't tend to share enough information about the
bald eagle, which came off the endangered species list. The numbers
are up for the gray whales, and the buffalo are doing well. There are
hundreds and hundreds of animals making a comeback; you just don't
hear about it."</TE>
<TE>   "Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom: Lost Elephants of Timbuktu" can
be seen today at 8 p.m. on Animal Planet.</TE>

<HD>A Brush With Fame</HD>
<DH>England's George Romney was one of the most talented, and
prolific, portraitists of his era</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>George Romney was a portrait machine. Two hundred years before Andy
Warhol dubbed his New York studio the Factory, Romney was
manufacturing painted likenesses of grandees and their families in
London's newly fashionable Cavendish Square. Between 1776 and 1795,
his meticulous record books show, the artist was seeing three, five,
even seven sitters per workday--plus one or two on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   And Romney didn't just paint the all-important faces of Elizabeth,
Countess of Derby, or Edward Wortley Montagu or the Clavering
children, Thomas and Catherine. Romney did the whole thing himself.
He hardly ever employed assistants to paint their satin dresses,
brocade vests and lacy collars, or to fill in the backgrounds of
wooded landscapes of the English countryside over which so many of
them reigned. And given the staggering volume of his production, he
did it remarkably well--as a large and satisfying exhibition that
opened Sunday at the Huntington Library eloquently demonstrates.</LD>
<TE>   The show, which arrives from London's National Portrait Gallery
for its only American presentation, is a fascinating survey of a
pivotal phenomenon in the history of European art. Romney's career
coincides with the first dynamic rush of the Industrial Revolution.
It records not just the beneficiaries of explosive new wealth and
power, but also the mind-set that fueled its engines. A Romney
portrait is the embodiment of a luxury consumer product; as such, it
also represents a dramatic shift in the artist's social role.</TE>
<TE>   Take the 1770 double-portrait of an unidentified woman and her
son, which stands at the apex of Romney's early career. Dressed in a
gown of lustrous, silvery white satin trimmed in thick layers of
delicate lace, the lady is perched at the edge of a graceful chair
upholstered in red and cerulean brocade. Her arms embrace her young
son, elegantly dressed and seated on her lap, while behind them
billowing clouds over a low horizon drift off into a dramatic
infinity of glowing light.</TE>
<TE>   The landscape vista heightens the sense of monumental stability
established by the central composition, which takes the shape of an
eternal pyramid. Their exalted position in the world is assured--and
thus has it always been.</TE>
<TE>   The woman and her son form a secular Madonna and Child. Their
alabaster skin, untouched by the sun that tans the laboring classes,
is wrapped in luxurious fabrics suggestive of the high end of the
textile industry that was driving England's manufacturing juggernaut.
Romney has a bit of trouble fitting the boy's large head comfortably
onto his narrow shoulders, while the lap on which the lad rests is so
long that it might qualify Mummy for the NBA. Yet, the demeanor
Romney has given to his sitters is astounding--she, back ramrod
straight and head cocked, imperious and self-satisfied; he, languid
and bored, his limbs draped like a porcelain doll's.</TE>
<TE>   Romney's picture is a stunning portrait of sumptuousness and
presumptuousness. His flawless representation of those dual
characteristics soon had patrons lining up at his door. Romney didn't
invent British portraiture in the Grand Manner, but he certainly
recognized that he could market it to become the reigning fashion in
the last quarter of the 18th century.</TE>
<TE>   At the Huntington's Boone Gallery, Romney's career unfolds in 54
paintings and 38 drawings, plus half a dozen sketchbooks. The first
rooms show his provincial beginnings. Romney was born in England's
northwest Lake District in 1734, and he apprenticed with a local
portraitist who had in turn been trained by French artist Carle van
Loo, court painter to Louis XV. His precocious talents at painting
modestly scaled pictures of prosperous local gentry at
home--paintings called "conversation pieces"--brought him regional
fame. As an artist, he quickly became a big fish in a little pond.</TE>
<TE>   But Romney's ambitions were much larger than that. At 28 he headed
south to London, virtually abandoning his much older wife and young
son but determined to make it as a history painter. Now the littlest
fish in the biggest pond of all, he had a rough go of it.</TE>
<TE>   Not much remains of his first five years in London, when he had to
return periodically to the northwest to scrape together money doing
commissions. His breakthrough came in 1768, when a London lawyer and
amateur artist commissioned him to paint his family's portrait. "The
Leigh Family" is an odd work, but the big, nearly 7-by-8-foot canvas
represents quite a leap from Romney's earlier paintings.</TE>
<TE>   The unusual composition is split in two. Mr. and Mrs. Leigh and
their eldest son are over to one side, forming their own nominal
"holy family," while their four daughters--the eldest holding their
baby boy aloft--are grouped on the other. Standing on a classical
porch, they're dressed to the nines.</TE>
<TE>   Romney has stitched together modest attributes of a conversation
piece with showy, intellectualized elements of Grand Manner style,
espoused by the Royal Academy's lordly president, Sir Joshua
Reynolds. The proliferating Leigh family wasn't exactly of the proper
social station for such aristocratic treatment--but there they are in
all their satin finery just the same. The lawyer and his family are
arrayed across the canvas in the shallow space of low relief, like
gods and heroines on some classical marble frieze dug up in Greece.</TE>
<TE>   The picture was a hit. Clients came calling. Romney was on his
way.</TE>
<TE>   But he was not on his way to becoming a history painter, which is
why he had come to London in the first place. The exhibition shows an
artist of ambition and skill, but one whose conflicted sense of his
own direction often got the better of him. Market pressures regularly
intervened.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Romney spent two years in Italy (1773-1775), where he
studied the requisite classical sources and Renaissance masters. It
heightened his skills a lot. However, it wasn't simply a desire to
sharpen his edge as a potential painter of high-minded literary and
historical subjects that propelled him there. London patrons knew of
the importance of the Grand Tour to the proper education of a
painter; if Romney hadn't gone, he would have lost clients.</TE>
<TE>   Romney was competitive, and he developed a savvy business plan.
His chief rivals were two older artists, Reynolds and Thomas
Gainsborough, both with an established aristocratic clientele. So,
when he shrewdly moved into the up-and-coming neighborhood of
Cavendish Square, leaving them behind in more conventional, old-money
parts of town, Romney also undercut their commission
prices--sometimes by more than 50%. What he lost per picture he would
make up for in quantity.</TE>
<TE>   Think Michael Graves at Target: high style for less money, sold in
volume. Britain's Industrial Revolution might have started with the
manufacture of practical goods, but it quickly enveloped art.</TE>
<TE>   Given the production demands, it's remarkable Romney could be so
good. The Huntington has one of the largest Romney collections
anywhere, and several of its own pictures are among the show's
standouts.</TE>
<TE>   Take the late, full-length figure of "Mrs. Penelope Lee Acton"
(1791), which is a marvel of design. Her right side is a nearly
straight vertical line, from the hem of her white dress to her
shoulder, which leads your eye along an ever-changing array of
jewel-like colors in the landscape. By contrast, her left side, set
against the uniformly dark woods, is like a lightning bolt of jagged
contours.</TE>
<TE>   Romney was certainly conflicted about his failure to leave
portraiture behind and emerge as a confident history painter. Lots of
commissions were never finished. He went on tangents--as in his
panting ardor for Emma, Lady Hamilton, whom he revered as his muse.
His attempts at painting scenes from Milton and Shakespeare were
often muddled and confusing.</TE>
<TE>   In the show, the one place he shines as a literary artist is in
his drawings. Their fluid emphasis on subjective sensibility and
imagination anticipates the Romantic era, which flourished after his
death in 1802.</TE>
<TE>   They can also harbor an amazing arrogance. A big, impressive 1777
cartoon in black chalk, drawn on six sheets of paper joined together,
shows personifications of Joy and Sorrow (or comedy and tragedy)
attendant at the birth of Shakespeare. The baby lies at the bottom of
the picture in a basket, like Moses in the bulrushes or Jesus in the
manger. Behind him a Mary-like figure represents Nature, pulling back
a veil to reveal herself.</TE>
<TE>   The personifications are drawn like Greek maidens, while the
composition recalls a Roman relief. Natural law, which originated in
the thought of Greek and Roman Stoics, is dramatically asserted, with
nature as the source of an artist's genius. Rarely has the immutable
authority of British art been so baldly claimed.</TE>

<LD>While many Angelenos were tuned into the fourth-season opener of "The
Sopranos" on Sunday night, another drama of lust, greed, murder and
revenge was unfolding at the Irvine Barclay Theatre. But this one
ends in moral triumph.</LD>
<LD>   Viji Prakash, artistic director-choreographer of Shakti Dance
Company, is celebrating the troupe's 25th anniversary with a
full-length production of "Baghvad Gita." The ambitious,
three-hour-plus work succeeded brilliantly. Prakash, aided by
sumptuous costumes, exquisite lighting, stellar live musical
accompaniment and divine dancing, has fashioned the ancient Hindu
lessons of the Bhagavad-Gita (Absolute Truth), into a drama
interweaving other portions of the Hindu epic, the "Mahabharata"
(Great War).</LD>
<LD>   Essentially a battle between good and evil, the tale of warring
factions overseen by Lord Krishna plays out in two acts and 14
scenes, all danced in South India's classical idiom bharata natyam.
Characterized by elaborate arm and hand gestures, mimetic acting and
the slapping of bare feet rhythmically enhanced by ankle bells, the
dancing proved thrilling in virtuosic solo work, as well as in
precise unison moves of the silk-swirling corps, at times numbering
13 dancers.</LD>
<TE>   It was Prakash's beatific presence as a wide-eyed Krishna, though,
that brought the drama together. Whether holding a pose or deftly
beating time with her feet, she reigned supreme--as does Krishna in
the end of the story--in a glittering headdress.</TE>
<TE>   Also dancing spectacularly in a variety of warring roles: Ajit
Bhaskaran Das, whose leaps seemed to float earthward; Mythili Prakash
(Viji's daughter), in an adroit death scene; Harikrishna
Kalyanasundaram's noble turns upped the testosterone level; and Uma
Kadekodi and Madhvi Venkatesh, gloriously spun around the floor on
their knees.</TE>
<TE>   The full house on hand responded with a standing ovation.</TE>
<TE>   A Southland treasure, Shakti will tour this extravaganza to other
cities, including Houston and San Francisco.</TE>

<LD>   'Frasier' Tops 'Mary Tyler Moore Show'</LD>
<LD>   The Emmy Awards have a new king.</LD>
<TE>   With wins for guest actor, picture editing and sound mixing,
"Frasier" became the most-honored prime-time series in Emmy history
when the first of this year's honors were handed out Saturday night.
That brought the NBC comedy's total to 30, one more than "The Mary
Tyler Moore Show."</TE>
<TE>   "Frasier," starring Kelsey Grammer in a role he first played on
"Cheers," could pick up two more Sunday night when the rest of the
Emmys are handed out on NBC.</TE>

<TE>   Toronto Honors 'Magdalene Sisters'</TE>
<TE>   The Toronto International Film Festival gave a top award to the
controversial "The Magdalene Sisters," a movie denounced by Catholic
groups for its portrait of life in an Irish religious institution.</TE>
<TE>   The film was given the festival's Discovery Award, a prize for
first-or second-time directors voted on by the approximately 750
journalists at the event.</TE>
<TE>   In other awards announced Sunday, the German-New Zealand
co-production "The Whale Rider" won the festival's People's Choice
Award, and David Cronenberg's "Spider" was named best Canadian
feature.</TE>

<TE>   NEA to Name 154 Grant Winners</TE>
<TE>   The National Endowment for the Arts will announce today the
awarding of 154 grants totaling $4.5 million to arts organizations
nationwide through the agency's Challenge America: Community Arts
Development program.</TE>
<TE>   The funding includes grants of $10,000 each to eight California
organizations: Arts Council Silicon Valley in San Jose; Merced
Regional Arts Council; the Mission Neighborhood Centers and the
Oberlin Dance Collective of San Francisco; Riverside Arts Council;
Sonora's Stage 3 Theatre Company; Three-Forests Interpretive Assn. in
Tollhouse; and the Truckee Tahoe Community Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   The community-based initiative was created by former NEA chairman
Bill Ivey, a Bill Clinton appointee who stepped down last September.
Through the program, Ivey was able to win the embattled federal arts
agency, long a target for conservatives in Congress because of its
perceived support of "obscene" art, its first increases in eight
years. A 1997 bill to eliminate all NEA funding failed by a single
vote.</TE>
<TE>   In July, the House agreed to increase the NEA's budget by $11.5
million, to $127.5 million for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. Of
that increase, $10 million is earmarked for Challenge America. The
measure is pending approval by the Senate; an NEA spokeswoman said a
vote may be delayed past Oct. 1 because of the Senate's preoccupation
with national security matters.</TE>

<TE>   Museum Gets Deadline to Meet Fire Code</TE>
<TE>   The Philadelphia Museum of Art has been in violation of city fire
codes since 1995 but has failed to install the equipment deemed
necessary to protect the paintings, sculptures, books and other work
stored in its two-acre basement, city officials told the Philadelphia
Inquirer.</TE>
<TE>   The museum has been granted two variances since the first citation
was issued but was denied a third in June and must deliver an
expedited plan next week for making the improvements. More than half
of the basement has no sprinklers or other fire-suppression system,
according to a fire-inspection report obtained by the Inquirer.</TE>
<TE>   Museum officials acknowledged the shortcomings downstairs but
stressed that the building does not pose a threat to visitors. City
officials concurred, which is why the building has not been shut
down.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lyric Opera's Radio Broadcasts Suspended</TE>
<TE>   The Lyric Opera of Chicago has suspended its local and nationally
syndicated radio broadcasts for the 2002-03 season because of a lack
of funding.</TE>
<TE>   To date, only one corporation has committed to sponsoring the
broadcasts, which have been carried live in the Chicago area since
1973 and on stations elsewhere in the country since 1977, including,
at times, KMZT-FM (105.1) locally.</TE>
<TE>   William Mason, the Lyric's general director, blamed the lack of
funding on the sagging economy, adding that the loss of sponsorship
is "extremely distressing." He said both American Airlines and United
Airlines cited financial losses in explaining why they would be
unable to continue sponsoring the broadcasts.</TE>

<LD>"I will survive," disco diva Gloria Gaynor sang, and she has. Whether
disco itself has done so (or ought to) is another question. Still,
ABC will tape a TV special, "The Disco Ball ... A 30-Year

<HD>Who Gets 'High Noon' Credit?</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It's a showdown that's been half a century in the making, a dispute
that has polarized show-biz factions into camps supporting either of
a pair of principals who are no longer around to present their own
versions.</LD>
<LD>   At stake is the coin of the realm in Hollywood--a name in the
credits. Fame and fortunes come and go, but on-screen credits are
forever. Or, as in the case of the 1952 film classic "High Noon,"
missing altogether.</LD>
<LD>   Tonight's documentary, "Darkness at High Noon: The Carl Foreman
Documents" (9 p.m. on KCET), attempts to make the case that Foreman's
credit as producer on the landmark western was denied him and that
legendary filmmaker Stanley Kramer ("Judgment at Nuremberg," "Inherit
the Wind") was a key figure in a scenario that crucially included
Foreman's Hollywood blacklisting for refusing to name names before
the House Un-American Activities Committee. Foreman died in 1984;
Kramer died last year.</LD>
<TE>   An Academy Award-winning screenwriter of such films as "The Bridge
on the River Kwai," Foreman penned the screenplay for "High Noon" and
was a partner in Kramer's production company, which made the movie.
But Kramer's widow, Karen Sharpe Kramer, contends that the
documentary exaggerates Foreman's role while minimizing her husband's
and that her efforts to have her position heard in tonight's program
were thwarted.</TE>
<TE>   Those claims have been denied by "Darkness at High Noon's"
director and writer, Lionel Chetwynd, but in light of the dispute,
KCET will follow the documentary with a half-hour program that will
further examine the issue and include the comments of Mark Lane, an
attorney and spokesman for the Kramer family.</TE>
<TE>   The follow-up special will air at 11 p.m., but it'll feel like
high noon.</TE>

<LD>A woman shifted her weight in her Manolo Blahniks as she considered
the paintings on the wall. "I like them," she told her male
companion. "They're so colorful. And naughty!" Nearby, a tagger took
a swig of the beer he was carrying in a brown paper bag, while a
Japanese film crew interviewed guests in the crowd. A woman wearing
gold hot pants and fishnet stockings sauntered by.</LD>
<LD>   The purpose of the gathering, a reception for Gajin Fujita, was to
celebrate his first show of paintings at the L.A. Louver in Venice,
and some in attendance were unapologetically philistine.</LD>
<LD>   "We used to call it art openings, now we call it wine openings,"
said a guest, as he took his second helping.</LD>
<TE>   Aside from Fujita's art--gold leaf, graffiti and traditional
Eastern erotic imagery--there was plenty on show at the gallery on
this recent night.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not about the art, it's about the event," said Ned Evans, a
local artist. "It's about the pretty women."</TE>
<TE>   By that measure, he said, the party was a success. "People,
especially in this town, come to watch. Every gallery draws a
different crowd. At the Gagosian, you get the movie stars and
celebrities. This crowd ... " he paused, "well it's very unusual."</TE>
<TE>   In a corner, the artist, with a rose made of dollar bills on his
lapel, hugged taggers, art critics and movie stars.</TE>
<TE>   David Arquette, who knew Fujita from the time they were both
members of KGB, a tagging team, had been talking to him about an art
project--a grafitti'ed van--to become part of Arquette's collection,
he said, describing his collection as decidedly "lowbrow."</TE>
<TE>   At the entrance, gallery owner Peter Goulds shook hands and
grinned as art critic Dave Hickey, wearing a cap advertising a
laundry detergent, joined punks, skaters, dreadlocks and blond bobs
in the gallery.</TE>
<TE>   "Eclectic," was Fujita's judgment of the guests. "Kind of like my
paintings."</TE>
<TE>   Three Families</TE>
<TE>   Director Ken Kwapis has three families: his own, and the
dysfunctional TV clans of his two series, "The Bernie Mac Show" and
"Malcolm in the Middle."</TE>
<TE>   On a recent afternoon at "Bernie Mac's" house--a basement stage at
CBS studios in Studio City--Kwapis gently guided the Macs through a
spiritual crisis.</TE>
<TE>   In the episode, Mac experiences the backlash of his religious
awakening as his sister's children, who live with him while she is in
rehab for drug use, become holier than he is, and, among other
things, throw away his toiletries to chastise him for his vanity.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of my job is to create an atmosphere where people can play,"
said Kwapis describing his role as paterfamilias, as he walked
through the plush "Bernie Mac" house.</TE>
<TE>   He's hardly a dictatorial dad. Soft-spoken, Kwapis quietly
encouraged actors to resume the taping of a scene. And his young
actors responded warmly. As the director instructed Jordan (Jeremy
Suarez) and Bryanna (Dee Dee Davis) on how to do a scene in which
they destroy an autographed Kobe Bryant photo (the sin being
idolatry), Davis cuddled up to Kwapis.</TE>
<TE>   Kwapis races between the "Bernie Mac" set and "Malcolm in the
Middle."</TE>
<TE>   "It's upstairs and downstairs," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Literally.</TE>
<TE>   The two shows tape a floor apart, and recently, Kwapis invited
"Malcolm" dad Hal (played by Bryan Cranston) to visit the Bernie Mac
residence.</TE>
<TE>   "He had total TV dad house envy," Kwapis said.</TE>
<TE>   Both "The Bernie Mac Show," which has its season premiere
tomorrow, and "Malcolm in the Middle," rely on visual wit. And both
are single-camera, movie-like shows, said Kwapis, who has also
directed episodes of "The Larry Sanders Show" and a couple of movies,
including the romantic comedy, "He Said, She said," which he
co-directed with his then-fiancee, Marisa Silver. They are now
married.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a wholly autobiographical story," Kwapis said. "If we
could survive co-directing a movie, we could survive marriage."</TE>
<TE>   It's a symbiotic relationship among his three families, off and on
screen.</TE>
<TE>   "I learn things about one family and bring it to another," Kwapis
said. "I have parenting skills" from all three.</TE>
<TE>   Quote/Unquote</TE>
<TE>   "The National Italian American Foundation, or NIAF, is
disappointed that [HBO's "The Sopranos' "] success is on the backs of
Italian Americans who continue to be stereotyped and portrayed
negatively in this fictional series," NIAF chairman Frank J. Guarini
said in a statement released last week. The group wants a disclaimer
issued at each broadcast stating that the TV series doesn't represent
the 25 million Americans of Italian heritage.</TE>

<LD>THE PIANO TUNER</LD>
<LD>   A Novel</LD>
<LD>   By Daniel Mason</LD>
<TE>   Alfred A. Knopf</TE>
<TE>   326 pages, $24</TE>
<TE>   Burmese legend tells of the spirit, leip-bya, that flies at night
outfitted with the wings of a butterfly, according to a character in
"The Piano Tuner," the luminous, dreamscape first novel by medical
student Daniel Mason.</TE>
<TE>   "When a man sleeps, the leip-bya flies from his mouth and goes
about here and there, and sees things on its journey, and these are
dreams," Mason's character explains. "The leip-bya must always return
to a man by morning. This is why the Burmese don't want to wake
sleeping people. Perhaps the leip-bya is very far away, and it cannot
return home fast enough."</TE>
<TE>   Told with the competence of a seasoned storyteller in almost
old-fashioned prose, "The Piano Tuner" begins in 1886 London when
Edgar Drake, a quiet, keep-to-himself piano tuner with a great love
for Erard pianos, is summoned by the British War Office. In service
to the Crown, Drake is told, is one Surgeon-Major Anthony Carroll,
currently holding a provisional peace in the southern Shan States of
war-torn Burma. Some months earlier, the surgeon-major had requested
a rare 1840 Erard grand piano be delivered to the compound.</TE>
<TE>   The military is highly suspicious of the eccentric
doctor-soldier's methods but is nonetheless convinced of his success
in keeping the peace. Though greeted with derision, his piano
requisition--really an ultimatum, Drake learns--was filled in order
to keep the good doctor happy enough to continue providing his
valuable services. (Carroll soothes the local warlords with poetry,
medical care and music, thereby earning their trust and cooperation.)</TE>
<TE>   Once the piano arrived, though, it was painfully out of tune and
damaged from the arduous journey via elephant. Thus, the doctor
requires the services of an Erard expert, which is where Drake comes
in. "It's much easier to deliver a man than a piano," Carroll has
written in his request.</TE>
<TE>   Drake agrees to journey to Burma--a three-month expedition in
service to his nation--in order to tune a piano.</TE>
<TE>   The narrative is split into two parts. The first leisurely tells
of Drake's life in London and reveals the restlessness that haunts
him--and his momentous pilgrimage from London to Calcutta and on to
Rangoon. En route, Drake comes to envision Carroll as a kindred
spirit: Carroll a doctor of people, Drake a doctor of pianos, both
committed to achieving peace via art.</TE>
<TE>   The war department is concerned with Drake's safety and the
shifting alliances in the region, but Drake is indifferent to the
politics of his adventure, an attitude that may prove to be his
downfall.</TE>
<TE>   The second part of the book picks up once Drake arrives at
Carroll's compound, and it sketches Drake's interactions with the
mysterious military man of medicine. The world Drake encounters, at
once vibrant and utterly foreign, works a kind of hypnosis as he
falls under the sway of the land, the people, Carroll and the quiet
Burmese beauty Khin Myo.</TE>
<TE>   Mason's writing achieves that kind of reverie in which every
vision, tone, flavor and sensation is magnified. Drake's first
encounter with Burma, for example: "(I)n the fifteen paces that
carried him from the gate to the waiting carriages, Burma appeared as
if from behind a curtain lifted from a stage. As he stepped into the
street, the crowd swelled around him. He turned. Hands struggled to
thrust baskets of food forward. Women stared at him, their faces
painted white, their fists grasping garlands of flowers. At his feet,
a beggar pressed up against his leg, a mournful boy covered with
scabs and weeping sores, and he turned again and tripped over a group
of men carrying crates of spices suspended between long poles."</TE>
<TE>   The scenes are rendered with resolute command, alive with lush
metaphor, even if at times Mason's plotting is a bit heavy-handed; we
sometimes know what's coming by his blunt foreshadowing. The moments
of awkwardness pass quickly, though: One dream scene makes way for
the next until, ultimately, Drake becomes stranded in the Burmese
world of dreams, his leip-bya so far afield that he cannot be awoken.</TE>
<TE>   On the most transparent level, Mason's is a tale of
self-discovery, the journey to the inner person that often
accompanies foreign expeditions.</TE>
<TE>   Yet there's another, more oblique level in which the narrative
challenges the role of art in society: Can music, poetry, dance and
theater play a tangible role in quests for military peace? As Drake
is pulled deeper into Carroll's schemes, the reader is unsure whether
Carroll believes art can change the world, or if he's only using
Drake's naive passion to his own, possibly treasonous ends.</TE>
<TE>   Admirably, Mason leaves the rendering of that final decision in
his reader's hands. He offers instead only safe passage to the lavish
hinterland of illusion, art and dreams, an expedition to the place
where the leip-bya flies.</TE>

<HD>A Picnic That Takes Literary License</HD>
<DH>Art Deco Society's 'Gatsby' gatherings aren't exactly the
kind found in the novel, but their breezy spirit is the same.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN CARPENTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was, according to a guest at Saturday's Gatsby Picnic, "a ducky
afternoon." The men, many of them in knickers and straw hats, and the
ladies, in drop-waist dresses and stockings, had assembled around
fountains and manicured patches of lawn to sip champagne and snack on
picnic lunches. Some canoodled on blankets. Others tap-danced by the
pool.</LD>
<LD>   "The ambience is so fabulous," said Donald Henderson, one of about
200 people who revisited the '20s at the retro event hosted by the
Art Deco Society of Los Angeles, a preservation and education group.
The 52-year-old Angeleno, his wife and a small group of friends were
dining on strawberry soup, chicken salad, molded gelatin and
lemonade. "It's so civilized in what is getting to be a more and more
uncivilized world," he said.</LD>
<LD>   Gatsby Picnics, a tribute to F. Scott Fitzgerald's "The Great
Gatsby," are a fairly common event for Art Deco societies. The annual
event in San Francisco, hosted by the unaffiliated Art Deco Society
of San Francisco, has been going on for years, drawing crowds of
close to 1,000. This year's picnic in L.A. was ADSLA's first in about
a decade.</LD>
<TE>   "There was no such thing as [a Gatsby picnic] even in the time of
Gatsby," said ADSLA president, Mitzi March Mogul. "But if you're
familiar with the story, he's always having parties at this big,
rolling-hill estate, and of course Fitzgerald goes into incredible
detail about what people are wearing and eating and just the whole
ambience, so it's a modern interpretation."</TE>
<TE>   This weekend, picnickers found that ambience at the estate of
James Degnan in La Canada Flintridge--a privately owned property with
a terraced lawn, pool, two guest houses and gazebo. Designed by
"architect to the stars" Paul Williams in 1927, it is now owned by
attorneys Rod and Gina Guerra, who bought the property three years
ago and are restoring it to its original grandeur.</TE>
<TE>   "We're right now standing in the Hollywood of people's dreams, the
Hollywood of cinema of the '20s and '30s," said Will Ryan, a
television writer and producer who was perched on a landing,
listening to Janet Klein and Her Parlor Boys play jazz down below.
"It's 360 degrees of delight."</TE>
<TE>   A trio of young women who'd set up their picnic by the pool
couldn't agree more. "It's so nice to see an area where they haven't
torn down the architecture and put up a mini-mall," Margaret Easley
said.</TE>
<TE>   The 32-year-old L.A. actress and friends Kelleigh Greenberg and
Natalie Zea were snacking on pre-made sandwiches and salads bearing
Whole Foods labels. They had no plans for the afternoon other than to
enjoy the environment and, said Zea, "get sauced."</TE>
<TE>   Like a scene from Fitzgerald's novel, the trio were dressed to the
nines and sipping champagne from crystal glasses. They were even
being courted by a blond and blue-eyed 32-year-old who, in his white
slacks, white shirt, ascot and blue seersucker jacket, was a dead
ringer for the Jay Gatsby of our imaginations.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I toned it down today," said Christian Chensvold, who
won the picnic's Gatsby Spirit award. "I didn't wear my boater straw
hat, and I didn't wear the white suit with the tie and the pearl
stickpin."</TE>
<TE>   Chensvold, a writer, is a Gatsby Picnic veteran. Originally from
the Bay Area, he attended his first one six years ago and has been to
four since.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always identified with different eras--kinder, gentler
eras," said Chensvold, referring to a time when the emphasis was on
fun and fashion.</TE>
<TE>   The ADSLA regularly hosts walking tours and lectures to educate
people about the Art Deco era, which began in the roaring '20s and
lasted throughout the Great Depression of the '30s. It also hosts
more flamboyant events, such as cocktail parties and vintage fashion
shows, which are open to the public.</TE>
<TE>   "There's always an educational component, but sometimes you don't
want to beat people over the head with that," said Mogul of the
ADSLA, which has about 400 members. "You want them to come and play
dress up and have a good time and forget the contemporary world that
we have to deal with on a day-to-day basis."</TE>
<TE>   For Chensvold, that meant dancing and flirting with the ladies. He
kicked up his heels, dancing the foxtrot and the Charleston with a
woman in a blue chiffon flapper dress, then returned to the trio by
the pool.</TE>
<TE>   "They claim that they're all three in love with me," he said.
"What am I going to do now?"</TE>

<LD>A long time ago, some 40,000 years, saber-toothed cats, dire wolves
and teratorns (big birds with wings that spread 14 feet) lived in Los
Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Some of them got trapped in sticky goo that people call tar or
asphalt. You can't find any of these animals walking down Wilshire
Boulevard today. That's because they are extinct--gone forever. But
every year scientists dig up the bones of these prehistoric animals,
at least the ones that got stuck, out of the tar pits in Hancock
Park. And, like giant 3-D puzzles, they put the bones together. You
can watch the scientists work and see the skeletons of these ancient
beasts when you visit the Page Museum at the La Brea Tar Pits.</LD>
<LD>   Right now, you can try making goo, similar to the asphalt in the
tar pits, so you can see how easy it was for the animals to get
stuck. Be sure to get some help from an adult and cover floors and
countertops while working.</LD>
<TE>   * Part A: Mix, in a medium-size bowl, 1 cup of water, 1 cup of
white glue and 2 tablespoons of black tempera paint.</TE>
<TE>   * Part B: In another bowl, mix 4 teaspoons of 20 Mule Team Borax
Laundry Booster with 1 1/3 cups of warm water.</TE>
<TE>   * Pour A into B. Do not mix, simply roll solution A around
solution B. Lift solution A out of B and knead for 2 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   * Pick it up and notice how well it sticks. What do you think
might happen to an animal that stepped into a large puddle full of
the stuff?</TE>
<TE>   * When finished, store the goo in an airtight container or plastic
bag.</TE>
<TE>   To learn more about animals that once roamed Los Angeles, visit
the Page Museum at the La Brea Tar Pits. For more information, call
(323) 934-PAGE or visit www.tarpits.org.</TE>

<HD>London's Calling</HD>
<DH>... but hardly anyone's answering. At least that's how
critics viewed the runway shows.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE WARDELL</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Bright, jewel-encrusted dresses for evening, masculine tailoring for
day and exotic gypsy flounces for any time were among the major
trends to emerge from London Fashion Week.</LD>
<LD>   But the question on many a fashionista's lips was: Did anyone take
notice?</LD>
<LD>   The event, which wound down Monday, received little coverage in
Britain and was the target of criticism that it was becoming
irrelevant in the face of much bigger showings in New York and Paris.</LD>
<TE>   On paper, it should have been London's largest contribution to the
fashion circuit so far, with 44 official, and as many more
unofficial, shows scheduled for venues across the capital. But
organizers found themselves defending the five-day event against
claims that audience levels were low and some shows were, at best,
lackluster or, at worst, unoriginal.</TE>
<TE>   London Opens the Circuit</TE>
<TE>   The London shows opened the international fashion circuit instead
of New York for the spring collections at the request of organizers
of Manhattan shows, which begin today. It was a onetime schedule
change in deference to Sept. 11 commemorations in New York City.
Featured designers here included Paul Smith, Nicole Farhi, Jasper
Conran, Ghost and Burberry.</TE>
<TE>   But some of Britain's biggest names chose not to show in London at
all--Stella McCartney and Alexander McQueen have signed up for the
Paris shows, and Matthew Williamson and Luella Bartley will unveil
their designs in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "London has suffered the loss of its most visionary designers,
like Stella McCartney and Alexander McQueen, who had very strong
identities very early in their career," said Michael Roberts of the
New Yorker magazine. "There are not enough opinionated designers in
London now."</TE>
<TE>   Julien MacDonald, one of the few truly big British names still
loyal to the London shows and the most hotly anticipated exhibitor,
defended his decision. "People who slate fashion week are missing the
point. London is renowned for being the most creative city in the
world," he was quoted as saying in the Sunday Times of London
newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   "We have the best fashion colleges. Go into any international
design room around the world and you're guaranteed to find a London
graduate working."</TE>
<TE>   The 28-year-old took inspiration from sultry tropical nights and
sent his models down the catwalk in swimwear adorned with rhinestones
and in bright print chiffon evening gowns glittering with crystals.
MacDonald's show also brought a much-needed injection of glamour by
marking the return of supermodel Naomi Campbell to a London catwalk.</TE>
<TE>   In her first appearance since winning a court battle with a
tabloid newspaper that published pictures of her leaving a Narcotics
Anonymous meeting, Campbell sashayed down the runway wearing a
plunging white swimsuit and a $13-million diamond necklace.</TE>
<TE>   Jodie Kidd was the only other high-profile model to grace the
shows.</TE>
<TE>   Other highlights of the week were Paul Smith's women's wear show
Friday, during which the 55-year-old designer transplanted his own
basic formula of great tailoring in menswear to his lingerie and
women's city wear. Pieces included mannish pinstripe suits, sexily
cut men's dress shirts complete with bow ties and skirts made from
men's polka-dot ties.</TE>
<TE>   Nicole Farhi also threw hints of masculine tailoring and boyish
shapes along with flowery prints and the softest girly dresses at her
Saturday show. White cotton shirts sat under neat blazers with
trousers that ranged from low slung to tailored and cropped.</TE>
<TE>   Fine Tailoring, Vintage Fabric</TE>
<TE>   At the other end of the spectrum was Russell Sage, with his use of
Japanese tailoring and vintage fabrics. Sage, 33, has been criticized
for an uncommercial approach, but his fine tailoring and handmade
buttons hark back to a time when department stores found it harder to
copy catwalk clothes. His romantic finale was rainbow-colored poplin
dresses, each with an antique embellishment.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Costelloe showed fun prints, including a floral bikini with
matching boots and bag.</TE>
<TE>   Originality was less in evidence at other shows. Ronit Zilkha went
with a hippy look and floral patterns on floaty skirts; Ashley Isham
re-created toweling turbans and 1960s beachwear.</TE>

<HD>A Baby and an Outcry</HD>
<DH>Nigerian who had child out of wedlock is sentenced to
death, but people worldwide are adamantly protesting</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GAYLE POLLARD-TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A photograph of a mother nursing her baby travels the world via
e-mail. It is an image of maternal bliss, of bonding, of life itself.
But the woman is Nigerian and she is not married. Because of that,
after Amina Lawal weans her daughter, she is to be buried in the
ground up to her chest and then stoned to death. Her crime: having a
baby out of wedlock.</LD>
<LD>   The sentence by a religious court has generated international
controversy and has created an unusual alliance of protesters, from
feminists to human rights activists, from book club members to beauty
queens.</LD>
<LD>   With the Miss World beauty pageant scheduled for Nov. 30 in
Nigeria, at least a half-dozen contestants say they won't participate
in the pageant if it is held before the execution is stayed. Pageant
organizer Julia Morley said from London on Monday that she has
received personal assurances from Nigeria's foreign minister, Dubem
Onyia, that the nation's constitution, which forbids such an extreme
punishment, would stand supreme.</LD>
<TE>   In the West African nation's "history of justice" no woman has
ever been punished in that manner, he pointed out. Only one other
woman has been sentenced to execution by stoning and her sentence was
reversed last month on a technicality.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Amnesty International, the London-based human rights
group, is circulating an open letter to Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo protesting the sentence and including a petition signed by
nearly 800,000 people from around the world.</TE>
<TE>   In an address to the United Nations General Assembly on Monday,
Obasanjo spoke of the poverty, hunger and disease in his country, and
of the nation's attempts to attract foreign investment, like the
tourist dollars from the Miss World pageant.</TE>
<TE>   But he made no mention of Lawal. At home, Obasanjo, who has the
authority to commute the sentence, has said only that "Nigeria will
weep" if the mother is killed.</TE>
<TE>   The Amnesty petition, with Lawal's photo attached, will be
delivered a week from today to the Nigerian High Commission, or
embassy, in London. That picture of a mother and child persuaded
Sandra Williams, an entertainment lawyer in L.A., to do something she
never does--sign a petition. "When I saw the photo of her, I realized
how young she is," Williams said. "She looks very vulnerable. She
looks like someone in my family." Williams forwarded the e-mail to
her Sisterfriends book club, a group of African American women who
meet monthly. Among them, Shirley Ann Harris, a junior high school
teacher, insisted of the petition, "We must get our vote in." After
Annette Parker-Goode, a legal analyst, looked at "that sweet little
baby," she too e-mailed her support. But she remained concerned. "She
may be spared, but they're not abolishing the law."</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, members of the book club met at the Torrance home of
Carmen Ramos-Kennedy, an advertising executive. They were joined by
women from the Rancho Palos Verdes chapter of The Links Inc., a black
women's international philanthropic organization.</TE>
<TE>   Most knew that Lawal, a 31-year-old village woman, lives in a
northern state governed by Sharia, a radical interpretation of
Islamic law. About a year after her divorce, Lawal got pregnant. Her
baby, now 9 months old, is "proof" of her adultery, according to the
Muslim judge who ordered her stoned to death in January 2004.</TE>
<TE>   The man Lawal identifies as the father denies paternity. Without a
confession, he cannot be found guilty under Sharia law, unless four
witnesses come forward, a virtually impossible legal burden.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing that really struck me was the part about the male
partner," said Paula Gibson, an anti-trust attorney who belongs to
the book club. "He was not punished because they indicated they had
insufficient evidence. Unless four people witnessed the sex act, he
could deny the baby was his. How can you deny it, if you're a woman?
You can't. The law completely exempted him from punishment." Gibson
said part of her family comes from the Caribbean, and because of that
she is sensitive to gender issues. "When my grandfather was still
alive, he had substantial property. My grandfather said this brother
is going to get this, this brother is going to get that, and this
male cousin is going to get that. Nowhere in the conversation was
anything said about women."</TE>
<TE>   Lawal's situation reminded Renee Kennard, also a member of
Sisterfriends and an airlines sales representative, of a difficult
time in her life 26 years ago. "I put myself in her place, because I
had a baby out of wedlock. I know the fear that she is feeling, not
knowing what the future will be." Kennard said her mistreatment came
from her church, a strict denomination that she will not name because
her mother remains in the church.</TE>
<TE>   "My mother said, 'If you ever get pregnant, I'm not going to have
anything to do with you,' " Kennard said. "At my church, you couldn't
sing in the choir. . You had to sit in the back. They called it being
silenced."</TE>
<TE>   The stoning sentence embarrasses Nigerians who live in the U.S.
"Why should we have two different legal systems? We have to let our
voices be heard," said Patrick Wiro, an L.A. County corrections
officer who on Saturday attended the Igbo Culture Day festivities at
Cal State Dominguez Hills. Igbos are one of Nigeria's largest
Christian ethnic groups.</TE>
<TE>   In Nigeria, millions have spoken out in newspapers, raised money
for Lawal's defense and have supported her in court. Of this nation's
120 million population, half are Christian, the other half Muslim,
demographics not lost on Obasanjo, the nation's first democratically
elected leader in nearly two decades. He is expected to stand for
reelection in February, nearly a year before Lawal's sentence would
be imposed.</TE>
<TE>   Her case is currently on appeal in the religious court, when those
proceedings conclude, the case will be heard by the federal court,
which supersedes state courts, including Sharia, and is expected to
reach Nigeria's supreme court.</TE>
<TE>   That's not good enough for the women who participated in Sunday's
discussion. They are asking others to get involved.</TE>
<TE>   "When I saw that picture," said Lillie Veale Wilson, the chair of
the Links' international trends and services committee, "in my soul,
I felt if you do this to one of us, you do it to all of us."</TE>

Nigerian woman sentenced to die by stoning, misidentified the chapter
of the Links Inc., a black women's philanthropic organization,

<LD>If there had been an ocean in Ohio, I would have walked into it, if
that's what it took to earn my way into my sorority.</LD>
<LD>   So I understand what may have led two young women to venture into
rough surf at Playa del Rey as part of a sorority initiation routine
last week. The women drowned during a late-night outing at Dockweiler
Beach, in what police have called an innocent accident but others
suspect may be the latest example of hazing turned deadly.</LD>
<LD>   The girls were not drunk or tied up or forced into the water,
police say. They apparently waded in as part of an initiation
routine, led by blind allegiance to a fraternal organization begun
almost a century ago with the highest of ideals.</LD>
<TE>   I was once like one of those young women, eager to belong and
willing to do whatever it took. And I am still loyal enough to my
sorority to want to close ranks now; to defend the honorable motives
behind cruel, generations-old rituals that made pledging a
life-changing force for me.</TE>
<TE>   I emerged stronger, tougher, more convinced of my abilities. I
learned to face down fear, to stand up for my friends, to keep
pushing even when the odds are against me.</TE>
<TE>   But what's the lesson when someone dies?</TE>
<TE>   By all accounts, pledging hasn't changed much since I joined my
sorority 25 years ago. Then and now, hazing by black fraternities and
sororities ranged from outright beatings for the men to paddling,
exercise to the point of exhaustion and humiliating pranks for both
women and men. There were positive aspects as well, of course. We had
to perform community service, learn our sorority's history and attend
nightly "study tables" to get our homework done, because good grades
mattered. And we had to wait on our big sisters hand and foot.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, the point never seemed to be brutality. "You value something
more when you suffer for it," one of our big sisters would explain,
as the others screamed at us, pushed us around and called us names.
The pledge process was to test our strength and demonstrate our
commitment, to build our sisterhood and bind us to this group through
sacred, secret rituals.</TE>
<TE>   It was not so different from the abuse meted out at boot camps to
toughen military recruits, or the team-building exercises used by
businesses and schools. And then again, it was not much different
from the "jumping in" process that street gangs use, where they beat
initiates to a bloody pulp and make the survivors part of the
brotherhood.</TE>
<TE>   Still, when I think back to my days on a pledge line, what I
recall most is not the humiliation, fear and brutality. Our cardinal
rule was if one pledge faltered, the whole group paid, and that
taught us collective responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   If your sister fails, it's because you didn't care.</TE>
<TE>   That's a powerful mantra that has stayed with me. And it's
something you can't learn if all you do to join a group is step up
and sign on the dotted line.</TE>
<TE>   We knew even back then that hazing was against the rules. But it
was an open secret that being a pledge meant being abused. A decade
ago, pledging went underground even further, when the national
governing body for the nine black Greek-letter groups scrapped the
pledging process in the face of a rising tide of injuries, lawsuits
and deaths.</TE>
<TE>   But efforts at reform have met with resistance among college
students, who view surviving the pledge process as a badge of honor
that raises your social status on campus and gives you stature among
fraternity and sorority brothers and sisters.</TE>
<TE>   "On the typical college campus there are immense pressures for
[pledges] to submit to the illegal pledge process," explains Lawrence
Ross Jr., a fraternity member and author of "The Divine Nine," a book
on black Greek organizations. "Pledges do it willingly because they
know the penalty for not going along is being ostracized socially on
campus."</TE>
<TE>   A University of Washington senior who asked that her name not be
used knows that hazard firsthand. Last fall, she pledged her
university's chapter of the same sorority the two drowned girls were
trying to join. But she and her seven "line sisters" dropped out days
into the process, after they were humiliated and forced to
participate in dangerous stunts, and one was slapped for laughing
during a comic entertainment routine.</TE>
<TE>   She had heard stories of brutal pledge rituals, "so when we first
got picked [to pledge], I asked if we were going to be getting hit,
and they said no. That's what led me to put my trust into these
girls. I didn't want to be part of something that would disrespect me
and then expect me to call them 'Sister' afterward."</TE>
<TE>   When the girls stopped pledging, the big sisters called them
quitters and warned they'd never live it down. Their grades dropped;
their social lives evaporated. They couldn't go out without being
called names and harassed. They were ostracized not just by members
of one sorority but by several black Greek groups, who blamed them
for threatening their sacred rituals by turning a spotlight on
illegal hazing.</TE>
<TE>   Their complaints to the school got the chapter suspended for a
semester. But their calls and letters to the national chapter brought
no response.When she heard about the deaths, "it just really hit me,"
she said. "That could have been me."</TE>
<TE>   As news of the deaths traveled last week, Ross' Web site on black
Greek life was inundated with messages from students around the
country. Some seem chastened, ready to back away from hazing. But
others were more concerned that the tragedy may spell an end to
secret rituals they consider integral to their fraternities and
sororities.</TE>
<TE>   At a candlelight vigil for the dead young women last week, the
college-age crowd of black Greeks stood largely silent as Ross
exhorted them to use the deaths to push for changes in the pledge
process, "because if we don't stand up, others will die."</TE>
<TE>   He is hopeful--if not optimistic--that the deaths could give
momentum to a movement among students to respect the ban on hazing
among black Greeks. Although at least nine young black men have died
nationwide during fraternity rituals since 1985, no one I talked to
had ever heard of women dying while pledging a black sorority. One
left behind a 2-year-old son.</TE>
<TE>   "How do you explain to a person who knows nothing about our
organization that you can die trying to become one of its members?"
Ross asked the crowd, as the families of the young women stood a few
feet away, their wails of sorrow competing with his speech.</TE>
<TE>   "Every one of you who says hazing builds character should be
forced to explain to this 2-year-old why his mommy isn't coming home
anymore."</TE>

<DL>BRENTWOOD, Tenn.</DL>
<LD>It happens every time Jeff Green and his wife go out to listen to
music. They hear an unfamiliar song, exchange a look, then pull out
notepads and pens.</LD>
<LD>   "Some people collect cuckoo clocks," Green said. "Some people
collect movie posters. We collect songs, and then classify them."</LD>
<LD>   Green and Lauren Virshup publish "The Green Book of Songs by
Subject." It's a more than 1,500-page monument to obsession that's as
fun for music fans to breeze through as it must have been tedious to
produce.</LD>
<TE>   We're talking more than 35,000 songs divided into more than 1,800
categories. Love songs alone take up 147 pages, sorted into subgroups
such as "Crushes" and "Don't Want to Break Up."</TE>
<TE>   The book--used by disc jockeys, libraries, public speakers and
basic popular-music geeks--has sold more than 20,000 copies since the
first edition was published in 1982. The fifth edition ($64.95) was
published in May through Green and Virshup's Professional Desk
References company.</TE>
<TE>   "Aside from its absolutely inestimable value in tracking down all
manner of music information, this tome appeals to people--like Jeff
Green and me--who have a lifelong tendency toward records trivia,"
said Adam White, a public relations executive at Universal Music
International.</TE>
<TE>   Parts of Green and Virshup's home south of Nashville are dominated
by "The Green Book." (Backups of the database are kept at "a secure
location" in case disaster strikes their home.)</TE>
<TE>   One room is packed with computers and notes about songs, and boxes
of "The Green Book" are stacked in the garage.</TE>
<TE>   Green, an executive editor at the Radio &amp; Records music industry
trade magazine, dashes about the room flush with nervous energy. A
pack rat, he still has loose-leaf binders full of song lists from the
days he kept records by hand.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to go into Tower Records at Columbus and Bay [streets] in
San Francisco, and I would actually copy down names of records,"
Green said. "Then I'd go to the library and listen to the songs, and
figure out where they fit."</TE>
<TE>   "The Green Book" was born the day the king of rock 'n' roll died.
Green was at the microphone at KSFS radio station at San Francisco
State University on Aug. 16, 1977.</TE>
<TE>   "Word came over the wire that Elvis Presley had passed away, and
we only had one record of Elvis in the college library," he said. "I
found a greatest hits album, and after I played it I still had
another hour and a half to go.</TE>
<TE>   "So I started thinking about everything about Elvis: Vegas and
Memphis and Cadillacs and doughnuts and songs that people had done
about Elvis. I played everything I could think of, and then ...
people started calling in and making suggestions. I was able to find
a number of those songs."</TE>
<TE>   A fellow deejay asked for suggestions for a show featuring car
songs, and another list was born. Green has been compiling song lists
ever since. He married Virshup in 1993, and she got seriously
involved in the book in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   "It started on recipe cards," Green said. "At that time a computer
was way out of my league, financially.... It worked its way into a
binder, and then a lot of binders."</TE>
<TE>   Green considers each lyric, and frets about misinterpretations.
Peter, Paul &amp; Mary's "Puff, the Magic Dragon" was listed under the
"Drugs: Marijuana" category, but Green later removed it after
determining that this popular assumption wasn't shared by songwriters
Peter Yarrow and Leonard Lipton.</TE>
<TE>   There's also the sheer volume of songs. Green concentrates on
prominent artists and songs but invariably goes astray.</TE>
<TE>   "There's more in the database than there is in the book," he said.
"We just couldn't physically cram more pages into it without going to
a really expensive printing process.... We have 147 pages of love
songs. It could have been 14,700.</TE>
<TE>   "But we wanted to at least give people a place to start. If they
want to find a song to dance to at a wedding, they can go to
devotional love songs. There are 200 there to choose from."</TE>
<TE>   Envisioned as a book for music industry professionals, "The Green
Book" has become popular in other fields.</TE>
<TE>   "We sold a copy to the San Diego Padres, National Public Radio and
ABC News," he said. "Public libraries and schools have been good
customers. Then there's the ministry angle. A number of churches want
to use secular music to reach their congregations. Music therapists
have bought it, and mobile deejays who do parties and weddings. Many
teachers find it useful."</TE>
<TE>   Green would like to bring the database to the Internet for a
subscription fee, or a CD-ROM, if it can be protected from piracy.
His Web site is at www.greenbookof songs.com.</TE>
<TE>   "There are thousands of albums released every year, so we never
really will catch up," he said. "In a sense, I don't have to worry
... if it never gets finished. As long as we keep doing it, it will
stay vital."</TE>

<TE>   T-BONE: There's nothing like it, right, Mac?</TE>
<TE>   Mac shakes and grass flies. Cleo enters.</TE>
<TE>   CLEO: Hey! Careful, Mac. I don't want to get grass on my crown!</TE>

<TE>   CLEO: It belonged to my grandmother--Queen Ann.</TE>

<TE>   CLEO: Oh, yeah ... of course....</TE>
<TE>   T-BONE: What does it mean?</TE>

<TE>   CLEO: Are you OK, T-Bone?</TE>
<TE>   T-BONE: (nodding) I-I meant to do that, uh, so I could finish
scratching my back on the grass!</TE>

<TE>   T-BONE: What's the matter, Cleo?</TE>
<TE>   CLIFFORD: Don't you want to scratch?</TE>
<TE>   CLEO: Well ... I was kind of hoping maybe you would scratch my

right for a princess to get all green and grass-stained....</TE>
<TE>   CLIFFORD: Ooooh. OK, Cleo -- I'll scratch your back.</TE>
<TE>   CLEO: Ha, ha! Yes!</TE>

<HD>Tea Master Offers a Glimpse Into a Ritual That's Steeped
in Tradition</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HILARY E. MacGREGOR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In World War II, Soshitsu Sen, who would become a 15th-generation
Japanese grand tea master, packed his tea box and utensils into his
luggage and headed off to war, trained as a kamikaze pilot. He
performed tea ceremonies for fellow pilots before they flew their
suicide missions against the United States and its allies in the
Pacific. The war ended before his number was called.</LD>
<LD>   Sen, now 79, was in Los Angeles the other day on a mission of
peace, having come from Kyoto to share an ancient Japanese cultural
tradition that remains mysterious to most Americans: Chado, or the
Way of Tea.</LD>
<LD>   "For those of you seeing the practice of tea for the first time,"
Sen told a full house at his lecture and tea demonstration in the
Bing Auditorium at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, on Sunday
afternoon, "You will wonder, 'Why is this being done?' 'Why is it so
complicated?' "</LD>
<TE>   A blend of Zen and Taoist principles, the Way of Tea celebrates
the beauty in the mundane, the superiority of spirit over matter,
tranquillity within busy lives. UC Irvine anthropology professor
Robert Garfias, who is president of the L.A. chapter of Chado
Urasenke (the particular school of tea ceremony that Sen teaches),
said tea is an immutable part of Japanese culture.</TE>
<TE>   "There is nothing quite like it in our culture," Garfias said.
"Really, it is the artistic essence of how you move through life.
They say in Japan, 'You have tea.' That means someone who not just
has the tea ceremony, but someone who has mastered it in the sense of
getting beyond the rules, the rituals, the procedures, so that it
becomes like second nature. You can tell by the way someone moves
into the room, just by the way the person kneels and slides the door,
whether they have tea or not."</TE>
<TE>   Wearing a dark kimono, the distinguished, gray-haired Sen stood on
a stage Sunday that had been transformed into a replica of a Japanese
tearoom, complete with tatami mats, screens, iron kettle, an alcove
with a scroll and a vase of California wildflowers. The delicate
fragrance of sandalwood incense wafted into the audience.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to a Western-style tea bag dipped in hot water, which
takes about 30 unfocused seconds to make, the elegant Urasenke tea
ceremony takes closer to 30 minutes. The ceremony is traditionally
performed in an intimate room made for that purpose. The ceremony can
be performed for a single guest in a private residence, or for a
small group in a temple, or teahouse. The point of the ceremony is
for the server to honor the guest, to unite the host and guest in a
concert of harmony. The ceremony involves precise etiquette on the
part of both the guests and the server. During Sen's demonstrations,
"guests" (played by students and teachers of Urasenke) entered a tiny
imaginary door on hands and knees, bowed to the flowers and the
hanging scroll that are an indispensable part of the ceremony, and
sat on their heels in the Seiza position to wait for their host.
They drank their tea deliberately with both hands, staring deep into
the ceramic bowl as they sipped.</TE>
<TE>   For the host, the ritual involves numerous elaborate utensils
laden with meaning and history, and the quiet mastery of hundreds of
prescribed movements that govern everything from how one enters the
room and moves one's feet across the floor, to the exquisitely
straight line of the back when ladling water from the kettle and the
delicacy with which one whisks the tea.</TE>
<TE>   For a Japanese, witnessing a perfect tea ceremony by a friend can
be one of life's sweetest moments--the savoring of a unique place,
time and relationship between people.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not coffee," Sen explained on Friday at the Beverly
Wilshire Hotel, as he imitated the casual, one-armed drinking style
of Americans imbibing their favorite caffeinated hot beverage while
reading, working, driving or talking. "Coffee is just a drink. With
tea there is a style, training. There are many rules. Behind tea
there is a philosophy...."</TE>
<TE>   A virtual cult figure among his followers, many of whom wave and
wilt like groupies when he passes, Sen also attended the firstNorth
American Tea Convention, which drew more than 700 tea practitioners
and curious Japanophiles. At LACMA on Sunday, Sen lectured on the
relationship between the Way of Tea and the arts of Japan, and to
perform an offertory tea ceremony for peace to open the World
Festival of Sacred Music.</TE>
<TE>   "He sees this as one of his big, continuing ways of
proselytizing," said Garfias. "He would like to see more non-Japanese
people involved. He sees tea as a way to peace."</TE>
<TE>   Zen monks first brought green tea back from China in the 12th
century. The tea, mixed from a vivid green powder of ground leaves,
was used by the monks as a stimulant to aid study and meditation.</TE>
<TE>   The tea was also valued for its medicinal properties. (A 1994
joint study of Shanghai residents by the National Cancer Institute
and the Shanghai Cancer Institute found that green tea consumption
cut the risk of developing stomach cancer by as much as half.)</TE>
<TE>   Fifty years ago, Sen created the first Urasenke tea groups outside
Japan. Today there are Urasenke associations in 32 countries. The Los
Angeles Urasenke Assn. is the largest and oldest group in North
America.</TE>
<TE>   Students of the Way of Tea say it is hard to understand the power
of the ritual until one studies it. The preparation of the tea is a
form of meditation. Many practitioners say the carefully scripted
movements allow them to enter a state of deep concentration much like
that which athletes describe when they talk of entering the zone--a
place where the individual can find freedom, effortlessness and grace
within movements that have been practiced thousands and thousands of
times.</TE>
<TE>   Many Americans have been seduced by the Way of Tea. Susan Becker,
53, of Thousand Oaks witnessed her first tea ceremony in a park in
Boston on an autumn day years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "The woman folded the fukusa (silk napkin) in such a way it
brought tears to my eyes," Becker recalled. "She communicated her
heart and soul in the way she folded that napkin." Becker has studied
tea for 14 years now. When her father turned 70 she made tea to honor
him.</TE>
<TE>   At the convention on Saturday, and again at LACMA on Sunday,
hundreds of people partook in tea ceremony. First they ate the
seasonal sweets, served on tiny white napkins by kimono-clad women.
Then, while the sweetness still lingered on their tongues, they
sipped the frothy, bright green tea, with its slightly bitter flavor
of sweet, spring grass.</TE>
<TE>   "You have now drunk the tea," Sen said to a small group of guests
on Sunday. "How was the taste? You have probably got a lot of
energy!"</TE>

<HD>Rigases Seek to Tap Adelphia Insurance</HD>
<DH>Telecom: They want the freeze lifted on the firm's assets
so its coverage can help pay their legal bills.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF ST. ONGE</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Adelphia Communications Corp.'s former Chief Executive John J. Rigas
and three sons who were board members want to use the cable TV
company's insurance to help pay their legal bills.</LD>
<LD>   Rigas and his sons are asking a federal bankruptcy judge to lift a
freeze on Adelphia assets and allow them to tap into $50 million in
directors and officers insurance policies to cover "several million
dollars" of expected legal bills.</LD>
<LD>   Rigas and sons Timothy, James and Michael face dozens of
shareholder suits, a lawsuit by Adelphia and a civil complaint by the
Securities and Exchange Commission. John, Timothy and Michael Rigas
also face criminal fraud charges. Adelphia sought Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection in June amid more than $20 billion of debt and
seven straight years of losses.</LD>
<TE>   "We typically see defendants and potential defendants who haven't
yet been found guilty doing whatever they can to get whatever money
they can" to help fund their defense, said Alistaire Bambach, an SEC
lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   In court papers filed Friday, Rigas and his sons said they should
receive proceeds from the policies to ensure their rights "are not
substantially and irreparably harmed." The insurance doesn't cover
criminal defense costs, the filing said.</TE>
<TE>   A hearing on the Rigases' request is scheduled for Oct. 8 before
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Gerber in Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence G. McMichael, a lawyer for the Rigases, said: "We filed
the motion to get an assurance for the directors and officers
insurance carriers that there's no bankruptcy law reason why they
shouldn't honor their obligations."</TE>
<TE>   Marc Abrams, Adelphia's bankruptcy lawyer, didn't immediately
return a request for comment. Daniel Golden, a lawyer for Adelphia
bondholders, didn't return a call.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia, based in Coudersport, Pa., recently sued John Rigas and
family members, claiming they used company money to buy and improve
New York apartments, a golf course and other property.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, Adelphia had a loss of $101.8 million, or 41 cents a
share, in June on revenue of $281.9 million, it said in a filing with
the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York. In July, Adelphia had a loss
of $72.1 million, or 29 cents a share, on $269.9 million in revenue.
Interest expense for the two months was $130.2 million.</TE>

<HD>Bank Seeks Lead Status in AOL Suits</HD>
<DH>Litigation: More than a dozen complaints have been filed,
alleging that the media company used improper accounting to boost its
share price.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS S. MULLIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Amalgamated Bank of New York applied Monday for lead-plaintiff status
in shareholder litigation accusing AOL Time Warner Inc. of fleecing
investors by inflating its sales and revenue through phony accounting
and misleading financial statements.</LD>
<LD>   Monday was the deadline for filing motions with Judge Shirley Wohl
Kram in U.S. District Court in Manhattan to seek lead position in the
case.</LD>
<LD>   It could not be learned Monday how many others met the deadline,
but more than a dozen shareholder lawsuits have been filed.
Typically, such lawsuits are consolidated and the lead plaintiff
takes control over legal strategy.</LD>
<TE>   Amalgamated, union-owned and an activist in shareholder-rights
issues, says it has lost more than $56 million on its original
investments in Time Warner Inc. and America Online Inc., which merged
in early 2001 to form the huge media company. Since the merger, the
total value of AOL Time Warner stock has declined by about $125
billion.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a flat-out travesty for shareholders, and we feel
duped," said Ron Luraschi, senior vice president of Amalgamated,
which is owned by UNITE, the large New York-based garment-workers
union.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner declined to comment on the litigation, spokeswoman
Tricia Primrose said.</TE>
<TE>   Amalgamated's lawyer is William Lerach of Milberg Weiss Bershad
Hynes &amp; Lerach. The firm dominates the field of shareholder
litigation and represents the University of California Regents, lead
plaintiffs in litigation against Enron Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Amalgamated's case will build on allegations in a lawsuit that
Lerach filed in July on behalf of an individual shareholder, Steven
Schmalz. That complaint alleges that in the year after the merger was
announced but before it closed, America Online artificially inflated
its sales and profit by improperly booking revenue from certain
advertising deals.</TE>
<TE>   The phantom gains kept AOL's stock price up during the crucial
period while the deal was pending and misled investors about the
company's prospects, the complaint says.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner, which is under investigation by the Justice
Department and Securities and Exchange Commission, has admitted
improperly recording $49 million in advertising revenue from three
America Online transactions that took place before the merger was
completed.</TE>
<TE>   Plaintiffs against AOL Time Warner have one advantage that those
who have filed suit against Enron  Corp. do not, Lerach said in an
interview Monday evening: Because the merger involved a new issuance
of shares, investors under federal law do not have to prove fraud to
recover damages, he said. All that is necessary is to show that there
were material misstatements in AOL Time Warner's financial reports
and the proxy and registration statements associated with the merger,
he said.</TE>

<HD>Rehnquist Denies Stay for Massive Asbestos Trial</HD>
<DH>Manufacturing: Exxon Mobil, two others are awaiting the
Supreme Court's decision on whether to hear appeal.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Supreme Court on Monday rejected two requests by companies
seeking to delay the start of a massive West Virginia asbestos trial
while the high court considers their appeal in the case.</LD>
<LD>   In one request, Exxon Mobil Corp. and industrial conglomerate
Honeywell International Inc. asked the court to stay the Sept. 23
trial in Charleston, W.Va., pending a decision on whether it would
hear the appeal.</LD>
<LD>   A second similar request was filed with the high court by
Owens-Illinois Inc.</LD>
<TE>   In the appeal, the companies are challenging as unfair the single
mass trial in which about 8,000 people who claim they were exposed to
asbestos have sued about 250 defendants, including various groups of
employers, building owners and manufacturers.</TE>
<TE>   Although the two applications for a stay were denied by Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist without comment, the companies could
resubmit the requests with another Supreme Court member.</TE>
<TE>   One of the main attorneys for the companies, Walter Dellinger, was
not immediately available for comment on Rehnquist's action.</TE>
<TE>   As an alternative to a stay of the trial, the companies urged the
high court to speed up consideration of the appeal so a decision
would be made before Sept. 23.</TE>
<TE>   The high court is on recess, but is expected to consider the
appeal right before the start of its new term Oct. 7.</TE>
<TE>   At issue in the appeal was a decision by the Supreme Court of
Appeals of West Virginia that endorsed the consolidation of thousands
of product-liability claims into a single proceeding.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, there have been an increasing number of lawsuits
filed by people seeking huge damages for asbestos exposure.</TE>
<TE>   Asbestos was widely used for fireproofing and insulation until the
1970s, when its use was curtailed after scientists concluded that
inhaled asbestos fibers could be linked to lung cancer and other
diseases.</TE>
<TE>   But asbestos-related sicknesses can take years to materialize.
With lawsuits spiking in the last three years, about 50 U.S.
corporations are already in bankruptcy because of asbestos
liabilities.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the companies being sued now did not manufacture asbestos,
but sold products containing it--such as brake linings in cars.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the U.S. Senate is moving ahead with plans to reexamine
asbestos liability issues. The Senate Judiciary Committee has
tentatively scheduled a hearing on the subject for Sept. 25, said a
spokeswoman for committee chairman Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.).</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Isis Pharmaceuticals Inc. said it and rival Sequitur Inc. have
settled three patent infringement lawsuits involving biotechnology
research. Terms weren't disclosed.</LD>
<LD>   Isis said it granted licenses for certain patents to Sequitur,
which agreed to make payments to Isis and limit the types of
chemistry, called antisense, it can use in research. Isis had claimed
that Sequitur was using Isis technology without permission.</LD>
<LD>   "The settlement terms underscore the importance of Isis'
intellectual property position in antisense technology," Isis Chief
Financial Officer B. Lynne Parshall said.</LD>
<TE>   Representatives of Natick, Mass.-based Sequitur could not be
reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Carlsbad-based Isis rose 28 cents to $9.25 on Nasdaq.
The announcement was made after the close of regular U.S. trading.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Adaptec Inc. said it would fire about 200 employees, or 12% of its
work force, as slower-than-expected sales probably would result in a
loss for the current quarter instead of the profit analysts expected.</LD>
<LD>   The Milpitas-based maker of computer connector cards said the job
cuts and the closure of a plant would result in a charge of about $7
million for its fiscal second quarter.</LD>
<LD>   The company expects break-even results to a loss of 4 cents a
share for the quarter, excluding the charge, with sales of $86.2
million to $91.6 million. Analysts on average were expecting profit
of 1 cent, with sales of $92.4 million.</LD>
<TE>   Adaptec shares fell to $4.75 in extended trading. Before the
announcement, the shares fell 12 cents to $5.48 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Chevron to Market Texaco Brand</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>ChevronTexaco Corp., reclaiming one of the oil industry's best-known
brand names, plans to start selling Texaco gasoline at its retail
stations in two years, it said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   ChevronTexaco, the No. 2 U.S. oil company, will begin marketing
the Texaco brand and its star logo throughout the United States on
July 1, 2004, when two exclusive licensing agreements expire.</LD>
<LD>   Rights to the Texaco banner-- made famous in advertisements that
claimed you could trust your car to the man who wears a star--
currently are held by a partnership of Royal Dutch/Shell Group and
Saudi Refining Inc.</LD>
<TE>   ChevronTexaco gave up exclusive rights to the banner in the United
States when Texaco sold its interest in two oil refining ventures to
Shell and Saudi Refining in a $3.86-billion deal. That deal helped
clear the way for Chevron's purchase last year of Texaco.</TE>
<TE>   Shell and Saudi Refining will hold exclusive rights on the brand
until July 1, 2004, and nonexclusive rights until June 30, 2006.
Shell previously has said it will spend $500 million to stamp its
brand on thousands of gasoline stations it bought from ChevronTexaco.</TE>
<TE>   Shell will put its brand on roughly 90% of the 13,000 Texaco
stations it acquired as part of the deal, while about 10% will be
closed, it has said.</TE>
<TE>   ChevronTexaco did not disclose details of its rebranding plans,
but said it has notified antitrust regulators of its decision to
start marketing Texaco gasoline.</TE>
<TE>   "Chevron and Texaco are both premium quality brands, and together
will position our company as a premier marketer of gasoline and
lubricant products in the United States," Dave Reeves,
ChevronTexaco's president of North American products, said.</TE>
<TE>   ChevronTexaco now markets the star brand in Europe, West Africa,
Latin America and the Caribbean.</TE>

<HD>Citigroup to Give More Guidance on Loan Coverage</HD>
<DH>Financial services: The change comes as the firm is close
to settling charges that Associates engaged in predatory lending.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Citigroup Inc., facing allegations the former Associates First
Capital Corp. gouged unsophisticated borrowers, said Monday that it
will give customers more information when they buy credit insurance
and cut some fees on home loans.</LD>
<LD>   The biggest financial services company plans to train 11,000
employees in 1,600 branches to make sure customers know that credit
insurance, which covers home loan payments in case of death or
disability, is optional, according to a memo from Mike Knapp, chief
executive of CitiFinancial, the unit that makes the loans.</LD>
<LD>   The changes come as the New York company is close to settling
allegations that Associates, which it bought in November 2000,
engaged in predatory lending, charging excessive interest rates and
fees for customers with low incomes and histories of unpaid bills.
Federal and state regulators also are looking into whether Citigroup
misled investors with biased stock research and handed out initial
public offering shares to favored clients.</LD>
<TE>   In the memo, Knapp said the changes take into account the
"guidance we have received from regulators, advocacy groups and
elected officials."</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup shares, which have fallen 38% this year, rose 50 cents
to $29.88 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup may pay about $200 million to settle Federal Trade
Commission allegations concerning Associates. The case included
charges that the company didn't make clear to customers that they
were paying extra for credit insurance. The settlement would be the
agency's biggest consumer protection settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup said it will reduce the maximum upfront fee on home
equity and second mortgage loans to 3 percentage points from 5.
Salespeople also will quote loan payments without credit insurance
before telling borrowers the cost with the insurance and will provide
borrowers with more "customer-friendly" brochures on insurance
options, the memo said.</TE>
<TE>   Associates also had been accused of pressuring consumers to buy a
single-premium form of credit insurance, a product Citigroup last
year agreed to stop selling once it obtained state approvals to sell
a monthly-premium version. Citigroup won't sell it in any states
after Oct. 1, said spokeswoman Maria Mendler.</TE>
<TE>   The cost of single-premium insurance was added to the amount of
the loan, rather than being paid separately on a monthly schedule.
Critics said this raised the debt burden, putting borrowers at higher
risk of defaulting and losing equity in their homes.</TE>
<TE>   The FTC filed suit against Citigroup in March 2001, saying
Associates charged as much as 8% as a fee to make a loan and
"aggressively solicited" borrowers to take out new loans and
refinance their existing debts.</TE>
<TE>   In August 2001, Citigroup cut ties with more than 3,600 Associates
brokers who arranged loans for the company but were not Citigroup
employees.</TE>

<HD>Cyber Panel Scales Back Proposals for Security</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>D. IAN HOPPER and TED BRIDIS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Under intense lobbying by industry groups, a White House panel
studying ways to protect the nation's high-tech backbone has dropped
several security ideas and turned others into topics for discussion
rather than government mandates, according to the latest version of
the plan circulated Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The ideas that have been dropped include requiring companies to
pay money into a fund to improve national computer security and
restricting use of emerging wireless networks until their security is
approved, according to the draft obtained by Associated Press.</LD>
<LD>   "We're just identifying the stuff we already know to be a problem,
and saying it's a problem," said Russ Cooper of network security firm
TruSecure Corp. who was briefed on the plan. "I thought there was
going to be some meat, and there's not."</LD>
<TE>   The cybersecurity panel headed by President Bush's computer
security advisor, Richard Clarke, is expected to release its
recommendations Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Clarke advisor Andy Purdy said Monday that the panel has decided
to put its ideas out for public comment for two months before sending
it to the president.</TE>
<TE>   Once called the "National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace," the
draft circulated Monday added the words "For Comment" to the title.</TE>
<TE>   The board is part of the White House but has no statutory power to
compel federal agencies or companies to follow its directives.
Officials have previously noted that much of the nation's high-tech
backbone--its banking, transportation and utilities networks--is
owned and operated by private corporations.</TE>
<TE>   Within the last week, officials removed a proposal to create an
Internet fund built with tax dollars and industry contributions to
pay for Internet security enhancements, the latest draft shows.</TE>
<TE>   Security expert Bruce Schneier said the White House won't be able
to convince companies that expensive security enhancements are worth
it when the company's stock price is at stake.</TE>
<TE>   "The government should either make a law or not bother," Schneier
said. "This cajoling only goes so far. I think [companies] do want to
be good corporate citizens, as long as it's free."</TE>
<TE>   Another dropped proposal would have called for companies to work
on securing wireless networks and barred the use of such networks
until they could be proved secure. Wireless technology, which is
increasingly cheap and easy to use, has been criticized as difficult
to secure.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the plan says only that "federal agencies should consider
installing systems that continuously check for unauthorized
connections to their networks." The rest of the wireless network
proposal is under the heading "Issues highlighted for continued
analysis, debate and discussion."</TE>

<HD>SEC to Consider Disclosure of Proxy Votes</HD>
<DH>Investments: Proposed rule would require mutual funds to
include the records in their reports to the agency.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICKY STAMAS</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Securities and Exchange Commission will consider this week
whether to require mutual funds to reveal how they vote shares in
corporate proxy contests.</LD>
<LD>   The five-member SEC is scheduled to take up a proposed rule
Thursday that would force funds to report their proxy voting records
to the SEC and to make the information available to their
shareholders.</LD>
<LD>   The action on the proposed rule comes as the SEC is trying to
restore investor confidence shaken by accounting scandals at Enron
Corp., WorldCom Inc. and other companies.</LD>
<TE>   Supporters of greater disclosure say investors want mutual funds
to play a bigger role in demanding accountability from companies.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a real feeling going on today with all of these scandals
that corporate America is running wild and investors are wondering,
'Can our voice be heard at all?' " said Don Phillips, managing
director of mutual fund tracker Morningstar Inc. in Chicago. "Mutual
funds are the natural conduit for that."</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the proposed rule say the plan may overload investors
with information they don't need.</TE>
<TE>   "If the disclosure reaches the point where you include everything
of interest to someone, you are going to have so much information
that it starts to obscure the key information," said Chris
Wloszczyna, a spokesman for the Investment Company Institute, the
funds' chief trade association in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "Our members say that very few of their shareholders have ever
expressed an interest in their funds' proxy votes," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Shareholder activists have increasingly sought to put governance
issues to shareholder vote at annual meetings by including them on
official proxy ballots. Some investor advocates, for instance, have
called for proxy contests on whether companies should formally record
employee stock options as expenses.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC also is scheduled to consider whether it should require
funds and other registered management investment companies to
disclose the policies and procedures they use to determine how they
vote proxies for securities in their portfolios.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed rule would require funds to disclose those policies
to clients and tell clients how to get information about individual
proxy votes, the SEC said.</TE>

<LD>Marvel Enterprises Inc., the publisher of "Spider-Man" comic books,
said Allen Lipson will become chief executive after Peter Cuneo
retires at the end of the year.</LD>
<LD>   Lipson, 59, has been Marvel's executive vice president of business
and legal affairs since November 1999. Cuneo will continue to serve
as a board member and advisor, the company said.</LD>
<LD>   Cuneo, 58, who became CEO in July 1999, has been credited with
helping the New York-based publisher rebuild interest in Spider-Man,
X-Men and its other comic book characters. Marvel also publishes "The
Incredible Hulk" and "Daredevil" comic books.</LD>
<TE>   The company reported a second-quarter profit, helped by licensing
from "Spider-Man," which has generated about $800 million in
worldwide box office sales as of last month. Marvel's shares closed
Monday at $16.60, up 24 cents, on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Tech Stocks Fall; Dow Rises</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Investor concerns about Iraq and upcoming
earnings reports help push shares mostly lower.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks ended mostly lower in light trading Monday, with some players
off for the observance of Yom Kippur.</LD>
<LD>   Worries about a potential U.S.-Iraq conflict weighed on markets
for much of the day. After regular trading ended, Iraq said it would
readmit United Nations weapons inspectors--news that helped send oil
futures down sharply.</LD>
<LD>   But the White House later said it was skeptical of Iraq's offer.</LD>
<TE>   On Wall Street most major indexes closed with slight gains or
small losses, though the Dow Jones industrial average rose 67.49
points, or 0.8%, to 8,380.18, boosted by defense stocks.</TE>
<TE>   The Nasdaq composite slid 15.52 points, or 1.2%, to 1,275.88 amid
another sell-off in semiconductor shares.</TE>
<TE>   The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 inched up 1.29 points to 891.10.</TE>
<TE>   Losers outnumbered winners by 18 to 14 on the New York Stock
Exchange and by 21 to 11 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   The Commerce Department reported Monday that U.S. business
inventories rose 0.4% in July. It was the third straight month of
gains, offering hope for a strengthening economic recovery.</TE>
<TE>   Still, analysts said investors remained nervous about the
potential for war with Iraq. Those fears helped fuel three weeks of
declines among key market indexes.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, President Bush continued to press for United Nations
action against Saddam Hussein, telling Iowans in a speech that "if
Iraq's regime continues to defy us and the world [the United States]
will move deliberately yet decisively to hold Iraq to account."</TE>
<TE>   Late in the day Iraq's announcement that it would readmit U.N.
inspectors sent oil futures for October delivery down $1.38, or 4.7%,
to $28.29 a barrel in after-hours electronic trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. It was the biggest drop since April 12.</TE>
<TE>   Crude futures had eased 14 cents in regular trading.</TE>
<TE>   Apart from war worries, investors are showing concern about
third-quarter corporate earnings, analysts said. Those reports will
begin to dominate business headlines in about three weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "Investors are a little apprehensive about sticking their foot in
the water ahead of [earnings] reports that could dictate the
direction of the market," said Todd Salamone, director of trading at
Schaeffer's Investment Research in Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   Treasury bond yields traded lower for much of the session Monday,
but rose toward the close as stocks showed more strength.</TE>
<TE>   In currency trading the yen fell to its lowest level in 12 weeks
against the dollar on speculation Japan may sell its currency to
boost growth in the world's second-largest economy. The dollar closed
at 122.24 yen in New York, up from 121.73 on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Among the day's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Defense shares rose on war jitters. United Technologies gained
$1.80 to $59.80, General Dynamics jumped $3.58 to $86.60 and Northrop
Grumman was up $2 to $128.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Boeing added $1.65 to $37.23. The company on Friday avoided
a strike that would have halted airliner production.</TE>
<TE>   * Oracle slid 45 cents, or 4.6%, to $9.28 ahead of its quarterly
earnings report this week. According to Thomson First Call, analysts
expect the world's third-largest software maker to earn 7 cents a
share in the latest quarter.</TE>
<TE>   * Texas Instruments fell 73 cents to $18.27 after Prudential
Securities lowered its rating for the world's largest supplier of
mobile-phone chips to reflect slowing demand for its products.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. analyst Mark Lipacis cut his 2002 and
2003 revenue and earnings estimates for PMC-Sierra Inc., Applied
Micro Circuits Corp. and Vitesse Semiconductor Corp. They make chips
for telecom companies.</TE>
<TE>   PMC-Sierra dropped 48 cents to $5.36, Applied Micro lost 33 cents
to $3.44 and Vitesse was off 4 cents to $1.23.</TE>
<TE>   * Among financial stocks, Fannie Mae lost $1.72 to $70.98. The
mortgage giant said the home loan refinancing wave is causing a
mismatch in its assets and liabilities as loans are retired. But it
said the mismatch can be fixed without hurting earnings.</TE>
<TE>   Also, MGIC Investment, the largest seller of private mortgage
insurance, tumbled $6.53 to $48.70, after saying second-half profit
will fall short of analysts' expectations as mortgage delinquencies
rise.</TE>

<LD>   The state is producing too few scientists, engineers and
technicians to meet industry demands, according to the Santa Monica
think tank. It is a gap that California so far has bridged by luring
workers from other states and nations. High-tech hotbeds such as
Silicon Valley have been a magnet for entrepreneurs from Indianapolis
to India.</LD>
<LD>   This abundance of technology talent is one reason California
currently ranks near the top in the Milken Institute's new State
Technology and Science Index, which ranks all 50 states in terms of
their competitiveness in the new economy. California is No. 3, behind
Massachusetts and Colorado.</LD>
<TE>   But with demand for skilled workers rising in competing tech
centers around the world, California may be unable to import enough
talent to meet its shortfall in coming years, according to Ross
DeVol, director of regional studies at the Milken Institute.</TE>
<TE>   "The real risk is that we can't attract enough of them in the
future," DeVol said. "There are going to be more opportunities
locally for them in their own countries."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, California's growing number of poorly educated citizens
poses a huge challenge to an economy increasingly driven by knowledge
and innovation, DeVol said.</TE>
<TE>   California ranks 43rd nationally on the strength of the verbal SAT
scores of its college-bound students, and in the bottom half of all
states based on average math SAT scores.</TE>
<TE>   The skills deficit is particularly acute among Latinos. Previous
research has shown that only 8% of California's adult Latinos have at
least a bachelor's degree, compared with 33% of non-Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   That education gap that has proved stubborn, persisting into the
second and third generations after families immigrate to the U.S.,
and it could have huge negative consequences for the state's economy
in the not-so-distant future, given that Latinos will make up the
majority of California's work force by 2025.</TE>
<TE>   "From an economic standpoint, it's going to place an upward limit
on how fast we can grow ... and the types of industries we attract,"
DeVol said. "It also will exacerbate income inequality."</TE>
<TE>   The Milken study recommends greater efforts to prepare
Californians, particularly Latinos and African Americans, for science
and technology careers in order to support the high-tech economy.</TE>
<TE>   Milken's first State Technology and Science Index was underwritten
by TechVentures Network, formerly known as the Bay Area Regional
Technology Alliance, which wanted to know how California stacked up
against other states in terms of the building blocks needed to create
and sustain a vibrant high-tech economy.</TE>
<TE>   The index examined such components as research and development
spending, educational institutions, venture capital, entrepreneurial
networks, human capital and technology concentration.</TE>
<TE>   The good news is that California's science and technology assets,
which Milken researchers have pegged as the main ingredients for
success in the 21st century, put it near the top of the heap.</TE>
<TE>   Rounding out the top 10 behind California are Maryland, Virginia,
Washington, New Jersey, Connecticut, Utah and Minnesota. Arkansas
trailed the pack with a 50th rank.</TE>

<HD>Million-Dollar Home Sales Soar 25% in July Amid Stock
Losses</HD>
<DH>Real estate: Amid stock market losses, purchases of
properties priced at more than $1 million rise 25% after increasing
48% in the second quarter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In July, as stock prices tumbled to their lowest level in five years,
America's wealthiest people went house hunting.</LD>
<LD>   Sales of homes priced at more than $1 million rose 25% in July to
1,702 from a year earlier, as measured by research firm DataQuick
Information Systems. The increase followed a 48% rise in
million-dollar sales during the second quarter. The largest
percentage gains in both periods were for homes with prices exceeding
$10 million.</LD>
<LD>   With the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index headed for its third straight
down year, more rich Americans are seeing real estate as a secure
place to put their money, property brokers said. Housing is a key
reason why the economy hasn't slipped back into recession, according
to economists.</LD>
<TE>   "The stock market has been a foe to some, but it's been a friend
to real estate," said John Burns, president of Burns Real Estate
Consulting Inc. in Irvine. Wealthy Americans are "moving a greater
part of their net worth into luxury housing," he said.</TE>
<TE>   By segment, sales of homes priced from $1 million to $5 million
grew 48% to 5,400 in the second quarter, while sales of $5-million to
$10-million homes rose 23% to 28, and sales more than $10 million
more than doubled, to 19 from 6, according to DataQuick.</TE>
<TE>   In Aspen, Colo., Robert Ritchie, a real estate broker with Coates,
Reid &amp; Waldron, said he sold a 12,000-square-foot home two weeks ago
to a chief executive who took money out of the stock market. Ritchie
wouldn't name the CEO.</TE>
<TE>   "All our buyers are saying that--'I'm putting my money into hard
assets,' " Ritchie said. "These are the guys who really know what's
happening, the guys who run our economy."</TE>
<TE>   After dropping 10% in 2000 and 13% in 2001, the S&amp;P 500, the most
widely followed benchmark for the U.S. stock market, is down a
further 23% this year.</TE>
<TE>   Home prices gained 7.4% in the second quarter from a year earlier
and home re-sales are on pace to beat last year's record 5.3 million,
according to the National Assn. of Realtors.</TE>
<TE>   "Housing has been the primary driver of economic activity,
particularly over the last year," said Richard Yamarone, senior
economist with Argus Research Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Gains in home prices amid the stock market decline have sparked
concern of a housing "bubble."</TE>
<TE>   The rate at which home loans went into foreclosure rose to the
highest level in almost half a century, to 0.40% of all mortgages, in
the second quarter as job losses caused Americans to fall behind on
payments, said the Mortgage Bankers Assn. of America.</TE>
<TE>   "About a third of U.S. markets are overpriced," Burns said. "That
doesn't mean that we have a bubble that's going to crash next week."</TE>
<TE>   Boston certainly shows signs of being in a price bubble, he said.
New York is "slightly overpriced," as are San Francisco and San Jose,
Burns said. Those arguing against a bubble point out that low
mortgage rates have made buying a home more affordable, and that the
larger homes being built may account for some of the price gains.</TE>

<LD>Red Hat Inc. has formed a partnership with computer giant IBM Corp.
under which the Linux company will strike up a cozier relationship
with Big Blue's hardware, services and software divisions, the
companies said.</LD>
<LD>   Under the alliance, Red Hat's new and more expensive software,
called Red Hat Advanced Server, will be sold by IBM's consulting
division and run across four lines of IBM servers and mainframes.</LD>
<LD>   In trading on Nasdaq, shares of Red Hat were at $5.84, up 59
cents, or 11%. IBM shares were down 18 cents to $72.32 on the NYSE.</LD>
<TE>   The agreement addresses what has become a troubling issue for the
8-year-old Red Hat: how to make money on the Linux operating system,
which is essentially available free on the Internet.</TE>

<LD>* U.S. retail gasoline prices rose 0.6 cent to $1.40 a gallon in the
week ended Monday, the Department of Energy reported. The rise in the
nationwide average cost of regular gasoline left prices 12.8 cents
less than a year ago, the weekly survey of 900 filling stations
showed. Regular gasoline prices were highest on the West Coast, where
they fell 0.7 cent to $1.52 a gallon.</LD>
<LD>   * WorldCom Inc. said it will cut 2,000 jobs, or a quarter of its
work force in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, as the U.S.
telecommunications company tries to make its overseas operations
profitable by paring costs.</LD>
<LD>   * Toyota Motor Corp. will hire 700 people at a plant in Cambridge,
Canada, to lift output to 250,000 cars a year as the world's
third-largest auto maker adds North American capacity because of
sales gains. The 14% production increase, to be completed by the end
of next year, follows a previously announced expansion to 220,000
vehicles from 200,000 at the factory.</LD>

<LD>   The 0.4% increase in inventories was the strongest since November
2000 and followed a 0.3% gain in June, the Commerce Department said.
Sales at U.S. businesses jumped 1.2%, four times the previous month's
gain and the largest rise since April.</LD>
<LD>   The inventory-to-sales ratio for all businesses, which measures
the time goods are unsold, fell to 1.35 months in July from 1.36
months in June. The ratio matched April's, which was the lowest on
record.</LD>

<LD>More American consumers are using debit cards to purchase goods than
credit cards as they seek ways to keep a closer eye on their
spending, according to a survey by Visa U.S.A.</LD>
<LD>   During the first six months of the year, there were 3.04 billion
Visa debit card transactions, compared with 2.96 billion credit card
transactions, the credit card company said.</LD>
<LD>   Credit card transactions still have a higher combined dollar
value, as they tend to be used to purchase bigger-ticket items.</LD>
<TE>   Visa said 60% of those surveyed used check cards so they could
carry less cash, and 70% said using a debit card gave them a better

<LD>The World Trade Organization ruled that the United States violated

the latest in a series of WTO rulings against duties imposed by the
United States to protect domestic producers from subsidized imports.</LD>

<HD>2 Agencies Close Commercial Operations, Blame SAG</HD>
<DH>Hollywood: The talent firms say ad business was crippled by
the actors' six-month strike two years ago. The guild says other
factors also contributed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANITA M. BUSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Blaming the Screen Actors Guild for its six-month commercial strike
two years ago, two long-established Los Angeles-based talent agencies
representing commercial actors are shuttering their ad operations,
affecting an estimated 1,400 performers.</LD>
<LD>   DDK Talent Representatives, which represents more than 600
commercial actors, will close Friday, and Abrams-Rubaloff &amp; Lawrence
is in the process of notifying 800 of its actors that its on-camera
and voice-over division will shut down Sept. 27.</LD>
<LD>   DDK has been in the commercial business for 12 years.
Abrams-Rubaloff has been in the business since 1965.</LD>
<TE>   "By necessity, we are changing our economic model," said
Abrams-Rubaloff &amp; Lawrence owner and President Richard Lawrence, who
also said the slowdown in the ad market was a factor. "When I bought
the company in 1984, the commercial division accounted for 70% of the
company's revenue. Now it's less than 20%. It was declining before
the strike, but the strike completely nailed us. It took away about
30% of our business, which is the difference between profit and
loss."</TE>
<TE>   Abrams-Rubaloff will continue to operate its other divisions,
which include television packaging and representing TV producers,
directors and hosts. It also plans to expand into the television
literary business.</TE>
<TE>   The closures come against a backdrop of increasing discord between
the guild and Hollywood's talent agencies, which are arguing over
basic rules governing their relationship.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm keeping my corporation open but ending my day-to-day
representation of commercial actors. I am entertaining another
business opportunity, and I would never have entertained that
opportunity if it weren't for the strike," said David DeLorenzo,
president of DDK. "The strike decimated what was a very healthy
industry because of what I see as bad decision-making on the part of
the Screen Actors Guild. The vote that created the commercial strike
of 2000 was manipulated by disinformation, misinformation and
propaganda by the Screen Actors Guild."</TE>
<TE>   The guild disputes those charges. "We achieved significant gains
during the strike, and overall, it was beneficial to our members.
While the commercial production levels didn't go back to the same
levels, that's true, it's an unfair assessment to totally blame the
union for the levels of production," said SAG spokeswoman Ilyanne
Kichaven. "The overall economy and production levels were down due to
Sept. 11."</TE>
<TE>   The commercial strike, which began in May 2000 under the
leadership of former SAG President William Daniels, lasted for six
months and became the longest strike in Hollywood's history. The
strike was a costly one for both the Screen Actors Guild and the
American Federation of Television &amp; Radio Artists, which together
lost more than $200 million in earnings, by their own accounts. The
city also suffered an estimated $270-million loss in crew wages and
vendor payments.</TE>
<TE>   "Advertising has continued in one way or the other, but
post-strike much of it has been outside the U.S.," said Steve Caplan,
senior vice president of external affairs for the Assn. of
Independent Commercial Producers. "The strike accelerated the trend
of global production, so many people have felt the impact of that in
Los Angeles and other production centers within the U.S. Commercial
production in the Los Angeles area has not fully recovered from the
strike."</TE>
<TE>   Although the union did not receive everything it demanded during
the strike, actors did receive a nearly 150% increase in residuals
for cable television. Under terms of the deal, actors' flat fee rose
from $1,014 for 1,000 units of cable use to $1,706 the year after and
to $2,460 in three years.</TE>
<TE>   DeLorenzo said that although the fee increased, it was offset by
the fact that advertisers are being allowed double the usage.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Epp, a SAG vice president who was a key member of the
negotiating committee for the union during the commercial
negotiations in 2000, disagreed with DeLorenzo's contention that the
strike was solely responsible for the agency's demise. "The usage is
down, but that reflects the current state of the economy. There was a
25% downturn in revenue spending by advertisers in 2001."</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence also said the strike hurt business because advertisers
continued to produce commercials without union actors. Agencies
representing those actors couldn't authorize nonunion shoots. De
Lorenzo added that during the strike, advertisers increased their
dependence on nonunion actors.</TE>
<TE>   "Prior to the strike, nonunion production in the commercial world
was always an aspect of the business. That portion of the commercial
industry increased dramatically during the strike because it was the
only game in town," DeLorenzo said. "There was also a dramatic
increase in compensation to the nonunion actors. What the Screen
Actors Guild did not consider was that there was no law on the books
that said that in a non-strike environment, advertisers would not
continue to produce nonunion projects. It's now a learned and larger
part of the business."</TE>
<TE>   The current union contract with the advertising industry expires
in October 2003. Though talent agencies represent and negotiate
employment for actors, they do not vote on actors' union contracts.
When the actors voted to strike in 2000, it had a ripple effect on
their agencies, which also bore the economic brunt of the six-month
work stoppage.</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence said that the pending negotiations between the ad
industry and the Screen Actors Guild also influenced him to close
down the agency's commercial division. "My other thought in closing
the division is that I'm not going to rest my future on a contract in
which I have no input," Lawrence said.</TE>
<TE>   "All the residuals stopped after the strike and never came back. I
have been in the business 35 years, and this is a great tragedy. It's
heartbreaking. I've worked with these people for a long time, but at
some point you have to say, 'I'm running a business.' "</TE>
<TE>   DeLorenzo said he too was saddened by the economic reality of
having to shutter his agency. "I have literally put my whole life
into this business," he said. "I feel guilty because I have an
opportunity, and I feel bad for my actors because they are left in
this arena. The ones I feel particularly bad for are the ones who
voted not to strike. I've seen people lose their homes. I saw people
lose their jobs. I don't see this industry ever coming back. The
damage done by this strike is irreparable."</TE>

<HD>Kozlowski's Foundation Gave Little to Charity, Records Say</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>While former Tyco International Ltd. Chairman L. Dennis Kozlowski
allegedly committed more than $100 million of the conglomerate's
money to good causes, his own foundation gave little to charity, U.S.
tax records show.</LD>
<LD>   The Kozlowski Family Foundation made only one donation in 2000,
and that was for $3,000, according to the nonprofit's latest
available filing with the Internal Revenue Service.</LD>
<LD>   The foundation reported $534,473 in assets at the end of 2000.</LD>
<TE>   New York prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange Commission
last week accused Kozlowski and another former Tyco executive of
carrying out a massive theft and fraud scheme that allegedly netted
them more than $600 million since 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Kozlowski has pleaded not guilty to the charges.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco, which says Kozlowski had been among the highest-paid U.S.
CEOs during the last decade, also claimed in a lawsuit filed last
week that he improperly used company funds to promote himself as a
generous benefactor.</TE>
<TE>   From 1997 to 2002, Kozlowski made donations and pledges to
charities with more than $106 million of Tyco's money, according to
the Tyco lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   "At least $43 million of these donations were made for his
personal benefit or were represented as his personal donations," Tyco
alleged.</TE>
<TE>   In one instance, Kozlowski pledged $10 million of Tyco's money to
the California International Sailing Assn. in his name, the lawsuit
alleged. Other Tyco contributions were made in Kozlowski's name to
schools, colleges and hospitals that had a personal link with
Kozlowski.</TE>
<TE>   Shackleton Schools, a Boston-based nonprofit that received the
single 2000 donation from Kozlowski's family foundation, named his
daughter to its board.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco and Kozlowski contributed nearly $4 million in all to the
school, according to Luke O'Neill, the school's founder. O'Neill told
Reuters in June that Kozlowski personally contributed most of that
amount.</TE>
<TE>   Formed in mid-1998, Kozlowski's New Hampshire-based foundation
reported $10,168 in assets that year. No contributions were disclosed
that year.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation's only contribution in 1999 was for $265 to the
Tolstoy Foundation Inc., records show.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation's assets surged the following year after Kozlowski
contributed $500,000 in cash to the charitable trust, according to
disclosures to the IRS.</TE>

<HD>House Panel Expands List of Firms in IPO Probe</HD>
<DH>Investigation: A congressional committee asks CSFB and
Goldman Sachs for information on 13 more companies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Congressional investigators on Monday expanded the list of companies
for which they are seeking data in their probe of new stock
offerings.</LD>
<LD>   The House Financial Services Committee earlier this month asked
Credit Suisse First Boston and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. about their
business dealings with more than two dozen companies.</LD>
<LD>   The committee is looking into the brokerages' allocations of hot
initial public stock offerings to corporate executives during the
bull market.</LD>
<TE>   The committee initially asked CSFB for details on 15 companies,
and Goldman for information on 14 firms. On Monday, the committee
asked CSFB for information on five additional companies: DLJdirect,
Gadzoox Networks, MP3.com, Selectica and VA Linux Systems. It dropped
one company, Earthshell Corp., from its earlier request because CSFB
was not the lead underwriter of the company's IPO, a committee
spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   The committee asked Goldman Sachs for information on eight more
companies: Allegiance Telecom, Checkpoint Technologies, EBay, EToys,
Lucent Technologies, Starmedia Network, TheStreet.com and Yahoo Inc.
Investigators also asked Goldman for information on the brokerage's
own IPO in May 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The brokerages reiterated that they would cooperate with the
committee's probe.</TE>
<TE>   "We've told the committee we're happy to respond to their request,
and we're confident that our business practices will withstand the
toughest scrutiny," a Goldman spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're fully cooperating with the committee," a CSFB spokesman
said.</TE>

<TE>   SEC to Appoint Expert on</TE>
<TE>   Arbitrator Disclosures</TE>
<TE>   The Securities and Exchange Commission is expected today to
appoint an outside expert to study whether arbitrators working for
the New York Stock Exchange and National Assn. of Securities Dealers
should disclose additional information about themselves to investors.</TE>
<TE>   The expert would assess whether investors need the extra
disclosure to help them ferret out potential conflicts of interest
that can affect arbitrators' objectivity in disputes between
investors and brokerages.</TE>
<TE>   The selection of an outsider comes amid a battle between the NYSE
and NASD on one side and California legislators on the other.</TE>
<TE>   The NYSE and NASD in the summer said they would halt new
arbitration proceedings in California, citing a new state law
requiring the Judicial Council of California to write ethical
guidelines for arbitrators in most private-arbitration
cases--including those involving disputes over brokers' sales of
securities.</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Martha Escutia, the Whittier Democrat who sponsored the
legislation, said she hoped to promote confidence in private
arbitration, an increasingly common method of settling civil
disputes.</TE>
<TE>   But the NYSE and NASD contend the new standards are too
cumbersome. They maintain that their own disclosure guidelines for
arbitrators of securities disputes are sufficient and constitute a
national standard endorsed by the SEC. The NYSE and NASD have sued,
saying they should be exempted from the California law. A hearing on

<HD>Corporate Scandals Put Directors in the Hot Seat</HD>
<DH>Management: Turnover is accelerating as worried board
members call it quits and companies seek independent, better-trained
leaders.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA GIRION</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hours after former Tyco International Ltd. executives were charged
last week with stealing $170 million from the company, Tyco announced
it was shaking up its board of directors--an apparent acknowledgment
that confidence was waning in the group that the indictment described
as dupes.</LD>
<LD>   Of Tyco's 11 directors, only Chief Executive Edward Breen and
former DuPont Co. Chairman Jack Krol will be nominated for
reelection. The move allows Breen to work with a new board and sent a
signal to corporate America that directors can be held accountable
for failing to keep an eye on a company's managers.</LD>
<LD>   Although pressure is most intense on directors of companies
accused of fraud and corruption, experts say that even boardrooms
untouched by scandal can no longer afford to be cozy corporate clubs.
In hastily called meetings and conference calls with lawyers and
advisors, board members are struggling to understand and discharge
their responsibilities under the new corporate reform law, and some
of them are questioning whether they are up to the task.</LD>
<TE>   Boardroom turnover is accelerating as directors with pristine
reputations call it quits, fearful of the taint of a lurking scandal,
and those who lack the business acumen necessary to dig through the
books are being pushed aside. Half of the Fortune 500 boards are
looking for new members who have no ties to the company or its
officers, according to one headhunting firm. That's up from 20% a
year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Boards are steering away from management chums, corporate gurus
and former politicians with marquee value. Even efforts to achieve
racial and gender diversity are taking a back seat these days to the
pursuit of independence and expertise, according to recruiters and
corporate governance experts.</TE>
<TE>   To many, this unprecedented tumult at the top is a defining moment
for corporate boards--a period in which the management-friendly
fraternities of the past will yield to an independent corps of
well-trained, well-paid experts.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a long time coming," said Peter Gleason, chief
operating officer of the National Assn. of Corporate Directors, which
supports the movement toward board independence and expertise. "These
are things that have been espoused by institutional investors and
corporate governance experts for years, and now we're in a period
where crisis has hit and somehow we have to restore confidence in
corporate America."</TE>
<TE>   Others view the new era more darkly, as a period in which
corporate boards may lose veteran members with a wealth of experience
and talent. One lawyer who advises and defends directors said one of
his clients is rethinking his membership on three Fortune 500 boards.</TE>
<TE>   "He's had a stellar career and he said to me, 'Hey, should I be
sitting on these boards?' " said J. Michael Nolan, a New Jersey
lawyer. " 'Is it worth my reputation being tarnished?' "</TE>
<TE>   Many boards are engineering their own transformations. Directors
are taking the lead in identifying and recruiting nominees, a process
that had been dominated by CEOs, and their priorities have changed.</TE>
<TE>   "Search committees are no longer saying, 'We need a woman,' " said
Steve Mader, president of Christian &amp; Timbers, a Cleveland-based
executive recruiting firm. "They are saying, 'We need the best person
we can find with deep experience in a functional area.' "</TE>
<TE>   One-third of 5,000 publicly traded companies surveyed by the
corporate directors association in 2001 had boards dominated by
insiders--members of management and people with personal and business
relationships with the firms. Many of them have begun recruiting
outsiders in anticipation of the Securities and Exchange Commission's
adoption of a rule proposed by the New York Stock Exchange that would
require boards of publicly traded companies to be dominated by
independent directors within two years.</TE>
<TE>   Pending rules aside, boards also are motivated by a desire to send
investors a positive message that effective management oversight is a
priority, corporate governance experts said.</TE>
<TE>   Shareholders are pushing for board accountability and a bigger say
in directors' selection. Institutional investors and shareholder
advocates are papering companies with proposals for governance
reforms for consideration at annual meetings next spring. By itself,
the AFL-CIO, which wields the clout of $400 billion in pension funds
invested in a wide array of companies, is launching shareholder
proposals at 300 of them.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to see far more intensity than we've ever seen
before, given the performance of the market and collapses, ranging
from Enron to WorldCom," said Bill Patterson, director of the labor
federation's office of investment. "Shareholders have seen the damage
that having a go-along board can have."</TE>
<TE>   Members of reconstituted boards and directors who have left
scandal-plagued companies but remain on other boards are expected to
face scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   "Shareholders are starting to see the board as individuals, not
just as a faceless lump," Patterson said. "Shareholders will be
looking to individual board members to account for what they've been
doing."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, minority groups are keeping the pressure on
corporate boards to fill vacancies with individuals who reflect the
demographics of the nation's shareholders, employees and consumers.
Of 12,000 Fortune 1,000 board members, for instance, 120 are
"American Latinos," according to the New American Alliance.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a chummy club until now," said Moctesuma Esparza, a
Hollywood producer who chairs the nonprofit advocacy organization.
"The board culture was extremely insular. People got selected on the
basis of personal and business relationships and the friends of the
CEO. The American public is really not represented on boards of
directors."</TE>
<TE>   Also under attack is the practice of directors hopscotching among
boards. Directors spend an average of 200 hours a year per board
preparing for and attending meetings, according to the directors
association. As new oversight duties increase the amount of time they
must commit to each board, it is widely believed it will become more
difficult for them to serve so many.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of directors ... sit on five, six boards and make quite a
bit of money doing that," said Judy Fischer, managing director of
Executive Compensation Advisory Services of Alexandria, Va. "However,
the question is, are they providing adequate professional advice that
is protecting shareholder value?"</TE>
<TE>   If directors serve on fewer boards, more individuals will be
needed. Fischer and others said they expect that to put pressure on
firms to boost their pay.</TE>
<TE>   Gleason, of the directors association, agreed, saying one way to
increase pay would be to shift compensation packages away from the
current model, in which retainers of $10,000 to $50,000 dwarf meeting
fees. Increasing meeting fees, he said, would improve the pay of the
directors who work the most, such as members of audit and other busy
committees.</TE>
<TE>   But, he said, until the current popular backlash against
corporations subsides, directors would do well to refrain from
passing out any raises.</TE>

<HD>Long-Term Bond Yields Continue Slide</HD>
<DH>Investing: The 10-year T-note sinks as low as 3.87%. The
30-year T-bond drops to 4.76%.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Long-term Treasury bond yields fell by midday Monday to the lowest
levels in about four decades, continuing to defy expectations that a
bottom has been reached in this year's rate slide.</LD>
<LD>   But the ongoing decline is posing a quandary for bond fund
managers: If they continue to buy Treasuries at these yields, they
risk severe whiplash if market interest rates resurge.</LD>
<LD>   The yield on the benchmark 10-year T-note sank by midday Monday to
as low as 3.87% before rebounding to close at 3.91%, matching
Friday's level.</LD>
<TE>   The yield on the 30-year T-bond hit a new closing low at 4.76%,
down from 4.77% on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Investors who balked at buying long-term Treasuries in midsummer
because of low yields now may wish they had jumped in: The 10-year
T-note was 4.46% at the end of July, more than half a point higher
than today.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been doing this since 1979, and, like a lot of people, I've
got sticker shock right now," said Richard Schlanger, portfolio
manager at Pioneer Investments in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   The plunge in yields has made older fixed-rate Treasury bonds more
valuable, pushing their prices higher. That has driven the "total
return" on some government-bond mutual funds into double digits year
to date. Total return counts interest earnings plus any change in
principal value.</TE>
<TE>   Some bond market pros say they don't think rates can fall much
further, barring a new recession. And if the economy rebounds,
experts concede that the next turn for rates probably will be up,
driving bond principal values lower.</TE>
<TE>   But that isn't stopping investors from continuing to shovel cash
into bond funds.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Biderman, president of TrimTabs.com Investment Research in
Santa Rosa, Calif., estimates that a net $15 billion poured into bond
funds in August, with inflows continuing at that pace or better in
September.</TE>
<TE>   Stock funds, meanwhile, might be on their way to a fourth straight
month of net outflows, according to TrimTabs.</TE>
<TE>   "Flows follow performance and [bonds are] really the only asset
class that's making any money," Biderman said.</TE>
<TE>   "Typically, this is what happens at the top," he warned, noting
that stock fund inflows reached a crescendo in spring 2000, just
before the 2 1/2-year downturn for stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Biderman said the bond rally could continue for several months,
but investors banking on such stellar Treasury returns forever will
inevitably be disappointed, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the rearview mirror style of investing: You have your foot
on the gas, your hands on the wheel and your eyes on the rearview
mirror.... At some point you crash," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Schlanger said individual investors continue to reallocate
assets into fixed income in part because they feel "burned" by
equities.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people who have seen their 401(k)s cut dramatically want
to preserve what they have left," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, retirees who rely on income-producing investments and
who want to raise that income have little choice but to buy
longer-term bonds, with returns on money market funds at record lows
of about 1.3%, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Though recent bond fund cash inflows may look like "hot money,"
Treasury fund managers say fundamental factors continue to underpin
the rally in long-term bonds.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been surprised by the magnitude of this rally, but if you
peel back the layers of the onion, this thing could have further
longevity," Schlanger said. He said 10-year rates could fall to 3.5%
over the next two quarters.</TE>
<TE>   Among other factors, Schlanger said the "yield curve," or the gap
between long-and short-term rates, remains steep by historical
standards; 30-year Treasury debt is no longer being issued; and
mortgage giant Fannie Mae may have to buy 10-year T-notes to bolster
its assets because the home-refinancing wave has chipped away at its
mortgage portfolio.</TE>
<TE>   Also, a war with Iraq could spur a new "flight to quality" that
benefits Treasuries, Schlanger said.</TE>
<TE>   Others say the continuing Treasury rally could be a signal that
investors expect either a return to recession or another cut in
short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve aimed at staving off
a so-called double dip.</TE>
<TE>   Ashok Bhatia, portfolio manager at Strong Funds in Menomonee
Falls, Wis., said although the "fundamental themes" for a solid
Treasury market are still in place, the plunge in yields since June
could be setting the stage for a correction that sends rates
temporarily higher.</TE>
<TE>   "In the short term you have to be cautious," he said. "But do we
have a 'bond bubble'? I don't think so."</TE>
<TE>   Fund managers and investors can take steps to minimize the risk of
rate whiplash, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Bhatia is keeping his portfolios very close to their benchmark
average "duration"--a measure of bond maturity--of four years, he
said. By contrast, earlier in the year the average had crept up to
4.25 years as he anticipated a decline in rates. A shorter duration
could limit a fund's principal losses if market rates rise.</TE>
<TE>   Bhatia also is buying more mortgage and U.S. agency securities
that could perform relatively well even if rates rise, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Don Cassidy, analyst at fund tracker Lipper Inc. in Denver, said
investors fearful of rate whiplash might want to consider funds that
own so-called TIPS, or Treasury inflation-protected securities. TIPS
are an insurance policy against inflation, offering guaranteed
returns above the consumer price index.</TE>
<TE>   As for most long-term bond funds, however, Cassidy said portfolio
managers don't have much leeway to protect against rebounding rates.
"If you're a long-term fund, you're a long-term fund."</TE>

<HD>Some on AOL Board Said to Oppose Case</HD>
<DH>Media: Firm's chairman, architect of the merger with Time
Warner, is fighting the ouster move, sources say. He may have votes
to save job.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A movement to oust Steve Case as chairman of AOL Time Warner Inc. is
gaining momentum among board members and large shareholders of the
media conglomerate, according to sources close to the situation.</LD>
<LD>   Within the last month, Case was asked to resign by one of the
company's largest shareholders, but he vowed to fight any effort to
remove him, the sources said.</LD>
<LD>   They said several AOL Time Warner board members, including Vice
Chairman Ted Turner, have joined the campaign to push out Case.</LD>
<TE>   The pressure on the company and Case in particular has mounted
since the company was targeted this summer by the Justice Department.</TE>
<TE>   Federal regulators are investigating accounting irregularities at
America Online, the Internet service provider where Case served as
chairman before orchestrating the merger in January 2001 with Time
Warner.</TE>
<TE>   Any campaign to unseat Case could be difficult because of the
bylaws of the new company. Case cannot be removed as chairman without
the approval of three-fourths of the company's 14-member board.</TE>
<TE>   Sources close to the situation said Case probably would prevail in
any vote because he has the support of several former AOL directors
who joined the board of the new company after the merger.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no basis to the rumors," said AOL Time Warner spokesman
Ed Adler. "He's staying at the company."</TE>
<TE>   Yet many large investors blame Case for the steep decline in their
holdings over the last year.</TE>
<TE>   Turner, for instance, has watched his stake in the company plunge
in value to about $1 billion from about $8 billion when the merger
was announced.</TE>
<TE>   Other large shareholders lobbying against Case include Liberty
Media Corp., the media portfolio controlled by John Malone, and
Capital Research Group, a leading institutional shareholder that had
supported the merger initially.</TE>
<TE>   Together, Capital Research, Turner and Malone own 15% of AOL Time
Warner stock.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts question whether Case serves any meaningful role at
the company. Case leaves day-to-day operations to Chief Executive
Richard Parsons, who succeeded Gerald Levin in May.</TE>
<TE>   Case has characterized his role as mainly strategic. Yet
institutional shareholders see Case as the architect, along with
Levin, of one of the worst mergers in media history.</TE>
<TE>   They also say Case cultivated a cowboy-like culture at AOL that
gave rise to the practices that are now under investigation by
federal regulators.</TE>
<TE>   Many top America Online executives have already left the company,
leaving Case a shallow base of support within the management ranks.</TE>
<TE>   Many top executives from the Time Warner camp, whose options are
under water, have channeled their resentment toward Case.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner shares, which have fallen 70% since the merger,
closed Monday down 22 cents at $12.67 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Grand Jury Probing Enron Role in Crisis</HD>
<DH>Energy: The U.S. attorney's office wants to know whether
the firm cheated California.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL and NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal grand jury has been convened in San Francisco to
investigate whether Enron Corp. and other electricity sellers
manipulated prices during the state's energy crisis, causing
blackouts and huge electricity debts for the state and its biggest
power utilities.</LD>
<LD>   The new grand jury represents a widening of the Justice
Department's probes into Enron and the costly California electricity
debacle of 2000 and 2001. It joins a Houston grand jury probe into
Enron's financial collapse, as well as other state and federal
investigations into the causes behind price spikes and energy
shortages that plagued California for a year.</LD>
<LD>   "We have been informed by our contacts with the U.S. attorney's
office that there is a grand jury underway with respect to Enron,"
state Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana) said Monday. Dunn heads a committee
that has been investigating alleged manipulation of California's
energy market.</LD>
<TE>   "In none of those conversations have they been specific about what
with regards to Enron they're looking at," Dunn said. But, he added,
it is clear that the U.S. attorney's office is looking at Enron's
behavior in the California electricity market, as opposed to the
company's accounting techniques, which are under investigation by the
Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   "It's my understanding that they're looking at all of Enron's
behavior in the California market, including congestion management
issues," Dunn said.</TE>
<TE>   Houston-based Enron used trading strategies with names such as
Death Star and Fat Boy to create the appearance of congestion on the
state's electricity grid. The profitable ploys were quickly adopted
by other traders, according to a Dec. 6, 2000, internal Enron memo
that created a furor when it was released in May by federal
regulators.</TE>
<TE>   Energy experts and politicians have hotly debated whether these
trading strategies were illegal or merely clever ways to exploit
loopholes in California's market rules to extract congestion-relief
payments from the state grid operator.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, some experts have assigned a darker role to the
so-called congestion games. They assert that by creating power jams
on transmission lines, or even the appearance of congestion, Enron
and others may have been purposefully trying to reduce supplies to
increase electricity prices without having to shut down any power
plants.</TE>
<TE>   The existence of the federal grand jury was first reported in
Fortune magazine's Sept. 2 issue. The Wall Street Journal reported
additional details Monday, saying investigators hoped to determine
whether former Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling and former
President Greg Whalley were aware of the trading schemes.</TE>
<TE>   Skilling and Whalley could not be reached for comment. Justice
Department spokesman Bryan Sierra declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The grand jury may be in the early stages of its investigation.
Many industry participants who could expect to receive subpoenas have
still not been contacted by the U.S. attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   But the California Independent System Operator, or Cal-ISO, which
runs the power grid and a market for electricity, did receive a
subpoena last month from the U.S. attorney's office in Sacramento
seeking documents related to congestion payments in the California
market between Dec. 1, 2000, and March 1, 2001--some of the darkest
days of the state's crisis.</TE>
<TE>   The subpoena also sought trading records from May 25, 1999, the
day that Enron first tested a congestion game by scheduling 2,800
megawatts of power on a transmission line that could accommodate only
15 megawatts. Power prices rose $15 per megawatt-hour because of the
scheme, and Enron was fined by Cal-ISO for the ploy.</TE>
<TE>   Federal investigators "are looking at what Enron knew and when
they knew it with respect to manipulation of the California market,"
said state Sen. Steve Peace (D-El Cajon), whose staff has been asked
by the investigators to help them understand the players and
terminology. "They have interviewed scores of people who are
knowledgeable and involved in the process and have leads to provide
the investigators."</TE>
<TE>   "I think [the Justice Department] ultimately will be able to
demonstrate that Enron, as a conscious business practice, began to
manipulate the California market in 1999," Peace said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Enron "misdiagnosed the market by expecting price
volatility, which did not happen because of unexpectedly mild weather
plus the Cal-ISO's re-imposition of price caps," he said. "As a
result, they lost their shirt and that put even more pressure on them
to manipulate the market in 2000 and 2001."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer David Streitfeld contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Global Crossing Files Plan to Restructure</HD>
<DH>Telecom: The firm says it could emerge from bankruptcy in
January and see a profit in 2003. Some executives may be shielded
from liability.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Global Crossing Ltd. filed a reorganization plan Monday that predicts
that the telecommunications firm could emerge from bankruptcy in
January and rebound to post a profit in 2003.</LD>
<LD>   The company's projections, although speculative, are included in
the reorganization plan's companion disclosure statement, a detailed
document that outlines the past and present as well as future
prospects for the firm, litigation and other contingencies.</LD>
<LD>   Global Crossing's disclosure statement also suggests that Chief
Executive John Legere, Chief Financial Officer Dan Cohrs, Executive
Vice President of Finance Joe Perrone and other company executives
would be protected from personal liability as part of the
reorganization plan. That protection would not include former
officers such as Gary Winnick, a founder of the company and its
longtime chairman.</LD>
<TE>   Protection from liability could be a significant factor because
Global Crossing is the subject of accounting and disclosure
investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S.
attorney's office in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The Labor Department is looking into the company's employee stock
policies. And Global Crossing has been served with subpoenas from New
York state Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer and two congressional panels
investigating the relationships among securities firms, analysts and
their banking clients.</TE>
<TE>   Bermuda-based Global Crossing also faces nearly 50 class-action
lawsuits alleging securities law violations and an estimated 15
class-action lawsuits concerning federal retirement plan protections.</TE>
<TE>   Winnick is considered a key target of many of the investigations
because he has been the firm's driving force since its founding in
1997 and because he sold shares worth hundreds of millions of dollars
before the stock collapsed. Its stock is trading at 2 cents, down
from a 1999 high of $64.25.</TE>
<TE>   Winnick is set to testify next week before the House Energy and
Commerce Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing plans to sell a majority stake in the firm to
Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. of Hong Kong and Singapore Technologies
Telemedia to fund its revival. Under an agreement reached in August,
the two Asian companies would pay $250 million for a 61.5% share of
post-bankruptcy Global Crossing.</TE>
<TE>   Under the reorganization plan, the firm's banks would get $300
million in cash, plus $175 million in new debt securities and a 6%
stake in the resurrected company. Other creditors would get $25
million in new debt and 32.5% ownership in the new Global Crossing.</TE>
<TE>   Holders of common and preferred shares would get nothing.</TE>
<TE>   The deal values Global Crossing at about $407 million, a pittance
considering that the company spent billions to build a fiber-optic
network connecting more than 200 cities in 27 countries.</TE>
<TE>   The plan will be presented Oct. 21 to U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert
Gerber for approval.</TE>
<TE>   Ivan Kallich, head of the bankruptcy group at Manatt Phelps &amp;
Phillips in Los Angeles, said the filing of a company's
reorganization plan is "a pretty significant benchmark in the case,
because it will begin the process of negotiating how the company will
dispose of assets and how much it will pay its creditors."</TE>
<TE>   In cases such as Global Crossing's, there also may be skirmishes
over payments made by the company in the year leading up to its
bankruptcy filing.</TE>
<TE>   Under bankruptcy law, creditors can challenge payments to insiders
as well as to creditors in some cases.</TE>
<TE>   "Outrageous bonuses and those kinds of things will most likely
come back" to creditors, Kallich said. "Theses things need to pass
the smell test.... If something seems out of the ordinary, they're
going to go after that."</TE>
<TE>   Kallich also said it's not unusual for reorganization plans to
include provisions to protect current officers from litigation. "One
tries to do it, but it's usually very difficult to fully insulate all
of these folks."</TE>
<TE>   In today's environment, litigation is almost guaranteed, Kallich
said.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been so much out-and-out greed, you've got the
plaintiffs' bar gunning for the former officers and directors of
these companies," Kallich said.</TE>
<TE>   "Since Winnick is still extremely well off, he's a prime target,
and I don't think the creditors will approve a plan with a protective
provision for him."</TE>
<TE>   In an unaudited projected statement of operations, Global Crossing
said it expects to post a net profit of $174 million and book total
revenue of $3 billion in service and network capacity sales for 2003.
The company projects rising revenue and profit in subsequent years.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing filed for bankruptcy protection Jan. 28. The
company listed $12.4 billion in total debt and assets of $22.4
billion--a figure that had shrunk to $18.4 billion by July 31 and
probably will fall to $1.7 billion when the company finishes writing
off assets and emerges from bankruptcy.</TE>

<HD>Goldman-Led Group to Buy National Golf</HD>
<DH>Deals: The investors would acquire the company and its
affiliate for $1.1 billion, leaving founder David Price with a small
stake in ownership.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An investment group headed by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said Monday
that it had agreed to acquire Santa Monica-based National Golf
Properties Inc. and its sister company, American Golf Corp., in a
$1.1-billion deal that would leave founder and golf course industry
pioneer David G. Price with a minor ownership stake and management
role.</LD>
<LD>   The buyers, which also include affiliates of Starwood Capital,
would supply much needed cash to pay off substantial debts and
stabilize one of the nation's largest golf course operations after
about a year of mounting financial pressures and charges of conflicts
of interest aimed at Price. American Golf is a privately run company
that leases and operates most of the 116 courses owned by National
Golf, a publicly traded real estate investment trust.</LD>
<LD>   "Given our history of investing in and building golf and
leisure-related businesses, this acquisition is a compelling
opportunity," said Merrick Kleeman, senior managing director of
Starwood Capital, in a statement. "The company has assembled an
unparalleled collection of assets and a talented and dedicated team
that we believe is well-positioned to lead this industry into the
future."</LD>
<TE>   Under the deal, the Goldman Sachs group would pay $12 in cash for
each share of National Golf common stock for about $246 million and
would assume debt and other obligations of both companies worth about
$850 million. The owners of American Golf, which is majority-owned by
Price and his family, would receive $10,000 in cash, a 2% stake in
National Golf and the option to purchase 2% of American Golf.</TE>
<TE>   Though National Golf approved a controversial merger with American
Golf this year, the Goldman Sachs group would purchase the companies
separately to minimize taxes, said people familiar with the deal. The
sale is scheduled to be completed early next year if it receives
shareholder and regulatory approval.</TE>
<TE>   The transaction was welcome on Wall Street, where National Golf
shares rose 99 cents to $11.69 on the New York Stock Exchange.
They've been as low as $4.30 and as high as $19.35 in the last 52
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The deal that was approved is much less generous to Price and his
family. A previous agreement would have given Price and his family up
to a 10% stake in the combined companies and allowed Price to remain
chairman with a five-year employment contract. Under the current
proposal, Price would serve in the mostly honorary role as chairman
emeritus.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an exciting and important next step in the evolution of
the companies," Price said in a statement. "I'm thrilled about all we
have accomplished and look forward to many great opportunities
ahead."</TE>
<TE>   A former attorney, Price founded American Golf in the early 1970s
and grew rich by turning money-losing private and public courses into
efficient and profitable ventures by applying corporate-style
operating methods and standards. American Golf operates more than 300
properties, including the prestigious Mountain Gate Golf and Tennis
Club in Los Angeles and five public courses owned by the city of Long
Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Price, who is not a golfer, cashed in on the demand for real
estate stocks in 1993 by forming National Golf, a real estate
investment trust that focused on golfing properties. National Golf
owns the properties but handed management duties to American Golf
under long-term leases and contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Both companies came under severe financial pressure last year
resulting from a slowing economy, the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and
a glut of new courses. Last year, American Golf announced that it
would halt lease payments to National Golf and that its deteriorating
financial health had put it in technical default on some of its
loans. As a result, National Golf also was in technical default on
its loans and was forced to cut its dividend.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts to salvage the business were complicated by Price's
control and ownership of both companies. Some shareholders and
industry observers said that Price and his family stood to avoid most
of the financial fallout at the expense of public stockholders.
Shareholder lawsuits claimed that Price misappropriated National Golf
funds through a "scheme of complicated financial dealings" that
involved entities controlled by the executive. The company denied the
allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Paul, an independent board member of National Golf who
oversaw the sale of the company, said one of the biggest challenges
was assuring shareholders that Price had no undue influence. The goal
"was to get control of the process and make sure it was independent,"
he said.</TE>

<HD>In the Gaza Strip, Terror Can Create a Language All Its Own</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GHADA AGEEL</AU>
<BD>Ghada Ageel, a doctoral student at Exeter University in
Britain, lives in Zahra in the Gaza Strip.</BD>
<DL>ZAHRA, Gaza Strip</DL>
<LD>There is a very thin line between life and death in Gaza. No matter
who you are, where you are or how old you are, the Israeli bullets
and shrapnel always seem to be waiting.</LD>
<LD>   Two weeks ago, my family was returning home by car when an Israeli
tank opened fire toward us. We could discern no reason for the sudden
perilous outburst.</LD>
<LD>   It was about 8:30 at night and dark. The car in front of us began
to travel in reverse erratically and almost smashed into our vehicle.
There was no choice but for us to reverse also to escape death by
"accident." The bullets were loud and continuous.</LD>
<TE>   Instantly, I ordered Ghaida, my 6-year-old daughter, to lie on the
floor of the car. I did the same with Tariq, my 2-year-old son.</TE>
<TE>   When Ghaida understood what was going on, she started to shout
hysterically: "The tank, the tank is firing at us, Mommy."
Simultaneously, I was beseeching her not to raise her head.</TE>
<TE>   And then my son broke my heart. He had had only seven words in his
vocabulary, and yet there he was suddenly articulating dababa, which
means tank in Arabic. He did not move despite the shooting, the
darkness and the terror that gripped us.</TE>
<TE>   Nasser, my husband, who less than two years ago joined the
baseball team of the American organization for which he worked,
directed that if he was hit I should continue driving in order to
save the children's lives. After an eternity of fearful moments we
reached safety at El Sheikh Ejleen mosque.</TE>
<TE>   The following night was no less horrible. Around 11:30 we heard
shelling, heavy gunfire and very big explosions. Then the electricity
went off, and again there were more explosions. It was now totally
dark.</TE>
<TE>   We and our neighbors were jailed inside our apartments--cages in
the middle of a medium-size prison called Zahra, a town within the
larger prison of the Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   When the shootings stopped, we went to sleep without realizing
that a brutal killing had taken place. Artillery shells spitting
nail-like "flechettes"--courtesy of the United States, according to
Jane's Defence Weekly--killed four members of the Al Hajeen family. A
woman, her two sons and a cousin sleeping in front of their house in
the middle of their fields were slain when an Israeli tank launched
its death shell at them. Two hours passed before the ambulance
reached them.</TE>
<TE>   This was not the first time such a slaughter has happened in this
place and to people who seemingly matter little in the eyes of the
world. I fear they will not be the last.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, three Bedouin women from the Al Malalha family were
killed in the same place and by the same American-made flechettes.
The victims were a mother, her recently married 17-year-old daughter
and another relative.</TE>
<TE>   Another neighbor, nurse Abd al Hameed al Khurti, was shot in the
same place last year. He was killed immediately after being dropped
off by an ambulance.</TE>
<TE>   Time and again, the Israeli government admits a mistake and
launches an "investigation." Most recently, an Israeli investigation
of three incidents in which 12 civilians were killed whitewashed the
reality of the onslaught in my neighborhood and two in the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   The investigations will not bring back the dead from the Al
Khurti, Al Malalha and Al Hajeen families, but a sincere inquest
might help to protect innocent civilians in the future. And yet
investigations do not get to the heart of the matter. Israel is a
colonizing power. It continues to occupy what should be an
independent Palestinian state, and it refuses to make any allowance
for the rightful return of my family to the home and land we were
thrown out of 54 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Israel has us pinned in an ever-smaller prison, one in
which we shout instructions to our children to keep their heads down
so as not to become another "accident" for the Knesset to report to
its funders in the U.S. Congress.</TE>
<TE>   I ask you, to whom can I turn? The United Nations' resolutions
regarding Israeli actions are on the books but carry no weight.
George Bush is too busy applying U.N. resolutions to Iraq to pay our
plight much mind.</TE>
<TE>   I ask you, then, on behalf of my son, so that his ninth word might
be "peace." But I do not speak of the "peace" of a conquering and
occupying Israeli army. I seek a peace rooted in fairness and justice
for all the peoples of the region.</TE>

<HD>War Issue Imperils Constitution</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOYCE APPLEBY and ELLEN CAROL DuBOIS</AU>
<BD>Joyce Appleby and Ellen Carol DuBois, history
professors at UCLA, have circulated the American Historians'
Petition, now with more than 1,200 signatures, urging Congress to
assume its constitutional responsibility to vote on whether to
declare war on Iraq.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The constitutional issue raised by the possibility of invading Iraq
without congressional approval has not been put to rest, although the
crisis may be forestalled by Iraq's agreement Monday to readmit U.N.
arms inspectors.</LD>
<LD>   The question remains: Is it possible to amend the Constitution
through an act of collective forgetfulness?</LD>
<LD>   An attack on Iraq has been bruited about ever since President Bush
invoked an "axis of evil" in his State of the Union address to
Congress in January.</LD>
<TE>   With plenty of time to request a formal declaration of war,
failure to do so could only contribute to the impression that the
Constitution is an archaic document, hardly a comforting thought for
those who care about this country's institutions.</TE>
<TE>   Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution is explicit in giving
Congress, not the president, the power to declare war. There's no
ambiguity here concerning the original intent. To complicate matters,
Bush has announced that he would consult with Congress, as though it
were his choice, not a constitutional imperative.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking to voters in Indiana and Kentucky after Labor Day, the
president further confused the situation by saying he did not expect
a congressional debate to change his position. And more recently, he
indicated his impatience with any prolonged congressional
deliberations. Yet it is exactly this function of hearing from
experts, canvassing opinions and expressing constituents' concerns
that distinguishes Congress from the presidency.</TE>
<TE>   Mindful of the way the president had usurped Congress during the
Vietnam War, Congress passed the War Powers Act of 1973, which
enabled the president to respond militarily to an attack but required
congressional approval within 60 days of such a response.</TE>
<TE>   Still, presidents have found ways of brushing off even this fig
leaf honoring the Constitution. President Clinton, for instance,
ignored efforts to get him to comply during the bombing of Kosovo.</TE>
<TE>   The founding fathers left the declaring of war to Congress so that
the representatives of those who would bear the brunt of war would
make the awful choice of resorting to violence.</TE>
<TE>   The founders also sought a balance to avoid a dangerous
concentration of power in the presidency.</TE>
<TE>   Failure to respect the Constitution by going to war on the
president's say-so, without provocation, would rob American military
action of all legitimacy.</TE>
<TE>   The trauma of the Sept. 11 attacks may have numbed the public to
how unprecedented a preemptive attack from the United States would
be. It would violate every principle this country has stood for.</TE>
<TE>   But after a drought of public discourse, who realizes this?
Historians do. They cultivate the memory of their nation's principles
and practices.</TE>
<TE>   In this spirit, we have turned to an old tradition, that of
citizens petitioning Congress for redress of grievances, to urge
Congress to exert its constitutional authority.</TE>
<TE>   We are not so foolish as to think we can stop a juggernaut or put
starch into a wilted Congress. We do think that, by petitioning
Congress, we might start a collective effort to rejuvenate civic
culture.</TE>
<TE>   Only a full debate and vote can help Americans understand the
costs of a preemptive attack, the risks of war and its likely impact
on the world.</TE>
<TE>   A congressional resolution of support for the president could be
merely a vaguely worded assertion on the dangers of Saddam Hussein.
Only by voting for or against declaring war can Congress assume the
awesome responsibility the Constitution gives it.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. now finds itself at a crossroads. Either it will return
to the balance of powers the founding fathers created to protect
constitutional government or it will keep alive the baleful legacy of
the Cold War with its imperial presidency, suppression of dissent and
a for-or-against-us mentality.</TE>

<HD>Hahn: What We Need in a New Chief</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES K. HAHN</AU>
<BD>James K. Hahn is mayor of Los Angeles.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Police Department is at a crossroads as we prepare to
select a new chief of police. Our proud department has faced many
challenges, but we are beginning to see positive changes at Parker
Center. Officers are not leaving the department as they once did,
morale continues to rise, new recruits and officers who left the LAPD
for other law enforcement agencies are seeking to rejoin the LAPD's
ranks, and a renewed confidence in the department is again visible in
the neighborhoods of Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The next police chief must continue this progress. My expectations
for the new chief are very clear: reduce crime, improve morale and
recruitment, implement the reforms mandated by the consent decree,
expand community policing and embrace the role of civilian oversight.
The LAPD must get back to the business of policing. Fighting crime
must be "job one."</LD>
<LD>   Among the new chief's top priorities must be to return the LAPD to
its fully authorized level of 10,000 officers. Additionally, he or
she must commit to getting the LAPD's highly trained officers, many
of whom are sitting behind desks at headquarters, back out on
neighborhood streets. The new chief must change the LAPD from a
top-heavy command-and-control department into a proactive,
community-based organization.</LD>
<TE>   We must create a Police Department that does not give lip service
to reform. The new chief must lead the effort to build a Police
Department that not only protects but also respects every community.
It must be a department led by a Police Commission that understands
its role as an overseer and works in partnership with a chief who
respects civilian oversight.</TE>
<TE>   The police union must also join with the new chief to shatter the
police culture that has blocked reform. The chief must convince every
officer to join in the task of reform. I will make it clear to each
candidate that there can be no more Ramparts, no more code of silence
and no more scandals.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD must also more closely reflect the city's diversity. Our
residents deserve a police force that identifies with different
cultures and is trained through life experiences to understand the
needs of a diverse population. The new chief must rise to the
challenge by recruiting and promoting more women and minorities.</TE>
<TE>   The chief must be able to inspire the LAPD's rank and file and
rebuild the morale that has been so damaged, advancing the changes we
have made to boost morale. Shortly, the Police Commission will submit
the three best candidates for my consideration. My commitment to the
residents of Los Angeles is that I will select the candidate who best
embodies the qualities and qualifications needed to make Los Angeles
the safest big city in the nation.</TE>

<HD>The Judiciary Committee as Political Killer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DOUGLAS W. KMIEC</AU>
<BD>Douglas W. Kmiec is dean of the Catholic University
School of Law and a senior policy fellow at Pepperdine University.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While the nation has been properly focused on the war on terrorism,
the Senate Judiciary Committee has continued its all-out offensive
against President Bush's judicial nominees. The tactical strategy of
the Democratic committee majority, led by Sen. Patrick J. Leahy
(D-Vt.), is multi-headed, ranging from not giving the president's
candidates a hearing at all to waiting a year or more to do so, or,
in its most aggressive form, to rejecting nominees by
committee--literally, substituting the 10-member Democratic committee
majority for the deliberations of the full Senate.</LD>
<LD>   This week, the nomination of Michael McConnell, one of the
nation's most capable constitutional scholars, will be before the
committee. The professor has had a distinguished career, representing
the United States in the solicitor general's office, serving in the
executive branch and teaching at the University of Chicago and the
University of Utah.</LD>
<LD>   It is not an overstatement to say that McConnell's arguments
before the U.S. Supreme Court have reestablished the principle that
discrimination against citizens on the basis of religion should have
no resonance in either constitutional law or practice.</LD>
<TE>   Had the system been working as the framers envisaged, McConnell
would have been approved by unanimous consent months ago. More than
300 law deans and professors across the ideological spectrum have
written in his behalf, characterizing his work as, for example, the
product of "care, thoroughness and fairness to opposing viewpoints."
Yet, despite his scholarly record and ideal judicial temperament,
McConnell's nomination has been languishing for more than a year.</TE>
<TE>   Now with the hearing imminent, McConnell's nomination is being
targeted for defeat by the usual single-issue pressure groups.</TE>
<TE>   McConnell's thoughtful academic commentary is being ripped from
context and reduced to mean and virtually meaningless caricature.
Such well-funded political campaigns are the regrettable, but
inevitable, corollary of the Senate distorting its constitutional
duty into one of political compatibility rather than professional
capability.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate's role in advice and consent is to discern integrity
and competence, not to condition appointment upon a judge changing
his judicial philosophy to one that coincides with the dominant
perspectives on the committee. Both political parties have forgotten
this precept over time. Consequently, there is now a wholesale
disregard of the relationship between an independent judiciary and
the rule of law.</TE>
<TE>   Fueling this disregard is the Judiciary Committee's more recent
usurpation of the advice-and-consent authority that by rights belongs
to the full Senate. The founders intended the whole body to act to
get the benefit of representation and deliberation. This has been our
historical practice with very few exceptions. No Supreme Court
nominee has ever been formally rejected in the Judiciary Committee
alone, and all but four federal appellate nominees have been brought
to the Senate floor as well.</TE>
<TE>   More than 10% of the seats on the federal bench are vacant. The
Administrative Office of U.S. Courts has categorized 32 of these
vacancies as emergencies because of the backlog they are causing to
case dockets. The American Bar Assn. has decried the protracted
delays. Political litmus tests have no place before the Senate
Judiciary Committee. Under our Constitution, it is expected that the
president nominates judges. The Senate's power of advice and consent
is not about undoing those choices.</TE>
<TE>   Rather, as Alexander Hamilton explained in the Federalist Papers,
"the necessity of [the whole Senate's] concurrence would have a
powerful, though, in general a silent operation." Since the president
would know that his choices could be rejected, it "would tend greatly
to prevent the appointment of unfit characters."</TE>
<TE>   There is nothing unfit about McConnell. Unless soon righted,
however, the fitness of the confirmation process remains very much in
doubt.</TE>

<LD>Governments will go to amazing lengths to keep public information
away from the public. California's Freedom of Information Act is
routinely ignored, in part because there's no penalty for refusing to
release data. One study showed that 80% of the requests to local
governments were denied when first made.</LD>
<LD>   Around the country, legislatures are imposing more secrecy in the
name of security. Fortunately that has not happened in California.
But the state repeatedly has failed to put teeth into the California
Public Records Act. The only recourse when information is denied is
to sue, a long and costly process.</LD>
<LD>   Senate leader John Burton (D-San Francisco) sponsored a sorely
needed constitutional amendment to give the people a fundamental
right of access to government information. SCA 7 passed the Senate 32
to 0 but died on the Assembly floor, in part because of opposition
from local government.</LD>
<TE>   Into the breach came Assemblyman Kevin Shelley (D-San Francisco)
with the revival of an open records reform that passed in 1999 and
2000 but was vetoed each time by Gov. Gray Davis. Shelley's AB 822
provides that when a state agency or local government denies a
request for public information, the decision can be appealed to the
state attorney general. His office would have 20 days to declare
whether the information should be released. An agency that still
refused to cough up the information could be fined $100 a day, up to
a total of $10,000. AB 822 whizzed through the Legislature without a
single "no" vote.</TE>
<TE>   Davis had objected that the legislation put the attorney general
in a conflict of interest since he also represented the state
agencies. And he complained of the cost. Now, Los Angeles County
Sheriff Lee Baca opposes AB 822 because it would "create additional
burdens on public agencies." Sponsors say there is no indication that
the bureaucracy would be overwhelmed by frivolous requests for
information. In fact, the legislation would help speed the resolution
of cases that now end up in court for months or years.</TE>
<TE>   The Shelley bill fixes the conflict problem in any case where the
attorney general already is representing the agency involved. Any
cost in paper handling is likely to be far less than the legal fees
that agencies pay to defend their denials in court.</TE>
<TE>   Citizen access to public records is a fundamental right in a
democracy, whether it's the content of a highway construction
contract or the musings of a consultant's report. Most denials
probably are made just because officials don't want to be bothered.
But there are plenty of documented cases in which information is kept
secret to cover up mismanagement or wrongdoing. The more light that
shines on government, the more people will be able to trust it. Davis
can help bolster trust significantly by signing AB 822 into law.</TE>

<LD>Pakistani security forces capture a key Al Qaeda suspect in a bloody
shootout. Singapore arrests 21 terrorism suspects, including some who
allegedly had been in Al Qaeda training camps. The FBI breaks up a
possible "sleeper cell" in the quiet Buffalo, N.Y., suburb of
Lackawanna. The first two events are familiar, the third jarring.
Together they comfort, suggesting that after months of few clear
victories, the multinational war on terrorism is progressing.</LD>
<LD>   John Walker Lindh was the first U.S. citizen to become known as an
American Talib, and the five alleged Al Qaeda operatives arrested in
the former steel mill city of Lackawanna--along with a sixth picked
up in Bahrain--may also fit into that category. They are accused of
training at an Al Qaeda base in Afghanistan. Prosecutors say they
spent several weeks in the Afghan camps now notorious for teaching
aspiring terrorists everything from how to obtain false
identification to how to concoct poisons and explosives. The
complaint charges that while they attended the camp, Osama bin Laden
himself came to rail against the United States and Israel.</LD>
<TE>   If a court finds the six suspects conspired to assist Al Qaeda,
they are, whatever the formal charges, traitors. Until then, fairness
and principles of due process require that these Americans be
presumed innocent and that they be given the full protections of the
Constitution. Beyond that, their arrests challenge fellow citizens to
uphold American ideals by continuing to shun anti-Arab or
anti-Islamic bias.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI reports that many Lackawanna Muslims helped its
investigation. Not everyone in Karachi was so cooperative, which
makes Pakistan's arrest of Ramzi Binalshibh all the more heartening.
Some analysts have long suggested that Pakistan's security service,
with its old ties to the Taliban, is more eager to help Al Qaeda than
the United States. But the force proved its loyalty to the war on
terrorism--and its courage--by facing grenade explosions and
automatic weapons fire in arresting Binalshibh and his cohorts.</TE>
<TE>   By his own account, Binalshibh, a Yemeni citizen, had plenty to do
with the planning of the 9/11 attacks. Appearing a week ago on Al
Jazeera, the Arab TV network, he triumphantly showed off a suitcase
of "souvenirs"--flight manuals, CD-ROMs and other items that a cell
in Hamburg, Germany, may have used to help prepare for last
September's airliner attacks.</TE>
<TE>   His arrest gives federal investigators a chance to learn more
about Al Qaeda's operations. There is no mystery about the fanatical
mind-set that led to the attacks. But a moral obligation to the dead
and survivors of 9/11 compels investigators to unravel the chain of
events that led to the destruction of the World Trade Center, the
attack on the Pentagon and the crash in Pennsylvania. More important,
understanding Al Qaeda will give the world's anti-terror agencies a
better intelligence arsenal for thwarting mass murder.</TE>
<TE>   The war on terrorism will never be as fast and conclusive as
Americans desire. But the arrests in Pakistan and Singapore, along
with that of America's homegrown suspects, offer the world's
anti-terror warriors timely encouragement to keep battling.</TE>

<LD>It took a few days to confirm, but Johnny Unitas is not dead. Can't
be. Even if we once envisioned onrushing Merlin Olsen and Deacon
Jones each removing one of the quarterback's arms or Sam Huff burying
the guy in mud, we know Unitas will show up come game time. Not even
a fatal heart attack while working out at 69 could make him late.
Unitas was that tough when he led the Baltimore Colts for 17 years,
went to 10 Pro Bowls, threw touchdowns in 47 consecutive games and
kept showing up and getting up.</LD>
<LD>   Unitas wasn't flashy--no earrings or fancy car. He slouched and
spoke simply, and you couldn't find him in nightclubs or jail. With
no helmet radio, he called his own plays, even if injured. Unitas
hated the name Johnny but never showed emotion; well, he smiled once.
He just showed up in those stupid high-top shoes and kept trying. As
he got older, he got wiser and wilier. Unitas wasn't for quitting
even at 40. Think Clint Eastwood in cleats.</LD>
<TE>   When Unitas turned pro, his passes struggled like wounded ducks.
Pittsburgh's Steelers, always seeking a way to lose, cut the future
Hall of Famer. So what did Unitas do? He worked construction by day
to play sandlot football at night for $6 a game. The Colts called. In
1956, they got him--and three NFL championships. It was frustrating
to cheer against Unitas. Win or lose, he'd walk away quietly, like a
pro. What fun is booing someone like that?</TE>
<TE>   You need not hate the New York Giants (though it helps) to know
that Johnny helped invent sudden-death overtime in the '58 NFL
championship game. New York was winning with 90 seconds left. Unitas
took 83 of them to tie it. In overtime from the one-yard line, Unitas
called a run by Alan Ameche over left tackle. Everybody lined up for
that, including the Giants. But Unitas told Ameche to go right
instead. Ameche plunged to victory virtually untouched. Unitas
smiled.</TE>
<TE>   It took four years and 103 touchdowns for Unitas to set the
47-consecutive-game record for scoring passes. That record stands
after 42 years. The Colts played the Rams here when Unitas broke the
record of 22 games. They halted the game to give Unitas the football.
He didn't dance. He didn't gesture. He said thank you and returned to
work. And do you know where that record-breaking football is today?
We don't either. No one does. No. 19 gave it to some kids to play
with. That's how we know John Unitas lives on.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>My hat goes off to the success that Principal Brian Bauer and his
staff have made of the largest high school in L.A. Granada Hills High
has raised the bar for public school standards. Regarding "Wrinkles
Seen in Dress Policy" (Sept. 11), I was a parent volunteer on the
first day of school when dress code violators were requested to phone
home for a change of clothes. I was elated to hear the strong parent
support for our dress code. A number of parents thanked me for
enforcing the code and for making it easier for them to enforce a
standard at home. I did not encounter one parent arguing that day,
even the ones who opted to leave work to bring a change of clothes
for their student.</LD>
<LD>   It is amazing to see how one or two people can try to negate the
success of a new policy by making a phone call to the ACLU. If they
have suggestions for improvement, why not just pitch in and help us
do it better?</LD>

<TE>   I have two teenage daughters and a son, and when asked to sign off
as a parent on our high school's new dress-code policy last year, I
refused. That's because I read the entire school policy. As in the
L.A. school system, ours calls for detention for violations in the
dress code (which is aimed almost entirely at girls). The biggest
penalty for student-to-student sexual harassment, on the other hand,
is mediation.</TE>
<TE>   What kind of message does that send to our children? I have no
problem with a dress code, but I thought "the dress code made me do
it" defense went out in the '70s.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I think it's an interesting commentary on our social values that the
only people who had their taxes raised during the recent state budget
negotiations were schoolteachers.</LD>
<LD>   The politicians in Sacramento would not raise taxes on the rich.
They refused to raise taxes on car owners. They did not even raise
taxes on smokers. But they suspended the teacher tax credit without
discussion or controversy. This amounts to a tax increase of up to
$1,500 for schoolteachers with four to 24 years of experience.
Teachers with less than four years of experience had not even
qualified for the promised tax credit yet.</LD>
<LD>   Unveiled with great fanfare only two years ago, the teacher tax
credit was supposed to attract new teachers to the underpaid
profession and demonstrate to experienced teachers the value that our
society places on them. Well, teachers now know where they really
stand. At the back of the line behind rich people, car owners and
smokers. Is anyone surprised by that?</LD>

<LD>Re "Closing of Clinic Leaves Many in Lurch," Sept. 14: I have never
been more ashamed of L.A. County, as nine much-needed health clinics
are shut down. Do county officials have any idea how much suffering
and possibly death will result from these closures? Are they aware
that they are hurting those who are least able to cope, those who
have no health insurance and will now have to travel long distances
to receive services?</LD>
<LD>   This will lead to many more illnesses and emergencies that will
not be attended to, and people will suffer enormously. Do county
officials care? They sit in their well-appointed offices and make
decisions like this based on dollars, not people. Do we live in a
Third World country, that we cannot take care of the health needs of
all of our population? The so-called leaders of our county government
should all resign at once.</LD>

<LD>I have felt in my gut that war with Iraq at this time to eliminate
Saddam Hussein is premature and unconscionable. On Sept. 15, after
reading "Scorched-Earth Tactics Ultimately Burn All of Us" by Eric
Scigliano and "Same Man, Same Ground" by John Balzar (Commentary),
I'm sure my gut is right.</LD>
<LD>   Scigliano describes in detail the frightening environmental damage
that will result to the whole world. Balzar, a Marine sergeant in
Vietnam, saw the horrors of war firsthand; but the U.S. could not
finish the job because of lousy decisions in Washington--which is now
threatening to be a repeat. We have not even been able to flush out
Osama bin Laden, the No. 1 terrorist enemy, who is apt to strike
again when our military might is concentrated elsewhere.</LD>

<TE>   Re "Bin Laden's Henchmen Seen to Be Regrouping," Sept. 15: Of

<TE>   Rabbi Leonard Beerman says that "our experience in faith leads us
to repudiate war as the method for problem solving" (Commentary,
Sept. 16), but this is only a half-truth. Our experience--in faith or
otherwise--has taught us to avoid war whenever possible, prosecute it
justly when there is no other alternative and be good at it. I wonder
if he would feel the same about the Allied liberation of death camps
in 1945.</TE>

<TE>   I find incredible The Times' "doubting Thomas" position that more
evidence is needed before the U.S. removes Iraq's Hussein and his
regime ("No Case for Going In Alone," editorial, Sept. 13). The Times
has taken the same containment position as Senate Majority Leader Tom
Daschle (D-S.D.) and others, despite the fact that Hussein has
violated, in one form or another, 16 U.N. resolutions since 1991.
This Neville Chamberlain attitude only allows Hussein to further his
transgressions and allows him more time to do his dirt.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, a number of individuals wanted the president to forcibly
remove Hussein from power. The Democrats were looking for anything to
change the scenery from impeachment and Monica Lewinsky. Today at The
Hague there is a war crimes trial for former Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic. The indictment and evidence against him can be
compared to what is contained in the 16 U.N. resolutions that Hussein
has violated. What's the difference? A president who honestly feels
that [removing] Hussein may be the linchpin to peace in the Middle
East? Or some talking heads who feel it is because our president is a
Republican? Take your pick; both positions have a lot of truth to
them.</TE>

<TE>   It appears strange to me that Bush is spinning so much rhetoric on
a war with Iraq when the real culprit is Saudi Arabia. That nation is
a dictatorship equal to, or worse than, Iraq. Fifteen of the 9/11
terrorists were Saudis. The money that was keeping them active was
from Saudi Arabia. The terrorists may not have weapons of mass
destruction, but they didn't need them, did they? They used our
stuff.</TE>
<TE>   If Bush is so eager to be reelected, why doesn't he work on health
care for all, drugs for seniors, the environment and all the things
that make life a little more palatable? Our economy is falling apart,
but he doesn't want to address it. I don't think a war with Iraq is
the answer.</TE>

<LD>After reading "Two Tales of the Thug Life" (editorial, Sept. 13), on
Tupac Shakur and Stanley "Tookie" Williams, I have questions that
have no apparent answer. What makes violence seem so cool, and what
can be done to prevent this? If the "gangster rappers" decided to rap
about rainbows, peace and all great things, would society grasp them
as it has done with gangster rap? I believe the answer is no; there
is something about violence that grabs youth and drags them to a life
of failure.</LD>
<LD>   As a student at Cal State Northridge, I see people "bumping" their
music as they exit the parking lot, but it does not mean they are
going to go do exactly what the song says. Those individuals who take
the songs at face value are just weak-minded and require parental and
medical attention.</LD>

<TE>   Van Nuys</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I find it incredible that the editorial uses "toughs" to refer to
"thugs" (also your description). These gangsters/thugs are no more
than cowards. Put these hoodlums one on one, take away their gangster
homies and find out how tough they are. I wish the media would call
these creeps what they really are: cowards.</TE>
<TE>   Lanny Adamian</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The editorial sent out a good message. Instead of complaining
about not liking the lyrics that rap music presents, we need to
understand that rap is not a phase and will not just go away. We need
to concentrate on our youth and help them understand the importance
of staying away from gangster life.</TE>
<TE>   There was a lifestyle change for Williams, which is the same story
for a lot of prison inmates. I don't believe that he should be
considered for a Nobel Peace Prize. As with Shakur, who did promote
voting among minorities, small positive steps do not outweigh the
negative. It is still the job of the parents to guide their children
through life. We need to stop blaming every outside influence.</TE>
<TE>   Abeni Carr</TE>
<TE>   Northridge</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Sept. 11 letter on The Times' investigation of Shakur's death
asked, "Who cares?" I care. He was a genius in hood's clothing. He
navigated between high-mindedness and thugdom the only way he knew
how, by "keepin' it real," even if it killed him, which it did. His
ode to his mother, "Dear Mama," is one of the most heartfelt love
songs ever written. He's in the realm of Jimi Hendrix now. His star
has shone, bright and brief, but he's not forgotten.</TE>

<LD>I hope the people of Santa Cruz continue their opposition to federal
drug-war tactics ("Santa Cruz Officials Plan Pot Giveaway," Sept.
12). If the marijuana is grown in California and consumed by
Californians, I do not understand where the federal jurisdiction
comes in. The recent federal raids without the support of local law
enforcement are clearly illegal. Let the federal government
concentrate on national issues, such as defending this country. Let
local government deal with local issues, such as what substances the
citizens of a given state may grow and use.</LD>

<LD>Every day The Times brings us shocking new revelations of
misappropriations for personal benefit, of gross
self-overcompensation and charges of outright looting by senior
executives of publicly held corporations ("Former Tyco Executives Are
Indicted," Sept. 13). It's becoming clear that we are not as moral a
country as we have been taught to believe, that we stock investors
have been naive, that the game is rigged and that "public trust" is
no more than a sucker punch. It's time Congress created some
fundamental legal rules on how publicly held corporations function.</LD>

home.</LD>

<HD>John C. Harper, 78; Preached to 8 Presidents</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Carsten Harper, who preached to eight presidents during 30 years
as rector of St. John's Episcopal Church at Lafayette Square in
Washington, died Friday at Sibley Memorial Hospital after a heart
attack. He was 78.</LD>
<LD>   Harper led services at the church, which calls itself the "Church
of Presidents," until his retirement in 1993.</LD>
<LD>   During those years, every president from John F. Kennedy to Bill
Clinton came to hear at least one of his sermons, which were often
punctuated with literary and historical references.</LD>
<TE>   Harper was known to share the struggles of his own faith and his
concerns for the social needs of the church's immediate community. He
directed the church's outreach to more than 20 community service
organizations and wrote two books: "Sunday: A Minister's Story," a
nonfiction account of a minister's life, published in 1974; and
"Years of Change: Reflections on St. John's Church," published in
1990.</TE>
<TE>   Harper was born in Winthrop, Mass., the son of an Episcopal
minister who served as rector of his own parish for 40 years. The
younger Harper served in the Navy in the South Pacific during World
War II.</TE>
<TE>   He graduated from Harvard University in 1946 and from what is now
Episcopal Divinity School in Cambridge, Mass., in 1953. He later
received honorary degrees from George Washington University and
Nashotah House Episcopal seminary in Wisconsin. As a young man, he
taught at the Taft School, then a private boys school in Watertown,
Conn. Upon ordination to the Episcopal ministry in 1953, he served
parishes in Providence, R.I.; Foxboro, Mass.; and Bedford, N.Y. He
developed a reputation as an engaging speaker and disciplined
administrator.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy attended Harper's installation service at the St. John's
parish in 1963. The two had been classmates at Harvard. Clinton
attended the service celebrating his 30th anniversary there.</TE>
<TE>   Survivors include his wife of 49 years, Barbara Quarles Harper of
Washington; three children; and 10 grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>LaWanda Page, 81; Actress Played Aunt Esther in 'Sanford
and Son'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>LaWanda Page, comedic character actress best known for her role as
the Bible-thumping Aunt Esther in the 1970s television hit "Sanford
and Son," has died. She was 81.</LD>
<LD>   Page died Saturday in Centinela Hospital in Los Angeles of
complications from diabetes.</LD>
<LD>   "LaWanda lived the life she loved, and loved the life she lived,"
said Donald Welch, who wrote and directed a comedy gospel musical in
which Page starred, "Take It to the Lord ... Or Else." He said Page
had often used the phrase as a soothing accolade when close friends
died.</LD>
<TE>   Born in Cleveland and reared in St. Louis, Page began her career
as a dancer and chorus girl billed as "the Bronze Goddess of Fire."
She soon became adept at stand-up comedy.</TE>
<TE>   But her greatest fame began in her 50s, when childhood friend Redd
Foxx asked her to join his Norman Lear sitcom adapted from the
British series "Steptoe and Son." Page signed on as Fred Sanford's
crusty sister-in-law, Esther Anderson, in 1973 and stayed until the
series ended with Foxx's departure in 1977.</TE>
<TE>   As proprietor of the run-down Sanford Arms rooming house next door
to Sanford's junkyard, Aunt Esther was constantly at odds with Fred
over his lifestyle, his business and how he treated his grown son,
Lamont, played by Demond Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   Page perfected the persona of a righteous, elderly woman who more
than stood up for herself. She reprised the Aunt Esther role in two
short-lived "Sanford and Son" spinoffs, "The Sanford Arms" in 1977
and Foxx's own "Sanford" in 1980. She also made guest appearances on
Foxx's variety show, "The Redd Foxx Comedy Hour" in 1977.</TE>
<TE>   Again as a mouthy matriarch, Page was a regular in another brief
sitcom, "Detective School" in 1979, as one of the unlikely students
trying to become a private eye. Similarly, she was Ma, owner of the
cops' favorite neighborhood restaurant in the brief 1980 series
"B.A.D. Cats" (an acronym for Burglary Auto Detail, Commercial Auto
Thefts), starring a little-known Michelle Pfeiffer as a police
officer.</TE>
<TE>   Page also appeared in such films as 1982's "Zapped!" and Ice
Cube's "Friday" in 1995 and had guest roles on such television series
as "Family Matters," "In Living Color" and "Martin."</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, Page also made television commercials, including
a well-received one for Atlanta-based Church's Fried Chicken. To tout
the chain's honey-buttered biscuits, she was seen humorously milking
a "bumblecow" that was adorned with bee's wings and antennae, then
deadpanning into the camera, "Hey, it could happen."</TE>
<TE>   Page is survived by her daughter, Clara Johnson, of Los Angeles,
and sister, Lynn Hamilton.</TE>
<TE>   Funeral arrangements are pending.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Lolita Torres, 72, a singer and one of the top actresses from
Argentina's golden era of cinema, died Saturday in a Buenos Aires
hospital of complications from a lung infection. She had suffered
from rheumatoid fever for more than a decade.</LD>
<LD>   Born Beatriz Mariana Torres, she began singing at age 11,
performing Spanish folk songs in a leading Buenos Aires theater.
Adopting the first name of the fictional young heroine Lolita, she
went on to record such hits as "Te lo juro yo (I Swear It to You)."</LD>
<LD>   But Torres was best known to her countrymen for her film career.
From 1944 until her retirement in 1972, she acted in 17 films
alongside some of Latin America's best-known actors. She worked at
locations on both sides of the Atlantic, filming in Colombia, Mexico,
the Soviet Union and Spain.</LD>
<TE>   Last month, Torres was named a "special citizen" by Buenos Aires.
After her death, former Argentine President Carlos Menem called her
"one of the greatest of all time."</TE>

<HD>Nguyen Van Thuan, 74; Exiled Vietnamese Cardinal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cardinal Francois Xavier Nguyen Van Thuan, 74, whose agonizing
account of imprisonment by the Communists in Vietnam made him an
inspirational figure for many Catholics in his homeland, died Monday
of cancer at a clinic in Rome.</LD>
<LD>   Although made a cardinal only last year, Thuan appeared on lists
of possible successors to Pope John Paul II, particularly by those
believing the next pontiff could come from a poor, non-European
country.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Hue, Thuan was ordained a priest in Vietnam on June 11,
1953. He was appointed deputy archbishop of Saigon just days before
the South Vietnamese capital fell to the Communist North in April
1975.</LD>
<TE>   Targeted for his faith as well as his family connections--his
uncle was Ngo Dinh Diem, the assassinated South Vietnamese
president--Thuan spent 13 years in a Communist "reeducation" camp,
nine in solitary.</TE>
<TE>   During that time, he fashioned a tiny Bible out of scraps of
paper. Sympathetic guards smuggled in a piece of wood and some wire
from which he crafted a small crucifix.</TE>
<TE>   In his book "The Way of Hope--Thoughts of Light From a Prison
Cell," he wrote: "In our country there is a saying: 'A day in prison
is worth a thousand autumns of freedom.' I myself experienced this.
While in prison, everyone waits for freedom, every day, every minute.
We must live each day, each minute of our life as though it is the
last."</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, he was forced into exile. At the Vatican, he ran the
Pontifical Council of Justice and Peace, handling issues such as
Third World debt.</TE>

<HD>Clues Sought in Toddler's Death</HD>
<DH>Investigation: Oxnard police will question residents of a
mobile home park where the child was hit by a vehicle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oxnard police will go door-to-door at a mobile home park today to
question residents about a toddler who was struck and killed by a
vehicle over the weekend, authorities said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Isbel Gonzales, 20 months old, was hit by a vehicle about 4:30
p.m. Saturday outside her family's home in the Mobile Home Lodge,
1301 Commercial Ave., police said.</LD>
<LD>   An autopsy showed the child died from blunt-force head injuries,
said James Baroni, a senior deputy coroner's investigator.</LD>
<TE>   "Nobody so far has come forward to say they heard anything or saw
anything directly related to the crash," Oxnard Officer David
Villanueva said. "The family of the girl is incensed."</TE>
<TE>   Villanueva said at least 10 officers will fan out through the
south Oxnard neighborhood today to question residents.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said they are certain someone in the mobile home park
knows what occurred but may be concerned about getting involved.</TE>
<TE>   "Accidents happen. We just need to find out what happened,"
Villanueva said.</TE>
<TE>   The mobile home park, which has signs alerting drivers about a 5
mph speed limit, is heavily traveled by vehicles and pedestrians,
police said. Residents have complained that drivers regularly speed
in the area.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of the child's death, several residents were hosting
parties in anticipation of the televised boxing match between
Fernando Vargas, formerly of Oxnard, and Oscar De La Hoya, police
said.</TE>
<TE>   During their preliminary investigation Saturday, police were told
about a sedan seen in the area after the girl was struck, Villanueva
said.</TE>
<TE>   The sedan and its owner were found Saturday, authorities said.
While the car's owner has denied being involved in the accident, the
sedan was impounded, investigators said.</TE>
<TE>   Villanueva said the car was undergoing an inspection and tests at
the county's crime lab.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities hope to determine whether the vehicle had been
involved in a recent accident or contained physical evidence from the
child.</TE>
<TE>   Test results could take several days, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately after the child's death, police were not certain of
the cause of the injuries, primarily because there were no witnesses
and no direct evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities now believe the toddler was hit by a vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Isbel is survived by her parents, a sister, 7, and a brother, 4.</TE>
<TE>   Police are helping the family secure financial assistance for both
the funeral and counseling, Villanueva said.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone with information on the accident has been urged to call
Oxnard police at 385-7750.</TE>
<TE>   Callers can remain anonymous, police said.</TE>

<HD>Preservationists Discover 'Trailer Park That Time Forgot'</HD>
<DH>History: Highland Park site is a relic of a time when
Americans made their first long road trips.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles register of Historic-Cultural Monuments may look like
a fairly complete document, but don't let those 18th century
missions, 19th century mansions and early 20th century movie houses
fool you. The list lacks trailer parks, and the city's Cultural
Heritage Commission thinks it's time to change that.</LD>
<LD>   In a move that state and federal experts say could be the first of
its kind, the commissioners are asking City Council members to give
monument status to the Monterey Trailer Park, a 1.7-acre site at
Highland Park's eastern edge that dates to the early 1920s, a pivotal
era when Americans were taking their first long-haul road trips with
Model Ts--and without motels.</LD>
<LD>   The property's owner, who acquired it in April, has written city
officials to say he's not just opposed to the idea but
"flabbergasted" by it. "For eight years, it was sitting there with
nothing done to it," Peter Young said. "And now that I'm trying to
restore it, they're calling it historical. You should have seen the
amount of trash that was hauled."</LD>
<TE>   Young said he has no plans for major changes to the property, and
bought it for its "interesting character." But he said he fears a
monument designation--which requires property owners to get city
approval before making substantial changes--would leave him too few
options. City staffers said a vote is probably weeks away.</TE>
<TE>   Preservationists say few such sites remain and note that the
city's Historic-Cultural Monuments list, begun in 1962 and now 715
sites long, is already a diverse document. Entries include a row of
avocado trees in Los Feliz that may date to the 19th century; the
1939 Coca-Cola building downtown (which was designed to resemble a
cruise ship); and the Catalina, an actual ship that shuttled
passengers between San Pedro and Catalina Island from the 1920s to
the 1970s. (At last report, the vessel was moored in Ensenada, which
would make it the only city landmark now in foreign waters.)</TE>
<TE>   In the vast majority of cases, says city Historic Preservation
Officer Jay Oren, the council follows the Cultural Heritage
Commission's advice on monument designations.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in the quirky community at the tree-shaded trailer park
site, just south of the Pasadena Freeway and just west of the South
Pasadena city line, the property's history and the future are topics
A and B. About 30 tenants dwell there full time or part time in
trailers and mobile homes on pads where 10 original "auto camp"
cabins once stood.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like a bubble here, a time capsule ... the land of the
lost," said Ed Lum, a 36-year-old graphic artist who has lived there
since 1996. "To get a space here is about like getting a good
apartment in New York. You have to wait until somebody dies, almost."</TE>
<TE>   The most voluble tenant is John Agnew, who discovered the park
while making a U-turn eight years ago. A collector of vintage
trailers and a transportation specialist for television and film
production, Agnew "just fell in love" and seized his first chance to
move into the park. Then the 40-year-old Agnew encouraged several
friends and his sister to follow, thereby lowering the property's
median age and raising awareness of its potential as the trailer park
that time forgot.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, Agnew took over as resident manager, planted some
succulents, rolled in his collection of about 15 old trailers, added
a pair of pink flamingos and laid plans to buy the place himself.</TE>
<TE>   It's because that purchase effort failed and Agnew had to haul off
most of his trailers, Young contends, that the former manager
contacted preservationists in a bid to tie him up in red tape. Agnew,
who relocated the trailers to a new home in Altadena, says he and his
allies are just trying to protect the park and its residents.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't just buy a piece of property. He bought family," Agnew
said. "He bought a big relationship with a lot of people with
different backgrounds."</TE>
<TE>   The deeper tale behind the trailer park begins in the early 1920s,
when a businessman named Elmer Drummond opened a gas station down the
street and dubbed this site the Monterey Auto Camp. In 1923 and 1924,
Drummond built a pair of small Craftsman-style houses, which remain,
one of them occupied by a tenant. The site also includes a former
office (now converted into a residence and occupied); the site's
original bathing-and-laundry building (now locked up); and a
structure that may be one of the 10 original guest cabins, now
amended, expanded and occupied by a tenant. Around these ramshackle
buildings sit 22 trailers and mobile homes, mostly owned by tenants
who rent the pads they occupy.</TE>
<TE>   At least a few of these tenants are big believers in the trailer's
role in human history. Thursday morning, in fact, found Agnew and Lum
and a few friends seated by Agnew's 30-foot '57 Airfloat, watching an
old documentary on Airstream pioneer Wally Byam's 1959-60 jaunt from
Capetown, South Africa, to Cairo, a venture that entailed 41 trailers
and took 221 days.</TE>
<TE>   But preservationists say the central issue is not whether the
park's trailers and mobile homes, none of which predate the 1950s,
deserve a place in local annals alongside Union Station or the
Hollywood sign. Instead, they say, the site's layout and enduring
buildings illustrate the emergence of car culture in the early 20th
century, when entrepreneurs were scrambling to house a new breed of
traveler: the long-distance auto tourist.</TE>
<TE>   Eight decades later, it's still clear that the Drummond family's
strategy included a forest setting. Trailers are set among five tall
Monterey pines (apparently planted in the 1920s), another set of
Cypress pines, several live oaks (estimated age: more than 100
years), about 15 Chinese elms, 10 walnut trees and a pair of
California redwoods.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a real part of our history," said Meri Pritchett, a
29-year-old West Adams resident and Los Angeles Conservancy member
who collaborated with Hollywood artist Sara Velas on the nomination,
which commissioners approved earlier this month. "It's especially
part of L.A.'s history, because people came into this area post-World
War I, and there were a lot of these auto camps acting as temporary
housing before L.A. was able to boom."</TE>
<TE>   Ken Bernstein, director of preservation issues for the Los Angeles
Conservancy and a supporter of the park's nomination, said he knows
of no comparable sites in Southern California. State officials said
their database search of more than 50,000 registered California
historic sites turned up no trailer parks. National Park Service
historian Edson Beall said he got the same result in a review of 1
million buildings, structures, sites and objects listed on the
National Register of Historic Places.</TE>
<TE>   Though RV parks and permanent trailer communities remain in ample
evidence nationwide, many historians say the auto camps played a
different role in their day, acting as way stations for Model T
enthusiasts and setting the stage for the opening of the first motel,
the Milestone Motel, in San Luis Obispo in 1925.</TE>
<TE>   Along with the conservancy, supporters of the nomination include
the governing board of the Highland Park Heritage Trust and historian
Richard Longstreth, a specialist in the dawn of the automobile age in
Southern California. Longstreth, an author and professor at George
Washington University in Washington, suggested in a May letter that
the trailer park site might be "a unique survivor" and that beyond
city recognition, the property may merit listing on the National
Register of Historic Places.</TE>
<TE>   Of the five dozen mobile home parks in Los Angeles, said 19-year
resident Don Brown, president of the homeowners association, "this is
the most unusual, because of the trees, the surroundings, the
landscaping. We have the country here in the city. You don't see that
in a lot of trailer parks.... People come to this park, and the next
step is Forest Lawn."</TE>
<TE>   In August, commissioners visited the site, scarcely noticeable
from Monterey Road because of its thick vegetation and sloping
topography, and Sept. 4 they gave a unanimous thumbs-up for historic
listing. Young, a teacher, says he was unable to argue his side
because the meeting fell during his first week of school.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Nick Pacheco, whose 14th District includes the site,
said he hasn't visited or made up his mind, but he noted that in
proposed historic monument cases, "it's always an awkward situation
when the property owner is not the applicant."</TE>
<TE>   Until the recent sale, the park had remained in the Drummond
family. County assessor's records show that Young, of San Marino,
paid $540,000 for the site, a figure that reflects the restrictions
imposed by city rent-control laws and state legislation that shields
mobile home park residents from eviction and other measures.</TE>
<TE>   If he's able to act on his plans for the property, Young said, "I
would envision most of it will stay as is, and the two houses on top
of the hill will be restored to their original situation." However,
if zoning and other restrictions permit, Young said, he might try to
convert the old bathhouse's interior into a living quarters and might
add two or three more trailers or mobile homes. As it is, he said,
rental income falls short of the mortgage payments.</TE>
<TE>   When he took over the property, Young said, he found that
transients had been trespassing in some of the buildings, and that
many doors and windows had been poorly maintained. When he sought a
demolition permit for one boarded-up structure, he said, the Building
and Safety Department sent out an inspector who gave quick approval.
(Building and Safety officials confirm that a demolition permit was
issued for a building; Young has said he will hold off on demolition
at least until the historic question is resolved.)</TE>
<TE>   Though the country was dotted with thousands of short-term trailer
courts as recently as the late 1940s--in a 1941 tourist guide,
Trailer Travel magazine listed the Monterey Road property among 41
auto camps, tourist courts and related venues in Los Angeles
County--historians say almost all have been overtaken by newer
development. Given that, said the Los Angeles Conservancy's
Bernstein, "I don't anticipate that this is going to start a movement
to designate dozens of trailers."</TE>

<HD>Al Qaeda Suspect in U.S. Hands</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Man alleged to have helped plan the Sept. 11
attacks is taken from Pakistan to an undisclosed location.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KARACHI, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>Capitalizing on the capture of the man who may know more than anyone
about the planning and origins of the Sept. 11 attacks, U.S.
authorities whisked Ramzi Binalshibh out of Pakistan on Monday for
interrogation at a secret location.</LD>
<LD>   Binalshibh and four other Al Qaeda suspects captured in raids in
Karachi last week were turned over to the United States despite
earlier statements by a Pakistani official that they first would have
to be brought before a magistrate.</LD>
<LD>   Maj. Gen. Rashid Qureshi, a spokesman for President Pervez
Musharraf, said Binalshibh was now in U.S. custody. But neither he
nor other sources would say where the Americans had taken him.</LD>
<TE>   "We have handed over a total of five suspects to the U.S.
authorities, including Ramzi. They have been handed over to the
United States, and they must have been flown out of Pakistan,"
Qureshi said.</TE>
<TE>   Police sources in Karachi said the suspects were taken out of the
country, most likely through Jacobabad, a Sindh province city where
U.S. forces have quietly been allowed to set up flight operations on
an air base. The sources said they did not know where the suspects
were taken from there.</TE>
<TE>   The relative haste with which Pakistan surrendered the suspects to
the Americans reflected Musharraf's continuing eagerness to be seen
as acting as a strong ally to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, officials on Monday refused to say where Binalshibh
is, or even who has custody of him. "I don't want to get into that,"
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld told a Pentagon briefing.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. intelligence officials, however, said Binalshibh would not be
taken to the United States or to the American naval base at
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Rather, a likely first stop is a U.S. military
facility in Afghanistan, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Asked at the briefing whether Binalshibh might be a logical
candidate to face a military tribunal, Rumsfeld said that will be
decided by President Bush. "And to my knowledge, he's not addressed
this," Rumsfeld said. "And I think I would know."</TE>
<TE>   Campaigning for Republican congressional candidates in Davenport,
Iowa, Bush exulted at the capture of Binalshibh but made no reference
to his now being in U.S. custody.</TE>
<TE>   "He thought he could hide. He thought he could still threaten
America. But he forgot the greatest nation on the face of the Earth
is after them--one person at a time," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   Identified by German investigators as a former roommate of lead
Sept. 11 hijacker Mohamed Atta in the northern city of Hamburg,
Binalshibh boasted in an interview with the Al Jazeera television
network broadcast last week that he had been the "coordinator" of the
terrorist attacks. The FBI says he also was to have been the 20th
hijacker in the attacks but was turned down four times for a U.S.
visa.</TE>
<TE>   Binalshibh's audacity in granting the interview on the
much-watched pan-Arab channel seemed to confirm that Al Qaeda was
regrouping in this overcrowded southern port city, and may have
spurred Pakistan to act quickly to find and arrest him and his
colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the five suspects taken away by U.S. authorities,
Pakistan was still holding five lower-level individuals captured in
last week's raids, which provoked a three-hour gun battle that left
two Al Qaeda suspects dead and six members of Pakistan's security
forces wounded. The shootout took place on the anniversary of the
Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Associated Press quoted Pakistani sources as saying police were
investigating whether some of those arrested with Binalshibh were
involved in the murder of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl,
who was abducted in Karachi in January.</TE>
<TE>   Qureshi announced that the Americans had taken Binalshibh and the
others while the spokesman was accompanying Musharraf on a tour of a
military exhibition here. Security in Karachi was heavy, in part
because of the many militant Islamic groups in the city who have
declared their enmity for Musharraf since he aligned Pakistan with
the U.S. fight against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Binalshibh's Al Jazeera interview had been an embarrassment to the
Pakistani government, which has been sensitive to criticism that
operatives of the Al Qaeda terrorist network and the former Afghan
Taliban regime have been able to find sanctuary in Pakistan with
ease. Qureshi was eager to dispel the idea that Pakistan is a haven
for such people.</TE>
<TE>   "We are progressively and smoothly moving ahead with the
international war on terrorism," he said. "The recent arrests show
that the backbone of the terrorist network seems to have broken."</TE>
<TE>   But he acknowledged that some Al Qaeda elements "on the run" might
still be hiding in Karachi and other big Pakistani cities.</TE>
<TE>   Until Qureshi's announcement that the prisoners were in U.S.
hands, officials here had been saying that the suspects would be
given normal extradition hearings.</TE>
<TE>   Interior Minister Moinuddin Haider said Monday that investigators
had completed their job of interrogating Binalshibh and the others
arrested. Haider said that Binalshibh was the only high-profile
terrorist suspect among those captured in the shootout and that the
others were his Yemeni guards. At the time, Haider said he expected
to bring them before a magistrate who would rule on the legality of
any U.S. extradition request.</TE>
<TE>   Germany had an international arrest warrant out on Binalshibh, but
German Interior Minister Otto Schily said Sunday that its request for
extradition would be deferred in favor of Washington's because of the
severity of the Sept. 11 attacks. Binalshibh, a Yemeni national, is
considered the most important Al Qaeda member to be taken into
custody since the arrest of Abu Zubeida, a top-echelon official of
the terrorist network captured in Pakistan in March.</TE>
<TE>   Binalshibh might face the same legal fate as Zubeida. U.S.
officials have never disclosed the whereabouts of Zubeida but have
described him as a prime candidate for a military tribunal.</TE>
<TE>   He is not believed to be at the makeshift prison at Guantanamo
Bay, which is holding nearly 600 detainees from the war in
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Sources have said he has cooperated with U.S. intelligence
officials.</TE>

<HD>Iraq Says a U.N. Team Can Return; U.S. Dismisses Offer</HD>
<DH>Dispute: Baghdad tells secretary-general that weapons
inspectors will have unrestricted access. Washington insists the
issue is disarmament.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAGGIE FARLEY and ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>Iraq said Monday that it would allow U.N. arms inspectors
unconditional access to suspected weapons sites, an effort to avoid
attack that will test the Security Council's growing support for U.S.
demands for action.</LD>
<LD>   While U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan expressed hopes that the
offer was the first step in defusing the conflict, the Bush
administration immediately dismissed it as "a tactic that will fail."</LD>
<LD>   U.S. officials said the Iraqi offer echoed Baghdad's earlier
maneuvers to stall and divide the council, and dealt only with
weapons inspections, not with the host of other U.N. resolutions Iraq
has violated. They said the United States would continue pressing for
a new U.N. resolution requiring Iraq to disarm.</LD>
<TE>   But Iraq's move puts pressure on the newly united Security
Council. British officials, anticipating such a move by Baghdad,
rejected the offer. Diplomats from Russia and France, also Security
Council members, supported the return of weapons inspectors and
cautioned that the U.S. should work through the council. French
Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin warned that Washington should
think twice before striking alone. "This could be the most important
foreign policy decision they will take since World War II," he said
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Iraqi Foreign Minister Naji Sabri wrote in a letter to Annan that
"to remove any doubts that Iraq still possesses weapons of mass
destruction," Iraqi authorities would allow inspectors to continue
their work "without conditions."</TE>
<TE>   Iraq is ready to start immediate discussions on the details of the
inspectors' return, the letter said.</TE>
<TE>   Annan credited President Bush's speech Thursday with prompting
Iraq's offer. In the address, Bush challenged the U.N. to act against
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein or to stand back to let the U.S.
strike.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe the president's speech galvanized the international
community," Annan said. "Almost every speaker in the General Assembly
urged Iraq to accept the return of the inspectors."</TE>
<TE>   Besides the threat of war, pressure by Iraq's Arab neighbors
strongly influenced Baghdad, diplomats say. Annan praised the head of
the Arab League, Amr Moussa, "for his strenuous efforts in helping to
convince Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   The turning point came Saturday in a confidential meeting Moussa
arranged in Annan's office with Arab foreign ministers and Sabri.</TE>
<TE>   "This buys the region some time to try to change the dynamics by
putting pressure on Iraq to convince them they have to cooperate
fully or it'll be their last chance," said a senior Arab diplomat who
was at the meeting. "We were on a collision course, and now we've
avoided a collision--for now. So let's give the inspectors a chance
and see where it leads us."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. reaction was much harsher.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a matter of inspections," said White House spokesman
Scott McClellan. "It is about disarmament of Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction and the Iraqi regime's compliance with all other Security
Council resolutions.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a tactical step by Iraq in hopes of avoiding strong U.N.
Security Council action," he said. "As such, it is a tactic that will
fail. It is time for the Security Council to act."</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. official at the United Nations said any return to Iraq by
weapons inspectors was likely to be short-lived.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been through this before. We are very skeptical that the
Iraqis can be trusted even if they invite the inspectors back in," he
said. "We fully expect Iraq not to comply."</TE>
<TE>   British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, in comments made before
Iraq's offer became public, said that previous announcements "have
been an alternative to doing what Iraq is required to do by
international law, which is to readmit the inspectors without
condition and without restriction."</TE>
<TE>   De Villepin said the Security Council must discuss what to do
after inspectors return.</TE>
<TE>   News agencies quoted Russia's foreign minister, Igor S. Ivanov, as
saying that Iraq's offer ended the need for any new resolution
against it.</TE>
<TE>   Other diplomats warned that Iraq is offering the bare minimum to
evade a U.S. attack. The letter does not promise to fulfill Baghdad's
obligation to allow "full and unfettered" access by the U.N.
inspectors. And it's not a promise to disarm, but just an invitation
for inspectors to come look.</TE>
<TE>   "At best, it's Iraq willing to take the first step. At worst, it's
another false promise," said a senior State Department official
traveling with Secretary of State Colin L. Powell Monday night. He
said that a new resolution must contain three elements: a statement
that Iraq has breached U.N. resolutions, specifications of what Iraq
must do to prove cooperation with the U.N., and the consequences if
Iraq fails to comply.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials portrayed the letter's offer to discuss "practical
arrangements" for the resumption of inspections as a potential
quagmire. Hans Blix, the head of the U.N. weapons inspection team,
said in an interview Friday that he must settle issues ranging from
the use of helicopter landing pads to establishing regional offices
before he can send inspectors back to begin their work. While the
U.N. can send a set-up team to Baghdad "within days," he said, those
practical discussions could take several weeks, and procuring
equipment could take up to a month.</TE>
<TE>   Unless a new resolution changes the terms of the inspections,
Blix's team will have 60 days to reequip and visit old sites to
define their mission before officially starting work. The inspection
team will expect "full, unfettered access" to any site at any time.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq is expected to have carefully concealed any ongoing weapons
development in the four years that the inspectors have been kept out
of the country. Blix expects that weapons projects will have been
replicated across the nation, moved underground or onto mobile
laboratories to avoid detection.</TE>
<TE>   As Iraq made its offer Monday, the United States shifted its own
approach, scrapping the idea of "coercive inspections," or deploying
troops in or near Iraq to back up U.N. weapons inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   Powell, who returned to the United Nations on Monday to lobby for
international support for confronting Baghdad, will instead push for
a "one-strike" policy that would allow U.N. members to use military
force the first time Iraq blocked weapons inspectors, U.S. officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   Coercive inspections would have included the option of using force
to ensure that U.N. teams gained access to facilities, documents and
personnel involved with the production of any nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons and ballistic missiles. The one-strike policy
would mean ending inspections after a single Iraqi refusal to
cooperate--and then permitting a military operation.</TE>
<TE>   Powell said he had been encouraged by the transformation in
discussions about Iraq since Bush called on the world body to stand
together to make Hussein end 11 years of defiance on disarmament and
other promises on political, economic and humanitarian issues.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very pleased at the response that the president's speech has
generated. I've had quite a number of bilateral meetings, and I think
that the political dynamic has changed and there is a great deal of
pressure now being placed upon Iraq to come into compliance with the
U.N. mandates," Powell told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking before Iraq made its latest offer, Powell predicted that
a strong resolution would be passed soon. Other U.S. and U.N.
diplomats had said they expected a draft resolution to begin
circulating next week, with a push for swift passage.</TE>
<TE>   The United States wants any resolution to cover more than Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be, in the not too distant future I hope, a new
resolution from the United Nations that I think will capture all the
violations of the last 11 years," Powell said.</TE>
<TE>   France and many Arab countries proposed a two-step approach that
called for two resolutions--one covering the return of weapons
inspectors and a second one authorizing the use of force.</TE>
<TE>   "You need the support of the other countries. You just cannot go
and do things alone. We insist on the two-part process to build
confidence, to build the support of the international community," De
Villepin, the French foreign minister, told reporters Monday.</TE>
<TE>   France also wants to wait to pass the second resolution until
after Iraq violates the first resolution.</TE>
<TE>   The United States favors a single resolution, fearing that having
two will allow Hussein time to manipulate and draw out the process.
It might also require another major U.S. diplomatic effort to win
backing for a second one.</TE>

<HD>SEC Probes Welch's Benefits</HD>
<DH>Compensation: Retired GE chief executive has agreed to give
back many of the perks in his deal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>General Electric Co. disclosed Monday that federal regulators are
investigating its deal funding millions of dollars in retirement
perks for former Chief Executive Jack Welch, who separately agreed to
cancel most of the controversial benefits package.</LD>
<LD>   Welch, long admired for his stewardship of GE and the profit he
returned to shareholders, has seen his reputation tarnished in recent
weeks and has been forced to defend the retirement deal that gave him
free use of corporate jets, a luxury apartment in New York and even
free flowers.</LD>
<LD>   GE said the Securities and Exchange Commission, in an "informal
investigation," has asked for information about Welch's employment
and the post-retirement agreement he signed in 1996, apparently to
examine whether the perks were fully disclosed to shareholders and
the public.</LD>
<TE>   Welch has insisted that all the benefits were disclosed, but said
Monday that he would give up most of the free perks and begin paying
GE $2 million to $2.5 million a year for rides in company planes and
the use of a company-paid apartment. He will retain the use of a GE
office and secretary, a benefit offered to every former GE chief
executive, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The 66-year-old executive's retirement package drew attention this
month when Welch's wife listed in a divorce filing the scope and
estimated value of what Welch was getting. The filing said that, in
addition to paying for country club memberships, family phones and
computers in five homes, GE paid for flowers, wine and maid service
and provided tickets to sporting events and opera performances.</TE>
<TE>   Welch, who was paid more than $16 million in 2001--his final year
as GE's chief executive--maintained that his benefits were grossly
distorted by his wife. Welch said in a guest column Monday in the
Wall Street Journal that he was giving up the free perks, even though
he thought they were reasonable, to save GE from further controversy.
When reached Monday, Welch said that the column said everything he
had to say and he would not comment further.</TE>
<TE>   In the column, Welch noted that the retirement agreement was
written in 1996, when he reportedly was being courted by other
Fortune 500 firms. The board wanted to give him a cash retention
bonus of "tens of millions of dollars," he wrote, but he opted for
the benefits contract instead.</TE>
<TE>   Welch said that despite believing the agreement was proper, he was
giving it up because it could be misperceived amid the rash of
corporate scandals this year. Welch said he decided Thursday to give
up the benefits after discussing the matter with the GE board.</TE>
<TE>   "In today's reality, my 1996 employment contract could be
misportrayed as an excessive retirement package, rather than what it
is--part of a fair employment and post-employment contract made six
years ago," he wrote in the column. "For GE and its board to be
dragged into these stories because of a divorce dispute is just plain
wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Corporate pay experts said the SEC investigation probably will
focus on disclosure.</TE>
<TE>   Although Welch's employment agreement stipulated that GE would
provide him "continued access to company facilities and services
comparable to those provided to him prior to his retirement,
including access to company aircraft, cars, office, apartments, and
financial planning services" for life, neither that agreement nor the
company's latest proxy statement was specific about the cost of this
arrangement.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts said the concern may be less about the benefits Welch
receives now than what he received while still CEO.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody is focused on the fact that Welch was getting these
benefits in retirement, but it's clear that he was getting them all
along," said Paul Hodgson, senior research associate at the Corporate
Library, a Maine-based Web site that focuses on executive pay
arrangements and corporate governance. "The question is whether some
of the benefits and perks that he was allegedly provided should have
been disclosed in proxy statements for the past 20 years."</TE>
<TE>   In the proxy statement covering 2001, GE lists "other"
compensation for Welch as including 10% to 14% interest on his
deferred compensation savings, worth about $1.2 million for the year;
the value of supplemental life insurance premiums paid on Welch's
behalf at a cost of $1.06 million; and a savings plan that netted
Welch $340,375 in addition to his $3.375-million salary and
$12.7-million bonus.</TE>
<TE>   But GE does not list the cost of the personal use of its private
planes, cars and apartments.</TE>
<TE>   The company considered these ordinary business expenses rather
than perks, said Gary Sheffer, a GE spokesman. Until Welch retired,
the company considered all of Welch's plane trips to be
business--even if the corporate jet was used to fly Welch around on
vacation, Sheffer said.</TE>
<TE>   The reason: GE's board ordered Welch never to take commercial
flights for "security reasons." Thus, the GE plane was being used for
the purpose of keeping the firm's CEO secure, even while at play. GE
said that eliminated the need for it to disclose the use as "other
compensation" in the proxy statement.</TE>
<TE>   Sheffer said the imputed value of these perks would be disclosed
on Welch's tax statements. Welch would be required to pay income tax
on the value of the benefit, but employee tax statements are private
and GE would not disclose the value it estimated for Welch's
company-provided benefits.</TE>
<TE>   "It is really hard to classify where the line is drawn between
where something becomes a real benefit to you and when it's provided
to you as a business need," Hodgson said. But it's likely that the
SEC is looking into whether more benefits information should have
been reported, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The GE controversy may help spur sweeping changes--from disclosure
of more information to fewer perks for executives--some compensation
experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this means that companies are going to have to be much
simpler and much more transparent about what they do," said Dan
Marcus, practice leader for the Southern California executive
compensation practice at Mercer Human Resources Consulting. "Doing
unusual things--even for the right reasons--will go away, because
it's not worth the trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Scott Klinger, co-director for responsible wealth at United for a
Fair Economy, said: "I think we are seeing a shift where executives
are actually going to have to pay for their own personal living
expenses. They are paid well. They should be able to afford their own
dry cleaning, maid service and toiletries."</TE>
<TE>   But some doubted that Welch's decision to give back some perks
would affect other retired CEOs.</TE>
<TE>   "I would say that Welch gave this up because he's concerned about
the company's image," Hodgson said. "Nobody else is going to do that,
unless they get found out."</TE>

<HD>Hospital's Water Well Is Polluted</HD>
<DH>Safety: Inland Empire medical center fails to alert county
officials. Facility's administrator says he is seeking an independent
test first.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>COLTON, Calif.</DL>
<LD>The water well supplying Arrowhead Regional Medical Center, San
Bernardino County's general hospital and one of the major trauma
centers in the Inland Empire, has been contaminated with a pollutant
apparently left behind by Cold War-era munitions plants, officials
said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   At least two weeks ago, hospital tests confirmed the presence of
perchlorate, a compound that is often used while making rocket fuel
and munitions and is known to cause a number of ailments, including
thyroid problems and cancer.</LD>
<LD>   The medical center found 8.6 parts of perchlorate per billion in
its well, said Arrowhead Chief Executive Mark Uffer. State regulators
say there is reason to be concerned whenever levels exceed 4 parts
per billion, but there is no immediate danger. Medical analysts say
it takes years of exposure before perchlorate can cause disease.</LD>
<TE>   After discovering the pollution, representatives from Arrowhead
called Colton City Hall to inquire about circumventing the hospital's
water supply by hooking up with a clean water line from the city,
said Eric Fraser, Colton's director of water and wastewater.</TE>
<TE>   But the hospital never called back, officials said. Since then,
the hospital has not alerted the public, nor administrators in San
Bernardino County, which owns the institution, the officials said.</TE>
<TE>   State law requires the hospital to alert the Board of Supervisors
when perchlorate is discovered in its water supply in amounts greater
than 4 parts per billion, said Rufus Howell, assistant chief of the
California Division of Drinking Water and Environmental Management.
That hasn't happened.</TE>
<TE>   California regulators also recommend immediate public disclosure,
though it's not required by law, Howell said.</TE>
<TE>   Several area officials questioned the hospital's decision to
remain quiet about the contamination, particularly when Colton
officials say they are fully prepared to begin piping in clean water.</TE>
<TE>   "They are not, in my opinion, taking the prudent action to avoid
the risk to public health," Fraser said. "If you can avoid it, do
it."</TE>
<TE>   But hospital administrator Uffer said that he just learned of the
perchlorate report Monday, and that he wants to double-check the
report through an independent test before alerting the Board of
Supervisors or the public.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm concerned about it," Uffer said. "But before we report that
to the Board of Supervisors we want to independently verify that
number.... I want to make sure we have accuracy here before we go off
the deep end."</TE>
<TE>   The contamination makes Arrowhead the most direct and high-profile
victim to date of a widespread pollution problem that spilled over
last week, when members of a local pollution task force said a plume
of pollution in the Inland Empire could threaten water supplies and,
ultimately, future development.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental officials and members of Inland Empire Perchlorate
Task Force believe the pollution dates back to a series of
manufacturing operations in and around Rialto. Some of those
companies manufactured rockets, missiles and flares, and date back
decades to the Cold War. They were intentionally placed far from the
coast in case the United States came under attack from ships.</TE>
<TE>   The chairman of the task force also accused San Bernardino County
last week of exacerbating the problem by burying the site of the
pollution under 6 million cubic yards of soil while expanding its
landfill. The county denies that it is to blame for the problem.</TE>
<TE>   So far, 17 wells in San Bernardino County have been shut down
because of perchlorate pollution. In one case, 820 parts per billion
of perchlorate was found--more than 200 times the state's danger
threshold, officials said. In nearby communities, including Rialto
and Colton, some officials fear the state could step in and impose
building moratoriums in regions that don't have enough clean water to
support new development.</TE>
<TE>   Arrowhead Regional Medical Center opened in March 1999 as a
replacement for the aging San Bernardino Medical Center, and quickly
became one of the primary health care providers in the Inland Empire.
Its mandate includes serving the region's poor and uninsured, and
more than 5,000 people a month go to its emergency room.</TE>
<TE>   When it opened, Arrowhead was billed as a new sort of a
hospital--so user-friendly that its hallways were given street names
to simplify navigation, its staff was trained in a customer service
program known as "charm school," and its high-tech incubators were
designed to be quiet so they wouldn't wake the babies in the neonatal
intensive care unit.</TE>
<TE>   The medical center, which is in Colton, also built its own water
well, just blocks from some wells that have already been shut down.</TE>
<TE>   Officials and analysts were divided Monday over whether the
medical center should have disclosed the pollution.</TE>
<TE>   "They haven't told the public?" said state Sen. Nell Soto
(D-Ontario), one of the officials who have called for a broad
investigation into the pollution plume. "The public, by all means,
should know. Perhaps they are not taking it seriously. What are they
going to do for clean water?"</TE>
<TE>   But Dr. Mel Suffet, a professor in UCLA's environmental science
and engineering program, said perchlorate is more of a long-term
pollution problem than, for example, a biological organism that can
make people sick immediately by infiltrating drinking water. He said
perchlorate can cause cancer, but that it would take a minimum of 30
years of exposure before that happens. Even then, he said, the
chances are very small.</TE>
<TE>   "People do not stay in the hospital for 30 years. If they do,
there's something wrong with the hospital," Suffet said. "This is a
long-term issue. It's not a critical issue."</TE>
<TE>   Uffer agreed that even the levels of perchlorate detected in early
tests are fairly low. "When you get up to 300 or 400 parts per
billion, you have a real problem," he said. "This is a very low
number."</TE>
<TE>   But Barry Groveman, a Los Angeles attorney and chairman of the
Inland Empire Perchlorate Task Force, said the contamination is
another sign that San Bernardino County still doesn't know the extent
of the pollution problem.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a spreading cancer," he said. "The worst fear is not
knowing what's next. We're really worried about where this all ends."</TE>

<HD>Cameras, Audio Gear Banned From Runnion Kidnap Hearings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE HANLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Worried about tainting a jury, a judge Monday banned cameras and
audio equipment from recording pretrial hearings for the Lake
Elsinore man accused of kidnapping and killing 5-year-old Samantha
Runnion.</LD>
<LD>   In his ruling, Orange County Superior Court Judge Francisco P.
Briseno rejected arguments made by three attorneys representing The
Times and other newspapers and television stations.</LD>
<LD>   Briseno did not rule on whether cameras would be allowed during an
actual trial. The preliminary hearings, which both sides agreed to
begin Oct. 11, will determine whether there is a case against
Alejandro Avila.</LD>
<TE>   Avila, 27, has pleaded innocent to kidnapping, sexually assaulting
and killing Samantha. Prosecutors have said they will seek the death
penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Facing for the first time the man accused of killing her daughter,
Erin Runnion wept quietly throughout the proceedings. She and her
boyfriend, Ken Donnelly, were flanked by district attorney's
investigators in the front row. The couple did not speak to reporters
afterward.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas told the judge that the
prosecution had no objection to cameras in court but that Samantha's
family did.</TE>
<TE>   Avila's public defender, Denise Gragg, argued against having
cameras in court, citing death threats against Avila and her office.
She also said more publicity could taint a jury and turn the
proceedings "into the equivalent of 'The Jerry Springer Show.' "</TE>
<TE>   Jean-Paul Jassy, an attorney for The Times, the Orange County
Register and the Associated Press, argued that still cameras would
not be obtrusive or disruptive, and would give the public a window
into the proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not about 'The Jerry Springer Show' because Jerry
Springer invites discord," he said. "This court, of course, will not
be doing that. And this trial is of far more magnitude."</TE>
<TE>   Samantha was abducted July 15. Her body was found the next day
along a mountain road between Orange County and the Riverside County
community of Lake Elsinore. She was sexually assaulted and strangled.</TE>

<HD>Cameras Are Banned From Runnion Kidnap Hearings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE HANLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Worried about tainting a jury, a judge Monday banned cameras and
audio equipment from recording pretrial hearings for the Lake
Elsinore man accused of kidnapping and killing 5-year-old Samantha
Runnion.</LD>
<LD>   In his ruling, Orange County Superior Court Judge Francisco P.
Briseno rejected arguments made by three attorneys representing the
Los Angeles Times and other newspapers and television stations.</LD>
<LD>   Briseno did not rule on whether cameras would be allowed during an
actual trial. The preliminary hearings, which both sides agreed to
begin Oct. 11, will determine whether there is a case against
Alejandro Avila.</LD>
<TE>   Avila, 27, has pleaded innocent to kidnapping, sexually assaulting
and killing Samantha. Prosecutors have said they will seek the death
penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Facing for the first time the man accused of killing her daughter,
Erin Runnion wept quietly throughout the proceedings. She and her
boyfriend, Ken Donnelly, were flanked by district attorney's
investigators in the front row. The couple did not speak to reporters
afterward.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas told the judge that the
prosecution had no objection to cameras in court but that Samantha's
family did.</TE>
<TE>   Avila's public defender, Denise Gragg, argued against having
cameras in court, citing death threats against Avila and her office.
She also said more publicity could taint a jury and turn the
proceedings "into the equivalent of 'The Jerry Springer Show.' "</TE>
<TE>   Jean-Paul Jassy, an attorney for The Times, the Orange County
Register and the Associated Press, argued that still cameras would
not be obtrusive or disruptive, and would give the public a window
into the proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not about 'The Jerry Springer Show' because Jerry
Springer invites discord," he said. "This court, of course, will not
be doing that. And this trial is of far more magnitude."</TE>
<TE>   Samantha was abducted July 15 as she played with a friend near a
row of garages at her Stanton condominium complex. Her body was found
the next day along a mountain road between Orange County and the
Riverside County community of Lake Elsinore. She was sexually
assaulted and strangled.</TE>
<TE>   Documents supporting the search of Avila's apartment and his
subsequent arrest remain sealed. But a probable cause statement
obtained Monday confirms reports that he was arrested based on
circumstantial evidence. Among the reasons cited by investigators
were that he had ties to the Stanton area and the remote highway
where the body was found, and that he and his car matched
descriptions given by Samantha's playmate.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators also determined after hours of interrogating Avila
that he had no alibi and had lied to them, according to the
statement. They suggested that preliminary analysis of DNA recovered
at the scene would further implicate Avila, the record shows.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Avila could not be accounted for during the time of Samantha
Runnion's abduction and drives a vehicle similar and [the] same color
as [witnesses] observed. Mr. Avila also matches the composite drawing
made by witness," investigator Gary Jones wrote in the statement.</TE>
<TE>   "Through mounting evidence and statements made by witnesses, after
interviewing Mr. Avila and determining that initial statements made
by Avila to be nontruths, investigators believe that the trace
evidence and DNA currently being worked by the Orange County
sheriff's crime lab will prove Mr. Avila's involvements with the
abduction and subsequent death of Samantha Runnion."</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement sources have told The Times that cell phone
records contradicted Avila's alibi that he was shopping at the
Ontario Mills Mall during Samantha's kidnapping.</TE>

<HD>'Aztec Warrior' Born as Unofficial Mascot for San Diego
State</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Proving that it is difficult to keep a venerable mascot down, the
Aztec Warrior has emerged as the unofficial replacement for Monty
Montezuma, who was banished from San Diego State athletic contests.</LD>
<LD>   Monty was eliminated as culturally retrograde by the university
president last year after two years of controversy. But that didn't
satisfy many university alumni and fans, who wanted to preserve
decades of San Diego State tradition.</LD>
<LD>   Now they've brought back their own version of the Monty character.
The Aztec Warrior--looking a lot like Monty and even played by a
former Monty performer--showed up at Saturday's football game at
Qualcomm Stadium. The appearance drew roars of approval from some in
the crowd.</LD>
<TE>   But Native Americans who had protested the original mascot as
insensitive complained that the new version is just as bad.</TE>
<TE>   Because he is not the university's official mascot, the Aztec
Warrior will not be allowed on the field. At Saturday's game against
Arizona State University, he could only roam the stands.</TE>
<TE>   The warrior's presence may have heartened some fans, but that was
not enough to prop up the Aztecs, who blew a 22-0 halftime lead and
lost, 39-28. The team dropped to 0-3 for the season.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, a group of business owners, backed by a county
supervisor, acknowledged that they had been secretly planning for
several months to bring back the feathered warrior, but simply under
a new name and with a slightly different look.</TE>
<TE>   Aztec Warrior was kept under wraps to prevent any attempt by the
university administration to squelch the movement, said Bruce
Johnson, a San Diego sports marketing specialist and president of the
newly formed Aztec Warrior Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   "The warrior does not mock, he is not shameful, and he shouldn't
be hidden away in a closet somewhere," said county Supervisor Dianne
Jacob, a San Diego State graduate.</TE>
<TE>   The nonprofit foundation is seeking donations to support Aztec
Warrior and to provide scholarships for Latino students who believe
they are descended from the Aztecs, a native people of Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Naddia Cherre, chairwoman of the San Diego State chapter of MEChA,
a Latino student organization, said the group is disappointed that
the alumni would try to bring back Monty Montezuma in another guise.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that the booster group has promised to award scholarships
does not change her group's opposition, Cherre said. "They're just
trying to shut us up," she said. "They're degrading our culture and
then throwing some crumbs at us. It's very wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Qualcomm Stadium manager Bill Wilson said he sees no problem with
Aztec Warrior exhorting fans from the stands.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see any safety problems at all," he said. "The fans
absolutely loved him. He can come back any time."</TE>
<TE>   To the dismay of some alumni and students, university President
Stephen Weber last year decided to end the Monty Montezuma tradition
in response to concerns by Native American activists that the
character was historically inaccurate and culturally insensitive.</TE>
<TE>   Monty, meant to represent the 16th century Aztec ruler, had served
as the school's athletic mascot since the 1940s.</TE>
<TE>   Weber had hoped to find an official replacement for Monty, but
that effort crashed amid the same questions about culture and history
that dogged Monty. In July, Weber announced that his New Mascot
Committee had been suspended indefinitely.</TE>
<TE>   As the first Aztec Warrior, the foundation has hired Carlos
Gutierrez, a performer who also is a radio station account executive.</TE>
<TE>   He played the Monty character from 1991 to 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "We are Aztec warriors," Gutierrez said. "We shall stand tall and
breathe deep for what we believe in."</TE>
<TE>   Weber, through a spokesman, said, "Carlos is welcome to attend the
game like any fan, as long as he behaves himself."</TE>

<HD>The Music's Over at the Ban-Dar</HD>
<DH>Ventura: Former employees and customers gather to share
personal histories as a favorite old nightclub comes down.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was last call at the Ban-Dar.</LD>
<LD>   Former dancers, musicians, barkeeps and barflies showed up Monday
to watch a demolition crew reduce the storied Main Street honky-tonk
to a heap of rubble.</LD>
<LD>   Originally a big-band dance club when it opened over 70 years ago
in Ventura, the Ban-Dar got its name from the founders, named
Bannister and Darwin.</LD>
<TE>   "It's history gone," said Marilyn Pratley, a waitress and
bartender at the club in the 1960s and '70s who went by the nickname
"Mother."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not taking pictures today because I have memories of this
club in my mind," Pratley said.</TE>
<TE>   The Ban-Dar, which featured maroon fins and neon stars on its
exterior, was a prime example of the '60s Space Age architecture
known as Googie. But the building had fallen into disrepair over the
years and was in need of costly improvements.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was from an era gone by," Ventura City Councilman Jim
Monahan said. "It's been a fun place to go over the years, and many
famous people performed there. But the building was so far out of
code that it would have been unreasonably expensive to build it up to
code. Termite repair would have taken out half the building."</TE>
<TE>   Landowner Ken Luper, who bought the old club near the renovated
Pacific View Mall in the spring, has not said what will replace it.
He could not be reached for comment Monday.</TE>
<TE>   At one time, the club was considered a premier entertainment venue
in the county, offering everything from country and western to soul
music. In the 1960s and '70s, country legends Johnny Cash, Willie
Nelson and Merle Haggard could occasionally be found at the bar or
sitting in with the house band.</TE>
<TE>   Gladys Knight and the Pips performed there, as did Little Richard
and the Platters. In the early '70s, comedian Richard Pryor was known
to try out new material at the Ban-Dar before taking his show on the
road. After performing, Pryor would invite a select few back to his
limousine to continue the party.</TE>
<TE>   John Trueblood was often one of the invitees. A drummer for a
house band at the club in the mid-'60s, Trueblood got to know Pryor
and dozens of other famous entertainers who liked the club's
neighborly feel and proximity to celebrity hideaways in Malibu, Ojai
and Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   "There were always girls here and a lot of musicians," said
Trueblood, 61, a local antique store owner who witnessed Monday's
demolition. "This place was a big part of my life."</TE>
<TE>   As they watched a crane operator drop chunks of their old
nightspot into a large dump truck, just about all of the dozen or so
who turned out for the demolition had a story.</TE>
<TE>   There was the time a bar patron was standing at a urinal when a
Cadillac crashed through the wall. Or the time when an argument
between two regulars spilled out into the front sidewalk and one of
the two ended up dead.</TE>
<TE>   Others remembered the Stardust Motel, which was essentially a
small shack tucked behind the club that served as the home for
Ban-Dar employees and musicians and gained the nickname "Heartbreak
Hotel."</TE>
<TE>   But mostly, stories flowed about friendships forged over live
music, scantily clad dancers and a rowdy dance floor.</TE>
<TE>   Kay Monahan, a 61-year-old former go-go dancer at the club who was
also a single mother at the time, said her friends at the Ban-Dar
were the closest thing to a family she had after moving from Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just so sad because this is history, and some of the best
people I know I met here," said Monahan, who accepted her future
husband's wedding proposal at the club on New Year's Eve 1968. She is
not related to the councilman. "Now this town is being destroyed by
investors. There's nothing old left."</TE>

<HD>Bishops Conspired, Says Abuse Plaintiff</HD>
<DH>Courts: Alleged victim charges U.S. Catholic leaders with
protecting pedophile priests.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In one of the first legal attacks on the nation's Roman Catholic
leadership, an alleged molestation victim has filed suit contending
that bishops conspired over the past 30 years to protect priests who
sexually abused children to "avoid detection, public disclosure and
scandal."</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit filed Monday in Orange County Superior Court alleges
that the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops even conducted seminars
to show bishops and dioceses how to discourage and discredit claims
of child sexual molestation, how to conceal or "sanitize" damaging
records of accused molesters, and how to quietly transfer the
suspected molesters without raising suspicion among congregants.</LD>
<LD>   Some experts say the suit is an innovative legal strategy to hold
U.S. bishops accountable for a national wave of molestation cases
involving priests that has tarnished the reputation of the church
over the past year. Others call it a legal grandstanding ploy with no
credibility.</LD>
<TE>   "This is an inevitable and logical conclusion to all that has been
revealed in the past year," said Richard Sipe, a former priest and
national authority on sexual abuse of minors in the Catholic Church
who has testified for the plaintiffs in many molestation cases.
"There is good evidence that the bishops conference has been aware of
and consulted on sexual abuse issues."</TE>
<TE>   An attorney for the bishops conference called the suit
"frivolous," saying that the national association of bishops never
engaged in the kind of tactics alleged.</TE>
<TE>   And, as a point of law, the conference, which functions roughly
like a professional association for bishops, has no authority to
enforce its policies and guidelines in the nation's 165 autonomous
dioceses, said Mark E. Chopko, general counsel for the conference. He
said the conference has been named only once before in a sexual abuse
suit, and eventually was dropped as a defendant.</TE>
<TE>   "The premise that we're somehow involved is completely wrong as a
matter of law, a matter of fact, and a matter of equity," Chopko said
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Also named in the suit filed by David Price are the Los Angeles
and Orange dioceses and a Maryland treatment center for clerics.</TE>
<TE>   Price, 37, alleges that he was molested as a teenager by Msgr.
Michael Harris, his principal at Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana,
over a five-year period ending in 1983. The dioceses of Los Angeles
and Orange paid $5.2 million last year to settle molestation
allegations by another plaintiff against Harris. The former priest
has denied all allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Price originally filed suit in 1994, alleging that Harris molested
him. A Superior Court judge rejected that case, saying the statute of
limitations had expired. In the latest suit, the former Orange County
resident has alleged he dropped an appeal of his original case when
diocesan attorneys used the threat of $32,000 in legal bills to
persuade him to sign a release agreeing to drop the suit.</TE>
<TE>   Price now is charging the Diocese of Orange with fraud, saying
church attorneys called his first case against Harris "unmeritorious"
even though diocesan leaders already had reviewed a damning report on
the monsignor's alleged sexual misconduct from the St. Luke Institute
in Maryland, a treatment center to which Harris had been sent for a
five-day evaluation in early 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Price also contends that church officials knew of others who had
come forward with sexual abuse allegations against Harris.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for the Diocese of Orange said she hadn't seen the
suit and couldn't comment. A St. Luke Institute official said Father
Stephen J. Rossetti, its president, was out of town Monday and no one
else was available to comment.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1990s, Dallas attorney Sylvia M. Demarest sued the
nation's bishops as part of a church molestation case that resulted
in a $120-million jury verdict, which eventually was settled for $23
million.</TE>
<TE>   On the eve of oral arguments in 1996 before the Texas Supreme
Court, Demarest withdrew the charges against the bishops conference,
writing that while she believed the bishops were culpable, "such
claims of institutional negligence have been seriously compromised"
by recent Texas Supreme Court opinions.</TE>
<TE>   "My theory at the time was there was a conspiracy that included
every bishop in the United States," Demarest said in an interview
Monday. "The sexual abuse would be concealed, priests would remain in
ministry, no one would know. Everything I alleged turned out to be
true this year."</TE>
<TE>   Demarest said Price's attorney, John Manly of Costa Mesa, might
have better luck because of a meeting of the bishops conference in
June, when prelates hammered out a new, high-profile sexual abuse
policy that called for zero-tolerance for priests who molest minors.</TE>
<TE>   At the meeting in Dallas, several high-ranking bishops conceded
they should have done more to investigate claims and to protect
children.</TE>
<TE>   The issue to be decided is whether the sweeping policy set in
Dallas translates into new authority for the conference on matters of
sexual abuse or whether the procedures were merely suggestions that
can be used or ignored by the dioceses.</TE>
<TE>   "By exercising control, they deny they have no control," Demarest
said.</TE>
<TE>   When Manly was told that the bishops' attorney said the conference
had no control over the dioceses, he replied, "Gee, who were those
fellows in Dallas? Their actions speak for themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Father Thomas J. Reese, editor of America, a Catholic weekly
magazine, has closely followed the sex scandal and said he doubts
that the bishops conference will remain a defendant.</TE>
<TE>   "[The conference] has never been successfully sued because each
diocese is autonomous in its legal and financial operations and has
responsibility for its priests and employees," Reese said.</TE>
<TE>   "As for accusing bishops of orchestrating a conspiracy, I don't
think they're that smart or coordinated to do that."</TE>

<HD>Governor Signs 2 Bills Easing Water Transfer</HD>
<DH>Wildlife: The legislation addresses the impact on the
Salton Sea of a proposed diversion of water from Imperial Valley
farmlands to San Diego.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>With Southern California's water supply from the Colorado River at
stake, Gov. Gray Davis signed two bills Monday intended to ease the
transfer of water from Imperial Valley farmers to San Diego.</LD>
<LD>   Both bills deal with the fish and bird life of the Salton Sea, an
accidental lake formed by a canal break in 1905 that has become an
obstacle to a proposed shift of water from farms to coastal city
dwellers.</LD>
<LD>   Water drained from Imperial Valley farms flows to the Salton Sea,
which straddles Imperial and Riverside counties. If farmers use less
water on their crops and instead send it by canal to San Diego, the
Salton Sea could eventually become too salty--it now is 25% saltier
than the ocean--to keep alive the fish that draw millions of
pelicans, geese and other waterfowl.</LD>
<TE>   Davis signed SB 482 by Sen. Sheila Kuehl (D-Santa Monica) to allow
for the incidental killing of four species that could be affected by
a water transfer. Those species--the desert pupfish, brown pelican
and two varieties of marsh-dwelling birds called rails--had been on
the state's "fully protected" list, which dates to the 1920s and
forbids any harm to them.</TE>
<TE>   Under Kuehl's bill, the four species would instead be covered by
the state's Endangered Species Act, which allows for some harm to the
fish and birds so long as measures are taken to more than offset the
damage.</TE>
<TE>   Davis also signed SB 1473 by Sen. Mike Machado (D-Linden), which
would earmark $150 million for the Salton Sea from Proposition 50,
the $3.4-billion water bond on the November ballot. If voters pass
the bond, the money must be used for a desalination, conservation or
other project that creates new water to offset some of the farm
runoff that won't go to the 375-square-mile Salton Sea as a result of
the water transfer.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers and Davis administration officials heralded both bills
as a sign of their strong intention to make a water transfer work.</TE>
<TE>   The transfer is less important at the moment for the water it
could provide to San Diego than it is as evidence for the federal
government that California will keep its promise to scale back use of
the Colorado River.</TE>
<TE>   In many years, California has used about 800,000 acre-feet--enough
to supply 1.6 million homes--more than it is entitled to take under a
1922 agreement among the seven states along the Colorado River.</TE>
<TE>   California agreed in 1999 to limit itself to 4.4 million acre-feet
within 15 years. A key part of that plan is to have the Imperial
Irrigation District, which gets 70% of California's Colorado River
share, cut its consumption by hundreds of thousands of acre-feet and
sell the water to other Southern California agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Under the plan, California agreed to achieve certain milestones by
the end of this year or risk being cut off from surplus supplies by
the federal government, which manages the river's reservoirs.</TE>
<TE>   For the last few months, Assemblyman Bob Hertzberg (D-Van Nuys)
has brokered meetings among the Imperial Irrigation District, San
Diego County Water Agency, Metropolitan Water District of Southern
California and other parties to cut a deal before the Dec. 31
deadline.</TE>

<HD>Jurors Recommend Death for Westerfield</HD>
<DH>Trial: Danielle van Dam's killer shows no emotion. Judge
will accept or reject decision Nov. 22.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>After five days of deliberations, a jury recommended Monday that
David Westerfield be executed for kidnapping and murdering 7-year-old
Danielle van Dam, whose disappearance in February turned out to be
the first in a string of high-profile child abductions this year.</LD>
<LD>   Westerfield, 50, a self-employed design engineer, showed no
emotion as the verdict was read. One of his lawyers leaned over and
told him, "I'm so sorry."</LD>
<LD>   Danielle's mother, Brenda, cried, and the girl's father, Damon,
shut his eyes. The couple left the courthouse without talking to
reporters.</LD>
<TE>   Superior Court Judge William Mudd set Nov. 22 to announce whether
he will accept the jury's recommendation or reduce Westerfield's
sentence to life in prison without parole. Only one death penalty in
10 San Diego cases has been reduced to a life sentence in the last
eight years.</TE>
<TE>   Two male jurors, who would not give their full names, told
reporters that the most damning piece of evidence against Westerfield
was the discovery of Danielle's blood on his jacket. The same jury on
Aug. 21 found him guilty of murder, kidnapping and possession of
child pornography but were forbidden from discussing the case until
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   They said the horrific nature of the killing convinced them to
recommend the death penalty, despite pleas from Westerfield's
children, friends and co-workers to spare him.</TE>
<TE>   The two jurors said revelations about the Van Dams' marijuana use
and extramarital sex, raised by Westerfield's attorneys, were
considered irrelevant by the panel.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't understand why it was brought out," said one juror. "It
didn't have anything to do with the disappearance and death of a
little girl. It was their choice. They're adults. It was kind of
silly to bring that up."</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys had attempted to persuade jurors that the "sex,
drugs and rock 'n' roll" lifestyle of Danielle's parents left her
vulnerable to attack. The kidnapper, they argued, might have been
someone who came to the home for sex or illegal drugs.</TE>
<TE>   In his closing argument, lead defense attorney Steven Feldman had
begged jurors not to hold his abrasive personality or controversial
tactics against his client.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we put a lot of weight on Feldman and his
likability," said a second juror. "We really focused on what came out
in court--the evidence."</TE>
<TE>   Feldman, in limiting his comments, told reporters, "We will not
appeal this case on the streets of San Diego through the media." By
state law, the case will automatically be appealed.</TE>
<TE>   Feldman had argued during the penalty phase of the trial that
Westerfield was not the "worst of the worst" and did not deserve to
be executed.</TE>
<TE>   "Tragically, two killings will never justify one," Feldman said
after the jury was dismissed. "This is America. We are alienating
ourselves from the [international] community through the imposition
of the death penalty."</TE>
<TE>   San Diego County Dist. Atty. Paul Pfingst praised the jury for
agreeing with his trial prosecutors--Jeff Dusek and George "Woody"
Clarke--that Westerfield should be executed.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, justice was done for Danielle van Dam, justice was done
for her family," Pfingst said. "No greater harm can be done to a
community than to have a child stolen from the safety her own
bedroom, abused and murdered."</TE>
<TE>   The two jurors who spoke to reporters said the jury was chastened
by the gravity of recommending that Westerfield be killed.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a group effort," said one juror. "Everybody struggled with
the decision."</TE>
<TE>   The other juror added, "Everybody had to come to peace with that
decision: Everybody had to go through that step that, 'Holy cow, this
is real.' ''</TE>
<TE>   In the upscale Sabre Springs neighborhood where Westerfield and
the Van Dams were neighbors, residents reacted with relief. Neighbors
willing to speak to reporters said they agreed with the death penalty
recommendation.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew he did it," Buddy Sabalaon said. "We feel a lot safer."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm happy," said Jojo Trine, who lives across the street from the
house where Westerfield lived. "That's exactly right."</TE>
<TE>   There were indications that at least one juror held out until the
final moment. At midmorning, the jury foreman sent Mudd a note saying
that the jury was deadlocked. But when court convened in the early
afternoon, the jury handed Mudd a unanimous decision.</TE>
<TE>   The recommendation is consistent with other San Diego juries in
past years involving the murder of children. In the last eight years,
prosecutors have asked for and received the death penalty in four
such cases. The Westerfield case is the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Police Chief David Bejarano issued a prepared statement saying
that he "hopes that it [the verdict] brings some closure to the Van
Dam family."</TE>
<TE>   Deluged with requests for interviews, the Van Dams, through a
spokeswoman, said they will speak Tuesday at a grassy park in the La
Jolla Shores section of San Diego. It was the site of a memorial
service for Danielle after her body was discovered.</TE>
<TE>   Danielle's disappearance, the frantic 25-day search and the
eventual discovery of her body Feb. 27 riveted much of the nation.</TE>
<TE>   The slaying preceded other high-profile abductions this year,
including those of Elizabeth Smart in Utah, Samantha Runnion in
Orange County and Cassandra Williamson in Missouri. Samantha and
Cassandra were killed; Elizabeth remains missing.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush mentioned Danielle and Samantha last month in a
speech announcing a Sept. 24 conference to find ways to stem "a wave
of horrible violence" against children.</TE>
<TE>   Samantha, 7, was kidnapped from outside her Orange County home and
killed. "The kidnapping or murder of a child is every parent's worst
nightmare," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   After 10 days of deliberation, the jury on Aug. 21 convicted
Westerfield on evidence linking him to the abduction and murder.</TE>
<TE>   Danielle's blood was found in his recreational vehicle and on his
jacket. Her hair was found in the RV and the bedroom of his home, and
fibers found on her body were identical to fibers found at the home.</TE>
<TE>   Danielle disappeared from her bedroom Feb. 2.</TE>
<TE>   Westerfield, who lived two doors from the Van Dam family, had come
under suspicion almost immediately because as other neighbors sought
to help in the search, he took his recreational vehicle on a trip to
the beach and desert.</TE>
<TE>   Danielle's nude body was found along a rural road that he could
have used to travel between the desert and the beach.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors alleged during the trial that Westerfield tried
desperately to clean up "his evil, evil crime" by scouring his home
and RV with bleach and taking bedding and clothing to the dry
cleaners after returning from his weekend trip.</TE>
<TE>   Days before the abduction, Westerfield had bought Girl Scout
cookies from Danielle. On the Friday night of Feb. 1, the
twice-divorced Westerfield bought drinks for Brenda van Dam and two
of her girlfriends at a bar where they had gone for a night of
drinking, dancing, smoking marijuana and shooting pool.</TE>
<TE>   Just what moved Westerfield to leave the bar, go to the Van Dam
home and kidnap Danielle may never be known. He did not testify.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors believe that Westerfield entered the home as Damon van
Dam, Danielle and her two brothers slept. He also may have been in
Danielle's bedroom when Brenda and her friends returned from the bar
about 2 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Westerfield made a fatal mistake thinking that he could talk his
way out of trouble with police, prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   Telling him they only wanted to talk to him briefly so that they
could clear him and move on with the case, police persuaded
Westerfield to be interviewed Feb. 5.</TE>
<TE>   Westerfield's interview with a police interrogator was played for
jurors during the trial and penalty deliberations.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Dusek noted the inconsistencies in
Westerfield's description of his movements. He also used the word
"we" to describe his trip to the desert although he insisted that he
was alone in his 30-foot recreational vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   A tow-truck driver who helped pull the RV from the sand of
Imperial County on Feb. 3 thought he heard a voice from inside the
vehicle, suggesting that Danielle was still alive.</TE>
<TE>   The medical examiner testified that he was unable to pinpoint
either the time or cause of Danielle's death.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors alleged that she was alive when Westerfield took her
from her home and remained alive for several hours, at least until
Westerfield put her into the recreational vehicle. He then dumped her
body "like trash" along a rural road either the night of Feb. 2 or on
Feb. 3, Dusek said.</TE>
<TE>   In the penalty phase, Dusek theorized that Westerfield molested
Danielle, although there was no forensic evidence to support that
contention.</TE>
<TE>   Dusek said Westerfield's pornography showed that he harbored
fantasies about young girls. He kept binoculars in an upstairs
bathroom that would let him spy on Danielle in her backyard, Dusek
said.</TE>
<TE>   Westerfield is expected to be housed on Death Row at San Quentin
prison. California has 610 prisoners awaiting execution.</TE>

<DH>Some prize the blue gum eucalyptus for its beauty and
scent, while others see a messy fire hazard. Battles are being waged
across California.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC BAILEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SANTA CRUZ</DL>
<LD>To Robert Sward, the blue gum eucalyptus trees standing by his back
fence resemble a leafy gang of thugs, menacing and ready to strike.</LD>
<LD>   Sward and his wife, Gloria Alford, hate them. They worry that one
of the big, bark-shedding trees might snap and flatten their home, or
that a spark from a neighbor's barbecue could turn the naturally oily
foliage into an inferno.</LD>
<LD>   After a decade of unsuccessfully fighting City Hall for permission
to ax his grove, Sward--a poet, retired college professor and avowed
environmentalist--resorted to a botanical form of civil disobedience.
He hired a tree cutter to take them out.</LD>
<TE>   Scarcely had the buzz of the chain saw kicked up when city parks
inspectors--"tree police," as some locals call them--stepped in,
halted the cutting and hit Sward with fines initially totaling
$5,000.</TE>
<TE>   Welcome to California's eucalyptus wars.</TE>
<TE>   From the dense groves that step up from San Francisco Bay to San
Diego's leafy canyons, the fate of Eucalyptus globulus is
increasingly at the center of impassioned debate.</TE>
<TE>   In its native Australia, the tree is routinely branded a fire
hazard and has been dubbed "the widow maker" for its propensity to
drop lethal limbs unannounced.</TE>
<TE>   But in the Golden State, it has earned a resolute constituency.
Eucalyptus aficionados prize the trees' leggy beauty, their soothing
medicinal scent, the homey roost they provide monarch butterflies.
They've fought hard to protect the grand forests that have added a
dash of greenery to California's bleached coastal scrublands in the
150 years since the species arrived on U.S. shores.</TE>
<TE>   In Carlsbad, a civic referendum once halted plans to cut 53 acres
of eucalyptuses. Civic protest also stopped a move to fell trees on
San Francisco's Nob Hill. When the ax came out in a Dana Point
subdivision because of liability fears, outraged residents protested
in the streets and won a court reprieve for surviving trees. Removal
of a thicket in the funky Bay Area enclave of Bolinas was abandoned
after foes compared it to genocide and labeled logging advocates
"plant Nazis." Eucalyptus aficionados howled recently when a big,
rancho-era tree was felled in favor of a parking lot at the new
Westside office of famed architect Frank O. Gehry.</TE>
<TE>   "A tree is a living being, and every one is valuable," summed up
Celia Scott, an environmental lawyer and former Santa Cruz
councilwoman whose home is nestled happily among eucalyptuses. "I
don't see any reason to discriminate or live in fear of them."</TE>
<TE>   But the rangy tree stirring such deep-rooted support has an
equally vocal band of critics. Though the eucalyptus family has about
600 species, the blue gum is the shaggy bad boy of the bunch.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'Gasoline Tree'</TE>
<TE>   Some firefighters call it the "gasoline tree" for the way the blue
gum ignites like a bomb upon the approach of flames. The trees, which
under ideal conditions can reach 200 feet tall, are cited as one of
the culprits in the devastating 1991 Oakland Hills blaze.</TE>
<TE>   Botanists say the blue gum's speedy growth and profuse bark and
leaf litter can smother native species such as coast live oak, wax
myrtle and bunch grass. In the cool, muffled beauty of a eucalyptus
grove, some ornithologists contend, coastal songbirds can meet their
deaths, their airways plugged by the tree's gummy resin.</TE>
<TE>   A recent Audubon magazine article ridiculed the blue gum, the
dominant species in parts of California, as the nation's largest
weed.</TE>
<TE>   "They should all go," groused Sward, an otherwise egalitarian man.
"They're like a contagion."</TE>
<TE>   A native of Chicago, a Guggenheim fellow and the author of several
books of plain-spoken poetry, Sward moved to Santa Cruz for its
laid-back ways, hip politics and natural beauty. Eucalyptuses are a
big part of that scenic charm, commanding huge swaths of the canyons
that carve the seaside town.</TE>
<TE>   Sward landed right in a thicket of the trees, chubby 100-footers
that hug two edges of the wood-sided house designed by his wife,
artist Gloria Alford.</TE>
<TE>   But what the eucalyptus offers in beauty from afar, it takes back
up close, Sward discovered. Few other plants would grow beneath the
trees' fragrant umbrellas, and the shedding bark and leaves were a
constant maintenance headache.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, he pleaded with the city for permission to have
them removed. Always, his efforts were blocked by Santa Cruz's tough
Heritage Tree Ordinance, which prohibits toppling any big tree unless
there's a really good reason--like unfettered disease, a threat of
imminent property damage or injury.</TE>
<TE>   Sward contends he is under imminent threat, and cites as evidence
his wife's near death-by-eucalyptus episode.</TE>
<TE>   During a fierce storm in March 1996, one of several eucalyptuses
on a neighboring parcel nearly took out a Pacific Gas &amp; Electric
substation. Alford went outside to inspect. As she gazed into the
churning sea of wind-whipped foliage, a nearby PG&amp;E worker called out
a warning.</TE>
<TE>   Alford remembers taking a few steps backward just as the swollen
green-gray mass of another blue gum eucalyptus slammed to the ground
nearby.</TE>
<TE>   In its descent, the tree took out electrical lines on both sides
of the street and snapped a telephone pole like a toothpick. The
local newspaper put this near-miss story on its front page.</TE>
<TE>   Alford was left with a fright that remains to this day.</TE>
<TE>   "When the wind blows, you hear that awful creaking," Alford said,
voice shuddering. On those nights, the couple retreat from their
bedroom to sleep at the far side of the house, away from the groaning
trees.</TE>
<TE>   After his wife's experience, Sward launched a crusade against the
eucalyptus.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gold Rush-Era Roots</TE>
<TE>   He began by boning up on his foe. Sward learned that the tree's
domestic roots date to the Gold Rush era; by most accounts, San
Francisco nurseryman W.C. Walker propagated the first seeds in 1853.</TE>
<TE>   In the years since, blue gum eucalyptus has been eyed as
quick-strike treasure by a long parade of California schemers.
Eucalyptus was to be a medicinal cure for all kinds of ailments, the
abundant replacement for vanishing hardwoods, rough-sawed framing
lumber and railroad ties.</TE>
<TE>   But the state's young trees, denied the century of growth needed
to achieve the density of Australia's venerable eucalyptuses, proved
to be under-performers. Railroad ties wouldn't hold a spike. Lumber
cracked. Cure-alls succumbed to reality. Even its most common use--as
firewood--was scuttled by the advent of electric and natural gas
heaters.</TE>
<TE>   Still, vast eucalyptus groves remained, gaining fame as subjects
for a whole genre of California art, becoming parks and sanctuaries
for road-weary travelers, providing windbreaks for citrus orchards
and Central Valley highways.</TE>
<TE>   In the right places, away from homes and buildings, that's fine,
arborists say. But in several parts of the state, aggressive efforts
are underway to clear out trees where mankind has crept close, pests
have interfered or native plants are threatened.</TE>
<TE>   On Angel Island in the middle of San Francisco Bay, parks
officials overcame significant opposition to take out stands of
eucalyptuses and replant with native trees. Across the bay, a fight
is being waged over logging 4,000 trees--mostly eucalyptuses--at San
Francisco's Presidio, a former military installation.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles faces the costly task of removing 20,000 pest-infested
eucalyptus trees in parks, said Eric Oldar, a state urban forester in
Southern California. In San Diego County, some insurance companies
have refused to renew policies for homes near fire-hazard groves,
Oldar said. "Eucalyptus is about as explosive a tree as there is," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Globally, the eucalyptus is still seen as a cash crop, albeit a
controversial one. In China, where eucalyptus plantations are
producing biomass fuel and pulp for paper, some complain that the
trees rob soil of nutrients and push back natural vegetation. During
the early 1990s, farmers in Spain and Portugal uprooted eucalyptus
seedlings and battled police over such industrial forests.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Sward's fight in Santa Cruz was not nearly so grand. He
simply wanted to remove eight blue gum eucalyptuses. When his appeals
went nowhere, Sward turned to his pen.</TE>
<TE>   In tough-worded newspaper opinion pieces and on a Web site
otherwise devoted to his poetry, Sward called the Santa Cruz tree
ordinance an "unreasonable use of police power" and warned of a "blue
gum apocalypse."</TE>
<TE>   These days, a tree more than 14 inches in diameter is considered
of heritage stature in Santa Cruz. A healthy blue gum can achieve
that size in less than a decade.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, saving such trees in Santa Cruz "has become a religious
crusade, a matter not of reason, but of faith," said Gerald Bowden,
an attorney who helped craft the heritage tree law two decades ago.
Though intended to preserve a few big native trees, the law has been
twisted, Bowden said. Nowadays, "Anyone who wants to cut a tree of
any size is regarded as a philistine."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Blue Gum's Advocate</TE>
<TE>   More often than not, he said, Gillian Greensite is the preacher in
that pulpit.</TE>
<TE>   A native of Australia who has resided in Santa Cruz for a quarter
of a century, Greensite has scored several victories, most notably
halting a housing tract that Alford's ex-husband planned a decade ago
in a thick eucalyptus forest next to the house where Alford and Sward
now live.</TE>
<TE>   Sward, Greensite contends, is spreading "ignorance and
misinformation" about the eucalyptus.</TE>
<TE>   She calls the notion of songbird deaths absurd and notes that
hawks and herons roost in eucalyptuses. The blue gum's role in the
Oakland Hills fire has been overstated, Greensite says. Wood roofs
and thick brush were the real problems, she says. The coast's native
oaks were eliminated by dairy farmers, she contends, not by any
spreading scourge of eucalyptuses.</TE>
<TE>   Greensite believes the tree has been turned into a scapegoat. The
city's tree ordinance has hardly helped, she insists. Over the last
five years, only 150 of 2,500 eucalyptuses and other big trees have
won stays of execution.</TE>
<TE>   As for Sward, Greensite said, "I don't understand his pathological
fear of a species he has chosen to live under."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Chain-Saw Solution</TE>
<TE>   Sward says his worries crested during a windstorm in mid-May. Like
divine intervention, a roustabout tree cutter knocked on his door
looking for work. Sward hired him on the spot, eager to eliminate
what he calls "a clear and present danger."</TE>
<TE>   Two big blue gums and a few saplings had been felled when city
inspectors--alerted by an irate neighbor--halted the cutting. The
city, Sward said, "threw the book at me."</TE>
<TE>   Although his original $5,000 fine was reduced to $500, there's a
catch: Sward must hire a registered arborist and plant native
replacement trees to make up for what was cut. It will cost at least
$7,000 to do that, Sward figures, though he is still negotiating.</TE>
<TE>   Leslie Keedy, Santa Cruz's tree chief, said Sward's surviving
eucalyptuses don't represent a threat. They're plenty healthy, but
could use a good pruning, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "He needs to work in the process, and he knows what the process
is," she added.</TE>
<TE>   Although a city task force recently considered ending heritage
protection for blue gums and a few other nonnative trees, the
proposal is tied up in politics. For now, Keedy said, the chance of
Sward being allowed to cut down the rest of his eucalyptuses is next
to zero.</TE>
<TE>   All of which has Santa Cruz's tree-killing poet bewildered.</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't see the sense of it: These are his trees. This is his
danger.</TE>
<TE>   "There are people in Santa Cruz," Sward said, "who believe the
blue gum eucalyptus is more important than human life."</TE>

<HD>Van Nuys Flyaway Parking to Be Halved During Expansion
Project</HD>
<DH>Services: Yearlong construction will be especially hard on
LAX workers who commute.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAITLIN LIU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The upcoming construction of a larger Van Nuys Flyaway parking
facility will cause a temporary reduction in the number of available
spaces for workers and travelers headed for Los Angeles International
Airport, officials say.</LD>
<LD>   The park-and-ride lot, which has about 2,000 long-term parking
spaces, will be cut back to 841 for more than a year after
construction begins in November, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Although plans for the $42-million construction project by Los
Angeles World Airports, which operates LAX as well as Van Nuys
Airport, calls for a total of nearly 3,000 spaces by December 2003,
many commuters are not happy.</LD>
<TE>   "Everybody's pretty upset," said Steve Purvis of Chatsworth, a
senior customer relations officer for Qantas Airways. "People have
been talking about switching jobs."</TE>
<TE>   Currently, the lot has 100 spaces set aside for people who work at
LAX, who comprise about 9% of the lot's 900,000 annual passenger
trips, said Stacy Geere, a spokeswoman for Van Nuys Airport. About
700 people who work at LAX have paid for a $10 annual pass for
parking in those employee-only spaces, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Starting in mid-October, those spaces will be displaced to make
way for construction, during which employees can pay $4 a day if they
want to park in the public lot, Geere said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials are not yet certain what they will do about employee
parking in the future.</TE>
<TE>   "It shows a complete lack of regard for the employees," said John
Aaron, a Continental Airlines baggage worker who has used the Flyaway
for 23 years.</TE>
<TE>   He estimated that the airport's new policy could cost workers
hundreds of dollars a year in extra parking fees, which many could
not afford.</TE>
<TE>   The Flyaway, which is next to Van Nuys Airport, currently offers
seven-days-a-week, 24-hours-a-day bus service that runs as frequently
as every 15 minutes to LAX, for $6.50 round trip.</TE>
<TE>   The expanded Flyaway, which will include a four-story parking
structure, will be able to handle up to 12 buses an hour, Geere said.</TE>
<TE>   Offering more buses per hour will allow for better connections
with buses run by other agencies, such as the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority and Santa Clarita Transit.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier plans for the new Flyaway to offer baggage check-in are on
hold because of new security measures required by the federal
government, Geere said.</TE>
<TE>   But the expanded facilities will still include space to
accommodate baggage check-in if airport officials decide to offer
that later.</TE>
<TE>   A second phase of the construction project, not yet scheduled, is
expected to expand the parking lot to 3,917 spaces, Geere said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the Flyaway is being expanded to accommodate LAX's
expected growth.</TE>
<TE>   For years, the Flyaway's long-term parking lot got so crowded
around holidays that drivers turned away at its entrance would either
have to go on to LAX or park on nearby streets.</TE>
<TE>   Some nearby residents, who depend on street parking because their
houses don't have driveways, have been planting "no parking" signs in
front of their yards to keep Flyaway riders away.</TE>
<TE>   Margarita Tamayo, 52, said holiday travelers used to clog her
neighborhood with parked cars. But the situation improved, she said,
after she put orange traffic cones in the street in front of her home
on Collett Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   Tamayo, who must park as close as possible to her house because
she has a disabled daughter, said she believes the expansion will be
better for her neighborhood by offering more parking spaces for
travelers.</TE>
<TE>   Some travelers said they would begin asking relatives or friends
to drop them off, or use a different shuttle service for rides to
LAX, or just drive themselves.</TE>
<TE>   John Pantermuehl, a Sun Valley businessman and frequent flier out
of LAX, said he was disappointed to hear about the temporary
reduction in parking spaces.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a bummer," said Pantermuehl, who has used the lot about
once a month for the last 12 years.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to force a lot more people to use the [San Diego
Freeway] and increase traffic."</TE>

<HD>Fairness of Voter Guide to Secession Questioned</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Earlier this year, as the debate over secession heated up, a group of
San Fernando Valley residents launched the Civic Forum, whose mission
is to stay above the breakaway fray and provide voters with objective
information.</LD>
<LD>   The forum has won applause for its weekly cable television show,
"Secession 101," on Channel 36. It has sent speakers to community
meetings and enlisted moderators for debates on the Valley and
Hollywood secession measures on the Nov. 5 ballot.</LD>
<LD>   But as it prepares to distribute 50,000 "voter guides" to
libraries and service organizations, the forum has been accused by
some breakup advocates of harboring an anti-secession bias.</LD>
<TE>   "They appear to be objective, but in reality there have been a lot
of problems of having balance," said Richard Close, chairman of the
secession group Valley VOTE.</TE>
<TE>   Close said some panels on the cable show have been "slanted to
oppose Valley cityhood." Other critics say some forum members have
ties to City Hall, including its chairman, Ken Bernstein, who worked
for Laura Chick when she was a council member.</TE>
<TE>   Bernstein said no member of the forum's 19-member board has taken
a position on secession, and that the organization does its best to
play things down the middle. A sign of the forum's success, he said,
is that it has received complaints from both sides.</TE>
<TE>   Anti-secessionists have griped that the forum has not given them
equal time on television, Bernstein said. He said each camp asked for
changes in the draft of the 16-page voters booklet, but not all the
requests were granted.</TE>
<TE>   "This group was formed to fill a gap that many of us in the Valley
saw," said Bernstein, a Sherman Oaks resident and an official with
the nonprofit Los Angeles Conservancy, an L.A. County preservation
advocacy group. "The secession debate has become so polarized, and
solid balanced information was at a premium. We felt we could
disseminate reliable, balanced information so the voters can make a
decision."</TE>
<TE>   The group's board includes Valley attorney Lee Alpert; newsletter
publisher David Abel; Barry Smedberg, executive director of the
Valley Interfaith Council; and Bruce Ackerman, chief executive of the
Economic Alliance of the San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   A mark of the organization's influence is that it persuaded Mayor
James K. Hahn to make perhaps his only appearance with secessionists
at an Oct. 19 public forum at UCLA. Hahn has rebuffed such proposals
from other groups. At the UCLA session, he will not debate the
secessionists face to face, but will appear after them.</TE>
<TE>   The forum's most visible project is "Secession 101," which appears
on cable systems that reach 70% of Los Angeles households.
Installments have featured panels on the history of secession, the
content of the ballot measures, boroughs as an alternative to
breaking up the city, and rent control.</TE>
<TE>   The program airs at 11:30 a.m. and 9 p.m. Sundays, and 8 p.m.
Tuesdays.</TE>
<TE>   The forum's "Secession: A Voter's Guide" is designed to complement
the show. It attempts easy explanations of secession issues, and
identifies some open questions, such as which laws a Valley or
Hollywood city council might adopt if voters approve a breakup.</TE>
<TE>   "What we are trying to show is that there is a lot we do know
about what a Valley city would look like, but there are also
uncertainties," Bernstein said.</TE>
<TE>   But those more speculative sections of the guide have drawn fire
from secession leaders such as Robert Scott, who said some sentences
are "not objective" and offer the city's spin on issues.</TE>
<TE>   Scott singled out this sentence: "It is uncertain whether the
county of Los Angeles or the remaining city of Los Angeles would be
willing to provide police, fire and other public safety services to
the new Valley city on terms which the latter would find acceptable."</TE>
<TE>   Scott also objected to a passage that states the city has argued
that the Local Agency Formation Commission, which approved the
secession measures for the ballot, "significantly underestimated the
financial impact of the proposed reorganization on the remaining
city."</TE>
<TE>   That argument was rejected by LAFCO, Scott said.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Daar, co-chairman of the anti-secession group One L.A., said
the forum has tried to be neutral on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   "They are another voice," Daar said.</TE>

<HD>Principal Hits the Ground Running</HD>
<DH>Schools: At troubled Fremont High, LaVerne Brunt cracks
down on chronic tardiness.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DOUG SMITH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At 12:41, the lunch bell rings. LaVerne Brunt springs from behind her
desk, strides down a short hallway and immerses herself in a throng
of students on the quad at Fremont High School.</LD>
<LD>   Brunt, the new principal at a school that epitomizes some of the
failures of public education in Los Angeles, is taking this
opportunity to let students know she's available to talk.</LD>
<LD>   But they had better be ready to listen, too. As she moves
purposefully from group to group, she watches, cautions, cajoles and
counsels.</LD>
<TE>   When the fifth-period bell rings at 1:12, the students quickly
head to all corners of the campus. Brunt joins the group squeezing
into the narrow alley between two rows of bungalows.</TE>
<TE>   "Young man, go inside," she tells a straggler.</TE>
<TE>   "No, baby, go inside," she tells a girl who pleads for extra time.</TE>
<TE>   Barely two weeks ago, Brunt, formerly an assistant principal at
Marina del Rey Middle School, was called upon to lead Fremont out of
its academic malaise--easily one of the most challenging jobs in the
district.</TE>
<TE>   Because of test scores that hadn't budged from the basement in
five years, the South Los Angeles campus was singled out for a state
audit. It was one of 10 in the Los Angeles Unified School District,
and 13 in the state, to be targeted. The 4,500-student school,
profiled in a Times article in July, was given 18 months to improve,
or it could face sanctions that include a state takeover.</TE>
<TE>   On his first visit in November, state auditor Gordon Jackson
observed a campus in disarray. Dozens of students milled about while
school was in session. In class, teachers resorted to using picture
books and movies in their lessons to accommodate students' inability
to read. Instructors were antagonistic toward the administration and
vice versa. Two-thirds of each ninth-grade class never made it to
graduation.</TE>
<TE>   Brunt has already made a big first impression, simply by
declaring--and personally enforcing--one basic rule: Students will
get to class on time.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's go!" she yells as a student jogs down the empty alley.
"You're going to get caught. Hurry up!"</TE>
<TE>   Under the shade of the lunch pavilion, she begins to write down
the names of students caught tarrying.</TE>
<TE>   In a meeting last week with parents, Brunt spelled out a new
policy of progressive discipline for tardy pupils, including
detention, parent conferences and suspension for multiple offenders.</TE>
<TE>   The changes got a mixed reaction from students.</TE>
<TE>   "I think she's a pretty nice lady," said 12th-grader Deon Gibson.
"She's laid down some rules and it really makes kids get to class."</TE>
<TE>   Some of Gibson's friends thought differently.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they should take off the tardy sweep thing," said
10th-grader Danny Williams. "She needs to take that out."</TE>
<TE>   Staff members, however, were openly enthusiastic.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, I love her. She's going to be good," said campus aide Darrion
Wright. "Her first day ... she was out of her business shoes and into
her flats. She came with the proper attitude."</TE>
<TE>   "It feels like we're making headway," said counselor Ron Craven.
"Everybody feels it."</TE>
<TE>   With Brunt's appointment, the district has replaced principals and
other staff members at six of the 10 schools audited by the state.
"We know how critical it is to have that leadership," said Supt. Roy
Romer. "This new principal, LaVerne Brunt, has real potential."</TE>
<TE>   Brunt is taking on problems that have festered for years. The lack
of leadership and disorganization on campus have led to protests by
students, teachers and community groups over everything from a
textbook shortage to counseling deficiencies.</TE>
<TE>   Brunt said the pressure doesn't faze her.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't feel as if I'm in a fishbowl," she said. "I know there is
work to be done and we're going to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Fremont's most recent principal, Margaret Roland,
was promoted to the job even though she didn't seek it, had no prior
experience as a principal and had no knowledge of the school's
turbulent history.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know exactly where we're going," she told Jackson, the
state auditor, during their first interview. "Whatever it is you
would have us do, our goal this year is to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Roland has been reassigned to the district office but now is on
leave. She could not be reached for comment. Sylvia Rousseau,
superintendent for Fremont's local district, declined to state the
reason for the reassignment.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said Monday that he had not requested the leadership
change, but supported it.</TE>
<TE>   "I think her heart was in the right place," he said of Roland.
"The question was [whether] her talent and expertise [were] a good
match for where Fremont was at the time."</TE>
<TE>   Brunt, 42, was picked for the assignment by the local district's
high school director, Marcia Haskin, who was principal at Palms
Middle School when Brunt was an assistant principal there.</TE>
<TE>   A former discipline dean, Brunt has unusual self-confidence with
teenagers, mixing soft-spoken compassion with an unbending
application of the rules. At Marina, she is remembered for balancing
a collaborative style with a firm adherence to policy.</TE>
<TE>   Carol Dodd, superintendent for the Westside local district, said
she received a letter earlier this year signed by virtually the
entire Marina staff recommending her for the principal's job at that
school. Instead, the position was taken by a district administrator
who had seniority rights.</TE>
<TE>   "They're very fortunate at Fremont," Dodd said. "It is our loss."</TE>
<TE>   Rousseau said that even before Brunt arrived, the district had
been working steadily to remedy Fremont's problems.</TE>
<TE>   One key change, Rousseau said, has been easing the school's
chronic overcrowding. The district installed bungalows and shifted
some students to other schools.</TE>
<TE>   District officials have also been "listening to faculty, spending
time in and out of classes," to address teachers' long-standing
hostility toward administration, Rousseau said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it has gone some distance in building trust, that we're
not just in the business of blaming teachers, but trying to map some
ways we can do it together," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The tardy policy represents the easier half of the down-to-basics
vision that Brunt outlined in a presentation to parents last week.
The more difficult half has to do with what goes on inside the
classroom.</TE>
<TE>   "It is my vision that teaching and learning will occur all of the
time," she said in an interview. "I have shared that with the staff.
That is my expectation."</TE>
<TE>   To help guide the school toward instruction geared to rigorous new
state standards, the district has provided resources, including
teaching coaches and trainers from UCLA and the Los Angeles
Educational Partnership, a local education group.</TE>
<TE>   Brunt said she plans to pay key teachers to attend voluntary
sessions on Saturdays and Sundays to design a new curriculum. Those
who participate will train their colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   The first outside assessment of Brunt's work will come next week,
when a team of state auditors plans to drop in for a two-day
quarterly follow-up.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said taking on the pervasive tardiness problem struck him
as a good place for Brunt to start.</TE>
<TE>   "I would imagine the teachers are feeling good about it," Jackson
said.</TE>
<TE>   "That would encourage them to participate in the next step" toward
reform.</TE>

<HD>Hahn Goes Public on Selection of LAPD Chief</HD>
<DH>Politics: Mayor launches a media campaign to prepare the
city for his decision on a new leader for the Los Angeles Police
Department.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETH SHUSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seeking to avoid the controversy that dogged him the last time he
made a pivotal decision about Los Angeles' police chief, Mayor James
K. Hahn is launching a media campaign this week to prepare the city
for his imminent selection of a new top official for the Los Angeles
Police Department.</LD>
<LD>   On radio and television news programs, in English and Spanish, the
mayor will talk about the need for a strong leader, someone who can
reduce the crime rate, boost morale, recruit new officers and reform
the department.</LD>
<LD>   He will talk about the need for a partnership between Los Angeles'
diverse neighborhoods and its police force and the need for someone
who understands and accepts civilian oversight. Finally, Hahn is
stressing his desire to have someone with whom he will have a solid
working relationship.</LD>
<TE>   "I want to get the message out as widely as I can about what my
priorities are for public safety in this city," the mayor said in a
recent interview. "I want to talk to people all over the city and
tell them what's going into my thinking and what my priorities are."</TE>
<TE>   While Hahn's criteria offer no surprises, some observers took note
of topics he is not addressing. Race, for one. The merits of choosing
an LAPD insider or an outsider, for another.</TE>
<TE>   Some political consultants say it appears the mayor wants to avoid
controversy as he conducts the media campaign and tries to prepare
the public for his selection. That way, when Hahn announces his
choice to lead the LAPD, the city will be more likely to accept it.</TE>
<TE>   When Hahn opposed a second five-year term for former Chief Bernard
C. Parks, he was criticized for failing to make his case to the
public. Many were caught off guard by his decision, and many did not
understand it. In particular, he suffered a significant loss of
support in the African American community.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the mayor's realized that surprise is not a suit he wears
well," said Harvey Englander, a veteran city political consultant.
"This [media campaign] really brings the public into the discussion,
something he was criticized for not doing with Chief Parks."</TE>
<TE>   The Police Commission, which is scheduled to meet in closed
session today, recently narrowed its list of candidates to 13,
including six who work in the department and seven others.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor sent his closest aide and chief of staff, Tim McOsker,
and a deputy mayor to several cities to gain insight into some of the
outside candidates. They are expected to brief the five-member
commission today on their findings.</TE>
<TE>   The Police Commission is expected soon to select three top
candidates, whose names will be turned over to the mayor for a final
selection.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn stressed that he will not use this decision to improve
relations with the African American community or any other.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it's about whose turn it is, what politically helps
me, if it helps me fight secession or if it helps me repair relations
with this community or that community," Hahn said. "It's about
picking the best person.... This chief will be the chief for every
neighborhood, every person in the city. I want people to understand
how I'm making this decision."</TE>
<TE>   The mayor will appear on public radio and television,
Spanish-language radio and several other radio shows as well. He
plans to conduct television interviews, and he already has met with
reporters from several local newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   Several political consultants say Hahn's media strategy is smart.
He will have an important audience: policymakers, homeowners,
community leaders, people from many segments of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   One consultant said Hahn is "preconditioning the market for his
selection," meaning he is gathering support before he makes his
decision.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the mayor said he will select a leader who is quickly
accepted by the department and the community. And he will not rush
his decision.</TE>
<TE>   "I am going to take as much time as I need," Hahn said. "I want to
get to know this person, to see if this person shares my vision for
public safety and is someone I can work with and have a strong
relationship with. The mayor is elected by everyone in the city. I am
the chief executive officer of the city, and I've got to have a
strong relationship, a strong partnership, with the chief."</TE>
<TE>   "After all," he added, "there is no more important job than public
safety."</TE>

<HD>Inventors Find Mothering's a Necessity</HD>
<DH>Innovation: Feedback is key, creative thinkers say. They're
always onto something, such as a mess-free bug zapper, better toilet.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The room grew silent as Maria Deslierres rose to speak. "I just got
tired of standing in airports," she explained. Then she unveiled her
solution: the perfect luggage cart for the post-9/11 world, one with
a fold-up seat for those long waits in airport security lines.</LD>
<LD>   "We've had the patent for three years," Deslierres said, "but so
far we haven't been able to market it."</LD>
<LD>   With any luck, the men and women gathered in Huntington Beach on a
recent Friday will be able to help. They are among 175 members of
Orange County's Inventors Forum, a group of creative thinkers with a
mission.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a hard job inventing things," explains Carl Schulthess, the
organization's chairman, who says he's working on a project to reduce
traffic on the nation's freeways. He won't divulge how it works, he
says, because the idea isn't patented.</TE>
<TE>   "Where else can an independent inventor go?" says Schulthess, 63,
an applied-optics consultant from Mission Viejo. "Inventors Forum is
a networking organization that provides support and information, kind
of like Alcoholics Anonymous."</TE>
<TE>   The support comes in several forms. On the second Friday of each
month, the group has a meeting, open to the public, at which outside
lecturers present seminars with such titles as "Funding Innovation
and Inventions," "Turning Ideas Into Fortunes," "Protecting the
Marketability of Your Invention" and "Prototyping and Manufacturing
Your New Ideas."</TE>
<TE>   On the last Friday of the month, the organization holds a meeting
just for members, each of whom must sign a pledge of confidentiality
to attend. It is here that new ideas are presented, and feedback
sought. The purpose is twofold, says Schulthess: to share ideas on
technical issues and marketing, and to legally document the date of
inception.</TE>
<TE>   "In the United States," he says, "the first to invent something
gets the patent. Our members, in essence, are witnesses--if you
document the inception, you get the green light."</TE>
<TE>   Ridiculous to Sublime</TE>
<TE>   In the club's 12 years, Schulthess says, hundreds of
inventions--from ridiculous to sublime--have been launched. Several
members have come up with unmarketable ideas for improving toilets.
Another is working on a potentially revolutionary way to accelerate
decomposition in landfills by injecting them with steam.</TE>
<TE>   "By using my method," says Reg Renaud, a 50-year-old engineer from
Silverado Canyon, "we can reduce a landfill's decomposition from 50
years to five."</TE>
<TE>   Other inventions completed or under development by forum members
include a scanning system to detect irregularities--including
explosives or humans--in shipping containers entering the nation's
harbors; a heavy-duty industrial security door that lets people out
but not in; a car-washing tool called the Shiwala Mop, which
attracted 2 million buyers on the Home Shopping Network; an electric
air freshener that plugs into a car's cigarette lighter; and a hollow
"bug stick" with a "puff" of soft material on the end with which to
suck up critters.</TE>
<TE>   "You can pick up a bug without squashing it on the wall,"
Schulthess explained.</TE>
<TE>   At a recent meeting, several ideas emerged. Allen Hardison, 80,
introduced his concept of using a "scent transfer unit" to enable
dogs to detect the smell of certain diseases in citrus fruits and
paranoid schizophrenia in humans. Lee Willis, 47, talked about his
Sentinel of Security, a flashlight-size tube containing a tethered
helium balloon that can be automatically inflated by campers lost in
the woods to help authorities find them. And Ken Hellyer, 48,
demonstrated his adjustable batting tee designed to hone baseball
players' responses to less-than-perfect pitches.</TE>
<TE>   Marketing Is Tricky</TE>
<TE>   The audience perked up when Gerard Russo, 76, presented his
universal holder, a Velcro wrist strap that gives users a hands-free
grip on almost anything.</TE>
<TE>   "How are you doing with marketing this thing?" Schulthess asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Lousy," Russo replied. "I'm not a marketer. I get only words."</TE>
<TE>   "Well," Schulthess suggested, "have you thought of marketing it to
the handicapped? I think that's a good place to start."</TE>
<TE>   Deslierres, waiting in the wings to show off her
luggage-cart-with-a-seat, said she understands the value of feedback.</TE>
<TE>   "We share," said the amateur inventor, who created her first
contraption--a stairway wheelchair escalator--at age 15.</TE>
<TE>   "Sharing is very important in the inventor's art. It's kind of a
disease--you start inventing and keep trying to improve things. You
just can't stop. So far, there isn't a cure."</TE>

<HD>Spread of Jewish Schools Signals Attitude Change</HD>
<DH>Education: Opening of Valley facility is part of trend as
parents look for teaching of values.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MASSIE RITSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Growing up in Chicago in the 1930s, Lisa Greene's grandfather changed
his name from Greenstein to disguise his Jewish heritage.</LD>
<LD>   "And now I'm at a school just for Jews," said Lisa, a senior at
Tarbut V'Torah Community Day School in Irvine. "It's amazing how
things have changed. You can be Jewish so much easier now, and
practice what you believe and not hide it."</LD>
<LD>   For an increasing number of Jewish students, practicing what you
believe has come to include attending a Jewish high school. It is a
significant shift.</LD>
<TE>   For Orthodox Jews, religious high schools have a long tradition.
But for most American Jews who are not Orthodox, loyalty to public
education has been the norm, at least until recently.</TE>
<TE>   This month, the beginning of the school year brought the opening
of a new Jewish high school in the San Fernando Valley--New Community
Jewish High School--and Kehillah Jewish High School in San Jose. They
are the fifth and sixth high schools aimed at non-Orthodox Jews to
open in California since 1990, joining Tarbut in Irvine, Milken
Community High School in the Sepulveda Pass and Jewish high schools
in San Francisco and San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   There were five non-Orthodox Jewish high schools in the entire
country in 1990; by next fall, there will be 29, according to the
Partnership for Excellence in Jewish Education, based in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   And although the schools enroll only a fraction of the total
number of Jewish high school students, the growth--and the shift away
from public schooling--marks "nothing short of a re-envisioning of
how the Jewish community educates its children," said Bruce Powell,
head of New Community.</TE>
<TE>   Several factors and feelings combine to explain the change,
according to parents, students and Jewish educators.</TE>
<TE>   Immigrants to the United States have traditionally seen public
schools in the big cities where they settled as the way to
assimilate, said Powell, who went to Birmingham High School in Van
Nuys in the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   "It was our road to material success, to political success," he
said. Lack of money for tuition and discrimination by non-Jewish
private schools also kept Jews in public systems.</TE>
<TE>   Today, however, most American Jews are no longer immigrants, and
urban public schools have lost their luster. Parents have begun
considering them too big, too dangerous, too easy.</TE>
<TE>   "We found that our kids were just a number in the public
environment," said Yossi Dashti, who has three children at Tarbut
V'Torah and a fourth who is now in college. "Here, they're under a
microscope."</TE>
<TE>   Emphasis on Ethics</TE>
<TE>   But parents' dissatisfaction with public education only partly
explains the growth of Jewish schools. Orange County's Tarbut V'Torah
is just one example of a Jewish high school opening in a suburban
area, where many public schools are highly regarded.</TE>
<TE>   Parents interviewed for this article repeatedly said they send
their children to private schools--and Jewish ones--because those
schools can teach values and ethics that many find missing in public
schools.</TE>
<TE>   "With our schedule, the parents are running around crazy, trying
to make a living, trying to pay the tuition. We don't really have the
time to teach them that," said Erika Paskhover, whose son, Paul
Purman, is among the first freshmen at New Community high school.</TE>
<TE>   Also driving the trend has been a consistent concern among Jewish
leaders about a rising rate of intermarriage and the fear that
children of mixed marriages would be raised as non-Jews.</TE>
<TE>   "We were simply destroying ourselves," Powell said. "We were
finishing Hitler's work."</TE>
<TE>   Some schools are less comfortable discussing that motivation for
the creation of these high schools, or disagree with it entirely.</TE>
<TE>   "I want it to be more than an injunction from their parents that
you've got to stay tribal. That's not meaningful. That's not lasting,
in my view," said Stuart Dow, head of the Emery/Weiner School in
Houston, which opened last year and is one of the few Jewish high
schools that admits non-Jews.</TE>
<TE>   Keeping the Connection</TE>
<TE>   Dow--like many other Jewish educators--prefers to stress another
aspect of the high schools: their ability to maintain young people's
connection to Judaism after the age of 12 or 13, when many Jewish
children celebrate their bar or bat mitzvah.</TE>
<TE>   A few hours of weekend classes teaching basic Hebrew and the
meaning of religious holidays produces only an infantile
understanding of the religion and culture, Jewish educators said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think parents are starting to see a large drop-off in Jewish
identity after bar mitzvah," said Jacqueline Bocian, president of the
board of trustees at Kehillah in San Jose, which opened earlier this
month on a leased public school campus. "They're terrified that their
kids are going to leave it behind."</TE>
<TE>   Students, too, acknowledge that there is more to learn about
Judaism beyond middle school.</TE>
<TE>   "If kids don't start learning it more regularly, where's it all
going to be in the next generation?" asked Benji Berger, who went to
a public middle school and is now among New Community's freshman
class.</TE>
<TE>   Given the never-ending debates about what exactly constitutes a
Jewish identity, the mission to maintain one guarantees a certain
amount of tension.</TE>
<TE>   "You're never, ever going to please everyone; either the place is
too Jewish or it's not Jewish enough," said Jason Ablin, the director
of general studies at Milken.</TE>
<TE>   "The battle is really to create a comfort zone for the spectrum of
Jews coming in here and have them bounce around as they figure out
their Jewish identity," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But most Jewish educators agree that establishing high schools
offers a richer opportunity than bar mitzvah training or Jewish
elementary schools in which to preserve Judaism among the nation's
roughly 6 million Jews. Students can explore their heritage freed
from the labels of their synagogue--Conservative or Reform, for
example--and they are mature enough to analyze Jewish teachings and
relate them to secular academic subjects.</TE>
<TE>   Science and the Talmud</TE>
<TE>   At Tarbut V'Torah, for example, bioethics might be debated using
references to the Jewish laws of the Talmud. In the school's library,
a state-of-the-art broadcasting system is just feet away from an ark
protecting the Torah.</TE>
<TE>   On the magazine rack, Newsweek is next to Biblical Archaeology
Review.</TE>
<TE>   To follow kosher restrictions to keep meat and dairy separate,
Tarbut has two kitchens. Kosher pizza is delivered on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Built on rolling ranchland, the campus is dotted with olive trees
and other plants native to Israel. The spine of the campus resembles
the Western Wall in Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   To Principal Howard Haas, a former public school administrator,
Tarbut's site--and the school's very existence--is extraordinary.
"You have an area in Orange County where 20 years ago, people didn't
say they were Jewish," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some 100 miles to the north and west in West Hills, New Community
opened this month with 37 students in ninth grade, a typical
beginning for these start-ups.</TE>
<TE>   While the luckiest schools start with spectacular campuses funded
by wealthy donors, more often, the schools' first classrooms are like
New Community's: spare spaces at Jewish community centers, next to
senior citizens' ceramics classes and games of mah-jongg. The new
schools develop from there.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no traditions," said Neil Kramer, New Community's dean
of faculty. "Except the kind that are 3,000 years old."</TE>

<HD>Garden Grove's Koreatown Seeks Highway Profile</HD>
<DH>Retail: The shopping district wants to be Orange County's
second ethnic enclave with a freeway sign. Supporters say it would be
good for business.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIVIAN LETRAN and MAI TRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The drive to Garden Grove's Korean Business District should have
taken Lisa Kim only 15 minutes. But the 18-year-old visitor from
Oregon got lost.</LD>
<LD>   "I was getting frustrated because I kept making U-turns. And then
it took a while for me to find a parking space," Kim said. "I almost
gave up going to the store."</LD>
<LD>   For merchants who hope the four-block, mile-long shopping district
will someday become Orange County's unquestioned Koreatown, getting
on the map has been an uphill battle.</LD>
<TE>   But the district may get a boost in visibility. Merchants will ask
the California Department of Transportation this week for a sign on
the Garden Grove Freeway. If it's granted, the shopping district
would be the second ethnic enclave in Orange County to be granted a
freeway marker.</TE>
<TE>   The shopping district is dotted with Korean businesses, a
seemingly haphazard collection of older buildings and new plazas
that, if not for the Korean signs and logos on storefronts and a pair
of concrete monuments, would be indistinguishable from any other
commercial strip. More than 1,000 businesses--bookstores,
restaurants, groceries, car dealers--line the stretch of Garden Grove
Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to promote the area because it's not only for Koreans,
it's for everyone," said Euiwon Chough, a Korean Chamber of Commerce
leader who has pushed for six years to get freeway signs. "We have
signs for South Coast Plaza, the Performing Arts Center and Buena
Park Mall, why not the Korean Business District?"</TE>
<TE>   Ethnic business districts have become tourist destinations
throughout Southern California. In Los Angeles, freeway signs guide
out-of-towners to Chinatown, Little Tokyo, Thai Town, Little India
and Olvera Street. Little Saigon, a thriving Vietnamese community
across town from the Korean Business District, is Orange County's
only ethnic business community with a highway sign.</TE>
<TE>   The signs, merchants and city officials agree, would be a public
relations victory, a symbol that the shopping district is worthy of
commuter attention.</TE>
<TE>   Sun Kim, owner of KitchenLand, hopes the attention will attract a
more diverse customer base.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to introduce our Korean products to other people," said
Kim, who sells imported housewares. "We want to share our culture."</TE>
<TE>   Merchants will ask Caltrans to erect four signs along the Garden
Grove Freeway, two in each direction at the Beach Boulevard exit and
an identical set at Brookhurst Street. There are already signs at the
Brookhurst exit directing travelers to Little Saigon.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans officials said they are concerned that adding the signs
could clutter the freeways.</TE>
<TE>   "Too many signs can confuse people," said Caltrans spokesman
Albert Miranda. "We're very careful to provide only the right amount
of signs to get people to where they want to go."</TE>
<TE>   After it files its application, the Korean Business District must
produce evidence that the area attracts a high volume of visitors and
show how it plans to guide motorists to the retail district. The city
has already endorsed the request, another condition Caltrans
requires.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed freeway signs are the latest in a series of steps
designed to distinguish--and bring customers to--the shopping
district. Last year the Korean American community installed a
west-facing monument at the Brookhurst Way end of the commercial
section, officially designating the stretch as the Korean Business
District.</TE>
<TE>   The previous year, the Korean Chamber of Commerce installed a
similar monument--facing east--at the western boundary at Fern
Street. Both monuments, paid for by local businesses, say "Welcome"
in Korean on the front and "Leave safely" in Korean on the back.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the efforts, business in the Korean Shopping District has
not grown dramatically. City officials say the sales tax revenue from
the district has been flat for nearly a decade, a reflection of the
economy and the fact that only a few large businesses have settled in
the area in the last couple of years.</TE>
<TE>   The city earns about $400,000 annually in sales taxes, about 3% of
its total, from the business district, a trend that has held steady
for three years, said Community Development Director Matthew Fertal.</TE>
<TE>   Further, the upswing in Orange County's Korean population, as well
as the predicted migration of businesses from Los Angeles following
the 1992 riot, have been less than expected.</TE>
<TE>   Korean Americans now make up 14% of Orange County's Asian
population. At 55,573, the Korean population trails the number of
Vietnamese and Chinese American residents.</TE>
<TE>   While Garden Grove was the heart of the county's Korean American
community a decade ago, the U.S. Census shows that more Koreans now
live in Fullerton and Irvine, where the Korean population more than
doubled.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>An Orange County judge Monday gave Newport Beach the go-ahead to
remove 25 mature ficus trees from Balboa's historic Main Street, but
tree lovers are considering appealing the decision.</LD>
<LD>   "We need to move expeditiously," said Stephen Miles, an attorney
representing the Balboa Arborist Society. The group had sued to
prevent removal of the trees.</LD>
<LD>   Orange County Superior Court Judge Ronald L. Bauer, who had
earlier blocked the city from removing the trees, declined to extend
that order.</LD>
<TE>   The ficus trees have been there since the 1960s, but city
officials say they are in the way of a $2.8-million improvement
project.</TE>

<HD>Charity Became Church's Salvation After Taking Shabby Sloop
Off Its Hands</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since mentioning the 27-foot sloop that was donated to the Society of
St. Vincent de Paul charity, I've learned that the shabby craft had a
colorful history and mysterious crew--all while in dry dock.</LD>
<LD>   The donor was the First United Methodist Church of San Pedro,
which had stowed it in its parking lot "for several years," Pastor
Eric Scott says.</LD>
<LD>   "Our congregation originally accepted the boat in order to
refurbish it for our Anchors Aweigh program, but eventually decided
the sloop was beyond salvation. We couldn't get rid of the darn thing
to save our lives."</LD>
<TE>   Scott says the grounded craft "became an eyesore and a source of
constant conflict. It attracted rubbish and graffiti. It caught fire
once. A squatter moved in and brought with him suspicious midnight
visitors. (We may have had the only crack sloop in L.A. ... then
again, probably not.)"</TE>
<TE>   The pastor said his church was grateful to St. Vincent for
"accepting our rummage, but we also felt guilty for taking advantage
of their naivete. Then Steve Harvey tells the whole city that it took
St. Vincent only a few days to sell the boat for $500! We are in
agony!"</TE>
<TE>   Added Scott: "By the way, we do have this giant wooden badger..."</TE>
<TE>   No beating around the Australian bush: On a visit to Sydney, Nat
Read of Pasadena snapped a terse warning to motorists (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Weighty proposition: Will Wild of Malibu noticed that one guy who
took out a single's ad "has a lot to offer" (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of sex: "When I enter a golf tournament, I expect that my
handicap/index will be verified," wrote Bill Kennedy of West Covina.
"But contestants in the Long Beach Men's City Championship had an
additional requirement to meet" (see accompanying). Odd, hadn't
realized transsexuals were an issue in golf before now.</TE>
<TE>   No waxy buildup for him: Mike Brennan of Pacific Palisades notes
that the television show "Monk" about "an obsessive-compulsive,
germ-and dirt-fearing detective," has an appropriate sponsor: Mr.
Clean.</TE>
<TE>   Put it on mute! In the "Your Two Cents Worth" column of anonymous
reader comments in the Palisadian Post, Phyllis Waggner of West
Hollywood spotted this review: "To the blondish young lady who likes
to work out at a fitness facility in the Palisades: I'm sure your
mother thinks you have a lovely singing voice, but the rest of us
would prefer that you listen--silently--to your music headset."</TE>
<TE>   Is it headed your way? The police log of the Coastline News in
Laguna Beach said "a resident reported his cat went completely
crazy.... They confined it with a laundry basket, but it escaped when
they tried to move it. Animal control was advised."</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: Nina Brice of Laguna Woods saw a sign that read "Ear
Piercing While You Wait," which she pointed out eliminates "the pesky
inconvenience of leaving your ears at the shop for a few days."</TE>

<HD>Cooley Brings Own Style to D.A.'s Job</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patt Morrison</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you come upon a new James Ellroy novel one of these days, and
there's a big-city D.A. in it who's no oil painting, a character with
slouchy posture and upright reputation, and you think, wait, I know
this guy--yeah, you do.</LD>
<LD>   That character would be modeled on Los Angeles County's D.A.,
Steve Cooley, who thinks James Ellroy is pretty cool--"L.A.
Confidential" is his favorite book--and Ellroy has returned the
regard publicly.</LD>
<LD>   Over the summer, in a GQ magazine piece, Ellroy sized Cooley up
so: "I expect he'll go down in history as one of the great American
crime-fighters."</LD>
<TE>   For Cooley, whose father was a G-man for J. Edgar Hoover and who
keeps his dad's FBI badge cuff links behind glass in his office, this
is sweet, sweet stuff.</TE>
<TE>   That quote is Cooley's favorite clipping about him personally in
the nearly two years since he became D.A., but just when he wanted a
copy of it, nobody could find it. It wasn't hanging on his office
wall--almost nothing is, except his father's Eagle Scout honors and
some political caricatures of Cooley himself. What, I teased him, no
pictures of you posing with politicians?</TE>
<TE>   "We don't photograph politicians," he said in his best Ellroy
delivery. "We prosecute 'em."</TE>
<TE>   This is classic Cooley, the plain old call-me-Steve guy who moved
into this 18th-floor office on a Monday morning in December 2000,
less than a month after beating his old boss Gil Garcetti nearly
2-to-1.</TE>
<TE>   Style being a peculiar local L.A. currency, the switch in D.A.
style was immediate. Garcetti was the camera-ready, urbane
sophisticate who could and did go face-time to face-time on TV with
defense attorneys almost as famous as their clients. Cooley has
limited his TV appearances to big announcements like the Angel of
Death and Symbionese Liberation Army prosecutions; his distaste for
the "press-conference prosecution" is unmistakable. "We're going to
do our talking in court rather than on the courthouse steps," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   For me, this defined the post-Garcetti style: In praising his
investigators, Cooley the Cal State L.A. grad told me, "We get the
cream de la cream, put that down, the cream de la cream of
investigators." Garcetti the USC grad would have pronounced it in
correct French, "creme de la creme." James Ellroy, put that down.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley's new office is squarely above where his old desk was, the
same view but six floors up, and if there's a high-flying metaphor
dangling there about vision and scope, Cooley isn't biting. The
closest he gets is when I ask him about the praiseworthy public
integrity and corruption investigations he's launched that have
jerked the chain of elected and appointed officials even in
under-the-radar cities like South Gate and Bell Gardens.</TE>
<TE>   "Let me phrase it this way: If I leave a legacy of whatever time
I'm here, I am now convinced it will be this, because it was such a
void, such a prosecutorial void."</TE>
<TE>   He'd sit six floors below and read newspaper stories about Carlos
Vignali and such, and think, if the newspapers can find this stuff,
why can't prosecutors?</TE>
<TE>   "Historically, I think there was an aversion" to going after such
cases, a sense that "if you go after X, you're going to upset X's
constituency, and we wouldn't want to do that"--those constituencies
being "sometimes ethnic, sometimes business or regional" whose
perfidies besmirched not only on-the-level politicians but "all the
hard-working honest taxpaying people out there who want their
government honest."</TE>
<TE>   Cooley was speaking at a Palm Springs convention about public
integrity when South Gate Treasurer Albert Robles--out on bail after
Cooley's squad nailed him for alleged death threats against state
legislators--ostentatiously got up and walked out. Cooley loved it:
"Having someone like Albert Robles walk out on you in the middle of a
speech about public integrity is a badge of honor."</TE>
<TE>   He's put the Brown Act, the state's open-meetings law, into his
investigators' vocabulary--"This office never enforced it before."
Yet there was understandable snarky comment when his office announced
that his bosses, the Board of Supervisors, hadn't violated the Brown
Act by acting in closed session last year--the same week Cooley went
to the board in person, asking it not to cut $8 million from his
budget.</TE>
<TE>   And what of those two notorious instances of official bad faith,
Rampart and Belmont? Cooley belayed Garcetti on them in the campaign.
Then he inherited months of work already done on them. Nearly two
years later, we're still looking at our watches, or rather, our
calendars, for results.</TE>
<TE>   He'll rail about delays in getting Winona Ryder to court, but on
Belmont and Rampart, Cooley leans on lawyer-speak. Rampart--on which
he once prematurely said he was closing the books--is being "reviewed
extensively by high levels of this office," still, and the results
will be released en masse. "We don't want to do it piecemeal." Ditto
Belmont, which, like Rampart, has been reviewed and assessed, and
"we'll share the results of that with a public report .... We're
going to do it all in one point in time."</TE>
<TE>   That point in time, Mr. D.A., will be worth your spending a few
minutes on the courthouse steps. Lights we got. Camera we got. It's
the "action" we'll be waiting to hear.</TE>

<HD>Playa Vista Developers to Halt Roadwork for Now</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTHA GROVES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wetlands proponents claimed a victory Monday when Playa Vista's
developers agreed in Los Angeles Superior Court to temporarily halt
roadwork near the controversial project.</LD>
<LD>   Opponents of the 1,087-acre commercial and residential development
near Playa del Rey said the temporary restraining order is
significant because it probably will push the Culver Boulevard
construction into next spring. Under California Coastal Commission
rules, no grading can be done during the rainy season, Oct. 15 to
March 30.</LD>
<LD>   "It helps save the plants and the wetlands from being destroyed,"
said Marcia Hanscom, with the Sierra Club Ballona Wetlands Task
Force. She said the land near where the roadwork is planned qualifies
as a wetland because of plant life that includes seaside heliotrope.</LD>
<TE>   Attorneys for Playa Vista and the Coastal Commission agreed to a
temporary restraining order signed by Judge George H. Wu.</TE>
<TE>   Wu did not actually hear the case, which challenges the
commission's approval of the widening of Culver Boulevard between
Lincoln Boulevard and the Marina Freeway and a ramp between Culver
and Jefferson boulevards. Rather, he set a hearing for Thursday to
determine when and by whom the case would be heard.</TE>
<TE>   He vowed to set a date next week for a hearing on a preliminary
injunction. The restraining order would expire Sept. 27.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for Playa Vista said they expect to prevail.</TE>
<TE>   The "project opponents who led the challenge have a pattern and
practice of filing similar lawsuits, only to lose once the issue is
fully heard by the court," attorneys said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   They said the roadwork is "critically needed" to improve traffic
flow and safety.</TE>
<TE>   Hanscom challenged that contention. "These little minor traffic
improvements that will hurt the wetlands but not substantially help
the traffic are a joke," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The plans call for adding a traffic lane and a turn lane to Culver
Boulevard and building modified and new ramp connections between
Culver and Jefferson.</TE>

<HD>Ventura Raceway May Have Run Its Course</HD>
<DH>Recreation: Fair Board today will discuss track's contract
amid noise concerns. It also is considering other options for Seaside
Park.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA BLANCHARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>.</LD>
<LD>   Seaside Park could be transformed from a noisy raceway to a
concert venue under one scenario being considered by the Ventura
County Fair Board as it attempts to create a master plan for the
park.</LD>
<LD>   The board at 9 a.m. today will discuss renewing its contract with
Ventura Raceway, which sponsors weekend races referred to by some
residents as the "roar by the shore."</LD>
<TE>   Board President Greg Carson said the panel is developing a master
plan for the county fairgrounds and is considering ways to change the
park's layout to increase revenue and better serve residents.</TE>
<TE>   The raceway has been a fixture at the fairgrounds for 25 years,
but some residents have complained in recent years about excessive
noise and lighting generated by the weekend races and midweek
practices.</TE>
<TE>   Carson said the board's options include limiting the number of
nights the track is used for racing, making it available for concerts
or other events, or eliminating the raceway altogether.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have a preconceived idea of what it should be," Carson
said. "But I think the property needs to be better utilized for the
benefit of the entire community."</TE>
<TE>   Raceway promoter Jim Naylor said he realizes the weekly races
don't generate a great deal of revenue, but he said the track is an
integral part of the community, drawing more than 1,000 on some
nights and providing low-cost entertainment for families.</TE>
<TE>   Naylor also said the track is the only facility of its kind in the
region. If it were to close, he said, drivers and fans would have to
travel more than 100 miles to reach another racetrack.</TE>
<TE>   "We are living up to what a fairgrounds should be," Naylor said.
"This is not about dollars and cents. This is Americana."</TE>
<TE>   Naylor said he is sympathetic about noise concerns, and has been
working with exhaust engineers to create mufflers for the race cars.
He's also tried to reduce noise by adding trees and other
landscaping.</TE>
<TE>   "We've tried to be as good a neighbor as we can," he said, adding
that the noise level is monitored during each race to ensure that it
doesn't become excessive.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Naylor's efforts, city officials have heard numerous
complaints over the years from neighbors of the fairgrounds.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Simms, who lives about two miles from the raceway, said he
can hear the noise from his home on some weekends, even with his
double-paned windows shut. For the last three years, he has lobbied
to get racetrack noise curbed.</TE>
<TE>   "I think if they put new mufflers on [the cars], it wouldn't be as
big of a problem," Simms said. "But all it takes is one car without a
muffler."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura Councilman Carl Morehouse said residents have complained
for years about the noise, and that he occasionally hears the roar
from his home near Ventura College.</TE>
<TE>   "I have several friends who are closely affiliated with the races,
and really enjoy it," Morehouse said. "But I wouldn't be crushed if
it went away."</TE>
<TE>   But Councilman Jim Monahan said he would be saddened if the
raceway was eliminated. "I hope they do renew the contract," he said,
adding that several famous drivers had gotten their start at the
Ventura track. "I would hate to see it go away. It's been a tradition
in Ventura."</TE>
<TE>   The meeting will be held at the Derby Club at Seaside Park.</TE>

<HD>Davis Says Bills Will Help Fight Terrorism</HD>

<LD>Gov. Gray Davis on Monday signed a bill reauthorizing California's
wiretap law, but it will take effect only if he signs separate
legislation spawned by the Rampart scandal that would give some
convicts a new way to overturn their convictions.</LD>
<LD>   Appearing at a gathering of law enforcement officials discussing
homeland security in Ontario, Davis signed the wiretap bill and five
other measures he said would increase the state's readiness to combat
terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   "For the past year," Davis said in a statement, "we've done
whatever it takes to keep our residents safe. As governor, I intend
to press the issue and make sure that law enforcement has the tools
they need in the ongoing fight against terrorism."</LD>
<TE>   At campaign stops in East Los Angeles and the Inland Empire, Davis
also emphasized his record on crime. And in Riverside, while
discussing the state's Amber alert system, he praised Kern County
sheriff's deputies for shooting suspect Roy Ratliff following the
summer abduction of two teenage girls.</TE>
<TE>   The wiretap legislation Davis signed Monday includes a provision
pushed by Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco) that
allows it to become law only if Davis agrees to a separate Burton
measure that could benefit some convicted criminals.</TE>
<TE>   An aide to the governor said Davis is expected to sign Burton's
bill, SB 1391.</TE>
<TE>   More than 100 people caught up in the LAPD's Rampart scandal have
had their convictions overturned. But a judge ruled that people could
challenge their convictions only if they still were in jail or on
probation. Under Burton's bill, those who already have served their
sentence would gain the right to challenge their convictions as well.</TE>
<TE>   Concerned that Davis might not sign the measure, Burton used a
legislative maneuver called "double joining," which requires that the
governor sign both bills for either to take effect.</TE>
<TE>   Davis began the year by seeking a significant expansion of police
authority to wiretap suspected criminals' phones. Burton opposed the
concept, and the Legislature's counsel said federal law does not
permit states to obtain such broad wiretap authority. Davis opted for
a pared-back measure. As he signed the wiretap bill, AB 74 by
Assemblyman Carl Washington (D-Paramount), the governor vowed to
press for a broader wiretap law next year.</TE>

<LD>A Stanton man who died during a gun battle with Westminster police
last week was killed by a self-inflicted gunshot wound, officials
said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Westminster police officers shot Dai Tran Nguyen, 37, once in the
leg but he died from a gunshot to his head, said Jim Amormino,
spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's Department.</LD>
<LD>   "He was hit by the officer, but it was a nonfatal wound," Amormino
said. "The fatal wound came from [Nguyen's] gun."</LD>
<TE>   Coroner's officials completed an autopsy and ballistic exams but
are awaiting results of toxicology tests.</TE>
<TE>   During a Sept. 11 chase, Nguyen, who had an outstanding arrest
warrant, led police to his home, fired at officers and jumped over a
wall and into an alley. An investigation is continuing, police said.</TE>

<HD>Hunters to Trap and Shoot Pigs on Santa Cruz Island</HD>
<DH>Wildlife: Park service officials say the eradication of the
nonnative swine, which are damaging sensitive sites, is key to
restoring land to its natural state.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thousands of wild pigs that have been uprooting environmentally
sensitive land on Santa Cruz Island will be methodically hunted and
shot over the next six years under a National Park Service plan.</LD>
<LD>   Eradicating the nonnative pigs, as outlined in an environmental
document released this month, is a major step in a broader effort to
restore Santa Cruz Island to its natural state, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   "Removing the pigs is an important piece to that big picture,"
said Kate Faulkner, chief of natural resources management for Channel
Islands National Park.</LD>
<TE>   Not only do the hairy, scruffy swine dig up and devour the bulbous
roots of many rare and endangered plant species, they also have
damaged nearly all of the 687 identified archeological sites on the
island--some that include 8,000-year-old Chumash artifacts.</TE>
<TE>   More indirectly, the pigs have contributed to the decline of the
island fox, a species that is unique to Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa and
San Miguel islands off the Ventura County coast. Pigs serve as a food
source for interloping golden eagles, which then supplement their
diets with the diminutive island fox, Faulkner said. The omnivorous
pigs also compete with the fox for food.</TE>
<TE>   And the animals have been blamed for spreading seeds of the
invasive fennel plant, which covers more than 10% of the island.</TE>
<TE>   Domestic pigs were introduced to the island by a Santa Barbara
rancher in the mid-1800s, Faulkner said. The feral descendants are
smaller, hairier and occasionally tusked.</TE>
<TE>   Park service officials have been developing a plan to kill the
pigs for about two years, in cooperation with the Nature Conservancy,
which owns 75% of Santa Cruz Island. The eradication is part of a
process that includes trapping golden eagles that prey on the pigs,
bringing back native bald eagles and launching a captive breeding
program for the island fox.</TE>
<TE>   Four alternatives for eliminating the pigs were explored in the
environmental study. The option preferred by the park service calls
for dividing the 65,000-acre island into six hunting zones, separated
by 45 miles of chain-link fence.</TE>
<TE>   An outside contractor will be hired to hunt and shoot the pigs
zone by zone, until they are eradicated, Faulkner said. The fences
will prevent the pigs from moving into a zone that already has been
cleared. Hunters will be aided by walk-in traps placed in each zone.</TE>
<TE>   She said the method was effective on Santa Rosa Island during a
pig-eradication project about 10 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Fencing the island will cost about $2 million, Faulkner said, with
an eradication contract likely costing an additional $4 million to $5
million. Officials hope to begin hunting this spring.</TE>
<TE>   Some animal-rights advocates are appalled by the process.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Markarian, executive vice president of the New York-based
Fund for Animals, said there are more humane ways to kill feral pigs
than by catching them in traps and shooting them.</TE>
<TE>   "The National Park Service simply has a knee-jerk reaction to any
species they consider not native," said Markarian, who sued the park
service last year over its plan to rid Anacapa Island of black rats.
"It's an agencywide vendetta against exotic animals."</TE>
<TE>   According to the park service report, officials studied
alternatives such as death by lethal injection or the introduction of
swine diseases, but none were found as effective as "a well-placed
gunshot."</TE>
<TE>   "These other methods could also inflict more pain and suffering to
the pigs," the report said.</TE>

<TE>   The omnivorous pigs also compete with the fox for food.</TE>

tend to rise above the resources available."</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, the animals have been blamed for spreading seeds of
the invasive fennel plant, which covers more than 10% of the island.
Fennel provides cover for the pigs and crowds out endangered plant
species.</TE>
<TE>   In the last century, ranching, hunting and other human enterprises
have threatened to undermine the natural and cultural resources on
the island, the largest in the chain that makes up Channel Islands
National Park off the Ventura County coast.</TE>
<TE>   Domestic pigs were introduced to the island by a Santa Barbara
rancher in the mid-1800s, Faulkner said. The feral descendants are
smaller, hairier and occasionally tusked. They can number as many as
4,000 when food is plentiful, biologists say.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A $2.5-million plan to dredge the Petaluma River is threatened by
federal concerns over wiping out pickerelweed plants that shelter an
endangered species of mouse.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said a solution will be found
to allow dredging to begin on time by month's end. But if they're
wrong, the Army Corps of Engineers will lose its congressional
authorization to spend the money to dredge the river.</LD>
<LD>   The portion of the river between the downtown turning basin and
Schollenberger Park hasn't been dredged in six years.</LD>
<TE>   Corps of Engineers' standards call for dredging every four years,
said Mike Ban, interim director of Petaluma's Department of Water
Resources and Conservation.</TE>

<LD>The body of a man headed to his hometown in Mexico for burial took an
unexpected detour and ended up in Greece.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of finding family patriarch Robert Castaneda, 68, in the
casket that arrived in Apatzingan, relatives found the body of an
African American man with a cigar and a book with a picture of the
World Trade Center on the cover.</LD>
<LD>   The family had raised $8,000 to pay travel and burial expenses and

<DL></DL>
<LD>Yosemite National Park is headed for its sixth straight year of
decreased attendance.</LD>
<LD>   Officials blame the slowing economy and the events of Sept. 11.
Nearby business owners, who rely on tourism, said the drop could be
caused by increased entrance fees, media coverage of the Cary Stayner
triple-murder case and natural calamities.</LD>
<LD>   So far this year, more than 1.8 million people have visited
Yosemite--down nearly 41,000 from the same time last year, according
to statistics kept by park officials.</LD>
<TE>   Projections for all of 2002 are about 3.4 million, down from more
than 3.5 million in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Attendance first began declining in 1997, after floods wiped out
nearly 400 campsites in Yosemite Valley and 220 Yosemite Lodge rooms.
That year, entrance fees were raised from $5 to $20.</TE>

<LD>Bankrupt growers who received an unusual congressional aid package
were given incorrect payments, federal investigators say.</LD>
<LD>   An audit of the Tri Valley Growers and Agriculture Department
officials found that nearly half of the growers received incorrect
funds. Most were given more than they were due, although some
received less.</LD>
<LD>   The mistakes, which exceeded $300,000, were uncovered by the
Agriculture Department's Office of Inspector General. The
department's Farm Service Agency handled the payments.</LD>
<TE>   "We agree that FSA must either collect back overpayments or
disburse underpayments to eligible peach growers that participated in
the program," said Bradley Karmen, the Agriculture Department's
acting deputy administrator.</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Creditors have filed two lawsuits against City Councilman Babatunde
Folayemi alleging that he owes at least $17,000 in loans that he
partly used to buy a BMW. He hasn't made any payments and has said he
forgot to pay his bills.</LD>
<LD>   Folayemi, 62, blames his money troubles on the $9,600-a-year
stipend paid council members. By comparison, members of the Los
Angeles City Council get $139,476.</LD>
<LD>   Compounding the problem is that he is helping to pay for his wife
to attend medical school and divinity school, Folayemi said. He also
helps his son, who attends graduate school.</LD>

<HD>L.A. Behind in Fight for Funds, Study Finds</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles lags many smaller California cities in the competition
for state and federal funds, according to a study underwritten by
secession backers.</LD>
<LD>   Breakup advocates seized on the results of the study, released
Monday, as evidence that the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood would
be more efficient if they split from Los Angeles. Secession
opponents, however, denounced the study as biased.</LD>
<LD>   Conducted by the Rose Institute of State and Local Government at
Claremont McKenna College, the study also concluded that Los Angeles'
redevelopment efforts are "heavily focused" on downtown and that less
money is spent per capita on policing the San Fernando Valley than
the rest of the city.</LD>
<TE>   The study found that more than half the cities in Los Angeles
County earn more sales tax per capita than the city of Los Angeles
does. "Other Los Angeles County cities have clearly created a more
successful retail sales environment," the 231-page report said.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Katz, a former state assemblyman now leading the Valley
secession campaign, said that the study proved that a Valley city
would do as well or better than a united Los Angeles. He said it also
debunked arguments by Mayor James K. Hahn, who is leading the
anti-secession drive, that the city's clout would diminish after a
breakup. "The mayor has got to be hard-pressed to make the clout
argument after this," Katz said. "It shows that the clout argument
against secession is a figment of his imagination."</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Mayor Matt Middlebrook declined to comment on specific
findings, saying the mayor's office would like to review the study
first. "Clearly the people who are financing it have an agenda and
that is to break up the city," Middlebrook said.</TE>
<TE>   The study was partly financed by the San Fernando Valley Civic
Foundation, a pro-secession organization formed by Studio City
attorney David Fleming and Valley car dealer Bert Boeckmann. Robert
Scott, a member of the secession group Valley VOTE, was project
coordinator of the study.</TE>
<TE>   The study found that despite Los Angeles' population, it garners
less state financing per capita than most other large California
cities, including San Francisco, Sacramento, Long Beach, Oakland, San
Diego and San Jose. In Los Angeles County alone, the city ranked 38th
out of 88 cities in 1998-99.</TE>
<TE>   Per capita, Los Angeles ranked 8th in the county in attracting
federal funds. It received much less than Santa Monica, Hawthorne and
Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   That suggests that Los Angeles' clout does not match its size,
according to study author Steven B. Frates, a senior fellow at the
Rose Institute who is also a Times contributing columnist.</TE>

<HD>Prosecutor's Slaying Is a Mystery</HD>
<DH>Crime: Kern County authorities seek answers in the stabbing
death of Stephen Tauzer, a key figure in D.A.'s office.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN JOHNSON and MARK ARAX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>BAKERSFIELD</DL>
<LD>In the long day after Assistant Dist. Atty. Stephen M. Tauzer was
found stabbed to death at his well-tended home in the suburbs here,
his friends and former colleagues are turning to the possibility that
it was Tauzer's personal life--and not his career fighting
crime--that may have gotten him killed.</LD>
<LD>   In the legal community where Tauzer spent nearly 30 years
reshaping the district attorney's office with his skills as a top
prosecutor, computer programmer and grant writer, his slaying has
baffled the lawyers and judges who knew him best.</LD>
<LD>   Their immediate impulse was to consider the long list of criminals
Tauzer had sent to prison, as well as his most recent investigation
of civic corruption in the small, raucous town of Arvin about 35
miles south of here.</LD>
<TE>   But then came word that the killer had entered Tauzer's house
without force. His friends and former colleagues now wonder if the
murder had something to do with his personal life.</TE>
<TE>   They say Tauzer, 57, a roly-poly man who never married and had a
laid-back and rumpled style even in the courtroom, was known to reach
out to people in trouble. As second in command of the office, he
helped build the child-support division until it was spun off into a
separate county department last year.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm extremely upset that someone would subject such a gentle man
to such a violent death," said Bob Carbone, a defense attorney who
came up through the ranks of the district attorney's office, where
Tauzer mentored him. "Yes, he put some stone-cold killers behind
bars, but lots of prosecutors do that and they rarely become victims
of homicide.</TE>
<TE>   "Murders like this, it's either someone you know or a relative."</TE>
<TE>   When Kern County Dist. Atty. Ed Jagels got the call Sunday
afternoon that his top prosecutor was found dead at his home, Jagels
thought he knew why.</TE>
<TE>   Tauzer, who barely had survived a heart attack two years ago,
looked so ill a few months back that Jagels drove him to the hospital
and had him admitted.</TE>
<TE>   But as Jagels pulled up to Tauzer's block in the suburbs northwest
of town, he saw the police cars and yellow tape and knew that his
longtime friend had met another end. The man he described as the
"most able attorney I have ever worked with" was lying in a pool of
blood on the floor of his garage, the victim of a fatal stabbing to
the head.</TE>
<TE>   "I was flabbergasted," Jagels said Monday. "He had a breadth of
talent that was remarkable."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said an unidentified friend went to Tauzer's house
around 3 p.m. Sunday after not hearing from him for a few days. The
friend noticed the garage door was open and found Tauzer dead on the
floor with a stab wound to the head and other trauma. A knife was
found at the scene. Police said he had died one to three days
earlier, and there were no signs of forced entry and nothing appeared
to have been taken.</TE>
<TE>   "We are focused, we are dedicated and we are going to arrest the
suspect or suspects responsible for the death of Assistant Dist.
Atty. Steve Tauzer," Kern County Sheriff Carl Sparks said. "I make
that commitment to you now.''</TE>
<TE>   Tauzer, who grew up on a farm in Woodland as the oldest of 14
children, graduated from the UC Davis School of Law and joined the
district attorney's office in 1975. From the onset, longtime
co-workers say, he made a mark with his keen grasp of legal issues,
his gentlemanly manner and his bulldog approach to prosecuting bad
guys.</TE>
<TE>   "Often in a criminal trial where the stakes are so high, there's
lots of rancor and bitterness between prosecutors and defense
attorneys, but not with Stephen," said defense attorney Tim Lemucchi,
who squared off against Tauzer more than once. "He was very hard
nosed, and when he got his teeth in your pant leg, he wouldn't let
go. But never did he stop being a gentleman."</TE>
<TE>   It was part of his manner, they said, to appear disorganized and
to poke fun at himself for his supposed failings, such as not being
able to locate the right file or know how to operate a video
projector. But often, he used his apparent bumbling to his advantage.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1995 prosecution of alleged killer Offord Rollins, a
star high school athlete, Tauzer kept hitting the wrong button on the
projector. Each time he did, however, the photo of the victim's
battered corpse came up on the courtroom screen, leading to a charge
of prosecutorial misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last year, Tauzer had led the county's investigation into
misuse of public funds in the tiny town of Arvin. The grand jury,
with evidence presented by Tauzer, has indicted the police chief and
a city councilman on public corruption charges.</TE>
<TE>   Police said they are dismissing no theories at the outset.
"Anything is open at this point," said Sheriff's Cmdr. Martin
Williamson. "I won't dismiss anything."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>After listening to hours of emotional testimony from residents, the
Mission Viejo City Council on Monday backed down from adopting a
measure that would have been one of the toughest anti-smoking
ordinances in the nation.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal would have prohibited smoking in all city buildings,
grounds and public parks. Using tobacco would have been outlawed
inside city-owned cars and any property leased by the city, including
the local YMCA.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, the council voted 3 to 2 to have city staff draft a
less-restrictive ordinance that is limited to state law, which
prohibits smoking in public buildings and on public playgrounds, but
allows smoking in parks.</LD>
<TE>   "I'll do anything I can to support public health within the bounds
of fairness for all concerned, but this goes beyond what state law
requires, and I will not be supporting this ordinance," said
Councilman William S. Craycraft, who voted in favor of re-drafting
the ordinance.</TE>
<TE>   Council members Craycraft, Gail Reavis and John Paul Ledesma voted
in favor of considering a less-restrictive smoking ban. Mayor Susan
Withrow and Councilwoman Sherri M. Butterfield voted in favor of the
tougher ordinance. A final debate and vote on the ordinance is
expected in a few weeks.Monday's hearing lasted well into the
evening, with most Mission Viejo residents testifying in favor of the
ban. Critics charged that the council was going too far, taking on
the role of "Big Brother" by trying to legislate personal behavior.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a smoker and I smoke like a chimney. I will adapt, just like
I have with every other smoking ordinance," said Michelle Clark, 40,
who spoke in favor of the restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   "To ensure good quality life for other residents is a good thing.
Smoking is a bad thing, I know it."</TE>
<TE>   Hamid Bahadori, who doesn't smoke, said he objected to the
proposed prohibition, telling council members that they were
overstepping their authority.</TE>

overstepping their authority. "The role of government is to provide a
balance between social welfare and individual freedom. This ordinance
tilts that balance."</TE>
<TE>   California bans smoking in the workplace, as well as inside bars
and restaurants, and several California cities have imposed stricter
bans on smoking in areas that attract children.</TE>
<TE>   Bob West, a former resident of North Carolina, the country's
biggest tobacco-producing state, said he's happy be living in such a
progressive area.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe smoking is an intrusion on others," he said. "One of
things I like best about California is its nonsmoking stand. This law
would just be one of the many benefits to living in California."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the California Legislature passed a law banning smoking
on playgrounds. A bill that would expand that by outlawing smoking
within 25 feet of playgrounds is before Gov. Gray Davis, according to

<HD>Stayner Is Found Sane in Yosemite Murders</HD>
<DH>Courts: Jury rejects defense claim that the motel handyman
was insane when he killed three tourists. Decision means he is
eligible for the death penalty.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>Convicted Yosemite killer Cary Stayner was sane when he murdered
three park tourists in 1999, jurors said Monday, clearing the way for
them to determine whether he is sentenced to death or spends the rest
of his life in prison.</LD>
<LD>   Jurors took less than four hours to reject the defense claim that
the former motel handyman was insane and unable to understand what he
was doing, or that it was wrong to murder the three Yosemite National
Park tourists.</LD>
<LD>   The same jurors convicted Stayner last month of murdering Carole
Sund, 42, of Eureka; her daughter, Juli, 15; and their friend Silvina
Pelosso, 16, of Argentina, while they were staying at the lodge where
he worked outside the park.</LD>
<TE>   Jurors now will begin the penalty phase of the case against
Stayner, 41, who already is serving a life sentence for murdering
park naturalist Joie Ruth Armstrong.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said proof of Stayner's sanity was his confession to
the FBI, in which he detailed his methodical and elaborate efforts to
cover his tracks.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutor George Williamson said Stayner's efforts to cover up
the crimes showed a consciousness of guilt, which was a direct sign
that he knew the crimes were wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "People who kill like this defendant are not normal," Williamson
said in his closing argument. "He obviously has issues."</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Marcia Morrissey said a legacy of family mental
disorders, a troubled childhood and voices that Stayner said told him
to "do the job" should have convinced jurors that he was insane.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing that screams loudest from the beginning to the end of
this case is that the crimes are the result of a mental disease or
defect," Morrissey told jurors. "These were senseless acts, they were
bizarre acts."</TE>
<TE>   Shortly before reaching the verdict, the jury listened to a
portion of the trial transcript in which defense expert Dr. Alison
McInnes said on cross-examination that two other doctors had found
Stayner sane.</TE>
<TE>   Stayner confessed to killing the trio while they were staying at
rustic Cedar Lodge in El Portal. The disappearance of the three in
February 1999 received worldwide attention.</TE>
<TE>   The crime was unsolved for nearly six months until Stayner struck
again, snatching Armstrong, 26, and beheading her near her cabin in
the park in July 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Stayner told FBI interrogators that he had fantasized for months
about sexually assaulting young girls and then killing them.</TE>
<TE>   On the night of Feb. 15, 1999, he said he saw "easy prey" through
the open blinds of Room 509 at Cedar Lodge.</TE>
<TE>   With his killing "kit," which included a gun, knife, rope and duct
tape, Stayner pretended to check for a leak. He then pulled his gun,
telling the three he was desperate and needed their car.</TE>
<TE>   Stayner described how he "nonchalantly" strangled Carole Sund
while the girls were bound and gagged in the bathroom.</TE>
<TE>   He dumped Sund's body in the trunk of her rental car and later
strangled Pelosso.</TE>
<TE>   Stayner repeatedly tried to rape Juli Sund throughout the night,
but was hindered by impotence.</TE>
<TE>   Early the next morning, he drove her to Lake Don Pedro, a
reservoir in the Sierra foothills, where he sexually assaulted her
again. He said he loved her and then slashed her throat and covered
her body in brush.</TE>
<TE>   Stayner ditched the rental car, with the bodies of Carole Sund and
Pelosso in it, off a rural highway and later returned and torched it.</TE>
<TE>   He told investigators that he wasn't upset about what he had done,
and was only concerned about getting to work on time.</TE>

<HD>Freeways Are Perilous for Stranded Drivers</HD>
<DH>A decline in pedestrian fatalities is attributed to patrols
and the use of cell phones. A disabled car cannot always be found.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Maria Nunez and two friends were cruising along the Long Beach
Freeway a few months ago, returning home from a long night of
clubbing, when her car stalled two lanes from the center divider.</LD>
<LD>   In the early morning darkness, Nunez, 32, and her pals scrambled
out of the car and onto the center divider, a haven from the cars and
trucks that whizzed by at dizzying speeds.</LD>
<LD>   But then Nunez made a fatal mistake. According to police, she
tried to dash back to her car to retrieve her purse and was struck by
a motorist zipping by at about 65 mph. She died at the scene.</LD>
<TE>   Freeway deaths such as Nunez's are a sad part of life in a region
with one of the most extensive and most crowded freeway systems in
the nation. But the good news is there seems to be a decline in
pedestrian deaths on freeways, a decline that experts attribute to
the work of freeway service patrol trucks and the proliferation of
cellular telephones.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, 14 people were killed walking in freeway traffic in Los
Angeles County, down from 37 deaths in 1993, according to the Los
Angeles County coroner's office. Many of those victims were stranded
motorists who were killed scrambling to get help or to make a quick
repair on a narrow freeway shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   According to the coroner's office, the freeway locations with the
most pedestrian deaths include the Hollywood Freeway at the Vermont
Avenue onramp near Silver Lake, the intersection of the Harbor and
the Santa Monica freeways near the Los Angeles Convention Center, and
the Pomona Freeway near Philips Ranch Road in Diamond Bar.</TE>
<TE>   But some of these deaths have nothing to do with a disabled
vehicle. In fact, puzzled police investigators often find bodies on
the freeway with no corresponding vehicle. Police attribute some of
these deaths to people who stroll onto the freeways drunk, mentally
unstable or suicidal. They die a horrible death at the hands of an
unsuspecting motorist who is left to deal with the trauma of having
killed another human being.</TE>
<TE>   In February, Keo Chumroeum, an 18-year-old college student from
Long Beach, walked onto the Long Beach Freeway about 8 on a Tuesday
night. He was struck and killed by a young man driving in the fast
lane. Chumroeum's car was not on the freeway and an autopsy later
found no traces of drugs or alcohol in his system. Seven months
later, police have yet to determine what prompted the teen to set
foot on the freeway.</TE>
<TE>   "It remains one of those great mysteries," said Long Beach Det.
Ray Dennison, who initially investigated the case.</TE>
<TE>   Another young man was killed last week trying to cross one of the
busiest freeways in the nation--the San Diego Freeway in West Los
Angeles--just after midnight. Police were unable to locate any
vehicle that he may have left.</TE>
<TE>   After the initial impact, the man was run over by several other
motorists who couldn't stop in time or could not see him in the early
morning darkness. Some motorists stopped to call police, but the man
died in the northbound lanes a few minutes after the accident.</TE>
<TE>   California Highway Patrol Sgt. Doug Morgan said such deaths are
not unusual among freeway fatalities. CHP officers often investigate
fatal freeway accidents that involve people who, for whatever reason,
attempt to dash across a busy four-or five-lane freeway in the dark
of night, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, he said, a recent murder victim found on the side of the
freeway was initially believed to be another traffic fatality until
investigators found gunshot wounds, he said. "There are all kinds of
different things happening on the freeway," Morgan said.</TE>
<TE>   For those who end up stranded on freeways due to mechanical
problems, the risk of death and injury has been reduced thanks to an
army of tow trucks that patrol the freeways in Los Angeles and Orange
counties and other Southern California communities.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County alone, 145 freeway service patrol trucks
offer free aid to nearly 1,000 stranded motorists each day. The truck
drivers change tires, fix leaking radiator hoses, provide a
jump-start or a free gallon of gas--whatever it takes to get the car
moving. If nothing else works, the trucks tow the disabled cars to a
nearby service station.</TE>
<TE>   Since the service was launched in Los Angeles County in 1991, the
trucks have provided aid and comfort to nearly 3 million stalled
motorists.</TE>
<TE>   But even the tow truck drivers are not immune to the dangers of
the freeway. In 1999, Ricardo Arturo Hernandez, 24, was killed
helping a stranded motorist on transition from the Golden State
Freeway to the northbound Pasadena Freeway. A driver in a Honda Civic
sideswiped Hernandez and the tow truck and never stopped.</TE>
<TE>   The proliferation of cellular phones also has benefited those
unlucky drivers who find themselves stuck on a crowded freeway, miles
from a service station or a freeway call box.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, an estimated 110 million cellular phones are in use,
about 6 million of them in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   But the explosion of cellular phone use has had its drawbacks: 911
calls from cellular phones have skyrocketed from 29,000 in 1985 to
7.2 million in 2001. CHP officials have trouble answering all those
calls immediately because too many people call 911 for trivial
matters, such as directions to a restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   CHP spokeswoman Anne DaVigo said that in certain parts of the
state such nonemergency calls represent 60% to 70% of all calls to
911. "It's still a big problem," she said.</TE>

<TE>   Follow Safety Tips When in Trouble in Moving Traffic</TE>
<TE>   Every day, thousands of motorists become stranded on crowded
freeways. It is a frightening experience, particularly at night in an
unfamiliar neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   If you end up stranded on a freeway, police and auto safety
experts offer the following tips:</TE>
<TE>   * Try to pull the vehicle to a shoulder or off the freeway
completely, even if it means driving on a flat tire and ruining a set
of rims.</TE>
<TE>   * Try to avoid pulling off into the center divider, which is
usually narrower than the shoulder and puts you and your would-be
rescuers next to the fastest traffic.</TE>
<TE>   * Regardless of where your car stalls, turn on your hazard warning
lights to make your vehicle more visible to oncoming traffic.</TE>
<TE>   * Try to avoid making repairs on the freeway. If you insist on
tinkering with a stalled vehicle, have someone else keep an eye on
oncoming cars while you work. Never turn your back on traffic.</TE>
<TE>   * If you get your car to the shoulder, consider road conditions,
the time of day and the neighborhood where your vehicle has stalled
before deciding whether to get out of the car to find help. If you
decide to stay in the car, keep your seat belt buckled in case an
errant car runs into you from behind.</TE>
<TE>   * If your car stalls in a traffic lane and you have a cell phone,
dial 911 and report your location. Get out of the car and try to get
to the freeway shoulder as safely as possible.</TE>

<HD>Former GE Chief Has 'Met His Match' in Divorce Court</HD>
<DH>Law: Jack Welch's lifestyle is laid bare by a wife seen as
the model of a savvy corporate spouse.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>He was hailed as the Tiger Woods of management, a brilliant business
magician and, as head of General Electric Co., one of the world's
most admired executives. In turn, Jack Welch heaped praise on his
wife, Jane, lauding her in his bestselling autobiography as "the
perfect partner."</LD>
<LD>   Now that they are divorcing, Jane Beasley Welch has become the
most formidable opponent the retired chief executive has encountered.</LD>
<LD>   Thirteen years after they wed on the island of Nantucket, the two
are embroiled in a divorce that promises to be as costly as it is
nasty.</LD>
<TE>   Following disclosure of his affair with the editor of the Harvard
Business Review, the captain of capitalism has been painted as a
ruthless womanizer who let his shareholders pay for just about
everything--right down to the GE light bulbs in his numerous homes.
Jane Beasley Welch has emerged as the modern model of the savvy
corporate wife: so clever that she thought to include an expiration
date in her prenuptial agreement--and stayed married long enough to
pass it.</TE>
<TE>   With perhaps $1 billion at stake, the Welch divorce is a primer on
how wealthy couples uncouple. The case also affords a window into the
benefits that corporations lavish on retired top
executives--everything, in Jack Welch's case, from sports tickets to
the lifetime use of GE-owned jets, with charge accounts at flower
shops and one of New York's most expensive dining establishments
thrown in as well. Mostly, this is a story about how a man who
routinely crushed adversaries when he ran a Fortune 500 empire was
stopped in his tracks by his own wife.</TE>
<TE>   Welch may be tough, shrewd and possessed of a famously competitive
spirit, but, said a New York lawyer who knows Jane Welch well, "I can
tell you this much: Jack Welch has clearly met his match."</TE>
<TE>   The 50-year-old former mergers-and-acquisitions lawyer fired the
first salvo by telephoning the woman who was having an affair with
her husband. Don't you think, Jane Welch reportedly asked Harvard
Business Review Editor Suzy Wetlaufer, that it's inappropriate to
write about someone you're sleeping with? Flaunting a shiny diamond
bracelet given to her by Welch, Wetlaufer, 42, left her job in April,
weeks after she took Jane Welch's call.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Welch, 66, soon announced that he expected an amicable
divorce, with details to remain "personal" and private. For her
attorney, Jane Welch chose William Zabel, who specializes in keeping
the details of high-profile divorces (such as those of novelist
Michael Crichton and philanthropist George Soros) personal and
private.</TE>
<TE>   Then Jack Welch filed for divorce in Connecticut, one of four
states where the couple have residences. Assets in Connecticut
divorces are divided under a policy called equitable distribution,
which does not guarantee a 50-50 split. Welch's former colleague,
ex-GE Capital Chief Gary Wendt, was forced to pay his wife, Lorna,
$20 million when they split up in Connecticut several years ago. That
amount was a fraction of Wendt's net worth--but twice what he
originally offered.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Welch's intentions to keep things private, Jane Welch
filed an affidavit in Bridgeport, Conn., outlining the couple's
"extraordinary" standard of living--much of it compliments of General
Electric. The next day, the New York Times ran a long article
describing how GE pays for the apartment the Welches occupied on
Central Park West, membership fees at five country clubs and full
staffs and services at homes in Florida, New York, Connecticut and
Massachusetts.</TE>
<TE>   By Monday, the Securities and Exchange Commission had begun an
informal inquiry into Welch's compensation agreement. Welch himself
penned a column in Monday's Wall Street Journal revealing that he
offered last week to give up many of his retirement benefits--and the
GE board accepted.</TE>
<TE>   "In these times when public confidence and trust have been shaken,
I've learned the hard way that perception matters more than ever,"
Welch wrote. "In this environment, I don't want a great company with
the highest integrity dragged into a public fight because of my
divorce proceedings."</TE>
<TE>   Welch earned $16.7 million at GE in 2000, his last full year of
employment. In retirement, he receives $86,000 per year as a
consultant for 30 days' work. For each additional day of consulting
after that, GE pays Welch $17,307.</TE>
<TE>   As CEO, Welch built his company's market value by more than $450
billion over 20 years. His generous retirement package was
unanimously approved by the GE board in 1996, but the company was not
required to disclose Welch's long list of benefits. Many retired
executives often are rewarded with cushy consulting contracts and
perks such as cars and drivers. But prime seats at Red Sox, Yankees
and Knicks games, and Wimbledon tickets--all part of Welch's
deal--are considered unusual.</TE>
<TE>   Jane Welch revealed in her affidavit that her husband canceled
their joint credit cards and slashed her monthly support to $35,000,
"which [she] has accepted under protest, as such funds are patently
inadequate to maintain the marital standard of living as set forth
herein."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the document continues, Jane Welch's "known monthly
expenses," which make up "only a small portion" of the couple's
monthly spending, are $126,820. But that figure fails to take into
account her use of jets supplied by GE, with a monthly value of
$291,667. Her affidavit states that if she is denied access to the
couple's "marital real estate," the monthly figure leaps again--to
$634,487.</TE>
<TE>   "This amount is far less than the actual marital cost and standard
of living, as the great bulk of marital expenses are provided by GE
or are paid by plaintiff," according to the document.</TE>
<TE>   For some perspective, the affidavit mentions that in the course of
their 13-year marriage, the couple spent more than $32 million on
real estate and furnishings.</TE>
<TE>   GE chipped in an additional $7.5 million for furnishings and
capital expenditures, according to the document.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Welch's lawyer, Samuel Schoonmaker III, complained in court
last week about the publicity the case has garnered. Schoonmaker did
not respond to an interview request.</TE>
<TE>   A call to Welch's representative at IMG Speakers, which books his
speaking engagements, also was not returned.</TE>
<TE>   A representative for William Zabel laughed when asked if Jane
Welch was available for an interview. Zabel's only comment was, "the
papers speak for themselves."</TE>
<TE>   So, as a rule, does Jack Welch. His book "Jack: Straight From the
Gut" describes a happy childhood in Salem, Mass. His father was a
train conductor. His mother, a devout Catholic, doted on her only
child. Welch studied engineering at the University of Massachusetts,
then headed to the University of Illinois for a master's degree. One
day he decided he liked the sound of the title "Dr." in front of
someone else's name. He signed on for a PhD.</TE>
<TE>   "He had a lot of drive--more so than others, definitely," said his
thesis advisor, chemical engineering professor Jim Westwater, 82.</TE>
<TE>   But Westwater, who still lives near the university, said he was
surprised to watch Welch become his department's most famous chemical
engineering doctorate. "He was not the brightest that I had,"
Westwater said, adding, "he was more driven than bright."</TE>
<TE>   The autobiography devotes exactly two paragraphs to Welch's 1987
divorce after 28 years from his first wife, Carolyn, mother of his
four children. (Jane and Jack Welch have no children.)</TE>
<TE>   Around GE at the time, "you never heard anything about his first
divorce," said Dick McClean, an Arizona environmental consultant who
worked with Welch in a plastics division at GE.</TE>
<TE>   "It was in everybody's best interest to make sure that it was all
tuned down," McClean said.</TE>
<TE>   McClean stressed that "I have a tremendous amount of respect for
Jack. He's a genius. He has an enormous amount of courage. He's
willing to take things forward, and do things that are
unconventional."</TE>
<TE>   But "his private life was always what was absolutely incredible,"
McClean said. He declined to elaborate, saying only that when he
heard about Welch's relationship with the editor of the Harvard
Business Review, "my instant reaction was, oops, Jack's back to his
old ways."</TE>
<TE>   At the University of Arizona, legal ethics professor Marianne M.
Jennings has spent seven years studying Welch and GE as part of her
research for a book on the only 15 American companies that have paid
dividends without interruption for at least 100 years.</TE>
<TE>   Welch, Jennings said, "is an enigma. There is that Neutron Jack
side," so named because he was said to be able to destroy the people
in a building while leaving the walls standing.</TE>
<TE>   "But there is also a sensitive side," she continued. "On the one
hand you read about this harsh management environment. On the other
hand, you will find that he will take the time to send a personal
note to an employee."</TE>
<TE>   Jennings said Welch not only kept a tight grip at GE--"a company
that traded on its 'good things for life' image, when in reality,
over half of their business is just lending"--but he also enthralled
the business press, including the Harvard Business Review.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone was star-struck by Jack Welch," she said.</TE>
<TE>   After his divorce from Carolyn, Welch embarked on a social
whirlwind.</TE>
<TE>   The dating frenzy stopped when friends introduced him to a lawyer
at the New York firm of Shearman &amp; Sterling. Welch wrote that he was
immediately attracted to a "bright, tough, witty" woman roughly 17
years his junior with down-to-earth roots from small-town Alabama.</TE>
<TE>   Before school in Pratt Station, Ala., young, red-haired Jane
Beasley used to pick sugar beans. She graduated from a nearby state
university, then headed to law school at the University of Kentucky.
One of her early projects as a lawyer was to work on Standard Oil of
California's $13.4-billion acquisition of Gulf Oil.</TE>
<TE>   As Mrs. Jack Welch, she gave up her career.</TE>
<TE>   She worked with her personal trainer and made trips to the
hairdresser (enumerated in her affidavit), and she took up golf and
took on charity projects.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking in her soft, Southern accent at board meetings, "she was
not afraid of tough questions. You could see a column of steel down
her middle," said a lawyer who served with her but did not want to be
identified. "She lived like the socially active corporate wife,
clearly very used to comfort. She is also steely and determined."</TE>
<TE>   Jane Beasley negotiated her own prenuptial agreement, inserting a
clause that made it void after 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   It was none other than Warren Buffett who likened Welch to Tiger
Woods, the golf sensation. Sony Chairman and CEO Nobuyuki Idei called
Welch a "brilliant business magician."</TE>
<TE>   Welch, anointed by Fortune magazine as both "the toughest boss in
America" and "manager of the 20th century," once stated in an
interview that "the higher a monkey climbs, the more his [backside]
is exposed."</TE>
<TE>   He also has made no secret of his penchant for reading gossip
columns.</TE>
<TE>   Now he has climbed high, his finances are on display and his name
is filling gossip pages.</TE>
<TE>   "Jane Welch is strong and measured, and she knows the company
can't handle this for too long," said Jennings, the ethicist. "He was
the CEO. Everyone deferred to him for so long. They trusted Jack, and
now he's looking a little on the edge here."</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>Secretary-General Kofi Annan called for a war on AIDS and the
promotion of girls' education as the world body focused Monday on
what one African leader called extricating "Africa out of her long
night of misery."</LD>
<LD>   Launching debate on a new development plan, Annan proposed
stronger work to keep Africa from slipping into an irretrievable
abyss.</LD>
<LD>   "Combating HIV/AIDS and promoting girls' education are
particularly central," Annan said. "The HIV/AIDS pandemic has become
the greatest threat to Africa's development."</LD>
<TE>   Top officials from about 80 countries, including 10 African heads
of state, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and Canadian Prime
Minister Jean Chretien, gathered to flesh out details of the new
development plan at an all-day special session of the 190-nation U.N.
General Assembly.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting focused on the New Partnership for Africa's
Development, or NEPAD, an initiative launched by 15 African countries
in Nigeria a year ago to give African development fresh momentum and
a new foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Spearheaded by South Africa, Nigeria, Algeria and Senegal, NEPAD
hopes to ensure good political and economic governance in exchange
for more investment, better trade access and more debt relief from
wealthy nations.</TE>
<TE>   "We are committed to translate our words into a practical program
that actually changes the lives of the masses of Africa away from
despair to a common future of hope and human dignity," South African
President Thabo Mbeki said as the session got underway.</TE>
<TE>   "We seek to ensure that we move away from the donor-recipient
relationship with the developed world to a new partnership based on
mutual respect as well as shared responsibility and accountability."</TE>
<TE>   NEPAD is modeled on the U.S. Marshall Plan, which rebuilt Europe
after World War II. Its goal is to attract billions of dollars in
annual investment to revive ailing economies, fight ravaging diseases
like AIDS and malaria and ease the poverty blighting Africa.</TE>
<TE>   But its success depends as well on African governments themselves
rooting out corruption and working to bring an end to their many
wars.</TE>

<HD>Singapore Holding 21 More Suspected Terrorists</HD>
<DH>Asia: Government says several men taken into custody last
month were trained at Al Qaeda camps. Others allegedly scouted
bombing targets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD C. PADDOCK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JAKARTA, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>The government of Singapore said Monday that it had arrested 21
suspected terrorists, including some who were trained at Al Qaeda
camps and several who conducted reconnaissance of potential bombing
targets in the island nation.</LD>
<LD>   The arrests add to evidence of terrorist activity in Southeast
Asia amid mounting concerns that the Al Qaeda terrorist network is
planning new attacks on U.S. embassies, warships and other targets in
the region.</LD>
<LD>   Nineteen of the detainees are current or former members of Jemaah
Islamiah, an organization linked to Al Qaeda that planned seven
suicide truck bombings of high-profile targets in Singapore late last
year, the Ministry of Home Affairs said.</LD>
<TE>   "These latest arrests have seriously disrupted the JI [Jemaah
Islamiah] network in Singapore," the ministry said in a
four-paragraph statement. "There is no known imminent security threat
from other JI elements in Singapore."</TE>
<TE>   All the detainees are Singaporeans, and some traveled to
Afghanistan for Al Qaeda training, the government said. The arrests
occurred in August, it said. The detainees' names were not released.</TE>
<TE>   Two of those in custody were associated with the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front, an extremist group in the southern Philippines,
authorities said. Some of the detainees trained at a location on
Mindanao island run by the organization and known as Camp Abu Bakar,
the officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Singapore said the arrests resulted from the continuing
investigation of last year's plot by Jemaah Islamiah to blow up the
seven targets, including the U.S., British, Australian and Israeli
embassies.</TE>
<TE>   Thirteen alleged members of the group, including some of its
leaders, were arrested last year and have been ordered incarcerated
for at least two years. Under Singapore's strict Internal Security
Act, they can be held indefinitely without trial.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said some of the new detainees were following orders
issued by Jemaah Islamiah leaders who were arrested last year. It was
unclear whether the detainees were involved in a new bombing scheme
or are accused of assisting in last year's plot.</TE>
<TE>   It also was unclear whether the arrests were linked to an alleged
Al Qaeda bomb threat that prompted the United States to shut down a
number of its embassies in Southeast Asia last week. The embassies in
Indonesia and Malaysia reopened Monday under tight security. The
embassy in Singapore, which is heavily fortified, did not close.</TE>
<TE>   A suspected leader of last year's bomb plot, an Al Qaeda member
initially identified as "Sammy," was arrested earlier this year in
Oman after Singaporean police issued an alert to security agencies
around the world. He is now believed to be in U.S. custody in an
undisclosed location. Authorities would not say whether he provided
information that led to the arrest of any of the Singaporeans.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of the planned operation last year, he was using a
Canadian passport that identified him as Jabarah Mohammed Mansour, a
20-year-old of Kuwaiti origin. One of his jobs was to arrange for
foreign suicide bombers to carry out the attacks, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Sammy' was the leading and directing figure in the plan to bomb
several targets in Singapore including the U.S. and Israeli
embassies," the Ministry of Home Affairs said in an earlier
statement.</TE>
<TE>   About 20 Jemaah Islamiah members escaped in December, Senior
Minister Lee Kuan Yew said earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   Singapore and Malaysia have said for months that the head of
Jemaah Islamiah is Abu Bakar Bashir, an Islamic cleric who lives
freely in Indonesia. He denies any role in terrorist activity, and
Indonesian authorities say they have no evidence he has committed any
crime. The U.S. is expected soon to include Jemaah Islamiah on its
list of terrorist organizations, which could increase the pressure on
Indonesia to move against Bashir.</TE>
<TE>   The warning that Al Qaeda operatives planned to bomb U.S.
embassies in Southeast Asia around the time of the Sept. 11
anniversary came from Omar Faruq, a Kuwaiti who was arrested by
Indonesian agents in June and handed over to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say he recently began talking and has provided a
wealth of information. They say he has told interrogators that he was
Al Qaeda's link to Southeast Asian terror groups.</TE>
<TE>   Time magazine reported this week that it had obtained a CIA report
of confessions from Faruq. According to the prisoner, he and several
accomplices twice planned to assassinate Indonesian President
Megawati Sukarnoputri but both plots went awry.</TE>
<TE>   The magazine said Faruq also told investigators that Bashir was
eager to get involved with Al Qaeda and that he authorized Jemaah
Islamiah operatives to participate in bombings.</TE>

<LD>Officials plan to enforce a new dress code for scantily clad women
who sell betel nut at more than 1,000 roadside stands in the northern
county of Taoyuan, a police spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   Starting Oct. 15, the women--called la meizi, or "spice girls" in
local slang--won't be allowed to wear transparent or belly-revealing
tops. Skimpy skirts and shorts are also out. "It's just too easy for
drivers to have accidents as they turn to gawk at the women. We've
already had many crashes," he said.</LD>

<HD>Swede With Gun to Remain in Custody</HD>
<DH>Court: Prosecutors are still preparing charges against man
suspected of plotting a hijacking.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>VAESTERAAS, Sweden</DL>
<LD>A court ruled Monday that a man suspected of planning to hijack a
London-bound airliner should remain in custody to give prosecutors
more time to prepare charges.</LD>
<LD>   Chief prosecutor Thomas Haeggstroem said investigators had not yet
determined why Kerim Chatty had a gun as he boarded a flight to
London in August.</LD>
<LD>   Haeggstroem, who had been ordered by the court to file formal
charges by Monday, indicated that it might take a month before he is
ready.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors said they needed more time because of a large number
of witnesses they must hear and other factors.</TE>
<TE>   The district court in Vaesteraas, 60 miles northwest of the
capital, Stockholm, ordered Chatty to remain jailed until Sept. 30 on
preliminary charges of planning to hijack a plane and illegally
possessing a weapon.</TE>
<TE>   Chatty, 29, whose father is Tunisian and mother is Swedish, has
pleaded guilty to illegal possession of a weapon but denies intending
to hijack the plane, said his lawyer, Nils Uggla. Uggla said the
weapons charge alone was not enough to keep him in jail.</TE>
<TE>   But Haeggstroem said the suspect posed a risk of escaping,
destroying evidence or complicating the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Chatty was arrested Aug. 29 at Vaesteraas airport after security
officials found a gun in his carry-on luggage. He was preparing to
board a Ryanair flight on his way to an Islamic conference in
Birmingham, England.</TE>

<HD>Heading Off 'Dirty Bombs'</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>VIENNA</DL>
<LD>U.S. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham called Monday for international
cooperation to fight the threat of "dirty bombs," which would scatter
radioactive material using conventional explosive devices.</LD>
<LD>   In a speech at the annual conference of the International Atomic
Energy Agency here, Abraham said more should be done to prevent
lower-grade nuclear material from falling into the hands of
terrorists attracted by the destructive potential of such weapons.</LD>
<LD>   "While dirty bombs are not comparable to nuclear weapons in
destructiveness, they are far easier to assemble and employ," Abraham
said.</LD>
<TE>   "And while the physical destruction they would cause is comparable
to conventional explosives, the disruption caused by widespread
contamination is far greater. And it is disruption that terrorists
seek," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Abraham said plans found in bunkers in Afghanistan revealed the
interest of the Al Qaeda terrorist network, which Washington blames
for the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States, in making dirty bombs
with the kind of radioactive materials left over from legitimate
uses.</TE>

<HD>Security, Foreign Policy Grip Germans</HD>
<DH>Election: Concerns about an Iraqi war are boosting
incumbent chancellor. But the opposition is gaining from fears of
terrorism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY FLEISHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>Germany's campaign season has veered from high unemployment to
roiling floods to whether the chancellor dyes his hair, and now
voters are navigating the perils of terrorism and the dangers of
joining a U.S. invasion across the deserts of Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   Internal security and foreign policy are increasingly the stuff of
sound bites.</LD>
<LD>   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's reelection chances have soared in
recent days largely because of his promise to keep German soldiers
clear of a U.S.-led "adventure" in the Persian Gulf. But a candidate
in Germany's main opposition party is finding favor with voters with
charges that Schroeder's government suffers from intelligence lapses
and bungling police work in pursuing radical militants.</LD>
<TE>   Germans are worried that terrorist cells--like the one discovered
in Hamburg last year that spawned the Sept. 11 hijackers--are
operating undetected in their cities. The nightly news flickers with
extremist plots: a Turkish man and his American fiancee arrested near
Heidelberg for allegedly planning to bomb a U.S. Army base, a
Syrian-German clothier questioned on suspicion of laundering money
for the Al Qaeda terrorist network, and a bogus tip about an Egyptian
with an explosive in a Hamburg mosque.</TE>
<TE>   Like many things in modern Germany, issues of war and security are
complicated by the country's Nazi past. Germans want tougher laws
against Islamic militants but at the same time are careful not to
single out ethnic or religious groups. They reluctantly support their
army's role in Afghanistan but recoil at the prospect of marshaling
it in a war to topple Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   "Germans are deeply concerned about terrorist activities within
Germany," said Oliver Thraenert, a security analyst in Berlin. "But
the same guy who is very conservative against allowing foreigners
into the country would also be against the German army participating
in a war against Iraq. This is the difference between Germany and
America."</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder's rivals accuse him of unwisely straining relations with
Washington and of using Iraq to skirt Germany's most pressing
problem--4 million unemployed. But polls show that voters are
rallying around his message as many Germans view America as an
arrogant cowboy with an itchy finger on a big gun. The daily Berliner
Zeitung wrote last week that the Bush administration's talk of war is
a "megalomaniacal attempt" to do the unimaginable.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly moribund three months ago, Schroeder's campaign was first
resuscitated by his handling of the German floods in August. Another
big boost came last week with his forceful opposition to an invasion
of Iraq. The chancellor and his left-of-center Social Democratic
Party have jumped between 12 and 15 percentage points in the polls
and have pulled slightly ahead of challenger Edmund Stoiber and his
conservative Christian Social Union and its Christian Democratic
Union allies. Stoiber has been strong on economic issues but murky
and noncommittal on his Iraq policy leading up to Sunday's election.</TE>
<TE>   In a speech Friday, Stoiber, aware that his once-commanding lead
had slipped away, blamed Schroeder for playing "politics with
people's fears. This is not a decision about whether there will be
German troops in Iraq. It is about whether one can divert attention
from a miserable economy."</TE>
<TE>   Many German political analysts are surprised that Schroeder is so
strongly defying the U.S. over Iraq. Some say that his stance
represents a blatant grab for votes and that he will reverse himself
after the election. Others view it as a political gamble that marks
Germany's independence in foreign policy, leaving the chancellor
little room to maneuver in coming months if he is pressured by the
West to join a military coalition against Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Germans believe Schroeder won't plunge them into war, but they are
less convinced that their federal and state governments are
protecting them against terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last year, Germany has passed tougher immigration laws
and made it easier to extradite foreigners and investigate suspected
militants and their financiers. Police have followed up on hundreds
of tips and launched dozens of raids, including on mosques and
religious centers.</TE>
<TE>   But there have been law enforcement mistakes. U.S. authorities,
for example, alerted German police in July that a Turkish man, Osman
Petmezci, and his American-born fiancee, Astrid Eyzaguirre, allegedly
were planning a Sept. 11 anniversary bomb attack on the U.S. base in
Heidelberg. Hamstrung by bureaucracy and poor coordination, German
authorities didn't arrest the couple--who had materials for five pipe
bombs and 287 pounds of chemicals--until Sept. 5.</TE>
<TE>   The arrest came two days after Interior Minister Otto Schily had
assured the public that authorities had tracked 500 terrorism leads
and found no serious threats.</TE>
<TE>   "There is not enough security in Germany," said Sabine Wiedemann,
a secretary from Sankt Augustin near Bonn. "There is too much concern
for personal freedom."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not feeling safe," said Guenter Brockmann, who fears bombings
and avoids taking his family to large public events. "Deportation of
criminals should be handled much stronger."</TE>
<TE>   Although Germany has integration problems, individual freedom and
anti-discrimination have been ingrained in the country since the end
of World War II. But, as they have in the United States, the dangers
of the new century are forcing many Germans to reexamine these
hallmarks. It is an unsettling dilemma for a nation that only
recently has begun to accept the responsibility to help maintain
world security--and for one that has about 3 million Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   Guenther Beckstein, the hawkish interior minister for Bavaria
state, is not shy about where he stands. If Stoiber's coalition
defeats Schroeder's, Beckstein will most likely replace Schily as
federal interior minister. Beckstein is popular among conservative
Germans for blaming the current government for its "hollow words"
against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Beckstein wants to deport suspected militants more quickly. He
also is campaigning to make it illegal to even show admiration for
terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   "There is an increasing number of signs that militant Islamic
circles are active again," he said recently. "There are hints that
people trained by the moujahedeen are trying to recruit new religious
warriors here."</TE>
<TE>   Schily scoffs at Beckstein's rhetoric. He has weathered the year
since the Sept. 11 attacks and has taken criticism from liberal
members of his own party for pushing for stricter laws.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Beckstein wants to shoot down civilian airplanes" that may
stray off course, Schily said. "This is grotesque nonsense....
Germans can trust that everything humanly possible is being done to
ensure security."</TE>

<HD>Vote Rigged, Opposition in Kashmir Says</HD>
<DH>India: Some residents report being kept from polls, others
that they were forced to cast ballots. Officials declare election is
going well.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KRALAPORA, India</DL>
<LD>At polling stations on the back roads of a Kashmir battleground,
opposition supporters complained Monday of intimidation and ballot
rigging on the first day of a critical election. But officials
declared that voting was going well.</LD>
<LD>   The Jammu and Kashmir state election commission dismissed
allegations of widespread irregularities and said overall turnout in
what is the Indian-held portion of the disputed territory was a
respectable 43.6% despite pressure for a boycott from separatists.</LD>
<LD>   There was isolated violence, including a rocket attack that killed
a 12-year-old boy and a hand grenade blast that injured two men. But
that was considered a good day in a territory that has lost up to
60,000 lives in 15 years of conflict.</LD>
<TE>   Voters cast ballots for 23 of 87 state assembly seats Monday.
There will be three more voting days, staggered over the next month
to allow several hundred thousand soldiers and police to guard the
polling stations.</TE>
<TE>   But long before the final results are to be announced, arguments
over what they will mean have already begun.</TE>
<TE>   Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee has acknowledged that
past elections were neither free nor fair in the roughly two-thirds
of Kashmir that India controls, and promised that this one will be
different. Neighboring Pakistan, which has fought two of its three
wars with India over Kashmir, repeated Monday that the election is
flawed and won't solve a conflict that threatens to spark another war
between the nuclear-armed neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   Kupwara district in the northern part of Jammu and Kashmir
includes about 120 miles of the cease-fire line that divides the
Indian and Pakistani portions of Kashmir. The district is a
stronghold of separatist militants battling Indian rule.</TE>
<TE>   On the second floor of the Sheep Husbandry Department's offices in
the tiny village of Karihama, three election officials sat waiting
for voters at midday. They were guarded by more than two dozen
heavily armed soldiers from India's Border Security Force.</TE>
<TE>   An electronic voting machine recorded 115 votes from a district
with 364 registered voters, said Suhail Ahmed, an election official
wearing an army helmet and bulletproof vest in case guerrillas
delivered on their threat to attack.</TE>
<TE>   Troops parked an armored personnel carrier in the middle of the
single-lane road that runs through the village. Just outside the
village, about a dozen people, most of them women, were walking home
from the polling station and complained that they had been forced to
vote in violation of the militants' boycott call. They now feared
punishment from the rebels, said Aziz Rahman, 70.</TE>
<TE>   Indian authorities denied that soldiers or police coerced voters
to cast their ballots despite a boycott by the loose coalition of
separatist parties called the All Party Hurriyat Conference, which
claims widespread support in Jammu and Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   During the last state assembly election, in 1996, when the turnout
was 53.4%, there were reports of "fingernail parades" after the polls
closed. Soldiers and police checked for daubs of indelible ink on
fingernails as proof that people had voted.</TE>
<TE>   In the village of Magam on Monday, residents accused troops from
an army unit that calls itself the "Storm Troopers" of seizing
identity cards and refusing to return them to those without proof
that they had voted. When several hundred villagers protested in the
nearby hamlet of Uchar Magam, soldiers badly beat 15 women and fired
shots in the air to disperse the crowd, said several men, none of
whom would give his name because of fear of retribution.</TE>
<TE>   Other people who did want to vote said they were not being allowed
to. In the village of Kralapora, in a valley carpeted gold by wheat
ready for harvest, more than a hundred angry opposition supporters
accused soldiers of preventing them from voting.</TE>
<TE>   As they shouted and pressed against a battered metal gate guarded
by soldiers, several children who looked much younger than the legal
voting age of 18 were among those inside the compound, waiting for
their turn to vote. They all insisted that they were old enough.</TE>
<TE>   Kralapora is in the district represented by Mir Saifullah of the
ruling pro-India National Conference. Two hours before the end of
voting Monday, Saifullah was inside the voting compound, chatting
with police.</TE>
<TE>   "I've come to see how the polling is going," he said in a brief
interview. "It's OK," he added, denying that the security forces were
meddling in the election in his district.</TE>
<TE>   But a poll worker who refused to be identified whispered that the
legislator had told police to slow down the voting so that few in the
crowd of opposition supporters outside the gate would get a chance to
cast ballots.</TE>
<TE>   Jaifardin Chowdury, son of the local opposition Congress Party
candidate, Salamudin Chowdury, yelled that election officials had
refused to let him vote.</TE>
<TE>   Turnout was strong in another Kupwara village, Dardihaire, the
birthplace of Abdul Ghani Lone, a moderate and popular Kashmiri
separatist leader who was assassinated May 21. Lone had appeared to
be trying behind the scenes to persuade other leaders of the
separatist Hurriyat Conference to take part in the elections.</TE>
<TE>   After a long debate, Lone's supporters decided on the eve of the
vote to cast their ballots for an independent candidate they believed
to be a member of Lone's People's Conference.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a vote against the National Conference," said Mohammed
Said Lone, who is not related to the assassinated leader. "This not
against any freedom struggle or the Hurriyat."</TE>
<TE>   Security forces were behaving properly in the area, and the
militants "have not made any threats here--yet," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Those still calling for a boycott argue that any ballot cast
legitimizes Indian rule over the territory, but Mohammed Said Lone
rejected that argument.</TE>
<TE>   "Just because people are casting votes, it does not help the cause
of India," he insisted. "They should see what is in the hearts of
people. The National Conference can only win if they cheat again."</TE>

<LD>Following is the text of the letter from Iraqi Foreign Minister Naji
Sabri to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan:</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Dear Secretary-General,</LD>
<TE>   I have the honor to refer to the series of discussions held
between Your Excellency and the Government of the Republic of Iraq on
the implementation of relevant Security Council resolutions on the
question of Iraq which took place in New York on 7 March and 2 May
and in Vienna on 4 July 2002, as well as the talks which were held in
your office in New York on 14 and 15 September 2002, with the
participation of the Secretary-General of the League of Arab States.</TE>
<TE>   I am pleased to inform you of the decision of the Government of
the Republic of Iraq to allow the return of the United Nations
weapons inspectors to Iraq without conditions.</TE>
<TE>   The Government of the Republic of Iraq has responded, by this
decision, to your appeal, to the appeal of the Secretary-General of
the League of Arab States, as well as those of Arab, Islamic and
other friendly countries.</TE>
<TE>   The Government of the Republic of Iraq has based its decision
concerning the return of inspectors on its desire to complete the
implementation of the relevant Security Council resolutions and to
remove any doubts that Iraq still possesses weapons of mass
destruction.</TE>
<TE>   This decision is also based on your statement to the General
Assembly on 12 September 2002 that the decision by the Government of
the Republic of Iraq is the indispensable first step towards an
assurance that Iraq no longer possesses weapons of mass destruction
and, equally importantly, towards a comprehensive solution that
includes the lifting of sanctions imposed on Iraq and the timely
implementation of other provisions of the relevant Security Council
resolutions, including resolution 687 (1991).</TE>
<TE>   To this end, the Government of the Republic of Iraq is ready to
discuss the practical arrangements necessary for the immediate
resumption of inspections.</TE>
<TE>   In this context, the Government of the Republic of Iraq reiterates
the importance of the commitment of all Member States of the Security
Council and the United Nations to respect the sovereignty,
territorial integrity and political independence of Iraq, as
stipulated in the relevant Security Council resolutions and article
(II) of the Charter of the United Nations.</TE>
<TE>   I would be grateful if you would bring this letter to the
attention of the Security Council members.</TE>
<TE>   Please accept, Mr. Secretary-General, the assurances of my highest
consideration.</TE>

<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>U.S. aircraft patrolled the skies over an eastern Afghan town Monday
after unidentified attackers fired rockets near a U.S. outpost,
officials said. No injuries were reported.</LD>
<LD>   Six rockets exploded early Monday near the airport in Khowst where
U.S. troops have a base, said Mohammed Khan Gorbuz, spokesman for the
provincial governor.</LD>
<LD>   Elsewhere, two U.S. special operations soldiers were slightly
injured Sunday when their vehicle hit an explosive device, possibly a
land mine, between the eastern cities of Asadabad and Jalalabad, the
U.S. military said.</LD>
<TE>   The two soldiers were flown by helicopter to Bagram air base and
were treated for minor injuries. Both were expected to return to duty
today, a U.S. spokesman said.</TE>

<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>Canada wants more information about a 15-year-old Canadian citizen
captured by U.S. troops in eastern Afghanistan and has asked
Washington to take his age into account as it decides what to do with
him.</LD>
<LD>   Foreign Ministry spokesman Carl Schwenger said Monday that the
International Committee of the Red Cross has visited the boy, Omar
Khadr, who is being held by U.S. forces at Bagram air base north of
Kabul, the Afghan capital. He could be transferred to the U.S. naval
base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as an enemy combatant, Schwenger said.</LD>
<LD>   Khadr, the son of an alleged Al Qaeda financier, was captured July
27 after being wounded during a battle in which a U.S. soldier was
killed and four others were hurt.</LD>
<TE>   Canada has asked for consular access to the teenager. The U.S.
State Department replied by saying only that Canada would be notified
if any of its citizens are sent to Guantanamo Bay as enemy
combatants. Schwenger said Canada responded to the State Department
by noting that Khadr is a minor. Canada hasn't contested the U.S.
refusal so far.</TE>

<HD>Masses in Ukraine Rail Against Leader</HD>
<DH>Protests: 'Away with Kuchma!' is the cry at some of the
largest such rallies in ex-Soviet state.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>KIEV, Ukraine</DL>
<LD>Tens of thousands of protesters took to Ukraine's streets Monday in
some of the largest such demonstrations in years, demanding that
President Leonid D. Kuchma resign or call early elections.</LD>
<LD>   In Kiev, the capital, about 20,000 protesters from several
opposition groups blocked the downtown area for hours, shouting,
"Away with Kuchma!"</LD>
<LD>   Many marched to the presidential administration building, where
they set up tents in heavy rain as night fell. They vowed to stay
until Kuchma--accused by opposition leaders of corruption--steps
down.</LD>
<TE>   It was one of the country's biggest demonstrations since Ukraine
gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Political tensions
have been rising steadily since parliamentary elections in March in
which opposition parties won the bulk of the vote.</TE>
<TE>   The demonstrators represented the full spectrum of Ukrainian
politics, from Communists to progressive reformers. All claimed
Kuchma's government is so corrupt that democratic rule and economic
development have been smothered.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm here because of the unemployment, lack of money and ... the
bleak future for my children and grandchildren," said Tetiana, an
unemployed woman from the depressed eastern region of Luhansk.</TE>
<TE>   Kuchma did not respond to the protests. He was in Austria,
pressing political and business leaders to support Ukraine's distant
hopes of joining the European Union.</TE>
<TE>   The demonstrators in Kiev,  ranging from students to pensioners,
defied a court order to mass in a main square. Police did not
interfere.</TE>
<TE>   "Today is a great day for Ukraine. Thousands of people came here
to show they do not want to remain slaves," Yulia Tymoshenko, one of
the most charismatic opposition leaders, told the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   The demonstration was timed to coincide with the second
anniversary of the disappearance of investigative journalist Georgi
Gongadze. The October 2000 discovery of a beheaded body, believed to
be Gongadze's, touched off months of protests against Kuchma.
Opposition groups accused him of being involved in the journalist's
death, which Kuchma denies.</TE>
<TE>   Similar demonstrations took place in other cities across Ukraine.
In the second-largest protest, 12,000 people took to the streets of
the western city of Lviv.</TE>
<TE>   Kuchma was elected in 1994 and reelected five years later. His
term ends in 2004, and the constitution prohibits him from running
again.</TE>

<HD>Review Panel Backs Bishops' Abuse Policy</HD>
<DH>Priests: Board wants religious orders group to alter plan
for violators.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>OKLAHOMA CITY</DL>
<LD>A national review panel waded into a church conflict over
disciplining sexually abusive priests Monday, urging religious orders
to comply with the discipline policy adopted by America's Roman
Catholic bishops.</LD>
<LD>   Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating, chairman of the bishop-appointed
National Review Board, said his group will formally ask the
Conference of Major Superiors of Men to reverse its August decision
to allow most abusers to continue in church work away from
parishioners.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. bishops agreed three months ago to remove guilty priests from
all church work--from celebrating Mass to working in a Catholic soup
kitchen--and in some cases from the priesthood altogether.</LD>
<TE>   The Conference of Major Superiors represents religious orders such
as the Franciscans and Dominicans, which make up about a third of the
nation's 46,000 priests. The conference said the bishops' approach
violated Catholic belief in redemption and ignored research
indicating that some abusers can be rehabilitated.</TE>
<TE>   But Keating said he and board Vice Chairwoman Anne Burke, an
Illinois appellate judge, will write the conference with the "urgent
request that they implement precisely the same policy that the
bishops approved in Dallas." Having the orders signed would ensure
that there's a uniform policy for all U.S. priests.</TE>
<TE>   Marita Eddy, a spokeswoman for the Conference of Major Superiors,
did not return a message left at her office late Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The review board, made up of 13 prominent lay Catholics, was
established as a way to help enforce the reforms that the bishops
approved in June to stem the clerical sexual abuse crisis.</TE>
<TE>   The governor said information gathered so far indicates most
dioceses are implementing the plan. Still, Keating said the review
board will soon reveal the names of bishops who are failing to
comply.</TE>

<HD>Woman Accused in Wildfire to Leave Halfway House</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>The woman accused of starting the largest wildfire in Colorado
history can be released from a halfway house while awaiting trial but
must be monitored electronically, a federal judge ruled Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Terry Barton, 38, has pleaded not guilty to four federal charges,
including arson and injuring a firefighter.</LD>
<LD>   The former U.S. Forest Service employee is accused of starting a
June 8 fire near Lake George that destroyed 133 homes and blackened
137,000 acres.</LD>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. David Conner argued that Barton should remain
in a halfway house as a condition of her release on $600,000 bail. He
said allowing her to leave would place her under additional stress
and questioned whether electronic monitoring is effective.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch responded: "Don't you think
it's stressful to live in a halfway house?" He also said he found
electronic monitoring is usually effective.</TE>
<TE>   Matsch ruled Barton can be released to a private home as soon as
the federal Probation Department's Pretrial Services Division
approves the location and arranges monitoring. He said Barton must
check in regularly with pretrial services officials.</TE>
<TE>   Barton's lawyer, Rick Williamson, said Barton has a job in the
Denver area and has at least two homes available to her. He declined
to give details.</TE>
<TE>   Barton was arrested June 16. Investigators said she told them she
accidentally started the fire while burning a letter from her
estranged husband. Authorities believe she purposely set the fire.</TE>
<TE>   She was released on bail after her husband agreed to use their
home as security for her bond. She was ordered to get mental health
counseling, stay in Colorado and not enter any forest.</TE>
<TE>   Her trial is set to start Jan. 6. If convicted, she faces up to 60
years in prison and $1 million in fines.</TE>

<HD>Remains Are Those of Missing Ohio Girl</HD>
<DH>Crime: The 14-year-old was last seen at a county fair. A
suspect is in custody but not charged.</DH>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WOOSTER, Ohio</DL>
<LD>A severed head and limbs found over the weekend in a swampy area are
those of a 14-year-old girl who disappeared from a county fair, the
Wayne County sheriff confirmed Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Kristen Jackson had been at the county fairgrounds on Sept. 9 with
her older sister and friends and was last seen walking toward the
main gate to meet her mother.</LD>
<LD>   The body parts were found Saturday, Sheriff Thomas Maurer said. He
would not disclose the exact location or other details. Authorities
continued to search for more remains Monday at an undisclosed area.</LD>
<TE>   Mary Belanger of the county's victim assistance program said the
girl's family was "devastated beyond words."</TE>
<TE>   A suspect, Joel Yockey, 46, of Wooster, was arrested Friday night
on a parole violation, the sheriff said. He had not been charged in
Kristen's disappearance, and authorities didn't say why he was a
suspect.</TE>
<TE>   Police said they found the remains while searching an area they
believed Yockey would have visited.</TE>
<TE>   Yockey was released from prison in March after serving 15 years of
a 10-to 25-year sentence for the 1986 kidnapping and rape of a
17-year-old.</TE>
<TE>   Since his release, he had lived with his parents, next to a house
where Kristen occasionally visited a friend. His parents would not
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Prisons spokeswoman Andrea Dean said Yockey was suspected of
violating a parole condition that barred him from associating with
anyone younger than 18. She wouldn't provide details.</TE>
<TE>   Wooster is about 50 miles southwest of Cleveland.</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former FBI agent who tipped off two Boston mobsters that they were
about to be indicted was sentenced to more than 10 years in prison in
a case that exposed an overly cozy relationship between the bureau
and its informants.</LD>
<LD>   John Connolly helped break up the New England Mafia in the 1970s
and '80s by using information he got from FBI informants James
"Whitey" Bulger and Stephen "The Rifleman" Flemmi, leaders of a
Boston Irish mob.</LD>
<LD>   Connolly was convicted in May of racketeering, obstruction of
justice and lying to an FBI agent for tipping off Bulger and Flemmi
about criminal investigations and an upcoming indictment in 1995.</LD>
<TE>   Bulger is on the FBI's "Most Wanted" list. Flemmi is serving 10
years in prison and is awaiting trial on 10 killings, all committed
while he was an FBI informant.</TE>

<LD>A judge in Birmingham refused to set aside a former Ku Klux
Klansman's murder conviction in the 1963 church bombing that killed
four black girls.</LD>
<LD>   Circuit Judge James Garrett's one-sentence ruling said he had
reviewed all filings and that "the motion for a new trial is
overruled."</LD>
<LD>   Bobby Frank Cherry, 71, was found guilty in May of the Sept. 15,
1963, bombing at Birmingham's Sixteenth Street Baptist Church, a
gathering place for civil rights demonstrators. He was sentenced to
life in prison.</LD>
<TE>   At a hearing last week, defense attorney Mickey Johnson argued
that jurors at the trial should not have heard evidence about
Cherry's character or seen a film of him hitting a civil rights
leader during a 1957 attempt to integrate a Birmingham school.</TE>

<HD>Private Life Collides With Popular Columnist's Public Image</HD>
<DH>Media: Bob Greene, who championed Midwestern values for 30
years at the Tribune, is accused of sexual acts with a teen 10 years
ago.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J. MICHAEL KENNEDY and JOHN BECKHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>For almost 30 years, Chicago Tribune columnist Bob Greene was an
institution in this city.</LD>
<LD>   With a straightforward Midwestern style, he came to epitomize the
folksier side of American values. He wrote about Elvis and Michael
Jordan and the plight of abused children.</LD>
<LD>   That public persona came crashing down around Greene on Sunday
when a brief notice on the front page of the Tribune announced that
the columnist, who is married, had resigned after an investigation
into sexual misconduct with a teenage girl more than a decade ago.</LD>
<TE>   Greene's departure from the paper, where he had worked since 1978,
was newsworthy enough to be the lead story of the day on a number of
Chicago television stations. A lengthy account of the events leading
up to Greene's resignation appeared prominently in Monday's Tribune.
That story detailed almost a week of intense discussions, Greene's
suspension and finally the acceptance of his resignation on Saturday
by Editor Ann Marie Lipinski.</TE>
<TE>   But even with the publicity, questions remained about the
circumstances surrounding the misconduct, including why the incident
emerged more than a decade after it happened. But top editors at the
Tribune remained tight-lipped when asked for further information. At
an emotional meeting for newspaper employees held Monday in a Tribune
auditorium, Lipinski repeatedly declined to expand further on the
events of the last week, saying that a more detailed account would
endanger the privacy of individuals involved.</TE>
<TE>   "I cannot discuss more detail," she told a group of about 200
staffers who attended the meeting. "It would make things easier for
me. We are dealing with somebody who complained who does not want her
name to be used."</TE>
<TE>   Lipinski told The Times in a telephone interview that the events
were "heartbreaking." She declined to elaborate on the discussions
with Greene or on the final decision to accept his resignation.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Rhodes, who writes about the media for Chicago magazine,
said another question that remains unclear is which line Greene
crossed. "The Tribune is in the position of knowing the real story
and not telling the rest of us. The story is not going to end here."</TE>
<TE>   According to accounts in the Tribune and other sources, an e-mail
was sent to the newspaper a week ago Monday containing allegations of
sexual impropriety by Greene. The e-mail was channeled through the
Tribune's news tip line, then on to top editors.</TE>
<TE>   Quoting sources who have seen the e-mail, the Tribune story said a
girl, then in her late teens, met with Greene in his office as part
of a high school project. Those sources also said the teenager was
later the subject of a Greene column, followed soon thereafter by a
dinner and a sexual encounter.</TE>
<TE>   The Tribune reported that the e-mail said the woman involved in
the encounter had tried to contact Greene twice in the last year.
After the second attempt, she received a call, purportedly from the
FBI, warning her to stop calling.</TE>
<TE>   The inflammatory e-mail led to discussions among the paper's top
brass, with Greene and with the woman in question. On Saturday,
Lipinski and Managing Editor Jim O'Shea interviewed the woman. Later
in the day, Greene resigned.</TE>
<TE>   Greene, 55, sent an e-mail to Associated Press shortly after his
resignation in which he said there were "indiscretions in my life
that I'm not proud of."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have the words to express the sadness I feel," he wrote.
"I am very sorry for anyone I have let down, including the readers
who have for so long meant so much to me."</TE>
<TE>   Lou Pomerantz, owner of the Candle Cart, a Michigan Avenue candle
store, has read Greene for years. She said she admired his columns on
the welfare of children. "His style was simple and to the point," she
said. "The Tribune possibly overreacted, but if those were the rules,
then he knew the rules and I am genuinely deeply saddened by the
whole thing."</TE>
<TE>   Neil Steinberg, a columnist and editorial writer for the Tribune's
rival Sun-Times who once wrote a regular column mocking Greene's
folksy style, said he wasn't surprised by the allegations. "The shock
is to the poor readers who think Bob is trying to keep America pure,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Greene could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   He grew up in Columbus, Ohio, and went to work for the Chicago
Sun-Times in 1969 after graduating from Northwestern University.
After a few years as a reporter, he became a columnist, then jumped
to the Tribune in 1978.</TE>
<TE>   His celebrity expanded nationwide with the syndication of his
column, plus television appearances, books and magazine articles. One
of his books, "Good Morning, Merry Sunshine," was a best seller that
chronicled the first year of his daughter's life.</TE>
<TE>   Other columnists, most notably the Boston Globe's Patricia Smith
and Mike Barnicle, have been fired in recent years for professional
misconduct. Although all the facts haven't been disclosed, this could
be the rare case in which personal misconduct was cited as the cause
for a columnist's departure.</TE>
<TE>   At the Tribune meeting Monday afternoon, Lipinski told Tribune
employees that the reaction of readers had run the gamut but that she
believed the right decision had been made by the paper's editors.
(The paper is owned by the Tribune Co., which also publishes the Los
Angeles Times.)</TE>
<TE>   "I feel awful about this," she said, her voice cracking with
emotion. "I am so proud of this place and I don't want to see it
hurt."</TE>
<TE>   Another question came from the audience: Would Greene have a final
column? "He no longer works here," she replied.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Iceman, whose 5,000-year-old frozen mummy was discovered in the
Alps in 1991, had last meals including venison and wild goat, a team
of Italian scientists reports.</LD>
<LD>   The researchers also joined the speculation over his death,
suggesting that he may have been killed in a dispute among hunters.</LD>
<LD>   "We have analyzed the intestinal content and found compelling
evidence that the Iceman was a high-ranked hunter," said Franco Rollo
of the University of Camerino.</LD>
<TE>   The Iceman, also known as Oetzi, had an empty stomach at the time
of death, researchers found. But by analyzing the contents of his
intestines, the team was able to report on his final two meals.</TE>
<TE>   Their study appears in today's issue of Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences.</TE>
<TE>   Oetzi's body was found frozen in a mountain area, and pollen on
the body indicated he had passed through a coniferous woodland on the
way there, researchers said.</TE>
<TE>   During that trip, he apparently ate the first of the two meals
analyzed. That included meat from an ibex, a type of wild goat once
common in the Alps, plus cereal grains and some type of plant food.</TE>
<TE>   That was followed by a final meal that included meat from a red
deer and, possibly, more grains, the team said.</TE>
<TE>   Although other early people included in their diets rabbit,
squirrel and even pack rat, Oetzi's differed.</TE>
<TE>   "We think, in this view, that it is somehow remarkable that Oetzi
obtained his animal proteins from big game only. It adds to the idea
that he occupied an elevated social position," Rollo said.</TE>
<TE>   Oetzi's remains are in the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology in
Bolzano, Italy. Two years ago, his body was temporarily thawed for
researchers to take samples to study.</TE>

<HD>Intense Logging Blamed for Wildfires</HD>
<DH>Forests: Legislators in the West say timber laws led to
slew of big burns, but statistics show heavy cutting in '70s, '80s
may have caused epidemic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETTINA BOXALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Bush administration's timber-cutting prescription for the West's
wildfire epidemic runs counter to the record of the last half
century, when large forest fires erupted on the heels of the heaviest
logging ever conducted by the U.S. Forest Service.</LD>
<LD>   In an initiative that could come up for a Senate vote any day, the
administration is seeking to waive environmental reviews to speed up
tree-cutting on up to 10 million acres of federal land at high risk
of wildfire.</LD>
<LD>   While administration officials say the work is urgently needed to
thin out forests jammed with fire-prone, dense growth, the Forest
Service's own statistics show that the modern era of big burns began
not in the 1990s, during a period of declining logging, but in the
1980s, when trucks groaning with public timber headed for the mills.</LD>
<TE>   In 1950, when about 3 billion board-feet were logged, a quarter of
a million acres of federal forests burned. Nearly six times that
amount went up in flames in 1988, when the harvest had climbed to
nearly 12 billion board-feet.</TE>
<TE>   In California, two forests now considered especially vulnerable to
fire by the Forest Service--Lassen and Plumas northeast of
Sacramento--also were among the state's most heavily logged during
the 1970s and '80s.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no reduction in wildfire from past logging. We haven't
seen it," said Leon Neuenschwander, a fire ecologist who taught for
25 years at the University of Idaho.</TE>
<TE>   Many experts say that by removing the largest and most
fire-resistant trees and replacing them with dense young growth,
conventional logging and tree planting practices helped create the
conditions that stoke wildfires.</TE>
<TE>   "Partial cutting done historically typically aggravated the fire
hazard and made things worse when fire came along," said C. Phillip
Weatherspoon, an emeritus research forester with the Forest Service
who has written extensively on fire.</TE>
<TE>   That is not to say that he and Neuenschwander believe chainsaws
should be banished from the woods. They don't.</TE>
<TE>   But "cutting is not always the same by a long shot," Weatherspoon
said.</TE>
<TE>   He is one of many experts who advocate the removal of brush and
dense thickets of small trees as well as the use of deliberately set,
controlled fires to lessen the risks of major conflagrations in
western wild lands.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cutting the Old Growth</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials speak of the same need. But they also
argue that the taxpayer expense of such work could be offset if
contractors were allowed to take larger, marketable trees.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush proposal targets 10 million acres at high risk of fire,
including land that is near communities, that is in municipal
watersheds, or that is full of trees affected by disease or insects.</TE>
<TE>   It contains no limits on the size of trees that can be cut and
waives environmental reviews and appeals that have been used by
conservationists to halt the logging of large old-growth trees.</TE>
<TE>   If the timber-cutting projects are challenged in court, the
proposal bars judges from temporarily stopping the work while a case
is under review.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, in separate action in California, Forest Service
officials are reviewing new environmental protections in the Sierra
Nevada, contending the logging limits, adopted in the waning days of
the Clinton administration, hamper their ability to lessen the fire
hazard.</TE>
<TE>   The latest proposals are unfolding during a season of mammoth
wildfires for which some Western lawmakers and politicians have
angrily blamed environmentalists and timber-harvest limits.</TE>
<TE>   "The policies that are coming from the East Coast--that are coming
from the environmentalists that say we don't need to log, we don't
need to thin our forests--are absolutely ridiculous," Arizona Gov.
Jane Dee Hull said after nearly half a million acres of her state
were scorched.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody on the East Coast knows how to manage these fires, and I
for one have had it."</TE>
<TE>   Agriculture Undersecretary Mark Rey, a former timber industry
lobbyist and the architect of the administration proposal, said he
was not blaming environmentalists for the fire problem, nor did he
believe it had been created by logging.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it's any more accurate to say that our current fire
situation is caused by the sharp logging reduction in the Clinton
administration than it is to say commercial logging is the primary
reason for the wildfire situation."</TE>
<TE>   The scope of the summer's raging wildfires, he said, are a
consequence of drought, expanding communities at the forest edge that
drain firefighting resources from the backcountry, and nearly a
century of fire suppression--the policy of putting out fires as
quickly as possible.</TE>
<TE>   Rey insisted that the current proposals are aimed at reducing the
fire hazard, not clearing the way for massive logging. But he said he
didn't believe Congress should be telling forest managers what size
trees to cut.</TE>
<TE>   Will Hart, a spokesman for Sen. Larry E. Craig (R-Idaho), who is
sponsoring the administration's initiative, also said it is important
to give forest managers flexibility and not tie their hands with tree
size restrictions. He added that Craig's legislation includes
language that "not less than 10 of the largest trees per acre" be
maintained in areas thinned under the fuel reduction projects.</TE>
<TE>   That would still allow extensive cutting, as the administration's
own briefing papers cite forest density of about 500 trees or more
per acre in some fire-prone areas.</TE>
<TE>   Critics contend the administration proposal is so broad it would
let the Forest Service cut just about anything, big or little, on
forested land at high fire risk.</TE>
<TE>   "It virtually encourages the removal of large trees," said Jude
McCartin, spokeswoman for Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.), who is
promoting an alternative proposal requiring that most fire hazard
work be done within a half-mile of communities or in key municipal
watersheds.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Product of Tree Harvests</TE>
<TE>   In addition to fire suppression, a number of researchers say the
increased wildfire risk is the product of commercial timber harvests
that promoted changes in the composition of Western forests, leaving
them more vulnerable to wildfire.</TE>
<TE>   In taking out the biggest, most valuable trees, they maintain,
logging in national forests removed those most resistant to fire.</TE>
<TE>   Clear-cutting, widely used by the Forest Service before the late
1980s, created large, sunny openings that subsequently filled with
thick new growth. Logged areas were often reseeded to create tree
plantations, again promoting heavy young growth.</TE>
<TE>   Timber harvesting also created massive amounts of slash
debris--the limbs and treetops stripped from logs before they are
loaded onto trucks. If left in the woods to dry, the slash can act
like huge piles of kindling, ready to feed any blaze that runs
through the woods.</TE>
<TE>   "Almost all of the large damaging wild land fires in American
history up until recent decades were associated with logging and land
clearing," said Stephen J. Pyne, one of the nation's preeminent fire
historians.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason is you leave huge amounts of fuel behind."</TE>
<TE>   University of Washington forest ecologist James K. Agee, the
author of various journal articles on fire, said there are good and
bad ways to thin.</TE>
<TE>   "On public lands, in particular, we ought to be focusing on
leaving the largest trees and thinning out the smaller ones and
making sure the slash that is created on those operations is cleaned
up.</TE>
<TE>   "It really boils down to the Forest Service doing a good job of
this in a sustainable fashion," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "They know how to do it. The question is, given the chance, will
they?"</TE>

<HD>Who Wins Gubernatorial Nod May Hinge on Female Voters</HD>
<DH>Democrats: Shannon P. O'Brien has huge lead over three male
hopefuls in Massachusetts race.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>In a heated Democratic primary, female voters in Massachusetts could
prove decisive in choosing their party's gubernatorial nominee today.
Most likely, polls show, the candidate will be Shannon P. O'Brien,
the state treasurer and the sole woman among four Democrats seeking
the coveted corner office on Beacon Hill.</LD>
<LD>   "Women might actually make the fundamental decision," said
political analyst Lou DiNatale of the University of Massachusetts at
Boston. "This would be a first in Massachusetts, where being a woman
on the ticket has been a net positive--not just symbolic, but a
genuine vote-getter."</LD>
<LD>   A poll in Sunday's Boston Herald gave O'Brien, 43, a commanding
lead with 34%. Former state Sen. Warren Tolman, 42, followed in the
survey of 458 voters with 21%. State Senate President Thomas
Birmingham, 53, earned support from 17% of those surveyed, and former
U.S. Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich, 55, trailed with 16%. The
survey, with an error margin of plus or minus 4.6%, showed 12% of
Democratic voters still undecided.</LD>
<TE>   A survey released Friday by the Boston Globe and WBZ-TV also gave
O'Brien a strong lead, at 31%. The Globe-WBZ poll put Birmingham and
Reich in a tie for second place, with 22% each. Tolman came in last
at 13%. The survey of 400 voters had a margin of error of plus or
minus 5 percentage points.</TE>
<TE>   The figures capped more than nine months of aggressive campaigning
to determine which Democrat would oppose venture capitalist Mitt
Romney, the lone Republican running for governor. Romney, 55, stepped
in when acting Gov. Jane Swift, under pressure from her party for
poor performance, announced that she would not run for the office she
assumed almost two years ago when former Gov. Paul Cellucci became
U.S. ambassador to Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Romney, who earlier ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate against
longtime Democratic incumbent Edward M. Kennedy, prevailed in a court
challenge to his state residency brought by Democrats. The former
head of Bain Capital lived in Utah while running the 2002 Salt Lake
City Olympic Organizing Committee, but he also maintained a home near
Boston that he has owned for more than 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   Romney is a social and fiscal conservative whose running mate,
Kerry Murphy Healey, briefly served as head of the state Republican
Party and who twice lost bids for the state House. Weekend polls
showed Healey locked in a near tie with fellow Republican Jim
Rappaport, an outspoken Romney antagonist, for the party's nomination
for lieutenant governor.</TE>
<TE>   The four Democrats share similar positions on certain major
issues, such as opposing the death penalty and supporting abortion
rights. But O'Brien used a strong campaign organization founded on 15
years of state politics to break away from the pack.</TE>
<TE>   Although gender has appeared to be an asset, O'Brien has carefully
avoided exploiting that aspect of her campaign, said Elizabeth
Sherman of Harvard's Center for Public Leadership.</TE>
<TE>   "She actually had a policy from the get-go of not mentioning
gender," said Sherman, an expert on women in politics. "She would
say, 'I don't think that makes any difference. I think it's my
experience and my fiscal management you should vote for.' She
eschewed the whole idea of being 'the woman' candidate."</TE>
<TE>   Pitted against Romney, said DiNatale, "the test will be whether
she can define herself to an audience that doesn't know her vision
and her positions quicker than Romney can define her in a negative
way."</TE>
<TE>   However, he said, "if I had to bet between someone who calls
water-skiing his favorite sport and the captain of the Yale women's
soccer team, I think I know who I would choose. This is a tough kid.
She is a counter-puncher."</TE>
<TE>   Also on the ballot for governor are Carla Howell, a Libertarian
who is seeking to ban income tax in Massachusetts, and Green Party
candidate Jill Stein.</TE>

<HD>Medicare Aid for Elderly Is Pushed</HD>
<DH>Legislation: Bill moving in Senate would offer givebacks to
health-care providers, with little help for beneficiaries. But rush
is on to provide assistance before Nov. 5.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICKI KEMPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Having failed to deliver a Medicare prescription drug benefit,
lawmakers are searching for other ways to help the nation's elderly
voters shortly before the November congressional elections.</LD>
<LD>   But very little of the sum--up to $50 billion--that the Senate is
on course to approve early next month would reach the program's 40
million beneficiaries. Instead, the so-called givebacks--Medicare fee
increases--would go to doctors, hospitals, nursing homes, HMOs and
other health-care providers.</LD>
<LD>   Among the potential recipients are overworked physicians in Iowa,
air ambulance firms in Montana, HMOs in New York and the collection
of state and local medical associations, specialty groups and other
health-care professionals that consistently rank among the nation's
top five political contributors.</LD>
<TE>   "No one's given up on the issue of prescription drugs," said
Michael Siegel, Democratic spokesman for the Senate Finance
Committee. "But it would be unfortunate if we sacrificed an
opportunity to do Medicare givebacks."</TE>
<TE>   AARP, the advocacy group for seniors, hasn't formally surrendered
on its No. 1 priority, prescription drug coverage. It has threatened
to use the muscle of its 35 million members at the voting booth if
Congress does not produce.</TE>
<TE>   But its leaders are realistic.</TE>
<TE>   The givebacks are "so much about home-state politics," said policy
director John Rother. "That often overwhelms bigger issues."</TE>
<TE>   But as congressional elections approach, lawmakers don't dare
leave seniors empty-handed.</TE>
<TE>   To sweeten the pot, some senators are pushing for a broader
"Medicare improvement bill" that would include not only the higher
fees but also some new Medicare benefits, such as coverage of oral
anti-cancer drugs, nutrition therapy for heart patients and some
preventive care.</TE>
<TE>   And Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.), looking to save both seniors and
taxpayers money, wants to require competitive bidding among companies
that rent and sell wheelchairs, oxygen tanks and other medical
equipment to Medicare beneficiaries for home use.</TE>
<TE>   "It is critical that any proposal passed out of the Finance
Committee strike an appropriate balance between addressing provider
payment needs and making needed improvements to the Medicare benefit
package," several senators said Friday in a letter to committee
Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.) and its top-ranking Republican, Sen.
Charles E. Grassley of Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   "To this end," they added, "we urge the committee to move forward
on appropriate Medicare improvements in time to allow this important
legislation to be enacted before the November elections."</TE>
<TE>   If senators find themselves in a preelection bind, they have only
themselves--and the closely divided, highly partisan Senate--to
blame.</TE>
<TE>   When the Republican-controlled House passed a $310-billion
Medicare drug benefit in June, it tacked on some $30 billion in
provider givebacks.</TE>
<TE>   But the Senate, deadlocked over both cost and delivery method,
failed in three successive tries to approve a benefit that virtually
all lawmakers support. It now faces the politically sensitive task of
approving a stand-alone bill that offers little for Medicare
beneficiaries but meets most of the demands of health-care providers.</TE>
<TE>   While staff members are still hashing out the details, health-care
lobbyists and others close to the negotiations described the outlines
of a package:</TE>
<TE>   * Physicians, whose fees were cut 5.4% in January in keeping with
a years-old formula, could win a fee increase of 2% to 3%;</TE>
<TE>   * Hospitals, especially rural facilities and those affiliated with
medical schools, stand to gain at least $14 billion over 10 years;</TE>
<TE>   * Medicare HMOs, which continue to drop out of the program, are
likely to receive an additional $3 billion in payments; and</TE>
<TE>   * Nursing homes, which face a 10% fee cut on Oct. 1, and home
health agencies, anticipating a 4.9% cut, will probably find those
cuts reduced or eliminated.</TE>
<TE>   All these handouts will force lawmakers to revise their rationale,
and they already are emphasizing the potential advantages for
beneficiaries.</TE>
<TE>   Increasing payments to physicians, hospitals, nursing homes and
HMOs "will provide better quality of care and access to care for
beneficiaries," said Siegel, the Baucus aide.</TE>
<TE>   Recent studies show that it is becoming more difficult for
Medicare patients to find doctors to treat them. A quarter of
physicians told the American Medical Assn. they have already limited
or soon will limit the number of Medicare patients they treat. And
unless Congress increases Medicare reimbursements, the AMA warned,
the problem will only worsen.</TE>
<TE>   For physicians in largely rural states, the connection between
Medicare payments, doctor availability and the quality of health care
is all too real.</TE>
<TE>   Medicare reimbursement rates vary by region, and for some services
the state at the bottom is paid as much as 38% less than the one at
the top.</TE>
<TE>   Physicians from 17 states at the lower end of the pay scale formed
the Geographic Equity in Medicare Coalition in June and lobbied for a
payment formula based on national rather than regional health-care
costs.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a fairness issue," said Dr. Jose Angel, a Des Moines
internist and president of the Iowa Medical Society.</TE>
<TE>   Because Iowa ranks 50th in the nation in Medicare reimbursements,
Angel said, the state has the 37th-worst ratio of all doctors to
patients.</TE>
<TE>   Low payments contribute to the physician shortage because young
doctors who learn about the combination of low fees and high patient
loads are reluctant to locate in Iowa, Angel said.</TE>
<TE>   The shortage of doctors and hospital beds in turn makes it harder
for Iowans to get medical treatment, Angel said.</TE>
<TE>   "Every single day I take care of patients who've been driven out
of their homes because of health-care costs," said Angel. "But when
someone has to wait six months for a colonoscopy, or three weeks for
an angiography or five days to get a gallbladder removed, that's a
problem too."</TE>
<TE>   So severe is the problem in Iowa that business groups, which
complain that companies will not set up shop in a town without a
hospital, have joined doctors in demanding change. And Iowa's
representatives in Congress, led by Grassley, are determined to
deliver.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unfair for Medicare to penalize low-cost health-care
providers for being low cost," Grassley said Monday. "That's what I'm
trying to correct."</TE>
<TE>   While Grassley is likely to add a "payment equity" provision to
the Medicare bill, Baucus wants to include a provision that would
make it harder for Medicare representatives to deny payment for air
ambulance services.</TE>
<TE>   In Montana, where 900,000 residents are spread across the
country's fourth-largest state, an air ambulance can mean the
difference between a one-hour plane ride and a six-hour drive. Such
differences are particularly critical for patients who have suffered
a heart attack or other trauma, said Dr. Nicholas Wolter, CEO of
Deaconess Billings Clinic.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Medicare has downgraded 40% of Deaconess' air ambulance claims
in the last 18 months, reimbursing the hospital roughly $400 for
flights that cost $4,900 on average, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The rules and laws made in Baltimore [Medicare headquarters] and
Washington are very often at odds with the reality in Montana," said
a Baucus aide.</TE>
<TE>   Physicians, HMO representatives and other health-care providers
swarmed over Capitol Hill last week, demanding more money, and some
health-care businesses are staging a Washington "fly-in" this week.</TE>
<TE>   There's nothing unusual about that. But the anti-competitive
bidding message medical-equipment providers plan to deliver to
Congress on Wednesday is not one lawmakers are accustomed to hearing.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to look at the whole picture before you start saying,
'Oh, boy, we can save some money,' '' said Joan Cross, president of
the Florida Assn. of Medical Equipment Services.</TE>

<HD>Hawaii's 'Forbidden Island' Gets a Polling Place</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HONOLULU</DL>
<LD>Native Hawaiians on an exclusive island set up to seal out outside
influences will be casting ballots in person this year for the first
time in decades.</LD>
<LD>   A voting machine and ballots will be flown to Niihau by
helicopter, said Kauai County officials who oversee government
services for the island.</LD>
<LD>   Niihau, known as the "forbidden island," has 81 registered voters
among its total population of 160 Native Hawaiian residents. The
statewide primary for governor and other offices is Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   Officials decided to have elections by machine after holding
several discussions with residents on the privately owned island,
Kauai County Deputy Clerk Ernest Pasion said. Previously, all voters
on the island had to mail in their votes like absentee voters.</TE>
<TE>   With no paved roads, telephone lines or electrical service, the
72-square-mile island lies just southwest of Kauai. It is the only
island where Hawaiian is spoken as an everyday language and where a
majority of residents voted against U.S. statehood in 1959.</TE>
<TE>   It hasn't been resolved what time polling will close on Niihau.
Polling originally was scheduled to close at noon to allow time for
ballots to be brought back.</TE>
<TE>   "It depends on how many come to the polls," Pasion said.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone is pleased with the system.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Robinson, who owns the island with his brother Keith, said
he believes the government could better use the money. Robinson's
helicopter will be used to ferry the machine and ballots to Niihau.</TE>
<TE>   "If they want to spend the money on it or not, that's up to them,
but it's been done in the past by absentee" voting, Robinson said.
"It's way cheaper, way faster. Everything worked out better."</TE>
<TE>   The Robinson family has owned Niihau, home to the last
all-Hawaiian community, since 1864.</TE>

<HD>Nuclear Test Site Far From Ready, U.S. Audit Finds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>With equipment mothballed and experts retired, the Nevada Test Site
is not ready to meet an Energy Department goal of resuming
underground nuclear weapons experiments within three years, a new
report said.</LD>
<LD>   Energy Department Inspector General Gregory Friedman said it would
take funding and a presidential order similar to that needed to
develop a new type of weapon to quickly resume nuclear testing at the
vast federal reservation 65 miles north of Las Vegas.</LD>
<LD>   Replying to a Bush administration order to review nuclear testing
readiness, the Energy Department had said this year that it would
take 18 to 36 months to prepare the site.</LD>
<TE>   Nevada's lawmakers in Congress say they support renewed testing,
if there is compelling evidence that deems it absolutely necessary
for national security.</TE>
<TE>   However, the inspector general released a report last week saying
that federal investigators found equipment unused for a decade
wrapped in plastic and mothballed.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said almost half of the department's nuclear testing
experts have left, and that almost half of the remaining employees
can retire in five years.</TE>
<TE>   Basic equipment is not ready, such as a processing plant used for
preparing material to plug holes above buried nuclear weapons.
Investigators found that the plant has been dismantled since 1992.</TE>
<TE>   The report said it would take an additional $5 million a year for
two or three years to ready the site for experiments. Current funding
is about $10 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   The report urged the department to hire and train experts, develop
a plan to test and replace equipment, and update its testing
readiness and computer programs.</TE>
<TE>   Officials of the National Nuclear Security Administration, which
operates the test site, agreed with many findings, but they disagreed
with the investigators' assessment, saying the test site could
conduct experiments if necessary.</TE>

<HD>N.Y. Executive Kills 2 Co-Workers, Himself</HD>
<DH>Crime: The gunman was an ex-FBI agent. He was linked
romantically to one victim, police say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>An insurance executive called two co-workers into his office near
Times Square, shot them to death and then killed himself Monday
morning, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The motive was not immediately clear, but a police source told
Associated Press that the gunman had been romantically involved with
one of the victims. The other victim was a man.</LD>
<LD>   The gunfire erupted on the 11th floor about 8:20 a.m., well before
most employees had arrived at Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield's
offices on Broadway near 40th Street.</LD>
<TE>   The gunman was identified by police as John Harrison, 53, a vice
president in the insurance company's fraud investigations unit. He
was a former FBI agent who last worked in Trenton, N.J., before
leaving the bureau in 1989, according to Sandra Carroll, a
spokeswoman for the FBI's Newark, N.J., office.</TE>
<TE>   Two semiautomatic handguns, a .45-caliber and a 9-millimeter, were
found on the floor. A third gun was also found in the office, and
police believe all three belonged to the executive.</TE>
<TE>   "We heard some sounds. I thought it was maybe thunder or a truck,"
said Richard Restrepo, an electrician who was working on the ninth
floor. "Twenty minutes later, my boss comes in and says, 'Everyone
out.' He saw all the cop cars in the street and thought maybe it was
a bomb scare."</TE>
<TE>   The victims were identified as Vincent LaBianca, 34, and Isabel
Munoz, 36. Harrison and both victims were found in the executive's
15-by-15-foot corner office, police said. A police source said a
witness reported that the vice president had called the two others
into his office.</TE>
<TE>   Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield leases three floors in the
25-story building. The company issued a statement late Monday
describing the shooting as "a self-contained incident stemming from a
dispute between the three employees involved."</TE>

<HD>Americans Still Divided on Issue of Rights vs. Security</HD>
<DH>Survey: People oppose airport racial profiling, but back
monitoring prisoner-lawyer talks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDDY RAMIREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>While Americans say they oppose airport screenings of only those
passengers with Arabic names or Middle Eastern appearance, most agree
that the government should secretly monitor conversations between
prisoners and their lawyers, a national poll shows.</LD>
<LD>   A poll released today by the National Constitution Center shows
that Americans remain deeply divided between protecting civil
liberties and ensuring national security, raising an issue at the
heart of an intensifying public debate: how to balance constitutional
provisions with the need to ferret out those who may be plotting more
terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   "People's knowledge of the Constitution is very piecemeal," said
Deborah Wadsworth, president of Public Agenda, the nonpartisan group
that conducted the poll. "They're struggling with tensions ... the
need to balance individual protections and rights with the need to
protect society."</LD>
<TE>   According to the poll, 58% of Americans say they support the
current practice of randomly screening passengers, regardless of name
or background. A quarter prefer a more limited approach, picking only
those on the list of suspects, while 11% say that only passengers of
Middle Eastern origin should be screened.</TE>
<TE>   This is a dramatic shift in public opinion from a year ago, when
polls showed that most Americans favored more intensive security
checks--including a special form of identification--for Muslims or
Arab Americans before they boarded airplanes.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, however, a new anti-terrorist tracking system at U.S.
airports has drawn fire from Islamic nations, which contend that
fingerprinting and photographing their citizens is discriminatory.</TE>
<TE>   But despite overwhelming opposition to racial profiling among
Americans, the new poll shows that a majority want the government to
enact stricter measures to prevent terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   For example, nearly 6 in 10 Americans say that monitoring of
prisoner-lawyer conversations, which used to be protected as
confidential, is a "sensible way to get information about possible
terrorist plots." Just over a third believe that this violates the
right to private legal advice.</TE>
<TE>   Americans also share a widespread unwillingness to extend basic
constitutional guarantees to those in the United States illegally.</TE>
<TE>   After being reminded that some of the Sept. 11 hijackers were in
the country illegally, 58% of the respondents said that such
individuals deserve no constitutional protections. Anyone caught
entering the U.S. illegally should be deported immediately, 61% said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite these findings, which show that most Americans accept
tougher government impositions to stop potential terrorists, more
than half say they are concerned that law enforcement could "snoop on
people's private lives," noting that the government either is
"threatening to cross the line" or has already done so.</TE>
<TE>   Georgetown University law professor David D. Cole predicts that
the public's ambivalence will dissipate as time passes without acts
of terrorism, noting that Americans and the courts are growing
increasingly skeptical of overreaching government actions.</TE>
<TE>   For example, a U.S. district judge in Washington wrote early last
month that "secret arrests are a concept odious to a democratic
society," in a ruling that the identities of most of the "enemy
combatants" held at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,
should be released under the Freedom of Information Act.</TE>
<TE>   "Time has allowed us all to pay more attention to the 'liberties'
side of this balance and led us to question if incursions to liberty
have made us safer, and that what's done to immigrants affects all of
us," Cole said.</TE>
<TE>   The nationwide random telephone survey, conducted July 10 through
24, probed the attitudes of 1,520 adults; the margin of error is plus
or minus 3%.</TE>
<TE>   The poll's findings, detailed in a report titled "Knowing It by
Heart," are seen by researchers as a reassuring sign that Americans
are committed more than ever to exploring situations that raise
constitutional questions.</TE>
<TE>   Although 66% of Americans admitted that their knowledge of the
Constitution was not specific, the poll also shows that an
overwhelming majority believe it is "absolutely essential" for people
to have detailed knowledge of their constitutional rights and
freedoms.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't been thinking about these issues a lot," said Joseph
M. Torsella, president of the National Constitution Center, which was
established by Congress in 1988 to promote understanding about the
U.S. Constitution and its relevance to daily life. "The dust is going
to settle, and we'll be able to see where the American mind goes. For
now, people are thinking about [these constitutional questions]
appropriately and thoroughly."</TE>

<HD>6th Man Charged in Terror Case</HD>
<DH>Courts: The suspect, also from the Buffalo, N.Y., area,
admits training for jihad at an Al Qaeda camp in Afghanistan,
documents show.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A sixth Buffalo, N.Y.-area man of Yemeni descent was charged Monday
with supporting terrorism after he admitted traveling to Afghanistan
and learning how to use assault weapons at an Al Qaeda training camp.</LD>
<LD>   Mukhtar Al-Bakri, 22, told an FBI agent that he traveled with
several other men to Pakistan in June 2001, ostensibly for religious
training, court documents show. But after one of the men changed his
story, Al-Bakri revealed last week that he too had spent up to seven
weeks in basic training for jihad, or holy war.</LD>
<LD>   Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda, spoke to the roughly 200
soldiers in training at the Al-Farooq camp near Kandahar,
Afghanistan. They heard lectures about jihad and using suicide as a
weapon, and they learned how to use firearms and assault
weapons--even anti-aircraft guns, according to court documents.</LD>
<TE>   The men returned to the Buffalo area in the summer of 2001, and
several of them were interviewed by FBI agents.</TE>
<TE>   They were not suspected of taking part in the Sept. 11 attacks in
New York or Washington, nor do federal agents suspect they committed
any direct acts to further terrorism in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "At this point, there is no significant plot here that we have
uncovered," FBI Special Agent Peter Ahearn said at a televised news
conference in Buffalo.</TE>
<TE>   However, the complaint says Al-Bakri sent an e-mail on July 18 to
another of the Buffalo-area men that agents "interpret as referring
to possible terrorist activity."</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, five of the men were charged under a 1996 law that
makes it a crime to offer "material support" to a foreign terrorist
group. Al-Bakri, who had been living recently in Bahrain in the
Persian Gulf, was arrested Sunday, returned to Buffalo and charged
with the same offense Monday.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. attorneys say they plan to prosecute the six men in federal
court under the standard rules for criminal cases. All of them will
be provided with lawyers if they cannot afford one of their own.</TE>
<TE>   Ahearn said the "initial tip-off" about the six alleged Al Qaeda
operatives came from the local Muslim community. He also said the men
had been under surveillance since before last year's attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Al-Bakri was able to travel to Bahrain recently after
obtaining a new passport. He admitted that he had falsely claimed to
have lost his passport, apparently with the intent of concealing his
travels the year before to Pakistan and Afghanistan, according to the
complaint.</TE>
<TE>   The 1996 law under which the Buffalo-area men have been charged is
still relatively new and largely untested in the courts. It states
that it is illegal to "knowingly provide material support or
resources to a foreign terrorist organization."</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department said it won its first conviction under the
law in June when a jury in Charlotte, N.C., found two Lebanese men
guilty of financing Hezbollah terrorists in Lebanon with the profits
from a cigarette-smuggling operation. Prosecutors do not have to show
that the money was used for a terrorist act or that the supplier
intended it would be used for acts of violence.</TE>
<TE>   Georgetown University law professor David D. Cole said the law was
held to be unconstitutional in one case by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court
of Appeals in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   "It is very broad and it allows for guilt by association," Cole
said. "You are punishing people for supporting an organization,
whether or not they intended to do anything to further terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "If these guys were part of a terrorist cell and went abroad to be
trained, they ought to be prosecuted. But we don't know yet. They
might be young guys who, out of a misguided religious idealism, found
themselves over there and came back with no intent of doing anything
to further terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   The six men are due back in court Wednesday. Prosecutors will ask
a judge to deny them bail and to hold them until their trial.</TE>

<HD>Study Links Weed Killer to Reproductive Problems</HD>
<DH>Science: Tests on mice reveal an increase in failed
pregnancies, researchers report.</DH>

<LD>A cocktail of the three most common herbicides used by about 29
million American households to kill dandelions may reduce fertility
and cause miscarriages, according to a study published today in the
toxicology journal Environmental Health Perspectives.</LD>
<LD>   The results come as the Environmental Protection Agency prepares
to review the licensing of one of the chemicals, now used in more
than 1,500 lawn-care and agricultural products.</LD>
<LD>   In the study, researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison
and the University of Valparaiso in Chile spiked the drinking water
of laboratory mice with weed killer, then charted the animals'
reproductive rates. They found a 20% increase in failed pregnancies
at extremely low doses--seven times lower than the maximum allowable
rate for U.S. drinking water.</LD>
<TE>   University of Wisconsin toxicologist Warren Porter said his group
deliberately selected the sort of weed killer most commonly employed
by American homeowners on their lawns. He would not name the brand,
other than to say: "We bought it in a hardware store."</TE>
<TE>   He does, however, name the active ingredients: a mix of three
"phenoxy herbicides" called 2,4-D, dicamba and mecoprop. Typically
blended together into weed killers and "weed and feed" products, they
kill broadleaf plants such as dandelions while sparing grass.</TE>
<TE>   They work by confounding the hormone system of the broadleaf
plants, causing them to choke their nutrient and water channels with
their own growth.</TE>
<TE>   The Scott and Dow Chemical Cos. were among the first to market
2,4-D in a host of weed killers and weed-and-feed formulations
immediately after World War II. Since then, they have been formulated
in more than 1,500 products made by scores of companies. Most of
these are over-the-counter products and will contain, in addition to
the herbicides, industrial soaps to help the chemical cling to and
then penetrate the plants.</TE>
<TE>   Trials scrutinizing the safety of the products have typically only
looked at the herbicides singly and have shown the chemicals to have
either low, or no, toxicity. In the last 10 years, the pesticide
industry has spent $30 million on 2,4-D toxicity trials.</TE>
<TE>   North Carolina agronomist Don Page, who represents the leading
suppliers of the chemical in the U.S., has presented to the EPA 270
safety studies sponsored by his clients. He believes the chemical and
products containing it are safe.</TE>
<TE>   "The only verified examples of 2,4-D poisoning in humans is in
suicides. If you drink enough of it, you can kill yourself," he said
in June. He declined to comment on the latest study.</TE>
<TE>   However, since the late 1970s, independent studies of crop workers
in Europe and Kansas have suggested that pesticide applicators
working heavily with products containing 2,4-D had higher rates of
non-Hodgkins lymphoma.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1990s, University of Minnesota pathologist Vincent
Garry conducted studies in wheat, sugar beet and potato farming
regions and found twice the rate of birth defects among children of
crop workers who conceived the children during the months when the
pesticide 2,4-D was sprayed.</TE>
<TE>   Garry began to suspect that the reason the chemicals looked safe
in trials conducted for the government regulators is because the labs
were using pure 2,4-D, while crop workers were handling an enhanced
chemical blend. Porter suspected the same thing. Designing the
Wisconsin study, he set out to examine the toxicity of the mix as
sold over the counter, not the single herbicides tested for the EPA.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no idea what kind of reactions might be going on once
these active ingredients are formulated into products," he said.
"You're talking about putting a lot of very reactive chemicals
together in a mix, and storing it at room temperature."</TE>
<TE>   From Minnesota, Garry praised the choice to use the commercial
mix. "It brings up the notion that it is the commercial-grade product
that people are exposed to, and these need to be studied," he said.
He added that he would like to see further tests to confirm the
radical effects of such low doses.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland research scientist Robert Gunier, an epidemiologist who
has studied the effects of pesticides for the California Department
of Health Services, praised the Wisconsin study for looking at such
low doses. Most testing is done at extremely high doses, he said. "I
think it really raises some important issues about how regulatory
testing is done."</TE>
<TE>   Spurred by the Kansas cancer study and Garry's work in Minnesota,
the EPA is now reviewing the safety literature of 2,4-D and expects a
decision on the status of the chemical in 2004.</TE>

<HD>Nomo Becomes an Unlikely Ace</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. Adande</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kevin Brown is done for the season. Notice we didn't say "Dodger ace
Kevin Brown." He yielded that title to Hideo Nomo, the unlikeliest
leader of any pitching staff still contending for the playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   The news that Brown's back injury won't allow him to pitch again
didn't even faze the Dodgers. By now they're so used to going on
without him and expect so little from him that they simply went about
their business.</LD>
<LD>   "We'll be OK," General Manager Dan Evans said. "This is a very
tough club."</LD>
<TE>   Evans added that the team would not be in mourning over Brown's
"departure."</TE>
<TE>   Departure? That might be wishful thinking.</TE>
<TE>   The real departure of Kevin Brown can't come soon enough. Problem
is, he isn't going anywhere. There are three more years left on that
landmark seven-year, $105-million contract. At $15 million per
season, teams would be hesitant to take him even if he were winning
20 games a year. In Brown's current state, other GMs won't even
return Evans' phone calls if he wants to talk about trading him.</TE>
<TE>   So get ready for more injuries, more time on the shelf, more
agony. Brown will celebrate his 38th birthday before he pitches
again, so expect even more breakdowns. This isn't Nolan Ryan here.
He's this town's biggest, most expensive waste since the Belmont
school project.</TE>
<TE>   It's been a mismatch from the start. When Brown did what he was
supposed to in his first two seasons (winning twice as many games as
he lost and passing the 200 strikeout mark), the rest of the team was
a mess.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, when the team fought through injuries to the rotation
and managed to stay in contention through mid-September, Brown tore a
muscle in his elbow and was gone when the Dodgers needed him most.</TE>
<TE>   This year, when the Dodgers found the answers to so many of their
preseason questions (thanks to players such as Eric Gagne in the
bullpen and Dave Roberts in center field), Tracy found himself
searching for a new No. 1 pitcher.</TE>
<TE>   It took a while--with Nomo everything does--but now, "We've grown
to the point now where we say, 'We're counting on this guy,' " Tracy
said.</TE>
<TE>   Since May 17, when Nomo changed the way he pushes off with his
back foot on his delivery, the Dodgers have won 20 of his last 24
starts. He was 12-1 with a 3.08 earned-run average in the 23 starts
before Monday night. On Monday, he was the winning pitcher in the
Dodgers' 7-6 victory over the San Francisco Giants that moved them
into a tie for the NL wild-card playoff spot.</TE>
<TE>   The guy's lucky to still have feeling in his right arm after
throwing 132 pitches in his last outing before Monday.</TE>
<TE>   But as pitching coach Jim Colborn said, "He seems to do better
when he throws more."</TE>
<TE>   Nomo had already thrown 54 pitches and trailed, 3-0, when Colborn
went to the mound in the third inning Monday. Rich Aurilia had
homered to lead off the inning, Jeff Kent was on first with a single
and Barry Bonds stood at the plate. What followed was a historic
moment for Bonds--but only because he walked for a record-breaking
178th time this season. The rest of the accomplishments in the inning
belonged to Nomo: he drew a forceout at second from a grounder by
Benito Santiago, a foul out from Tom Goodwin and got J.T. Snow to tap
back to the mound to keep the game within reach.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Jordan put the Dodgers ahead in the bottom of the inning
with a grand slam.</TE>
<TE>   When Nomo left after the sixth inning, he had a 6-3 lead and
received handshakes all around.</TE>
<TE>   It's not like the Nomomania days of 1995, when he was 13-6 with a
2.54 ERA and 236 strikeouts to win the National League rookie of the
year award.</TE>
<TE>   That all faded away by 1998, when was 2-7 with a 5.05 ERA before
the Dodgers traded him to the New York Mets for Dave Mlicki and Greg
McMichael.</TE>
<TE>   He was a .500 pitcher for Milwaukee and Detroit in 1999 and 2000
before regaining some of his old form with the Boston Red Sox in a
2001 season that included a no-hitter and 220 strikeouts.</TE>
<TE>   When Evans was still with the Chicago White Sox and watched Nomo
pitch against his club he was impressed with his toughness. This
winter he thought the Dodgers could use that kind of player, so he
signed him as a free agent.</TE>
<TE>   But the Dodgers didn't bring him in to be their ace.</TE>
<TE>   "No ... " Tracy said. "We felt like we had a very good guy that
was going to take up some innings for us."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy envisioned Nomo as the third or fourth starter.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, "He's been the ace of this staff and then some."</TE>
<TE>   Said Colborn: "It could be that management was impatient with him.
When he isn't doing well, you have to have faith in him. You have to.
If you do, and give him responsibility, he'll reward you, because
he'll handle responsibility very well."</TE>
<TE>   Monday night was a classic example. Tracy can pull some hasty
moves--bringing in Gagne with one out in the eighth--but he sat tight
and waited out Nomo when he looked shaky in the first three innings.
He gave up two home runs, a double, three walks and a single, but
found his way out of it with minimal damage and kept his team in the
game.</TE>
<TE>   Then he didn't let the momentum slip away after Jordan's grand
slam.</TE>
<TE>   He did what he usually does, what an ace is expected to do: he put
the Dodgers in position to win. Maybe he doesn't shut down opponents
the way Randy Johnson and Pedro Martinez do, but his three earned
runs on Monday were the most he has given up in his last seven
starts.</TE>
<TE>   "With what he's accomplished this year, it's impossible for him to
disappoint you," Tracy said.</TE>
<TE>   No, the pitcher who disappoints you has a locker on the other side
of the clubhouse, and he won't be disappointing you any more this
season.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Only a rain delay could knock Pedro Martinez out of a game against
Cleveland.</LD>
<LD>   Martinez was once again sharp against the Indians, combining with
three relievers on a four-hitter as the Boston Red Sox posted a 6-1
win in the opener of a day-night doubleheader Monday at Boston. The
Indians won the second game, 7-1.</LD>
<LD>   Martinez (19-4), who raised his career record to 9-1 against the
Indians with a 1.78 earned-run average, continued his pursuit of his
second career 20-win season and his fourth Cy Young Award.</LD>
<TE>   He was removed after pitching five innings with the Red Sox
leading, 3-0, after a one hour, 12 minute rain delay.</TE>
<TE>   "That kind of sealed the deal," Boston Manager Grady Little said.
"Had we not had the lead, there might have been more discussion on
what to do after the rain delay."</TE>
<TE>   In the second game, Brian Tallet pitched six shutout innings in
his major league debut and Travis Fryman hit a three-run homer for
the Indians.</TE>
<TE>   Tallet, a 2000 second-round selection out of LSU, split the season
in double-A Akron and triple-A Buffalo before his start. The rookie
gave up four hits, walked three and fanned one.</TE>
<TE>   "The butterflies started to come and I just told myself to relax,"
Tallet said.</TE>
<TE>   "To go out there and give the team six good innings--to keep them
at bay--I couldn't ask for anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Boston's loss cut the New York Yankees' magic number in the AL
East to four.</TE>
<TE>   "He had very good composure out there on the mound for a young
kid," Little said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 2, Baltimore 0--Pete Walker pitched four-hit ball for
seven innings, and Josh Phelps homered and drove in two runs at
Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   Phelps had an RBI single in the sixth inning and added his 15th
homer in the ninth to help the Blue Jays win for the seventh time in
eight games.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore, which has lost 20 of 23, was shut out for the 14th time
this season.</TE>
<TE>   Walker (9-4) walked two and struck out four for the Blue Jays, who
moved two games ahead of Baltimore for third place in the AL East.</TE>
<TE>   Cliff Politte pitched a perfect eighth inning, and Kelvim Escobar
worked the ninth for his 34th save.</TE>
<TE>   The Blue Jays have five shutouts this year.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 5, Kansas City 2--Carlos Pena hit a three-run homer for
the Tigers at Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   The Tigers won for only the fifth time in 25 games. The Royals,
who are 3-11 this month, lead Detroit by four games in the race to
avoid last place in the AL Central.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Maroth (6-8) ended a three-start losing streak, giving up two
runs and six hits in eight innings. The rookie walked one and struck
out four.</TE>
<TE>   Franklyn German pitched one scoreless inning for his first career
save.</TE>
<TE>   Darrell May (4-10) gave up three runs and six hits in six innings.
He is 1-2 in four starts since rejoining the Royal rotation in late
August.</TE>
<TE>   Pena hit his 19th home run in the first inning. Hiram Bocachica
led off with a single, Robert Fick singled with one out and Pena
followed with a drive over the scoreboard in right-center field.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City got two runs back in the third, but could have had
more.</TE>
<TE>   Neifi Perez and A.J. Hinch led off with singles, and Angel Berroa
made the score 3-1 with a double to deep left. After Carlos Beltran
popped out, Mike Sweeney lifted a fly ball to medium-deep right
field. Hinch scored easily, but Fick threw out Berroa at third,
ending the inning.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 6, Texas 5--Ichiro Suzuki walked with the bases loaded and
two out in the bottom of the 11th inning, scoring Mike Cameron and
giving the Mariners the victory over the Rangers.</TE>

<HD>A's Toss Monkey Off Back</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Tejada's single in ninth beats Angels, 4-3;
Glaus' home run wasted.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>The Angels have made a cottage industry of their ultra-marketable
Rally Monkey, crediting the jumping simian with their ability to come
from behind to win 42 games this season.</LD>
<LD>   So what happens when fans of opposing teams do bad things to said
monkey? Apparently, the Angels come from ahead to lose.</LD>
<LD>   After Oakland fans paraded around the pregame grounds of the
Network Associates Coliseum toting monkeys hanging in effigy, the
Angels blew a three-run first-inning lead and fell to the Athletics,
4-3, Monday night, dropping back into a first-place tie in the
American League West with Oakland at 94-56.</LD>
<TE>   The Angels' six-game winning streak, which began last Tuesday
against Oakland, came to an end when Miguel Tejada singled off Angel
reliever Al Levine (4-4) in the ninth inning to score Ray Durham.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland closer Billy Koch (10-3) got the win having pitching a
perfect ninth inning.</TE>
<TE>   Tejada's walk-off heroics were set up by consecutive one-out
singles by Durham and pinch-hitter David Justice.</TE>
<TE>   With the crowd of 22,326 chanting "MVP, MVP," Tejada singled up
the middle and a sliding Durham easily beat Angel center fielder
Darin Erstad's throw. It was the third time in the past month that
Tejada has had a walk-off game-winning hit.</TE>
<TE>   After a big first inning, the Angel offense was silent. But
apparently, it doesn't matter where Troy Glaus bats in the Angel
lineup these days.</TE>
<TE>   A day after hitting three home runs in three consecutive at-bats
while hitting in the No. 2 spot, Glaus went deep in his first at-bat
while batting cleanup.</TE>
<TE>   Glaus' first-inning home run, a three-run shot to right field off
Oakland starter Cory Lidle, equaled the major league mark of four
home runs in four consecutive at-bats, a record achieved numerous
times. Three other players have accomplished the feat this
season--Seattle's Mike Cameron (May 2), the Dodgers' Shawn Green
(over June 14 and 15) and Atlanta's Andruw Jones (over Sept. 7 and
10).</TE>
<TE>   Erstad and Scott Spiezio got on base through a fielder's choice
and a single to right, respectively, to precede Glaus' team-leading
28th home run, which came on an 0-and-1 pitch.</TE>
<TE>   Glaus, though, struck out looking in his next at-bat, in the
fourth inning, and Lidle would end up baffling the Angels, giving up
only two hits after the first inning. The right-hander struck out
three batters and walked two, one intentionally, in seven innings.</TE>
<TE>   "He settled down and pitched a terrific ballgame," Angel Manager
Mike Scioscia said of Lidle. "After Glaus' home run, he put up a lot
of zeros and got them back in the game.</TE>
<TE>   "We just couldn't pressure them enough offensively to let our guys
relax at the plate."</TE>
<TE>   And with starter John Lackey struggling with his control, things
didn't bode well for the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   Lackey only gave up two runs, one earned, and four hits, but he
threw 101 pitches in five innings. The right-handed rookie also
walked five, a season high for him, and struck out four.</TE>
<TE>   "My control wasn't how it's been," Lackey said. "There were a
couple of situations where a walk was better than a pitch down the
middle.</TE>
<TE>   "But then again, I helped them out quite a bit. They're a good
club and when I made a bad pitch, they made me pay for it.... I just
didn't have the command that I usually have."</TE>
<TE>   Oakland got its first run in the second inning when Jermaine Dye
crushed a 1-and-2 pitch for a solo home run, Dye's 20th homer of the
season.</TE>
<TE>   With Lackey laboring in the fifth, the Athletics scored another.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland benefited from a blown double-play attempt in the inning
in which second baseman Adam Kennedy had trouble getting the ball out
of his glove and shortstop David Eckstein misplayed his throw,
putting runners at first and second with none out.</TE>
<TE>   After Lackey walked Scott Hatteberg to load the bases and struck
out Tejada for the inning's first out, Eric Chavez drove a Lackey
pitch into the right-center gap. But Erstad raced over and, in
mid-jump, caught the ball as he met the wall, Ramon Hernandez scoring
on Chavez's sacrifice fly.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland tied it, 3-3, in the seventh when switch-hitting leadoff
batter Ray Durham hit his 14th home run.</TE>

<HD>Series Looks Pivotal for Tiebreaker Too</HD>

<LD>The elimination of the Seattle Mariners and Boston Red Sox from
wild-card contention before the final day of the season would mean
the Angels and Oakland A's would not have a playoff on Sept. 30 to
decide the American League West title if they are tied.</LD>
<LD>   Both would be assured of making the playoffs, and the division
title would be determined by a series of tiebreakers, starting with
their records in head-to-head competition. The A's lead the Angels,
9-8, in that department after Monday's 4-3 victory. The next
tiebreaker is record within the division, a category in which the
Angels have an edge. They are 25-21 against West foes after Monday
and the A's are 23-23.</LD>
<LD>   Based on records after Sunday, the West winner is virtually
certain to play the Minnesota Twins in the opening round and have the
home-field advantage for Games 1, 2 and 5. The wild card would open
against the Yankees at New York.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Manager Mike Scioscia had penciled in Garret Anderson to start in
left field Monday night, but Anderson's right hamstring strain was
still tender during batting practice, and Orlando Palmeiro started in
his place.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels announced they would send Kevin Appier against Oakland
on Thursday afternoon against the A's Tim Hudson, rather than moving
up the 34-year-old right-hander to pitch on three days' rest.</TE>
<TE>   Mickey Callaway, Anaheim's 27-year-old rookie, will start
Wednesday against the A's 21-game winner, Barry Zito.</TE>

is riding a four-game win streak over his last six starts, a stretch

<DL></DL>
<LD>Dan Daly of the Washington Times, commenting on the late Johnny
Unitas:</LD>
<LD>   "Growing up in Beaver Falls, Pa., Joe Namath idolized Unitas--so
much so that friends called him 'Joey U.' Namath wore Johnny's No. 19
jersey for home games, but had to settle for No. 29 on the road
because there was no 19."</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   More Unitas: Jamison Hemsley of the Baltimore Sun commenting on
Tampa Bay's rout of the Ravens, 25-0:</TE>
<TE>   "On a day to remember a legend, the Ravens delivered a performance
to forget."</TE>
<TE>   Unitas, the former great Baltimore Colt quarterback, was the
legend honored at the game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Assuming that he doesn't change his mind, Eric
Crouch, who earlier this month said he was leaving the NFL, is the
sixth Heisman Trophy winner since World War II who hasn't had an NFL
career. The others?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sneeze and bear it: Atlanta Falcon linebacker Matt Stewart on the
perils of NFL drug testing: "I had a cold last week, and I was going
to take Tylenol cold medicine, but we were warned that you can't even
take that now because it may have some sort of ephedrine for a runny
nose."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Whew! Jay Greenberg writing in the New York Post: "They prevented
the unpreventable yesterday, escaped the inescapable, walked
screaming with joy out of a place that nobody gets out of alive."</TE>
<TE>   A mass prison break from Devil's Island? No, just the New York
Giants defeating the Rams, 26-21, Sunday in St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hey, it's only a game: Fran Blinebury of the Houston Chronicle,
commenting, somewhat ruefully, on the San Diego Chargers' 24-3
victory over the Texans: "The Texans weren't outhustled,
outmaneuvered or outfoxed at the end. They were taken out behind the
woodshed and beaten with a cane....</TE>
<TE>   "It was the same brutal result as crossing Tony Soprano. Somebody
breaks your thumbs. Or worse."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What's his handicap? Ron Rapoport in the Chicago Sun-Times:
"Somehow I don't think this is what Martha Burk had in mind. One of
the new members at Augusta National is Lou Holtz."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More Rapoport: Why did the NFL forbid Peyton Manning from paying
tribute to Johnny Unitas by wearing black high-top shoes Sunday?
Because it can."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Quit now: Mark Grace doesn't have any illusions on what next
season with the Arizona Diamondbacks will be like.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm getting old and my body aches too much," he said, explaining
to the Arizona Republic why he doesn't want to play every day. "If
someone gets hurt, yes. I could play three or four straight weeks,
but that's about it."</TE>

Princeton, 1951; Pete Dawkins, Army, 1958; Ernie Davis, Syracuse,

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Diamondback Manager Bob Brenly, when asked which of
his two star pitchers, Curt Schilling or Randy Johnson, he would
endorse for the Cy Young Award:</TE>

homecoming queen."</TE>

<HD>Brown's Season Is Over Early</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Another season ended prematurely Monday for ailing pitcher Kevin
Brown, whose back problems prompted the Dodgers to shut down the
frustrated former staff ace who was struggling to revert to form.</LD>
<LD>   "I really haven't had a chance to help the guys out," said Brown,
sidelined in September last season because of a torn muscle in his
pitching elbow. "Obviously, what I was hoping for was to get back
this season, get healthy, get back in the rotation and help the guys
down the stretch. That hasn't been the case."</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers made the move because Brown, who underwent surgery for
a herniated disk in his lower back June 11, did not respond as well
as hoped after starting Sept. 10 against the San Francisco Giants at
Pacific Bell Park. Brown continued to experience back pain and was
reexamined by specialist Robert Watkins last week, undergoing an MRI
test during the procedure and receiving an epidural injection.</LD>
<TE>   Although Brown's condition did not worsen, Manager Jim Tracy said
the right-hander did not progress enough "to continue to send him out
there." Tracy and General Manager Dan Evans informed Brown of their
decision in a lengthy closed-door meeting in Tracy's office before
the opener of a four-game National League wild-card-race showdown at
Dodger Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Beirne, who made his second big-league start last Friday, is
scheduled to take Brown's spot in the rotation Wednesday against the
Giants. Beirne may return to the bullpen after Wednesday as the
Dodgers reevaluate their options, though they acknowledge they don't
have many.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no choice," Tracy said of shutting down Brown.</TE>
<TE>   Kazuhisa Ishii is sidelined for the rest of the season after being
struck by a line drive and having a titanium plate inserted into his
head, Brown is out again and the Dodgers are just trying to keep it
together.</TE>
<TE>   "The best scenario was that he was on his way back to being close
to Kevin Brown, and that he could give us some help at the end, but
it hasn't worked out that way," pitching coach Jim Colborn said.
"It's ... it's just disappointing, and I mostly feel sorry for him as
an individual.</TE>
<TE>   "He's gone through so much pain and stuff for the last couple of
years. It's just unfair to any human being to go through that."</TE>
<TE>   Brown has been on the disabled list six times in the last three
seasons, including twice in 2002 because of elbow problems. His back
problem occurred during a stint on the 60-day list.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, activated from the disabled list Aug. 15, worked out of the
bullpen until Ishii was injured, rejoining the rotation against the
Giants. He gave up six hits and five runs in five innings, but the
Dodgers were not disappointed under the circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   But Brown, who returned to Los Angeles after the game to meet with
Watkins, informed team trainer Stan Johnston of his discomfort
Sunday. While flying back with the team from Denver, Evans and Tracy
decided that they had reached the end of the road with Brown for now,
sources said.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers said they did not rush back Brown in spring training.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything we did from the first day of spring training forward,
we did with the consultation of our medical staff, and there's no
regrets whatsoever," Evans said.</TE>
<TE>   But where do Brown and the Dodgers go from here? He will be 38 in
spring training, is still owed $45 million and is coming off numerous
injuries. Brown has won only 13 games the last two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know," he said. "I'm just going to do what I can do."</TE>

<HD>Dele Investigation a Murder Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lance Pugmire</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Acting on information from a California woman, prosecutors in Tahiti
on Monday opened a murder investigation into the disappearance of
former NBA player Bison Dele.</LD>
<LD>   A French Polynesian police official, after an FBI forensics team
began searching Dele's boat, said the decision to launch the murder
investigation was a result of comments Erica Weise gave to Sonoma
County Sheriff's Dept. and San Francisco FBI officials.</LD>
<LD>   Weise is a former girlfriend of Dele's older brother, Miles
Dabord, according to a family member of the brothers, and was listed
as the primary emergency contact for the boat.</LD>
<TE>   The police official said Weise told the FBI that Dabord informed
her of a struggle aboard Dele's boat, the Hakuna Matata, that
resulted in the deaths of Dele, his girlfriend, Serena Karlan, and
the boat's captain, Bertrand Saldo. Dabord reportedly deflected blame
from himself, saying Dele, formerly known as Brian Williams, started
the fight, the police official said. Dele, Karlan and Saldo have not
been seen since early July.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI refused to comment on its investigation, acknowledging
only that a forensics team boarded the boat, which was registered
July 15 in Taravao, Tahiti, by a man fitting Dabord's description,
according to the police official.</TE>
<TE>   The boat, registered by a new name, was discovered Thursday.
Dabord, 35, is the subject of an FBI manhunt in Mexico after he
attempted to purchase $152,000 in gold Sept. 5 in Phoenix while
identifying himself as Dele.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dodgers announced before Monday night's game that pitcher Kevin
Brown would miss the rest of the season because of a back injury.</LD>
<LD>   By the time left fielder Brian Jordan was through pounding his
teammates in the third inning with some of the most violent
high-fives in recent Dodger Stadium history, the Dodgers may have
needed MRI tests on a few dozen rotator cuffs.</LD>
<LD>   Jordan sent a surge of energy through his dugout and stadium and
threw a charge back into Dodger playoff hopes, erasing a three-run
deficit with a third-inning grand slam that sent the Dodgers toward a
dramatic 7-6 victory over the San Francisco Giants before a crowd of
35,767.</LD>
<TE>   Closer Eric Gagne recorded five outs for his 49th save, and
Marquis Grissom made a game-saving catch in the ninth as the Dodgers,
who had lost eight of their previous 11 games, won the opener of a
crucial four-game series and pulled even with the Giants atop the
National League wild-card standings with 12 games to go.</TE>
<TE>   Grissom, who entered as a pinch-hitter in the seventh, robbed Rich
Aurilia of a home run with a spectacular leaping catch at the
center-field wall to lead off the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Gagne struck out Jeff Kent and, after an intentional walk to Barry
Bonds, who had homered in his previous at-bat, Gagne struck out
Benito Santiago to end a game that was so emotionally draining, so
tension-filled, that Dodger Manager Jim Tracy called it "the greatest
game I've ever been involved with in all of my life."</TE>
<TE>   It might not have turned out so great for Tracy and the Dodgers
had Jordan not turned a 3-0 deficit into a 4-3 lead with his
third-inning grand slam off Giant starter Jason Schmidt.</TE>
<TE>   "That was as big a home run as I've ever experienced in my
career," Dodger right fielder Shawn Green said. "Not only the home
run but the momentum we needed at the right time.... It was
incredible. It was just huge."</TE>
<TE>   So was Dodger right-hander Hideo Nomo, who struggled through the
first three innings, in which he gave up three runs, two on homers by
Kent and Aurilia.</TE>
<TE>   But he closed with three scoreless innings to complete a
six-inning, three-run effort that improved him to 15-6 this season
and 11-3 with a 2.63 earned-run average against the Giants in his
career.</TE>
<TE>   Nomo has one loss in 24 starts dating to May 17, and the Dodgers
have won 20 of those games, but they had to sweat out a few tense
moments Monday after Adrian Beltre's two-run double gave them a 6-3
lead in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   With a runner on second and first base open, Tracy decided to
challenge Bonds, replacing right-hander Paul Shuey with 45-year-old
left-hander Jesse Orosco, who had limited Bonds to a .125 average
(three for 24) and one homer.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds must have been due--he lined a two-run homer, his 44th, to
right-center, trimming the Dodger lead to 6-5.</TE>
<TE>   Right-hander Paul Quantrill came on to retire Santiago on a
groundout, and Dodger first baseman Eric Karros tacked on a huge
insurance run in the bottom of the seventh when he hit his 12th homer
of the season for a 7-5 lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants made it 7-6 in the eighth when Tom Goodwin doubled and
scored on Beltre's fielding error, but Gagne got Bill Mueller to pop
to third and struck out Kenny Lofton to end the inning.</TE>
<TE>   Then came Grissom's catch in the ninth, Santiago's strikeout, and
another fist-pumping save by Gagne with the crowd on its feet.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers trailed, 3-0, in the third when Alex Cora singled and
Dave Roberts bunted for a single. With two outs, Schmidt walked Green
to load the bases.</TE>
<TE>   Up stepped Jordan, who last year hit a dramatic two-out grand slam
in the bottom of the ninth, capping a seven-run rally that gave
Atlanta an 8-5 win over the New York Mets on Sept. 29.</TE>
<TE>   Another grand slam appeared to be on Jordan's mind, because he
swung so hard at Schmidt's first pitch, a 95-mph fastball, he nearly
fell out of the batter's box.</TE>
<TE>   But instead of going with an off-speed pitch, Schmidt tried to
pump another fastball by Jordan. It was belt-high, down the middle,
and Jordan pounced on it, lining his sixth career grand slam to left
for a 4-3 lead and setting off a wild celebration throughout the
stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a lot of electricity when I hit the grand slam," said
Jordan, who has knocked in 20 runs in September. "That's the first
time I've seen the L.A. fans react that way. It excited us as a
team."</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Team Is Already Used to Life Without Brown</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Can the Dodgers miss a player they really haven't had all year? Kevin
Brown, the erstwhile ace who Monday was shut down for the remainder
of the season because of a back injury, started 10 games for the
Dodgers in 2002, throwing 63 2/3 innings and winning three games.</LD>
<LD>   He was a shadow of the right-hander who was one of baseball's most
dominant pitchers from 1996-2000, he contributed little to a team
that has remained in playoff contention all season despite his
injuries, and if the Dodgers keep reminding themselves of that fact,
they shouldn't miss Brown.</LD>
<LD>   "The team will be fine, because Kevin Brown [has started one game
in] four months, and we still have 84 wins [entering Monday night],"
General Manager Dan Evans said. "I'm not minimizing his departure,
but we will survive."</LD>
<TE>   What if the Dodgers do survive and somehow make the playoffs,
though? That's when a Brown-out could have a bigger impact, because
the Dodgers would face pitching-rich Atlanta in the division series
with a rotation that lacks a dominant ace and wouldn't appear to
match up.</TE>
<TE>   The Braves' top three starters are left-hander Tom Glavine (17-10,
2.90 earned-run average), right-hander Greg Maddux (13-6, 2.74) and
right-hander Kevin Millwood (17-7, 3.12), and left-hander Damian Moss
(11-5, 3.31) could pitch Game 4.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers, who also lost Kazuhisa Ishii to a head injury, would
counter with dependable right-hander Hideo Nomo, who matches up with
most but isn't considered dominating, young left-hander Odalis Perez
(14-9, 3.07) and either soft-throwing but inconsistent lefty Omar
Daal (11-8, 3.80) or struggling right-hander Andy Ashby (9-12, 3.71),
who has been rocked for 17 runs in 18 1/3 innings of his last four
starts.</TE>
<TE>   "At this time of the year, it isn't as much about the matchups as
it is about just going out and battling," Dodger right fielder Shawn
Green said. "Everyone's hurt in different ways, so it doesn't really
come down to which team has what players healthy. In the playoffs
[and during the stretch drive] it's just about who does enough to win
the games."</TE>
<TE>   Manager Jim Tracy made it clear Monday that Brown would not return
this season under any circumstances--even if the Dodgers reached the
World Series.</TE>
<TE>   They owe Brown $45 million over the next three years and believe
the only way they'll get some return on their investment is if Brown
takes five months to completely recover from last year's elbow
surgery and his June 11 back surgery.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was going to be great this year, and that hasn't
been the case," Brown said. "I'm gonna do what I can do [to come back
in 2003]. Obviously, it doesn't feel good right now. But I don't
think it's going to have an impact down the line."</TE>
<TE>   Right-hander Kevin Beirne, who gave up two runs in 5 1/3 solid
innings in Friday night's 5-4 loss to Colorado, will replace Brown
Wednesday night, but the Dodgers will likely use Monday's off day to
skip Beirne in the rotation next week.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just going to approach it the same way I did against the
Rockies," Beirne said. "I have a lot of respect for San Francisco,
they have a lot of hitters who can hurt you at any time. I'm just
going to go as long as I can go and try to keep the team in the
game."</TE>

<HD>The Late, Great Festival of Hate</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Dodger-Giant rivalry may seem tepid now, but back
in the day it gave meaning to the cliche 'These teams don't like each
other.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dodger Manager Jim Tracy and San Francisco Giant Manager Dusty Baker
exchanged lineup cards before the teams met Monday night in Dodger
Stadium. They did not come to blows. No player cracked a bat over the
head of the opposing catcher. No player went into the crowd to attack
a fan.</LD>
<LD>   One of baseball's longest, most storied, most bitter rivalries
resumed when the Dodgers and Giants, with a National League wild-card
berth on the line, opened a four-game series in Dodger Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   But although fans of either team still look upon the other with
disdain, with chants of "Beat L.A.! Beat L.A.!" echoing through
Pacific Bell Park in San Francisco and "Giants [stink]!, Giants
[stink]!" in Dodger Stadium, the violence and contempt that marked
this rivalry from its origins in New York and for several decades on
the West Coast has subsided.</LD>
<TE>   "The fans make it a rivalry," Dodger outfielder Marquis Grissom
said. "There's no animosity between [Dodger players] and the Giants."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't always that way. These teams hated each other in the
early 1900s, when the Giants played in New York's Polo Grounds and
the Dodgers in Brooklyn's Ebbets Field. That bad blood followed the
teams when the Giants moved to San Francisco and the Dodgers to Los
Angeles in 1958.</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Thomson's "shot heard round the world," the dramatic
three-run homer that gave the Giants a 5-4 pennant-clinching victory
over the Dodgers in 1951, is the defining moment of this rivalry, and
rightly so.</TE>
<TE>   But there were so many more memorable moments--on the field and
off--that fueled a century-long rivalry that has involved such
legends as Sandy Koufax, Don Drysdale, Jackie Robinson, Duke Snider,
Willie Mays, Juan Marichal, Barry Bonds, Leo Durocher and John
McGraw, and teams that have combined for 13 World Series
championships and 37 pennants.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1920s, when McGraw, who managed the Giants from 1903-1932,
and his players traveled over the Brooklyn Bridge in horse-drawn
carriages for games in Ebbets Field, Dodger fans pelted the Giants
with beer, coins, umbrella parts, "whatever they could find," said
Hall of Fame broadcaster Vin Scully, voice of the Dodgers for 53
years.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants were in first place late in the 1934 season when
then-Manager Bill Terry, in a discussion with reporters about pennant
contenders, was asked what he thought about the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   "The Dodgers?" Terry asked, incredulously. "Are they still in the
league?"</TE>
<TE>   A motivated Dodger team beat the Giants in the season's last two
games, knocking them two games behind the pennant-winning St. Louis
Cardinals.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a psychological thing about the rivalry back then,"
said Scully, who grew up a huge Giant fan in the Washington Heights
section of Manhattan. "Brooklyn was the borough of immigrants, of
trolley cars, of ordinary buildings and ordinary lives. If you came
from Brooklyn, you were the butt of jokes.</TE>
<TE>   "Manhattan, with its lordly spires and tall buildings, was seen as
superior, and that built up a lot of resentment in people from
Brooklyn."</TE>
<TE>   Scully worked at the general post office in New York as a
teenager, sorting mail, along with an assortment of Dodger, Giant and
Yankee fans.</TE>
<TE>   "We spent all our hours arguing about baseball," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Though three teams played in New York--Yankee Stadium is in the
Bronx--the Giants and Dodgers were bigger rivals because they played
each other all season in the National League and would face the
American League Yankees only in the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest thing about the rivalry then was the proximity of the
fans," Scully said. "They were shoulder to shoulder, and they
irritated each other all year long. I remembered arguing about the
Dodgers and Giants on Christmas Day."</TE>
<TE>   Players often competed against each other as they rose through the
Giant and Dodger farm systems, and that familiarity bred contempt in
the big leagues, so much so that when Robinson was traded from
Brooklyn to New York after the 1957 season, he chose to retire rather
than play for the Giants.</TE>
<TE>   In 1952, the year after Thomson's memorable home run, Giant
pitcher Sheldon Jones beaned Dodger outfielder Carl Furillo, then
later that September, Giant pitcher Ruben Gomez hit Furillo with a
pitch.</TE>
<TE>   Furillo thought Durocher, a former Dodger who then was the Giants'
manager, had ordered the hit, and when he got to first base, he
motioned for Durocher to come out of the dugout. Durocher did the
same, challenging Furillo to a fight, and Furillo charged the dugout,
tackling Durocher and sparking a nasty brawl.</TE>
<TE>   "That put more gasoline on the fire," Scully said.</TE>
<TE>   A few years later, Giant pitcher Sal "the Barber" Maglie, who
earned his nickname by throwing fastballs under the chins of opposing
batters, knocked down several Dodgers in a game.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson, a former UCLA running back, deliberately dropped a bunt
down the first-base line, hoping that Maglie would cover first "so he
could knock him into right field," Scully recalled. But diminutive
second baseman Davey Williams covered the bag instead.</TE>
<TE>   "Jackie was in a rage, and all he saw was a Giant uniform, and he
just crushed Williams," Scully said. "I think that ended Williams'
career."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers and Giants were tied atop the National League
standings with 101-61 records in 1962, forcing a three-game playoff
for the pennant. With Game 1 in Candlestick Park, Giant Manager Alvin
Dark ordered groundskeeper Matty Schwab to soak the basepaths to slow
Dodger speedster Maury Wills, who had stolen 104 bases that season.</TE>
<TE>   "There wasn't a cloud in the sky," Scully said, "and the infield
was drowned."</TE>
<TE>   The Giants beat Koufax and the Dodgers that day, 8-0, and won the
playoff, scoring four runs in the ninth inning of Game 3 for a 6-4
victory and a World Series berth.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the ugliest incident of the rivalry occurred on Aug. 22,
1965, when Giant pitcher Marichal, angry that Dodger catcher John
Roseboro had whizzed his throw back to Koufax right under Marichal's
nose, hit Roseboro over the head with a bat, sparking a bloody
14-minute melee.</TE>
<TE>   In 1973, when Tom Lasorda was a Dodger coach and Charlie Fox was
managing the Giants, they approached home plate in Candlestick Park
to exchange lineup cards before a game.</TE>
<TE>   "The next thing I know, they were punching each other," Scully
said. "It was nuts."</TE>
<TE>   Later that decade, Dodger outfielder Reggie Smith, reacting to a
racial slur from behind the Dodger dugout in Candlestick, went into
the crowd and attacked a fan.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if it was the cold, damp weather in Candlestick,"
Scully said, "but the fans there had a meanness about them."</TE>
<TE>   On the field, each team seemed to take an almost perverse pleasure
in ruining the other's season. The Giants celebrated long and hard
after Joe Morgan's home run had given San Francisco a 5-3 win over
the Dodgers in the last game of the 1982 season, knocking the Dodgers
one game behind Atlanta in the NL West and out of the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants spoiled the Dodgers' season in 1991 by beating them
twice in the final three games, leaving them two games behind Atlanta
and out of the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers got revenge in 1993 with a 12-1 victory over San
Francisco on the final day of the season. That knocked the Giants out
of the playoffs, despite San Francisco's 103-59 record.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the recent tension between the teams has been in the front
office. The Dodgers refused to wear 1951 replica jerseys last season,
when the Giants wanted to commemorate the 50th anniversary of
Thomson's home run, and twice this season, they have refused to honor
Giant requests to change game times to ease travel.</TE>
<TE>   "But I don't sense the real bitterness that I sensed back in New
York," Scully said. "I think the difference is the 450 miles that
separate San Francisco and L.A. The distance has cooled it off to
some degree."</TE>

<CX>   Baseball--Former New York Giant manager Bill Terry's comment about
the Dodgers' pennant chances in 1934--"The Dodgers? Are they still in
the league?"--was made before the start of the 1934 season, not
during the pennant race, as was reported in a Sports story Tuesday on

<LD>If you judge a horse by the company it keeps, you have to be
impressed with Pine For Java in the featured Beau Brummel Stakes at
Fairplex today. A winner in his fourth race, he has since chased home
a nice one in Crowned Dancer in the Hollywood Juvenile, and in his
most recent start, at Del Mar in August, he finished second to Bob
Baffert's rising star Vindication, who came back over the weekend to
win the Kentucky Cup Juvenile in impressive fashion.</LD>
<LD>   There are no such heavyweights waiting to greet Pine For Java
today, and he should be hard to deny in the 6 1/2-furlong race with
anything near a repeat of that last seaside effort, where he bobbled
at the start but made a solid move to finish only a length and a
piece behind Vindication.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, these are 2-year-olds racing around tight turns, so
anything can happen. That said, the Pine Bluff colt is trained by
Caesar Dominguez, who knows a thing or two about getting them ready
for this meet, and will be ridden by the veteran G.F. Almeida.</LD>
<TE>   Hell Cat is also getting away from the big guns for this
assignment and goes for a hot combination in trainer Jack Carava and
bullring king Martin Pedroza. The son of Tabasco Cat came from out of
the clouds to win his debut at Del Mar last month, then was thrown
into the deep end in the Best Pal Stakes and got into gear much too
late to make a serious impact.</TE>

<HD>Women to Cool Protest?</HD>
<DH>Golf: National Council of Women's Organizations considers
relaxing its push to open Augusta to female members.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Can Augusta National Golf Club and the National Council of Women's
Organizations hug and make up?</LD>
<LD>   For the first time since the bitter dispute over permitting women
to become members of the exclusive club began three months ago, a
cooling-off period may be in the works. Martha Burk, chairwoman of
the NCWO, raised the possibility Monday that the group would consider
calling a halt to its campaign to pressure Augusta National to admit
a female member before the Masters in April.</LD>
<LD>   "That option is not off the table," Burk said. "It's certainly not
out of the realm of possibility.</LD>
<TE>   "I have thought about that idea, but this issue goes on and we go
on as it develops.</TE>
<TE>   "If our involvement is what is keeping them from inviting women
into that club and we remove ourselves, we've taken away their
excuse. But we've been used as an excuse all along."</TE>
<TE>   Burk said she does not consider the potential approach as
"extending an olive branch."</TE>
<TE>   Said Burk: "If anyone is going to be extending an olive branch,
they should be doing it to me."</TE>
<TE>   Sources with firsthand knowledge of the ongoing dispute believe
that if the women's group takes more of a dovish approach, there is a
chance that Augusta National will add a female member, possibly
before the Masters.</TE>
<TE>   It also is believed that when Augusta National throws opens its
doors for female members, more than one will enter. Speculation about
who would be invited centers on former United States Golf Assn.
President Judy Bell, the first woman to lead the USGA; U.S. Supreme
Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the first female justice to sit on
the Supreme Court; and Carole Semple Thompson, winner of multiple
amateur championships. However, insiders at the club say they have
not heard discussions involving the name of any potential member.</TE>
<TE>   Bell, who runs the USGA's grants and fellowship program in
Colorado Springs, Colo., says no one from Augusta National has
contacted her to gauge her interest in becoming a member.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm certainly not opposed to it," said Bell, who indicated that
at least some of her views run contrary to the NCWO's position.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see the club and the Masters as being one entity. I also
think that's why people join clubs, to pick who they want to be
members and who they feel comfortable with.</TE>
<TE>   "So I'll just cross that bridge if I come to it. For any new
member, it's going to take some thought, if it's going to happen. But
I have to say I don't have a problem with all the Masters has done
for golf compared to this issue. If it's going to happen, and women
are going to become members, it's got to be done with a lot of
thought and not just as a reaction to this group, Martha Burk and her
group."</TE>
<TE>   Burk and the NCWO have pressed Augusta National since June when
she sent a letter to club chairman Hootie Johnson asking to discuss
female membership at the club and also about adding a female member
before the 2003 Masters. Johnson responded angrily and issued a
strongly worded three-page statement in which he said that the club
might allow female members at some time, but "not at the point of a
bayonet."</TE>
<TE>   The controversy escalated three weeks ago when Johnson dropped the
Masters' television sponsors on CBS--Citigroup, Coca-Cola and
IBM--after learning that Burk planned to question the companies about
their association with a tournament held at a club she says
"discriminates against women."</TE>
<TE>   Augusta National, founded in 1932 by Bobby Jones, has about 300
members. The club has no official policy to exclude women, but it has
never had a female member. The first African American invited to play
the Masters tournament, began in 1934, was Lee Elder in 1975. The
first African American became a member of Augusta National in 1990.
Women are allowed to play the course, but as guests.</TE>
<TE>   Any change in the direction for the NCWO would signal that the
organization succeeded in shining its intended spotlight on the
membership issue at Augusta National and also was able to take the
idea of female membership in front of a nationwide stage.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not about winning or losing; it's about breaking down a
barrier," Burk said.</TE>
<TE>   She also indicated a flexibility in the demand for a female member
before next April's tournament, establishing something of a grace
period of undetermined length.</TE>
<TE>   "Not years, for sure," Burk said.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Augusta National had no comment. Johnson is the
only Augusta National member cleared to make statements for the club,
but he is recovering from heart surgery Friday and unavailable for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, a spokesman for the PGA Tour said he could not comment.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the NCWO is pressing on with its plans to
contact CBS and call into question the network's affiliation with
what Burk has called a club that practices discriminatory policies.
She said the NCWO lawyers are reviewing her letter to CBS and that
she expects to receive approval to send it when her board of
directors meets Wednesday in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Burk said she follows a chain of command.</TE>
<TE>   "Unlike Hootie Johnson, I don't make decisions unilaterally," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Burk said she also intends to contact Augusta National members and
investigate how their dues are paid.</TE>
<TE>   However, Burk termed both tactics as "options," just as she
described a potential cooling-off period as an option. She said there
is a certain amount of faith involved in such a plan.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd be taking them at their word, give them an opportunity and
we'll see if they'll do what they say they'll do."</TE>
<TE>   If this new approach is taken and if Augusta National, no longer
challenged, changes the nature of its membership, Burk said her
response will be simple.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to gloat. We'll just congratulate them and get
back to what we do."</TE>

<TE>   The life of a jockey would appear to be glamorous and lucrative.
But there is a flip side. To make weight, a lot of jockeys resort to
self-induced vomiting. In horse racing, they call it "flipping."</TE>
<TE>   This practice is examined on this edition of "Real Sports."
Correspondent Bernard Goldberg calls it, "horse racing's dirty little
secret."</TE>
<TE>   Jockey Randy Romero, who retired in 1999 after a 20-year career
and more than 4,000 victories, suffers from liver and kidney failure
after years of flipping.</TE>
<TE>   Romero says he would throw up three or four times a day. "I was so
hungry all the time," he says, "but I could keep no food in me
because it would be too much weight." Romero estimates five or six of
every 10 jockeys flip.</TE>
<TE>   Shane Shellers and Chris McCarron tell Goldberg they did it, and
Laffit Pincay says he did at one time. McCarron says he has never
admitted to it before. "Only my wife knew," he says.</TE>
<TE>   There is a movement underway to raise the weights, which were set
a century ago. But not everyone is in favor. Trainer Wayne Lukas
says, "We're not asking these people to do it for a medal or
anything. We're asking them to do it for some serious cause, and I
think if you want to use the word 'sacrifice,' they are going to have
to make some of these sacrifices to perform. Or they should get
another job. That may sound cold, but that's reality."</TE>
<TE>   Jockey Pat Day says what is needed is more discipline and better
diets. "I love Randy Romero," he says, "but he could always be found
in one of three places--on the track, in the kitchen, eating, or in
the bathroom, flipping."</TE>
<TE>   This "Real Sports" edition includes segments on minor league owner
Mike Veeck and former San Diego Padre Nate Colbert.</TE>

<LD>Bob Meyers couldn't have imagined this when he started the girls'
golf program at Canyon Country Canyon High four years ago, but there
he was during the first week at school, putting up signs across the
campus, making announcements over the public-address system and
advertising in the school bulletin.</LD>
<LD>   Meyers desperately needed players. He had only four out for the
team, and the Southern Section requires a minimum of five to compete.</LD>
<LD>   "This rule is killing us," Meyers said. "I really didn't think it
would be this hard to find players."</LD>
<TE>   At a school of about 2,800 in the suburban Santa Clarita Valley,
it shouldn't be. Luckily, two girls responded to the pleas and the
Cowboys will have a team, but other schools aren't as fortunate.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the California Interscholastic Federation mandated a
change in the minimum number of players on girls' teams from three to
five because of a gender-equity complaint. The ruling led to four
schools dropping teams, several others scrapping plans to start teams
and countless others forcing unskilled players into the heat of
varsity competition.</TE>
<TE>   The effects of the ruling are trickling into this season.
Riverside King, for example, will not field a girls' team even though
its student body includes Nicole Smith, the defending section
individual champion, and Summer Scholl, who tied for ninth at the
CIF-WSCGA finals. Smith and Scholl will play on the boys' team in the
spring, as they did last season.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have enough girls to fill a squad," King Athletic
Director Tony Masi said. "We're trying. All we would need is three
girls who can carry a bag. They just aren't there."</TE>
<TE>   An informal survey of coaches revealed across-the-board
uncertainty as to which team has the depth to win this season.</TE>
<TE>   "Most teams have two or three good players," said Art McKarns of
South Torrance, ranked No. 7 in The Times' preseason poll. "But after
that, you don't know what you're going to get. If we were still
playing three scores, it would be easier to identify the top teams.
The depth of players just isn't there yet for the girls."</TE>
<TE>   Ninth-ranked San Clemente, a school in golf-crazy southern Orange
County, will get by this season with five players.</TE>
<TE>   "We're lucky enough to have 16 girls in our program," Coach Mike
Hurlbut said. "But we only have five ready for varsity."</TE>
<TE>   Readiness is not an issue at Canyon, where Meyers will use a
player who picked up a club for the first time in practice this week.</TE>
<TE>   Meyers said she whiffs often.</TE>
<TE>   "I love her to death because she never cries," Meyers said. "It
can be embarrassing, but she's a trooper."</TE>
<TE>   Meyers is willing to take players under his wing, as long as they
can commit to the team, so he offered one more plea for players.</TE>
<TE>   "If you can walk and chew gum," he said, "you can play golf on the
Canyon girls' team."</TE>

<DH>Kwan is the exception to medals-driven marketability</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>She is accustomed to performing under bright lights and suffocating
pressure, but giving life to an animated Disney character isn't an
everyday occurrence for Michelle Kwan.</LD>
<LD>   Alone in a glassed-in Hollywood recording studio, dwarfed by a
huge headset and microphone, Kwan reviews her three lines in "Mulan
2," a direct-to-video release scheduled for 2004. A window separates
her from the control room, where engineers, artists and writers wait
expectantly.</LD>
<LD>   "You're making me nervous," says Kwan, a four-time world figure
skating champion, six-time U.S. champion and two-time Olympic
medalist.</LD>
<TE>   Not to worry.</TE>
<TE>   "You're going to do it a million times," Jamie Thomason, head of
casting for Disney TV and animation says soothingly. "We do it with
everybody."</TE>
<TE>   She takes a deep breath, then utters Line 506.</TE>
<TE>   "We just got in some excellent ginger," says Kwan, the voice of a
shopkeeper named Michelle.</TE>
<TE>   Try it again, she's told. Faster. Slower. Perky.</TE>
<TE>   She does. Finally, there are several versions editors can choose
from when the scene is assembled. It's on to Line 509.</TE>
<TE>   "How about some fresh ginseng?" she asks brightly.</TE>
<TE>   Again, please. Whispered. Louder. Enticing.</TE>
<TE>   Another series of takes, then an "in" joke conceived to elicit
laughs from kids because it sounds funny and guffaws from those who
know skating lingo.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a special today," she says, leaning forward and mugging
for a nonexistent camera. "Fresh salchow. Yum, yum."</TE>
<TE>   She's a hit. As a reward, she gets to do another line, the
comically drawn-out wail of someone who nearly falls but pulls off a
Kwan-like, graceful landing. She's finished in about 35 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, you're good at this," Thomason says.</TE>
<TE>   Kwan is relieved.</TE>
<TE>   "Can you imagine doing 100 pages?" she asks.</TE>
<TE>   Someday she might, and not merely as the voice of someone else's
creation.</TE>
<TE>   "The sky's the limit," Mike Mendenhall, president of marketing and
synergy for Walt Disney Studios, says of her potential. "To us, she's
a great role model for kids and teens. She truly has the right
attitude, the right ethics, the right personality. She's
contemporary. She's relevant."</TE>
<TE>   Her "Mulan 2" work was part of her three-year agreement to be
Disney's global spokeswoman, the company's most extensive deal with
an athlete. It eclipses a five-year deal Disney made with golfer
Tiger Woods a year ago, because his is for broadcast work only. Hers
extends to parks, radio, theatrical, video and voice-overs.</TE>
<TE>   Terms were completed during the Salt Lake City Olympics but
weren't announced until a few weeks later, after the 22-year-old
Torrance native had stumbled in the free skate and earned a bronze
medal instead of the expected gold. Though it was Kwan's second
successive Olympic disappointment, following a narrow loss to
15-year-old Tara Lipinski at Nagano in 1998, Mendenhall said he had
no qualms about proceeding.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, General Motors' Chevrolet division ignored her Salt
Lake City result and extended its endorsement deal with her after the
Games.</TE>
<TE>   "To be honest, we got a lot of questions after the Olympics," said
Dianne Harper, a promotional manager for Chevrolet. "Like, 'She
didn't win the gold medal, so ... ' And I was, like, 'Yeah, and your
point?'</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't matter. It's who she is, and her value to us doesn't
decrease because she doesn't have a gold medal. The original reasons
we liked Michelle hold up today."</TE>
<TE>   That won't change, Harper said, even if Kwan doesn't compete this
season, a decision she will make in the next week or two.</TE>
<TE>   Figure skating season has begun, but Kwan hasn't entered any Grand
Prix events and hasn't decided if she will compete at the 2003 U.S.
Championships in Dallas, the qualifying event for the World
Championships in March in Washington. She has competed in every U.S.
championship event since 1993 and every world meet since 1994, and
has won seven world medals, the most by a U.S. skater.</TE>
<TE>   After performing in all 93 shows of the five-month Champions on
Ice tour, Kwan took a break and only last week, resumed training at
L.A.-area rinks. She hasn't hired a coach, although she has said she
would if she continued competing. She has been busy with her Disney
duties and with deciding whether her best chance for fulfillment lies
on film or on the ice, chasing the one honor that has eluded her.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of opportunities," she said. "It's very nice to
have those options, but those decisions are tough. So many doors are
open, you don't know which is the right one, and it's pretty scary
for me. I'm 22 and I'm making life-altering decisions."</TE>
<TE>   Of the 34 U.S. teams or individuals who won medals at Salt Lake
City, Kwan was the big winner commercially. Glory for snowboarders
and short-track speedskaters melted at winter's end, but Kwan's star
remained bright after she'd finished behind U.S. rival Sarah Hughes
and Russia's Irina Slutskaya.</TE>
<TE>   Figure skating is the Games' marquee event, and the women's gold
medalist usually gets the most chances to cash in. Hughes, who turned
17 in May, appeared on a Wheaties box and signed with General
Electric to skate in two NBC specials. She is also a spokesperson for
Campbell's soup. Slutskaya joined Kwan in the Champions on Ice tour,
but Kwan got the highest salary in the cast, which included men's
medalists Alexei Yagudin, Evgeni Plushenko and Tim Goebel. Kwan,
whose contract goes for four more years, earned more than $1 million
for her performances.</TE>
<TE>   She also got the biggest ovations from fans, which she deems
priceless.</TE>
<TE>   "It's more a reassurance, not like a pity," she says. "Reassurance
like, 'Hey, you know, it doesn't matter. Life's not perfect.' kind of
attitude.... They realize the pain. That's the wrong word. That
that's the way life goes sometimes. You have to kind of shrug your
shoulders and move on."</TE>
<TE>   Said tour producer Tom Collins: "I've been in skating 55 years and
I've never seen anyone handle things so well, good or bad. A lot of
it was bad at the two Olympics, but she accepted her defeat with
graciousness.... The world wanted Michelle Kwan to win the gold. She
didn't, and still they love her, they care for her and they feel for
her."</TE>
<TE>   Advertisers agree, believing she embodies desirable traits such as
perseverance and dependability, if not the white-hot flash of
gold-medal glory.</TE>
<TE>   Kwan is especially attractive in uncertain economic times, sports
marketing expert Nova Lanktree said. Kwan says and does the right
things, she's untainted by the scandals that have clouded the pairs
and ice dance events, and her grace in defeat at Nagano "became part
of an ongoing drama."</TE>
<TE>   Kwan's Disney deal, estimated at $1 million a year, provides for
appearances at Disney theme parks in China and Hong Kong, on Disney
Channel programs and possibly ABC sitcoms, and doing voices in
"Mulan" sequels.</TE>
<TE>   During a rare day off from Champions on Ice, she spent a morning
in Pasadena filming scenes that will be references for animation
drawings of a figure skating competition between Minnie Mouse and
Daisy Duck in the movie "Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas." She had
blisters on her feet and the cold numbed her legs, but she soldiered
on, smiling, twirling a ribbon and handing "Daisy" a bouquet.</TE>
<TE>   Disney executives gush about her, saying she transcends ethnicity,
gender and Olympic disappointments to register strongly with kids and
teens, the company's prime audience. She was voted the most-admired
athlete in last month's Miss Teen USA pageant and won the Teen Choice
and Nickelodeon Kids' Choice awards.</TE>
<TE>   Although it was speculated that the Japanese heritage of 1992
Olympic gold medalist Kristi Yamaguchi minimized her endorsement
offers, Kwan's heritage as the daughter of Chinese immigrants seems
irrelevant. If anything, Mendenhall said, it's a plus for Disney
because her ability to speak Chinese will be useful in promoting its
Hong Kong and Shanghai parks.</TE>
<TE>   "Here's a woman who's so well-rounded and is diverse," he said.
"We never really even considered that. You just look at the type of
person she is, the qualities she brings within her personality, her
leadership, focus, commitment. Staying with something, staying
committed to something. 'Don't let minor disappointments along the
way keep you from your dreams, kids. Follow your dream.' It's about
passion, and for me that's so much more."</TE>
<TE>   One of Kwan's requests of Chevrolet was that it create
scholarships for young women. The Michelle Kwan R.E.W.A.R.D.S program
(Recognizing Excellence of Women in Academics &amp; Rewarding Dynamic
Student-athletes) gave 10 college-bound women scholarships of $5,000
each, based on academic, athletic and civic achievements. Kwan calls
herself "a proud mama."</TE>
<TE>   Lanktree calls it remarkable.</TE>
<TE>   "What's unusual is, people are actually putting out money for it,"
Lanktree said. "Money is really tight and new production is down.
Being that the corporate world is getting horrible press, GM is smart
to associate with someone who has youth, beauty, grace, dignity. You
probably could not calculate the value that gives them."</TE>
<TE>   The winners were flown to Southern California to meet Kwan and
pose with her for an ad that will run in youth-oriented magazines in
October and November. The set resembled a college dorm, and they
dressed for a sleepover, re-creating a part of life Kwan enjoyed only
briefly. She lived in a dorm at UCLA for a few months before the
demands of skating pushed her off campus and, eventually, out of
school.</TE>
<TE>   "It was girl talk," said Kwan, who has about a year's worth of
credits. "I miss those times when you were sitting and just talking."</TE>
<TE>   And she wants to finish college, "regardless of what age,"
although she fears she won't fit in on campus if she waits much
longer.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to be able to juggle relationships and your personal
life and skating," she said. "The hard part for any athlete is, we
have a hard time separating our lives. Then you say, 'What is fun?'
We consider fun in skating to be succeeding, landing jumps, and then
when you come home, it's love and friendship."</TE>
<TE>   In some respects, Kwan said, she felt younger than her 17-and
18-year-old guests.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a manager who makes decisions, and I have my parents to
help me make decisions," she said. "I'm very protected, and that's
good. Those girls are the ones who have to do the [scholarship and
college] applications. When they go off to school it's, 'You're on
your own, baby.' "</TE>
<TE>   And she was touched by their insistence that she had won their
respect without having won Olympic gold. She is still trying to make
that same peace with herself.</TE>
<TE>   "That means a lot," she said. "For me, it feels sometimes like it
would have made a difference. People would have looked at me a little
different. Then again, it's hard to say what it's like because I've
only known one thing, and that's not having it.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, understanding that if it doesn't ever happen, if I don't
compete to 2006, [it's a matter of] being happy with what I've done.
It's so much easier said than done. I'm like, 'Oh, yeah, I could live
without it. There's only a handful of people that have it in the
U.S.'</TE>
<TE>   "But it's hard. Right now I'm in the process of making decisions.
It's easy to say, 'I won the big one, now I'm walking away,' but it
hardly ever goes that way."</TE>

<HD>Scioscia Looks to the Playoffs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>That one-game-at-a-time mantra has served Mike Scioscia and his
Angels handsomely, but the manager wasn't fooling anyone Monday.</LD>
<LD>   He was clearly looking ahead, thinking about the Oct. 1 playoff
opener.</LD>
<LD>   Scioscia framed it in terms of flexibility during the last week of
the season, but in making it official, in saying that Jarrod Washburn
will face the Oakland A's tonight on three days' rest, he was
unofficially saying that Washburn will start the Angels' first
playoff game since 1986.</LD>
<TE>   The way Scioscia put it is that if the decision to move his 18-5
ace up a day works the way he envisions, "the postseason slot will be
there for him."</TE>
<TE>   He would add, of course, that the Angels have to get there first,
but get real.</TE>
<TE>   Only a mathematics nerd would think Seattle and Boston are still
alive in the wild-card race.</TE>
<TE>   The only question confronting the Angels is this:</TE>
<TE>   Do they open the playoffs as American League West champions,
meeting the Minnesota Twins with home-field advantage in Games 1, 2
and 5 of the best-of-five series, or do they go to New York to open
against the Yankees as the wild card?</TE>
<TE>   If the answer could be clearer by Thursday's conclusion of this
four-game rematch with the A's, it seemed to come as news in the East
Bay that the AL West lead is at stake.</TE>
<TE>   Coming off their playoff-caliber series in Anaheim last week, the
Angels and A's played the opener before about 35,000 empty seats and
a crowd of 22,326 at the Networks Associates Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the Giants were battling the Dodgers on television.</TE>
<TE>   And with the A's and Angels virtually assured of a playoff berth,
some potential patrons may have concluded, "what's the big deal?"</TE>
<TE>   Too bad.</TE>
<TE>   They missed the fifth straight bell ringer in this home-and-home
series. They missed the A's wiping out Troy Glaus' three-run homer in
the first inning and winning, 4-3, as Miguel Tejada resumed his
most-valuable-player antics with a decisive single in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Big deal?</TE>
<TE>   Well, the A's and Angels are tied for the West lead, and Oakland
Manager Art Howe said it is big indeed because "we're looking at
bragging rights and home-field advantage and the fact that nothing is
clinched yet.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't think both teams want the division title, why do you
think the Angels are moving Washburn up tomorrow? They want him set
up to pitch the playoff opener."</TE>
<TE>   Does he think that's premature?</TE>
<TE>   "It's not for me to question," Howe said. "I have respect for
everybody on their side."</TE>
<TE>   That may be true, but are the A's juggling? Are the A's looking at
the playoffs? Are the A's thinking of starting only their Big Three
of Barry Zito, Mark Mulder and Tim Hudson in that five-game opening
series.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to think about the postseason," Oakland General
Manager Billy Beane said. "We don't talk about what we'd do if we get
there. It's not superstition. I just don't want to set myself up to
look stupid."</TE>
<TE>   Now here comes Washburn, making his first start on three days rest
since he was pitching at double-A in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   No problem, he predicted.</TE>
<TE>   "I like pitching, and the sooner the better when I'm healthy," he
said. "Last year at this time I wouldn't have been able to do it, but
the way my body feels now it's like the first month of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think any of us would be thinking about doing this if we
felt there was going to be a problem."</TE>
<TE>   By starting on short rest tonight, Washburn will come back on
regular rest to face Seattle Sunday. Then, deciding on the status of
the race, he would start on three days' rest against Texas on Sept.
26 or on four days rest against Seattle on Sept. 27, the first game
of the final series. If the race isn't a factor, it is believed
Washburn will throw a few innings against the Rangers on the 26th,
allowing him to come back in the playoff opener on full rest.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, with three starts, Washburn has a shot at becoming the
first Angel to win 20 games since Nolan Ryan in 1974. That, too, is a
goal ("any pitcher who says it isn't is probably lying," Washburn
said), but the "main goal is to win the division. If I'm chosen to
pitch the first game of the playoffs it will be an achievement when
you consider the caliber of our staff. I'll feel pretty much like I
did when I was chosen to pitch the season opener. Of course, I'd be
honored to start any game in the playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Washburn opened the season on the disabled list because
of a strep throat, lost 12 pounds over the course of the summer,
never pitched after Aug. 8 because of shoulder tendinitis and
finished 11-10.</TE>
<TE>   This year, he said, he has been strong from start to near finish,
and he has tried to protect his stamina and stability by not throwing
between starts for the last month.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel that my mechanics have been good enough that I can get
away that, and I want to stay as fresh as I can," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, when you're asked to pitch important games at this
time of the year, the adrenaline can take the edge off any soreness."</TE>
<TE>   More than a physical concern, the Angels had worried about
Washburn's mental reaction to the recent public exposure that he was
being investigated for alleged sexual assault. The Orange County
District Attorney did not prosecute because of insufficient evidence,
and Washburn dismissed his club's concern by working 7 1/3 strong
innings of a victory over Texas last Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The short rest won't prompt him to change his approach, Washburn
said.</TE>
<TE>   He is 1-1 with a 6.55 earned-run average against the A's this year
and 5-6 with a 4.03 ERA in his career. However, looking ahead,
Washburn said, "I'm hoping to have a lot of fun over the next two
weeks, and to even more over the three after that."</TE>

<LD>Patrick Ewing, an 11-time All-Star in 17 NBA seasons, called a news
conference for today amid speculation he is going to announce his
retirement.</LD>
<LD>   The news conference, to be held at a midtown Manhattan hotel, was
arranged by a public relations firm, leading to the speculation that
Ewing, 40, will retire from the NBA.</LD>
<LD>   The New York Times, New York Daily News and Boston Globe, all
citing sources close to Ewing, said on their Web sites that he would
announce his retirement.</LD>
<TE>   Ewing played with the Orlando Magic last season, but he and the
team announced last month he would not return next season. There was
one season left on Ewing's contract, reportedly worth just over $2
million.</TE>
<TE>   Ewing played his first 15 seasons with the New York Knicks and
then one in Seattle before joining Orlando.</TE>
<TE>   He has averaged 21 points and 9.8 rebounds, and in 1997 he was
selected one of the NBA's 50 greatest players.</TE>
<TE>   Ewing's season with Orlando was his least productive. He averaged
6.0 points and 4.0 rebounds in 13.9 minutes--all career lows.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland center Zydrunas Ilgauskas was arrested at Bay Village,
Ohio, on a charge of driving under the influence.</TE>
<TE>   Ilgauskas, 27, was stopped Sunday for erratic driving and he
failed field sobriety tests, police Lt. John Dixon said.</TE>
<TE>   He was released on a personal bond and must appear Wednesday in
court.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Boston signed Argentine forward Ruben Wolkowyski.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-10 Wolkowyski played last season with the Dallas
Mavericks before moving to CSKA Moscow in the Russian Superleague,
where he averaged 12.7 points and 7.8 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Wolkowyski played 34 games with Seattle during the 2000-2001
season, averaging 2.2 points and 1.4 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sheryl Swoopes scored 20 points and the U.S. beat Lithuania,
105-48, and advanced to the second round of the Women's World
Basketball Championship at Shanghai.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Leslie had 15 points for the Americans, who won their three
first-round games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Golf</TE>
<TE>   Greg Norman, who won the Skins Game last year, isn't coming back
to defend his title, but Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson, Mark O'Meara
and Fred Couples will be on hand to play in the $1-million event Nov.
29-Dec. 1 at Landmark Golf Club in Indio.</TE>
<TE>   The four-player field was announced Monday. So was a change in the
rules that no longer requires a player who makes a birdie to
"validate" that birdie by winning or matching the low score on the
next hole in order to collect the money.</TE>
<TE>   Patty Sheehan will remain captain of the U.S. Solheim Cup team in
2003.</TE>
<TE>   Sheehan, who leads the 2002 team into play against Europe
beginning Friday, was selected captain by a five-member committee
formed by the LPGA board of directors.</TE>

<HD>Eagles Win a Laugher</HD>
<DH>Pro football: Spurrier's Redskin offense comes up empty as
Philadelphia runs away with 37-7 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LANDOVER, Md.</DL>
<LD>If he didn't know it already, Washington Redskin Coach Steve Spurrier
got an excruciating two-part lesson Monday night before a national TV
audience:</LD>
<LD>   Part One: The NFL is not the Southeastern Conference.</LD>
<LD>   Part Two: The Philadelphia Eagles are not the Arizona Cardinals.</LD>
<TE>   Looking frustrated, bedraggled and not the least bit amused,
Spurrier watched the Eagles roll to a 37-7 victory in a game delayed
seven minutes when pepper spray wafted onto the visiting sideline.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the much-ballyhooed Redskin offense got another type of
scare.</TE>
<TE>   A week after barnstorming to a 31-23 victory over Arizona, the
Redskins crossed the 50-yard line once (thanks to a dubious
roughing-the-passer call) and collected 179 yards.</TE>
<TE>   The Redskins' only touchdown came on a punt return.</TE>
<TE>   "We got clobbered," Spurrier said. "Philadelphia outplayed us and
out-coached us. I apologize to Redskin fans."</TE>
<TE>   Had Spurrier been wearing a visor, he would have thrown it into
the upper deck. Instead, the $5 million-a-year coach let loose with a
lip-flapping raspberry that "Monday Night Football" caught on camera
and played over and over in super-slo-mo.</TE>
<TE>   The Redskins changed quarterbacks at halftime--Danny Wuerffel
replaced Shane Matthews, who left because of a sore shoulder--but
their worst quarterback problem was wearing a Philadelphia uniform.
Donovan McNabb ran for a touchdown, threw for two more, and generally
made life miserable for the Redskin defense.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have a quarterback like McNabb you have to get to him,"
said linebacker Jeremiah Trotter, who defected from the Eagles to the
Redskins before the season.</TE>
<TE>   "When he gets outside the pocket, we've all got to swarm to him
and bring him down."</TE>
<TE>   Dorsey Levens led all rushers with 65 yards in six carries, most
of the yards coming on a 47-yard touchdown run. Teammate Duce Staley
had 22 touches (15 carries, seven catches); James Thrash and Jeff
Thomason caught touchdown passes.</TE>
<TE>   With 451 yards, the Eagles nearly tripled the Redskin output.</TE>
<TE>   With 6:38 remaining and the outcome essentially decided, the game
took a bizarre turn. There was a fight in the stands behind the Eagle
bench, and a Prince George's County police officer trying to break it
up was pulled into the skirmish. One or more of the other officers
used pepper spray to end the incident, but the powerful cooling fans
aimed at the players caused the spray to spread.</TE>
<TE>   When the stadium announcer informed the crowd a substance had been
released near the Eagle bench, the spectators and players quickly
moved out of the area, holding hands, T-shirts, jerseys, anything to
cover their faces. Officials conferred at midfield to discuss what to
do next.</TE>
<TE>   "You just want to take precautions," said Washington linebacker
Jesse Armstead, who breathed through a towel until the all-clear
announcement. "We've all got families. I was ready to get out of
there if it came to that."</TE>
<TE>   The Redskin offense could have used a quick exit. Besides a
no-look shovel pass by Matthews and a switcheroo by cornerback Champ
Bailey, who lined up at running back for one play and promptly
fumbled, the unit was as colorless as Spurrier's cheeks. Some of the
credit has to go to the Eagle defense, of course, which crumbled in a
season-opening loss to Tennessee and was hell-bent on redemption.</TE>
<TE>   "It was embarrassing, and that's about all you can say," Matthews
said.</TE>
<TE>   The last time a Spurrier offense went without a touchdown in a
game was in 1992, when his Florida Gators were stymied by Mississippi
State. From the way things looked Monday, such blankings could come
often this season.</TE>
<TE>   "When [the Redskins] get hot, they score a lot of points and go on
a roll," Eagle linebacker Shawn Barber said. "But when they don't,
they don't. Tonight, the timing just wasn't there for them."</TE>
<TE>   Matthews completed 10 of 22 passes for 62 yards--his longest pass
play netting 14 yards--and threw one interception. Wuerffel had an
even worse night, rolling up 57 yards on six-of-nine passing with one
interception and four sacks.</TE>
<TE>   "Danny had a lot of pressure in there," Spurrier said of his
Heisman Trophy-winning passer from Florida. "He did some funny things
at times."</TE>
<TE>   Washington's lone touchdown came on a 90-yard punt return by
Jacquez Green in the second quarter. The runback was so fast, the
untouched Green had ample time to pump his fist as he glided across
the goal line. That cut the Eagle lead to 14-7 and had the crowd of
84,982 on its feet. Thousands of those fans were on their feet in the
third quarter too--heading for the exits.</TE>
<TE>   The Eagles showed some mercy. They worked the ball deep into
Washington territory at the end of the game, then ran a half-hearted
play on fourth-and-four at the five, losing a yard but letting the
clock wind down.</TE>
<TE>   "It should have been 40-7," said Spurrier, famous for running up
the score at Florida. "I still don't know why they didn't kick the
field goal."</TE>
<TE>   Which brings us to the next lesson: don't give them any ideas.</TE>

<HD>Panthers Decide Peete Is the Guy</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rodney Peete can stop looking over his shoulder--his best outing in
10 years has officially given him job security as Carolina's starting
quarterback.</LD>
<LD>   Peete had been operating on a week-to-week basis with the
Panthers, needing to do enough on game days to keep Chris Weinke on
the bench and possibly lead Carolina to a few wins.</LD>
<LD>   He has done both--sparking the Panthers to a 2-0 start and giving
Weinke a permanent spot on the sidelines by throwing for 310 yards
and a touchdown in Sunday's 31-7 victory over Detroit.</LD>
<TE>   His passing total was his best since the 36-year-old threw for 323
on Sept. 27, 1992, while with Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   For that, Coach John Fox finally ended the uncertainty when he
confirmed Monday that Peete is the Panther starter.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd say that's fair," Fox said. "When you're named the starter,
it's your job to have or to lose and Rodney has prepared and played
admirably and he's the starting quarterback."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pro Bowl offensive tackle Walter Jones signed a one-year tender
offer for $4.92 million with the Seattle Seahawks.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, in his sixth NFL season, reported to practice Monday. The
contract represents the average salary of the top five players at
that position in the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle designated the 28-year-old Jones as its franchise player
after his contract expired last season. The franchise tag prevented
him from being a free agent and signing with another team.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gary Anderson, the NFL's all-time leading scorer, was close to
rejoining the Minnesota Vikings a day after their stunning overtime
loss to Buffalo in which Doug Brien missed two extra points.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson, 43, was offered a contract Monday, Coach Mike Tice said.
Brien was still with the team, though, and Tice said Brien would
remain on the roster to kick off if an agreement with Anderson was
reached.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dallas Cowboy offensive lineman Larry Allen has a sprained left
ankle and was listed by the team as day-to-day. Allen was injured in
Sunday's 21-13 win over Tennessee when a Titan player rolled over his
leg.... Miami Dolphin cornerback Patrick Surtain, who sat out the
second half of Sunday's win at Indianapolis because of a sore left
knee, underwent an MRI test that showed no tear.... Tight end Jim
Kleinsasser, one of the Vikings' top passing targets, will be out at
least two weeks because of a broken bone in his leg. Defensive tackle
Talance Sawyer will miss two weeks because of a broken bone in his
knee.... Atlanta Falcon guard Roberto Garza broke a bone in his foot
in the team's loss to the Chicago Bears and will miss six weeks....
Detroit offensive lineman Kerlin Blaise will have season-ending knee
surgery this week after being injured in Carolina's victory over the
Lions. Defensive tackle Shaun Rogers broke a thumb and will be
sidelined for the next two games.</TE>

<LD>In an effort to lay the groundwork for an NFL push, representatives
from the L.A. Coliseum will have informal meetings today in Chicago
with architects and financial experts involved with the renovation of
Soldier Field.</LD>
<LD>   "We're serious about returning football to Los Angeles," said City
Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, chair of the Coliseum Commission's NFL
task force. "Our best example currently is Soldier Field. They've
shown considerable insight in protecting and utilizing their assets."</LD>
<LD>   That said, several NFL executives and team owners have said they
have no interest in returning to the Coliseum.</LD>

<HD>Three Veterans Left Off List</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mighty Duck Coach Mike Babcock's plan to break the team into two
groups shocked three veteran players Monday when defenseman Jason
York, left wing German Titov and left wing Denny Lambert found they
were to work out with the minor league Cincinnati group beginning
today.</LD>
<LD>   Also left off the NHL list was highly touted rookie Stanislav
Chistov, the fifth overall pick in the 2001 draft.</LD>
<LD>   "There is going to be movement between the two groups," Babcock
said. "This is not set in stone."</LD>
<TE>   Still it hit like a rock to York, Titov and Lambert, each of whom
spent all of last season with the Ducks. The players learned of their
assignments by reading a list posted after practice Monday, which
included a surprise scrimmage.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just reacting off what I read, but why doesn't he come talk
to me?" Lambert asked.</TE>
<TE>   York is owed $4 million over the next two seasons. Titov has one
year left on a three-year $4.5-million contract. Lambert has a
one-year, $550,000 contract.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks had not been scheduled to scrimmage, but Babcock added
it with the veteran players in mind.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want anyone to think they were blind-sided," Babcock
said. "I want them to feel they had every opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   Babcock expects some movement between the two groups, but York,
Titov and Lambert seem expendable.</TE>
<TE>   York was the Ducks' marquee free-agent signing last summer. He was
supposed to improve scoring from the blue line, but was bothered by a
sore shoulder and finished with five goals and 20 points.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand when a team has the season we had, changes are going
to happen," said York, the only one of the three who spoke with
Babcock after practice. "He told me he picked the eight best
[defensemen]. I realize I have to play a little better. You can look
at this two ways, either you can pout or you can try to be a team
leader."</TE>
<TE>   Titov was brought in to provide scoring on the second line, but
suffered through the deaths of his father and brother and had a
difficult 2000-2001 season. He played well in the second half of last
season and finished with 13 goals and 27 points.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what happened," Titov said. "This really surprised
me. He has not told me anything. Maybe I need to work extra hard."</TE>
<TE>   Of the three, Lambert had the best season a year ago, finishing
with five goals and 213 penalty minutes.</TE>
<TE>   However, his enforcer role with the team is also filled by left
wing Kevin Sawyer.</TE>
<TE>   "I skate hard and I fight," Lambert said. "We have had two
scrimmages and I have had two fights. I don't have to fight in a
scrimmage. My job is to protect Paul [Kariya] and Adam [Oates]. But I
have had two fights because I wanted to show what I can do."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The scrimmage ended in a 3-3 tie, but the winners were defenseman
Mike Commodore and left wing Alexei Smirnov, each of whom were listed
with the NHL group.</TE>
<TE>   Smirnov, a 6-foot-3, 211-pound rookie, was active around the net
and chipped in a goal off a rebound.</TE>
<TE>   He was the Ducks' first-round pick in the 2000 draft.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brad Penny is starting to get better results with less hard work.</LD>
<LD>   Penny, who has stopped throwing in the bullpen between starts,
gave up four hits and a run in six innings as the Florida Marlins
defeated the Atlanta Braves, 5-1, Monday night at Miami to end Kevin
Millwood's eight-game winning streak.</LD>
<LD>   With more rest between outings, Penny said he feels stronger than
he has all season. He hit 98 mph on the radar gun several times.</LD>
<TE>   "It felt really good," Penny said. "That's probably the hardest
I've ever thrown."</TE>
<TE>   Penny (7-6) struck out eight and walked two. He walked Matt Franco
to start the seventh, then gave way to Florida's bullpen.</TE>

<HD>She Truly Knows Meaning of 'For Better or Worse'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T.J. Simers</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>She became "the wife" 30 years ago Monday, in a rush, obviously, to
walk down the aisle and change her last name from Gizzleman to you
know what.</LD>
<LD>   "For better or worse," she said, and how much worse could it get
than Gizzleman?</LD>
<LD>   Her father, Frank, escorted her down the aisle and appeared
reluctant to let her go, apparently not exactly thrilled at the
prospect of his daughter marrying a sportswriter.</LD>
<TE>   Frank is no longer with us, but I imagine he's up there somewhere,
a big smile on his face whenever he thinks about the Grocery Store
Bagger.</TE>
<TE>   Her three brothers--Bubba I, Bubba II and Bubba III--like her
father, were also not happy, but that's because the ceremony lasted
an hour, and they had nothing to eat.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE BRIDE wore white, and I can't say the sportswriter was
pleased. It had been a very long wait, but something Bubba I, Bubba
II and Bubba III had insisted on.</TE>
<TE>   The bride was beautiful--a little short, but still gorgeous. As
the bride remembers it, the groom was "shaking" as she walked down
the aisle, and maybe it was the thought of sharing every Thanksgiving
dinner with Bubba I, Bubba II and Bubba III for the rest of his life.</TE>
<TE>   At the reception, the bride danced and the groom watched, and
across the country USC celebrated with a 51-6 victory over Oregon
State. It would be almost 30 years before anyone thought about
divorce, and it would only be Trojan fans mentioning something about
irreconcilable differences with the sports columnist, who loves them
so.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THIRTY YEARS. Friends have come and gone. Good and bad times have
come and gone. But the wife remains short--and still gorgeous.</TE>
<TE>   There were homes, some of them dream homes, in Coeur d'Alene,
Beloit, Morristown, Memphis and San Diego. There were the French
doors she always wanted, finally bought for a home in Denver. But
those houses, and all the improvements, have been left behind because
the sportswriter would usually be run out of town. I know, hard to
imagine.</TE>
<TE>   She became a mother, the very best in the entire world, and is
best pals now with her two adult daughters, which is right up there
with anything Barry Bonds, Jerry Rice and Wayne Gretzky have
accomplished. Unfortunately, that usually makes it 3-1 in family
votes, which accounts for the Grocery Store Bagger's still being
around.</TE>
<TE>   She has a master's degree, having somehow combined housekeeping,
career and night school to get it, and she isn't the first one to
fall asleep at night.</TE>
<TE>   She became a teacher and a running character in a sports column.
People began to call her a saint, although I have never understood
why.</TE>
<TE>   Charger owner Alex Spanos took a liking to her and made a point of
calling her "the better half," whatever that means. Ryan Leaf felt
sorry for her. Some people refer to her as "Maris," like Niles' wife
on "Frasier," claiming she doesn't exist, but I have the Nordstrom
credit card bills to prove it.</TE>
<TE>   She had a thing for Jimmy Stewart and had her picture taken with
him, and I would imagine that in her version of "It's a Wonderful
Life," an angel provides her with a glimpse of life had she never
been married. I know in my version, Salma Hayek plays the role of the
angel.</TE>
<TE>   She wants to meet Andy Garcia some day. She also wants to clean
out the garage some day. Andy Garcia cleaning out her garage would
probably have her screaming like that woman in the airplane restroom
in the Herbal Essences commercials.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THIRTY YEARS. I wonder if she's expecting a gold watch.</TE>
<TE>   She has taught grammar school much of that time, and as the very
best teacher in the entire world, how many young lives has she
touched? But it's the sportswriter, of course, who gets the attention
and the invite to the Playboy Mansion, and while Hef said I could
bring the wife along, why would I do that?</TE>
<TE>   Now don't get me wrong. I took her to a Super Bowl in 1984 and a
Cub game in 1991. I even got romantic once and took her back to the
same hotel where we spent our wedding night, and even though it had
been converted to some kind of porno palace where folks paid by the
hour, I sprung for all night.</TE>
<TE>   I suppose I could have taught her how to play golf, but why would
I do that?</TE>
<TE>   She has no problem with any of it, of course, because she's my
best friend now, and I allow her to fall asleep at night watching
reruns of "The Golden Girls" when I know darn well "Taxicab
Confessions" is on HBO.</TE>
<TE>   She finds it amusing when women get so angry at a sports column.
"Try living with the bum," I've heard her say, and I remember a time
when she referred to me as "Snuggle Bunny." See if I ever take her to
a Spark game now.</TE>
<TE>   She was right there, though, when each of my parents died, the
compassionate leaning post everyone should have at that time. And of
course there's no decision in life too tough when you have someone
you admire making it with you.</TE>
<TE>   But she's also a Charger fan, loves the Clippers and hockey,
laughs at Tom Lasorda's stories, no matter how many times she has
heard them and has two friends who want me to get Eric Karros'
autograph for them. So we have our problems.</TE>
<TE>   I mentioned in a recent column that she blocked the view of our
big-screen TV, and you can imagine the huge problems we would have if
she didn't have a sense of humor. Or read my columns.</TE>
<TE>   But I'm lucky, and I know it.</TE>

<HD>Real Madrid Looks Like Club to Beat</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JIM BARRERO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Real Madrid is the overwhelming favorite to win its fourth European
Champions Cup title in six seasons and a record 10th overall as play
begins today and Wednesday for the 2002-03 season.</LD>
<LD>   The Spanish club, with an awe-inspiring lineup that includes
Ronaldo, Zinedine Zidane, Luis Figo, Raul and Roberto Carlos, opens
its Champions League season today at AS Roma--the most eye-catching
of the 16 group games across Europe the next two days.</LD>
<LD>   Real, which had an audience with Pope John Paul II on Monday, will
be without the recently acquired Ronaldo for its first game. The
Brazilian striker stayed in Madrid to work on his fitness.</LD>
<TE>   Roma, coming off a 2-1 season-opening loss against Bologna in
Serie A over the weekend, will play without suspended striker Gabriel
Batistuta, captain Francesco Totti and midfielder Francisco Lima.</TE>
<TE>   They are banned for fighting on the field after a game against
Turkish club Galatasaray in March.</TE>
<TE>   Other key games the next two days include Arsenal (England) vs.
Borussia Dortmund (Germany), Valencia (Spain) vs. Liverpool
(England), Feyenoord (Netherlands) vs. Juventus (Italy) and Bayern
Munich (Germany) vs. Deportivo La Coruna (Spain).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   J-League for Ahn</TE>
<TE>   South Korean World Cup star Ahn Jung-hwan will join Japanese club
Shimizu S-Pulse on a one-year transfer, the J-League team announced.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement comes after the popular midfielder was released from
Italian Serie A club Perugia.</TE>
<TE>   Ahn scored the decisive goal in his country's victory against
Italy at this summer's World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, it caught the ire of Perugia President Luciano
Gaucci, who threatened to dismiss Ahn for having scored.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New Qualifying Plan</TE>
<TE>   As expected, South American soccer leaders voted to maintain the
continent's marathon World Cup qualifying competition in which all 10
countries play each other twice, but plan to spread it out over a
longer period.</TE>
<TE>   The system, which requires 18 rounds of matches, was used for the
2002 World Cup and infuriated European clubs because it forced their
South American players to make monthly journeys home.</TE>
<TE>   Eduardo Deluca, the South American confederation's general
secretary, said the plan is to begin qualifying in August 2003 and
end during the second half of 2005. In the past, qualifying took 18
months.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal, which will take the European calendar into
consideration, will be voted on by FIFA next Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Belgian Coach Fired</TE>
<TE>   Robert Waseige, who coached Belgium's national team to the second
round of the World Cup, was fired by his new club Standard Liege
after it lost four of its first five games in the Belgian league.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't understand the ... decision," Waseige told Agence Belga.
"It's too hasty to [fire] me. I knew there were problems with this
team and I was busy sorting them out."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Games in Chile</TE>
<TE>   A players' strike in Chile continues, but the country's league
played games last weekend.</TE>
<TE>   The clubs fielded youth teams and played in mostly empty stadiums.
The game between Deportes Concepcion and Colo Colo was ruled a
forfeit for Colo Colo because Concepcion players arrived 30 minutes
late.</TE>
<TE>   The players are protesting unpaid wages and are angry over changes
in the league's format, including the decision to abolish relegation
the next two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Romario's Reaction</TE>
<TE>   When Romario was left off Brazil's World Cup squad for this
summer's World Cup, he took it as a slap in the face.</TE>
<TE>   Now, he's slapping back.</TE>
<TE>   Over the weekend, the veteran striker let teammate Andrei have it
because of a defensive mistake during a 6-0 loss by Fluminense to Sao
Paolo.</TE>
<TE>   "I lost my cool," Romario said.</TE>
<TE>   But did he apologize?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not one to say sorry," he said. "I've spoken to him and we
are trying to sort things out."</TE>

<HD>Santiago's Jackson Knows the Drill</HD>

<AU>Eric Sondheimer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bernard Jackson, a top senior quarterback at Corona Santiago High,
required more than a little jolt to change his life. He needed a new
parent.</LD>
<LD>   At 12, Jackson was headed for trouble. He lived in a crime-ridden
neighborhood of Venice, where, through the years, four family members
had been shot. He was receiving little supervision or guidance from
his father, Bernard Sr.</LD>
<LD>   "I was always, 'I'm standing over here, I'm going over here, I'll
be back in a week,' " he said.</LD>
<TE>   The one fear he had was a warning that if he messed up, "You're
going to live with your brother, the drill sergeant."</TE>
<TE>   It finally happened when the Department of Children and Social
Services revoked custody from his father and sent him and his younger
sister, Tasia, to stay with their half brother, Brian, a former
Marine, instead of their mother.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a surprise because I thought my dad would do what he had
to do in order to keep them," Brian said.</TE>
<TE>   Bernard Sr. was devastated.</TE>
<TE>   "I cried that night," he said. "I couldn't take it."</TE>
<TE>   Brian was 20 years older than Bernard Jr. and had just finished
his stint with the Marines.</TE>
<TE>   "I had gone from being in the streets, being a wild guy, to
joining the Marines and turning my life around," he said. "Going back
into the neighborhood and seeing my brother and sister on a collision
course with the same lifestyle I had, I was concerned."</TE>
<TE>   Brian was living in a two-bedroom apartment in Lake Forest with
his wife and two young sons. The timing was not right to take in two
soon-to-be teenagers in an already crammed apartment. But he did.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew nothing about them," Brian said. "We didn't know their
habits, what they liked or not. My boys had Marine haircuts, wore
pants with a belt and had their shirts tucked in. Bernard had sagging
pants."</TE>
<TE>   Bernard Jr. suddenly faced rules and regulations never expected of
him.</TE>
<TE>   "He wants to be treated like a man and I told him he has to earn
that, and it starts with simple things, being disciplined, being
responsible, having integrity," Brian said. "Early on, I had to ask
him, 'When are you going to stop lying?' "</TE>
<TE>   Five years later, after Brian moved his family into a house in
Corona, Bernard Jr. is entering his senior year at Santiago. He is a
6-foot-1 quarterback who has received scholarship offers from
Nebraska and Kansas State. He has matured into a trustworthy,
respectful 17-year-old under the strict discipline established by his
brother.</TE>
<TE>   "If it weren't for him, I wouldn't be here," Bernard Jr. said.
"I'd be locked up or dead. I can't thank him enough for allowing me
to become the person I am."</TE>
<TE>   Even Bernard's father now praises the decision to place his son
with Brian.</TE>
<TE>   "It was definitely for the best," he said. "It was like a
godsend."</TE>
<TE>   Bernard Jr. has become a role model for Brian's boys, ages 9 and
12.</TE>
<TE>   "They think the world of Bernard," Brian said. "He's like their
idol. I really think because of the type of person I know Bernard can
be, he's my hero in the making. He's not perfect, but he's a great
kid and is a really good person and a gifted athlete. He made the
transition from being totally free to stepping into a Marine staff
sergeant's household."</TE>
<TE>   Brian still retains tight supervision over Bernard Jr., imposing
curfews, not allowing telephone calls past 9 p.m. on school days and
restricting time for television. But he understands that, in a matter
of months, Bernard will be on his own and having to make his own
decisions.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people think I'm expecting perfection out of him," Brian
said. "I want him to communicate. I want integrity. If you screw up,
let me know. This is something I saw in Bernard as a young kid. I
knew under the right circumstances, he could flourish."</TE>
<TE>   As a quarterback with 4.6 speed in the 40 yards, Bernard passed
for 924 yards and 12 touchdowns, rushed for 551 yards and scored
seven touchdowns last season. He guided Santiago to a 49-0 victory
over Garden Grove Santiago in a season opener last week.</TE>
<TE>   "As soon as I put pads on, it was something I wanted to do every
minute," he said. "It was an inspiration in my life."</TE>
<TE>   Bernard Sr. travels from Inglewood to Corona on Friday nights to
watch Bernard Jr. play football.</TE>
<TE>   Bernard Jr. refuses to criticize his father for failing to fulfill
his parental responsibilities.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to tell you he's a bad person because he's not," he
said. "I love my father to death. He wasn't ready for it."</TE>
<TE>   Enter the Marine-trained brother who provided leadership, love and
guidance.</TE>
<TE>   "My brother has taught me how to become a man," Bernard Jr. said.
"I don't know how to explain it, but it's great."</TE>

<HD>Visions of Colorado a Part of Paus' Past</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If not for Carson Palmer, Cory Paus could be trotting through the
Rose Bowl tunnel for the first time Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   In a Colorado uniform.</LD>
<LD>   Paus became enamored of Colorado while at a quarterback camp there
before his senior year in high school. Two days into the camp, a tall
quarterback from California arrived, and caught the eye of Rick
Neuheisel, then Colorado's coach.</LD>
<TE>   "I was the top dog, then [Palmer] came in and stole my thunder,"
Paus said.</TE>
<TE>   Neuheisel offered Paus a scholarship but said Palmer was his No. 1
choice.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him, 'I appreciate your honesty,' then went to Palmer and
said, 'Hey Cars, what up?' " Paus said.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer told him he was leaning toward Colorado, so Paus turned
down Neuheisel's offer and a few weeks later committed to UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer eventually chose USC, which trounced the Buffaloes last
Saturday, 40-3.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Barnett, who coached at Northwestern before replacing
Neuheisel in 1999, also offered a scholarship to Paus, who went to
high school near Chicago. But the Northwestern offer came too late
for Paus, who was already packed for Westwood.</TE>
<TE>   "We had trouble getting film on him, if I remember correctly,"
Barnett said. "When he was a junior, I thought he was skinny, but he
came on his senior year. By the time we made an offer, he was set on
UCLA."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Colorado quarterback Craig Ochs will not play for the second game
in a row because of a concussion, leaving senior Robert Hodge to try
to improve on his one-for-nine passing performance against USC.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no way [Ochs] plays, so we are back to Square 1,"
Barnett said. "That was Robert Hodge's first game, except for the
second half against San Diego State.</TE>
<TE>   "We certainly think there is nowhere to go but up."</TE>
<TE>   And there is no real alternative to Hodges, a senior from
Manhattan Beach Mira Costa High and El Camino College. Senior Zac
Colvin is a career backup and freshman Joel Klatt is a walk-on.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing that was appealing about Robert was his athleticism,"
Barnett said. "The players seem to have confidence in him. But it's
hard to predict how he'll perform."</TE>

<TE>   Coach Bob Toledo said 6-foot-3 free safety Matt Ware will play
cornerback against tall receivers. Ware was a freshman All-American
cornerback last season.</TE>
<TE>   "We are excited about [safeties] Jarrad Page and Ben Emanuel,"
Toledo said. "And Jibril Raymo will start to see more action. That
affords us the opportunity to go to more nickel and dime packages and
to use Matt at corner."</TE>
<TE>   Ware might even have played quarterback against Oklahoma State,
but he was sidelined after spraining his right ankle on the first
play of the second half.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to get him in on offense," Toledo said.</TE>
<TE>   In brief stints at quarterback last season, Ware rushed for 22
yards in four carries.</TE>

<TE>   Ricky Manning's arraignment today in Los Angeles Superior Court on
felony assault charges is expected to be postponed because
co-defendant Tremaine Mitchell may change public defenders.</TE>
<TE>   Manning is expected to plead not guilty.</TE>

<TE>   The Bruins, who were injury-free during fall camp, made it through
another week virtually unscathed. Besides Ware, the only starter
listed as questionable is defensive tackle Steve Morgan, who has a
sprained knee.</TE>
<TE>   Three reserves who have yet to play in a game are in varying
degrees of recovery. Fullback Pat Norton (ankle) is probable,
linebacker Patrick Pierre-Louis (shoulder) is questionable and tight
end Keith Carter (ankle) remains out.</TE>

<LD>Something will have to give when 11th-ranked USC plays at No. 25
Kansas State on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The Trojans lead the nation in total defense, yielding an average
of 171 yards a game after victories over Auburn and Colorado. Kansas
State, benefiting from a soft schedule, leads the nation in scoring,
averaging 59.7 points through three games.</LD>
<LD>   "They've got a great offense, so we've got a lot to prepare for,"
said USC defensive tackle Shaun Cody. "We're excited. We want to play
a 3-0 team that scores a lot of points. We thrive on stuff like
that."</LD>
<TE>   Since the second half of the opener against Auburn, USC's defense
has been nearly impenetrable. The Trojans have allowed only 96 yards
in the last six quarters, including 61 in a 40-3 victory over
Colorado on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Pete Carroll said the defense adopted a more basic scheme
after missing several tackles in the first half against Auburn on
Sept. 2.</TE>
<TE>   "We've really eliminated mistakes and breakout plays because of
that," Carroll said. "Early in the Auburn game we looked kind of
shabby. We went back to a more basic approach to make sure we did
things right, and it's obviously been a better approach."</TE>
<TE>   Said Cody: "Coach Carroll has us moving around a lot. We've got a
lot of speed on defense, so he has us flying around everywhere."</TE>
<TE>   As usual, strong safety Troy Polamalu was among the more
disruptive Trojans against Colorado, recording a team-high 11
tackles. He said he has played more aggressively against the run
because USC has yet to face an effective passing attack.</TE>
<TE>   "As a secondary, we have yet to be challenged," said Polamalu, who
was named Pacific 10 Conference defensive player of the week. "I
think Kansas State is going to test us. We're looking forward to the
challenge."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kansas State's "preseason," as some in the media have called it,
ended Saturday with a 63-13 victory over Eastern Illinois, a Division
I-AA school. The Wildcats' other victories were over I-AA Western
Kentucky, 48-3, and Louisiana-Monroe, 68-0. All three games were at
Manhattan, Kan.</TE>
<TE>   Nonconference schedules don't get any softer than that, but
Carroll said he has a "different level of respect" for the Wildcats
because they defeated the Trojans, 10-6, last season at the Coliseum,
rushing for 340 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday will mark the first time Kansas State has faced a ranked
non-conference opponent since losing at Washington, 56-3, in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   "They are very physical and tough to go against," Carroll said. "I
didn't know what to expect as much from Colorado or Auburn, but
[Kansas] State I do, and so I hold them in higher regard."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC tailback Justin Fargas, who got his first and only carry of
the season against Colorado, has recovered from a strained hamstring
and will play a bigger role this week, Carroll said.... Zach Wilson
practiced with the first team at right guard Monday and could start
against Kansas State, Carroll said. Wilson, a senior, has been
bothered by a strained foot and played late in the game against
Colorado.</TE>
