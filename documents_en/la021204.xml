<HD>Valves vs. cams? For GM, it's no contest</HD>
<DH>The automaker cites cost, power and quality advantages in
choosing overhead-valve design for future engines.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rick Popely</AU>
<BD>Chicago Tribune</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>General Motors Corp. sees a future for engines with overhead valves,
a technology most automakers have abandoned in favor of overhead
camshafts.</LD>
<LD>   GM will introduce a family of overhead-valve V-6 engines beginning
with a 3.5-liter in the 2004 Chevrolet Malibu and plans to keep other
OHV engines in its fleet for years.</LD>
<LD>   Few foreign manufacturers offer OHV car or light-truck engines in
the U.S., and Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Group have reduced their
OHV offerings in favor of overhead-cam designs.</LD>
<TE>   OHV engines have a single camshaft in the engine block that
operates pushrods that open and close the valves. With OHC engines,
camshafts are mounted in the cylinder heads, closer to the valves,
where they can open and close the valves faster and allow the engine
to operate at higher speeds.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the competition's plans, overhead-valve technology will
account for the majority of GM's future engines, said Ned McClurg,
vice president of engineering for GM Powertrain.</TE>
<TE>   "We're making major investments in them. A case can be made that
overhead-valve engines produce more power per mass and more power per
physical space," McClurg said.</TE>
<TE>   OHV engines are widely considered low-tech compared with
overhead-cam engines and incapable of meeting the more stringent
emissions requirements facing automakers. McClurg disputes such
claims.</TE>
<TE>   "We are doing just fine with overhead-valve engines, whether
you're looking at quality, performance, fuel economy or customer
satisfaction," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I know we're arguing against the tide, but we're going to
surprise the industry with innovation," he said. "We're not going to
give away anything on noise, emissions, quality or reliability."</TE>
<TE>   Art Spinella, general manager of CNW Marketing/Research, a Bandon,
Ore., firm that studies consumer buying decisions for the auto
industry, says most customers couldn't care less what is under the
hood.</TE>
<TE>   "The vast majority, and I mean 85% or more, don't care. There's a
certain percentage who do, but they already drive European or
Japanese vehicles," Spinella said. "As long as it starts ... it
doesn't matter if it's overhead valve, overhead cam, hybrid or a fuel
cell. They don't care if there are hamsters under the hood as long as
it gets them to the office."</TE>
<TE>   In the 1980s, overhead-valve engines couldn't match the
performance or fuel economy of overhead-cam engines, Spinella said,
"but today the engine configuration or design really is not an
issue."</TE>
<TE>   GM says cost is a major factor favoring OHV engines because they
have fewer parts and are cheaper to manufacture than OHC engines,
most of which have two camshafts per cylinder head and four valves
per cylinder (instead of two on the OHV).</TE>
<TE>   "When you have four camshafts instead of one, the difference is
pretty straightforward," McClurg said regarding cost. GM estimates
that its OHV truck V-8s cost $700 to $800 less to produce than the
OHC V-8s of archrival Ford.</TE>
<TE>   GM's V-8s have more horsepower, the power used to sustain speed,
but Ford's have greater torque, the power needed to move the
vehicle's mass to achieve speed. OHV engines also tend to be more
compact than overhead-cam engines, making them easier to fit into a
variety of vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   In fuel economy, Environmental Protection Agency says GM's 4.8-
and 5.3-liter overhead-valve V-8 engines tie Ford's 4.6- and
5.4-liter overhead-cam V-8s. In combined city and highway driving,
the smaller engines are rated at 17 miles per gallon and the larger
versions at 16.</TE>
<TE>   Spinella says, though, that in practice he has found GM's engines
to be more fuel-efficient than Ford's. CNW maintains a fleet of
vehicles for use in consumer research clinics, and Spinella says the
V-8s in GM's full-size sport utility vehicles "get much better
real-world mileage" than the V-6 in the mid-size Ford Explorer.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Szczupak, Ford's vice president of powertrain operations,
argues that his company's overhead-cam engines are smoother, quieter
and more efficient without a cost penalty.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't believe there's a financial disadvantage to our
engines," Szczupak said, adding that any additional cost from the
greater complexity of overhead-cam designs is offset by other
production efficiencies.</TE>
<TE>   Ford builds overhead-cam V-8s for trucks and cars and a V-10 truck
engine from the same design -- a total of 1.3 million engines a year.
Ford also is adopting a flexible manufacturing system it says will
allow it to revise future engine production at lower cost.</TE>
<TE>   "With the manufacturing efficiencies we will realize, we will
produce our engines at very similar cost" to those of GM, Szczupak
said.</TE>

<HD>A dash of American and a touch of Swede give this Saab
story a happy ending</HD>
<DH>With the 9-3 sedan, the automaker has traded its quirks for
broader appeal. As it turns out, this is not a bad thing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John O'Dell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Saab is remaking itself and in so doing loses the quirkiness that has
attracted some Americans to the Swedish automaker. But as shown by
the new 9-3 sedan -- first of the remade Saabs -- that's not a bad
thing.</LD>
<LD>   Gone, for now, is the five-door hatchback and the elongated rear
end that made Saabs Saabs for so many years.</LD>
<LD>   For 2003, the 9-3 is a sleeker car. It still looks like a Saab
from the front with its three-piece grille and creased V-shaped hood.
But from the side and rear it looks pretty much like the standard
European sports sedan, with a hint of BMW.</LD>
<TE>   There is reason for this. Saab's owner, General Motors Corp.,
figures that the Swedish car maker is going to have to lose its
quirkiness and start appealing to a broader audience if it hopes to
reverse its recent money-losing ways. The new look is intended to do
so.</TE>
<TE>   GM held a 50% stake in Saab for years but has exercised options
and bought the other half: Saab is now a 100% subsidiary and gets to
share in those economies of scale and benefits of bigness that
management school professors and corporate chieftains are always
touting.</TE>
<TE>   So the 9-3 becomes the first Saab to use GM's global small-car
platform, dubbed Epsilon. It debuted last year, underpinning the Opel
Vectra in Europe, and bows onto the North American scene under the
9-3 for the 2003 model year. In 2004 the Epsilon will be the base
from which the Chevrolet Malibu and Pontiac Grand Am will rise (as
will a redesigned Saturn L-Series after that).</TE>
<TE>   But in each application, GM insists, the vehicles will be
individually tuned for their specific market. The 9-3 isn't an Opel
Vectra, and the Malibu won't be a 9-3.</TE>
<TE>   I haven't had any seat time in the European-market Vectra but can
attest after a week with the 9-3 in my normal Southern California
commuter mode, as well as a day of putting it through its paces on
the twisty wine country roads north of San Francisco, that GM could
do far worse than clone Chevys, Pontiacs and Saturns from it.</TE>
<TE>   Purists can quibble over its looks, but in terms of package and
performance, the new 9-3 is one of the neatest Saabs ever.</TE>
<TE>   The new platform gives the sedan appreciably more rigidity than
its predecessor, and that translates to a solid body and a suspension
that make the 9-3 an impressive road car, with handling that puts it
at or near the top of the class.</TE>
<TE>   Though the 9-3 shares the same basic architecture as the other
Epsilon platform vehicles, most of the suspension, steer- ing and
engine components are unique to the brand.</TE>
<TE>   The 9-3 rides on independent front and rear suspensions, each tied
together with anti-sway bars, and the steering rack has been
relocated to the front suspension -- it had been on the firewall in
previous models -- to improve responsiveness. The improved suspension
and relocated steering also eliminate the torque steer, or strong
sideways pull from the front drive wheel during acceleration, that
has plagued Saab models for years.</TE>
<TE>   The engine is a new all- aluminum 2.0-liter four-banger equipped,
as are all Saabs, with a turbocharger that boosts both horsepower and
torque. The base version with a low-boost turbo is rated at 175
horsepower and 195 foot-pounds of torque, and the high-boost model
pumps that up to 210 ponies and 221 foot-pounds. Neither engine
suffers from turbo lag, so the accelerative power of the torque is
present as soon as the pedal is mashed to the floor.</TE>
<TE>   The 9-3 comes in three versions: the base Linear model, the
upscale Arc and the performance-oriented Vector. (And with model
names like that, I guess it could be argued that Saab still has at
least one quirky feature.)</TE>
<TE>   Saab launched the line with the Linear in late October and says
the Arc and Vector models will be available in the U.S. early next
year.</TE>
<TE>   Base price for the Linear is $25,900, about $2,000 less than the
outgoing 2002 9-3 hatchback. The Arc starts at $29,995 and the Vector
at $32,495.</TE>
<TE>   All can be had with a five-speed automatic transmission, with
Saab's manual shift option, but the Linear comes standard with a
five-speed manual and a new six-speed manual is standard in the
210-horsepower Arc and Vector models. Vectors with automatic trannies
also offer racing-style fingertip shifter paddles on the steering
wheel as a factory option.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the car is comfortable for commuting and a kick on the
open road, perhaps the best-handling, best-balanced car Saab has
built.</TE>
<TE>   I did find the automatic to be a bit sluggish on the upshifts,
especially in the lower-horsepower Linear, but if the primary use of
the car will be to sit out long Southern California freeway commutes,
that should not be a bother to most.</TE>
<TE>   Four-wheel anti-lock brakes provide plenty of stopping power, and
computer-controlled brake force distribution and cornering control
are available with various trim packages.</TE>
<TE>   On the safety front, the 9-3 is packed with dual-stage front
airbags, seat-mounted side airbags, side curtain airbags and Saab's
whiplash- reducing head restraint system on the front seats -- all
standard in all models. Because this is now a GM car, 9-3s also come
standard with the OnStar integrated wireless communications system.</TE>
<TE>   Other neat features:</TE>
<TE>   * No door locks except a hidden, emergency lock on the driver's
side -- Saab decided everyone uses remote key fobs now, so why bother
with the clunky looks of an external lock.</TE>
<TE>   * An emergency brake handle that is sculpted and mounted to look
like a piece of the center console.</TE>
<TE>   * A fiber-optic electric system that eliminates 45 pounds and
2,500 linear feet of electrical wiring by letting a single fiber
carry the power for numerous lights, switches and gauges.</TE>
<TE>   * A nifty trunk-mounted release for the 60/40-split back seats, so
there's no need to run around and open the back door, lean in and
fold the seats when you decide the 14.8- cubic-foot trunk isn't quite
spacious enough for the Oriental rug or the length of 2-by-4 you are
trying to stuff in.</TE>
<TE>   * A huge glove box.</TE>
<TE>   * Three years of free scheduled maintenance.</TE>
<TE>   The new 9-3 is the same length as the previous model but is 2.1
inches wider, stands almost three-quarters of an inch taller and has
a wheelbase that is 2.8 inches longer. Added up, that gives the new
model a roomier interior and a more BMW-like "wheels to the corners"
stance.</TE>
<TE>   The base model rides on 15-inch wheels, with 16-inch alloys
optional; the Arc comes standard with 16-inchers, and the Vector
rolls on 17-inch wheels. There's wood trim inside the Arc because
even in Sweden they are convinced that wood means luxury; both the
Arc and Vector get leather upholstery, and the Linear gets
leather-trimmed cloth.</TE>
<TE>   And, yes, even though Saab eliminated door locks and torque steer,
it kept its center-console-mounted ignition switch. One welcome
change, though, is the elimination of the lockout mechanism that
required you to put the transmission into reverse to remove the key
from the switch.</TE>
<TE>   The Saab's seats are very comfortable up front and comfortable in
the rear, and there's sufficient headroom for all but the tallest
drivers and passengers. The instrument panel and other gauges and
controls are laid out to be quite visible and driver-friendly.</TE>
<TE>   Final words: You no longer have to wear Birkenstocks and keep a
bottle of aquavit in your freezer to be comfortable putting a Saab on
your list. If Saab's price range matches yours, the new 9-3 is well
worth looking at.</TE>

<LD>Searching for a gift to indulge your favorite car connoisseur this
holiday? Here's one that would knock the socks off of any gear head.</LD>
<LD>   For $2,800 a day, you could rent an exotic Lamborghini Diablo for
your special car fanatic. Or $1,800 a day could put her behind the
wheel of a Ferrari.</LD>
<LD>   Driving a rare sports car is a fantasy for many. To fulfill those
dreams, a handful of rental agencies in Southern California
specialize in stocking fleets of high-end exotic and luxury vehicles.</LD>
<TE>   Among them is Beverly Hills Rent-a-Car, a chain with more than 300
exotic cars for rent at its offices at Los Angeles International
Airport, Santa Monica, Newport Beach and Palm Springs. Budget Rental
Car of Beverly Hills, which has six locations, also is a big player
with 1,200 to 1,400 vehicles in its fleet.</TE>
<TE>   Rental fees for these cars start at about $100. A Mini Cooper,
BMW's updated version of the classic British car, rents for $99.99 a
day at Budget, while a 2002 Mercedes C240, a four-door sedan, costs
about $125. And $599 will get you one day behind the wheel of a
Porsche 996 CVT. At Beverly Hills Rent-a-Car, a Bentley Azure
Convertible rents for $2,800 a day, or $19,000 a week.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in the business of offering the public the chance to rent
the hottest cars available," said Ken Kerzner, president of Budget
Rental Car of Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Given that the purchase price of some of these cars can match the
cost of a new home, not only is renting one of these cars expensive,
but there also are restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   For example, some dealers won't rent exotic cars to anyone under
the age of 25, and clients must have their own insurance coverage for
some of the higher-end vehicles. Rental agencies generally will
require a credit card with a large line of credit and will
independently verify insurance information before handing over the
keys. Some car rental firms will prohibit renters from driving out of
state or from taking vehicles off-road -- even those SUVs
specifically designed for rugged driving.</TE>
<TE>   At Beverly Hills Rent-a-Car, customers must have their own
insurance coverage. To rent a 2002 Ferrari 360 Modena, they're
required to have a minimum $10,000 line of credit on a credit card,
according to Marilyn Hemenway , claims manager.</TE>
<TE>   Insurance and credit card information is verified by the firm. But
there are clients who try to falsify information on their rental
contracts. They often are parents trying to fulfill their teenagers'
dreams of piloting a fast and flashy car.</TE>
<TE>   "We cringe around prom time," Hemenway said. "The saddest thing I
see happen is when parents rent these vehicles under their own name,
and then turn around and hand their teenagers the keys."</TE>
<TE>   She recalled the time a father rented an Audi TT sports car from
the firm and allowed his son to drive the vehicle in violation of the
contract. The teenager totaled the Audi while racing another car at
high speeds along a Southland freeway, Hemenway said.</TE>
<TE>   And then there is the issue of whether you can really handle a
true sports car. A Ferrari 360 Modena can go from zero to 60 mph in
about four seconds.</TE>
<TE>   "If we've never done business with you," Kerzner said, "we have to
be secure that you know how to drive a Ferrari and you will be safe
in it. A Ferrari is a very powerful machine, and if we both agree you
don't feel safe in the car, we aren't going to rent it to you."</TE>
<TE>   Rod Gruendyke, general manager of the Sunset Marquis Hotel &amp;
Villas in West Hollywood, said most of his guests are in the
entertainment industry or are wealthy tourists, and many of them want
exotic vehicles at their disposal. When Aerosmith band members
checked in at the hotel recently, he said, they rented Corvettes and
Mercedes at Budget's West Hollywood location.</TE>
<TE>   Gruendyke said he once rented a Ferrari and was uncomfortable with
the reaction he got on the road.</TE>
<TE>   "Ferraris are like a magnet. Heads turn and you get lots of stares
from people trying to figure out who you might be," he said. "It
embarrassed me."</TE>
<TE>   Granted, the demand for elite vehicles is small compared with that
for a Ford Taurus or a Pontiac Grand Am.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the car culture in America is seductive, and the
lure of driving a flashy and expensive vehicle -- even for one day --
is powerful enough to entice celebrities, chief executives and even
middle-class car fanciers.</TE>
<TE>   Beverly Hills Rent-a-Car's clients range from movie stars and
rappers to royalty. Actor Tom Hanks rented a Lamborghini for a few
days for his wife Rita Wilson's birthday, said Gordon L. Downing,
vice president of sales.</TE>
<TE>   Downing said he also sees the occasional less affluent customer
who rents a Cadillac Escalade sport utility vehicle for $249 a day
for a wedding or a moderately priced Mercedes Benz for $125 a day to
impress a date.</TE>
<TE>   Even some mainstream car rental firms offer luxury cars. At some
Enterprise Rent-a-Car offices, customers can rent BMWs, Corvettes,
Porsche Boxsters, Hummers and high-end SUVs for $110 to $300 a day.</TE>
<TE>   "Our customers tell us they want the thrill of driving something
out of the ordinary," said Brett Bittel, senior vice president of
Enterprise Rent-a-Car of Southern California.</TE>

<LD>The fruit in this terrific Tuscan red jumps right out of the glass,
carrying with it scents of dried rose petals, cherries and tobacco.
Though Carmignano is just 10 miles northwest of Florence, the wine
made here has an earthier, darker tone than the wines from the
Chianti region. That's because there's always a little Cabernet
Sauvignon in the blend; Carmignano was doing this decades before
Supertuscans like Tignanello and Sassacaia.</LD>
<LD>   What I love about this Carmignano is its firm structure and silky
Pinot-like texture. It may be the best Villa de Capezzano has ever
made.</LD>
<LD>   The tone is autumnal, perfect for this time of year. Have it with
a warming bowl of pasta e fagioli garnished with a thread of
green-gold Tuscan olive oil. It's a wonderful match with a chicken
liver ragu for pasta, or chicken liver crostini, as well as roast
chicken and meats.</LD>

<HD>A celebrity in the kitchen</HD>
<DH>Top-tier chefs are moving in to catering, and you might be
surprised to see who's doing your cooking.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Valli Herman-Cohen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>FASTER than you can say, "Do you deliver?" catered dinner parties
have become a phenomenon in Los Angeles. That great Greek deli down
the hill or the local restaurant on the corner can often do wonders
-- and leave you, gracious host, free to party on hassle-free. But
hard times in the restaurant business have forced a twist that would
have been astonishing just a few years ago.</LD>
<LD>   If you can afford it, some of the biggest culinary stars in the
city will cook for you. Personally. Right now the roster of
chefs-for-hire includes Tim Goodell of Aubergine, Josie Le Balch of
Josie's, Celestino Drago of Drago's, Joe Miller of Joe's, Makoto
Tanaka of Mako, Jean Francois Meteigner of La Cachette, Bill Bracken
of Belvedere and Michael's chefs du cuisine, Christine Banta or
Olivier Rousselle.</LD>
<LD>   The high caliber of the chefs willing to cater small parties --
and, in some cases, the relatively low rates they are charging --
represents an enormous change in attitude. Once catering was beneath
them. Now it's often a matter of survival.</LD>
<TE>   In recent weeks, two of L.A.'s most promising young chefs left the
restaurant business entirely to begin catering. Brooke Williamson,
ready to strike out on her own, left Zax in Brentwood to start
Company for Dinner. And Ben Ford shuttered Chadwick in Beverly Hills
for lack of business and began Chadwick Catering. With new jobs
scarce or unappealing, these chefs are building new careers cooking
for charity dinners, private parties and even intimate cocktail
gatherings.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, those in the restaurant business see their tables
sitting empty and start looking for other sources of income. From her
Santa Monica restaurant, Josie's chef Le Balch will prepare a
complete dinner, or part of it, via her new Take Josie Home party
pickup menu. Her salmon and leek or wild mushroom quiches sell for
$27 a pie, and a party's worth of hors d'oeuvres go for $24 to $34 a
dozen. La Cachette's Meteigner is selling bottles of dressings and
emulsions and has created take-out picnic baskets filled with
appetizers, entrees and desserts that he'll deliver. In Tustin, Zov's
chef Zov Karamardian has developed a $395 takeout holiday dinner that
will serve a multicourse menu for 12.</TE>
<TE>   In many cases, even if a restaurant doesn't have a takeout menu,
catering department or banquet facility, they're still eager to cook
for private parties.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people don't know that if you call a fine-dining
restaurant that doesn't happen to list a to-go menu, you can still
get the menu to go," said Jannis Swerman, director of communications
for Wolfgang Puck. (Incidentally, Swerman said, Puck will appear at
private parties his company is catering, "if he is available.")</TE>
<TE>   With little advance notice, many can prepare additional portions
of their regular menu items, pack them in portable containers, and
even throw in a few chafing dishes.</TE>
<TE>   Only a few, such as Joe's in Venice, are so strict about quality
that they won't sell food that will be cooked and eaten without the
restaurant's direct oversight.</TE>
<TE>   Personal service</TE>
<TE>   Neighborhood spots, such as Marouch on the outskirts of Hollywood,
has been catering its Lebanese specialties for nearly 20 years, said
owner Serge Brady, who provides a lot of personal service. On Sunday,
he helped Simon Kahn and Rene Lapointe load their vegetarian wedding
feast into their car -- 20 minutes before their ceremony at the
nearby Self Realization Fellowship Hollywood Temple. Another couple
from the church suggested the restaurant, which is so nearby the food
stays warm in transit.</TE>
<TE>   Across town at Taix, Echo Park's French food institution offers
several banquet menus for pickup, said catering manager Retta
Etchegaray. For a minimum of 25 people at $15.95 per person starting
price, Taix chef Loic Besnou can turn out luncheon salads, a la carte
dinners or complete lunch or dinner buffets featuring French
specialties. For simpler celebrations, the restaurant offers
appetizer trays of smoked salmon, chicken liver mousse or even mini
beef Wellingtons.</TE>
<TE>   Though Pink's on Melrose owners Richard and Gloria Pink don't
advertise their catering services, they will set up their steam
tables for a minimum order of 500 hot dogs.</TE>
<TE>   Though restaurants provide many of the same special-event services
as caterers, often for a comparable cost, restaurant catering offers
the advantage of familiarity.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are poking around for a caterer and you don't use one that
often, it's really easy to go to the restaurant and try the food,"
Swerman said. "Almost any restaurant you go to, even if it's a little
brassiere in your neighborhood or a fine-dining establishment, could
be available for catering."</TE>
<TE>   While dining at his favorite neighborhood restaurant, Ristorante
Rumari, Laguna Beach interior designer John Wooden thought to hire
the chef for his annual pre-Thanksgiving family get-together.</TE>
<TE>   "We've used caterers in the past," Wooden said. "We were eating at
Rumari a couple of weeks ago and we thought it would be more
interesting." He selected some menu favorites and developed other
dishes with chef Vince Crivello. For $160 per person, which Wooden
said was about the same price as a caterer, he and his friends were
served wine and a five-course meal, including tuna tartare,
pappardelle in cream sauce, sauteed shrimp and salmon, and bananas
flambe with a brandy butter orange sauce.</TE>
<TE>   "It was worth the money because we didn't have to think about
keeping the wine glasses full," Wooden said. "It was like being in a
restaurant."</TE>
<TE>   Though chefs have long offered their in-home catering services for
privileged clients or donated them for charity auctions,
restaurant-based chefs have more incentive to expand their catering
business.</TE>
<TE>   "Catering is known, especially if you have the facility to order
large amounts of food, as pure income," said Williamson, who
occasionally was hired out at $300 to $400 a night from Zax to cook
for regular customers. "You don't have to pay the busboy and a server
because the client is paying for all of it," she said. "Generally,
you make the same thing for everybody, so you have no waste. You can
completely anticipate your costs."</TE>
<TE>   Now that she's running Company for Dinner, her catering company
with her partner and former Zax sous chef, Nick Roberts, Williamson
doesn't charge extra for an appearance.</TE>
<TE>   Other top L.A. chefs do, though. For $500, you can hire either Joe
Miller of Joe's or Tim Goodell of Aubergine and Whist. For an extra
$150, Makoto Tanaka of Mako will appear at your dinner party.</TE>
<TE>   Michael's charges a flat $50-an-hour rate for Christine Banta or
Olivier Rousselle. Like personal trainers and personal shoppers,
individual attention doesn't come cheap.</TE>
<TE>   Hiring anyone to cook and serve in your home is still more
expensive than eating the same food in a restaurant. The cost of prep
cooks, waiters, chef assistants, customized menus and rentals can
make an in-home meal 10% to 50% more expensive.</TE>
<TE>   An elegant, chef-prepped four- or five-course meal of say,
appetizers, soup or salad, grilled meat and dessert, may cost from
$65 and up just for food. Once the service charges for labor and wait
staff are added, top-quality meals catered in the home often cost
$100 per person and up, not counting wine or liquor.</TE>
<TE>   Hosts of in-home parties can save money by providing their own
wine. However, don't think you're getting out of a tip. Most
restaurants substitute a 15% to 18% service fee to cover the staff's
labor and lost tips. Typically, one waiter, at $125 to $150 an hour,
is adequate for a party of four to 10 people. And yes, that's a lot
of chopped liver.</TE>
<TE>   Bringing a restaurant experience to a home brings a measure of
certainty and, when done well, cachet to a home dinner party.</TE>
<TE>   If the chef is coming to your kitchen, however, don't worry if you
don't have a proper eight-burner stove, double oven and spacious
refrigerator. Most restaurants, whether they have a special events
staff or not, will assess your kitchen's capabilities beforehand,
said Patricia Seifert, general manager of Mako in Beverly Hills.
Depending on the menu, she can rent a stove, a wok, add a barbeque
grill or set up a temporary kitchen in your garage.</TE>
<TE>   The at-home dinner party trend is growing in popularity, said Carl
Schuster, president of Wolfgang Puck Catering and Events. "About a
quarter of our business in L.A. is in the form of small, in-home
parties."</TE>
<TE>   The at-home party trend has grown along with the size of
residential kitchens.</TE>
<TE>   "People have these amazing kitchens with the best quality stoves
and china and they don't cook," said Williamson.</TE>
<TE>   No matter the size -- or status -- of the party, most generate a
precious form of advertising -- word-of-mouth referrals.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a way to get people interested in your restaurant," said
Drago.</TE>
<TE>   Culinary extravaganzas</TE>
<TE>   Judi Kaufman, a professional recipe tester and home economist,
recently hired Meteigner to cook a multicourse meal for four at her
Beverly Hills home. "The idea of ordering in -- in the most elegant
way -- means that you don't have to worry about impressing your
guests about the work that you do," she said. "And that means you can
concentrate on conversation."</TE>
<TE>   "And there's something kind of romantic about having a chef at
your house," Kaufman said. "It's like a celebrity is in your house."</TE>
<TE>   It's true, celebrity chefs can turn evenings into culinary
extravaganzas, where guests learn about the special ingredients and
preparation of the meal. For instance, Drago recently created a
five-course, $550-per-person, white-truffle dinner for a client who
wanted to pair the food with wines from the Piedmont region of Italy.</TE>
<TE>   "I do a presentation about the truffle -- how to shave it, cook
it, clean it," he said. "It's like a little cooking class."</TE>
<TE>   And, this being L.A., a little conspicuous consumption can go a
long way.</TE>

<LD>Most people traveling to foreign cities fall in love with something
like a museum, a restaurant, a local resident who sweeps them
unsuspectingly off their feet.</LD>
<LD>   I fell in love with a cookie.</LD>
<LD>   It was a few months ago in Vancouver, British Columbia, when clear
blue skies had not yet given in to fall's gray weather, and colorful
leaves fluttered onto the sidewalks and streets of this charming
city. I ducked into the Senses Bakery near a bustling corner, a
small, sleek spot with a glass case neatly filled with sweets. There
it sat with others piled primly on the shelf.</LD>
<TE>   It was chocolate, slightly crackled, not perfectly round by any
means. One nibble, and I was smitten. Its dark, sensual chocolate
taste was powerful, its texture addictive: chewy, almost
truffle-like, mysterious. I promptly ate three. I packed a box to
bring home.</TE>
<TE>   It is called the chocolate sparkle cookie, and while it doesn't
glimmer from its case, those who taste it know why. It is the most
popular cookie at this 4-year-old bakery, so popular that when it was
pulled to make space for holiday cookies, customers complained. It is
now back under the lights, says executive pastry chef Thomas Haas,
who created it.</TE>
<TE>   "It is super-popular," he says of the flourless cookie, made with
ground almonds, rich dark chocolate and butter.</TE>
<TE>   When I brought mine back, they disappeared quickly. We begged for
the recipe and -- surprise -- they're one of the easiest things we've
made all year. (Just in time for the holidays.)</TE>
<TE>   Haas, a fourth-generation pastry chef from Germany's Black Forest
region, came up with it while planning sweets for the bakery's
shelves. He wanted it to be like a chocolate truffle.</TE>
<TE>   "When you work day and night, and you have the tools, ingredients,
and toys we have, things come together," he says. Yet inspiration
might come too from a chestnut tree outside the shop; the bakery now
sells a chestnut cookie.</TE>
<TE>   Before coming to Senses, part of a restaurant company based in
Toronto, Haas worked as pastry chef at Daniel in New York and the
Four Seasons Hotel in Vancouver. His other sweets are delectable,
including pristine truffles, dainty cinnamon rolls and tiny petits
fours. But the chocolate sparkle cookies are what you remember.</TE>
<TE>   Even Haas can't put his finger on the cookie's appeal. "It's just
so soft and rich inside," he says.</TE>
<TE>   But that's how love is -- you can't explain it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chocolate sparkle cookies</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 1 hour, plus 8 hours chilling</TE>
<TE>   Servings: About 36 cookies</TE>
<TE>   1/2 pound semisweet chocolate</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons butter, room temperature</TE>
<TE>   2 eggs</TE>
<TE>   1/3 cup sugar, plus more for rolling</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup ground almonds</TE>
<TE>   Powdered sugar, for garnish</TE>
<TE>   1. Melt the chocolate in the top of a double boiler set over, but
not touching, simmering water. Remove from the heat. Cut the butter
into a few pieces and mix into the chocolate until melted.</TE>
<TE>   2. Beat the eggs with an electric mixer, gradually adding the
sugar until ribbons form. Fold in the chocolate-butter mixture.
Gently add the ground almonds. Cover and refrigerate overnight.</TE>
<TE>   3. Heat the oven to 325 degrees. Line a baking sheet with
parchment paper.</TE>
<TE>   4. Use a cookie scoop to form the dough into 1-inch balls. Roll
the balls in granulated sugar, place on the baking sheet about 2
inches apart and immediately place in the oven.</TE>
<TE>   5. Bake until the center of the cookies is no longer wet, 9 to 12
minutes. When slightly cool, lightly dust the cookies with powdered
sugar.</TE>

<KH>COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: MEXICO</KH>
<HD>Going way beyond the enchilada</HD>
<DH>Casa Antigua Cantina mixes Old World sophistication with
exotic specialties.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Barbara Hansen</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>CASA Antigua Cantina is so elegantly Mexican that when you leave, you
expect to step outside into the buzz of Mexico City -- certainly not
into a cluttered business strip along Wilshire Boulevard.</LD>
<LD>   At the far end of the dining room, a fountain streams over an
arrangement of dark urns that looks more like an art piece than a
water feature. The chairs, which are rustic hand-stitched equipales,
have been dressed up with slats of hammered tin. A mirror with a
glittery tin frame hangs near a decorative tin spoon rack.</LD>
<LD>   Apart from the back wall of luminescent glass brick, the room is
painted a warm orange. The tables are covered with leather, the menus
are leather-bound and the wine list comes in a hand-cut metal folder
so heavy you can hardly lift it.</LD>
<TE>   There's obviously a lot of money behind this stylish restaurant,
and it aims at a higher level of cookery than most Mexican
restaurants in Los Angeles. This is not the place to go for
enchiladas and refried beans. The kitchen prefers lightness and smart
presentation, applied to the fusion of pre-Columbian and European
cuisines you find not only in sophisticated Mexico City restaurants
but simple cafes in Oaxaca or Puebla.</TE>
<TE>   Some dishes work well, such as duo de calabaza acapulqueno --
sliced baby zucchini and squash flowers stuffed with seafood in a
delicate cilantro reduction. It's a beautiful plate.</TE>
<TE>   Some fall short, but the concepts are intriguing, such as pilar de
mignon y nopal: a stack of sliced Angus tenderloin and fresh cactus
covered with a dark pasilla chile sauce. The heavy sauce does little
for either ingredient and overpowers the cute baby vegetables
scattered about the plate. When I ordered an appetizer called jaibas
rellenas, I found the crab puree stuffing bland and the whole thing
sloppily arranged and scorched black at the edges.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, those were exceptions. Casa Antigua's mole sauce,
served over game hen, is sharply spicy with chiles and not very
sweet. It's the true Puebla style mole, as good as any you'll find
there.</TE>
<TE>   One seafood dish, huachinango ti-kin-xic, draws on Mayan cuisine.
Wrapped in a banana leaf, the red snapper is coated with a guajillo
chile sauce piquant with vinegar. Fried plantain slices are on the
side.</TE>
<TE>   Salmon acapulqueno spills from a golden tortilla cornucopia.
Slightly crisp at the edges, the grilled chunks of salmon are bathed
in sweet tamarind sauce. (The bits of chile de arbol scattered in the
sauce are more for looks than for heat.) A cluster of baby vegetables
comes with this, also a large heap of scalloped potatoes that seems
too coarse for this sort of food.</TE>
<TE>   The thick, achiote-seasoned sauce that coats thin boneless pork
chops -- chuletas de puerco pibil -- has fresh cactus in it, like the
pilar de mignon, but is more palatable. Here the cactus is mixed with
cilantro potatoes.</TE>
<TE>   The three sauces that accompany a stuffed chicken breast -- red
tomato, pale cheese, intense cilantro -- appear dimly to represent
the red, white and green of the Mexican flag. (I say "dimly" because
most of this restaurant is so dark you can hardly read the menu.) The
chicken is also stuffed with three colors: spinach, carrot and cream
cheese.</TE>
<TE>   Appetizers include quesadillas filled with huitlacoche fungus --
fresh huitlacoche, the waiter insisted. Little masa rounds (pan de
elote) are topped with chicken in a mild chipotle sauce. There's an
unusual house salad, a combination of cool greens and vegetables with
warm seafood and a guajillo chile sauce. It's big enough for a main
dish.</TE>
<TE>   The desserts are all good. Rice pudding (arroz con leche), looks
pretty in its little casserole, half covered with ground cinnamon and
sprouting cinnamon sticks.</TE>
<TE>   A standout is the duo de chocolate, which is actually a chocolate
quartet -- chocolate cake, chocolate ice cream and a densely
chocolate brownie on a plate dusted with cocoa powder that outlines
the image of two crossed spoons. Crepas de cajeta con nuez are well
done, with a thick caramel sauce and chopped nuts scattered over the
crepes.</TE>
<TE>   If you are serious about food, ask for a table in the back, near
the fountain. The front of the restaurant faces the bar, and beyond
the bar is the "cantina," which can be very noisy.</TE>

<LD>HERE in balmy L.A., where the temperature can reach 85 in November,
fireplaces are blazing in trendy dining rooms all over town.
Certainly it's not a matter of physical warmth.</LD>
<LD>   Of course not. It's about creating cozy, intimate space. And what
does that better than a crackling fire?</LD>
<LD>   Think of Bastide, Falcon, Menemsha, Koi, Bliss, the Spanish
Kitchen, Lucques and the Lodge. They have nothing in common but their
fireplaces, which help transform a typical restaurant space into a
room with a mood.</LD>
<TE>   "Fireplaces are a welcome haven for people to congregate," says
Nina Briggs, who used two of them in her design for Menemsha. She
placed them high enough to be seen from anywhere in the restaurant.
"This way you're always making eye contact with the warmth," she
says.</TE>
<TE>   Alice Kimm, of John Friedman Alice Kimm Architects, deliberately
put the fireplace outdoors at Falcon, turning the patio into an
additional room. This gives guests a glimpse of fireplace as they
enter, even if they never experience the warmth of the fire.
"Frankly, it's the nicest space in the restaurant," adds Kimm.</TE>
<TE>   Over at Koi, where there are three fireplaces, one gives drama to
the entrance while the other two serve as a backdrop to lounge and
dining space. "Fire creates a light and warmth that can't be captured
any other way," says Koi's general manager, Andrew Spence.</TE>
<TE>   So are the tables next to the fire the hottest seats in town?</TE>
<TE>   Larry Macias, general manager of the Spanish Kitchen, says the
table for two near the fireplace is the place to sit. "People will
wait and wait for that particular table," he says. "It also happens
to be in a private nook surrounded by greenery, but it's the
fireplace that draws them."</TE>
<TE>   Ever since we mastered fire, we have gathered around the hearth,
and after thousands of years we're still clamoring to sit next to a
roaring blaze.</TE>

<HD>Taking guilt off the menu</HD>
<DH>In the middle of the season of overindulgence, here's a
holiday feast that's as rich in taste as any other. Go ahead, give
in. You won't regret it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Donna Deane</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>DECEMBER is a month for feasting -- which is not necessarily to say
gorging, though it sometimes seems like it. Eating well is not the
same thing as stuffing yourself and eating sensibly is not the same
as being dull.</LD>
<LD>   Take this holiday menu, for example.</LD>
<LD>   This porcini soup looks and tastes richer than it is. One secret
is that it's not a smooth puree -- leaving the texture a bit chunky
makes it feel more substantial.</LD>
<TE>   Here are a few more. You won't have to saute the mushrooms in
butter or oil, because they're dried. All you have to do is rehydrate
them. Cook a little rice in the broth, and when you puree it, the
rice will thicken the soup and you won't need a butter-and-flour
roux.</TE>
<TE>   When you do use fattening ingredients, use only the best and use
them in a way that makes them count. Two tablespoons (not a cup) of
whipping cream will give the soup a lovely feeling of richness. Serve
the soup in a large, shallow bowl to make the portion feel larger
than it is.</TE>
<TE>   A bone-in pork loin makes a handsome display, and it's a good
choice for the main course because today's pork has been bred to be
lean. (In fact, it's so lean you have to be careful not to overcook
it, or it will dry out.)</TE>
<TE>   Ask the butcher to cut through the chine bone between each chop to
make carving easier. Make little pockets between the bones and stuff
them with dried apricots, sage and garlic for an intriguingly sweet,
herbaceous note. I like to spoon lightly buttered bread crumbs on the
roast for extra flavor and texture.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes time to make the gravy, again, forget about the
roux. Just a tablespoon of a light, stock-based sauce made with a
little Port wine will give another dimension of flavor and a
suggestion of richness.</TE>
<TE>   Take a little time to roast some fresh chestnuts for a garnish.
Not only will they look great, they'll taste better then canned
chestnuts. Give each diner two chestnuts to peel and savor.</TE>
<TE>   Braised red cabbage is wonderful with pork, but it doesn't need
the traditional duck fat or loads of slab bacon. Two slices of bacon,
rounded out with fennel seed, are enough. The cabbage can be prepared
a day ahead and will taste even better reheated.</TE>
<TE>   In place of a heavy dessert, I like a few sweet bites that are
rich with interesting flavors. This time, I start with a Seckel pear,
poached in a cinnamon stock with orange zest and a little Port,
mainly for color. It stands overnight in the poaching liquid to
absorb more flavor. The Seckel is the smallest of pear varieties, so
the sauce penetrates it better. For those who think poached pears are
a deprivation dessert, the deep, complex flavors of this one will be
a revelation.</TE>
<TE>   Set each pear half on a little pedestal of spongecake. You can buy
the cake, or make your own up to a week in advance. (Just cover it
well and seal it in a plastic bag before freezing. Take the cake out
of the freezer an hour before serving. Cut out the rounds of cake and
let them stand, covered, until you're ready to serve.) Then just top
it with the pear half, a touch of vanilla yogurt and some honey.</TE>
<TE>   This is a dessert that should please everybody; what makes it
really memorable is chestnut blossom honey. This rugged, robust honey
brings out a whole new side of the pear, and a touch of vanilla
yogurt tempers its bitter edge.</TE>
<TE>   The flavors are luxurious, just like the rest of the meal.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Porcini mushroom soup</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 1 hour, 45 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 6-8</TE>
<TE>   2 1/2 cups dried porcini mushrooms (about 2 ounces)</TE>
<TE>   3 cups boiling water</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon butter</TE>
<TE>   1 cup minced onion</TE>
<TE>   1 clove garlic, minced</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup long-grain rice</TE>
<TE>   2 (14-ounce) cans chicken broth cup</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons whipping cream</TE>
<TE>   1 1/4 teaspoons salt</TE>
<TE>   6 teaspoons low-fat sour cream</TE>
<TE>   Cracked pepper</TE>
<TE>   Snipped chives, for garnish</TE>
<TE>   1. Place the mushrooms in a bowl and pour the water over them. Let
rehydrate, 30 minutes. (Put a plate on top to keep them submerged.)
Lift the mushrooms from the bowl with a slotted spoon. Pour the
liquid into a sieve lined with cheesecloth. Reserve the liquid and
set aside. Mince 2 mushrooms and set aside for garnish. Reserve the
rest.</TE>
<TE>   2. Heat the butter in a 4-quart saucepan over medium-low heat and
add the onion. Cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5
minutes. Add the garlic and cook 1 minute. Stir in the rice. Stir in
the reserved mushroom liquid, then the chicken broth. Add the
rehydrated mushrooms. Bring to a simmer. Cover and cook 30 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   3. Remove one-half cup of the mushrooms with a slotted spoon.
Roughly chop and set aside. Puree the soup in batches, then return to
the saucepan and stir in the cream. Add the salt. Stir in the roughly
chopped mushrooms. Ladle into bowls. Garnish each bowl with a
teaspoon of the sour cream. Sprinkle with cracked pepper, the
mushrooms for garnish and the chives.</TE>

<TE>   Pork loin roast with chestnuts</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 1 hour, 45 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 8</TE>
<TE>   Note: The chestnut recipe is from "Roger Verge's Vegetables in the
French Style" (Artisan, 1994).</TE>
<TE>   Roast</TE>
<TE>   1 (8-rib) bone-in pork loin, bones frenched (about 4 pounds)</TE>
<TE>   16 dried apricots</TE>
<TE>   16 fresh sage leaves</TE>
<TE>   3 cloves garlic, 2 cut into slivers, 1 minced, divided</TE>
<TE>   Coarse salt</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon butter</TE>
<TE>   1 cup fresh bread crumbs</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup plus 1 teaspoon water, divided</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup chicken broth</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons ruby port</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon cornstarch</TE>
<TE>   1. Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Wrap each of the bone ends with
foil.</TE>
<TE>   2. Make 2 deep slits between each of the bones on the loin. Top
each apricot with a sage leaf and a sliver of garlic and fold in
half. Tuck each folded apricot half into a slit in the roast. Season
the meat with salt and pepper.</TE>
<TE>   3. Heat the butter in a skillet until melted. Add the minced
garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in the bread
crumbs. Add salt and pepper to taste. Place the roast in a roasting
pan and top with the crumbs, patting them in place.</TE>
<TE>   4. Roast until a meat thermometer inserted in the center of the
meat registers 150 degrees, 60 to 75 minutes. Remove to a carving
board and let stand while preparing the sauce.</TE>
<TE>   5. Combine the one-fourth cup of water and the chicken broth and
stir into the drippings in the roasting pan, stirring to loosen any
brown bits. Pour into a small saucepan and stir in the port. Bring to
a boil, reduce the heat and simmer 5 minutes. Strain, then pour the
liquid back into the saucepan. Blend the cornstarch and remaining 1
teaspoon of water until smooth; stir into the saucepan and simmer
until the sauce is thickened and clear, 3 to 5 minutes. Season to
taste with salt and pepper.</TE>
<TE>   6. Remove the foil from the bones. Carve the roast, cutting
between the bones. Serve 1 chop with bone per serving, spooning a
little sauce over each. Serve 2 roasted chestnuts on each plate.</TE>
<TE>   Chestnuts</TE>
<TE>   16 whole chestnuts</TE>
<TE>   1. Heat the oven to 550 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   2. Score an "X" on the flat side of the shell of each chestnut.
Place them on a baking sheet and roast until they pop open, 10 to 15
minutes. Remove the chestnuts from the oven and immediately cover
with a towel that has been soaked in ice water and wrung out. When
the nuts are cool enough to handle the shells should peel off easily.</TE>
<TE>   Each serving: 448 calories; 131 mg. sodium; 133 mg. cholesterol;
22 grams fat; 17 grams saturated fat; 19 grams carbohydrates; 39

<HD>Italy's liquid gold</HD>
<DH>Armando Manni's olive oil from Tuscany is a precious elixir
prized by chefs for its flavor and constancy.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ANY day now, I expect to open my mail and find an introductory,
just-in-time-for-Christmas gift subscription offer for Olive Oil
Spectator -- or perhaps The Olive Oil Advocate.</LD>
<LD>   Boutique olive oil -- designer olive oil, artisanal olive oil --
seems to be the newest object of affection (if not, indeed,
obsession) among chefs and home cooks alike. Alain Ducasse touts
olive oil in his winter menu and mailer, and gourmet stores and wine
shops from Los Angeles to New York have shelves filled with extra
virgin olive oil in bottles from so many different producers, and in
so many different shapes and sizes, that it's beginning to feel like
the perfume department in a large airport's duty-free store.</LD>
<LD>   Turri. Trampetti. Mancianti Affiorato. Angela Consiglio's Tenuta
Rocchetta. Everyone has a preferred producer, and the "hot" oil of
the moment changes faster than you can say Badia a Coltibuono. My new
favorites are made in Tuscany by Armando Manni. I wince at the cost
(about $26.40 for a tiny 3.4-ounce bottle), but the oils taste rich
and pure and fresh. When I learned that several of America's best
chefs -- Thomas Keller, Jean-Georges Vongerichten and Charlie Trotter
among them -- also love this oil, I wasn't surprised.</LD>
<TE>   "It's the most full-flavored, luscious oil I've ever tasted,"
Trotter says. "It's so special -- with a strong, forward-fruit flavor
and just the right acidic note -- that using it is a little like
using truffles or caviar. You want it as unadorned as possible. I
spoon a little over a piece of delicately steamed fish."</TE>
<TE>   The man behind this liquid silk is Armando Manni, a 47-year-old
former photographer and documentary filmmaker. Manni -- not a man
given to understatement (or underselling) -- says his oils are the
best and most healthful in the world, thanks in part to the
monitoring and measuring they're subjected to by the Department of
Pharmaceutical Science at the University of Florence.</TE>
<TE>   A bit 'like Viagra'?</TE>
<TE>   Revolutionary production, bottling and shipping methods make his
olive oil an effective agent, Manni says, in the battle against heart
disease, cancer and aging. "It even works like Viagra," he'd assured
me with a wink and a leer when we first met in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Manni says his oil, made with olives grown about 12 miles from
Montalcino, in southern Tuscany, is produced from an assemblage of
seven different cuvees, from different soils, "much like wine in
Bordeaux. We harvest at the perfect point of the maturation of the
olives in terms of the polyphenols that are important as
anti-oxidants. A great extra virgin olive oil might have 100 to 250
milligrams of polyphenol per liter. A lot of our mountain crus have
more than 450."</TE>
<TE>   Manni actually makes two oils: a fruity, delicate oil called Per
mio Figlio (For my Son) and a more full-bodied, vaguely peppery Per
me (For me). He rhapsodized anew about both when my wife and son and
I had dinner with him in August at one of his favorite restaurants,
Colline Ciociare, in the hillside village of Acuto, 50 miles east of
Rome.</TE>
<TE>   The chef, Salvatore Tassa, used Manni's oil that night in a simple
dish--spaghettini, tossed in a skillet with the oil and aged
Parmigiano-Reggiano. But it was transcendent in its very
simplicity--light and chewy and flavorful, the olive oil and the
Parmigiano clinging to and enriching each strand of pasta.</TE>
<TE>   As my family beamed its collective approval, Manni proclaimed,
"The chef could only make this dish with my olive oil"--at which
point, he leaped up from the table, marched into the kitchen and
returned with chef Tassa in tow.</TE>
<TE>   Tassa is 46 and barrel-chested, with biceps that threatened to
split his short-sleeved shirt. He has dark, hooded eyes and an
intense, almost brooding mien. He smiled -- not without effort, it
seemed -- and he and Manni launched into an animated colloquy in
rapid-fire Italian, with Manni translating:</TE>
<TE>   "He says he uses my olive oil in this dish because the fresh taste
of pure olive in my oil goes best with the fattiness and the richness
of the Parmigiano. He says some olive oils don't smell so good when
they're in the pan but mine has an elegant smell. He says he needs an
oil that is always the same during the year and doesn't change its
taste and smell as the year goes on."</TE>
<TE>   I don't speak Italian, so I had to trust Manni -- and I realized,
of course, that his translation sounded like a late-night television
commercial. He is, I quickly learned, a promoter-cum-proselytizer who
could be the love child of P.T. Barnum and Aimee Semple McPherson.</TE>
<TE>   But I've since heard similar comments from other chefs.</TE>
<TE>   "When you open the bottle, it's like biting into a ripe green
olive," Vongerichten says. "I make my own olive oil at the house I
have in the south of France, so I know a little bit about it, and
this is an incredible olive oil."</TE>
<TE>   Waiters at Jean Georges pour small amounts of Manni's two oils in
dishes on every table before the start of dinner, "so they can be
used just like butter," Vongerichten says. The chef also drizzles it
on bay scallops and a couple of other special dishes</TE>
<TE>   Locally, Manni's oil is used at Vincenti in Brentwood, where chef
Tassa--whose dinner at Colline Ciociare was the best meal of our two
weeks in Italy--will be cooking two or three dinners late next month,
with menus designed around the oil.</TE>
<TE>   Vincenti chef Nicola Mastronardi drizzles the Per mio Figlio in
homemade minestrone and the broccoli soup with potato ravioli and
sun-dried tomatoes, he says. "It helps bring out the natural flavors
of the vegetables. I also like the way the oil is packaged, in small
bottles, so it stays as fresh as possible."</TE>
<TE>   With most good olive oils available in bottles ranging from 12 to
24 ounces and larger, Manni's 3.4-ounce bottle is a big selling
point; the oil stays fresher longer, and the special dark glass he
uses helps protect the oil against damaging ultraviolet rays. To
prevent oxidation from contact with air trapped after bottling, Manni
also uses inert gases before sealing the bottles, preserving the oil
much as various devices now preserve leftover wine by pumping similar
gas into the bottle.</TE>
<TE>   Online sales exclusively</TE>
<TE>   Manni's oil is also different in that it's only available through
his Web site (www.manni. biz). Unwilling to lose control over storage
and freshness, he refuses to sell it through stores.</TE>
<TE>   The oil comes in two-bottle packs -- two of the same oil or one of
each -- but it's sold only by the case: five two-packs per case.
Cost: 265 euros (about $264, or $26.40 a bottle) for 10 bottles.</TE>
<TE>   Ouch!</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe friends could buy together," Manni suggests, hopefully.
"They could share the cost and share the oil. I can't send one box to
one customer; it would be too expensive. Most people who send olive
oil to the U.S. ship it, and it either suffers from the heat or it's
put in coolers that make it too cold.</TE>
<TE>   "I think of my olive oil like wine, and you know how temperature
affects wine. So I fly my oil from Italy to the U.S. by FedEx, with
special packing to maintain the proper temperature and chemical
values. The price includes all that."</TE>
<TE>   For all his missionary zeal, Manni is relatively new to olive oil.
He was born in Rome, studied economics in college, then became a
photographer and, in the late 1970s, turned to movie making. He
filmed documentaries for 10 years, mostly for television, and wrote a
couple of movie scripts. But when his son Lorenzo was born in 1997,
the combination of mad cow disease and the early deaths, from heart
attacks, of his father and grandfather prompted him to "research on
what I could feed Lorenzo to keep him healthy.</TE>
<TE>   "Being Italian, it's not surprising I settled on olive oil."</TE>
<TE>   A year later, he began working with the University of Florence.
Last year, he started selling the oil -- 8,000 small bottles. This
year he figures to sell 27,000.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a small business," he says, with uncharacteristic (and
not altogether persuasive) modesty. "It's more a mission and a
pleasure than a profit-making venture. Once I get it up and really
going, I'll go back to the movies. I have this script already
written, a love story between a Japanese and an Italian, with food as
the milieu and.... "</TE>

<LD>Honey with an intense flavor</LD>
<LD>   You'll never mistake this grainy, butterscotch-colored French
honey for some wimpy clover honey. Miel de Chataignier (chestnut-tree
honey) has a bold, intense aroma with notes of leather, sweet tobacco
and dried fruit. If other honeys are like the flute, this one is an
oboe.</LD>
<LD>   In our pear dessert, just a bit is enough to add drama and
complexity. The honey can also stand up to strong cheeses such as
Parmesan or blue cheese, rustic breads, pancakes, walnuts or
hazelnuts.</LD>
<TE>   An 8.83-ounce jar of Miel de Chataignier is $5.95 from Nicole's

<HD>And in California, the green treasure's in season</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Emily Green</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>TO most of our minds, top quality olive oil is foreign, usually
Italian, with names that sound like they could be a food, or the
title of some ultra-worldly count. Badia a Coltibuono and all that.
But behind their names and their confusing grades (pure, virgin,
extra virgin) is a simple fact: Olives are fruit. Olive oil is
nothing more complicated than fresh fruit juice, except that we
garnish and cook with it instead of drink it.</LD>
<LD>   Like all freshly squeezed juice, the most important determinant of
quality isn't exotic provenance. It's freshness. On the tongue,
freshness tastes like flowers, herbs and grass. It's sharp,
immediate. It's as emphatic as a garnish as a shot of lemon, but a
whole lot meatier.</LD>
<LD>   Right now, olive oil so fresh that it outshines whatever you put
it on is being made at more than 100 California ranches. The harvest
started in November and is in full swing now. Oil producers will be
picking their trees, pressing and bottling the 2002-03 season oil
through February.</LD>
<TE>   Chris Banthien, 2001 winner of the best in show for her Le Colline
di Santa Cruz Olive Oil, made in Aptos, is bottling her new season
oil this minute. She reckons that it keeps its just-picked intensity
for about a month, after which it's merely extra-virgin, cold pressed
good stuff.</TE>
<TE>   The problem California producers have had to date is that, quite
often, their oil is not as well made as, say Count Badia's. Some say
Italian oils are better because they start with better olives. The
state's old groves, planted with Mission, Sevillano and Manzanillo
olive trees tend to produce rich, sometimes bland oil. As a result,
new wave producers, such as Banthien, have been increasingly offering
greener, grassier-tasting oils made from recently planted Tuscan
varieties of olives, including Frantoio, Maurino, Leccino and
Pendolino.</TE>
<TE>   When farmers pick their olives and press them will also affect the
oil. The words "early harvest" usually signal a green, tangy oil and
late harvest a riper, golden one.</TE>
<TE>   Some say the state needs fiercer policing and certification. Oil
can be fusty or musty. If left in heaps before pressing, olives can
ferment -- like fruit -- and their juice can be rank. California now
has an impressive panel of expert tasters trained to sniff out this
sort of defect. Any bottle bearing the seal of the California Olive
Oil Council will have passed the muster of this set of bloodhounds,
but small producers, even ones making great oil, often don't bother
with this.</TE>
<TE>   The thing you should look for, particularly when buying oil in a
store, is a date. Not all California producers give them. The Santa
Cruz olive oil producer Balzana is an honorable exception. Its new
season oil should be in Los Angeles shops early next year. If you see
it, buy it. It's a fine oil.</TE>
<TE>   The most satisfying way to taste new season oil is buying it
direct from the farmer, or olive press. In Northern California, a
number of olive presses are open to the public.</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California, you can order it online or go to farmers
markets. Pasolivo, an Italian-style oil made in Paso Robles, has been
offering last year's oil in Torrance and Palos Verdes for $16 for 500
milliliters, and it was good. New stuff should be arriving in farmers
markets in late January. Ron Asquith recently started selling
brand-new Ojai Olive Oil for $15 for 375 milliliter bottles at Ojai
farmers market. They won't fit in your cabinet. The blue bottles are
too tall, but if you're using it right, you shouldn't need to. You
should run out before it has a chance to age much.</TE>
<TE>   Rule No. 1 for any good olive oil -- not the supermarket $5.99
"extra virgin" kind, but the stuff that costs the same as good wine
and comes in bottles fit for bath salts -- is to buy small amounts
often.</TE>
<TE>   Use it fast. Pour it over bean soup, on bread, salad, vegetables,
potatoes or grilled fish. Put it over bresaola, salami, even cheese.
When you make a sandwich, forget mayo and mustard, use oil and
vinegar. Of course, put it on pasta.</TE>
<TE>   For the brief time that it should take you to use it up, store it
in a cool dark cabinet. Roberto Zecca, proprietor of Frantoio
restaurant and olive press in Mill Valley, even advises keeping olive
oil in the fridge, as one would any fruit juice, though the oil needs
to warm before being used.</TE>
<TE>   No olive oil should be stored in a sunny, warm spot or at the rear
of the stove, unless you want that buttery, rancid taste.</TE>

<HD>A sweet and salty end for Ramadan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Charles Perry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>THIS is the final week of Ramadan, the month when Muslims fast during
the daylight hours. What does a Pakistani restaurant do during the
fast?</LD>
<LD>   "Oh, we stay open for lunch during Ramadan," says Sajjad Prenjee,
the chef and owner of Asian Kitchen in Culver City. "We don't cater
exclusively to Muslims.</LD>
<LD>   "Then at 3:30 or so we close for dinner prep, and we start serving
dinner at sundown. In addition to the regular menu we have a buffet.
Usually we don't have a buffet at dinner, but, during Ramadan, people
are pretty hungry, they want to get something right away."</LD>
<TE>   Asian Kitchen, one of the Southland's relatively few Pakistani
restaurants, serves a neighborhood with a substantial Pakistani or
Indian Muslim population. Several other Pakistani businesses cluster
near the corner of Venice Boulevard and Motor Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   Ramadan ends as of sundown Friday, inaugurating the holiday known
as Id-ul-Fitr. Pakistani and Indian Muslims will break the fast by
eating a date or some salt, followed by dinner. In the morning
they'll attend prayers at a mosque, have lunch at home and then go
out for dinner.</TE>
<TE>   "They visit with family and friends," says Prenjee. "This goes on
for three days." Among the traditional foods of Id-ul-Fitr are
biryani (pilaf mixed with meat and various garnishes) and halwa
(sweetmeats).</TE>
<TE>   "Lots of halwas," says Prenjee. "You'll see desserts and cakes
everywhere. We send cakes to every house." The old tradition was to
send around traditional Indian sweets such as rasmalai, gulab jamun
and jelebi. "But the tradition has changed," says Prenjee. "Now many
people send [European-type] cakes, because they're more convenient
for that."</TE>
<TE>   At home, the classic Id-ul-Fitr dish is shir khurma, a sort of
pudding made from thickened milk and seviyan, a very fine vermicelli
that you can buy in Indian markets, usually ready-toasted for use in
this dish. An ordinary seviyan pudding is eaten year-round, but shir
khurma is richer, made with more nuts and other ingredients such as
dried fruits and usually given a golden glow by adding saffron.</TE>
<TE>   This is the dish served after returning from prayers on Id-ul-Fitr
and to guests throughout the holiday. It is a somewhat liquid cousin
to rice pudding, tasting of concentrated milk and roses. Many
versions include dried fruit ("khurma" means date), but Prenjee's
does not, making for a restrained and elegant dish dominated by the
flavor of almonds, pistachios and saffron.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shir khurma</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 45 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 6</TE>
<TE>   Note: Sajjad Prenjee uses no raisins or dates in his version of
this dish and sprinkles saffron over the surface, rather than mixing
it in. To make powdered saffron, dry 8 saffron threads in a skillet
over low heat for a few minutes and grind them in a mortar. Toasted
seviyan is sold in Indian markets; you can substitute fine vermicelli
fried in a little butter until golden. In place of rose essence, also
sold in Indian markets, use a teaspoon of rosewater.</TE>
<TE>   3 cups milk</TE>
<TE>   1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup seviyan or browned vermicelli, broken into short pieces</TE>

<HD>May I introduce your steak?</HD>
<DH>At the new Arnie Morton's downtown, the menu is
show-and-tell, the beef is super-aged and every portion is humongous.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. Irene Virbila</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>DOWNTOWN L.A. has quietly become a mecca for those who like their
steak prime. Pacific Dining Car has worn the mantle for more than 80
years (and is still the only place to go when you get a craving for
Porterhouse at 3 a.m.). Add Nick &amp; Stef's, another branch of the
Palm, and now this Arnie Morton's, not to mention hotels trying to
horn in on the idea, and downtown L.A. is awash in steak.</LD>
<LD>   Arnie Morton's is part of a chain known as Morton's of Chicago
everywhere but in L.A. The "Arnie" was added here in an attempt to
avoid confusion with Morton's, the West Hollywood entertainment
industry hangout owned by Arnie Morton's daughter and son.</LD>
<LD>   The fact that the original is a Chicago institution has always
given Arnie Morton's a certain cachet. Chicago loves to eat and eat
well. Dainty doesn't fly in Chicago. When Spago opened there several
years ago, Wolfgang Puck had to adjust the portion size dramatically
upward.</LD>
<TE>   At Arnie Morton's everything is big -- and not just the steaks.
It's a trencherman's paradise where rustic baskets are set around the
room, as if someone just walked home from the farm with a harvest of
beefsteak tomatoes as big as grapefruits, asparagus spears the size
of Churchill cigars, and potatoes that look as if they've had
implants. Red wines in oversized bottles -- magnums, double-magnums,
jeroboams -- are disposed about the room for decoration. It's a place
where, guaranteed, you'll never stare down a mingy portion wondering
how a restaurant has the chutzpah to charge so much for so little.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, quantity is not the issue; quality is -- at least, the
quality of the steaks.</TE>
<TE>   Arnie Morton's real claim to fame is its super-aged prime beef
cooked to a true rare (cool blue center) or medium rare (warm red
center) in an incredibly hot 800-degree broiler. Even if you could
find aged prime beef at your local market, it's impossible to achieve
that gorgeous charred crust at home. Hence the perennial popularity
of the steakhouse.</TE>
<TE>   A replica of itself</TE>
<TE>   Like all chains, Arnie Morton's offers the comfort of the
familiar. Every locale resembles every other, distinguished with a
photo gallery tailored to each locale. Here, it's vintage photos of
USC football stars running down the field, Howard Hughes in the
cockpit and the obligatory stars.</TE>
<TE>   Hidden in a glitzy mall, its doorway jutting out from a California
Pizza Kitchen facade, the downtown Arnie Morton's has the feel of a
speak-easy. Frank Sinatra's voice wafts up from the underground
restaurant as you descend the staircase. Someone is there to greet
you just in front of a wall of wine lockers, each bearing a brass
name tag. They belong to regulars who buy wine from the restaurant at
a 10% discount and store it there. Why? I haven't a clue. Ten percent
off this wine list is no bargain.</TE>
<TE>   At the back, the broiler glows red. The meat sizzles. The room is
Midwest clubby with leather booths, white linens and the restaurant's
signature bronze pig lamps on each table. The crowd is mostly
businesspeople mixed in with tourists and the occasional big spenders
on a date. The room doesn't exactly reverberate with conversation.
Everyone is too absorbed in eating.</TE>
<TE>   The minute you sit down, a waiter brings a loaf of bread, warm
from the oven. It's about the size of those foil balloons you find
stranded in trees. Airy and sweet, with a scattering of charred
onions on top, it seems like bread from the '70s, before artisanal
breads were an option.</TE>
<TE>   Then comes what the steakhouse calls the "visual presentation of
the menu," unless you can think up an excuse to get out of the
tedious exercise. The presenter rolls over a cart and soldiers
through a tortuous monologue, holding up plastic-wrapped cuts of beef
with all the aplomb of a wooden apprentice magician. Lamb chops,
salmon, broccoli, beefsteak tomatoes all have their moment in the
limelight. A somnolent lobster, though, misses its cue to wriggle
vigorously.</TE>
<TE>   The presentation ends with a breathless recital of desserts --
souffles, molten chocolate cake, apple pie -- that need to be ordered
at the start of the meal. It's a smart policy because, by the end of
a steak, most people would have to plead no room.</TE>
<TE>   Appetizers are as predictable as the array of steaks. There's a
fine shrimp cocktail, which is really four or five meaty shrimp on a
plate with a crock of excellent horseradish-laced cocktail sauce.
Caesar salad is limp and overdressed, spinach salad truly awful. Wise
diners will stick with the humongous beefsteak tomato, sliced and
strewn with chopped red onion and crumbled blue cheese. Though
lobster bisque may seem like an iffy thing to order at a steakhouse,
Arnie Morton's does a lovely, albeit rich, version of the classic
soup.</TE>
<TE>   Morton's best steaks are the New York sirloin strip and the
Porterhouse, both long-aged to concentrate their flavor. The
Porterhouse may be silkier in texture, but the New York strip is,
hands down, the most satisfying.</TE>
<TE>   Curiously, one night when I ordered the steak au poivre made with
a New York strip, the beef wasn't the same quality. The peppercorn
sauce was delicious, though. Cajun steak, marinated either 16 or 60
hours, depending on which waiter is explaining the dish, takes a good
rib-eye and turns it into a mushy piece of beef. What exactly are the
spices? Our waiter could say only that the steak was marinated in "a
whole lot of Cajun spices."</TE>
<TE>   The one thing you can count on at any of the Morton's steakhouses
I've tried is that the steaks are precision-cooked. At the downtown
locale, this is not always the case.</TE>
<TE>   One night, three steaks were cooked well beyond the medium-rare or
rare ordered. And on another, two steaks were overcooked. When
pointed out one night, though, the waiter was quick to offer to
replace the steaks. And on a second try, they were cooked correctly.</TE>
<TE>   And aside from beef ...</TE>
<TE>   The menu does offer more than steak. Prime rib is a beautiful
piece of beef, served in its juices. And thick double-cut lamb chops
are terrific. Broiled salmon is nicely cooked, but Chicken
Christopher is inedible. The chicken is quite ordinary, but the
creamy sauce was so overdosed with garlic that no one wanted more
than a bite.</TE>
<TE>   The sides are uneven too. Baked potato or the buttered potato
skins are the best choices. Those huge asparagus stalks arrive al
dente and tough, not an ideal vehicle for the classic hollandaise.
Broccoli is woody. They're just the sort of vegetables that people
who would rather eat steak would order: so they don't have to think
about vegetables again.</TE>
<TE>   Desserts don't offer much redemption. The souffles for two have a
peculiar texture, more slippery than cloud-like. The Grand Marnier is
passable, the chocolate a steep disappointment, tasting more like it
was made with a spoonful of cocoa than top-notch chocolate. If you
must have dessert, order the New York cheesecake, which is the real
thing from the Bronx: simple and unadorned. And not too sweet.</TE>
<TE>   To stand out in the crowded downtown steakhouse scene, Arnie
Morton's is going to have to give real attention not only to the
quality of the steaks but also to how they're cooked and to
everything else.</TE>

<HD>Holding nothing back</HD>
<DH>Few restaurants offer a decent selection of mature wines,
citing the high cost of maintaining an inventory of older vintages.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rod Smith</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>IMAGINE spending hundreds of dollars to dine in a trendy restaurant,
and being served a salad of rock-hard, tasteless tomatoes or a
bananas flambe made with green bananas. Oddly, though, that's what
happens all too often with the wine: Most restaurants pour hard,
tannic reds that really need a few years of bottle age before they're
ready to drink. Almost none offer a selection of mature wines.</LD>
<LD>   Most restaurant wine lists are made up almost entirely of new
releases, to the point at which they resemble retail inventories. Yet
a retailer is sending wine home with the customer, who at least has
the option of laying the bottles down to let time work its softening,
mellowing magic. The restaurateur is serving the wine immediately.</LD>
<LD>   A meal in a restaurant happens right now. The food arrives at the
table ready to eat. Shouldn't the wine be ready to drink?</LD>
<TE>   Yes and no, say restaurant wine buyers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's expensive, and there's not a huge return," says Rick Jones
of Valhalla Restaurant in Sausalito, Calif. "The margin is so small
that adding additional inventory is too much. You have to have next
year's wines now, without an immediate return. I don't think it's
fair to ask restaurants to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Jones agrees that a wine list should offer some mature wines. As
the manager and wine buyer for Greens at Fort Mason in San Francisco
for more than a decade, he made a point of maintaining a large
inventory that allowed him to add wines to the list as they reached
optimum drinkability. That did not go unnoticed by wine lovers, who
flocked to the restaurant during the '90s to eat chef Annie
Somerville's vegetarian cuisine with beautifully mature, reasonably
priced wines.</TE>
<TE>   But that cellaring program was expensive, he says, and caused
constant friction with the restaurant's owners. "Our inventory was
$100,000, and the owners wanted it to be a third of that. I fought
that every day."</TE>
<TE>   Jones and his partner in Valhalla, Master Sommelier Nunzio Alioto,
still recognize the need for some older wines on the list. So they
raid their own cellars to supply them. "Fortunately, we both have
deep cellars and were able to stock the restaurant with some older
Cabernets, Bordeaux and Pinots from there. We also started planning
the cellar early, before we opened, and were able to have some
suppliers hold wines for us until we had the funds to pay for them.
But you can't do that all the time."</TE>
<TE>   Debbie Zachareas, managing partner and wine buyer at Bacar in San
Francisco, agrees that a restaurant should offer mature wines -- and
that the cost is prohibitive. "My personal decision is to just offer
everything, and not decide for the customer that they should wait
until this wine is mature. There are a lot of people who like to
drink young wines. If that's what they want, then the wine will sell.
If not, then it naturally becomes older."</TE>
<TE>   Bacar is one of the most wine-intensive restaurants in the
country. Zachareas says her wine inventory is about $250,000, with
about 1,200 selections. There's no room in the budget or the cellar
to age wines, she says. "I would rather buy what's current and offer
that, and then supplement my list with wines that are already aged."
She works her extensive network of contacts to procure older wines on
the secondary market, and prices them to move.</TE>
<TE>   And she notes that those mature wines account for some of the
fastest turnover on the list. "Lately I'm seeing a great demand for
Bordeaux from the '70s and '80s," she says. "A lot of it is
investment banker types from the East who are used to drinking
Bordeaux. They look at the prices and say, 'Why drink an overpriced
California cult wine when I can get an older Bordeaux for the same
price, or less?' I'll get some '66 Lynch Bages or '78 Ducru
Beaucaillou in on Friday, and it will be gone by Sunday."</TE>
<TE>   A well-aged Bordeaux is perfect table wine -- smooth and
harmonious, with vibrant flavor and supple texture and the bright
acidity that complements food so well, all in the context of a
civilized alcohol level. By contrast a big, young red wine,
especially California Cabernet, can be entirely overwhelming.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, it may seem voluptuous and soft at first glance, but after a
few sips the concentrated tannins and acids kick in and begin to
overwhelm most palates with creeping astringency. Only die-hard wine
hobbyists find that appealing.</TE>
<TE>   Decanting helps. Splashing a young wine into a decanter introduces
oxygen that immediately starts softening the tannins and opening up
the compressed aromas and flavors. That's why a growing number of
sommeliers are automatically decanting young red wines.</TE>
<TE>   But decanting is only a partial solution. Most wine lovers have a
story or two about decanting a big Cabernet or Pinot Noir at the
start of a meal, only to begin enjoying its full fragrance and
flavors as the decanter is emptied.</TE>
<TE>   The real solution is actual bottle age. In a perfect world a
restaurant would serve only wines at optimum drinkability, as
determined by a knowledgeable sommelier who knows what's going on in
the cellar.</TE>
<TE>   But the restaurant wine world is far from perfect. "Most wineries
don't make older vintages available, and the ones that do charge
exorbitantly," says Jones. "My feeling is that they should be selling
the wines when they're correct [for drinking]. But you can't even buy
the previous vintage."</TE>
<TE>   He offers a simple solution. "Why don't the wineries hold on to
some of the wine longer? How about a two-tier system, selling this
year for retail and next year for restaurants?"</TE>

<LD>"Martha Stewart Living" lives!</LD>
<LD>   Even as the blond media icon faces allegations of insider trading,
her nationally syndicated daily television program will enter its
11th season next fall, according to distributor King World.</LD>
<LD>   The Securities and Exchange Commission as well as the Justice
Department are examining her sale of stock in ImClone Systems Inc.
the day before the drug maker announced a damaging ruling from the
Food and Drug Administration on its key cancer drug. Stewart has
denied the accusations, but in an SEC regulatory filing last month,
her company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc., said the pair of
high-profile investigations has had a negative impact on advertising
revenue for both Martha Stewart Living magazine and her TV show.</LD>
<TE>   The program, which runs one hour on weekdays and 30 minutes during
one weekend episode, emphasizes cooking, gardening and entertaining.
King World said it already has clearance in 70% of the country for
next fall's renewed season.</TE>

<HD>Pacific Symphony ends fiscal 2001-02 with a small surplus</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Bucking a national trend in which many orchestras are running
deficits, the Pacific Symphony announced Tuesday that it ended its
2001-02 fiscal year with a slight surplus, for its 11th consecutive
year in the black.</LD>
<LD>   The Orange County-based orchestra said it spent $10.78 million and
took in $10.81 million during the year that ended June 30, for an
unaudited surplus of $29,000. Donations totaled $4.2 million, up 21%
from the previous year, and the box-office take of $4.7 million was
up 15%. President John E. Forsyte said the orchestra's endowment grew
from $6 million to $6.6 million, with new contributions offsetting
investment losses. It attracted 32,575 single-ticket buyers and sold
16,229 subscriptions.</LD>
<LD>   "This has traditionally been a very generous community, and the
board worked very hard" to keep donations coming in a down economy,
Forsyte said. But he cautioned that the current fiscal year, at its
midpoint, is shaping up as "a more difficult year," with some
contributions shrinking and expenses looming, such as an American
Composers Festival in February that remains about $50,000 short of
its fund-raising goal of $250,000.</LD>

<HD>An offbeat dialogue covering marriage and home</HD>
<DH>A House in Istria: A novel; Richard Swartz. Translated from
Swedish by Anna Paterson; New Directions: 216 pp., $23.95</DH>

<LD>"A House in Istria" is about obsession. This debut novel by Richard
Swartz, a veteran Swedish journalist based in Eastern Europe, has
nothing resembling a plot. Instead it's made up of hilariously
convoluted conversations resulting from one man's determination to
buy a house.</LD>
<LD>   The object of the man's fixation is an abandoned 200-year-old
residence, next door to his own, in the Croatian region of Istria.
The man doesn't explain to his wife why he wants the house, only that
he must have it. Both characters are nameless; the woman, who
narrates the story, is a native Istrian, her husband is not. She
speaks the local dialect, as well as the commonly understood Italian,
neither of which the husband understands or bothers to learn. And so
his much-put-upon wife perpetually has to translate conversations for
him.</LD>
<LD>   "A House in Istria" begins as absurdly and mysteriously as it
ends. One evening in July, in the midst of a terrible heat wave, the
husband leaps up and announces to his wife that "I must see it at
once, this evening, right now, I cannot wait any longer" -- an
eruption that the woman attributes to "[t]he moon, our fat moon of
Istria that drives people and cattle mad." The man climbs over the
wall separating their house from the one next door, bloodying his
hands in the process.</LD>
<TE>   It's immediately clear that an already frail marriage is about to
be tested further. The husband, home-buying aspirations aside, is
difficult to live with. He complains about the way his wife makes the
bed, rarely listens to anything she says and often behaves like a
petulant child.</TE>
<TE>   The woman gives a clear idea of what she's dealing with: In one
scene, she describes her husband muttering to himself, then going
into the kitchen, "where he got himself two cold beers from the
fridge, the last piece of our Hungarian salami, a couple of slices of
rye bread and the Krk cheese that my mother sent me, and all of it he
wolfed while his eyes almost closed again, his drooping eyelids
swollen, practically black, and afterwards he spent rather a long
time on the toilet." Aside from being a portrait of a marriage, the
novel also offers insight into a region struggling to reconcile its
war-torn past with modern-day capitalism. The husband is frowned upon
by his neighbors as an outsider with no regard for Balkan history or
for those around him -- and this disrespect comes back to haunt him
as he seeks to buy the house. "You've got to be friendlier towards
the people in the village...." his wife says. "You should take an
interest in their stories and try all the tasty tidbits they offer
you, preserves or cakes or whatever it is."</TE>
<TE>   The woman is reluctant to leave the perfectly comfortable house
where she lived long before meeting her husband. The idea of trying
to "upgrade" to a larger home makes her worry about what others in
the village will think. Yet she tags along as he tries to find out
who owns the house and how much it would cost. The novel covers a
week in the life of this hapless couple, chronicling the quixotic
mission through a series of bizarre conversations that go nowhere.
First they approach a neighbor named Dimitrij, who has made the
mistake of starting a vegetable garden on the property the husband
already considers his own. Dimitrij responds to the angry man, and
his embarrassed wife, with scorn: "Imagine! He's taken over the empty
house and now he stands there accusing me of having broken into his
house.... Maybe it's you who owe us an explanation?"</TE>
<TE>   The couple also visit an eccentric local man named Beppo who knows
all the local gossip, but he proves unhelpful in giving any leads.
They also have a lengthy visit with Franjo, the wife's lawyer, who
explains to them that "in this country blood is of the utmost
importance," and therefore the man has no right to buy the house. "As
far as we Istrians are concerned," he tells the woman, "your husband
is a complete stranger .... Forget that house. It's not for sale."</TE>
<TE>   The encounter with Franjo is surreal, as he finds dozens of ways,
over a matter of hours, to let the couple know that they cannot have
the house. Eventually they find their way to the owners, Signora Nina
and Signor Antonio, who live in Trieste.</TE>
<TE>   That meeting is just as hopeless as their previous ones, as
Antonio explains his kidney problems in detail, and Nina keeps
changing the subject to anything but the house. Meanwhile, the wife
translates the dizzying conversation in its entirety, and Nina
criticizes her for passing on extraneous information to her husband.</TE>
<TE>   For a novel where everyone is odd, nothing is fully explained and
not much happens, "A House in Istria" is a worthwhile read. Lacking a
tidy resolution, this quirky, antic novel is frustrating at times,
yet it's also weirdly absorbing and funny.</TE>

<HD>Suge's next act?</HD>
<DH>The rap mogul's empire has dwindled, but he sees only
possibilities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Geoff Boucher</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The party at the Playboy Mansion was over hours earlier, and as the
clock ticked toward 4 a.m., Marion "Suge" Knight was back in his
darkened office and puffing on a Cuban cigar. Over his shoulder, the
framed platinum albums glinted like chrome rims in a low fog. It was
then, as so often happens with the rap music mogul, that the topic
turned to murder.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm a product of the inner city, and if you're from off the
block, more than likely, you're going to go in a violent way or spend
your life in prison," he said in a near whisper. "But no matter what,
mine will be a peaceful death. You see, I have made history. And I
know one thing: Ain't no man can stop me from going to heaven."</LD>
<LD>   The late hours and ominous talk are trademarks of the 37-year-old
Knight, the founder of Death Row Records. In the 1990s, Knight's
company pushed hard-core rap into the music mainstream and generated
$100 million a year in album sales at its peak. But along the way,
its chief became infamous for a strong-arm style and his proximity to
people who ended up dead.</LD>
<TE>   Just two weeks ago, 175 heavily armed sheriff's deputies swarmed
Knight's office, his homes in three cities and a dozen other sites as
part of a slaying investigation. Three men identified as Knight
associates were arrested but were later released and not charged. A
fourth Knight associate was charged in a Nov. 26 attempted murder
warrant and remains at large. Investigators have said Knight is not a
suspect in the ongoing probe.</TE>
<TE>   "The taxpayers," Knight said, "are the ones that should be
outraged here. All this, for what?" He declined further comment on
the police probe, which centers on factions of the Bloods and their
alleged roles in a June 7 killing and an Oct. 22 attempted murder.
Knight has long been associated with the Bloods and through the years
has hired the gang's members as employees.</TE>
<TE>   The hulking Knight has never minded the whispers that follow him.
Just the opposite. The former football player exults in the idea of
himself as a John Gotti from Compton, a celebrity tough guy in a
killer wardrobe.</TE>
<TE>   Now, though, the murmurs at music industry events have a different
Suge subplot: Does Knight even matter anymore?</TE>
<TE>   Knight has heard the doubters and agreed to two interviews in the
past week to answer the question of his music industry relevance.</TE>
<TE>   In both he presented himself as a serene businessman who is
passionate about music and relentlessly optimistic. He is
inconsistent when speaking about matters of the street; he presents
himself as a survivor who has outgrown the gang scene and its
violence, but every time he goes into the studio he walks beneath a
handwritten sign: "Keep it Gangsta."</TE>
<TE>   At its peak, Death Row Records was a hit factory led by superstars
Tupac Shakur (who recorded as 2Pac), Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg, and
Knight was the dealmaker and details man. But the slaying of Shakur,
the defections of Dre and Snoop and Knight's own imprisonment have
left that empire diminished.</TE>
<TE>   Renamed simply Tha Row, Knight's company now finds its biggest
hits in the music of its past, such as "Better Dayz," a posthumous
package of unreleased 2Pac music that today will debut high on the
nation's album chart.</TE>
<TE>   But Knight says there is only one full album's worth of unreleased
Shakur music remaining. The long-term health of Tha Row will be
determined by its new stars. "Death Row is all pictures and
memories," Knight acknowledges, "and now it is about Tha Row ... "
And so far Tha Row has yet to prove the doubters wrong. The debut
album from its most promising new talent, Long Beach rapper Crooked
I, was due in stores in September but has yet to be released.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a guy who was a folk hero and a guy everyone talked about
or feared," said Huyn Kim, an editor at Vibe, the hip-hop magazine
that has tracked Knight's exploits for years. "But now, well, he has
to show he can start over and there's a lot stacked against him."</TE>
<TE>   More than a dozen music executives, artists and top publicists
interviewed for this story agreed with that appraisal, but none would
say it on the record.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is if you publicly say that Suge still matters, you
look like an idiot to everyone," said one publicist with a client
list that includes major rap artists and executives. "And if you say
he doesn't, well, then you have to deal with Suge."</TE>
<TE>   The name Suge is pronounced like the first syllable of "sugar,"
and it's short for "Sugar Bear," a childhood nickname that still fits
the demeanor of Knight in one-on-one conversation. His casual voice
is quiet and without sharp edges. His 6-foot-3, 320-pound frame
clearly belongs to a former athlete, but there is also a softness to
his wide grin.</TE>
<TE>   Knight is a difficult man to reach. His company is small and
insular, and the doors are always locked at his offices in the
mirrored-glass building on the corner of Wilshire and San Vicente
boulevards. After years of scrutiny by investigators from the LAPD,
FBI, IRS and others, there is a logical reticence among Knight's
circle of associates. It extends to the media, too, after countless
articles on the mogul's exploits (the most frequently repeated
anecdote is rapper Vanilla Ice's claim that Knight dangled him from a
balcony in a business dispute, which Knight denies) and the recent
film "Biggie &amp; Tupac," which points to Knight as a menacing figure
and possible murder conspirator.Still, this past week he welcomed a
reporter into his offices and his studios and was relaxed enough to
munch on tacos and watch ESPN in the same building where SWAT
officers prowled the corridors just two weeks earlier. He agreed to
answer all questions, but it became clear that queries about crime or
his family life would get only vague or philosophical answers. He
described himself again and again as a devoted son, a doting father
of four and the rare rap-world celebrity that needs no bodyguards.</TE>
<TE>   "I am a happy man, a free man, a blessed man," he said. "My life
is not a complicated life because of that happiness."</TE>
<TE>   Not popular in Vegas</TE>
<TE>   Knight's internal cheer does not sway everyone. Las Vegas Mayor
Oscar Goodman, for example, said he was stunned by the visceral
reaction last year to Knight when he visited the desert city.</TE>
<TE>   "He came into town and wanted to know if there was interest here
in him doing a Death Row Records equivalent out of Las Vegas,"
Goodman said. "I said I was happy to talk about it. He was spotted in
my office and word got out and the public went nuts saying, 'We don't
want him in this town.' That drove him away."</TE>
<TE>   It was in Las Vegas that Knight weathered the most infamous night
of his life. It was Sept. 7, 1996, when video cameras in a hotel
lobby captured images of Knight, Shakur and others brutally beating
down a gang rival. That was just hours before Knight was wounded and
Shakur was mortally wounded in a shooting attack.</TE>
<TE>   The casino assault eventually put Knight in prison for five years
-- it was a violation of his parole and came after previous
convictions on assault and federal weapon charges. The Shakur killing
became a flashpoint in rap violence, which would crescendo again in
March 1997 with the slaying in Los Angeles of Shakur's archrival
Christopher Wallace, the rap star known as the Notorious B.I.G.
Police say both killings remain unsolved.</TE>
<TE>   Knight's name is so frequently mentioned in the theories
surrounding the two deaths that he has become a walking symbol of the
rap industry's bloodshed.</TE>
<TE>   Through the years Knight has been contemptuous or cryptic when
asked about either shooting. On Saturday night, at a Burbank
recording studio, he said he has no insights to offer.</TE>
<TE>   "When God puts a period on something," he said, "who am I or
anyone else to put a question mark? The past is the past."</TE>
<TE>   Knight grew up in Compton the youngest of three children, and his
father, a truck driver, encouraged him to find discipline through
sports. His high school football exploits led him to the University
of Nevada Las Vegas and then, briefly, to the roster of the Los
Angeles Rams. A post-sports stint as a bodyguard inserted him into
the music industry.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Dre was already known for his work with seminal rap group
N.W.A, and in 1992 he and Knight launched Death Row Records. A
lawsuit filed by Eazy-E, another N.W.A member, claimed Dre was freed
from his previous contractual commitment by Knight's use of a lead
pipe as a negotiation tool. Knight has denied that account but
settled the lawsuit. Death Row was on its way and would become a
powerhouse by decade's end.</TE>
<TE>   "I did something that people thought could never be done and never
would be done," Knight said. "It became history.... If you make
history once, people are going to say you're a genius or you were
lucky. But make history twice? That is unheard of."</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, he wants to make history by adding a second act to
his career as mogul. Even the skeptics find it hard not to watch.</TE>
<TE>   For example, at the Playboy Mansion party last Tuesday, the sight
of Knight making his way through the crowd was like watching a
hurricane tracked on a weather map -- a swirl forms and follows in
his wake.</TE>
<TE>   Knight came to the party in a light-blue denim shirt, matching
jeans and immaculate white sneakers -- a uniform similar to prisoner
togs at Mule Creek State Prison. He chuckled at the thought. "Yeah, I
told myself when I came home, no more denim. But then again, it's a
different situation now. And you got to always humble yourself."</TE>
<TE>   Knight may be humbling himself regarding regional pride as well.</TE>
<TE>   The Playboy Mansion event was an album release party for Ja Rule,
the star rapper from Queens, N.Y., who is signed to the East
Coast-based Murder Inc. Records. Knight and the guest of honor
greeted each other warmly and chatted quietly about upcoming projects
they will share an interest in. That's notable considering Knight's
once rabid role in the so-called East Coast versus West Coast rap
rivalry, the industry schism that was a compelling backdrop in the
Shakur and Wallace slayings.</TE>
<TE>   Now Knight has artists from Tha Row appearing on albums by East
Coast rappers and has even allowed Ja Rule and Nas to splice Shakur
recordings into their tracks, even though both of those stars are
associated with the East Coast scene that Shakur publicly reviled.</TE>
<TE>   A cynic would say Knight finds his allegiance where the money is,
but he says he has grown beyond the mentality of rivalry. "I am still
representing the West Coast like no other," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He has not shied from antagonizing his perceived foes, either.</TE>
<TE>   In June, Knight's appearance at a television awards show included
an angry exchange with Snoop Dogg (the rapper also has a graphic
insult song aimed at Knight on his new album). In February, the mogul
shook up the West Coast gathering of a group promoting hip-hop
activism and unity. Knight insulted a raft of rappers by name and was
heckled by some for using raw language from the dais.</TE>
<TE>   Knight says others' perception of him is something beyond his
control and beneath his attention. He also said he is no longer part
of a world where violence is the currency.</TE>
<TE>   "In the beginning my world was small," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I covered a lot of ground, but it was small areas. Running around
and getting in trouble, situations with constant shootouts and people
going to prison, that world is small to me now. I lived that. Now my
world is bigger. I'm above it. Now instead of floor seats at the
game, I got my own luxury box."</TE>
<TE>   The debts of the past still demand payment, however.</TE>
<TE>   Lawsuits and back taxes</TE>
<TE>   There's a deep list of lawsuits against Knight and his company,
many filed by former business associates, vendors, managers and
artists who say they are owed money that, lumped together, is in the
millions. A divorce from wife Sharitha Golden led to a 1999 court
order that he pay her $735,000 in unpaid child support. A filing last
month by Golden says the bulk of that money remains unpaid, although
sources close to the matter say a court-created receivership siphoned
about $600,000 last month from Knight's company to go toward that
debt.</TE>
<TE>   The IRS also informed Knight in July that he owes about $6 million
in personal income taxes. Court records also show that in recent
years, Knight has been spreading his various real estate properties
among other people, including several of the women in his life, among
them Michel'le Toussant, an artist on Tha Row and Knight's third
wife. Those properties include his Malibu mansion and a Las Vegas
home used by Martin Scorsese in the filming of "Casino." He recently
sold his lavish Tarzana music studios as well.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the man who was prisoner No. 434980 leads his complicated
life from a comfortable perch. He still has his Staples Center luxury
box and his car collection, more than 24 vehicles -- even if some of
the vintage cars in the garage of his Wilshire Boulevard office
building have flat tires and looked untended.</TE>
<TE>   "Next year, 2003, that will be a big year for me," he said with
unflinching confidence. He plans to publish his memoirs next year
(one working title: "Suge Knight: American Dream &amp; American
Nightmare"), but even more exciting to him is the release of the
debut album from Crooked I. At a studio in Burbank he played a track
from the album, which has powerful and smooth rhymes about California
and its cycle of violence.</TE>
<TE>   The Crooked I album is advertised on a large billboard that crowns
the label's offices. In a way, the sign says more about the mercurial
nature of Tha Row than it does about any album.</TE>
<TE>   The billboard shows the rapper squatting on a toilet and the
explicit caption beneath is in keeping with that image. In September,
Clear Channel Outdoors Inc. filed suit claiming that Knight had
hijacked the company's sign and put up offensive material that has
led to complaints from passersby. Clear Channel claims that Knight's
intimidating staffers have blocked anyone from the roof.</TE>
<TE>   "They are not allowed to take it down," he said with a laugh.
"Look, if they think the sign is inappropriate, they should come meet
with us. But don't tell us what to do. Look, when you're black and
from the ghetto and in Beverly Hills, there are going to be problems.
I represent the ghetto. I represent the good and the bad, what can be
and what is. And some people are scared of that."</TE>

<HD>Opera's hidden, offstage drama</HD>
<DH>The U.S. system of training young singers produces
versatile, well-prepared talents, it can be fraught with pitfalls,
critics say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Justin Davidson</AU>
<BD>Newsday</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Here's a line to make a teenager's parents blanch: "Mom, Dad, I want
to be an opera singer."</LD>
<LD>   What a budding lyric mezzo may imagine as years of hard, honest
work, rewarded with velvet cloaks and bouquets hurled on stage, her
elders may foresee as a youth of failed auditions, temp jobs and
tears.</LD>
<LD>   Yet thousands of young people do become opera singers, at least
for a while. They go to conservatory, get graduate degrees, work the
church circuit and doggedly pursue auditions before finally deciding
that music is not really meeting their needs for praise, spiritual
sustenance or health insurance. The system is slower than ever at
weeding people out, which lengthens the hoping years for those who
have not yet broken through, making the disappointment that much
harder to take if they never do. It also produces rookies whose peers
are paying mortgages and having third children.</LD>
<TE>   "I can think of no other career where the word 'young' is used so
generously," says Robin Thompson, associate artistic director at New
York City Opera. "People who are just starting out, who have gotten
out of school and gone into young-artists programs, they're pushing
30."</TE>
<TE>   There was a time when the American opera world relied on Europe to
finish its trainees. After graduating from Juilliard, a young
American singer would make an audition tour of Germany or Italy,
hoping for a three-year stint in one of the many state-supported
regional companies there. Temporary emigration was the only way for
singers to be fully employed and provided the additional benefit of
honing their languages and permitting them to imbibe Mozar's or
Rossini's style at the source. Americans acquired a reputation as
well-prepared, versatile, quick and ready for whatever high-concept
antics the stage director had in mind. The best and luckiest would
return home with greater stature and a sheaf of major roles they had
sung many times.</TE>
<TE>   But the appetite for opera has grown dramatically and so has its
infrastructure: More than half of the 136 companies in the United
States and Canada were born in the last 30 years, and they have done
their best to keep the talent here. Many have started apprenticeship
programs modeled on those at the Metropolitan and San Francisco
operas, which provide a handful of singers with a small salary,
benefits, plenty of coaching and a chance to take a minor role onto a
major stage. (L.A. Opera has a less-ambitious Resident Artists
Program.)</TE>
<TE>   There are so many more companies, Thompson says, that the talent
to feed them has become scarce. "These programs need fresh bodies
every year. If a baby Verdi baritone or baby lyric tenor has
surfaced, there is huge competition to get that individual into a
young-artists program. Board members look upon them as part of the
family. They're cute, you can have them over for dinner. The mid-20s
singer is in the drivers' seat."</TE>
<TE>   That is not necessarily how it feels to the mid-20s singer, for
whom a smile from a conductor or the first phone call from a manager
can feel like a seraph's touch. But it is true that fewer freshly
minted singers feel the need to get exposure overseas. Now the best
emerge more slowly because they come under the protective tutelage of
people like Gayletha Nichols, the mother-hen-like director of the
Met's Lindemann Young Artists Development Program.</TE>
<TE>   "There's an obsession with youth out there," she grumbles. "A
singer who is 24 or 25 and has a great voice may not even know how to
sing yet, but some company manager will come to her and say, 'I think
you should sing nine performances of 'Carmen' next year in our
house.' " That, Nichols makes clear, would be unwise and
shortsighted.</TE>
<TE>   The willingness to let performers mature in adulthood also means
that many singers come to the art form late. Morris Robinson, a
33-year-old bass who is one of Nichols' current charges, spent his
college years playing football at the Citadel and was selling
plastics for Exxon when he decided to try putting his voice to work.
He auditioned for the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston;
within a few months he sang the King in "Aida" at Boston Lyric Opera.
Last month he made his Met debut as the Second Prisoner in
Beethoven's "Fidelio."</TE>
<TE>   Nichols is part of the army of teachers, vocal coaches, managers,
administrators and conductors who listen with an ear to the future.
Whenever they hear an audition, they are also trying to divine what
that singer will sound like three, six and 10 years from now. Partly,
that helps satisfy an immediate need: The largest companies cast
their shows several seasons ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Most voices get darker and heavier over time, so a soprano who
sings sparkly ingenue roles in her 20s may eventually move into the
wailing women of Verdi. But singing too much or plunging prematurely
into strenuous dramatic roles can be disastrous over the long run.</TE>
<TE>   "Before you're 40, you shouldn't really be singing Rigoletto,"
says Pamela Rosenberg, general director of the San Francisco Opera.
"Everyone wants too much too soon."</TE>
<TE>   The notion of a protective network of experts anxious to keep
singers from burning out seems attractive, but there are downsides.
The system's critics -- even critics within the system -- say that it
shelters young performers too much and for too long. "If model A for
a career was 'You have a big, exciting voice, so let's get you on
stage and singing "La Gioconda" at 21,' model B is 'Let's keep
watching, training and observing you until you're almost 30,' " says
Brian Zeger, a pianist who works with singers at Juilliard and the
Met. "It makes you very self-conscious."</TE>
<TE>   The Met program gets high marks from everyone, but some people
feel that all the years of supervision can also produce performers
who fret so much about technical perfection that they forget to
communicate. Singers emerge from their chrysalis with beautiful
diction, the ability to sing on demand in Czech, and a repertoire
that ranges from baroque recitative to music that was composed last
March. What they lack is personality.</TE>
<TE>   All that emphasis on versatility, so the argument goes, produces
singers who are professional but bland.</TE>
<TE>   There is general agreement that American training for singers is
the best in the world. But a system that rests on the educational
trinity of caution, technique and versatility does not produce many
artists steeped in the subtleties of any one historical style.</TE>

<HD>Stuck on geometrics</HD>
<DH>A couple in Venice shape a design business out of a love of
dots, circles and even invading aliens. The best part? Their colorful
decals are easy-on, easy-off.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What happens when an architect and a food editor team up to bring
taste to bland walls? They make geometric decals in mint, lemon and
tomato.</LD>
<LD>   Scott Flora and Jerinne Neils, who share a 1980s duplex in Venice
and a fondness for Pop Art, have blended computer-generated images
with vinyl film to create colorful adhesive polka dots, blocks,
bolts, even invading aliens, that can be stuck on walls -- and later
easily pulled off. "We felt this cave-painting need to change our
home quickly, easily and cheaply without having to mess with paint,"
says Flora.</LD>
<LD>   One wall in Flora and Neils' living room has white squares
positioned into diamond patterns. An adjacent wall has three rows of
steel-blue dots with an off-center middle row. And another wall has
three randomly placed red dots.</LD>
<TE>   After three years of experimenting on their walls, Flora, an
architect, and Neils, a food editor for Web sites and restaurant
guide books, launched their mail-order company, Blik, in October. The
two 35-year-olds are betting there are plenty of people who want to
personalize their surroundings without a lot fuss and, in the case of
tenants or employees, grief from a landlord or boss (all that's
needed to remove the decals is a little fingernail action).</TE>
<TE>   In designing their shapes, they were especially inspired by Sol
LeWitt's cubed wall drawings from the 1960s. But precisely
duplicating shapes in paint as he did is time-consuming and difficult
even for professionals.</TE>
<TE>   So, Flora and Neils powered up a Mac G4 and a suite of Adobe
graphic-design software to create squares and rectangles, ellipses
and ovals and then transferred the images onto thin, self-adhesive
vinyl film. The decals are good for onetime application -- they lose
their clean shapes once removed.</TE>
<TE>   Although designing with vinyl decals is forgiving enough for just
about anyone to play with, the basic idea has also captured the
imagination of serious artists. Currently on display (through Dec.
29) on the lobby walls at the UCLA Hammer Museum in Los Angeles is a
work by Jim Isermann, who created vinyl shapes -- round-cornered
squares and rectangles in primary colors -- and installed them in a
complex pattern.</TE>
<TE>   When Flora and Neils saw the Isermann exhibit, they were more
convinced than ever that the decal line they were launching would hit
home. The shapes they are marketing -- a set of eight 12-inch-wide
shapes sells for $35 -- have inspired a variety of uses in homes and
workplaces.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Papa, president of Vision New Media in Santa Monica, thought
their tomato-red lug-nut decals would "communicate a creative,
eclectic look" in a coffee-shop scene he was shooting for an
independent film. After the wrap, he says, "I took a package home for
my apartment in Brentwood."</TE>
<TE>   Holly Hirzel decorated her cream-colored office at Sony Computer
Entertainment in Santa Monica with decals that reminded her of the
vintage video game Space Invaders. With the help of a friend, a
ladder and a level, she placed dozens of kiwi-colored aliens and
their missiles on her wall in about 45 minutes. "Everyone comments
about the wall, because it has a retro-gaming feel," says Hirzel, a
product manager for PlayStation. "It's nostalgic."</TE>
<TE>   Recently, at a showing of the Blik decals at the Ilan Dei store in
Venice, architect Brit Billeaud instantly visualized how he could lay
a series of cocoa and raspberry doughnuts into a grid on his living
room wall. Landscape architect Tomer Levi said he planned to
rearrange the lemon-colored ellipses he bought -- as though they are
puzzle pieces -- and not attach them until he's satisfied he's found
a solution that's just the right fit.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone," says Flora, "has a different idea."</TE>

<HD>Slouching (sniffle) into the holidays (achoo!)</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Wake up in the middle of the night with a head cold that would kill
most men. Like thumbs against my windpipe. Now I know how Bob Dylan
feels when he tries to sing. So I go to the bathroom cabinet and
start twisting off childproof caps.</LD>
<LD>   "Dad, what are you doing?" asks the little girl.</LD>
<LD>   "Here, open this," I say.</LD>
<TE>   And she twists open a bottle of something red. Nice bouquet. Sort
of smoky-flavored. Triaminic, bottled in 2001. "Take one of these,"
my wife says, handing me a blue pill.</TE>
<TE>   "Ecstasy?"</TE>
<TE>   "Just take it," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "Viagra?"</TE>
<TE>   "Shut up and swallow," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "What's Dad doing?" someone else asks, and suddenly the whole
family is awake, going to the bathroom and making noise. Flushing.
Drinking. Gargling. The sounds of Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   "Why are we always sick in December?" my wife asks.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the excitement," says the boy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tradition," says the little girl.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, some families have better traditions than others.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   At the office, there's more holiday news and turkey talk. "My cat
won't eat dark meat," Vic complains. "Just walks away."</TE>
<TE>   "That's a cat," I say. "A dog would eat the dark meat and the
plate it was served on."</TE>
<TE>   "And the hand that gave it to him," Vic says.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's Joe, who enjoyed a large dinner with relatives and
noted how a topic of conversation would begin at one end of the
table, then pass clockwise from one little group to the next, until
it circled the table and a new topic would start.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like 'Row, Row, Row Your Boat' in hell," Joe explains. So
as you can see, everyone at the office had a pretty good
Thanksgiving.</TE>
<TE>   Back at home our big feast also went well. A friend's 3-year-old
said grace, mumbling something about food, God and her mother. Not
bad for a first try.</TE>
<TE>   As dinner wound down, a couple of third-graders told jokes so old
they creaked. Then the parents licked the merlot from their lips,
sighed deeply and began two hours of clean-up.</TE>
<TE>   "I may never eat again," I moan.</TE>
<TE>   "Pumpkin pie?" someone asks.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course," I say.</TE>
<TE>   Thanksgiving: the season's pregame meal.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the mail, the first Christmas card arrives.</TE>
<TE>   "What's with them?" I ask.</TE>
<TE>   "She's amazing," my wife explains.</TE>
<TE>   "She's nuts," I say.</TE>
<TE>   Already behind on Christmas, I take another shot of cold
medication and sit before a roaring TV, trying to warm my feet on a
Laker game.</TE>
<TE>   Blame it on the medication, but I find myself switching between
the game and the Trinity network. Sports and prayer. Prayer and
sports. It's important to have a balance in life.</TE>
<TE>   "If we plant the seeds of character in our kids now," urges a guy
shaped like a walrus, "we'll reap the rewards forever."</TE>
<TE>   "Honey, get me some seeds," I yell.</TE>
<TE>   Because already on the kitchen counter are the children's
Christmas tip sheets. Thoughtfully, they have left us long lists of
things they would like.</TE>
<TE>   That's a kid for you. Generous by nature, kids understand that in
order for the economy to recover, consumer-parent spending needs to
rise.</TE>
<TE>   Their mother and I will answer most of these requests. It's what
parents do, when they can. It's just expected. But real generosity,
they say, is doing something nice for someone who'll never know the
source.</TE>
<TE>   Here's your chance. The Times Holiday Campaign is currently
raising money for dozens of charities across Southern California. The
agencies provide a range of services to disadvantaged children, from
food and shelter to literacy programs.</TE>
<TE>   An author once noted that there is a wonderful, mystical law of
nature that the things we crave most -- happiness, freedom and peace
of mind -- can be attained by giving them to someone else.</TE>
<TE>   'Tis the season to find out.</TE>

<HD>Corigliano Quartet blends old, new works</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard S. Ginell</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Corigliano, a living composer, has the rare distinction of
having a string quartet named after him, even though he isn't
particularly prolific in that genre. Nevertheless, the Corigliano
Quartet seems to take his name as an inspiration to promote new
American quartets alongside the old European masters.</LD>
<LD>   They did precisely that in the Cerritos Center's Jose Iturbi Gold
Medal Series on Monday night, sandwiching the new Quartet for Strings
by Shafer Mahoney -- a world premiere -- between familiar items by
Beethoven and Smetana.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, the 28-minute piece fit the old mold securely, cast in
four movements with the traditional scherzo, slow movement and
rondo-finale, written in an audience-friendly, tuneful, sometimes
lush musical language.</LD>
<TE>   Mahoney, who teaches at the City University of New York, offered
his most inventive ideas in the lengthy first movement, a set of
variations that reaches a peak in a central passage that suggests the
wide-open spaces of Roy Harris. But the piece seems to run short of
fuel in the restless finale, unsure of where to go yet unable to sit
still.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, the performers gave Beethoven's Quartet No. 1 in F a
clear-cut, classical approach, with the exception of a bit too much
melodrama in the adagio movement. Their impassioned treatment of
Smetana's "From My Life" Quartet was most effective in the finale's
harrowing depiction of the composer's deafness -- and least
convincing in a somewhat lurching treatment of the second movement.</TE>
<TE>   As a deflating bit of in-your-face sass after the earnest emotion
of Smetana, the Coriglianos signed off with Ives' tiny, jokey,
gleefully abrasive scherzo "Holding Your Own" -- easily the most
ear-stretching thing on the program.</TE>

<LD>Los Angeles Opera will replace its highly anticipated January concert
performances of Luciano Berio's new orchestration of Monteverdi's
"The Coronation of Poppea" with concert performances of three
operatic pieces, including Berio's 1966 re-orchestration of
Monteverdi's "The Battle Between Tancredi and Clorinda."</LD>
<LD>   "A Concert of Passion &amp; Poetry: Domingo, von Stade and Nagano," to
be conducted by L.A. Opera principal conductor Kent Nagano, will also
include Acts 3 and 4 of Massenet's "Werther" with company artistic
director Placido Domingo, Frederica von Stade and Maki Mori; and Act
4 of Verdi's "Otello" with Domingo and Carmen Giannattasio.</LD>
<LD>   The opera company confirmed Monday that "Poppea" -- slated for
Jan. 11-19 with Domingo and Von Stade performing -- would be canceled
because the composition was not completed. The problem was the
deteriorating health of Berio, Italy's foremost contemporary
composer. The company still plans to present "Poppea" at a later
date.</LD>
<TE>   L.A. Opera director of operations Edgar Baitzel said Tuesday the
company has not pressed Berio for details of his illness, but said:
"It's been known in the music world for a couple of years that his
state of health was not good."</TE>
<TE>   Baitzel added that the company has been aware for about six weeks
that Berio would be unable to finish the work, but postponed
announcing the cancellation until a replacement concert could be
assembled using as many of the contracted soloists as possible. Of
that group, Hei-Kyung Hong could not be worked into the program, and
she has agreed to release L.A. Opera from its obligation to pay her
fees. The soprano will perform a concert for L.A. Opera next season.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement Tuesday from his home in Tuscany, Berio did not
specify his illness but expressed "great dismay" at having to
postpone the premiere "of my revisitation of my beloved 'Poppea.' My
recent recovery has been held back by new medical complications and
my doctors have ordered complete rest. The work I have completed for
'Poppea' is complex and delicate but it is incomplete and cannot be
performed at this time."</TE>
<TE>   Last season, L.A. Opera presented Puccini's "Turandot" with a new
15-minute ending composed by Berio. Baitzel said that, ironically,
L.A. Opera was able to present that premiere because of Berio's
health problems: The composer was unable to complete that work in
time for an earlier scheduled premiere at La Scala in Milan. "We had
the benefit, but now we are the victim," Baitzel said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the January "Poppea" performances were originally planned
as a fully staged production, they were scaled down to concert form
because Berio had been in an auto accident and was behind in
completing that orchestration. (Opera officials say they do not know
whether Berio's current health problems are related to the accident.)
Domingo said in a statement Tuesday that the postponement will allow
L.A. Opera to return to its plan to present the fully staged work in
a future season.</TE>
<TE>   The cancellation of "Poppea" is the second major schedule change
this season for Los Angeles Opera. In August, the company canceled
November performances of Kirov Opera's $3-million production of "War
and Peace" due to financial problems.</TE>
<TE>   That production was replaced by another Kirov opera, "Lady Macbeth
of Mtsensk,", which ran into its own difficulties when the 10-day
shutdown of West Coast ports prevented the sets, costumes and props
from being unloaded in Los Angeles. The boat carrying the items went
on to Tokyo. Costumes and props had to be flown back to L.A. from
Tokyo, and the sets had to be rebuilt from scratch.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the third big hit this season," Baitzel said of the
"Poppea" problem. "I think three is enough."</TE>
<TE>   All tickets for "Poppea" will be honored for the same times and
dates for "A Concert of Passion &amp; Poetry." Ticket-holders requesting
exchanges or refunds should contact L.A. Opera customer service,
(213) 972-8001.</TE>

<BD>Newsday</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Music television" used to mean MTV. Now the term could be applied to
almost any prime-time dramatic series -- and some sitcoms as well.</LD>
<LD>   From "The Sopranos" to "Gilmore Girls," from "Dawson's Creek" to
"Providence," more weekly TV shows are downplaying traditional
orchestral underscoring and salting their soundtracks with rock, pop
and hip-hop tunes by groups ranging from the rich and famous to the
unknown and hopeful.</LD>
<LD>   The playlists of most radio stations are tame and monotonous by
comparison.</LD>
<TE>   Tony Soprano made his fourth-season entrance waddling down his
driveway to the calamitous yowl of "World Destruction" by Afrika
Bambaataa and former Sex Pistol John Lydon. On "The West Wing,"
President Bartlet strode rain-soaked and resolute to a pivotal news
conference to Dire Straits' "Brothers in Arms." "Six Feet Under"
artfully folds in recordings as agonized as PJ Harvey's "One Time Too
Many" and as campy as Julie London's sultry take on bubble-gum rocker
"Yummy Yummy Yummy."</TE>
<TE>   Last season's Humanitas Prize-winning episode of "Scrubs," in
which its three young doctors each lost a patient, gained emotional
impact from a montage set to John Cale's rendition of a Leonard Cohen
song called "Hallelujah."</TE>
<TE>   Classic rock tunes by the Who ignite the opening credits of "CSI:
Crime Scene Investigation" and its new, Miami-based spinoff, but
their episodic music leans heavily toward current bands such as the
Wallflowers and Euphoria. "Providence" is a haven for folkies and
soft rockers such as Shawn Colvin and Dar Williams.</TE>
<TE>   The list could go on and on. The producers of "The Sopranos"
license up to 100 "source" songs -- existing recorded material -- per
13-episode arc.</TE>
<TE>   Several series have in-house tunesmiths to provide situation- and
character-specific originals. "Gilmore Girls" employs Grant-Lee
Phillips, late of alt-rocker Grant Lee Buffalo, and folk-pop
singer-songwriter Sam Phillips.</TE>
<TE>   Her husband, T-Bone Burnett, Grammy-winning mastermind of the
rootsy "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" movie soundtrack, is doing
similar chores for "Crossing Jordan."</TE>
<TE>   Ten years ago, such musical adventurousness was unusual. Twenty
years ago, it was unthinkable. TV was still in the phase in which a
series' musical elements consisted of a catchy opening theme and
orchestral underscoring that most viewers scarcely noticed.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the oddities are shows like "JAG" that rely largely on
orchestral scoring. Now, cover tunes are risky business. Now,
production budgets reflect the necessity of "authenticity," even
though the license fee for a song can run from $2,000 to $20,000.</TE>
<TE>   "If a kid is blasting music in his room and it's a cheap rip-off
of something, it's just not going to have the same effect as if he's
really blasting Kottonmouth Kings or something," says Ann Kline, who
helps producer-writer John Wells choose source music for "ER," "The
West Wing," "Third Watch" and his new "Presidio Med."</TE>
<TE>   The shift started gradually. "Miami Vice" (1984-89) broke the
history of TV music in half, turning cop action into music videos to
the beat of big-time rock hits such as Phil Collins' "Something in
the Air." "The Wonder Years" (1988-93) shrewdly incorporated pop hits
from the '60s. "Northern Exposure" (1990-95) set the pattern for many
of today's shows, using a quirky radio station and the jukebox at a
local bar to work everything from Nat King Cole to Lynyrd Skynyrd
into its soundtrack.</TE>
<TE>   There are many reasons why the trend has snowballed, but it mainly
comes down to who's running the shows -- and the networks. It's men
and women who cut their teeth on rock and soul and, in some cases,
were potty-trained to MTV.</TE>
<TE>   "We're incredibly, psychotically passionate about music," says
Bill Lawrence, creator/executive producer of "Scrubs," of his show's
staff and cast.</TE>
<TE>   "We generally start every day with somebody having a CD or a song
they want everybody to hear."</TE>
<TE>   "It's fun," says Amy Sherman-Palladino, creator/executive producer
of "Gilmore Girls." "It's fun that you've had this song in your head
that you've loved for 100 years, and now you get to, like, put it on
and do a great scene around it.</TE>
<TE>   "The music industry is very confused right now. It's very closed
off. Young people especially don't get exposed to a range of
different kinds of music unless they have someone in their family, an
older sister or brother or Mom or Dad or someone, who'll say, 'Hey,
why don't you listen to XTC?' ... Maybe I can infuse a little bit of
something else in my own crazy, little, tiny way and maybe have four
people go, 'Boy, that's kind of a good sound.' "</TE>
<TE>   Yes, they're on a mission from God -- or at least Apollo, the god
of music.</TE>
<TE>   But there's more to this sea change than kids loose in the candy
factory. It's also -- surprise, surprise -- about marketing.</TE>
<TE>   "First and foremost, it's something people see as another selling
point," Lawrence says. "We weren't in tune with how big a deal [using
pop tunes] could be until we started doing it, and the most hits on
our Web site the day after a show aired were, 'What was that song,
and how can we get it?' People are music freaks, especially the
[young] demographic the networks are looking to grab."</TE>

<HD>The moral of this story: Write your own fable</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fables are very short stories that end with a moral or lesson about
human behavior. The most famous fables are credited to Aesop, said to
be a Greek slave who lived more than 2,500 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Often the characters in fables are animals that act like humans,
as in "The Hare and the Tortoise" and "The Three Little Pigs." Can
you think of others? Why do you think animals are used as stand-ins
for people?</LD>
<LD>   Here's an opportunity to write a fable of your own. First, think
about the moral of the story or lesson you want to teach. Write
something like "Cheaters never prosper" on a sheet of paper. On the
next line describe a situation that could cause a character or group
of characters to learn this lesson. After that, come up with a list
of characters, perhaps animals, that will be in your fable. List the
characters on the next line of your paper.</LD>
<TE>   When writing your rough draft, keep in mind that you are building
toward the moral. It should be the climax of the story. Create events
for the plot that lead to the moral at the end. Remember not to make
the story too long or the plot too complicated. Simplicity works best
when writing fables. You should be able to fit the pre-writing steps
described here, plus the rough draft, on one page.</TE>
<TE>   Let someone else read your rough draft and give you feedback. This
will help you decide if your fable teaches the lesson you intended.
Use this person's comments and suggestions when you revise. Remember
also that spelling counts, so edit your fable for correctness after
you have done your revision.</TE>
<TE>   To learn more about how to write fables, tune in to "Homework
Hotline" Thursday on KLCS-TV from 4:30 to 5:30 p.m.</TE>

<HD>Richard Harris' final star turn</HD>
<DH>While preparing to play a modern King Lear, the actor
confided: 'I almost feel this might be my last role.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It seems apropos that Richard Harris' last starring role was as a
contemporized King Lear in the film "My Kingdom," which opens Friday
for a one-week Oscar-qualifying engagement.</LD>
<LD>   In the drama co-written and directed by Don Boyd, Harris plays
Sandeman, a Liverpool mob boss whose life is shattered when his wife,
Mandy (Lynn Redgrave), is killed in a mugging. He winds up losing his
home, power, fortune and dignity when he gives his "kingdom" to his
two eldest money-grubbing daughters.</LD>
<LD>   With his mane of white hair, thick glasses and weathered visage,
Harris gives a towering performance as a man who is betrayed and
nearly destroyed by his family.</LD>
<TE>   Making the film with Harris, who died Oct. 25 of Hodgkin's disease
at the age of 72, was a gratifying and sometimes exasperating
experience for the cast and crew. "In terms of the choice of an actor
for the lead, I don't think you can ever think about doing a film of
that nature without having Richard on the list," producer Neil
Weisman says. "But there was obviously a certain amount of
trepidation of the reputation that precedes the person."</TE>
<TE>   "Richard was legendary for someone who caused huge problems on
film sets," Boyd says. The director first learned of Harris'
reputation from Lindsay Anderson, who had directed the actor in his
first film success, 1963's "This Sporting Life," as well as in the
theater. "Lindsay always said, 'You know, Don, he is a truly great
film actor, and though we had huge differences and he made my life a
nightmare, if you ever have the chance to work with him whatever age
he would be, jump at it.'</TE>
<TE>   "When I came to meet Richard for the first time, I told him all
about my knowledge of him through Lindsay, and it was interesting.
Richard immediately responded with a bunch of stories of what it had
been like to work with him, which was his side of the story."</TE>
<TE>   Although Harris had said he loved the script, Weisman says they
went through a bit of a "scrap" a few weeks before production began.
"As Don tells the story, it happens with a lot of actors that the
reality of going up to the location and actually making the thing
hits them.... He said he had given notes to Don and they weren't
fully incorporated into the script."</TE>
<TE>   So Boyd and Weisman ended up leaving pre-production in Liverpool
to meet with Harris at his apartment at the Savoy Hotel in London.
Boyd believed Harris was worried about playing a man who causes such
havoc. "He was afraid of portraying the descent of a man at the end
off his life," Boyd says. "He said to me, 'I almost feel this might
be my last role.' "</TE>
<TE>   Boyd says the aspect of Harris that "proved to be both brilliantly
inspiring and at the same time aggravating in the extreme was his
obsession about this role." Harris, he adds, had long wanted to do a
production of "King Lear" on stage but it had never come to fruition.</TE>
<TE>   "He immersed himself in the psychology of the character, but he
had to operate that in parallel with his huge knowledge of the
Shakespearean 'King Lear.' I had absolutely no preparation for
somebody who was going to match my obsession about the film. The
first thing I had to address was his shift from his great admiration
for me and what I represented to the operational function of being an
actor within a film where every line and every scene was something he
had to believe in."</TE>
<TE>   Boyd and Harris had three or four "enormous rows." Still, Boyd
adds, "from the very beginning he understood the position of the
director. He said, 'If I respect the director, then I am going to
want them to understand me.' "</TE>
<TE>   Every morning before filming began, Boyd would report to Harris'
trailer, where they would go over every line and every scene. "In
terms of the argumentative nature of Richard," Boyd says, those
exchanges "were technical and had to do with the job. They were not
personal. As soon as that was understood, it was a complete delight."</TE>
<TE>   Harris, Boyd reports, wanted every element of his look to be
perfect. Once on the set, Harris was obsessed with silence.</TE>
<TE>   "He couldn't stand noise," Boyd says. "I respected that. That
didn't mean you couldn't go and talk to him. He liked everything
detailed and specific."</TE>
<TE>   Harris was a great draw for the other actors in the film. "He did
kind of assume a father-figure stature to the rest of the actors,"
Weisman says. But that also meant if his character didn't get along
with certain others in the film, Harris didn't relate very well to
the actors who played those parts. But he became a true mentor to
Emma Catherwood, who plays Sandeman's beloved third daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Catherwood first met Harris just before production began. "We went
for a drink, and he just kind of asked me something about the
character and how the father and daughter developed," says the
actress. "I answered him and I think I passed the test. Everything
was OK after that."</TE>
<TE>   Harris reminded her of her grandfather. "When men reach the age of
70 they are grouchy old codgers," Catherwood says, laughing. "They
like to drink and wind people up. Richard would wind people up and
then snigger behind their backs. In actual fact, he was pulling their
legs."</TE>
<TE>   Harris was generous with her. "He taught me camera angles and
where not to put my face," Catherwood says. "He did me a really big
favor. He found out I was up for a movie and he phoned the producers.
He got me the part, but then the movie fell through. I thought that
was gorgeous for him to do."</TE>
<TE>   Although her sister Vanessa had worked with Harris 35 years ago in
"Camelot," Lynn Redgrave wasn't well acquainted with Harris before
playing his wife, Mandy. "I had wanted to work with Richard," she
says. "As it turned out, I just made it."</TE>
<TE>   For Redgrave, the happiest day during shooting was a scene in
which Mandy and Sandeman chat in the car on the way to a church
concert. "It was just the two of us in the car, and it felt like we
were alone," Redgrave says. "We kind of improvised endlessly. He was
the sort of actor where you can't see where it's coming from. You
don't see the wheels going around. He has always been a bold and
extraordinary actor, and he is very economical in this."</TE>
<TE>   Boyd and Weisman last saw Harris in July at the film's British
premiere at the Cambridge Film Festival.</TE>
<TE>   "He was in good spirits," Weisman says. "He did a terrific Q&amp;A.
Initially he was a bit prickly with the guy who did the Q&amp;A, but he
ended up being very generous."</TE>
<TE>   "I went to see the film in London after he had died," Boyd said.
"I had tears streaming down my face through the entire viewing
because I didn't really feel he had gone. I felt he was there. I felt
he was in the cinema with me. That's the great thing about movies, if
you capture that spirit, it's there for a very long time."</TE>

<LD>In pop music, as in life, there's always a place for the simple
things. That may explain the return of Soft Cell, the British
techno-pop duo that sold millions of records two decades back with
simple beats, simple melodies and stories of simple decadence.</LD>
<LD>   The best thing that's happened for singer Marc Almond and
keyboardist David Ball in the 20 years since their heyday is the
improvement in synthesizers.</LD>
<LD>   It's given their new reunion album "Cruelty Without Beauty" --
whose title Almond got backward Monday at the House of Blues in
Anaheim -- a fuller, more sophisticated air than their all-electronic
songs of yore.</LD>
<TE>   Those cheesy sounds presumably were intentional, a manifestation
of the monochromatic emotions Soft Cell celebrated and lamented. In
the new single "Monoculture," Almond once again echoes musically what
he sees in the world around him:</TE>
<TE>   Life is losing all its flavor</TE>
<TE>   Everything's the same</TE>
<TE>   Again and again and again</TE>
<TE>   Over and over and over</TE>
<TE>   Monoculture.</TE>
<TE>   As it unfolded in concert, however, this nonstop cabaret was more
metronomic than erotic.</TE>
<TE>   Almond, with his bleached-blond hair and herky-jerky dance moves,
is a moderately engaging singer, and his voice is more assured than
it was in the '80s, but he still comes off like a poor man's David --
Bowie or Byrne, take your pick.</TE>
<TE>   The mostly thirtysomething, less-than-capacity crowd also reveled
in simple things: nostalgia for the soundtrack of their teen years,
and lots of dance-ready beats.</TE>

<HD>For most viewers, it's 'must miss' TV</HD>
<DH>Those who make TV, write about TV or merely watch a lot of
TV have all had the experience: Offhandedly mention some hot series
and be met with a vacant stare.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It happens all the time at holiday gatherings where Hollywood types
rub elbows with civilians that the show-biz trades refer to as
"non-pros." And it reminds us that "water-cooler shows" -- programs
so pervasive that anyone can discuss them, theoretically, around the
office water cooler -- are nearly a thing of the past, as today's
overflowing TV lineup filters the audience for most shows down to a
trickle.</LD>
<LD>   Somebody just scanning press coverage from November could easily
surmise that "everyone" watched -- or at least is abuzz about -- "The
Bachelor" or "The Osbournes," in much the same way that much of
America came to a stop when "I Love Lucy" aired in its heyday.</LD>
<LD>   So, for those who consider "The Bachelor" -- as one of my non-pro
relatives put it -- "the stupidest thing on television," here's a
dispatch from the glass-half-full department: An estimated 244
million TV-owning U.S. residents were doing something else when ABC
presented the show's namesake popping the question to his blushing
made-for-TV betrothed.</LD>
<TE>   As for "The Osbournes," the 6.6 million viewers that MTV recorded
on Nov. 26 is certainly terrific by cable standards, but in the rush
to accentuate the positive in those ratings, most press accounts
ignored the fact that more than 97% of the population passed on
deciphering Ozzy's unique gibberish.</TE>
<TE>   According to Nielsen Media Research, the TV viewing pool consists
of 272 million people ages 2 and older (infants watch too, but until
they can say, "I want that," Madison Avenue doesn't care). On an
average night, 105 million are watching TV at any given moment.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, with channels catering to almost every taste,
the audience is diffused. As a result, although millions were glued
to the set during "The Bachelor" finale, in the aggregate, three
times as many viewed something else, whether it was NBC's "The West
Wing," "Benjamin Franklin" on PBS, ESPN's "SportsCenter," "The Andy
Griffith Show" on TV Land, "The Producers" on Bravo or "Jaws" for the
umpteenth time on TNT. And tens of millions more watched -- get this
-- nothing at all.This isn't to say that popular programs don't reach
huge numbers of people. In fact, network television remains highly
viable as a marketing medium, thanks to its still-unique ability to
amass millions of eyeballs at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, in an era of frenetic lifestyles and an ever-expanding
array of leisure options, popular culture is one of the few spheres
of such commonality. In that context, getting more than 25 million
people to agree on anything, as they do when tuning in "CSI: Crime
Scene Investigation" or "ER", is pretty remarkable and explains why
studios pay through the nose to advertise new movie releases each
Thursday night.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is that as connecting with the public grows more
challenging, newspapers, magazines and other media outlets have a
tendency to get caught up in the promotional hype and feed
perceptions that such programs are more widely viewed than they truly
are.</TE>
<TE>   Too often lost amid such gee-whiz coverage, meanwhile, is any
perspective that even the most-watched series -- "CSI" and "Friends"
-- currently reach only about a tenth of the audience each week, and
that such critical darlings as "The Sopranos" -- although the subject
of cocktail chatter when the media elites gather in New York and L.A.
-- attract considerably fewer.</TE>
<TE>   For that matter, less than a third of U.S. viewers drop in during
the Academy Awards, with not quite one in six (about 42 million)
watching last year's ceremony at any given moment. The Super Bowl, in
essence our national day of media gluttony, is the most singular
exception to this fragmentation, with nearly half the population
tuning in for at least part of the telecast.</TE>
<TE>   Such ratings for big events and hit series are nothing to sneeze
at, but other than the Super Bowl, it's all a far cry from the days
when people had a better than one-in-three chance that their office
mates had seen "The Cosby Show" or "Gunsmoke" the night before.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, America's relationship with television itself has
changed dramatically over the years. In the early 1950s, when more
than 60% of TV owners viewed "I Love Lucy" or Milton Berle on "Texaco
Star Theater," less than half the population owned a TV set. Since
1980, 98% of U.S. homes have had a TV, and most now possess two or
three -- some larger than a screen at the local multiplex.</TE>
<TE>   Because TV is so ubiquitous, it's tempting to ascribe larger
significance to its most popular offerings or, rather absurdly, use
such fabricated events as "The Bachelor" or "Survivor" to launch
serious discussions of sexual or office politics -- a plausible
notion, I would suggest, only if being isolated with two dozen
fame-seeking former beauty queens and cheerleaders suddenly becomes a
widespread phenomenon.</TE>
<TE>   For those left cold by such analysis, then, it's surely comforting
to step back and note that most people resist the "nonstop media
hype," as even an MTV executive acknowledged, for something like "The
Osbournes."</TE>
<TE>   Who knew? Despite the media drumbeat for such programs as
"American Idol" and "The Bachelor," you can be un-hip, not with the
in crowd, not know a single contestant's name ... and actually be
more in step than any People magazine-devouring trend-chaser.</TE>
<TE>   If this amounts to little more than a brief reality check,
consider it an overdue one -- not just on behalf of those who see the
parade of "reality" shows as a blight on humanity, but for everyone
who, if asked about those shows around the water cooler, would
respond with a blank stare.</TE>

<HD>The reanimators</HD>
<DH>A fable that animation-effects ace Ray Harryhausen dropped
decades ago comes to life with the help of two fans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael Mallory</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The slow but steady Tortoise has finally crossed the finish line --
and it only took 50 years.</LD>
<LD>   The stop-motion animated fable "The Tortoise and the Hare" is the
last of six fairy-tale shorts in a project begun after World War II
by animation-effects wizard Ray Harryhausen, best known for his work
in 1950s and '60s fantasy classics such as "The 7th Voyage of Sinbad"
and "Jason and the Argonauts."</LD>
<LD>   The 12-minute film, which Harryhausen started in his garage in Los
Angeles in 1952, wrapped in July, with North Hollywood animators
Seamus Walsh and Mark Caballero completing the work under
Harryhausen's direction.</LD>
<TE>   The American Cinematheque will officially unveil the film Thursday
evening at the Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood as part of its
Harryhausen tribute.</TE>
<TE>   Why did it take so long to complete? "I shot about four minutes of
it, and then I got a call to do a feature film, which was much more
financially lucrative," says Harryhausen, who now lives in London but
flew in for the cinematheque event. "Then another feature came along,
and another one, so I never actually finished it."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, he had all but forgotten about the short until filmmaker
Richard Jones, who had directed the 1986 Harryhausen documentary
"Aliens, Dragons, Monsters and Me," raised the question of finishing
it. "We talked about maybe wanting to finish it up around 1989,"
Jones says. "It was a slow process of putting it all together."</TE>
<TE>   Having floated the idea for nearly a decade, Jones came upon Walsh
and Caballero, both then in their late 20s, who had done two previous
stop-motion shorts. After a series of tests, the two were given the
go-ahead to finish the film.</TE>
<TE>   "I loved their enthusiasm, which I thought was half the battle,"
Harryhausen says.</TE>
<TE>   Like virtually everyone else in the animation and effects
industries, Walsh and Caballero regarded Harryhausen as a cinema
icon, which meant the opportunity of working with him offered both
joy and trepidation. "The most nerve-racking part was knowing that
you were going to do footage that was going to be cut up against
Ray's footage," Walsh says. "That would be a daunting prospect for
any animator."</TE>
<TE>   Because none of the original tabletop sets had survived, the duo
fashioned new ones in Walsh's garage studio, based on existing
footage and Harryhausen's designs. They even traveled to the Mojave
Desert to find the same tiny blossoms that Harryhausen had found 50
years earlier to decorate the woods set.</TE>
<TE>   What Harryhausen still had were the original foam rubber and cloth
puppets of the film's Hare and Fox characters, which were built over
movable metal armatures and required only slight refurbishing. The
same was true for each character's dozen or so interchangeable
plaster heads, all bearing different expressions. The body of the
Tortoise, however, had to be reconstructed with a newly sculpted
shell by Harryhausen over a metal armature built by Robin Walsh,
Seamus' wife.</TE>
<TE>   Production to complete "The Tortoise and the Hare" began in 2000,
with Walsh and Caballero continually referring to Harryhausen's
earlier works to try to match his animation style. "Ray is the master
of really strong poses and great staging and framing," Caballero
says. "At first we were a little timid, and Ray told us to be
broader. He had us study a lot of Laurel and Hardy and Hal Roach
comedies."</TE>
<TE>   "We were always second-guessing ourselves," Walsh adds, asking,
"Would Ray like this?"</TE>
<TE>   Throughout much of the 1 1/2-year production period, footage and
images were shuttled between L.A. and London by mail and fax,
although Harryhausen periodically came stateside to supervise in
person. He even stepped into the garage to animate a few new shots
himself -- his first animation work since 1981's "Clash of the
Titans" -- although any attempt to discover who animated what shots
prompts the jovial 82-year-old to intone, with perfect Oliver Hardy
delivery: "I have nothing to say."</TE>
<TE>   Harryhausen confirms he is "more than pleased" with the result,
which features newly recorded narration by Gary Owens, a carefully
researched vintage music score and some digital tweaking to conform
the look of the old and new footage (the work was donated by IO Film
in North Hollywood, whose owners are Harryhausen fans).</TE>
<TE>   "It's a thrill to see it," Harryhausen says, beaming. "I always
loathed having anything unfinished."</TE>

<HD>Will each get a slice of Puck's pizza empire?</HD>
<DH>As the famed chef and wife Barbara Lazaroff break up, the
status of the business is in limbo.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Corie Brown and Mimi Avins</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After months, if not years of rumors, the power couple behind the
Puck restaurant empire are splitting up. While it's no surprise to
friends and those in the food world, it leaves the future of their
international group of restaurants and other businesses in limbo.</LD>
<LD>   Citing "irreconcilable differences," Barbara Lazaroff filed for
divorce from her husband of 19 years, Wolfgang Puck, the day before
Thanksgiving. The couple separated Nov. 16, according to court
papers.</LD>
<LD>   "It's an emotional thing," said Piero Selvaggio, owner of
Valentino in Santa Monica and a longtime intimate of the couple. "I'm
saddened, but I thank God they are both strong and professional."</LD>
<TE>   Considered one of the original celebrity chefs, Puck, 53, launched
an empire based on a casually chic style of California cuisine and
the popularity of the wood-fired pizza he introduced at the original
Spago restaurant in West Hollywood in 1982. But Lazaroff, 48, was
responsible for the eye-catching design of many of the couple's
eateries, and it was her ambition, her sense of style and her flair
for showmanship that helped push Puck out of the kitchen, into
stardom on the charity circuit, in supermarkets and, ultimately, in
television, radio, and in a series of cookbooks.</TE>
<TE>   Their multimillion-dollar food empire now includes 34 cafes and
airport pizza parlors, as well as a group of tony, celebrity-friendly
restaurants modeled after the original Spago and Puck's Santa
Monica-based Chinois on Main. Those two restaurants are among the
most admired and successful in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Together, Puck and Lazaroff have built an international food
empire that "the divorce shouldn't affect at all," Selvaggio said.
"They will still be business partners. They won't make the business
suffer.... If nothing else, they will make sure the kids are not at
all hurt by this, reason alone to make this whole thing civilized,
appropriate."</TE>
<TE>   Puck and Lazaroff were unavailable for comment, but their
spokesman, David Beckwith, called the divorce "amicable" and a
"personal matter" that would not affect the couple's business
partnership.</TE>
<TE>   However, documents filed in Los Angeles Superior Court on Nov. 27
show that future is somewhat less clear. And there are hints that the
split may be less than amicable.</TE>
<TE>   The details of how the couple plan to divide their assets,
property and obligations won't be clear until a still unscheduled
hearing. Lazaroff has petitioned the court to order Puck to pay her
spousal support and cover her legal fees. She also petitioned to
retain physical custody of their two sons, 8 and 13.</TE>
<TE>   Puck is on a nationwide book tour for his recently released "Live,
Love, Eat! The Best of Wolfgang Puck."</TE>
<TE>   The couple married Sept. 1, 1983, 10 years after Puck moved to the
U.S. from his native Austria.</TE>
<TE>   A classically trained chef, Puck started out in the kitchens of
the Hotel de Paris in Monaco and Maxim's in Paris before moving to
Los Angeles in 1975 where he became both chef and, he says, part
owner of Ma Maison. Puck published his first cookbook, "Modern French
Cooking for the American Kitchen" in 1981 and, together with Lazaroff
as his designer, opened Spago on the Sunset Strip the next year.</TE>
<TE>   "Wolfgang was the talent, the image," said Selvaggio. "Barbara was
the motivator when it was started, but that was only for 20 minutes.
It has grown way beyond that."</TE>
<TE>   .</TE>
<TE>   Puck launched his line of frozen food in 1987, through the
Wolfgang Puck Food Co., offering frozen desserts and quickly
expanding into frozen pizzas.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, Puck began manufacturing and marketing a line of cookware
and other cooking-oriented consumer products.</TE>
<TE>   A TV show featuring Puck for the Food Network premiered in 2001 in
addition to his regular appearances on ABC's "Good Morning America."</TE>
<TE>   The couple's dispositions are famously opposite. "I'm not a guy
who likes conflict," Puck said recently. "Barbara thrives on it."</TE>
<TE>   In interviews, Lazaroff has acknowledged that her hard charging
drive rubbed some people the wrong way.</TE>
<TE>   "Have I been difficult sometimes? Absolutely," she said. "Has
Wolfgang? Absolutely. The difference between the two of us is I was
willing to show it, and he'd do it covertly. I think one of the
reasons I have a reputation for being difficult is I have standards
of excellence."</TE>
<TE>   Puck added, "I'm attracted to Barbara's toughness. I can't be the
way she is, but sometimes I'd like to be."</TE>
<TE>   "Barbara taught me to enjoy the money I made," he said,
acknowledging that they had fought over money. "She's so headstrong,
it feels like whatever I told her, she wanted to do the opposite."</TE>

<LD>R&amp;B star R. Kelly will return to the music scene in mid-January with
the release of his new album, "Chocolate Factory," his first major
project since his June indictment on felony child pornography charges
in his hometown of Chicago.</LD>
<LD>   Kelly had been slated to release an album titled "Loveland" in
November, but that collection has been shelved. Officials with Jive
Records, the singer's label, cited the widespread downloading of the
music as undermining the release, but sources close to the Kelly camp
say that some of the "Loveland" themes and lyrics would present
awkward connotations in the context of the singer's legal situation.</LD>
<LD>   Kelly is expected to go on trial in the summer and could face 15
years in prison if convicted.</LD>

<LD>When the Sundance Film Festival announces its lineup, it's always
interesting to see who emerges as the indie queen of the moment. Lili
Palmer, Parker Posey and Christina Ricci have rotated as the girls
most likely, but this year the honor goes to Patricia Clarkson, who
has roles in at least five festival selections.</LD>
<LD>   Currently in theaters in "Far From Heaven" as the crisply snide
confidante to Julianne Moore (also a past Sundance fave), Clarkson
appears in Sundance dramatic entrants "All the Real Girls," "Pieces
of April" and "The Station Agent" and world cinema selections "Bend
It Like Beckham" and "Baroness and the Pig."</LD>
<LD>   Is there an Oscar in the cards? Not likely, but Hilary Swank, the
star of 1999 Sundance entry "Boys Don't Cry," did go on to win best
actress.</LD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For more than 20 years, William Styron's "Sophie's Choice" has been
praised as a novelist's worthy dramatization of human cruelty and
criticized as a gentile's limited view of the Holocaust.</LD>
<LD>   Now, the 77-year-old Styron has received a prize he hopes will
justify the novel to all readers. On Tuesday night, the Auschwitz
Jewish Center Foundation was to give the author its third annual
Witness to Justice Award.</LD>
<LD>   "This award sort of clears the air for me," he said in an
interview. "It is a kind of solid validation for me of what I tried
to do as a novelist."</LD>
<TE>   Published in 1979, "Sophie's Choice" is the story of a young
Southern writer who befriends a Catholic survivor of the Nazi
occupation of Poland. The book features extensive flashbacks to
Sophie's horrifying war experiences.</TE>
<TE>   It won the National Book Award and later was adapted into a movie,
with Meryl Streep winning an Academy Award.</TE>

<LD>Fans of feisty, freckle-faced heroine Pippi Longstocking have
received an unexpected Christmas present with the discovery of a
forgotten story by the late Astrid Lindgren, the author's publisher
said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The story, called "Pippi Longstocking Celebrates Christmas," was
discovered by a staff member at Sweden's Royal Library who was going
through old pictures and correspondence of the author, who died in
January at 94.</LD>
<LD>   A spokesman for Lindgren's publisher, Raben &amp; Sjogren, said the
story, which appeared in a children's magazine in 1949, would be
published next Christmas.</LD>

<HD>Kissinger kiss-up: Media not doing their job</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM RUTTEN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Winston Churchill once described the pre-war Germans as people "who
are either at your throat or at your feet." That's also a pretty apt
description of the American media, at least when it comes to a
certain kind of intellectual celebrity. And when that celeb is Henry
Kissinger, most of the U.S. press definitely has bruised elbows and
knees.</LD>
<LD>   Objections to the former secretary of State's appointment to head
the official inquiry into whether intelligence failures contributed
to the Sept. 11 disasters have been quietly -- even respectfully --
raised on various editorial pages.</LD>
<LD>   The Times, for example, quickly opposed the choice President Bush
announced rather cannily on Thanksgiving eve, when half the country
was on the road and the other half in the kitchen. This week, the New
York Times criticized Kissinger's refusal to give up his lucrative
international consulting business or to reveal the identity of its
clients, which are thought to include both Mideastern governments and
U.S. corporations doing business with them.</LD>
<TE>   What is conspicuously missing, however, are the analytic profiles
and investigative news reports concerning a factual record that is
almost perversely dissonant with the responsibilities now laid upon
him.</TE>
<TE>   Kissinger, after all, is a man whose entire record of public
service is studded with attempts to suppress information about the
conduct of government and to deceive the American people and their
elected representatives.</TE>
<TE>   Where, for example, are the stories about how, as Richard Nixon's
national security advisor, he sought and encouraged the
extra-constitutional wiretapping of government employees, journalists
and academics?</TE>
<TE>   Where are the accounts of how Kissinger lied to Congress about the
secret bombings of Cambodia and Laos, of how he deceived Sen. Frank
Church's committee about U.S. intelligence abuses, including the
overthrow of Chile's democratically elected government? (The latter,
it is worth recalling, involved acquiescence to Gen. Augusto
Pinochet's international terror network, whose kidnappings and
assassinations included a car bombing in Washington, D.C.) The answer
seems to be that the memory of all this has been laundered from
respectable media attention by Kissinger's carefully cultivated
social and professional relationships with taste-making journalists
like Ted Koppel, Jim Lehrer and Tina Brown, who recently lionized the
ex-diplomat in one of her famously acerbic columns for the Times of
London. At least that's the view of Christopher Hitchens, who within
hours of Kissinger's appointment published a damning outline of his
record in a column for the online magazine Slate.</TE>
<TE>   Hitchens, who also is the author of a book, "The Trial of Henry
Kissinger" (Verso Books, 2001), which controversially alleges that
Kissinger should be prosecuted for crimes against humanity, points to
the way in which the onetime Nixon aide's rather thin academic
credentials and Mitteleuropean gravity have combined to make him a
hyper-respectable uber-professorial presence on programs like ABC's
"Nightline" and PBS' "News Hour."</TE>
<TE>   Kissinger's "biggest coup in life," said Hitchens, "is getting
people like Koppel and Lehrer to treat him like an impartial expert
and to call him 'doctor' on the air." (Kissinger has a doctorate and
taught at Harvard before his government service.)</TE>
<TE>   "If everyone in America with a degree like his was called
'doctor,' it would be like Heidelberg under Bismarck," said Hitchens.
"The fact is he was a mediocre academic with the ability to express
his views in a German accent, and if that impressed people in the
Oval Office, perhaps it's no wonder it also works in newsrooms.</TE>
<TE>   "However, when the Ted Koppels of the world bestow their
imprimatur on him, it's not like the approval conferred by one of
these rat-bag fruit bats on Fox Television. This seeps through the
media culture. And when reputation leads the media simply to accept
someone at face value, as it has now done with Kissinger, the
elementary work of journalism just doesn't get done."</TE>
<TE>   A small but telling taste of Kissinger's respect for the
historical record can be gleaned from a passage in his 1982 memoirs
in which he describes a campaign to "sabotage legitimate and
considered policies by tendentious leaks of classified information in
the middle of a war.... The issue became particularly acute in June
1971 when 7,000 pages of confidential files on Indochina from the
Kennedy and Johnson presidencies -- the so-called Pentagon Papers --
were leaked to the press. None of these documents were embarrassing
to the Nixon administration. They could have been used to support the
proposition that we inherited a mess, and some in the Nixon White
House urged that we exploit them in this way...."</TE>
<TE>   It is a typical Kissinger historical passage, omitting a key fact
and obscuring another -- both to his benefit. As the verbatim
transcript of one of the infamous White House tapes -- WHT-5, to be
precise -- shows, Kissinger phoned Nixon from California on June 13,
1971, to discuss, among other things, the New York Times' publication
of material from the Pentagon Papers.</TE>
<TE>   On the tape, the president and his national security advisor
agreed that "treason" had been committed by the leaker and that the
paper's publication of the material was "unconscionable." And though
he does not mention it in his memoirs, it was Kissinger who first
suggested the legal action that ultimately lead to the U.S. Supreme
Court and one of the 20th century's most consequential victories for
the 1st Amendment in the Pentagon Papers case:</TE>
<TE>   Nixon: ... [T]his is treasonable action on the part of the
bastards that put it out.</TE>
<TE>   Kissinger: Exactly, Mr. President.</TE>
<TE>   Nixon: Doesn't it involve secure information, a lot of other
things? What kind of -- what kind of people would do such things?</TE>
<TE>   Kissinger: [Unclear] It has the most -- it has the highest
classification [unclear].</TE>
<TE>   Nixon: Yeah, yeah.</TE>
<TE>   Kissinger: It's -- it's treasonable, there's no question -- it's
actionable, I'm absolutely certain that this violates all sorts of
security laws.</TE>
<TE>   Nixon: What -- what do we do about it -- don't we ask for an....</TE>
<TE>   Kissinger: I think I -- I [unclear -- shall? should?] talk to
[Atty. Gen. John] Mitchell.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, as the transcript also shows, Kissinger was foremost
among those within the White House pushing for partisan exploitation
of the leaked documents:</TE>
<TE>   Kissinger: In public opinion, it actually, if anything will help
us a little bit, because this is a goldmine of showing how the
previous administration got us in there.</TE>
<TE>   Nixon: I didn't read the thing -- [unclear] give me your view on
that -- in, in a word....</TE>
<TE>   Kissinger: It just shows massive mismanagement of how we got
there, and it [unclear] pins it all on Kennedy and Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   None of this material is hard to find. It all has been published
or is in the public domain. The lack of reportorial attention to
Kissinger's record can be ascribed to two things: the media's short
attention span and the sort of instincts that make sheep so easy to
handle.</TE>

<LD>"I hope it's not lost. That was my favorite dreidel." Simon sounds
sad.</LD>
<LD>   "If we get enough Hanukkah gelt, we can buy another," I hear Joey
say. That makes me feel very sad. Will I have to stay here until
spring? Their voices are getting farther away.</LD>
<LD>   "Simon! Joey!" I hear the mom calling. "Get back in here. The sun
is down and it's time to light the Hanukkah candle."</LD>
<TE>   "But Mom," Simon pleads, "we can't find my dreidel."</TE>
<TE>   "So you'll go looking for it in the morning. It's getting too dark
now."</TE>
<TE>   I hear their footsteps going away. I hear the door slam. Now I'm
all alone.</TE>
<TE>   I see headlights coming toward me. A big truck drives swiftly by.
The air current picks me up and spins me on my way. The sun is gone.
I'm a little frightened. I've never been outside after dark.</TE>
<TE>   While I'm still spinning, a creepy white dog picks me up and
carries me in his wet slobbery mouth. This is terrible, not like my
nice warm wooden box.</TE>
<TE>   Then he drops me close to a little boy sitting on the steps of his
porch. The boy looks cold and pitiful, like he's ready to cry. He's
the same size as Joey, but his shoes are worn and scuffed, not
polished like Joey's.</TE>
<TE>   In the window, I can see a menorah with the first candle
sputtering as it burns down. I wonder, how can anyone be sad at
Hanukkah?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Thursday: Will David Dreidel be able to make this sad little boy
happy?</TE>
<TE>   Author's note: A dreidel is a four-sided top used in a game played
during the Jewish festival of Hanukkah. Each side has a different
Hebrew letter. A shin means give or put in a token. A hey means take
half the tokens. A gimel stands for take all the tokens. A nun means
take nothing. Before each spin of the dreidel, players put a
designated number of tokens in the middle. The first player spins the
dreidel. When the dreidel stops, the letter facing up determines what
the player puts in or takes out.</TE>

<HD>A treasure trove of papers signed yours truly, Lang</HD>
<DH>The Huntington lands an Altadena family's cache of Langston
Hughes material.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Renee Tawa</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For 30 years, Altadena resident Edward Miller, a 57-year-old retired
court reporter, had tucked away his late father's files on a family
friend, papers that included handwritten notes signed "Lang."
Finally, at the suggestion of his wife, Miller pulled the old
briefcase full of files from the closet and took it to the Huntington
Library in San Marino.</LD>
<LD>   Sue Hodson, curator of literary manuscripts, took one look and got
goose bumps. The Millers had a small but rich cache of letters,
manuscripts and other material by Langston Hughes, one of the 20th
century's most beloved and important African American voices.</LD>
<LD>   At a time of resurging interest in the poet and writer, who died
in 1967, the Huntington recently acquired the "phenomenal little
collection" from the Millers for an undisclosed price, Hodson said.</LD>
<LD>   The 40-piece collection includes Hughes' pocket diary from an
overseas trip in 1932 and a two-page undated poem, written in pencil
on frayed newsprint with marked-out corrections. (When Hodson first
saw the Millers' material, she politely offered the couple acid-free
archival folders.)</LD>
<TE>   The size of the Huntington cache pales in comparison to the Hughes
archive at Yale University's Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript
Library, which has 14,000 folders of material, the largest trove of
the poet's memorabilia anywhere. But Hughes scholars, none of whom
had known about the Millers' collection or examined it, noted that
even small collections can yield a gem, such as a revealing letter or
draft of a manuscript.</TE>
<TE>   "Any acquisition like that is significant," said Arnold Rampersad,
author of the definitive two-volume biography "The Life of Langston
Hughes" (Oxford University Press; 1986, 1988).</TE>
<TE>   Any opportunity to review previously unknown or lost material by
major writers -- and the tantalizing prospect of turning up an
important letter or diary entry -- sends ripples of excitement
through the literary world. The most spectacular discoveries can lead
to novels or other works by long-deceased writers.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, for example, UC Berkeley researchers edited a new
edition of the "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" (University of
California Press), relying partly on the long-missing first half of
Mark Twain's handwritten manuscript, which was found in the attic of
a Hollywood librarian in 1990. The new edition compares Twain's
drafts, notebooks and final copy to show how the characters and
narrative evolved.</TE>
<TE>   And Ralph Ellison's literary executor, John F. Callahan,
discovered a batch of unpublished stories in the late writer's
apartment that were published in a 1996 collection, "Flying Home and
Other Stories" (Vintage).</TE>
<TE>   Until Hughes experts review the Huntington's cache, it's hard to
say how significant the material is, though Hodson said it "contains
very important literary and biographical material for Hughes."
Independent literary appraiser Robert Allen, who reviewed the
Huntington's acquisition, called the Hughes papers "an exciting and
historically telling archive" and said the 1932 pocket diary was "the
crowning piece.... This small but substance-heavy notebook, hitherto
unknown to scholars and students, epitomized Langston Hughes' vivid
passion for social justice."</TE>
<TE>   Experts said they are excited simply by the prospect of analyzing
fresh material that, they say, could inspire a new generation of
scholars to study the poet. Scholars are interested particularly in
material from the 1930s, a decade in Hughes' life that is relatively
undocumented, and his ties to California intellectuals, including
Edward Miller's prominent father, former Los Angeles Municipal Court
Judge Loren Miller, who was the poet's West Coast attorney and agent.</TE>
<TE>   The bulk of the Huntington's material is from 1932 to 1934, a time
when Hughes, who already was leaning to the left, became even more
politically charged. "That period for me, the 1930s, are some of the
more interesting years for what Hughes was doing," said Christopher
C. De Santis, an associate professor at Illinois State University and
author of "The Collected Works of Langston Hughes, Volume 10: Fight
for Freedom and Other Writings on Civil Rights" (University of
Missouri Press, 2001). "He wrote so much during the 1930s that was
extremely passionate and extremely committed to the working classes."</TE>
<TE>   During that period, Hughes traveled to several countries,
including the Soviet Union, where he was accompanied by Loren Miller
and other African Americans. His travel inspired some of his most
radical writing, leading, in 1953, to his appearance before Sen.
Joseph McCarthy's subcommittee on political subversives, when he was
forced to defend his politics.</TE>
<TE>   Rampersad, a Stanford University professor, had not known of the
existence of the handwritten diary that Hughes kept while traveling
in China and Japan in his early 30s. In the diary, Hughes recorded
the same details of child labor conditions in Shanghai that he wrote
of in the second volume of his autobiography, "I Wonder as I Wander,"
published in 1956. "That's an [academic] article right there,"
Rampersad said of the diary. "Something like that is very valuable."</TE>
<TE>   Hughes' down-to-earth writing style was not always appreciated by
literary critics of the day. But he still is known for poems such as
"Mother to Son," "The Negro Speaks of Rivers" and other works that
are lyrical and accessible, infused with the voice and rhythm of
jazz. His fans range from rappers to readers of the Academy of
American Poets' Web site who, in 2001, voted him America's favorite
poet.</TE>
<TE>   This year, Hughes has been feted in centennial celebrations
nationwide, marking his birth in 1902. In February, the U.S. Postal
Service issued a Langston Hughes stamp and, in 2001, the University
of Missouri Press began publishing 17 volumes of his collected works,
including novels, short stories, essays and plays on politics, social
justice and African American culture.</TE>
<TE>   Edward Miller's family knew the private side of Hughes, who in the
'20s emerged as a leading figure in the Harlem Renaissance's
flourishing artistic scene. In the early '30s, Hughes, who lived on
and off in San Francisco and Carmel, occasionally visited Southern
California. On those trips, he would drop by to see Edward Miller's
parents in Silver Lake, at their two-story stucco house that was
surrounded by pomegranate, plum and avocado trees.</TE>
<TE>   Before he became a judge, Loren Miller was an attorney who took on
major civil rights cases, filing briefs, for instance, in the Brown
vs. Board of Education school desegregation case alongside his
friend, Thurgood Marshall.</TE>
<TE>   Edward Miller, a small boy at the time of Hughes' visits, doesn't
recall much about the poet. But his 70-year-old cousin, attorney
Halvor Thomas Miller Jr., remembers having to stand in front of
Hughes and recite the writer's poetry. "He was kind of a soft person,
very pleasant, thoughtful ... happy," Halvor Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes often brought along signed copies of his books, the sort of
memento that Edward Miller expected to find in his parents'
belongings after the deaths of his father in 1967 and his mother
three years later. But when Miller sifted through his father's files,
he got a surprise. He had no idea that his father had so many files
on Hughes.</TE>
<TE>   For years, he and his wife, Angela Miller, stored the papers,
showing the collection to few people outside the family.
Occasionally, their two children, Brandon, 15, and Noelle, 13, would
bring Hughes' letters to school for book reports.</TE>
<TE>   About two years ago, after Edward became concerned about the
condition of the Hughes papers, Angela began contacting institutions
to see if there would be interest in acquiring the cache. The Millers
wanted to keep the collection together and on the West Coast, where
their family and their descendants could get to the papers easily.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no doubt we know how amazing the material was and
is," said Angela, 47, a special education assistant. "This is a good
time to put it where people can see it."</TE>
<TE>   After the Millers met with Hodson, they worked with a literary
appraiser she recommended to organize and catalog the papers. By the
time they got back to Hodson, her budget had been frozen in the
aftermath of Sept. 11, and the deal stalled until this summer, when
the acquisition was finalized.</TE>
<TE>   Edward Miller said it wasn't hard to pass the cache on to a place
like the Huntington. "Actually, it was kind of a load off my
shoulders to have it in an institution where it would be well
preserved and taken care of, and the paper wouldn't break down and
fall apart," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Miller had been touched when he discovered the
correspondence between Hughes and his father, letters that revealed
the depth of their friendship. "I was kind of thrilled," he said. "It
made it very personal."</TE>
<TE>   In March 1933, for instance, Hughes, who never married, wrote to
Loren Miller from Moscow after hearing of his engagement. (Edward
Miller's mother, Juanita Miller, later was director of state social
welfare for Los Angeles County.) The note is typed with dark letters,
made with firm keystrokes: "Dear Loren, You lucky guy -- marrying a
grand girl like Juanita ... Jesus, I'm glad.... Getting married to
someone you love ought to be a much better thing than writing novels
or seeing the world -- or making revolutions.... And write me about
your house.... Is it an apartment or bungalow or what? And is there a
backyard and a porch swing? And what's the street like? Palm trees or
elms?"</TE>
<TE>   At the Huntington, the Hughes collection is expected to have huge
public appeal, Hodson noted. Four items are on display in the
library's main exhibition hall through Jan. 1, including a couple of
letters from Hughes to Loren Miller. (Yale's Beinecke library has 10
letters from Miller to Hughes, but no copies of any letters Hughes
wrote to his Los Angeles friend, according to the collection's
archivist, Tim Young.)</TE>
<TE>   In one of the letters on display, dated Aug. 21, 1930, Hughes
thanked Miller for praising his just-published first novel, "Not
Without Laughter," and expressed his frustration with racial
stereotypes: "Dear Loren, Thanks for your swell letter about the
book. There are a lot of things wrong with it but I learned a great
deal writing it, so maybe the next one will be better. I hope so....
I wish I, or somebody, could write a novel in which each character
wouldn't be taken as a 'type-class' character; that there'd be some
way of keeping them from being considered as representatives of the
whole race or any one section of the race. For Christ's sake, can't
Negroes, even in books, be just individuals -- if they want to be?"</TE>
<TE>   University of Georgia English professor R. Baxter Miller -- no
relation to the Millers in Altadena -- said he is interested in
exploring Hughes' ties to African American intellectuals in the
Berkeley area and Los Angeles. Hughes' adult life in areas including
Harlem and Chicago has been well explored, but little has been
written about his time in California, said professor Miller,
executive editor of an academic journal, the Langston Hughes Review.
A book on "Langston Hughes and California doesn't exist in print," he
said. "That's something that's major and unexplored and worth coming
out there to take a look."</TE>
<TE>   The cache also includes two letters from Si-lan "Sylvia" Chen
Leyda, who, according to the second volume of Hughes' autobiography,
"I Wonder as I Wander," was "the girl I was in love with that winter"
he spent in Moscow in 1932-33. After his death, though, rumors
persisted that Hughes was gay. In his biography, Rampersad wrote: "I
have concluded that he might have been asexual -- but I also think
that we will probably never know the truth."</TE>
<TE>   Also of possible interest is the two-page poem, "Wise Men,"
written in Hughes' hand and attributed to "Kid Turner," a name that
is not immediately identifiable and doesn't turn up in the Beinecke
library files. The poem, which is a rallying cry of sorts to the
young, does not appear in definitive works such as "The Collected
Poems of Langston Hughes" (Knopf, 1994), edited by Rampersad. (The
volume, which gathers all 868 of Hughes' published poems, includes a
piece called "Wise Men" that is completely different from the one in
the Huntington's collection.)</TE>
<TE>   Rampersad said he did not recognize the handwritten poem when he
read the opening lines. The poem includes a correction in Hughes'
hand, substituting the word "servants" for "negroes," seeming to give
it a more political tone.</TE>
<TE>   The Huntington also considers the Hughes material to be a major
addition to its expanding collection of papers by 20th century
African American arts figures -- particularly those with local ties
-- including the papers of local playwright Velina Hasu Houston and
photographs and other memorabilia from the First Negro Classic
Ballet, which was founded in Los Angeles in 1946.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Langston Hughes' 'Kid Turner' poem</TE>
<TE>   The Huntington Library in San Marino recently acquired a small
cache of Langston Hughes material that includes manuscripts, a pocket
diary and personal letters, mostly dating between 1932 and 1934.</TE>
<TE>   Among the writings in the collection is a two-page poem called
"Wise Men," which is written in Hughes' hand but attributed to a Kid
Turner. Scholars could not immediately explain who Turner was or why
Hughes attributed the poem to him. (The poem is not the same as
another published Hughes poem also called "Wise Men.") An excerpt:</TE>
<TE>   ... Come on, you young, make</TE>
<TE>   your banners fly!</TE>
<TE>   Shake your fists at a pious sky.</TE>
<TE>   Shout your slogans into</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>While the womenfolk are busy in the kitchen with the dinner dishes
tonight, the History Channel takes its "Boys' Toys" week of
programming on the road for back-to-back episodes aimed at pleasing
the household's more testosterone-laden inhabitants.</LD>
<LD>   "Convertibles," airing at 9, and "Limousines," following at 10,
fit snugly amid a week of carefully stereotyped "male" areas of
interest such as motorcycles, James Bond gadgets and high-tech
equipment. Perhaps the hunting and fishing episodes are being readied
for the next "Boys' Toys" week.</LD>
<LD>   The key word in tonight's new episodes is freedom -- the freedom
one feels when driving a car with nothing but sky above you, as well
as the freedom of just letting someone else do the driving. Both
shows explore the origins of the vehicles before moving on through
the trends that have shaped their development.</LD>
<TE>   "Limousines" gets the edge because of the interesting historical
tidbits tossed in along the way. From the tricked-out horse carriage
owned by Napoleon to the high-security Caddy built for President
Bush, which boasts features so exotic that they remain classified
information, it's a fun ride. And a look inside the largest
limo-conversion company in the world, Krystal Enterprises in Brea, is
a worthwhile detour.</TE>
<TE>   The charm of "Convertibles" lies more in the visuals, so much so
that you could almost watch the procession of classic Duesenbergs,
Packards and Thunderbirds with the sound off and still enjoy the
show.</TE>
<TE>   "Boys' Toys" week continues Thursday with premieres of "More
Gadgets" at 9 p.m. and "Digi-Tech" at 10 p.m., capped by an encore
airing of "Private Jets" on Friday at 9 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The History Channel does its usual solid job with all of them. You
might even invite any females in your house to take a peek.</TE>

<LD>Viewing levels took a dive as the November rating sweeps gave way to
the Thanksgiving weekend. That allowed CBS to stroll off with a
weekly victory thanks to "The Christmas Shoes," based on viewing
estimates issued Tuesday by Nielsen Media Research.</LD>
<LD>   CBS' ailing Sunday movie lurched to life with the Rob Lowe
Christmas film, which drew the biggest audience for a TV movie this
season. Indicating a healthy appetite for holiday fare, NBC also
posted respectable numbers Friday with "It's a Merry Muppet
Christmas," trouncing Fox's made-for-TV sequel "The Bradys in the
White House."</LD>
<LD>   Thursday didn't give ABC much to be thankful for, as its two-hour
premiere of "Dinotopia" drew the kind of audience that could easily
lead to extinction, especially given that the competition was mostly
reruns and specials.</LD>
<TE>   Fox's "Andy Richter Controls the Universe" also made an
unimpressive second-season debut, falling 30% off its "Malcolm in the
Middle" lead-in. So far, "The Simpsons" has been a pillar of strength
for Fox, but the rest of its Sunday all-comedy lineup is suspect.</TE>
<TE>   ABC's two-hour Paul McCartney special hit a flat note as well,
whereas the network's prime-time college football coverage --
splitting the USC-Notre Dame and Florida-Florida State games --
placed first Saturday. The USC game was the week's
second-most-watched program in the Los Angeles viewing area, while
the games ranked No. 36 nationally.</TE>

<HD>If the cineastes like it, it has a shot at Oscar</HD>
<DH>The National Board of Review kicks off the movie-award
season today with its picks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert W. Welkos</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sometime this morning in New York City, a group with a
bureaucratic-sounding title -- the National Board of Review of Motion
Pictures -- will unveil its annual list of top films, actors and
director, officially setting in motion Hollywood's months-long awards
season. The next couple of weeks will see L.A. and New York critics'
picks, as well as Golden Globe nominations, among numerous other
kudos, which reach their apex with the 75th annual Academy Awards on
March 23.</LD>
<LD>   Ask most passersby on the street whether they know what the
National Board of Review of Motion Pictures is, and chances are
they'll scratch their heads and give up. But in Tinseltown, this
rarefied group of about 150 East Coast cineastes that includes film
historians, educators, authors, retired film professionals and film
students is better known, and its choices are eagerly anticipated.</LD>
<LD>   Not only do the board's selections provide the first litmus test
of the Oscar worthiness of a year's worth of movies, but the honors
also give marketing departments a boost for their Oscar campaigns.</LD>
<TE>   "I've never seen anyone trying to ride a National Board of Review
award to the Oscar, but it is confirmation to your staff and the
filmmakers that this is a battle worth fighting," said James Schamus,
president of Focus Features. "For us, they provide a more level
playing field because people who choose these awards tend to be
people who really love movies and make decisions before gadzillions
of marketing dollars have kicked in" for Oscar campaigning.</TE>
<TE>   Last year at this time, no one was sure if director Baz Luhrmann's
expressionistic musical "Moulin Rouge" had what it took to be a
serious Oscar contender, given the fact that musicals were long
considered a dead movie genre. But the National Board of Review named
"Moulin Rouge" its best film of 2001, and 20th Century Fox, through
aggressive publicity and marketing, saw the film garner a fistful of
Oscar nominations, including best picture.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Halle Berry, who would capture the best actress Oscar
for her portrayal of a woman who falls in love with a prison guard
who oversaw her husband's execution in "Monster's Ball," saw her
chances improve when she was first named best actress by the Board of
Review.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the first small stone thrown in the pond," said Peter
Herbst, Premiere magazine's editor in chief. "It has ripples. People
begin to think about films. There may be films that maybe we haven't
been thinking about seriously. 'Auto Focus' or 'The Rookie' or
'Minority Report' or 'Spider-Man.' ... The Board of Review will
introduce a sleeper or two."</TE>
<TE>   Among the bigger films often mentioned this year as best picture
candidates are "Gangs of New York," "Chicago" and "The Hours," but
the Board of Review could just as easily pick a smaller film like
"Far From Heaven" or "Antwone Fisher."</TE>
<TE>   "There may be a film like 'About Schmidt,' which is a wonderful
film, but it requires commitment from the viewer," Herbst said. "What
they can do is take a film that we haven't been thinking about that
much and elevate it to award status."</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, the board has had an uneven record as an Oscar
prognosticator. In 2000, for example, it chose as best picture
"Quills," Fox Searchlight's outrageous exploration of the life and
philosophy of the notorious Marquis de Sade. For the Oscars, it
scored nominations in a few categories, but not for picture.
"Gladiator" won the Academy Award.</TE>
<TE>   Previously, the board had selected "American Beauty," "Gods and
Monsters" and "L.A. Confidential" as its top films. Only 1999's
"American Beauty" went on to win the best picture Oscar.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the board chose Billy Bob Thornton as best actor for a
trio of performances, including "Monster's Ball," but he wasn't even
nominated by the academy. The best actor Oscar went to Denzel
Washington for "Training Day."</TE>

<LD>Newhall Ranch--A story in Tuesday's California section inaccurately
stated that the developer of the Newhall Ranch project would purchase
1,600 acre-feet of nonpotable water from the Nickel Family LLC, a
private purveyor in Kern County, for residents of the proposed
development. In fact, the water would be potable, supplementing the
7,000 acre-feet of drinking water the developer now draws from its
own ground-water wells.</LD>

<LD>Report on Iraq -- A headline Tuesday in Section A ("Report on Iraqi
Abuses Is Met With Skepticism") implied that a British report
accusing Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's regime of systematic
executions, torture and other abuses was called into question. As was
stated in the subhead, human rights advocates questioned the timing
of the report, not the accusations themselves.</LD>

<LD>Movie audience demogra- phics -- A movie box office story in the Nov.
25 Calendar presented inaccurate figures about demographics of the
opening-weekend audience for the new James Bond movie, "Die Another
Day." Exit surveys showed that 69% of the audience was over 25, 31%
under 25, and that 53% was male, 47% female. The story mistakenly
said that nearly 55% of the audience consisted of males younger than
25, while 53% were females in the same age group.</LD>

<LD>Architectural photographs -- A story in Tuesday's Calendar about an
exhibition of architectural photographs of Grant Mudford omitted
information on the location and times of the show. Mudford's work is
on view through Jan. 4 at the Rosamund Felsen Gallery in Bergamot
Station, 2525 Michigan Ave., B4, Santa Monica. The gallery is open
Tuesday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. For information
and holiday schedule, call (310) 828-8488. In addition, in some
editions, one of Mudford's photos of Disney Hall under construction

<HD>AOL Unveils Web Strategy Amid Outlook of Sales Slump</HD>
<DH>Execs tell analysts to expect as much as a 50% online ad
revenue drop, but premium services should boost recovery.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Edmund Sanders</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>AOL Time Warner laid down its long-term recovery plan Tuesday for its
embattled Internet unit, but Wall Street appeared more worried about
the company's short-term financial slump.</LD>
<LD>   Shares in AOL Time Warner fell more than 14% after the New
York-based media giant announced advertising revenue at the America
Online division would drop as much as 50% next year to levels last
seen in 1998.</LD>
<LD>   "It looks like 2003 is going to be the bite-the-bullet year for
AOL," said Gordon Hodge, analyst at Thomas Weisel Partners.</LD>
<TE>   At an analyst conference in New York, AOL Time Warner Chief
Executive Richard D. Parsons promised that the unit would stabilize
next year and resume growth in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a wasting business," Parsons said, predicting that
America Online would once again become a growth engine for the parent
company.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street's reaction was disappointing to AOL executives, but
hardly surprising. For years, AOL boasted its advertising revenue as
a key reason for America Online's success. Now that ad sales are
slumping and government investigators are examining how AOL accounted
for some deals, the company is trying to retrain investors to focus
instead on other aspects, including new content deals and the
potential to sell customers premium services.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of AOL Time Warner closed Tuesday at $14.21, down $2.36 in
New York Stock Exchange trading.</TE>
<TE>   AOL warned that 2003 overall revenue for the online unit,
including subscriptions and advertising, would be flat and earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization -- a key
measure of the company's performance -- would fall next year by 15%
to 25%.</TE>
<TE>   The company said the drop in ad revenue, which could fall from an
estimated $1.5 billion-$1.6 billion this year to as low as $750
million in 2003, was due chiefly to the expiration of $500 million in
long-term ad contracts signed in the dot-com heyday.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's meeting was the first opportunity for new America Online
Chief Executive Jonathan Miller to lay out his three-pronged strategy
for getting the Internet unit back on track and restoring investor
confidence in the unit's potential.</TE>
<TE>   The plan focuses on beefing up the online service with features
and exclusive content provided by AOL Time Warner's entertainment
properties. The company confirmed that it will pay several of its
sister companies, including Time Inc. magazines, CNN and Warner Bros.
movie studio for the exclusive right to distribute articles, photos
and movie clips online.</TE>
<TE>   AOL also said it is abandoning head-to-head competition against
cable operators who offer high-speed access, an area where AOL has
seriously lagged. America Online offers broadband service, but at a
steeper cost than others.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the company said it will more aggressively market its
$14.95 bring-your-own-access plan, which would allow members to
retain e-mail accounts and access AOL content, even if they switch to
another provider. AOL's standard dial-up plan, including Internet
access, costs $23.90 a month.</TE>
<TE>   Miller predicted that cable companies would find the new strategy
less threatening, while freeing AOL from having to deal with the
costs, technical problems and customer-support issues involved in
offering an expanded access plan itself.</TE>
<TE>   It remains unclear whether AOL customers will find the AOL service
valuable enough to pay $14.95 on top of a separate high-speed ISP
bill, which can cost between $40 and $50.</TE>
<TE>   Though Miller admitted AOL had "missed the first wave of
broadband," he said the new strategy instantly gives America Online a
national footprint in the fast-growing market.</TE>
<TE>   Previously, AOL's broadband strategy was to buy high-speed access
from cable operators at wholesale prices and then repackage it under
the AOL brand. But cable operators were demanding stiff prices and
unattractive terms. Now the company plans to partner with cable
operators to offer AOL's content along with cable ISPs.</TE>
<TE>   Company officials said early results are promising. Currently
about 2 million of AOL's nearly 27-million U.S. subscribers buy the
AOL service in addition to purchasing high-speed access from another
provider. Another 650,000 buy the AOL-branded high-speed access plan.</TE>
<TE>   Miller said the rollout of premium services is key to America
Online's growth.</TE>
<TE>   By 2005, the company hopes 20% of its subscribers will buy one or
more of the services, ranging from AOL Call Alerts, a voicemail
service; to an anti-virus software protection to MusicNet, a
song-downloading service expected to launch next month.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Automobile Sales Fall 13% in Nov.</HD>
<DH>Despite the decline, the figure is up from October's
four-year low, a sign Americans still are willing to buy cars. Ford
cuts production.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Justin Hyde</AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Automakers said U.S. sales fell 13% in November from a booming month
a year ago, and an unexpected production cut by Ford Motor Co. on
Tuesday sent shares down across the industry.</LD>
<LD>   But despite the declines, November sales hit a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 16 million vehicles, up from October's four-year low
of 15.4 million and a sign that Americans still are willing to buy
cars and trucks.</LD>
<LD>   The drop was led by a 21% decline at Ford and a 19% decline at
General Motors Corp. DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler unit said sales fell
12% as the entire industry faced a tough comparison with a sales boom
last year sparked by no-interest loans.</LD>
<TE>   The declines for import automakers were less severe, driving the
monthly market share of Detroit's Big Three down to a record low
58.8%, excluding their foreign brands.</TE>
<TE>   "We anticipate that incentive activity will pick up in December as
[automakers] work to meet year-end market-share targets," Merrill
Lynch analyst John Casesa said. "It's likely that GM will further
turn up the incentive heat as the company hopes to gain share for the
year."</TE>
<TE>   Automakers have been fighting for buyers' attention with
incentives that averaged about $2,000 a vehicle in October. GM has
been aggressively pushing no-interest loans and a no payments for 90
days offer, a deal Chrysler has added as well. Ford allowed lease
customers to cancel their deals up to seven months early, as long as
they leased another Ford vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   The industry also may have been helped by some signs of recovery
in the U.S. economy last month.</TE>
<TE>   Inventories had been a growing concern for Wall Street, which had
worried that weak sales could leave Chrysler and Ford with too many
unsold vehicles by the end of the year, forcing them to cut
production.</TE>
<TE>   Ford said it cut its fourth-quarter vehicle production estimate
for North America by 25,000 vehicles, to 940,000 cars and trucks.</TE>
<TE>   With a few exceptions, other automakers reported less severe sales
declines in November. Toyota Motor Corp. said its sales fell 5%,
while Nissan Motor Co. saw sales fall 1.6% and Volkswagen said its
sales were down 20%.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been tough probably since August. I think it's going to
continue to be tough for the next couple of months," said Jed
Connelly, senior vice president of sales and marketing for Nissan
Motor Co. "I don't see any magic change in December."</TE>
<TE>   Honda Motor Co. broke with the trend, with sales up 4.6%.</TE>

<HD>California Insurer Urges Universal Health Coverage</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To avert an impending crisis, California must ensure that all its
residents have health insurance by requiring employers to contribute
and by imposing a broad-based tax, the chief executive of one of the
state's biggest insurers said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Bruce Bodaken, CEO of Blue Shield of California, which covers 2.3
million people, unveiled his plan in San Francisco.</LD>
<LD>   California's Medicaid program ranks last among states in spending
per enrolled patient, paying physicians less than half of what they
receive from private insurers.</LD>
<TE>   As a result, fewer than 50% of California's doctors participate,
Bodaken said. Adding to the state's woes, only 61% of employers offer
health insurance.</TE>
<TE>   Bodaken said universal health insurance could be achieved by
requiring employers to provide coverage or contribute toward an
essential benefits package. The state also should enroll every
eligible resident in its Medi-Cal or Healthy Families health plans.</TE>
<TE>   The state should require anyone who can afford insurance to buy it
and subsidize those who cannot, Bodaken said.</TE>
<TE>   California, in cooperation with independent health-care
professionals, should design and provide an essential benefits
package that would guarantee preventive care, physician services,
hospital care and prescription drugs, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The state should seek to save money by encouraging preventive care
and earlier treatment of the formerly uninsured and by cutting back
on the use of emergency rooms and ensuring that doctors are paid for
care provided to the uninsured, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the cost of the program would be paid for by imposing a
"modest, broad-based tax or fee," Bodaken said, without specifying
the type of tax.</TE>

<HD>High Court Rules Against Boating Industry in Propeller Case</HD>
<DH>Injured now can sue engine makers in state courts for
failing to install safety guards.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David G. Savage</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- In a surprising, unanimous defeat for the boating
industry, the Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that swimmers or boaters
who are injured in propeller accidents can sue the engine makers for
failing to install propeller guards.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling clears the way for the husband of an Illinois woman who
died in a boating accident to sue Mercury Marine, which makes motors
for recreational boats. The company is a division of Brunswick Corp.
of Lake Forest, Ill. The ruling also puts boat makers on notice that
they should consider adding propeller guards.</LD>
<LD>   In 1990, the Coast Guard studied the issue and decided against
requiring propeller guards on recreational boats. Federal authorities
said then that there was not a single design for a guard that would
suit the hundreds of boat models.</LD>
<TE>   Since then, the recreational boating industry has assumed that its
manufacturers could not be held liable for failing to put guards on
propellers.</TE>
<TE>   At least 447 recreational boaters were injured or killed in
propeller accidents between 1995 and 1998, federal officials said. A
study by the Johns Hopkins University Injury Prevention Center said
the "true number of propeller injuries and deaths" may be much
higher, as many as 3,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, judges had consistently thrown out lawsuits charging
the engine makers with selling a defective or dangerous product.</TE>
<TE>   But the Supreme Court reversed course Tuesday and ruled that
nothing in federal law shields engine makers from being sued in state
courts.</TE>
<TE>   Justice John Paul Stevens said the main purpose of the Federal
Boat Safety Act "emphasized by its title [is] promoting boat safety."
It should not be used to shield manufacturers from being forced to
take extra steps to save lives, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is quite wrong to view ... the Coast Guard's decision not to
adopt a regulation requiring propeller guards on motor boats as the
functional equivalent of a regulation prohibiting all states and
their political subdivisions from adopting such a regulation," he
said in Sprietsma vs. Mercury Marine.</TE>
<TE>   States, their courts and their juries remain free to hold engine
makers liable for not adopting reasonable measures, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling revives a lawsuit filed by Rex Sprietsma for the death
of his wife, Jeanne. On July 10, 1995, she was riding in an 18-foot
ski boat on a lake in Kentucky when she fell overboard and was killed
by the propeller.</TE>
<TE>   His lawsuit contended Mercury Marine's engine was unreasonably
dangerous because it lacked a propeller guard. However, judges in
Illinois tossed out his case.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we get our day in court," said Leslie Brueckner of the Trial
Lawyers for Public Justice, who represented Sprietsma. "It's a
stunning affirmance of the tort system."</TE>
<TE>   It is rare, however, for the high court to side unanimously with
trial lawyers and against manufacturers.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, the court on a 5-4 vote blocked automakers from
being sued for failing to install air bags on vehicles made before
1990. The justices also were closely split on whether federal law
shielded medical device makers and cigarette companies from being
sued in state courts.</TE>
<TE>   Bush administration lawyers may have played a key role in tipping
the case in favor of the plaintiffs. They filed a brief advising the
court that federal transportation officials and the Coast Guard did
not intend to prevent states from adopting more stringent standards
of boat safety.</TE>

<HD>Disney Abandons Hope for 'Treasure Planet'</HD>
<DH>It slashes $47 million off fourth-quarter earnings.
Meanwhile, it faces an SEC disclosure inquiry.</DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Walt Disney Co. said Tuesday that it lopped $47 million off its
previously reported fourth-quarter earnings after its latest film,
"Treasure Planet," failed to strike gold.</LD>
<LD>   Although the Space Age version of "Treasure Island" has been in
theaters only one weekend, Tuesday's announcement shows that Disney
already has written off any hope for the movie: It opened to
generally poor reviews and just $12.1 million at the box office, one
of the weakest openings ever for a Disney animated film.</LD>
<LD>   The disclosure came after Disney announced a series of lauded
reforms to its board, which has been criticized in the past as being
too passive. Those changes included a more stringent definition of
what constitutes an "independent" director, but one that also could
diminish the role of businessman Stanley P. Gold, a chief critic of
Disney Chief Executive Michael Eisner.</LD>
<TE>   Separately, the Burbank entertainment giant said it was
cooperating with a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into
whether it should have publicly revealed earlier than August that
four of its directors had relatives working for the company or its
affiliates.</TE>
<TE>   The "Treasure Planet" and SEC disclosures interrupt what had been
a string of good news for the long-beleaguered company, with the film
"The Santa Clause 2" performing well, the Anaheim Angels winning the
World Series, and progress in trying to fix lagging ratings at its
ABC network.</TE>
<TE>   Disney said it expects the pretax loss on "Treasure Planet" to
come to $74 million, all the more painful because Disney's animation
division was once the company's profit juggernaut, with such films as
"The Lion King," "Aladdin" and "Beauty and the Beast" earning
hundreds of millions of dollars each in the early 1990s. More
recently, Disney scored a hit with "Lilo &amp; Stitch."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a fairly substantial loss," said analyst Jeffrey Logsdon of
Gerard Klauer Mattison. He estimates that "Treasure Planet" cost $100
million to $120 million, excluding marketing expenses.</TE>
<TE>   The movie's release comes amid uncertainly over who may guide
Disney's bedrock animation division next year. Current chief Thomas
Schumacher will step down from the job in June, but is negotiating a
possible new role in the company's theatrical division.</TE>
<TE>   Disney announced the earnings adjustment, which came to 2 cents a
share, on the eve of disclosing them in its annual financial
statement filed with the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   The disclosures followed a day-long Disney board meeting in New
York and came after the stock market closed. Disney shares fell 85
cents, to $18.54 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Although Disney had already closed its books on its fiscal year
ended Sept. 30, the company is required to revise its numbers because
it had yet to file its 10-K financial report. It chose to announce
the news in advance.</TE>
<TE>   "We saw it as important to put out a press release indicating this
required revision," Chief Financial Officer Thomas Staggs said. Of
"Treasure Planet," he said: "It's just one movie, and that's the
nature of the business."</TE>
<TE>   Still, analyst Paul Kim of Kaufman Bros. in New York and Logsdon
noted that "Treasure Planet" is considered the last of Disney's
mega-budget animated films. Increasingly, the company has been
shaving costs on its animated features.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the last of a previous generation," Logsdon said.</TE>
<TE>   As for the SEC inquiry, Disney stressed that it is unrelated to
any financial disclosures. Rather, it stems from a filing this summer
with the SEC disclosing that director Reveta Bowers' son once worked
for its Internet group; director Gold's daughter works in consumer
products; and director Raymond Watson's son works for the Disney
channel. Disney also disclosed in that filling that director John
Bryson's wife, Louise, earned $1.35 million as a top executive at the
Lifetime cable channel, in which Disney has a 50% stake.</TE>
<TE>   Sources said the SEC wants to know why Disney didn't disclose
those details earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, Disney named former Seagram Co. Chief Financial
Officer Robert Matschullat as an independent director to head the
company's audit committee, and named former U.S. Sen. George Mitchell
to the new post of presiding over board meetings when Disney officers
aren't present.</TE>
<TE>   Disney directors also determined Tuesday that all but five of its
17 directors -- Eisner; President Robert Iger; Vice Chairman Roy
Disney; Gold, who is business partners with Roy Disney; and architect
Robert Stern, who has close business ties to the company -- are
independent under new guidelines. Iger, Gold and Stern won't serve on
any board committees.</TE>
<TE>   The independence guidelines were unanimously adopted at the
recommendation of Disney's corporate governance consultant, Ira
Millstein, a source close to the board said.</TE>
<TE>   Gold couldn't be reached for comment, but a source close to him
said he doesn't expect his watchdog role on the board to diminish and
vows to remain a strong advocate for shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still a relatively insular board, but they are at least
attempting to do the right thing in terms of the corporate governance
environment we're in," analyst Kim said.</TE>

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michael Eisner and his wife have dropped a lawsuit that claimed their
accountant miscalculated their California taxes for 1996 through
1999, according to court papers.</LD>
<LD>   The Walt Disney Co. chief executive and his wife, Jane, filed a
notice in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles last week that they were
dismissing the suit against Executive Monetary Management Inc. The
California Franchise Tax Board in July 2001 told the Eisners to pay
about $3 million in additional taxes and interest, according to the
suit. The Eisners' complaint sought compensation for the $3 million
as well as legal fees.</LD>

<HD>An 'E' Not So Hot as It Once Was</HD>
<DH>Fallen Enron's signature logo fetches far less at auction
than a sign sold in September.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kristen Hays</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The value of Enron Corp.'s signature "tilted E" has dropped like the
company's stock did a year ago, a possible sign that fascination with
the rubble of the fallen energy trader is fading.</LD>
<LD>   At a second auction of equipment and other Enron-related items
held to raise money for the company's creditors, a Houston chemist
paid $10,500 for one of two oft-televised stainless steel logos that
once stood outside Enron's downtown offices.</LD>
<LD>   Fred Massey said he bought the infamous letter as a Christmas
present for his wife. At the auction, Massey told a crowd of
reporters his name was Bobby Shackouls, a friend who is president of
energy firm Burlington Resources. Massey later said he lied to hide
his high-profile purchase from his wife until he could present her
with the gift.</LD>
<TE>   Burlington spokesman James Bartlett confirmed that Massey and
Shackouls know each other and that Shackouls was not the buyer.</TE>
<TE>   DoveBid, the business auction company conducting the sale,
declined to identify the buyer, citing privacy policies.</TE>
<TE>   "I apologize," Massey said. "I was trying to keep this as a secret
from my wife."</TE>
<TE>   Massey said he and his wife might convert the "E" into a coffee
table.</TE>
<TE>   This week's three-day auction comes one year after Enron filed for
bankruptcy protection.</TE>
<TE>   A similar two-day sale in September netted $3.3 million, including
$44,000 from the auction of a 5-by-5-foot stainless steel tilted-E
logo sign that used to be mounted outside one of Enron's satellite
offices.</TE>
<TE>   Other, more mundane items also went for more reasonable prices
than in September. Two 20-inch televisions were auctioned off for
$150 each, when a similar set went for $900 this fall.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the auction will wrap up with the sale of a third and
final stainless steel logo as well as a colorful lighted rotating
model dubbed the "Disco E."</TE>
<TE>   A final auction planned for January or February will feature
furniture and fixtures, such as conference tables and new carpet that
was never installed.</TE>

<HD>FERC Ruling a Setback to State Contracts Case</HD>
<DH>Judge says California can't introduce market-abuse evidence
in its bid to get power deals renegotiated.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Rivera Brooks</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California suffered a setback Tuesday in its bid to force
renegotiation of long-term power contracts after a regulatory judge
ruled the state could not introduce evidence of market manipulation
to bolster its claims.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, a team of California investigators camped out at the
Tulsa, Okla., headquarters of Williams Cos. to help determine whether
the state should honor its recently negotiated settlement with the
power supplier over energy contracts. The deal has been jeopardized
by new disclosures that Williams may have conspired to squeeze
electricity supplies in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   California's demand that federal regulators toss out costly
long-term electricity contracts is the subject of a two-week hearing
before Judge Bobbie McCartney, an administrative law judge with the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in Washington. McCartney ruled
Tuesday that she would not open the proceedings to consider
allegations of gaming the market.</LD>
<TE>   State officials maintain that manipulation by energy companies is
a legitimate consideration, saying it worsened the energy shortage
and created a crisis atmosphere that handicapped California as it
negotiated long-term power agreements with energy companies.</TE>
<TE>   But FERC spokesman Bryan Lee said market abuses were beyond the
scope of the contracts case.</TE>
<TE>   "This hearing was never to consider whether there were market
abuses," Lee said. "This hearing was to determine whether dysfunction
in the short-term market affected prices for long-term electricity
supply."</TE>
<TE>   The judge's ruling Tuesday is in sharp contrast with the
evidentiary procedure being followed in another case before FERC, in
which California is seeking as much as $9 billion in refunds for
alleged overcharges for short-term electricity purchases. In that
case, a U.S. appeals court has directed FERC to allow the parties to
develop and introduce evidence of manipulation.</TE>
<TE>   "This is wrong," Erik Saltmarsh, acting executive director of the
Electricity Oversight Board in Sacramento, said of McCartney's
ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Saltmarsh, whose state board is a party to the FERC contract
proceeding, said the judge based her decision on an overly narrow
interpretation of the commission order setting the matter for trial.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Gov. Davis, also blasted the
decision. "There is more and more evidence every day that market
manipulation existed, and they want to ignore it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite McCartney's ruling, the issue of market abuses could find
its way back into the case.</TE>
<TE>   One possible avenue was outlined by McCartney herself, when she
suggested that the state's lawyers could ask her to take "judicial
notice" of another FERC judge's initial finding that El Paso Corp.
manipulated the California natural-gas market.</TE>
<TE>   Natural gas is the main fuel for producing electricity in the
state. The El Paso case is being considered by the FERC board.</TE>
<TE>   Another avenue could lie with the refunds case, in which the
California plaintiffs have been given 100 days to develop and
introduce evidence that electricity prices were subject to
manipulation.</TE>
<TE>   Should such evidence emerge, McCartney may have to reconsider her
ruling.</TE>
<TE>   The hearing before McCartney is scheduled to end Dec. 13, and an
initial decision is due Feb. 14.</TE>
<TE>   That decision would go to the FERC board, whose commissioners
would decide whether to ratify it, reject it or send the case back to
the judge for more work.</TE>
<TE>   California has been attempting to renegotiate several long-term
power contracts and scored its biggest success with Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Williams last month agreed to slice as much as $1.4 billion from
the cost of a $4.3-billion contract to supply electricity to
California and provide more than $400 million in other concessions on
condition that the state drop civil lawsuits against Williams.</TE>
<TE>   California officials have until Dec. 15 to finalize the agreement.</TE>
<TE>   But Maviglio said the deal was placed in jeopardy after documents
were released last month detailing Williams' efforts to fake
power-plant shutdowns in early 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Williams said the state was aware of the documents all along. They
turned up as part of an investigation by FERC that Williams settled,
without admitting guilt, by paying $8 million in fines.</TE>
<TE>   The disclosures in the documents followed Williams' admission that
traders had lied to an industry publication about the price of some
natural-gas deals.</TE>
<TE>   Williams and other energy suppliers and traders remain the subject
of several state and federal probes.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers from a state task force investigating alleged energy
market manipulation are in Tulsa this week interviewing Williams
executives, traders and other employees, according to Tom Dresslar, a
spokesman for California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer.</TE>
<TE>   "We are doing the due diligence on the settlement, and the
agreement requires them to cooperate in our broader investigation,"
Dresslar said. "I assume we would be talking to them about the
overall market investigation."</TE>
<TE>   More than 20 interviews have been conducted and more than 500
boxes of documents are being examined, Dresslar said. This is the
team's second visit to Williams, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Williams spokesman Kelly Swan said the company is cooperating.</TE>
<TE>   "Both sides have an interest in consummating this agreement" by
the Dec. 15 deadline, Swan said.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything is headed in that direction."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar contributed to this
report, and Reuters was used in compiling it.</TE>

<HD>United Is a Poor Model for Employee Ownership</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Flanigan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It would be easy to look at what's happening at United Airlines, now
on the brink of bankruptcy, and conclude that the concept of employee
ownership in America has fallen into a tailspin.</LD>
<LD>   Eight years ago, after all, workers at United agreed to give up
$700 million in wage cuts and work-rule concessions. That, in turn,
afforded them the chance to buy out many of the airline's executives
and public shareholders and to form an employee stock ownership plan,
or ESOP.</LD>
<LD>   The idea at the time was that the employees would give up
short-term benefits for long-term gains.</LD>
<TE>   But for many reasons, the gains envisioned by the union leaders
who led the ESOP drive -- a greater voice in parent company UAL
Corp.'s policies and a direct stake in its future profitability --
have not materialized. After a burst of heightened productivity,
enthusiasm for the ownership plan waned quickly in the mid-1990s as
union members replaced their leaders and new managers took over for
retiring executives.</TE>
<TE>   UAL stock, which was selling at about $30 a share when the ESOP
went into effect and rose to more than $100 a share in 1997, has
nose-dived in the last year to its present price of about $3.
United's operations are plagued by costly inefficiencies, and if UAL
files for bankruptcy protection in coming days, the stock in the ESOP
will be virtually worthless. (The ESOP, which is administered by
trustees, controls 55% of UAL's shares.)</TE>
<TE>   So the question is: Was employee ownership simply a bad idea at
United? Or is there a bigger lesson that workers at other companies
-- especially those at the 11,000 firms in the U.S. that have ESOPs
-- should take away from the airline's woes?</TE>
<TE>   The answer is that, despite what is happening at United, ESOPs can
be a real boon to companies and their workers. But ESOPs aren't a
panacea, and they won't succeed in situations in which animosity
between management and the rank and file is the rule.</TE>
<TE>   Studies by the National Center for Employee Ownership in Oakland
show that companies with ESOPs can grow 8% to 11% a year faster than
they otherwise would be expected to grow -- but only when combined
with a truly "participative management style."</TE>
<TE>   At United, that notion never really took hold.</TE>
<TE>   For a time, "the company appeared interested in valuing
employees," says Ira Levy, a United mechanic in Denver who serves as
a district representative for the International Assn. of Machinists
and Aerospace Workers.</TE>
<TE>   But before long, top management "forgot all about the cooperation
with employees."</TE>
<TE>   Standing in sharp contrast to United is Southwest Airlines Co.,
which is 12% owned by an employee profit-sharing plan and is famous
for the way that everybody from the chairman on down gets along.</TE>
<TE>   "Southwest started small and had a cooperative culture from the
start," says Michael E. Levine, a law professor at Yale University
who served in executive positions with Continental Airlines Inc. and
Northwest Airlines Corp. "Ownership reinforces that culture."</TE>
<TE>   But, Levine adds, simply giving employees ownership "doesn't do
much to change behavior in an adversarial culture" such as United's.</TE>
<TE>   United's ownership plan was born in battle. The ESOP was
instituted in large part to finance the buyout of UAL's chief
executive at the time, Stephen Wolf, who was threatening to break
United into several regional airlines and to contract out maintenance
to nonunion firms.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Wolf walked away with a package worth about $30
million.</TE>
<TE>   "The ESOP succeeded because it got rid of Wolf and saved our
jobs," says Frank Larkin, a spokesman for the machinists union.</TE>
<TE>   But not for the long term. UAL has had to cut thousands of jobs
through the years, and the company announced Tuesday that it plans to
lay off 352 pilots in January and February.</TE>
<TE>   The fatal flaw in United's ESOP is that it was a distortion of the
purpose of employee ownership plans.</TE>
<TE>   "It was different from 99% of the plans because it was financed
with wage concessions," says John Menke, whose San Francisco law and
investment firm counsels companies on employee ownership.</TE>
<TE>   Menke was a student of the late Louis Kelso, a lawyer who
conceived the idea of ESOPs in the 1950s. Kelso believed that the
capitalist system would be stronger if all workers -- not just
outside stockholders and senior managers -- could share in owning
capital assets.</TE>
<TE>   It was an idea rooted in history. The Knights of Labor, a
19th-century predecessor of the AFL-CIO, had company ownership as a
goal. "They said if workers only bargain for wages they will limit
their future," notes Christopher Mackin, head of Ownership
Associates, a Boston consulting firm specializing in ESOPs.</TE>
<TE>   Kelso ultimately won the backing of Congress, which in 1974 passed
a law making it possible for the owners of a business to sell it to a
trust for the employees without incurring taxes on the proceeds.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, many companies have pursued variations on the ESOP
theme.</TE>
<TE>   In 1978, after Ralph M. Parsons died, the Pasadena engineering
company bearing his name set up a small ESOP to give employees a
stake in the firm. Six years later, Parsons' ESOP borrowed money to
buy up the remaining public stock in the firm, making it 100%
employee owned.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to align the interest of our engineers and skilled
personnel with those of the company," says Gary Stone, Parsons Corp.
general counsel. And those employees have done well: The ESOP has
handed out some $500 million to Parsons retirees.</TE>
<TE>   No doubt there are perils in employees' putting their investments
and retirement savings at risk in the same place as their jobs. But
United's failure shouldn't scare off others. An ESOP forged in the
right environment still can help employers and employees to soar.</TE>

<HD>Job Gains Expected for Orange County</HD>
<DH>An economic forecast also predicts that the scorching rise
in home values will cool significantly in 2003.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County employment will grow in 2003, but the rise in home
values will slow, according to an economic forecast released Tuesday
by Chapman University.</LD>
<LD>   Chapman economists predict that the county will see its nonfarm
payroll employment grow by 1.6%, or 23,000 jobs. That's a far cry
from the late 1990s, when payrolls were expanding by more than 3% a
year. But it would represent a solid gain from this year, as the
county is expected to end 2002 with virtually no employment growth.</LD>
<LD>   Gains are expected in services, trade, construction and some
portions of the county's manufacturing sector, which has shed nearly
17,000 jobs since its pre-recession peak.</LD>
<TE>   However, Orange County job seekers still will find it tough going
for the next several months, as most of the job gains are not
expected to materialize until the second half of 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Chapman forecast predicts that the scorching rise
in home values in Orange County -- where annual appreciation has hit
double digits in four of the last five years -- will cool
significantly in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Although interest rates remain near historical lows and inventory
is tight, Chapman University forecasters say the slowdown in
employment growth over the last year is expected to damp housing
demand in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   The forecast calls for resale housing prices in Orange County to
increase 2% on average next year, compared with a projected 12.7%
surge in 2002.</TE>

<HD>Rule Would Boost Mutual Fund Disclosure</HD>
<DH>The SEC is drafting a proposal to require management
companies to reveal their holdings more often than once every six
months.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investors may soon get a clearer picture of how mutual funds are
investing their money.</LD>
<LD>   Fund companies would have to disclose their stock holdings more
frequently under a new rule being developed by the Securities and
Exchange Commission, SEC officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The draft proposal, which the SEC is due to vote on this month, is
supported by investor advocates and opposed by the mutual fund
industry. SEC Chairman Harvey L. Pitt recommended the change after
accounting scandals at Enron Corp. and other companies, agency
officials said.</LD>
<TE>   "This plan would allow people to make better judgments," SEC
Investment-Management Director Paul Roye said. "If my fund owns Enron
stock, for example, I might want up-to-date information about the
extent of these holdings so I can consider whether to change funds."</TE>
<TE>   SEC rules now require mutual funds to disclose stock and bond
holdings every six months. Roye declined to say how often funds would
have to reveal investments under the SEC plan. Investor advocates
such as the Consumer Federation of America have asked the SEC to
require funds to disclose holdings every month.</TE>
<TE>   "The industry needs more frequent disclosure," said Geoffrey
Bobroff, a lawyer and fund consultant. "That said, I'm not sure how
much difference it will make, since no one knew about Enron's
problems till it blew up."</TE>
<TE>   The SEC plan comes as U.S. stock funds have been losing money and
many people have switched investments from stock to bond funds. About
52% of U.S. households have money in mutual funds.</TE>
<TE>   Fidelity Investments and Vanguard Group, the two largest mutual
fund companies, both expressed concern about SEC efforts to require
more frequent disclosure of portfolio holdings. The two companies
disclose each of their funds' full portfolios twice a year.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Boston-based Fidelity said traders might be able
to exploit more frequent fund disclosures to figure out a fund
company's investment strategy. These traders could then "front-run"
Fidelity's trades by buying the stock that the fund is in the process
of buying and selling shares that Fidelity is selling.</TE>
<TE>   Investor advocates such as the Consumer Federation and the AFL-CIO
first brought the issue to the SEC's attention with rule-making
petitions in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The Investment Company Institute, the fund industry trade group,
urged the SEC to reject these petitions for more frequent disclosure.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC's staff plans to submit the disclosure proposal to
commissioners this month. Commissioners will vote on whether to issue
the proposal for public comment before deciding on final adoption.</TE>

<HD>General Motors CEO to Add Chairman Title</HD>
<DH>Rick Wagoner, 49, will assume the post in May as Jack Smith
reaches the firm's mandatory retirement age.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rick Wagoner, the youngest chief executive at General Motors Corp. in
more than half a century, will add the post of chairman next year,
succeeding Jack Smith, who is retiring, the company said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Throughout GM's history, the chairman of the company has often
also been the CEO.</LD>
<LD>   Wagoner, 49, will give up the title of president. The world's
biggest automaker did not name a successor. Analysts said it was
unclear whether GM would name a new president, but they said Gary
Cowger, head of GM's North American operations, could be a candidate
for the position.</LD>
<TE>   Wagoner became chief executive of GM in June 2000, becoming the
youngest head of the company since the legendary corporate chief
Alfred Sloan took the helm in 1923.</TE>
<TE>   Wagoner worked his way up through the ranks, previously serving as
head of North American automotive operations and chief financial
officer and holding finance positions in Brazil, Canada and Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Smith announced this year that he would retire in 2003, when he
turns 65, the mandatory retirement age. He became chief executive of
GM in November 1992 and chairman in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   GM said the changes would take effect May 1.</TE>
<TE>   The company's shares fell $2.05 to $37.90 on the New York Stock
Exchange on a day when the broad market was down.</TE>

<HD>Jakks Pacific Buys Trendmasters' Assets</HD>
<DH>The purchase, seen as a good fit, allows the toy maker to
build on its sports business.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Abigail Goldman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jakks Pacific Inc., the Malibu-based maker of World Wrestling
Entertainment figures and Pentech pens, said Tuesday that it had
acquired the water guns, play sets and other assets of privately held
Trendmasters toys.</LD>
<LD>   Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Toy industry experts,
however, said the financially troubled Trendmasters had a number of
suitors and probably sold for about $25 million.</LD>
<LD>   Jakks' latest purchase comes just a few months after it finalized
the acquisition of Toymax International, the creator of Go Fly a Kite
and Funnoodle products, which vaulted Jakks to the toy industry's No.
3 spot, behind Mattel Inc. and Hasbro Inc.</LD>
<TE>   Sean McGowan, a toy industry analyst for Gerard Klauer Mattison in
New York, said that even without knowing the terms of the deal, he
believed the purchase was probably a good one for Jakks.</TE>
<TE>   "They're buying a couple products that are out there already,
getting into categories they're not already in, and they're probably
not paying a lot," McGowan said.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the company's strategy has been to offer more products
that sell before the holiday season. Many toy makers rely on
Christmas sales for more than half their yearly revenues.</TE>
<TE>   To that end, Jakks' recent acquisitions have included Pentech pens
and stationery, which are big sellers in the fall back-to-school
period, and Toymax, a maker of kites and pool floats that sell well
in the summer.</TE>
<TE>   With Trendmasters, Jakks builds on its summer and sports
businesses, adding that company's Storm line of Nerf-like foam balls
and water guns, which feature colored lights that give the shooting
water different hues.</TE>
<TE>   And like many of Jakks' strongest sellers, most of these products
sell for under $15, which Jakks executives say has been an important
part of their toys' appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the parts fit very well with our company, and they are a
well-known brand with retailers," said Stephen Berman, Jakks'
president and co-founder.</TE>
<TE>   "Many retailers called us [Tuesday] and complimented us on getting
the deal done," Berman said.</TE>
<TE>   Berman said Jakks' cash position remained strong. The company
raised more than $100 million last spring, in part to finance the
Toymax deal. Berman said Jakks also had an untapped bank line of $50
million available and less than $100,000 in debt.</TE>
<TE>   Jakks stock rose 45 cents to $16.50 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>S. Korean Defense Scandal to Test Competition Law</HD>
<DH>Contract bidding case reaches Calif. high court</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lisa Girion</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Loral Corp. hired Linda Kim in 1995 to handle its bid to supply
the government of South Korea with airplane radar systems, the
company was banking on her connections at the Blue House -- Seoul's
presidential residence -- and with other influential officials.</LD>
<LD>   What Loral didn't count on was that the former model, lounge
singer and Los Angeles nightclub owner would drag the company into an
ongoing controversy over her alleged affair with the South Korean
defense minister who awarded the contract. Love letters from the
minister to Kim, now 49 and living on a horse ranch in Saugus, were
splashed across the front pages of South Korean newspapers after the
pair became implicated in a separate bribery scheme.</LD>
<LD>   The scandal stayed confined to South Korea until 1999, when the
broker who competed against Kim for the radar contract filed suit in
Los Angeles. He maintained that the rival system he represented --
made by a Canadian company called MacDonald, Dettwiler &amp; Associates
-- was considered by South Korean project managers to be superior to
Loral's, not to mention $50 million cheaper. The suit alleged that
Loral won the bidding unfairly, relying on sex and bribes.</LD>
<TE>   The suit reaches a pivotal stage today when the California Supreme
Court hears arguments over whether Lockheed Martin Corp., which
acquired Loral in 1996, should face trial over the allegations that
it won the contract through unfair and illegal means.</TE>
<TE>   Lockheed has denied that it used Kim to gain unfair advantage in
the radar contest. "The underlying bribery allegations are without
merit, and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously," a Lockheed
spokesman said, declining to comment further.</TE>
<TE>   The case is being closely watched by many corporations -- and not
just because of its salaciousness. The matter is being seen as a key
test of California's unfair-competition statute, and whether the law
can be used to force companies doing business in the state to
disgorge profits from ill-gotten gains.</TE>
<TE>   The suit relies on South Korean news accounts that detailed U.S.
intelligence reports linking Kim to officials in charge of South
Korea's defense contracts. Among them is a 1998 article that said she
appeared to have control of an important national project "under her
skirt."</TE>
<TE>   The episode has drawn the attention of federal authorities, who
are using a grand jury in Los Angeles to pursue a criminal
investigation. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office declined to
comment, but Raytheon Corp. and Lockheed disclosed the receipt of
subpoenas this year seeking information on deals with South Korea,
including Loral's radar contract.</TE>
<TE>   Raytheon sold South Korea the Hawker 800XP reconnaissance planes
that were equipped with Loral's radar. In quarterly reports to
securities regulators, the companies said they were cooperating with
the inquiry.</TE>
<TE>   The focus of the federal investigation is unclear. The U.S.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act forbids U.S. companies from bribing
foreign officials. Another federal law caps broker commissions to
$50,000 per contract, far less than the $10 million the suit alleges
Loral paid Kim to represent the company in its radar bid. According
to a 1996 Loral memo obtained by The Times, the company appeared
willing to pay Kim an initial commission of at least $5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Kim did not return telephone calls Tuesday. Her lawyer said Kim
had not received a subpoena from the grand jury and had not been
questioned by law enforcement authorities.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Kim served one month of a one-year Korean prison sentence
for bribing government officials on behalf of another company,
Texas-based E-Systems, which won a $216-million contract.</TE>
<TE>   The E-Systems deal was decided at the same time and by the same
officials who were considering Loral's radar bid. Both companies used
Kim to advance their proposals.</TE>
<TE>   Kim, who owned the popular Flamingo nightclub in Los Angeles'
Koreatown until it closed in 2001 and was once caught up in a
brouhaha over an exchange of gifts with City Councilman Nate Holden,
has denied having an affair with the former South Korean defense
minister.</TE>
<TE>   In interviews with South Korean reporters, the former defense
minister acknowledged having had an inappropriate relationship with
Kim, but said it didn't affect his decision making.</TE>
<TE>   According to a 1995 Loral memo obtained by The Times, the firm
engaged Kim because it thought that she had extraordinary access to
key decision makers at the "highest levels of the Korean government,
up to and including the Blue House."</TE>
<TE>   The May 1995 memo, addressed to Frank Lanza, then-president of
Loral, says: "No one within the Loral Corporation has access to the
people that Dr. Kim has access to. She can easily gain access to
extremely important decision makers in the Korean Government....
[She] can help us carry our message to the correct people at the
appropriate time in the process."</TE>
<TE>   At issue before the state Supreme Court today is whether Korea
Supply Co., Kim's rival broker, can to sue to recover the $30-million
sales commission it could have earned on the deal.</TE>
<TE>   The court also will decide whether Korea Supply can force Lockheed
to disgorge its profit if the broker proves sex and bribes helped it
obtain the contract.</TE>
<TE>   "Our system was found to be far superior to the Loral system,"
said John Ahn, chairman of Korea Supply, a privately held South
Korean company with an office in Buena Park.</TE>
<TE>   "Our price was much lower than the Loral system; therefore, under
the fair-competition rule, we won the game," Ahn added. "We believe
that the illegal lobbying by Linda Kim made the decision [go] the
reverse way. They selected the higher price and the less capable
equipment. We are now trying to vindicate our rights and
entitlements."</TE>
<TE>   Lockheed is fighting Korea Supply's effort to force it to give up
its profit. Several corporations and trade groups have come to its
aid, filing briefs out of fear that the suit could lead to a dramatic
and costly expansion of sanctions available under the state's
unfair-competition law.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the corporate interests contend that the only remedies
available under the state law are injunctions and restitution.
Profits, they assert, are off-limits.</TE>
<TE>   "If a frustrated competitor can get what amounts to a damages
remedy under the statute, which is what Korea Supply is after, that
has the potential to severely distort existing tort law and provide a
means to obtain windfall recoveries against people doing business in
California," said James C. Martin, a Los Angeles lawyer who filed a
friend-of-the-court brief on behalf of the Washington Legal
Foundation and the National Assn. of Independent Insurers. "For any
company doing business in this state, that's problematic."</TE>
<TE>   But Maxwell Blecher, a lawyer for Korea Supply, said it was not a
stretch for the court to decide that California judges have the
discretion to force disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, especially in
egregious cases of unfair business practices with clear-cut victims,
such as his client.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're asking the court to do in this case doesn't present a
significant departure from present law," Blecher said. "Lockheed
wound up with money to which they are not entitled. They shouldn't be
enjoying the fruits of conduct that is clearly improper. There isn't
any moral justification for them to keep the money."</TE>

<TE>   California's unfair-competition law</TE>
<TE>   Summary</TE>
<TE>   Section 17200 of the California business code, often called the
unfair- competition law, prohibits "any unlawful, unfair or
fraudulent business act or practice" that can hurt California
consumers. It is controversial for the broad way judges have
interpreted it.</TE>
<TE>   Background</TE>
<TE>   1872: Law established. Originally just outlaws "unfair"
competition.</TE>
<TE>   1963: Legislators add the word "unlawful," widening the statute's
scope.</TE>
<TE>   1999: The California Supreme Court rules that "unfair" in the
statute means conduct violating antitrust laws and "otherwise
significantly threatens or harms competition."</TE>
<TE>   2000: The state Supreme Court rules that profits covered by 17200
can be given only to specific individuals the company has hurt and
cannot be put into a fund for all potential victims. In a related
suit, the court rules that withheld wages can be recovered under the
statute and that companies still can be sued up to four years after
the alleged incident.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents argue that the law:</TE>
<TE>   * Protects the public.</TE>
<TE>   * Was used successfully in suing the tobacco industry.</TE>
<TE>   * Requires attorneys to disclose more information than in other
business lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   * Has a longer statute of limitations.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents say:</TE>
<TE>   * Private attorneys can sue without a client if they say the suit
is in the public interest.</TE>
<TE>   * Attorneys have to show only a potential harm by a company and do
not have to show specific people were injured.</TE>
<TE>   * Private attorneys can bring a suit even if prosecutors already
have closed their case.</TE>
<TE>   * The law gives plaintiffs' lawyers undue leverage to negotiate
higher settlements.</TE>

<HD>Indexes Edge Lower on Sour Notes</HD>
<DH>Anemic forecasts and auto sales fan doubts about the
strength of a recovery. The Dow loses 119.64 points. The S&amp;P drops
13.78.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks continued their recent slump Tuesday after anemic forecasts
from media giant AOL Time Warner and mobile phone leader Nokia fanned
doubts about the strength of the economic recovery and Wall Street's
two-month rally.</LD>
<LD>   Investors also were rattled by reports that U.S. automakers' sales
fell in November. And Merrill Lynch's top U.S. strategist sounded
another sour note, saying investors should move some money out of
stocks and into bonds because the market appears "very speculative."</LD>
<LD>   "With earnings season over and no positive economic news to propel
it forward, it looks like the eight-week rally may be running out of
steam," said Stephen Carl, head of trading at Williams Capital Group.</LD>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 119.64 points, or
1.4%, at 8,742.93. The broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index fell 13.78
points, or 1.5%, to 920.75.</TE>
<TE>   Both indexes have now fallen for three consecutive trading
sessions. Before the recent slide, the Dow industrials had climbed
22% since Oct. 9.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the technology-laced Nasdaq composite index lost 35.82
points, or 2.4%, to close at 1,448.96 Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Losers outnumbered winners by 3 to 2 on the New York Stock
Exchange and by 2 to 1 on Nasdaq in moderate trading.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner tumbled $2.36, or 14%, to $14.21, making it the
Big Board's most-active stock and among its top percentage losers.</TE>
<TE>   The world's largest media company said advertising sales at its
America Online Internet service would fall 50% next year, and
signaled it doesn't expect a turnaround until 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Nokia lost 93 cents to $19.22 after the world's largest handset
maker said it expects the market in mobile infrastructure to shrink
about 10% in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Other cell phone makers fell in tandem, with Motorola off $1.19 to
$10.51 and Ericsson down 38 cents to $9.16. Cisco Systems, the No. 1
maker of telecom equipment, slipped 54 cents to $14.52.</TE>
<TE>   Nokia's outlook also weighed on semiconductor stocks because the
companies rely on handset makers to buy their chips. The SOX index of
semiconductor stocks dropped 5.2%, with KLA-Tencor, down $2.46 to
$42.28, and Novellus Systems, off $1.69 to $34.39, among the biggest
losers.</TE>
<TE>   "Nokia is the most meaningful puzzle piece for the semiconductor
index -- it's the proxy for some of the largest customers for
semiconductors," said Gary Wedbush, head of trading at investment
bank Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Automakers' stocks fell after Ford Motor, General Motors and
DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler unit all reported lower November sales.
Ford plunged $1.49, or 13%, to $9.96; GM lost $2.05 to $37.90; and
DaimlerChrysler fell $1.82 to $33.75.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill's top U.S. strategist, Richard Bernstein, brought more
gloom when he cut his stock allocation by 5 percentage points and
raised his bond recommendation by the same amount, putting stocks at
45% and bonds at 35% in his model portfolio. Cash allocation remained
untouched at 20%.</TE>
<TE>   The move drew investors to the bond market, lowering Treasury
yields. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note slipped to
4.2% from Monday's close of 4.23%</TE>
<TE>   Despite the day's declines, and blue-chip stocks' three-day slump,
some said a market rally into the end of the year is still in the
works.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a little bit of cooling off of the market from a pretty
nice run we've had," said Todd Clark, head of listed trading at Wells
Fargo Securities. "I don't view it as anything besides a [short-term]
pullback."</TE>
<TE>   In other highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Dow member Merck dropped $1.13 to $58.82 ahead of its yearly
forecast on Thursday. The drug maker's shares fell as much as $4.79
earlier in the session but then partially recovered after the company
said it was reaffirming its outlook.</TE>
<TE>   * Airline stocks fell after Continental Airlines and AMR, the
parent of American Airlines, reported disappointing November traffic.
Continental fell $1.25 to $7.90, AMR lost 86 cents to $6.86 and Delta
Air Lines fell $1.18 to $12.21.</TE>
<TE>   * Brokerage downgrades hurt several stocks. Supermarket operator
Albertson's fell $1.31 to $22.26 on a downgrade from J.P. Morgan,
while Marriott International declined $1.22 to $34.47 on a downgrade
from Deutsche Securities.</TE>
<TE>   * Wall Street's woes spilled over to Europe. Key indexes fell 2.3%
in France, 1.9% in Britain and 3% in Germany.</TE>

<HD>Mercury Air Directors Accused of Self-Dealing</HD>
<DH>The CEO and chairman are among targets of an investor
lawsuit alleging that they looted the L.A. aviation services firm.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James F. Peltz</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mercury Air Group Inc.'s chief executive and two other directors used
a "sweeping pattern of self-dealing" to "loot" the Los Angeles-based
supplier of jet fuel and other aviation services, a shareholder
lawsuit alleges.</LD>
<LD>   The suit, filed last week in San Diego County Superior Court in
Vista, comes as Mercury is struggling with financial problems. The
company is either in default or failing to meet terms on much of its
debt. In addition, an investor group said Monday that it bought a
7.34% stake in Mercury's depressed stock and might eventually
consider proposing its own slate of directors to bolster its
investment.</LD>
<LD>   Mercury CEO Joseph Czyzyk and the two other directors used their
partnership, CFK Partners, as the vehicle for "extracting millions of
dollars from the company for their own interest," thus reducing
Mercury's value for its remaining stockholders, the lawsuit alleges.
CFK Partners is Mercury's biggest investor, with a 31% interest.</LD>
<TE>   Mercury Chairman Philip Fagan Jr., a doctor who is not a Mercury
executive, and another Mercury director, Frederick Kopko Jr., also
are defendants in the suit brought by Andrew Chitiea, a Rancho Santa
Fe investor.</TE>
<TE>   Czyzyk declined to comment specifically Tuesday, saying he had not
seen the suit. But he said transactions involving Mercury executives
always have been approved by independent directors using third-party
information.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit alleges that the three used their influence on
Mercury's board to have the company repurchase nearly 525,000 of its
shares from CFK Partners for a "windfall profit" to the partnership.
Mercury bought the stock for $7.50 a share, or $3.9 million, a 53%
premium above its market value at the time, the suit contends.</TE>
<TE>   Mercury's thinly traded stock fell 9 cents Tuesday to $2.91 on the
American Stock Exchange. The stock has dropped gradually since early
2000, when it stood above $8 a share.</TE>
<TE>   CFK Partners also bought Mercury's headquarters in January for
$4.2 million and then "forced" the company to lease it back on
"highly favorable" terms for the partnership, the suit alleges.</TE>
<TE>   Kopko, a lawyer, said that he had not seen details of the suit but
that CFK Partners had sold the stock back to the company at a loss.
He said a "substantial portion" of the partnership's stake cost the
group $10 a share.</TE>
<TE>   He also defended the headquarters transaction, saying it reflected
"fair-market-value terms based on independent third-party
appraisals."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the group that acquired the 7.34% interest in Mercury
said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it
bought the shares as an investment but might try to elect new
directors or take other steps to boost the shares' value. The group
includes investors based in London and Bermuda.</TE>
<TE>   Mercury sells jet fuel to airlines, provides refueling and hangar
services for private and corporate aircraft, runs an air-cargo
operation and manages aircraft services at U.S. military bases.
Mercury also provides support services for the presidential jet, Air
Force One, at various locations.</TE>
<TE>   In its fiscal year ended June 30, Mercury reported a profit of $5
million on revenue of $383.3 million, but the earnings reflected an
$8.9-million gain on the sale of assets. In its fiscal first quarter
ended Sept. 30, the company lost $482,000 on revenue of $108 million,
compared with earnings of $791,000 on revenue of $103.7 million a
year earlier.</TE>

<HD>Sun's Microsoft Remedy Praised</HD>
<DH>Judge says including Java programming language in Windows
software is an attractive solution that could restore competition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Rowley</AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>Microsoft Corp. went back to court Tuesday to fight a proposal from
rival Sun Microsystems Inc. that the software giant be forced to
include Sun's Java programming language in its Windows operating
system software.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge J. Frederick Motz opened the three-day hearing
by commenting that Sun's plan offered an attractive and "narrowly
tailored" remedy that could restore competition in the wake of
illegal conduct by Microsoft. "That's sort of an attractive remedy,"
he said. "It is elegant."</LD>
<LD>   The judge's remarks may signal that Microsoft's legal troubles
aren't over despite the approval last month of a settlement between
the company and the U.S. government after a 4 1/2-year antitrust
battle. Two states, Massachusetts and West Virginia, are appealing
U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly's decision not to impose
tougher sanctions on the company.</LD>
<TE>   In the private suit in Baltimore, Sun is seeking a preliminary
injunction to prevent Microsoft from shipping versions of Windows
without its version of Java. In court Tuesday, Sun lawyer Lloyd R.
Day Jr. said that would stop Microsoft from using its "illegal
competitive advantage" to dominate the emerging market for Internet
services software. Windows runs on more than 90% of the world's
personal computers.</TE>
<TE>   Motz said the proposed remedy would let Sun's Java programming
language "compete on the merits" with Microsoft's .Net Framework
programming language, helping overcome Microsoft's illegal
"distortions of the market" that harmed Sun's distribution of Java.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft lawyer David Tulchin argued that its programming
language, which was designed for writing Web programs for electronic
commerce and providing other services on the Internet, would not
undermine Sun's dominance in a market it has long controlled.</TE>
<TE>   Sun is "not exactly a 98-pound weakling" and can easily pay
computer makers "a little bit of money" to install Java on every PC
they ship to consumers, Tulchin said.</TE>
<TE>   But Motz said history gives Sun a reason to worry. In the federal
antitrust trial, the court ruled that Microsoft pressured software
developers not to use Java. Motz also recalled that Netscape
Communications Corp.'s Navigator Web browser had more than an 80%
market share before Microsoft started bundling its Internet Explorer
into Windows.</TE>
<TE>   Netscape, now a unit of AOL Time Warner Inc., is suing Microsoft
for billions of dollars in damages, claiming Navigator was illegally
squeezed. Motz is presiding over that suit as well.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft shares fell 98 cents to $56.71 on the Nasdaq, where Sun
shares dropped 27 cents to $3.87.</TE>

<HD>Starz Unveils Movies on Demand From the Internet</HD>
<DH>The feature, to debut in the spring, lets users download
and watch films on own time.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jon Healey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Starz Encore Group  will unveil today a new feature for its cable TV
movie channels: the ability to download movies via the Internet and
watch them on demand.</LD>
<LD>   The Englewood, Colo., company is teaming with RealNetworks Inc. of
Seattle to provide a new, legitimate source of Hollywood movies
online, following in the footsteps of such start-ups as CinemaNow of
Marina del Rey and Movielink, a joint venture of five studios. The
main competition for all these services is online file-sharing, which
lets consumers find and download digital copies of movies for free.</LD>
<LD>   Internet movie services have limited appeal today -- it can take
hours to download a bulky digital movie file, and for most consumers,
the only way to watch a downloaded film is to sit in front of a
computer. But the announcement from Starz is another sign that
mainstream entertainment companies are starting to view the Internet
as a viable way to distribute movies, not just promote them.</LD>
<TE>   A key factor for online movie services is the spread of
high-speed, or broadband, Internet connections. By mid-2002, an
estimated 16 million people in the United States had high-speed
Internet connections at home, which typically deliver a movie 10 to
20 times faster than a dial-up modem can.</TE>
<TE>   Even with a high-speed link, downloading a movie can take longer
than a round trip to the video store. On the other hand, consumers
don't have to leave their homes to rent or return a downloadable
movie, nor do they have to worry about late fees.</TE>
<TE>   John J. Sie, chief executive of Starz, said the new "Starz on
Demand" service -- expected to roll out in the spring -- could expand
that potential audience by prodding more consumers to switch to
high-speed Internet connections. It could help Starz, too, by
promoting its premium movie channels and squeezing a few more dollars
out of the titles it licenses from the studios.</TE>
<TE>   The on-demand approach lets consumers watch movies on their own
schedules: starting, pausing, rewinding and replaying them as if they
were on tape.</TE>
<TE>   Starz already offers movies on demand through a few digital cable
systems, enabling consumers to watch films on their TV sets with no
downloading time. It's also doing a more limited version for DirecTV
customers, storing a few movies at a time on TiVo personal video
recorders.</TE>
<TE>   As with the other versions, the new service will be available only
to people who subscribe to Starz's premium movie package on cable or
satellite.</TE>
<TE>   For an additional fee, customers will be able to download as many
movies as they like from an online library of 100 titles, with about
60 new titles rotated in each month. The movie files will be
scrambled to deter people from making permanent copies, storing them
indefinitely or moving them to other computers.</TE>
<TE>   Starz's on-demand service includes movies from Walt Disney Co.,
Vivendi Universal's Universal Pictures, Revolution Studios and AOL
Time Warner Inc. subsidiary New Line Cinema.</TE>
<TE>   The Starz deal will add the first films to Real's online
programming service, which has drawn more than 850,000 subscribers
mainly on the strength of its sports, news and unscripted-TV
offerings.</TE>

<HD>Palmdale Housing Project Revived</HD>
<DH>Jim Previti of Empire Cos. agrees to take over development
of KB Home's long-delayed City Ranch community.</DH>

<LD>Ontario developer Jim Previti said Tuesday that he agreed to purchase
the long-delayed City Ranch project -- a nearly 2,000-acre,
master-planned community in Palmdale -- from KB Home Corp. for an
estimated $30 million. The deal could trigger the return of
large-scale home building to the Antelope Valley.</LD>
<LD>   Previti, chairman of Empire Cos., said the land development arm of
his company plans to start work early next year on the first phase of
1,400 single-family home lots that will be sold to other builders,
including Los Angeles-based KB Home.</LD>
<LD>   The project, which will be renamed Anaverde, eventually will
include about 5,000 homes and rank as one of the largest
master-planned communities in Los Angeles County.</LD>
<TE>   "We thought the time was right ... and the demand is there," said
Previti, who has been involved in the development of about 20,000
homes during his nearly 30-year career.</TE>
<TE>   Real estate observers said the City Ranch deal could attract other
developers to Palmdale and the surrounding Antelope Valley, where
home building has been limited to smaller projects as the region has
recovered slowly from the recession and real estate bust of the early
1990s. It was only this last June that the median sales price of a
home in Palmdale surpassed the previous record high of $145,000 set
in 1990, according to DataQuick Information Systems. (Prices bottomed
out at $82,000 in 1997.)</TE>
<TE>   "This will be the largest single development that the Antelope
Valley has seen in a long, long time," said Albert Praw, senior vice
president of asset management for KB Home.</TE>
<TE>   Under the deal, KB Home will receive $15 million in cash and a 49%
stake in a joint venture -- Anaverde -- valued at an additional $15
million, according to company officials. KB Home officials said the
sale will not affect earnings in the near term but that the company
expects to start recording revenue from lot sales early next year and
from the sale of homes in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   KB Home said it has agreed to build homes on 400 lots in the first
phase of the development, which is located in southwest Palmdale.
Prices will start around $250,000.</TE>
<TE>   KB Home has struggled to develop the project for more than a
decade after the real estate bust of the early 1990s wiped out demand
for new homes. The company has spent several years looking for a
partner to carry out the project after KB Home abandoned the
development business to focus strictly on home building. In September
2000, Newhall Land &amp; Farming Co., the developer of Valencia, pulled
out of a joint venture to develop City Ranch to focus its financial
resources on repurchasing its own stock.</TE>
<TE>   Previti has the experience and financial resources needed to
prepare the property for development over a long period of time, say
real estate industry observers. Late last year, Previti agreed to
sell his entry-level home business, known as the Forecast Group, to
home builder Hovnanian Enterprises for about $225 million.</TE>
<TE>   "Previti will pull this off," land broker Craig Atkins said. "It's
a great move for Empire."</TE>

<HD>Refinancings May Drop as Interest Rates Start to Rise</HD>
<DH>A decline in owners switching to cheaper loans and taking
cash out of equity would be a blow to the economy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The wave of home refinancings that bolstered the U.S. economic
recovery is showing signs of ebbing next year as mortgage rates start
to rise, house-price appreciation slows and the number of potential
borrowers shrinks.</LD>
<LD>   Homeowners will take out $751 billion in home loans next year to
repay older, costlier debt, often taking cash out of equity in their
homes, the Mortgage Bankers Assn. estimated. That would be just more
than half the projected record of $1.4 trillion this year and down
from $1.2 trillion in 2001. Mortgage rates may rise from 30-year lows
as the economy recovers.</LD>
<LD>   "The net effect of less refinancing next year is less stimulus for
the economy," said David Berson, chief economist at Fannie Mae, the
largest buyer of mortgages.</LD>
<TE>   Makers of autos, home furnishings and other goods may have to work
harder for sales as consumers' supply of new cash runs out. And until
a recovery takes stronger hold, some consumers remain worried about
their jobs. U.S. employers last month said they would cut 157,508
positions, down from 176,010 in October, according to placement firm
Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. estimated that home-equity withdrawals, or
"cash outs," accounted for half the rise in household spending since
2000. The boom fueled a 22% increase this year in the stock value of
Countrywide Financial Corp., the largest mortgage lender.</TE>
<TE>   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan last month said money that
consumers saved from refinancing helped counter the effect of this
year's 19% decline in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index. That has
assisted an economy struggling to escape last year's recession, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "A dollar of equity extracted from housing has a more powerful
effect on consumer spending than does a dollar change in the value of
common stocks," Greenspan said in congressional testimony Nov. 13.</TE>
<TE>   The confluence of falling interest rates and rising home values
that fueled the boom is coming to an end, according to projections by
the National Assn. of Realtors and the Mortgage Bankers Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "People who haven't refinanced already are running out of reasons
to," said Phil Colling, an economist at the Mortgage Bankers' Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Economists expect interest rates to increase next year as economic
growth rises above 3%. The average weekly rate on a 30-year fixed
mortgage monitored by No. 2 mortgage buyer Freddie Mac dropped from
8.64% in May 2000 to a record low of 5.94% last month. The rate has
since rebounded to 6.13%, and economists, including those at Freddie
Mac, predict it will rise to almost 7% a year from now.</TE>
<TE>   The monthly payment on a 30-year, $200,000 mortgage at 7% is
$1,330, or $130 a month more than a 6% loan.</TE>
<TE>   "As interest rates rise, refinancings will fall," said David
Parry, first vice president at Countrywide Financial Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac last month raised the limit on the size
of single-family home mortgages they buy from banks by 7.3%, to
$322,700 from $300,700, widening the field of home buyers eligible
for lower-cost financing.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the rise in house values has slowed.</TE>
<TE>   A 9.8% increase in prices over the 12 months through October, the
steepest climb since July 1987, encouraged homeowners to refinance,
take out cash and often cut their monthly payments. Now the
appreciation of home values is expected to slow to an annual rate of
about 4%, said David Lereah, chief economist at the National Assn. of
Realtors.</TE>
<TE>   The growth in national existing-home prices slowed during the
third quarter, according to the office of Federal Housing Enterprise
Oversight. Its new index of single-family home prices rose 0.84% in
the third quarter after a 2.39% acceleration in the prior three
months.</TE>
<TE>   As interest rates rise existing-home sales will slip to 5.29
million from an expected 5.52 million this year, the National Assn.
of Realtors said in a report Tuesday. The 2003 sales total still
would be the third-highest on record and close to the 5.3 million
homes sold in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The pool of those willing or able to refinance also has dwindled
as homeowners raced to lock in low rates. Refinancings accounted for
a record 70% of all mortgage applications in the fourth quarter of
2001, according to the Mortgage Bankers Assn. By the end of 2003,
such applications will decline to 25%, the group said.</TE>
<TE>   "People eager to refinance will already have done it," said Ethan
Harris, co-chief economist at Lehman Bros. Inc.</TE>

<LD>Stiffening the pretrial restraints he imposed in October, a federal
judge has ordered the operator of the Madster file-sharing service to
disable all computers he controls and pull the plug on his Internet
services immediately.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Marvin E. Aspen issued the order after
Madster, formerly known as Aimster, did not comply with his earlier
injunction against piracy on its system. The major music and movie
firms are suing Madster creator John Deep and the firms he controls
in Troy, N.Y., for alleged copyright infringement.</LD>
<LD>   Aspen said the restraints, which he applied Monday, would remain
in place until Dec. 22. He also scheduled a hearing Dec. 19 to
determine whether to find Madster in contempt for failing to comply
with the October injunction.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Sega Corp. launched an online service for game developers that would
compete with GameSpy Industries in Irvine.</LD>
<LD>   The Sega service provides developers with Web hosting, player
matching and billing capabilities. As consoles acquire the ability to
connect to the Internet, developers increasingly are building into
their games online features such as finding opponents, competing in
tournaments and downloading content.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of handling the logistics of maintaining an online
presence, developers have turned to companies such as GameSpy, a
provider of online services for more than 200 computer and console
games.</LD>
<TE>   Sega, which invested close to $100 million to bring its
now-discontinued Dreamcast online, retooled its network to help other
developers bring their games for Sony Corp.'s PlayStation 2 and
Nintendo Co.'s GameCube online.</TE>

financing firm that filed for bankruptcy protection last month, is
being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, said a
company spokesman.</LD>
<LD>   The SEC contacted the Dublin, Ohio-based firm last week. Closely
held National Century filed for Chapter 11 protection after the FBI

on concern about misuse of reserves meant to back the bonds.</LD>

<LD>The Pentagon said it would begin collecting $2.3 billion from General
Dynamics Corp. and Boeing Co. for what the government considers debt
owed on a canceled A-12 stealth aircraft project 11 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of asking the firms to turn over the $2.3 billion, the
Pentagon plans to get the money by withholding about $128 million a
month for 18 months on other government contracts held by the firms.</LD>
<LD>   General Dynamics said it intended to ask a federal judge to block
the government from deducting the payments.</LD>

<HD>Tenet Cuts Earnings Forecast for 2 Years</HD>
<DH>The hospital chain says it is overhauling policies that let
it boost prices charged to Medicare.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald D. White and Don Lee</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tenet Healthcare Corp., chastened by harsh criticisms for reaping
excessive Medicare payments, on Tuesday slashed its earnings outlook
for the next two years and outlined a new approach to hospital
pricing that includes discounts for uninsured patients.</LD>
<LD>   The nation's second-largest for-profit hospital chain told
financial analysts in New York that about half its earnings growth in
the last two years came from special Medicare reimbursements known as
outliers, which regulators are now auditing. Tenet has acknowledged
that it doubled its outlier payments in the last two years, to about
$750 million last year, by aggressively raising its hospital charges.</LD>
<LD>   Spurred by Tenet's sizable Medicare outlier payments, the agency
that oversees Medicare said Tuesday that it will step up its scrutiny
of hospitals that generate unusually large outliers.</LD>
<TE>   Tom Scully, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services, said hospitals suspected of inflating their charges to
boost outlier payments could be investigated by the Office of the
Inspector General.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have true costs, great. If not, we are going to come
looking for you," Scully said in an interview. Edward Prunchunas,
chief financial officer at the nonprofit Cedars-Sinai Medical Center,
called Scully's action "an appropriate response. They need to be able
to control any gaming of the [Medicare] system."</TE>
<TE>   The announcement from Medicare came as Santa Barbara-based Tenet
Chief Executive Jeffrey Barbakow and other company officials sought
to reassure Wall Street about its future prospects in the wake of a
Medicare audit and a separate federal investigation into allegedly
unnecessary heart operations at a Tenet hospital in Redding, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said they were generally pleased with Tenet's
presentation, but remained concerned about the ultimate effect of the
federal audit and the Redding investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the problem here is that the story is still in the hands
of the government," said Clifford Hewitt, a health analyst with Legg
Mason in Baltimore. "There are a lot of shoes that could drop."</TE>
<TE>   During the conference Tenet officials acknowledged that under
Medicare's new outlier payment criteria as many as 56 of the
company's 113 hospitals could face greater scrutiny over their
billing practices. Outlier payments are intended to cover unusually
expensive procedures and are paid in addition to fixed Medicare
reimbursements.</TE>
<TE>   Under one of Scully's new standards, hospitals with outlier
payments that exceed 10% of regular Medicare reimbursements could
trigger a review. Under this formula, Tenet said, as much as $376
million in current outlier revenue could be at risk.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet officials said their earnings from operations will range
from $2.38 to $2.78 a share in the current fiscal year. That would
compare to a profit of $2.34 a share in fiscal 2002. Previously, the
company estimated its current-year earnings would grow by at least
25%.</TE>
<TE>   For fiscal 2004, Tenet estimated its earnings per share would be
about $2.</TE>
<TE>   Barbakow told analysts that the company's recent analysis of
outlier payments was the first such review at Tenet. Barbakow
maintained that he wasn't aware of the company's heavy reliance on
outlier payments.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't dig deep enough when things were going unusually well,"
Barbakow said at the investment conference. "Clearly I will do so in
the future."</TE>
<TE>   The stock has since fallen by more than 65% since its high of
$52.50 in early October.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday Tenet's shares closed at $17.84, up 8 cents, on the New
York Stock Exchange. The company's presentation was made after the
market closed, and in after-hours trading Tenet's shares fell to
$16.90</TE>
<TE>   "The company's under a microscope and we know it," said Trevor
Fetter, who took over as Tenet's president after two of the company's
top executives stepped down last month. "We're likely to remain under
that microscope for years."</TE>
<TE>   Under its new hospital pricing strategy, Tenet said that it will
try to simplify its contracts with health insurers. Tenet said it
would move away from reimbursements based on gross retail charges set
by hospitals in favor of fixed daily fees.</TE>
<TE>   Although Tenet said that would not hurt its revenues, some
analysts worry that the company will not be able to sustain its sharp
increase in reimbursements from managed care health companies.</TE>
<TE>   As part of its new approach Tenet is freezing its retail prices
until at least next May, and plans to charge uninsured hospital
patients the same reduced rates that those in HMOs get.</TE>
<TE>   "I am thrilled to hear it," said Phil Boesch, a Marina del Rey
lawyer, who has filed suits against Tenet on behalf of 10 uninsured
patients.</TE>

<HD>Regal Is Ready for Its Digital Close-Up</HD>
<DH>The theater chain plans to upgrade projectors and add
high-speed networking equipment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>P.J. Huffstutter</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Regal Entertainment Corp., the nation's largest movie theater chain,
plans to retrofit nearly 80% of its locations by the end of next year
with digital projectors, high-speed data networking equipment and
satellite links, heralding the industry's most aggressive move yet to
embrace a future without film.</LD>
<LD>   Centennial, Colo.-based Regal -- which owns United Artists Theatre
Co. and Edwards Theatres Inc. -- said it would spend an initial $70
million on the effort. Regal will begin by showing short digital
movies and advertisements. As the company does further upgrades, it
will be able to show full-length digital movies.</LD>
<LD>   All the company's theaters in California, which account for 600 of
the 4,500 screens to be upgraded nationwide, are receiving the new
networking technology.</LD>
<TE>   "The future of exhibition is digital," said Tom Galley, chief
technology officer of Regal's high-tech subsidiary Regal CineMedia,
on Tuesday. "For us, this is a strategic, necessary move."</TE>
<TE>   Industry insiders and analysts alike long have expected exhibitors
such as Regal to embrace digital projection and distribution systems.</TE>
<TE>   The technology promises to rid movies of visual problems,
including wear that affects celluloid prints over time, scratches and
other on-screen flaws caused by mechanical projectors.</TE>
<TE>   And by eliminating film, studios expect to save hundreds of
millions of dollars in print production and distribution costs.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the conversion costs are considerable. One of the biggest
roadblocks has been determining who will pay the $150,000 cost for
each digital projector, along with the more than $20,000 per screen
for the computer that stores and feeds the movies.</TE>
<TE>   Regal is the first major movie theater chain to make such a
commitment to the digital revolution. But others are expected to
follow.</TE>
<TE>   "At some point in time, digital projection will become a standard
for theatrical films," said Jeffrey Logsdon, managing director of
investment bank Gerard Klauer Mattison. "Until then, Regal believes
that if it can put the infrastructure in now, and build a business
around it with promotional or advertising customers, it'll put the
company that much farther ahead of everyone else."</TE>
<TE>   Logsdon does not own shares of Regal, and his bank has no business
with the company.</TE>
<TE>   Embracing technology is key to the strategy of Regal's new owner,
Colorado-based billionaire Philip F. Anschutz.</TE>
<TE>   The founder and former chairman of Qwest Communications
International Inc. created Regal Entertainment by merging Regal
Cinemas Corp., United Artists and Edwards, all of which he acquired
this year through bankruptcy reorganizations amid an industrywide
slump.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of using celluloid reels, the machines Regal will install
are designed to allow digital files to be sent electronically to
theaters through high-speed data lines, over satellite transmissions
or on computer disks or digital videotape.</TE>
<TE>   Regal's electronic distribution system and digital projectors
start by receiving content via satellite and then store it in a
central server. High-speed data lines connect the server to each
screen and automatically upload the appropriate film or preview. Some
of the equipment will be supplied by Cypress-based Christie Digital
Systems Inc.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the system, digital plasma screens also will be
installed in the lobbies of Regal theaters.</TE>
<TE>   In October, Regal CineMedia inked a deal with General Electric
Co.'s NBC that calls for the network to create all-digital short
programs that will run before feature films. Advertising revenue will
help defray the cost of the upgrade, said Cliff Marks, president of
marketing for Regal CineMedia.</TE>
<TE>   Regal is not springing for the high-end digital equipment that
would be required to project a full-length movie -- at least not yet.
But the system is designed to allow the company to upgrade its
hardware once the industry settles on standards for digital
equipment.</TE>
<TE>   The seven major movie studios created the Digital Cinema
Initiatives in March to establish technology standards and build a
business model that will make it profitable to distribute digital
films electronically to the more than 100,000 theaters around the
world.</TE>
<TE>   Consortium representatives said they expected to have a
preliminary standard for end-to-end delivery by next month and
planned to test the technology throughout 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever film goes away forever, we'll be ready," Marks said.
Regal's system "is designed to allow us to unplug any piece of the
hardware in the system and plug in new ones when digital cinema
standards are established."</TE>

<HD>Fourtou Says All Options Open for Vivendi Media Properties</HD>
<DH>The CEO reveals no details, but sources say the U.S.
entertainment group could be sold outright or spun off.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Verrier</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Vivendi Universal moved ahead with widely anticipated plans to
transform itself essentially into a French telecom company, Chief
Executive Jean-Rene Fourtou said all options were open on the fate of
the U.S. entertainment group.</LD>
<LD>   Fourtou did not spell out those alternatives during a news
conference Tuesday in Paris, but sources close to the executive say
they include an outright sale to any number of investors, including
oil billionaire Marvin Davis, who put the assets in play with a
recent offer to buy a controlling stake for $13 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Although Vivendi rebuffed the initial offer, saying its assets
were not for sale, the two sides are expected to meet again next
month.</LD>
<TE>   "So far, I've resigned myself to follow Barry Diller's
entertainment strategy," Fourtou said, referring to the co-CEO of the
U.S. entertainment group.</TE>
<TE>   Diller has been working for months on a plan that would spin off
Universal's movie studio, theme parks and record labels, as well as
the USA cable network and Sci-Fi Channel, into a separately traded
company.</TE>
<TE>   "Barry has always dreamed of creating a strong media company under
the Universal brand," Fourtou said. "But I allow myself to consider
all alternatives."</TE>
<TE>   The comment left some wondering whether there was a rift between
Fourtou and Diller, with whom Fourtou has consulted closely since
taking over this summer. But company sources say Fourtou remains
friendly with Diller and is merely trying to stress his independence
from the media mogul. The two are co-chiefs of the U.S. entertainment
unit.</TE>
<TE>   Diller has shrouded his plans for the U.S. assets in secrecy and
holds much sway over their future because of a series of restrictions
he negotiated when he sold USA's film and cable businesses to Vivendi
this year for $11 billion. Vivendi is trying to renegotiate those
restrictions to give it the flexibility to sell the businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "Fourtou is telegraphing that 'I'm still the CEO here and we're
going to make the decision,' " said a source close to the company.
"He's saying, 'I'll consider all of Barry's expertise, but the board
has not made up its mind on what to do with entertainment assets.' "</TE>
<TE>   That's been a burning question for investors in the wake of the
Davis offer and Vivendi's moves to become a major player in the
telecom business.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Vivendi said it had reached agreement to pay $4
billion to buy BT Group's 26% share of Cegetel, bringing Vivendi's
stake in the company it founded in the 1990s to 70%.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi wants to control Cegetel, which operates the lucrative
mobile-phone company SFR, because it is a big moneymaker,
contributing one-third of Vivendi's operating profit in the third
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The deal effectively ends a much-publicized bidding war Vivendi
had waged with Britain's Vodafone,  which will end up with 30% of the
telecom business.</TE>
<TE>   Cegetel marks Fourtou's first major deal since he took the helm
last summer from Jean-Marie Messier.</TE>
<TE>   The deal has caused some observers to question Fourtou's long-term
strategy. He said as early as September that Vivendi would remain
primarily an entertainment and media company. But it is looking
increasingly likely that its focus will be on telecom, with a
possible investment stake in entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't make us happy," said Michael Nathanson, an analyst
with Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. "We wanted them to sell the Cegetel
stake. It would be a clearer story to be a media company only. Now
you have these two disparate parts of the company: telecom and media.
It's still not very clear to me what the strategy is."</TE>
<TE>   Paul Kim, an analyst with Kaufman Bros., expressed support for the
deal, saying that "it makes perfect sense to go after assets that you
think could be worth a lot more later on."</TE>

<HD>Study: Asbestos Suits Cost at Least 52,000 Jobs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Asbestos lawsuits have cost 52,000 to 60,000 Americans their jobs and
U.S. businesses as much as $275 billion, a study commissioned by the
American Insurance Assn. said.</LD>
<LD>   The industry group's report found that lawsuits brought by
individuals claiming asbestos-related illnesses hurt workers and
shareholders in companies that are sued, as well as employees vested
in retirement plans and smaller companies that do business with the
lawsuit targets.</LD>
<LD>   "This is something that is significant for firms in bankruptcy and
for the economy as a whole," said Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz, a
Columbia University economics professor and chairman of former
President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisors. "Today the impacts
are being felt by workers."</LD>
<TE>   Asbestos suits have forced more than 60 companies to seek
bankruptcy protection, including 20 since 2000, said Jonathan Orszag,
a former assistant Commerce secretary and co-author of the report.
Federal-Mogul Corp. and W.R. Grace &amp; Co. are among the companies that
have sought Chapter 11 protection since 2000 citing liability from
asbestos, a carcinogen used as insulation and fireproofing.</TE>
<TE>   Stiglitz and Orszag urged Congress to enact legislation to protect
companies facing asbestos litigation liability.</TE>
<TE>   Plaintiffs' attorneys said the best way for companies to resolve
their asbestos liability is to pay victims fair compensation. The
companies shouldn't get special treatment from Congress, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "Trying to nationally legislate who is sick and who is not sick is
reprehensible," said Patrick Malouf, a plaintiffs' lawyer in Jackson,
Miss. His clients won a $150-million verdict in an asbestos
product-liability case in October 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Each worker forced into unemployment or a lower-paying job will
lose an average of $25,000 to $50,000 in earnings over a career, the
study said. Companies already in Bankruptcy Court face legal,
accounting and other costs as high as $650 million, the study said.</TE>

<HD>Corona OKs Edison Takeover</HD>
<DH>The utility says its property isn't for sale and vows to
fight the City Council's decision to seize the electricity
distribution system.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Taking another step toward power independence, the Corona City
Council has voted to use its eminent-domain powers to take over
Southern California Edison's electric distribution lines.</LD>
<LD>   The council unanimously approved the takeover resolution late
Monday, starting what could be a long legal process. Edison said that
its property isn't for sale and that it would fight to keep it.</LD>
<LD>   "The citizens and businesses of Corona can save money if the city
starts a municipally owned and operated system," Mayor Darrell
Talbert said. "It was the right thing to do."</LD>
<TE>   Corona officials say they can offer better service at lower rates,
but an Edison study released Monday contends that the city has
underestimated costs and that rates would increase under a
municipally owned utility.</TE>
<TE>   Corona is one of more than 200 cities and towns across the U.S.
that have explored forming municipal utilities in the last year,
according to the American Public Power Assn. Portland, Ore., has
proposed buying Portland General Electric from Enron Corp., and the
Southern Nevada Water Authority has been trying to buy Sierra Pacific
Resources' Nevada Power Co.</TE>
<TE>   Talbert said Corona, a city of 138,000 in Riverside County, will
begin the eminent-domain process immediately.</TE>
<TE>   "We are disappointed by the action" Monday night, said Charley
Wilson, a spokesman for Southern California Edison, which is owned by
Edison International. "If they do file, we will review that, and will
take appropriate legal steps to respond."</TE>

<HD>HP Says Cost Savings From Merger Ahead of Schedule</HD>
<DH>The computer maker leaves sales and profit projections for
the quarter unchanged. CEO says the economy remains uncertain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Terril Yue Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Hewlett-Packard Co. will achieve its planned $3 billion in cost
savings after its merger with Compaq Computer Corp. by the end of
this fiscal year, one year ahead of schedule, Chief Executive Carly
Fiorina said Tuesday at a meeting with Wall Street analysts.</LD>
<LD>   "The integration process is now one year ahead of schedule as we
continue to drive improvements in our cost structures and in our
competitive position," Fiorina told analysts gathered at the San
Francisco Hilton. "We achieved 75% of our cost-cut target last fiscal
year, so we are going to get all $3 billion this fiscal year."</LD>
<LD>   The ability of Palo Alto-based HP to meet its accelerated target
"does not depend on the market turning up or an increase" in
information technology spending, Fiorina said.</LD>
<TE>   The computer and printer maker acquired rival Compaq in May.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Milunovich, a technology analyst with Merrill Lynch in New
York, said HP could continue to reap cost savings from the Compaq
merger for the next couple of years.</TE>
<TE>   "There's huge cost to be cut between these two companies, and I
think it's going to be a gift that keeps giving," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Fiorina did not raise the company's estimates for sales and profit
in the first quarter of the new fiscal year, which began Nov. 1. HP
had said previously that it expected to earn 27 cents a share on
sales of $18.4 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts considered those estimates a conservative goal and
thought HP would raise its guidance.</TE>
<TE>   "The economy continues to remain uncertain, and we want to make
sure we don't get ahead of ourselves," Fiorina said.</TE>
<TE>   She also said that she expected the market for HP's products to
grow by 2% to 4%, down from previous forecasts of 4% to 6%, although
the firm's market share should remain constant.</TE>
<TE>   Two of HP's money-losing units will come out of the red this
fiscal year, Fiorina said. The Personal Systems Group, which sells
desktop, laptop and hand-held computers to consumers, will break even
this year, and the Enterprise Systems Group, which designs and sells
corporate computer networks, will turn profitable.</TE>
<TE>   She also raised the outlook for the booming Imaging and Printing
Group. Its operating profit will be 13% to 15%, 2 percentage points
higher than previously announced. HP is the world's top manufacturer
of computer printers.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of HP fell 60 cents to close at $19.23 in regular trading
on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday as the meeting was getting
underway. They fell as low as $18.50 in after-hours trading.</TE>
<TE>   The company's shares are off more than 50% since the Compaq
acquisition closed.</TE>

<HD>J.P. Morgan Lawyer Admits Circular Enron Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A lawyer for J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. on Tuesday admitted the bank
engineered a series of circular deals in which Enron Corp., to suit
its accounting needs, sold gas to a Chase-owned entity and then
bought it back as part of the same deal.</LD>
<LD>   The lawyer was testifying during the second day of a trial in
which J.P. Morgan Chase is suing 11 insurance firms for refusing to
pay $1 billion in surety bond coverage, which the insurers issued to
guarantee the deals with Enron.</LD>
<LD>   Arguments presented by the two sides are expected to shine a light
on the complex ways Enron worked with its financiers.</LD>
<TE>   The insurers, including Chubb Corp. and Hartford Financial
Services Group, have said they were misled about the true nature of
the deals, saying the transactions were a disguised loan to the
heavily indebted Enron and that no gas or oil ever changed hands.</TE>
<TE>   Under the deals in question, J.P. Morgan, through a related entity
called Mahonia, paid $1.9 billion up front to Enron in exchange for a
series of oil and gas shipments to Mahonia.</TE>
<TE>   Mahonia, via J.P. Morgan, was then free to sell the commodities to
other companies and traders, including, sometimes, back to Enron.</TE>
<TE>   In federal court in Manhattan on Tuesday, Celia Barenholtz, the
attorney representing the insurance firms, used a string of e-mails,
memos and flow charts in an attempt to show that in many of the
deals, the gas or oil that was sold to Mahonia by Enron ended up
being sold back to Enron by Chase as part of the same transaction.</TE>
<TE>   The deals were signed and dated the same day, meaning that no
physical gas or oil ever changed hands.</TE>
<TE>   "The structure was totally circular, yes?" Judge Jed Rakoff asked
the J.P. Morgan Chase lawyer, Philip Levy.</TE>
<TE>   "The gas that was going to be sold to Mahonia would then be sold
in a number of separate transactions that would ultimately be sold to
Enron?" Rakoff added.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, I guess that would be circular," Levy admitted.</TE>
<TE>   J.P. Morgan officials say the insurance firms knew that the deals
with Enron were financing arrangements that involved the buying and
selling of oil and gas. But they deny that the deals constitute a
loan. The insurers signed "absolute and unconditional" agreements to
pay Chase should Enron default on the deliveries or payments for
deliveries. But when Enron filed for bankruptcy protection in
December 2001, Chase lead attorney John Callagy said, the insurance
firms hurriedly met in New York and quickly came up with an excuse
for not paying.</TE>
<TE>   The trial is expected to last about three weeks.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>William Webster plans to step aside as head of the new federal
accounting oversight board before its first official meeting Jan. 6.</LD>
<LD>   Webster led a second informal meeting of the five-member panel
Monday in Washington. The board discussed a schedule for collecting
fees from public companies to fund its work and for inspecting
accounting firms' work by summer.</LD>
<LD>   Webster, a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
and Central Intelligence Agency, said last month that he would resign
over questions about his role at U.S. Technologies Inc., where he
headed the audit committee.</LD>
<TE>   Webster indicated that the SEC will name an interim oversight
board chairman from among the board's other four members. The SEC
isn't likely to pick a permanent successor for Webster by early
January.</TE>

<HD>5 Brokerages Fined For Not Preserving E-Mails</HD>
<DH>Firms will pay a total of $8.25 million. Discovery that
they were not properly keeping communications comes amid larger
probe.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Five Wall Street brokerage firms Tuesday were fined a total of $8.25
million for not preserving e-mails, a discovery made as securities
regulators probed whether analysts were pushed to help win investment
banking business.</LD>
<LD>   The five firms -- Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., Citigroup Inc.'s Salomon
Smith Barney unit, Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., Deutsche Bank Securities
Inc. and U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray Inc. -- agreed to pay $1.65
million each and to review and report on procedures for keeping
e-mails.</LD>
<LD>   "Each firm had inadequate procedures and systems to retain and
make accessible e-mail communications," the Securities and Exchange
Commission, New York Stock Exchange and NASD, formerly known as the
National Assn. of Securities Dealers, said. Rules require the firms
to keep such records for at least two years.</LD>
<TE>   The discovery that the firms were not properly keeping
communications was made as regulators probed Wall Street firms on
issues such as whether analysts were pressured to issue overly
bullish research to help win investment banking business.</TE>
<TE>   Settlement talks in the broader investigation of analysts could
result in firms paying a total of more than $1 billion. Some
individual brokerages could cough up as much as $500 million, sources
familiar with the situation have said.</TE>
<TE>   A settlement could come by mid-December, they have said.</TE>
<TE>   Electronic communications in some cases have been the death knell
for some highflying Wall Street analysts, such as Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co.'s Henry Blodget and Salomon's Jack Grubman, whose e-mails
trashing stocks they publicly lauded have come to light.</TE>
<TE>   The securities regulators Tuesday complained the firms did a
haphazard job of keeping e-mails, organizing them poorly and
sometimes erasing computer hard drives preserving communications.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the fines, the firms agreed to report to the
regulators within 90 days on their procedures to comply with the
rules for preserving e-mails. Regulators said although the firms did
not admit or deny the allegations, they consented to findings that
they had violated SEC and stock market rules.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Duff, Piper Jaffray's chief executive, said in a statement:
"We are confident that our current e-mail procedures and enhanced
software fully meets all of the regulatory requirements for e-mail
retention."</TE>
<TE>   "This settlement resolves a complex regulatory issue that has been
the subject of much discussion over recent years," Salomon
spokeswoman Arda Nazerian said. "We're pleased to have the matter
resolved."</TE>
<TE>   Goldman and Deutsche Bank officials were not available to comment.
Morgan Stanley declined to comment.</TE>

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. stock funds rose 5.9% last month, their biggest return in a
year, led by gains in science, technology and telecom funds, an
industry report said.</LD>
<LD>   The increase was in line with October's 5.8% rise and was the
biggest since the 7.5% gain in November 2001, research firm Lipper
Inc. said. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index increased 15% during
October and November, after declining 29% from January to September.</LD>
<LD>   Value funds, which invest in companies whose assets are worth more
than their stock prices, outpaced growth funds, which buy the shares
of fast-growing businesses, Lipper said. Value funds increased 6.9%
in November, while growth funds rose 5.8%.</LD>
<TE>   Science and technology funds had the biggest returns last month,
gaining 17%, Lipper said. Telecommunication funds increased 14%.</TE>

<HD>This Change Gets Our Vote</HD>
<DH>Americans are losing their lackadaisical attitude toward
politics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Raise the topic of politics and people aren't so quick to yawn and
change the subject anymore. There's a tingle about it right now,
don't you agree?</LD>
<LD>   The era of the managerial chief executive, the incrementalist
politician, the captive-to-the-polls candidate -- typified by, say,
Bill Clinton for most of his presidency, or any of the last three
California governors -- seems as out of fashion as paisley neckties.
For the moment at least, boldness has returned, not just as a
leadership attribute that Americans say they admire  but one they
actually are willing to risk.</LD>
<LD>   How else can you explain that Al Gore, the keenest of political
weather vanes, is now talking about audacity, of all things? Or that
the field of Democratic presidential challengers overall seems
invigorated, not daunted by the midterm elections?</LD>
<TE>   Or that Republicans are feeling so spirited that they're
considering not just a make-over for Social Security but its twin
untouchable, Medicare? Or that Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill wants
nothing less than a complete rewrite of our bulky tax system?</TE>
<TE>   Or that important backers of Ralph Nader are now openly begging
him not to repeat his third-party folly because things have gotten
really serious, see?</TE>
<TE>   Our last two national elections have proved that every vote
counts. And the aftermath of these two elections reminds us why: Like
it or not, government sometimes matters, and more so right now, both
directly in the delivery of policy and indirectly as a mirror of our
civic sensibilities. For many, the realization is startling.</TE>
<TE>   Some people attribute this new oomph in politics solely to
terrorism and to our new sense of national vulnerability. But I don't
believe that entirely covers the ground. In fits and starts,
government has been stirring for a while.</TE>
<TE>   Welfare reform comes to mind, and the federal consensus that
schools are failing. And for a brief time, even Clinton reached for
boldness.</TE>
<TE>   Increasingly, it seems, deferring our challenges is not recognized
as a way out of them.</TE>
<TE>   Only in the broadest terms does the war with terrorists explain
why some of the most adventurous ideas being discussed today involve
fundamental at-home matters like health care, retirement and how we
tax ourselves -- choke points in social progress for more than a
generation.</TE>
<TE>   The inevitable recognition that we are engaged in a clash of
global ideals, even civilizations, may be prying open the door for
examination of the nature of this society we defend.</TE>
<TE>   What makes matters so interesting, beyond the bravado, are the
head-spinning ironies and philosophic realignments occurring
simultaneously in our politics -- pushing both parties onto
unfamiliar ground and even sending some of our lock-step special
interests off in surprising directions.</TE>
<TE>   Conservatives secured their majority in Washington -- courts,
presidency and Congress -- at just the time when their
free-enterprise and deregulatory principles had borne a bumper
harvest of rotted fruit. Just as fundamentally, the conservative
creed about reducing government's reach into our lives has been
turned inside out.</TE>
<TE>   Who would have guessed that conservatives would call for a
neighbor-on-neighbor snoop program, not to mention propose the most
invasive collection of personal data on the citizenry envisioned
since the heyday of the Soviet Union?</TE>
<TE>   Once the champions of states' rights, conservatives have fallen
head over heels in love with federal rule: The Department of
Education has been granted life-and-death sway over schools. Local
voters who approved initiatives to permit medical use of marijuana
and doctor-assisted suicide are accorded the respect of outlaws.</TE>
<TE>   Liberals, on the defense, have gotten themselves nowhere by
borrowing the old-fashioned language of conservatives, saying, wait
just a minute. After many years of trying awkwardly to span the gap
between the haves and the have-nots, their footing has come loose.
But, if you believe the polls, the foundation of their ideals hasn't.
It's worth noting that in defeat, liberals are starting to sound
almost as bold as conservatives in victory.</TE>
<TE>   On the map, the nation remains divided, as usual. But that doesn't
hide the growing dynamism in politics. Conservatives have made strong
gains on once-bedrock liberal issues like education, ensuring honesty
in the free markets and even Social Security.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats, meanwhile, retained public backing on environmental
issues and tax fairness. And Democratic ideas have gained currency
from unexpected quarters in recent days. The CEOs of the influential
Business Roundtable argued that tax breaks for low- and middle-income
individuals would help the economy more than breaks for corporations.
The chief executive of Blue Shield of California called for universal
health insurance. A group of evangelical Christians lobbied Detroit
to improve gasoline mileage.</TE>
<TE>   Lately, many Americans have fooled themselves into thinking that
their votes didn't matter, that lackluster politics offered them no
real choice. Now, the biggest change of all is that this attitude
itself is changing.</TE>

<HD>Islam's Outdated Domination Theology</HD>
<DH>Only when Muslims accept religious pluralism will peace
have a chance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Yossi Klein Halevi</AU>
<BD>Yossi Klein Halevi is author of "At the Entrance to
the Garden of Eden: A Jew's Search for Hope with Christians and
Muslims in the Holy Land" (Harper/Collins, 2001).</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>With the globalization of Islamic terrorism and mob violence, it is
becoming increasingly absurd to ascribe the threat to a fanatic
fringe. Yet between those who dismiss the growing Islamic assault on
the West as marginal and those agitating for a war of civilizations,
a third way exists: offering Islam the respect it deserves as one of
the world's great faiths while insisting that it confront its
outmoded theology of domination.</LD>
<LD>   Muslims who note that Islam is a religion of peace and tolerance
are right, but only in a medieval sense. Muslim law does indeed
permit freedom of religion for Jews and Christians, who are cited in
the Koran as "peoples of the book." But the prerequisite for Muslim
tolerance is Muslim rule. Even Muslim Spain, the medieval world's
most inspiring example of religious coexistence, was premised on the
primacy of Islamic dominance.</LD>
<LD>   Like Christianity, Islam is a universal faith that envisions the
ultimate transformation of the world in its image. But unlike large
parts of Christianity in our time, Islam has yet to consider the
option of religious pluralism based on the equality of faiths.</LD>
<TE>   For Islam, historical experience reinforces theology. As historian
Bernard Lewis notes, Islam is the only monotheistic religion whose
founder lived to see the triumph of his faith. Because Islam knew
power from its very inception, Muslims came to see dominance as their
birthright. In the past, Islam proved capable of magnanimity toward
its non-Muslim subjects. But it hasn't proved its capacity for
equality. For Islam, only two options exist: to dominate or be
dominated.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinian terrorist war against Israel is the most extreme
form of that mind-set. The terrorists' goal isn't ending the
occupation of the West Bank and creating a Palestinian state living
peacefully beside Israel but the destruction of the Mideast's only
Western, non-Muslim state.</TE>
<TE>   For normative Islamic theology, the very existence of a Jewish
state in the Muslim heartland -- "Dar al Islam," the House of Islam
-- is an offense.  Al Qaeda statements against Israel don't refer to
its policies as much as its very existence.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Islam, along with other faiths, is capable of adapting to
changing circumstance. The Koran, like other scriptures, contains
verses that reinforce religious exclusivity but also verses that can
be summoned to justify a new Islamic pluralism. Religions grow subtly
when their adherents begin emphasizing certain parts of scripture to
support their new spiritual insights. That is precisely what happened
after the Holocaust to the Catholic Church, which stopped citing the
New Testament's anti-Jewish verses and instead began emphasizing
those verses affirming God's love for the Jewish people.</TE>
<TE>   Islam's challenge is to balance its vision of itself as a faith
that dominates the world with a humility that concedes the need for
religious restraint in a world threatened with nuclear destruction.</TE>
<TE>   Humility is a profound trait in Islam. More than most faiths,
Islam inculcates in its believers a frank acknowledgment of their own
mortality. Muslims live with a constant awareness of human
transience.</TE>
<TE>   The dark side of that awareness is the demonic phenomenon of the
suicide bombers. But at its best, the Muslim ability to accept death
produces spiritual generosity. Palestinian Muslims have repeatedly
told me how foolish it is for Arabs and Jews to fight over land when
in the end the land will claim both. That acceptance of mortality
offers hope for Muslim restraint in addressing the ambition of
universal domination.</TE>
<TE>   Those who want us to believe that the anti-Christian riots in
Nigeria and the terrorist atrocities aimed at international tourism
in Indonesia and Kenya are merely the work of a frustrated fringe are
weakening the West's ability to recognize the scope of the threat and
to defend itself from a new totalitarian onslaught. But those who
label Islam as inherently violent and intolerant are denying its
capacity for spiritual growth. And they are abandoning those
still-rare but extraordinarily courageous voices within Islam calling
for theological modernization.</TE>
<TE>   Winning this war, then, requires a two-pronged approach. First,
the West must respond to aggression without sentimentality or
self-recrimination. At the same time, we must support those who are
struggling to help Islam evolve so that it can become again a crucial
shaper of civilization.</TE>

are straightforward ("I was sick") or amusing ("I left it in my
laundry at my parent's house").</LD>
<LD>   Occasionally, though, the justifications are alarming, and I fear
that the tip of a daiquiri pitcher is a common source of student
failure, as for the young man who candidly informed me, "I partied
hardy this weekend, got into a DUI crash and spent the night in
jail."</LD>
<LD>   My reaction in that case was limited by the perverse situation in
which modern educators find themselves. We are forbidden (or, rather,
scared off by the prospects of litigation) from giving students
behavioral remonstrations.</LD>
<TE>   When you see the sports riots on college campuses or hear about
out-of-control sex parties in dorms or drinking binges at fraternity
houses, recall that the young people in question have no one to tell
them to "cut it out." At one time, schools could exercise the
doctrine of in loco parentis, Latin for "in the place of the
parents."</TE>
<TE>   The idea that institutions of higher learning should play some
supervisory role over student behavior was a casualty of the 1960s.
At that time, the watchwords for students were "freedom" and
"independence." Many faculty members, unfortunately, cheered their
rebellious pupils, assuming that getting rid of dress codes, same-sex
dorms, curfews, snooping and teacher scolding was part of some larger
struggle for human liberation.</TE>
<TE>   The right of 18-year-olds to vote, though, should not have been
paired with the right to drink yourself into a coma. It's time to
bring loco back.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, the courts still pretend that educational institutions
have the ability to stymie stupidity. Invariably, the parents of kids
who binge-drink themselves to death win legal judgments against the
schools they attended. Thus the dilemma: Intervene and risk being
sued; allow freedom and get sued for not intervening.</TE>
<TE>   Add to the mix America's worship of youth itself. Advertisers seem
to think that we are all 15 years old or want to be. Yet a youth
culture is, by definition, one that needs to be educated and
cultivated to maturity, not ogled and aped. Indeed, studies of the
brain suggest that the centers that monitor control and reason do not
develop fully until much later than the teen years. As the
philosopher Kierkegaard put it: "Wisdom does not grow with wisdom
teeth."</TE>
<TE>   Interestingly, among the last bastions of in loco parentis are
some of the nation's historically black colleges and universities. I
have African American students who transferred or have siblings who
attended such institutions. They tell me that teachers there still
feel the duty (and are given the license) to tell students to "shape
up" and act properly.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps all of us, parents and teachers, need to reclaim our
rights to oversee the behavior of children, even those who can vote
or join the Army (which, in past days, was the perfect place to
reform "boys gone wild").</TE>
<TE>   Most of my students are wonderful, law-abiding and decent;
otherwise, I wouldn't be a teacher. But they are also still growing
up, and they need strong adult supervision to nurture them.</TE>

<HD>Back to the Admissions Morass</HD>

<BD>Jonathan Turley is a law professor at George Washington
University.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the acceptance of two Michigan cases Monday, the U.S. Supreme
Court returned to one of its most divisive areas: the use of race in
graduate and undergraduate admissions. This comes decades after its
controversial decision in University of California Regents vs. Bakke,
in which the court struck down racial quotas in admissions but
vaguely allowed race as one of the "criteria." In large part, the
court is returning to a morass of its own making.</LD>
<LD>   The 1978 Bakke decision was clear as to what is impermissible
under the Constitution, but not what is permissible. Clearly, schools
cannot adopt the type of race-based quota system that prevented Allan
Bakke from being admitted to medical school. However, in suggesting
that race could be used as a criterion, the ruling left courts to
grapple with the obvious question of how much weight could be given
to such a criterion. The resulting confusion was magnified by the
court's later rejection of race-conscious systems in other areas like
federal contracts, suggesting that Bakke may no longer hold a
majority on the court.</LD>
<TE>   In reviewing the Michigan standards, the court may venture into
one of the most carefully guarded areas of universities: the specific
weight given to race in admissions. School officials often downplay
the importance of race in their selection process, insisting that
race gives only a slight advantage to otherwise equally qualified
students. Yet the same educators insist that if they do not use race
as a factor, minority admissions will plummet. The statistics in
these cases indicate that race remains a very significant factor.</TE>
<TE>   In the Michigan undergraduate admissions process, 20 points are
awarded on the basis of race (for African Americans, Mexican
Americans and Native Americans only). This is eight more points than
the weight given to the SAT score viewed as the standard, objective
ranking for admissions. It is also the difference between a student
with an A average and a student with a B average -- a huge difference
in a top-ranked school.</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, a Georgetown University law student triggered a
controversy when he revealed that the median LSAT score for African
American students was 36, seven points lower than for whites. That
same year, the average score for nonminority students at Texas Law
School was in the 92nd percentile, as opposed to the 55th-percentile
average of African Americans.</TE>
<TE>   These are not slight differences and raise significant questions
as to whether admissions policies are "narrowly tailored" to achieve
a compelling state interest in diversity. Moreover, they belie the
notion that race is a relatively minor element in the admissions
decision.</TE>
<TE>   For a faculty member to even question the fairness of a race-based
criterion is to be seen as the local "Bull" Connor standing in the
path of racial harmony. More important, there is a fear that
criticism could hurt minority students. However, the weight given to
race at Michigan should be cause for concern in a society that
strives to be colorblind. Students outside the selected race groups
can be denied admission on the basis of a status that they cannot
change.</TE>
<TE>   A policy of race-conscious admissions is an easy alternative to
the more difficult task of recruiting more minority applicants and
spending money on high school programs to improve minority education.
Often such programs are adopted only after courts bar the use of
race-conscious admissions. Georgia recently implemented such a
program after its race-conscious admissions process was struck down.
With better recruiting, the state increased the number of minorities
in its 2002 class without the use of the old race-conscious process.
Seven states, including California, have outlawed race as an
admissions factor and are experimenting with programs to increase the
number of minority students.</TE>
<TE>   There is no question that diversity is a vital element in
education, including diversity in religion, age, gender and economic
background. However, when it is artificially engineered, it can
undermine the most essential component of the education process: the
notion that students will be valued by who they are and not what they
represent.</TE>

<LD>Mention flying in the last year and virtually everyone has offered a
personal story about the discouraging, disconcerting inconveniences
of U.S. air travel post-9/11 -- the immovable lines, the
disorganization and disinformation, the imperial delays and rudeness
at security checkpoints. Now, suddenly, another tale to tell: A quick
scan of the nation's new airport screening system over the
Thanksgiving holiday weekend revealed no major problems and an
impressively smooth flow of some 10 million people and many more
carry-ons. And you thought the mall was packed.</LD>
<LD>   Less than a month into federalized screening at the country's 429
airports, more than 30,000 new screeners in their even newer white
shirts offered reassuring hope for similarly smooth, safe travel
during the lengthier holiday season to come. At peak times, long
lines flowed faster than Starbucks' -- under 10 minutes in most
places.</LD>
<TE>   Transportation Security Administration screeners, fresh from 110
hours of training, appeared organized, efficient, even courteous as
they X-rayed, tested, scanned, sniffed and combed through the
handbags, briefcases, backpacks, garment bags, boxes and pockets of
total strangers. They were thorough, seizing potential weapons from a
small percentage of passengers. In return, the screeners got
generally courteous responses from surprised travelers expecting far
worse. Amazing what a little more training and salary and a fresh
perspective can do.</TE>
<TE>   It was a huge task for the security administration to find, screen
and train so many new workers since early summer, all part of a far
larger bureaucratic and mental adjustment to greater security
consciousness. Estimated government spending for security and against
terrorism in the next decade runs about $600 billion, more than four
times the cost of landing men on the moon. Increased security -- and,
what's more important, a sense of increased security -- is essential
in a society that relies so much on mutual trust. More travel
wouldn't hurt the soft economy and struggling airlines either.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond its workforce, the security agency's challenge remains
gargantuan and will be measured ultimately in what does not happen.
We had one safe, smooth holiday week, no small accomplishment. More
tests lie ahead -- all luggage must be screened starting New Year's
Day. Then comes air cargo, still virtually unexamined. So far,
however, hats -- and coats -- off to the diligent security people.
Now, if we can just remember to leave carry-on presents unwrapped
later this month.</TE>

<LD>"Hi. My name is Clive Jackson Jr. I'm 14 years old. I live in Los
Angeles with my mom."</LD>
<LD>   Standing outside the 77th Street police station in South Los
Angeles on Tuesday, Mayor James K. Hahn and Police Chief William J.
Bratton painted a big- picture view of the gang violence plaguing the
city. Cresie Page, the grandmother of a slain teenager, made it
personal.</LD>
<LD>   She read a letter that Clive Jackson Jr. had written to UCLA on
Nov. 13. Eight days later, police say, another teenager known to
belong to a gang fatally shot the popular Crenshaw High School
basketball player outside a Western Avenue doughnut shop.</LD>
<TE>   "I would like to go to UCLA college when I get out of high
school.... I would like to know how to get into college so that I can
get ready."</TE>
<TE>   For the first time since 1996, Los Angeles homicides for a
calendar year have topped 600. Nearly half the killings have taken
place in South L.A. Police say more than half of the city total
involved gang members.</TE>
<TE>   "How can I get into sports? I would like to talk to the coach. I
would also like to know how can you get a scholarship, because I want
to play basketball in the NBA. I would also like to know how to get
to know where classes are. Will the people who have been in college
show you where the classes are before you get started?"</TE>
<TE>   Bratton likened the city's criminal street gangs to the Mafia --
except that Los Angeles' gangs are even worse. New York's
organized-crime families, he said, don't kill 300 people in a single
year.</TE>
<TE>   The police chief called for federal help to go after street gang
kingpins using RICO, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Operations
Act. He promised to work with state prison and probation officials,
and today he will promote Capt. Michael Hillman to deputy chief in
charge of coordinating citywide anti-gang actions -- a much-needed
"gang czar."</TE>
<TE>   "I want to know how much are the books there so I can save up. I
don't want my mom to pay for everything."</TE>
<TE>   The mayor promised a top-to-bottom reevaluation of the city's gang
prevention and intervention programs. He said he would speed up plans
to create regional "cabinets" of city employees to work with
neighborhoods on crime and other problems and described the epidemic
of killings as "our community's call to action" against gangs.</TE>
<TE>   Include the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and this would
be the kind of broad, intergovernmental, communitywide response that
is crucial if all of the city's neighborhoods are to be made safe for
14-year-olds.</TE>
<TE>   "I thank you for your time and I hope to make it there.</TE>
<TE>   Sincerely,</TE>
<TE>   Clive Jackson Jr."</TE>

<LD>The 1969 oil drilling blowout that covered miles of Santa Barbara
beaches with gooey crude oil and filled the front pages nationally
with photos of dying, tar-covered birds is far from forgotten. In
California, the phrase "offshore drilling" is inseparable from that
spill. A federal appeals court even cited it Monday in upholding the
state's authority to review the potential effect if the Bush
administration were to try to allow new drilling in waters off the
coasts of Santa Barbara, Ventura and San Luis Obispo counties. If the
ruling sticks, renewed drilling will be much harder and perhaps
impossible.</LD>
<LD>   State and federal governments have imposed moratoriums on new
leasing in waters off the coast. But the orders do not affect 36
leases issued by the Interior Department in 1968 and 1984, and since
extended. Some wells were drilled, but they were never put into
production. The administration has indicated, over strong California
objections, that it might permit new drilling in the tracts in
federal waters beyond the three-mile state limit.</LD>
<TE>   The administration argued that the state had no authority under
1972's federal Coastal Zone Management Act to review the leases or
prevent their development. Wrong, said the three-judge panel of the
generally liberal 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. Its ruling scathingly
noted that the 1969 spill "might have been avoided but for a failure
of federal oversight." The administration says it may appeal to the
full nine-member court.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, why not stop now? Californians are all but unanimous in
opposing coastal oil drilling. The oil companies are fully aware of
the trouble they'd face when they hauled out the next offshore rig.
Besides, the area is far from an energy bonanza. Much of the oil is
heavy, low-quality crude used mostly to make asphalt.</TE>
<TE>   In passing the 1972 law, Congress made its intent clear, declaring
that one of its purposes is "to encourage and assist the states to
exercise effectively their responsibilities in the coastal zone
through the development and implementation of management programs to
achieve wise use of the land and water resources of the coastal
zone." Nothing can make those words into a federal prerogative to
drill for oil.</TE>
<TE>   The administration bought out similar leases off the coast of
Florida, where President Bush's brother, Jeb, was just reelected
governor. It's not likely to do the same for California.</TE>
<TE>   One practical alternative does exist: Allow the oil companies to
drill in the Gulf of Mexico off the Louisiana coast in exchange for
the California leases. California Democratic Sens. Barbara Boxer and
Dianne Feinstein support such a swap, as does the Louisiana
delegation to Congress. Gulf drilling would probably produce far more
oil than the California leases and would not generate such bitter
opposition. Everyone -- Bush, Louisiana and California -- would win.</TE>

<LD>All the options mentioned in your Nov. 30 editorial about the United
Way's report, "A Tale of Two Cities: Promise and Peril in Los Angeles
County" -- literacy education, affordable housing, child care --
shouldn't depend on government or public intervention. This should be
about encouraging individuals to plan for their futures responsibly.</LD>
<LD>   The overwhelming reason for persistent poverty among the
able-bodied isn't bad luck so much as bad lifestyle choices --
choices that had predictable outcomes. Dropping out of school before
learning marketable skills and discipline is usually the first bad
step. Add to that premature parenthood and family size beyond
personal means. This has sometimes gone on through two or three
generations of families. That is to say nothing about addiction. Then
there's the nonskilled immigrant population. They come with needs to
this overburdened city, spreading the available resources very, very

<LD>Re "Fast Health Reform for L.A.," editorial, Nov. 25: It must be
stated that the Bush administration -- through the leadership of
Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson -- has led the
effort for structural health systems reform and the removal of
disincentives. As they have in Washington, D.C., and St. Louis, these
reforms can and should be replicated on a larger scale in L.A.
County.</LD>
<LD>   Currently, the most significant impediment to reform is the lack
of financial participation by the state. California is ranked 51st
among U.S. states and the District of Columbia in the level of
Medicaid (Medi-Cal) spending per beneficiary. If the state were to
provide a true match for all the federal Medicaid funding that it
draws, there would be sufficient funding available to provide a
stable and accessible health-care system.</LD>
<LD>   Further, reforms must include allowing reimbursements to follow
the patient from inpatient services to outpatient settings through
cost-effective public/private partnerships. Gov. Gray Davis and the
state Legislature must put the health and safety of our citizens
higher on their list of priorities and immediately address the health
crisis in L.A. County.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas will be sorely missed ("Ridley-Thomas'
Elegant Exit," Nov. 27). Few politicians take office with such a
well-defined vision and set out from day one to systematically
implement it. Ridley-Thomas brought economic development to a
district that had been largely abandoned by public and private
investment, doggedly pursuing projects that were mired in controversy
and given little hope of success. Today people can live in or shop in
the developments that resulted.</LD>
<LD>   The broad array of issues he tackled during his tenure on the City
Council is remarkable: Banking, technology, public safety and housing
are just examples. Moreover, he stands up for the things he believes
in, such as civil rights and economic and social justice, even if
doing so doesn't win him any popularity contests.</LD>
<LD>   He has left a tangible legacy in the 8th District. Candidates
vying to replace him will have to demonstrate their ability to keep
the momentum going and build upon the work Ridley-Thomas began. He
will be a tough act to follow.</LD>

<LD>While it is lamentable that the nation is facing a shortage of
qualified teachers in our public schools, I don't believe we should
be too hasty in enacting legislation such as that referred to in a
Nov. 30 letter. I have worked with the California public school
system for 15 years, and while teachers who begin and end their
careers in the system do not get Social Security, their retirement
benefits are, for the most part, superior to private industry. In
fact, teachers with 30 years' service can retire at over 70% of their
highest years' earnings, and that retirement is index-linked. In
addition, California public employees are also provided with very
attractive health and benefit packages while working and at
retirement.</LD>
<LD>   I know a number of retired public employees who are receiving
three or more retirements, one of which is Social Security.</LD>

<LD>Regardless of their claims to the contrary, it's obvious that the
college students engaged in pirating intellectual property know what
they are doing is wrong ("Pirated Files Clog College Networks," Dec.
2).</LD>
<LD>   The students use the classic excuses of any run-of-the-mill
criminal: I'm stealing from wealthy, greedy people, so it's OK;
everyone else is doing it; I steal only occasionally; the product is
overpriced and I cannot afford to pay for it.</LD>
<LD>   The college students know that the only real difference between
their online theft and shoplifting is the risk of being escorted out
of the store in handcuffs.</LD>

<HD>Does Neo-Imperialism Drive U.S. Goals for the Mideast?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In "Beyond Regime Change" (Opinion, Dec. 1) Sandy Tolan brilliantly
argues that U.S. goals in the Mideast include not only overthrowing
Saddam Hussein but ending OPEC's stranglehold, improving our ally
Israel's security and defanging the hostile states of Syria and Iran,
with the hope of liberating their people from tyranny. Oddly, Tolan
seems to be against all of these laudable goals. Am I missing
something?</LD>
<LD>   Ben David Orlanski</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tolan's article is riddled with assertions of insidious links
between members of the Bush administration and various actors
promoting the "neo-imperial" vision of the Middle East. For example,
he quotes at length Patrick Clawson, a scholar advocating occupation
of Iraq for the potential benefits that would accrue to the U.S. oil
industry. And what is the connection between this damning statement,
proving Tolan's speculations, and the Bush camp? Clawson's Washington
Institute for Near East Policy "enjoys close ties to the Bush
administration."</TE>
<TE>   Tolan is pushing the trendy, ultra-leftist theory that oil and
Israel drive all U.S. foreign policy. For example, he declares
"ensuring Israel's continued regional military superiority" to be a
U.S. foreign policy objective, implying that Israel, like the United
States, is motivated by purely aggressive intentions and possesses no
legitimate security interests. Tolan's assertions should be taken
with a grain of salt. Insinuation and distorted facts, because they
are so compelling, can be more dangerous than lies.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Radnitz</TE>
<TE>   La Habra</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The historical failure of imperialism is not a fluke. How sad that
the U.S. has an administration naive enough to give neo-imperialism
another chance, at the behest of Israeli hard-line supporters and
short-term oil interests. How sad that American lives will be wasted
in another futile attempt to take up the "white man's burden" to
force "backward" people to do what's in our interest but not
necessarily what's in their interest.</TE>
<TE>   Terrorism will not be defeated by imperialism. Imperialism is far
more likely to inspire terrorism. The moral ambiguity of imperialism
almost inevitably breeds resistance from those populations whose
support is necessary to defeat terrorism. Morally empowered
populations have usually prevailed in their own territory against
even overwhelming power. Just ask the former imperialists or anyone
old enough to remember Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Finch</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   How about legislation that says that should there be war in Iraq,
and should the American forces win, no American oil company may be
allowed to gain new oil or new oil facilities? The oil should be the
property of the Iraqi people, with income controlled to go for the
education and health of the Iraqi people.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"A Dance of Death for Kenyan Troupe" (Nov. 30) described the terrible
impact on those Kenyans of this recent terrorist attack, both those
who were murdered and those who survived this heinous attack, all for
the purpose of murdering three innocent Israelis, two teenagers and
an elderly man. The income of thousands of Kenyans, in fact their
ability to provide daily food for themselves and their families, was
stolen by these Muslim terrorists.</LD>
<LD>   Of course this is hardly the first time that Kenya and other Third
World nations have been victims of the Arab/Muslim terror. The
bombings of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi -- in which 200 Kenyans were
killed and 5,000 wounded -- and in Bali are only two examples.</LD>
<LD>   Israel, a long-term supporter of the Third World, is clearly not
the only victim of this terror. How long will the Third World, a
frequent victim of this evil, continue to side with such terrorists
and their supporters in the Middle East? Perhaps the professors and
students in American universities who justify, defend and offer their
support to such terror should consider the impact of this terrorism
on the Third World, which they also claim to support. It is time the
world sees these evil murderers for what they are and gives up the
myths created to attempt to defend such evil.</LD>

<LD>Bruno Wintzell, 58, a Swedish opera singer and actor formerly linked
romantically to actress Goldie Hawn, with whom he worked in "The Girl
from Petrovka," died of cancer Sunday in Stockholm.</LD>
<LD>   A native of Bromma, Sweden, Wintzell began his show business
career in 1963 by singing popular music in local amusement parks. He
studied singing in London and Salzburg, Austria, and then began his
opera career.</LD>
<LD>   He also gained acclaim for his work in musical theater, including
a Scandinavian production of "Hair." But his staging of "Jesus Christ
Superstar" in Stockholm was a financial failure, and prompted him to
file for personal bankruptcy protection.</LD>
<TE>   Wintzell's other credits include "Miss and Mrs. Sweden" in 1969,
the television movie "Francis Gary Powers: The True Story of the U-2
Spy Incident" in 1976 and "Animal Protector" in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   Wintzell was with Hawn from 1973 to 1975 after her marriage to
director Gus Trikonis disintegrated.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Donald E. White, 88, a geologist and geothermal expert for the U.S.
Geological Survey in Menlo Park, died of a heart attack Nov. 20 in
Portola Valley, Calif.</LD>
<LD>   A native of Dinuba, Calif., White earned a bachelor's degree at
Stanford University, a doctorate at Princeton University and joined
the U.S. Geological Survey in 1939; he was first stationed in
Newfoundland.</LD>
<LD>   He retired in 1992, when he received his second prestigious
Penrose Medal from the Geological Society of America and the Society
of Economic Geologists.</LD>
<TE>   During his career, White did research on the origin of ore-forming
metals and geothermal processes, particularly in the hot springs
system at Yellowstone National Park. His reputation earned him
invitations to work as a consultant and conduct presentations in more
than 20 countries.</TE>
<TE>   White gained widespread attention in 1985 when he sharply
criticized the Department of Energy's choice of Hanford, Wash., as a
possible nuclear dump site.</TE>
<TE>   As a member of the National Academy of Sciences panel studying
potential sites, he concluded the rock in the area could suddenly
collapse during excavation, and warned of possible radioactive
contamination of the area's drinking water.</TE>

<HD>Edgar Scherick, 78; Movie, TV, Documentary Producer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Claudia Luther</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Edgar J. Scherick, a movie and television producer whose credits
include Woody Allen's first feature film, "Take the Money and Run,"
and being instrumental in bringing "Peyton Place" to ABC-TV, died
Monday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 78.</LD>
<LD>   Scherick died of complications of leukemia, but had suffered a
stroke in 1998 and was mostly bedridden after that. He continued,
however, to put together film and TV projects, including "Path to
War" for HBO this year.</LD>
<LD>   In recent years, his projects also included "The Wall," a trio of
short films focusing on the story behind personal belongings left at
the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, which aired on Showtime
on Memorial Day 1998.</LD>
<TE>   Scherick's interests as a producer were wide and varied. He once
said he was "interested in the human psyche, soul, morality" and that
he wanted to be remembered "for honesty, good taste and courage."</TE>
<TE>   "I never made the traditional movie," he told a journalist. "I
always asked a question of a piece of material: Is it touched by
singularity? If you try to sell the same old rot, it's not going to
work. I looked for subjects that would touch inside me."</TE>
<TE>   Among his feature films are "For Love of Ivy" with Sidney Poitier;
"The Stepford Wives"; "They Shoot Horses, Don't They?" with Jane
Fonda; "Sleuth" with Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine; "The Taking
of Pelham One Two Three" with Walter Matthau; "Shoot the Moon" with
Albert Finney and Diane Keaton; and "Mrs. Soffel," also with Keaton
and Mel Gibson.</TE>
<TE>   Scherick also was executive producer for "Rambling Rose" (1991),
which brought Oscar nominations to mother and daughter actors Diane
Ladd and Laura Dern. Several of his films, including "Sleuth" and
"They Shoot Horses, Don't They?" also received Academy Awards
nominations.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Rudin ("Wonder Boys," "The Truman Show," "Sister Act"), who
was also a producer on "Mrs. Soffel," was among many in the business
who got their starts with Scherick; at the time of Scherick's death,
Rudin was working with him on a remake of "The Stepford Wives."</TE>
<TE>   Scherick's television programs and mini-series, many of which were
nominated for Emmys, are numerous: "The Kennedys of Massachusetts,"
based on Doris Kearns Goodwin's Pulitzer Prize-winning book; "On
Wings of Eagles"; "Little Gloria ... Happy at Last," and "Ruby Ridge:
An American Tragedy," among others. A documentary, "He Makes Me Feel
Like Dancing," won both an Oscar and an Emmy in 1983.</TE>
<TE>   Scherick was born in New York City and grew up in Long Beach, on
the south shore of Long Island, N.Y. After graduating from high
school, Scherick got a job as an office boy at an advertising agency
in New York City and went to City College of New York at night. He
entered the Army in 1943, serving most of his three-year stint
running a weather station in Iceland. When he got out of the service,
he studied economics and English at Harvard.</TE>
<TE>   Scherick, a lifelong sports fan who especially loved fishing and
baseball, claimed to have viewed the first baseball game ever
televised on a TV set in a Long Beach radio store.</TE>
<TE>   He later went to New York City to work in advertising, and was
soon lining up Falstaff beer as the sponsor of broadcasts of the
Chicago White Sox, the New York Giants and other teams. Falstaff also
sponsored "Game of the Week," thought to be the first regular weekly
national telecast of a major league game.</TE>
<TE>   In 1956, Scherick took a job at CBS as a sports specialist but
left the next year to form Sports Programs Inc., which was on the
ground floor of the first great growth of sports on television and
which introduced the iconic "Wide World of Sports" to TV viewers.</TE>
<TE>   Scherick told the New York Times last year that "Wide World" was
created because at that time baseball telecasts had to be blacked out
in major league markets.</TE>
<TE>   "We needed something to go national with," he said. "We needed
sports events that weren't being shown, which were interesting
viewing, which could be taped, and we could put on the air the next
day."</TE>
<TE>   At the head of the firm was a highly creative and volatile
triumvirate composed of Scherick, Chet Simmons, who would later run
NBC Sports and ESPN, and Jack Lubell, a producer-director for Sports
Programs.</TE>
<TE>   "One day, I went into Ed's office, and Jack had Ed pinned against
the wall, and Ed's feet were off the ground," Simmons told a
reporter. "Ed looked over Jack's shoulder and said to me,
'Everything's OK.' They went to war every day."</TE>
<TE>   Scherick's friend Larry Auerbach, a former agent who is now
associate dean of USC's School of Cinema and Television, said
Tuesday, "We all knew and loved him for his talent and his kindness,
but he could get excited. But we all knew that, so we took it with a
little grain of salt."</TE>
<TE>   In 1961, Sports Programs was merged with ABC-TV and became its
sports division.</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, Scherick became vice president in charge of ABC's
programming, where he brought to the network "Batman," "The FBI,"
"Bewitched," "F-Troop," "The Hollywood Palace" and "Peyton Place,"
the first prime-time soap opera. But he occasionally missed: He once
turned down "Get Smart," which went on to be a huge hit.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody's infallible," he said of that decision.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, he formed Palomar Pictures and turned to producing.</TE>
<TE>   Scherick also took credit for giving Tommy Lee Jones, another
Harvard grad, his first crack at a film acting role, and he later
produced a cable movie that Jones directed and co-wrote, "The Good
Old Boys."</TE>
<TE>   Scherick, who was divorced twice, is survived by three sons,
Gregory, Jay and Bradford, all of Los Angeles; a daughter, Christine
O'Brien of Walnut Creek, Calif.; and seven grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Mal Waldron, 77; Pianist Played With Many Jazz Greats</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mal Waldron, a versatile pianist perhaps best known to jazz
enthusiasts for his mainstream work as Billie Holiday's last
accompanist, has died. He was 77.</LD>
<LD>   Waldron died Monday in Brussels of complications from cancer, said
his manager, Rob Leurentop.</LD>
<LD>   In a varied career, Waldron played with some of the giants of
jazz, including bassist Charles Mingus, and recorded with saxophone
legend John Coltrane. He accompanied Holiday from 1957 until her
death in 1959, and in the early 1960s played in a quartet led by
saxophonist Eric Dolphy and trumpeter Booker Little.</LD>
<TE>   Waldron moved to Europe in the 1960s, where he found jazz work
more plentiful and, he told the International Herald Tribune, where
there were fewer restrictions on smoking.</TE>
<TE>   A thin, angular man, Waldron was born in New York City. As a
child, he aspired to be a classical pianist, but he took up the alto
saxophone and began playing jazz. He switched to jazz piano while
attending Queens College at City University of New York, where he
earned a degree in composition.</TE>
<TE>   He worked with various bands in New York after his graduation and
made his first recording with saxophonist Ike Quebec in 1950. He
joined Mingus in 1954 and played with him for several years before
forming his own quintet. He recorded albums for Prestige Records and
then led the house band and arranged for artists such as Coltrane and
trumpeter Art Farmer.</TE>
<TE>   One of Waldron's best-known compositions, "Soul Eyes," was written
for Coltrane. As a composer, Waldron also worked in film and wrote

<HD>Infant Loses Arm in Police Chase Crash</HD>
<DH>Suspects in pursuit in Sylmar crash into SUV. Doctors
unable to reattach child's limb.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Carol Chambers and Andrew Blankstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 2 1/2-week-old boy lost an arm Tuesday after his parents' sport
utility vehicle was broadsided by a car occupied by four men fleeing
police during a short, high-speed pursuit in Sylmar.</LD>
<LD>   Seven people were injured in the 2:30 p.m. crash, including the
infant. The child was airlifted to Childrens Hospital Los Angeles,
where doctors determined they could not reattach his left arm. The
boy was in serious condition with stable vital signs late Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "Besides the injury to his arm, he had some small bleeding around
his brain, but it is not significant," said Dr. James Stein. "We do
expect him to recover, but at the present time he is in serious
condition."</LD>
<TE>   The pursuit began about 2:27 p.m. when Los Angeles police spotted
a blue Chevrolet Corsica that matched the description of one driven
by suspects in a stabbing that had occurred minutes earlier in the
13200 block of Maclay Avenue, LAPD Officer Grace Brady said.</TE>
<TE>   For two minutes, police chased the fleeing suspects until they ran
a red light at Polk Street and Dronfield Avenue and crashed into the
Ford Expedition containing the infant and his parents.</TE>
<TE>   The baby was strapped into a child safety seat when the impact of
the crash crushed a rear door jamb against his arm, ripping it off
above the elbow. "It was a horrific incident," said Capt. Bill Wick
of the Los Angeles Fire Department.</TE>
<TE>   The boy's mother -- described by police as not seriously hurt but
extremely distraught -- accompanied the baby to Childrens Hospital,
police said.</TE>
<TE>   None of the injuries sustained in the crash were considered to be
life-threatening, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   The baby's father, who had to be extricated from the vehicle, was
treated at Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in Santa Clarita and
released. He was flown late Tuesday to Childrens Hospital to be with
his wife and son, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Alejandro Martinez, 26, the driver of the Corsica, was arrested on
suspicion of attempted murder and evading arrest. His three
passengers were questioned by police and released.</TE>
<TE>   The attempted murder charge is based on the stabbing, although the
victim did not require hospitalization. Additional charges in
connection with the pursuit and crash may be considered, said LAPD
spokesman Jason Lee.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD Deputy Chief George Gascon, whose responsibilities include
oversight of training and policy development, said police are still
trying to determine what transpired during the chase in Sylmar.</TE>
<TE>   According to the LAPD's pursuit policy, the senior officer in the
pursuing car has the responsibility of deciding whether to continue a
chase. The officer must weigh the potential threat to bystanders
against the need to make an arrest, taking into account traffic,
pedestrians and the danger posed by the suspect.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time that innocent people get injured it's a tragedy and it's
something we try to prevent," Gascon said. "We want to protect the
community and our officers; consequently we are always evaluating our
training, policies and procedures to ensure that they reflect the
contemporary needs of policing in the L.A. community."</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Police Commission is currently conducting a study
that compares the LAPD's pursuit guidelines with those of other
cities.</TE>
<TE>   Commission President Rick Caruso said it appeared that Tuesday's
chase was in keeping with the department's policy, based on early
indications. Although officials will examine whether officers adhered
to that policy, he stressed that there should be increased prison
time for those who endanger lives by fleeing the police.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to attack this from both sides," Caruso said. "It has to
be a felony with mandatory jail time if you evade police and you end
up injuring an innocent person.</TE>
<TE>   "There has to be a disincentive for doing this," he added.
"Instead, there's an incentive [to flee] because you end up on the
news and walk away from it with a misdemeanor."</TE>
<TE>   The number of police chases and resulting injuries among
pedestrians increased significantly last year, according to Los
Angeles Police Department statistics. Pursuits rose to 769 in 2001
from 597 the previous year. Pedestrian injuries climbed to 69 in
2001, nearly double the number in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   So far this year, there have been several injuries and at least
two deaths in Southern California involving police pursuits.</TE>
<TE>   In June, a 4-year-old girl was killed when an auto-theft suspect
being pursued by Los Angeles police ran a red light on a busy
downtown street, causing a chain-reaction accident that knocked over
a traffic light, crushing the girl.</TE>
<TE>   And in March, an 18-year-old Oxnard woman was killed on Pacific
Coast Highway when a California Highway Patrol cruiser pursuing
another vehicle slammed into the teenager's car.</TE>

<HD>Another Power Struggle for Klamath</HD>
<DH>Much higher electricity rates could hit farmers in region
racked by fight over water rights.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Bailey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>These are bumper crop times in the battle-weary Klamath Basin.
Potatoes are fetching top prices; silos are flush with a bonanza of
wheat. A modicum of calm has returned after 2001 saw the basin riven
by a fierce fight over water and endangered species.</LD>
<LD>   Now a new threat looms for the 212,000-acre agricultural patchwork
on the California-Oregon border: the price of electricity.</LD>
<LD>   Klamath farmers say they expect in the next few years to lose an
energy deal that has given them one of the lowest rates in the
nation. It has helped keep Klamath agriculture alive in tough times
by providing cheap power to pump water and pressurize irrigation
sprinklers for fields lush with peppermint and alfalfa, potatoes and
onions.</LD>
<TE>   If the power deal runs out as expected in 2006, farmers say,
electricity costs could surge by 10 or 15 times. They worry that the
higher rates will send at least some of the basin's 1,200 family
farms -- already weakened by the disastrous 2001 growing season --
cartwheeling toward bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Last year saw "chaos in this basin," said Bill Heiney, a
third-generation farmer near Tulelake, Calif. But big electricity
hikes could wipe out 80% of the basin's profit margin, he said,
adding, "It could cause a whole new level of pain."</TE>
<TE>   While farmers fret, environmentalists see the coming electricity
crisis as an opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   They say it might be wiser to buy out the weakest operators right
now, before the electricity crisis hits. Downsizing agriculture would
not only save farmers from bankruptcy, but also accomplish something
environmental activists have been advocating for years: a drop in
agriculture's water needs, freeing more for Upper Klamath Lake and
the Klamath River, home to endangered sucker fish and salmon.</TE>
<TE>   "You know some of these farmers are going to get mowed down, so
give them a golden parachute," said Jim McCarthy of the Oregon
Natural Resources Council. "It just seems crazy not to let them get
out with their shirts on their backs."</TE>
<TE>   McCarthy argues that the demise of the current power deal also
would be good for ratepayers of PacifiCorp, the Portland, Ore.-based
power provider that serves Klamath.</TE>
<TE>   In a 17-page report for the Oregon environmental group, McCarthy
contends that PacifiCorp's customer base has been subsidizing the
Klamath farmers -- along with the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, which
runs the massive system of canals, gates and pumps that deliver water
to the basin -- at a rate of nearly $10 million annually for the last
five years.</TE>
<TE>   Klamath's electricity prices are roughly half a cent per
kilowatt-hour, McCarthy said; other customers in Oregon and
California pay about five cents.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from low-cost power, the farmers and federal irrigation
project that undergirds them are guaranteed free construction of
utility lines to reach fields and pumps and canals, McCarthy said. In
addition, they avoid fees that are normally placed on agricultural
pumps.</TE>
<TE>   Prices Stable for 85 Years</TE>
<TE>   Klamath Basin farmers, McCarthy said, have not seen an electricity
rate hike in 85 years.</TE>
<TE>   The Bureau of Reclamation likewise has a lot at stake, McCarthy
said. To keep Tulelake from flooding, one big pumping station uses
electric motors totaling 3,540 horsepower to push water through a
one-mile tunnel in a volcanic ridge west of town. The 11 million
kilowatt-hours of electricity used each year costs $40,000. If rates
rise much, McCarthy predicts, the cost could soar to more than
$600,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   Klamath's power contract dates to 1917, when PacifiCorp's
predecessor -- the California and Oregon Power Co. -- crafted a deal
with the federal government to build a dam at the outlet of Upper
Klamath Lake, headwaters to the Klamath River. The power company
essentially got the run of the river for hydropower; the government
in exchange got cheap electricity for its budding Klamath irrigation
project.</TE>
<TE>   PacifiCorp and the federal government negotiated the current
50-year deal in 1956. Over the next few years, the power company
built several hydroelectric dams to fully tap the river's muscle.</TE>
<TE>   Problems began for PacifiCorp when two species of sucker fish were
declared endangered in Upper Klamath Lake in 1992. Soon after, the
Klamath River coho salmon hit the endangered list. Suddenly, river
flows -- traditionally increased during hot summer days to generate
more kilowatts -- were being dictated not by power needs, but by the
needs of the fish.</TE>
<TE>   The ability to generate peak power has today "largely gone away,"
said Dave Kvamme, a PacifiCorp spokesman. "There's always a tension
about providing water for one species or another."</TE>
<TE>   He said company officials don't envision sitting down at the
bargaining table soon. When they do, Kvamme said, "We're going to be
looking at what value there is in this for the rest of our
customers."</TE>
<TE>   Jeff McCracken, a Bureau of Reclamation spokesman, declined to
speculate on where it could all be headed, saying it would be akin to
"predicting which car you're going to buy in 2006." He said the
energy contract might be "looped" into the federal government's
negotiations with PacifiCorp over relicensing of its dams on the
Klamath.</TE>
<TE>   Kvamme said the dam relicensing is a separate issue. But farmers
argue that the power company is fully aware of the support the
growers and Bureau of Reclamation can provide in the relicensing
process.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a little back scratching that has to go on between both
sides," said Monte Seus, a Klamath farmer.</TE>
<TE>   Rates Certain to Rise</TE>
<TE>   Even if a deal with PacifiCorp is crafted, Seus and others say
it's a virtual certainty that Klamath's rates will rise. In the
aftermath of last year's energy crisis across the Western U.S.,
public utility commissions in California and Oregon are unlikely to
approve a preferential deal. "At this point, PacifiCorp is selling to
us cheap," Seus said. "They're businesspeople, and if they can send
that power to Los Angeles and make more, that's what they'll do."</TE>
<TE>   Facing that reality, the Klamath Water Users Assn. and various
irrigation districts in the basin have been mulling solutions.</TE>
<TE>   Possible new energy sources being reviewed include wind generation
(the basin is often hit by stiff breezes) and biomass energy. Fuel
could come from excess straw and the juniper trees that are
proliferating across eastern Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the next two years, we're going to be making a very
concerted effort to prepare for 2006," said Dan Keppen, executive
director of the Klamath Water Users Assn. "If some of our foes think
an electrical rate increase is going to be the end of us, they're
sadly mistaken."</TE>
<TE>   Farm Towns Threatened</TE>
<TE>   Leaders among the Klamath farmers balk at the idea of retiring
farmland from active agricultural use. They contend that a shrinking
agricultural pool would be the death of farm towns like Tulelake and
Merrill, Ore. Without a critical mass of farmland in active
production, agricultural support industries -- from tractor dealers
to grain silos -- couldn't afford to stay open.</TE>
<TE>   "We've seen that sort of thing in other areas, picking off farms
one or two or three at a time," said Bob Gasser, a Merrill fertilizer
dealer. "It guts the community from the inside out."</TE>
<TE>   Some farmers already are beginning to prepare for what they
consider the inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   Seus sees no other way. If electricity rates climb 15 times what
they are now, his current costs of about $25,000 a year would jump to
$400,000 annually, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "There isn't $400,000 extra profit in my farm to do that," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   He already has begun leveling his fields to pool-table flatness to
improve the spread of water. Seus, one of the nation's largest
producers of horseradish, also has started installing low-pressure
sprinkler nozzles that use less energy. He hopes to cut his power use
in half.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration, always eager to help out a bedrock rural
constituency, has for the last two years made the plight of the
Klamath farmers a top priority.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists say there remains the possibility that the
administration and the Republican Congress could push financing
relief for the coming power crisis, though the federal budget's
brimming red ink might nix that approach.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of "propping up a broken system," McCarthy said, the Bush
administration and Congress should craft a deal to help the weakest
farmers before they go belly-up. The resulting surge of water for the
fish would be a bonus. "We're a wealthy country," he said. "We can
correct our mistakes in a humane and equitable way."</TE>

<HD>Davis Hints at Major School Cuts</HD>
<DH>Education would be one part of plan to narrow expected
$21-billion deficit by more than $5 billion. Teachers union calls
idea 'devastating.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Evan Halper and Dan Morain</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis said Tuesday that he will release a proposal by the
end of the week to narrow the state's projected budget shortfall with
substantially more than the $5 billion in cuts he had earlier
promised, and suggested that school spending could be cut.</LD>
<LD>   After meeting with legislative leaders, the governor said he
intends to offer the cuts as a partial solution to the anticipated
$21-billion-plus budget gap, and he formally called the Legislature
to the Capitol for a special session beginning Monday to address the
shortfall.</LD>
<LD>   Though Davis would not say specifically that he will propose to
cut $1.9 billion from education as suggested by the nonpartisan
legislative analyst's office, he noted that the state spends nearly
half its general fund on public schools.</LD>
<TE>   "We have to solve this problem," Davis said. "Education is a huge
part of the budget. We have to find savings where we can find them."</TE>
<TE>   Legislators and lobbyists for public schools said they anticipate
cuts; some said administration officials informed them privately to
expect them.</TE>
<TE>   "The administration clearly signaled to us that they intend to
pursue the full $1.9 billion," said Kevin Gordon, executive director
of the California Assn. for School Business Officials. "We do not
believe it is mathematically or physically possible to extract that
kind of money out of schools in the middle of the year."</TE>
<TE>   Education lobbyists are mobilizing to resist a large reduction.
"It would be devastating to our schools," said Steve Hopcraft,
spokesman for the California Federation of Teachers. "We are going to
have at it."</TE>
<TE>   The legislative analyst's office first said in a report last month
that schools are receiving $1.9 billion more than the state must
spend under the complex financing system established by the
voter-approved Proposition 98 of 1988. The $1.9 billion represents
about 6% of the roughly $31 billion that the state will spend on
public schools and community colleges from the general fund in the
2002-03 budget.</TE>
<TE>   Although rescinding that amount would help close the budget gap,
Davis would be opening his second term by battling the powerful
education lobby. He also would be presiding over education budget
cuts after having touted education spending increases repeatedly
during his first term, saying that schools are his "first, second and
third" priorities.</TE>
<TE>   Hopcraft said a $1.9-billion cut would hit the schools hard. A
reduction of that amount could be attained by laying off 35,000
teachers or by closing every public school for two weeks, he said.
School groups will launch their public campaign against the cuts with
a news conference Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Legislators are bracing for the battle.</TE>
<TE>   Assembly Education Committee Chairwoman Jackie Goldberg (D-Los
Angeles) said it's possible that Assembly Democrats would balk at
such cuts. But she predicted that lawmakers will end up approving
them.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it is a terrible idea -- but I think it is going to
happen," Goldberg said. "Can you cut things and not include education
when you've got $20 billion to cut? The answer is no."</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg, a former Los Angeles Unified School District board
member, said she expects that schools can shave spending this year by
cutting staff training and textbook purchases, adding: "You have less
well-trained staff and fewer books per kid, but you can survive." But
given the state's education funding system, the reduction would have
a ripple effect next year, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "In the second year," Goldberg said, "you will see something
dramatic."</TE>
<TE>   Senate Republican Leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga said some
Republicans will vote for the cuts "if the governor proposes that."</TE>
<TE>   Assembly leaders were more skeptical.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think Assembly Democrats are going to agree to do
anything until we know what the entire package is," said Assembly
Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City). Assembly Republican Leader Dave
Cox of Fair Oaks said lawmakers will have a difficult time reducing
the current school budget by $1.9 billion because "a significant
portion already has been spent."</TE>
<TE>   Legislative leaders attending the closed-door meeting Tuesday
described the talks as cordial. Davis offered no specifics on the
cuts and said he will unveil reductions Friday.</TE>

<HD>Real Estate Bias Case Tests Court</HD>
<DH>U.S. justices appear split on whether a California broker
can be liable for discrimination by agent.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David G. Savage</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The justices of the U.S. Supreme Court struggled Tuesday to decide
whether real estate brokers can be held liable for racial
discrimination by their agents in a California case that pits the
real estate industry against civil rights lawyers.</LD>
<LD>   The Fair Housing Act forbids racial bias in the selling or renting
of homes, but it remains unclear whether brokers and owners of real
estate firms can be held liable for it.</LD>
<LD>   By their comments and questions during Tuesday's oral arguments,
the justices indicated that they are unsure of the answer.</LD>
<TE>   "Under California law, the broker is the principal," said Justice
Anthony M. Kennedy, a native of Sacramento. With that authority comes
the legal duty to supervise agents, he suggested.</TE>
<TE>   But Justice Antonin Scalia questioned whether a broker can be held
personally liable when he works for a real estate firm.</TE>
<TE>   "Does a designated broker exercise control [over agents] as an
individual or as a supervisor?" Scalia asked. "As I understand
California law, he only uses that license as an officer of the
corporation."</TE>
<TE>   The split between Kennedy and Scalia highlighted the key issue in
a housing bias case from Twentynine Palms.</TE>
<TE>   Mary and Dave Holley, an interracial couple, set out to buy a new
house in 1996 and had the money to pay the full asking price of
$145,000. But they were allegedly turned away by agents of Triad
Realtors in Twentynine Palms. Brooks Bauer, the builder who lost the
sale, said one agent, Grove Crank, dismissed the Holleys as a
"salt-and-pepper team."</TE>
<TE>   The Holleys and Bauer sued the agent and Triad Realtors for racial
discrimination. When they learned that the agent and Triad had no
assets, they amended their suit to include Dave Meyer, then Triad's
owner and broker.</TE>
<TE>   A federal judge in Los Angeles ruled that Meyer cannot be held
liable for what Crank did. Last year, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of
Appeals disagreed and said victims of proven bias can win damages
from those who direct or control the sale of real estate.</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court heard Meyer's appeal Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   His lawyer urged the court to throw out the case against his
client and to say corporate officials cannot be forced to pay
personally for the acts of their employees.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Crank was acting on behalf of Triad. He was not acting on
behalf of Mr. Meyer," said Douglas G. Benedon, an attorney in
Woodland Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Scalia said he agreed. "What's the use of having a corporation
then?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   But Kennedy stressed that real estate law in California puts the
duty to supervise on the individual broker, not a corporation.</TE>
<TE>   The Holleys' plight was not discussed during the argument, though
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg alluded to it. She told Meyer's lawyer
that the victims of bias would be left empty-handed if real estate
brokers are shielded entirely. "Under your theory, there is no relief
for the plaintiffs," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The lawyer for the Holleys insisted that real estate law in
California and 38 states says the licensed broker bears the legal
responsibility for the acts of his agents.</TE>
<TE>   Robert G. Schwemm, a University of Kentucky law professor who
argued for the Holleys, read the state form that Meyer signed
allowing Crank to work as a real estate agent.</TE>
<TE>   "He signed the letter for him. It says [Meyer] is the responsible
human being, and that makes him liable," Schwemm said.</TE>
<TE>   A Bush administration lawyer argued that Meyer can be held liable,
but not just because he is a licensed broker.</TE>
<TE>   He was also the owner of Triad and the president of the
corporation, according to the legal complaint filed by the Holleys.</TE>
<TE>   "Taken together, these facts show Mr. Meyer exercised pervasive
control of the company. And he negligently supervised Mr. Crank,"
Malcolm L. Stewart, an assistant to the solicitor general, told the
court.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart urged the court to allow the claim against Meyer to go
forward in a trial in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The justices will meet behind closed doors to decide the case of
Meyer vs. Holley. A ruling can be expected in several months.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Area Near Airport to Join Newport Beach</HD>
<DH>The east side of Santa Ana Heights becomes part of the city
in July. Some west-side residents are fighting annexation by Costa
Mesa.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Reyes</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After decades of debate, residents in an unincorporated community
that is under the takeoff pattern of John Wayne Airport will get what
they've long wanted -- a Newport Beach address.</LD>
<LD>   The east side of Santa Ana Heights, at the top of Upper Newport
Bay, will officially become part of Newport Beach in July.</LD>
<LD>   But residents of the county island's west side are uncertain of
their fate. One west-side tract prefers to become part of Newport
Beach while another is opposing a push to be taken over by Costa Mesa
-- hoping to remain unincorporated instead.</LD>
<TE>   The east Santa Ana Heights action marks a significant step in the
county's effort to cede control of dozens of unincorporated islands
to adjacent cities. County officials contend the municipalities can
more efficiently provide services such as police protection and
street sweeping.</TE>
<TE>   Homer Bludau, Newport Beach city manager, called the annexation
one of those "good government" ideas because it will bring increased
services to residents.</TE>
<TE>   "In some instances, those people who had problems, they didn't
know who to call for service," Bludau said.</TE>
<TE>   Often it would mean talking to two or three people before reaching
the right county department, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The annexation could come initially as a cost to Newport Beach,
since the city will have to increase services to cover the community
-- an expense that will exceed property tax revenue from the area,
Bludau said. However, because there is a redevelopment zone in the
community, there is "some sales tax" the city can generate.</TE>
<TE>   Ann Watt, who moved to east Santa Ana Heights in 1991, expressed
satisfaction with becoming a Newport Beach resident. "We're happy,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed annexation area adds about 1,400 residents to Newport
Beach. The area includes east Santa Ana Heights and the Bay Knolls
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   However, Watt's neighbors in west Santa Ana Heights who protested
an annexation attempt by Costa Mesa must wait on the outcome of a
signature count, which is expected Thursday. If more than 50% of the
registered voters in the area signed protests, the Costa Mesa
proposal is dead.</TE>
<TE>   For nearly 30 years, Santa Ana Heights had fought annexation
proposals.</TE>
<TE>   Residents said they wanted to keep the community intact and
preserve its rural flavor; residents rode horses along the roads.</TE>
<TE>   Longtime resident Robert B. Hanley said Santa Ana Heights
residents in general resented the idea of dividing the community,
with Newport Beach taking the east and Costa Mesa grabbing the west.</TE>
<TE>   Through the years, Santa Ana Heights residents have shared the
same water company, specific plan and redevelopment area.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to remember that in the early days, Santa Ana was the
premier city in Orange County," Hanley said.</TE>
<TE>   "Costa Mesa was small by comparison, and Newport Beach was just a
small landing that slowly worked its way inland."</TE>
<TE>   He said residents enjoyed their relatively rural life and later
joined Newport Beach in that city's battle to slow growth at John
Wayne Airport by pushing for an international airport at the former
El Toro Marine Base.</TE>

<HD>Carson Mayor Plans to Remain in Office</HD>
<DH>Sweeney will continue to perform his duties while preparing
defense for corruption charges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean Merl</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Carson Mayor Daryl Sweeney, indicted last month on corruption
charges, said Tuesday he will stay in office while defending himself
in court.</LD>
<LD>   "After much thought and many prayers, I have come to the
conclusion that I can continue to effectively govern this city with
the help of God and my many supporters, and with my attorneys here
beside me working to clear my good name," Sweeney said at a brief
news conference in the town's community center.</LD>
<LD>   It was Sweeney's first public comment since he and several others,
including one current and two former members of the Carson City
Council, were charged in connection with a bribery and extortion
probe.</LD>
<TE>   Sweeney, 45, the part-time mayor who serves as chief of staff for
Los Angeles City Councilwoman Jan Perry, was portrayed in a grand
jury indictment as the ringleader of the alleged corruption.
Prosecutors say that he saw the award of a multiyear garbage contract
as a "long-term opportunity" for council members to collect
six-figure supplements to their incomes.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the mayor, flanked by two of his attorneys, his pastor
and several other supporters, read a short statement and did not
answer questions. Attorneys John E. Sweeney (a distant relation) and
Richard M. Steingard said they had urged Sweeney to hold the news
conference in hopes that reporters would stop camping out on his
doorstep.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor said many supporters had asked him to remain in office.
"I've had to give consideration to whether the effort needed to clear
my good name will distract me," he said. But because he took a leave
of absence from his job with Perry when the indictments were issued,
and because his attorneys will handle the details of his defense
preparation, Sweeney said, he plans to devote most of his time to his
mayoral job.</TE>
<TE>   He also asked people to "please reserve judgment until all of the
facts are revealed. I am confident that I will be exonerated of these
charges."</TE>
<TE>   His attorneys said he will plead not guilty at his arraignment on
Monday.</TE>

<HD>Infant Loses Arm in Police Chase Crash</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Carol Chambers and Andrew Blankstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 2 1/2-week-old boy lost an arm Tuesday after his parents' sport
utility vehicle was broadsided by a car occupied by four men fleeing
police during a short, high-speed pursuit in Sylmar.</LD>
<LD>   Seven people were injured in the 2:30 p.m. crash, including the
infant. The child was airlifted to Childrens Hospital Los Angeles,
where doctors determined they could not reattach his left arm. The
boy was in serious condition with stable vital signs late Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "Besides the injury to his arm, he had some small bleeding around
his brain, but it is not significant," said Dr. James Stein. "We do
expect him to recover, but at the present time he is in serious
condition."</LD>
<TE>   The pursuit began about 2:27 p.m. when Los Angeles police spotted
a blue Chevrolet Corsica that matched the description of one driven
by suspects in a stabbing that had occurred minutes earlier in the
13200 block of Maclay Avenue, LAPD Officer Grace Brady said.</TE>
<TE>   For two minutes, police chased the fleeing suspects until they ran
a red light at Polk Street and Dronfield Avenue and crashed into the
Ford Expedition containing the infant and his parents.</TE>
<TE>   The baby was strapped into a child safety seat when the impact of
the crash crushed a rear door jamb against his arm, ripping it off
above the elbow. "It was a horrific incident," said Capt. Bill Wick
of the Los Angeles Fire Department. "It does appear that the
[suspects'] car was traveling at a high rate of speed."</TE>
<TE>   The boy's mother -- described by police as not seriously hurt but
extremely distraught -- accompanied the baby to Childrens Hospital,
police said.</TE>
<TE>   None of the injuries sustained in the crash were considered to be
life-threatening, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   The baby's father, who had to be extricated from the vehicle, was
treated at Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in Santa Clarita and
released. He was flown late Tuesday to Childrens Hospital to be with
his wife and son, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Alejandro Martinez, 26, the driver of the Corsica, was arrested on
suspicion of attempted murder and evading arrest. His three
passengers were questioned by police and released.</TE>
<TE>   The attempted murder charge is based on the stabbing, although the
victim did not require hospitalization. Additional charges in
connection with the pursuit and crash may be considered, said LAPD
spokesman Jason Lee.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD Deputy Chief George Gascon, whose responsibilities include
oversight of training and policy development, said police are still
trying to determine what transpired during the chase in Sylmar.</TE>
<TE>   According to the LAPD's pursuit policy, the senior officer in the
pursuing car has the responsibility of deciding whether to continue a
chase.</TE>
<TE>   The officer must weigh the potential threat to bystanders against
the need to make an arrest, taking into account traffic, pedestrians
and the danger posed by the suspect.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time that innocent people get injured it's a tragedy and it's
something we try to prevent," Gascon said. "We want to protect the
community and our officers; consequently we are always evaluating our
training, policies and procedures to ensure that they reflect the
contemporary needs of policing in the L.A. community."</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Police Commission is currently conducting a study
that compares the LAPD's pursuit guidelines with those of other
cities.</TE>
<TE>   Commission President Rick Caruso said it appeared that Tuesday's
chase was in keeping with the department's policy, based on early
indications. Although officials will examine whether officers adhered
to that policy, he stressed that there should be increased prison
time for those who endanger lives by fleeing the police.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to attack this from both sides," Caruso said. "It has to
be a felony with mandatory jail time if you evade police and you end
up injuring an innocent person.</TE>
<TE>   "There has to be a disincentive for doing this," he added.
"Instead, there's an incentive [to flee] because you end up on the
news and walk away from it with a misdemeanor."</TE>
<TE>   The number of police chases and resulting injuries among
pedestrians increased significantly last year, according to Los
Angeles Police Department statistics.</TE>
<TE>   Pursuits rose to 769 in 2001 from 597 the previous year.
Pedestrian injuries climbed to 69 in 2001, nearly double the number
in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   So far this year, there have been several injuries and at least
two deaths in Southern California involving police pursuits.</TE>

<HD>Unlocking the Secrets of Ancient Papyrus</HD>
<DH>UC Berkeley scholars are studying the texts for clues to
life in Egypt thousands of years ago.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jessica M. Scully</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>BERKELEY</DL>
<LD>Muttering softly, Todd Hickey peered into the screen of his laptop
computer at a black-and-white digital image of a tattered
1,900-year-old Egyptian papyrus document. He was trying to puzzle out
what words might lie in a gap between torn edges.</LD>
<LD>   The last word Hickey could read was "Soknebtunis," the name of a
crocodile god once worshipped by the Egyptians, and a clue that the
house whose sale or loan is described had been next to the god's
temple. Hickey and a computer database that provides word sequences
in early Greek kept coming up with "megalou-megalou," or
"great-great," to follow. But the words were too long to fit.</LD>
<LD>   "Some people do the crossword puzzles," Hickey said, searching for
a better fit. "I could sit and do this stuff all day and not get
tired of it."</LD>
<TE>   But these days the 35-year-old papyrologist, or papyrus
specialist, has a lot more to do than just translation. As the
curator of the Tebtunis Papyri, a collection of ancient papyrus
documents recognized as one of the best in the United States, Hickey
has a lot of other responsibilities for making sure it is preserved,
well-funded and connected to UC classes.</TE>
<TE>   The collection was unearthed about a century ago by British
archeologists backed by philanthropist Phoebe Apperson Hearst, mother
of media tycoon William Randolph Hearst. But only 5% of the documents
have been studied or translated. An even smaller percentage has been
properly restored. The rest remain at UC Berkeley's Bancroft Library,
often sandwiched between pages of the Oxford University Gazette or
loose, like chunks of ancient bark, in battered old boxes.</TE>
<TE>   The collection is undergoing a rebirth. Badly needed restoration
has begun and a center to study the papyri is being funded by the
National Endowment for the Humanities, UC funds and donations. The
center is trying to establish a $1.25-million permanent endowment.</TE>
<TE>   Hickey says it will take lifetimes to learn all the documents have
to offer.</TE>
<TE>   Other universities, including the University of Michigan, Duke and
Columbia, have papyrus collections. But because of its size and
completeness, Berkeley's is one of the best, according to Traianos
Gagos, president of the American Society of Papyrology and curator of
Michigan's collection.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike most other collections, which were compiled piece by piece
from dealers with little knowledge of their origin, Berkeley's entire
collection is from one site: the archeologically rich southwest
corner of the Fayum Basin of Egypt. The area was called Tebtunis in
ancient days.</TE>
<TE>   The collection holds a nearly complete picture of life there 2,300
to 1,600 years ago. The Fayum Basin was a breadbasket and attracted
Greek and Roman rulers. But around AD 300, the desert started to
encroach and the farmers went elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Though the desert was a disaster for ancient people, it was a boon
for Oxford University archeologists Bernard Grenfell and Arthur Hunt
and Egyptologist George Reisner, who had persuaded Hearst to fund the
trip for UC's collections.</TE>
<TE>   The desert heat had preserved the artifacts and documents under
sand, including crocodile and cat mummies, human portraits on wood,
writing tables, jewelry and many papyrus documents.</TE>
<TE>   The were largely forgotten until a Dutch papyrologist named Arthur
Verhoogt came to Berkeley in 1993 to study the works of an ancient
scribe named Menches.</TE>
<TE>   Verhoogt thought that everything useful had been translated. His
first glimpse of virtually untouched documents was an awakening. "I
was flabbergasted ... that there was so much material still to be
worked on," said Verhoogt, now a University of Michigan assistant
professor of papyrology and Greek.</TE>
<TE>   Along with Bancroft's rare book curator, Anthony Bliss, Verhoogt
applied for a federal grant to conserve the documents and to join
five other universities in putting digital photos online. In 2000, UC
kicked in $45,000 annually for as much as 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Most documents are in Greek or Latin. Some are in Demotic, an
ancient Egyptian language.</TE>
<TE>   Fragments of a copy of a long-lost play by the Greek playwright
Sophocles have been found. But for Hickey, the tax documents,
marriage certificates and letters from slaves or former slaves are
the real treasures.</TE>
<TE>   In reading them, "You get a sense of shared humanity, a sense that
certain things have changed but there are some things that haven't
changed over 2,000 years about human nature," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In one letter with frayed edges and a large, sloppy hand, a
servant or slave named Aphrodite writes to her boss: "Do not think,
mistress, that I am negligent of your commands." She lists her
completed chores, including fetching a shirt and running errands.</TE>
<TE>   In a misguided attempt at preservation, a papyrologist in the
1940s encased 1,700 of the documents in flexible plastic. Over the
years, the plastic caused bits of papyrus and writing to flake off.
The situation worsened when the plastic was removed. But better ways
have been found to remount the documents in safer glass, albeit at a
slow pace.</TE>
<TE>   Since arriving in June 2001, Hickey has tried to bring some order
to the collection. He offers community presentations. He is starting
a new class on translating the documents in the spring. He has four
undergraduate students, one volunteer, two graduate students and a
high school student steadily pecking away at the mound of documents.</TE>
<TE>   Brigit Flannery, 26, a doctoral student in ancient history and
Mediterranean archeology, came to Berkeley specifically to study the
papyri.</TE>
<TE>   Flannery is focusing on one scribe. His name isn't known, so she
calls him "Scribe X." But she knows his handwriting: a thin, spidery
but elegant Demotic.</TE>
<TE>   Flannery believes the documents could prove or disprove theories
about ancient Egypt.</TE>
<TE>   "The proof is available," she said as she picked through boxes
filled with tiny bits of papyrus. "We just need to look at it."</TE>

<HD>O.C. Supervisor Accuses Rival of Trickery</HD>
<DH>Cynthia Coad says Todd Spitzer, who was elected to
Assembly, quit board early to foil her husband's bid for his seat.
Spitzer denies it.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County Board of Supervisors Chairwoman Cynthia P. Coad on
Tuesday refused to support a Jan. 28 special election to fill former
Supervisor Todd Spitzer's vacant board seat, slamming her former
colleague in the process.</LD>
<LD>   Coad accused Spitzer of timing his resignation last month to kill
an attempt by her husband, Tom, to run for the 3rd District seat.</LD>
<LD>   "The early resignation was a calculated trick to thwart Tom Coad's
candidacy," she said. "I trust that my abstention will serve to point
out how hypocritical some people and politicians can be."</LD>
<TE>   The remaining three supervisors voted to set the special election.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer, who was elected Nov. 5 to the 71st District seat in the
state Assembly, resigned from county office at his last board
meeting, Nov. 19.</TE>
<TE>   That pushed back the residency requirement to fill his seat,
meaning Tom Coad's voter registration form for his move to Spitzer's
former district needed to be postmarked by Nov. 16. He dropped it in
the mail one day too late, Nov. 17.</TE>
<TE>   Had Spitzer resigned when he was sworn in Monday, Tom Coad could
have run for the county board. Coad is a retired dentist who has
worked as an unpaid advisor to his wife.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer, who had new-member training in Sacramento on Tuesday,
denied any attempt to kill Coad's candidacy, saying he resigned to
save the county money.</TE>
<TE>   "The day after the election, I was already in Sacramento working
with the Republican Caucus to address the largest budget deficit in
state history," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Why in the world should I draw a salary and take advantage of the
taxpayers of Orange County while no longer performing the work of a
supervisor?"</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer said he had no way of knowing when Tom Coad had mailed his
registration form.</TE>
<TE>   "The citizens elected me to solve state problems, not to do the
Coads' homework for them," he said. "They have only themselves to
blame."</TE>

<LD>Two Huntington Beach men were killed and a third was seriously
injured early Tuesday when their convertible spun out of control,
flipped and slammed into a tree near the Westminster Mall,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Paul Munoz and Edward Keith Rogers, both 18, were killed
at the scene, police said. Passenger Jerome Martin, also 18 and of
Huntington Beach, was airlifted to UCI Medical Center in Orange where
he was in serious condition with fractures in both legs, hospital
spokeswoman Kim Pine said.</LD>
<LD>   The Chrysler sedan was seen traveling at "excessive speeds" on
Edwards Street just before it crashed near Mar Vista Drive shortly
after 3 a.m., said Westminster Police Lt. Bill Lewis. Munoz was the
driver, he said.</LD>
<TE>   Munoz apparently died from injuries and Rogers died of
asphyxiation, a spokesman for the Orange County coroner's office
said. The three friends had graduated last summer from Huntington
Beach's Marina High School, where former classmates expressed horror
over the accident.</TE>
<TE>   "This upsets me ... because here are guys who were my classmen --
my age -- and are now dead," said senior Joe Lordanich, 18.</TE>
<TE>   Sean Evans, 17, who played on the Marina High School football team
with Rogers last year, mourned Rogers' death.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a really nice guy," Evans said. "He liked to smile a lot
and was very sociable and funny. He always loved to tell silly
jokes."</TE>
<TE>   The single-vehicle accident was not believed to have been
connected to drag racing or alcohol, police said.</TE>
<TE>   The wreckage and investigation tangled traffic on a section of
Edwards Street for at least six hours Tuesday.</TE>

<HD>County Denies Funding for Anti-Gang Unit</HD>
<DH>Board's action leaves program dependent upon finding money
from foundations or elsewhere within the D.A.'s budget.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Polakovic</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A special anti-gang unit in Ventura County will have to continue to
beg for money after the Board of Supervisors declined Tuesday to make
emergency funds available for the program, which has drawn praise for
curbing street violence.</LD>
<LD>   While Ventura County remains one of the safest areas in the
nation, finding money to pay for the program is proving increasingly
difficult as local governments confront a worsening state budget
crisis. The supervisors concluded the program is vital but declined
to ensure its survival.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not in favor of funding this at this time, but it's a high
priority," Supervisor Judy Mikels said. "We may not always be able to
offer Cadillac service, but we will offer citizens of our county the
best service within our means."</LD>
<TE>   The supervisors directed county officials to work with the
district attorney's office to identify new revenues to pay for the
program.</TE>
<TE>   Anticipating similar requests from other departments, the board
asked County Executive Officer Johnny Johnston to develop a priority
list of programs that may soon come before the board seeking money.</TE>
<TE>   In doing so, the board turned back an impassioned and compelling
plea from Dist. Atty. Greg Totten, who is facing his first
significant fiscal crisis only one month into his term.</TE>
<TE>   Totten urged the board to dip into contingency funds to cover a
$128,100 shortfall to pay for prosecutors who specialize in anti-gang
cases in Ventura and Oxnard. State funds for the program have been
cut by 37% as California faces a budget deficit that could reach $30
billion next year.</TE>
<TE>   Totten said 250 hard-core gang members are prosecuted each year
under the program, which he credits for helping keep crime down in
the county.</TE>
<TE>   He pledged to continue to prosecute gang offenders but said the
effort would be compromised if not handled by prosecutors with
extensive experience in such cases.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a vital program," Totten told the board. "It's making a
difference in the community. It's protecting people."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Frank Schillo was prepared to approve the needed funds,
but the other four board members balked.</TE>
<TE>   They cited the board's long-standing policy to allow grant
programs to expire once funds run out.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors directed Johnston to help find funding, possibly from
foundations, local governments or elsewhere in the district
attorney's budget, to pay for the program.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Traffic deaths on the state's roads during the Thanksgiving holiday
weekend increased over the toll from last year's holiday, with more
than half blamed on drivers and passengers not wearing seat belts,
California Highway Patrol officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Forty-nine people died in crashes between Wednesday evening and
Sunday night. Last year, the number was 39.</LD>
<LD>   The last time there were more deaths over the Thanksgiving weekend
was 1997, when 54 people died in traffic.</LD>
<TE>   Of this year's total, 29 deaths occurred in unincorporated areas
patrolled by the CHP. Eighteen of those people were not strapped in,
the CHP said.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing that concerns us more than anything else is that [most]
of the vehicle occupants killed [in unincorporated areas] were not
wearing safety belts," said CHP headquarters spokesman Officer Steve
Kohler.</TE>
<TE>   CHP officials said arrests over the weekend for driving under the
influence totaled 1,444. Last year's figure was 1,278.</TE>

<HD>Firms Tied to Officials Win DWP Contracts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Commissioners who oversee the Los Angeles Department of Water and
Power voted unanimously Tuesday to award a $1.25-million litigation
contract to two law firms associated with former Mayor Richard
Riordan and former Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg.</LD>
<LD>   The commission granted the contract to Riordan &amp; McKinzie and
Mayer, Brown, Row &amp; Maw at the request of the city attorney's office.</LD>
<LD>   Hertzberg's firm -- Mayer, Brown, Row &amp; Maw -- is set to assist
city lawyers in defending the DWP against allegations that it gouged
state ratepayers during the energy crisis. (Hertzberg, whose
legislative term recently ended, became a partner in the firm last
week.)</LD>
<TE>   Riordan &amp; McKinzie, meanwhile, will work with City Atty. Rocky
Delgadillo's office on litigation against Reliant Energy Services.
The city is suing Houston-based Reliant, claiming it engaged in
practices that drove up the price of natural gas.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan helped found Riordan &amp; McKinzie but he no longer works for
the firm.</TE>
<TE>   DWP General Manager David Wiggs said Delgadillo's office picked
the two law firms from a field of 14 that responded to an ad the city
placed in a legal newspaper. Wiggs presented the five DWP
commissioners with a memo urging them to approve the city attorney's
selection. Commissioners voted 5 to 0 to approve the contract.</TE>
<TE>   "Of the firms interviewed, Mayer stood out to provide assistance
in the areas of antitrust and unfair competition," according to
Wiggs' memo. "Riordan has current experience in horizontal natural
gas price fixing, including but not limited to natural gas
transactions and the use of Enron online for gas trading."</TE>
<TE>   Hertzberg's firm will be paid $750,000 over the next three years.
Riordan &amp; McKinzie will be paid $500,000 over the next two years.</TE>
<TE>   Wiggs worked as Hertzberg's energy advisor before he was hired by
Riordan to head the DWP a year and a half ago. In addition,
Delgadillo was a deputy mayor to Riordan, whose support helped the
city attorney win election in a close race last year.</TE>
<TE>   But city officials say the firms were selected not because of
political connections but because they were most qualified.</TE>
<TE>   "The city attorney's office went through an extensive selection
process," Wiggs said. "I have absolute confidence that it was based
on merit."</TE>

<HD>Greuel to Run Unopposed for Council Seat</HD>
<DH>Adult film producer drops out of race, saying incumbent
shares his goals for 2nd District.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick McGreevy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles City Councilwoman Wendy Greuel will be unopposed for
reelection in March because her only challenger, soft-core adult film
producer John Quinn, said Tuesday that he is pulling out of the race.</LD>
<LD>   Quinn said that Greuel is fighting for the same Valley causes that
led him to file candidacy papers for her seat.</LD>
<LD>   "The more information I had and the more study I did on Wendy, I
realized she was doing a lot of the things that I wanted to do," said
Quinn, who had filed a declaration of intent to run but has decided
not to file a nominating petition by today's 5 p.m. deadline.</LD>
<TE>   He denied that his work as an independent director and producer
for a Playboy Enterprises film division, and the potential
controversy it might create with voters, were factors in his
decision, even though a friend said he advised Quinn that his job
would hurt his chances.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think that affects people in the Valley," Quinn said.
"There are a lot of film community people in the Valley."</TE>
<TE>   Quinn, of Van Nuys, was executive producer of "Passion's Cove," an
erotic series that Playboy made for HBO, and served as producer or
director of such films as "Cheerleader Camp" and "Girl to Girl." He
said he has also worked on children's programming.</TE>
<TE>   The race for Greuel's 2nd District seat would have been Quinn's
second run for municipal office. He ran for the 11th District seat on
the council of the prospective San Fernando Valley city, which failed
to materialize after the Valley secession proposal was rejected by
voters Nov. 5. Even if secession had been approved, Quinn would not
have won the council seat, having placed second among four
candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Sheftel, who ran for a different Valley council seat Nov. 5
and supports Greuel in her reelection bid, said he advised Quinn that
his career might become an issue for voters in Los Angeles' 2nd
District, an area extending from Van Nuys through Studio City and
North Hollywood to Sunland-Tujunga.</TE>
<TE>   Greuel, also a Van Nuys resident, was elected in April to fill the
unfinished term of Joel Wachs, who left the council to head an arts
foundation in New York.</TE>
<TE>   A former executive with the film studio DreamWorks SKG, Greuel has
won Quinn's admiration by stepping up to fight runaway film
production and to reform the scandal-plagued Entertainment Industry
Development Corp., Quinn said.</TE>
<TE>   Of the seven council seats on the March 4 ballot, it appears only
Greuel's will lack competition. Greuel said she was heartened by the
lack of opposition to her reelection, which she attributed partly to
the job she is doing.</TE>
<TE>   Since her election, Greuel has personally supervised street
repairs and cleanup efforts in her district and has championed the
creation of a borough system in Los Angeles to encourage more
localized decision-making.</TE>
<TE>   She also proposed that the city consider buying the Studio City
Golf and Tennis Center to prevent it from being redeveloped into
senior housing.</TE>
<TE>   "My goal when I was elected was to make sure the Valley is getting
its fair share and has basic city services, and that's what my focus
has been ever since," Greuel said. "I am pleased [Quinn] thought I
can better spend my time during these coming months serving my
district [than campaigning]."</TE>
<TE>   Even though she will be unopposed, Greuel said she still plans to
raise some money and send out political mailers to introduce her to
voters in the district, which was redrawn in July so that 50% of the
area is new to her council seat.</TE>

<HD>New Deal to Protect Hearst Ranch Considered</HD>
<DH>Family may deed to the state virtually all of its
oceanfront acreage. But a desire to keep a few beaches and home sites
may be a sticking point.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kenneth R. Weiss and John Johnson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Hearst Corp. is considering a $100-million conservation deal that
would forsake previous development plans for its historic family
ranch and deed virtually all of its oceanfront acreage -- the
ranchland west of California Highway 1 -- to the state, sources said
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, the family would like to hold on to a few
private beaches along its 18 miles of spectacular coastline and
retain the option to build homes on 27 different lots for future
Hearst generations, sources said.</LD>
<LD>   "There will be no residential or commercial construction west of
Highway 1," said Stephen T. Hearst, vice president and general
manager of the Hearst Corp.'s land and livestock division.</LD>
<TE>   The only exception, he said, would be possible construction of a
small inn within the already developed borders of Old San Simeon
Village next to San Simeon Point.</TE>
<TE>   The plan for the ranch remains a work in progress, with the
details beginning to emerge as the Hearst Corp. abruptly broke off
negotiations with two groups, the Nature Conservancy and the
Conservation Fund, and launched into a new round of talks with the
San Francisco-based American Land Conservancy.</TE>
<TE>   The idea is that the "conservation partner," as Hearst calls it,
would help raise public and private money to compensate the
corporation for setting aside the picturesque property from
development. The 128-square-mile ranch surrounds Hearst Castle in
northern San Luis Obispo County.</TE>
<TE>   Hearst is one of a growing list of major property owners,
including the owners of Ballona Wetlands in Los Angeles, Bolsa Chica
in Huntington Beach and Cargill salt flats in South San Francisco
Bay, trying to tap into the hundreds of millions of dollars available
for conservation projects through voter-passed state bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Hearst decided last year to sell its development rights instead of
reviving dormant plans to build a 650-room hotel complex, golf course
and dude ranch -- a proposal that provoked broad public opposition
and was rebuffed by the state Coastal Commission four years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Graham Chisholm, executive director of the Nature Conservancy of
California, said he was disappointed that Hearst broke off
negotiations after 14 months. But he said he hoped that Hearst Ranch
gets the protection it deserves and Californians get their money's
worth.</TE>
<TE>   "Californians have been very generous in passing bond measures,"
he said. "In order to continue that, Californians deserve to receive
good terms. It's very important that we look carefully at the value
of the property and the benefits the public receives."</TE>
<TE>   Surprisingly, negotiators on both sides deny that money caused the
talks to break down. Neither side would publicly discuss monetary
issues, but sources said the figure ranges from a little under $100
million to as much as $150 million.</TE>
<TE>   The sticking points were focused more on what the public would get
for its money. "The way things were going, they were going to sell us
most or all of the land west of the highway and an easement on the
land east of Highway 1," said Sam Schuchet, executive director of the
Coastal Conservancy, a state agency that awards bond money.</TE>
<TE>   Schuchet said he found the coastal acquisition intriguing, in part
because it would add 18 miles to the California Coastal Trail, an
ambitious project to complete a continuous foot path along the
state's entire 1,150-mile coastline.</TE>
<TE>   But reserving some beaches as private enclaves for the Hearsts, he
said, would be problematic for his agency, which is charged with
expanding public beach access. He also was concerned about how the
Hearsts might build on the 27 lots. Specifically, the concerns are
whether these homes would be set back from the coast, out of public
view and clustered together so they do not fragment habitat for
wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Hearst declined to discuss many details of the
negotiations, including the topic of private beaches. "All of these
issues will be worked out, but public access will be increased" along
the beachfront, Hearst said. As of now, he pointed out, all 18 miles
of the coastline remain private property -- although the ranching
family has allowed windsurfers to use the beach as well as tourists
who stop to watch growing colonies of elephant seals.</TE>
<TE>   Kara Blakeslee, an employee of the Nature Conservancy working on
the Hearst deal, resigned this week to join the American Land
Conservancy solely to complete the deal. She said she is "extremely
optimistic" that an agreement will be reached within months, if not
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the most exciting project I've ever had a chance to work
with," she said. "If we didn't protect Yosemite Valley when we did,
it would be gone now. Some people think this is better than Yosemite
Valley."</TE>

<HD>Labor Leader Honored for Her Activism</HD>
<DH>Dolores Huerta plans to use $100,000 prize to set up
institute to train community organizers.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Longtime labor leader Dolores Huerta was announced on Tuesday as the
2002 winner of the Puffin/Nation prize at a Beverly Hills ceremony
commemorating her lifetime of work for social causes.</LD>
<LD>   Huerta, a storied figure in the history of progressive politics,
said she would use the $100,000 award to start an institute for
recruiting and training community-based organizers.</LD>
<LD>   The 72-year-old Huerta, who almost died two years ago after an
aneurysm, said the future needs the kind of grass-roots groups that
boosted her activist career.</LD>
<TE>   "This is what I came out of, this is what Cesar [Chavez] came out
of," said Huerta, who co-founded the United Farm Workers of America
with Chavez. "There's a lot of latent leadership out there, and the
only thing they need is for us to help them surface."</TE>
<TE>   The award, given jointly by the Puffin Foundation and the Nation
Institute, goes annually to an American who has challenged the status
quo through courageous and imaginative work. The Nation Institute was
founded in 1966 by the owners of the Nation magazine.</TE>
<TE>   The ceremony at the offices of the Feminist Majority Foundation
featured area politicians and fellow activists who, with a mixture of
pride and nostalgia, recalled Huerta's fiery leadership of protest
marches, union strikes and boycotts.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Hilda Solis (D-El Monte), a member of the Congressional
Progressive Caucus, thanked Huerta for helping her career in the
early 1990s, at a time when Huerta was crisscrossing the state to
boost female representation in politics.</TE>
<TE>   "You're my conscience, and you're the conscience for many of us,"
Solis told Huerta, who wore a skirt suit with the red and black
colors of the farm workers union. A button on Huerta's suit read
"Viva la mujer" ( Long live the woman).</TE>
<TE>   Though many of the accolades focused on Huerta's place in history,
some pointed out that she maintains her famously busy pace while
spearheading the struggle for liberal causes. "She reminds that it's
not over," said former state legislator Tom Hayden. "She will not go
quietly. She won't go on the shelf. She won't become a statue. She
won't [yet] have a street named after her."</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Huerta saw her dreams slipping away. The mother of
11 children, 14 grandchildren and five great-grandchildren, Huerta
was told by doctors that she had little chance to live after
suffering an aneurysm in her aorta.</TE>
<TE>   Huerta said she was incapacitated for several months, and had to
relearn how to walk, talk and eat, helped along by her family's
around-the-clock care. This summer, Huerta hit the streets again,
marching from Bakersfield to Sacramento in support of landmark farm
worker legislation. Fellow activists said Huerta marched 150 miles in
15 days, often in 100-degree weather. "For God's sake, who could do
that?" said Peg Yorkin, chairwoman of the Feminist Majority.</TE>
<TE>   Huerta considers her life work far from complete. "Our task is to
go out and find those leaders and help create a better democracy,"
she said. Huerta will fly later this week to New York City, where she
will receive the award on Sunday.</TE>

<LD>A proposed courthouse for juvenile offenders moved forward Tuesday
when the Ventura County Board of Supervisors approved $15 million for
construction.</LD>
<LD>   Plans for the 56,200-square-foot building call for six courtrooms,
judges chambers and staff offices. It is scheduled to be completed in
June 2004.</LD>
<LD>   The courthouse will be one of three buildings in the Juvenile
Justice Complex being constructed on five acres of a former
strawberry patch in El Rio, near Oxnard.</LD>
<TE>   Work on a 420-bed detention center is underway at the site. An
administrative building also is planned.</TE>
<TE>   The goal is to pull all of Ventura County's youth justice
operations into one area. The total project will cost about $65
million, to be paid for with state and county funds as well as fines
collected in court.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a giant leap forward and will make a difference in the lives
of countless children who are going to spend time there," Ventura
County Dist. Atty. Greg Totten said.</TE>

<HD>Grants to Fund Camarillo, Oxnard Libraries</HD>
<DH>Cities to get a combined $21 million from the state to help
pay for new facilities that will offer more space and better
equipment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Holly J. Wolcott and Sandra Murillo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Camarillo and Oxnard have won a combined $21 million in state grants
to underwrite construction of new libraries in those fast-growing
cities, officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The largest award, $15.6 million, will allow Camarillo to more
than quadruple the size of its existing library and create what
officials described as an architectural and cultural showcase.</LD>
<LD>   A $5.7-million grant for Oxnard means the city's south end, where
more than 60,000 people reside, will have its first free-standing
library. The library is now housed in a cramped community center.</LD>
<TE>   "I started jumping up and down when I heard," said Camarillo
Library manager Sandi Banks. "This library will be -- next to City
Hall -- the most important public building here, a major place people
can be proud of."</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Murray, the Oxnard library director, said a new library
was imperative, because the existing one has just 4,000 square feet
of space, few computers and inadequate lighting. "I'm on top of the
world right now," Murray said. "I've got to calm down a little bit
and start containing this excitement."</TE>
<TE>   The two projects, both of which are slated to begin construction
in 2004, were selected from among 61 applications statewide for a
share of $350 million made available by Proposition 14, a
voter-approved library construction measure passed in March 2000.</TE>
<TE>   About $130 million was awarded this week by the state's Office of
Library Construction. The rest will be doled out in the next 18
months.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a highly competitive process," said Richard Hall, the
state's Library Bond Act manager. "There's just a tremendous amount
of need out there."</TE>
<TE>   The proposals were judged partly based on population growth and
the age and condition of current facilities, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura County, only Camarillo and Oxnard requested grants.</TE>
<TE>   The largest grant -- $20 million -- went to the San Mateo Main
Library. The Santa Maria Public Library in Santa Barbara County
received $16.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   Camarillo's population has doubled to more than 60,000 since the
library was built on Ponderosa Drive in 1974. The facility is about
15,000 square feet and contains a collection of more than 112,000
books, videos, audiotapes and periodicals in a space designed to hold
75,000, Banks said.</TE>
<TE>   The Camarillo Library leads the county's 15 libraries in
circulation, with about 311,000 items borrowed annually. But the
children's reading room contains only one small table with eight
little stools, and parents often must sit on the floor, Banks said.</TE>
<TE>   "Our library is pitifully undersized, out of date and in poor
physical condition," said Gail Doi, Camarillo deputy city manager and
author of the grant application.</TE>
<TE>   The city's new $24-million library will be a 65,000-square-foot,
Spanish colonial-style building on 10 acres at Las Posas Road and
Fieldgate Drive. The two-story library will include homework and
family literacy centers, a story-telling room, 80 public computers
and a community room.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining funds needed to build the library -- more than $8
million -- will come primarily from the city, along with a donation
of about $400,000 from the Friends of the Library.</TE>
<TE>   The South Oxnard Branch Library will move out of a community
center at 200 E. Bard Road into a $9.7-million, 23,000-square-foot
facility next door.</TE>
<TE>   The library will include literacy and homework assistance centers
and a computer lab with 30 terminals.</TE>

<LD>You have two ways to take in the holiday light show in Griffith Park.
You can walk, or you can drive.</LD>
<LD>   "Shouldn't we walk?" asked the lovely and talented Alison.</LD>
<LD>   "It wouldn't be right," I said as we approached the start of the
mile-long, billion-watt celebration of the season.</LD>
<TE>   Everyone seemed to have made the same decision. I didn't see many
pedestrians at the 2002 DWP Light Festival. I guess that's why
traffic was backed up before we even hit the starting point, and they
say it's far worse on weekends.</TE>
<TE>   This year's show celebrates DWP's 100th year in business and pays
tribute to its "proud history ... and its pivotal role in
establishing Los Angeles as the second largest city in the nation."</TE>
<TE>   The word "proud" is an interesting choice. The men who built Los
Angeles had big dreams, but scarcely enough water to wet their
Scotch. So they funneled it in from the north, undeterred by setbacks
such as the 1928 dam collapse that killed 400 people. The DWP has
kept the spigot wide open ever since.</TE>
<TE>   "It got that water by pulling off a deal so dirty it still stains
the city's past," a predecessor of mine, Robert A. Jones, wrote in
1990, detailing the litany of lawsuits as well as the environmental
havoc wreaked on the Owens Valley and Mono Lake.</TE>
<TE>   But I digress.</TE>
<TE>   At the entrance, they hand you a guide to the 26-station festival
of lights. You've got plenty of time to read it, too, because now
you're in a bottleneck. We read by the glow from the "Welcome Tunnel
of Lights," which delivered us to the "DWP At Your Service" station.</TE>
<TE>   Before I go much further I should say that in a city of infamous
glamour and pretense, not to mention special-effects wizardry, the
festival of lights is no Spielberg production. Whoever was
responsible for the Staples Center display -- it resembles Tupperware
left on a burner -- should not be allowed to participate next year.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, you don't often hear of a water and power department
putting on a holiday show. It looks like something a small Midwestern
town would throw together, but as you make your way through L.A.'s
version of the North Pole, you realize that's part of its charm. I
saw a pickup with kids in the back, bundled under blankets and
beaming.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is making your way.</TE>
<TE>   The route through the festival has two lanes, and as it happened,
I was stuck in the right-hand lane while all the displays were on the
left.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't see the [blank] light display because of the [blanking]
SUVs," Alison squawked as we motored along in the low- lying Nissan
Sentra, which is not the proper vehicle to take to the festival.</TE>
<TE>   I saw a cutthroat driver manage to jockey into the good lane up
ahead, cutting someone off as if this were the 405 at rush hour. I
tried to make a switch myself, but got boxed out by some moron
driving a Ford Extinction.</TE>
<TE>   So much for the spirit of the season.</TE>
<TE>   We're bottled up in the last patch of open space in all of L.A.,
choked by clouds of exhaust, for the sake of seeing a show dedicated
to the robber barons who created this traffic jam and all others.</TE>
<TE>   A cynic might point out the DWP was accused of price gouging in
the last energy crisis. They like to lecture us on conservation, too,
and here they are with a billion-watt extravaganza that cost
taxpayers $330,000. I don't think that includes the nightly power
bill, either.</TE>
<TE>   Is there something wrong with this picture?</TE>
<TE>   I'm almost tempted to go get my money back. But I'm trapped, for
one thing, and for another, the show is free.</TE>
<TE>   Then it hits me.</TE>
<TE>   The genius of the light festival -- the thing that elevates it to
art -- is not that it makes you forget the dark history of the DWP
and how Los Angeles came to be, but that it finally makes you embrace
it.</TE>
<TE>   Here's a drive-by public event that requires no human interaction,
just a full tank of gas and a taste for both comfort and excess.</TE>
<TE>   It's perfect.</TE>
<TE>   You're almost tempted, especially after you hear Frank Sinatra
sing "God Bless America" at the "Statue of Liberty" display, to go
for a second spin and spur the economy by burning more fuel.</TE>
<TE>   When the water from the north first flowed into L.A., William
Mulholland was there to mark the moment with the famous commandment:</TE>
<TE>   "There it is. Take it."</TE>
<TE>   With Mulholland as our Moses, how can we not indulge? It was his
daughter who flipped the switch to open this year's festival of
lights, as well it should have been.</TE>
<TE>   Pack up the kids, pick up the grandparents, and head for the
beacon that lights the sky over the boundless metropolis.</TE>

<HD>Jury Selection Begins in Luster Trial Despite Defense
Objections</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tracy Wilson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Over defense objections, jury selection began Tuesday in the
date-rape trial of millionaire Andrew Luster.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura County Superior Court Judge Ken Riley acknowledged that he
was ordering the start of the trial over the objections of Luster's
attorneys, who contend the district attorney has lied, falsified
evidence and concealed items that could exonerate their client.</LD>
<LD>   "The Ventura County district attorney and his minions are felons,
pure and simple," Santa Monica attorney Roger Jon Diamond wrote in a
motion to disqualify county prosecutors.</LD>
<TE>   From the inception of the case, Diamond contends, the Ventura
County Sheriff's Department and district attorney's office violated
Luster's rights and illegally manipulated the proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   Diamond alleges in the Nov. 27 motion that sheriff's deputies
obtained search warrants using false information and psychologically
abused Luster by strip-searching and photographing him at the Ventura
County Jail.</TE>
<TE>   Diamond further accuses prosecutors of "treachery" in their
handling of the case, and requests that the state attorney general
take over, or launch a criminal investigation.</TE>
<TE>   In court this week, Deputy Dist. Atty. Anthony Wold argued that
the motion should not be considered because it was filed too close to
the start of the trial. Riley has set a hearing on the issue for
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Luster, 38, the great-grandson of cosmetics magnate Max Factor, is
accused of raping three women after rendering them unconscious with
the date-rape drug gamma hydroxybutyrate, or GHB.</TE>
<TE>   Luster was arrested in July 2000 after one of the women reported
being drugged at a Santa Barbara bar and raped at his Mussel Shoals
beach house.</TE>
<TE>   During a search of the home, detectives found videotapes that
allegedly depict Luster raping two other unconscious women.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers contend that Luster has been framed, the tapes
altered and witnesses coached to lie.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Diamond advised the court that the defense is still
investigating alleged misconduct by law enforcement, including
possible altering of the videotapes.</TE>
<TE>   He said he was not ready to begin the trial.</TE>
<TE>   Riley, who had previously pointed out that the defense had more
than a year to prepare, denied the request.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Wife's Civil Case in Beating Reaches Final Arguments</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Closing arguments are expected today in a civil trial in which a
Newbury Park woman accuses her ex-husband of attacking her with a
metal flashlight three years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Linda Morrisset, 51, sued her former spouse, Lee Mannheimer, 59,
after sustaining severe head injuries during a near-fatal attack
Sept. 11, 1999, in the hallway of her home.</LD>
<LD>   Morrisset testified that Mannheimer bludgeoned her with a
flashlight, but he denied beating her.</LD>
<TE>   Mannheimer repeated that testimony Tuesday when called as a
rebuttal witness by his attorney, Greg Ramirez. Asked if he had any
reason to harm his ex-wife, Mannheimer said, "No, absolutely none."</TE>
<TE>   Morrisset's attorney, Allen Ball, contends Mannheimer flew into a
rage amid a child-custody mix-up and battered his client in front of
their child.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Maxx Mannheimer, 12, testified he was not present
during the assault on his mother. The boy said he was home with his
father at Mannheimer's house in Westlake Village.</TE>

<HD>Bills Would Hand Control Over Schools to Governor, Fund
Early Education</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Doug Smith and Carl Ingram</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State lawmakers unveiled legislation Tuesday to make full-day
kindergarten compulsory, set up a system of voluntary state-funded
preschools and shift authority over public school operations from the
elected superintendent of public instruction to the governor's
office.</LD>
<LD>   The bills represent the first in a package of proposed laws that
are being drafted to implement the new California Master Plan on
Education.</LD>
<LD>   Completed in August by a joint Senate-Assembly committee, the plan
proposes to revamp public education from top to bottom, cleaning up
fractured lines of authority, better linking high schools and
colleges, and changing some funding formulas.</LD>
<TE>   "We are doing more than just tinkering around the edges of the
education system," state Sen. Dede Alpert (D-Coronado), chairwoman of
the committee, said at a news conference Tuesday. "We are addressing
the whole system of education in a way that puts children first."</TE>
<TE>   The two bills introduced Monday, however, do not appropriate money
for key goals such as state-supported preschools for all. And some,
like the proposed change in the state superintendent's powers, face
strong opposition from teachers unions and other groups.</TE>
<TE>   Alpert conceded that the projected $21.1-billion shortage in the
state budget in the next 18 months means the plan probably will get
no funds this year and possibly none until the fiscal crisis is
resolved. The governor is studying the possibility of "recapturing"
as much as $1.9 billion in education spending -- the amount by which
the budget exceeds the required support to public education under
voter-approved Proposition 98, a state initiative that mandates a
certain level of education funding.</TE>
<TE>   "If you never have the vision, if you never put the idea out
there, then you never begin to take the steps that make it happen and
20 years down the road, we would all be in this room ... saying the
same thing all over again," Alpert said.</TE>
<TE>   As future budgets permit, preschool programs would be set up first
for students heading into the lowest-performing schools, Alpert said.
She said the plan is for the state to supplement efforts, such as
that in L.A. County, to use Proposition 10 money from tobacco taxes
for preschool expansions.</TE>
<TE>   Alpert also conceded that she had no idea what Gov. Gray Davis
thinks of the proposal to place public schools' management directly
under his office.</TE>
<TE>   Alpert said that although high-level Davis staff members,
including Education Secretary Kerry Mazzoni, knew of the commission's
work during the past 3 1/2 years, Davis' office had not "shown any
particular interest" in changing the superintendent's duties.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Davis said the governor often does not weigh in
on bills, preferring to "watch and see what comes from the
Legislature."</TE>
<TE>   The proposal would dramatically shift school governance by
removing about 1,350 workers from the supervision of the
superintendent and placing them instead under a Cabinet-level
position. The state Board of Education, which sets statewide
education policy, would become an advisory board and its staff would
be absorbed by the Cabinet department, said Stephen Blake, chief
consultant for the joint committee.</TE>
<TE>   The superintendent of instruction would remain an elective officer
overseeing about 250 people who currently manage academic
accountability, Blake said.</TE>
<TE>   Pete Mehas, Fresno County superintendent of schools, said the
changes would fix a "fundamentally broken" system that creates mixed
messages in the field with directives currently coming from the
board, the state superintendent and the governor.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know who to listen to," Mehas said.</TE>
<TE>   Delaine Eastin, the current superintendent, said she opposes the
change because the school system needs one officer focused on all its
operations.</TE>
<TE>   Other powerful groups, including the Assn. of California School
Administrators and the California Teachers Assn., also oppose the
change, saying it would waste money.</TE>
<TE>   The master plan also would create a California Education
Commission to take over planning, coordination and data gathering for
all levels from pre-kindergarten through college.</TE>
<TE>   The missions of the University of California and California State
University systems remain largely untouched, but the community
college system would be recast somewhat, giving its board more
independence. Community colleges also would be allowed to provide
some third- and fourth-year classes in cooperation with universities.</TE>
<TE>   Alpert said seven more bills would be introduced soon. Among them
is a proposed state constitutional amendment allowing districts to
supplement state funds with property tax increases. Other bills will
incorporate such proposals as eliminating multitrack year-round
schedules, setting new standards for school facilities and designing
a new funding model with block grants for disadvantaged schools.</TE>
<TE>   Another future bill is expected to propose the elimination of
emergency teaching permits by placing all non-credentialed teachers
in pre-intern programs and eventually phasing out such programs.</TE>
<TE>   The master plan also recommends a permanent joint committee to
pursue initiatives on including unifying separate elementary and
secondary districts and reviewing the collective bargaining process.</TE>

<LD>Two bodies that washed ashore in Huntington Beach have been
identified as those of missing sport fishermen, authorities said
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Dae Kyu Kim, 35, of Los Angeles and his uncle Hyong Kim of
Burbank, 46, had been lost at sea for more than a week.</LD>
<LD>   Lifeguards found Dae Kim's body late Monday afternoon near
Huntington Beach Pier. Hyong Kim's body was recovered Tuesday
afternoon at Bolsa Chica State Beach, about five miles away.</LD>
<TE>   The Orange County coroner's office has not determined cause of
death for either man.</TE>
<TE>   The two were reported missing after their 22-foot boat was found
abandoned off Huntington Beach last week.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators found a wallet, two cell phones and the keys to the
boat.</TE>
<TE>   Police said that the men had called relatives shortly before the
boat was found to say that they were having a good time.</TE>
<TE>   The Coast Guard searched a 1,400-square-mile area for more than 24
hours but failed to find the men. The seas at the time were calm,
authorities said.</TE>

<LD>David Morin wonders whether it's an attempt by Congress to stimulate
the economy by extending the holiday season. While in Washington, he
bought a House of Representatives calendar that had lengthened
November (see accompanying).</LD>
<LD>   Congress is nothing if not consistent, by the way. The December
page has that month starting a day late.</LD>
<LD>   Clothes line: You know how commercial Web sites make
recommendations for customers with certain interests. Well, Mike
Sternfeld of Pacific Palisades came across an Amazon.com page
dedicated to modest folks (see accompanying).</LD>
<TE>   Such a deal: Bob Nagayama of Tarzana spotted a nonpareil spelling
error at a bakery (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   More confusion: Susan Baker of L.A., meanwhile, came across a
company that seems to specialize in rugs that know exactly where they
are (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Behind closed doors: A building inspector knocked at the front
door of a Paramount house and got no answer. But he could hear
someone singing opera inside, the city's newsletter reports. Peering
through a window, the inspector "finally saw the resident lying on
the living room floor, singing to his birds."</TE>
<TE>   Assaults on the English language (cont.): A
botox/collagen/laser-facial practitioner advertises herself as an
"aesthetics specialist."</TE>
<TE>   At peace, temporarily: You may have read that, in order for USC to
win a Rose Bowl bid, UCLA must defeat Washington State this weekend.
In other words, USC fans will be rooting for UCLA. How rare an
occasion will that be? I remember a story told by USC grad Jay Berman
about how, years ago, he was in Nikola's on Sunset Boulevard,
cheering for a visiting Soviet basketball team on TV. And this was
during the Cold War era.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Way to go, Vladimir,' or something like that," Berman
recalled, "and this big guy sitting next to me said, 'You're rooting
for the Russkies?' I said, 'Well, they're playing UCLA.' "</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: Remember when kids used to bring apples to their
teachers? Now they have other ideas. The police log of the Saddleback
Valley News in Laguna Hills included this item: "Disturbance ... Five
male juveniles in a black new Jeep Cherokee are doing drive-by
fruitings." Hate those fruitings.</TE>

<TE>   We pause today to remember the late, great Tammy Wynette, the
legendary country music star whose presence was never so felt at the
Orange County Board of Supervisors as it was Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   There, before a hushed (or possibly uninterested) group of
supervisors, reporters and county bureaucrats, outgoing Chairwoman
Cynthia Coad stopped just short of belting out Wynette's 1968
classic, "Stand by Your Man," as she let newly departed supervisor
Todd Spitzer have it right between the eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer, of course, wasn't there. He was supposed to be, but the
newly elected state assemblyman took early retirement from the board
Nov. 19 because, he said, preparations for his imminent Capitol duty
were taking all his time.</TE>
<TE>   Until then, everyone assumed he'd stay until Tuesday, when he was
sworn in for the Assembly.</TE>
<TE>   It just so happened that Spitzer's premature withdrawal from the
board left both Coads (Cynthia and her husband, Tom) angry and
frustrated. That's because Tom Coad had planned to run in a special
election next month to fill Spitzer's term but suddenly found himself
ineligible on a residency technicality. Had Spitzer stayed on until
Tuesday, Tom Coad could have run.</TE>
<TE>   Well, let's just say that didn't set well with the First Lady of
the County (Coad), not to be confused with the First Lady of Country
Music (Wynette).</TE>
<TE>   As chairwoman, Coad was supposed to certify the date for the
special election.</TE>
<TE>   But that's not how Tammy, who died in 1998, would have handled
things.</TE>
<TE>   Nor was it how Cynthia did.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of carrying out her appointed task (what oath of office?),
Coad refused to vote. Here's what, in part, she said instead:</TE>
<TE>   "Because of the early resignation, it made the voter registration
postmark of Tom Coad a day late. I believe the early resignation was
a calculated trick to thwart Tom Coad's candidacy."</TE>
<TE>   She went on to say that Measure V, a March ballot proposition,
supported by Spitzer, decreeing that vacancies on the board will be
filled by election, was supposed to guarantee the will of the people
in the event of an unexpired supervisorial term but that "it appears
those involved don't want the will of the people, they just want the
will of the people for the person they select."</TE>
<TE>   Final verse:</TE>
<TE>   "I will abstain on this item, because the will of the people and
democracy are not served by the apparent calculated trick to thwart
an individual's previously announced and publicized plan to run ....
I trust that my abstention will serve to point out how hypocritical
some people and politicians can be; for example, resorting to
trickery to consummate musical chairs with elected seats.... "</TE>
<TE>   Not as lyrical as Tammy, but we get the point. Her colleagues
passed the measure without her.</TE>
<TE>   Notwithstanding that the will of the people hasn't been thwarted,
only Tom Coad's, I applaud Cynthia's righteous anger. Whether she'd
have done the same thing if the thwarted candidate hadn't been her
man for the last 48 years, we'll never know.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, Tammy's hit wasn't titled "Stand by Everybody's Man."</TE>
<TE>   I wish I'd been there Tuesday to see Cynthia's performance.</TE>
<TE>   Everybody now, join in!</TE>
<TE>   "Stand by your man</TE>
<TE>   And show the world you love him</TE>
<TE>   Keep givin' all the love you can</TE>
<TE>   Stand by your man."</TE>

<HD>Poet Resigns Post at UC San Diego Over Resume Lie</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tony Perry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Award-winning poet Quincy Troupe, who stepped down as California poet
laureate after it was revealed that he lied about having a bachelor's
degree, announced Tuesday that he is resigning his $140,900-a-year
post as a literature professor at UC San Diego for the same reason.</LD>
<LD>   The surprise resignation, which is effective at the end of the
academic year in June, immediately caused concern among students and
faculty that the creative writing program at the science-dominated
campus could suffer without the presence of its superstar.</LD>
<LD>   "Quincy will be fine, but the rest of us could be undermined,"
said writing professor Eileen Myles, who added that she was outraged
that the university administration did not try to keep Troupe from
resigning. The literature faculty had already sent a letter of
support for Troupe to Chancellor Robert Dynes.</LD>
<TE>   "He's an artist," Myles said. "He wasn't here because of his
bachelor's degree. He would have been hired without a bachelor's
degree. I'm ashamed of the university."</TE>
<TE>   Troupe, 63, said he plans to move to New York and continue writing
and working on the film adaptation of his Miles Davis reminiscence
"Miles and Me."</TE>
<TE>   "I regret what has happened," Troupe told reporters. "I'm moving
on with my work. I'm moving into the sunrise, not the sunset. I have
a lot of work to do."</TE>
<TE>   At a broad-shouldered 6 feet 2 and 235 pounds -- and partial to
wearing black and his hair in dreadlocks -- Troupe cut a dramatic
figure on campus as he rushed from class to class.</TE>
<TE>   He brought change to San Diego's staid cultural scene by creating
an annual gathering of big-name writers and musicians at the Museum
of Contemporary Art. The event is called "Artists on the Cutting
Edge: Cross Fertilization."</TE>
<TE>   The university administration had been pondering what punishment,
if any, to mete out to Troupe for having claimed on his job
application in 1991 to have a degree from Grambling State University.
The lie came to light during a routine background check done after
Gov. Gray Davis picked Troupe as poet laureate in June.</TE>
<TE>   Vice Chancellor Richard Attiyeh said Troupe had not been asked to
resign. Asked if he could have remained on the faculty, Attiyeh said,
"I think the answer to that is, basically, yes."</TE>
<TE>   In a written statement, Dynes said that "although I understand and
agree with Quincy's decision to step down, he will be greatly missed
as a colleague and friend."</TE>
<TE>   At UC San Diego, Troupe has been a professor of American and
Caribbean literature and creative writing. He also has taught at
UCLA, USC and Columbia University.</TE>
<TE>   Known for melding rap, jazz and be-bop rhythms into his poetry,
Troupe has published 13 books, including six volumes of poetry. He
has won two American Book Awards, a Peabody Award and twice won the
Taos Poetry Circus, considered the Super Bowl of poetry showdowns
known as "slams."</TE>
<TE>   Troupe's poetry is marked by a furious rush of images, sometimes
jarring, often arising from personal experience. In "Poem Reaching
For Something," the poet describes the chaos and energy of the
expressive impulse:</TE>
<TE>   we walk through a calligraphy of hats slicing off foreheads</TE>
<TE>   ace-deuce cocked, they slant, razor sharp, clean through
imagination,</TE>
<TE>   our spirits knee-deep in what we have forgotten entrancing</TE>
<TE>   our bodies now to dance, like enraptured water lilies</TE>
<TE>   the rhythm in liquid strides of certain looks</TE>
<TE>   eyeballs rippling through breezes</TE>
<TE>   riffing choirs of trees, where a trillion slivers of sunlight
dance across</TE>
<TE>   filigreeing leaves, a zillion voices of bamboo reeds, green with
summer</TE>
<TE>   saxophone bursts, wrap themselves, like transparent prisms of dew
drops</TE>
<TE>   around images, laced with pearls &amp; rhinestones, dreams</TE>
<TE>   &amp; perhaps it is through this decoding of syllables that we</TE>
<TE>   learn speech.</TE>
<TE>   At his news conference, Troupe said he regretted his "lapse in
judgment" and causing embarrassment for the university and his
family, particularly his 85-year-old mother.</TE>
<TE>   But he said he is eager to return to New York where his wife owns
an art studio and where he was affiliated with a movement of cafe
poets who brought new themes and a blue-collar, populist view to
their poetry.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's face it, as a writer ... I've always wanted to have
unlimited time to devote to writing," said Troupe, his voice
betraying a trace of emotion. "This is that opportunity."</TE>

<HD>Gunman Gets Life for Slaying</HD>
<DH>West L.A. resident, 31, is sentenced in the fatal shooting
of man he followed from a casino.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean Guccione</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 31-year-old man was sentenced to life in prison without parole
Tuesday for fatally shooting a Valencia man he followed from
Hollywood Park Casino and robbed at a Santa Clarita gas station.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Meredith C. Taylor also
ordered Phaynes Noble Reeda Jr. of West Los Angeles to serve 25 years
to life in prison for using a firearm and seven additional years for
robbery.</LD>
<LD>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Paula Gonzales said videotapes taken from
casino security cameras show Reeda and Anthony Duke Graham, 22, of
Los Angeles, following their 26-year-old victim, Brandon Hunche, and
his girlfriend around the gaming floor, then to their car.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities say the men followed the couple from the Inglewood
casino to a Texaco station in the 24400 block of Lyons Avenue on
Sept. 30, 2001. When Hunche got out of the car to pump gas, Reeda put
a gun to his neck and demanded money, Gonzales said.</TE>
<TE>   Hunche offered him $20, unaware that the men knew he had just won
$600 to $700 at the casino, she said. When Hunche did not provide
more money, Reeda shot him, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Hunche's girlfriend handed over her purse and was not harmed.</TE>
<TE>   She later identified Reeda from the casino videotape as the
shooter, Gonzales said. Police also found one of his fingerprints on
Hunche's car.</TE>
<TE>   Inglewood police arrested Reeda a few days later at the casino,
and Graham, who drove the getaway car, later turned himself in to
authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Separate San Fernando juries last month convicted Reeda and Graham
of murder and robbery.</TE>
<TE>   Graham is set to be sentenced Monday. He also faces life in prison
without parole.</TE>

<HD>D.A. Seeks Probation, Counseling for Ryder</HD>
<DH>The report precedes sentencing slated Friday for the
actress who was convicted of shoplifting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kristina Sauerwein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>County prosecutors are recommending that film star Winona Ryder do 60
days of community service, undergo drug and psychiatric counseling,
and pay more than $26,000 in fines and restitution as a result of her
conviction for shoplifting from Saks Fifth Avenue.</LD>
<LD>   Ryder, who had faced a possible three-year prison term, is due to
be sentenced Friday in a Beverly Hills courtroom for felony grand
theft and vandalism. The district attorney's office previously
announced that it would seek to place her on felony probation rather
than demand jail time.</LD>
<LD>   Ryder's attorney, Mark Geragos, said Tuesday that he does not plan
to file a motion for a new trial -- a contrast from his reaction last
month after Ryder was convicted of shoplifting $5,560 in designer
merchandise from Saks in Beverly Hills. Ryder was acquitted of
burglary.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm certainly happy they're not asking for jail time," Geragos
said. "I would imagine [Ryder] is pleased too."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors issued the sentencing memorandum without comment.</TE>
<TE>   According to the five-page memo, the recommended sentence is meant
to punish Ryder "for her criminal conduct, deterring others by
demonstrating the consequences of such conduct and requiring the
defendant to cooperate in [a] plan for psychiatric and/or drug
counseling so her actions on December 12, 2001 will not be repeated."</TE>
<TE>   Ryder, the 31-year-old star of such movies as "Girl, Interrupted,"
"Little Women" and "The Age of Innocence," has no prior convictions.</TE>
<TE>   Court transcripts made public after the trial disclosed that Ryder
was suspected of shoplifting on three previous occasions at Neiman
Marcus and Barneys stores. Superior Court Judge Elden S. Fox ruled
that such evidence could not be presented to the jury.</TE>
<TE>   When Ryder was arrested outside Saks, she was found with 20
unpaid-for designer items valued at $5,560.</TE>
<TE>   At trial, much of the prosecution's case focused on lengthy
videotapes from Saks security cameras showing Ryder walking through
the store laden with merchandise and shopping bags. At times, Ryder,
who is free on $20,000 bail, stuffed socks and hair bows into a hat.</TE>
<TE>   In the sentencing memo, Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley and Deputy Dist.
Atty. Ann Rundle recommended that Ryder pay Saks $6,355.40 for stolen
and damaged merchandise as well as $20,000 in restitution and penal
fines.</TE>
<TE>   They also stated that they oppose allowing Ryder to design her own
community service program. The D.A.'s office believes "that the
punitive aspect of community service will serve as a deterrent for
the defendant and demonstrate to her that criminal conduct results in
serious consequences for the offender."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors also have said they hope that during probation, drug
and psychiatric counseling will address Ryder's problems that they
believe may have led her to commit the crimes.</TE>
<TE>   When Beverly Hills police booked Ryder late last year, they found
in her possession eight narcotics, including liquid Demerol and
diazepam, Valium, Vicodin, Percodan, Vicoprofen, morphine sulfate and
Endocet containing oxycodone. Seven of the drugs had been prescribed
to her by physicians, and prosecutors dropped a drug possession count
on the eighth when a doctor acknowledged having provided it to her as
part of a medical treatment.</TE>
<TE>   The D.A.'s office asked that Judge Fox order Ryder to use her
birth name -- Winona Horowitz -- or her stage name when seeking
prescriptions for controlled substances. The actress had obtained the
drugs from several physicians and used different names to obtain
them, including Emily Thompson.</TE>

care, supports the plan.</LD>

the San Francisco Health Commission.</LD>
<LD>   In 2000, there were about 500 new reported cases of people with
HIV or AIDS. In 2002, that increased to 1,084, said James Loyce Jr.,
the city's deputy director of health for AIDS programs.</LD>

<HD>Group Comes to Defense of Boy Scouts</HD>
<DH>Fund drive is set up after United Way chapter ends support
over organization's gay ban.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Massie Ritsch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A group of Ventura County politicians, community leaders and
executives has launched a fund-raising drive to protest United Way's
decision to stop supporting the Boy Scouts because of their policy
against homosexuals.</LD>
<LD>   Now in its third week, the independent campaign has raised more
than $30,000, which its organizers will match dollar for dollar,
leader Carlos Ortega said.</LD>
<LD>   That already surpasses what the Boy Scouts' Ventura County Council
stands to lose when the county's United Way chapter cuts off its
funding next summer. The Friends of Ventura County Scouts have
committed $100,000 to match donations to the local council.</LD>
<TE>   "Wherever your community happens to be, the Scouts are there,"
said Ortega, explaining why he and more than 80 others launched the
Friends group to honor the Boy Scouts and protest United Way's
"unwarranted and unfair" action.</TE>
<TE>   "At some point you have to stand up for the people who've been
doing the grunt work in society and say, 'You know what, these are
good guys,' " Ortega said.</TE>
<TE>   His group's prominent backers include several Ventura County
politicians, all Republicans: Rep. Elton Gallegly, Assembly members
Tony Strickland and Keith Richman, Sheriff Bob Brooks and Dist. Atty.
Greg Totten. Christian broadcasting mogul Edward Atsinger and singer
Pat Boone also support the "Tribute to Scouts."</TE>
<TE>   United Way of Ventura County decided in 2001 to broaden its
antidiscrimination policy, denying funding to any organization that
discriminates based on sexual preference. The action followed a
Supreme Court decision in 2000 that upheld the Boy Scouts of
America's policy, excluding openly gay men and boys from their ranks.</TE>
<TE>   Although the court's decision directly affected only New Jersey,
where a gay troop leader first brought a lawsuit, the case rippled
throughout the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Some schools and cities barred Scout troops from meeting in their
buildings. Many churches and synagogues also debated their
sponsorships. Some donors pulled their money from the Boy Scouts,
while others contributed in support of the organization's right to
pick its members. Director Steven Spielberg, an Eagle Scout, resigned
from the organization's national advisory board.</TE>
<TE>   Each of United Way's 1,400 chapters operates autonomously, and
Ventura County's chapter is among roughly 55 that have taken formal
stances against groups that discriminate on race, religion, sexual
preference and other criteria, according to the national
organization.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, United Way stopped supporting local Boy
Scout troops in recent years but funds "Learning for Life," an
in-school ethics program that is affiliated with Scouting but does
not exclude gay leaders, a United Way spokeswoman said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   United Way and Boy Scouts officials in Orange, Riverside and San
Bernardino counties said local troops will not lose United Way
funding.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County's United Way "is dealing with donor dollars and we
have a fiduciary responsibility to our donors to make sure that our
agencies do not discriminate for any reason," board Chairman Samuel
L. Vernallis said.</TE>
<TE>   United Way offered to fund Ventura County's "Learning for Life"
program, but the Scouting council declined the offer.</TE>
<TE>   Vernallis said he would donate to the Friends of Ventura County
Scouts himself if they had not exploited United Way's stance in
recent newspaper ads to stoke their donations. He fears the campaign
will hinder United Way's fund-raising.</TE>
<TE>   "If they are successful in hurting the United Way campaign, all
they're doing is hurting individual clients of our agencies,"
Vernallis said.</TE>
<TE>   One of United Way's largest individual contributors in the county,
health insurance executive Denny Weinberg, has withdrawn his support
and is giving instead to the Boy Scouts. "I don't want to see United
Way stray from its mission and try to set policy for other agencies,"
Weinberg said.</TE>
<TE>   In the current funding cycle, which ends June 30, the Boy Scouts'
Ventura County council will continue to receive money from United Way
in two ways: $28,716 from the county chapter's Community Care Fund,
which distributes donors' contributions to more than 50 agencies; and
$21,698 from donors who name the Boy Scouts as the sole recipient of
their gift. After June, United Way will no longer fund Boy Scouts
through its community fund.</TE>
<TE>   "We're disappointed with [United Way's policy], but we respect
their right as a private organization to establish their values and
live by their values just as we expect the right to establish our
values and live by our values," said Dave Graska, the Scouting
council's executive director.</TE>
<TE>   Losing that money removes only 2% of the Scouts' $1.5-million
annual budget, a shortfall the organization could make up without the
independent fund-raising campaign, Graska said.</TE>

<HD>Slander Suit Against George Michael Can Proceed</HD>
<DH>Appeals court ruling lets a Beverly Hills policeman sue the
singer for accusing the officer of exposing himself to entrap
Michael.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Henry Weinstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A sharply divided federal appeals court ruled Tuesday that a Beverly
Hills police officer's $10-million slander suit against singer George
Michael can move ahead toward trial, reversing a lower court ruling
that dismissed the case.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Stephen Reinhardt issued a
stinging dissent, saying that "by allowing the suit to proceed, the
majority gives law enforcement officers a tool to silence speech on a
topic of critical public importance -- police misconduct."</LD>
<LD>   The suit stems from a 1998 incident in which Michael was arrested
for exposing himself in the bathroom of a Beverly Hills park.
Michael, who was born Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou, pleaded no
contest to charges of disorderly conduct, was fined $810, placed on
probation and required to perform community service.</LD>
<TE>   Subsequently, Michael, who first came to prominence in the 1980s,
gave several magazine and television interviews, including one on the
"Late Show With David Letterman,"in which he accused Officer Marcelo
Rodriguez of exposing himself and masturbating in front of the singer
in an attempt to entrap him into committing a crime. Michael also
released a music video that referred to the incident.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Consuelo B. Marshall dismissed the suit,
ruling that Michael's statements were non-actionable, nondefamatory
expressions of opinion.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez contends that he was slandered by seven separate
statements Michael made in various interviews. On the Letterman show
in November 1998, Michael said: "He played a game called 'You show me
yours, no, I'll show you mine.' It was called 'I show you mine, you
show me yours, and I'll take you down to the police station.' "</TE>
<TE>   The same month, on a British television program, Michael said, "I
responded to a very handsome, tall, good-looking American cop, they
don't send Colombo [sic] in there to do this and so I was responding
to that and I can't be ashamed of the fact that it was there in front
of me."</TE>
<TE>   Ninth Circuit Judges A. Wallace Tashima and Stephen S. Trott ruled
Tuesday in San Francisco that Michael's statements appear to support
a claim under two categories of the state's slander statute: charging
someone with committing a crime, and injuring one's professional
reputation by accusing him of conduct that would disqualify him from
his job.</TE>
<TE>   "It is doubtful that the police conduct alleged -- the exposure of
a police officers' genitals and an act of masturbation in a public
place -- is an accepted practice of the Beverly Hills Police
Department in the conduct of undercover operations," Tashima wrote in
his majority opinion.</TE>
<TE>   A jury "could conclude that Michael's statements accuse Rodriguez
of conduct that would disqualify him from service as a police
officer, regardless of whether it was done to further an undercover
operation," Tashima added.</TE>
<TE>   Reinhardt disagreed, quoting a California court decision holding
that "sexual motivation is a prime requisite" for proving lewd
conduct.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not possible to say that any of Michael's statements even
hint that Rodriguez might have had a 'sexual motivation' or that
anyone would believe that he might have been so motivated," Reinhardt
said. "Indeed, Michael explicitly stated that Rodriquez's motivation
was, to Michael's chagrin, entirely focused on law enforcement."</TE>
<TE>   As a policy matter, Reinhardt said, the majority's standard for
letting the suit go forward "would ... convert almost every public
statement regarding alleged police impropriety into a potential
lawsuit by the officer accused of wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   "If a citizen claimed that an officer was unnecessarily rough in
effecting an arrest, or that an officer was verbally abusive without
provocation, such statements would apparently subject the citizen to
the threat of liability -- and at the least to the expense of
defending a legal action," Reinhardt wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Consequently, Reinhardt continued, "many legitimately aggrieved
individuals will simply remain silent."</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez's attorney Richard F.G. Thomas said Rodriguez was "very
pleased" with the ruling. Michael's attorney did not return a call
seeking comment.</TE>

<HD>2 Men Charged in Valley Slayings</HD>
<DH>The Sun Valley suspects are held in gang- related incidents
in which victims were shot without provocation sitting in their cars.</DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two San Fernando Valley gang members were charged Tuesday in
connection with two slayings four days apart last month in which
their alleged victims were shot without provocation in cars, Los
Angeles police said.</LD>
<LD>   Jose Ledesma, 19, and Mario Catalan, 25, both of Sun Valley, were
charged with murder, attempted murder and shooting at an occupied
vehicle in the Nov. 23 slaying of Enrique Acosta, 26, in North
Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   Ledesma also is charged with murder in another fatal shooting in
North Hollywood on Nov. 27. He is being held without bail and could
face the death penalty if found guilty of the special circumstance of
committing multiple murders.</LD>
<TE>   Catalan's bail was set Tuesday at $1.25 million. Both men are
being held at Twin Towers Correctional Facility in downtown Los
Angeles. Their arraignment was postponed until Dec. 17 in Los Angeles
County Superior Court in Van Nuys.</TE>
<TE>   The first slaying took place during the afternoon when three men
in a Mustang, including Ledesma and Catalan, allegedly fired seven
shots into a sport utility vehicle on Lankershim Boulevard in what
police described as a gang-related incident. The shots were fired
after one of the men asked Acosta, the driver, where he was from.</TE>
<TE>   The second slaying took place early in the morning. A lone gunman
in a hooded sweatshirt, whom police identified as Ledesma, approached
Christian Vargas, 18, as he waited for his girlfriend on Lowell
Street, police said.</TE>
<TE>   The case fell together quickly with several key breaks, said Det.
Mike Coffey of the LAPD North Hollywood Division. Detectives narrowed
the list of suspects by matching the Mustang's paper license plates,
which were identified by witnesses, to the Lankershim Boulevard
shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Through ballistics testing, they also matched shell casings at
both crime scenes and determined they were fired from the same
9-millimeter semiautomatic handgun.</TE>
<TE>   Over the weekend, authorities at the Mexican border responded to
an incident of domestic violence involving one of the suspects and
his girlfriend. The woman told police that her boyfriend was involved
in the Lankershim Boulevard killing.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said they recovered about $3,200 from Catalan when he
was arrested. They allege that he planned to use the money to bribe
Mexican jail officials to protect him from U.S. authorities seeking
his extradition on the murder charge.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Superior Court Commissioner Michael Duffey on
Tuesday ordered sheriff's deputies to turn over the cash to the LAPD
as evidence.</TE>
<TE>   "After all the cases in the last two months, it was rewarding to
see this come together the way it did," Coffey said.</TE>
<TE>   There have been 24 killings in North Hollywood so far this year,
the majority gang-related. In contrast, detectives investigated 17
killings reported over the same period last year.</TE>

<HD>Developer Broke Promise Over Ancient Oak, Suit Alleges</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Seeking monetary damages, an injunction and a portable toilet, an
environmental group has filed a lawsuit accusing a developer of
breaking its promise to save a 400-year-old oak tree near Santa
Clarita that stands in the way of a road-widening project.</LD>
<LD>   In a civil complaint filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, the
Santa Clarita Organization for Planning the Environment accuses
developer John Laing Homes of fraud, breach of contract and unfair
business practices for failing to redesign the road project that
threatens the oak, dubbed Old Glory.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit, filed last month, alleges Laing officials reneged on
a deal they made with the environmental group in November 1999.</LD>
<TE>   Under the agreement, the company would realign the road and save
the nearby tree, and in return, activists would not challenge the
county's approval of its nearby housing development.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead," the complaint states, "John Laing used most if not all
of its vacant land adjacent to Old Glory to build $500,000-plus tract
homes ... making it difficult for [the company] to build out the road
construction project to a four-lane width."</TE>
<TE>   Activists say the agreement was spelled out in a Nov. 1, 1999,
letter from Laing officials, in which the company agrees to use
"good-faith efforts" to preserve oak trees in the canyon.</TE>
<TE>   Laing spokeswoman Annette McCluskey said she had not seen the
lawsuit. But she said the company lived up to its agreement, although
it is required to widen Pico Canyon Road under its county building
permit.</TE>
<TE>   Bowing to public protests, the developer recently announced that
it would relocate the tree at a cost of more than $250,000, rather
than cut it down.</TE>
<TE>   But environmentalists contend that moving the tree would kill it,
and activist John Quigley has refused to climb down from his
makeshift campsite in the towering oak. Quigley first climbed up the
tree on Nov. 1. Supporters have maintained a vigil at the base of the
tree, an area that was fenced off by the developer Nov. 14. The
lawsuit, however, claims the developer "falsely imprisoned" the
activists.</TE>
<TE>   The complaint also demands at least $50,000 in damages, an
injunction or restraining order to keep the tree where it is, and the
appointment of a state court receiver to take possession of the tree.
If the tree is lost, the suit demands that the developer purchase oak
forest land elsewhere in the Santa Clarita Valley as restitution.</TE>
<TE>   It also demands that a "temporary portable lavatory" be hauled
over the fence.</TE>

<LD>Seeking monetary damages, an injunction and a portable toilet, an
environmental group has filed a lawsuit accusing a developer of
breaking its promise to save a 400-year-old oak tree near Santa
Clarita that stands in the way of a road-widening project.</LD>

<TE>   Activists say the agreement was spelled out in a Nov. 1, 1999,

<TE>   Laing spokeswoman Annette McCluskey said she had not seen the

<TE>   Bowing to public protests, the developer recently announced that
it would relocate the tree at a cost of more than $250,000, rather
than cut it down.</TE>
<TE>   But environmentalists contend that moving the tree would kill it,
and activist John Quigley has refused to climb down from his
makeshift campsite in the towering oak.</TE>
<TE>   Quigley first climbed up the tree on Nov. 1 and vows to remain
there until an acceptable solution is found.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters have maintained a vigil at the base of the tree,
running food and supplies up to Quigley with ropes and pulleys. They
are in an area that was fenced off by the developer Nov. 14 and
marked with "No Trespassing" signs. Los Angeles County sheriff's
deputies have let supporters go in and out of the area without
arresting them.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit, however, claims the developer "falsely imprisoned"
the activists, and accuses Laing with inflicting "fear, anxiety,
humiliation, embarrassment, emotional distress and physical pain" on
them. Laing President Bill Rattazzi is accused of threatening to
spray the group with a high-pressure fire hose on Nov. 15.</TE>
<TE>   The complaint also demands at least $50,000 in damages, an
injunction or restraining order to keep the tree where it is, and the
appointment of a state court receiver to take possession of the tree.</TE>
<TE>   If the tree is lost, the suit demands that the developer purchase
oak forest land elsewhere in the Santa Clarita Valley as restitution.</TE>
<TE>   It also demands that a "temporary portable lavatory" be hauled
over the fence -- a request that puzzled Quigley, who said he was not
very familiar with the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, a lot of people have come by to visit the tree, and I
haven't heard there's been a bathroom issue down there," he said in a
cell phone interview Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "But it's possible."</TE>

<LD>A Ventura religious school has lost its bid for a court order to lift
city restrictions on its use of portable classroom buildings.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling by U.S. District Judge Christina Snyder came in
response to a request for a temporary injunction from Ventura County
Christian High School.</LD>
<LD>   The school contended the city illegally had kept it from using the
modular buildings it had placed on the campus of the old Washington
School, which it leases from the Ventura school district.</LD>
<TE>   As a result, enrollment has plunged by more than one-third,
putting the school at risk of closure, school officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of the school are in negotiations with the city,
said Nicholas Miller, the school's Los Angeles attorney.</TE>

<HD>Orange County Discovers Uncounted Absentee Ballots</HD>
<DH>No outcomes are changed after the votes are tallied and the
results certified. Supervisor Coad calls for an investigation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Seema Mehta</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Orange County registrar of voters office discovered early Tuesday
that it failed to count nearly 8,000 absentee ballots from the
November election, forcing officials to frantically reprocess the
votes so the Board of Supervisors could meet its state-mandated
Tuesday deadline to certify the results.</LD>
<LD>   Though the recount didn't change the outcome of any races, it was
an embarrassment that prompted the board's chairwoman to call for an
immediate investigation into the results of the November election.</LD>
<LD>   It's also the latest mistake to plague the county's aging
punch-card voting system, which would be replaced by a $25-million
computer system that the board is expected to vote on this month.</LD>
<TE>   "I certainly don't want a Florida here in Orange County," said
Board Chairwoman Cynthia P. Coad, referring to the botched vote
counting during the 2000 presidential election. "I just can't
understand how it happened."</TE>
<TE>   The problems probably occurred because a worker inserted an
incorrect "header card" into a vote-counting machine. A header card
tells the machine how to count a stack of ballots.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, absentee ballots cast by 7,991 residents of Anaheim,
Yorba Linda, San Clemente, Westminster and Fountain Valley were not
initially counted.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Rodermund, chief deputy registrar, said he first learned
Monday night that thousands of absentee ballots from San Clemente had
not been counted.</TE>
<TE>   City officials said they called the registrar Monday after
noticing discrepancies in the final numbers. The tally for the
November election showed that absentee ballots in San Clemente made
up 1.9% of the vote. They typically make up 28% to 30%.</TE>
<TE>   By Tuesday morning, officials concluded that ballots in four other
cities also were missed.</TE>
<TE>   The Board of Supervisors was scheduled to certify the election
results at 9:30 a.m. Tuesday, but the recounting had not been
finished. After Rodermund reported the uncounted votes, supervisors
delayed the certification vote until 12:30 p.m. Though the extra
votes didn't affect any outcomes, they did shave a six-vote
difference between two contenders for a Yorba Linda City Council seat
to three votes. That race is being recounted at the request by one of
the candidates.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though it was embarrassing, we came out and said we have a
problem and we need to do something about it and we did," Rodermund
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We could have tried to hide this, and we probably would have
gotten away with it. But that's not the way we work in Orange
County."</TE>
<TE>   Some elected officials, many of whom were attending swearing-in
ceremonies for new council members this week, were concerned about
the last-minute revelations.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County registrar has been embarrassed by a series of
errors in recent years, including incorrect sample ballots,
mislabeled candidates and political parties, improper Vietnamese
translation, missing fiscal analyses in voter pamphlets and precincts
running out of Spanish ballots on election day.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been ongoing concerns with the competence of the
registrar of voters," termed-out Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly said. "In
fairness to the operation, anything less than a Swiss watch becomes
very noticeable. But ... I think the supervisors probably are not
entirely surprised by yet another incident."</TE>
<TE>   Added San Clemente Mayor Jim Dahl: "I think they made a real
mistake here, and it needs to be investigated."</TE>
<TE>   After hearing of the lost votes, Coad called for an investigation
of the November vote tallies. County staffers must report back to
board members by Jan. 2.</TE>
<TE>   Under the current voting system, county residents punch their
choices on a series of cards, which are hand-fed into machines --
some up to three decades old -- that count and tally the vote. This
allows the introduction of human error, which county officials hope
to eliminate by moving to an electronic voting system.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 17, the Board of Supervisors is scheduled to discuss three
options: two touch-screen proposals that are similar to ATM machines
and a third that uses a mouse-like device that allows voters to
highlight their selection.</TE>
<TE>   A new system is expected to cost about $25 million. The county
expects to receive $16.7 million in state grant funds and $8.1
million in federal money to pay for it.</TE>
<TE>   After hearing of the latest problems, Supervisor Jim Silva added:
"It's pretty evident we have to go to touch-screen."</TE>

<TE>   City officials said they called the registrar Monday after
noticing discrepancies in the final numbers. The tally for the
November election showed that absentee ballots in San Clemente made
up 1.9% of the vote. They typically make up 28% to 30%.</TE>
<TE>   By Tuesday morning, officials concluded that ballots in four other
cities also were missed.</TE>
<TE>   The Board of Supervisors was scheduled to certify the election
results at 9:30 a.m. Tuesday, but the recounting had not been
finished. After Rodermund reported the uncounted votes, supervisors
delayed the certification vote until 12:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Though the extra votes didn't affect any outcomes, they did shave
a six-vote difference between two contenders for a Yorba Linda City
Council seat to three votes. That race is being recounted at the
request by one of the candidates.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though it was embarrassing, we came out and said we have a
problem and we need to do something about it and we did," Rodermund
said. "We could have tried to hide this, and we probably would have
gotten away with it. But that's not the way we work in Orange
County."</TE>
<TE>   Some elected officials, many of whom were attending swearing-in
ceremonies for new council members this week, were concerned about
the last-minute revelations.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County registrar has been embarrassed by a series of
errors in recent years, including incorrect sample ballots,
mislabeled candidates and political parties, improper Vietnamese
translation, missing fiscal analyses in voter pamphlets and precincts
running out of Spanish ballots on election day.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been ongoing concerns with the competence of the
registrar of voters," termed-out Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly said. "In
fairness to the operation, anything less than a Swiss watch becomes
very noticeable. But ... I think the supervisors probably are not
entirely surprised by yet another incident."</TE>
<TE>   Added San Clemente Mayor Jim Dahl: "I think they made a real
mistake here, and it needs to be investigated."</TE>
<TE>   After hearing of the lost votes, Coad called for an investigation
of the November 2002 election vote tallies. County staffers must
report back to board members by Jan. 2.</TE>
<TE>   Under the current voting system, county residents punch their
choices on a series of cards, which are hand-fed into machines --
some 3 decades old -- that count and tally the vote. This allows the
introduction of human error, which county officials hope to eliminate
by moving to an electronic voting system.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 17, the Board of Supervisors is scheduled to discuss three
options: two touch-screen proposals that are similar to ATM machines
and a third that uses a mouse-like device that allows voters to
highlight their selection.</TE>
<TE>   A new system is expected to cost about $25 million. The county
expects to receive $16.7 million in state grant funds and $8.1
million in federal money to pay for it.</TE>
<TE>   After hearing of the latest problems, Supervisor Jim Silva added:
"It's pretty evident we have to go to touch-screen."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Role in Afghanistan Shifting</HD>
<DH>More American troops are being deployed to rebuild
infrastructure. The move reflects the realization that a robust
economy is vital.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Kraul</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>When the Bush administration conceived the U.S. military mission in
Afghanistan after the defeat of the Taliban regime a year ago, it
envisioned the American forces as frontier lawmen rooting out Al
Qaeda and preventing terrorist cells from re-forming.</LD>
<LD>   What the administration didn't want, officials repeatedly said,
was for U.S. troops to become involved in nation-building in this
shattered country.</LD>
<LD>   But amid persistent violence here in the capital and in the
countryside, the U.S. military is now planning to redeploy large
numbers of soldiers to help rebuild Afghanistan.</LD>
<TE>   The new program reflects what Gen. Tommy Franks, the head of U.S.
Central Command, described here over the weekend as the U.S.
military's "evolving" role in Afghanistan. That role apparently will
shift from mainly combating terror to a greater responsibility for
undertaking and safeguarding reconstruction in a land devastated by
decades of war.</TE>
<TE>   Reconstruction is crucial to Afghanistan's recovery and to an end
of violence, because the jobs it generates will give Afghans an
economic alternative to fighting. But the process, officials here
acknowledge, has been jeopardized by ongoing insecurity and the
chilling effect that is having on public aid projects as well as
private investment.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the realization has sunk in here that the U.S. military
presence is likely to last years and that the "creation of economy,"
to use one official's phrase, is the best way to shorten it. Such
creation depends on the reconstruction of Afghanistan's
infrastructure and political institutions and on an influx of private
investment, both domestic and foreign.</TE>
<TE>   The new program, sources said, probably will not entail an
increase in the U.S. uniformed personnel here -- now roughly 8,000
troops.</TE>
<TE>   Although details of the new role are scarce, sources said it will
be an expanded version of an existing program in which small teams of
fewer than a dozen civil assistance troops, typically reservists, are
building bridges, schools and hospitals and dispensing medical aid in
11 Afghan locales under the protection of a few U.S. combat troops.</TE>
<TE>   A pilot program has been launched in the eastern city of Gardez,
with about 70 civil affairs soldiers doing reconstruction work,
sources said. The number of teams to be deployed in the expanding
program is still unknown.</TE>
<TE>   Depending on the locations involved, the new mission carries
risks. Until now, the bulk of U.S. troops have kept a low profile,
partly to minimize friction with Afghans who are ambivalent about the
presence of foreign military forces on their soil.</TE>
<TE>   The economic rebirth of Afghanistan depends on security, something
conspicuously lacking here. The U.S. military's violent encounters
with remnants of Al Qaeda and the Taliban have increased in recent
months, as have conflicts between rival regional militia commanders.</TE>
<TE>   Two incidents Monday night in the unsettled eastern part of the
country typified what U.S. troops are up against. In the first,
Special Forces troops narrowly thwarted a rocket attack on a base at
Lwara, scattering five people who were preparing to fire five rockets
at the base near the Pakistani border, U.S. military officials said.
One of the five was detained.</TE>
<TE>   In the second incident, a Special Forces unit came under
automatic-weapons fire from 10 fighters while on patrol near the city
of Jalalabad, military officials said. No U.S. casualties were
reported.</TE>
<TE>   Warlords are fighting it out in three regions of Afghanistan, with
a weekend confrontation near the western city of Herat, the most
violent to date, having claimed at least 12 lives, according to news
reports.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, a patrol of U.S. Special Forces troops came under fire
from one of the warring parties in western Afghanistan, prompting the
soldiers to call for air support from a B-52 patrolling the region.
It dropped eight laser-guided, one-ton bombs on the militia elements,
the first such B-52 raid in months.</TE>
<TE>   "While things seem to be OK for Afghanistan ... we still see a lot
of problems," Franks told reporters Saturday. "The truth of it is
that while a lot has been done, this is Afghanistan. We're going to
have to stay with it for as long as it takes to be sure to not permit
terrorism to retake Afghanistan."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer David Zucchino in Herat contributed to this
report.</TE>

Egyptian American sociologist, overturning his conviction for
tarnishing the nation's image with his writings on democracy and
human rights.</LD>
<LD>   Saad Eddin Ibrahim, 64, was released immediately after the ruling
and drove out of Cairo's Tora prison.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a wonderful day," wife Barbara Ibrahim said. Human rights
groups had condemned her husband's conviction and seven-year sentence
last year as politically motivated, and the case strained ties with
the U.S.</LD>

<HD>Burundi Reaches a Truce Deal With One of Its Two Main Rebel
Groups</HD>
<DH>African leaders who brokered agreement warn second
guerrilla force to lay down arms.</DH>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>BUJUMBURA, Burundi</DL>
<LD>The government of Burundi and one of two main rebel forces signed a
cease-fire Tuesday to try to end a nine-year war, and African leaders
told the other group to stop fighting or face sanctions.</LD>
<LD>   The cease-fire deal struck by the government and the Forces for
the Defense of Democracy rebel group, or FDD, followed months of
haggling. President Pierre Buyoya of Burundi's interim government
shook hands with FDD leader Pierre Nkurunziza after they signed the
accord, brokered by African leaders, in the northern Tanzanian city
of Arusha. A summit statement said the FDD would become a political
party and take part in "power-sharing arrangements of the
transitional government" after discussions between the government and
the FDD about how this could be accomplished.</LD>
<LD>   The other rebel group, the National Liberation Forces, or FNL,
dismissed the sanctions threat. It says it will negotiate only after
government soldiers return to barracks, refugees are repatriated,
political prisoners are released, and it is admitted as a political
party.</LD>
<TE>   Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, who chairs a peace effort for
Burundi, called on FNL rebels to lay down their weapons and warned,
"We are on the verge of some pretty robust sanctions that will stop
them from fighting."</TE>
<TE>   The war between rebels from the ethnic Hutu majority and the
Tutsi-led army has killed an estimated 300,000 people in the Central
African country. A government with power shared between Hutus and
Tutsis was inaugurated last year. But until the latest summit, the
government had not managed to sign a truce with either rebel group.</TE>

<HD>Russia Forcing Chechen Refugees Out of Camps, Rights Groups
Say</HD>
<DH>Evacuees must return to their dangerous homeland. Activists
say the expulsion is part of Moscow's campaign to show that war is
over.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Dixon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>Chechen refugees in southern Russia are being forced to exchange a
miserable existence in tent camps for a life of equal deprivation but
more fear and danger as part of a government campaign to empty the
camps, human rights groups charged Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   With temperatures below freezing, the last families in the Iman
camp near the Ingush town of Aki-Yurt left Tuesday. Authorities had
threatened to cut off gas and electricity in the camp, forcing the
1,500 residents to leave for Chechnya, rights groups said.</LD>
<LD>   "There is no doubt that what happened to the Iman camp was a
forcible eviction. The people there simply did not have any other
choice," said Viskhan Basayev of Memorial, a human rights group in
Nazran, Ingushetia. "The return of the refugees to Chechnya has been
carried out according to a pure Soviet scenario -- it was what Soviet
people sarcastically used to call 'a forced voluntary' return."</LD>
<TE>   Alexander Rostovtsev of the Interior Ministry's Federal Migration
Service, which is responsible for the refugees, insisted that they
left voluntarily. But human rights groups said refugees were given
food if they signed documents stating that their departure was
voluntary.</TE>
<TE>   Rights groups say Russia wants 20,000 Chechen refugees out of
other camps by late December. According to the United Nations,
110,000 refugees are squatting or living in Ingushetia.</TE>
<TE>   The removal of the refugees is part of Russia's campaign to show
the world that the Chechen war is over, said Svetlana Gannushkina,
head of the Civic Assistance organization, who arrived in Moscow from
Ingushetia on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "They want the world to think that the war in Chechnya is over and
thousands of former refugees are swarming back to their homes. But
there is nothing but lies behind these statements," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The siege of a Moscow theater in October by Chechen rebels who
took more than 700 hostages raised doubts that the Chechen separatist
resistance had been crushed.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in Chechnya, rebels have continued their guerrilla
attacks, which have claimed several lives each week, and bomb and
mine explosions have been common. In August, rebels shot down a
military helicopter, killing 119 Russian servicemen -- more than in
any other incident in the Chechen war.</TE>
<TE>   Russian forces have been strongly criticized by international
human rights groups for their zachistki, or operations in which they
"clean up" villages. They have been accused of looting and rape, and
many of those they have arrested have never been seen again.</TE>
<TE>   Human rights groups dispute Russian claims that Chechnya is safe
and say refugees should not be pressured to return. Basayev said
refugees from the Iman camp had squatted in a distillery and a
derelict chicken farm, where conditions were appalling. "But going
back to Grozny is even worse," he said, referring to the Chechen
capital.</TE>
<TE>   Gannushkina said local officials intimidated refugees into
leaving.</TE>
<TE>   "They threatened to shut off gas or electricity supplies, they
painted somber pictures of hungry children having to survive the
winter in cold tents and totally unsanitary conditions, etc. They
even threatened to bulldoze over the tents and dirt houses left in
the camp," she said. "No one wanted to go, and everyone was afraid.
They know that people get killed in Chechnya on a regular basis."</TE>
<TE>   Danish authorities Tuesday rebuffed a Russian demand that they
extradite Ahmed Zakayev, spokesman for Chechen rebel leader Aslan
Maskhadov. The authorities said Russia did not provide sufficient
evidence to extradite him.</TE>
<TE>   Russia sought Zakayev's extradition after the October hostage
crisis, accusing him of terrorist acts committed between 1996 and
1999. Zakayev was released by Danish authorities Tuesday.</TE>

<HD>China to Host 2010 World's Fair</HD>
<DH>Jubilation greets news of Shanghai's selection as site of
the expo. It marks a first for a developing country and another
milestone for the city.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ching-Ching Ni</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SHANGHAI</DL>
<LD>China won the right Tuesday to host the World Exposition in 2010, the
first time a developing country will do so since the fair began 151
years ago in London.</LD>
<LD>   The victory is a feather in the cap of the world's most populous
country, which recently realized its dream of being chosen to host
the 2008 Olympics. The selection also confirms the growing influence
of the bidding city, Shanghai, China's thriving economic powerhouse.</LD>
<LD>   "It's been our wish for many years to bring home the World Expo.
We promise to honor our pledge to put on the most exciting, most
unforgettable and most successful expo ever," Shanghai Mayor Chen
Liangyu said Tuesday from Monte Carlo, where the International Bureau
of Expositions made the selection.</LD>
<TE>   In Shanghai, crowds gathered on Nanjing Road under a neon-lighted
banner proclaiming, "We did it!" Fireworks illuminated the night sky.
Celebrities sang folk songs and Italian opera. Young people waved red
flags, and senior citizens banged on waist drums.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a happy day for all of China," said Feng Ai, a student
from the city's Fudan University.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibition selection was one of the most contested in recent
history. The other contenders were South Korea, Russia, Mexico and
Poland.</TE>
<TE>   Shanghai has become a symbol of China's transformation from a
backward command economy to one of the fastest-growing in the world.
Under the theme, "Better City, Better Life," the city has the central
government's support to invest $3 billion in infrastructure projects.
It expects to attract more than 70 million visitors, which would make
the fair the biggest and possibly the most lucrative in history.</TE>
<TE>   "It will create a lot of business investment opportunities and
make Shanghai more environmentally friendly and a better city to live
in," said William Keller, general manager in China for the Swiss
pharmaceutical giant Roche, which has a plant in Shanghai.</TE>
<TE>   City officials are confident of their ability to manage the
high-profile international event based on a recent track record that
has included successfully hosting last year's Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation summit and last month's Masters Cup tennis tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Expos are opportunities for the world to showcase the latest
technological advances. Some of the most notable inventions of modern
life -- including the telephone, the television, asbestos and the
steam engine -- made their debuts at past world fairs.</TE>
<TE>   For the 2010 fair, Shanghai plans to clean up an industrial
stretch along the Huangpu River and transform it into a sprawling
green space of exhibition halls.</TE>
<TE>   But in many ways, image-conscious Shanghai is already making
efforts to turn this former colonial outpost into a trend-setter. In
the works are the planet's fastest train, longest arched bridge,
biggest Ferris wheel and tallest building.</TE>
<TE>   To show solidarity and encourage the participation of fellow
developing countries, which traditionally have been neglected by the
expos, China has offered them free transportation and accommodations.</TE>
<TE>   "Among 6 billion inhabitants on the planet, 5 billion live in the
developing world," said Wu Jianmin, China's ambassador to France,
where the International Bureau of Expositions is based. "However,
during its 151 years of existence, the World Expo has never been held
in a developing country."</TE>
<TE>   Developing countries, Wu added, "will not be marginalized during
the Shanghai Expo 2010."</TE>
<TE>   The Chinese are well aware that their country has a long way to go
to make the 2010 fair a success. China faces mounting social
problems, including unemployment and a widening gap between rich and
poor. It remains to be seen whether holding such an expensive global
gathering is the best use of the country's limited resources.</TE>
<TE>   "The world has given us an opportunity, but it doesn't mean we're
now perfect," said Li Yixing, a public relations consultant in
Shanghai. "We shouldn't have any false illusions."</TE>

<HD>Powell Visits Colombia to Reinforce Ties</HD>
<DH>Secretary's first official trip to country comes as
besieged nation assumes presidency of U.N. Security Council, which
oversees the Iraq debate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Richter</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BOGOTA, Colombia</DL>
<LD>U.S. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell flew here Tuesday to
demonstrate support for an embattled ally, just as Colombia has taken
on a U.N. role that could enable it to help the Bush administration's
efforts to keep pressure on Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   Powell said he made his first official visit to the country --
after twice canceling plans for earlier visits -- to show solidarity
with the government of President Alvaro Uribe. Since taking office
four months ago, Uribe has embarked on an aggressive campaign to
confront the leftist rebels and right-wing paramilitary forces who
have waged civil war for 38 years.</LD>
<LD>   This week "seemed a good time to reinforce our commitment to
Colombia," Powell told reporters on his plane.</LD>
<TE>   In an interview with a Colombian newspaper on Monday, Powell said
he expects to see Colombia take an active role this month as
temporary president of the U.N. Security Council, a post that
includes overseeing the debate on how Iraq is complying with weapons
inspections. Baghdad faces a Sunday deadline to release a declaration
of any chemical, biological and nuclear materials.</TE>
<TE>   "December could be a very important month in the Security Council,
and I expect Colombia would be an active chair -- in making sure the
council deliberates with utmost seriousness on the elements of the
declaration," Powell told the Colombian newspaper El Tiempo.</TE>
<TE>   He also said he was preparing to ask Congress next year for a
continuation of the Colombian aid that has totaled nearly $2 billion
over the last several years.</TE>
<TE>   The visit is considered overdue by Colombian officials, who have
privately lamented that the U.S. has not been able to pay enough
attention to their country because of the war on terrorism and the
confrontation with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Since he was sworn in last August, Uribe has sharply stepped up
military activities against the rebel forces, instituted emergency
measures to make arrests and prosecutions easier, and arranged to
levy a new tax that will funnel nearly $1 billion into the armed
forces.</TE>
<TE>   Some human rights advocates have expressed concern that the new
government could go too far, but the Bush administration has so far
expressed general agreement with the approach.</TE>
<TE>   Powell noted in his remarks to reporters that U.S.-trained forces
have recently increased their aerial spraying to destroy coca plants,
from which cocaine is derived. And he noted that last week, the large
paramilitary group United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, or AUC,
announced a unilateral cease-fire after secret talks with the
government.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we've got some good things going," Powell said.</TE>
<TE>   But Powell will not be able to immediately deliver what Colombians
seem to want most, which is a resumption of U.S. intelligence aid to
help Colombian and Peruvian authorities track down drug-carrying
aircraft by using high-tech surveillance planes.</TE>
<TE>   The CIA-directed program was suspended in April 2001 after a U.S.
missionary and her infant daughter were killed when the aircraft
carrying them was mistakenly shot down by the Peruvian air force.</TE>
<TE>   American and South American officials have since been working to
retool the program to ensure that personnel are properly trained and
supervised.</TE>
<TE>   Powell said he was "anxious to get it started as soon as
possible," though he declined to predict when the program could
resume. Experts on Colombia said Colombian officials are especially
eager to restart the program because they believe it can be highly
effective in interrupting drug trafficking.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the itch they want to scratch," said Phillip McLean, a
senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies
in Washington.</TE>

<HD>Pentagon Plans to Deploy Journalists in Iraq</HD>
<DH>In a new media strategy, hundreds of reporters and
photographers will be 'embedded' in front-line units in the event of
war, officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Johanna Neuman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Pentagon, in a departure from recent policy, is planning to
deploy hundreds of print reporters, photographers and television
journalists with front-line U.S. units if there is a war with Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   Faced with the churn of 24/7 news and the prospect that Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein will mount an effective media campaign of
his own, Pentagon officials have concluded that reporters "embedded"
with units will be more credible witnesses to history than military
briefers.</LD>
<LD>   Pentagon spokeswoman Victoria Clarke won't say yet how often, for
how long and with what units reporters might be deployed -- although
she says the Pentagon is contemplating attaching them to air as well
as ground troops, and in the "first wave" of any attack.</LD>
<TE>   "We are absolutely convinced the more news and information that
comes out of Iraq -- if there's military action -- the better off
we'll all be," Clarke said. "It's fine for Torie Clarke to stand up
there and say we went to extraordinary lengths to avoid hitting
civilians. It is a far better thing for a bona fide, credible source
of information -- the news media -- to be saying that based on
experience."</TE>
<TE>   The new media strategy is an acknowledgment by the Pentagon that
winning the war of words and images is crucial to the mission in
Iraq. But it is also a concession that the post-Vietnam arrangement
for war coverage -- which relied largely on tightly controlled pools
of reporters sending back copy for their briefing-bound colleagues --
hasn't worked for either journalists or, in some sense, the military.</TE>
<TE>   "This represents a shift away from what we saw following Vietnam
-- that whole philosophy of keeping the press away from the
battlefield except in the most highly controlled manner," said
Clarence R. Wyatt, a history professor at Centre College in Kentucky
and author of "Paper Soldiers," a book about Vietnam War coverage.
"We had examples of pool coverage in Grenada and Panama, and then
that philosophy came to full flower in the Gulf War. Absolutely, this
is an improvement."</TE>
<TE>   It isn't unprecedented for the Pentagon to plant journalists among
combat troops. And these reporters wouldn't be the only source of
news -- media outlets still plan to send journalists to cover an Iraq
war independent of the military, and to cover the briefings expected
out of Qatar. But the new policy may put more reporters with troops
in battle than in any war since World War II, when reporters wore the
uniforms of the units they covered and wrote stories, a la Ernie
Pyle, glorifying the heroism of individual soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly this is a step beyond anything in recent memory," said
Kenneth Bacon, a spokesman at the Pentagon during the Clinton
administration. "The key will be how well it works -- whether
reporters get cleared to file."</TE>
<TE>   Some reporters remain skeptical that the Pentagon will actually
deliver the kind of access that Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld
and Clarke have been discussing with Washington bureau chiefs.</TE>
<TE>   In part, that is because of the experience in the U.S. campaign in
Afghanistan, where access to American forces was limited for weeks.
And the media are still smarting over coverage restrictions during
the 1991 Persian Gulf War, when journalists saw very little action
and some information -- such as the number of Iraqi civilian
casualties -- wasn't reported until after the war.</TE>
<TE>   Access Is Key</TE>
<TE>   "There's an expression in the military that no plan survives the
first contact with the enemy," CNN reporter Jamie McIntyre said of
the Pentagon's new media strategy. "We didn't get much access in
Afghanistan, and it doesn't look like we're going to get much in
Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   Even when journalists agree to ground rules designed to protect
operational security, he argued, the speed of modern technology
frightens commanders in combat. "The more we have capability to go
live, the more nervous they are," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some in the media worry that the new strategy will skewer
coverage, tilting it toward individual valor instead of providing a
comprehensive picture of war.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a terrible conflict for reporters," said John Fialka, a Wall
Street Journal reporter who wrote a book, "Hotel Warriors," on Gulf
War coverage. "It does not give you good history, which journalism
should be."</TE>
<TE>   But other reporters argue that large-scale access will benefit
both the press and the military. "The promise of such widespread
access is an enormously positive change from where we were at the
start of the Persian Gulf War," said Clark Hoyt, Washington editor
for Knight-Ridder newspapers. "If they follow through and it turns
out the way it appears to be heading, it will give the American
people a chance to learn about war as it unfolds, assuming there is a
war, in a way that was simply not possible during the Persian Gulf
War."</TE>
<TE>   Capt. T. McCreary, public affairs advisor to Joint Chiefs of Staff
Chairman Richard B. Myers, said that Afghanistan changed many
military minds about media coverage.</TE>
<TE>   "Afghanistan was the watershed event," he said. "We had an enemy
with a strategy designed to put out false stories in the Arab media.
We were always fighting to keep up. If we don't do this, we will
always be losing the information game. Reacting from Washington to
the enemy in theater is painful."</TE>
<TE>   Jon B. Alterman, a scholar at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies in Washington, agrees, arguing that the
information war is the only real weapon available to the Iraqi
president.</TE>
<TE>   "He can't win militarily, although he can try to make it painful
for us, and he can't win diplomatically, because even his friends
distrust him," Alterman said. "What he has done reasonably well for
12 years is to create images -- images of starving children."</TE>
<TE>   To prepare for the invasion of journalists, the Pentagon recently
conducted a "boot camp" for reporters and plans another this month --
a two-week drill session instructing them on such issues as how to
use a camera without giving away troop locations to the enemy and how
to survive a chemical weapons attack.</TE>
<TE>   Ever since Vietnam, the media and the Pentagon have fought over
access.</TE>
<TE>   In the Gulf War, the two sides agreed to a pool system. Robbed of
access to important battles, reporters chafed at the restrictions. In
the opening days of the Gulf War, CBS' Bob Simon and his crew
ventured near the Saudi-Iraqi border on their own and were captured
by the Iraqis.</TE>
<TE>   After the Gulf War, reporters expressed anger at the Pentagon for
restricting access to the battlefield. But polls -- to say nothing of
a "Saturday Night Live" skit that belittled reporters for asking
stupid questions -- found that most Americans supported the military.</TE>
<TE>   Mission the Priority</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is, you've got to accomplish your mission,"
then-Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said just after the war. "You've
got to do it at the lowest possible cost in terms of American lives.
And that takes precedence over how you deal with the press."</TE>
<TE>   Now, senior Pentagon officials have calculated that saturating the
media with access to U.S. forces will serve as a buffer against the
latest "weapon" in enemy hands: access to Qatari-based Al Jazeera
television and other Arab news outlets.</TE>
<TE>   "In the case of Iraq and Afghanistan, there was a great degree of
skill in news management," Rumsfeld told bureau chiefs recently. The
Taliban and Al Qaeda put their military facilities "in close
proximity to hospitals and nursing homes and schools and
sympathy-engendering locations."</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon may also have realized that placing reporters with
U.S. troops will serve to tell the story of personal heroics that is
largely missing from the files of the Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   As Knight-Ridder's Hoyt said, "A lot of the military were
disappointed at the lack of coverage and opportunity for people back
home -- families, colleagues -- to know in some firsthand eyewitness
way what they had achieved."</TE>

<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>A raid on the apartment of an alleged member of the Hamburg cell that
led the Sept. 11 attacks turned up the business card of a diplomat
from the Saudi Embassy in Berlin, and Saudi officials have not
responded to German requests to explain how the defendant came to
have the card, a German police officer testified Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Joerg Klose said that the Moroccan defendant, Mounir Motassadeq,
also made repeated calls to Saudi Arabia from Hamburg and that German
intelligence had traced the calls to Islamic radicals in the kingdom.</LD>
<LD>   Motassadeq, 28, an electrical engineering student, is charged with
more than 3,000 counts of accessory to murder and membership in a
terrorist organization.</LD>

<DL>BOGOTA, Colombia</DL>
<LD>A judge adjourned until February the trial of three suspected members
of the Irish Republican Army charged with training Marxist rebels to
build bombs, after key prosecution witnesses failed to appear in
court Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Jairo Acosta ordered the trial, which began Monday, to
resume Feb. 5, giving two rebel defectors another chance to testify
that they witnessed the Irishmen training the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, or FARC. Niall Connolly, James Monaghan and
Martin McCauley could face 20 years in prison if found guilty of
collaboration with the rebels. The three were arrested at a Bogota
airport last year, trying to leave the country with false passports.</LD>

<HD>Iraq's Apparent Compliance Fails to Lift Regional Anxiety</HD>
<DH>Around the Mideast, pessimism remains over the likelihood
of a military conflict.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael Slackman and Maggie Farley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>CAIRO</DL>
<LD>Iraqi officials allowed U.N. weapons inspectors immediate access to a
presidential palace Tuesday, but Baghdad's apparent compliance with a
tough new Security Council resolution has done little to lower
regional anxiety over the prospect of war.</LD>
<LD>   When weapons inspectors were in Iraq four years ago, the regime
balked at allowing unannounced inspections of President Saddam
Hussein's many lavish compounds. This time, there had been a great
deal of uncertainty over whether Iraq would let inspectors into the
compounds, or would defy the United Nations and risk attack.</LD>
<LD>   But even after the gates to the Al Sajoud palace swung open
Tuesday, there was little sense that the prospect of military
conflict had diminished. As the deadline for Iraq to turn over a
statement outlining any of its banned weapons programs looms this
weekend, too many other signs suggest that war is inevitable,
observers said.</LD>
<TE>   "I have to say, I am pessimistic, but I am hoping for the best,"
said Hisham Youssef, spokesman for the 22-member Arab League.</TE>
<TE>   In recent days, President Bush has said Iraq's efforts at
disarming are "not encouraging," and Defense Secretary Donald H.
Rumsfeld said Tuesday that if inspectors don't find anything, it
merely means that Iraq has hidden its weapons very well.</TE>
<TE>   "The United States knows that Iraq has weapons of mass
destruction. The U.K. knows that they have weapons of mass
destruction. Any country on the face of the Earth with an active
intelligence program knows that Iraq has weapons of mass
destruction," Rumsfeld said.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. and its allies are trying to counter any sympathy that
Iraq's compliance might engender, especially in the Arab world, with
a multifaceted campaign showcasing Iraq as an "evildoer." Britain
released a dossier Monday outlining human rights violations in Iraq;
the U.S. continues to bomb suspected military targets in southern
Iraq's "no-fly" zone; and on Tuesday, Kuwait's Interior Ministry said
an Iraqi boat fired on two Kuwaiti coast guard vessels in Kuwaiti
waters.</TE>
<TE>   And although U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan praised Iraq's
cooperation so far, he had trouble mustering a great deal of
optimism. "This is only the beginning," he said Tuesday at U.N.
headquarters in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Taken together, these events have overshadowed Iraq's public
relations efforts, leaving the perception among many in the region
that the exercise of inspections is an expensive, complex, drawn-out
prelude to war.</TE>
<TE>   "U.S. and British efforts aimed at condemning Iraq by any means
possible confirm the two countries' intentions to start a war at any
price," said a commentary in the Qatari daily Al Rayah on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Weapons inspectors resumed their work in Iraq last week armed with
a Security Council mandate that gives them the right to go anywhere
at any time, with no warning. Should Iraq fail to comply, Resolution
1441 threatens "severe consequences," which can be taken to mean a
U.S.-led invasion.</TE>
<TE>   But as their first week of work ended without incident, Bush tried
to downplay the importance of inspections. The issue in Iraq "is not
the inspectors," he said Tuesday at the Louisiana state fairgrounds
in Shreveport.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue is whether or not Mr. Saddam Hussein will disarm like
he said he would," Bush said. "We're not interested in a
hide-and-seek inside Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   This morning, inspectors went to the Al Tuwaithi compound operated
by Iraq's nuclear power authority in Salman Pak, south of the
capital.</TE>
<TE>   From the moment the inspectors arrived in Baghdad, the Iraqi
regime and the teams searching for nuclear, biological and chemical
weapons have tried to demonstrate a willingness to work together. The
inspectors started off slowly, going to sites that were not deemed to
be controversial. Iraq appeared to readily comply with all demands,
allowing inspectors free and immediate access.</TE>
<TE>   But the Security Council resolution is studded with trip wires.
One includes demands for access to presidential sites, and Iraq
seemed to step over that one successfully Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The most sensitive, however, is pegged to Sunday, when Iraq must
turn over the statement listing everything in its arsenal. The U.S.
and Britain say banned weapons programs exist; Iraq insists they do
not. Iraqi officials have reaffirmed their position in recent days,
and if the regime sticks to that line -- which is not at all certain
given its history -- it could be a trigger for war.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to deliver this declaration in the proper time on
the 7th of this month," Gen. Hussam Mohammed Amin, the head of the
Iraqi National Monitoring Directorate, said Tuesday. "Of course the
declaration will have new elements. But these new elements will not,
shall we say, necessarily include a declaration of the presence of
weapons of mass destruction. We are a country devoid of weapons of
mass destruction."</TE>
<TE>   Iraq has tried to present itself as a victim willing to comply
with demands that it says violate its sovereignty. But there already
are signs of strain. At one inspection site recently, protesters
undoubtedly working with government authorization hung a banner
attacking America. Perhaps more ominous was a U.N. report saying
inspectors had discovered that equipment was missing from the Karama
ballistics design plant in Baghdad, a rocket factory previously
bombed by the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Iraqi officials said the missing equipment had been either
destroyed in the bombing or transferred to another site. But because
it is mandatory that previously inspected and tagged items not be
moved, such incidents could, if cumulative, be used to add
credibility to Washington's suspicions.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a psychological war being waged at the moment by the
U.S., aided by the U.K.'s Labor Party headed by Prime Minister Tony
Blair, against Iraq," said Mohammed Saleh Musfir, a political science
professor at Qatar University. "They are using every method possible
to find excuses to attack Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   Four years ago, the United States cited Iraqi officials' refusal
to allow unannounced inspections of presidential palaces as one of
the reasons for a U.S.-led bombing campaign.</TE>
<TE>   This time, nervous guards opened the gates early Tuesday when half
a dozen U.N. vehicles pulled up at one entrance and another convoy
pulled up at a second. The inspectors spent an hour and a half inside
the palace, which has offices and living quarters. They said nothing
as they drove off.</TE>

<HD>Israeli Army Investigates Shooting of a Palestinian
Matriarch</HD>
<DH>The woman was shot by a soldier, who may have acted in
breach of regulations, as her taxi attempted to get around a West
Bank checkpoint.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Laura King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>A 95-year-old Palestinian woman earned a grim distinction Tuesday,
becoming the oldest known person to be killed in the violence that
has raged between Israel and the Palestinians for the past 26 months.</LD>
<LD>   The woman, Fatima Hassan, was shot to death by an Israeli soldier
outside the West Bank city of Ramallah as she rode in a taxi van that
was trying, in a maneuver commonplace in the Palestinian territories,
to make its way around an Israeli checkpoint by using a back road.</LD>
<LD>   The army said initially that troops had fired at the taxi's tires
to try to halt its progress along the road, whose use was forbidden
to Palestinians.</LD>
<TE>   Late Tuesday, Israel's Channel Two television station reported
that the Israeli soldier who fired a volley of shots at the taxi was
running toward it as he did so -- making it very difficult for him to
aim with accuracy -- an apparent breach of army regulations.</TE>
<TE>   Army policy permits shooting in self-defense or at a defined
target. The Channel Two report said that at least 17 shots were fired
at the moving vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Hassan, who suffered a fatal wound to the back, two
other female passengers in the taxi were hurt, according to
Palestinian medical officials.</TE>
<TE>   The army said the incident was being investigated at the highest
levels.</TE>
<TE>   The army also said troops in the area had ample reason to be
jittery. Only an hour earlier, it said, a Palestinian taxi had
deliberately tried to run down troops at a checkpoint near the
village of Surda, north of Ramallah.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an attempt to kill the soldiers, just shortly before this
happened, and very close to this same spot," an army spokeswoman said
on the condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   She said the Palestinian driver in that incident had been arrested
without injury to himself or soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   The circumstances of Hassan's death are likely to raise sharp new
questions about Israeli military procedures and the risks they may
pose to Palestinian civilians facing ever-tightening restrictions on
their movements between West Bank towns and villages.</TE>
<TE>   Ramallah, where Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat's
headquarters are located, has been under recurring Israeli military
curfews in recent months.</TE>
<TE>   The army says it carefully investigates each instance of
Palestinian civilian casualties under questionable circumstances, but
Palestinians insist that soldiers routinely violate stated army
policy in their dealings with Palestinian civilians.</TE>
<TE>   It was not immediately known why the army considered the taxi to
be a threat -- or why its driver failed to stop as ordered.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians say drivers often don't understand commands shouted
at them in Hebrew by soldiers, or sometimes panic and believe their
best chance is to try to quickly escape any potential confrontation.</TE>
<TE>   Even before the outbreak of violence that swept the Palestinian
territories beginning in September 2000, Israeli army checkpoints
scattered throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip had been a source
of tension. The barriers fill Palestinians with frustration and fury.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians, backed by human rights groups, say Israeli soldiers
arbitrarily harass and intimidate ordinary people -- teachers,
doctors, students, laborers -- who are trying to move from one part
of the West Bank to another, often for urgent matters relating to
work and family.</TE>
<TE>   Israel, on the other hand, considers the checkpoints -- and
stringent restrictions on the use of back roads that provide
circuitous routes around them -- a key safeguard against the movement
of Palestinian militants and weaponry, and thus a crucial tool for
fighting the plague of suicide attacks in Israeli cities and towns.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians are well aware of the dangers of traveling proscribed
routes but say they have no choice if they want to get to work or
school, visit family or keep doctor appointments.</TE>
<TE>   One of the taxi's wounded passengers, Kifaya Qadadha, described
what she called an indiscriminate hail of gunfire aimed at the van.</TE>
<TE>   "There was so much shooting," she told journalists from her
hospital bed in Ramallah. "We were terrified."</TE>
<TE>   Relatives described Hassan as a family matriarch, a
great-grandmother. When her body arrived at Ramallah hospital after
the shooting, sobbing family members clustered around and bent over
the stretcher, tearing aside the sheet covering the elderly woman to
kiss her face.</TE>
<TE>   "She was old, but this was not the way to end her life," said her
58-year-old daughter, Aisha, weeping.</TE>
<TE>   On both sides, the conflict's victims have ranged from infants to
the aged.</TE>
<TE>   Several Holocaust survivors in their 80s were among those injured
and killed in a suicide bombing at a Passover Seder at a hotel in the
Israeli seaside town of Netanya in March -- an attack that triggered
a wide-ranging Israeli invasion of the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Human rights groups said, however, that Hassan was the oldest
recorded fatality during more than two years of fighting.</TE>

<HD>Popular Palestinian Calls for Change</HD>
<DH>Grass-roots leader in Israeli jail says Arafat regime has
failed in its role during intifada.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>One of the most popular leaders of the Palestinian uprising issued a
prison-cell appeal Tuesday for high-level change in the Palestinian
Authority -- the first time Marwan Barghouti has openly challenged
the authority's president, Yasser Arafat.</LD>
<LD>   The call came as Arafat's battered security services made their
first reported arrests of Palestinian militants in months.</LD>
<LD>   Barghouti has maintained grass-roots appeal and avoided the stain
of corruption that has tainted many of Arafat's supporters. His call
for new leadership seemed to reflect Arafat's falling popularity
among his people, as prominent Palestinians begin to speak out
against the Palestinian leader's handling of the two-year conflict
with Israel.</LD>
<TE>   Barghouti did not name Arafat in his written response to questions
presented to him in prison by his lawyer, Khader Shkirat.</TE>
<TE>   "It is time for many of the Palestinian leaders and officials to
leave their positions after failing in their roles and
responsibilities in this decisive battle," Barghouti said, referring
to the Palestinian uprising. "This should be done in a democratic and
legal way as soon as possible."</TE>
<TE>   Though some leaders have criticized the armed attacks on Israelis
as harmful to the Palestinian cause, Barghouti backed violent
elements of the uprising. However, until the fighting broke out in
September 2000, he was a staunch advocate of peace talks with Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Barghouti was arrested in April and is on trial for attacks that
killed 26 Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat also has been under pressure to crack down on militants. On
Tuesday, the militant Democratic Front for the Liberation of
Palestine said seven of its members were arrested by Palestinian
intelligence services in the Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   Among them was Isam abu Daka, a top leader in Khan Yunis who also
is wanted by Israel. Israeli forces demolished his house March 6 and
arrested seven of his brothers.</TE>

<HD>EU Blacklists 66 Vessels</HD>
<DH>Alliance urges ban on transporting heavy fuel in
single-hull ships, in wake of spill off Spain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>AGUINO, Spain</DL>
<LD>The European Union on Tuesday blacklisted 66 ships that it deemed
unsafe and proposed a fast-track ban on transporting heavy fuel oil
in single-hull tankers like the ship that broke apart at sea two
weeks ago, devastating Spain's Galician coast.</LD>
<LD>   The EU's European Commission in Brussels said the need to prohibit
single-hulled tankers like the Prestige from ferrying toxic heavy
fuel oil is so urgent that it should bypass the normal bureaucracy
and be taken up by heads of state at a summit in Copenhagen next
week.</LD>
<LD>   As part of the new get-tough stance on aging tankers by some
European governments, France sent a warship to force a 24-year-old
oil tanker away from its coast Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   A Spanish frigate was also reported to be on watch to make sure
the Enalios-Titan, a single-hull tanker loaded with fuel oil, did not
enter Spanish waters.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks after the Prestige broke in two and plunged to the
bottom of the Atlantic, Spain is still mopping up thousands of tons
of fuel oil.</TE>
<TE>   Already, 179 beaches have been coated with sludge, and unknown
numbers of fish, seabirds and dolphins have died. More than 4,000
fishermen have been put out of work under a fishing ban covering more
than 300 miles of coastline.</TE>
<TE>   In Madrid, Deputy Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and Mans Jacobsson,
head of the International Oil Pollution Compensation Funds, agreed to
compensate those affected by the spill.</TE>
<TE>   Portugal fears that fuel oil from the Prestige could hit its
coastline as early as today. Henrique Freitas, secretary of state for
defense, told a Portuguese television station that several small
slicks from the tanker were 16 miles from Portugal's northern coast.</TE>
<TE>   A small slick has been reported headed toward France.</TE>
<TE>   Desperate fishermen in Spain took to their boats Tuesday, using
makeshift tools and gloved hands to scoop toxic fuel oil from the
sea.</TE>
<TE>   Their efforts came as a fleet of eight clean-up vessels went to
work sucking up oil. The specialized ships have collected 7,000 tons
of the 17,000 estimated to have escaped from the tanker.</TE>
<TE>   On land, volunteers and hired teams had scraped 2,700 tons of
residue off beaches, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, a slick floated just seven miles from the entrance to
an estuary that contains mussel and oyster beds.</TE>
<TE>   The first pictures taken by a French mini-submarine sent to the
Prestige found no sign that the tanker was still leaking oil.
Officials hope the bulk of the cargo has solidified.</TE>

<HD>Venezuela Strike Extended as Protesters, Troops Clash</HD>
<DH>National guard fires tear gas and strafes demonstrators
outside a state oil company office with rubber pellets, reviving
labor action.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. Christian Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela</DL>
<LD>A nationwide strike against President Hugo Chavez will be prolonged
into a third day after violence erupted between government forces and
protesters Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   National guard troops launched tear gas and fired rubber pellets
at demonstrators during a rolling protest around the financial center
of the state oil company, PDVSA.</LD>
<LD>   The troops' action came as the strike seemed to be losing force,
and provided new energy to the protest. Opposition leaders called for
a massive march today to force Chavez to agree to a referendum on his
rule.</LD>
<TE>   "The repression against Venezuelans who were protesting
pacifically ... proves the unpopular, anti-democratic and repressive
nature of this regime," said Carlos Ortega, the head of the country's
largest union. "Today, more than ever, the strike goes on."</TE>
<TE>   But Chavez said the opposition was trying to provoke a
confrontation similar to the one in April when he was briefly
deposed.</TE>
<TE>   Venezuela's crisis pits Chavez against a coalition that includes
unions, businesses and the media, who accuse the controversial
president of leading the country into social chaos and financial
ruin.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no strike. The country is working," Chavez said,
speaking to reporters outside the presidential palace. "They have
decided to extend what they call a strike because they're looking for
destabilization.... They have begun to provoke acts of violence."</TE>
<TE>   The call to continue the protest raised fears that the strike
could begin to affect oil production, which in the past has proved a
catalyst for violence. Venezuela is the third-largest supplier of oil
to the United States, and petroleum accounts for more than half the
government revenue.</TE>
<TE>   A prolonged strike backed by petroleum workers in April led to the
coup that overthrew Chavez. He was returned to power 48 hours later
by loyal troops and supporters.</TE>
<TE>   There were conflicting reports Tuesday of how the oil industry had
been affected by the current strike. PDVSA executives said that as
many as 90% of white-collar workers and 65% of blue-collar workers
were on strike.</TE>
<TE>   But government officials said that contingency plans were allowing
normal functioning at most production sites.</TE>
<TE>   They said 89% of workers showed up for their jobs Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   On world markets, the price of Venezuelan oil rose slightly to
$26.03 a barrel Tuesday, though it fell in after-hours trading.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been no problems with gas or [oil] production," said
Maria Cristina Iglesia, the labor minister.</TE>
<TE>   Acknowledging a dip in support from the 80% participation it
claimed Monday, the opposition said 75% of the country heeded the
call to strike.</TE>
<TE>   On the streets Tuesday, traffic was still light, but there were
far more cars on the roads and shops open than on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   In the poorer, western and central parts of Caracas, the capital,
where Chavez draws much of his support, business seemed to have
returned almost to normal.</TE>
<TE>   Even in the heart of the opposition, shops opened.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see as there is any sense or logic in a strike," said
Juan Carlos Nino, 28, who runs a small restaurant a block from a
plaza in a wealthy eastern neighborhood that has been a center of
opposition protests.</TE>
<TE>   Oil is a source of national pride and wealth, and it played a key
role in Tuesday's protests.</TE>
<TE>   Early Tuesday morning, PDVSA's director of planning, Juan
Fernandez, called police to report that his home had been broken into
and that masked men had held a gun to his head and threatened to kill
him.</TE>
<TE>   Police made no arrests, but Fernandez made clear Tuesday that he
suspected that Chavez supporters could have been behind the break-in.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not saying who is guilty," he said in an interview. "But it's
very strange."</TE>
<TE>   The attack against Fernandez, as well as the government's
detention of two oil executives who allegedly had blocked workers
from going to their jobs, led to a gathering of protesters in front
of PDVSA's financial headquarters Tuesday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of troops in gas masks and camouflage suddenly appeared
marching in tight ranks under the warm sun and blue skies.</TE>
<TE>   Without warning, they fired tear gas into the crowd of nearly
1,000 people, who scattered in all directions.</TE>
<TE>   Soldiers in armored personnel carriers raced around the complex,
surrounding protesters and firing gas canisters. Some fleeing
protesters were beaten with flat metal swords that the troops used
for crowd control.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a provocation by the government," said Edgar Bond, a
PDVSA manager who was fleeing the protest, his eyes red from the gas.
"The government wants to seek a solution by force."</TE>
<TE>   Opposition protesters regrouped throughout the day at different
sites, blocking highways, waving flags and playing a cat-and-mouse
game with the national guard, who repeatedly pushed back the crowd
with tear gas.</TE>
<TE>   The action on the street Tuesday overshadowed a development that
promised to relieve tensions in the deeply divided country.</TE>
<TE>   The opposition is striking to force Chavez to hold a referendum on
his rule early next year.</TE>
<TE>   The National Electoral Council reviewed about 2 million signatures
collected by the opposition and approved the referendum by a 3-1
vote. But last week, its decision was overturned by the Supreme
Court, which ruled that the referendum had to be approved by at least
four of the council's five members.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, however, the council's president, Alfredo Avella,
announced that the council had arrived at the four votes necessary to
go ahead with the referendum. A council member who had previously
abstained cast the deciding vote.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez has said a referendum on his rule is not constitutionally
allowed until he has completed half of his term, in August next year.</TE>

<HD>Turks, Saudis Offer to Assist a War on Iraq</HD>
<DH>Opening the way for an attack on multiple fronts, the two
governments say they would permit a U.S.-led coalition to use air
bases.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Hendren</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ANKARA, Turkey</DL>
<LD>The Turkish government Tuesday offered the use of its bases in a
potential war against Iraq, as U.S. officials confirmed that Saudi
Arabia has also agreed to give its long-sought military support, twin
moves that could clear the way for a formidable attack on multiple
fronts.</LD>
<LD>   Turkish Foreign Minister Yasar Yakis said that Turkey would not
necessarily accept large numbers of U.S. ground troops but that the
United States would be allowed to use air bases to launch combat
flights into Iraq to the south.</LD>
<LD>   Yakis, whose Islamic-rooted Justice and Development Party came to
power last week, emphasized that the Turks want the United States to
leave "no stone unturned" in seeking to avert war, and Turkish
officials have made it known they would like a U.N. resolution
authorizing force before action is taken. Yakis nonetheless pledged
to provide military support.</LD>
<TE>   "If it comes to that, then of course we'll cooperate with the
United States," said Yakis, whose country could win much-needed U.S.
aid if it joined an anti-Iraq coalition. Asked to elaborate, he
added, "Cooperation is the opening of the airspace, first of all, and
utilization of facilities in Turkey."</TE>
<TE>   The news came as Saudi Arabia, another member of the coalition
that fought Iraq in the 1991 Persian Gulf War but has shown
reluctance to join a second war with Baghdad, agreed to allow a
U.S.-led coalition to use its airspace and the Prince Sultan Air Base
if the Bush administration leads a coalition against Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein, administration officials said on condition of
anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   The informal agreements, which came with strings, would
dramatically expand the United States' leverage in pressing Hussein
to eliminate any weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important that he see that he's surrounded by the
international community, not only in the political sense but in a
real practical military sense, and Turkey has a very important role
to play in that regard," said Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D.
Wolfowitz, who is leading a U.S. delegation on a visit to the new
Turkish ruling party.</TE>
<TE>   The developments came even as Iraqi officials allowed U.N. weapons
inspectors immediate access to a presidential palace Tuesday -- and
as the administration continued its anti-Hussein drumbeat, with
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld saying that if inspectors don't
find anything on their searches, that will mean merely that Iraq has
hidden its weapons very well.</TE>
<TE>   The Turkish bases in particular are key to the Pentagon's
strategy, defense officials and military experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "Turkey is obviously crucial. I don't think you could do anything
without Turkey," said Eliot Cohen, a military analyst at the Johns
Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington. "The
United States is less dependent on the Saudis, but [their support]
gives the United States a lot more room to maneuver."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. and British planes routinely fly from Incirlik in southern
Turkey to patrol the "no-fly" zone in the Kurdish region of northern
Iraq. War contingency plans for Iraq call for the U.S.-led coalition
to crush Hussein's military by striking from the north as well as
from U.S. bases to the south and, possibly, the west. Saudi Arabia is
a southern and western neighbor of Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "Two-front wars are hard to fight. Three-front wars are even
harder to fight," a senior U.S. official said. "If we have to, we can
come at him from any direction."</TE>
<TE>   The offer to use well-positioned military sites from a critical
ally across Iraq's northern border came during Wolfowitz's visit
here. The primary goal of the No. 2 Pentagon official's visit, part
of a new Bush administration campaign to rally allies for a possible
war, was to garner backing from the United States' most
Western-leaning Muslim ally in the region.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking to reporters between meetings in Ankara, the capital,
before the Turkish foreign minister's comments, Wolfowitz seemed
visibly buoyed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been an excellent day," he said. "I do feel that we have
obtained a common understanding."</TE>
<TE>   The agreement with Saudi Arabia was perhaps less expected.
Threatened by Iraq in the Gulf War, Saudi Arabia has remained
reluctant to agree to let coalition bombers attack its neighbor from
Saudi soil.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon had grown so doubtful of Saudi aid that it has tried
to replicate the Saudi air operations center on a smaller scale in
the neighboring Gulf state of Qatar. If the Saudis follow through,
Pentagon planners will have obtained the bulk of the cooperation they
had sought from an ally whose wariness stems largely from its
citizens' opposition to a war in Iraq. The Prince Sultan base is a
$1-billion facility built by the United States after the Gulf War and
used to direct airstrikes in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't need facilities for troops on the ground" in Saudi
Arabia, one senior U.S. official said.</TE>
<TE>   The acquiescence by the Saudi ruling family followed mounting
pressure from U.S. critics in Congress and elsewhere that began with
the disclosure that 15 of the 19 Sept. 11 hijackers were Saudi
nationals and that intensified with the recent disclosure that the
wife of the kingdom's U.S. ambassador may have, knowingly or
unwittingly, financially supported two of the hijackers.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're a Saudi, the prospect of being left out in the cold
with a really hostile United States is not something they want, and I
think at the end of the day they knew that," Cohen said.</TE>
<TE>   Turkey's pledge of support included significant caveats. Unlike
their U.S. counterparts, Turkish officials interpret the U.N.
resolution that demands Hussein declare and give up any chemical,
biological or nuclear weapons as requiring a second Security Council
vote before force could be used against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Omer Celik, a lawmaker and political advisor to Turkey's new
ruling party, said a second U.N. resolution "would be helpful" in
legitimizing a call for war, but neither he nor Yakis said he would
insist on one.</TE>
<TE>   Turkish leaders also voiced concern that strong opposition by
Turks to a war would make it difficult for the nation's leaders to
approve a massive foreign infantry presence on Turkish soil.</TE>
<TE>   "If we are talking of extensive presence of the American forces in
Turkey, we have difficulties in extending this [due] to the Turkish
public opinion," Yakis told a small group of reporters at his
residence in Ankara. "It may be difficult to see tens of thousands of
American forces being transported through the Turkish territory into
Iraq, or being stationed or deployed somewhere in Turkey and then
carrying out strikes inside Iraq. We have to know first of all the
extent to which this number will go up."</TE>
<TE>   The Turkish government later issued a clarification of the foreign
minister's statement that said he was discussing only
"possibilities," not promises.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. and Turkish officials denied reports in Turkish media that
Wolfowitz had asked Turkey to offer the use of half a dozen bases and
35,000 troops, presumably for border patrol and refugee management,
saying they had not yet decided on specific numbers. One senior U.S.
official said the Pentagon would not seek to involve Turkish troops
in direct combat.</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon strategists reason that a coalition that included Turkey
could pose a more formidable military force that would either
dissuade Hussein from challenging U.N. weapons inspections or speed a
U.S.-led force to victory. Turkey would benefit through regional
stability and increased trade in a post-Hussein Iraq, the thinking
goes.</TE>
<TE>   Wolfowitz and his delegation are discussing with the Turks ways to
ease the economic turmoil of a war in Iraq that could further depress
trade and tourism in a Turkish economy that has never fully recovered
from the 1991 war, a senior U.S. official said on condition of
anonymity. The aid is likely to come in part from the International
Monetary Fund but also to include direct assistance, the official
said.</TE>
<TE>   "The Turks want basically two things: no independent state for the
Iraqi Kurds in the north, and they want a ton of dough," a senior
Western diplomat said. "Billions and billions of dollars, and I think
we're going to pay it."</TE>
<TE>   The effort to secure Turkey's contribution in any war with Iraq
followed queries by the State Department to dozens of governments for
possible support, some of it outside the Persian Gulf, in order to
free up American resources, a second senior U.S. official said.</TE>

<HD>Sushi? 7-Eleven Hopes Consumers Will Bite</HD>
<DH>The chain rolls out fresh fare to compete for bigger slice
of on-the-go sales</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Melinda Fulmer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What flavor Slurpee goes with sushi? Or fettuccine Alfredo? Or
Szechwan beef?</LD>
<LD>   Those are the questions that customers at 7-Eleven could be faced
with as the nation's largest convenience store chain today begins
rolling out freshly made meals at its stores daily.</LD>
<LD>   The move, announced late Tuesday, is an aggressive attempt to
boost sales in the convenience store business by capturing the
growing number of "dashboard diners" who eat on the go.</LD>
<TE>   But removing the bad taste left by decades of rubbery hot dogs,
soggy burritos and aging shrink-wrapped sandwiches will be no easy
task.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the biggest things will be getting over the [image] in the
consumers' minds of what convenience store food is," said Des Hague,
vice president of fresh foods at Dallas-based 7-Eleven. But "we
expect fresh food to represent a pretty meaningful percentage of our
growth."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, if the concept catches on, it could turn up the heat on
supermarkets and fast-food chains, which have struggled to increase
their sales in recent years as a variety of retailers have begun
catering to consumers' growing demand for grab-and-go food.</TE>
<TE>   The lines between types of food retailing are blurring, said Karen
Brown, a spokeswoman for the Food Marketing Institute, which
represents grocers. "Everybody is in everybody else's business."</TE>
<TE>   Some, like San Diego-based burger giant Jack in the Box Inc., have
decided to join the convenience store fray, rather than risk losing
food sales. The company announced in September that it is opening up
Quick Stuff convenience stores and gas pumps next to some of its
restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   Supermarkets are adding refrigerated cases with prepared meals at
the front of stores so shoppers don't have to trek through the aisles
to find a meal.</TE>
<TE>   Entrees at 7-Eleven's 692 locations in Southern California will
range from fresh-made seafood salads to enchiladas and California
rolls, as well as meals such as lasagna, fettuccine and Szechwan beef
bowls that can be taken back to the office for quick heating and
eating.</TE>
<TE>   Prices for these items will range from $2.49 to $5.99 for some
higher-end salads.</TE>
<TE>   Keeping in mind the primary reason why customers shop at its
stores -- for the convenience -- 7-Eleven has been working with chefs
and manufacturers to make all of its food portable, ready to be
either stashed in a briefcase or put in a cup holder and nibbled on
while driving.</TE>
<TE>   "The lunch hour has shrunk from 60 minutes to 20-odd minutes,"
Hague said. "That's put consumers under tremendous stress. We are
trying to differentiate ourselves with high-quality portable foods."</TE>
<TE>   Increasingly, he said, 7-Eleven shoppers are demanding not only
more healthful fare but a wider variety beyond the more traditional
convenience store offerings of chips, frozen burritos and packaged
doughnuts.</TE>
<TE>   Today, sales of prepared food are still just a small part of the
$283-billion convenience store industry, falling well below
cigarettes and soda, according to the National Assn. of Convenience
Stores.</TE>
<TE>   But food sales are growing as time-strapped Americans look for
meals to eat on the go.</TE>
<TE>   A survey last December by Leo Shapiro &amp; Associates found that 65%
of shoppers who visited a convenience store bought food.</TE>
<TE>   As 7-Eleven expands its offerings at its 5,000 U.S. stores to
include more prepared entrees, appetizers and desserts in the next
five years, it expects fresh-food sales to quadruple. The company,
with $8 billion in annual revenue, does not break out food sales.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, Hague hopes that 7-Eleven will become known as a place
for takeout, as it is in Japan, where multiple food deliveries are
made to each store daily for each meal rush.</TE>
<TE>   "7-Eleven is redefining what a convenience store is," said Bill
Bishop, president of Willard Bishop Consulting in Barrington, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   The new offerings may not be restaurant quality. But they are a
big leap from the weeks-old vending machine-style sandwiches most
convenience stores dished up in the past.</TE>
<TE>   The new gourmet sandwiches will be made with such ingredients as
bourbon mustard sauce, and all will be preservative-free, made at one
of 13 local commissaries with a one- to two-day shelf life clearly
marked on the package.</TE>
<TE>   7-Eleven's new fresh-food system with its 22 distribution centers,
including one in Fullerton, and fleets of trucks has been "costly" to
set up, Hague said, declining to be more specific.</TE>
<TE>   But he said he expects the investment to more than pay for itself
because prepared foods, as opposed to packaged grocery items and
candy, are more lucrative.</TE>
<TE>   For the convenience store industry, prepared foods make up only
13% of sales, excluding gasoline purchases, but generate 25% of
profits.</TE>
<TE>   However, Bishop cautions it's a big leap from Slurpees to sushi.
It could be difficult for 7-Eleven to convince its consumers that
fresh convenience store food isn't an oxymoron.</TE>
<TE>   "Old habits die hard," he said. "They will have to work hard to
win a reputation in this area."</TE>

<HD>A Move to Muzzle E-Mail</HD>
<DH>A court may decide if a fired employee's mass messaging to
Intel workers is legal or electronic 'trespassing' on the firm's
system.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maura Dolan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ken Hamidi lost his job at Intel Corp. after a long fight over a
workers' compensation claim, but he did not go quietly.</LD>
<LD>   The engineer, 55, formed a support group for current and past
Intel workers. He then sent six waves of e-mails critical of the
company's labor practices to thousands of the firm's employees.</LD>
<LD>   Eventually the giant chip maker obtained a court order preventing
Hamidi from "trespassing" on the company's e-mail system. The ruling,
now on appeal before the California Supreme Court, has sparked a loud
outcry from dozens of civil libertarians but won plaudits from
industry.</LD>
<TE>   The outcome of the battle, pitting private property rights against
free speech, will help determine whether the Internet is a public
forum regardless of the ownership of the servers and computers that
make up the world wide system.</TE>
<TE>   The decision is expected to be a milestone in the still-emerging
field of cyber law. Because California has so much high-tech
industry, many of the rulings on Internet law have come in California
cases. It was one of the first states to regulate commercial e-mail,
or spam.</TE>
<TE>   Hamidi's case breaks new ground because his messages expressed
personal views, which the 1st Amendment generally prevents the
government from censoring.</TE>
<TE>   "We look at the Internet as a public resource, but that does not
have to be true," said Jennifer Granick, director of the Center for
Internet and Society at Stanford University.</TE>
<TE>   If the trespass ruling stands, "it means any Internet provider can
become a gatekeeper and keep out e-mail it doesn't like because of
its political content," said Ann Brick of the American Civil
Liberties Union Foundation of Northern California.</TE>
<TE>   But the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other business groups said in
a brief in the case that courts must assure "American businesses that
e-mail is a tool worth having in the workplace, rather than a time
bomb waiting to explode."</TE>
<TE>   No one has free-speech rights on private property that is not
generally open to the public, said University of Chicago law
professor Richard A. Epstein, who was selected by Intel to represent
other industries in the case.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no 1st Amendment right to go into the lobby of Intel to
speak to its employees, and if he can't use the lobby, why can he use
the equipment," which in this case is Intel's server, asked Epstein.</TE>
<TE>   Hamidi, who is married and has two daughters, describes his saga
with Intel with the kind of emotion a jilted husband might have
toward the wife who left him years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   He began working for Intel in Folsom, Calif., in 1986. He said he
loved his job, and believed he would spend the rest of his career
with Intel.</TE>
<TE>   Hamidi filed for workers' compensation in 1992 after suffering a
back injury in an automobile accident while returning from a
conference.</TE>
<TE>   He began gulping down Vicodin for pain, couldn't sleep and was
depressed, he said. He eventually asked for workers' compensation for
his depression too, contending it stemmed from his chronic back pain.
Intel finally gave him a three-month medical leave, he said, but
stopped paying for his medical treatments the day the leave started.</TE>
<TE>   "They picked on the wrong guy," Hamidi said over lunch in
Sacramento, where he works as a compliance representative for a state
agency. "They could not bring me to my knees."</TE>
<TE>   During his protracted struggle, Hamidi described having to wait
for months and to drive long distances to see doctors specified by
Intel. The firm videotaped him changing a tire after it had been
slashed and used the videotape against him, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Intel fired Hamidi in 1995 for failing to return to work after a
medical leave. A state workers' compensation appeals board eventually
ruled against Hamidi on his psychiatric claim.</TE>
<TE>   The appeals board found that his depression did not stem from his
back injury and that he had exaggerated his problems to his doctors.</TE>
<TE>   During his battle with Intel, Hamidi said, he entered a mental
hospital twice and was placed under a suicide watch.</TE>
<TE>   Hamidi credits the formation of FACE-Intel, a support group and
Web site, with turning his life around. He said he has saved jobs at
Intel by counseling employees not to file for workers' compensation
and has prevented suicides. Focusing on others' problems distracted
him from his own and gave him a voice, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Annual review time is very close," warned one of six e-mails
Hamidi sent over a two-year period. "Unfortunately many of you ...
will be terminated.... We can help."</TE>
<TE>   In another e-mail to Intel, Hamidi wrote: "If you are on
redeployment, it is highly likely that you are targeted for
termination and there will not be any jobs available for you....
NEVER, EVER believe there is something wrong with you. Based on
testimonies of numerous Intel victims, there is life after Intel that
is rewarding."</TE>
<TE>   When Intel took Hamidi to Sacramento County Superior Court in 1998
to stop his e-mails, the out-of-work engineer could not afford a
lawyer and initially represented himself.</TE>
<TE>   His six e-mails had been sent in bunches that ranged from 8,000 to
35,000 at a time, meaning that Intel employees received an average of
one e-mail from Hamidi every four months.</TE>
<TE>   His case attracted the attention of legal scholars only after a
Court of Appeal in Sacramento upheld the injunction last December,
ruling 2 to 1 that he was committing "trespass to chattels."</TE>
<TE>   Chattel is private property other than real estate, and for
decades courts have held that that someone can be liable for such a
wrong only if the property was damaged or temporarily taken away from
the owner.</TE>
<TE>   A simple analogy is this: "If I kicked your dog, it would not be
actionable unless the dog was hurt," said UC Berkeley law professor
Stephen Barnett, who teaches tort law.</TE>
<TE>   Intel's computer system was not damaged, nor was there even any
evidence that Hamidi's messages slowed the company's e-mail service.</TE>
<TE>   But the company said Hamidi's e-mail had distracted employees,
reduced morale, forced managers to spend time reassuring workers that
their jobs were safe and required technical employees to work on
efforts to block future e-mail from Hamidi.</TE>
<TE>   The state Supreme Court has agreed to hear the case, which means
it will be the first state high court to rule on the legal theory of
"trespass to chattels" as applied to the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the case's potential impact, many in the legal
community have rushed to embrace Hamidi's case. The ACLU, a labor
group, 41 law professors and other civil libertarian and Internet
activist groups agreed to weigh in on Hamidi's behalf. The state high
court has yet to schedule arguments in the case, Intel vs. Hamidi.</TE>
<TE>   William M. McSwain, who is representing Hamidi, wrote a law review
article about the case while he was a student at Harvard Law School.
McSwain has arranged for the international corporate law firm where
he now works in Philadelphia to represent Hamidi at no charge.</TE>
<TE>   No court would have issued an injunction based on trespass if
Hamidi had sent his messages through the U.S. Postal Service, and
e-mail should not be any different, McSwain maintains.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not talking about commercial advertising here," said
McSwain. "This is a gentleman trying to disseminate a message of
important public concern to people who want to hear it."</TE>
<TE>   The ruling against Hamidi, if allowed to stand, could potentially
turn millions of Americans who use the Internet into law breakers,
McSwain said.</TE>
<TE>   "You cannot have a situation where anything, even the movement of
electrons, constitutes trespass," he said. "The court needs to put a
stop to this madness."</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the early rulings in the Intel case say courts should
insist that companies deal with the Hamidis of the world by bringing
nuisance or defamation cases against them. Under those legal
theories, Hamidi probably would have fared better, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   The ACLU has asked the court to apply the trespass doctrine only
in cases in which there is physical damage or impairment to the
computers or the company server. If a barrage of e-mail caused
computers to crash or slow down, the company would have a claim
against the sender, they say.</TE>
<TE>   But if the content of the message is at issue, free speech
guarantees protect it, the ACLU's Brick wrote. In Hamidi's case, the
content was the issue because Intel would not have objected if the
messages had been laudatory, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Intel declined to allow its lawyer in the case to be interviewed.</TE>
<TE>   But Epstein, who represents industry groups aligned with Intel,
said in a brief to the state high court that the uproar over the
ruling stems from the fact that people tend to "wax mystical" when it
comes to the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the Internet is a communications tool, not a
transformative social revolution," Epstein said</TE>
<TE>   "Intel runs its e-mail system beside -- not on -- the Internet
highway," he argued in the brief. "It is no more a part of the public
infrastructure of the Internet than an office building or factory
that is not open to the public but which happens to operate alongside
the public highways."</TE>
<TE>   The United States Chamber of Commerce contends that the case is
about a vengeful former employee trying to destroy a corporation that
fired him for incompetence.</TE>
<TE>   "If this court permits Hamidi's conduct to continue unchecked in
the absence of criminal and civil penalties, American businesses may
choose to curb technological development and e-mail privileges in the
workplace," wrote Mark Theodore, who is representing the U.S. and
California chambers in the case.</TE>
<TE>   In its brief, Intel said Hamidi evaded Intel security measures put
in place to block his mail.</TE>
<TE>   "To avoid detection and the various measures Intel might take to
block his messages," the brief said, "Hamidi sent e-mails in the dead
of night and from different computers."</TE>
<TE>   Hamidi smiled when asked about this. He said he sent the e-mails
late at night because computers at the time were slower than they are
now, and he had to send his bulk messages when there was less
Internet traffic.</TE>
<TE>   He evaded Intel's attempted blocks by switching servers and adding
dashes or periods to his name and the name of his organization, he
said. He obtained the e-mail addresses of Intel employees from
someone inside Intel who sent him the directory anonymously, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Chuck Mulloy, an Intel spokesman, described Intel as a
"meritocracy," and "a fair place to work," headquartered in Santa
Clara with 80,000 employees worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   He said Intel has not tried to stop Hamidi from expressing his
views on his own Web site, in leaflets or in media interviews. "But
when he sends e-mail in the volume he does, in our view he is
trespassing on our property."</TE>
<TE>   Hamidi's messages contained a section in which recipients could
ask to be removed from Hamidi's list. He said he honored about 450
such requests.</TE>
<TE>   When the court barred him from sending e-mails to Intel employees,
Hamidi rented a horse and buggy and delivered leaflets to Intel's
headquarters. Another time he went to Intel on horseback.</TE>
<TE>   Hamidi runs his support group out of his home office in a
working-class neighborhood north of Sacramento. He has two computers,
an array of office equipment and a book of press clippings.</TE>
<TE>   "Did you know I was 'Disgruntled Employee of the Year' in 1997?"
he asked with a grin. An Internet magazine gave him the title.</TE>
<TE>   Hamidi continues to counsel Intel workers who contact his Web
site, www.FaceIntel.com, and he is helping to facilitate three
possible class-action lawsuits against the chip maker. He receives
e-mail on his site from people around the world, and spends hours
each evening at his computers.</TE>
<TE>   "They cannot force me into submission," Hamidi said. "If I have
been wronged, I will stand up and say, 'You have wronged me.' That is
my constitutional right."</TE>

<HD>City Declares War on Gangs</HD>
<DH>Hahn and Bratton say they'll go after leaders and members
with the same aggressive tactics that worked against the Mafia on the
East Coast.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Megan Garvey and Richard Winton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mayor James K. Hahn and Los Angeles Police Chief William J. Bratton
declared an all-out assault on the city's street gangs Tuesday,
saying they will use the same tactics that crippled the Mafia to
pursue gang leaders and members.</LD>
<LD>   "There is nothing more insidious than these gangs," said Bratton.
"They are worse than the Mafia. Show me a year in New York where the
Mafia indiscriminately killed 300 people. You can't."</LD>
<LD>   The new anti-gang initiatives are the latest in a long line of law
enforcement efforts to curtail gang activity in a metropolitan area
where authorities say there are more than 100,000 gang members and
associates and at least 200 active gangs. Over the years, the
initiatives have met with limited success in a community where some
gangs date back five generations, and some experts predicted Tuesday
that the current effort may fare no better.</LD>
<TE>   The mayor and chief said the threat posed by gangs requires
dramatic federal intervention and aggressive prosecution of gang
members under federal racketeering statutes.</TE>
<TE>   Details of the new anti-gang effort came at a news conference at
the 77th Street Community Police Station in South Los Angeles, where
nearly half of the city's 614 homicides so far this year have taken
place.</TE>
<TE>   Police officials said Tuesday that they already have redeployed
the department's 300 gang suppression officers to eight divisions --
77th, Newton, Southeast, Southwest, Hollenbeck, Foothill, Wilshire
and Harbor -- where gang activity has spurred a double-digit increase
in the city's murder rate this year.</TE>
<TE>   In the past three weeks alone, more than 20 people have been
gunned down in South Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Bratton will swear in Capt. Michael Hillmann as the city's
gang czar. Hillmann, who will take the rank of deputy chief, is
charged with coordinating anti-gang efforts citywide, a newly created
post. In addition, Cmdr. Earl C. Paysinger is scheduled to be sworn
in as deputy chief for the South Bureau.</TE>
<TE>   The new assignments come as the LAPD launches joint operations
with state and county agencies to track down parole and probation
violators, many of them gang members, living in the city's most
violent neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to target fugitives and gun and narcotics violators who
prey on our neighborhoods," said Hahn, who while serving as city
attorney used injunctions to stop gang members from congregating.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton on Tuesday called gang activity "homeland terrorism."
Warning that the city's street gangs are "the head that needs to be
cut off" to stem gang activity elsewhere in the country, Bratton said
he plans to head to Washington with Hahn shortly after the first of
the year to ask for help.</TE>
<TE>   "They need to get preoccupied with the internal war on terrorism
as well," Bratton said.</TE>
<TE>   His second-in-command, Assistant Chief Jim McDonnell, said: "We're
going to use the full force of RICO (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act) and the IRS to bring down these gang members.
That's what got Al Capone."</TE>
<TE>   Flanked by family members of Clive Jackson Jr., 14, a promising
basketball player with no gang affiliations who was shot dead two
weeks ago on Western Avenue, the mayor and chief said residents
should not have to live in fear.</TE>
<TE>   "Let the death of Clive Jackson be a call to action," Hahn said as
tears ran down the faces of Jackson's parents. "We cannot and will
not let gang members control these streets."</TE>
<TE>   Successfully attacking gangs, however, has proved difficult over
the years.</TE>
<TE>   Then-Chief Daryl F. Gates instituted massive police sweeps in 1988
and 1989, flooding the streets of South Los Angeles with 200 to 300
additional officers on random nights to make hundreds of arrests on
minor and major violations. The program, named "Operation Hammer,"
alienated large segments of the community while doing little to
reduce crime.</TE>
<TE>   Gates said his intention was clear-cut: "to make life miserable
for gang members."</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, under Chief Willie L. Williams, the LAPD launched the
largest street gang crackdown in its history in a joint operation
with the FBI. But only one of the 63 people arrested by the
800-member team was charged with a violent felony.</TE>
<TE>   Another task force, formed in the 1990s to go after the 18th
Street gang's clandestine network of leaders, also fell far short of
its goals. Recent FBI estimates place membership in the 18th Street
gang at about 15,000.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the number of homicides in Los Angeles dropped dramatically
in the late 1990s and remains far lower this year than the all-time
high of 1,092 in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Chief McDonnell acknowledged Tuesday that the
dismantling of the LAPD's specialized gang unit known as CRASH may
have contributed to spikes in street violence. The unit was
eliminated in March 2000 in the wake of the Rampart Division scandal.</TE>
<TE>   But McDonnell said the department's new initiative won't be a
return to the past. This time, he said, the community and police must
work together to erase gangs. "We don't want to come out like in the
'80s with Operation Hammer," he said. "We are planning a holistic,
collaborative approach to the problem."</TE>
<TE>   Experts say the task will be difficult.</TE>
<TE>   Howard Abadinsky, a criminologist who has written extensively on
organized crime, said the nature and magnitude of Los Angeles street
gangs are far different from those of the Mafia.</TE>
<TE>   Abadinsky said a three-prong effort -- run by the FBI and not the
NYPD -- has led to a reduction in the influence of New York's five
big crime families, which altogether are estimated to have about
1,000 members.</TE>
<TE>   "You need to stop recruitment; the problem you've got in L.A. is
you have an unlimited supply of applicants," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to have people undercover or you have to turn someone,"
Abadinsky added. "You have to get electronic surveillance based on
what your snitches tell you and have to use intensive, intensive
activity over time to build a case."</TE>
<TE>   Thom Mrozek, spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Los
Angeles, said authorities have grappled for years with how best to go
after street gangs.</TE>
<TE>   "We've prosecuted gang members using federal weapons laws," he
said, adding that some cases are ongoing. "In other cases we've
targeted gangs who engaged in drug trafficking."</TE>
<TE>   Mrozek said RICO laws were used to obtain 18 convictions against
the Columbia Lil' Cycos -- a clique of the 18th Street gang --
earlier this year. Prosecutors described the gang as patterning
itself after East Coast Mafia families, spending money on suburban
houses, a juice parlor and a used car lot.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton said he will meet with U.S. Atty. Debra Yang next week.</TE>
<TE>   Those who work on the front lines to stem gang activity say the
city needs to invest in gang prevention as much as enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   "If there is a year with lot of fires, the Fire Department gets
money to hire more firefighters. In much the same way, the city needs
to spend more money on gangs intervention," said Kevin Fletcher of
L.A. Bridges gang intervention program.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, a relative of Clive Jackson read from a letter the
youth had written to UCLA officials asking for advice shortly before
he was shot to death.</TE>
<TE>   "I would like to know how to get into college so that I can get
ready," the 14-year-old wrote. "I want to know how much are the books
there so I can save up. I don't want my mom to pay for everything....
I thank you for your time and I hope to make it there."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said too many lives such as Jackson's had been cut short.</TE>
<TE>   "Statistics cloud us from seeing the real pain," he said. "His
hopes and dreams will never be realized."</TE>

<HD>Hospital Rebuilding Project OKd</HD>
<DH>A new $820-million County-USC complex is called vital to
strained health care system.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daren Briscoe</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday approved an
$820-million project to rebuild County-USC Medical Center, the aging,
earthquake-damaged heart of the county's sprawling public health
system.</LD>
<LD>   The decision to award what officials say is the largest
construction contract in county history comes at an awkward moment as
the county appeals to the state and federal governments for help in
closing a health department budget deficit of several hundred million
dollars.</LD>
<LD>   Yet county officials said the huge expenditure is a necessary part
of reorganizing the system to put a greater emphasis on outpatient
services. And there is widespread agreement among doctors, advocates
for patients and county officials that the time has come to replace
the aging hospital complex.</LD>
<TE>   One of the county's most recognizable landmarks -- the complex's
20-story General Hospital was for years shown during the credits of
the soap opera "General Hospital" -- the hospital was badly damaged
in the 1994 Northridge earthquake. Some sections are badly out of
date. Because there are no fire sprinklers in the General Hospital
and the Women's and Children's Hospital, for example, the county pays
for 24-hour fire patrols in the buildings.</TE>
<TE>   How best to replace the hospital was at the heart of a years-long
and frequently bitter dispute over the appropriate size of a
replacement. The fight pitted Supervisor Gloria Molina, who argued
for a larger, 750-bed replacement hospital, against the other four
members of the board.</TE>
<TE>   Though the supervisors resolved those differences two years ago,
Tuesday's final approval of the 600-bed, 1.5-million-square-foot
project marks the first significant step toward actual construction.</TE>
<TE>   Groundbreaking for the project is scheduled for this spring, with
completion expected in 2007.</TE>
<TE>   The new facility, which will be built on land adjacent to the
existing one, will consist of four buildings, including a seven-story
outpatient building, an eight-story inpatient tower, a five-story
diagnostic and treatment building and a central plant. How the
existing building will eventually be used remains unclear.</TE>
<TE>   Although the dispute over the size of the new hospital is over,
arguments about the potential cost continue.</TE>
<TE>   The estimated price tag for the replacement hospital has already
increased more than $2.5 million over original projections, and the
construction contract was awarded to the sole bidder on the project,
McCarthy, Clark, Hunt, a joint venture.</TE>
<TE>   "This could balloon into the billion figures easily," said
Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky.</TE>
<TE>   Without adequate county controls over unauthorized construction
expenditures, Yaroslavsky said, the hospital replacement project
"would resemble what we went through with the MTA."</TE>
<TE>   During the late 1990s, audits of the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority's construction projects found skyrocketing design and
engineering costs. One 1997 audit found that cost overruns on the
13.6-mile rail line from Union Station to Pasadena nearly doubled the
cost from a budgeted $47 million to an estimated $93.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   First opened as a two-story brick building in 1878, County-USC has
long functioned as the core of the county health system and as its
most visible symbol.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the hospital provided more than 785,000 emergency and
outpatient visits, and County-USC treats about 35% of HIV/AIDS
patients in the county.</TE>
<TE>   County-USC also enjoys a high political profile. As a primary
teaching site for generations of medical students and residents, the
hospital occupies a sentimental place in the hearts of thousands of
influential doctors who trained there. Unionized health-care workers
often choose the site as a backdrop for walkouts or strikes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always been the cornerstone of the system," said Dr.
Jonathan Fielding, director of public health for the county
Department of Health Services.</TE>
<TE>   But for all of its status and stature, the physical condition of
the venerable institution has been in a state of accelerating decline
for years.</TE>
<TE>   After the Northridge quake and an extended squabble with the
Federal Emergency Management Agency over the scope of the damage, the
county eventually received more than $470 million in federal and
state disaster aid to rebuild County-USC. Then the fight over the
size of the replacement began.</TE>
<TE>   County officials ultimately agreed on a 600-bed facility, 145
fewer beds than the hospital is budgeted to staff and operate.</TE>
<TE>   While she welcomes the new building, Molina, who represents the
Eastside area in which the hospital is located, continues to believe
that the replacement hospital is too small, said Miguel Santana, a
spokesman. Nonetheless, building the replacement is "a project that's
essential to maintaining the system as a whole, given that it's the
hub of the system," Santana said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to move forward in terms of making the whole system more
efficient."</TE>
<TE>   The county will fund about $331 million of the cost by borrowing
money, taking advantage of current low interest rates.</TE>
<TE>   Officials from the Department of Public Works, which will oversee
the project, said it should be completed within its budget.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't understand going over budget," said Tom Remillard,
assistant director for the Department of Public Works. "There's no
more money."</TE>
<TE>   County rules require that any expenditures of more than $150,000
not detailed in the contract be approved by the Board of Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   But Yaroslavsky said the county is at a disadvantage in a project
of this size.</TE>
<TE>   "Contractors at this level know how to play this game better than
anybody around here does," he said. "We just pay for it."</TE>

<HD>Boston Clerical Abuse Scandal Grows</HD>
<DH>Newly released church documents reveal cases ranging from
molestation of girls to homosexual rape to drug use by priests.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Mehren and Josh Getlin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Roman Catholic Church officials here overlooked for decades a range
of abuses that included the molestation of girls preparing to become
nuns, homosexual rape and drug use by priests with parish youth,
according to confidential archdiocesan documents made public Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The records show that as recently as last year, bishops and
archbishops in Boston consistently ignored parishioners' complaints
while protecting priests and striving to minimize financial damage.</LD>
<LD>   Many examples of clerical sexual abuse have become public since
the nationwide scandal erupted in Boston in January. But the mountain
of memorandums, letters and court filings released Tuesday casts
light on offenses and church practices not previously reported,
sparking new outrage among many victims and their advocates.</LD>
<TE>   "This material is qualitatively different than anything we have
seen until now," said David Clohessy, national chair of SNAP, the
Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests.</TE>
<TE>   "It debunks a whole range of excuses that church officials have
used: that the allegations were all ancient, that the abuse only
concerned boys and that it involved just a handful of priests," said
Clohessy, who flew in from St. Louis to review the documents. "What
we see is that this is clearly a deep and systemic problem."</TE>
<TE>   Donna M. Morrissey, spokeswoman for the archdiocese here, did not
return a call Tuesday seeking comment on the new material.</TE>
<TE>   The disclosures come amid speculation that the Boston archdiocese
may file for bankruptcy protection because so many abuse cases are
pending against it. The revelations were mandated by court order as
part of a series of civil suits brought by sexual-abuse victims and
their families.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the archdiocese at first resisted the edict from
Superior Court Judge Constance Sweeney, but in an eleventh-hour
reversal, they complied by presenting plaintiffs' lawyers with 11,000
pages of partially redacted documents -- many written in the careful
Catholic school cursive of top-ranking prelates.</TE>
<TE>   In making public about 2,000 pages Tuesday, plaintiffs' lawyer
Robert Sherman said reams of additional documents would be released
in coming weeks. These records were filed in court here Tuesday in
preparation for future litigation.</TE>
<TE>   The records produced Tuesday focused on several priests whose
cases until now had not come to light. Among them was Father Robert
Meffan, "a name I had never heard of," said plaintiffs' attorney
Roderick MacLeish Jr., who has represented clerical abuse victims for
more than a decade.</TE>
<TE>   Following complaints about Meffan, the late Cardinal Humberto
Medeiros recommended as early as 1977 that the priest seek help from
"some professional person." Instead, he moved into a trailer and set
up shop as a counselor. By 1985, he was back in service as a parish
priest. The following year, a handwritten document from Bishop Robert
Banks recorded allegations that Meffan was engaged in sexual acts
with girls as young as 15 who were preparing to become nuns.</TE>
<TE>   A 1993 confidential report filed in the archdiocese recounted how
Meffan would allegedly "attract adolescent girls, get them to enter
religious orders and then visit them in various novitiates. He would
link spiritual stages with sexual acts, 'what one has to do in order
to progress,' and would perform the acts," the report stated.</TE>
<TE>   The teenage girls -- at least three of whom went on to become nuns
-- often met with Meffan in his rectory office, a subsequent report
continued. An archdiocesan memo from 1993 alleged that Meffan taught
the girls to be "brides of Christ." When questioned by church
officials, Meffan denied any knowledge of such practices, the
"personal and confidential" memo indicated.</TE>
<TE>   The documents contain no reference to legal action involving
Meffan, nor do the records express concern for the girls or their
families.</TE>
<TE>   When he was nearly 70, Meffan left his priestly duties. In a "Dear
Father Robert" letter dated July 10, 1996, Cardinal Bernard Law
praised Meffan for "the depth of your faith and the courage of your
heart." There was no answer Tuesday night at a telephone number
listed for Meffan in southeastern Massachusetts.</TE>
<TE>   Another priest whose story was not well known until Tuesday was
Father Richard Buntel. In 1981, Bishop Thomas V. Daily received a
letter from the auxiliary bishop of Boston voicing concern about
Buntel's alcoholism and repeated use of drugs. The letter informed
Daily, now bishop of Brooklyn, N.Y., that Buntel apparently was
distributing drugs to young people.</TE>
<TE>   "It is said that at his previous parish he was called 'pothead' by
some in the parish -- probably by young people," Father John M.
D'Arcy wrote. "I am told that the drug involved was cocaine."</TE>
<TE>   D'Arcy's letter concluded: "It is my conviction, as I believe it
is yours as well, that we who are in the positions of responsibility
have the obligation to try to prevent scandal in those cases where it
seems almost definite that it will occur."</TE>
<TE>   A 1994 memo about Buntel said the priest showed pornography
magazines to young visitors in his rectory bedroom, where -- although
the door was shut -- the smell of marijuana seeped out. The memo
reported that Buntel had oral sex with males ages 15 to 21, who saw
bags of cocaine and piles of money in his room.</TE>
<TE>   Most galling of all, said Joe Gallagher, co-founder of an advocacy
group here called the Coalition of Catholics and Survivors, "This
person was never reported to the authorities."</TE>
<TE>   MacLeish, the attorney, said he had "no idea" where Buntel is now.</TE>
<TE>   For Father Robert Burns, the trail of abuse began in Youngstown,
Ohio, where he was a priest from 1975 to 1981. Church officials there
determined that he had sexually abused young boys, and, in 1981, they
sent him to a counseling program for pedophiles in Massachusetts.
Soon, Burns was applying for a temporary position in the Boston
archdiocese.</TE>
<TE>   James W. Malone, then-bishop of the Youngstown diocese, alerted
Boston officials to Burns' sexual history. He urged them not to
assign him to church work where he might have contact with young
boys.</TE>
<TE>   In reply, Father Gilbert S. Phinn, director of personnel for the
Boston archdiocese, promised that Burns' placement would be handled
with "sensitivity and concern." Yet Burns was eventually placed in
two parishes, first in Jamaica Plain, Mass., and then in Charlestown,
Mass., where he regularly came into contact with minors. Boston
archdiocesan authorities did not warn the local churches of his
record, even though they had written "problem: little children" in a
1982 internal memo about Burns.</TE>
<TE>   It took nine years for a flurry of accusations to surface that
Burns had sexually molested a series of boys. In one case, attorney
Laurence E. Hardoon said his 14-year-old client was "anally raped" by
the priest in the rectory of a Boston church. As the allegations
grew, Burns was removed from his post. Church leaders urged him to
once again undergo counseling for pedophilia.</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, Cardinal Bernard Law officially terminated Burns'
assignment in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   "Life is never just one moment or one event and it would be
unrealistic to have too narrow a focus. It would have been better
were things to have ended differently, but such was not the case,"
Law wrote to Burns. "Nevertheless I still feel that it is important
to express my gratitude to you for the care you have given to the
people of the Archdiocese of Boston "</TE>
<TE>   Burns pleaded guilty in 1996 to sexually molesting two boys under
the age of 13 in New Hampshire. He was sentenced to two consecutive
four- to eight-year terms.</TE>
<TE>   He was formally stripped of his clerical duties three years later
by order of the Vatican. In a letter to Rome, Law said the
archdiocese had "mistakenly accepted [Burns'] word of contrition as a
pledge against further acts of sexual molestation of children.
Despite treatment for this behavior, Father Burns continued to commit
these egregious acts."</TE>
<TE>   Another priest whose records were made public Tuesday was accused
in 1975 of pushing his 58-year-old housekeeper down the stairs of his
residence and pulling out large clumps of her hair. In response,
then-Bishop Daily urged that Father Thomas B. Forry be terminated.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he was reassigned to another parish south of Boston. In
1984, archdiocesan officials received a letter from a woman claiming
an 11-year sexual relationship with Forry. Some years later, the
woman contacted the archdiocese to allege that Forry had sexually
abused her son.</TE>
<TE>   Forry went on to serve as a chaplain in the Army and at a prison.
"I am confident that you will render fine priestly service to those
with whom you come in contact," Law wrote to Forry in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Forry's assignment to the Emergency Response Team of the Boston
Archdiocese was ended in February of this year. There was no
indication of any legal action taken against him. There was no answer
at Forry's residence Tuesday night in South Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Even those who have spent nearly a year surrounded by the scandal
said they were stunned by the array of offenses detailed in the new
documents. Almost as appalling, said Gallagher, of the Coalition of
Catholics and Survivors, was the absence of compassion for victims on
the part of church leaders.</TE>
<TE>   "At this point in time, we have not seen a single reference to the
issue of pastoral care for the victims," Gallagher said.</TE>
<TE>   Coming out of Boston, where the clerical abuse scandal first
unraveled, the disclosures carry special weight, Clohessy said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no other archdiocese in the country where the extent of
the problem has been so clearly identified," he said. "But having
said that, I am not saying Boston is the worst."</TE>
<TE>   Phil de Albuquerque, a kitchen designer who has protested outside
Law's cathedral for nearly a year, said the new material filled him
with sadness. "I think that after today, every Catholic is a victim,"
he said. "A victim of deceit and betrayal."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Actions by the Archdiocese:</TE>
<TE>   The documents released Tuesday by the Boston Roman Catholic
archdiocese shed light on how church officials responded to</TE>
<TE>   individual cases, including these:</TE>
<TE>   Reverend's advice: In 1991, as accusations about Father Robert
Burns began to surface, Father John B. McCormack, secretary for
ministerial personnel with the archdiocese, met with the family of
one alleged victim and recounts in a memo his advice to the family:
"I also felt that what would be helpful is if their son could learn
to be forgiving. But this will come later. I added that I didn't
think compensation would be helpful to their son. It is not what he
needs."</TE>
<TE>   Seeking restitution: When an attorney representing another alleged
victim asked the archdiocese to pay for hospitalization of the boy,
who had become a drug addict as a result of the abuse, Sister Rita V.
McCarthy advised Cardinal Bernard Law in a 1997 memo: "We do not pay
for inpatient assistance. This would set a precedent."</TE>
<TE>   The boy's attorney, Timothy P. O'Connell, fired back in a letter:
"Should not the victim of a pedophile be entitled to the same care as
the pedophile? Father Burns was treated by a clinical psychologist at
St. Luke's Institute in the fall of 1991. He was also treated at the
House of Affirmation in 1981. [My client] deserves the same
treatment."</TE>
<TE>   Offering support: In a 1993 letter to a priest at the
Jamaica Plain, Mass., rectory where Burns was alleged to have molested
several boys, McCormack counseled a colleague to offer pastoral
support to a parent of one victim: "However, at the same time, never
admit to her that you know anything about a legal process. This is
supposed to be absolutely confidential. My reason for telling you
this was to alert you to this."</TE>
<TE>   'No good reason': When a 22-year-old man approached Father Brian
M. Flatley in 1996, saying he had been molested by Burns as a boy at
St. Thomas Aquinas rectory in Charlestown, Mass., Flatley said church
officials believed Burns had been previously cured: "The young man
asked if we told anyone at St. Thomas about Father Burns' past. I
said no, that Father Thomas knew nothing. He asked how we could have
done that. I told him there is no good reason."</TE>
<TE>   Condolences: After 1991 accusations that he had sexually abused
boys, Burns left his post at St. Thomas Aquinas. McCormack wrote to
express condolences over the passing of Burns' elderly aunt and
added: "In all of this, God has blessed you with a great capacity of
insight and understanding."</TE>
<TE>   A mother's response: In a 1999 letter to O'Connell, the mother of
another alleged victim said her son had suppressed the story about
Burns for years: "I questioned him, why didn't he come to his father
and me? If he did, you can rest assured that one of us would be in
jail now. We would have killed the bastard that violated a child of
ours."</TE>

<HD>Mississippi Curbs Big Jury Awards</HD>
<DH>Caps on liability verdicts are seen as pro-business.
Critics say companies will be less accountable.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ken Ellingwood</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JACKSON, Miss.</DL>
<LD>It is one of the poorest states in the nation, but in recent years
Mississippi has developed a reputation for granting exorbitant awards
to plaintiffs who sued in its courts.</LD>
<LD>   The state is now moving to curb those lawsuits through a sweeping
set of legal reforms signed into law Tuesday by Gov. Ronnie Musgrove
and hailed by business leaders as a big step in reversing depictions
of Mississippi as a breeding ground for frivolous lawsuits.</LD>
<LD>   The state becomes the latest of several dozen to clamp down on
huge damage verdicts in recent years, and the new law is expected to
prompt similar legislation elsewhere.</LD>
<TE>   Critics said the awards had spiraled out of control in Mississippi
because the state's jurors -- many of them poor -- tend to favor
consumers in claims against big companies.</TE>
<TE>   Trial lawyers, who oppose the reforms, said the change would put
the public at greater risk because big businesses would be less
accountable.</TE>
<TE>   The measure, which caps punitive damages in product liability
cases and establishes other restrictions, won approval in the state
Legislature last week following an 83-day special session that was
devoted to overhauling the state's civil justice system.</TE>
<TE>   The tort reform package came after an intensive campaign by
business groups portraying Mississippi as the capital of "jackpot
justice" for having doled out huge awards in lawsuits against
chemical and pharmaceutical companies, among others.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most vociferous critics was the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, which took out full-page advertisements in newspapers
statewide calling for reforms in Mississippi's system. A poll of
company lawyers that was commissioned by the chamber rated
Mississippi's liability system the most hostile in the country toward
businesses that are sued.</TE>
<TE>   In October, Musgrove signed a separate measure setting limits on
damages in medical malpractice cases. It was concern over doctors and
insurers leaving the state to escape high malpractice costs that led
to the effort to reform the rest of the civil justice system.</TE>
<TE>   "What we have signed is something that will give a fair, level
playing field to our system in Mississippi," Musgrove said during a
bill-signing ceremony Tuesday in the rotunda of the state Capitol. "A
message has been sent to the rest of the world about doing business
in Mississippi. This is a good place to do business."</TE>
<TE>   In approving the changes, Mississippi joins 45 states that have
enacted some form of tort reform since the mid-1980s, according to
the American Tort Reform Assn., which backs changes in the way
liability cases are handled. Pointing to a patchwork of rules at the
state level, reform advocates are pushing for federal laws over how
civil liability lawsuits are handled.</TE>
<TE>   The changes in Mississippi are likely to spur remaining states to
act, say tort reform supporters. Among states where the issue is
expected to come up are Ohio and Nevada.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no doubt that this legislation in Mississippi sends a
signal to the other states that when elected officials hear both
sides of the issue, tort reform gets passed. We expect that other
states will enact tort reform legislation in coming months," said
Mike Hotra, spokesman for the tort reform association.</TE>
<TE>   Tort reform was the year's hottest political issue in Mississippi,
and the state served as the battlefield in a high-profile proxy war
between business interests and trial attorneys. Besides the debate
here in the capital, the two sides also poured hundreds of thousands
of dollars into a race for a seat on the state's Supreme Court.
Incumbent Chuck McRae, portrayed by detractors as too sympathetic to
plaintiffs, lost after a campaign that attracted massive
contributions from outside the state.</TE>
<TE>   Business groups lauded the civil justice reform package as a step
toward creating a fairer system for handling liability cases and
establishing a climate friendlier to business.</TE>
<TE>   "We had become the poster child of a bad civil justice system,"
said Bill Yates, a construction company owner who chairs the
Mississippi Economic Council, the state's chamber of commerce. "And
this, I do believe, tells the nation we are trying to get our ship in
shape."</TE>
<TE>   Among the changes is a system of graduated limits on punitive
damages -- those aimed at punishing wrongdoing -- that caps judgments
against the biggest companies at $20 million. The smallest firms --
those whose net worth is $50 million or less -- could be ordered to
pay no more than 4%, or up to $2 million, in punitive damages.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the new law protects retailers from being held liable
for selling defective products they did not design or produce. The
package also places tighter controls on where lawsuits can be filed
and, in cases where there is more than one defendant, makes the
damages a defendant must pay proportional to its share of blame for
non-economic losses. There is no cap on noneconomic damages, such as
pain and suffering.</TE>
<TE>   The reforms, which go into effect Jan. 1, are coming under fire
from trial lawyers, who accused Mississippi's leaders of creating a
legal system that will allow big companies to act with impunity by
making it potentially less expensive to put the public at risk in
pursuit of profits.</TE>
<TE>   "Reform is a misnomer," said David Baria, a Jackson attorney who
is president of the Mississippi Trial Lawyers Assn. "To cap punitive
damages is to say to corporate America that they can injure or kill
people and be held less accountable than in the majority of states in
this country."</TE>
<TE>   Baria said the state's politicians fell prey to a powerful public
relations campaign that convinced them that broad reforms were
needed, when flaws could have been fixed through minor modifications.
"The Legislature of Mississippi said, 'It's more important to make
Mississippi business-friendly than to make it a place where
businesses are accountable,' " Baria said.</TE>
<TE>   Mississippi became the target of reform efforts after a string of
big-money judgments. The state has seen seven verdicts of $100
million or more in as many years, among them a $150-million judgment
in favor of five plaintiffs who sued the maker of the diet drug
fen-phen after they reported health problems related to the drug. A
$500-million judgment against a Canadian funeral home company in 1995
was later settled for about $175 million. A $150-million award last
year to six men who sued asbestos makers is under appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Critics have accused plaintiffs' lawyers of choosing Mississippi
as the spot for suing out-of-state companies because its jurors --
many of them poor -- have proved sympathetic toward consumers in
claims against big corporations. But in the process, Mississippi
business owners also have been named as co-defendants in what reform
advocates characterized as a ploy by plaintiffs to get their cases
tried in Mississippi. In rural Jefferson County, the number of
plaintiffs in mass lawsuits exceeded the number of people living
there.</TE>
<TE>   Business leaders complained that outsized judgments scared
investors away from sinking money into the state.</TE>
<TE>   Musgrove said the new law will help him market the state, which
two years ago landed a Nissan plant that will employ about 5,000
automobile workers when it is built north of Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   Legal reform had been on Mississippi's agenda before, but it
gained new urgency this year as a result of the lobbying campaign and
the looming prospect of an explosive issue during statewide elections
next year. Musgrove, a Democrat, summoned lawmakers to the extra
session in September, initially to tackle the malpractice issue,
which had become a cause of widespread concern as physicians and
insurers left for more hospitable states.</TE>
<TE>   The medical malpractice law limits pain and suffering awards to
$500,000 until 2011, when it increases to $750,000. The figure rises
to $1 million in 2017. The law also requires that lawsuits be filed
in the county where the alleged malpractice occurred. After weeks of
deadlock, weary lawmakers reached agreement three days before
Thanksgiving on the civil law reforms, after a special session that
cost $1.6 million and was among the longest in state history.</TE>
<TE>   The battle may not be over. Business advocates are expected to
seek more limits when the Legislature reconvenes next year. The trial
lawyers are bracing for a new round.. "These guys have a multiyear
plan and they will be back for additional measures that provide them
less accountability," Baria said.</TE>

<HD>Bratton Announces Key Appointees</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Andrew Blankstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Police Department's new gang czar, Capt. Michael Hillmann, is
described by LAPD officials as well as rank-and-file officers as a
cop who is as comfortable mulling police tactics with the brass as he
is donning riot gear in the streets.</LD>
<LD>   The 35-year department veteran, who heads its Air Support Services
Division, was one of three key appointments made by Chief William J.
Bratton on Tuesday, along with Cmdr. Earl C. Paysinger and Police
Administrator Laura Johnson.</LD>
<LD>   Hillman is receiving a rare two-level promotion to become deputy
chief.</LD>
<TE>   Paysinger, who is the department's employee relations
administrator, succeeds Deputy Chief Willie Pannell as head of the
South Bureau operations.</TE>
<TE>   With Hillman and Paysinger, Bratton has a team in place that will
execute his strategy to combat spiraling gang violence that has hit
South Los Angeles particularly hard.</TE>
<TE>   "They are the right fit for the right jobs," said Assistant Chief
Jim McDonnell. "They both bring solid experience and a well-deserved
reputation for leadership"</TE>
<TE>   Both men were praised by police union officials and top commanders
as innovators with the ability to listen to community concerns,
qualities that Bratton said will be a key to remaking the department.</TE>
<TE>   Police Protective League President Bob Baker described Hillmann as
a natural leader.</TE>
<TE>   "He's very operationally savvy, but he's also sensitive to the
community," Baker said. "I know that the men and women of the
department will listen when he speaks, and that's important right
now."</TE>
<TE>   Mitzi Grasso, the union's vice president, called Paysinger a
breath of fresh air as well as "a guy who's not afraid to mix it up."</TE>
<TE>   "He's looking for new ways to deploy our patrol officers to
address rising crime problems," Grasso said.</TE>
<TE>   Paysinger, a 27-year LAPD veteran, was in the news in the 1990s
when it was learned that a gun registered in his name was the one
held by O.J. Simpson during the infamous low-speed Bronco chase.
Paysinger told investigators that he bought the gun for Simpson to
help provide security for the former running back.</TE>
<TE>   While off duty, Paysinger also worked as a bodyguard for Oakland
Raiders owner Al Davis while the team was in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Those who know Paysinger say he is familiar with the South Bureau
and is equipped to handle the new job. With the retirements of
Assistant Chief J.I. Davis and Pannell, he is the highest-ranking
African American to serve on Bratton's command staff.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to serving in the department's Metropolitan Division,
Paysinger worked various assignments at the Southwest and 77th Street
stations, which will be at the heart of Bratton's anti-gang battle in
South Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Hillmann, the point man for those efforts, brings a background
with a variety of assignments, including work in the Metropolitan
Division, the special weapons and tactics team and the Anti-Terrorist
Division. He also has been captain of the West Los Angeles Division.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson has served as commanding officer of the support services
group. She will now head the fiscal and support bureau.</TE>
<TE>   All three of Bratton's appointees will be sworn in today at a
ceremony at the 77th Street station.</TE>

<HD>Bush Revives Stump Speech in Louisiana</HD>
<DH>At rallies for Republican challenger in Senate runoff, the
president delivers same message largely credited for GOP gains last
month.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Gerstenzang</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SHREVEPORT, La.</DL>
<LD>The message worked well for President Bush throughout the fall: a
30-minute discourse on the benefits of cutting taxes, on filling the
Senate with Republicans who would approve his judicial nominations,
and -- most emphatically -- the threats posed by Al Qaeda terrorists
and Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.</LD>
<LD>   Bush delivered this speech more than 50 times on the campaign
trail, and his efforts gained much of the credit for the strong GOP
showing on election day.</LD>
<LD>   So, with one Senate seat still at stake, he offered it twice again
Tuesday in Louisiana, where incumbent Democrat Mary Landrieu faces
Republican Suzanne Haik Terrell in a runoff Saturday. The two were
the top finishers in the Nov. 5 general election among nine
candidates, but a runoff was required because neither got more than
50% of the vote.</LD>
<TE>   Landrieu came close, winning 46%. But three Republicans, led by
Terrell with 27%, combined for 51%, giving the GOP hope that Landrieu
is vulnerable.</TE>
<TE>   Landrieu narrowly won election to a first term six years ago when
she shared the ballot with President Clinton, who was seeking
reelection. Polls indicate her runoff with Terrell could be close,
especially without a solid turnout by African Americans, who tend to
vote overwhelmingly Democratic.</TE>
<TE>   With Bush's help, Republicans took over Democratic seats in
Georgia, Minnesota and Missouri in November's balloting to regain
control of the 100-member Senate. The Louisiana election will
determine whether there are 51 GOP senators or 52.</TE>
<TE>   That could represent an important difference on some closely
contested issues, such as economic policy, White House Press
Secretary Ari Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   To help Terrell, the state election commissioner, Vice President
Dick Cheney and former President George Bush already have campaigned
in the state.</TE>
<TE>   The current president, in stops Tuesday in Shreveport and New
Orleans, provided one overarching argument for Terrell's election.
"She's the kind of person with whom I can work," he said at a rally
in Shreveport.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, a Republican almost certain to support his
economic, social and foreign policy agenda.</TE>
<TE>   Bush stressed that he needed more Republican senators to overcome
Democratic opposition to some of his judicial nominees.</TE>
<TE>   He won some of his heartiest cheers here Tuesday when he said he
looked forward to "working with Suzie to make sure that our judiciary
represents the values of Louisiana."</TE>
<TE>   Bush noted that after the Nov. 5 election, the Senate acted
quickly on several pending judicial nominations in its lame-duck
session.</TE>
<TE>   "Amazing what an election did," Bush said. "Kind of changed the
attitude in Washington.... They were playing politics with the
judges."</TE>
<TE>   He also focused on his bid to make permanent the $1.35-trillion
tax cut Congress enacted in 2001. As of now, the tax cuts -- many of
which take effect in the next few years -- will all expire after
2010.</TE>
<TE>   "There's one person in this Senate race who's willing to stand up
and say she will join the president in listening to the people and
make the tax cuts permanent -- and that is Suzie Terrell," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   Landrieu brings significant advantages to her reelection bid,
including deep political roots in the state. Her father, Moon
Landrieu, was a mayor of New Orleans and served in President Carter's
Cabinet. She has served in the state Legislature and as state
treasurer.</TE>
<TE>   As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, she has
directed federal funds toward her state.</TE>
<TE>   She also has a voting record that may shield her from some of the
GOP attacks on her. She voted for the 10-year tax cut measure. She
supports the administration's bid to drill for oil in part of the
Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. She voted for the resolution Bush
sought to authorize the potential use of force against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, she claims to have voted for 75% of the legislation Bush
has supported.</TE>
<TE>   Terrell, though, said it would better serve Bush's interests to
replace Landrieu and increase the GOP's margin in the Senate. "I will
not be a roadblock to your leadership," she said as she introduced
him in Shreveport.</TE>
<TE>   The president dealt gingerly with the state's largely Democratic
political tradition. Louisiana hasn't been represented in the Senate
by a Republican since the post-Civil War Reconstruction period. But
the state's senior senator, John B. Breaux, has proved to be a useful
link to the Democrats for Bush.</TE>
<TE>   At the rally in Shreveport, Bush suggested that in the closely
divided Senate, having both Breaux and Terrell in office would best
serve Louisiana's interests.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes sense to have one in one party, and a senator in the
majority party if you want to get something done," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The president received a roaring welcome at the Shreveport event.
Several thousand people on the floor of the Louisiana State
Fairgrounds arena waved small American flags to greet him, while more
flags swayed in the hands of perhaps 5,000 people in the arena seats.</TE>
<TE>   Bush reminded his audience that he had been in Shreveport once
before as president. On Sept. 11, 2001, Air Force One brought him to
Barksdale Air Force Base, as he hurried from an appearance in Florida
to the security of military bases in Louisiana and Nebraska before
returning to Washington after the attacks on the World Trade Center
and the Pentagon. The threat posed by that day's terrorism
illustrated "why I elevated the issue of Iraq," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush also headlined a fund-raising lunch for Terrell in New
Orleans. As he arrived at the downtown hotel for the event, he was
greeted by more than 100 protesters shouting their opposition to a
possible war with Iraq. Many chanted, "No blood for oil."</TE>

<HD>Auction of Car Used in Texas Murder Upsets Mother</HD>
<DH>No one bids $10,000 for '86 Honda used by Texas prison
escapees who fatally shot officer. Pastor says he wanted to raise
funds for church.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lianne Hart</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>In the jumble of miscellany that is eBay, the ad went unnoticed for
days. For sale: 1986 Honda Accord, a "historical collector's item"
used by seven Texas fugitives after a prison breakout two years ago.
Minimum bid, $10,000.</LD>
<LD>   Though the price -- five times the sedan's blue book value --
included the car title and "all the newspaper articles, the subpoena,
etc.," there were no takers when the online auction ended Monday. But
there is now an angry Dallas mother, who heard about the attempted
sale.</LD>
<LD>   "What kind of person would try to attach some sick allure to the
car because a criminal sat in it?" asked Jayne Hawkins, whose son
Aubrey, a police officer, was killed when he confronted the escapees
during a Christmas Eve robbery in 2000.</LD>
<TE>   "It's not their place to sensationalize people who hurt my child,"
Hawkins said Tuesday. "It's immoral."</TE>
<TE>   The man behind the eBay ad is Albert Struck, pastor of the Word of
Jesus Christ Church in Pueblo, Colo. His auction listing explained
that "all proceeds received from this vehicle will go towards a new
church building."</TE>
<TE>   Although calls to the church Tuesday were not returned, Struck has
expressed surprise at Hawkins' reaction. "It's just a car," he told
Associated Press. "It's just a vehicle that they drove in. It wasn't
used for anything but to transport them from Texas to Colorado."</TE>
<TE>   The Honda was not re-listed on eBay on Tuesday. But in the
original pitch, Struck said that he got the car after he found an
envelope containing the keys in the church mailbox. "May God bless
you the way he blessed us," read the enclosed note, which also
contained directions to the Accord.</TE>
<TE>   The fugitives gave up their car a month after escaping Dec. 13,
2000, from a Texas prison in Kenedy, south of San Antonio. They first
headed north to Irving, where they robbed an Oshman's sporting goods
store, shooting Hawkins 11 times after he arrived to investigate.</TE>
<TE>   The escapees, crammed in the four-door sedan, eventually drove to
Woodland Park, Colo. Six of the convicts were captured in late
January 2001; the seventh committed suicide. The group's ringleader,
George Rivas, and two others are now on Texas' death row.</TE>
<TE>   Their blue getaway car has taken a pounding. Struck's eBay listing
warned that "the back light was ripped out by the FBI while looking
for evidence.... They had to cut out 2 small pieces of the car seat
because it had blood evidence that they needed in court."
Furthermore, "the Texas Seven ripped out the radio before they
donated the car to us."</TE>
<TE>   Jayne Hawkins doesn't know whether these are selling points or
attempts at full disclosure. Either way, she's disgusted. "I wouldn't
touch that car," she said. "It's like buying a house where someone
was brutally murdered. Who would want to live there? It's tainted."</TE>
<TE>   She is so upset she's thinking about giving Struck and his wife a
call. "If they're honest Christians and the car is worth $1,500, why
don't they sell it for $1,500 and forget it?" she said.</TE>
<TE>   Struck's listing -- which promoted the Honda as the "Texas Seven
Escapees Car" -- probably violated eBay's "offensive listings
guidelines," said spokesman Kevin Pursglove. But with 12 million
items up for auction, and 1.8 million new listings each day, eBay
can't catch every inappropriate ad, he said.</TE>
<TE>   If Struck omitted all references to the Honda's history, "he could
sell the car on eBay in the same manner thousands of other people
sell their cars," Pursglove said.</TE>

<HD>Incineration of Chemical Arms Backed</HD>
<DH>The U.S. stockpile can be safely burned, despite problems
at existing sites, report says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>America's arsenal of chemical weapons can be safely incinerated at a
few sites around the country, despite chemical releases and
violations at the only two operational incinerators, according to a
report released Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "The risk to the public and to the environment of continued
storage overwhelms the potential risk of processing and destruction
of stockpiled chemical agent," said the report by the National
Research Council, a branch of the National Academies of Science. "The
destruction of aging chemical munitions should proceed as quickly as
possible."</LD>
<LD>   The council did not weigh in on whether incineration was
preferable to other methods of neutralizing the chemical agents.</LD>
<TE>   Critics who favor other options said the report ignored important
incidents and glossed over the dangers of incineration.</TE>
<TE>   Under an international treaty, the United States agreed to dispose
of 31,500 tons of deadly nerve agents and toxic blister agents by
2007, although the Defense Department has said it will probably miss
that deadline by two to three years. The project is expected to cost
$24 billion.</TE>
<TE>   About a quarter of the stockpile has been destroyed at weapon
incinerators in Tooele, Utah, and on Johnston Atoll in the Pacific
Ocean.</TE>
<TE>   "The technology is capable of doing the job if it's run correctly,
and there's no reason it cannot be run correctly if management puts
its mind to it and trains its work force properly," said Charles
Kolb, chairman of the committee.</TE>
<TE>   The council report identified 40 cases in which chemical agents
leaked into areas where they were not supposed to have been and three
in which they escaped from an incinerator building. But it said the
amounts that escaped were too small to threaten the public.</TE>

<HD>Unity Is Key to Victory, Clinton Tells Democrats</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Former President Clinton said Tuesday that the Republicans won last
month's midterm elections on "message, money and turnout," and he
advised Democrats to present a unified voice on national security if
they want to win in the future.</LD>
<LD>   In the two-term president's first public speech on the issue since
the Republicans took control of the House and Senate last month,
Clinton also said his party needed to support its leaders when they
are "demonized" for questioning the policies of President Bush.</LD>
<LD>   "We cannot wilt in the face of higher negative ratings for our
leaders.... We abandon them at our peril," he said, speaking before
the centrist Democratic Leadership Council at New York University.</LD>
<TE>   Clinton, who had campaigned heavily for Democratic candidates
leading up to the elections, said that because his party failed to
present a coherent message on national security, many voters had the
mistaken impression that it didn't have one. "It's not fair to say we
were missing in action on national security," he said. "Democrats
supported the president against terror. They overwhelmingly supported
the defense increases. Most of them supported the position on Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   However, Clinton said, Democrats failed to articulate their stance
well enough.</TE>
<TE>   "They won on message, money and turnout," Clinton said of the
Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   The Republicans also were helped by the country's "psychological
need for unity" after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade
Center and the Pentagon, said Clinton, whose wife, Hillary Rodham
Clinton, is a Democratic U.S. senator representing New York.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats also need to be more vocal on issues of "real homeland
security," an area in which the party has a stronger position than
the GOP, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats have been pressing issues such as protecting the United
States' transportation system from potential attack and readying the
country in the event of the release of anthrax or other types of
untraditional attacks, Clinton said.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a national security issue. It's a homeland security
issue," he said. "We didn't say it in the last elections, and if we
had, it would have made a difference in some of these races."</TE>

<HD>No Holiday Chaos at Airports, but Thousands of Items Seized</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Some passengers still haven't gotten the word about what they can't
take on planes. Seized at airports during the Thanksgiving travel
crush: 15,982 pocketknives, 98 box cutters, six guns and a brick.</LD>
<LD>   Still, transportation officials said the airport chaos predicted
by many never occurred. Passengers waited less than 10 minutes on
average at security checkpoints during the first holiday travel
season since an all-federal work force took over screening.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Wascom, spokesman for a group representing the major
airlines, said operations were generally smooth even with bad weather
in some places. "Passengers moved efficiently through the airports,
and customer service standards were upheld," said Wascom, spokesman
for the Air Transport Assn.</LD>
<TE>   Since the Sept. 11 attacks, the government has tightened
restrictions on what can be taken on board a plane.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Johnson, spokesman for the Transportation Security
Administration, said many holiday travelers are inexperienced fliers
and don't realize they can't take knives, scissors, fireworks or
ammunition onto planes. If they try to, the prohibited items will be
confiscated. Passengers also could be prosecuted, a decision made by
law enforcement officials depending on the item and the
circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   From Tuesday to Sunday, six people who tried to carry guns onto
planes were arrested: two at Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport
and one each at New York's LaGuardia Airport, Cincinnati/Northern
Kentucky International Airport, Salt Lake City International Airport
and Dulles International Airport outside Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "We find the gun, we turn the passenger over to law enforcement at
the checkpoint," Johnson said. Charges vary, but most often they're a
variation on possession of a prohibited weapon, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "You're not allowed to have a gun at the airport without a
permit," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Transportation Security Administration says that at the 38
busiest U.S. airports over the Thanksgiving holiday, 1,072 clubs or
bats were confiscated, 3,242 banned tools and 2,384 flammable items,
including a welding gun in Boise, Idaho. Another 20,581 sharp objects
-- such as scissors, ice picks and meat cleavers -- also were stopped
at the checkpoints. Someone tried to bring a toy cannon with live
ammunition onto a plane at Chicago O'Hare International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   A man tried to carry a brick onto a plane at Ronald Reagan
National Airport near Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know why he would carry a brick," Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   The security administration can't make year-to-year comparisons
because the data collection method has changed -- the six guns taken
from 38 airports in six days compare with 813 firearms taken from 429
airports in the eight months from February to September. During that
same period, 783,670 knives and 31,064 box cutters were seized,
compared with 15,982 knives and 98 box cutters over Thanksgiving.</TE>
<TE>   The prohibited items are turned over to local police, where
they're either kept as evidence or thrown away, Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   The security administration hopes to better educate people about
what they can take onto airplanes by Christmas, when air travel will
be complicated by new gate check procedures and many more checked
bags screened for explosives. "We would expect that, with the
Christmas holiday, a lot of these people will be back, and we hope
they'll learn their lesson," Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   The agency is slowly eliminating random security checks of
passengers at airport gates throughout the country. Six airports have
been phased in, and more will be by Christmas, Johnson said. Air
travelers must have their boarding passes in hand before being
screened at those airports where gate screening has been eliminated,
even if they don't check their luggage.</TE>
<TE>   Airlines are adding more self-service kiosks outside of the
checkpoints so travelers can get their boarding passes without
waiting at ticket counters.</TE>

<HD>Kerry Offers Economic Proposal</HD>
<DH>The likely Democratic presidential candidate outlines his
differences with Bush's tax plan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald Brownstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Likely Democratic presidential candidate John F. Kerry offered an
economic plan Tuesday that urges a sweeping retrenchment of President
Bush's $1.35-trillion, 10-year tax cut, but also relies heavily on
new short-term tax breaks to stimulate the economy.</LD>
<LD>   The plan by Kerry, who last month won a fourth Senate term in
Massachusetts, seemed designed to both sharpen his differences with
Bush and position him in the center of the emerging Democratic field.</LD>
<LD>   Rather than emphasizing new spending, Kerry proposed to pump
additional purchasing power into the economy by cutting taxes on
businesses that create jobs and by temporarily eliminating the Social
Security tax on the first $10,000 in workers' earnings. He also
promised as president to "take a hard look" at waste in the federal
budget.</LD>
<TE>   But he denounced the further cuts in income tax rates due in 2004
under the Bush tax plan -- reductions the administration may try to
accelerate next year as part of its stimulus package.</TE>
<TE>   "The new Bush tax cuts are unfair, unaffordable and unquestionably
ineffective in growing our economy," Kerry contended in an address to
the City Club of Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   Kerry's speech illustrated that the Bush tax cut should prove a
key point of division between the parties in 2004 -- and among
Democrats next year.</TE>
<TE>   While Democratic congressional leaders have opposed efforts to
challenge the tax cut -- mainly because many of their members from
conservative states support it -- virtually every Democrat exploring
the 2004 presidential race has now called for rolling back parts of
the law.</TE>
<TE>   A White House spokesman, previewing a GOP response likely to be
heard often as the '04 campaign gears up, said Kerry's proposal
amounted to raising taxes by denying Americans future tax breaks they
now expect.</TE>
<TE>   "There appear to be differences within the Democratic Party about
how they want to go about raising taxes," said White House spokesman
Scott McClellan. "Once they resolve those differences, there will be
plenty of time to contrast the Democratic approach with the
president's view that tax cuts encourage job creation and economic
growth."</TE>
<TE>   Kerry, a Vietnam veteran who turns 59 next week, quickened the
pace of the 2004 Democratic race last week when he announced that he
would form an exploratory committee to begin organizing support for a
presidential candidacy.</TE>
<TE>   Outgoing Vermont Gov. Howard Dean has also said that he will seek
the nomination. Former Vice President Al Gore and Rep. Richard A.
Gephardt (D-Mo.) have indicated they will make their plans clear by
early next month.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. John Edwards (D-N.C.) has begun organizing a campaign staff,
and Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), the Democrats' vice
presidential nominee in 2000, has said he will run if Gore does not.
Outgoing Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) also is a
prospective candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Kerry's speech continued a flurry of policy addresses from the
likely 2004 Democratic contenders. In part, the early start reflects
the acceleration of the Democratic primary calendar. Under the
party's new rules, Iowa and New Hampshire hold the first nominating
contests in January 2004, with other states following as early as
Feb. 3.</TE>
<TE>   With his speech, Kerry joined Gore, Lieberman, Dean and Edwards in
urging a freeze on aspects of the Bush tax cut. Kerry argued that the
tax cut would benefit mostly the wealthy and could be financed only
by diverting taxes collected for Social Security and Medicare.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush tax plan, which Kerry voted against last year, cut income
tax rates across the board in 2001, and provided for further rate
reductions in 2004 and 2006.</TE>
<TE>   Though Kerry did not specify which elements of the Bush tax cut he
would oppose, his press secretary, David Wade, said the senator would
repeal the 2004 and 2006 reductions scheduled for the top three
income-tax brackets. Through 2006, the top rate paid by the highest
earners is scheduled to fall from 38.6% to 35%, the next rate from
35% to 33%, and the third from 30% to 28%.</TE>
<TE>   Kerry's plan is among the more aggressive assaults on the Bush
plan; it would reduce future tax breaks for families earning about
$113,000 a year or more, after deductions. By comparison, Edwards and
Lieberman want to block further rate cuts in just the top two
brackets, which would affect families earning $172,000 a year or
more, after deductions.</TE>
<TE>   Kerry's freeze on the top three rates would save about $400
billion over the next decade, his staff said.</TE>
<TE>   Kerry would maintain the scheduled cuts in the next bracket, from
27% to 25%, as well as an increase in the tax credit for parents with
children, and relief targeting married couples.</TE>
<TE>   With the savings from his proposal, Kerry said, he would fund an
economic plan that leans heavily toward alternative tax cuts in the
near term and spurring technological advance in the long run.</TE>
<TE>   To invigorate the economy now, Kerry said, he would provide a tax
credit to offset the $765 in Social Security and Medicare taxes
workers pay on their first $10,000 in earnings; that would cost at
least $100 billion over the next year. And he said he would further
help "hard-working families" by increasing the minimum wage and
expanding the earned income tax credit, which targets the working
poor.</TE>
<TE>   Kerry then proposed a series of tax cuts aimed at business,
including a "job creation tax credit" for employers who hire new
workers and the elimination of capital gains on investments held for
five years in start-up companies developing "critical technologies,"
such as alternative energy sources.</TE>
<TE>   The new spending in Kerry's stimulus proposal appeared modest: an
extension of unemployment benefits and an unspecified increase in
spending on infrastructure, especially high-speed rail and other
transportation projects.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, when Gephardt offered a stimulus plan in October, he
called for $75 billion in short-term tax cuts and $125 billion in
spending on infrastructure, school construction, health care and aid
to fiscally strapped states.</TE>

<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>University of Massachusetts President William M. Bulger on Tuesday
defended his decision not to alert law enforcement authorities after
being contacted by his fugitive mobster brother in 1995.</LD>
<LD>   Bulger said his brother, James "Whitey" Bulger, called him in
January 1995 -- shortly after he fled Massachusetts -- and asked for
legal advice.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a private conversation," William Bulger said, when asked
by reporters why he didn't report the contact with his brother to
authorities.</LD>
<TE>   Bulger said the brief conversation was the only contact he has had
with his brother since he left the state just before he was indicted
on racketeering counts.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no knowledge of his whereabouts," Bulger, 68, said
Tuesday. James Bulger, 73, has been indicted on charges related to 18
murders, and he is on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list.</TE>
<TE>   William Bulger's remarks Tuesday came in response to a published
report about his testimony before a federal grand jury last year. The
Boston Globe, which obtained a copy of transcripts of Bulger's
testimony, reported Tuesday that Bulger told the grand jury that his
brother called him seeking legal advice. He said he didn't urge him
to surrender to authorities because he didn't "think it would be in
his interest to do so."</TE>
<TE>   Bulger also acknowledged that he did not feel compelled to help
authorities find his brother.</TE>
<TE>   "It's my hope that I'm never helpful to anyone against him.... I
don't feel an obligation to help everyone to catch him," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bulger told reporters Tuesday that his lawyers were still
evaluating whether he would appear before a congressional committee
holding hearings in Boston on Thursday and Friday.</TE>

<HD>More Nurses Join the Picket Lines in Hawaii</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HONOLULU</DL>
<LD>Nurses at Hawaii's largest hospital went on strike Tuesday morning,
joining colleagues from two other Honolulu hospitals on the picket
lines.</LD>
<LD>   Officials at the Queen's Medical Center said care has been
unaffected by the latest walkout, but nurses were skeptical about
their patients' well-being.</LD>
<LD>   "It doesn't feel right that they're all sitting in there and we
don't know what kind of care they're given," said Julie Bachmann, who
has been a nurse for 16 years, the last 13 at Queen's. "It bothers
you. But there comes a point when we need some care too."</LD>
<TE>   Bachmann was one of more than 100 nurses picketing in several
locations outside the hospital Tuesday afternoon. The Hawaii Nurses
Assn. said the nurses voted overwhelmingly Monday to reject an offer
from management, sending them to the picket lines at 7 a.m. Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The Queen's strike began 24 hours after nurses at two other
hospitals in the city -- Kuakini Medical Center and St. Francis
Medical Center -- walked out.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 1,400 of the state's nurses are now on strike, and a union
spokesman said he didn't expect any immediate change. The union said
no new talks have been scheduled and none were in sight for the next
couple of days.</TE>
<TE>   Union officials said they would continue their walkout as long as
it takes to get a settlement. And hospital leaders said they were
equipped to handle it.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Queen's said the hospital has flown in about 250
nurses from the mainland to work during the strike. And registered
nurses who normally work in management took over patient care.</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Riley, a nurse at Queen's, said many in her profession
are taking jobs outside of Hawaii because of low pay and benefits.</TE>

<HD>Postal Service Buys Pills to Protect Workers in an Attack</HD>
<DH>The potassium iodide will be distributed in the event of a
nuclear release. Spokesman says the move is not related to a specific
threat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Randy Trick</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The U.S. Postal Service is purchasing 1.6 million doses of potassium
iodide pills to protect its employees against thyroid cancer in the
event of a nuclear explosion or meltdown.</LD>
<LD>   Taking a cue from the anthrax scare a year ago, the postal service
is spending nearly $293,000 to give its 750,000 employees the
opportunity to have two days' worth of potassium iodide tablets
waiting for them at work.</LD>
<LD>   The cost of buying the medication breaks down to 18.3 cents per
tablet, bringing the cost of two days of protection to 37 cents per
employee, the same as a first-class stamp.</LD>
<TE>   The money is coming from the agency's $70-billion budget, which is
expected to have a $600-million surplus next year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an infinitesimal fraction of a percent," postal service
spokesman Gerry Kreienkamp said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "It sounds like a lot of money, but in postal budget terms, it's
pocket change."</TE>
<TE>   The recommendation to purchase the tablets came from the postal
service's mail security task force, created in the month after the
anthrax scare.</TE>
<TE>   The postal service says the decision is not related to the
agency's response to the anthrax scare, nor is it related to a threat
of nuclear terrorism specific to the postal service.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI issued a general terrorism alert last month but maintains
that the aviation, petroleum and nuclear sectors are the likeliest
targets.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to be proactive about the health and safety of our
employees," said postal service spokeswoman Sue Brennan.</TE>
<TE>   "We will be able to give protection in the event of an emergency."</TE>
<TE>   The president of Anbex Inc., the New York-based company supplying
the postal service with the tablets, said he sees a connection.</TE>
<TE>   "The postal service got hurt by the anthrax scare and became more
sensitized to national security," Alan Morris said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The postal service is the first government agency to offer
potassium iodide, which prevents absorption of radioactive iodine by
the thyroid gland, to all its employees.</TE>
<TE>   Anbex has already shipped 1 million doses.</TE>
<TE>   Morris hopes that the postal service's decision encourages other
government agencies to provide similar safety measures for their
employees, but he is doubtful.</TE>
<TE>   "The post office now has this protection, but the police don't
have it, the fire departments don't have it and the military doesn't
have it," Morris said.</TE>
<TE>   He occasionally fields calls from the military concerning prices
and availability but receives few domestic orders, he said.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the White House Office of Homeland Security,
Gordon Johndroe, said that his agency had not advised other
government departments to provide the tablets to their employees.</TE>
<TE>   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has offered 34 states enough
potassium iodide to give each person within 10 miles of a nuclear
reactor two days' worth of medication.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what we've determined is the appropriate course of
action," Johndroe said.</TE>
<TE>   Anbex recommends a 14-day course of treatment. The NRC
recommendation presupposes that affected people will move quickly out
of the danger zone.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, only half of those
34 states, including California, have decided to accept the pills.</TE>
<TE>   The commission will not pressure the remaining states, said
Rosetta Virgilio, a NRC spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   Although California is taking advantage of the NRC's offer, it has
not distributed the tablets.</TE>
<TE>   Plans to get them to the 90,000 people living near the San Onofre
Nuclear Generating Station north of Oceanside and the 300,000 near
the Diablo Canyon nuclear reactor in San Luis Obispo County may be
finalized by the end of February of next year, said Eric Lamoureux,
spokesman for the Governor's Office of Emergency Services.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Freezes Aid for Workers First in Line on Terror
Response</HD>
<DH>Failure to OK the federal budget is cited. Suspension is
expected to be temporary.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Janet Hook</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Although President Bush has repeatedly promised to boost federal aid
to firefighters and other emergency workers, the Justice Department
this week temporarily suspended awarding grants to aid these first
responders to terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Administration officials said the delay in the program, which had
been expected to get a big budget hike in the aftermath of the Sept.
11 terror attacks on New York City and the Pentagon, stemmed from the
failure of Congress to finish the budget for domestic programs before
adjourning last month. Instead, lawmakers postponed final spending
decisions until mid-January at the earliest.</LD>
<LD>   "At this point, we can only speculate on the availability of
resources for the balance of the fiscal year," said Assistant Atty.
Gen. Deborah J. Daniels in a memo Monday explaining why a variety of
programs and initiatives was being postponed.</LD>
<TE>   At issue is a program, which took on new visibility and importance
after the terrorist attacks, that provides grants to state and local
governments to provide equipment and training for fire and police
departments and other agencies that are likely to be among the first
to respond to a terrorist attack.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats on the House Appropriations Committee, who released a
copy of Daniels' memo, upbraided the department for not continuing to
award grants with the money included in the interim funding bill
Congress passed to finance programs through Jan. 11.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department grant freeze "follows a pattern of Bush
holding highly trumped-up photo ops with first responders and then
subsequently rejecting money for them," committee Democrats said.</TE>
<TE>   The grant program for the first responders is just one of many
homeland security programs thrown into limbo because Congress passed
none of the 11 appropriation bills needed to finance domestic
programs for the budget year that began Oct. 1. Instead, Congress
provided only short-term funding at 2002 levels -- delaying expected
increases for agencies such as the Coast Guard, the Customs Service
and the FBI that emerged as priorities after the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   John Scofield, spokesman for the Republicans on the House
Appropriations Committee, said the Justice Department's delay in
dispensing grants was "prudent," and that its effects would be only
temporary. But he said it was a prime example of the adverse effects
of Congress and the White House not reaching timely agreement on a
budget.</TE>
<TE>   "Punting the budget until January is not the best way to govern,"
said Scofield. "There will be some real consequences, albeit
temporary."</TE>
<TE>   Funding for the program last year was $651 million; Bush proposed
increasing it to $3.5 billion. Congress is expected to follow suit
with a big increase, but it has not yet finished work on the Justice
Department's appropriation. Under the stopgap spending bill, the
department continued to make grants -- until this week.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with uncertainty about the department's final budget for the
year, Daniels said in her memo that the agency would postpone
implementation of new policies, including a restructuring of several
juvenile justice programs, as well as the distribution of grants
until after the full-year budget is set.</TE>
<TE>   "We find ourselves in a holding pattern," said Daniels. Another
administration official explained that the department would have to
duplicate the award applications process if they went ahead with
interim funding levels and then received a big increase.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of uncertainty, and it doesn't make sense [to award
grants] until we see what Congress ultimately decides," the
administration official said.</TE>
<TE>   David Sirota, spokesman for the Democrats on the House
Appropriations Committee, argued that the administration's response
"shows a fundamental lack of a sense of urgency."</TE>
<TE>   It is particularly galling to Democrats because Bush has appeared
at many rallies with emergency workers, lavishing praise on their
efforts and promising to pour resources into the program.</TE>
<TE>   But in August 2002, after Congress sent Bush a bill providing
supplemental funding for a variety of homeland security programs, he
refused to spend $150 million included for first-responder grants.</TE>

<HD>Astronaut Has Her Return Meal Menu Set</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.</DL>
<LD>After six months of indoor exercise, bagged meals and tepid drinks
aboard the international space station, astronaut Peggy Whitson is
looking forward to walking off shuttle Endeavour and dining on Caesar
salad and steak.</LD>
<LD>   And she plans to top it off with a cold soft drink.</LD>
<LD>   "We don't have any carbonated drinks up here, so I'm looking
forward to that," Whitson said Tuesday, "and anything with ice in it
would be very nice as well."</LD>
<TE>   Her homecoming, though, may have to wait.</TE>
<TE>   NASA had hoped to beat approaching storms and bring Endeavour back
to Earth today. But Mission Control told the crew of seven it might
have to remain in orbit until at least Friday, because Thursday's
forecast was grim too.</TE>
<TE>   Endeavour is returning from a one-week space station visit. The
shuttle undocked from the space station Monday with Whitson and her
two Russian crewmates, Valery Korzun and Sergei Treschev, and left
behind a new girder and three men who will remain aboard the orbiting
outpost until March.</TE>
<TE>   Whitson, a married 42-year-old biochemist who grew up in Iowa,
said she worked out diligently aboard the space station to be in good
shape for the return to Earth. Muscles and bones weaken in
weightlessness, and space station residents are under orders to
exercise one to two hours daily.</TE>
<TE>   "Actually, I gained a little bit of cardiovascular fitness while I
was up here," said Whitson, who has been in orbit since June 5.</TE>
<TE>   Some astronauts also become nauseated and dizzy when they feel
gravity again.</TE>
<TE>   NASA has limited experience with women who have had long stretches
in space. Only two other American women have lived aboard space
stations.</TE>

<HD>Fla. Sheriff Takes Lead on Smallpox Inoculation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ORLANDO, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Orange County Sheriff Kevin Beary didn't wince Tuesday as he was
pricked in his left arm 15 times with a small, two-pronged needle
containing the smallpox vaccine.</LD>
<LD>   Beary hopes most of his department's 1,400 deputies follow his
example by becoming among the first law enforcement officers in the
nation to get inoculated against the deadly virus. The inoculations
are voluntary.</LD>
<LD>   The sheriff decided to provide for the immunization of his
deputies independent of plans by the federal government to inoculate
500,000 emergency workers and 500,000 military personnel. President
Bush was expected to announce immunization plans this week.
Eventually, all Americans are expected to have access to the vaccine.</LD>
<TE>   "The best place to be is the lead dog on the sled," Beary said.
"We on the local level are waiting for the federal government to get
things done. They're doing a good job up there but I don't have time
to wait."</TE>
<TE>   Routine vaccinations in the United States ended in 1972, making
the population vulnerable to an attack. In 1980, the disease was
declared eradicated worldwide, and all samples of the virus were to
have been destroyed -- except those held by special labs in Atlanta
and Moscow.</TE>
<TE>   The broad fear is that terrorists might get their hands on some
samples, or somehow come up with their own virus, and use it to
attack unprotected citizens.</TE>
<TE>   The highly contagious virus, for which there is no known
treatment, historically killed 30% of its victims when it was able to
spread unchecked by inoculations.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at both the International Assn. of Chiefs of Police and
the National Sheriffs' Assn. in Alexandria, Va., said they knew of no
other sheriff's office that had moved to get deputies inoculated.</TE>
<TE>   Beary said he decided to proceed with immunizations because
Orlando was home to a clinical trial to create a treatment for people
who get sick from the smallpox vaccinations. The department is
getting the vaccine from Mid-Florida Biologicals, which is overseeing
development of the treatment.</TE>

its chilly grip on the Northeast. The regional forecast calls for a
slight warming trend, followed by more snow by the end of the week.</CP>

<HD>Environmentalists Sue to Keep Snowmobile Curbs in 2 Parks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Four environmental groups sued the Bush administration Tuesday,
seeking to block changes that would allow more people to ride
snowmobiles in Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court, asks a federal judge to
block a recent Interior Department decision that would undo a Clinton
administration ban on snowmobiles in the popular Western parks by
next winter.</LD>
<LD>   The environmental groups want the judge to keep the Clinton rule
in place. That would mean snowmobile use would be sharply limited
this winter and banned next year.</LD>
<TE>   The Interior Department would not limit snowmobiles this winter
under the proposal released last month. Starting next winter,
however, it would allow no more than 1,100 snowmobiles a day in the
parks and a portion of the John D. Rockefeller Jr. Memorial Parkway
connecting them.</TE>
<TE>   The parks have averaged 840 snowmobiles daily during the winter
and up to 1,650 a day during holiday and other busy weekends for the
last decade. The new rules would allow more snowmobiles in the parks
on average while cutting numbers on the busiest days.</TE>
<TE>   The current proposal is set to be completed next spring. That
leaves open the chance the final rules will be less restrictive than
what is on the table, said Howard Crystal, a lawyer for the
environmental groups.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing to prevent them from saying, 'You know what?
We've decided there's going to be no limits, ever,' " Crystal said.</TE>
<TE>   Although it could change, National Park Service regional spokesman
Rick Frost said he expects the final rule will be "very much like"
the current proposal.</TE>
<TE>   The case was filed by Public Employees for Environmental
Responsibility, the Fund for Animals, the Bluewater Network and the
Ecology Center.</TE>
<TE>   The groups argue that snowmobiles pollute the park, create
unacceptable noise and endanger the health of workers stationed at
park entrances.</TE>
<TE>   "These problems have been so severe that Yellowstone now supplies
fresh oxygen to employees working near snowmobiles, and this winter
these workers will be fitted with special devices to protect against
hearing loss," the lawsuit said.</TE>
<TE>   The groups also contend that the machines harass and hurt
wildlife. More than 200 bison, for example, were killed last year
after they followed groomed snowmobile trails out of the park and
into Montana or Wyoming, the lawsuit said.</TE>
<TE>   Yellowstone and Grand Teton are in northwestern Wyoming.
Yellowstone also extends into Idaho and Montana, from where most
snowmobilers enter the park.</TE>
<TE>   An environmental impact study of the current proposal is due in
February, with the final rules to be set in March.</TE>
<TE>   Frost said the plan was based on advances in snowmobile engines
that make them quieter and less polluting, while taking into account
environmental concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Pollution and the effect on wildlife would be monitored and the
caps could be adjusted to "allow us to protect the resource as well
as accommodate some limited snowmobile use," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a balanced approach to the issue of snowmobile use in the
parks," he said.</TE>

<HD>Minnesota University Reaches Accord in Anti-Semitism Suit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>St. Cloud State University agreed Tuesday to pay nearly $1 million
over the next five years to settle allegations of anti-Semitism among
administrators and professors.</LD>
<LD>   Three faculty members who sued a year ago -- Arie Zmora, Laurinda
Stryker and Geoffrey Tabakin -- will receive $314,678, while other
faculty members who filed discrimination or retaliation complaints
will share $50,000.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit alleged that department administrators disparaged
classes taught by Jewish professors to persuade students not to take
the courses. The lawsuit also said that Jewish faculty members were
paid less, denied promotions and not given full credit for their
teaching experience.</LD>
<TE>   Under the proposed settlement, which still requires approval from
a federal judge, the university also agreed to create a Jewish
Studies and Resources Center and hire a coordinator who will also
teach classes. The center will be funded for at least five years at
about $125,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   The university did not admit to any wrongdoing.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MONTGOMERY, Ala.</DL>
<LD>Attorneys who won a federal court order for Alabama's chief justice
to remove a Ten Commandments monument from the state's judicial
building have asked for $704,000 in legal fees and expenses.</LD>
<LD>   A motion filed in federal court Monday asks U.S. District Judge
Myron Thompson to approve the payment for the work of six attorneys
during a seven-day trial and for more than a year's preparation.</LD>
<LD>   Thompson ruled that the 5,300-pound granite monument to the Ten
Commandments is unconstitutional and gave Chief Justice Roy Moore 30
days to remove it. Moore, who had the monument moved into the rotunda
last year, has said he plans to appeal the ruling.</LD>
<TE>   Moore has said the money to fight the lawsuit would come out of
his pocket or from his supporters.</TE>

<HD>Nevada Challenges Nuclear Waste Ruling</HD>
<DH>State says in appellate court lawsuit that U.S. can't
assure radiation will be contained and that burial decision violates
federal law.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A decision to bury thousands of tons of nuclear waste in Nevada
should be overturned because the government cannot assure the site's
geology will keep radiation from seeping into the environment, the
state of Nevada has argued in a court filing.</LD>
<LD>   The brief, filed in a suit challenging the decision to entomb the
waste at Yucca Mountain, maintained that the Energy Department
violated the 1982 Nuclear Waste Policy Act by resorting to
"engineered barriers" to contain the waste.</LD>
<LD>   In papers filed Monday with the U.S. Court of Appeals in
Washington, the state argued that the Bush administration was
"essentially abandoning" the 1982 law's "mandate that the site's
geology form the primary isolation barrier" in selecting the Yucca
Mountain site for waste burial.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the federal government on Tuesday renewed its motion in
U.S. District Court in Las Vegas to make Nevada turn on the water at
the Yucca Mountain project. The government said it urgently needs
water to provide a sanitation system, drinking water and showers for
workers.</TE>
<TE>   In June, a federal judge refused to order the state to turn on the
water, saying that the government was not in danger of running out of
water, but could return to court if it thought the project was
running low.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it remains to be seen if in fact their needs are urgent,"
said Bob Loux, Nevada's Nuclear Projects Agency chief.</TE>
<TE>   Yucca Mountain is a ridge of volcanic rock and ash 90 miles
northwest of Las Vegas, adjacent to the Nevada Test Site.</TE>
<TE>   Last February, President Bush declared the mountain scientifically
suitable and safe as the nation's central repository for 77,000 tons
of waste from commercial reactors and the government's nuclear weapon
program.</TE>
<TE>   After Nevada challenged the decision, Congress endorsed the
president's declaration in July and overturned what could have been a
veto of the site by Nevada. The Energy Department is seeking a
license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and hopes to open the
waste repository by 2010.</TE>
<TE>   But Nevada, joined by the city of Las Vegas and surrounding Clark
County, has promised to continue the fight in court and filed a
number of lawsuits challenging the project.</TE>
<TE>   In a 100-page filing in support of its lawsuit before the appeals
court, Nevada contended that the 1982 law that directed construction
of a federal nuclear waste repository specifically required that
natural geology at the site "form the primary barrier keeping waste
from people and the environment" over tens of thousands of years.</TE>
<TE>   The suit also argued that the Energy Department conducted a
"flawed environmental review" of the Yucca site, disregarded
procedures required under the law in determining the site's
suitability and failed to assess adequately problems involving the
transportation of waste to the site.</TE>
<TE>   Yucca Mountain initially was chosen because Energy Department
scientists believed it had the geology required to contain the waste.
They later found it did not and adopted a "total system performance"
approach in violation of the 1982 law, the state said in its suit.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the suit said, the project relies extensively on man-made
barriers -- metal alloy waste containers and drip shields, for
example -- to keep waste from escaping.</TE>
<TE>   The Energy Department had no immediate response to the Nevada
court filing.</TE>
<TE>   Nevada officials have made similar arguments repeatedly in public
meetings and in outlining their opposition to the Yucca Mountain
project over the years.</TE>
<TE>   Energy Department officials have maintained that the site complies
fully with the 1982 requirements, that it relies on geology to
contain the waste and that the engineered barriers only provide
additional protection.</TE>
<TE>   Congress declared in 1987 that Yucca Mountain should be the only
site to be considered for nuclear waste disposal. Since then, nearly
$7 billion has been spent on studying the area's geology and
developing a waste package and design.</TE>

<LD>There was a time -- not too long ago, actually -- when trading Eric
Karros would have prompted all kinds of moaning about the Dodgers'
loss of character and identity. Now it's simply a necessary business
move. Nothing more, nothing less.</LD>
<LD>   Sending Karros and Mark Grudzielanek to the Chicago Cubs for Todd
Hundley is an attempt to create payroll flexibility, with an eye
toward the luxury tax. Obviously it's not an attempt to upgrade the
roster. It's about trying to move the big salaries and reduced output
of Karros and Grudzielanek and, surprisingly, finding a taker.</LD>
<LD>   It's about ridding themselves of the combined $15 million Karros
and Grudzielanek will make next season and taking back Hundley's
$6-million contract. Basic math here: $15 million minus $6 million
equals $9 million to spend on free agents or higher salaries through
trades.</LD>
<TE>   This is a great move for General Manager Dan Evans if he completes
Step B and takes advantage of the savings by bringing in someone
else. Jeff Kent and Cliff Floyd come to mind. It would have been nice
if this could have been done in time to get in on the Jim Thome
dealings, but he's off the market after signing a six-year,
$85-million contract with the Philadelphia Phillies.</TE>
<TE>   (For the Cubs it appears to be an update to an old slogan. Now
they can say "Wait till the year after next" -- when they'll be free
of Karros and Grudzielanek's salaries while Hundley still will be
owed $6.5 million.)</TE>
<TE>   For everyone else in Dodgerdom it's simply another sign that we
have comfortably settled into the post-O'Malley era. If this had
happened in 1999, fans would have bemoaned the loss of a team staple.</TE>
<TE>   Karros, the UCLA graduate who hit more home runs than any L.A.
Dodger, was just a Dodger guy. He was a link to the days when the
Dodgers were family-owned and seemed to have a bright future.</TE>
<TE>   Karros, Dave Hansen and Hideo Nomo were the three Dodgers who were
around the last time the team made the playoffs in 1996, and he is
the only one of the three who had been here the entire time since
then.</TE>
<TE>   Karros was the most visible, most quotable player on the team. I
remember one time, after a tough late-summer defeat, the Dodgers had
an on-field auction for charity. Karros came out of the clubhouse,
signed his jersey and met with the bidders to help boost the value of
the bids.</TE>
<TE>   That's why the fans liked him. That and the fact he had a six-year
run when he had 30 home runs and 100 runs batted in five times.</TE>
<TE>   But with his body breaking down and his power disappearing, he
averaged 14 home runs and 68 RBIs the last two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   He was taking up space on the field and the payroll. He didn't
give the Dodgers enough punch in the lineup and he wasn't attractive
trade bait.</TE>
<TE>   Most fans were ready to see him go. The door swung wide open last
month when Karros' agent and the Dodgers struck a deal that would
allow the Dodgers to buy out the automatic vesting option for 2004 if
Karros reached 500 plate appearances. It was an opportunity for him
to play the 2003 season without worrying about a front-office agenda
every time Jim Tracy took him out of a game.</TE>
<TE>   As it stood, he had enough disagreements with Tracy in 2002,
especially after the manager began using Tyler Houston in Karros'
place.</TE>
<TE>   Grudzielanek had his problems with Tracy as well. But mostly he
had problems hitting consistently. He wasn't a gaping hole in the
lineup or in the field, but he didn't do enough positive things
either.</TE>
<TE>   He was a reminder of that rough early period of the Fox era,
during Tom Lasorda's brief stint as general manager in 1998 when he
made a series of moves designed to make the playoffs right then and
there. It didn't work then and it still isn't working four years
later.</TE>
<TE>   Karros always felt like a throwback. Back when there was a dirt
track around the field, not rubber. Back when the vendors sold
Cool-a-Coos and it went without saying that the Dodger Dogs would be
grilled.</TE>
<TE>   At least this high-profile ex-Dodger can expect to be cheered when
he returns to Dodger Stadium. Think about it: Mike Piazza, Raul
Mondesi and Gary Sheffield left a bitter taste with their departures
and all were booed when they came back.</TE>
<TE>   Fans always found it tough to boo Karros, even as he labored
through the last two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't force his way out of town. He didn't blast management.</TE>
<TE>   That's the thing with this trade. No hurt feelings. No emotions.
Merely an accounting procedure.</TE>

<HD>Augusta National Member Resigns</HD>
<DH>Wyman, former CBS chief executive, defects over the lack of
females in the club and is applauded by Woods.</DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The former television executive who is the first known Augusta
National Golf Club member to resign in protest of the club's lack of
female membership has at least one important admirer:</LD>
<LD>   The world's best golfer.</LD>
<LD>   Tiger Woods said Tuesday that former CBS chief executive Thomas H.
Wyman, the first known defector from the exclusive club, should be
applauded for his sincerity.</LD>
<TE>   "You have to admire him for what he did," Woods said at Sherwood
Country Club in Thousand Oaks, where he is the host of the Target
World Challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Wyman, 72, a club member for 25 years, submitted his resignation
from Augusta in a Nov. 27 letter to club chairman Hootie Johnson. In
a broadcast interview Tuesday night, he told CNN's Connie Chung that
it was a decision he'd been "brooding over for several months."</TE>
<TE>   He said the sentiment for change, Johnson's delay in adding a
female member and the questions by "women's groups" about "why the
club has been so out of touch with the times" were contributing
factors.</TE>
<TE>   Before his resignation, Wyman said he exchanged letters with
Johnson and was told the addition of a female member was not
scheduled.</TE>
<TE>   "What once appeared [as] the inevitability of women joining ...
Hootie Johnson has made clear there is no fixed plan," Wyman said.
"The institution is drawing inward."</TE>
<TE>   Wyman, who ran CBS from 1979-86, said he respects the club's right
to assert privacy "unless there are some overriding considerations,
and in this case there are. [Augusta] is a shrine, it's a model, and
its image is being chopped down by the day by policies that are so
far out of touch with today."</TE>
<TE>   Wyman's resignation was first reported Monday in a New York Times
story in which he was quoted calling Augusta's stand on female
membership "pigheaded" and said "a large number of members, at least
50 to 75, who believe it is inevitable that there will be and should
be a woman member."</TE>
<TE>   Those numbers are in stark contrast to an estimate Johnson made in
an interview last month when he said "99%" of the about 300 club
members agreed with Augusta's membership policy.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson was not available for comment Tuesday. Augusta National
officials said Wyman's move would not sway the club's position to
admit women members in its own time. In a brief written statement,
the club stated its intention to "stand firm" and expressed
disappointment "that Mr. Wyman has chosen to publicize a private
matter."</TE>
<TE>   Augusta National does not have exclusionary policies, but the fact
that it has no female member has been a hot topic since June, when
Martha Burk, head of the National Council of Women's Organizations,
sent Johnson a letter urging the club to move quickly toward
admitting a female member.</TE>
<TE>   Wyman said he would encourage active corporate leaders who are
Augusta National members to break their silence on the matter and
demand a change. "My hope and expectation is that ... the good ol'
boys club will join the 21st century," he told Chung.</TE>
<TE>   He compared the need for a female member to the 1990 addition of a
first black member at Augusta National. "The parallel with the
situation is absolute," Wyman said. "We were forced to invite members
[and] it was done quickly and gracefully. It could be done precisely
the same way with the women."</TE>
<TE>   Around Augusta, callers to an afternoon radio show did not mince
words in bidding good riddance to Wyman's membership. Some called to
say that any member who speaks publicly should be expelled. Others
suggested their own female candidates -- including Anna Nicole Smith
and RuPaul -- who might be admitted in order to best anger feminist
protesters.</TE>
<TE>   Standing outside the banquet hall he owns across the street from
the club's entrance, Terry Wick seemed baffled.</TE>
<TE>   "To just drop your membership?" he said. "That's a slap in the
face to Augusta."</TE>
<TE>   Back in Thousand Oaks, Woods reaffirmed his position that he
believes a woman should be invited to join the club, but that he does
not have a vote in the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Wyman has called upon both Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus to
publicly support the campaign for Augusta to admit a woman member.</TE>
<TE>   Burk said she respected Wyman for mentioning Palmer and Nicklaus,
adding, "It's time somebody challenged these people besides the NCWO.
And Tim Finchem and the [PGA] Tour are still the biggest hypocrites
in the mix."</TE>
<TE>   The PGA Tour has a policy not to stage events at clubs that
discriminate, but says it has no contractual deal with Augusta
National.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer, who was at his home near Orlando, Fla., refused to comment
through a spokesman. However, he said recently that he was unsure
what his role would be. "I don't think I can lend anything to help
the situation," Palmer said.</TE>
<TE>   Nicklaus was traveling and unavailable for comment, according to a
spokesman for Golden Bear International.</TE>
<TE>   However, the spokesman released a statement from Nicklaus.</TE>
<TE>   "I sympathize greatly with it ... " Nicklaus said in the
statement. "But it is not my deal."</TE>
<TE>   Wyman's action was significant because of his long association
with Augusta National as well as his connection with CBS, according
to Burk.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a strong memo that 'Guys, you're not doing it right' and
'We wouldn't do this under my watch,' " she said.</TE>
<TE>   CBS sources say the network has no plans to change course
regarding its broadcast of the Masters and insiders said they do not
view Wyman's resignation from the club as turning up the heat on the
debate. A network spokesperson said, "CBS will broadcast the Masters
in April" and declined to further comment.</TE>
<TE>   Media consultant Neal Pilson, a former president of CBS Sports,
said that even if the network wanted to pressure Augusta into
considering a female member, it can't.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no leverage here," he said. "CBS doesn't have a position
that would allow it to get involved in this controversy. They have a
one-year rights deal and, in my view, there would be no difficulty
with the Masters finding another network to cover the event."</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the reaction CBS has received over this, Pilson said:
"I'll only confirm they're not getting any phone calls. There's no
public outcry here. And I don't believe their affiliate stations are
getting any pressure."</TE>
<TE>   Pilson described Wyman, whom he worked for in the early 1980s, as
"an excellent athlete" who, by definition, is a 15-handicap or less
golfer, because that's a requirement for membership.</TE>
<TE>   "I know he was proud of his membership," Pilson said. "He was a
member during a period of time he was chairman at CBS. He probably
played three or four times a year, which is about what the members
do."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Aisner, a spokesman for Harvard Business School, where Wyman
is a visiting scholar, described him as a "fine gentleman from the
old school, a classic chief executive raised from the old-school path
of where they come: [a private academy in] Andover (Mass.), Amherst
(Mass.) College. And he was a Phi Beta Kappa."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Delphi, the mobile electronics and transportation
component technology company in which Wyman served as a lead director
from 1999 until his March retirement, said Wyman's detachment from a
corporation illustrates the sincerity behind his resignation.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it attests to the genuineness of his motives," Delphi's
Steven Gaut said.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup chief executive Sanford Weill and U.S. Olympic Committee
chief executive Lloyd Ward, Augusta National members who've publicly
called for the club to add a female member, refused to comment on
Wyman's resignation.</TE>

<HD>White Sox Get Koch in Trade</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Oakland Athletics sent closer Billy Koch to the Chicago White Sox
in a six-player trade Tuesday, dumping a big salary with an eye
toward future payrolls.</LD>
<LD>   "My initial reaction was, 'What's a guy got to do to stay with the
team?' " said Koch, who was traded to Oakland by Toronto last
December. "It's sort of frustrating, but then you turn around and
look at it as a new start."</LD>
<LD>   In exchange for Koch and two minor leaguers, the Athletics got
White Sox closer Keith Foulke, catcher Mark Johnson, minor league
right-hander Joe Valentine and cash.</LD>
<TE>   The deal is a financial wash for the A's next season because of
the cash from Chicago, but it allows Oakland to free up money in the
future.</TE>
<TE>   Koch had a $2.35 million base salary last season and made $150,000
in performance bonuses.</TE>
<TE>   Eligible for salary arbitration for the next three seasons, Koch
is expected to see his salary double this winter and go up even more
in future years.</TE>
<TE>   Foulke is due $6 million next season but then becomes eligible for
free agency.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at our payroll after this year and the forecast for
where Billy's salary is going to go, it's unrealistic to believe we
could have held onto him," Oakland General Manager Billy Beane said.</TE>
<TE>   Koch, 27, has emerged as one of the American League's top closers,
becoming the first to start his career with four consecutive 30-save
seasons.</TE>
<TE>   He had an 11-4 record with 44 saves in 50 save opportunities last
season. His 11 victories were tops among major league relievers, and
he led the AL with 84 appearances. Only Minnesota's Eddie Guardado
had more saves in the AL, with 45.</TE>
<TE>   In four seasons, Koch is 22-17 with 144 saves and a 3.48
earned-run average.</TE>
<TE>   Foulke saved a career-high 42 games in 2001 and ranks third on the
White Sox saves list, but he struggled last season and lost his
closer role in early June. He went from June 27 to Sept. 17 without a
save, and finished with 11. He was 2-4 with a 2.90 ERA.</TE>
<TE>   Foulke did regain some of his old form at the end of the season,
not giving up an earned run in his last 17 2/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   First baseman Jim Thome, fighting back tears, said the desire to
win caused him to leave Cleveland and sign with the Philadelphia
Phillies.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, everyone knew my ties in Cleveland. And this was a
very, very difficult decision," Thome, 32, said at a news conference.
"It comes down to winning. It really does."</TE>
<TE>   The Phillies, unwilling to spend money in the past, are
aggressively trying to improve as they prepare to move into their new
ballpark in 2004. They agreed to a $17-million, four-year contract
with third baseman David Bell on Nov. 24. Philadelphia also has a
$30-million, three-year offer out to free-agent left-hander Tom
Glavine, a two-time NL Cy Young Award winner.</TE>
<TE>   The Phillies sold 240 season tickets Monday and 480 Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Among fans, Manager Larry Bowa said, "this is the most excitement
I've seen since Pete Rose came here as a player." Rose joined the
Phillies in 1979 and helped them win the World Series in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As expected, left-handed reliever Mike Remlinger finalized a
$10.65-million, three-year contract with the Chicago Cubs, who are
hoping he will bolster a bullpen that squandered 25 saves last
season.</TE>
<TE>   Remlinger was 7-3 with a 1.99 ERA in 73 games with the Atlanta
Braves last season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Japanese outfielder Hideki Matsui, who had planned to negotiate a
major league contract without an agent, is expected to hire Arn
Tellem to represent him.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't signed a contract yet, but we basically have an
agreement," Matsui said.</TE>
<TE>   Tellem, based in Santa Monica, is part of a group headed by Randy
Hendricks.</TE>
<TE>   Matsui, 28, said three major league teams have expressed interest
in talking to him -- the New York Yankees, Baltimore Orioles and
Boston Red Sox.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Narron, fired as manager of the Texas Rangers after last
season, was hired as bench coach of the Red Sox.</TE>

<LD>Nikki Blue is five games into her UCLA career, and she's already
showing why she was one of the most highly touted recruits.</LD>
<LD>   On a night when the Bruins looked listless, Blue scored all of her
24 points in the second half, including the Bruins' last nine to lift
UCLA to a 72-60 victory over St. Mary's before 728 Tuesday at Pauley
Pavilion.</LD>
<LD>   The freshman guard made nine of 11 shots in the second half after
missing all three shots in the first half. The 24 points matched her
season high against Cal State Sacramento.</LD>
<TE>   "I try to let the game come to me," said Blue, who also four
rebounds and six turnovers. "But I don't like sitting on the bench.
And I know if I didn't step up I would have been sitting on the
bench."</TE>
<TE>   Julia Pitts, another touted freshman, had 10 points and eight
rebounds for the Bruins (4-1).</TE>
<TE>   Triola Jackson had 18 for the Gaels (2-3).</TE>
<TE>   Appearing fatigued by a weekend tournament in Las Vegas, the
sluggish Bruins made nine of 32 shots in the first half (28.1%), and
missed all six of their three-point attempts.</TE>
<TE>   St. Mary's didn't take full advantage though, making 12 of 33
shots (36.4%). The Gaels did make five three-pointers for a 32-23
halftime lead.</TE>

<LD>Tonya Harding plans to make her professional boxing debut on the
undercard for the Mike Tyson-Clifford Etienne fight on Feb. 22.</LD>
<LD>   "It is my goal to be a future, undisputed bantamweight champion,"
Harding said. "My proven athletic ability and competitive nature will

<TE>   Daily shot: The Lakers have become the butt of jokes on late-night
television. Here's the latest from Leno:</TE>
<TE>   "Michael Jordan has announced that he will retire at the end of
the season -- as opposed to the Lakers having retired at the start of
the season."</TE>
<TE>   New role: Jordan had said he was going to turn over the reins of
the Washington Wizards to the team's younger players, but after a
four-game losing streak, he started and played 37 minutes in a 95-94
loss to the Philadelphia 76ers.</TE>

was willing to be a role player this season, we could have guessed
what kind of role: Emperor."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: What is the individual record for points scored in a
women's college basketball game?</TE>
<TE>   Confusion abounds: It's not easy figuring out which college
football teams are going to which bowl games.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Kawakami in the San Jose Mercury News: "I remain unsure which
teams are bowl-eligible, BCS-qualified, sponge-worthy,
Nielsen-friendly or FDIC-insured."</TE>
<TE>   Ad-libbing: Gary Owens recalls that he and Chick Hearn were hired
as the announcers for the car race in the 1969 hit Disney movie, "The
Love Bug," featuring a Volkswagen bug named Herbie.</TE>
<TE>   "When I said, as the script required, 'Herbie has got a mind of
his own,' Chick, instead of saying what he was supposed to say, came
back with, 'Just like Wilt Chamberlain,' " Owens said.</TE>
<TE>   Angel fan:  American League Cy Young Award winner Barry Zito of
the Oakland Athletics, appearing on Fox Sports Net's "The Paperboys,"
was asked about the Angels winning the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's great for SoCal," he said. "If I wasn't on the A's,
I'd be rooting for them."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: The record is 60 points by Cindy Brown of Long
Beach State in 1987 against San Jose State.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Jeremy Shockey, the New York Giants' rookie tight
end, was asked by CBS' Deion Sanders how it came about that he became
the NFL's marketing version of Anna Kournikova.</TE>
<TE>   Shockey and Kournikova were recently featured together in a
back-page layout in the New York Daily News.</TE>
<TE>   "Our marketing guy was talking to a newspaper guy," Shockey said,
"and the newspapers here are all tabloids, which means whatever you
read is 50% true. The guy said, 'You market him with techniques like
Anna Kournikova gets marketed.' And the guy blew it all out of
proportion, saying that I want to be the 'Anna Kournikova of
football.' "</TE>
<TE>   Shockey apparently wasn't pleased.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I'm definitely cuter than her," he said.</TE>

<HD>Indiana Puts Away Maryland</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Indiana needed a third chance to finally beat Maryland.</LD>
<LD>   Eight months after losing to the Terrapins in the national
championship game and minutes after having a potential game-winning
midcourt heave by Steve Blake waved off, the 10th-ranked Hoosiers
beat No. 9 Maryland, 80-74, in overtime on Tuesday night in the
ACC-Big Ten Challenge at Indianapolis.</LD>
<LD>   For much of the game, it looked like a replay of April's
championship. Indiana relied on its outside shooting and struggled.
Maryland (4-1) again went with its inside power.</LD>
<TE>   But this time Hoosier guard Tom Coverdale was sound. Coverdale,
who scored only eight points after being hobbled by a badly sprained
left ankle in April, matched his career-high with 30 points in
leading the Hoosiers (5-0) back from a 14-point first-half deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Blake had 22 points for Maryland and Ryan Randle had 20.</TE>
<TE>   No. 1 Arizona 91, Saint Louis 58 -- Jason Gardner made four of six
three-pointers and scored 16 points to lead the Wildcats (3-0) over
the Billikens (1-3) at Tucson.</TE>
<TE>   Gardner, one of three senior starters and a preseason
All-American, has made 11 of 17 threes in the first three games for
Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   No. 3 Alabama 89, North Carolina Greenboro 61 -- Erwin Dudley had
18 points, Kenny Walker had 17 and Mo Williams had 13 points and
seven assists as the Crimson Tide (5-0) defeated the Spartans (3-2)
at Tuscaloosa, Ala.</TE>
<TE>   Alabama tied a 31-year-old school mark with its 22nd consecutive
home win. Nine Crimson Tide players scored at least five points.</TE>
<TE>   No. 4 Duke 91, Ohio State 76 -- Freshman J.J. Redick scored 20
points for the second straight game to lead the Blue Devils (4-0)
over the Buckeyes (1-2) in the ACC-Big Ten Challenge at Greensboro,
N.C.</TE>
<TE>   Redick, who had 20 last Saturday against UCLA, made three
three-pointers in the opening 8:40 of the second half.</TE>
<TE>   No. 5 Pittsburgh 96, Norfolk State 51 -- Julius Page scored 16
points to lead the Panthers (4-0) over the Spartans (1-2) at
Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   Chevon Troutman had 14 points and Ontario Lett and Donatas
Zavackas each scored 13 for Pittsburgh, which led by as many as 39
points in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   West Virginia 68, No. 8 Florida 66 -- Freshman Joe Herber made the
go-ahead basket with 50 seconds left as the Mountaineers (3-1)
overcame a nine-point deficit in the second half to defeat the Gators
(4-2) at Charleston, W.Va.</TE>
<TE>   Drew Schifino scored 16 points and Herber had 11 for West
Virginia, which defeated a ranked opponent for the first time in six
tries.</TE>
<TE>   No. 11 Connecticut 116, Sacred Heart 78 -- Ben Gordon had career
highs with 31 points and 10 assists, and Emeka Okafor had his fourth
straight double-double to lead the Huskies (4-0) over the Pioneers
(0-4) at Storrs, Conn.</TE>
<TE>   Okafor had 19 points and 14 rebounds for UConn.</TE>
<TE>   No. 25 Illinois 92, No. 12 North Carolina 65 -- Brian Cook scored
22 points and Sean Harrington had a career-high 20 at Champaign,
Ill., as the Fighting Illini (4-0) handed the Tar Heels (5-1) their
first loss. Harrington was six of eight from three-point range.</TE>
<TE>   No. 16 Xavier 74, Purdue 59 -- Lionel Chalmers scored 24 points
and David West had 18 to lead the Musketeers (3-1) over the
Boilermakers (2-1) at Cincinnati. Willie Deane scored 21 points for
Purdue.</TE>
<TE>   No. 18 Kentucky 84, High Point 64 -- Keith Bogans scored 21 points
and Gerald Fitch had 18 points and six assists to lead the Wildcats
(3-1) over the Panthers (2-2) at Lexington, Ky. Kentucky shot 63%
from the field.</TE>

<HD>Odom Finally Practices</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lamar Odom finally left the sidelines Tuesday at Los Angeles
Southwest College, practicing with the Clippers for the first time in
almost 11 months. He participated in many of the drills, moving at
about 60% of full speed on his injured right ankle.</LD>
<LD>   "I feel like I just took a step forward," said Odom, a small
forward who hasn't played since he was placed on the injured list
Jan. 24 because of a sprained right wrist. While he was
rehabilitating his wrist, Odom stepped on a stray basketball Feb. 14
while attempting a dunk and sprained his ankle. He re-injured his
ankle during the off-season and it was placed in a hard cast Aug. 26.
His wrist has been sound for several weeks.</LD>
<LD>   "I can see a light at the end of the tunnel," he said.</LD>
<TE>   For once, it doesn't appear to be a train speeding toward him.</TE>
<TE>   "With a couple more practices like this one I should be better,"
said Odom, who averaged 13.1 points, 6.1 rebounds and 5.9 assists
despite playing only 29 games last season because of the wrist and
ankle injuries plus an eight-game drug suspension. "It doesn't react
right yet. I've got to tell it what to do. 'Move. Go that way.'
There's still some swelling."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers, determined to be cautious, are eager to see how
Odom's ankle responds today. The target date for his return remains
Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm getting ready to get back to what I do," he said. "That's
playing basketball. I feel like I'm part of a team again. I get
through this and I'll get through anything."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Alvin Gentry seemed pleased enough to see Odom on the floor.
But Gentry cautioned against expecting too much too soon from Odom,
who averaged 17.2 points, 7.8 rebounds and 5.2 assists in 76 games in
2000-01.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, he's not in midseason form, but it's a start," Gentry
said. "When you're out that long, it's going to take a while to get
back. It's taking Shaq [O'Neal, Laker center,] a while to get back,
and he's the best player in the league by far. [Odom] is in the
preliminary stages right now. He's doing drills and running through
some plays."</TE>

<HD>Karros Is Too Much of a Luxury</HD>
<DH>Deal to send first baseman and Grudzielanek to Cubs for
Hundley could be finalized today. Dodgers may go after Kent or Floyd.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jason Reid</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dodgers' efforts to trade first baseman Eric Karros and second
baseman Mark Grudzielanek appeared to have paid off Tuesday as the
club reached a tentative agreement with the Chicago Cubs to reacquire
catcher Todd Hundley in a multiplayer deal, creating payroll and
roster flexibility the Dodgers could use to pursue free agents Jeff
Kent or Cliff Floyd.</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers and Cubs had 72 hours to finalize the trade that
baseball sources said was temporarily delayed while agent Seth
Levinson, who represents Hundley and Grudzielanek, addressed
contractual issues with the clubs. The Dodgers also would receive
another major leaguer and send cash to the Cubs as part of the
transaction that could be completed as early as today, said a source
involved in negotiations.</LD>
<LD>   "It's our policy to never comment regarding discussions we're
having with any club, and we have had discussions with every club,"
General Manager Dan Evans said.</LD>
<TE>   "We're always looking for ways to improve the team and that's all
I'll say."</TE>
<TE>   Karros, a Dodger his entire professional career, was disturbed by
news of the impending trade, instructing agent Jeff Moorad to speak
on his behalf.</TE>
<TE>   "It was Eric's hope and his desire, and still is his hope in the
unlikely event this trade falls through, that he would be able to
finish his career as an L.A. Dodger," Moorad said of the 1992
National League rookie of the year. "If this trade becomes a reality
as we expect, he would certainly have a sense of disappointment."</TE>
<TE>   Dodger officials have bemoaned their inability to make moves
because of the roster and payroll mistakes of the former regime. The
Dodgers did not expect to be a factor in this winter's free-agent
market because they had $95 million committed to 12 players, not
including those eligible for arbitration, and were concerned about
exceeding next season's luxury-tax threshold of $117 million.</TE>
<TE>   Evans aggressively pursued deals to move Karros, rehabilitating
from arthroscopic shoulder surgery and coming off consecutive poor
seasons, and Grudzielanek because their salaries have contributed to
the Dodgers' payroll constraints. The Dodgers also have been
dissatisfied with the production of the outspoken veterans, who
frequently clashed with Manager Jim Tracy while questioning how he
handled the club last season, team sources said.</TE>
<TE>   With Karros and Grudzielanek gone, Evans and his staff plan to
reinvest in the team the $15 million guaranteed to those players
under the final years of their contracts, a Dodger official said. The
Dodgers want to bolster the batting order, hoping to provide a
right-handed counterpart for left-handed slugger Shawn Green, and
Kent could fill their need.</TE>
<TE>   Evans declined comment on whether the club is pursuing Kent -- the
2000 NL most valuable player -- but a Dodger official acknowledged
that the club plans to explore many options at first with the money
available once the deal is finalized. Although Kent, who helped the
San Francisco Giants win the 2002 pennant, has primarily played
second throughout his career, he can play first.</TE>
<TE>   The left-handed-batting Floyd, who played for Tracy in the
Montreal Expos' farm system, also is on the Dodgers' list. Whether
the Dodgers pursue those avenues or go in another direction, trading
Karros and Grudzielanek is the key.</TE>
<TE>   Karros, 35, is owed $8 million in 2003. His contract includes a
2004 option for $9 million, or a $1-million buyout, which would vest
if he reaches 500 plate appearances next season. Grudzielanek, 32,
has a $5.5-million salary in the last guaranteed year of his deal. A
club option for $6 million in 2004 could be bought out for $500,000.</TE>
<TE>   Hundley, 33, who played for the Dodgers from 1999-2000, has a
salary of $6 million next season and $6.5 million in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   In 573 plate appearances last season, Karros batted .271 with a
career-low 13 home runs and 73 runs batted. In 2001, he had a
career-worst .235 average in 487 plate appearances while playing with
a torn lower-back muscle.</TE>
<TE>   The Cubs are excited about prospect Hee Seop Choi, 23, expected to
relegate Karros to a backup role for the first time in his 12-year
career.</TE>
<TE>   As a player with at least 10 years in the major leagues and five
with one team, Karros could reject a trade and block the deal.
However, Karros promised Chairman Bob Daly he wouldn't exercise that
right while negotiating a three-year, $24-million contract extension
in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be frank about this: There was a point during the day when
we talked about the possibility of shifting gears on that issue,"
Moorad said. "In the end, Eric chose to stand by the commitment and
honor his word to Bob Daly."</TE>
<TE>   Grudzielanek failed to fulfill the Dodgers' expectations after
signing a four-year, $18-million contract in 2000. He batted a
team-high .326 in 1999 in establishing a franchise record for
shortstops but has batted no higher than .279 the last three seasons
since being moved to second.</TE>
<TE>   If Grudzielanek remains with the Cubs, he could be behind Bobby
Hill, who struggled as a rookie last season but finished strong. The
Dodgers have many options at second, including Alex Cora and prospect
Joe Thurston.</TE>
<TE>   To say the least, the return of Hundley to the Dodgers was
unexpected. The Cubs were as eager to get rid of Hundley as the
Dodgers were to trade Karros and Grudzielanek. Hundley's first stint
with the Dodgers was marked by injuries and ineffectiveness and the
club did not offer him arbitration, receiving no draft-pick
compensation for the player they acquired from the New York Mets in
1998 for Gold Glove catcher Charles Johnson and outfielder Roger
Cedeno.</TE>
<TE>   Hundley didn't enjoy his first tour of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the most laid-back town I've ever played in, and that kind
of drags you down, forces you to adjust," he said in February 2001.
"The Dodgers draw big crowds, but most come in the third inning and
leave in the sixth and really don't care as long as they're seen. The
die-hards are out in the bleachers or up in the top deck."</TE>
<TE>   Hundley struggled after signing a four-year, $23.5-million
contract with the Cubs, hitting only 28 homers with 66 RBIs the last
two seasons. The Cubs traded for two catchers this off-season after
the switch-hitter batted .211 with 16 home runs and 35 RBIs in 2002.
Hundley is expected to be the No. 2 catcher behind Paul Lo Duca and
occasionally play first.</TE>

<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>In an attempt to give forward Alexei Smirnov more game experience,
the Mighty Ducks assigned the rookie to Cincinnati of the American
Hockey League on Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "He'll get to play seven games in the next 10 days," Coach Mike
Babcock said about Smirnov, who has one goal in 18 games with the
Ducks. "A year ago, [Detroit defenseman] Jiri Fischer did the same
thing and he ended up playing in the Stanley Cup [as one of the Red
Wings' top four defensemen]."</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Rookie winger Jonathan Hedstrom, recalled from Cincinnati to
replace Smirnov, made his NHL debut Tuesday, skating on the fourth
line with Marc Chouinard and Mike Brown.... Defenseman Ruslan Salei
returned to the lineup after sitting out two games because of a
back/abdominal injury, but aggravated the injury late in the first
period. He's listed as day to day.... Defenseman Fredrik Olausson,
who played for Detroit last season, picked up his Stanley Cup ring
Tuesday morning.</TE>

<HD>This Loss Leaves Bad Taste</HD>
<DH>Ducks outplay and outshoot Red Wings, but goaltender
Giguere is stung by two soft goals in 2-1 defeat.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>The Mighty Ducks sure let one get away Tuesday night.</LD>
<LD>   Despite outshooting the Red Wings, 30-27, and dominating much of
the third period, the Ducks lost, 2-1, to the defending Stanley Cup
champions because of two gift-wrapped goals they gave up in front of
20,058 at Joe Louis Arena.</LD>
<LD>   "We stuck to our game plan and tried to work through the bad goals
but it just wasn't enough," Duck defenseman Keith Carney said.</LD>
<TE>   Duck goaltender Jean-Sebastien Giguere was solid all night except
for two bizarre plays that led to goals for the Red Wings, who have
won all three of their games against the Ducks this season.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Wings fired 14 shots on goal in the opening period, led by
Brendan Shanahan's six and Brett Hull's four. But for much of the
period, Giguere was up to the challenge until giving up a weak
unassisted goal to Detroit's Sean Avery.</TE>
<TE>   With less than three minutes remaining in the first period, Avery
retrieved a loose puck near the end boards in the Duck zone and fired
a deflected shot toward the left post. Giguere was not caught off
guard by the shot but lost sight of the puck, which squeezed into the
net.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit took a 2-0 lead early in the second period on another bad
goal.</TE>
<TE>   Winger Henrik Zetterberg got the play started for the Red Wings
when he sent a deflected pass to the front of the net, which seemed
to be an easy play for Giguere. But as the puck rolled to the left
side of the slot, Giguere had trouble gaining control in order to
stop play and Hull slapped the puck into the net for his 10th goal at
2:19.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very frustrating," Giguere said. "I felt great tonight and
was seeing the puck very good and thought I was making some good
saves."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks, who had a four-game unbeaten streak stopped and
suffered only their second loss in regulation since Nov. 3, got back
into the game late in the second on a power-play goal from Paul
Kariya.</TE>
<TE>   With Shanahan in the penalty box, the Ducks made their first
man-advantage situation count. With Steve Rucchin providing traffic
in front of the net, Kariya was able to pick up a rebound at the
right circle and beat Detroit goaltender Curtis Joseph at 16:20 for
his 12th goal, cutting the Red Wing lead to 2-1.</TE>
<TE>   But that was as close as the Ducks would get, even though they
outshot the Red Wings, 11-6, over the final 20 minutes and had three
power-play opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   For Coach Mike Babcock, the defeat was disappointing but
considering that the Ducks were outshot, 45-26, in an overtime loss
the last time they were in Detroit, Tuesday's effort was a major
improvement.</TE>
<TE>   "You come in here and feel the aura of the Stanley Cup champions
... but you have to go after them," Babcock said. "Don't get me
wrong. I'd like a lot of their autographs too. But the reality is
that you have to make them play.</TE>
<TE>   "We gave them two goals and that frustrates you.... We've improved
a lot as a team and you'd like to see us find a way to get that one
tonight."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks, who are a game above .500, hope to start a new streak.</TE>
<TE>   "We expect success now," Carney said. "We're comfortable on the
road where we can come into buildings like Detroit and believe that
we'll come away with at least a point."</TE>

<HD>Nothing Silly About Money</HD>
<DH>Woods and others clean up in off-season, and next stop is
at Sherwood Country Club.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas Bonk</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two weeks ago, Tiger Woods played a tournament in Japan and made
$49,673, in addition to his appearance fee, which normally runs $1
million. Then he played the PGA Grand Slam in Hawaii, where he made
$400,000. From there, it was on to the Skins Game in Indio, where he
won $125,000.</LD>
<LD>   This week, he plays host to the $3.8-million Target World
Challenge, which he won a year ago to earn $1 million at Sherwood
Country Club, where there are only 16 players and last place is worth
$130,000.</LD>
<LD>   Do the math. Even if he finishes last, and this is not the way to
bet, Woods will have made $1.7 million in a little more than three
weeks.</LD>
<TE>   What does all this mean?</TE>
<TE>   'Tis the season to make money.</TE>
<TE>   It used to be called the "silly season," but that's no longer an
accurate name because there are some serious piles of cash stacked
high.</TE>
<TE>   Pro golf's off-season is now a global fiesta of
multimillion-dollar events with virtually nothing at stake except
some very nice, low-pressure paydays.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like you are grinding it out in a major championship,"
Woods said. "The season's over. We all know that. This whole thing
started with the Skins Game 20 years ago and a lot of events have
blossomed, a lot of events have come and gone. But it's great to have
tournaments like that."</TE>
<TE>   As well as Woods has done in the off-season, he isn't even the
leading moneymaker. That would be Ernie Els, who isn't here, but is
probably figuring out how to spend the $2 million he made last week
when he won the $4.06-million Nedbank Golf Challenge in Sun City,
South Africa.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is Mark O'Meara, who needs electronic deposits. After
making $85,000 in the $2.25-million Franklin Templeton Shootout in
Florida, O'Meara hit the jackpot over the weekend at the Skins Game
when he won $405,000. O'Meara, one of four players invited by Woods
to play at Sherwood, is guaranteed a minimum of $130,000 for a nice
early Christmas present.</TE>
<TE>   Colin Montgomerie, Bernhard Langer and Rich Beem also received
invitations to join the rest of the field, which got in through the
Official World Rankings.</TE>
<TE>   Montgomerie made $300,000 at Sun City and Beem's off-season so far
has included visits to the Hyundai Team Matches at Dana Point
($50,000) and the PGA Grand Slam at Kauai ($150,000).</TE>
<TE>   If you're keeping score along with the accountants, the top
off-season moneymakers in the field this week are Woods ($525,000),
O'Meara ($490,000), Montgomerie and Phil Mickelson ($300,000) and
Chris DiMarco ($250,000). Fred Couples has made $255,000 from the
Shootout, the Hyundai and the Skins Game, but he is playing only in
the pro-am this week.</TE>
<TE>   The business plan is straightforward and lucrative. There are as
many as a dozen off-season events scheduled worldwide between the
Tour Championship and the week before Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   As official host of the Target Challenge, the second-richest
off-season event, Woods deftly plays the part. This year, he has made
$7.9 million worldwide, $6.9 million of that on the PGA Tour. In his
career, Woods' worldwide earnings are $40.7 million -- and he is
completing only his sixth full year as a professional.</TE>
<TE>   By the way, Woods donated his $1-million winner's share to his
foundation last year and says he'll hand over his winnings this year
as well.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HARTFORD, Conn.</DL>
<LD>Suzy Whaley has two young daughters who like to mimic her swing on
the golf course. She may soon be a role model for many other girls.</LD>
<LD>   The 36-year-old golf pro has accepted an invitation to play in the
Greater Hartford Open, a decision that will make her the first woman
to play in a PGA Tour event.</LD>
<LD>   Whaley qualified for the GHO by winning the PGA Connecticut
Sectional in September.</LD>
<TE>   "I took a long time to make this decision," Whaley said Tuesday.
"I understand the historical implications of this decision, and the
importance it has for women golfers."</TE>
<TE>   In the qualifier, when she shot a one-under-par 71 in the final
round to win the tournament, Whaley hit from tees about 10% shorter
than the men's.</TE>
<TE>   She will have to play from the same tees as the men at the Greater
Hartford Open, adding about 700 yards to her game.</TE>

<HD>Pick-Six Player to File Class-Action Suit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Christine</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former Hollywood actor and stuntman, who left those professions to
become a devoted pick-six horseplayer in California in the 1980s, is
filing a class-action lawsuit against the tote company responsible
for processing the fraudulent pick-six bets at the Breeders' Cup in
October.</LD>
<LD>   A spokesman for the Pasadena law firm that represents the bettor,
Jimmy "the Hat" Allard, said that the suit would be filed today in
Los Angeles Superior Court. The defendant is Autotote Systems Inc.,
which processed the six winning tickets -- worth more than $3 million
-- on the Breeders' Cup at Arlington Park. The money was not paid
after Autotote discovered that one of its employees had been
rewriting tickets to match the results after four of the six races
had been run. The employee, Chris Harn, a senior computer programmer,
was fired and has pleaded guilty to two conspiracy charges in
connection with the scam. Two of his former college fraternity
brothers have also been charged and are scheduled for a court
appearance next Wednesday in New York.</LD>
<LD>   Allard, 48, reportedly is a shareholder in some of 78 consolation
tickets that are worth about $4,600 each but will grow by about
$39,000 apiece if the $3 million from the winning pick-six tickets is
redistributed. The consolation-ticket holders picked five of the six
race winners.</LD>
<TE>   "This is the ultimate example of technology going amok," Allard
was quoted as saying by a friend. "The Breeders' Cup was only the tip
of the iceberg. This has been going on for a long time. In the last
three to five years, there were some things that just out and out
smelled, and while I was suspicious, it wasn't anything I could
really put my finger on."</TE>
<TE>   The National Thoroughbred Racing Assn., facing widespread erosion
in horseplayer confidence, is conducting a review of almost 500 pick
sixes and pick fours that paid $10,000 or more per winning ticket
this year.</TE>
<TE>   According to Harn's guilty plea, he and his partners, operating
much as they had on Breeders' Cup day, also cashed an earlier
$107,608 pick six at Belmont Park and a $1,757 pick four at Balmoral
Park. Harn also said that they'd pulled off a ticket-counterfeiting
scheme at five Eastern tracks that reaped almost $100,000.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Joseph Lisoni, Allard's lawyer, said that
Autotote, the biggest handler of horseracing bets in the country,
would be charged with negligence. According to Lisoni's statement,
the suit will allege that through the manipulation of the company's
software, bettors "may have been cheated out of countless millions of
dollars for possibly the last eight years."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Lisoni said that he expected other pick-six
players to join the suit.</TE>
<TE>   An Autotote spokesman said that the company would have no
immediate comment.</TE>
<TE>   "The suit hasn't been filed yet, and we haven't seen it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The $3 million in question has been deposited by Arlington Park to
an escrow account at a Chicago bank. The Illinois Racing Board is
expected to review the situation Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Allard is said to be part of a group that bets the pick six every
day at the Southern California tracks. He has said that he has
invested more than $20 million in the pick six since 1986, and has
cashed the bet more than 200 times, including three worth more than
$1 million apiece.</TE>
<TE>   A native of Rochester, N.Y., Allard moved to Los Angeles in 1974.
He has said that he worked as an extra and stuntman in more than 500
television shows and movies, among them "Love Boat," "Happy Days" and
"Fantasy Island" on TV and the movies "Airplane!" and "The Blues
Brothers."</TE>
<TE>   One of the shortcomings of the Autotote system, which surprised
industry officials and many seasoned bettors when they learned of it
after the Breeders' Cup, was that the tote company stored pick-six
bets in its system in Newark, Del., until as many as four races had
been run. Brooks Pierce, president of Autotote, said at a California
Horse Racing Board meeting last month that his company would soon be
scanning the bets after the first leg had been run.</TE>
<TE>   "Autotote is undercapitalized to make many improvements," said
Donald Groth, president of the Catskill Off-Track Betting Corp. in
New York, where the fraudulent winning bets in the Breeders' Cup were
made. "Their costs have continued to go up, which is the result of
aggressive negotiating by the tracks that they do business with."</TE>
<TE>   Asked recently about this, Pierce said that executives at
Scientific Games Corp., Autotote's parent company, would be better
qualified to answer the question. A. Lorne Weil, chairman of
Scientific Games, has declined to return several calls.</TE>
<TE>   The Breeders' Cup scam was discovered Oct. 27, the day after the
Arlington Park races, by some alert executives at the New York Racing
Assn., which this week uncovered a small scam closer to home. One of
NYRA's three tracks, Aqueduct, fired and filed theft charges against
a security guard who had stolen promotional mutuel vouchers from the
track's mailroom.</TE>
<TE>   Vouchers, good for bets or cash, between $2 and $10,000 were
mailed to 43,000 fans, and the guard attempted to cash tickets from
30-40 of the mailers that were returned, addressees unknown. He was
caught when one of those vouchers was for $10,000, the biggest prize
in the promotion. The Breeders' Cup scam might have also gone
undetected but for a similar situation: The six winning tickets --
all made by bets on the same telephone account -- cried for an
investigation after Volponi, a 43-1 longshot, won the last race.</TE>

<HD>Miller Passes the Muster for Venice</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Stephens</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Receivers B.J. Vickers and Antwuan Giddens are large and physical
targets who give the Venice football team big-play potential on
nearly every down.</LD>
<LD>   But neither throws the ball to the other. It's Eddie Miller's job
to get it to them, and the Gondolier signal-caller does it with
amazing proficiency.</LD>
<LD>   Miller has thrown for a City Section-best 3,665 yards and 32
touchdowns, leading fourth-seeded Venice into a semifinal showdown
against top-seeded Woodland Hills Taft on Friday night.</LD>
<TE>   It is the Gondoliers' first appearance in a Championship Division
semifinal, and the senior is eagerly awaiting a matchup between the
section's most prolific offenses.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always wanted to have the opportunity to play against them,"
Miller said. "We hear so much about them and that whole offense. They
have some great players.</TE>
<TE>   "Looking at them is kind of like looking in a mirror, at
ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   College recruiters were at the Venice campus Monday, no doubt to
watch the 6-foot-3 Vickers and 6-4 Giddens.</TE>
<TE>   Vickers, a natural physical specimen at 215 pounds, already has
several Division I offers. Giddens, a raw talent who is flourishing
in the pass-happy system, figures to pick up a lot of recruiting
action in the coming weeks. They have combined for 121 receptions and
18 touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Miller, at 5-11, doesn't get as many calls or visits. He knows
those numbers -- 5-11 -- don't go over well when recruiters have to
answer to their head coaches.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't bring it up but I know what they're thinking," he said
with a wry smile. "That's all right."</TE>
<TE>   Miller is what Coach Angelo Gasca calls the "point guard" in his
intricate offense.</TE>
<TE>   "We work a lot on spacing," Gasca said. "A lot of our patterns are
done in triangles. Eddie has to find the open guy."</TE>
<TE>   He usually finds them with deadly accuracy and rarely makes a bad
decision. Only six of his 263 attempts have been intercepted, while
72% have been completed.</TE>
<TE>   Miller's performance in playoff victories over Fremont and
Roosevelt have garnered rave reviews. He completed 31 of 43 passes
for 551 yards and six touchdowns in the two games.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question that he's played his best two games in the
last two weeks," Gasca said. "But we need him to play better this
week."</TE>
<TE>   Gasca, a former standout quarterback at Venice, is building a
quarterback legacy at his school that he hopes one day will rival
those at Taft and Newhall Hart. J.P. Losman, a disciple of Gasca's
when he was offensive coordinator, starts at Tulane. Anton Clarkson
is a freshman at Oregon State.</TE>
<TE>   Now there's Miller. But is Miller's success a product of his
abilities or the result of the system?</TE>
<TE>   "It's not fair to say he's doing great because he's just got great
receivers," Gasca said. "The receivers benefit from the passes that
he hits them with and he benefits from their ability to turn them
into big plays. It works hand-in-hand. No matter how many receivers
you have, you need someone to pull the trigger."</TE>
<TE>   At one time, Miller was the backup to Long Beach Poly quarterback
Leon Jackson when both were at Beverly Hills. Since coming to Venice
before his junior year, Miller has led the Gondoliers to a 17-7
record.</TE>
<TE>   But he also knows his most important game is Friday night, when he
will have a chance to prove himself against the section's only
undefeated team and title favorite.</TE>
<TE>   "I love adversity," Miller said. "I've loved when people said I
can't do something. Every step of the way, I've proven somebody
wrong."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The contributions of the four quarterbacks in the Championship
Division semifinals will be a determining factor in who plays in the
Coliseum for the title on Dec. 13.</TE>
<TE>   Miller's counterpart, Cary Dove, has made Taft go all season. Dove
has the numbers -- 2,839 yards and 29 touchdown passes -- but he has
also grown this season in terms of field presence and decision-making
ability.</TE>
<TE>   In the other semifinal, Gardena's and Birmingham's quarterbacks
are a study in contrasts. Birmingham has a stalwart in Ryan Lombardo,

<HD>Santa Margarita Takes Step Up</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some traditions, like the high expectations, tough schedule and
presence of top-notch players, were in place before the girls' soccer
season began at Santa Margarita High.</LD>
<LD>   And the Eagles are determined that the seemingly annual tradition
of winning Southern Section championships also will go on, despite
changes in their lineup and level of postseason competition.</LD>
<LD>   "Our goal is to win [a section title] again, like every other
year," said senior midfielder Shannon Foley, a Parade magazine and
National Soccer Coaches' Assn. of America preseason All-American. "We
don't want to lose. That's our main objective. We just take each game
one at a time, and everyone does their best. That's all you can ask
for."</LD>
<TE>   The Eagles (20-1-4 last season) have won the last two Southern
Section Division III titles and have three titles in four seasons,
winning Division II in 1997 and '98. They will try for a similar
finish in Division I this season.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, the Eagles are starting in a lofty position.</TE>
<TE>   They are the No. 2 team in the nation, behind only Heritage of
Colleyville, Texas, according Student Sports magazine's preseason
rankings.</TE>
<TE>   Among other teams in the magazine's top 25 are No. 4 San Clemente,
No. 11 Mission Viejo, No. 12 Anaheim Esperanza, No. 13 North
Hollywood Harvard-Westlake and No. 23 Mission Viejo Capistrano
Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "The expectations are pretty high," Foley said. "It gives us
something to work for, something to live up to."</TE>
<TE>   Whether Santa Margarita will be able to do it is likely to depend
upon an unsettled defense. Last season's back line and goalkeeper
Allyce Lawrence have graduated.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt last year was the best team we ever had," Coach Chuck
Morales said. "We didn't have any holes. It was set all the way
around.... That group could do anything. This is way different."</TE>
<TE>   Juniors Michelle Hull and Alicia Fujii, seniors Stephanie De
Almeida and Kelly Emsiek, and sophomore Courtney Krouse will split
time as defenders. Junior Nicole Lokietz and sophomore Kori Lu are
battling for the goalkeeper spot and will probably share the position
early in the season.</TE>
<TE>   The offense will revolve around Foley and sophomore forward Amy
Rodriguez. Foley was a member of the Northridge-based West Valley
Samba 16-and-under club team that won a national title in August, and
she has given a commitment to Virginia. Rodriguez, part of the girls'
16-and-under national-team selection pool, scored 10 goals as a
freshman last season.</TE>
<TE>   "They just play at a different level," Morales said. "At the upper
levels, you have to do that. You just have to learn to play faster
and play at a higher level."</TE>
<TE>   The Eagles will jump to Division I for the postseason as a result
of the Southern Section's realignment of playoff groupings, which is
based on strength of leagues rather than individual schools'
enrollments.</TE>
<TE>   But the move is unlikely to faze the Eagles. They will face
Division I-caliber competition in the Trabuco Hills and Excalibur
tournaments this month, in nonleague matches against Los Alamitos,
Mission Viejo, Newport Harbor and Concord Carondolet, as well as in
the Serra League.</TE>
<TE>   "We play Division I, and we always have. The only time it changed
was when we got to the playoffs," Morales said. "It'll make a
difference for us at the end of the season because now, you're
playing the big boys. But the truth of the matter is, we've already
been playing at that level."</TE>
<TE>   This season, they get a chance to make it official.</TE>

<HD>Osborn Wins in Three-Way Playoff</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter Yoon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a day when slick sloping greens and tricky pin positions made
birdies a rarity, it was only fitting that a routine par proved the
tournament winner Tuesday in the CIF-WSCGA finals.</LD>
<LD>   Jennifer Osborn of Huntington Beach Marina High shot one-over-par
73 at the SCGA Members Club at Murrieta, then won the individual
championship in a three-way playoff with Kim Silber of Bonita Vista
and Songyi Yi of Rancho Bernardo.</LD>
<LD>   Rolling Hills Estates Peninsula shot a four-player team total of
325 and upset two-time defending team champion Encinitas Torrey Pines
by one stroke. Annika Windon led Peninsula with a 75.</LD>
<TE>   Osborn, a sophomore, struck three outstanding shots into the
par-five hole during the playoff and left herself in good position,
about 12 feet left of the hole.</TE>
<TE>   Silber and Yi each made bogeys before Osborn attempted her birdie
putt so, needing only two putts to win, she lagged her first putt to
within 18 inches -- a bit shorter than she would have liked -- then
stroked in a knee-knocker for the win.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want to blast it way past the hole," Osborn said. "That
was a scary little one-footer."</TE>
<TE>   A fixture on the local junior circuit, Osborn won her first
national tournament Saturday at the American Junior Golf Assn. Junior
All-Star Series Championship in Florida. Tuesday, her ball-striking
and patience on the difficult greens were key. She hit 15 greens in
regulation and three-putted only once on a day that featured several
three-, four- and five-putts by other players.</TE>
<TE>   "[The greens] were tough, but tough is fun," Osborn said. "I just
really took my time with putts -- maybe too much time -- and just
tried to hang in there all day."</TE>
<TE>   Jennie Lee of Huntington Beach Edison shot 74 and finished fourth.
Southern Section individual champion Jenni Tangtiphaiboontana of Long
Beach Wilson, Amie Cochran of West Torrance, Soo Ji Cho of Glendale
and Windon tied for fifth at 75.</TE>
<TE>   Peninsula's victory was a surprise to everyone -- except the
Panthers. Torrey Pines had every player back from a team that had won
the last two team titles, but Peninsula got clutch performances from
Windon and Colette Lowe, who shot 81.</TE>

<LD>A preseason look at the top girls' soccer teams in the Southland:</LD>
<LD>   1. Santa Margarita (SS-Div. I)</LD>
<LD>   The Eagles, who finished 20-1-4 last season, have the talent and
experience to live up to high expectations -- theirs and everyone
else's.</LD>
<TE>   2. San Clemente (SS-Div. I)</TE>
<TE>   After winning Division I title with a 21-3-3 record, Tritons won't
surprise anyone this season, even though they have only four seniors.</TE>
<TE>   3. Harvard-Westlake (SS-Div. I)</TE>
<TE>   National player of the year Jill Oakes graduated, but Wolverines
(23-1-2 last season) are still loaded with Gina Farias-Eisner, Jamie
Artsis and Tracy Lansing.</TE>
<TE>   4. Esperanza (SS-Div. I)</TE>
<TE>   Aztecs return 11 players from last year's Division I semifinalist,
which finished 21-3-4, and add two freshman midfield starters in
Lindsey Domene and Jamie Petrossi.</TE>
<TE>   5. Capistrano Valley (SS-Div. I)</TE>
<TE>   Last year's Division I runner-up, which finished 17-4-2, relied on
goalkeeper Staci Sinkway. The Cougars can do the same this season.</TE>
<TE>   6. Mission Viejo (SS-Div. I)</TE>
<TE>   Diablos should be this season's San Clemente -- a team that
succeeds after not qualifying for the playoffs the season before.</TE>
<TE>   7. Edison (SS-Div. I)</TE>
<TE>   Last season's Division II champions, who finished 22-1-6, lose
standout goalkeeper Jenna Huff, but senior Jane Wyche leads a strong
midfield.</TE>
<TE>   8. Aliso Niguel (SS-Div. I)</TE>
<TE>   Goalkeeper Marissa Welliver leads a defense that returns intact
from last season, when it allowed only 12 goals and had 18 shutouts
while posting a 19-4-3 record.</TE>
<TE>   9. Los Alamitos (SS-Div. I)</TE>
<TE>   Griffins, who were 13-7-5 last season, lost goalkeeper Ashley
Deleajandro to graduation, but young players have raised hopes and
expectations.</TE>
<TE>   10. El Camino Real (City Section)</TE>
<TE>   Two-time defending City Section champion has a strong midfield,
and has added freshman Katie Oakes, Jill's younger sister.</TE>

<HD>Unstoppable Drive</HD>
<DH>Brooks doesn't let partially formed leg keep him out of Los
Alamitos' lineup</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Sondheimer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since birth, when Rob Brooks came into the world with half a leg, he
has refused to slow down or limit his options. He wore his first
prosthesis at 8 months old, and since then he has been adamant about
being as active as the kid next door.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday night, he was in the starting lineup for Los Alamitos
High in its basketball opener in the Buena Park tournament -- an
achievement few thought possible.</LD>
<LD>   "In life, there's doubters, but you just don't listen," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Brooks is a 5-foot-10 senior who plays wearing a high sock that
covers his prosthesis. He walks with a limp but gets up and down the
court using a skipping maneuver. Possessing superb upper-body
strength, he outmuscles taller players, and he knows basketball
because he's the son of a coach.</TE>
<TE>   "He's really a hard-nosed kid," Los Alamitos Coach Russ May said.
"For what he has to endure, he's a very successful player."</TE>
<TE>   The fact is, Brooks must work twice as hard as players with two
normal legs.</TE>
<TE>   "I made my body strong," he said. "I can shoot and do other things
on the court."</TE>
<TE>   Before Tuesday's game, Brooks sat in the bleachers chewing gum,
blowing bubbles and giving no hint about his long road traveled.</TE>
<TE>   He was born with proximal femoral focal deficiency, a condition
that affects one in 200,000. He has a shortened right femur, no thigh
and no hip. A prosthesis made of titanium is attached to an ankle
joint that's serving as a knee, and his calf muscle is functioning as
a thigh.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors stared in wonderment watching Brooks, at a younger age,
move around so well.</TE>
<TE>   "How on earth is this kid making this prosthesis move while
running up and down the court?" one asked.</TE>
<TE>   His mother, Kathy, knows: "It's just sheer will, and he's so darn
stubborn."</TE>
<TE>   Brooks could have had his foot amputated for cosmetic reasons at
an early age, but the family chose otherwise. He could have covered
his prosthesis with artificial skin, but he didn't want to hide the
truth.</TE>
<TE>   "His concern wasn't how it looked but how it worked," Kathy said.
"He's always had this enormous inner drive. He just has this spirit
that makes him get to the point where he needs to be."</TE>
<TE>   He removes his prosthesis when he takes a shower, sleeps or goes
body surfing. He has no trouble laughing over the fact he has broken
his "leg" at least a dozen times.</TE>
<TE>   He carries around a tool box containing glue, screws and a
screwdriver in case his leg needs fixing. The manufacturer of the
prosthesis isn't used to receiving lots of calls about broken legs,
but not everyone inflicts as much wear and tear as Brooks.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of a joke to them," he said. "No one else breaks their
leg."</TE>
<TE>   Brooks moved to Temecula for his freshman year soon after his
father, Steve, resigned in 1999 as basketball and volleyball coach at
Los Alamitos after nearly 20 years. It was a difficult time, because
Steve, who stayed on as a teacher, had been accused of
misappropriating funds. The Orange County District Attorney's Office
declined to prosecute.</TE>
<TE>   Brooks missed his friends and wanted to fulfill his dream of
playing for Los Alamitos, so he moved back for his sophomore year and
lived with his grandparents, then moved in with a friend last year.</TE>
<TE>   This year, when he turned 18, his parents agreed to let him live
on his own with a roommate in Seal Beach. He goes to church
regularly, has a 3.8 grade-point average, plans to attend USC next
fall and accepts the trust and responsibility his parents have placed
in him.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been an experiment and tough on us but very successful,"
Kathy said. "He knows if he messes up, he's out of there. I talk to
him every day on the phone and he knows he has to be more forthcoming
with information than being up in his room."</TE>
<TE>   Brooks knew people would be skeptical whether he could be an
effective basketball player.</TE>
<TE>   "I recognized the situation and I dealt with it as far as I wasn't
going to let it affect me or my life," he said. "I just decided to go
about playing, having fun, doing things in life and not worrying what
people said or how they looked at me. I just had to realize if I
didn't think I was going to play, who was?"</TE>
<TE>   Brooks was a varsity reserve last season and could lose his
starting position when several players join the team after the
football playoffs, but he contributed in a variety of ways Tuesday
during Los Alamitos' 76-46 victory over Garden Grove Bolsa Grande.</TE>
<TE>   In the first two minutes, he posted up and drew a foul, then
forced a jump ball. Later, he made a three-point basket, which
produced a holler from his mom and dad sitting in the bleachers. He
also forced a traveling violation with a quick defensive switch and
finished with seven points and three assists in 20 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   His biggest test came in the second quarter when 6-4, 245-pound
Sylvester Jefferson landed on him -- but nothing broke.</TE>
<TE>   "He's living proof if you work hard to do something, you can do
it," Bolsa Grande Coach Scott Snyder said.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Brooks, an assistant coach with USC's women's team, said he
admires his son's fortitude and determination.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're a parent, all you want is for him to live as normal a
life as possible," he said. "That wasn't even a thought, to play
varsity basketball. He's exceeded expectations all the way."</TE>
<TE>   By earning a starting spot, Brooks has reached a skills level few
others could have attained faced with similar obstacles.</TE>
<TE>   "This is kind of everything I've played for," he said. "I had a
goal to make the team, play, be effective. All the work I put in when
I was younger was for this year."</TE>
<TE>   Brooks doesn't see himself as inspirational, but he deserves to
savor this moment of triumph, as does his family.</TE>
<TE>   "It blows us away," Kathy said. "You just don't ever tell kids
they can't do something because they'll prove you wrong."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Senior middle blocker Noelle Quinn had 18 kills and 14 blocks to lead
Torrance Bishop Montgomery to a 15-9, 15-13, 10-15, 16-14 victory
over North Hollywood Harvard-Westlake in the Southern California
Division III girls' volleyball regional final Tuesday at Bishop
Montgomery.</LD>
<LD>   Quinn and another middle blocker, Nicole Read, who had 16 kills,
nine blocks and 12 digs, sparked comebacks by Bishop Montgomery in
each game and kept the match from going five games.</LD>
<LD>   The Knights (28-8) needed five games to win the Southern Section
Division III-A title over Harvard-Westlake (29-6) two weeks ago.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't think we were going to let that happen [again]," said
Quinn, who has committed to attend UCLA on a basketball scholarship.
"We've been through that. We knew what they had and they knew what we
had. It was just a matter of us playing our game."</TE>
<TE>   The victory was the Knights' third over Harvard-Westlake this
season. They also defeated the Wolverines in the Orange County
tournament in September. The latest victory sends Bishop Montgomery
into the state championship match for the first time since 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The Knights will face the winner of the Northern regional final
match between Forestville El Molino and San Jose Presentation. Bishop
Montgomery lost to El Molino in the 1999 state final.</TE>
<TE>   Justine Davidson led the Wolverines, two-time defending state
champions, with 18 kills and 21 digs.</TE>
<TE>   Lauren Peterson</TE>
<TE>   Bakersfield Liberty def. Newport Harbor, 15-4, 16-14, 13-15, 15-12
-- In only its third season of varsity competition, Liberty came out
strong early and took advantage of many unforced errors by host
Newport Harbor to win the Division II regional final in four tense
games.</TE>
<TE>   The victory made up for last season, when Newport Harbor, which
has won seven Southern Section and four state titles, whipped its
fledgling opponent on the Liberty floor in the opening round of the
state playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Liberty Coach Lean Slayton said the Patriots (31-4) had been
waiting for this moment for a year, and when Jodi Hardin's serve
dropped in front of four Sailors for an ace on the final point,
Liberty's bench exploded.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to end their season on their home floor," Slayton said.</TE>
<TE>   Liberty dominated most of the first two games and ran off to a 9-4
lead in the third game, but the Sailors (28-7) caught them at 13 and
won on kills by middle blocker Kristin McClune and Alyson Jennings.</TE>
<TE>   -- Paul McLeod</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Marymount def. San Juan Capistrano St. Margaret's,
11-15, 15-9, 17-15, 15-4--The defense was disheveled and the offense
was surprisingly stagnant at the start for Marymount, but there was
no sign of panic in the Marymount huddle between the first and second
games.</TE>
<TE>   After all, the Sailors are the defending state Division IV
champions.</TE>
<TE>   Middle blocker Virginia Levanas had 24 kills and Marymount
regrouped to win the next three games to advance to the Division IV
championship on Saturday at Cypress College, where it will meet
Atherton Menlo, the team it defeated in last year's title game.</TE>
<TE>   "We were pretty calm," said Levanas, who has signed with Duke. "We
said, 'Why put all our hard work to waste?' "</TE>
<TE>   Levanas, Liz Cvitan (15 kills) and Jamie Kaufman (11 kills) made
sure the Sailors (35-4) would get a chance to repeat their title feat
of last season.</TE>
<TE>   Levanas and Cvitan each had a kill and a block in the final stages
of a third-game comeback, during which the Sailors trailed, 14-11,
fought off five game points and won the game on a block by Kaufman.</TE>
<TE>   Polly Bendush had 20 kills for St. Margaret's (24-5), which lost
to Marymount in the state playoffs for a second year in a row.</TE>
<TE>   -- Mike Bresnahan</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach Wilson def. Clovis Buchanan, 14-16, 15-7, 15-5, 11-15,
15-11 -- Cynthia Barboza had 33 kills and Allison Dillon had 98
assists to lead the Bruins (36-3) over host Buchanan (33-6) in the
Division I regional final.</TE>

<HD>Big Ten Says Iowa to Play in BCS Game</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Dufresne</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The latest strange development in the always strange bowl
championship series:</LD>
<LD>   One day after USC all but clinched a BCS at-large berth by jumping
over Iowa into the No. 4 spot in the BCS standings, the Big Ten
Conference office issued a news release Tuesday stating Iowa "will
play in a bowl championship series (BCS) game to determined after the
results of Saturday's games are known."</LD>
<LD>   Hey, wait a minute here, if Iowa and USC have secured spots, then
how come the BCS on Tuesday did not release Notre Dame, Texas and
Kansas State from at-large consideration?</LD>
<TE>   The Big Ten statement was unusual in that, technically, Iowa has
not secured a guaranteed at-large BCS berth. One BCS source said the
release appears to indicate Iowa has received assurances it will play
in either the Rose or Orange bowls which means, in one scenario,
Notre Dame already has been eliminated from at-large consideration.</TE>
<TE>   Another BCS source said the Big Ten release was a "huge
assumption."</TE>
<TE>   Sue Lister, the Big Ten official who e-mailed the release, could
not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   If Iowa already is in, though, it means USC may be more vulnerable
to losing a major bowl bid even though it is presently ahead of Iowa
in the BCS standings. There is a slight chance USC could get bounced
from its No. 4 spot should Miami lose to Virginia Tech.</TE>
<TE>   BCS conference commissioners met on a conference call Tuesday to
hash out scenarios, but someone familiar with the discussions said
there were no absolutes as far as Iowa and a BCS bowl berth.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, the Big Ten launched out on its own, drawing the
reasonable conclusion Iowa was in no matter what.</TE>
<TE>   Deep breath here, again, for the explanations.</TE>
<TE>   If UCLA defeats Washington State on Saturday, Iowa is the
clear-cut choice to face Pac-10 champion USC in the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   If Washington State clinches the Rose Bowl bid, however, and USC
has secured a BCS at-large spot, the Orange Bowl would get to choose
among USC, Notre Dame, Iowa, Kansas State or Texas as a replacement
for Miami, assuming the Hurricanes advance to the Fiesta Bowl to play
Ohio State for the national title.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Big Ten release, the school getting the bid in
this scenario almost has to be Iowa, which would knock Notre Dame to
the Gator Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   If USC and Iowa end up in the Rose Bowl, of course, Notre Dame
would remain a viable candidate for the Orange Bowl, as would Kansas
State and, to a lesser extent, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   It appears as though the Big Ten, knowing Iowa is all but a lock,
was trying to get the jump on getting eligible teams slotted into
their respective bowls.</TE>
<TE>   In the same release, the Big Ten announced that five Big Ten
schools had accepted bowl invitations: Penn State to the Capitol One,
Michigan to the Outback, Purdue to the Sun, Wisconsin to the Alamo
and Minnesota to the Music City.</TE>
<TE>   If Iowa was not to make a BCS game, it would have feasibly dropped
to the Capitol One, and other Big Ten schools would be pushed down
the bowl ladder, with Minnesota perhaps having to move into the Motor
City. But now, all those Big Ten bowl slots are occupied.</TE>
<TE>   So, if for some strange reason Iowa was not selected for a BCS
game, it would apparently be left without a place to play. Iowa to
the Seattle Bowl?</TE>
<TE>   OK, that's crazy talk, but nothing in the BCS should surprise
anyone anymore.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Seattle Bowl and the Silicon Valley Classic in San Jose have
been given until Friday to submit letters of credit to the NCAA to
maintain certification. Bowls that did not distribute at least $1
million to each participant for the last three years must send a $1.5
million letter of credit to the NCAA.... Wisconsin receiver Lee Evans
pleaded innocent to a misdemeanor marijuana possession charge in
Dodgeville, Wis.</TE>

<KH>KING REPORT</KH>
<HD>Allison Rehab Has Been 'Up and Down'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jason Allison, five weeks into the rehabilitation of an injured right
knee that was expected to sideline him eight to 12 weeks, said
Tuesday that his return to the lineup could be only days away.</LD>
<LD>   Or it could be weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Or it could be a month.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't know," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But the burly center, the Kings' leading scorer before he was
injured Oct. 29 in a knee-on-knee collision with Andy Sutton of the
Atlanta Thrashers, indicated that he is willing to play as soon as
doctors give him the go-ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "There might be a point where I try it and if I can't do it, I'll
be out for another week or two," said Allison, who was scheduled to
meet with his doctors Tuesday afternoon. "But if it feels good and I
can help the team, I'll keep playing....</TE>
<TE>   "I've played injured before and been able to be effective. I have
to decide if I'm helping the team if I have to take a few minutes off
in a game because I've tweaked it or something. If I can get through
a game and be effective, that's fine. If I can't, there's no use
struggling out there and hurting the team."</TE>
<TE>   In the more than two weeks since Allison resumed skating, his
rehabilitation has been "up and down," he said, but he remains
encouraged.</TE>
<TE>   "There are certain days where I've tested it more and it hasn't
quite responded as well as I would like," he said. "But I still feel
better than expected."</TE>
<TE>   Lately, progress has been slow.</TE>
<TE>   "Certain things I've tried are hard to do and are pretty painful,"
he said. "If I just kind of turn my brain off and say, 'There's
nothing wrong with me,' and go into a corner or battle in front of
the net, I tend to tweak it."</TE>
<TE>   Still, he's eager to help.</TE>
<TE>   "When I do come back, I can deal with the tweaks and the swelling
and the pain if I can get stuff done on the ice," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Adam Deadmarsh, Ian Laperriere and Lubomir Visnovsky could be back
in the lineup as soon as Thursday night against Nashville.</TE>
<TE>   Visnovsky, who has sat out three games because of back spasms, is
"possible" for Thursday's game, Coach Andy Murray said, although the
player asked out about three-quarters of the way through Tuesday's
demanding practice.</TE>
<TE>   As for Deadmarsh and Laperriere, who have been sidelined because
of concussions, "I would say it's less probable than possible,"
Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Deadmarsh, who hasn't played since Nov. 12, "I'm so close to
being ready. Whether it's Thursday, I don't know, but it won't be
much longer."</TE>

<HD>Frustrated Kupchak Keeps Evaluating Team</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mitch Kupchak, who as assistant general manager and then the lead man
helped build these Lakers, said he is not yet inclined to make
changes, despite one of the worst five-week periods in decades.</LD>
<LD>   Kupchak spent last weekend in Maui, where he watched a college
basketball tournament and occasionally pondered the horrendous start
by a team that once -- and perhaps still -- believed a fourth
consecutive title was its destiny.</LD>
<LD>   "You feel the frustration, clearly, of a team that's
underachieving," Kupchak said in his office Tuesday morning. "This
organization has always leaned toward being patient, versus making
the move prematurely. I had a discussion with Dr. [Jerry] Buss a week
or so ago, and we were talking about the team and the record. I asked
him how he was doing with it. He said, 'I've been doing things this
way too many years to be anxious at this point in time.'</LD>
<TE>   "But I have a job to do. As a group -- scouts, general manager,
coaches, players -- you do have to look in the mirror and you have to
say, 'Am I doing my job? Am I doing the best I can?' Our players have
to do that, our coaches have to do that, our general manager, I have
to do that. 'Did I do the best I could do today? What can I do now?'
My job is to assemble personnel. So, I have to do that. Is this the
right group?"</TE>
<TE>   The answer, he said, through 18 games: "We don't feel we're at the
point we can fairly evaluate this team. We may not be the team that
gets us to the Finals or the conference finals, whatever. But I know
we're better than a team that's rebuilding. Until we get to the point
where we can fairly assess this group and how good it can be, then we
can't."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Samaki Walker (strained lower back) said he hoped to practice
Thursday and play Friday night, when the Lakers host the Dallas
Mavericks.</TE>

<LD>Showtime it ain't.</LD>
<LD>   But these are unusual times for the Lakers, days spent
uncomfortably at or near the bottom of the Pacific Division. They
played "I Love L.A." late Tuesday night at Staples Center, and that'd
be good enough for now.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers defeated the Memphis Grizzlies, 101-91, as Kobe Bryant
had a workmanlike triple-double -- 24 points, 10 rebounds and 11
assists -- his fourth of the season, and Shaquille O'Neal scored 28
points.</LD>
<TE>   They won for the second time in five games, both against the
Grizzlies, inched their record to 7-12, and slapped hands wearily at
the end, thrilled for the win, still unable to quite get the grind of
it all. They had 20 turnovers. Six Grizzlies scored in double
figures, and Memphis didn't go away until the final moments, after a
17-7 Laker run.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a start," forward Rick Fox said, and that's all it was.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant played on knees suddenly wracked by tendinitis and O'Neal
huffed closer to better conditioning. They made a few shots at the
end and the Grizzlies missed theirs, and then they went home for a
short night and a 9 a.m. flight to Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   What they knew is they're not there yet.</TE>
<TE>   "The players were asking me to get out the sage or the sweet grass
and smudge the locker room again, because it's obvious that there's
something amiss in the air," Coach Phil Jackson said with a smile.
"But I just say it's a matter of communication and we're going to get
that and we'll be in sync soon."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant had seven points and four assists in the fourth quarter,
when the Grizzlies drew to within a jump shot of them. O'Neal scored
seven points and blocked three shots in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   "We're getting there," Bryant said. "It's a process. We played
pretty well in spurts, hit some big shots when we needed to. It's
just a matter of time."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson spent the week talking about defense and then started Mark
Madsen over Slava Medvedenko at power forward, relieving Madsen
halfway through the first quarter with Robert Horry. Medvedenko, who
started against the Grizzlies on Friday in Memphis, had his problems
staying between Drew Gooden and the basket.</TE>
<TE>   Horry played for the first time since he went 38 minutes Wednesday
in Orlando. He'd rested his sore left foot ever since, on Monday
going so far as to get an MRI, which was negative.</TE>
<TE>   After playing 10 minutes in the first half, Horry started the
second half and scored 11 points, five in the final quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Madsen had an odd moment that lightened a tense game. Near the end
of the first half, he airballed consecutive free throws. Grazed the
net on both. Bryant patted his butt between shots.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd gasped. Players on the bench put their hands over their
mouths, as though deep in thought. Jackson crossed his arms and
pondered his next move.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of minutes later, it was gone in the suddenness of a
Bryant cross-over, a spin, and a slash to the rim. In a game fraught
with turnovers and stilted, mechanical play, Bryant spun off Gordan
Giricek on the right wing, burst past Gooden, past Pau Gasol and
launched himself toward the far side of the rim. His dunk was loud
and hard, and the crowd was lifted for a moment from the doldrums
that have gripped Laker basketball for quarters at a time.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant landed and did not pump his fist or shout or anything so
flashy. He sighed. The Lakers led, 39-35. It should be easier, of
course. There should be a discernible rhythm. In the absence of that,
Bryant seemed to say, there could at least be a few moments like
that.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Bryant played with a certain grimness befitting the Laker
situation, another December morning spent in last place, promises for
grittier play followed by open jumpers for the Grizzlies, promises
for control followed by 13 first-half turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been frustrating for all of us," Bryant said.</TE>
<TE>   So, as Hubie Brown wore out the hardwood in front of the visitors'
bench and the ears of his players, the impressionable Grizzlies were
as advertised -- young, prone to mistakes, and a complete pain to
play.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers, who shot 50.6%, made some plays in the fourth quarter,
and Jason Williams kept coming and Wesley Person kept shooting and
Lorenzen Wright kept banging, making the whole thing just a touch
uncomfortable for a team trying to win, like, 15 games in a row.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Yao Ming got all the motivation he needed from reading the starting
lineups.</LD>
<LD>   Matched against David Robinson and Tim Duncan, Yao scored 27
points, grabbed a season-high 18 rebounds and added a crowd-pleasing
slam in the closing minutes to lead the Rockets to an 89-75 victory
over the San Antonio Spurs on Tuesday night at Houston.</LD>
<LD>   "It might have been because I knew I was going up against two
great centers," Yao said, explaining his performance. "When I first
got to the NBA I had a lot to think about. To get this victory, it's
like being able to take a deep breath."</LD>
<TE>   After leading much of the game, the Rockets trailed, 64-61, going
into the fourth quarter. But they quickly regained the lead and won
going away as the Spurs went scoreless over the final 2:43.</TE>
<TE>   Yao rebounded a miss by Steve Francis with 3:04 to go and slammed
it home. Francis had 18 points and six assists, and Moochie Norris
had 16 points.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento 98, Minnesota 86 -- Bobby Jackson scored 24 points and
Chris Webber had 22 points and 11 rebounds as the Kings overcame
Kevin Garnett's second big game against them in seven days to win at
Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Garnett had 18 points, 16 rebounds and nine assists -- barely
missing the ninth triple-double of his career.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 87, Atlanta 72 -- Richard Jefferson bounced back from a
big blunder with 22 points and a career-high 14 rebounds to lead the
banged-up Nets at East Rutherford, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   The victory was only the second in five games for the Nets, with
one of the losses largely to blame on Jefferson.</TE>
<TE>   He missed two free throws with New Jersey ahead by two points with
9.8 seconds left in a loss to Seattle on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Washington 103, Milwaukee 78 -- Michael Jordan scored 25 points in
his second game as a starter, and the man he replaced in the lineup,
Bryon Russell, matched his season-high with 16 points as the Wizards
won at Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan and Russell scored 27 consecutive Wizard points in the
first half, including all the points in a 16-5 run that put
Washington ahead, 42-29.</TE>
<TE>   Golden State 110, Denver 89 -- Antawn Jamison scored 34 points as
the Warriors extended their longest winning streak in over a year to
three games with a victory at Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   New Orleans 115, Chicago 90 -- David Wesley scored a season-high
25 points and Jamal Mashburn had 21 as the Hornets won at Chicago.</TE>

<LD>Andy Irons of Princeville, Hawaii, clinched the Assn. of Surfing
Professionals' world championship Tuesday despite failing to advance
past the quarterfinals of the Rip Curl Cup at Sunset Beach on Oahu.</LD>
<LD>   Luke Egan of Australia was the only threat to Irons in the
standings but also failed to advance in eight- to 10-foot waves at
the famous North Shorebreak.</LD>
<LD>   "It was drama enough for me," said Irons, 24, an eight-year pro
and winner of three of 11 ASP World Championship Tour events this
year. "It still hasn't sunk in yet but I'll be in a total daydream
when it does and I can't wait."</LD>
<TE>   Irons became the third surfer from Hawaii to win the world title,
the first since Sunny Garcia in 2000. Derek Ho won the title in 1993.</TE>

<TE>   Among Byrne's first duties with the Aggies will be hiring a

<HD>Steelers Select Maddox to Start at Quarterback</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pittsburgh Steeler Coach Bill Cowher didn't hesitate Tuesday to
announce Tommy Maddox will start against Houston, mostly so it
wouldn't distract his team.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, Cowher waited to pick Kordell Stewart as his
quarterback, mostly to distract their opponent.</LD>
<LD>   Cowher, determined not to let a quarterback debate divide a team
that is 6-1-1 in its last eight games, said Maddox was playing too
well before getting hurt Nov. 17 to lose his job to an injury. Maddox
was briefly paralyzed after taking a hit from Tennessee's Keith
Bullock that gave him cerebral and spinal cord concussions.</LD>
<TE>   Stewart had played virtually error-free in the two-plus games
Maddox was out, completing 51 of 69 passes for 562 yards, three
touchdowns and one interception and running for 135 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "I've talked with Tommy and talked with Kordell, and we certainly
won't hesitate -- if we need a spark -- to go to Kordell," Cowher
said. "The bottom line is, at time of the injury, he was playing well
and did not merit losing that job."</TE>

<TE>   The Chargers again have requested to begin talks with San Diego's
mayor and city concerning the team's Qualcomm Stadium lease and
pursuit of a new venue. The team made a similar request in May, but
Mayor Dick Murphy ultimately deferred to a 15-member task force
formed to study the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Within the next two months, the Chargers probably will trigger an
escape clause in their lease that will lay the groundwork for them to
leave San Diego -- and possibly move to Los Angeles -- if they do not
get a new stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal is simple: We want to keep the Chargers in San Diego,
and we want to create the best possible chance of succeeding with a
public vote," Mark Fabiani, the team's point man on new stadium
issues, writes in a letter to Murphy and the city council dated
today.</TE>

<LD>The Vancouver Canucks' good fortune ran out in a place it often does.</LD>

winning streak ever at 10 games with a 2-1 victory Tuesday night at
Uniondale, N.Y.</LD>
<LD>   Alexei Yashin scored with 1:32 left to break a 1-1 tie and end the
NHL's longest winning streak this season.</LD>
<TE>   Vancouver won its last five at home and on the road before running

<HD>Montgomery, Jones Win Owens Award</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Helene Elliott</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Marion Jones capped an undefeated track season by winning the Jesse
Owens Award -- and sharing it with her training and romantic partner,
Tim Montgomery.</LD>
<LD>   Jones, who recorded 16 victories in the 100 meters, four in the
200 and one at 400 meters, joined Michael Johnson as the only
three-time winners of the award, given annually by USA Track and
Field to the top U.S. male and female track and field athletes.</LD>
<LD>   Montgomery, who set a world record of 9.78 seconds in the 100
meters Sept. 14, is a first-time winner.</LD>
<TE>   Jones and Montgomery will receive replicas of the award Friday
during USATF's annual meetings in Kansas City.</TE>
<TE>   In the women's voting, Jones easily defeated runner-up Deena
Drossin of Mammoth Lakes, the two-time U.S. 10,000-meter champion.
Montgomery edged marathoner Khalid Khannouchi in a close vote among
the men, a USATF official said.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried to tell Tim a little bit about what the award means, and
he understands," Jones said during a conference call Tuesday from the
couple's training base in Raleigh, N.C. "Just to be mentioned in the
same sentence with one of the greats of our sport is an honor....
I've had the pleasure of getting to know Mr. Owens' family, and this
definitely ranks very high among the honors I've received."</TE>
<TE>   Although disappointed that she didn't lower the personal-best
100-meter time of 10.65 seconds she set in 1998, Jones was proud to
become the first U.S. athlete to go undefeated in a season since
Johnson in 1995. After losing the 2001 world title in the 100 to
Zhanna Pintusevich-Block of Ukraine, she had to prove she hadn't lost
her competitive edge.</TE>
<TE>   "My confidence is built back up," said Jones, who resumed
long-jump training and plans to compete in the 100, 200 and long jump
outdoors. "I didn't run as fast as I wanted to but I was able to pull
out some victories. 2002 was a huge confidence builder. Not that my
confidence was knocked off, but it was jarred."</TE>
<TE>   Jones doesn't plan to run indoors next season and will make her
outdoor debut at the Mount San Antonio College Relays in Walnut, as
usual.</TE>
<TE>   Montgomery, however, said he might run a few indoor races. Told
that former world-record holder Maurice Greene said he'd like to race
Montgomery this winter, Montgomery laughed.</TE>
<TE>   "He wants me to come indoors so he can get in my mind," he said.
"My strength is outdoors.... I know the world record is going to be
broken again next year. I can see improvement from what I've done."</TE>
<TE>   Both resumed training Nov. 1 after taking a shared break. However,
they're not engaged.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very happy, and things are going great in our lives, and
we're looking forward to 2003," Jones said.</TE>

<HD>Karros, Grudzielanek in Good Company Now</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T.J. Simers</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Now as I understand it, if this baseball trade is completed, in
addition to Eric Karros and Mark Grudzielanek joining me as Tribune
Company employees -- and just in time for our Christmas bonuses --
the Dodgers must also send cash to the Cubs.</LD>
<LD>   That's interesting because the Tribune Company, which owns The
Times and the Cubs, has made it clear there's no money available. So
it's obvious to me why the company has demanded the Dodgers send
cash, and won't Kevin Brown be surprised when he learns who funded my
raise?</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   TO BE honest, I've thought for some time now Chicago would be the
perfect place for Karros because of that city's passion for 16-inch
softball, and the fact it's a game in which almost no one strikes
out.</TE>
<TE>   I don't know how much he's going to help the Cubs, but when it
comes time to join the Tribune Company softball team with the shorter
distance between the bases, I believe he's going to dominate the
Tavern League.</TE>
<TE>   As for Grudzielanek, he's going to a city where a lot of people
have long last names that are difficult to spell, so he should feel
right at home.</TE>
<TE>   Now in return for the right side of the infield, the Dodgers are
going to get second-hand smoke, which has to be a concern for folks
who hang around the team.</TE>
<TE>   The last time I saw Todd Hundley he was sitting just outside the
Dodger clubhouse smoking a cigarette. I suppose you could put a
blindfold on him, and make him the poster child for this year's
Dodger marketing theme: "It's time to start executing," but the real
scary news is the Dodgers have more moves planned.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I ASKED Coach Phil Jackson before Tuesday night's Laker game when
he's going to start doing some coaching -- not realizing that would
be a good time to start, what with UCLA's Steve Lavin sitting
courtside directly across from him. I'm not sure what good it's going
to do to make Lavin think a coach has to sit there like a bump on a
log, but I'm not ruling out it might be an improvement in his case.</TE>
<TE>   Anyway, when I pressed Jackson for an answer on how to straighten
out the Lakers, he was speechless. I said, "I'm concerned that you
seem befuddled," but he didn't seem particularly concerned about
that.</TE>
<TE>   He admitted, however, while walking off the court the other night
someone yelled to him, "When are you going to start coaching?" and
while I'm surprised Jeanie Buss would be so blunt, it's a very good
question.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people think you're coaching if you're walking up and down
the court, waving your hands and calling out signals," Jackson said,
but all I'm asking for is some sign of life.</TE>
<TE>   I continued to quiz him, and at one point he muttered something
about sustained effort and more defense, and if I wanted to be bored,
I'd place a call to Dodger Manager Jim Tracy.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, Jackson has responded to these kind of queries with
clever quips or humor, but this time he just couldn't make the
adjustment from routine questions and answers to, "Hey, you big lug,
when are you going to do something to fix this?"</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers are 0-9 when trailing at the half this season, which
also suggests an inability to make adjustments. Now we know Lavin can
rebound from a slow start, but we just don't know about this guy, and
I'm afraid it's getting to the point where I might have to start
needling him more. You can see how much it helped USC.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously, I got the Lakers to win Tuesday night.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   YOU CAN just imagine what Chick Hearn would be saying as lousy as
the Lakers have been playing, or you could just listen to Kobe Bryant
after most games.</TE>
<TE>   "I learned a lot from Chick," joked Kobe after taking part Tuesday
to rename a stretch of 11th Street in Hearn's honor.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to get a four-peat for Chick," Kobe told the crowd,
and if his prediction is correct, the Lakers' championship parade
will work its way up Figueroa and this time will turn right on "Chick
Hearn Court" in front of Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Laker General Manager Mitch Kupchak said: "Every map in Los
Angeles will now have to be changed" to include Chick Hearn Court,
which will stretch from Figueroa to Cherry, and how fitting is that,
Kupchak said, since Chick "was the man who put the Lakers on the map
first?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ALTHOUGH SOME teammates and critics are beginning to peck away
again at Kobe for shooting off his mouth or just shooting too much
period, he remains a competitive and poised marvel at 24 years of
age.</TE>
<TE>   His performance at the Hearn ceremony was once again mature beyond
his years, and on the court he's still a highlight film in the making
every time he touches the ball. "I have been critical," he said, "but
that's what a leader is supposed to do. Sometimes it might come
across a little hard, but it's all in love."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THERE'S NOTHING like a good cry, and that's why I'm recommending
"Plaschke: Good Sports and Spoilsports, Foul Balls and Oddballs," the
perfect book to buy at Christmas time with all proceeds from the
collection of sports columnist Bill Plaschke's columns going to the
Times Holiday Campaign for disadvantaged children. It's my hope every
book will be sold, bringing Plaschke to tears when he realizes how
much he could have made had all the money not gone to charity.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from Jeff Hubbard:</TE>
<TE>   "You're good luck for the mighty Trojans. Every time you criticize
USC, we win. Keep up the good work, and please predict another loss
in our BCS Bowl game."</TE>
<TE>   That's funny, I got USC finally winning a game -- wonder what that
means?</TE>

<HD>Ronaldo Sparks Real Madrid</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Grahame L. Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brazilian striker Ronaldo returned to the scene of his World Cup
triumph Tuesday night and scored the first goal as European champion
Real Madrid of Spain defeated South American champion Olimpia of
Paraguay, 2-0, in front of 66,070 at the International Stadium at
Yokohama, Japan, winning the annual Toyota/Intercontinental Cup.</LD>
<LD>   "I am delighted," Ronaldo said. "This stadium brought me luck at
the World Cup and has been good to me again. This has been an
incredible year for me and for Real Madrid."</LD>
<LD>   Ronaldo's World Cup teammate, defender Roberto Carlos, created the
first goal in the 14th minute with a cross from the left that Raul
dummied, allowing the ball to reach the onrushing Ronaldo, whose
17-yard shot gave goalkeeper Ricardo Tavarelli no chance.</LD>
<TE>   The Paraguayan team had its best scoring chance moments later when
Rodrigo Lopez hit the post with a fierce volley.</TE>
<TE>   Real Madrid, which won the Toyota/Intercontinental Cup in 1960 and
1998, sealed the victory in the 84th minute when Guti headed in a
right-wing cross from Luis Figo.</TE>
<TE>   Real Madrid, which also won the European Champions League and the
European Super Cup this year, became only the fourth team since the
event started in 1960 to win the unofficial world club championship
three times, joining Italy's AC Milan and Uruguay's Penarol and
Nacional.</TE>
<TE>   Boniek Quits</TE>
<TE>   Zbigniew Boniek, 46, who was appointed Poland's coach after its
disappointing World Cup campaign, resigned after only five months and
five matches in charge.</TE>
<TE>   "I have been thinking about it for a couple of days," Boniek said
in Warsaw. "I think it is the right [decision] and I do not intend to
comment."</TE>
<TE>   Under Boniek, who was Poland's greatest player, Poland compiled a
2-2-1 record, but his efforts to modernize the team, introduce new
players and change tactics were met by criticism from players and the
media.</TE>
<TE>   His assistant, former international defender Stefan Majewski, was
selected caretaker coach until a successor is found.</TE>
<TE>   Tahuichi Loss</TE>
<TE>   Rolando Aguilera, who in 1978 founded one of international
soccer's most successful youth development programs, the Tahuichi
Academy in Bolivia, has died at 64 in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, after a
lengthy illness.</TE>
<TE>   Among the top-class Bolivian national team players Tahuichi
produced are Marco Etcheverry of Major League Soccer's D.C. United
and Erwin "Platini" Sanchez of Boavista in the Portuguese league.</TE>
<TE>   Francis Fined</TE>
<TE>   Trevor Francis, the former England international who is coach of
Crystal Palace in the English first division, was fined $1,566 by the
Football Assn. after being found guilty of violent conduct.</TE>
<TE>   Francis had cuffed his backup goalkeeper, Latvian Alex Kolinko, on
the head after Kolinko laughed when Palace conceded a goal during a
game this season.</TE>
<TE>   Quick Passes</TE>
<TE>   Striker Arman Karamyan, whose club-record 36 goals helped Pyunik
Yerevan win the Armenian league and cup double, was selected
Armenia's player of the year. His twin brother, Artavazd, finished
second.... Sparta Prague fired Jozef Jarabinsky as coach, even though
the team leads the Czech league. Jarabinsky's failure to qualify
Sparta for the European Champions League was the cause.</TE>

<LD>   Loyola Marymount (3-2) at UC Irvine (1-2), 7, KUCI (88.9), KXLU
(88.9) -- These are two teams at opposite ends of the spectrum.
Youthful Loyola Marymount has had major contributions from two
sophomores and four freshmen, including freshman guard Brandon
Worthy, who comes off the bench to lead the team in scoring (11.4
points). Irvine is loaded with veterans who are not playing up to
expectations, most notably 7-foot center Adam Parada (foul trouble)
and forwards Stanislav Zuzak and Jordan Harris (inconsistent
shooting).</LD>
<LD>   Pepperdine (1-2) at CS Fullerton (1-2), 7, KWRM (1370), KPLS (870)
-- Fullerton presents some matchup problems in the post for the
Waves, who have struggled in rebounding since 6-10 junior center Will
Kimble ended his career after being diagnosed with a heart ailment
and 6-9 forward Glen McGowan was injured. Pepperdine was
outrebounded, 34-26, in Monday's 65-63 victory at Long Beach.
Fullerton, with 6-10 Pape Sow in the middle, took a 46-33 advantage
in rebounds in Monday's 74-56 victory over visiting Morris Brown.</LD>
<TE>   CS Northridge (2-2) at San Diego (3-0), 7, KCSN (88.5) -- It will
be tough for the visiting Matadors to get Coach Bobby Braswell his
100th career victory against San Diego, which won in overtime at UCLA
last week, 86-81. The Toreros also made their first 15 shots and
finished with a school single-game record for field-goal percentage
(70.5%) in an 84-64 win at UC Riverside. Ian Boylan averages 16.5
points for Northridge.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach State (1-3) at Southern Utah (1-2), 6, KRLA (870, 7,
delayed) -- The 49ers are squeezing in a trip to Cedar City between
Monday night's loss to Pepperdine, and Sunday's game with UCLA at
Pauley Pavilion. This is the first meeting between the 49ers and the
Thunderbirds, who are hosting the second of six consecutive home
games.</TE>

<TE>   USC (3-2) at Pepperdine (4-2), 8 -- There's little chance the
Trojans are looking ahead to Sunday's meeting with defending national
champion Connecticut. Pepperdine has never beaten USC (0-14), but has
the capability to end that streak. The Waves are playing their fifth
straight home game and have won the last two, including last
Saturday's overtime victory against Wisconsin. USC was beaten last
Friday by Notre Dame, its second loss to a top-10 team.</TE>

<HD>Seniors' Moment</HD>
<DH>With collegiate careers winding down, 14 Bruins say focus
is simply on winning</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four years of hard work and running in place.</LD>
<LD>   Four years of personal growth, forming friendships and forging
futures.</LD>
<LD>   It has been all of that for UCLA's 14 seniors -- careers awash in
contradiction. Yet an unambiguous concluding statement can ring from
the Rose Bowl on Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   The Bruins end the regular season against No. 7 Washington State,
which needs a victory to return to Pasadena on Jan. 1 for the Rose
Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "I will walk on that field with my head high, and I will walk off
the same way," senior cornerback Ricky Manning Jr. said. "I just want
to win that game. That's all any of us want."</TE>
<TE>   Don't bother telling the seniors that UCLA can win by losing. In
the convoluted bowl scenario, a loss could put the Bruins in the
Holiday Bowl, rather than the less prestigious Insight Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   A Bruin loss also would dash the Rose Bowl hopes of archrival USC
and line the pockets of every Pacific 10 Conference school because
Washington State and USC both would make bowl championship series
games.</TE>
<TE>   Knocking off the favored Cougars, in other words, would disappoint
nearly everyone.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins, however, don't share the view of BCS wonks.</TE>
<TE>   "We aren't even thinking about which bowl we play in," senior
linebacker Marcus Reese said. "There is a lot riding on this game for
us."</TE>
<TE>   Especially for the seniors, who have shown modest but steady
improvement, despite never having posted more than seven victories in
a season They were on teams that went 4-7 in 1999, 6-6 in 2000 and
7-4 last year.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA again is 7-4, so beating Washington State would continue the
positive pattern. With no Pacific 10 Conference titles, BCS games or
victories over USC to show for their careers, the seniors are
breaking out the "It's not how you start, it's how you finish"
refrain.</TE>
<TE>   "We can go from an all-right season to a great season," Manning
said.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday is also the final game at the Rose Bowl for the seniors.
The last three years, they watched as older teammates fought back
tears and discovered untapped reservoirs of emotion.</TE>
<TE>   Even last season's seniors, roundly criticized for a late-season
fade, rebounded to beat Arizona State at home in the finale.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll take a moment to look around and think about what the Rose
Bowl has meant," tackle Bryce Bohlander said. "This will be a special
game for me and for all the other seniors. At the end, there will be
some reflection. It will be a little sad."</TE>
<TE>   Many seniors can reflect on significant personal achievement. The
four Bruins who earned All-Pacific 10 Conference honors are in their
final seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Tight end Mike Seidman's hard blocks and soft hands boosted his
NFL stock. He has 37 catches for 563 yards, only seven catches and 14
yards from season school records, and was selected all-conference.</TE>
<TE>   Manning, a three-time all-conference cornerback, will leave the
legacy of a pint-sized iron man. He has started 43 consecutive games,
and, barring injury, will finish one start from the school record of
46 in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Reese, a career-long reserve, became the starting middle
linebacker and filled the sizable shoes of last year's All-American,
Robert Thomas, leading the team with 83 tackles.</TE>
<TE>   Bohlander will graduate with honors this winter. He and
all-conference tackle Mike Saffer are expected to become
mid-to-low-round NFL picks.</TE>
<TE>   Nate Fikse, a two-time all-conference punter, proved he is also a
reliable kicker, making 10 consecutive field goals since taking the
job from senior Chris Griffith, who ranks fourth on the all-time UCLA
field-goal list with 42.</TE>
<TE>   Before breaking an ankle five games ago, quarterback Cory Paus
worked his way to No. 2 behind Cade McNown in passing yardage.</TE>
<TE>   Linemen Rusty Williams, Sean Phillips and Steve Morgan have
contributed to a defense revitalized the last two years under
coordinator Phil Snow. And cornerback Joe Hunter, receiver Jon
Dubravac and tight end-defensive tackle Saia Makakaufaki are steady
contributors off the bench.</TE>
<TE>   It's not as flashy as last season's class that sent seven players
to the NFL. No one is as electrifying as DeShaun Foster or as
charismatic as Marques Anderson.</TE>
<TE>   But these seniors have proven to be excellent role models for the
large, talented freshman and sophomore classes that represent UCLA's
football future.</TE>
<TE>   "These seniors taught me how to practice the way I play," freshman
receiver Junior Taylor said. "Take Ricky Manning. He walks it and
talks it. On Saturday he gives his all. And on Monday he gives his
all. His impact will still be here years from now."</TE>
<TE>   Said Coach Bob Toledo: "I love this group of seniors. They've
provided great leadership all season. They've done everything we've
asked."</TE>
<TE>   They practice hard. They get along.</TE>
<TE>   And unlike other recent Bruin senior classes, they've never been
accused of quitting.</TE>
<TE>   "There's never been any finger-pointing among us," Reese said. "We
love the game. We all just come out every day and play hard and let
the rest of it take care of itself."</TE>
<TE>   Insight Bowl vs. Holiday Bowl? Their insight doesn't stretch far
beyond the stockpile of turkey sandwiches they brought back after
trips home for the last holiday.</TE>
<TE>   Speculation that UCLA must win to save the jobs of Toledo and his
staff is a more compelling source of motivation.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to see the coaches come back," Seidman said. "My position
coach [Gary Bernardi] does a great job and I know everybody else
feels the same way about their coach."</TE>
<TE>   Said Reese: "To think that one game against a team playing to get
into the Rose Bowl could make or break them after we've had a good
season doesn't seem right. If we win, it should take care of that
talk."</TE>
<TE>   Winning, however, has never been what these seniors do especially
well. It's entirely possible that UCLA could play hard Saturday and
still lose.</TE>
<TE>   "We should be remembered for playing with heart, day in and day
out," Bohlander said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jason Gesser tested his sore right leg in practice Tuesday, but
Washington State Coach Mike Price said it is not known whether his
star quarterback can play Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Price said the decision would be made probably just before the
game.</TE>

<KH>UCLA REPORT</KH>
<HD>Walcott's Hibernation Is Finished</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ryan Walcott seems to spend all his time sleeping or running. The
good news for UCLA is that he's back on his feet.</LD>
<LD>   The sophomore point guard is eligible after sitting out the first
two games as a penalty for playing in an exhibition game during his
redshirt season two years ago.</LD>
<LD>   On Saturday morning, he woke up moments before UCLA tipped off
against Duke and watched from his couch. The Bruins lost and he
promptly went back to sleep.</LD>
<TE>   Suffice to say Walcott should be well rested Sunday against Long
Beach State.</TE>
<TE>   "It was rough watching them play without me," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Now it's time to get moving.</TE>
<TE>   "We can start pressing in the first half, maybe for the whole
game," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Steve Lavin has been reluctant to employ a full-court press
in Walcott's absence because starting guards Cedric Bozeman and Ray
Young had to play nearly the entire game. Walcott is expected to play
about 20 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "He's an excellent on-the-ball defender and on offense he's
unselfish," Lavin said. "We've got a long way to go as a team, but
getting Ryan back is key."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bozeman, who has played 76 minutes in the two games, leads the
Pacific 10 Conference in assist-to-turnover ratio.</TE>
<TE>   The sophomore point guard had eight assists and one turnover in
the overtime loss to San Diego and six assists and three turnovers
against Duke.</TE>
<TE>   "Ced's decision-making is improving," Lavin said. "He's just going
to continue to get better."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ryan Hollins did not realize he would start in place of T.J.
Cummings against Duke until close to game time. Cummings and Young
were held out for eight minutes because they were late to a meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Hollins, a freshman center, played reasonably well, taking four
rebounds, blocking a shot and making a steal in 24 minutes. He missed
his first two shots, then in the final seconds made a layup off an
assist from reserve guard Gene Barnes for his first college basket.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad I didn't know earlier that I was going to start because
I would have been a mess," he said. "I just tried to play hard."</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-11 Hollins felt comfortable on defense but appeared
timid on offense.</TE>
<TE>   "I only got four touches," he said. "A couple times [Duke point
guard Chris] Duhon guarded me and I could have posted him up. I need
to be more vocal about getting the ball."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hollins (flu) and forward Dijon Thompson (sprained thumb) did not
practice but are expected to play Sunday.... Instead of practicing
today, the Bruins will visit the City of Hope National Medical Center
and spend time with patients.</TE>

<HD>Trojans Are Thunderstruck</HD>
<DH>At home in its raucous arena, UC Santa Barbara's 69-53
victory is its first win ever against USC.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Gutierrez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SANTA BARBARA</DL>
<LD>Overcome with the emotion of beating USC for the first time in school
history, UC Santa Barbara hooted and hollered its way to its locker
room as a smattering of the 4,490 in attendance stormed the
Thunderdome court.</LD>
<LD>   "That's what I'm talking about," Gaucho sophomore forward Casey
Cook yelled, to no one in particular. "USC? A steppingstone, a
steppingstone."</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, the Gauchos could have used the bricks the Trojans threw
up in the second half of the 69-53 Santa Barbara victory Tuesday
night for so many steppingstones.</LD>
<TE>   Consider: After taking a 30-28 lead into halftime, USC (2-2) shot
a miserable 24.2% (eight of 33) from the field in the second half and
the 53 points the Trojans finished with represented their lowest
offensive output since losing, 67-52, at Oregon State on Feb. 22,
2001.</TE>
<TE>   "In the first half, the ball falls; in the second half, it
doesn't," said junior guard Roy Smiley, who led the Trojans with a
career-high 16 points but scored only two in the second half. After
making four of his five three-point attempts in the game's first 20
minutes Smiley was 0 for 3 from beyond the arc in the second.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a lid [on the basket] in the second half," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The lid was on it all game long for USC's two leading returning
scorers.</TE>
<TE>   Junior guard Desmon Farmer came off the bench to finish with 12
points but he was just five of 14 from the field, 0 for 7 from beyond
the three-point stripe.</TE>
<TE>   And the early season shooting woes of sophomore shooting guard
Errick Craven, who was coming off a one-game suspension, continued as
well. Craven started against the Gauchos but made only two of his 13
shots and had eight points.</TE>
<TE>   "When Errick and Desmon shoot the way they're shooting -- they're
a big part of what we do -- it makes things tough for us," said USC
Coach Henry Bibby.</TE>
<TE>   USC's biggest lead was five points, 28-23, following a Smiley
three-pointer with 3:50 to play in the first half, and the Trojans'
last lead was at 35-33 on a Robert Hutchinson three-pointer at the
17:34 mark of the second half.</TE>
<TE>   "When we executed the offense," Craven said, "we had great looks
at the basket. The ball just was not going in. So we tried to
concentrate on the defensive end but they were making shots and our
defense [fell apart]. Our defensive rotation was terrible tonight."</TE>
<TE>   After holding the Gauchos (3-2) to 33.3% shooting from three-point
territory in the first half, the Trojans' perimeter defense collapsed
in the second, when Santa Barbara made 60% of its three-pointers.</TE>
<TE>   Gaucho junior small forward Branduinn Fullove led Santa Barbara
with 23 points.</TE>
<TE>   "They outplayed us," Bibby said, "beat us to every ball,
rebounding, shooting. They stayed within their structure. We're a
pretty good jump-shooting team ... just not tonight.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully there's not too many more lumps. We just couldn't make
a shot, just couldn't score tonight. We missed a lot of defensive
assignments ... had too many defensive breakdowns."</TE>
<TE>   It's enough to make a Big West Conference favorite walk around
with a steppingstone-sized chip on its shoulder, especially after
beating a team for the first time in 12 tries.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC's hopes of having its loss at Rhode Island expunged from the
record book were doused Tuesday, and the Trojans, hoping to play in
their third consecutive NCAA tournament for the first time in school
history, have to accept losing to a team expected to finish near the
bottom of the Atlantic 10.</TE>
<TE>   "The result of the game can't be changed," said USC senior
associate athletic director Daryl Gross, who spent Tuesday going over
possible actions with Pacific 10 officials.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a matter of 'You're right, you're right, you're right,'
but there's nothing we can do about it. We need to put some closure
to this in the right way. We want to support Henry and make sure
there's some acknowledgment from the A-10 that things went wrong
there."</TE>
<TE>   Bibby, who said the three-man Atlantic 10 officiating crew wanted
Rhode Island to win its first game in the Rams' new arena, has not
been reprimanded by the Pac-10 for his comments. Bibby had contended
that Rhode Island's 73-71 win should be vacated because the officials
failed to assess a technical foul on the Rams when the team,
cheerleaders and fans rushed the court with 2.2 seconds remaining.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Up Next</TE>
<TE>   Saturday vs. No. 15 Missouri (3-0) in Wooden Classic at Arrowhead
Pond, 4 p.m. -- The Trojans (2-2) lead the all-time series, 5-4, and
last played the Tigers in the 1995 Rainbow Classic, pulling out a
75-64 win. Missouri finished 24-12 last season after advancing to the
Elite Eight, where it lost to Oklahoma.</TE>

<HD>Chow Talks With Utah About Opening</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Norm Chow, USC's offensive coordinator, was selected Tuesday as one
of five finalists for the Broyles Award, presented annually to the
nation's top assistant coach.</LD>
<LD>   It's the second time Chow has been among the finalists -- and it
could be the last if Utah commits enough money to hire Chow as its
head coach, along with a staff of his choosing.</LD>
<LD>   Chow, who was recruiting in North Carolina on Tuesday,
acknowledged that he met with Chris Hill, Utah's athletic director,
on Monday.</LD>
<TE>   "It wasn't an interview for a job, it was a brief conversation,"
said Chow, who played for the Utes in 1965-67, coached at Brigham
Young for 27 seasons and interviewed for the head coaching position
at his alma mater in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Chow, Colorado offensive coordinator Shawn Watson, Notre Dame
defensive coordinator Kent Baer, Philadelphia Eagle offensive
coordinator Brad Childress and St. Louis Ram quarterbacks coach John
Ramsdell are thought to be candidates to replace Ron McBride, who was
fired last week. Utah defensive coordinator Kyle Whittingham and
Buffalo Bill quarterback coach Steve Kragthorpe also reportedly
expressed interest.</TE>
<TE>   Utah is expected to begin formally interviewing candidates next
week, Chow said.</TE>
<TE>   McBride earned $310,000 last season. Chow is earning about
$300,000 in the second year of a three-year contract with USC and is
likely to command a salary of at least $500,000 a year to join the
Utes.</TE>
<TE>   Hill has said that the university would tap a reserve fund or
booster contributions to make sure the school gets the coach it
desires. However, a potential stumbling block to Chow's hiring could
be salaries the longtime assistant might request for his staff.</TE>
<TE>   After he left BYU, Chow worked the 2000 season at North Carolina
State under Coach Chuck Amato. Chow earned $165,000 with the Wolfpack
before USC hired him in January 2001 and nearly doubled his salary.</TE>
<TE>   If Chow is hired by Utah, Pete Carroll's staff could take
additional hits.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Sarkisian, the Trojans' quarterbacks coach, played for Chow
at BYU. Keith Uperesa, who coaches offensive tackles and tight ends,
also played at BYU and was a graduate assistant there under Chow.</TE>
<TE>   The Broyles Award is named after former Arkansas coach Frank
Broyles.</TE>
<TE>   Other finalists are Baer, Ohio State defensive coordinator Mark
Dantonio, Boise State offensive coordinator Chris Peterson and
Georgia defensive coordinator Brian VanGorder.</TE>

<HD>Former Dodger Scouting Director Dies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>

<LD>Ben Wade, the former Dodger scouting director, died Monday after a
long battle with cancer. He was 80.</LD>
<LD>   Wade spent more than 30 years in the Dodgers' organization as a
player, scout and scouting director before retiring after the 1990
season.</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers signed Wade as a scout in 1962 and he was promoted to
director of scouting in 1973, a post he held until his retirement.</LD>
<TE>   "Ben was an important part of the Dodger family," team President
Bob Graziano said. "He and [former Dodger executives] Al Campanis and
Bill Schweppe really put together a strong organization for many
years and worked together well as a team. They will be sorely missed
by all of us in the organization."</TE>
<TE>   Among the players drafted during Wade's tenure as scouting
director were Mike Piazza, Rick Sutcliffe, Dave Stewart, Mike
Scioscia, Bob Welch, Mickey Hatcher, Steve Sax, Mike Marshall, Steve
Howe, Orel Hershiser, John Franco, John Wetteland, Eric Karros and
Eric Young.</TE>
<TE>   In the Wade era, the Dodgers became synonymous with National
League rookie-of-the-year awards. Sutcliffe, Howe, Fernando
Valenzuela and Sax swept the honors from 1979-82, and the team had a
run of five in a row shortly after Wade's retirement, beginning with
Karros and Piazza in 1992-93.</TE>
<TE>   Benjamin Styron Wade was born Nov. 26, 1922 in Morehead City, N.C.
A right-hander, he pitched in the majors for five years, including
parts of three seasons with the Brooklyn Dodgers. He also pitched for
the Chicago Cubs, St. Louis Cardinals and Pittsburgh Pirates.</TE>
<TE>   Funeral services will be held Monday at the Douglas and Zook
Mortuary in Monrovia.</TE>

<HD>Baffert Barn Adds Belmont Winner</HD>
<DH></DH>

<LD>Sarava, the colt who won this year's Belmont Stakes to prevent
trainer Bob Baffert's War Emblem from sweeping the Triple Crown, has
joined Baffert's horses at Santa Anita for a campaign that could lead
to the Breeders' Cup Classic at the track next October.</LD>
<LD>   In announcing the trainer switch, from Ken McPeek to Baffert, Gary
Drake, co-owner of Sarava, said that the main reason for the change
was that the Breeders' Cup would be run at Santa Anita.</LD>
<LD>   War Emblem won this year's Kentucky Derby and Preakness but, with
a $5-million bonus on the line, finished eighth in the Belmont after
a poor start. Sarava, who had never run in a graded stake, paid
$142.50 -- a record $2 win price -- in the Belmont.</LD>
<TE>   Sarava hasn't run since the Belmont. He suffered a hairline
fracture of a cannon bone during a workout at Churchill Downs in
mid-July.</TE>
<TE>   The colt was sold twice, for $190,000 and $250,000, before he
raced, and early this year, Drake, who lives in Louisville, Ky.,
bought a 50% interest for $250,000. Sarava is also owned by Paul and
Susan Roy of Surrey, England. Sarava lost all three starts on grass
in England as a 2-year-old before he was sent to the U.S. and
introduced to dirt.</TE>
