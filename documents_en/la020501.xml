<LD>Step into BMW's new 745i sedan and be blown away by the elegance of
the leather, brushed aluminum and cherry paneling. The plush 20-way
adjustable seats, lighted door handles and one-touch trunk closure
ooze luxury and practicality.</LD>
<LD>   But then start the car--if you can. No one I challenged could do
so without instruction.</LD>
<LD>   BMW's new flagship is so chock-full of new technology, most
prominently the joystick-like iDrive control for almost all the car's
functions, that it is certain to have a strong appeal to rocket
scientists. But it is likely to turn away many lesser mortals.</LD>
<TE>   Make no mistake, though. As a driving machine, the big Beemer
measures up to BMW's boast that it produces the ultimate.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent outing in the hilly Texas back country near San
Antonio, the German auto maker's 2002 745i, powered by a 4.4-liter,
325-horsepower V-8 engine with six-speed automatic transmission,
rocketed over roads and around curves so smoothly that many of the
assembled media test drivers failed to notice when speeds hit 100
mph. And an even more powerful 12-cylinder 760i is in the works.</TE>
<TE>   Step into the 745i, punch the start button (once you've figured
out how), and the engine springs to life with the familiar growl and
purr of a top BMW power plant.</TE>
<TE>   Acceleration is sensationally smooth, propelling the 4,376-pound
sedan from zero to 80 mph with barely any effort.</TE>
<TE>   Cracks and potholes seem blanketed in foam as the suspension gives
only hints of them: You feel the road's imperfections, but never
jarringly.</TE>
<TE>   Almost 4 inches wider than its predecessor, the 745i has a lower
center of gravity, and it hugs the curves and dips in narrow roads as
if it were on a rail.</TE>
<TE>   Steering is precise and effortless. All the driving controls--gear
shifter, pedals and steering wheel-mounted downshift button--are
comfortably placed and easy to get used to.</TE>
<TE>   BMW's engineers designed a cabin that cloaks riders in vault-like
silence when the windows go up. The car rides city streets and
straightaways like the plush limousine the 7-Series models always
have been, yet has superb cornering thanks to a stabilization system
that minimizes body roll.</TE>
<TE>   That's why it is easy to hit a curve while moving too fast.
Fortunately, there are enormous brakes that slow it all quickly.</TE>
<TE>   It is not the car's road manners but its looks and technology that
have created controversy about the newest 7-Series car.</TE>
<TE>   The design brought yelps of pain over curves and arcs where BMWs
have never had them. A rear end with a tall trunk--exaggerated by a
U-shaped lip--looks as if it were borrowed from an unrelated species.</TE>
<TE>   BMW says humans' average height increases a centimeter (0.4
inches) or so every 10 years. To make the 7-Series taller and provide
more headroom in the rear seats to accommodate that growth, engineers
had to make the car longer--a design move BMW did not want--or make
the trunk taller.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew we would have to make some assumptions and take some
risks," said Chris Bangle, the American who heads Munich-based BMW's
design department. "We concentrated on what would be the best users
environment."</TE>
<TE>   But it's the high-tech aspect of the car, an area on which BMW has
always prided itself, that will be most polarizing to potential
owners of this $70,000 Beemer.</TE>
<TE>   For starters, there's starting.</TE>
<TE>   The new 7-Series is ignited by inserting a fat rectangular plastic
key into the dash, then simultaneously pressing the brake pedal and
pushing an ignition button.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's getting it in gear.</TE>
<TE>   There are four levers arranged in, behind and around the steering
wheel. The one on the upper right, in the 2 o'clock position, is the
gearshift lever. (The others operate turn signals, windshield wipers
and cruise control.)</TE>
<TE>   Pull the shift lever toward you and push up to get into drive.
Pushing down puts the car in reverse, and pushing a button on the
lever puts the transmission into park. It sounds clumsy, but the
gears are clearly marked on the dashboard and one soon gets used to
it.</TE>
<TE>   Whether and how easily parking valets will be able to drive the
car probably depends on the neighborhood in which they work. Staff at
the Bel-Air Country Club will get used to it far more quickly than
will their counterparts at the Detroit Athletic Club.</TE>
<TE>   The key fob actually is a key within a key. You hand the
fob-shaped ignition key to a valet. Inside it is a more
conventionally shaped metal key you can slide out and take with you
to keep the trunk, glove compartment and center console locked.</TE>
<TE>   Don't ever lose that fob, though. You can't start the car without
it, and it contains a wealth of information. If you get a "check
engine" light, for instance, just hand the fob to your dealer's
service representative, who can retrieve diagnostic and service
history information stored on a chip within it.</TE>
<TE>   BMW says 7-Series customers are early adapters who crave gadgetry.
The iDrive certainly will satisfy those cravings. It makes the 745i
the techiest car out there.</TE>
<TE>   The iDrive controls several hundred functions, including climate
system, audio entertainment, navigation and a hands-free cell phone
that comes with the car and connects to a port in the center console.</TE>
<TE>   The phone, based on Motorola's Timeport, is designed to work with
the car's computers. Hook it up, and it uploads your phone numbers
into the iDrive so you can twist and spin the knob to dial the
desired contact. Or you can use the voice recognition feature to tell
the phone whom to call.</TE>
<TE>   Though the iDrive knob is easy to grasp, its operation isn't.</TE>
<TE>   New users will continually navigate between functions, make
mistakes and get kicked out of the system by its computer, and wind
up pounding the knob in frustration.</TE>
<TE>   That said, most owners who drive the car for more than a month
probably will memorize the half a dozen or so functions they use
frequently, such as changing radio stations and temperatures, and
won't bother with the few hundred other things they could do through
iDrive, such as clock themselves from zero to 60.</TE>
<TE>   But are there all that many people out there willing to spend a
month learning to use their new $70,000 car?</TE>
<TE>   There's plenty of non-iDrive technology in the 7-Series too.</TE>
<TE>   By punching a button on the steering wheel, drivers can use thumb
controls to downshift and lock into a gear--holding the car in third,
for instance, while winding through twisty roads. Hit the button a
second time and the transmission takes over again.</TE>
<TE>   Those 20-way adjustable seats are something else. There's even a
function for adjusting the upper thigh support, and it tickles a bit
when the front portion of the lower cushion starts sliding forward.</TE>
<TE>   Other appointments are just plain cool.</TE>
<TE>   When you use the remote key to unlock the doors from a distance,
each door handle is discreetly lighted by a tiny bulb. If you don't
shut the doors hard enough and they're still open a crack, the system
senses this and automatically closes them completely.</TE>
<TE>   Some complaints: When I parked close to a curb, the obstacle
sensor kept beeping, even though I wanted to keep the engine idling
while parked in that position. When I was in the passenger seat, my
knee kept hitting the six-disc CD changer's eject button, dislodging
the cartridge into my lap.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the parking brake. A no-brainer in most cars, it is
operated by pressing a conveniently located button on the 7-Series'
dash, but that operation requires four pages of explanation in the
owner's manual, half of them detailing how to disengage it if the
battery dies. The process involves a screwdriver and a wrench.</TE>
<TE>   All in all, this is a fabulous road car with terrific handling and
performance. But if your grasp of modern technology stops short of
programming your VCR, then you'll probably want to steer clear.</TE>

<HD>After a Detour, GM Joins Fuel Cell Program</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly 18 months after the California Fuel Cell Partnership opened
its doors in West Sacramento, General Motors Corp. has moved into its
offices and brought its first fuel cell vehicle to the party.</LD>
<LD>   The delay by the world's largest auto maker in joining the other
members of the partnership hasn't helped it with environmentalists,
who see GM as a foe of the so-called green car movement.</LD>
<LD>   The company, after all, has filed state and federal lawsuits in
California to block implementation of the state's Zero Emission
Vehicle Mandate. GM says it dislikes being forced by government
agencies to produce any type of vehicle and that the battery-powered
electric cars that are the only vehicles that now meet the terms of
the ZEV Mandate are uneconomical.</LD>
<TE>   GM says its participation in the fuel cell partnership shows it
isn't anti-environment, despite the lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   "We're serious abut getting fuel cell vehicles on the road," GM
spokesman Donn Walker said. "We see the handwriting on the wall. This
isn't just a sop to environmentalists."</TE>
<TE>   Fuel cell vehicles differ from other electric cars in that they
don't need batteries or recharging because they produce the
electricity on board the vehicle. The fuel cell generates current
from hydrogen that is either produced on board the vehicle from other
fuels, such as methane or gasoline, or is pumped aboard and stored in
tanks--just as gasoline is stored in tanks in traditional vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   GM, which delivered its 2-year-old HydroGen1 fuel cell vehicle to
the partnership last week, says it is the first of several advanced
vehicles the company will demonstrate in California this year.</TE>
<TE>   Another is the fuel cell-powered Chevrolet S-10 compact pickup the
company was scheduled to unveil in New York this morning. It uses
gasoline as the source of its hydrogen--something else
environmentalists dislike--while the HydroGen1 uses liquid hydrogen
pumped directly from a storage tank.</TE>
<TE>   GM has been pushing hard for development of a system to extract
hydrogen from gasoline, arguing that it would be far easier and
faster to get fuel cells into wide use if the nation's gasoline
delivery system could be used. Extracting the hydrogen could be done
either at a fixed site, such as a gas station, or on board the
vehicle itself.</TE>
<TE>   The problem environmentalists have with GM's gasoline processor is
that it isn't a zero-emission system at either end. Gasoline is a
hydrocarbon, and heating hydrocarbon fuels to the point they break
down and release their hydrogen content still creates emissions.
Also, using gasoline as the principal source of hydrogen for fuel
cells requires continued production and refining of crude oil.</TE>
<TE>   GM says the system eliminates "virtually all regulated emissions"
at the tailpipe and improves fuel economy by 50% over that of a
comparable vehicle with a standard internal-combustion engine.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides agree that, so far, there's no such thing as a
completely emission-free vehicle because production of the
hydrogen--like production of gasoline or even electricity for plug-in
battery cars--still creates some air pollution at the processing
site.</TE>
<TE>   The debate over fuel types is just one obstacle in the drive to
get fuel cell cars into retail dealerships. There still is a lot of
work to do on the fuel cells themselves to get them ready for
automotive use, and that's what the California Fuel Cell Partnership
is all about.</TE>
<TE>   It is not a development effort--fuel cell technology has been
around for almost a century--but rather a testing program in which
auto makers can work separately or jointly, as they see fit, to
figure out how to make fuel cells ramp up to operating temperatures
faster and operate reliably and at full efficiency in a broad range
of climates.</TE>
<TE>   About the same time GM was pulling the HydroGen1 into the garage
in West Sacramento, the partnership was holding opening ceremonies
for its new methanol fueling station. Methanol, primarily produced
from natural gas but also from resources such as municipal waste or
sewage sludge, is the second of three planned fuels for the fuel cell
vehicle demonstrations taking place through 2003. Direct hydrogen was
the first, and gasoline will be the third.</TE>
<TE>   The initial methanol-fed fuel cell vehicle provided by a
partnership member is DaimlerChrysler's Necar 5, based on the
company's European A-Class subcompact. At present, the eight auto
maker members of the partnership are testing 16 fuel cell vehicles.</TE>

<HD>Unwieldy iDrive May Inspire Users to Twist--and Shout</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It looks like a finely machined body part from the original
Terminator, resting there on the BMW 745i's center console.</LD>
<LD>   Your palm fits comfortably around it.</LD>
<LD>   But the iDrive knob, which moves up and down in the eight key
compass directions, and also spins left and right, may have your mind
spinning too as you try to set temperature controls, radio stations
and navigation destinations.</LD>
<TE>   Information conjured up with the knob is displayed on a small
screen in the center of the dashboard.</TE>
<TE>   Its complexity moved one executive at a rival auto maker recently
to crack, "iDrive--you operate."</TE>
<TE>   Say, for instance, you want to adjust the radio's bass output.</TE>
<TE>   Push the iDrive knob twice (once to call up the screen, once to
accept the disclaimer that the system should be operated only when
traffic permits). Next, pull the knob toward the rear seat to select
"entertainment," then spin it past the AM and FM selections to
"memory." Push it again, spin to "bass," push again, then spin to
select a bass level.</TE>
<TE>   It was an eight-step process that wasn't intuitive enough for me
or my driving partner to figure out. We had to be tutored when we
couldn't find directions in the owner's manual.</TE>
<TE>   Lots about iDrive isn't exactly intuitive.</TE>
<TE>   I used it to advance from song to song when a CD was in the
single-disc player, but I could not do the same when a CD was in the
six-disc changer. I had to resort to using the forward button on the
dashboard next to the single-disc player to advance tracks on CDs in
the changer.</TE>
<TE>   Other functions include setting and viewing data such as elapsed
mileage or fuel consumption; calling the BMW Assist help center if
you get lost; or calling your dealer for service issues--including
instructions on using the iDrive.</TE>
<TE>   Drivers also use it to turn the dynamic traction control on and
off, change the language in which information is displayed, reset the
clock or set a speed warning that beeps to remind them they've hit
the speed they've chosen.</TE>
<TE>   Navigation is the toughest nut to crack. It's time consuming, and
I was continually overspinning when trying to input data. No doubt
accidents will happen among new users of iDrive who are concentrating
too hard on twirling the dial. Though BMW makes you push a button to
log a promise that you won't operate the system when driving
conditions are dicey, it opted not to actually lock you out. You can
operate it at 120 mph if you want.</TE>
<TE>   Seeing the navigation maps was almost as difficult as programming
the system. I found the screen too small, even when maximized,
compared with systems such as those on Acura and Lexus models.</TE>
<TE>   BMW says it plans to migrate iDrive across all its models.</TE>
<TE>   The folks in Bavaria should consider making it purely optional.</TE>
<GT></GT>

spun to control its many functions. But setting options can be a
daunting task.</CP>

<HD>Falling, Flying Debris Can Turn the Road Into a Dangerous
Obstacle Course</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While driving the freeways in Southern California, you are apt to see
the most amazing road debris.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, there's so much of it that you also are apt to be
hit by it, or to run into it.</LD>
<LD>   Everything from couches and refrigerators to dog houses and
dishwashers have tumbled out of pickup trucks. Ladders and mattresses
have flown off car roofs. Delivery trucks have spilled bottles of
beer and tipped tankers have spewed thousands of gallons of gasoline.</LD>
<TE>   "You name it, we've seen it along the roads. We've even found dead
bodies," says California Highway Patrol public affairs officer Scott
Ellison.</TE>
<TE>   All that dangerous debris can cause accidents and create marathon
traffic jams.</TE>
<TE>   It's so worrisome that the CHP has stepped up efforts to spot
vehicles carrying unsafe and improperly secured loads. Officers also
are looking out for trucks and cars that are driven recklessly,
particularly vehicles that pose a danger when they cut in front of
big rigs on the freeways.</TE>
<TE>   Under California Vehicle Code 24002, "it is unlawful to operate
any vehicle or combination of vehicles which is in an unsafe
condition, or which is not safely loaded, and which presents an
immediate safety hazard."</TE>
<TE>   If the wind catches a loose ladder in a pickup truck and it sails
through your windshield, or a tire spins off a car and careens into
another vehicle, the results can be devastating, says CHP spokeswoman
Colleen Richardson.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, CHP motorcycle officer Steve Licon was heading home at
night in Riverside County when he hit a large metal locker lying in
the middle of the dimly lighted road. He suffered three broken
vertebrae and minor internal injuries, said Richardson. It's unknown
when he will be able to return to duty.</TE>
<TE>   Drivers who fail to properly secure items on their vehicles can be
cited, and if their failure to secure a load safely results in a
fatal accident, they could face involuntary manslaughter charges,
says Sgt. Steve Doan of the Orange County Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   And "innocent" passers-by aren't always that innocent under the
law. The driver who slams into road debris during daylight hours
could be at fault if the item was stationary and could have been
avoided, says Richardson.</TE>
<TE>   When drivers are transporting items--whether it's heavy furniture
or Christmas trees--they need to make sure the load is secured, says
Sgt. Dusty Morrison of the CHP's commercial vehicle unit.</TE>
<TE>   A frequent problem, he says, is people who load their vehicles
with sheets of plywood or other wind-catching items and don't tie
them down properly. Or worse, Morrison says, they load their
purchases into the bed of a pickup without securing them at all,
thinking they are heavy enough they won't blow out.</TE>
<TE>   Often, they discover the load isn't as secure as they thought. It
comes loose on the freeway and falls out into traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Morrison learned firsthand how hazardous this can be when his
patrol car was hit by a flying sheet of plywood on the San Bernardino
Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw this 4-foot-by-8-foot piece of wood in the air. A chunk of
it came right through my side window, hit my arm and I got glass in
my eyes. My biggest fear was [losing] control of the car," he
recalls.</TE>
<TE>   Whoever was carrying the plywood kept driving. "Maybe they didn't
even know they lost it."</TE>
<TE>   The CHP advises motorists to practice defensive driving by keeping
an eye on what's ahead on the road. When driving, it's best to scan
ahead one-third to one-half mile so you can change lanes if you spot
something in the roadway, says Paul Gonzales of the Auto Club of
Southern California. "It's better to change lanes than slam on the
brakes, because the driver behind you may not see what's going on and
hit you."</TE>
<TE>   But be careful changing lanes. Serious injury accidents often
happen when drivers swerve to avoid hitting an object in the road.
They collide with another vehicle or lose control and spin off the
freeway.</TE>
<TE>   "Keep a cool head," says Morrison. If it's not a large object,
it's better to ride over it than swerve erratically. "It may cause
damage to your vehicle, but it is better than causing an accident."</TE>

<HD>In Bloom Again</HD>
<DH>Since his '60s heyday with the band Love, Arthur Lee has
endured rumors and prison. Now he's on the comeback trail.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD CROMELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Nice stripes!"</LD>
<LD>   The shout from the packed audience at Spaceland seemed to silence
the room for an instant. On the club's small stage, Arthur Lee, who
had just removed his jacket to reveal a shirt patterned with thin
horizontal stripes, looked quizzically into the crowd as if trying to
interpret the comment.</LD>
<LD>   Was it a joking allusion to Lee's recent five-year stay in state
prison on a firearms charge? And would it unnerve the notoriously
volatile singer, sending the latest comeback by the onetime king of
L.A. rock skidding into the rubble of his career just minutes after
it had begun?</LD>
<TE>   "Nice stripes?" Lee repeated. "That's easy for you to say!"</TE>
<TE>   Lee smiled, the audience laughed, and the band kicked into another
one of the songs that have kept his cult legend alive through thick
and thin for 35 years. The comeback was back on. In his first
performance in six years, just a few months after checking out of
Pleasant Valley State Prison in Coalinga, the 57-year-old Lee was
back where he started--enchanting the youth of Los Angeles with music
that was raw and elegant, richly imaginative and utterly original.</TE>
<TE>   This might not be the unlikeliest resurrection in pop history, but
it will do for this year anyway. Lee (who plays tonight at the
Knitting Factory) hadn't simply faded away after his 1960s
heyday--he'd become an all-purpose archetype of the classic rock
casualty, a convenient subject for any rumor that would stick. He'd
become a homeless panhandler, went one story. Or he'd shot himself in
the head on stage. Or was strung out on heroin.</TE>
<TE>   "Aw, man, that kind of stuff is crazy," Lee says a couple of weeks
after the Spaceland date. "I read that stuff while I was away....
They said I blew my brains out at the end of '7 and 7 Is.' I couldn't
very well have done that and be sitting here talking to you. It's all
this ridiculous stuff. We hung our road manager. All kind of crazy
things."</TE>
<TE>   Given all the mystery and the history, you're prepared for lunch
with a basket case as a meeting with Lee at a Studio City deli
approaches, but during a 45-minute interview he's clear and lucid
enough, if somehow slightly distant. He's never been crazy about
interviews.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to do this stuff," he says. "I saw a Jimi Hendrix
documentary--who cares what he says? I don't care what he says or
bought in 1960, whatever it was. Or what a basketball player has to
say at halftime. Make the shot, man. Give the guy the guitar, man.
One-two-three, hit it, man, let's do the song. I'd rather play the
music and let it speak for me."</TE>
<TE>   He shakes his head, which is wrapped in an American flag bandanna
and crowned by a black derby with a leopard-print band. His western
shirt is an eye-catching blend of beige and vivid brick red,
decorated with embroidered flowers. Others might tone things down at
his age and under his circumstances, but Lee has always been one of a
kind.</TE>
<TE>   A teenage free spirit, Lee finished up at Dorsey High School and
hit Hollywood in the mid-'60s, a hippie prototype whose musical
tastes ranged from jazz to classical, blues to Beatles. He and his
band, soon to settle on the name Love, quickly became the toast of
the exploding L.A. music scene.</TE>
<TE>   "Arthur Lee and Love, they were in charge," recalls Ray Manzarek,
the keyboardist of the Doors, who succeeded Love as the biggest band
in town. "We would see them play the Whisky A Go-Go and think that
one day we wanted to be like Love.</TE>
<TE>   "They had those terrific songs. Arthur himself was enigmatic. He
wasn't particularly outgoing with the audience, but he was very
intense and sort of possessed by darker forces."</TE>
<TE>   When Elektra Records released Love's self-titled debut album in
1966, such songs as "My Little Red Book" (a Burt Bacharach-Hal David
composition) and the searing single "7 and 7 Is" became part of the
city's aural fabric.</TE>
<TE>   The second album, "Da Capo," which is being reissued on May 13,
marked the first time a single track ("Revelation") filled an entire
side of an LP. Lee's talented partner in Love, the late
singer-guitarist Bryan McLean, contributed the key tracks "Alone
Again Or" and "Old Man" to 1967's "Forever Changes," an ambitious set
of orchestrated pop that's come to be regarded as one of rock's
overlooked classics.</TE>
<TE>   Lee is still revered in music circles. The Scottish group Belle &amp;
Sebastian sometimes plays "Alone Again Or," and Lenny Kravitz revives
"My Flash on You" from the first album. Led Zeppelin's Robert Plant
cited Lee and Love in his acceptance speech at the Rock and Roll Hall
of Fame in 1995. At Spaceland, the songs sounded like music that's
being created today all over the indie-rock map, especially in their
mix of yearning idealism and dark undercurrents.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, that's pretty much the way life is, isn't it?" Lee says. "I
tried to write it as I saw it and felt it. Eerie and happy and all
those things. I wanted something that would pass the test of time,
and I think I might have done it. I don't know."</TE>
<TE>   Although Love ruled L.A., Lee's indifference to touring and other
promotional obligations kept the band from reaching a national
audience, and as drug problems undermined the band, he moved on to
other lineups and lesser works. "False Start" in 1970 included a
collaboration with his old friend Hendrix, and he released a solo
album, "Vindicator," in 1972, but he became increasingly elusive and
was largely written off by a music business that he'd come to
distrust.</TE>
<TE>   "Arthur's an eccentric," says drummer Bruce Gary, who played with
Lee in some Love lineups from the '70s and '80s and remains a friend
of the singer. "He's an artist, and he lives for his music. I can
compare him to other people I was close to, like Harry Nilsson for
instance. They went through strange periods in their lives. But when
it came to playing he always gave 100%."</TE>
<TE>   In the '80s, Lee left the music world further behind as he cared
for his stepfather, who was suffering from cancer. (He also racked up
a felony conviction for malicious setting of a fire, which would
later come back to haunt him.)</TE>
<TE>   Lee emerged in the '90s, hiring the Los Angeles pop band Baby
Lemonade to back him in 1993 and hooking up with a new manager, all
of whom were surprised when Lee told them he had to go to court.</TE>
<TE>   There he was convicted in 1996 for negligent discharge of a
firearm and being a felon in possession of a firearm. Under
provisions of the three-strikes law, his sentence topped out at 12
years and four months.</TE>
<TE>   Last October an appeals court ruled that he was entitled to a new
trial because of prosecution misconduct. Instead of risking another
trial, Lee, who has always maintained his innocence, pleaded no
contest in March and was sentenced to time served. He hopes to have
his record reduced to a misdemeanor later this year.</TE>
<TE>   Prison isn't his favorite topic.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something that I'm gonna have to answer for a while in
interviews, but let sleeping dogs lie. I don't have any grudges or
anything.... In this world bad things happen, and that happened to
me. I had to discipline myself to have a whole lot of patience and
faith in God, and my attorney of course."</TE>
<TE>   So now it's comeback time. Of course the story will be better if
it goes on for a while. Lee is looking forward to recording his new
material, but for the old fans there will be shows packed with the
classic songs, and plans to add some strings and horns to the band to
celebrate the 35th anniversary of "Forever Changes." If Brian Wilson
can be guided into the headliner's seat at the Hollywood Bowl with
"Pet Sounds," anything is possible.</TE>
<TE>   His friends think it will work.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a different person," says Baby Lemonade guitarist Mike
Randle. "Arthur is at peace with himself. Arthur realizes what's
important. Arthur's interested in playing music and writing music,
making records and playing shows.... Playing this music is euphoric,
and then you see how dedicated Arthur is in delivering the music. He
doesn't mess around, even in rehearsal."</TE>
<TE>   At the deli, Lee's cell phone rings. He speaks briefly and hangs
up.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm trying to get a new place," he explains. "They ran a check on
me and they had the wrong Social Security number, of all things." He
laughs. "I'm glad it was just that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

Hollywood, 7021 Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood, 8 p.m. $20. (323)

<HD>Networks Already Preparing for 9/11 Anniversary</HD>
<DH>Television* The coverage will be extensive, with ABC
looking at providing daylong programming.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Television is already planning for the one-year anniversary of the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, and it is safe to expect that there will
be plenty of coverage.</LD>
<LD>   ABC News, re-creating somewhat its successful 24 hours of
millennium coverage, said Tuesday it will air a full day of Sept. 11
commemorative programming, starting with "Good Morning America" and
going through midnight with "Nightline," with breaks only for local
news.</LD>
<LD>   Other networks aren't as far along in their preparations, although
NBC News is planning to air an extended special in prime time, on
Sept. 10, as well as coverage throughout the day of Sept. 11.</LD>
<TE>   There will be special programming on entertainment cable networks
too, including student films on the event that will be seen on
Showtime.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew that there will be a certain number of events to
commemorate, so we decided to try to do the whole day, because it
deserves it and because we can do a good job," said Paul Friedman,
executive vice president at ABC News.</TE>
<TE>   Anchor Peter Jennings will moderate "Answering Children's
Questions," a follow-up town hall meeting to the similar special he
hosted on Sept. 15, 2001, the Saturday following the attacks. Many of
the same children and panelists are expected to participate, and
Jennings will look at how their questions and concerns have changed
over the year.</TE>
<TE>   In prime time, ABC is planning a minute-by-minute reconstruction
of what happened before and during the attacks in New York and
Washington. Friedman said there are also "a lot of really, really
interesting stories about people, how they've survived and how
they're handling it."</TE>
<TE>   The ABC programming will include commercials--something ABC didn't
have in the days following the attack.</TE>

<HD>Mark Rydell: On Acting, Directing and Woody</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mark Rydell believes that all good film directors should act in a
movie from time to time. "I think directors need to stay in touch
with the agony of narcissism," he said with a laugh.</LD>
<LD>   "Actors are extremely brave," Rydell said. "If they are really
good, they are willing to expose all of their personal secrets.... I
think directors need to know what it feels like so they can best
nurture actors to productive performances."</LD>
<LD>   While directing such acclaimed films as "On Golden Pond," "The
Reivers" and "The Rose," Rydell has managed to emerge from behind the
camera to act in several films, most notably as the brutal villain in
Robert Altman's 1973 film noir "The Long Goodbye." And now Rydell is
in the ensemble of Woody Allen's comedy "Hollywood Ending," which
will open Friday.</LD>
<TE>   Rydell calls Allen "a comedic legend" and compares him to Charlie
Chaplin. But when Allen called him about the part he told Rydell:
"I'm not a very good director. I am a good caster. I know how to pick
my actors and trust them."</TE>
<TE>   In "Hollywood Ending," Rydell turns in a sparkling comedic
performance as Al Hack, the longtime agent of Val Waxman (Allen), a
neurotic, nervous film director whose career is on the skids. When
Waxman suffers from hysterical blindness before starting production
on his big-budget comeback film, Al must shield the fact from the
cast and crew.</TE>
<TE>   Though not close friends, Rydell and Allen had known each other
over the years. Allen, he said, had asked him on occasion to act in
his films, but Rydell was busy directing his own projects. But when
"Hollywood Ending" came around, Rydell was available. "He called and
said, 'I have a great part for you.' I said, 'Send me the script.'"</TE>
<TE>   Allen, who rarely gives out complete scripts to his actors, paused
when he heard Rydell's request. "Then he said, 'OK.'" The next day a
script arrived at his Marina del Rey home with a messenger whose duty
it was not to leave Rydell's side until he had read the script.</TE>
<TE>   The 68-year-old Rydell, who also is West Coast co-artistic
director of the Actors Studio, likes to rehearse his actors before he
begins directing a film. "I come from the school of sitting around
the table for two weeks examining every detail of the material,
working out relationships with the actors, so they know what they are
doing, bringing them to locations, so they can get comfortable."</TE>
<TE>   Working with Allen was a totally different experience. "He doesn't
rehearse," Rydell said. "He will have a four- or five-page scene and
he says, 'Learn the dialogue.' Of course I learned it. You come on
the set and he'll say, 'Walk me in. You go over there and then you go
into the kitchen and get this. OK. Roll.' So you're thrust into the
stormy scene of uncertainty which does mobilize a kind of
electrifying vitality and energy because it is very improvisational."</TE>
<TE>   Rydell would wait for Allen, whom he described as friendly but
withdrawn, to comment on what he had done in any given scene. "It's
natural to turn to the director for that moment of approval" after
the scene, Rydell said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something I learned from Katharine Hepburn and Henry Fonda,"
he said of his "On Golden Pond" experience. "I was somewhat
intimidated by having to tell these legends when they were wrong. So
after the first scene they turned to me with the innocent eyes of a
19-year-old with a hunger of approval. It made me feel, 'Oh I see, if
you are a really good actor you don't know what you have done. You
get lost in the moment.'"</TE>
<TE>   As Rydell recalls, after his scene, "Woody never said a word to
me."</TE>
<TE>   Rydell clearly gets a kick out of acting. His blue eyes dance as
he talks affectionately about his "Hollywood Ending" experience, as
well as about the satisfaction he receives teaching playwrights,
directors and actors every week at the Actors Studio.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Rydell is among a handful of film directors who seem to
enjoy acting as much as directing. Sydney Pollack, the Oscar-winning
director of "Out of Africa," is currently in "Changing Lanes" and has
a recurring role on "Will &amp; Grace." He also has worked with Allen
before, in "Husbands and Wives." Martin Scorsese was in "Round
Midnight" (1986) and "Quiz Show" (1994). Sir Richard Attenborough, an
Oscar-winning director for "Gandhi," returned to acting in the '90s,
appearing in the first two "Jurassic Park" blockbusters and playing
Kris Kringle in the remake of "Miracle on 34th Street." And Quentin
Tarantino acted on Broadway in "Wait Until Dark."</TE>
<TE>   'Directing Is a Very Paternal Occupation'</TE>
<TE>   Born and raised in the Bronx, Rydell trained to be a pianist at
the Juilliard School of Music and began his career in the early '50s
as a jazz pianist in New York and Chicago. He left that world behind
because of the proliferation of drugs among the musicians. "Heroin
was the drug of choice," he said. "Knowing that I have an addict's
personality in that a little is good but a lot is better, I knew I
was in danger. So I went back to college and went to the Neighborhood
Playhouse" in New York.</TE>
<TE>   The minute he started acting classes he knew he wanted to be a
director.</TE>
<TE>   "I enjoy leading," he said. "I am a good father. I have three
children. Directing is a very paternal occupation. You have to have a
healthy environment for our children to grow in. You have to lead
them in a way that they don't resent or rebel against."</TE>
<TE>   James Lipton, host of the Bravo series "Inside the Actors Studio"
and dean of the studio's drama school at New School University in New
York, has known Rydell for more than 40 years. "We were both actors
in soap operas together," he said. "He is a wonderful actor. He is
one of those four or five directors along with Sidney Lumet who are
known as 'actors' directors...."</TE>
<TE>   "There are few directors who really understand and who can
encourage the actor and when the actor needs guidance can give it to
the actor in terms other than 'just stand up now and walk two
paces'--all of those dumb directions."</TE>
<TE>   His directing methods have paid off handsomely. Rydell's films
have garnered 26 Academy Award nominations and 31 Golden Globe
nominations. Both Hepburn and Fonda won Oscars for "On Golden Pond"
(1981). Bette Midler received her two Oscar nominations--for "The
Rose" (1979) and "For the Boys" (1991)--working with Rydell. And
earlier this year, James Franco received the Golden Globe for his
performance playing the title role in the TNT movie "James Dean."
Rydell received an Oscar nomination for directing "On Golden Pond"
and was nominated for a Directors Guild of America Award for "James
Dean."</TE>
<TE>   Rydell cut his directing teeth in the '60s doing such episodic TV
series as "Ben Casey," "Gunsmoke" and "I Spy." He made the transition
to feature films with "The Fox" (1968), an erotic drama based on D.H.
Lawrence's novella. "The wise producers at the time would seek out
hot television directors because you didn't have to pay them very
much," said Rydell. "I was a very successful TV director. I had a lot
of awards. I was sent this script because they couldn't afford a
major director."</TE>
<TE>   His next film, "The Reivers" (1969), starred Steve McQueen and
Rupert Crosse, who received an Oscar nomination for best supporting
actor. Both of the actors died at a young age. "I was thinking
recently Steve and Rupert and I, we put $100 in the pot every week,"
Rydell recalled. "If you smoked you didn't get the money. I won every
week. They both smoked, and they both died of cancer."</TE>
<TE>   Rydell says McQueen was the toughest actor he's ever directed. "I
was in school with him at the Neighborhood Playhouse," said Rydell.
"He was paranoid. He thought everybody was out to do him in. It was
very difficult to deal with him, but he was the most extraordinary
screen personality."</TE>
<TE>   In dealing with Allen, the gregarious Rydell said he "forced
himself" on the director. "I faced this problem, he's so withdrawn. I
thought how am I going to make it seem like [our characters] are like
brothers--in the picture we were so close. So I grabbed him, I hugged
him. I saw the crew over his shoulder alarmed that anyone had the
audacity to touch him."</TE>

<HD>Baron Collected With an Eye Toward America</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza, who died Saturday at age 81
at his home on the northern Mediterranean coast of Spain, was the
greatest art collector of the second half of the 20th century. Unlike
his biggest rival for the title, L.A.'s Norton Simon, Thyssen had a
head start--namely, a stunning collection of 525 Old Master paintings
assembled by his father, son of a legendary Ruhr steel magnate, on
which to build. When the father died in 1947, the stellar collection
was divided among his children and heirs; but Hans Heinrich, the
eldest and the one obsessed, spent more than a decade buying back
everything he could that had been dispersed among his family.</LD>
<LD>   Then, over the next several decades, he expanded the collection by
a thousand more paintings, give or take a few.</LD>
<LD>   Jan van Eyck, Piero della Francesca, Albrecht Durer, Raphael,
Caravaggio--not a bad start on which to amass a huge hoard. The
younger Thyssen added Petrus Christus, Duccio, Titian, Tintoretto,
Lorenzo Lotto, El Greco, Watteau and Goya. The Impressionists, too,
and the Post-Impressionists. And Picasso. And the Fauves, German
Expressionists and Abstract Expressionists. And on and on--pictures
that are not simply by impressive names but are also, more often than
not, impressive examples from the individual artist's body of work.</LD>
<TE>   Still, one facet of Thyssen's significance as a collector stands
apart from this staggering litany of European masterpieces. It is not
often enough remarked that the baron also assembled an impressive
collection of late 18th to early 20th century American paintings.
They range from three portraits by John Singleton Copley (1738-1815)
to three nature abstractions by Georgia O'Keeffe (1887-1986). To an
American audience, this might not seem odd, given an immensely rich
collector of such acquisitive gusto. But Thyssen was a European, and
to Europeans the paintings produced in the United States before World
War II have typically been regarded (when they're regarded at all) as
minor at best and hopelessly provincial at worst.</TE>
<TE>   There's no mystery as to why. When cultural self-preservation is
at stake, the Old World instinctively fends off the New. Think of it
like this: Most prewar American art is to Europe what most pre-1980s
L.A. art is to New York.</TE>
<TE>   Among all the great museums of Europe, name one that can claim an
important collection of 18th, 19th and early 20th century American
art. You'll find a Benjamin West here, a John Singer Sargent there,
and Mary Cassatt was of course an American in Paris. Whistler's tonal
meditation on his mom famously hangs in the Louvre.</TE>
<TE>   Lots of continental museums abundantly feature contemporary
American art. But, if you're in the European Union and want to see
some Edward Hoppers, you have to go to Madrid. Today, there's only
one exceptional collection of earlier American art on public view in
Europe, and it will be found in assorted rooms on the first floor and
in galleries 29 and 30 on the second floor of the Thyssen-Bornemisza
Museum, which was established as part of the Prado a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   When Thyssen let it be known in the 1980s that he was searching
for a permanent public home for his collection, which had been
installed for years in his private museum at his villa in Lugano,
Switzerland, museum directors and government officials the world over
stampeded to his door. (The exception was his home country, where
sentiment seemed to be that the local billionaire could well afford
to make his private museum public without their help--a view that
ranks high on any list of penny-wise, pound-foolish decisions.) Among
the suitors was the Getty, then in the throes of erecting its
Brentwood acropolis.</TE>
<TE>   The Getty had plenty of money to offer--far more than the $400
million or so that Spain eventually put up to acquire the art (valued
at $2 billion) and refurbish a palace by the Prado Museum to house
it. But money isn't everything, especially when you already have a
lot of it. Needless to say, it would have been very nice to be able
to ride the tram up to the Getty Center and find the Thyssen
collection waiting at the top. But although the collector had an eye
for early American painting, he had no binding ties to the United
States. An affiliation with the Prado, one of the great institutions
of Europe, is tough competition.</TE>
<TE>   Envy aside, it's good how things worked out. A home for the
collection in Madrid is distinctive in a way that a museum just about
anywhere would be if it had a comprehensive collection of L.A. art.
The name Thyssen is synonymous with the breadth and quality of Old
Master painting, but for Europe the American collection is what makes
his museum unique.</TE>

<DH>'Green Dragon,' from Timothy and Tony Bui, recalls life for
post-war Vietnamese immigrants taken to U.S. bases.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIVIAN LETRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tens of thousands of Vietnamese refugees reached the same turning
point in their lives in 1975: Where would they call home?</LD>
<LD>   The question and answer filled some with dread and others with
optimism as they fled Vietnam after the war and crowded into refugee
camps throughout the United States. Most were brought to Camp
Pendleton Marine Base, north of San Diego.</LD>
<LD>   Timed with the 27th anniversary of the fall of Saigon, the film
"Green Dragon" opens today and encapsulates the initial Vietnamese
experience in America during the refugees' weeks- and sometimes
months-long stays in makeshift military camps.</LD>
<TE>   Director Timothy Linh Bui, who teamed with his brother, Tony Bui,
to co-write the screenplay, regards those months at camp as being in
"purgatory," a transitional place where souls suffered, awaiting
liberation. News of either a safe return to their homeland or a
sponsor to help them permanently resettle in the states were the
choices. Most chose the latter.</TE>
<TE>   The brothers are best known for "Three Seasons," a triple award
winner at the 1999 Sundance Film Festival (grand jury award, audience
award and best cinematography), that Tony directed and Timothy
produced.</TE>
<TE>   "The camp is like a bridge, and once you go to the other side, you
step off that bridge into the unknown. It was hard to imagine a
future without Vietnam," said Timothy Bui, 32, speaking of his
directorial debut from his home in West Hollywood. "There were so
many stories of hardship, despair, anger, loss, love and hope that
came out of this experience, and the characters in the film provide
Polaroid snapshots of some of these different stories. I made Camp
Pendleton the backdrop because it was the largest of the camps, and I
culminated all the camp experiences in this one."</TE>
<TE>   Characters include war-torn lovers, a husband and his two wives,
and a general and his disillusioned soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   When Bui pitched the script to actor Forest Whitaker, who had
appeared in other films about Vietnam, including "Good Morning
Vietnam" and "Platoon," the actor took a personal interest. He agreed
to play Addie, a volunteer cook at the camp.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a beautiful script," said Whitaker, who also is executive
producer of the movie. "The piece to me is about displacement and
families trying to stay together and find their place."</TE>
<TE>   The drama centers on a young boy, Minh Pham (played by Trung
Nguyen) and his uncle, Tai Tran (Don Duong). Minh awakens and
realizes he's in a crowded barracks where a sea of other refugees are
asleep, some on cots and some on the floor. He and his sister were
separated from their parents during the escape from Vietnam. Minh
develops a friendship with Addie and a penchant for lime-green
beverages, Mighty Mouse comics and drawing and painting.</TE>
<TE>   "Green Dragon" is a personal project for Timothy Bui, who came to
the U.S. at age 5. His insights into the refugee experience are based
on stories told by his mother, extensive interviews with other
Vietnamese refugees and research at the Marine base's archives. These
stories provided the emotion and the desperation that set the tone
and texture of the screenplay, which was filmed in Vietnamese, with
some spoken English, and has English subtitles.</TE>
<TE>   Bui and his immediate family were uprooted days before the fall.
They escaped Vietnam and were brought to the refugee camp at Fort
Chaffey, Ark. Some of his recollections are filtered through young
Minh.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't remember a lot of the hardships my parents and the
adults had to go through at the time. I mostly recalled the fun
stuff, playing with other kids in the camp. I didn't even know there
was a war happening, that our lives were endangered and that we had
to escape from Vietnam, said Bui, who avidly watched nightly outdoor
screenings of American movies, entertainment that the military
arranged for them.</TE>
<TE>   The brothers pored through hours of documentary footage of life in
the camps from the Camp Pendleton archives.</TE>
<TE>   "When I went to pitch this story to the studios and for funding, I
began to realize that not many in the American public knew that the
Vietnamese had to stay in camps to legally enter America," said
Timothy Bui. "It's an eye-opener into a part of American history that
many people didn't know about."</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Swayze ("Dirty Dancing" [1987], "Ghost" [1990]) plays Sgt.
Jim Lance. He and Tai Tran, Minh's uncle, and a former translator for
the U.S. military in Vietnam, go through a process of dealing with
the aftermath of the war. They work through feelings of guilt, heal
emotional wounds and become friends.</TE>
<TE>   The film spans about four months--the length of time the camps
existed. The brothers spent a year writing the story, beginning in
1998. Timothy Bui visited Camp Pendleton. "I walked on the grounds
and tried to put myself there and walked into the barracks and did a
lot of research at the military archives at the camp." The film was
shot at Camp Pendleton in 26 days in 2000 with 100 Vietnamese
American extras, some who lived the camp experience. Its budget was
less than $4 million.</TE>
<TE>   The brothers wanted to tell these stories in order to understand
what their parents went through and to better understand their own
culture and present it to American audiences. Their parents owned
five video stores and Timothy Bui said he grew up watching films such
as "Rambo" (1985), "Platoon" (1986) and "Missing in Action" (1984).
He wanted to set the record straight.</TE>
<TE>   "It was such a negative portrayal that I was ashamed to admit to
people I was Vietnamese because we were portrayed as 'gooks' to be
shot dead in the jungle."</TE>
<TE>   The Buis wanted to change the image of "faceless, voiceless"
Vietnamese.</TE>
<TE>   "'Green Dragon' is our immigrant story," said Tony Bui, 29. "The
Vietnamese experience has been largely defined through the point of
view of Western and American filmmakers, which often has a one-sided
portrayal of the Vietnamese as the 'invisible people' with
interchangeable faces of other Asian actors.</TE>
<TE>   "The movies I've seen in the past that involve Vietnam are not
really shot in Vietnam and didn't use Vietnamese actors. We wanted
real people. We didn't want people to think that all Asians looked
alike. With 'Green Dragon' and 'Three Seasons,' the Vietnamese cast
are distinct. The question for us was how do we bring this powerful
humanity of the Vietnamese people [to the screen] and to change the
way people see us."</TE>
<TE>   The Buis said the film isn't just for Vietnamese audiences or for
those who want to know more about the Vietnamese experience. At its
heart, it's about the immigrant experience, regardless of culture.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen other films about immigrants struggling like 'El Norte'
and 'The Killing Fields,' and what I found universal about these
movies is the themes of living with dignity, the struggle for
freedom, the fear of that struggle and walking that road," said
Timothy Bui. "Those who are born here never think about those
struggles that everyone in the world should think about. People die
to come to America, to have a better life at any cost, even death.
And people who are already here take that for granted."</TE>

<HD>A Turning Point in Promoting Ballet</HD>
<DH>Dance* Companies are using edgier programs and clever
marketing to reach out to youths.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOANN LOVIGLIO</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Think of ballet, and the first things that likely pop to mind are
tutus, toe shoes and maybe a sugarplum fairy or two.</LD>
<LD>   But the Pennsylvania Ballet is taking steps to get across the
message that under those sparkly tights are the souls--and sinew--of
athletes who are strong, tough ... and, yes, sexy.</LD>
<LD>   Black-and-white billboards going up around Philadelphia show the
dancers' buff, sometimes airborne bods with headlines like, "Not all
Flyers wear skates"--a nod to the city's hockey team--and, "An
athlete by definition," showing a dancer in a pose that flaunts her
ripped back and arms.</LD>
<TE>   Welcome to the new world of ballet, where companies across the
nation are employing edgy programs and clever marketing to reach out
to younger audiences who see the art form as esoteric and just plain
stuffy.</TE>
<TE>   "While we're grateful for our loyal subscribers, we're trying to
expand and bring in new people," said Shawn Stone, the director of
marketing for the Pennsylvania Ballet, where the average ticket
holder is 49 and female.</TE>
<TE>   Enter the 39-year-old company's youth- and male-focused ad
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Newspaper ads spotlight individual dancers. In one, featuring
principal dancer Amy Aldridge looking like a Gap model, the copy
reads: "300 crunches. 200 lat pulls. 100 arm curls. 45 minutes of
stretching. You'd call it insane. She'd call it a warm-up."</TE>
<TE>   There's also a new program geared toward 19-to-32-year-olds called
Thursday Night Jumps.</TE>
<TE>   The program offers ticket discounts and a "dance card" for
subscribers--an invitation to attend Thursday night post-performance
parties, where young ballet-goers can eat, drink and mingle with
dancers.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to reach the younger generation that grew up with the
'Nutcrackers' and 'Swan Lakes' of the world and who say, 'Ballet has
no relevance to my life,'" said Alvin Henry, marketing and public
relations director for the San Francisco Ballet, which launched its
own youth-market spin a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea was to present the ballet in a new and different way, to
make those people say, 'Maybe I should take a second look at this,'"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   According to a 1998 National Endowment for the Arts report, 16% of
the American ballet audience was younger than 30 in 1997--down from
34% in 1982. People 60 and older make up 22% of total ballet-goers in
1997, up from 15.4% in 1982, the report stated.</TE>

<LD>The television networks will set their fall prime-time lineups later
this month, a ritual shrouded in mystery and even a touch of
mythology. Small wonder that interest has grown in pulling back the
curtain, exposing the great and powerful wizards who--through
divination, focus group research and corporate
back-scratching--decide what shows live, what shows die and which
fans end up wailing about the injustice of it all on the Internet.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, these days much of the juicy, rough-and-tumble part
of scheduling has been drummed out of the process.</LD>
<LD>   Once a boisterous affair, with producers and studio executives
passionately lobbying networks on behalf of programs, entertainment
industry mergers have made those studios and networks siblings within
the same corporate families. And while these step-kids might wrestle
a bit with each other, ultimately a very few media barons serve as
the arbiters of what gets on and stays on. So instead of a robust
debate, the main gatekeepers engage in what has become little more
than a high-stakes internal monologue.</LD>
<TE>   Just consider ABC, which has 30 series prototypes, or pilots, as
candidates for next season. Of those series hopefuls, 26 are produced
either by or in conjunction with parent company Disney's Touchstone
Television.</TE>
<TE>   Basically, then, when decision-making gets down to the
nitty-gritty, Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael Eisner, as the guy
with authority over ABC, will have a heart to heart with Michael
Eisner, the guy who oversees Touchstone.</TE>
<TE>   "Michael, I really need a show for Friday night," he will say to
himself, even if a few other people are in the room. "What do you
have that would work for me?"</TE>
<TE>   This is hardly a unique non-conversation. Across town, News Corp.
President Peter Chernin, who supervises the Fox network and its
sundry production units, will haggle with himself. CBS Television
President Leslie Moonves, meanwhile, as the head of the network and
its production arm, can make himself an offer he can't refuse.</TE>
<TE>   This wasn't always so. Looking back a mere decade ago to the
1991-92 TV season--when "Law &amp; Order" was still a baby and hadn't yet
started to multiply--the Big Three networks produced or co-produced
fewer than a fifth of their programs, while half came from major
studios and 31% were produced by independent companies.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, the government phased out rules limiting how much of
their own programming the networks could supply. That action was the
starter's pistol for a series of mega-deals shifting the TV world on
its axis and leaving a handful of major players standing.</TE>
<TE>   Flash forward to the current season, which began with the four
leading networks providing on average nearly two-thirds of their
programs. By contrast, productions wholly owned by independents
accounted for only about 10% of their lineups, and many of those fall
into the category of low-cost unscripted fare.</TE>
<TE>   At an industry forum last week, network executives played coy when
asked how much of their lineups they would ideally like to own,
joking that they would prefer to control all the hits and none of the
clunkers. Yet the underlying point is that you only stumble upon hits
by taking stab after stab, and it takes only one home-grown smash
like "Will &amp; Grace" or "Everybody Loves Raymond" to pay for plenty of
also-rans.</TE>
<TE>   From a viewer's perspective, the obvious question is what effect
this has on the finished product and whether the shows that make the
cut are any worse. Arguably, the answer is no.</TE>
<TE>   The effect, however, is more subtle than that. Will executives at
Disney really take on ABC to do what's best on behalf of a series?
Are concepts that might fit better on one network directed to another
because corporate synergy, rather than creative sense, dictates that
be so? Do unconventional voices get stifled by a funneling process
that provides executives greater incentive to please their bosses
than champion a risky or unorthodox project?</TE>
<TE>   The Writers Guild of America raised such concerns in a filing
earlier this year asking the Federal Communications Commission to
reexamine the rules that were eliminated in 1993, saying deregulation
has "caused creativity to suffer." The guild doesn't have any more
chance of succeeding than a high school basketball team does of
beating the Lakers, but one has to admire the willingness to tilt at
windmills when the phrase "You'll never work in this town again" is
more than just a cliche.</TE>
<TE>   Writer-producer Diane English, whose "Murphy Brown" was one of the
pillars of the 1991-92 season, suggests the TV industry's current
configuration does lead to shows being steered to a network for the
wrong reason--namely, dollars and cents, as opposed to
compatibility--thus sealing their doom. That can be painful for
writers, she said, who want to decide "where this show that's your
baby would best be served."</TE>
<TE>   As for the quality issue, English noted, "You don't know what
you're not seeing."</TE>
<TE>   Talk about a phantom menace, which illustrates why the issues here
remain so confounding to the public, which has a hard time
comprehending, much less getting riled up about, what they're not
seeing. Just as the media (mostly owned by those same conglomerates,
by the way) are hard-pressed to lay bare how decisions are made at
ABC, for example, when by all accounts much of the debate takes place
between Eisner's ears.</TE>
<TE>   This isn't to say that there's no mythology left to un-shroud
about how the TV business operates. No one, for example, has ever
identified the mysterious ingredient that turns series pilots to junk
(executives use a somewhat more emphatic term) between the time they
are screened by the networks in Los Angeles and presented to
advertisers in New York. Programmers are fond of blaming this
contamination on some airborne element that attacks TV shows during
the cross-country flight.</TE>
<TE>   That substance is undetectable, of course. But like so much in
television these days, what you don't see can tell you as much about
what's happening as what you do.</TE>

<LD>   Ripa's Book Picks: Short on 'Reality'</LD>
<LD>   So much for lifting the mind-set of the American populace.</LD>
<TE>   "Regis and Kelly" co-host Kelly Ripa, who kicked off her new book
club with Kate White's "If Looks Could Kill," acknowledges that her
selection process is a far cry from Oprah Winfrey's. In the words of
co-host Regis Philbin, she's a proponent of "beach
trash"--page-turners that don't overtax the brain, USA Today reports.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate books that make me feel stupid, which I guess knocks off
50% of all books out there," Ripa quipped after her show Monday.
"People like escapist programming and escapist literature. There's
too much reality in the world today."</TE>
<TE>   And how did she decide that White's book would be the first
"Ripa's Book Club" selection?</TE>
<TE>   "I always judge a book by its cover, and with this one, I thought,
'This looks interesting.'" White sent Ripa chocolates after her novel
sold out, virtually overnight, in bookstores across the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Cable Sidesteps Saudi Image Campaign</TE>
<TE>   At least nine national cable networks turned down a lucrative and
controversial ad campaign from the Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia,
according to Electronic Media Online.</TE>
<TE>   Saudi Arabia, which plans to spend more than $10 million on the
campaign with the tag line "The People of Saudi Arabia--Allies
Against Terrorism," is seeking to improve its image. In one spota
"misquote" from Secretary of State Colin Powell linking the Saudis
with terrorism appears, which then dissolves into the correct quote.
Another uses a misquote/correct quote dissolve from President Bush.
The latter was shown during Fox Sports Net's broadcast of the Kings
hockey game Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   But among those who have passed on the effort are A&amp;E, AMC, Bravo,
the History Channel, Lifetime, USA Network and the Weather Channel.
Some of the deals were worth $300,000 to $400,000.</TE>
<TE>   ABC Reportedly Suspends Snyderman</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Nancy Snyderman, medical correspondent for ABC News, has been
suspended for a week without pay after making a Tylenol radio
commercial in January, according to the New York Daily News.</TE>
<TE>   A network spokesman declined to comment, saying that personnel
matters should be kept private. But ABC News has a long-standing
policy prohibiting employees from endorsing products or performing in
paid advertisements.</TE>
<TE>   Acknowledging her mistake, Snyderman asked McNeil Consumer &amp;
Specialty Pharmaceuticals--makers of the product--to pull the
commercial as soon as possible and it did.</TE>
<TE>   Nachman: A Cure for MSNBC's Ills?</TE>
<TE>   Third-place cable news network MSNBC has hired Jerry Nachman,
former editor of the New York Post and most recently an L.A.-based
staff writer on NBC's "UC: Undercover," as vice president and editor
in chief. He'll also host an afternoon analysis show.</TE>
<TE>   Nachman, who is relocating back to New York, said he'll help the
channel figure out what it wants to be.</TE>
<TE>   "They've got an identity crisis," he said. "They've been flanked
and they're working very hard on locating where in that vast middle
they need to be, between the conventional orthodoxy of CNN on one
side and that brash pinball machine called Fox, of which I'm a big
fan."</TE>
<TE>   Separately, CNN said its "NewsNight with Aaron Brown" edged out
Fox News Channel's "On the Record With Greta Van Susteren" in April,
with an average 961,000 viewers to 900,000 for Van Susteren, who was
formerly at CNN and had been beating Brown after her show launched in
February.</TE>

<TE>   The remaining members of the Grammy-winning R&amp;B group TLC--Rozonda
"Chilli" Thomas and Tionne "T-Boz" Watkins--plan to release a fourth
album and continue performing. But they won't replace Lisa "Left Eye"
Lopes, who died in a car crash in Honduras last week, the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution reports.</TE>
<TE>   "As for Lisa being replaced--never," Thomas said, "you can't
replace a TLC girl. The chemistry we have is something God gave us.
You can't put that together."</TE>
<TE>   TLC, the top-selling female group of all time, began working on
its latest album last summer. Lopes wasn't scheduled to be featured
on each song, so her death shouldn't affect the album's release,
Thomas said.</TE>
<TE>   "The last couple of albums, Lisa was only on like three songs, and
she's on a few songs on this one," Thomas said. "So music-wise, it's
the same."</TE>

<HD>An Imaginative Connection Between Art and Science</HD>
<DH>James Carter, physicist and free thinker, is the focus of
an exhibition putting some universal truths to the test.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PAGEL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Whether you're stuck in traffic on the 405 Freeway or visiting an art
exhibition that doesn't seem to make sense, a little patience goes a
long way. Nowhere is this truer than at the Santa Monica Museum of
Art, whose walls have been covered with computer-printed diagrams,
hand-drawn flow charts, neatly typed explanations, complicated
physics equations and photographic illustrations.</LD>
<LD>   Four vitrines, packed with books, pamphlets and professional
correspondences, form an "X" in the center of the main gallery. Four
monitors, embedded in the walls, show animated sequences of atomic
particles interacting with one another. Two inflatable models hang
from the rafters, and a dozen brightly colored flotation devices,
also blown up to maximum capacity, are stacked in various corners.</LD>
<LD>   To scan the scene is to know, very quickly, that someone has gone
to great lengths to put forward some pretty ambitious propositions
about the nature of the universe. To decide whether these arguments
hold water takes a lot more time, which is where patience comes in.
Ultimately, the conclusions you come to depend on your view of the
relationship between art and science, and the role the imagination
plays in both.</LD>
<TE>   Organized by Margaret Wertheim, an independent scholar and
frequent radio commentator whose publications include "Pythagoras'
Trousers" and "The Pearly Gates of Cyberspace: A History of Space
From Dante to the Internet," the exhibition is long on words and
short on images. Titled "Lithium Legs and Apocalyptic Photons: The
Imaginative World of James Carter," it is a three-dimensional version
of two books by the self-taught physicist, "The Other Theory of
Physics" and "Gravity Does Not Exist."</TE>
<TE>   As you make your way through the information-laden displays,
details about Carter's all-encompassing theory fall into place. Like
the Greek philosophers Thales and Anaxemenes, and the medieval
theologian Robert Grosseteste, Carter proposes that a single key
unlocks the secrets of the universe. But where his predecessors
looked to water, air or light as their primary principles, he turns
to the "circlon," a molecular structure shaped like a bicycle tire's
inner tube.</TE>
<TE>   Carter describes circlons as atomic Lego blocks, interlocking
rings that snap together to form all the elements. The most
impressive component of the installation is his wall-size version of
Dmitri Mendeleev's periodic table. In Carter's hands, modern
science's most recognizable icon maintains its logic and internal
consistency even after it's transformed into a chart that resembles
112 juxtaposed subway maps, each more colorful and complex than the
last.</TE>
<TE>   Starting with hydrogen and helium, whose particles are depicted
three-dimensionally, the chart switches to two dimensions at lithium.
As more information is compressed into each element's page-size box,
symmetry increases. By the time you get to actinium, thorium and
protactinium (the 89th, 90th and 91st elements), you may need reading
glasses to follow the neat patterns of circlons, whose crisscrossed
structures mimic the formation of crystals.</TE>
<TE>   In classic overachiever style, Carter has made a table that
improves upon the original. His version includes nine additional
elements, eight unnamed ones and circlonium, that tie up loose ends
and round out the whole at a more aesthetically satisfying 112.</TE>
<TE>   Other displays outline other aspects of Carter's theories. In "The
Creation of the Universe in Eight Days," he takes issue with the
big-bang theory, proposing, instead, that the universe started when
two massive circlons mated. A series of divisions and fusions
followed, leading, one step at a time, to the present state of the
universe. At first, the claim seems to be nuttier than a fruitcake,
but the deeper you dive into it, the less farfetched it becomes. Too
many details correspond to known facts for it to be utter nonsense.</TE>
<TE>   The beauty of Carter's system is that it is mechanistic. In it,
bodies made of matter interact with one another; no invisible forces
exert mysterious powers over things. Like Christiaan Huygens, who
invented the pendulum clock, and James Clerk Maxwell, who tried to
develop a mechanical theory of electricity and magnetism, Carter
seeks to explain things simply and clearly. In all of his work,
there's very little that's counterintuitive.</TE>
<TE>   His system's biggest glitch involves gravity, which he just can't
make sense of by ordinary means. But rather than letting gravitation
bring his theory crashing to the ground, he makes an end run around
it.</TE>
<TE>   According to Carter, all matter is constantly expanding,
increasing in size like an unpoppable balloon into which air is
constantly being pumped. Thus, objects do not fall to the ground. The
surface of the Earth rises to meet them.</TE>
<TE>   At this point, you can't help but think that Carter is a charlatan
whose only goal is to pull a fast one. You are, after all, in a
museum of contemporary art. And you don't have to be a rocket
scientist to know that this is a place where the emperor's new
clothes are sometimes displayed.</TE>
<TE>   But there's something about Carter's project that tells you it's
not a hoax. For one thing, it doesn't draw its legitimacy from the
museum. More important, it's clear that Carter began to develop his
theories without museums in mind, and that he will continue his
life's work whether or not these institutions exhibit the results of
his research.</TE>
<TE>   The inflated airbags stacked in the corners tip you off to the
profoundly idiosyncratic world in which Carter lives. These red,
yellow, orange and burgundy sacks, which come in all shapes and
sizes, are Carter Lift Bags, patented tools designed to raise objects
from the bottoms of large bodies of water.</TE>
<TE>   Carter began to develop them in the 1970s, when he was an abalone
diver off the coast of Catalina and was looking for an easier way to
get his catch to the surface. Now he manufactures a line of lift bags
in a converted restaurant on his wooded campground in Washington. He
also makes custom models for NASA, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the
Navy, Coast Guard and the Bellagio casino in Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   The poetry of Carter's project snaps into focus when you realize
that his anti-gravitational theory (and its corollary of the Earth's
expanding and rising surface) exactly matches the mechanics of the
invention that bears his name. His exhibition is a hilarious case of
historical materialism in action.</TE>
<TE>   A more famous mechanistic thinker was Marx, who argued that
material conditions, namely a society's means and mode of production,
shape its prevailing ideas. Carter's installation makes the same
point, only much more humorously than the 19th century economist,
whose theories still shape the thinking of art-world academics.</TE>
<TE>   Lighten up, Carter's seriously playful work suggests. With a
little levity you might even give gravity, or at least gravitas, a
run for its money.</TE>
<TE>   In a small side gallery, a videotaped film by Wertheim and Cameron
Allan fleshes out the installation's ideas. This insightful and
entertaining portrait of Carter ranks among the year's art
highlights. If patience isn't your strong suit, start here.</TE>
<TE>   Alternating between computer-animated displays of spinning
circlons and lucid interviews, the film presents some of Carter's
many faces: gold-miner, filmmaker, cave-digger, repairman,
entrepreneur, trailer-park manager and inventor. One of its best
sequences features his smoke-ring machines, motorized devices that
blow smoke rings the size of truck tires into the night sky.</TE>
<TE>   Although he claims to be testing the mobility of circlons, it
looks as if he's just having a good time. Throughout the film, Carter
shows himself to be a levelheaded eccentric, the kind of pragmatic,
freethinking individual you'd want to have at your side if you were
trapped on a deserted island. Making a virtue of loopiness, he
demonstrates that wild ideas make the world go round.</TE>

<HD>'Friends' Staff Deals With History, Destiny</HD>
<DH>Television* The initial 24 episodes are on VHS and DVD, and
thoughts begin to turn to how to wrap up the hit series next season.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kevin S. Bright, executive producer of NBC's comedy series "Friends,"
says the top-ranked sitcom has progressed over the past eight seasons
just the way he and fellow executive producers David Crane and Marta
Kauffman envisioned.</LD>
<LD>   "The original concept of the show was when you leave home for the
first time, your friends are your extended family," Bright said.
"Like any family situation, you want to watch the people grow and
watch the situations change so you feel like you are going through
life with these people. In that way, I think we have accomplished the
goal of the series. It's the reason why I think people still love the
show so much, because they are really invested in the lives of six
characters. They care what happens to them."</LD>
<LD>   Bright had occasion to revisit the freshman year of the series
recently while editing the VHS ($50) and DVD ($70) compilation set
that arrived in stores Tuesday from Warner Home Video. The second
season of episodes is set to follow in September.</LD>
<TE>   Besides featuring the first 24 episodes of the sitcom uncut, the
DVD set features commentary from the producers, an interactive look
at the Central Perk coffeehouse set, a "Friends" trivia quiz and a
retrospective of all the guest stars from the 1994-95 season,
including a very young-looking George Clooney and Noah Wyle.</TE>
<TE>   Bright approached Warner Home Video about bringing the series out
on VHS and the then-fledgling DVD format about four years ago, given
that they were already available in many parts of Europe. "After a
while of keeping at it, I got them to concede to do one 'best of '
volume. It sold something like 2 million copies," Bright said.</TE>
<TE>   "Friends" is just the latest popular TV series released on video
and DVD. "The X-Files," "The Simpsons," "Buffy the Vampire Slayer"
and "The Sopranos" have also performed exceedingly well in the home
entertainment market</TE>
<TE>   For the "Friends" DVD compilation, Bright wanted to give the fans
a little something extra. "We went into the vaults and pulled out all
the original footage and we restored everything we cut from the
original episodes that is worth restoring. There are a couple of
things you cut for a reason but there are also many things we lost
for time purposes," he said.</TE>
<TE>   One scene cut from the pilot, for example, features Phoebe (Lisa
Kudrow) playing the guitar and singing in a subway station. Because
there was a recording problem, the sequence wasn't included in the
pilot. But Bright decided to restore it for the VHS and DVD. Five
years after she filmed the scene, Kudrow went into the recording
studio and dubbed in her lines.</TE>
<TE>   Up until a few months ago, NBC and the producers didn't know if
the current season would be the last for "Friends," which made things
challenging for the creative team.</TE>
<TE>   "We were kind of frozen in time there for a moment, and we didn't
know if we were preparing for the end or preparing for a
cliffhanger," Bright said. "It just got to a certain point where we
had to make a choice and the choice was to be positive. So we pretty
much abandoned the road of ending the series and dedicated ourselves
to continuing. Fortunately, it all worked out."</TE>
<TE>   If the cast hadn't agreed to come back in the fall, Bright
acknowledged that the production would probably have shut down for a
few weeks to figure out the series' finale.</TE>
<TE>   Bright said that there are no firm plot ideas for the ninth
season. "We haven't completed this one yet," he said. "So it is hard
to turn your thoughts over, but I think we are gong to take the next
couple of months we have off ... to be thinking what the end of the
series will be."</TE>
<TE>   And beyond the cast's stating that next year will be the last,
Bright said he definitely thinks the coming season will be the final
one. "We're so happy we have another year so we can take that year
and really arc the end of the series," he said. "The three of us are
pretty much committed that this is the end and the actors are, too.
Nine years is enough for a show."</TE>
<TE>   Rachel's pregnancy, said Bright, rejuvenated the show after it
played second fiddle to CBS' "Survivor" last year. "Friends" is the
No. 1 prime-time series this season, averaging 23.8 million viewers,
up 23% compared with 2000-2001.</TE>
<TE>   "We have had a really great season creatively," Bright said. "The
writing has been superb, and the actors have been really on their
game.</TE>
<TE>   "I also think people got sick of watching 'Survivor.' After 9/11,
I think your choices in viewing television aren't shows where people
are degraded and demeaned."</TE>
<TE>   Bright acknowledged that the producers received angry e-mails from
fans over the Joey-Rachel story line that saw Joey fall in love with
her. But he said those who were angry that the two didn't become a
couple will probably be happy with the hourlong season finale on May
16. "Hopefully, when they see the close-out of the season, they'll
feel that it is all worthwhile," he said.</TE>

<HD>A Look Back at a Time of Beginnings</HD>
<DH>In 'Green Dragon,' brothers Tony and Timothy Linh Bui tell
a bittersweet tale of Vietnam refugees' reception in America.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After Tony Bui returned to his ancestral Vietnam to make his 1999
prizewinning "Three Seasons," he wrote with his brother Timothy Linh
Bui the gentle, bittersweet and deeply personal "Green Dragon," which
Timothy adapted for the screen and directed. The brothers, who
co-wrote and co-produced "Three Seasons," have stated that the
inspiration for their film came from their mother's stories of the
hardships she and other Vietnamese refugees endured upon their
arrival in America. It's a fitting tribute.</LD>
<LD>   The time is April 1975, and the place is Camp Pendleton, where in
48 hours Marines have assembled a refugee housing area that will
temporarily shelter 134,000 people in tents and World War II-era
Quonset huts through October of that year. The fall of Saigon is
imminent as Tai (Don Duong), a thoughtful, reflective man, arrives at
the camp with his little nephew Minh (Trung Hieu Nguyen) and niece
Anh (Jennifer Tran). Minh immediately wants to begin searching for
his mother, whom his uncle knows may no longer be alive. For the
present, he calms the children and promises that their mother will
soon be arriving.</LD>
<TE>   The film unfolds from the point of view of the curious,
irrepressible Minh, who strikes up an acquaintance with one of the
camp's cooks, Addie (Forest Whitaker), a loner yet deeply paternal in
regard to the little boy. A gifted artist, Addie has never before
shown his sketches to anyone and even draws Minh as Mighty Mouse,
having given him some comic books. In time, Addie reveals to the boy
the mural he has painted in secret on a storeroom wall and encourages
him to add to it. Even though Minh understands not a word of the
feelings Addie is expressing, they achieve a bond through the cook's
caring manner and shared pleasure in painting together.</TE>
<TE>   The flowering of this touching friendship frames a number of
vignettes that capture the feelings of a cross section of refugees.
There's Duc (Billinjer Tran), eager to jump into American free
enterprise but stunned to find the girl he loved has become the
exploited second wife of a man whose first wife hates her. There's a
proud man who only wants to return to Vietnam despite his wife's
insistence that she and their son will never return. And there's a
general, humiliated by defeat and taunted for having left Vietnam
before the war is truly over. These and others express their
homesickness, their feeling that America has let them down and their
fear of their future in an unknown country.</TE>
<TE>   With his fluency in English and calm demeanor, Tai is tapped by
Patrick Swayze's Sgt. Jim Lance to be the camp manager. Lance looks
every bit the tough, seasoned Marine he is, but he tries to exercise
his authority with compassion. Lance and Tai realize that each is a
man of goodwill, that each has suffered losses in the war. Lance
feels shamed by America's defeat, while Tai endures survivor's guilt.
Both strive to work in harmony but, given the circumstances, a strain
in their friendship is inevitable. In the meantime, Tai attempts to
court one of the general's pretty daughters (Hiep Thi Le).</TE>
<TE>   Timothy Linh Bui has a delicacy of touch that tempers the film's
considerable seething anger, frustration and despair as well as the
sentimentality that accompanies Addie and Minh's friendship. Bui
inspires splendid performances from almost everyone, his principals
in particular. Photographed by Kramer Morgenthau with a sensitivity
to expressing ever-shifting moods and emotions, "Green Dragon"--which
takes its title from a figure in Addie's mural--is a gracious,
eloquent film that by its end offers a ray of hope to the refugees
able to look ahead and resist living in a past forever lost.</TE>

<HD>Lies Are No Slam-Dunk on 'Bernie'</HD>

<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In real life, Bernie Mac is doing just fine. His show recently won a
Peabody Award and was renewed for a second season.</LD>
<LD>   But on tonight's episode of "The Bernie Mac Show" (9 p.m. Fox),
he's got problems, as usual. That's what makes this tart, subversive
sitcom so much fun.</LD>
<LD>   Tonight's trouble begins when Bernie enlists the help of his
8-year-old nephew, Jordan (Jeremy Suarez), in deceiving his wife,
Wanda (Kellita Smith). The kid fakes an asthma attack so he and his
uncle can skulk out to an L.A. Clippers basketball game.</LD>
<TE>   In a cameo after the game, Billy Crystal gloats about his superior
seats. At courtside, "I had two rebounds and an assist," Crystal
says.</TE>
<TE>   Back at home, Bernie's real headaches start as the deception spins
out of control.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan sheds any qualms about lying when he learns he can get his
way by doing more of it, turning into what Bernie calls an "evil
genius." Bernie can't expose Jordan because the kid uses the original
lie as leverage. The makeshift dad laments, "This ain't nothing but
some blaxploitation."</TE>
<TE>   But Bernie and Jordan aren't the only ones bending the truth.</TE>
<TE>   Wanda misses a school play featuring her 5-year-old niece, Bryanna
(Dee Dee Davis), because her eyebrow-waxing appointment runs long.
"You wouldn't want your Aunt Wanda walking around with a uni-brow,"
she says when busted.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the eldest niece, 13-year-old Vanessa (Camille
Winbush), defies Bernie by sneaking into an R-rated movie.</TE>
<TE>   Little Bryanna is the household's honest exception. Or is she?</TE>
<TE>   In its imperfection, this is one of the most believable families
on TV.</TE>
<TE>   There's only one thing implausible about tonight's episode: As if
the Clippers would be playing a game in May.</TE>

<HD>Burnett, Miniseries Lift CBS</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Brian Lowry</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A combination of nostalgia and voices from beyond unearthed another
ratings win for CBS, as the miniseries "Living With the Dead" and a
pair of Carol Burnett specials buoyed the network's performance over
the weekend, based on viewing estimates issued Tuesday by Nielsen
Media Research.</LD>
<LD>   ABC, meanwhile, opened the four-week rating sweeps that officially
began Thursday with stellar numbers from "The Bachelor." The two-hour
conclusion of the unscripted series took its toll on competitors,
dropping "Friends" to its lowest rating in a year and "Survivor:
Marquesas" to its worst performance during the current edition of
that franchise.</LD>
<LD>   Burnett, meanwhile, again ruled Saturday night for CBS as host of
"CBS: 50 Years From TV City," while a repeat of "Carol Burnett Show
Stoppers"--the surprise hit of a few months ago that helped fuel the
current wave of reunion specials--also won its time slot. Not
surprisingly, those specials skewed to a somewhat older audience.</LD>
<TE>   ABC's sweeps charge was led by Bruce Willis, as the network scored
respectable ratings with a rerun of "Armageddon," while "The Sixth
Sense" built steadily Sunday but proved no match for CBS' similarly
themed exercise in talking with the dead. ABC fared less well last
week with the special "Contact: Talking With the Dead," though the
show did exceed "Once and Again's" average in that hour.</TE>

<LD>To create an appealing salad, combine flavorful ingredients that
contrast in color and texture. Use quality fresh greens and
vegetables. Wash and spin-dry them in advance and refrigerate them so
they stay crisp.</LD>
<LD>   Try to cut all the ingredients in a salad the same size, 1/3-inch
dice or slightly larger. Short shreds of ingredients such as cabbage,
iceberg lettuce and carrots also work well with diced ingredients.
Chopped salads can use up small amounts of leftover meats, poultry
and seafood in a tasty way.</LD>
<LD>   These salads use six cups of greens as the base for all the other
add-ons; it's easy enough to create your own salads with whatever's
in the refrigerator.</LD>

<LD>Aworld without whipped cream would be a lot less enticing. Of all
cake fillings, whipped cream is the simplest and fastest to prepare.
Heavy cream, due to its high butterfat content (36%) whips a little
better than whipping cream, which has 30%. Light cream, also called
coffee cream, does not whip.</LD>
<LD>   For serving with sweet, intensely flavored desserts, whipped cream
is perfect as is. The French invariably add a touch of sugar and
vanilla and call it Chantilly cream. You can add other extracts,
brandies, spices, coffee or chocolate.</LD>
<LD>   An electric mixer works best. For small amounts, a hand-held
electric mixer is best because you can use a small bowl so the
beaters sit right in the cream. This gives better control and reduces
risk of overwhipping.</LD>
<TE>   Before whipping, chill the cream, bowl and beaters; warm cream may
not whip. Begin at medium-high speed, moving the beater around in the
bottom of the bowl to whip the cream evenly. As it thickens, reduce
the speed so you can stop quickly.</TE>
<TE>   For a topping or an accompaniment, whip it just until it can hold
its shape on a spoon. Beat it to medium peaks for blending with other
ingredients and to fairly stiff peaks for spreading on cakes. Cream
does not whip to peaks as stiff as beaten egg whites; beating too
long will turn it to butter.</TE>
<TE>   You can add sugar and dry flavorings such as instant coffee or
vanilla powder at the start, while liquid flavorings are best added
at the end in small amounts so they won't soften the cream too much.
Whipped cream is best served promptly, as it does not retain its
shape for long.</TE>
<TE>   For an everyday treat, use whipped milk. You make it with the
whipping attachment of a hand-held immersion blender, which can whip
only cream or nonfat milk. Instead of using a bowl, you whip the milk
in a tall jar or glass and serve it right away.</TE>

<TE>   Raspberry-Strawberry Romanoff</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 10 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 30 minutes</TE>
<TE>   For festive occasions, try the classic version of this popular
dessert, piled high with swirls of luscious Chantilly cream. On days
when you're eating light, enjoy the berries with a cloud of whipped
milk. You can use other berries or mixtures of berries, peaches and
nectarines. If you prefer, substitute 2 tablespoons raspberry brandy
or kirsch (clear cherry brandy) for the orange liqueur.</TE>
<TE>   2 cups raspberries</TE>
<TE>   2 to 3 cups strawberries, hulled and cut in thick slices</TE>
<TE>   4 to 6 tablespoons sugar (for the berries) plus 1 teaspoon (for
the cream)</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup fresh orange juice</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup orange liqueur</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup whipping cream, well chilled</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</TE>
<TE>   Place the raspberries and strawberries in a glass bowl and
sprinkle with 4 to 6 tablespoons sugar (sweeter berries won't need as
much sugar), the orange juice and the liqueur. Toss lightly. Cover
and refrigerate for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, chill a bowl and beaters
for whipping the cream. If you want to pipe the cream in rosettes,
prepare a pastry bag fitted with a medium star tip.</TE>
<TE>   Whip the cream with the remaining 1 teaspoon of sugar in the
chilled bowl at medium-high speed until the cream thickens. Add the
vanilla. For serving the cream in dollops, continue whipping until it
is no longer runny and is just thick enough to hold its shape,
somewhat like soft yogurt. For piping it in rosettes, whip the cream
until it stands up in soft peaks when you lift the beaters.</TE>
<TE>   To serve, spoon the berries into wine glasses or dessert dishes.
Either spoon a dollop of whipped cream on each serving; or use a
rubber spatula to fill the pastry bag, then pipe the whipped cream in
decorative swirls or rosettes over the berries. Serve immediately.</TE>
<TE>   4 servings. Each serving: 232 calories; 8 mg sodium; 20 mg
cholesterol; 6 grams fat; 3 grams saturated fat; 38 grams
carbohydrates; 1 gram protein; 5.96 grams fiber.</TE>
<TE>   Variation: To make Guilt-Free Berries Romanoff, for 1 or 2
portions of whipped milk, pour 1/2 cup nonfat milk into a chilled
3-cup jar (about 3 inches in diameter and 6 inches tall) or a tall
glass; the milk will whip almost to the jar's top. Add 1 to 2
teaspoons of sugar or sweetener to taste and, if you like, 1/4
teaspoon vanilla powder. Using the whipping attachment of an
immersion blender, whip the milk following the manufacturer's
instructions, moving the whip slowly up and down. Spoon the whipped
milk over the berries and serve immediately; whipped milk separates
rapidly.</TE>

<HD>Why the Manchus Made That Jerky Soup</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Manchus are all but gone now, fast disappearing as a distinct
ethnic group, their language nearly extinct. But from the mid-17th to
the early 20th century they ruled the most populous country in the
world, China. For hundreds of years the Chinese were required to wear
their hair in the Manchu pigtail as a sign of submission to them.</LD>
<LD>   From the vantage point of their forest homeland in Manchuria,
north of Korea, the Manchus had watched one nation after another
conquer China over the centuries, only to be swallowed up by it in a
couple of generations. They took notes and planned (in vain, as it
happened) to avoid the same fate once it was their turn to rule.</LD>
<LD>   They particularly studied their neighbors the Mongols--the
easternmost tip of Mongolia was right over the Khingan Mountains from
Manchuria, and the Mongols had actually conquered them on occasion.
The Manchus wrote their own language in the Mongolian alphabet and
even borrowed a few Mongol foods, such as a soup called sile and a
sort of jerky made from beef and mutton (borcilaha; they cut it up
into squares and used it for making soup). They also learned a couple
of alcoholic beverages from those hard-drinking bad boys of the
steppe: fermented milk (darasu) and the Mongolian-style vodka (arjan)
made from it.</LD>
<TE>   And they made kuru, a sort of dried yogurt cheese. Otherwise
Manchu cuisine ended up being pretty much like Chinese food.</TE>
<TE>   One more Mongolian word they borrowed was a word for salt
(dabsun). Not that they learned how to salt their food from the
Mongols; they'd just noticed that one of the revenue sources of the
Mongolian Empire had been a salt tax, so the Manchus were careful to
set up their own dabsun department.</TE>

<HD>Red Eggs and Lamb Soup for Easter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DONNA DEANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For Greeks, this Sunday's Orthodox Easter is the biggest holiday of
the year, a time when observant Greek Orthodox families and friends
gather to share a bountiful feast after the 40 days of fasting during
Lent and Holy Week. In many homes, preparations for the Easter feast
will go on all day Saturday, well into the night and even continue
most of the day Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Lamb and eggs are the centerpieces of the Greek Easter feast. The
eggs are dyed a vivid red with a special imported coloring available
only at Greek markets. The lamb appears in many forms--as appetizer,
soup and main course.</LD>
<LD>   Traditionally, it's the soup, mayeritsa, that is eaten first. It
is used to break the fast after the Saturday midnight church service
when the faithful leave the church with their lighted candles and the
scent of incense and rush home or to their favorite restaurant.</LD>
<TE>   Mayeritsa is only prepared at this time of the year.
Authentically, it is made with lamb heart, lungs and other organ
meats, though these days adaptations are permissible. After the long
fast, this soup is soothing to the stomach and a gentle break from
the fast.</TE>
<TE>   At this midnight meal, it is traditional for each person to choose
one of the red hard-boiled eggs to crack against someone else's. The
person whose egg doesn't crack is considered to have good luck for
the rest of the year. The egg symbolizes the new life of the
Resurrection. The cracking of the egg is symbolic of Christ's
emergence from the tomb.</TE>
<TE>   The next day is the major feast. There will be tsoureki, a yeast
bread braided with more of the bright red eggs and flavored with
mahlepi (a seasoning made of ground pits of a native Greek variety of
cherry). These breads are so beautiful that they can be used as a
centerpiece for the table.</TE>
<TE>   The first lamb dish usually served is kokoretsi--skewers of lamb
innards that are wrapped in lamb intestines and grilled. These
skewers are meant to be eaten as appetizer-like nibbles while the
lamb is slowly roasting over the open fire.</TE>
<TE>   The preparation of the lamb is done by the men of the family. The
lamb is selected and butchered a few days before Easter. It is then
brought home and kept until Easter morning when it is tied to the
rotisserie and delicately balanced so it will turn smoothly. It
usually takes about four hours for the lamb to cook over the open
fire, depending on its size. It is rubbed with olive oil and
generously seasoned with Greek oregano, garlic, salt and pepper. An
herbal brush is made up of fresh oregano, dill and parsley sprigs,
dipped into a mixture of olive oil and lemon juice and brushed on the
lamb throughout the cooking.</TE>
<TE>   The lamb is served with Greek roasted potatoes. Spanakopita, a
spinach pie, and Greek salad are served along with chunks of feta
cheese and kasseri cheese, Greek olives, and tzatziki a
yogurt-cucumber sauce. Assorted appetizers (mezedes) are served,
including cheese-filled tyropitas made with filo dough, the eggplant
dip melitzanosalata, the little meatballs called keftedakia and
stuffed grape leaves, or dolmades.</TE>
<TE>   The traditional dessert for this feast--as well as any other
festive Greek dinner--is the beloved baklava. There may also be small
braided orange-and-sesame cookies called koulourakia, or the
custard-filled galaktoboureko filo desserts. There will probably be a
platter of fresh fruit and, of course, more of that tsoureki braided
bread. It's not every day you get to eat red eggs.</TE>

<TE>   Mayeritsa Greek Easter Soup</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 30 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 1/2 hours</TE>
<TE>   This recipe comes from Cosmas Kapantzos of the Astroburger
restaurant on Melrose Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   2 pounds lamb shanks and/or neck bones</TE>
<TE>   12 cups water</TE>
<TE>   3 carrots, cut in half</TE>
<TE>   3 celery stalks, cut in half crosswise</TE>
<TE>   1 yellow onion, cut into quarters</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon peppercorns</TE>
<TE>   2 bay leaves</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons salt</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon pepper</TE>
<TE>   3 beef bouillon cubes</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons butter</TE>
<TE>   11/2 cups chopped green onions (about 14 onions)</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons flour</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup chopped fresh dill</TE>
<TE>   1 cup chopped Italian parsley</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup long-grain rice</TE>
<TE>   3 eggs</TE>
<TE>   Juice of 1 lemon</TE>
<TE>   Place the lamb, water, carrots, celery, yellow onion, peppercorns,
bay leaves, salt and pepper in a 6-quart saucepan and bring to boil.
Lower the heat, cover and simmer until the meat is tender, 11/2
hours.</TE>
<TE>   Remove the meat; strain the juices into a bowl. Discard the
vegetables. Put the bowl in the freezer until the fat has solidified
enough to skim from the top, about 45 minutes. Discard the fat and
cut the meat from the bones. Chop the meat into small pieces; set
aside.</TE>
<TE>   Pour the defatted juices into a small, 4-quart saucepan and bring
to a boil. Add the bouillon cubes and stir to dissolve. Remove from
the heat and set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Melt the butter in a 6-quart saucepan over low heat. Add the green
onions and cook until tender, about 4 minutes. Stir in the flour
until blended. Add the dill, parsley and rice and mix well. Cook on
low heat for a couple of minutes and add the chopped meat. Pour in
the broth. Cover and bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer
until the rice is done, 15 to 20 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Break the eggs into a small bowl and beat with a fork. Gradually
beat in the lemon juice. Add a ladle of the soup from the pot to the
egg mixture while beating the eggs. Gradually add a second ladle.
Pour the egg mixture into the soup gradually while continuously
stirring. Cook the soup another 3 minutes; do not allow it to boil.
Remove from the heat.</TE>

<LD>I am a 40-something native Angeleno and (together with my brothers
and husband) have always enjoyed black-and-white cookies
("Black-and-White, Eaten All Over," April 17). In my childhood there
were many more Jewish bakeries than today near my grandmother's house
in the Beverly-Fairfax area. Black-and-whites were a staple.</LD>
<LD>   For a short time, my family moved to San Francisco where there
were no black-and-whites to be found. My grandmother would order
dozens of them at a time, have them frozen and walk off of the plane
carrying pink bakery boxes which we would cherish until her next
visit, or our next visit to L.A. My children now love these as well.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I was thrilled to see an article about one of my favorite treats
until I realized that my favorite source of black-and-white cookies
in the San Fernando Valley was omitted. S &amp; J Baking Co. in
Northridge, formerly Brown's Bakery of North Hollywood, has without a
doubt the best-tasting black-and-white cookie. The others don't even
come close.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Thanks for the article on one of my favorite comfort foods:
black-and-white cookies. As a kid, I used to nudge my mom into buying
them for me on her trips to the now-defunct Brown's Bakery in North
Hollywood. For some reason, they were known as "drop" cookies in our
household.</TE>
<TE>   SANDY SIEGEL</TE>
<TE>   Via E-Mail</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I would like to take writer Rick Nahmias to Germany and he would
find black-and-white cookies in every bakery by the name of
"Amerikaner."</TE>
<TE>   RENATE TRIES</TE>
<TE>   Lake Forest</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I have fond memories of this cookie, having grown up in New York.
Whenever I'm on Fairfax Avenue I always make sure to stop at Canter's
Deli and bring some home with me. As the article states, the key is
to make sure they're moist.</TE>
<TE>   JAY SANFORD</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I was totally surprised that you did not mention the best
black-and-white cookie in Los Angeles, made at Fred's Bakery on
Robertson Boulevard. I have tasted the other bakeries'
black-and-whites and, truly, none can compare to Fred's Bakery.</TE>
<TE>   SYLVIA WEISS</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I was very interested to read about your black-and-white cakes. In
New Zealand, we have made for many years "neenish tarts," which are
made of a short pastry tart shell with a mixture of icing sugar,
butter, lemon juice, condensed milk, in the middle with icing on top.
Yes, half-chocolate, half-white. These are very popular, also very
rich. I have known my late mother to make these for parties as they
kept in the freezer. She made these since she was a little girl, more
than 50 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   ANN McNICKLE</TE>
<TE>   Auckland, New Zealand</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Anyone with a sense of history and perspective knows they are
half-moons, not black-and-whites, and that it is impossible to get a
decent one west of the Hudson River, much less in Los Angeles. For a
real half-moon, order them from Hemstrought's Bakery in Utica, NY,
(315) 735-3313, and then the deprived of Los Angeles will have their
senses awakened.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I laughed when I read the article on black-and-white cookies
because my husband is totally addicted to them and suffers withdrawal
if he doesn't have one each evening with his glass of milk. However,
I was very disappointed that the writer did not mention Stolichnaya
Bakery at Santa Monica and Fairfax, where they not only make the best
black-and-white cookies this side of Zabar's, but also a wide variety
of other excellent cookies, pastries and breads.</TE>

<LD>Kohlrabi, a member of the turnip family, has a mild sweetness that
lends itself well to creamed dishes. But creamed dishes can be
fattening. Here, the kohlrabi cooking liquid and fat-free
half-and-half create a creaminess without adding fat, while a little
chicken broth enriches the dish's flavor.</LD>
<LD>   The dill and tarragon add a final touch to the cream sauce. This
is a creamed vegetable that goes well with any chicken or pork
entree.</LD>
<LD>   Dill and Tarragon Creamed Kohlrabi</LD>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 20 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 45 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Fat-free half-and-half is available in the dairy case of
well-stocked supermarkets.</TE>
<TE>   2 bunches kohlrabi, about 2 pounds</TE>
<TE>   Nonstick cooking spray</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons butter</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons minced shallots</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons flour</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup chicken broth</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup fat-free half-and-half</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon minced fresh dill</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 teaspoons minced fresh tarragon</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   Dill sprigs, for garnish</TE>
<TE>   Cut the tops off the kohlrabi. Peel the kohlrabi and cut into
1-inch pieces. Place the kohlrabi in a 4-quart saucepan. Add enough
water to cover by an inch, and heat over medium-high heat to boiling.
Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook until the kohlrabi is
fork-tender, about 20 minutes. Drain, reserving 2 cups of the cooking
liquid; set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Spray a large saucepan with nonstick cooking spray and add the
butter. Heat until the butter melts and begins to sizzle. Add the
shallots and cook until tender, about 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the
reserved kohlrabi broth and bring to a boil. Combine the flour and
chicken broth in a small bowl until completely blended and smooth.
Stir into the broth. Return to a boil and simmer until thickened, 1
to 2 minutes. Stir in the half-and-half, dill, tarragon and salt.
Bring to a simmer. Stir in the kohlrabi and cook just until the
kohlrabi is heated through and the liquid just begins to simmer. Do
not overheat or the sauce may curdle. Pour into serving bowls and
garnish with the sprigs of fresh dill.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Near the southern end of the Foothill toll road, where gated
communities and shopping centers abut Rancho Santa Margarita's last
scraps of undeveloped land, there's a small farmers market, begun in
December, with a couple of interesting vendors.</LD>
<LD>   Among the seven last Wednesday was Rob Durfos of One Oak Ranch,
who quit a career as a fisherman to grow specialty organic produce in
Fallbrook. He was selling large, gorgeous, fragrant purple green
onions, brought to market with their roots in water and presented on
ice. He also had round Meiwa kumquats, much sweeter than the common
Nagami variety; giant, white-fleshed Bangkok guavas; Pierce and White
cherimoyas; and antler-like manzanita branches, used for firewood or
decoration.</LD>
<LD>   Most intriguing, he said that he's expecting to harvest eight
varieties of lychees in July (he also sells at the San Clemente
market).</LD>
<TE>   Sean Sullivan of Valley Center brought superbly sweet and crisp
organic sugar snap peas, a delight to eat raw, along with top-quality
favas, beets, carrots, pristine baby leeks, navel oranges and Fuerte
and Hass avocados.</TE>
<TE>   Julie Gama of Valley Center Orchards also sold fine Hass and
Fuerte avocados, along with navels, Lee mandarins, Eureka lemons and
Oroblancos.</TE>
<TE>   Magarro Farms of El Toro offered Camarosa strawberries, cabbage,
Maui onions and zucchini.</TE>
<TE>   Javier Berumen's stand, from Westminster, also had Camarosas, as
well as leeks, carrots, yellow onions, radishes and celery.</TE>
<TE>   The market's manager and sponsor, Steve Crossen, works most of the
week in real estate investing and sells for a bakery at farmers
markets on weekends.</TE>
<TE>   Rancho Santa Margarita farmers market, Dove Canyon Drive east of
Plano Trabuco Road, Wednesdays, 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.</TE>

<HD>The Oaxaca Connection</HD>
<DH>Immigrants from southern Mexico have brought real moles,
clayudas and avocado leaf barbacoa to L.A.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA HANSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This is a tale of two Oaxacas--one deep in southern Mexico, the other
in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The relationship between the two is so close that the
Spanish-language newspaper El Oaxaqueno, which is published from
offices on Wilshire Boulevard, is distributed in Mexico too. You can
buy it for three pesos at the newsstand in the town square in Oaxaca
city.</LD>
<LD>   The bond works both ways. An April issue devoted a page to
photographs of the zocalo, the cathedral and other sites in Oaxaca
city. The headline was "Nostalgia por mi Pueblo."</LD>
<TE>   There are no exact figures on the number of Oaxacans in Los
Angeles County, but estimates range as high as 250,000--enough to
support a network of Oaxacan restaurants, markets and shops. Oaxacan
church and social organizations regularly stage fairs and bailes
(dances). There is even a folkloric dance troupe, Huaxyacac, that
offers free training for members in an effort to preserve this aspect
of Oaxacan culture.</TE>
<TE>   Oaxacans living here celebrate the same festivals that are
important back home and eat the same food. Even tiny fried
grasshoppers, a favorite snack, are easy to come by. Although other
Mexican regional foods are often "gringoized" in America to court
wider patronage, Oaxacan restaurants remain faithful to the original.
They serve the same moles, clayudas, memelas, grilled meats and
avocado-leaf-flavored barbacoa you'd find in Oaxaca.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes the food is even better here. Agua de chilacayota, a
sweet drink that contains strands of a green and white squash as big
as a watermelon is more full-flavored at El Danzante on Pico
Boulevard than at stands known for it in Oaxaca city. Farther west on
Pico, Prisciliano Mateo turns out a leche quemada (burnt milk) ice
cream that rivals any version of this unique smoky flavored sweet in
Oaxaca.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps traditions remain strong because most Oaxacan immigration
is recent. A few pioneers came in the 1970s, but most arrived in the
1980s, driven by hard times in Mexico and awareness that in Los
Angeles they could find work as gardeners, maids and restaurant
workers.</TE>
<TE>   These immigrants were mostly Zapotecs from the Sierra Norte and
from the Valles Centrales, the relatively flat area of mountainous
Oaxaca state around the capital, Oaxaca city. There are more than
60,000 immigrants from these two regions alone in Los Angeles, says
Gaspar Rivera Salgado, an assistant professor of sociology and
American studies at USC and an advisor to two local Oaxacan groups.
The largest concentrations, according to Rivera, are in the central
city neighborhoods of Pico-Union, Koreatown and South-Central, and on
the Westside from Mar Vista to Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   Rivera is from Tecomaxtlahuaca in the Mixteca Baja region of
Oaxaca. Mixtec immigrants are primarily farm workers and concentrate
in agricultural areas, he says. Additional indigenous communities
represented here are Triquis, who began to immigrate in the mid '90s,
and Mixes.</TE>
<TE>   "What distinguishes the Zapotecs from other indigenous groups is
they are the entrepreneurs. They love business," Rivera says.</TE>
<TE>   Fernando Lopez, founder of the Guelaguetza restaurants and of the
newspaper El Oaxaqueno, is a Zapotec from Matatlan. His wife, Maria,
is also Zapotec, but from Mitla, and they speak different Zapotec
languages. Fernando came here in 1993, Maria in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   "We saw a lot of Oaxacan people in this area, and we tried to
bring the food to them. We thought the people would be happy to eat
their food again," says Maria Lopez. Fernando Lopez and a sister,
Soledad, opened the first Guelaguetza on West 8th Street near
downtown Los Angeles in 1994. Oaxacans flocked there for a taste of
home, as Maria predicted, and also to socialize with other
immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, Soledad opened another Guelaguetza on Palms Boulevard
near Sepulveda, where she cooks in her own style. This restaurant
gained national attention when Martha Stewart filmed the making of
black mole tamales, enchiladas and chicken with black mole sauce
there in February for her television show.</TE>
<TE>   On the Westside, Oaxacan restaurants had already become mainstream
places to eat out, like corner Chinese and Thai, inspiring hot
debates about their merits and luring Westsiders to delve more
thoroughly into the cuisine.</TE>
<TE>   The downtown Guelaguetza restaurant was so popular with Oaxacans
that Fernando Lopez realized he needed more space. Two years ago, he
opened a larger Guelaguetza on Olympic Boulevard in a building that
formerly housed a Korean restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   On the outside, at least, the building remains traditionally
Korean, with a tiled roof and dramatically upsweeping eaves. But this
cavernous Guelaguetza in the heart of Koreatown is a magnet for
Oaxacans, who gather there to celebrate birthdays and anniversaries,
or just to relax in familiar surroundings. Well before noon on
Sundays, the restaurant is jammed with families. Vendors stroll from
table to table, offering bouquets for the women. A smartly dressed
trio sings almost nonstop.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a landmark place for Oaxacans to congregate, a place to
go and sort of feel at home," Rivera says. "One of the wonders of
this restaurant is that it has almost created a sense of Oaxaca here
in the heart of Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   The food has to be good. "Oaxacans are very tough customers,"
Rivera says. "They demand something traditional." And they want
authentic ingredients--the herbs, cheeses, special cuts of meat,
chocolate, breads and spices that they knew in Oaxaca. Rather than
accepting bland American copies of the string cheese called quesillo,
they buy the real thing at Oaxacan markets and delis.</TE>
<TE>   The long menus at the Guelaguetzas serve as guides to the dishes
you would find not only here but also in Oaxaca city. These include
several types of mole, enchiladas with mole sauce and other tortilla
dishes such as entomadas, enfrijoladas and chilaquiles.</TE>
<TE>   The huge, tostada-like clayuda is made with an extra-large and
sturdy but thin tortilla baked on a clay griddle. Other corn dough
specialties include hand-shaped oval or round memelas and empanadas,
which resemble giant quesadillas. Then there are fried or grilled
meats such as cecina, a thin cut of pork marinated with red chiles,
and salted, thinly sliced beef, called tasajo.</TE>
<TE>   Chiles that are specific to Oaxaca include the dried chile pasilla
de Oaxaca, which has a rich, almost bacony smoked flavor; the dark,
squat chilhuacle chile, which helps to color mole negro; and fresh
chiles de agua. Two anise-flavored leaves widely used in Oaxacan
dishes are hierba santa, which comes from a plant as large as a small
tree, and hojas de aguacate, the leaves of a Mexican avocado.</TE>
<TE>   All of these are available at restaurants and stores in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Aqui es Oaxaca, a small store in a corner mall on the Westside, is
packed with essential ingredients and baked goods, ranging from
asiento, a brown pork fat paste used as a seasoning, to pan de
cazuela, a Oaxacan sweet bread that contains a layer of chocolate.
This shop also stocks Oaxacan herbs such as hierba de conejo (rabbit
herb), used to season black beans; dried chepil, which is added to
tamales; and Oaxacan thyme, which is considered more fragrant than
the usual thyme.</TE>
<TE>   The store even has cacao flowers, one of the components of tejate,
a foamy cocoa-colored drink typically sold in markets in Oaxacan
towns. Almost all Oaxacan bakeries sell pan de yema, a light,
anise-scented egg bread for dipping in hot chocolate.</TE>
<TE>   Place names that represent loyalty to the homeland crop up
frequently in the Los Angeles Oaxacan community. Tlapazola restaurant
in West Los Angeles is named for San Marcos Tlapazola, the hometown
of the owners, Celerino Cruz, who is the chef, and his brother,
Samuel. The inventive cuisine there has made the restaurant so
popular it is crowded even on weeknights.</TE>
<TE>   The ruins of the Zapotec capital provided the name for Monte Alban
restaurant in Santa Monica. Murals on the walls surround diners with
scenes of Mexico, including motifs that represent Monte Alban and
other ruins at Mitla. A few blocks east is Juquila restaurant, named
for a town with an image of the Virgin that is widely venerated. On
Dec. 8, thousands of worshipers flock there for a festival in her
honor.</TE>
<TE>   El Texate restaurant in Santa Monica calls to mind the drink,
usually spelled tejate, that it serves on the weekends. Hanging on
the walls are photographs of Benito Juarez, the Zapotec who became
president of Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   The state of Oaxaca is divided into seven regions, thus a
restaurant and a nearby bakery in Pico-Union called Las Siete
Regiones de Oaxaca. Dolls in regional costumes decorate one wall of
the restaurant. Panaderia Antequera, a tiny bakery in Santa Monica,
carries the Spanish colonial name for Oaxaca city.</TE>
<TE>   In the next block is Artesanias Oaxaquenas, which stocks many
items related to the Day of the Dead, the November holiday when
Oaxacans set up special altars with foods for their departed
relatives and throng into cemeteries for elaborate celebrations.</TE>
<TE>   The Guelaguetzas are named for Oaxaca's most important cultural
festival, an extravaganza of regional dancing, music and food that
takes place on two Mondays in the month of July. This year,
immigrants from 50 Oaxacan communities will stage a similar festival
in the Sports Arena May 26.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to food, Oaxacan shops offer a wide variety of crafts.
Most notable is the famous black pottery from San Bartolo Coyotepec.
But there is also green-glazed pottery from Santa Maria Atzompa and
alebrijes, hand-carved wooden figures made in towns such as San
Martin Tilcajete.</TE>
<TE>   At Aqui es Oaxaca you can also find copal incense. Artesanias
Oaxaquenas even carries a Zapotec dictionary ("Diccionario Zapoteco
de San Lucas Quiavini," published by the Chicano Studies Research
Center at UCLA).</TE>
<TE>   The Oaxacan population in Los Angeles is steadily growing, which
probably means that there will be more restaurants and shops and more
local production of ingredients that now are hard to find. Even
today, Soledad Lopez of the Westside Guelaguetza occasionally can
obtain tender squash vine shoots for a soup called sopa de guias and
fresh chepil, but only for a brief season.</TE>
<TE>   Some Oaxacan dishes and ingredients are still hard to come by, for
example, pan dulce baked in wood-fired ovens, tortillas made from
black corn, empanadas toasted on a clay griddle over a wood fire, and
drinks made from fruits that either don't grow here or aren't
available commercially.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Lopez says, in Los Angeles she can cook "exactly the same"
as in Oaxaca, except for toning down the spices slightly. But while
her menu is long, it by no means explores all the dishes that could
be made here. "There are so many--so many more," she says.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Many of the distinctive ingredients required for Oaxacan dishes are
available here, either imported from Oaxaca or produced locally.</LD>
<LD>   * Asiento--This soft, pale brown paste, made from the fat used for
frying chicharrones, is an important Oaxacan condiment. Look for it
in refrigerator cases in Oaxacan delis.</LD>
<LD>   * Avocado leaves--The leaves of a fragrant Mexican avocado tree
add an anise-like flavor to black beans, barbacoa and other dishes.
Dried leaves are occasionally available in Oaxacan shops.</LD>
<TE>   * Black beans--The black bean is a basic accompaniment to Oaxacan
meals.</TE>
<TE>   * Cecina--Thinly sliced pork either plain (cecina blanca) or
marinated with red chile (cecina enchilada). Oaxacan meat shops sell
cecina both ways.</TE>
<TE>   * Chapulines--Tiny grasshoppers that thrive in the milpas
(cornfields) in Oaxaca. Sun-dried and fried to a dull red color,
they're a popular snack.</TE>
<TE>   * Chepil--The small leaf of a bushy plant, fresh chepil is often
added to tamales or rice. Dried chepil is more likely to be available
here.</TE>
<TE>   * Chilacayota--The pulp of this large green and white squash is
shredded and added to a sweet drink called agua de chilacayota.
Oaxacan growers raise chilacayota in California. It can be found at
some farmers markets.</TE>
<TE>   * Chile de agua--A fresh green chile with orange markings, similar
to the Anaheim chile in shape but shorter. It is often available in
Oaxacan shops.</TE>
<TE>   * Chile chilhuacle--A squat, dark dried chile that is essential to
Oaxacan black mole. It is brought here from Oaxaca.</TE>
<TE>   * Chile costeno--A small dried red chile, Oaxacan costeno can be
found at some shops here.</TE>
<TE>   * Chile pasilla de Oaxaca--Also known as pasilla mixe, this dark
dried chile has a pleasant smoky taste. In Oaxaca it is sometimes
stuffed. Like chile chilhuacle, it is a specialty item available only
in Oaxacan stores.</TE>
<TE>   * Chocolate--Chocolate shops in Oaxaca grind cacao beans with
sugar and flavorings such as almonds, cinnamon and vanilla to produce
chocolate for use in moles and to combine with milk or water as a hot
drink. One leading brand sold here is Mayordomo.</TE>
<TE>   * Chorizo--Small, round sausages that retain their shape when
cooked. They are seasoned differently from the crumbly Mexican
chorizo sold in most markets.</TE>
<TE>   * Clayuda--Also called tlayuda, this is a giant thin corn tortilla
baked on a clay griddle. Clayudas are chewier than ordinary corn
tortillas and keep for weeks. Look for them in Oaxacan shops.</TE>
<TE>   * Flor de calabaza--Fresh squash flowers appear in many Oaxacan
dishes, including soups and large tortilla turnovers called
empanadas.</TE>
<TE>   * Hierba santa--A large, anise-scented leaf used in a variety of
Oaxacan dishes. The fresh leaves occasionally appear in Mexican
markets.</TE>
<TE>   * Mole pastes--In Oaxaca, cooks may prepare their own mole
seasonings and take them to a mill for grinding, but they also use
premixed pastes, which they season to taste. Oaxacan-style mole
pastes can be purchased here.</TE>
<TE>   * Quesillo--A flavorful string cheese formed into long ribbons
that are wrapped in a ball. American-made versions available in
supermarkets may look the same, but they lack the flavor of the
Oaxacan original. Bakeries, delis and Oaxacan markets usually have
Oaxacan quesillo.</TE>
<TE>   * Queso--The Oaxacan version of queso fresco, a crumbly, soft
cheese used as a garnish and in dishes such as chiles rellenos. Shops
that carry quesillo usually have Oaxacan queso too.</TE>
<TE>   * Tasajo--Thinly sliced salt-cured beef.</TE>

the chilacayota squash, bits of fresh pineapple and lime peel.</LD>
<LD>   * Barbacoa--Goat or lamb cooked in a red chile sauce flavored with
avocado leaves.</LD>

tomato-chile sauce. In Oaxaca, torn-up clayudas are sometimes used.</LD>
<TE>   * Chocolate--Hot chocolate is made with either water or milk and
is served with a sweet, anise-seasoned bun called pan de yema.</TE>
<TE>   * Clayuda--A large, thin, chewy corn tortilla that is seasoned
with asiento, then coated with black bean puree and topped with
quesillo and vegetables, or with cecina (chile-marinated pork),
tasajo (cured beef) and/or chorizo.</TE>
<TE>   * Empanada--Not the familiar pastry turnover but a large, handmade
corn tortilla folded around a filling such as huitlacoche, squash
flowers with quesillo or chicken with mole amarillo, then grilled.</TE>
<TE>   * Entomatadas--Folded tortillas that are fried, then dipped in a
tomato-chile sauce.</TE>
<TE>   * Enfrijoladas--Folded tortillas that are fried, then dipped in a

<TE>   * Horchata con tuna y nuez--A white drink made from ground rice or
almonds, topped with chopped pecans, diced cantaloupe and cactus
fruit marmalade.</TE>
<TE>   * Memela--Flat, oval cake of corn masa that is pinched up at the
edges, spread with asiento and sprinkled with cheese. Memelas are
often topped with tomato sauce or black beans.</TE>
<TE>   * Mole--Oaxaca is known as the land of the seven moles, but there
are many more, taking into account variations from cook to cook.
Moles served in restaurants here include:</TE>
<TE>   * Mole negro--The leading Oaxacan mole, black mole is composed of
chiles, nuts, seeds, bread, bananas, raisins, tomatoes, chocolate and
other ingredients.</TE>
<TE>   * Mole amarillo--A yellow mole seasoned with cumin and cloves and
thickened with masa.</TE>
<TE>   * Mole coloradito--A slightly sweet orange mole.</TE>
<TE>   * Mole estofado--A slightly sweet mole made without chiles.</TE>
<TE>   * Mole rojo--A red version of mole negro that is not as dark
because the proportions are different and the chiles are not toasted.</TE>
<TE>   * Mole verde--Green mole, colored and flavored with fresh
ingredients such as tomatillos, green chiles and the leaf hierba
santa.</TE>
<TE>   * Nicuatole--A pudding that is similar to flan but based on corn
and coated with cerise coloring instead of caramel syrup.</TE>
<TE>   * Pan de yema--A lightly sweetened bun or round loaf seasoned with
anise and topped with sesame seeds.</TE>
<TE>   * Tamales--Oaxacan tamales are often, but not always, wrapped in
banana leaves. A favorite filling is chicken in black mole. For
chepil tamales, the tiny chepil leaf is mixed into the dough. Tamales
are also made with rajas (chile strips), mole amarillo and mole
verde. Black bean tamales often contain an avocado leaf. Fruits such
as pineapple and raisins are added to sweet tamales.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Italians love their bacon, as we do, but pancetta isn't the bacon you
may be used to.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike American bacon, pancetta is not sliced from a slab but
rolled into a neat cylinder. It's also not smoked but pepper-cured.
It's even eaten raw on crostini and in sandwiches.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, you can also cook your pancetta and enjoy it in this
pasta dish along with good bread and fresh grapes for dessert.</LD>
<TE>   Pasta With Radicchio and Pancetta</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 15 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 25 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   1 pound short pasta, such as fusilli</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon olive oil</TE>
<TE>   1/2 pound pancetta, diced</TE>
<TE>   1 large onion, diced</TE>
<TE>   1 large head radicchio, sliced</TE>
<TE>   2 heads Belgian endive, sliced</TE>
<TE>   1 cup chicken broth</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons butter</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano</TE>
<TE>   Pepper</TE>
<TE>   Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Cook
the pasta until al dente, about 12 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   While the pasta cooks, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over
medium-high heat. Add the pancetta and cook, stirring, until it
starts to brown lightly and begins to crisp, about 5 minutes. Add the
onion and continue to cook, stirring frequently, until it has
softened slightly, about 3 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Add the radicchio and endive, increase the heat to high and
continue cooking until they begin to brown, about 4 to 5 minutes. Add
the chicken broth, reduce the heat to medium and simmer until the
liquid has reduced by a third, about 3 to 4 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Drain the pasta and add to the skillet. Stir to combine, then add
the butter, cheese and pepper to taste.</TE>
<TE>   Taste and correct the seasoning.</TE>

<LD>"I really like the Merry Edwards 1999 Pinot Noir 'Russian River
Valley.' As everyone attempts to capitalize on Pinot Noir's recent
surge in popularity, many veteran winemakers are producing hugely
extracted, overripe, high-alcohol wines, which show none of the
elegance, grace and balance true advocates of this varietal have
grown to love. Often, these wines are not even identifiable as Pinot
Noir. Unfortunately, some critics are giving these over-the-top
efforts high marks, which further fuels the problem. Thank you, Merry
Edwards, for creating this spectacular wine, and for understanding
that the silky, sensual nature of great Pinot Noir is not obtainable
from overripe fruit or heavy-handed winemaking."</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>DEAR SOS: Lucques on Melrose Avenue has the best grilled chicken with
fennel. Can you get it?</LD>
<LD>   BREE CROCETTI</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles</LD>
<TE>   DEAR BREE: Yes. Suzanne Goin, the chef at Lucques, says, "Beware!
The chicken will make a mess on your grill but will taste delicious."
She's right; it is delicious.</TE>
<TE>   Mustard Grilled Chicken With Fennel, Roasted Shallots and Mustard
Greens</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 45 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1  1/2
hours plus 8 hours marinating</TE>
<TE>   The restaurant goes a step further in preparing the chickens,
which you can do if you'd like: After cutting the chickens in half
down the backbone, clip the wings and completely bone them except for
the drumsticks. You can also cut the chicken in quarters, if you
prefer.</TE>
<TE>   CHICKEN</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup Dijon mustard</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons whole-grain mustard</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons vermouth</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</TE>
<TE>   1/2 tablespoon chopped fresh tarragon</TE>
<TE>   1 beaten egg</TE>
<TE>   2 (3-pound) chickens, cut in half down the backbone</TE>
<TE>   Combine the Dijon and whole-grain mustards, the vermouth, oil,
tarragon and egg. Marinate the chicken by slathering it with the
mustard mixture in a shallow glass dish. Make sure to get the
marinade under the skin. Cover and refrigerate overnight.</TE>
<TE>   CROUTONS</TE>
<TE>   1 cup cubed sourdough bread</TE>
<TE>   1/2 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 375 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Toss the bread with the olive oil on a baking sheet and toast
until golden brown, about 5 minutes. The croutons should be crisp but
still tender inside.</TE>
<TE>   ASSEMBLY</TE>
<TE>   1/2 tablespoon butter</TE>
<TE>   5 shallots, cut in half lengthwise, each half cut into 3 wedges</TE>
<TE>   Dash fresh thyme leaves</TE>
<TE>   Salt, pepper</TE>
<TE>   1/2 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</TE>
<TE>   1 fennel bulb, cut into 8 wedges</TE>
<TE>   1 large shallot, sliced</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup vermouth</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons chicken stock</TE>
<TE>   1 bunch mustard greens, rinsed and stemmed</TE>
<TE>   Heat the butter in a skillet over medium-low heat until it foams.
Add the shallot wedges, thyme and salt and pepper and cook until the
shallots are softened and a deep caramel brown, about 15 minutes. Set
aside.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat and add the
fennel wedges. Season with salt and pepper and sear the fennel
gently. As the fennel begins to brown, turn the wedges over and
scatter in the sliced shallots. Cook until the shallots are tender, 2
to 3 minutes. Add the vermouth and cook until reduced by half, about
5 minutes. Add the chicken stock and simmer until the fennel is
tender, 5 minutes. Add the reserved shallots and the mustard greens
and stir until the greens have wilted, about 5 minutes. Add the
croutons and toss to coat them with fennel and shallot juices.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, heat the grill to medium heat. Grill the chickens, skin
side down, until the skin is brown and bubbly, about 10 minutes. Turn
the chickens over and cook the other side until the chicken is cooked
through and the juices run clear when the chicken is pierced with a
fork, 15 to 20 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Divide the warm bread salad mixture among large dinner plates.
Place the chicken on top. Serve immediately.</TE>

<HD>Cabernet Lovers--You Can Overcome Napaddiction</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES E. OLKEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Napa Valley" and "Cabernet Sauvignon" go together so often they
almost seem synonymous. But there are some fine Cabs being made
outside Napa, and they're usually more reasonably priced.</LD>
<LD>   Cabernet is happy to grow in a wide variety of vineyard sites. It
makes decent wines from as far south as Paso Robles to as far north
as Washington's Columbia Valley. There is a difference, of course,
between the great wines of the world and their good but less
magnificent relatives. The wines here may not always be filled with
the currant-like, loamy, rich, expensively oaked qualities found in
the $100 (and higher) wines that rule the roost in Napa and Bordeaux.</LD>
<LD>   But even when Cabernet isn't world class, it is capable of
delivering attractive fruit and solid structure with a sinew not so
easily captured (or even desired) in Zinfandel, Merlot or Pinot Noir.
One of the great things about Cabernet is that it can be so enjoyable
even when the wine is a little bit on the tough side. That does not
change even when the grape is grown in places that are not the
all-hallowed Napa Valley.</LD>
<TE>   1999 Boeger Winery, El Dorado, $13. This wine doesn't knock my
socks off--very few Sierra foothills Cabs do--but it has solid
Cabernet structure and hints of varietal character to go with its
somewhat blunt construction.</TE>
<TE>   * 1998 Raymond Burr Winery, Dry Creek Valley, $35. A bit pricey,
even though it seems a bargain when tasted next to some Napa Cabs
selling for twice as much, this wine from a weak vintage captures
enough richness and depth to make up for the slight shortfall in
fruit that follows.</TE>
<TE>   * 1999 Canoe Ridge Winery, Columbia Valley, $25. In general, the
red wines of the Columbia Valley tend to be on the luscious and
supple side, but this youngster has apparently forgotten where it's
from. It is open in aroma but tight and tannic on the palate. You
will like its distinctive black cherry fruit and its engaging
richness, but you will probably like it better in three to five years
when it has had a chance to soften.</TE>
<TE>   ** 1998 Chateau Ste. Michelle "Reserve," Columbia Valley, $30.
Like its neighbor above, this impressive wine starts with open, rich
and complex aromas, but this time the flavors are just deep and
complex enough to rate an extra star. Its engaging nose of raspberry
and currant follows through in fairly deep flavors that are well
carried by the wine's supple texture. Only in the finish do tannin
and alcohol make their presence known. It will be better in a few
years, but very few Cabernets anywhere in the world rival this superb
effort for the combination of high quality and value.</TE>
<TE>   * 1999 Justin Vineyards, Paso Robles, $20. In theory, the hot
climate of Paso Robles is better suited to Zinfandel and Syrah, but
Justin Vineyards and others are showing that Cabernet can thrive
there when properly grown and handled. This wine is all about
ripeness, with its compact, concentrated black cherry and dried herb
nose and its notes of chocolate. As with so many wines from Paso
Robles, the center is open and fleshy. In this case, the wine's
moderate tannins allow that center to come through. It is very tasty
stuff right now and will age for another three to five years.</TE>
<TE>   ** 1997 Kenwood Vineyards "Artist Series," Sonoma County, $70.
Yes, this is an expensive wine, but it's also a very serious one.
Kenwood's "Artist Series" Cabs are a bit rough-hewn, but often they
are also deep and complex. In 1997, a good vintage for Cabernet, the
wine is filled with cassis and ripe black cherry fruit with vanilla
and a hint of sweet earthiness for complexity. If not wildly tannic,
the wine nonetheless has mass to go with its depth and will age for
at least six to eight years.</TE>
<TE>   $* 1999 St. Francis Vineyards, Sonoma County, $16. Here is an
open, rounded Cabernet whose ripe cherry, vanilla and creme brulee
aromas have the layering of more expensive wines. This one may lack
the depth and age-worthiness one sees in more substantial (and more
expensive) bottlings, but it comes with only a little of Cabernet's
usual muscle and, thus, is ready to drink right away.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Symbols</TE>
<TE>   ***A world-class wine, superb by any measure, the top 1% to 2% of
all wines tasted.</TE>
<TE>   **An exceptional wine, well worth the effort to find, 10% to 12%
of wines tasted.</TE>
<TE>   *An admirable wine, tasty, focused, attractive, about 25% of wines
tasted.</TE>
<TE>   No Rating: The best are quite pleasant and can be good buys when
moderately priced.</TE>
<TE>   $Good value for the money.</TE>
<TE>   Below average quality, to be avoided.</TE>

<LD>Lax-C is a warehouse-style market in downtown Los Angeles where you
can buy almost anything required for Asian cooking. Tucked in a
corner of this vast space is Lax-C B-B-Q Express, which sells Thai
food to go including cooked dishes and a great variety of sweets. One
day's selection included tod mun gai--sliced chicken on rice,
garnished with cucumber slices and accompanied by a spicy dipping
sauce. This is the Thai version of Hainan chicken rice, a Chinese
food-stall favorite in Singapore. The chicken is poached, producing
the broth that is used to cook the rice. Thais make the dip with
black bean sauce, fish sauce, sweet soy sauce, ginger, lime juice and
plenty of super-hot Thai chiles.</LD>

located inside Lax-C market, 1100 N. Main Street, Los Angeles. (323)

<HD>Two New Indian Cookbooks Full of Color</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>

<LD>Indian cookbooks seem to be popping up one after another, and that's
not a bad thing. The hallmark of Indian cuisine is its
freshness--vegetables come straight from produce sellers, not from
cans or freezers. Healthy ingredients such as yogurt and lentils are
major players. Expertly blended spices boost flavors and make each
dish seem different.</LD>
<LD>   These qualities link the recipes in two recent books, although in
approach they vary tremendously. One emphasizes culture and customs,
the other is by a London restaurateur.</LD>
<LD>   "Savoring India" (Time Life Books; $39.95) came out under the
auspices of the cookware chain Williams-Sonoma as part of an ongoing
series that explores international cuisines. Last monthit was named
the best international cookbook of the year by the International
Association of Culinary Professionals.</LD>
<TE>   The author is Julie Sahni, who has her own series of Indian
cookbooks. This lends authority to the recipes, but what really may
entice you to buy this book is its gorgeous photographs. If you've
never been to India, they'll make you feel you know the country.
Along with commentary on the food, there are passages devoted to the
elephant god, Ganesha; serpent worship, the relation of religion to
food, the annual Diwali festival and the history of the tandoor oven.</TE>
<TE>   Recipes include standards such as samosas and tandoori chicken,
but also less widely known dishes such as Sindhi eggplant with
tamarind sauce and Madras stir-fried rice noodles with coconut, and
some Raj dishes--kidneys on toast and yogurt soup with pineapple and
fruit. The recipes come from all over India.</TE>
<TE>   "The New Tastes of India" by Das Sreedharan (Headline; $24.95)
throws a rather weird curve. The quote at the top of the bright pink
cover says it's "a really wicked book." Turn the pages, though, and
you'll find nothing more wicked than a lot of bright color setting
off the chapter introductions. They must mean wicked in a good way.</TE>
<TE>   Founder of the Rasa restaurants in London, Sreedharan has included
some of his own specialties and innovations, but the real focus is
the vegetarian cooking of the southern state of Kerala, where he was
born. Among the more unusual dishes are nellika curry, made with
gooseberries; a guava coconut salad, samosas filled with mushrooms
and cashews and a curry that contains almost half a pound of
garlic--wicked indeed.</TE>

<DH>1994 Bodega Palacios Remondo "Herencia Remondo Gran
Reserva," Rioja, Spain</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. Irene Virbila</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This wine shows why 1994 is considered a spectacular vintage in
Rioja. Scents of leather and autumn, sweet ripe fruit and burnished
tannins weave a marvelously complex blend of flavors that will only
improve as it matures. The price is a bargain for a gran reserva.
With this vintage, the famous old Palacios Remondo estate has
regained its focus.</LD>
<LD>   About $34. Available at L.A. Wine Company in Marina del Rey, (310)
306-9463; Vicente Foods, (310) 472-5215 and Bicentennial 13 in Los

<LD>For a moment, the towering presence of Laker Coach Phil Jackson
upstages "Spider-Man" stars Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst at the
film's Westwood premiere Monday night.</LD>
<LD>   Hordes of star-struck fans roar as the 6-foot-9-inch Jackson steps
onto the red carpet. One man waves a Lakers jersey. (The team beat
Portland last weekend and is poised to play in the Western Conference
semifinals Sunday.) Teen reporter Fred Medill scrambles with his
microphone when he spots Jackson. Then, he pitches a question on game
strategy. "Find a way to win the first game," Jackson says sagely.
"It's always important to start a series that way."</LD>
<LD>   A trio of girls in baggy clothes and braces on their teeth stands
a few feet away behind a metal barrier. When a bejeweled Steven Tyler
lopes by, they stare so intensely that the rock star shouts out to
them: "What're you looking at?" The bravest of the group shouts back,
"Nothing!" and then dissolves in a fit of giggles. Moments later, the
girls devise a plan to impersonate reporters. "We could say we're
from Nickelodeon," one suggests. They slip past the barrier and cozy
up to a British TV crew. No one seems to mind. "Here comes someone!"
one girl shouts as Cliff Robertson heads their way.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Maguire stands on a platform with the E! network crew,
talking about the fateful decision at age 12 that led to his career.
"I was going to take home economics, because I liked cooking,"
Maguire says. Instead, he opted for acting class.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the Mann Village Theater, industry people crowd the aisles,
although the film is about to start. "I want that job more than any
other job in the world," one gray-haired, suited man tells another.
"Oh!" says a woman to a friend. "You smell like Hawaii!"</TE>
<TE>   Gene Simmons walks in with an armload of popcorn. Jon Voight
greets Cuba Gooding Jr. as he and his children find their seats. Next
to Gooding's family, a young actor from Australia recites the four
lines from his first film, a Jerry Bruckheimer picture called "Down
and Under."</TE>
<TE>   Soon the lights dim. The actor ceases his impromptu performance as
the previously self-absorbed crowd erupts into loud cheers, marking
the start of yet another successful movie premiere in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Turning Restaurants Into His Stage</TE>
<TE>   Chef Mario Batali's fantasy week includes a stay at the Sunset
Marquis Hotel in West Hollywood (for its "air of rock 'n' roll"), two
days at the Getty Museum (browsing), a Thursday at La Brea Bakery
(for its grilled cheese night,) and a visit to Santa Monica (for a
peek at the ocean.) But for real Los Angeles flavor, this New
Yorker's first stop would be Pink's for hot dogs.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, when Batali breezed through town last weekend, his
stay included none of these sensory experiences.</TE>
<TE>   Rather, Batali spent his days promoting "The Babbo Cookbook" at
the L.A. Times Festival of Books, and his nights doing what he does
very well--which is cook.</TE>
<TE>   His appearance at Campanile on Friday drew hundreds of food lovers
who came to sample his take on Italian cuisine.</TE>
<TE>   "Food has become one of our intellectual and mental pursuits,"
said Batali, via cell phone, while en route to Seattle. "It used to
be that people would go to the symphony and get a bite, or go to the
theater and get a bite." Now, he said, "the bite" has become the main
event.</TE>
<TE>   Batali cut his teeth at Le Cordon Bleu in London, and after a
stint cooking at a trattoria in the Northern Italian village Borgo
Capanne (his "three years in heaven"), Batali opened his first
restaurant, Babbo Ristorante e Enoteca, in Greenwich Village.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, he opened Lupa, a Roman-style trattoria, a wine shop
and Esca, a southern Italian seafood trattoria. He also hosts "Molto
Mario" and "Mario Eats Italy" on the Food Network.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a very hungry public for the new, the old, the
traditional, the intensely bizarre experience," he said. Diners, he
said, want to be amazed--"just as the theater might thrill you."</TE>
<TE>   Batali is a good example of how the restaurant has become a stage,
the chef a celebrity.</TE>
<TE>   Before becoming a star chef himself, Batali apprenticed with
British chef Marco Pierre White.</TE>
<TE>   The British public adored White's rebellious attitudes, and his
good looks didn't hurt either, said Batali, comparing him to punk
rocker Sid Vicious. Not that there's anything wrong with that.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not a bad-boy chef," explained Batali. "I'm more of a family
guy."</TE>

<HD>Barbie's Creator Has Died, but the Doll Has a Life of Her
Own</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER FREY</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Malibu Barbie. Princess Barbie. Doctor Barbie. NASCAR Barbie. Army
Barbie. Sleeping Beauty Barbie. Sign Language Barbie. President
Barbie ...</LD>
<LD>   Oh, how we have loved her. She has a horse, a camper, a dream
house! She has a pink convertible and a fabulous wardrobe and oh,
what a shoe collection! She even has a perfect boyfriend, the kind
that can be parked in a shoe box for days, retrieved only in time to
play "Saturday night date" or "Barbie goes to the prom."</LD>
<LD>   She is hated, too, of course. How could she not be? With that
hair, those arched feet, that impossibly tiny waist ... those
breasts.</LD>
<TE>   Barbie is inescapable. She's like Elvis, McDonald's, the Yankees.
An American icon. Sold in 150 countries, a $2.5-billion-a-year
industry. Andy Warhol has a painting about her. The Smithsonian had
an exhibit in her honor. There have been Barbie art exhibits at chic
New York galleries. When Barbie first made her way to Moscow in 1992,
little girls stood outside the city's most famous toy store,
transfixed by the mere sight of her.</TE>
<TE>   "What they did was take a well-established play pattern--all the
fantasies that girls had at that time--and made a three-dimensional
character out of it," says Gary Niles, who worked for 18 years at
Mattel, which produces the doll. "How she became an icon, I don't
know. But she caught on."</TE>
<TE>   Barbie's creator, Ruth Handler, died Saturday in Los Angeles at
85. She and her husband, Elliot Handler, co-founded Mattel with
Harold Mattson.</TE>
<TE>   As a young woman, Ruth was an entrepreneur far ahead of her time
who found a niche in the toy market and turned it into a
multibillion-dollar business. Later in life, after breast cancer and
a mastectomy, she became an activist, making prosthetic breasts for
cancer patients.</TE>
<TE>   "How I identified her was not as the 'Barbie lady,'" says Douglas
Paul, Handler's great-nephew, who works at the Securities and
Exchange Commission. Paul and his four siblings lost their
grandmother, Handler's sister, when they were relatively young.
Handler filled the void.</TE>
<TE>   "We were at their house last August," says Paul, referring to the
Handlers. "Watching both my aunt and my uncle watch my kids with
their Hot Wheels and their Barbies to me was fascinating. Here's
another generation of kids just mesmerized."</TE>
<TE>   "In the beginning, girls would pore over little booklets
advertising Barbie outfits, debating which item to buy next. Fur
stoles. Ball gowns. Wedding dresses--even though, after 41 years of
dating, Ken still hasn't proposed.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, even in 1959, Barbie didn't need a husband.</TE>
<TE>   "There is an independence there, however weakly anchored," says
Mary Rogers, a University of West Florida professor of diversity
studies and applied research, and author of "Barbie Culture."</TE>
<TE>   "She is her own person. She is not primarily somebody else's
partner. She is not primarily somebody else's mom. She is not
primarily somebody else's right-hand person. She is kind of unto
herself....I think that independence is where some of her
subconscious appeal is for young girls."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Barbie has had her image problems. Feminists, and some
health care advocates concerned with body image issues, decry her
proportions. There's that sticky little question of how, exactly, all
her internal organs would fit if she were translated into a
5-foot-6-inch teenager--with proportions of 39-21-33. Teen Talk
Barbie upset educators when one of her phrases happened to be "Math
class is tough," a sentence that many saw as reinforcing the
stereotype of girls' aversion to math.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Barbie got a make-over, primarily to eliminate that
waistline "seam" that was always there to make her more poseable. Her
new body is a little more athletic, a little less bright-eyed, a
little less beach blond and a little less ... va-va-va-voom. The
breasts shrank. A little. So did the hips.</TE>
<TE>   The game remains the same. Make-believe. Pretend. Dress up. These
are at the core of little-girl games, and Mattel has stacks of
research to prove it. Malibu Barbie and her friend Skipper go to the
beach. Barbie is the teacher, and she fails Ken in English. Fashion
Plate Barbie goes to a photo shoot, after a full day at the beauty
salon. Marine Barbie saves the world!</TE>

<LD>Coaching Little League is great, except of course for all these kids.
Kids are ruining Little League. And I'm not the first one to notice.</LD>
<LD>   "You know, this would be a lot of fun," Coach Bill tells me, "if
it wasn't for all these kids."</LD>
<LD>   "Ever get that ceiling fan up?" I ask.</LD>
<TE>   "Took me twice," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Pretty good," I say.</TE>
<TE>   This is how Bill and I coach. We'll talk first about softball,
then digress to something really important, like home repair or the
pleasures of working with Lorraine, our assistant coach, who becomes
more lovely and charming with every passing spring--unlike Coach Bill
and me, who age like milk.</TE>
<TE>   "Your new kitchen, is it done yet?" Bill asks.</TE>
<TE>   "Not till 2010," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "That soon?" he asks.</TE>
<TE>   "Strike three!" yells the umpire.</TE>
<TE>   Each spring, Coach Bill and I reunite like this, with a dozen
players and Coach Lorraine, too. We've been doing it for four years
now. Even so, there are always new things to learn.</TE>
<TE>   "What just happened?" Lorraine asks after some bizarre play.</TE>
<TE>   "Beats me," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "You see that new restaurant on Foothill?" Coach Bill asks.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, we're 3-0 this season, one of spring's better surprises. You
have your Boston Red Sox off to a fast start. Your Montreal Expos,
too. Then there's the Blue Bombing Patriot Babes. Team payroll? Zero.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, the Patriot Babes are undefeated, and as suspicious as we are
of winning and what it does to people, we're still enjoying it a good
bit. Enjoying it while it lasts. Because nothing really lasts. Not
even second childhoods.</TE>
<TE>   "Anybody got a hairbrush?" the little girl yells. "Anybody?"</TE>
<TE>   Our secret? A merciless work ethic.</TE>
<TE>   Before each game, I make a special stop for gum and sunflower
seeds. Coach Bill hauls around all this gear to every game. Coach
Steve even brings his hitting machine, a strange, multi-winged
apparatus that resembles a pterodactyl.</TE>
<TE>   So we've taken this season pretty seriously. For two practices in
a row, we worked on grounders.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there's this feeling that we've been blessed. Twelve times,
to be exact. Nine starters. Three reserves.</TE>
<TE>   "Just throw strikes," one of the dads hollers to our pitcher,
who's out on the mound, cool as a Hitchcock blond.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, just throw strikes," says another dad.</TE>
<TE>   "Duh, Coach," the pitcher must think. "What else would I try to
throw? Duhhhhh."</TE>
<TE>   "Just throw strikes," someone else hollers.</TE>
<TE>   Funny how the dads get into softball. We all scoffed two decades
ago when Title IX attempted to give girls an equal shot at sports.
Equal facilities? Equal spending? Yeah, right.</TE>
<TE>   In time, we had daughters, and if having a daughter doesn't change
your view on Title IX, nothing will.</TE>
<TE>   "How did a girl like you get to be a girl like you?" Cary Grant
once asked Eva Marie Saint.</TE>
<TE>   These days, the answer's Title IX.</TE>
<TE>   Now the fathers stand along the dugout doors, popping sunflower
seeds and yelling the same cliches dads used to yell only at their
sons. Nice cut! Good eye! Great scoop! It makes for great afternoons.
Well, most of the time.</TE>
<TE>   "She's out!" the opposing coach yells.</TE>
<TE>   "No, she's not!" I yell back.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, she is!" he screams.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Title IX has now come to this, too: two coaches
hollering across the infield at some $25-a-game ump over a rule no
one could be expected to know, let alone a 10-year-old girl.
Hollering.</TE>
<TE>   In the stands, the mothers are horrified, but only briefly. They
quickly go back to discussing fish marinades and the tricks to
getting accepted to a top state school.</TE>
<TE>   "At UCLA, no one gets in anymore. No one," one mom says, and the
acoustic rhythms of our little suburb quickly return.</TE>
<TE>   Behind the plate, the little red-haired girl kneels down in her
big brother's old catching gear, infield dirt under her nails, sweat
on her freckled brow.</TE>
<TE>   "Timeout!" she yells at least once an inning.</TE>
<TE>   "Timeout!" echoes the umpire.</TE>
<TE>   All game, we have these little conferences, the little girl and
me.</TE>
<TE>   She'll call timeout. I'll go, "What's wrong?" She'll go,
"Nothing." And the game will begin again.</TE>
<TE>   In softball, timeouts are unlimited. It's the slowest game since
chess, yet you can call timeout a hundred times.</TE>
<TE>   "What do you think they talk about?" Coach Bill asks me as the
little girl chats with the pitcher in front of the plate.</TE>
<TE>   "Ceiling fans," I say.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the other team's big hitter approaches the plate. Each
team has one or two big hitters, for whom the bat seems lighter and
gravity not such a burden.</TE>
<TE>   "Two outs!" screams the little girl, holding up two fingers.
"We've got two outs!"</TE>
<TE>   The batter takes practice swings like Barry Bonds, the artisan of
the home run, sweeping swings that fan the grass beneath them and
alter the flight paths of sparrows. The dreaded uppercut. The swing
only a sports agent could love.</TE>
<TE>   This will be part of Bonds' legacy, corrupting the swings of
10-year-old children. Frankly, I think that's a coach's job.</TE>
<TE>   "Two down!" screams the little girl.</TE>
<TE>   "Two down!" screams the shortstop.</TE>
<TE>   Behind the plate, the little girl settles into her catcher's
stance. She fits her brother's catcher's gear the way a canary fits
its cage. If she spun around quickly enough, her gear might never
move.</TE>
<TE>   "Timeout!" she says.</TE>
<TE>   "What now?" I ask.</TE>
<TE>   "Dad?"</TE>
<TE>   "What?"</TE>
<TE>   "Do your knuckles ever fall asleep?" she asks.</TE>
<TE>   "Every night," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "Play ball!" yells the umpire.</TE>
<TE>   And the Blue Bombing Patriot Babes march on.</TE>

<AU>MARY McNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For months my daughter and I had been the perfect driving companions.
As if by mutual consent, we kept our expectations of each other
fairly low. We sang a few songs, named a few colors, pointed out the
requisite choo-choos and flowers, played a round or two of "Where's
Fiona?" in the rearview mirror and then lapsed into amiable silence.</LD>
<LD>   Being my second, she was not subjected to the frenzied mania of
object identification that my son endured--I no longer think my
children's academic future depends on my exclaiming about the color
of every car we pass, and, frankly, I don't have the energy.</LD>
<LD>   Then she turned 2. Or rather, she turned 20 months, but for all
intents and purposes, it was 2. Suddenly, she was a child of
ever-shifting desire, yearning for contact, for silence, for her
window to be up, to be down, for her shoes to be on, to be off, for a
book, for her dolly, for her sippy cup that she had hurled to the
floor four times in as many minutes.</LD>
<TE>   And these are just the needs I was able to translate. As with many
of us, the depth of Fiona's longing often outstrips the limits of her
vocabulary. She relies then on a low-level whine, a keening, really,
that varies in key and volume depending on the circumstance. Words
surface in this relentless river of sound but too often they are
words that make no sense to me. They are recognizable--"sit down" and
"my box"--but they do not seem to have any relationship to the
situation.</TE>
<TE>   And so as I am driving, I find myself engaged in conversations
that can only be described as insane: "I am sitting down, you are
sitting down, who do you want to sit down? What box? Your lunch box?
Here, here is your lunch box. No? Then what do you want? Just tell
me. What do you want?"</TE>
<TE>   She repeats her requests over and over, and my voice rises and
grows tight. I feel like a Parisian stopped on the street by an
American who figures everyone can understand English if it is
repeated often and loudly. I too want to rattle off strings of
sophisticated phrases in French, turn on my heel and walk away, only
my French is fairly limited, and I am just trying to get us home.</TE>
<TE>   Forget driving under the influence of drugs and alcohol. It's
those of us driving under the influence of screaming toddlers who are
the real threats.</TE>
<TE>   Usually, I just turn on the stereo. I believe there are few
situations in a car that cannot be improved by playing "Dancing
Queen" or other tunes of my youth very loudly. My poor boomer
husband. Every so often he salts my CD player with classical music
and jazz in the hopes, I know, that I will not deaden his children's
musical palates. "I'm only listening to U2," I tell him through the
driver's side window even as the final strains of "Come On Eileen" or
"Tainted Love" hang in the air like illicit cigarette smoke.</TE>
<TE>   Lately, however, music has failed me. The various beasts in the
car remained savage, snarling even. For so long I have depended on
car rides to provide me solace; both my kids do well in the car, and
it is the only time I have that is not claimed by the physical needs
of work or motherhood, the only time I have to think. It seemed
supremely unfair that even this had now been taken from me.</TE>
<TE>   The other day, I could feel a shriek building inside, and so
instead of letting loose and startling all the elderly women waiting
for the walk sign on Broadway, I pulled over. Pulled over and got out
of the car. I don't know what I was thinking--that I could just walk
away from the whining crescendo in the back seat? That I could just
lay my head on the hood of the car and wait for the child's real
mother to appear? Who knows. I just didn't want to scream back at a
2-year-old. It is undignified and, more important, ineffective.</TE>
<TE>   So I stood for a minute leaning against the car, taking comfort
from the warm metal, and tried to think of a way to justify smoking
again. When I couldn't, I stuck my head in the back window to comfort
my restless and irritable daughter. I did my best Groucho
impersonation. I did my best Fiona impersonation. And then I broke
down and did the Big Sneeze. For quick turn-around on toddler
tantrums, it is difficult to beat the Big Sneeze.</TE>
<TE>   Pretty soon she was laughing, and if people walking past thought I
was insane, well, I am. But we made it home that day with no harm
done, and that's the main thing.</TE>

<HD>The Way to Go</HD>
<DH>The ancient Asian game is attracting American players,
drawn to the gentle competition that mixes strategy with creation of
visual patterns.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEVERLY BEYETTE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The silence is broken only by the faint beep-beep-beep of timers. At
long tables, players--one against one--bend over yellow boards marked
in squares. Soon, strategies will begin to take shape as opponents
position black and white stones at the intersections of the grid
lines.</LD>
<LD>   It is Saturday morning and, at a hotel near Los Angeles
International Airport, more than 100 Go enthusiasts have gathered to
compete for money, glory and ranking points at the two-day Cotsen
Open, from which one player will emerge $1,000 richer.</LD>
<LD>   Recording his every move on his laptop is Eric Cotsen, the
42-year-old Angeleno for whom this event is named in return for his
sponsorship to the tune of about $23,000.</LD>
<TE>   It is a surprisingly youngish crowd--indeed, two competitors are
only 9--and, not so surprisingly, one with a significant number of
Asian entrants. After all, Go is a game that originated in China
3,000, to 4,000 years ago and for centuries has been popular in Japan
and Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Most recently, the game figured in a scene from the Oscar-winning
"A Beautiful Mind," in which real-life Go enthusiast John Nash
(portrayed by Russell Crowe) is exercising his gray matter in a game
at Princeton.</TE>
<TE>   The game is not exactly sweeping the country. Indeed, laments Ray
Tayek of Lakewood, who's been playing for 30 years (he's wearing the
"Go Eat Stones!" T-shirt), "It's hard to compete with Nintendo and
those whiz-bang-shoot-'em-up games. Go's never going to be very
popular."</TE>
<TE>   Still, there are pockets of players throughout Los Angeles County.
Korean immigrants kicked things off, establishing a Go club in
Koreatown in 1972. The New York-based American Go Assn. has 2,000
dues paying members. But Larry Gross of Culver City, the
association's western region vice president, says there are "hundreds
of thousands" of players in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The association, waxing poetic, describes the game as "an intense
meditation, a mirror of one's personality, an exercise in abstract
reasoning or, when played well, a beautiful art in which black and
white dance across the board in delicate balance."</TE>
<TE>   In less abstract terms, this is what it's about: competing for
territory.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Go players insist, it is a gentle game. Sure, both players
are staking out their territory while putting the squeeze on the
opponent. But "you're not trying to kill; you're trying to co-exist,"
at least for a reasonable amount of time, says Gross. (He's the one
in the "Go for Yu" T-shirt). "With chess, you're trying to kill," and
it's curtains when you catch the opponent's king.</TE>
<TE>   Players, in turn, place their stones on the board. Once placed,
stones are never moved unless completely surrounded by the opponent,
at which time they are captured and taken off the board. When neither
player can make a move, the game is over. The player who has taken
the most territory wins the game.</TE>
<TE>   With Go, each stone is identical in value, and there is no one
essential territory to defend, as in chess. So the game undulates,
with different patterns emerging as players think and rethink their
strategies. It's left brain and right brain--about making pretty
shapes even while stalking your opponent. A blunder is a blunder, but
it is not necessarily fatal.</TE>
<TE>   Among players, the Koreans tend to be known as fierce fighters,
Gross says, and the Japanese are more like boa constrictors, slowly
putting on the squeeze. And the Americans? Gross laughs. "Elephants
who come stomping in--a little more aggressive. Americans don't tend
to be as poetic as the Japanese."</TE>
<TE>   Only a handful of women are among the competitors in this
tournament. "Unfortunate," but not surprising, observes Gross, as
perhaps only 15% of those on the U.S. Go circuit are women.
Traditionally, he notes, this was a game played by samurai, the
warrior aristocracy of Japan, when "the place of women wasn't such
that they would get involved."</TE>
<TE>   Ned and Joanna Phipps of Sonoma County are competing. "He and I
are the strongest married couple" playing today in the United States,
she says. "My first opponent today said he'd never played a woman. He
was surprised that 'for a woman' I was so strong," a comment that
caused her to bristle. She lost, she added, "but it was close."</TE>
<TE>   One of a handful of active professionals in the U.S., Yi Lun Yang,
51, of West Covina emigrated 16 years ago from Shanghai, where he was
also a pro. "I've made a really good life," he'll tell you. "I own
two houses and have many cars." (He charges about $25 a lesson and,
he says, can produce a competent Go player in about 50 lessons).</TE>
<TE>   Cotsen, who divides his time between homes in Westwood and Malibu,
learned at the hand of Yang. "The flaws you have in your character
are generally the flaws in your Go game," says Cotsen, whose
investments include the Princeton Review, which prepares students for
test taking and helps them choose colleges. "I'm very ADD," which
creates trouble focusing. "When I do focus, I tend to hyper-focus" on
killing a group of stones, he says, even though that loses the game.</TE>
<TE>   Curtis Tang, 9, of Alhambra has just beaten his 54-year-old
opponent in round one. He would go on to win four of his five games.</TE>
<TE>   Older players "don't scare me," says Curtis, who was introduced to
the game by his father. Curtis "at first didn't like it that much"
but discovered it was more fun when you win.</TE>
<TE>   He placed fourth as an 8-year-old representing the U.S. in the
junior division of the World Youth Go Championships last year in
Maui, the best result ever for an American junior.</TE>
<TE>   Go addicts can find someone to play on the Internet day or night.
But there is no computer software that's close to being able to
defeat a top Go player as IBM's Big Blue bested the world's best
chess player, Garry Kasparov, in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, a million-dollar prize was offered by the late Chinese
industrialist Ing Chang-Ki to the creator of a computer program that
could do just that. It expired with no winner. But the Intelligent Go
Foundation is encouraging development of sophisticated Go software.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have enough money to put up 1 million," says foundation
founder Bob Myers of Los Angeles." But the foundation last year
awarded $15,000 to the designer of the best software.</TE>
<TE>   To Myers, Go is "a fish tank in which to watch your thoughts and
emotions floating around like little goldfish. It's a weird
combination of mental, psychological and emotional."</TE>
<TE>   When the last stone was placed Sunday, the big winner was--no
surprise--the Chinese-born ranking player in the field, Jie Li, 20,
who is a business major at Foothill College in San Jose. It was deja
vu--he won the Cotsen the last time it was held, in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   He also bested a top-ranked professional in a game last year in
San Francisco and is the cover boy on the current issue of American
Go Journal. He thought he might use his $1,000 prize money to travel.</TE>
<TE>   His reputation had preceded him to this event. Said Li, "My first
opponent didn't even show up."</TE>

<HD>Passing the Pipe</HD>
<DH>The communal smoking of flavored tobacco in fancy water
pipes is a club and cafe craze.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE FREY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At an outdoor cafe in Pacific Beach, Ryan Sims is passed the pipe.
Taking the mouthpiece, he sucks in the sweet scent, then pauses a
moment. The 23-year-old exhales white wisps of strawberry, raspberry
and pineapple.</LD>
<LD>   "It's like smoking perfume," laughs his friend, Jaclyn Markle, 20.</LD>
<LD>   In Egypt, it's called a sheesha. In Turkey, it's called a nargile.
In California clubs and nightspots, it's called a hookah. Common
throughout the Middle East where it originated several hundred years
ago, the water pipe is popping up in American restaurants,
coffeehouses and bars.</LD>
<TE>   Many of the people lighting up are young--some still teens, most
college age--and include not only those who smoke other tobacco
products but those who consider themselves nonsmokers. Unlike smoking
cigarettes, traditional pipes and cigars, smoking a hookah is a
communal experience--more akin to the Native American tradition of
passing a peace pipe than grabbing a smoke to satisfy a nicotine
craving.</TE>
<TE>   Many users say that the flavored tobacco is easier to inhale than
that in cigarettes. The preferred pipe of the caterpillar in "Alice
in Wonderland," water pipes call for a leisurely pull, and by the
time the smoke is filtered through the water chamber and a long tube
and hits the lungs, it is cool. Variations on the water pipe
theme--especially the bong--have long been a staple of the head shops
that count pot and hashish smokers among their clientele. But, for
the generation currently discovering the pipes, this is not about
using illegal drugs--though it is a way to toy with one of the
symbols of that culture as well as sample a mild-tasting tobacco.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent Friday night in Pasadena, Rachel Lesky, 25, smoked a
hookah for the first time at an outside table--smoking being
prohibited nearly everywhere indoors--at Equator coffeehouse. Though
she is allergic to cigarette smoke, the fumes from the mixed fruit
tobacco didn't bother her. "It's really mellow and very calming,"
Lesky said. A few tables over, a half-dozen high school students
shared a hookah. The group usually gathers at the coffeehouse once a
week to smoke and socialize. "I don't like the taste of cigarettes,"
said a La Canada 18-year-old who ordered a hookah and was sharing it
with friends who were not old enough to buy tobacco, which is to say,
under 18. "You don't even feel it ... It's a great social event."</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, a sheesha or nargile is smoked after a meal or with
tea or coffee. A small bowl at the top of the pipe contains the
tobacco, which is heated by coals placed on a foil covering. When a
person inhales from an attached tube, smoke is drawn to the bottom of
the pipe, where it is filtered through water.</TE>
<TE>   The tobacco is mixed with fruit paste, molasses or honey for
flavor--apple, cola and mint are common--and lasts for about 15 to 30
minutes, depending upon the number of people smoking. Privately, some
people may smoke other substances, but those in the hookah business
say that their pipe is not designed for drugs such as pot. Still,
says Equator owner Teddy Bedjakian, "when you see [some people]
smoking it, they're smoking it like they're smoking weed. You can
hear them coughing."</TE>
<TE>   Mark Ascar first met the hookah in Egypt. While visiting there, he
and his friends often smoked at the end of the day or after a night
on the town. "That was the focal point," said Ascar, 26. "Everyone
[was] drinking, kicking back, puffing on hookahs."</TE>
<TE>   Four years ago, Ascar, a 1995 UCLA business graduate, returned
from one of his trips with several dozen hookahs and started selling
them on Venice Beach. Now Hookah Bros. manufacturers and distributes
water pipes to about 1,000 retailers, a combination of pipe shops and
restaurants, around the country from its Los Angeles warehouse. The
hookahs, which retail for approximately $65 to $300, stand from about
11/2 to 31/2 feet high and may have up to six tubes. Most have a
colored glass bowl at the base. Bright fabric--blue leopard print or
red flames--covers the tubes; plastic mouthpieces can be replaced for
each smoker.</TE>
<TE>   For many establishments, hookahs have become a profitable part of
their business. That has led many--from five-star restaurants to
trendy clubs--to add them to their menus, Ascar said.</TE>
<TE>   When a customer orders up a pipe, it comes with a pinch of tobacco
available in a variety of flavors. Ordering a hookah can cost
anywhere from $4 to $13; tobacco refills run about $5.</TE>
<TE>   Only those 18 and older can legally purchase tobacco, and most
places check IDs. Sinbad Cafe in San Diego County's Pacific Beach has
a bouncer who checks IDs at the door, and at Gypsy Cafe in Westwood,
owner Joseph Melamed even had a customer arrested for using a fake
ID. Some establishments, though, only require seeing the ID of the
person purchasing the hookah, not everyone smoking it. Which means
that at a table where an 18-year-old orders the pipe, there may well
be smokers under 18--usually classmates.</TE>
<TE>   Often located near college campuses, hookah bars have become a
popular hangout for the 18-to-21-year-old crowd. Gypsy Cafe and
Habibi Cafe are blocks from UCLA's campus, and Sinbad Cafe draws a
number of San Diego students in the area. Many people meet for a
smoke after--or sometimes instead of--the bar or club. "It's a good
place to come when you have a mixed party [of different ages]," said
Sims of Pacific Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Gypsy Cafe and Habibi Cafe in Westwood offer hookahs in addition
to Middle Eastern fare. Galaxy Gallery, a pipe shop and coffeehouse
on Melrose Avenue, lets customers smoke hookahs at outdoor tables or
purchase their own to take home. Arabian Nights in Long Beach boasts
low booths where patrons can smoke and watch belly dancing.</TE>
<TE>   Although those in the business say that the tobacco used in
hookahs has less nicotine than cigarettes and no tar, health experts
warn that all tobacco use poses some risk. John Wolfe, a respiratory
therapist who worked in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in the early 1990s,
said that though he appreciated the cultural significance of the
pipe, he hoped there was not widespread adoption in the United
States. "The bottom line is facts that apply to smoking cigarettes
apply to any nicotine product," said Wolfe, who also works with the
American Lung Assn. To date, there has been little study of the
health issues related to use of the hookah.</TE>
<TE>   Some observers expect interest in hookahs to burn out as it has
for other fads such as cigars. "None of them have had the impact [of
cigarettes]," said Danny McGoldrick, research director for the
Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. "Those types of products are going to
be short-term trends."</TE>
<TE>   For now, though, the smoke still lingers. On a busy weekend night,
Gypsy Cafe in Westwood serves up more than 100 hookahs, Melamed said.
Other business owners say the hookah break has become increasingly
popular as more people incorporate it into their lifestyles.</TE>
<TE>   In Egypt, for example, people smoke hookahs and play backgammon,
said Ascar of Hookah Bros. "Here you smoke a hookah and you watch the
Lakers."</TE>

<LD>Although it's always best for animals to take care of their own
newborns, sometimes it is necessary for humans to intervene and help
raise infant animals. A team of keepers assigned to the zoo's Winnick
Family Animal Care Center is responsible for hand-raising newborn
animals that need special care and attention. The center has an
incubator, rocking chairs, cribs, bottles, blankets and other things
necessary for a nursery.</LD>
<LD>   Most importantly, the zoo has various types of milk to meet the
needs of the different infant animals that need human care.</LD>
<LD>   They have goat's milk, cow's milk, human infant formula, puppy
formula and pig's formula. Most recently, zoo animals that have
needed cow's milk included baby giraffes and duikers (small
antelopes). Primates such as chimpanzees and spider monkeys are fed
human infant formulas--just like some of you when you were babies!</LD>
<TE>   Baby bottles are used for most of the feedings. However, keepers
sometimes also use syringes to feed small animals such as tamarins
(small primates), or they let older baby animals drink from a bowl.
Because nursing from their mother and drinking from a bottle with a
nipple are not the same, some infant animals take a few days to
adjust to feeding from a bottle. Once they learn to use a bottle,
they quickly gulp down their milk.</TE>
<TE>   Spring is a great time to see baby animals at the zoo. A giraffe,
chimpanzees, mountain tapir, cape vulture and ocelot are on exhibit
as part of the "Everybody Loves a Baby" event through May 31.
Visitors can take a self-guided tour to learn all about the baby
animals. During May, anyone who shows a picture of a baby will get a
discount on admission. For more zoo information, call (323) 644-6400
or visit www.lazoo.org.</TE>

<HD>In N.Y. Nightspots, Writers Mix Page and Stage</HD>
<DH>Readings, lectures get wry performance-style treatment in
clubs, eateries.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK ROZZO</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Their props are lecterns, overhead projectors and gin and tonics.
Sartorially they tend toward sweater vests, although
occasionally--when it feels right--they don loincloths. What they do
isn't traditional spoken word, and it's not quite improv. They're not
the brash types who mix it up at poetry slams, work their shtick at
open-mike comedy nights or dabble in performance art.</LD>
<LD>   They're people who work in the Conde Nast Building or spend their
days in Brooklyn apartments revising their next novels: young
writers, editors and agents, all leading typical lives of manuscript
queries, story meetings and book launches. And yet they have an itch
to get out there and perform.</LD>
<LD>   In growing numbers, these bookish men and women are improvising a
new fringe art form in New York's nightclubs, off-Broadway theaters
and performance spaces, one that toys with the cliches of literary
gatherings, shakes down writerly stereotypes and redefines what's
funny both onstage and in print.</LD>
<TE>   "Readings can be pretty dry affairs," says writer John Hodgman.
"It can feel like someone is reading a book report in seventh grade."
A former agent at Writer's House and a contributor to Men's Journal,
the New York Times Magazine and the Paris Review, Hodgman grew
impatient with standard-issue literary events and sought outlets that
could, as he puts it, generate "strange moments of sheer beauty that
cannot occur on the page."</TE>
<TE>   One of his first performance forays was at an event celebrating
the second issue of Dave Eggers' upstart McSweeney's magazine in
April 1999. The well-attended, irony-drenched gala--held at Jing
Fong, a cavernous Chinatown dim sum restaurant--featured Hodgman and
various cohorts reading his humor piece "Fire: The Next Sharp Stick?"
attired, like refugees from a 1950s Princeton revue, in caveman garb.
Hodgman was further inspired when one of his McSweeney's associates,
short-story writer Arthur Bradford, took to smashing guitars at his
readings. This, Hodgman argues, "was exactly what literature needed."</TE>
<TE>   Drawing participants from the McSweeney's pool of contributors,
Hodgman has gone on to curate an increasingly conspicuous reading and
performance series called the Little Grey Book Lectures. Inspired by
the early 20th century Little Blue Book pamphlets published by E.
Julius-Haldeman of Girard, Kan. (with such wide-ranging titles as
"How to Make All Kinds of Candy" and "The Soviet Constitution"),
Hodgman's lectures take place at the Brooklyn bar Galapagos and have
addressed such themes as "How to Begin an Important Project," "How to
Spell Several Common Words" and, in the wake of Sept. 11, "How We Can
Possibly Go On."</TE>
<TE>   As emcee, Hodgman sets the pseudo-reflective tone with his wry,
hangdog demeanor (he has the vaguely besieged aura of an Ivy League
professor uncertain of his tenure), while his guests--editors and
writers, cartoonists and actors--find amusing ways to jump beyond the
limits of the lectern.</TE>
<TE>   At the "Hints on Public Singing" evening, Elizabeth Gilbert
presented her GQ profile of Hank Williams III, concluding with an
"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry" sing-along. And when TimeOut New York
sports editor Brett Martin delivered a history of the "bouncing
ball," a demonstration was given, with the aid of projectors and the
lilting strains of "The Rainbow Connection."</TE>
<TE>   Commenting on the ubiquity of the lecture format among the current
crop of readers, performers and storytellers, Mike Albo offers a
curious observation: "I feel like graduate school is the new punk."
Albo, the author of "Hornito: My Lie Life," a novel about growing up
gay in suburbia, explains: "There's this group of people who are
sensitive about having gone to too much school, and so there's a
reaction to it--a sense of playfulness toward lectures and bouncing
away from it."</TE>
<TE>   As an undergrad at the University of Virginia in the early '90s,
Albo turned to performance as a way of blowing off steam. But it was
a later bout with academia--in the form of the prestigious Columbia
University MFA program in creative writing--that got Albo performing
in earnest around 1995. "I was workshopped out of my brain," Albo
says. "So when I started doing this, it was in reaction to the
workshoppy writing world."</TE>
<TE>   Albo's acclaimed performance, "Please Everything Burst," which he
took to London last summer, takes the form of rapid-fire monologues
that channel the hysterical patter running through our lives: the
breathless sloganeering of advertising, the confessional babblings of
our best friends and the mile-a-minute surge of answering-machine
messages.</TE>
<TE>   Several of Albo's monologues, which are often created in
collaboration with former Talk editor Virginia Heffernan, found their
way into "Hornito," proving that it's possible for a writer to
successfully mesh his stage work with work on the page. (Albo does
admit, however, that depicting an audience's ecstasy at a Wang Chung
concert is easier done in person.)</TE>
<TE>   The phenomenon is catching on in Los Angeles as well--though not
in quite the same numbers--particularly at Highways and the HBO
Workspace, where Albo has made appearances. Sandra Tsing-Loh is
perhaps the best known of the L.A. writers-turned-performers.
Acclaimed for her humorous insights and wit, the Valley resident is
the author of such works as "A Year in Van Nuys" and "Depth Takes a
Holiday."</TE>
<TE>   "She's evolved from an amusing woman that sat on a stool and told
stories into a real performer," says David Schweizer, a local theater
director who has worked with Loh. "She loves it."</TE>
<TE>   Bill Wasik, an assistant editor at Harper's magazine, would agree
that, at literary events, being funny saves the day. "Readings and
lectures can, as you know, be stultifyingly boring," he says. After
co-founding the underground humor review the Weekly Week in Boston,
Wasik moved to New York in 1999 when his piece "What Would Journey
Do?"--which found helpful living advice in the lyrics of Journey
songs--ran in Harper's.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Wasik has been turning up at various New York events,
including Hodgman's Little Grey Book Lectures, and at Block That
Kick, a Lower East Side cabaret series that he helped curate last
summer with the alternative comic Eugene Mirman, an old pal from the
Weekly Week. The pairing of the mild-mannered Wasik with the gonzo
Mirman gave the two an opportunity to skewer a New York audience's
expectations about high and low humor. A typical performance found
Wasik presenting his hilarious piece "The Bawdy Shakespeare," in
which he waxed professorial on various X-rated passages from the
Bard, nearly all of them invented.</TE>
<TE>   "Print comedy," Wasik contends, "is somewhat of a moribund
enterprise. Put a great piece of satire from the New Yorker up
against a great episode of 'Mr. Show'--it's just hard to compete with
the sheer comic power of the latter." Wasik says he's trying to
infuse literary gatherings with the same mad energy. As for Mirman,
he appreciates the influx of bookish types onto his turf. "A lot of
their stuff," he says, "is funnier than the stand-up shows."</TE>
<TE>   The staged storytelling evenings of writer Jonathan Ames also have
a certain telegenic appeal. The author of several books, including
the novels "The Extra Man" and "The Exhibitionist," and a former
columnist for the New York Press, Ames is, in some ways, the reigning
king of New York's performing writers. He has appeared at the
downtown music venue Fez more times than anyone except the Mingus Big
Band, the club's house act, and created a successful one-man show at
P.S. 122. (He's appeared in Los Angeles at Uncabaret, a performance
comedy series at the HBO Workspace.)</TE>
<TE>   Ames is an occasional boxer, and his ring exploits as "The Herring
Wonder" have been chronicled in the New York Times. Equal parts John
Updike and Andy Kaufman, Ames is known for asking his audience nosy
questions about their bedroom habits, dancing in a raincoat to Serge
Gainsbourg songs, appearing onstage with the inventor of a prosthetic
device called the Mangina, distributing mimeographs of his balding
pattern and, as he describes it, "shooting chakra life-spirit beams
into people out of my forehead."</TE>
<TE>   Performing now for 11 years, Ames was inspired by monologist
Spalding Gray and by a desire to "give people some joy, some
catharsis" in the context of a literary event. Ames found
straightforward readings overly structured, preferring to emulate "an
old-fashioned raconteur in front of the fireplace." Though his
outlandish stage presentations aren't exactly hearth-like, they are
startlingly intimate, soul-bearing affairs in which the buttoned-down
writer gets to go off the deep end. "I'm pretty quiet and isolated,"
Ames explains. "But then onstage I get to experience this
transformation of my personality. It's the hambone."</TE>
<TE>   Nell Casey is familiar with this phenomenon. "Writers, I thought,
were this shy breed that write because they don't do well in
structures or formats or with people. And then, suddenly, they're up
there with top hats and canes." Casey, an editor at Self magazine and
the daughter of novelist John Casey, is referring to the
transformation of writers--and firemen, lawyers and assorted everyday
people--that takes place at the Moth, New York's roving "urban
storytelling" evening. Casey serves as the Moth's general counsel and
has appeared on its stages, which have attracted the high-profile
likes of George Plimpton, Frank McCourt and Roy Blount Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Created in 1997 by poet and novelist George Dawes Green, the Moth
holds its themed evenings in venues ranging from velvet-roped
nightclubs to the Museum of Natural History. Each storyteller has 12
minutes to do his or her thing, at which point a violinist signals
the end. In connection with her 2001 anthology "Unholy Ghost: Writers
on Depression," Casey was host of a Moth event devoted to melancholy
that found Andrew Solomon, the author of "The Noonday Demon," telling
a sobering story about depression yet unable to resist the urge to
crack jokes and be a ham. The stage bug is contagious, Casey
suggests. "It's definitely shown me that if I had two lives, I'd try
to act in the other one."</TE>
<TE>   Casey says that preparing for the Moth is quite unlike writing one
of her essays and that, in fact, the experience can be utterly
terrifying. Some writers have flat-out refused to participate. The
movement toward jazzed-up readings, literary cabarets and
in-your-face monologues does leave some people cold.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all about being a stand-up comedian and getting tittering
laughter," says David Knowles, author of the novel "The Third Eye."
"I read a story that was vaguely satiric at one of these things, and
no one laughed once. I completely bombed. I hated it."</TE>
<TE>   But for other writers and editors, getting out from under a
manuscript and putting on a show is both challenging and liberating,
a way to bring the fresh air of improvisation to the staid literary
life.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just playing this whole thing by ear," Ames says, discussing
his newfound infatuation with Richard Pryor and his lead role in "The
Girl Under the Waves," a movie recently picked up by the Independent
Film Channel.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have any clear-cut ambitions with any of this. I'm just
winging it."</TE>

<HD>ABC Television President Quits</HD>
<DH>Media: Steven Bornstein resigns after less than a year as
the network struggles with weak ratings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEG JAMES and BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The revolving door at the Walt Disney Co.'s troubled ABC network
continues to turn, as the studio announced Tuesday that ABC
Television President Steven M. Bornstein is quitting after nearly a
year in that position.</LD>
<LD>   Disney executives announced the change in a brief statement and
declined to elaborate on the reasons or timing behind Bornstein's
exit. The company said only that Bornstein, 50, who spent most of the
last two decades helping mold ESPN into a cable TV sports powerhouse,
was leaving "to pursue other interests."</LD>
<LD>   Bornstein's responsibilities had included oversight of ABC's
television stations, the revamping of the cable channel ABC
Family--which Disney acquired and renamed last year--and the ABC TV
network. But ABC has struggled through a dismal season and is in
fourth place in prime-time ratings.</LD>
<TE>   The network's performance resulted in the ouster of ABC
Entertainment Television Group Co-Chairman Stu Bloomberg in January.</TE>
<TE>   Bornstein's resignation follows statements by Disney President
Robert Iger that he intends to become more involved in ABC's
operations.</TE>
<TE>   Iger, a former president of ABC who also has been head of the
network's entertainment division, told The Times last month that
neither he nor Disney Chairman Michael Eisner was sleeping well in
light of ABC's subpar results.</TE>
<TE>   Television industry sources and media analysts have long said that
ABC is top-heavy in management and that the responsibilities of
senior management are ill-defined.</TE>
<TE>   "Bornstein's role was really unclear," said Jordan Rohan, media
analyst with SoundView Technologies Group. Another analyst, David
Miller of Sanders Morris Harris in Los Angeles, said, "There are too
many people at the top of ABC."</TE>
<TE>   Bornstein's position will not immediately be filled.</TE>
<TE>   Some industry sources speculated that Carole Black, president of
Lifetime Television, a channel part-owned by Disney, might replace
him, but representatives for Disney and Black dismissed the idea.</TE>
<TE>   A network source said the ABC position probably would be
restructured. In the near term, Angela Shapiro, who was named
president of ABC Family in March, and ABC Television Network
President Alex Wallau will report directly to Iger.</TE>
<TE>   The shift comes at a critical time for the network. ABC executives
are busy selecting next season's pilots in an attempt to reverse a
20% slide in audience in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   In two weeks, ABC and the other networks will present their fall
lineups to advertisers in New York and begin selling the bulk of
their commercial time in what is known as the "advertising
up-fronts."</TE>
<TE>   Sources said Iger and Bornstein sometimes clashed, but sources
close to Bornstein rejected the notion, saying the two men worked
well together for more than a decade. One source said Bornstein's
departure was "a mutual decision" that had been in the works for
several months.</TE>
<TE>   Bornstein "played key roles in the enormous success of ESPN and
the successful launch of the ABC Family Channel," Iger said in a
statement. "We appreciate all that he had done for ESPN, ABC Family
and ABC and wish him well."</TE>
<TE>   Neither Iger nor Bornstein would comment beyond the statement.</TE>
<TE>   Bornstein Called 'a Great Salesman'</TE>
<TE>   Industry insiders described Bornstein as a capable and decisive
manager. "He was a great salesman for ABC and ESPN," Rohan said.</TE>
<TE>   However, some said Bornstein had the nearly impossible task of
working magic at some of Disney's most problematic divisions,
including running ABC and Disney's Go.com, the Internet site that
Disney shut down a year ago after it lost nearly $1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   A Disney source said Bornstein waited to leave until after
overseeing the launch of ABC Family cable channel and installing
Susan Lyne as president of ABC Entertainment after Bloomberg's
departure and Shapiro as head of ABC Family. Disney bought the ABC
Family Channel last year from News Corp. for $5.2 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Bornstein's tenure as network chairman was hobbled by the
advertising recession, which saw overall spending in network
advertising decline sharply and Wall Street pressuring Disney to
boost its sagging stock price.</TE>
<TE>   Disney shares closed Tuesday at $23.18 a share, up 16 cents, on
the New York Stock Exchange. In the last year, Disney's stock has
fallen 23% in value.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a rotten, tough year," said Alan Bell, president of
Irvine-based Freedom Broadcasting Inc., which owns three
ABC-affiliated stations.</TE>
<TE>   The combination of an advertising recession, decline in audience
levels and stock price slump has created considerable turbulence for
the network, Bell said, calling it "the ingredients for a perfect
storm. Boats get capsized and executives are swept out to sea."</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Bornstein said: "I have had the good fortune of
having some very challenging and rewarding positions with ESPN, ABC
and the Walt Disney Co. There are other interests I wish to pursue
and now is an appropriate time to do this."</TE>

<HD>Andersen Near Deal on Consulting Unit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS S. MULLIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Struggling accounting firm Arthur Andersen is "nearing a tentative
deal" to sell its consulting business to KPMG Consulting Inc.,
according to a person familiar with the negotiations.</LD>
<LD>   An agreement could be announced this week, but Andersen's legal
and financial problems would make closing any deal tricky and
time-consuming, the source said.</LD>
<LD>   Andersen is under federal indictment for alleged obstruction of
justice for destroying documents in connection with the collapse of
former audit client Enron Corp.</LD>
<TE>   Trial is scheduled to begin Monday in U.S. District Court in
Enron's hometown of Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen has announced its intention to return to its roots as a
corporate auditing specialist by selling its management consulting
and tax consulting businesses.</TE>
<TE>   However, Andersen's ability to conduct an orderly transformation
is in doubt.</TE>
<TE>   It has tried unsuccessfully to settle both its criminal case and a
massive lawsuit filed by Enron shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   A number of overseas affiliates already have cut their ties to
Chicago-based Andersen, puncturing holes in the firm's global
network.</TE>
<TE>   Many corporate audit clients also have fled for other firms,
crimping Andersen's revenue and increasing the chance it may have to
file for bankruptcy protection, experts have said.</TE>
<TE>   A purchase of Andersen's multi-national consulting business would
fit with KPMG Consulting's goal to expand internationally.</TE>
<TE>   The McLean, Va.-based firm was spun off from the Big Five
accounting firm KPMG in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   KPMG Consulting's shares rose $1.41 to $17.50 on Nasdaq on
Tuesday, a day when rival consulting firms also gained ground.</TE>
<TE>   Randolph C. Blazer, the company's president and chief executive,
declined to comment on a possible deal with Andersen during a
conference call to discuss quarterly earnings with analysts.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen also declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Also Tuesday, a House committee investigating the Enron affair
refused to give Andersen documents related to interviews of
Andersen's chief Enron auditor.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Johnson, a spokesman for the chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce Committee, Rep. Billy Tauzin (R-La.), said the "information
clearly is protected by the Constitution's speech and debate clause."</TE>

<HD>Fluor Profit More Than Triples as Sales of Construction
Services Rise</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Dow Jones News Service</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fluor Corp.'s first-quarter profit more than tripled as the largest
publicly traded engineering and construction company said revenue
rose 31%.</LD>
<LD>   Net income rose to $41.2 million, or 51 cents a share, from $11.2
million, or 14 cents, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $2.51 billion
from $1.91 billion, Fluor said.</LD>
<LD>   Aliso Viejo-based Fluor sold more construction services to build
power plants, pipelines and offshore oil platforms, a spokeswoman
said. She didn't know which customers contributed the most to revenue
and profit.</LD>
<TE>   Profit, excluding stock-based compensation, rose to $36.2 million,
or 45 cents a share, from $32.7 million, or 43 cents, a year earlier,
the company said.</TE>
<TE>   On that basis, which isn't in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, Fluor was expected to have profit of 42 cents,
the average estimate of four analysts polled by Thomson
Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Fluor said second-quarter profit would be about 50 cents a share
and 2002 profit would be about $2.10 a share.</TE>
<TE>   Fluor shares rose 89 cents to $41.33 on the New York Stock
Exchange. They have risen 11% this year.</TE>
<TE>   Other earnings from California companies, excluding one-time
items:</TE>
<TE>   * Capstone Turbine Corp. reported a net loss of $12 million, or 16
cents a share, compared with a loss of $9.4 million, or 12 cents, a
year ago. The Chatsworth-based energy company said revenue was $4.6
million, down from $8.9 million a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   * Hall, Kinion &amp; Associates reported a net loss of $2.4 million,
or 19 cents a share, compared with a loss of $26.4 million, or $2 a
share, a year ago. The San Jose-based personnel provider said revenue
fell to $24.5 million, compared with $60.9 million a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   * Hines Horticulture Inc. reported net income of $2 million, or 9
cents a share, compared with a net loss of $900,000, or 4 cents, last
year. The Irvine-based commercial nursery reported sales of $68.7
million, up from $67.7 million a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   * McKesson Corp. reported net income of $125.4 million, or 42
cents a share, contrasted with a net loss of $175.5 million, or 62
cents a share, a year earlier. The San Francisco drug distributor
said revenue grew 14% to $13 billion, from $11.4 billion a year
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   * Provena Foods Inc. reported net income of $55,706, or 2 cents a

<HD>Discovery Amends Shift in On-Screen Credits Policy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Faced with criticism from television's production community,
Discovery Networks U.S. has compromised on a proposed policy shift
that would have virtually eliminated on-screen credits from its
programs.</LD>
<LD>   The channel has maintained that dropping credits would improve
audience flow from one program to the next and generate higher
ratings.</LD>
<LD>   Discovery announced Tuesday that it will let producers decide
whether to continue to run credits as usual or adopt an alternative
arrangement.</LD>
<TE>   Under the amended system, a few credits would be featured at the
outset of shows, a five-second card identifying the production
company logo would run at the end and viewers would be directed to a
Web site where they could access complete credits.</TE>
<TE>   Some in Hollywood had reacted angrily to the Bethesda, Md.-based
company's "credit initiative," which was outlined during a series of
meetings with producers in recent months. Beyond concern that
limiting credits would deprive them of recognition for their work on
Discovery's networks, which include Discovery, the Travel Channel and
Animal Planet, producers feared the practice would spread.</TE>
<TE>   Although Discovery stated that several producers supported the
concept, the International Documentary Assn. assembled a coalition
saying it was offended by the proposal, which also was criticized by
the Writers Guild of America. The Academy of Television Arts and
Sciences board passed its own resolution pointing out that credits
are "currency" in the TV business.</TE>
<TE>   John Ford, president of the content group for Discovery Networks
U.S., said Discovery was still committed to exploring means of
providing better audience retention from program to program, having
previously stated that credits invite viewers to "channel-surf."</TE>
<TE>   Producers appeared to welcome the compromise. Most producers were
reluctant to openly criticize Discovery because its channels are
major buyers of documentary fare.</TE>

<HD>Consumer Confidence Drops in April</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. consumer confidence fell during April as higher energy prices
and a declining stock market tempered optimism about economic growth.</LD>
<LD>   The Conference Board's gauge of sentiment dropped to 108.8 last
month from 110.7 in March. April's index fell less than expected,
while a report from Chicago purchasing executives suggested a
manufacturing recovery has taken root.</LD>
<LD>   "The fundamentals in the economy appear to be very sound and set
the stage for continued expansion," said Richard Clarida, assistant
Treasury secretary for economic policy.</LD>
<TE>   Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of gross domestic
product, and the confidence survey showed more people plan to buy
appliances, autos and houses in the next six months than did in
March.</TE>
<TE>   Manufacturing in the Chicago region grew in April for a third
straight month, according to a survey by the National Assn. of
Purchasing Management--Chicago. Although the group's factory index
fell to 54.7 from 55.7, any reading above 50 indicates expansion.</TE>
<TE>   Recovery may be leading to higher prices for some materials. The
index of prices paid for raw materials rose to 55.4, the highest in a
year, from 51.2.</TE>
<TE>   The regional report supports economists' expectations that a
survey today will show that manufacturing expanded nationwide in
April for a third month.</TE>
<TE>   In a third report, U.S. corporate profits fell 6.3% in the first
quarter. Sales fell 4.7%, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.
The results, based on 390 of the S&amp;P 500 index companies that
reported results as of Monday, suggest a resurgent economy may not
give much boost to corporate earnings.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Johnnie Cochran Jr.'s law firm faces a suit by musician George
Clinton, who claims the firm's malpractice caused him to lose the
copyright to his music.</LD>
<LD>   Clinton, leader of the Funkadelic/Parliament ensemble, hired the
Cochran firm in 1997 to represent him in a dispute with Bridgeport
Music Inc. The Detroit-based publishing company says it owns
Clinton's catalog of music.</LD>
<LD>   Clinton's suit contends that one of Cochran's employees, Donald
Wilson Jr., didn't competently represent him by failing to
effectively cross-examine witnesses and file an appeal on time, among
other things. The suit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, seeks
unspecified damages.</LD>
<TE>   A call to Cochran's firm wasn't immediately returned.</TE>
<TE>   Clinton's songs, including "One Nation Under a Groove" and "Freak
of the Week," are popular sampling sources for rap artists.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cox Radio Inc., the third-largest U.S. radio company, had a wider
first-quarter loss because of acquisition-related costs.</LD>
<LD>   The loss widened to $6.61 million, or 7 cents a share, from
$2.14million, or 2 cents, a year earlier. Second-quarter profit is
forecast to be 15 cents, below the 16-cent average estimate of nine
analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call.</LD>
<LD>   Cox said it had $13.9 million in costs in the first quarter to
write down the value of acquisitions.</LD>
<TE>   First-quarter sales fell less than 1% to $86 million from $86.5
million as companies spent less to advertise on Cox's radio stations.
The Atlanta-based company said it expects second-quarter sales of
$110million. Cox earned 6 cents a share on sales of $107.9 million in
the year-earlier period.</TE>
<TE>   Cox shares rose $1.78 to close at $28.64 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   The company owns, operates or provides sales and marketing
services for 79 stations in 18 markets, including Atlanta, Houston,
Miami and San Antonio.</TE>

<HD>GM Ends 0% Loan Program</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>General Motors Corp. on Tuesday unveiled new sales incentives for its
2002 model year cars and trucks, eliminating the no-interest loans it
began offering last fall and increasing cash rebates on several
vehicles by $1,000.</LD>
<LD>   GM's new "1-2-3" program offers $1,000, $2,000 or $3,000 cash
rebates or financing rates of 1.9%, 2.9% or 3.9% on 24-, 36- and
48-month loans toward the purchase of a new 2002 model year car or
truck.</LD>
<LD>   All Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, Oldsmobile, Pontiac and GMC cars
and trucks are included in the program, which runs through July 1.
GM's Saturn, Saab, Hummer and all 2003 model year vehicles are
excluded from the program.</LD>
<TE>   GM, the world's No. 1 auto maker, previously had offered cash
rebates of $2,002 or financing rates of zero percent, 2.9% or 3.9% on
most of its 2002 model year vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   The move puts additional pressure on Ford Motor Co. and
DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler operations as they try to return to
profitability this year.</TE>
<TE>   "We have always been competitive and we intend to continue to do
so," Ford spokeswoman Susan Krusel said, when asked whether the No. 2
auto maker will match GM's new incentives.</TE>
<TE>   Ford's current U.S. incentives, including interest-free financing
and as much as $2,500 cash back, run through today.</TE>
<TE>   Sales incentives on new cars and trucks have diminished since the
levels they reached in the fourth quarter after the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, but they remain historically high.</TE>
<TE>   Under its "1-2-3" program, GM will offer $1,000 back on the
Cadillac DeVille, Cadillac Escalade and Chevrolet Corvette, which had
no cash incentives under its previous program.</TE>
<TE>   Buyers will get $3,000 cash back on many other models, including
the Pontiac Bonneville, Pontiac Sunfire, Chevrolet Cavalier and GM
minivans.</TE>

<HD>Prices of New Southland Homes Rise in 1st Quarter</HD>
<DH>Real estate: Report shows strong demand for larger and
costlier housing even as prices continue to climb.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL STRICKLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Prices of new homes rose sharply across the Southland during the
first quarter, reflecting consumers' willingness to buy property even
though costs are rising significantly.</LD>
<LD>   Median prices ranged from $239,990, or 8.6% higher from a year
ago, in Riverside County, to $437,990, a 30.7% increase, in Ventura
County, according to the quarterly report released Tuesday by Meyers
Group, a real estate research firm in Irvine.</LD>
<LD>   Consumers demonstrated growing confidence in the economy by
purchasing larger and and more expensive homes, said Jeff Meyers, the
group's president. Builders were able to raise prices because the
number of interested buyers far outpaced the amount of new units
available.</LD>
<TE>   "You have strong demand," Meyers said, "and not much variety in
the marketplace right now. It's exceptionally tight."</TE>
<TE>   Median prices--meaning half cost less and half cost more--for new
single-family homes, townhomes and condominiums rose during the
quarter in San Diego to $385,990 or 18.8%; in Orange County to
$470,990 or 18.3%; in Los Angeles County to $327,990 or 11.6%; and in
San Bernardino County to $247,900 or 10.2%.</TE>
<TE>   The supply of new housing, which hovers near record lows, will
expand slightly as more properties are completed this year.</TE>
<TE>   Meyers said greater availability will lead to a double-digit
increase in sales, especially if price hikes slow down.</TE>
<TE>   Home builders may have less room to raise prices because of
already steep increases. And home buying may be dampened if mortgage
rates edge higher as many analysts expect.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers could see prices rise at a slower pace for the rest of
the year. Meyers projects an annual rate of growth of about 5%.
"Prices will continue to go up," he said, "but not as quickly as the
first quarter."</TE>

<HD>Judge Sides With HP on Compaq Deal</HD>
<DH>Courts: Ruling that firm did not coerce investors clears
way for close of deal if vote is confirmed. Walter Hewlett says he
won't appeal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES PILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hewlett-Packard Co. scored a major victory in its seven-month
struggle to acquire Compaq Computer Corp. on Tuesday when a judge
ruled that HP did not mislead shareholders or engage in vote buying
to win support.</LD>
<LD>   HP's win was sweetened late Tuesday when Walter Hewlett, who
challenged the shareholder vote in Delaware's Chancery Court, said he
won't appeal the ruling and would drop his challenge of the
shareholder vote count.</LD>
<LD>   "After reviewing the court's opinion, we have decided not to
appeal the decision," Hewlett, son of HP co-founder William Hewlett,
said in a statement. "I will ... now do everything possible to
support the successful implementation of HP's acquisition of Compaq
and encourage others who have shared my views in the past several
months to do the same."</LD>
<TE>   The court ruling and Hewlett's capitulation clear the way for the
largest high-tech merger in history to close May 7 if the narrow
margin of victory to approve the plan is confirmed as expected. HP
still faces probes about the shareholder vote from the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the U.S. attorney's office in
Manhattan--although experts said the investigations won't prevent the
merger from being consummated.</TE>
<TE>   Hewlett's case still may have a lasting effect on corporate
officers.</TE>
<TE>   "We're talking about the integrity of the voting process and the
role of the dissident director," said Charles Elson, director of the
Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. "How
carefully will the shareholders be listened to? Very carefully in the
post-Enron [Corp.] era."</TE>
<TE>   Hewlett had argued that HP's top managers lied to shareholders
about the likelihood that the $18.5-billion merger would create an
efficient tech powerhouse. His legal team introduced a litany of
internal reports that painted a bleak picture of the company's
planning process and projections.</TE>
<TE>   Carly Fiorina, HP's chief executive, countered in court that the
reports were misleading "snapshots." She held to predictions that the
merger would meet or exceed optimistic revenue and profit projections
touted to shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   Judge William Chandler, who presided over the three-day trial last
week, sided firmly with HP. "The public statements made by HP
management about the progress of the integration process ... were
supported by the facts when they were made and were neither false nor
misleading," he wrote in his ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Hewlett also had accused HP of coercing institutional
shareholders, notably Deutsche Bank, with implied threats and the
promise of new business. Chandler also rejected that claim. "No one
from HP used threats or inducements regarding future business
relationships" in a conference call with Deutsche Bank to discuss the
proxy vote, the judge wrote.</TE>
<TE>   HP issued a statement saying it "is gratified by the ruling."</TE>
<TE>   Any relief felt by HP's managers after the bitter and costly
battle may soon dissipate amid the formidable challenge of
integrating divergent corporate cultures, slashing jobs and making
good on ambitious promises to shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   "No large-scale high-tech merger has ever worked. Everyone will be
looking at the Hewlett-Packard-Compaq merger to see if that
generalization can be proven wrong," said David Yoffie, a Harvard
University business professor.</TE>
<TE>   Surveys have shown that many employees disagree with the deal.
They will be needed to execute an ambitious integration strategy that
observers--and as noted in memos released in court, some HP
managers--consider unrealistic.</TE>
<TE>   The merger takes place amid a slumping PC market. PC leader Dell
Computer Corp. announced plans Tuesday to attack Hewlett-Packard's PC
business as the company struggles to digest Compaq. Meanwhile,
information technology spending will remain flat for the rest of the
year, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   In the short run, HP will face massive cost-cutting to improve its
competitive posture. The company has announced plans to cut as many
as 15,000 employees.</TE>
<TE>   Given the problems of integrating the new firm in a down economy,
HP's sheer size might slow down its creative process.</TE>
<TE>   Historically, HP competed by being the first to market with
innovations, but in today's fast-moving tech industry "prospecting is
done primarily by the smaller start-ups," said Raymond Miles, an
emeritus business professor at UC Berkeley. "Becoming a far bigger,
and inevitably a far more bureaucratic, organization was really the
only strategy that was available to HP."</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Palo Alto-based HP rose 13 cents to $17.10 before
release of the judge's decision, then eased to $17 in after-hours
trading. Shares of Houston-based Compaq fell 15 cents to $10.15, then
rose to $10.56 after-hours. Both trade on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Immunex Settles Suits on Amgen Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Immunex Corp. settled three lawsuits filed by investors who opposed
Amgen Inc.'s planned $15-billion acquisition of the maker of
rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel.</LD>
<LD>   Immunex and Amgen, the world's biggest biotechnology company,
agreed to reduce the termination fee that could be paid by either
company by $20 million to $455 million if the deal doesn't go
through. The companies also agreed to disclose additional information
to satisfy shareholder concerns about the purchase.</LD>
<LD>   "It eliminates the burden of litigation and finally puts the suits
behind us," said Josh Schroeter, a spokesman at Seattle-based
Immunex.</LD>
<TE>   The companies also said some Immunex executives have elected to
take a severance package in connection with the purchase.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement is subject to court approval. Shareholders of both
companies are scheduled to meet and vote on the deal May 16.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Thousand Oaks-based Amgen closed at $52.80, up $1, and
Immunex rose 48 cents to $27.14, both on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Amgen said in December that it would pay 0.44 of a share and $4.50
in cash for each Immunex share to gain Enbrel, which some analysts
say could top $2 billion in sales this year.</TE>
<TE>   Immunex shareholders sued in January, saying company directors
backed the deal because they will get new jobs with Amgen.</TE>

<HD>Minorities More Likely to Receive Sub-Prime Loans</HD>
<DH>Lending: A new study finds people of color in U.S. cities
often pay higher fees to refinance their homes than whites.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When legislation to rein in mortgage refinancing scams is introduced
in the Senate today, the supporting evidence will include an advocacy
group's study showing minorities in every U.S. metropolitan area are
more likely than whites to shoulder higher fees and interest rates
when refinancing their homes.</LD>
<LD>   The Center for Community Change report on sub-prime loans--those
in which lenders charge higher-risk borrowers additional fees and
higher interest rates--found that in many areas, upper-income
minority borrowers are more likely to wind up with sub-prime loans
than lower-income white borrowers.</LD>
<LD>   African Americans in the San Francisco area who earn more than
120% of the local median income are 2.34 times more likely to
refinance their homes with sub-prime loans than lower-income whites,
the highest such ratio in the country, the study found. San Diego was
No. 3 with a 1.64 ratio.</LD>
<TE>   The six metropolitan areas with the greatest gap between
upper-income Latinos and lower-income whites are all in California,
topped by Salinas, where upper-income Latino homeowners are 2.21
times more likely to receive sub-prime refinance loans than whites,
the study said. Santa Barbara County was No. 2 with a disparity ratio
of 2.03, followed by San Francisco, San Jose, Vallejo-Fairfield-Napa
and San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   In Fresno, 48.2% of all refinance loans made to black borrowers
are sub-prime--the highest percentage in the state--compared with
18.5% for whites. That's still well below some areas of the country,
especially in Texas and the South. In Fort Smith, Ark., 64.5% of all
refinance loans made to African Americans are sub-prime, compared
with 16.4% of loans made to whites.</TE>
<TE>   Fresno also had the highest concentration of sub-prime refinance
loans among Latino borrowers in the state at 44%, the study found.</TE>
<TE>   Previous studies have shown that many sub-prime borrowers have
credit records good enough to get loans on better terms--if they
applied for them. But reports on racial disparities have been
challenged by lenders because they, like the latest study, are based
on federal data that don't clearly show to what extent risk rather
than race is the determining factor in the loans. The report uses
2000 data on mortgage refinancings collected under the Federal Home
Mortgage Disclosure Act.</TE>
<TE>   "We're applying the only data out there," said Jesse Jacobs, an
aide to Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.), who chairs the Senate Banking
Committee and who will introduce legislation today to restrict
"predatory" lending practices.</TE>
<TE>   Allen J. Fishbein, director of the new study, said the data
collected under the Federal Home Mortgage Disclosure Act are "not
perfect but are reasonably accurate."</TE>

<LD>Macy's West department stores said Tuesday that its leader of two
years, Chairman and Chief Executive Jeremiah J. Sullivan, 63, will
retire and be replaced by the company's second in command.</LD>
<LD>   Robert L. Mettler, 61, the company's president and chief operating
officer, will take over June 1 at Macy's West, a division of
Federated Department Stores Inc. that manages Macy's stores in the
Western U.S.</LD>
<LD>   Sullivan, a 41-year veteran of the department store industry, took
his first job with Federated 22 years ago as vice president for
finance at San Francisco's I. Magnin stores, a former Federated

Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. before replacing Sullivan as Macy's West
president in January 2000, when Sullivan took over the top job.</TE>

<HD>Dow Up but Still Below 10,000</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: S&amp;P breaks losing streak as investors search for
bargains, even though consumer confidence falls.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wall Street emerged at least temporarily from its slump Tuesday as
bargain hunting lifted stocks despite another set of lackluster
earnings and a dip in consumer confidence.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts cautioned against too much enthusiasm about the advance,
however, noting that the market's pattern has been to rally and then
pull back when investors' expectations fail to mesh with reality.
Indeed, although stocks ended the day higher, the gains faded late in
the session.</LD>
<LD>   "You're really just getting a snapback today," said Duncan
Richardson, chief equity investment officer at Eaton Vance. "The
stocks that were down the most last week are up the most today. But I
don't think there's been any broader change."</LD>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 126.35 points, or 1.3%,
at 9,946.22, after rising as much as 186 points earlier in the
session.</TE>
<TE>   It was the Dow's first triple-digit gain in two weeks but failed
to propel the average back above 10,000. This is the third-straight
session the blue chips have spent below the psychologically important
level.</TE>
<TE>   Broader stock indicators also moved higher. The technology-focused
Nasdaq composite index gained 31.30 points, or 1.9%, at 1,688.23,
while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index climbed 11.47 points, or 1.1%,
to 1,076.92, snapping a six-day losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   The gain brought the S&amp;P 500's loss for April to about 6%, the
benchmark gauge's worst monthly performance since September. The Dow
fell 4.4% for the month, and Nasdaq sank 8.5%.</TE>
<TE>   Although earnings Tuesday weren't any more or less spectacular
than others released previously, Wall Street was more willing to set
aside some of its qualms--at least for the moment. Analysts said
stock prices, which have fallen to 52-week lows and even new lows in
some cases, were drawing investors to the market.</TE>
<TE>   Cyclical, or economically sensitive stocks, helped buoy the Dow.
International Paper rallied $2.28 to $41.43. United Technologies,
whose products range from military aircraft to elevators, jumped
$2.27 to $70.17. And Caterpillar, the world's largest construction
equipment maker, rose $1.73 to $54.62.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Wall Street's enthusiasm was selective. Eli Lilly tumbled
$2.25 to $66.05 after the drug company backed its second-quarter
forecast but lowered its outlook for 2002 and 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, winners led losers by 2 to 1 on the New York Stock
Exchange and by 3 to 2 on Nasdaq. Trading was active.</TE>
<TE>   The day's economic news was unremarkable. The Conference Board
said its consumer confidence index fell in April compared with March,
but the drop was expected. The survey is closely watched because
consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the economy.</TE>
<TE>   Another report showed manufacturing in the Chicago area grew in
April for the third straight month.</TE>
<TE>   In other trading, the dollar firmed against the euro and yen,
although it still fell 3.2% against both currencies in April. Yields
on Treasury securities dipped, oil fell and gold came off its recent
two-year highs, falling $2.30 to $308.90 an ounce.</TE>
<TE>   In other market news:</TE>
<TE>   * Retail stocks lagged on the drop in consumer confidence and a
report that retail sales fell last week. Wal-Mart lost 34 cents to
$55.86, while Home Depot fell 59 cents to $46.37.</TE>
<TE>   * Financial stocks surged, including Dow member J.P. Morgan, which
rose 76 cents to $35.10. Bank of America gained $1.21 to $72.48 and
FleetBoston added $1.05 to $35.30.</TE>
<TE>   * Marquee technology names rose after days of declines. Cisco
Systems rose 52 cents to $14.65 and Intel rose 57 cents to $28.61.</TE>
<TE>   * Tyco International rose $1.45 to $18.45 and was the most active
on the Big Board. The conglomerate said it doesn't have liquidity
problems because proceeds from its planned initial public stock
offering of CIT Group will enable it to refinance $3.2 billion in
debt.</TE>

<HD>Hynix Rejects $2.8-Billion Acquisition Bid by Micron</HD>
<DH>Computers: CEO quits after move by S. Korean chip maker's
board. Experts forecast tough times for firm, industry.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A bid by Micron Technology Inc. to become the world's largest
computer memory maker fell apart Tuesday as the board of struggling
Hynix Semiconductor Inc. rejected the $2.8-billion deal.</LD>
<LD>   Hynix Chief Executive Park Chong Sup, who negotiated the merger 11
days earlier, resigned in protest, and analysts predicted tough times
for the company, with $6 billion in debt and an annual loss of nearly
$4 billion.</LD>
<LD>   The deal would have further consolidated an industry slammed by
ruthless price wars and tepid demand from computer manufacturers,
factors that shrank the global memory chip market from $29 billion in
2000 to $10 billion last year.</LD>
<TE>   Micron's acquisition was backed by creditors but opposed by Hynix
employees who feared getting fired and by small shareholders unlikely
to recover their losses.</TE>
<TE>   Facing that pressure, Hynix directors said the South Korean
company would rather remain independent and wait for a rise in memory
prices.</TE>
<TE>   But news of the failed deal sent memory chip wholesale prices down
10 cents on average in Asia to less than $3 for a standard
128-megabyte chip.</TE>
<TE>   Buyers had expected a merger to reduce chip supply and lift
prices. The spot price for the 128-MB chip rose from a low of $1 in
November to $5 in March before falling back to about $3 in recent
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said Hynix will have a tough time regaining its footing.</TE>
<TE>   "They're fairly crippled from a financial perspective," said Dan
Scovel, a semiconductor analyst for Needham &amp; Co. in New York.
"Unless there's a huge capital infusion on the order of several
billions of dollars, it seems unlikely that they would remain viable
for longer than a year."</TE>
<TE>   Scovel said Hynix's continued presence, however brief, bodes ill
for the overall industry.</TE>
<TE>   "Now you have a crippled supplier frantic to raise money any way
it can, and that's likely to mean slashing prices below cost," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Micron declined to divulge its next move.</TE>
<TE>   "It's disappointing that the Hynix board of directors and their
creditors couldn't come to an agreement," Micron spokesman Sean
Mahoney said. "We're evaluating the situation to determine an
appropriate course of action."</TE>
<TE>   A sale still may be possible, analysts said. Creditors, most of
whom back the deal, collectively hold $2.3 billion in bonds that can
be converted to stock and can theoretically wrest control from the
board and approve a sale.</TE>
<TE>   The deal called for Micron to pay $200 million in cash plus 108
million shares of its stock, worth $2.6billion based on Tuesday's
share price, for six factories and a 15% stake in Hynix's remaining
chip business.</TE>
<TE>   "Generally speaking, they don't want to sell out unless they have
to," said Jeremy Lopez, an analyst with Morningstar Inc. in Chicago.
"But with memory prices starting to tick up again, they may be
thinking that they don't need to throw in the towel."</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Micron fell $2.75 to $23.70 Tuesday on the New York
Stock Exchange. Hynix stock rose 6% on the Korean Stock Exchange.</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>COPENHAGEN</DL>
<LD>COPENHAGEN -- Navision, one of Europe's leading manufacturers of
software that helps medium-size businesses run their operations and
finances, confirmed Tuesday that it was in discussions to be
acquired, after reports that Microsoft Corp. was set to pay $1.2
billion for the Danish enterprise software firm.</LD>
<LD>   But Navision officials declined to identify their suitor.
Microsoft officials also declined to comment. The Financial Times
reported Tuesday that discussions were in their final stages and an
announcement was expected next week.</LD>
<LD>   Navision shares soared by as much as 24% in Denmark. Analysts said
the deal would make sense for Navision as competition heats up with
software rivals such as Germany's SAP and Oracle Corp., which are
going for the mid-size business market in which Navision operates.</LD>
<TE>   The Microsoft brand name, its global marketing power and its
financial strength would give Navision an edge over rivals.</TE>
<TE>   "It also seems to be the right way for Microsoft to enter the
European market," Jyske Bank analyst Robert Jacobsen said.</TE>
<TE>   Navision, which is 56% owned by its five founders, already is a
key partner for Microsoft. By combining Navision with its recently
acquired enterprise software unit Great Plains, Microsoft would
become one of the world's leading providers of business planning
software to mid-size companies.</TE>
<TE>   It is a high-growth market into which Microsoft wants to expand.
Industry sources said Microsoft has been working on the acquisition
for 12 months.</TE>

<HD>Nations Talk Free Trade, but Protectionism Rises</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WARREN VIETH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The United States and other big countries still are promoting the
virtues of free trade, but they are moving to protect vulnerable
industries at a pace that undermines their rhetoric.</LD>
<LD>   The downturn in the global economy and the collapse of prices of
many commodities are contributing to a notable increase in
protectionist actions--and retaliatory responses--by governments
around the world. Setting the tone, some analysts assert, is the
U.S., traditionally the bandleader for trade expansion.</LD>
<LD>   "The more the big economies like the United States and the
European Union appear protectionist, the more developing countries
feel justified in doing the same thing," said Cliff Stevenson, chief
economist with Mayer, Brown, Rowe &amp; Maw, a global law firm based in
London. "The danger is there will be a domino effect."</LD>
<TE>   When President Bush meets with European leaders Thursday, he will
try to head off a trade war over his 30% steel tariffs. Foreign
leaders already are spoiling for a fight over $50 billion in U.S.
farm subsidies taking shape on Capitol Hill. Some members of Congress
want to attach new protective measures to "fast-track" trade
legislation making its way through the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   But the U.S. has plenty of company. From Brazil to India,
governments are responding to growing pressure to come to the aid of
industries that wind up on the losing end of trade liberalization.
Increasingly, they are seeking relief under "anti-dumping" rules that
prohibit predatory pricing by exporters and "safeguard" provisions
that give hard-hit domestic producers a timeout from global
competition.</TE>
<TE>   According to an analysis by Stevenson's law firm, protectionist
activity reached "unprecedented levels" last year, with 24 countries
initiating a record 348 anti-dumping investigations, 53 safeguard
actions and 27 anti-subsidy inquiries.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. and India were the most aggressive users of anti-dumping
rules, which allow a country to impose punitive tariffs if foreign
companies flood its markets with goods priced at less than the cost
of production.</TE>
<TE>   Washington launched 79 anti-dumping investigations last year, and
New Delhi 75. Other anti-dumping "superpowers" were the European
Community, Argentina, Canada, Australia and Brazil, the study said.</TE>
<TE>   "The American disease of overusing and abusing anti-dumping cases
has been caught by many other countries," said Sherman Katz, a global
business scholar at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not willing to stand there empty-handed when they're
being clobbered in the United States," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to anti-dumping measures that target individual
countries, there is increasing use of across-the-board remedies such
as the 30% tariffs imposed by Bush on some categories of imported
steel. Chile and India also have been frequent users of these broader
forms of protection.</TE>
<TE>   The flurry of activity does not necessarily signal a broad retreat
from globalism. For every ounce of protectionism, economists say,
there is still a pound of trade expansion taking place as countries
honor their commitments to lower tariffs and remove quotas in
accordance with previous trade agreements.</TE>
<TE>   With 144 countries now participating in the World Trade
Organization, it is only natural that many of them will begin to use
anti-dumping and safeguard rules to address perceived injustices.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Tom Donahue likened the WTO to
a rapidly expanding country club: "Now that everybody has joined,
they're going to see if they can get tee time," he said. But the
challenges are occurring against the backdrop of growing acceptance
of the benefits of global commerce.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel we are opening up trade far more than we ever have,"
Donahue said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some analysts are troubled, particularly by the increasing
tendency of the U.S. and the European Community to engage in
tit-for-tat retaliation.</TE>
<TE>   Europe has threatened to slap punitive duties on U.S.-made
motorcycles, orange juice and other goods in response to Bush's steel
sanctions. If it does so before the WTO rules on the steel measures,
the U.S. has hinted that it will respond with retaliatory actions of
its own.</TE>
<TE>   Harvard University trade economist Robert Lawrence said the
punitive tariffs Europe says it is entitled to levy in the steel case
and a separate tax subsidy dispute exceed the benefits derived from
Europe's concessions in the last big round of global trade
liberalization.</TE>
<TE>   "We're talking about tariff increases that could more than offset
the gains we achieved in the eight-year negotiation that brought us
the Uruguay Round agreement," Lawrence said. "These are big numbers."</TE>
<TE>   Some economists are even more offended by the huge subsidies that
Congress is preparing to bestow on U.S. farmers. The price supports
tend to promote overproduction, driving down world commodity prices
and preventing many developing countries from expanding their
agricultural exports.</TE>
<TE>   The big farm bill nearing final passage in Congress appears to
conflict with commitments made by the U.S. to reduce subsidies and
open its markets in the round of trade liberalization talks launched
last year at Doha, Qatar. And it comes as the United States continues
its long-running campaign for cutbacks in farm subsidies in countries
such as Japan and France.</TE>
<TE>   "If the current legislation goes through, it's going to greatly
complicate our ability to complete a Doha round," said Jeffrey
Schott, an economist at the Institute for International Economics.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a hundred times more important than any of these other
things."</TE>

<HD>More Bad News Delivered by Qwest</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE FREY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Qwest Communications International Inc. added to the
telecommunication industry's mounting woes Tuesday when it reported a
first-quarter loss of $698 million, more than 15 times the loss it
posted a year earlier.</LD>
<LD>   The results marked the Denver company's eighth straight
unprofitable quarter as revenue fell 13% from a year earlier,
reflecting "the difficult environment that is affecting the entire
telecom industry," said Blake Bath, a Lehman Brothers analyst. In
addition, the debt-laden company faces a Securities and Exchange
Commission investigation into its accounting and an inquiry by seven
states into its business practices.</LD>
<LD>   Some analysts speculated that Qwest's troubles could force the
ouster of Chief Executive Joseph Nacchio in much the same way that
WorldCom Inc. chief Bernard Ebbers was pressured to resign from his
post Tuesday. "Many investors have run out of patience with Nacchio,"
said State Street Corp. analyst Dean Gekas.</LD>
<TE>   Others said Nacchio's future probably will depend on the outcomes
of the investigations and on his ability to ease Qwest's debt load by
selling off business units. "I think it's way premature to speculate
that Mr. Nacchio is going to go the same way as Mr. Ebbers," said
Thomas Weisel Partners analyst Peter DeCaprio.</TE>
<TE>   Declining demand as businesses cut spending on phone and data
services squeezed Qwest revenue for the first three months of 2002 to
$4.37 billion, down from $5.05 billion during the same period in
2001. That quarter saw a loss of $46 million. Excluding after-tax
nonoperating items of $536 million, the first-quarter loss totaled 10
cents per share--more than double the Thomson Financial/First Call
estimate of 4 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   To offset his company's rising debt, which soared to $26.6 billion
in March, Nacchio announced Tuesday that the company may sell as much
as $10 billion of its assets, including its Yellow Pages business.
Qwest set a May 8 deadline for bids on the directory, which could go
for as much as $8 billion, said David Bank, an analyst with RBC
Capital Markets.</TE>
<TE>   "That's pretty quick for a deal that size," Bank said. "I think
they're trying to mobilize quickly to manage the leverage issue."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the announcement of the loss, Qwest closed up 7 cents to
$5.03 on the New York Stock Exchange. Its shares hit a record low
Monday on concern that Qwest's venture into long-distance markets
would be delayed.</TE>
<TE>   Qwest, the largest local-phone company in 14 Western states, said
it expects to file for long-distance approval with the Federal
Communications Commission in early June. Several states are
investigating Qwest for not releasing agreements with other telephone
companies that had previously spoken out against the expansion.</TE>
<TE>   For the quarter, Qwest reported that long-distance voice, data and
Internet service revenue declined about 39%, or $573 million,
compared with the same quarter a year ago. Wireless services
increased about 28%, or $42 million.</TE>
<TE>   Though the numbers "disappointed," Qwest is looking to add several
hundred million dollars in cash flow through expense controls,
improved use of its network and a growth in the customer base, said
Vik Grover, an analyst with Kaufman Bros. That, combined with a
potential $10 billion from an asset sale, could boost stock prices.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a compelling argument here to own Qwest despite all of
its issues," Grover said.</TE>

California, Arizona and Nevada.</LD>
<LD>   The index sets payments on adjustable-rate mortgages through May.
The index also is used as a base rate for West Coast mortgages and

<LD>Aquila Inc., a U.S. utility owner and energy trader, agreed to buy
closely held Cogentrix Energy Inc. for $415 million in cash to almost
double its power-generation capacity.</LD>
<LD>   Kansas City, Mo.-based Aquila said it also will assume $1.1
billion of debt. It will get stakes in 13 plants in seven U.S. states

<LD>Procter &amp; Gamble Co.'s fiscal third-quarter earnings rose 16% after

sales.</LD>
<LD>   Net income rose to $1.04 billion, or 74 cents a share, in the
quarter ended March 31, compared with $893 million, or 63 cents, a
year earlier. Sales rose 4.1% to $9.9 billion. But revenue missed
some forecasts as a few lines lost sales to rivals and Folgers cut
coffee prices.</LD>

<HD>Dynegy Obtains Credit, Posts Quarterly Loss</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dynegy Inc. said it secured a crucial $900-million line of credit,
sending its stock price soaring even though the energy giant also
reported a $140-million loss during the first three months of the
year.</LD>
<LD>   The commitment of financing, which fell $300 million short of what
Dynegy had sought, strengthens the balance sheet of the Houston-based
company when Wall Street is getting increasingly worried about a
review of one its natural gas deals by the Securities and Exchange
Commission.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of Dynegy rose 30% to $18 on the New York Stock Exchange,
making up some of the steep stock losses incurred after the SEC
review was announced last week.</LD>
<TE>   Dynegy blamed its quarterly loss, which amounted to 41 cents a
share, on the under-performance of its telecommunications division.
During the same period last year, the company made $139 million, or
41 cents a share.</TE>

<HD>FDA Delays Impotence Drug From Lilly, Icos</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eli Lilly &amp; Co. and Icos Corp. said U.S. regulators want more studies
before approving their Cialis impotence drug, delaying a rival to
Pfizer Inc.'s Viagra and forcing Lilly to trim profit forecasts.</LD>
<LD>   The introduction of Cialis, which analysts expected to have annual
sales of about $750 million, will be postponed until 2003 as the
companies try to meet Food and Drug Administration demands. The FDA
found Cialis "approvable" subject to additional studies, agreement on
labeling and inspection of manufacturing facilities.</LD>
<LD>   Lilly cut its 2002 and 2003 profit forecasts because of the Cialis
setback and disappointing sales of Xigris, a new treatment for
sepsis. Lilly had counted on the new drugs for growth as generic
competition erodes sales of its Prozac antidepressant. Cialis would
have been Icos' first product on the market.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Indianapolis-based Lilly fell $2.25, or 3.3%, to $66.05
on the NYSE. Icos shares fell $13.24, or 34%, to $25.76 on Nasdaq,
the biggest one-day drop since the Bothell, Wash.-based biotechnology
company went public in 1991.</TE>

<HD>SEC Urged to Take Lead in Reforms</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: Key House Republican expresses concern over New
York attorney general's probe of analysts' conduct.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A senior House Republican said Tuesday he fears "the precedent and
ramifications" should New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer win
concessions from securities firms to separate their investment
banking and research departments.</LD>
<LD>   Rep. Richard Baker, chairman of the House Financial Services
subcommittee on capital markets, urged the Securities and Exchange
Commission to lead any industry reform "because of the need for
uniformity" in the markets, according to a letter he wrote to SEC
Chairman Harvey L. Pitt.</LD>
<LD>   Spitzer, a Democrat, has been negotiating with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
about structural changes since he released e-mails in April that he
said portrayed the largest securities firm's Internet analysts as
"quasi investment bankers." In the e-mails, analysts and their
managers conceded Merrill's research was influenced by the securities
firm's banking relationships.</LD>
<TE>   New policy is best achieved through an open process "that welcomes
diverse perspectives and the free exchange of ideas, not through
dictates arrived at by the few and outside the public's view," Baker
(R-La.) said in the letter, which was released by his office.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt last week said the SEC started a formal inquiry into
analysts' potential conflicts of interest. Sources said Tuesday that
the agency has begun to request documents from major brokerages.</TE>
<TE>   On May 8, the SEC will consider a proposal Pitt has endorsed,
forbidding analysts from reporting to investment bankers and being
paid from banking revenue.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement Tuesday, Spitzer said that while he agrees there's
a need for uniformity, before his investigation "it was abundantly
clear that no serious fundamental reforms were occurring in the
industry to address conflicts of interest in the securities markets."</TE>
<TE>   Hearings Baker chaired "failed to elicit any of the evidence
necessary to bring about such reforms," Spitzer wrote. "Moreover, no
other regulatory body stepped forward to prevent abuse from
occurring."</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer said in the statement that brokerage reform should include
cutting any link between analysts' compensation and banking,
strengthening the "firewall" between banking and research and
increasing supervision of analysts to detect pressure from banking.</TE>
<TE>   He said the proposed regulations Pitt endorsed "fall short of what
should be legislated in this area."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile Tuesday, the SEC proposed rules to make companies report
"critical" accounting choices used to determine sales and other data.
The proposal would require companies to reveal how they arrived at
accounting estimates about "highly uncertain" finances, such as
projected annual revenue over a five-, 10- or 20-year period.</TE>
<TE>   The rule change also would mandate disclosure of accounting
policies adopted in the last year that significantly affect a
company's financial condition.</TE>
<TE>   The rules, which will undergo public comment over the next two
months, follow Enron Corp.'s collapse last year amid charges that it
hid massive financial problems.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the SEC has been under pressure from Congress to force
companies to be more forthright with investors.</TE>

<HD>WorldCom's New Chief Facing a Major Challenge</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>P.J. HUFFSTUTTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John W. Sidgmore, the new president and chief executive of troubled
WorldCom Inc., made his reputation in the telecommunications industry
as a deal-maker--not a fixer.</LD>
<LD>   Over the last three decades, the 51-year-old executive has built
up several small companies in the information networking business.
His crowning achievement was transforming UUNet Technologies Inc.
into a multibillion-dollar company, and ultimately one of the most
valuable assets of WorldCom.</LD>
<LD>   But the challenge Sidgmore faces now is whether he can repair a
corporate behemoth as broken as WorldCom. Even Sidgmore acknowledges
the enormity of the task.</LD>
<TE>   "I am not saying I will single-handedly turn things around," he
said Tuesday during a conference call with telecommunications
analysts.</TE>
<TE>   He declined to discuss his strategy further, saying simply that he
would evaluate WorldCom's strategic alternatives over the next two
months.</TE>
<TE>   The executive denied the public rumblings that WorldCom was on the
selling block.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to rule anything out, but I was not installed in
this company to sell it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Such verbal broad strokes, though, have failed to inspire many
votes of confidence among Wall Street watchers.</TE>
<TE>   "He doesn't have a very clear view of the company," said F. Drake
Johnstone, a telecom analyst with Davenport &amp; Co. in Richmond, Va.
"They would have been better off to bring in an outside CEO. If
they're going with [Sidgmore], he's got to show that he's going to
make serious moves seriously fast."</TE>
<TE>   Sidgmore, whom his peers and friends describe as someone who
typically avoids risks, now finds himself taking on one of the
biggest gambles of his professional life.</TE>
<TE>   He was one of the earliest executives to spot the potential of the
Internet, and helped build the infrastructure of the information
superhighway when he took over UUNet in 1994--well before the dot-com
craze. At the time, UUNet was a small company with just $6 million in
revenue.</TE>
<TE>   UUNet was acquired for $2 billion by MFS Communications Co. in
1996, and later merged into WorldCom.</TE>
<TE>   "Many people see him as a visionary," said Tim Donovan, spokesman
for Zhone Inc., an Oakland-based networking company that has Sidgmore
on its board.</TE>
<TE>   "But I don't envy the position he's in. It's one thing to turn
around a company that's suffering from an industrywide slump. It's
another thing to have your entire financial situation under
scrutiny."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, WorldCom has suffered along with the rest of the
telecommunications industry as sky-high expectations of increased
demand for data and voice networks have failed to materialize.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the immediate concern is that WorldCom's debt securities will
be reduced to junk-bond status by rating firms Standard &amp; Poor's and
Moody's Investors Service, both of which are reviewing the company's
status.</TE>
<TE>   Reducing the ratings to junk would kick in provisions forcing the
firm to repay $2 billion in loans within 90 days, said Patrick
Comack, a telecommunications analyst with Guzman &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   That would wipe out the company's $2 billion in cash on hand and
make it difficult to refinance debts over the next few years, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people are working under the belief that WorldCom is a
doomed company," Comack said. "His job is to ensure that WorldCom is
a viable company going forward. But I'm not sure that that's the way
the market's evolving."</TE>
<TE>   One crucial problem is a dwindling revenue stream. Competition
from domestic carriers--particularly wireless companies offering
one-rate plans for long-distance calling--is eating away at
WorldCom's core telecom market.</TE>
<TE>   What markets Sidgmore could push WorldCom into to help bolster its
bottom line is unclear. But analysts note that Sidgmore recently has
expressed enthusiasm for voice-recognition, voice-activation and
browser technologies--spurred by rapid advances in recent months--and
for the wireless market.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday, Sidgmore defended the company against investor bondholder
fears and Wall Street doubts.</TE>
<TE>   "The company has a more negative face and look than it deserves,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   With questions about loans made to former CEO Bernard J. Ebbers
and a federal investigation of its accounting practices, "the press,
Wall Street and everybody has a much more negative view [than is
warranted]," Sidgmore said.</TE>
<TE>   But WorldCom should not expect a corporate white knight to save
the company by buying it, Johnstone said.</TE>
<TE>   "The issues facing WorldCom right now are too huge," telecom
analyst Johnstone said. "At the very least, I doubt someone would
want to come in and assume $30 billion in debt. Who would want to do
that?"</TE>

<LD>Deepening a relationship that began more than two years ago, Sony
Corp. and RealNetworks Inc. announced they have formed a strategic
alliance to share digital audio and video technology. The agreement
could result in Real making greater use of Sony's audio compression
and security technology, and Sony incorporating Real software into
more consumer-electronics devices.</LD>
<LD>   Sony also agreed to buy a 1% stake in Seattle-based Real, but no
other financial details were disclosed. The two companies share a
rivalry with Microsoft Corp. in several areas, including audio and
video compression and home-networking technology.</LD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Identix Inc., which is acquiring Visionics Corp. for $287.6 million,
will fire about 120 employees, and four top executives will step
aside when the purchase is completed.</LD>
<LD>   The combined company, to be named Identix Inc., will close offices
in Los Gatos and Dublin, Calif., eliminating about 20% of the work
force.</LD>
<LD>   Identix, which makes fingerprint-identification devices, said in
February that it planned to buy Visionics, which develops
face-recognition technology.</LD>
<TE>   The headquarters will be in Minnetonka, Minn., where Visionics is
located. Identix President Jim Scullion and Executive Vice Presidents
Grant Evans and Sunday Lewis won't join the combined company because
they don't want to relocate, the companies said. Visionics Chief
Financial Officer Bob Gallagher decided to leave to pursue other
interests.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Los Gatos-based Identix, which have gained 80% since the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, rose 53 cents to $7.55 in Nasdaq trading.</TE>
<TE>   Visionics shares, which have more than doubled since Sept. 11,
rose 76 cents to $10.12 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Fans of Internet radio may find their station taking an extended
break today to protest a proposed royalty for musicians and record
labels that could drive many Webcasters off the Net.</LD>
<LD>   Organizers of the "Day of Silence" say hundreds of online stations
will replace some or all of their programming with public-service
announcements, discussions of the new fees or silence. The main
participants will be Internet-only stations, but some over-the-air
broadcasters who transmit their stations over the Web are expected to
take part.</LD>
<LD>   At issue are proposed royalties of $0.0014 per listener per song
for non-interactive commercial stations that broadcast only on the
Net, and $0.0007 for commercial stations that broadcast online and
over the air.</LD>
<TE>   The Library of Congress is expected to make a decision this month
on the fees.</TE>

<HD>UAL Seeking to Replace United's Interim CEO</HD>
<DH>Aviation: Decision could complicate the airline's effort to
recover from huge losses and gain employee concessions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a move that could complicate United Airlines' effort to recover
from huge losses, United parent UAL Corp. said Tuesday that it has
begun looking for a replacement for interim Chairman and Chief
Executive Jack Creighton.</LD>
<LD>   Creighton, 69, was tapped to head the nation's second-largest
carrier last fall after his predecessor, James Goodwin, resigned
under pressure from United's powerful labor unions. Creighton, a UAL
director and former paper-company executive, took the job on a
temporary basis and no timetable was announced for finding his
successor.</LD>
<LD>   The decision to seek his replacement now comes at a critical time.
After losing $2.1 billion last year and an additional $510 million in
this year's first quarter, UAL and Creighton had just stepped up
efforts to persuade employees--which own 55% of UAL--to grant cost
concessions to help the airline rebound.</LD>
<TE>   But the response has been mixed. The pilots union, the Air Line
Pilots Assn., said last week that it was willing to discuss the cuts,
but the Assn. of Flight Attendants said it isn't interested in
agreeing to concessions.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, United continues to lose money as it grapples with the
downturn in air travel, a huge debt load and some of the highest
operating costs in the business.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be hard to imagine making matters any more complicated,
but this will," Ron Kuhlmann, vice president of aviation research
firm Unisys R2A, said of Creighton's pending departure. "It's a
dysfunctional family at this point and nobody seems to be able to
look beyond their own purview."</TE>
<TE>   Creighton said in a statement that he "was brought in for the
short term to stabilize United and improve the relationship between
management and employees."</TE>
<TE>   "We have made some important strides in each of these areas, and I
will continue to focus on those priorities as we search for my
replacement," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Creighton reached two new contracts with the International Assn.
of Machinists, one covering 13,000 mechanics and utility workers and
the other 25,000 ground workers. The union had wanted those pacts
secured before considering any concessions. ALPA spokesman Pat
Palazzolo said the pilots union is "grateful to Jack for his interim
service," and that it "applauds the decision by the company to move
ahead and find permanent management."</TE>
<TE>   "This is one step in United's recovery that employees have been
looking for," Palazzolo said.</TE>
<TE>   UAL said it hired executive-search firm Russell Reynolds
Associates to find a CEO, but didn't indicate when the change might
be made.</TE>

<HD>Venture Investing Up in Southland</HD>
<DH>Survey: Study shows investors committed $819.6 million in
the first quarter, with telecom and biotech companies getting the
largest share.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORA VRANA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Led by the telecom and biotech industries, total venture capital
investment in Southern California companies rose in the first quarter
from the previous quarter, bucking the national trend, a study
expected to be released today will show.</LD>
<LD>   Venture investors committed $819.6 million to Southland companies
in the quarter, up from $711 million invested in regional firms in
the previous quarter, according to the PricewaterhouseCoopers/Venture
Economics/National Venture Capital Assn. quarterly MoneyTree survey.</LD>
<LD>   By contrast, venture investment nationwide fell to a four-year low
of $6.2 billion in the first quarter from $8 billion in the fourth
quarter, the survey showed. Total venture investing peaked at $29
billion in the first quarter of 2000.</LD>
<TE>   The Southland data wasn't all good news: The number of regional
firms that got funding fell to 64 in the first quarter from 92 in the
previous quarter. The survey covers Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego
counties and parts of Ventura and Santa Barbara counties.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the increase in the total level of funding in the region
suggests that venture investors identified young companies with
strong growth prospects, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "The economic diversity of our region is really a strength," said
Randy Churchill, director of business development at
PricewaterhouseCoopers in Los Angeles. "We received funding [across]
a wide range of industries."</TE>
<TE>   Venture capitalists typically invest in fledgling firms in
cutting-edge industries, providing the funding that can lift the
companies into the mainstream. The goal is to reap a big payoff by
eventually taking the firms public or selling them to larger
companies.</TE>
<TE>   Venture investing soared in the late-1990s, but has since crashed
with the plunge in the technology industry.</TE>
<TE>   "For companies trying to raise money now, it's certainly
challenging and depressing," said Jeffrey Starr, a venture capitalist
with Mission Ventures in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the tough climate, Starr said Mission pumped money into
five Southland firms in the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   In total, Southland telecom-related companies received 22.1% of
venture money invested in the quarter, the largest share of any
industry, the MoneyTree survey showed. Even amid the ongoing shakeout
in the telecom sector nationwide, venture investors still are funding
new ideas in the business, particularly in the optical-components
area, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Biotechnology was the second most popular Southland industry
sector, garnering 21.8% of the total invested.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 20% of the venture money invested in the region went to
semiconductor firms in the quarter. Meanwhile, relatively little
money is flowing to Internet and e-commerce firms, the survey found.</TE>
<TE>   The MoneyTree survey counts first-time investments in companies as
well as "follow-up" financing for companies already funded at least
once by venture firms.</TE>
<TE>   Among the regional companies that got funding in the quarter:</TE>
<TE>   * Agensys Inc., a Santa Monica firm developing drugs to fight
malignant tumors, received $42.8 million, the most of any L.A.
company. The firm, with 40 people, is targeting prostate, kidney,
colon and ovarian cancers, among others.</TE>
<TE>   Agensys, which was mostly funded by individuals in its start-up in
1997, found that raising money from venture funds was tough, Chief
Executive Donald Rice said. "We ran into some turbulence due to the
markets and the aftermath of the dot-com and telecom declines," Rice
said. "It was more difficult than normal to get institutional
investors interested."</TE>
<TE>   The company, which last year changed its name from UroGenesys,
hopes to go public, but probably not before 2004, Rice said.</TE>
<TE>   * Arroyo Optics, a Santa Monica firm that develops and makes
"all-optical" telecom routers, got $20 million.</TE>
<TE>   And Auxora Inc., a 2-year-old Baldwin Park firm that makes optical
filters for fiber-optic communications, raised $3 million.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very, very proud of getting this money in this climate,"
said Xin Zhang, chief executive of Auxora. Venture investors in the
firm included Intel Corp. and Rustic Canyon Ventures.</TE>
<TE>   * Intertainer, a Culver City firm with 69 employees, raised $15
million from investors including Microsoft Corp.</TE>
<TE>   "It was brutal," said Jonathan Taplin, chief executive of the
firm, which provides video on demand for broadband networks. Getting
investors for the firm's fourth round of funding took five months
longer than expected, he said, due in part to arguments over the
company's value and a general freeze in investing immediately after
Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   * Cameron Health, a San Clemente firm that develops implant
devices to treat cardiac disorders, took in $31.5 million, nearly
half of the total $76.3 million invested in Orange County firms.</TE>
<TE>   * Tensys Medical Inc., a San Diego firm that develops technology
for cardiovascular monitoring, received $20 million. Nearly one-third
of the San Diego companies that got funding in the quarter were
biotech firms, reflecting the large number of the county's start-ups
in that sector in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   * LivHome Inc., a Los Angeles company that provides personalized
elder-care services, received $1.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   * Strix Systems, a Westlake Village firm that develops wireless
communications equipment for mobile Internet access, got $12.9
million.</TE>
<TE>   There are other money deals in the pipeline for Southland firms,
said Mark Menell, a venture capitalist with Rustic Canyon Ventures in
Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   However, venture activity overall isn't likely to pick up
significantly until the public equity markets stabilize, he said.
Most venture funds still are trying to sustain firms they've already
invested in at least once, Menell said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to help our existing companies get through what we
like to call the 'nuclear winter,'" said Menell, who helps invest a
$550-million fund.</TE>
<TE>   The steep decline in venture investing nationwide means fewer new
businesses and jobs, making it a worrisome economic barometer, said
Sung Won Sohn, economist at Wells Fargo &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said one positive sign in the national data is that
venture investments in early-stage firms comprised 19% of all funds
invested in the first quarter, compared with 16% in the fourth
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "It is encouraging to see that new investment is being made in
early-stage companies," said Jess Reyes, a vice president at data
firm Venture Economics in New Jersey. "It is a positive indicator
that VCs are willing to take on more risk than they did in prior
quarters."</TE>

<HD>CEO of WorldCom Resigns</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Bernard Ebbers built firm into a giant. But debt
load now is a serious burden.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS and JAMES S. GRANELLI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If there is a symbol of all things wrong in the increasingly toxic
meltdown of the telecommunications industry, it is Bernard Ebbers'
WorldCom Inc.--once the symbol of all things right.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, the company announced that Ebbers, a 60-year-old
former college basketball coach and hotel manager, resigned as chief
executive and president of the company that became his life's work.</LD>
<LD>   Starting with a cut-rate long-distance service nearly two decades
ago, Ebbers built WorldCom into the nation's second-largest
long-distance carrier, making its stock as much a must-have
investment as steel, autos and utilities were to past generations. He
did it with an aggressive strategy that was all teeth: acquire,
acquire, acquire.</LD>
<TE>   But that game plan finally caught up with him.</TE>
<TE>   Ebbers' departure, which came amid growing pressure from company
board members, makes him the highest-profile casualty thus far in a
telecommunications bust so relentless that it has vaporized $2
trillion in shareholders' money over the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   And WorldCom has become symbolic of high-tech disaster, neatly
encapsulating all the woes of the industry: overwhelming debt,
declining revenue and questionable accounting practices.</TE>
<TE>   "The big mistake was to have only one growth strategy, and that
was to [buy up] other companies," said Scott Cleland of Precursor
Group, a Washington-based research firm. "When that was over, there
was no growth strategy to replace it."</TE>
<TE>   The company said it is healthy enough to survive the downturn. It
has more than $2.5 billion in cash, steady income from its
long-distance business and a worldwide fiber-optic network that
carries more data traffic than any of its rivals.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a real company, with real profits, with tens of thousands
of customers and a huge asset base that spans the world," said
WorldCom Vice Chairman John Sidgmore, who took over Tuesday as the
company's CEO and president. "So we just don't see this company in
the same position as some of the other companies that have been
liquidated over the last several years."</TE>
<TE>   The CEO change, he added, represents "a new chance, a new day and
a new start for the company."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts and investors seemed unconvinced Tuesday. The company's
stock closed up 13 cents at $2.48 on Nasdaq, but some analysts said
that in part represented buying by "short sellers" who were closing
out bets that the price would collapse, as it has. Also, the value of
actively traded WorldCom bonds continued to sink below 50 cents on
the dollar.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the change of CEO will help things," said Ajay
Mehra, a portfolio manager at Columbia Management Group.</TE>
<TE>   Mergers Gave Rise to Telecom Giant</TE>
<TE>   Within the telecommunications industry, the story of WorldCom's
rise from an idea in a Mississippi coffee shop is as storied as the
rise of Hewlett-Packard Co. from a garage in Palo Alto.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than engineering genius, however, Ebbers had a knack for
acquisitions.</TE>
<TE>   He orchestrated more than 70 mergers, cobbling them together to
make WorldCom a giant in telecommunications despite its location in
tiny Clinton, Miss.</TE>
<TE>   His biggest catch came in 1998 when WorldCom bought MCI
Communications, the nation's second-largest long-distance carrier and
a household name to millions of consumers.</TE>
<TE>   Emboldened by his lengthy acquisition streak, Ebbers announced
plans in 1999 to buy rival Sprint Corp. in a deal valued at $129
billion. Sprint would have provided WorldCom with stronger cash flow
and a much-needed position in wireless telecommunications.</TE>
<TE>   Despite strong resistance from government officials, Ebbers
refused to back down. Ultimately, he lost the gamble and was forced
to call off the deal. Many believe that the failed Sprint acquisition
was the beginning of WorldCom's long slide into financial trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "If it wasn't arrogance, it was certainly a miscalculation" by
Ebbers, Mehra said. "I think it was a crucial blow, almost a lethal
blow for WorldCom."</TE>
<TE>   Today, WorldCom faces a mound of debt--nearly $30 billion in
all--at a time when the telecom industry's prospects are shaky and a
turnaround seems a distant hope.</TE>
<TE>   The long-distance business, the cash-generating engine that has
fueled much of WorldCom's spending, is in sharp decline, and analysts
worry that it may not be able to shoulder the company's debt in 2003
and 2004.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom's problems were compounded by news of massive loans the
company made to Ebbers to prevent him from selling big chunks of
company stock as part of a margin call. Under original terms of the
$366 million in loans to Ebbers, it was unclear when the money would
be paid back.</TE>
<TE>   Ebbers has assets to back up the loans, among them a 163,000-acre
ranch in Canada, a soybean farm in Louisiana and investments in a
yacht-building firm, timber and a refrigerated trucking company,
according to news reports. He recently sold his yacht, Aquasition, at
an undisclosed price.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, company officials said the loans have been converted
to a note that Ebbers will pay back over five years. Sidgmore would
not elaborate on the terms or reveal what severance pay, if any, the
company awarded to Ebbers.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom also faces an investigation by the Securities and
Exchange Commission, which is looking into the Ebbers loans, as well
as the way the company accounted for some of its acquisitions. Those
factors have sent WorldCom stockholders and bondholders into a panic,
worrying that the company might file for bankruptcy protection--a
scenario Sidgmore rejects.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't see any way, under any scenario, that WorldCom is going
to run out of cash in the foreseeable future," he said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "The accounting questions and the SEC investigation and all those
things relative to our financial condition, we really view like red
herrings," Sidgmore said. "They are the result of the fact that we
have lost credibility."</TE>
<TE>   Bankruptcy Worry Not Universal on Wall St.</TE>
<TE>   Sidgmore's comments have been echoed by some Wall Street analysts
who refuse to buy the bankruptcy scare.</TE>
<TE>   "What's going on with WorldCom is what's going on with the markets
overall, though WorldCom brought much of this on itself," said Peter
DiCaprio, an analyst at investment bank Thomas Weisel Partners in
Boston. "You have very fragile markets that are very skittish and
that respond overwhelmingly to the first hint of bad news. That
creates severe swings in prices that you hadn't seen much of before
but now see regularly."</TE>
<TE>   With $30 billion in debt, the loans to Ebbers and plummeting stock
and bond prices, "WorldCom hits all the buttons," DiCaprio said. "But
you could make the same case two years ago that stocks were going up
exorbitantly high on absolutely nothing. Now they're being
annihilated on nothing at all."</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom's woes show that "the meltdown has worked its way to the
highest level of the market," said analyst Vik Grover at Kaufman
Bros. in New York. "It started with the smallest companies and worked
its way through the food chain. Nothing was isolated."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Grover noted, Wall Street has changed its attitude,
especially with state and federal regulators investigating whether
brokerages have tried to win investment banking business from
companies by offering favorable ratings on their stocks, whether
deserved or not.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year, when the industry was refinancing hundreds of millions
of dollars of debts, you didn't see a lot of analysts complaining,"
he said. "Now you're seeing something that we've never seen before:
five or six 'sell' ratings at once on what was one of the Street's
favorite stocks. WorldCom hasn't changed much; it's the economy and
Wall Street that are changing."</TE>

<HD>E-Trade CEO's Pay Tops $77 Million</HD>
<DH>Brokerage: Christos Cotsakos' compensation for 2001 is
about 35 times what he received the previous year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Online brokerage firm E-Trade Group Inc. paid Chief Executive
Christos Cotsakos $77 million last year--more than quadruple what any
other Wall Street CEO earned.</LD>
<LD>   Cotsakos' pay included $29 million in restricted stock,
forgiveness of a $15-million loan and an additional $15 million for
taxes after the loan was reclassified as compensation, according to a
Securities and Exchange Commission filing.</LD>
<LD>   E-Trade, the No.3 online brokerage by number of accounts, has had
cumulative losses of $253 million since 1997, including a
$241-million loss in 2001 as online trading slumped with declining
stock markets. E-Trade shares rose 39% last year, following a 72%
drop in 2000. E-Trade rose 29 cents to $7.54 Tuesday on the Big
Board.</LD>
<TE>   "Shareholders should be asking a lot of questions about the
magnitude of the package," said Bill Coleman, a compensation expert
at researcher Salary.com.</TE>
<TE>   Cotsakos' pay, about 35 times what he earned in 2000, comes as the
firm's board negotiates his new contract, which replaces one expiring
in May. The company, which is facing declining trading business and
consolidation in the online brokerage industry, said it gave him part
of the raise to help retain him.</TE>
<TE>   "It's ridiculous," said William Fries, manager of the Thornburg
Value Fund, which owned 4.7 million shares of E-Trade as of December.
"There are people running companies that are well established, with a
ton of responsibility and doing a lot better, and they don't get paid
this much."</TE>
<TE>   Cotsakos, 53, received $797,880 in salary in 2001 and a cash bonus
of $4.1 million, compared with $756,346 in salary and a $1.4-million
bonus in 2000. The company paid $2.4 million in taxes on restricted
stock that vested during 2001, and $279,678 in taxes on contributions
to his retirement plan.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, Cotsakos made $11 million by exercising options to
acquire about 2.6 million shares.</TE>
<TE>   Cotsakos' pay topped rival executives in the brokerage industry,
including Charles Schwab Corp. Schwab cut the pay of its co-CEOs to
$850,000 apiece, down 93% from 2000, and awarded no bonuses. Wall
Street firms have slashed pay because fewer mergers and acquisitions
and reduced demand for stock and bond sales hurt profits.</TE>
<TE>   Calls to Cotsakos' office weren't returned. An outside spokeswoman
for the firm declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   E-Trade's compensation committee is headed by David Hayden,
chairman of Critical Path Inc., a software maker in which E-Trade was
an early investor and whose board Cotsakos served on. Hayden wasn't
available to comment.</TE>

<HD>26 Walk Out of Shrine in Bethlehem</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Standoffs at church and at Arafat offices
continue. Israeli forces gradually pull out of Hebron, where
Palestinians say soldiers killed several civilians.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER and REBECCA TROUNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>BETHLEHEM, West Bank</DL>
<LD>More than two dozen Palestinians emerged Tuesday from the Church of
the Nativity, the biggest group to leave since a standoff at the
besieged shrine began a month ago.</LD>
<LD>   The Israeli army called the departure a "positive point," while
Palestinians downplayed its importance, saying that talks to end the
siege remained suspended.</LD>
<LD>   The release was the result of low-level negotiations that were not
aimed at finding a final resolution to the crisis at the Bethlehem
site, which is considered by Christians to be the birthplace of
Jesus.</LD>
<TE>   "We are still deadlocked," said Bethlehem Mayor Hanna Nasser, a
member of the Palestinian negotiating team.</TE>
<TE>   The departure came as Israeli forces gradually pulled out of the
West Bank city of Hebron, amid claims by Palestinian witnesses that
at least six of the nine people killed during the two-day incursion
were civilians without ties to militant groups. Among the injured was
a Hebron physician, Dr. Ibrahim Salaymeh, who was hit by shrapnel
while aiding the wounded.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials contacted late Tuesday said every effort was
made during the Hebron operation to spare civilians, although they
added that they did not yet have specific information concerning the
identities of those killed or injured.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not aware of any mistakes," said Israeli government
spokesman Daniel Seaman. "It was not civilians who were targeted.
Civilians may have been killed, but we're not aware of any."</TE>
<TE>   In the West Bank city of Ramallah, Israeli tanks continued to ring
the headquarters of Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat,
and he remained confined there, as negotiators sorted through the
details of implementing a U.S.-brokered plan to end that standoff.</TE>
<TE>   Under terms of the deal, six wanted Palestinians sheltered at the
compound will be transferred to a prison near the West Bank town of
Jericho, where they will be guarded by U.S. and British civilian
wardens. In exchange, Israel will lift the siege on Arafat's battered
offices, where he has been confined since March 29. Israel has
restricted his movements to Ramallah since December.</TE>
<TE>   But even as U.S. and British security experts toured the Jericho
facility, negotiators reported a new dispute Tuesday over whether all
six of the wanted men were included in the agreement. Palestinians
insisted that the accord applied to only four of the men. Talks were
to continue on the matter today, but the dispute was not considered
likely to scuttle the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Men Ignore Offers</TE>
<TE>   of Food and Drink</TE>
<TE>   In Bethlehem, 26 Palestinians left the church about 4 p.m. through
the low front door of the fortress-like basilica. They ignored the
Israeli military's offer of food and drink waiting outside, then
boarded an armored bus to be taken for further questioning. One man
was carried on a stretcher.</TE>
<TE>   The men had been trapped at the site since April 2, when the
Israeli army invaded Bethlehem in search of Palestinian gunmen. Their
departure leaves about 150 Palestinians still inside the church,
including at least 10 suspected by Israel of attacks against its
citizens.</TE>
<TE>   About 40 clerics and church workers from the three Christian
denominations that share the shrine--the Roman Catholic, Greek
Orthodox and Armenian Orthodox faiths--also are inside.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli army said that about half of the Palestinians inside
were civilians and half members of various security forces.</TE>
<TE>   One of the men released Tuesday, Police Lt. Col. Hassan Shehadeh,
said conditions inside the church were desperate. People have been
eating leaves from lemon trees and many are unable to stand, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Shehadeh, the most senior official to come out of the church since
the crisis began, was being treated for dehydration at a hospital
late Tuesday. He appeared worn, his voice hoarse.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody wants to get out, even the men who are wanted,"
Shehadeh said. "But they are afraid they will be shot."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli snipers have shot and killed at least five men since the
standoff began. They have said that in four cases the men were armed.
They also acknowledged the accidental shooting of a mentally disabled
man.</TE>
<TE>   The issue of the fate of the wanted men remains the primary
sticking point in the negotiations to end the Bethlehem siege.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the Vatican announced plans to send Cardinal Roger
Etchegaray to Jerusalem today to help in the negotiations, according
to the Vatican missionary news service, Fides.</TE>
<TE>   The Israelis insist that the wanted men be tried or exiled. The
Palestinians say the men should face justice in Palestinian courts.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinians have suggested that a third party could monitor
the trial, as well as the imprisonment of any of the men convicted, a
solution similar to the one being pursued to end the Ramallah siege.
Israel has not commented on this.</TE>
<TE>   In Hebron, Israeli commanders said just before midnight Tuesday
that the army had completed its gradual withdrawal from the city.</TE>
<TE>   But late Tuesday afternoon, a curfew remained in effect as
soldiers continued to search house to house for militants and
weapons. Tanks and armored personnel carriers dominated several major
intersections and blocked access to Al Ahli hospital where, Israel
said, several wanted men had taken refuge. The hospital's chief
anesthesiologist, Dr. Mazen Arafah, said that it sheltered "only
wounded, not wanted."</TE>
<TE>   Most streets in Hebron were deserted, but here and there knots of
residents gathered in doorways or on balconies to survey damaged
buildings, smashed cars and downed electrical wires. The damage
appeared relatively light, however, compared with that resulting from
the Israeli army's recent moves into other Palestinian cities. An
army spokesman said 150 men, including 52 wanted militants, were
detained and interrogated during the Hebron incursion. Among those
arrested Tuesday was a senior local leader of the Tanzim, the armed
wing of Arafat's Fatah movement.</TE>
<TE>   Hebron Resident Says</TE>
<TE>   6 Civilians Were Killed</TE>
<TE>   At a heavily damaged house on the southwestern outskirts of the
city, several Palestinians accused the army of killing mainly
civilians, not militants, during its incursion.</TE>
<TE>   Hatem Shaheen, whose home was hit by an Israeli helicopter strike
in the early hours of the Hebron assault, said that six of the seven
people killed in and around the building were civilians.</TE>
<TE>   Shaheen, 30, who owns a tourist shop and glass factory, said he
didn't know the seventh victim, one of three wounded men who
collapsed on his doorstep appealing for help. Shaheen said he assumed
that the three were wanted men--their car appeared to have been hit
by a missile--but he added that he felt obliged to help them.</TE>
<TE>   He tried to do so himself, then called several nearby relatives
and friends, including Dr. Salaymeh, to his home, he said. Moments
later, the house was hit by two rockets, which destroyed the entryway
and sent shrapnel flying through the living room.</TE>
<TE>   Five people were killed in the house or the entryway, the others a
short distance away, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Capt. Joel Leyden, an Israeli army spokesman, said he could not
respond to Shaheen's claims but said the army "goes to the greatest
efforts to distinguish between the civilian population and terrorist
targets."</TE>
<TE>   Miller reported from Bethlehem and Trounson from Hebron. Times
staff writer Richard Boudreaux in Rome contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Hunt for Al Qaeda Intensifies</HD>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Hundreds of U.S. and allied soldiers have begun searching both sides
of the Afghan border with Pakistan in an expanding campaign to track
down Al Qaeda fighters that has led to the deaths of four suspected
holdouts in two clashes Monday and Tuesday, U.S. defense officials
said.</LD>
<LD>   About 200 U.S. Army infantrymen and a small number of Australian
special operations troops have been scouring suspected Al Qaeda caves
and buildings amid intelligence reports that terror mastermind Osama
bin Laden is hiding in the lawless Pakistani frontier region of
Waziristan, southwest of Peshawar. They join a force of hundreds of
British Royal Marines, who number 1,600 throughout Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   The firefights highlight both the difficulty of tracking down
lingering Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters and the increased danger
faced by U.S. and other coalition soldiers who have intensified the
border search.</LD>
<TE>   Australian soldiers killed as many as four suspected Al Qaeda
fighters in two clashes in Afghanistan within a mile of the Pakistani
border, military officials said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Both incidents occurred in the mountains southeast of Kabul, where
American warplanes and coalition foot soldiers attacked pro-Taliban
holdouts in March during Operation Anaconda, the biggest ground
battle of the war. Defense officials have said they do not expect the
border campaign to be an operation of that size, in part because the
number of suspected Al Qaeda in the region remains small--"not
thousands," said Army Maj. Gen. Frank L. Hagenbeck, the top U.S.
commander in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The clashes began early Monday when four suspected Al Qaeda
fighters fired mortar rounds and rocket-propelled grenades at
Australian soldiers who were scouting suspected terrorist havens,
defense officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The Australians returned the fire and killed two, U.S. and
Australian officials said.</TE>
<TE>   No Australians were injured. The two slain gunmen were dragged
away by fellow fighters, Hagenbeck told reporters Tuesday at Bagram
air base in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Before dawn Tuesday, two more suspected Al Qaeda fighters were
killed in a second firefight involving Australian forces, said
defense officials, who offered few details.</TE>
<TE>   Figuring that the enemy would regroup overnight, "we were ready
for that, and we killed two," Hagenbeck told Associated Press.</TE>
<TE>   A subsequent sweep of caves and buildings in the area by U.S.
infantrymen from the 101st Airborne Division and the Australians
revealed caches of mortar shells, grenades, machine gun ammunition
and food, Australian Brig. Gen. Mike Hannan told reporters in
Canberra, the Australian capital.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. and Australian officials identified the gunmen as Al Qaeda,
which usually refers to non-Afghan Arabs, rather than Taliban. But
they offered little detail.</TE>
<TE>   "I can confirm that it was the Al Qaeda that fired on our troops,"
Hannan said.</TE>
<TE>   The incidents shed light on a heightened search on the Afghan side
of the porous mountain border, but defense officials have said little
about an ongoing search by U.S. soldiers in the tribal regions on the
Pakistani side.</TE>
<TE>   The Al Qaeda fighters appear to treat the area as if it had no
border, spiriting in and out of Afghanistan in a region with few
governmental controls, said U.S. Special Forces soldiers who have
searched the cave-ridden mountains near the Tora Bora area of eastern
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The "middle-level" Al Qaeda holdouts in eastern Afghanistan appear
to be reporting to commanders who have managed to maintain
communications with an intransigent and organized fighting force,
Hagenbeck said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that they still do have a command-and-control structure
in place," he said.</TE>

<HD>Annan Urges U.N. to Drop Jenin Probe</HD>
<DH>West Bank: Security Council meets today to discuss a
response after Israel opposes the fact-finding mission.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME and MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Tuesday urged the cancellation of a
U.N. investigation into Israel's occupation of a West Bank refugee
camp after the Israeli government announced that it wouldn't
cooperate with the inquiry.</LD>
<LD>   In a meeting with the Security Council, which authorized the
inquiry, Undersecretary-General Kieran Prendergast said that Annan
now favored simply disbanding the U.N. fact-finding team, which has
been in Geneva since last week waiting to begin its mission.</LD>
<LD>   Led by former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, the 20-member
group was charged with assessing the toll of last month's fighting in
the Jenin refugee camp, where Palestinians contend upward of a
hundred civilians were killed during three weeks of fighting.
Israelis say fatalities were fewer and were for the most part armed
combatants.</LD>
<TE>   Earlier Tuesday, Israel's security Cabinet--led by Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon--voted almost unanimously against letting the
investigation proceed unless six conditions were met. U.N. officials
contend that some of the Israeli concerns have been addressed,
whereas the others cannot or will not be.</TE>
<TE>   The Israelis feared that the probe would be biased from the outset
against their military.</TE>
<TE>   Annan asserted Tuesday that the U.N. has already "done everything"
it can to ease Israel's concerns about the personnel, focus and legal
consequences of the fact-finding mission. "I think we've been very
forthcoming," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Israel emphatically disagrees. The government "presented the U.N.
with conditions that are crucial to holding a fair inquiry into the
Jenin affair," the security Cabinet said in a statement after its
meeting. "However, as long as these conditions are not met, it will
be impossible to begin holding the inquiry."</TE>
<TE>   Only one minister, Yitzhak Levy of the National Religious Party,
voted against the decision. Levy said the government should have
unequivocally halted the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   At the United Nations, though, that is exactly how the Israeli
decision was interpreted.</TE>
<TE>   "Since it appears from today's Cabinet statement by Israel that
the difficulties in the way of deployment of the fact-finding team
will not be resolved any time soon, the secretary-general is minded
to disband the team, and I have so informed the council," Prendergast
told reporters here Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The Security Council will convene today to debate its response to
the Israeli decision, with Arab states circulating a draft resolution
that would compel Israeli compliance.</TE>
<TE>   While Annan could decide to cancel the Jenin investigation on his
own, he said Tuesday he preferred to have explicit support from the
Security Council--and, he added, Washington--for any final decision.</TE>
<TE>   "There are lots of accusations, lots of rumors, and we don't know
what is true and what is not, and I really thought it was in
everyone's interest to clarify this matter as soon as possible,"
Annan told reporters here Tuesday. "But in these circumstances, I
cannot leave these gentlemen and women sitting in Geneva."</TE>
<TE>   John D. Negroponte, the U.S. ambassador to the world body, said
the United States would back Annan if he chose to end the Jenin
inquiry, even though the State Department had said that it wanted
Israel and the U.N. to resolve the impasse.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, when the secretary-general makes his decision, we will
fully respect that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Though the United States was the original sponsor of the Security
Council resolution endorsing the Jenin investigation, American
diplomats had come to view the conflict as a divisive and potentially
dangerous distraction from the negotiations aimed at ending the siege
by Israeli forces of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Ramallah
headquarters and the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem. The U.S.
brokered an accord over the weekend to end the Ramallah stalemate,
though it had not been implemented as of Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   From Israel's viewpoint, cancellation of the U.N. mission, even if
accompanied by a Security Council rebuke of Israel's position, would
be preferable to an investigation it feared would be biased, analysts
and officials in Jerusalem argued.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly the prime minister, the Foreign Ministry, the defense
establishment--across the board, there was a consensus that no
committee is better than a flawed committee," said Gerald Steinberg,
a political scientist at Bar Ilan University in Tel Aviv. "Whatever
penalty Israel will pay is less than the cost of a report that is
one-sided and uses terms such as 'war crimes.' "</TE>
<TE>   Annan sent a letter to the Israeli government Saturday summarizing
the results of negotiations with Israeli officials at his offices
here. Annan assured the Israelis that their soldiers and others
interviewed by the fact-finding team would be guaranteed anonymity,
and that there would be no transcripts that might be used in war
crimes prosecutions--two key Israeli demands.</TE>
<TE>   He also noted that he added military and counter-terrorism experts
to the mission who would have examined Israel's complaints that the
Jenin camp had become a base for terrorists hiding among the
civilians. But he refused to remove any of his appointees, or to
assign new leaders. Nor did he accede to an Israeli demand that the
mission's report present facts but no "observations" or conclusions.</TE>
<TE>   Annan had said he expected a formal note of response from Israel
outlining its position, but no such communication was forthcoming.
During the Cabinet debate in Jerusalem, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres
argued that Israel should send a letter to Annan detailing its
objections and offering to continue negotiations. He was overruled.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli government has not replied to any of a series of
recent letters from Annan and U.N. agency directors regarding Israeli
military actions in U.N. refugee camps, according to U.N. officials.
In recent weeks it also refused entry to a team of U.N. human rights
investigators led by former Irish President Mary Robinson, the U.N.
high commissioner for human rights, and Felipe Gonzalez, a former
Spanish prime minister.</TE>
<TE>   One senior Foreign Ministry official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Israel had been wary of the mission from the start.</TE>
<TE>   "We have every right in the world to be extremely suspicious about
anything that comes out of the U.N.," said the diplomat. "We have a
very bad record with them, an unfair record. We may be paranoid, but
we have good reason to be."</TE>
<TE>   As Prendergast, the U.N. undersecretary-general for political
affairs, noted to the council Tuesday, the mission was originally
endorsed "on the basis of assurances of full Israeli cooperation"
from the Israeli foreign and defense ministers. But when Annan named
a team dominated by specialists in humanitarian law and refugee
affairs, rather than military experts, the Israelis retracted their
promise of support.</TE>
<TE>   "The main problem is that they did not think this through at the
beginning," said Ruth Lapidoth, an international law expert at
Jerusalem's Hebrew University.</TE>
<TE>   "The government's change of mind is mainly the result of the bad
relations between Israel and the United Nations, but it leaves a bad
impression internationally when you change your mind so quickly,"
Lapidoth said.</TE>
<TE>   The fact-finding team had been postponed on an almost daily basis
for the past week as Israeli and U.N. officials sought to define
mutually acceptable terms for the inquiry. Continued delays would
complicate an investigation even if Israel and the U.N. could
eventually reach agreement, U.N. officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "Events on the ground are moving rapidly, and with every passing
day it becomes more difficult to determine what took place on the
ground in Jenin," Prendergast said.</TE>
<TE>   "I told the council that in the secretary-general's view, a
thorough, credible and balanced report on recent events in Jenin
refugee camp would not be possible without the full cooperation of
the government of Israel."</TE>
<TE>   The only alternative to scrapping the mission, he told the
council, would be to conduct the inquiry from Geneva, relying on
information from U.N. agencies and other sources in the field. But
Annan strongly favors cancellation.</TE>
<TE>   In Jerusalem, in contrast to most of his Cabinet colleagues, Peres
said he feared that the Security Council might now take "unilateral
decisions against us and without us," and would "interpret our
refusal as if we were scared that they might discover something."</TE>

<HD>Council Bans New Billboards Citywide</HD>
<DH>Environment: Members reject industry proposal to tear down
signs in exchange for adding ones along freeways.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to ban all new
billboards inside the city limits and rejected an industry-backed
proposal that would have permitted companies to build new signs along
area freeways in exchange for tearing others down.</LD>
<LD>   "Let's make it clear: Today, we ... buried new billboards ever
going up in the city of Los Angeles," said Councilman Jack Weiss.
"We're asking two fundamental questions. No. 1: Can't this city have
a little class, just a little bit of class? And No. 2: Can't this
council have a little bit of backbone? ... We are answering both in
the affirmative."</LD>
<LD>   In banning new billboards, Los Angeles joins at least 1,000
communities and six states across the nation that have restricted the
outdoor signs despite opposition from the billboard industry,
according to Scenic America, a conservation organization based in
Washington, D.C. Elsewhere in California, such "visual blight" is
restricted in Marin County, Monterey, Palm Springs, San Diego, San
Jose, Santa Barbara and Santa Monica.</LD>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, the debate over billboards often has had political
and campaign finance overtones. The billboard industry has
contributed to many campaigns by elected officials, and has used its
advertising reach to advance causes and candidates it supports. In
the most recent city elections, Rocky Delgadillo's campaign for city
attorney was touted with billboards, helping him to win a close race
over City Councilman Michael Feuer.</TE>
<TE>   Now the elected city attorney, Delgadillo has to enforce the
city's billboard rules.</TE>
<TE>   Citizens who have followed the issue for years were thrilled by
the quick vote Tuesday morning.</TE>
<TE>   "This is joyful," said Louise Frankel, who represents the Mountain
Gate Community Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Doris Isolini Nelson, a West Los Angeles resident, added that the
growing number of billboards "creates an impression of clutter,
visual clutter."</TE>
<TE>   Nelson said she was especially pleased that the council rejected a
billboard industry proposal to take down one-fourth of the city's
10,000 billboards in exchange for being able to erect 50 double-sided
ads along the freeway.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very distracting for driving," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Billboard industry officials, however, said the city missed a
chance to eliminate billboards with its vote Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We were trying to put a deal together that's fair. I think in the
long run, this was better than fair," said Ken Spiker Jr., a lobbyist
for several billboard companies.</TE>
<TE>   "The city would have gotten more bang for its buck," he said.
"They made a big mistake passing up 2,500 billboards--one quarter of
all billboards in the city. That's just an incredible amount, but
that's gone."</TE>
<TE>   Even as the council approved the ban Tuesday, several members
expressed concerns that the action would not go far enough to clean
up their districts. "The ban of all new billboards does not address
something we face in our communities, which is the enormous blight of
legal billboards," Councilwoman Janice Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas agreed. "We're doing only part of
what, in my view, needs to be done," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Those council members and others said they hope that communities
across Los Angeles will go further and negotiate reductions in
billboards.</TE>
<TE>   That idea will be addressed at a hearing today, when the council
debates the creation of special signage districts that could regulate
billboards within their borders.</TE>
<TE>   Such districts could seek exemptions from the ban in places like
the Sunset Strip in Hollywood, where gigantic billboards are believed
to add to the entertainment atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   They could offer trades to billboard companies, such as offering a
couple of new billboards in choice locations along a busy city street
in exchange for the removal of dozens of signs in residential areas.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the council agrees to allow such districts to be created,
it will not settle the details today. First, local residents or local
officials would propose their creation in various parts of the city
and would recommend their boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   After public meetings, community input and study, the final
districts would have to be approved by the Planning Commission and
City Council. "It's not going to happen overnight," Councilwoman
Cindy Miscikowski said.</TE>
<TE>   Spiker said he hopes billboard companies can work with
neighborhood groups.</TE>
<TE>   "It's way too early. I just don't know," he said. "If the
billboard industry plays ball, we could have something.</TE>
<TE>   If they turn around, take their marbles and leave, nothing was
accomplished."</TE>
<TE>   Miscikowski added that the city's approach to billboards has many
facets.</TE>
<TE>   The government recently launched an auditing system to discover
illegal billboards, the city attorney's office has pledged to pursue
owners of illegal billboards, and city officials are working with
state lawmakers to change a law that essentially makes illegal signs
legal if they have been in place more than five years.</TE>
<TE>   But "today was the most significant," Miscikowski said. New
"billboards are no longer going to be allowed in the city of Los
Angeles."</TE>

<HD>Aliso Viejo Leans Toward Cell Towers in Disguise</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Proposal would make phone antennas blend in. If
the City Council approves, the new law would take effect June 1.</DH>

<LD>When it comes to cellular-telephone antennas, officials in the
year-old town of Aliso Viejo have something more fashionable than
faux palm trees, phony water towers and slightly deformed light poles
in mind.</LD>
<LD>   Make the cell towers part of a building.</LD>
<LD>   Cities across the state have struggled for years to regulate the
tall, spindly poles that dot the landscape. Some towns have enacted
ordinances restricting their location or requiring cell-phone
providers to camouflage them.</LD>
<TE>   Berkeley and San Marcos were dragged into court to defend their
cell rules--the complaint being that zoning restrictions have made it
impossible for the providers to do business.</TE>
<TE>   But in Aliso Viejo--an upscale, master-planned community where
appearance seemingly comes first--officials have drawn up a law that
will make cell towers little more than another architectural element
on a building. The City Council is expected to approve the ordinance
tonight. The law would take effect June 1.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the benefits of being in Aliso Viejo is that things look
nice," said Carmen Vali, mayor of the town of 41,000 residents. "If
you start seeing antennas hanging off of buildings or on every other
light pole, or if you see these fake palm trees popping up, it begins
to destroy the look of the community."</TE>
<TE>   The proposal falls short of banning cell-phone sites from any
area--that would be difficult to defend in court because
telecommunications providers are protected by state and federal laws.
But it does recommend enacting strict design guidelines and requiring
providers to share locations--in other words, put their antennas on
buildings and structures where others already exist. More important,
the law would require the companies to figure out a way to make the
equipment look like part of the architecture.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's properly done, you wouldn't even know it's there," said
John Whitman, Aliso Viejo's public-works director.</TE>
<TE>   If that's not possible, the provider would have to locate the
equipment on a roof, hidden from public view.</TE>
<TE>   The law doesn't ban the traditional cell tower. But all other
options would have to be exhausted before the city would give the OK
to build one. And even then, the design would have to pass
muster--the antennas would have to be as low to the ground as
possible and screened by landscaping or made to look like something
more aesthetically pleasing.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the design, the city would have to see drawings and a
"simulated photo" of the proposed antenna. In some cases, the plans
would need Planning Commission approval.</TE>
<TE>   "We want the best possible installation for these sites, and we
think the best possible and least intrusive installations are on
existing structures," Whitman said. "We have fewer monopoles than
most cities do, and we hope to keep it that way."</TE>
<TE>   Asking cell phone providers to camouflage equipment is nothing
new. The Irvine Spectrum's landmark obelisk, for example, doubles as
a cell-phone tower. What appears to be a lighthouse off Pacific Coast
Highway in Dana Point is actually a cell-phone receiver. Church
steeples, water towers and streetlights also hide cell towers. But
few cities have made such design standards law.</TE>
<TE>   Sue Ryan, a staff attorney for El Cajon, which passed its
cell-phone ordinance last year, said Aliso Viejo's effort to turn
cell towers into architectural elements appears to be unique.</TE>
<TE>   Aliso Viejo City Atty. Scott Smith said he believes the proposal
is legally bulletproof. In drafting the law, he said, the city tried
to learn from other communities' mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been a lot of cities sued," Smith said. "But we've
reworked this substantially."</TE>

<KH>LEGACY OF THE RIOTS: 1992-2002</KH>
<HD>Young Lives Took Unexpected Turns</HD>
<DH>Aftermath: Those who were teenagers in the unrest 10 years
ago follow different paths.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Oscar night was an odd time to remember the riots of 1992, but the
thought struck Calota Odom Morris anyway.</LD>
<LD>   Halle Berry had just accepted an Academy Award for best actress,
the first for an African American, when the question flashed in
Morris' head:</LD>
<LD>   If I had stayed, would that have been me walking across the stage?</LD>
<TE>   A passing thought is a strange yardstick by which to measure a
disaster's effects. But riots do more than kill and burn. They set
people on different tracks, sometimes in the subtlest of ways.</TE>
<TE>   A high achiever opts to go to college out of state and is lulled
into complacency. An aspiring child psychologist finds her calling in
a less prestigious but broader mission. A young man develops a
lasting bond with neighbors he barely knew.</TE>
<TE>   These are the stories of three people who were high school seniors
in Los Angeles in April 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Choosing a Life Far From the City</TE>
<TE>   Part of growing up is forgetting, and the demands of work,
marriage and parenting are enough to keep Calota Odom Morris' head
firmly in the present most days.</TE>
<TE>   Juggling responsibility is nothing new for Morris, who found time
during her four years at Dorsey High School for modeling, basketball
and student government.</TE>
<TE>   "She was a very well-rounded young woman," said her mother,
Alfreda Odom, who had her youngest daughter pegged as a future
lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   People told Morris her face was meant to be in front of a camera,
but she chose basketball over modeling. By her senior year, she was
an all-city selection, the team's captain and most valuable player.
She was also the senior class vice president.</TE>
<TE>   "My coach told me he could get me into UCLA," Morris said from her
home in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   But it had been a tough school year. In October, Banning High
School, a perennial rival, chose to forfeit a game rather than play
at Dorsey after several incidents of campus violence. In March, a
close friend and classmate fatally shot himself playing Russian
roulette on the team bus after a baseball game. In April, the
school's popular baseball coach was arrested on drug charges; other
sports programs were threatened by budget cuts.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the Rodney King verdicts, and the riots. "It was all
just too much," Morris said. "It was too overwhelming."</TE>
<TE>   When the time came to choose a college, she picked Southern
University in Louisiana, mostly because it was far away.</TE>
<TE>   She relished the difference. Her ears were spared the constant
wail of sirens and whir of helicopters; she went to parties without
feeling the need to watch her back.</TE>
<TE>   At first, just being from L.A. made Morris a minor celebrity,
bonding with other kids in the "California Club," captivating her
history class with first-hand accounts of the riots.</TE>
<TE>   Other adjustments were more difficult. Spying on practices of the
school's women's team, Morris sized up its players and concluded
"they weren't that good." But she found muggy Louisiana "was too hot"
to play basketball. Her interest in student government flagged.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all about who you know," she said. "It would have been hard
for an outsider."</TE>
<TE>   Back home, Morris' mother busied herself filling out law school
applications for her daughter, and flew to Baton Rouge for graduation
in May 1996, expecting Morris to return home with her.</TE>
<TE>   But Morris wasn't ready for life in L.A. again. She'd grown
accustomed to the Southern pace of life and had met someone, she told
her mother. She would apply to a school in Louisiana.</TE>
<TE>   "Come October, she still hadn't gotten into school," Odom said. "I
knew then that someone had talked her out of her dream. I was
devastated."</TE>
<TE>   Morris doesn't regret the decision, one she says she made for
herself. She married in 1997 and bore a child later that year. She
didn't return to school, but has a good job managing a rental car
branch office, and no desire to live in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Life is good--different, but then, so is Morris.</TE>
<TE>   She talks about a Southern attitude she considers "more
submissive," then notes a creeping, almost imperceptible change.</TE>
<TE>   "I was always involved," she said. "I always had an opinion, a
voice. But you get content with the Southern lifestyle. Things are
slower, the cost of living is low. You lose that drive."</TE>
<TE>   She counts her blessings: a beautiful son, a wonderful husband.
She visits her mother often.</TE>
<TE>   It is only in the odd moments, watching an Academy Awards show or
a WNBA game, that she ponders what might have been if she had stayed
in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "But life takes you places that you never dream of," she said.
"I'm here. I'm healthy."</TE>
<TE>   Coping With Problems Close to Home</TE>
<TE>   It's a safe bet that none of the meticulous tallies of all that
was lost in the riots mention the fact that Gloria Serrano found
herself.</TE>
<TE>   An honors student at Crenshaw High that year--already admitted to
UC Santa Cruz and UCLA, waitlisted at Brown University--Serrano
wasn't lost in the wayward sense.</TE>
<TE>   One of seven children raised in a part of the city known more for
its street gangs than its scholars, near Central and Slauson, Serrano
stayed out of trouble and loved school.</TE>
<TE>   Her ambition, though, was tinged with a certain aimlessness.
Serrano remembers her Crenshaw years mostly as a pleasant blur of
"general high school stuff," football games, high school dances,
doing whatever other kids did.</TE>
<TE>   "I just knew I wanted to go to college," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She chose Santa Cruz over Brown and UCLA because her best friend
was going there, not sure about a major, maybe law, maybe journalism.</TE>
<TE>   Her memories of the riots are of feelings more than sensations
because her parents kept the family indoors. She remembers fear of
the haphazard violence, restlessness from being stuck in the house,
frustration with people destroying their own communities.</TE>
<TE>   But the firestorm passed, and before long Serrano was off to Santa
Cruz and college. Trees and grass instead of telephone poles and
concrete. Fresh air. No graffiti. The people were different too, and
not just because they were mostly white. There were raging liberals.
Staunch conservatives. "Hippie types." Lots of middle and upper-class
kids, clad in a semi-standard outfit of wrinkled jeans and
Birkenstock sandals.</TE>
<TE>   She made friends and got decent grades, but the draw of home and
family was strong. By her second year, Serrano decided to return
home, applying to USC as a transfer student. She settled on child
psychology as her major, fascinated and curious about the human mind
and why people acted the way they did.</TE>
<TE>   At USC, Serrano started doing volunteer work. Nothing serious at
first: an hour a week tutoring junior high kids to fulfill a class
requirement. Before long she was doing more, helping out at a campus
center for Latino students.</TE>
<TE>   After graduating in 1997, Serrano took a job at the county
Department of Consumer Affairs, wanting to get "some real-life
experience" before pursuing a graduate degree in child psychology.
She volunteered at a social services agency in East Los Angeles, and
it was there that a truth began to dawn.</TE>
<TE>   It was the sheer neediness of L.A. Everywhere, social programs
were filled to capacity and starved for resources--youth activities,
gang diversion, health clinics. It reminded her of friends, hardened
early and lost to gangs, and the neighborhoods they came from,
crumbling from neglect, so different from the carefree kids from
Santa Cruz, nestled in cocoons of affluence.</TE>
<TE>   She thought of the riots and the rage and the need that fueled
them. "I started thinking about the whole idea of person and
environment. Not just on the level of the individual, but on the
macro level."</TE>
<TE>   Serrano befriended some social workers and learned about their
concern with the immediate needs that shape children. It felt more
urgent, closer to the people she knew, than psychology. She got a job
with the county Department of Children and Family Services. She
enrolled in a graduate program in social work at Cal State Long
Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Now in her final year of the program, Serrano works with abused
children, raising a 1-year-old son and living with her husband in
southeastern L.A. County.</TE>
<TE>   She believes she would have made many of the same decisions in
life even if the riots had not happened. Yet the riots serve as a
constant reminder to her that individuals are molded by their
families, schools and neighborhoods--a reminder that we neglect them,
any of them, at our own peril.</TE>
<TE>   "All along, I've felt like, 'Why would you destroy your own
community?'" she said. "I still feel that way. But now I understand a
little more."</TE>
<TE>   Seeing Surroundings in a New Light</TE>
<TE>   Tony Jones sees the world differently from the way he did 10 years
ago because the power went out.</TE>
<TE>   On the second night of the riots, he was glued to the television
with his mother and sister, mesmerized by the sight of a whole city
seething. As the cameras zoomed in on a familiar corner for what
seemed like the thousandth time, Jones leaned forward and--click.</TE>
<TE>   No television, no lights.</TE>
<TE>   Jones stared at the mute screen, eyes and ears thirsty for more of
the bizarre live show.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't occur to him at first to go outside.</TE>
<TE>   "I was the kind of person, that if I was at home, I was in the
house," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't a bad place, second house from the corner on 59th and
Budlong, three bedrooms, green with white trim. Jones' father, a
construction worker, had completely redone the inside before he
passed, and every so often Jones idled on one of the porch chairs out
front.</TE>
<TE>   But he was busy. For a member of the Crenshaw High Elite Choir,
classes were just the beginning. Choir practice every day after
school, twice a day if they were getting ready to tour. Jones had
been to Nice, France; Montego Bay, Jamaica; and Disney World in
Florida.</TE>
<TE>   The time he spent on his own block wasn't much; Jones had only
vague notions of who his neighbors were. A Mexican family in the
corner house next door, an older couple a few doors down, a family
across the street with what seemed like a houseful of kids. He'd seen
them all a hundred times, the way you see neighbors: "Hi" and "Bye."</TE>
<TE>   So when the power stayed out and Jones went outside to see the
black pillars of smoke holding up the sky, he stood with the only
people he really knew on the block, his own mother and sister. But
the outage had affected the whole neighborhood, and soon others began
trickling outside. People who had been neighbors for years shook
hands and introduced themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Jones met the Heweys from across the street, the Martinez family
next door. He met Momma and Poppa Daniels from farther down, and
their grandson Leroy, who looked vaguely familiar.</TE>
<TE>   "It turned out he went to Crenshaw too; he graduated the year I
came," Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   One family at a time they gathered, roughly in front of the
Danielses' house.</TE>
<TE>   Conversation was easy, with Rodney King and the verdicts and the
riots on everyone's minds and lips. Jones remembers his mother
mentioning at some point that she cooked a mean cobbler.</TE>
<TE>   That Sunday, while the Joneses had some people from church over to
visit, Momma Daniels showed up at the door, holding a freshly baked
lemon meringue pie. A few days later, it was Jones' mother carrying
one of her cobblers over to the Danielses.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess it started like that," Jones said. "The neighbors would
see someone carrying something and say, 'Where are you taking that
pie to?'"</TE>
<TE>   No one planned it, but it became a sort of roving potluck, one
family chipping in macaroni and cheese, another collard greens,
someone else bringing spaghetti. At least once a month, sometimes
twice. There was always a reason, a birthday, a new job, a sunny day.</TE>
<TE>   People got to know each other; Poppa Daniels told war
stories--real ones--from his military service during World War II;
Mr. Johnson, the high school coach, talked football; Jones and
Dewayne Carter, the musician from across the street, shared their
love of music. They played cards, board games, shot the breeze.</TE>
<TE>   It reminded Jones of how people treated each other in the Texas
towns where he visited relatives every other Christmas, people in
Marshall and Longview who would speak even if they didn't know you.</TE>
<TE>   "For some reason in California we don't have that," Jones said.
"But I learned how to open up, that you don't have to be scared of
people."</TE>
<TE>   The Daniels family moved to the San Fernando Valley in 1996, and
the Jones family moved the next year to a bigger house a few miles
from the neighborhood. The get-togethers continued, someone always
calling when the next one was happening.</TE>
<TE>   Poppa Daniels died a couple of years ago, and the last families
left on the old block, the Jacksons and Heweys, are talking of
moving. Schedules have gotten busier, and the last get-together was
in February.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, a school bus driver whose passengers these days are
high-school kids the same age as he was in 1992, remembers the riots
for what they taught him about his neighbors and himself.</TE>
<TE>   He's still busy, serving as minister of music at the Hope of Glory
Christian Center at 107th and Vermont. He chats with a neighbor or
two when he has a spare minute, but hasn't met them all yet.</TE>
<TE>   "God," he said with a laugh. "I hope it doesn't take another
riot."</TE>

<HD>Attacking the Problems Behind Bad Attendance</HD>
<DH>Unlike some truant officers of the past, counselors visit
students at home and work to help them overcome tumultuous situations
and get back to school.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DUKE HELFAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Attendance counselor Stephan Blustajn is paying an afternoon visit to
a modest apartment near downtown Los Angeles. Inside, a 15-year-old
girl named Dora is on a couch, watching television.</LD>
<LD>   "Are you bored?" Blustajn asks as a Spanish version of "The
People's Court" drones in the background.</LD>
<LD>   Dora nods yes.</LD>
<TE>   Blustajn is trying to coax Dora back to school, but it's a hard
sell.</TE>
<TE>   Dora dropped out 2 1/2 years ago to care for her sick mother, and
now the television and trips to her mother's doctor fill her days.</TE>
<TE>   "I want home study," she tells Blustajn.</TE>
<TE>   Dora's case may seem extreme to outsiders, but not to Blustajn.
She is just one of dozens of students on his caseload of truants and
dropouts in the Pico-Union district.</TE>
<TE>   As the pupil services and attendance--or PSA--counselor at Berendo
Middle School, Blustajn gets a sobering view of how tumultuous home
lives disrupt schooling in some of the city's most crowded and
impoverished neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   Blustajn deals with students who are homeless and others whose
families cram into hotel rooms or garages with no place to do
homework.</TE>
<TE>   He sees students without money for bus fare or proper clothes to
wear, and others who are overwhelmed by the struggle to adjust to a
new country with a new language.</TE>
<TE>   It's Blustajn's job to help stabilize these students' lives so
they can return to school and be ready to learn.</TE>
<TE>   Blustajn and his colleagues work closely with families and an
array of social service agencies. In some incorrigible cases, the
parents are recommended for prosecution for not ensuring their
children's attendance at school.</TE>
<TE>   The attendance counselors represent a kinder, gentler and more
sophisticated version of the truant officer of the past, whose role
emphasized catching and punishing out-of-school students.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the attendance counselors in the Los Angeles Unified
School District have advanced degrees in social work or counseling.
Blustajn (pronounced Blue-stahj-in) has a master's degree in social
work from USC.</TE>
<TE>   "We look at attendance as a symptom of a greater problem. If you
want to know how kids are going to do in school, just visit their
home," says Blustajn, 39, who is in his second year in the position
after a series of other jobs, including working as a hospital
emergency room technician.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Unified has 260 attendance counselors to cover its 660
schools. Only 98 campuses--including Berendo--have their own
attendance counselor; others have part-time access to one. That
access could be more difficult next year because of budget cuts that
will force campus administrators to choose among counselors, nurses,
psychologists and other support services.</TE>
<TE>   Experts argue that attendance counselors should be protected
against the budget ax because they play a vital role in improving
children's lives. There is also an economic reason to keep the
staffers on the job: They raise school attendance levels, which are
used to calculate school funding from the state.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't matter how well you're teaching. If students aren't in
the classroom, they aren't going to learn," said David Kopperud,
chairman of the state's attendance review board, which guides
attendance practices in California school districts.</TE>
<TE>   "You really have to overcome that barrier before you can go on."</TE>
<TE>   Blustajn is sometimes a youngster's last link to education.</TE>
<TE>   During an afternoon of home visits last week, he started at the
Frontier Hotel at 5th and Main streets in downtown Los Angeles--at
the gritty edge of Berendo's attendance border. On a bench inside the
hotel lobby, Blustajn met with a mother whose 13-year-old daughter
landed on his list because of repeated absences.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the girl said she was not attending school because of
transportation problems. Blustajn gave her bus tokens until she could
get a bus pass. Her attendance has improved. Now Blustajn is trying
to help her family's housing situation.</TE>
<TE>   The parents and four children want desperately to move from the
hotel, where the lobby stinks of cigarettes. Drunks and police
compete for space on the sidewalks outside.</TE>
<TE>   The family has been living in a one-bedroom hotel unit for a year
and has been unable to come up with a deposit payment for an
apartment elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to get out of here because ... my daughters see bodies
taken out of here," said the mother, Sherlette Jex, 30.</TE>
<TE>   As Blustajn and Jex talked, the woman's 2-year-old daughter played
with her 6-month-old sister, strapped into a car seat on the bench.
Twenty feet away, police were handcuffing an unruly man.</TE>
<TE>   Blustajn told Jex that he would try to help her find the funds to
move through a charity or other organization. Then it was to the
Pico-Union district, at Dora's small apartment, a few blocks from
Berendo.</TE>
<TE>   He had been nagging her about returning to school since he
accidentally discovered her at home last year during a visit intended
to check on her younger brother, Ramon.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Blustajn found Dora in bed with a cast on her left
leg--she had been wounded in a drive-by shooting and has since
recovered.</TE>
<TE>   Advice Includes Other Options</TE>
<TE>   On the visit last week, Blustajn once again urged Dora to finish
her education, which she stopped in seventh grade. He told her that
she could attend a continuation school or a skills center to learn a
craft. She said she didn't have any identification to register. So
Blustajn pressed her to get an ID card at the Department of Motor
Vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   As they talked, Blustajn turned to Ramon, who was sitting on the
couch, and offered a word of encouragement: "You're doing really
well, Ramon." Ramon now has a much better attendance record and
checks in with Blustajn every morning before school starts.</TE>
<TE>   Before he left, Blustajn asked Dora: "So we have a plan?"</TE>
<TE>   Blustajn wasn't sure whether Dora would follow through. She had
failed to show up for five previous appointments in his tiny office
at Berendo.</TE>
<TE>   But Dora did arrive to see Blustajn on Monday. He signed her up
for an alternative program for high school dropouts. She could earn
her diploma. .</TE>
<TE>   "It's all about following through for the future," Blustajn told
Dora. "When you go to school every day, even when you don't want to,
that's following through."</TE>
<TE>   Dora looked toward the floor. She said barely a word. When they
finished their meeting, however, she smiled faintly and said:
"Thanks, Mr. Blu."</TE>
<TE>   The next day, Blustajn took Dora to enroll at her new school.</TE>

<HD>Deputy Remembered as a Kind, Gentle Man</HD>
<DH>Crime: As search for his killer presses on, friends, family
say David March liked to aid people picked on by 'the bad guys.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET and LAURA LOH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As detectives continued their search Tuesday for Deputy David March's
killer, friends and relatives remembered March as a gentle man who
couldn't stand a bully and sometimes brought home abandoned dogs.</LD>
<LD>   "He felt like he was helping people who were being picked on by
the bad guys," David Lindsey, 54, said of his son-in-law, who had
joined the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department seven years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Although the motive for the shooting is unknown, homicide Det. Ray
Peavy said investigators suspect the killer may have been a drug
dealer with something to hide.</LD>
<TE>   March, 33, pulled over a black Nissan sedan about 10:30 a.m.
Monday in Irwindale. He and the driver got out of their cars and met
halfway, when the man shot the deputy repeatedly with a semiautomatic
handgun, Peavy said. March did not have a chance to fire back.</TE>
<TE>   "He was caught totally by surprise," Peavy said. "It happened
totally within a split second."</TE>
<TE>   In March's living room Tuesday, where friends and family had
gathered, his mother, Barbara, refused to cry. She said she wanted to
focus on her son's positive contributions.</TE>
<TE>   March was the oldest of her two children, a gawky, sensitive kid
who took a lot of beatings growing up in Santa Clarita, Barbara March
said. But after beefing up--as an adult, he was 6-foot-4 and weighed
230 pounds--the Canyon High graduate did not forget what it felt like
to be bullied, his mother said.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him if somebody picked on him," he was never supposed to
throw the first punch, she said. "But if they hit you first, go for
the nose and draw blood."</TE>
<TE>   March's father, John, said it took his son three years to pass the
Sheriff's Academy entrance exam.</TE>
<TE>   When he passed the written part after numerous tries, he failed
the orals because of nerves, he said.</TE>
<TE>   March suffered from shin splints while in the academy. His family
would rub his legs at night and bought him special shoes. Eventually,
he made it.</TE>
<TE>   Like many deputies, March spent his first five years working at a
county jail, Pitchess Detention Center in Castaic. There, his mother
said, her son got a crash course in the ways of the world.</TE>
<TE>   When he moved to a patrol job in the San Gabriel Valley two years
ago, he was wiser, but "I don't think he [was] calloused," said Capt.
Roberta Abner, commander of the Temple City station where March
worked.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he was a kind person," Abner said. "He'd certainly look
for the good in people first."</TE>
<TE>   He was known for bringing home stray puppies to Teri, the high
school sweetheart he married five years ago, and Teri's 13-year-old
daughter, Kayla.</TE>
<TE>   Teri March forced a smile when someone reminded her about the
gemstones her husband used to carry with him at work.</TE>
<TE>   "Just because they were sparkly and pretty," she said.</TE>
<TE>   To cut down his hourlong commute, March had planned to transfer to
the Santa Clarita station starting Sunday. His father-in-law said
March was looking forward to the extra family time.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the Temple City station Tuesday, the flag flew at
half-staff. Inside, dozens of well-wishers poured into the lobby to
leave flowers and offer condolences to the deputies who wore black
mourning bands on their badges.</TE>
<TE>   The killer is described as about 5-foot-7, Latino, with short hair
and a mustache.</TE>
<TE>   The gunman's car, which may have been carrying two passengers, has
tinted windows and the California license number 4BCZ512.</TE>
<TE>   The plate led to another man, whom investigators detained for
questioning. He was not arrested, and investigators would not say
whether the man knows the killer, citing the ongoing investigation.
Authorities said they have not found the car.</TE>
<TE>   "We are making progress," Peavy said.</TE>
<TE>   Several deputies have been shot at in recent years in the
unincorporated Monrovia area. Less than two years ago, a deputy was
shot by a teenage gang member about a mile from the intersection
where March was killed, authorities said.</TE>

<HD>Ad Man Gives His Bitter Divorce a Happy Ending--in a Film
Fantasy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Go ahead. Laugh at Steven Dworman's messy divorce. He wants you to.</LD>
<LD>   Dworman, who runs an infomercial and advertising business, turned
the story of his marriage's breakup into a cathartic comedy called
"Divorce, the Musical."</LD>
<LD>   The novice filmmaker bankrolled, wrote, directed and starred in
the $1.5-million, 86-minute movie. And now he has rented a Santa
Monica theater--five blocks from his ex-wife's home--and blanketed
the Westside with fliers and signs on the sides of buses to entice
people to see it.</LD>
<TE>   To the surprise of some, more than 3,000 have bought tickets in
the last two weeks--some returning to see it more than once.</TE>
<TE>   The movie chronicles the hard-luck story of a man's acrimonious
divorce and his subsequent effort to win the affection of his teenage
daughter. For the 46-year-old Dworman, it's almost autobiographical.</TE>
<TE>   In the movie, the lead character is a television infomercial
producer who tries to make his daughter like him by producing a
musical that will showcase her talent in singing and acting. He
decides that the subject of the musical will be divorce. And the
show's cast will be made up of children.</TE>
<TE>   Dworman's character spends so much time putting the show together
that his advertising business starts to suffer as his relationship
with his daughter continues to languish. By the end of the movie,
however, the business is bouncing back. And his daughter loves him,
he has a new girlfriend and his ex-wife respects what he has done.</TE>
<TE>   In real life, none of that last part has happened.</TE>
<TE>   He and his ex-wife don't speak, and he hasn't seen his 17-year-old
daughter in two years, Dworman said.</TE>
<TE>   "To my knowledge, they haven't seen the movie. But they live here
in the neighborhood. I know they know about it. I know they got a
postcard advertising it. Everyone in Santa Monica did," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Dworman said his daughter read part of the script to "Divorce, the
Musical" 21/2 years ago. But she was put off by the script's
depiction of the mother as having a lizard's face, he acknowledged.
(In the movie, the ex-wife character sheds the lizard look in the end
and is shown to be a beautiful woman.)</TE>
<TE>   Dworman's ex-wife, Nancy Griffin, could not be reached for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Dworman said he got the idea for the musical five years ago after
taking his daughter to a children's production of "Oklahoma!"</TE>
<TE>   "It came in a flash: Why not do a movie with a children's view of
divorce? Kids are bitter and angry about divorce. But this could be
funny and heartwarming--about a man being reconnected with his
daughter," he said. "Was it wishful thinking? Absolutely."</TE>
<TE>   Dworman, of Brentwood, sold a portion of his business to finance
the movie. It has a cast of 60 and was shot over 19 days at a dozen
Los Angeles-area locations in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Production of the comedy was not always a barrel of laughs,
however. Actress Anneliese van der Pol, who was 14 when she portrayed
the daughter, was hospitalized in the middle of the shoot. Part of
the crew staged a walkout to protest 18-hour workdays. One of the two
cameras used to photograph the musical numbers was defective and
inserted an optical line in every scene.</TE>
<TE>   Because the young actors had to return to school and could not
re-shoot the scenes, Dworman said, he had to pay a special-effects
lab to manually remove the line, frame-by-frame.</TE>
<TE>   He has spent another $41,000 advertising the movie (bikini-clad
skaters have even handed out fliers along Venice Beach), which runs
nightly through Thursday at the Aero Theater, 1328 Montana Ave. Free
admission is available to those who show divorce papers dated April
or May, Dworman said.</TE>
<TE>   The movie contains nine song-and-dance routines--including an
overhead, Busby Berkeley-like scene in which young dancers resemble
eggs and sperm. It has been praised by some who have seen it.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very funny. It made me cry at the end. Anyone who has gone
through a divorce can relate to it," said Victoria DeLaGuerra, the
owner of a West Los Angeles skin care salon.</TE>
<TE>   Darla Michelle, a Westside classical music flutist, said she has
seen it three times. "There were funny lyrics to the songs that I
missed the first time because I was with a crowd laughing a lot, so I
went back," she explained.</TE>
<TE>   Times film reviewer Kevin Thomas was less charitable, dismissing
the film in a brief review as "wholly inept and unfunny."</TE>
<TE>   Dworman, who was married to Griffin for 31/2 years, says the movie
is not a slap at his ex. "It isn't revenge. I didn't do it to get
even," he said. He said he hopes his daughter sees the film and
recognizes it as "a positive" reaction to a difficult time in his
life.</TE>
<TE>   For now, he is looking for a distributor who will release it to a
wider audience. And Dworman--who briefly remarried after divorcing
Griffin--is working on another script.</TE>
<TE>   No, it will not be "Divorce, the Sequel," he pledges.</TE>
<TE>   So you can relax, Diana Twomey of Atlanta--ex-wife No. 2.</TE>

<HD>Trustees Find Cuts to Budget Difficult</HD>
<DH>Education: L.A. Unified board struggles to pare $385
million, and may need to trim another $44 million. Class sizes are
raised in fourth through 12th grades.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DUKE HELFAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Board of Education on Tuesday painfully approved
dozens of budget cuts for next year, raising class sizes in fourth
through 12th grades, slashing administrative offices and limiting
maintenance of campuses.</LD>
<LD>   After a contentious, 12-hour meeting, cuts totaled about $384.6
million--7.4% of the district's $5.2-billion general fund budget.</LD>
<LD>   Board members said they may have to find another $44 million in
trims later this month to balance the books of the nation's
second-largest school district.</LD>
<TE>   Trustees approved on a 4-3 vote the controversial proposal by
Supt. Roy Romer to increase average class sizes in fourth through
12th grades by one or two students, bringing many classes to 40 or
more. That will save about $48 million.</TE>
<TE>   Romer conceded that those measures would hurt the Los Angeles
Unified School District's progress in improving academic achievement
just as it anticipates adding 12,500 students next year to its
current 736,000 enrollment.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be foolish for me to say we're going to cut 400 million
bucks from this budget and promise that things are going to improve,"
Romer told the school board Tuesday. But he said there were no
alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   Board President Caprice Young and trustees Marlene Canter,
Genethia Hayes and Mike Lansing voted to increase class sizes, while
Jose Huizar, Julie Korenstein and David Tokofsky voted no.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately after the vote, Tokofsky questioned whether board
members violated the state's open meetings law by talking during a
dinner break and changing their prior no votes in favor of the
measure.</TE>
<TE>   The board had voted earlier in the day 6 to 1 against increasing
class sizes, with Young voting yes.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to register concern about the change that occurred
during the 45-minute [dinner] break," Tokofsky said.</TE>
<TE>   Young said she spoke to two other board members about the
class-size issue but didn't talk with a majority of board members.</TE>
<TE>   The other cuts approved Tuesday would, among other things,
increase the size of special education classes and double the number
of students, to 20, in remedial classes for failing second-graders.
Funds to restore gardening and custodian positions will not be
available. .</TE>
<TE>   The board voted down some of Romer's other proposals to target
funding for secondary school counselors, library aides, arts programs
and extra assistant principals at crowded campuses.</TE>
<TE>   Romer originally proposed $459 million in reductions, allowing for
about a $31-million cushion if the board voted against some of his
ideas. In all, $428 million worth of cuts would represent 8% of the
district's $5.2-billion general fund budget.</TE>
<TE>   The district is in its worst financial bind in a decade because
costs have risen for special education, workers' compensation and
legal services, officials said. In addition, the district gave
teachers an average 11.5% raise last year.</TE>
<TE>   School districts throughout the state, experts say, face similar
predicaments--though on much smaller scales than Los Angeles. The
funding problems have been exacerbated by a weaker economy, resulting
in the state delivering less than what districts said they needed in
education funding.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Unified already has pared nearly $110 million from its budget
this school year, taking $59 million directly from schools and the
rest from administration.</TE>
<TE>   "School districts, like all public agencies, are facing
double-digit increases in costs. It is a very devastating challenge
for schools," said Kevin Gordon, executive director of the California
Assn. of School Business Officials.</TE>
<TE>   "When you are in L.A. Unified, everything is magnified because of
the sheer size."</TE>
<TE>   District officials said they do not expect layoffs, but hundreds
of teachers and other employees likely will be transferred into new
jobs as their current positions are eliminated.</TE>
<TE>   New nurses, counselors and others said they did not believe the
no-layoff assurances, and feared that their jobs will be eliminated
as senior colleagues bump them in an upcoming shuffle.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of the Los Angeles teachers union, meanwhile, said the
anticipated 4% cut to schools' spending will slice important services
such as nursing, psychologists and social workers.</TE>
<TE>   "Please don't be fooled into thinking that there's enough
discretionary money to buy back the cuts you are making," Becki
Robinson, a vice president of United Teachers-Los Angeles, told the
board.</TE>
<TE>   "These funds already purchase school nurses, psychologists,
computer lab teachers and professional development activities."</TE>
<TE>   The school board agonized over many cuts, particularly those
affecting low-performing and year-round schools in the district's
most crowded areas.</TE>
<TE>   The board refused to cut extra principals at these schools as
Romer had recommended in hopes of savings of $2.9 million. They also
rejected another plan to take $5 million in discretionary money from
year-round campuses.</TE>
<TE>   "I will not support cuts to classrooms and school sites that
disproportionately impact our most overcrowded, lowest-performing
schools," said board Vice President Huizar.</TE>
<TE>   "The school district is headed in a direction that would further
perpetuate a separate and unequal learning environment within LAUSD."</TE>
<TE>   The board started by cutting about $36 million from the budgets of
its central administration and 11 local divisions--about 8% of their
respective budgets.</TE>
<TE>   One of the local superintendents from the San Fernando Valley said
her subdistrict's cuts will force the elimination of teacher coaches
and an attendance counselor who helps truants and dropouts return to
school.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't afford to take additional cuts beyond this and do the
jobs we've been asked to do," said Judy Burton, superintendent for
the central and eastern San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Romer noted that many of the local districts have just one
secretary to answer calls from as many as 60 schools.</TE>
<TE>   School board member Hayes also voiced concerns about the cuts to
the local districts, which lost funding this year in the previous
round of budget reductions.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very worried about cutting these positions and moving ahead
with reforms and holding our schools accountable," Hayes said.</TE>
<TE>   Romer said some of Tuesday's cuts could be reversed if the school
district receives $70 million in anticipated funds from the state for
low-performing schools.</TE>
<TE>   School principals will start assembling their own budgets in the
coming weeks. But the school board expects to make deeper cuts after
Gov. Gray Davis releases a revised state budget later this month.</TE>

<HD>A Glaring Omission From Legacy of the Riots--Apologies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Lopez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Call me naive, but I'm still waiting for one person to fess up. Just
one guy to walk into a store and say, you know what? I looted this TV
10 years ago when the streets were wild, and I don't want my kids
watching this stolen property one more night. Here's the money I owe
you.</LD>
<LD>   No. I am not holding my breath.</LD>
<LD>   In coverage of the 10-year anniversary of the Rodney King verdict
and the senseless destruction that followed, I've seen explanations
and recollections. I've seen claims of progress and complaints about
the lack thereof.</LD>
<TE>   But in the entire deconstruction of 1992, I haven't seen or heard
one person take responsibility for the rampage or the suffering it
caused, nor have I seen much of a condemnation of it.</TE>
<TE>   Fifty-four dead. More than 3,000 stores looted or burned. A
billion dollars in damage.</TE>
<TE>   Not one mea culpa.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what galls me the most," said Charles Kim, who heads the
Korean American Coalition. Kim reminds me that hundreds of Korean
families had their entire holdings reduced to ashes and were never
compensated. "Ten years later, who's saying I'm sorry? The mayor? No.
The governor? No. The police chief? No. I haven't seen anyone say
it."</TE>
<TE>   I was on the streets of Los Angeles in 1992, sent here by an East
Coast newspaper. One day, I stopped my car at a long line of people
waiting to pick up their mail after delivery had been cut off. They
took offense at my very presence, saying there was no way I could
tell their story accurately, and ran me off the street.</TE>
<TE>   Fair enough. They had good reason to be worked up, distrustful,
and in no mood to chat with an interloper. The economic crash had hit
south Los Angeles like a bomb, and when the cretins who beat the
living daylights out of Rodney King took a walk, everyone knew
there'd be a price to pay.</TE>
<TE>   But the burning and looting were insane. Look, I can appreciate
people being enraged about getting the short end of it at every turn.
But nihilistic mobs obliterated primarily their own neighborhoods and
drove out the only merchants who'd set up stakes. It made no sense,
even though there'd previously been tension between the black and
Korean communities.</TE>
<TE>   There's been plenty of hand-holding and prayer offerings in the
last few weeks, lots of chatter about healing and moving on. But how
can you get more than two steps down that road when Charles Kim
speaks of the bitterness that remains?</TE>
<TE>   He says businesses that were destroyed by the hundreds were built
by families who worked from sunrise to sunset--Dad, Mom, the
grandparents and even the children pitching in. For the most part,
those families had no health insurance because they couldn't afford
it, and they had no property insurance for the same reason.</TE>
<TE>   "Many merchants filed for bankruptcy, their houses were
foreclosed, their kids dropped out of school," Kim says. "The Korean
community suffered tremendously, and who pays attention? The media?
No. The black community got millions of dollars after the riots.
We're the victims, and how much did we get? Nothing."</TE>
<TE>   I asked the Rev. Mark Whitlock of FAME Renaissance, which has
helped rebuild the community that suffered worst in 1992, whether he
thought it would be useful for someone to utter the words Charles Kim
has waited 10 years to hear.</TE>
<TE>   No one apologized for slavery, Whitlock said. Obviously, he went
on, the burning and looting and the taking of life were wrong. But it
was done by every race, he pointed out quite accurately. "And, I
would contend, probably some Asians, too."</TE>
<TE>   "So who should apologize?" Whitlock asks.</TE>
<TE>   How about those who burned and looted? How about so-called
community leaders whose silence was an endorsement? Some of those
same leaders have had their hands out ever since, pleading for
someone to invest in the neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Guess what. Korean merchants invested in the neighborhood. It
didn't work out all that well for them.</TE>
<TE>   "There's repentance and sorrow in every circle I travel in," says
the Rev. Cecil "Chip" Murray of First AME Church. "How ridiculous it
was to set those fires. How understandable, but how ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   This is exactly what I'm talking about. With all due respect to
the reverend, it wasn't understandable.</TE>
<TE>   Anger was understandable. Rage was understandable.</TE>
<TE>   Looting and burning 3,300 businesses run by people just trying to
get from one day to the next was not understandable, it was
unforgivable. And I don't know why no one's got the courage to
unconditionally condemn it as an episode as vile as the beating of
Rodney King.</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Murray told me it's time to move on. "It is totally
useless," he said, "to keep playing in the ashes."</TE>
<TE>   I never considered it play, and my guess is that Charles Kim
didn't, either.</TE>

<HD>Bill Would Ban Indian Mascots</HD>
<DH>Sports: Activists meet little resistance in the Legislature
in bid to bar the controversial icons in state's public schools.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIGUEL BUSTILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Fed up from years of battling local school boards over what they
consider an issue of basic civil rights, Native American groups are
pushing legislation that would make California the first state in the
nation to banish all Indian team mascots from public schools.</LD>
<LD>   Local crusades to rid schools of the cartoon chiefs and tomahawk
chops that many Native Americans consider culturally insensitive
often run counter to popular sentiment. They almost always meet
resistance from students and alumni bent on preserving tradition, as
well as conservatives crying foul over political correctness.
Sometimes they encounter opposition from other Native Americans.</LD>
<LD>   But so far in Sacramento, the activists have found virtually no
resistance, and may be poised to win their biggest victory since
Stanford University retired the Indians and embraced the Cardinal
three decades ago.</LD>
<TE>   "Locally, it is suicide," said John Orendorff, a Los Angeles
school counselor and veteran of the mascot wars. "This is
groundbreaking."</TE>
<TE>   If it becomes law, the measure by Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg
(D-Los Angeles) would accomplish in a single stroke what activists
have been attempting to do for years: running the Redskins, Apaches,
Comanches, Chiefs and Indians out of school gymnasiums across the
state.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, it could also mean the end of the Imperial Valley
College Arabs, the Hollywood High Sheiks and a mass of other
non-Indian mascots, because the bill's larger goal is to ban mascots
and team names deemed derogatory to any racial or ethnic group from
all K-12 schools and colleges.</TE>
<TE>   Two existing state education commissions would act as arbiters of
mascot taste, charged with sorting out which were officially
offensive. Most Native American mascot names are identified in the
legislation and would be phased out. Dozens of schools would be
prohibited from purchasing logos, sweatshirts and uniforms that
feature such mascots starting in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody is pointing a finger saying, 'You racist dog,'" said
Goldberg, a former Compton teacher and board member of Los Angeles
Unified School District. "We understand this was not meant to be
offensive. But it is."</TE>
<TE>   Native American mascots became talk-show fodder recently when an
intramural basketball team at the University of Northern Colorado
named itself the Fightin' Whites--and adopted a logo of a
square-looking fellow straight out of the 1950s--to protest a nearby
school's mascot, the Fightin' Reds. But the issue has been simmering
a long time.</TE>
<TE>   Though many Native Americans stewed for years about culturally
insensitive depictions, it was not until the late 1960s, when the
National Congress of American Indians led a drive to eliminate
stereotypes in the media, that groups launched formal efforts to get
rid of the images in sports.</TE>
<TE>   Within two years, Dartmouth College scrapped the Indians and
became Big Green, and Oklahoma got rid of Little Red, a dancer who
skipped along the sidelines during football games. In 1972, Stanford
cut loose the Indians and returned to the color Cardinal, a decision
that has never been fully accepted by some longtime fans. It later
adopted a dancing tree as mascot.</TE>
<TE>   Numerous others have since followed suit, including L.A. Unified,
which banned Native American mascots in 1997. In all, only about
1,200 of the 3,000 or so Indian mascots activists fingered 30 years
ago still exist, according to the Morning Star Institute, a
Washington-based Indian rights organization.</TE>
<TE>   But many Indian mascots and nicknames remain--most prominently the
Washington Redskins and Kansas City Chiefs of the National Football
League, and the Cleveland Indians and Atlanta Braves of Major League
Baseball. And a number of major public institutions have resisted
change, notably the University of Illinois, where groups for years
have protested mascot Chief Illiniwek.</TE>
<TE>   "No one ever said, 'This is the redskin I want to marry,'" said
Susan Shown Harjo, the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit that seeks to
strip the Redskins of their federal trademarks to force a name
change. "It's always, 'You dirty redskin.'"</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, the federal Trademark Trial and Appeal Board ruled in
favor of Harjo's contention that a word identified in dictionaries as
a slur should not be trademarked. The Redskins, who argue that the
name honors Native Americans, have appealed.</TE>
<TE>   Some schools have tried to walk a middle line, including San Diego
State, where protests over Aztecs mascot Monty Montezuma led to
modifications that made Monty a graceful ambassador rather than a
bare-chested macho man meant to rouse the crowd. The dignified Monty
satisfied few critics, however, and the controversy continues.</TE>
<TE>   New York and Minnesota have asked schools to begin phasing out
Native American mascots, and the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights said
last year that the mascots were "offensive to American Indians" and
should be abolished. Still, no states have banned them. A measure to
do so in Wisconsin last year died in committee.</TE>
<TE>   The California campaign is led by the Alliance Against Racial
Mascots, an L.A.-based coalition of Native Americans and others who
consider the cause a civil rights matter. It says the problem is not
just the mascots, which are often crudely stereotypical, but the
accompanying game-day antics that mock Native American culture.</TE>
<TE>   "I've talked to a great number of Native American youth who are
just embarrassed when they do the tomahawk chop or play the
stereotypical Hollywood drumbeat," said Lori Nelson, the group's
director. "There is real harm and real damage. This is denigrating to
many people."</TE>
<TE>   More troubling, activists say, is what happens in the stands when
the Indians or Chiefs travel to play a rival. Orendorff, the former
head of L.A. Unified's American Indian Education Commission, can't
shake what he saw several years ago when he took his 7-year-old son
to see a football game between the Burbank High Bulldogs and the
Bishop Alemany High Indians.</TE>
<TE>   His son pointed out a large banner on the Burbank side that read
"Slaughter the Indians." When Orendorff complained to a Burbank
official, the man "muttered something about political correctness"
and walked off, Orendorff said. The banner was later flanked by two
security officers. It flew until the game was over.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to be a great role model to my son. I don't want to see
him see me in cuffs and dragged away," Orendorff said. "But if he
wasn't there, I would have done it. I would have gone up there and
torn down that sign."</TE>
<TE>   Though Goldberg believes such testimonials make it difficult for
anyone to oppose her bill, AB 2115, she stepped into a recent hearing
of the Assembly Higher Education Committee unsure whether it would
survive. It wound up passing without a single no vote after a
remarkable exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Tony Strickland (R-Thousand Oaks), a former college
basketball player for the Whittier College Poets, recalled playing
many Indian-themed teams in his athletic career. Then he asked a
question Native American activists often hear when arguing for
change: Exactly why are these mascots so offensive to you?</TE>
<TE>   Amber Machamer of the Coastal Band of the Chumash Nation offered
an emotional reply. To honor the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., she
said, you would name the school after him, not the mascot.</TE>
<TE>   "You wouldn't have John F. Kennedy High School," she said, "with
the Jackiettes as the cheerleaders."</TE>
<TE>   Strickland and other Republicans abstained from the vote. A
similar hearing in the Assembly Education Committee went much the
same way last week, with Democratic support and Republican silence.
It must still clear the full Assembly, and then the Senate, before
reaching the desk of Gov. Gray Davis, who has taken no position on
the measure.</TE>
<TE>   One of the reasons for the meager opposition may be the power--or
perceived power--of the state's Native American tribes.</TE>
<TE>   With their newfound wealth from gambling casinos, California
tribes have become major political players in the state capital in
recent years, showering millions in campaign contributions on
Republicans and Democrats alike. Though most tribes have taken no
position on the mascot bill, some legislative sources privately say
that fears they will become involved this election season have
stifled opposition.</TE>

<HD>Sanchez Says Dart Gun Used in Assault</HD>
<DH>Court: Suspect in Moorpark student's slaying unexpectedly
takes the stand to deny using a real weapon in earlier rape. Hearing
is expected to end today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Murder suspect Vincent Sanchez unexpectedly took the stand in his own
defense Tuesday, telling prosecutors that the gun he used to
intimidate a woman he raped three years ago was his former roommate's
dart gun, not a handgun.</LD>
<LD>   Although his testimony was chilling at times, Sanchez's attorneys
hoped it would undercut prosecutors' argument that the 31-year-old
Simi Valley handyman, an admitted serial rapist, escalated from
assaults of women at knifepoint, to assaults at gunpoint, to
kidnapping, raping and killing Moorpark College student Megan Barroso
last summer using an AK-47 rifle.</LD>
<LD>   Sanchez has admitted to sexually assaulting seven women, some at
knifepoint. He also admitted shooting Barroso, whose bullet-riddled
car was found under a freeway overpass on July 5, 2001. But he has
denied kidnapping or trying to rape her, allegations that could make
him eligible for the death penalty rather than life behind bars.</LD>
<TE>   During a three-week preliminary hearing, expected to end today,
Chief Deputy Public Defender Neil Quinn has argued there is no link
between Barroso's death and Sanchez's assaults on other women. "This
establishes that he hadn't used a firearm ever in any of the rapes,"
Quinn said after his client testified Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors wanted to use the assault of a woman on May 4, 1999,
to suggest Sanchez was "out raping people with a firearm--and that's
not the reality," Quinn said. "We want to get people back to reality
here."</TE>
<TE>   Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Lela Henke-Dobroth and Senior Deputy
Dist. Atty. Dee Corona were permitted to cross-examine Sanchez only
on the 1999 assault with the dart gun.</TE>
<TE>   A slender, compact figure with a cropped mustache and goatee,
Sanchez, dressed in jail blues, at first sat hunched and spoke
softly. Under continued questioning by prosecutors, however, he sat
upright and answered in a forceful, matter-of-fact manner.</TE>
<TE>   He told prosecutors and Superior Court Judge Ken Riley that he
emptied the darts from the gun before heading to his victim's home,
partly so that he wouldn't injure her with the darts but also because
he wanted to avoid leaving a dart behind that might put police on his
trail.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want to have anything to link me to the crime," Sanchez
said.</TE>
<TE>   Asked why he used a dart gun rather than a knife, Sanchez
answered, "A gun is a lot more intimidating than a knife."</TE>
<TE>   "Your goal was to frighten her into submission, wasn't it?"
Henke-Dobroth asked.</TE>
<TE>   "That's exactly right," Sanchez responded.</TE>
<TE>   "An assault rifle would be very intimidating to anybody, wouldn't
it?" Henke-Dobroth pressed on, but Riley quickly shut down that line
of questioning.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez's lawyers called other witnesses to the stand Tuesday:</TE>
<TE>   * Simi Valley Police Officer Robert Arabian, who interviewed a
woman who alleged Sanchez chased her in his truck in October 2000.
The woman, identified only as Makala, testified earlier this month
that Sanchez tried to ram her car. During a taped interview in 2000,
she said only that Sanchez had chased her car and followed her
closely.</TE>
<TE>   Arabian said he never asked her specifically whether she thought
Sanchez wanted to ram her vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   * Joaquim Fernandez Jr., Sanchez's former neighbor, who testified
that he saw Sanchez drink eight to 10 beers just hours before Barroso
was shot. Fernandez said Sanchez did not appear drunk or despondent
when he left Fernandez's house about an hour before Barroso was
believed to have been killed.</TE>
<TE>   * Norm Fort, a forensic alcohol expert, who said Sanchez's blood

pattern of angry driving.</TE>

<HD>Church Sued for Abuser's Transfer</HD>
<DH>Scandal: Bishops sent to Orange County a priest with a
molestation history, suit alleges. Man says he and his brother became
the next victims.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Orange man filed suit Tuesday against the Roman Catholic Church,
alleging that two former bishops conspired to move a Milwaukee priest
who had molested boys there to Orange County, where he is accused of
sexually abusing more minors.In his lawsuit filed in Orange County
Superior Court, Eric Nathan Paino, 25, alleges that Father Sigfried
F. Widera molested him and his older brother in 1985 under the guise
of tucking the boys, then 8 and 7, into bed as a favor to their
single mother.</LD>
<LD>   Widera, who lives in Arizona, could not be reached for comment
Tuesday. He was stripped of his ability to function as a priest in
1986, shortly after Paino's mother complained to the diocese. He has
not been defrocked.</LD>
<LD>   Paino is one of the youngest victims to sue during the church's
4-month-old priest sex scandal.</LD>
<TE>   "The only reason I'm doing this is because this needs to be
stopped," said Paino, a truck driver.</TE>
<TE>   "Not just with Widera, but all other priests."</TE>
<TE>   Last month Paino filed a criminal report with Brea police, who
have jurisdiction over neighboring Yorba Linda, where the incidents
allegedly took place. A police spokesman said a preliminary
investigation determined that the statute of limitations has run out
on the 17-year-old case.</TE>
<TE>   Orange Bishop William Johnson accepted Widera into the diocese in
1976, despite a warning letter from Milwaukee Archbishop William
Cousins that the priest had a "moral problem having to do with a boy
in school." Both Johnson and Cousins are deceased.</TE>
<TE>   Since Widera's first Orange County accuser, an Anaheim man,
stepped forward last month, diocesan officials said four others have
contacted the church.</TE>
<TE>   In Milwaukee, Widera was convicted of sexual misconduct with an
adolescent boy in 1973 and sentenced to three years' probation. He
also was ordered by his archbishop to undergo counseling.</TE>
<TE>   Now police in a Milwaukee suburb are investigating allegations of
another sexual assault by Widera during the 1970s. The case will be
reviewed this week by the local district attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Orange officials said there was nothing in Widera's personnel file
about his criminal conviction, a statement corroborated by a priest
within the diocese at the time.</TE>
<TE>   The archbishop of Milwaukee "had told us [Widera] had gone through
counseling and was declared to be OK and safe," said Bishop of Boise
Michael Patrick Driscoll, who was an advisor to the bishop of Orange
in 1976. "That would never happen today. We were told that it would
not be a problem. I'm really sorry. ... It's a shame we put children
in Orange County at risk."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Milwaukee archdiocese said they hadn't seen
the suit and couldn't comment.</TE>
<TE>   Katherine K. Freberg, Paino's attorney, called Paino "the poster
boy to show why zero-tolerance [for molesting priests] is needed."</TE>
<TE>   Paino said Widera befriended his family, coming over for dinner,
swimming in the backyard pool, giving rides on his motorcycle and
handing out bags of candy that he kept in the trunk of his car.</TE>
<TE>   Paino said the molestations took place in the summer of 1985. He
said his mother remembered a dinner when her young son said, "I don't
want Father Widera tucking me in bed anymore."</TE>
<TE>   She asked why, and he replied, "I don't like the way he's touching
me." Paino's mother went to church officials, and soon afterward,
Widera was sent to New Mexico for more counseling.</TE>
<TE>   Paino's brother still is considering his legal options, said
Freberg.</TE>
<TE>   In his nine years with the Orange diocese, Widera was at five
parishes: St. Pius V Church in Buena Park, St. Justin Martyr Church
in Anaheim, St. Edward Church in Dana Point, Immaculate Heart of Mary
in Santa Ana, and St. Martin de Porres Church in Yorba Linda. The
Paino family attended services in Yorba Linda.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Unlike many lefties, Darren Oliver is flourishing at Fenway Park.</LD>
<LD>   Oliver (3-1) pitched his first shutout in more than two years, and
Nomar Garciaparra drove in two runs to lead the Boston Red Sox over
the Baltimore Orioles, 4-0, Tuesday night.</LD>
<LD>   "My defense was great," said Oliver, who hasn't given up a run in
two home starts. "What more can I say? It seemed like they made every
play possible tonight. They put the ball in play and the defense
really likes a pitcher who works quick, so they're not sitting around
in 40-degree weather."</LD>
<TE>   Light-hitting Rey Sanchez homered, his first home run in 1,094
at-bats since April 12, 2000, for Kansas City.</TE>
<TE>   Texas 10, Toronto 3--Alex Rodriguez hit his 250th career home run
for the Rangers in front of 12,571, the smallest crowd in the history
of Toronto's SkyDome.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez became the second-youngest player to reach the home-run
milestone, at 26 years, 277 days. Only Jimmie Foxx (26 years, 269
days) was younger.</TE>
<TE>   Texas' Rafael Palmeiro passed Carl Yastrzemski for 25th on the
career home run list with his 453rd.</TE>
<TE>   Kenny Rogers (3-0) gave up two runs and four hits in seven
innings.</TE>
<TE>   New York 8, Oakland 2--Ron Coomer hit a three-run homer that
capped a six-run first inning against Barry Zito in a game at Yankee
Stadium interrupted by rain for 1 hour 47 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   David Wells (4-0) gave up six hits in five innings.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 8, Seattle 4--Magglio Ordonez hit a two-run homer and the
White Sox ended the Mariners' 15-game road winning streak dating to
last season.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 6, Tampa Bay 3--Torii Hunter hit his ninth home run and
Kyle Lohse (2-1) pitched seven strong innings to carry the Twins at
Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 9, Kansas City 3--Steve Sparks (2-2) pitched a two-hitter
and Damian Jackson drove in four runs at Detroit to help the Tigers
spoil John Mizerock's debut as Royal manager.</TE>

<LD>Jason Allison played in the Kings' 4-0 Game 7 loss to the Colorado
Avalanche on Monday night at Denver despite a charley horse that
swelled the circumference of his right thigh by about 21/2 inches,
Coach Andy Murray said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "He's very rugged," Murray said of his top-line center, injured
Saturday when crunched into the boards by Avalanche defenseman Rob
Blake in Game 6. "Most players wouldn't have played [Monday]. Not
because they wouldn't have wanted to ... but they probably wouldn't
have been able to stand the pain."</LD>
<LD>   Murray said Allison tried on four pairs of pants as aides tried to
find equipment that would protect him.</LD>
<TE>   "We'd had witch doctors in there working on him, trying to get him
ready," the coach said. "I went up to him before the warmup and I
said, 'Jason, your health is the most important thing to me here.
This hockey game will pass. We don't want to do anything that
jeopardizes your health and if you don't feel comfortable doing this,
then make the right decision here ... because I know how tough you
are.'</TE>
<TE>   "And he kept saying, 'I'm going to play.' That's all he said."</TE>

<HD>Angels Run It Up in Rout of Indians</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Anaheim scores second-most runs in club history
and extends win streak to five with 21-2 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CLEVELAND</DL>
<LD>This is how ridiculously successful the Angels were Tuesday: Jeff
DaVanon set a career high by driving in four runs. He did not enter
the game until the eighth inning.</LD>
<LD>   "It was contagious," DaVanon said. "About anyone you could have
put in there tonight had a good chance of getting a hit."</LD>
<LD>   No kidding. The Angels cast aside a frustrating April in historic
fashion, scoring more runs than the team had in all but one of the
previous 6,536 games in club history. With 22 hits, including four
from Troy Glaus, and home runs from DaVanon, Glaus and Darin Erstad,
the Angels extended their winning streak to five games by
embarrassing the Cleveland Indians, 21-2.</LD>
<TE>   "It was pretty awesome, don't you think?" catcher Bengie Molina
said. "That was pretty nice. You always want to score a lot of runs,
but you never think about getting 20."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels scored more runs only once--24, against the Toronto
Blue Jays on Aug. 25, 1979, in a season in which Nolan Ryan, Don
Baylor and Bobby Grich wore the halo.</TE>
<TE>   A statistic to illustrate the Angels' dominance Tuesday? Pick one,
or all: The Angels scored in all but two innings. They scored 10 runs
in the eighth inning, three shy of the club record. The 22 hits were
four shy of the club record.</TE>
<TE>   Every starter scored. Every starter had at least one hit, except
Tim Salmon, who reached base three times on two walks and a hit by
pitch. Glaus drove in five runs.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time this season, the Angels hit three home runs.
Erstad hit his first homer of the season. So did DaVanon, who came
off the bench to homer in the eighth and single in the ninth. Orlando
Palmeiro came off the bench to pinch-run in the eighth and got to bat
before the inning ended.</TE>
<TE>   The clubhouse mood was not giddy.</TE>
<TE>   Said Garret Anderson: "Nobody's walking around in here with their
chests out."</TE>
<TE>   Said Erstad: "This is definitely an aberration."</TE>
<TE>   While the 21 runs might be an aberration, the Angels playing a
solid game is not, reinforcing the confidence that restrains one from
jumping for joy based on one spectacular night. Ramon Ortiz, the
Angels' most effective starter this season, held the Indians to one
run over eight innings and lowered his earned-run average to 2.55.</TE>
<TE>   During the five-game winning streak, the Angels' ERA is 2.54, and
the team batting average is .355. They have scored 54 runs in five
games, with at least 10 hits in each.</TE>
<TE>   Glaus is hitting .452 over his last seven games, Anderson .415
over his last 15 games, Molina .405 over his last 10. The Angels have
hit 10 home runs in their last 11 games.</TE>
<TE>   Amid a festival of boos at Jacobs Field--the Indians lost for the
12th time in 15 games, before a crowd of 24,286 that ranked as the
second-smallest in stadium history--the Angels scored the most runs
by an opponent in stadium history.</TE>
<TE>   It could be the shirt. Batting coach Mickey Hatcher wore his red
undershirt backward on the day the Angels started their streak. "I'm
backwards man," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But it could be the roster too. The Angels weathered the
suspensions of Glaus and Scott Spiezio, the disabled-list stint of
closer Troy Percival and the concussion-related absence of Erstad,
and now the crisis atmosphere that surrounded the poor start has
evaporated.</TE>
<TE>   April is over. One week ago, the Angels awoke 101/2 games out of
first place. Today, they're 61/2 out, with the longest active winning
streak in the league. They're 11-14, and the season is far from lost.</TE>
<TE>   "It's 180 degrees from where we were last week at this time,"
Manager Mike Scioscia said. "We really have just gotten our full club
together, after suspensions, injuries, concussions, whatever.
Hopefully, we can move forward from here."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<TE>   Run Around</TE>
<TE>   Though a healthy total, the Angels' 21 runs Tuesday was not even a
club record for one game. Here are the top league and club scoring
efforts:</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Wise Could Give Relief to Team</HD>

<DL>CLEVELAND</DL>
<LD>The Angels have groomed Matt Wise as a starting pitcher, but he could
find a home in the bullpen. Wise joined the team Tuesday, replacing
injured reliever Donne Wall.</LD>
<LD>   While Wise still serves as an insurance policy should a starter
get hurt, he also could carve a niche for himself as a middle
reliever.</LD>
<LD>   "There comes a time when a guy needs the litmus test of pitching
in the big leagues. I think Matt is at that point," Manager Mike
Scioscia said. "Hopefully, he'll pitch well enough to stay."</LD>
<TE>   Wise, 26, in his sixth pro season, had a 1.13 earned-run average
in three starts at triple-A Salt Lake, striking out 25 and walking
four in 16 innings.</TE>
<TE>   He also lost 10 pounds after a bout with food poisoning that left
him sick for five days last week.</TE>
<TE>   "I was skinny before," he said. "Now I'm withering away."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Leadoff hitter David Eckstein said his phone has been "ringing off
the hook" since Sunday, with family, friends and long-lost
acquaintances congratulating him on his grand slams Saturday and
Sunday. Eckstein, who never had hit a grand slam in the major or
minor leagues, became the first player in major league history to hit
his first two slams in consecutive games.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's slam ended a 14-inning game, his first-ever walkoff
homer.</TE>
<TE>   Eckstein insists he will not be seduced by the long ball. He took
extra batting practice Tuesday, frustrated by hitting too many fly
balls for a little guy.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't keep doing that," he said. "All those balls are going to
be caught if I'm not perfectly timing everything."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels remain in search of a right-handed hitter, but General
Manager Bill Stoneman said no player acquisitions are imminent on
that front, or any other.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels are interested in Wil Cordero, assuming he clears
waivers Thursday and is available at the minimum wage.</TE>
<TE>   They would insist that Cordero, released by the Cleveland Indians
after 18 at-bats, accept a minor league assignment to get his bat
into shape. It also is uncertain whether Disney would approve
Cordero, who pleaded guilty on four counts of felony spousal abuse in
1997.</TE>
<TE>   The Texas Rangers have made outfielder Gabe Kapler available in
trade, and his .320 average against left-handers this season makes
him interesting to the Angels. His salaries of $1.85 million this
year and $3.25 million next year make him less interesting.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For the first time in major league history, four managers were
fired in April. While the Angels are off to a poor start, Scioscia's
job is not in immediate danger.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels (11-14) signed him to a three-year contract extension
last summer and their attendance is up slightly; the four clubs that
fired managers have losing records and dramatically declining
attendance.</TE>
<TE>   Still, in the wake of Monday's firing of Tony Muser by the Kansas
City Royals, an ESPN online poll Tuesday asked readers to predict the
next manager to be fired, with choices of Scioscia, Don Baylor of the
Chicago Cubs, Larry Bowa of the Philadelphia Phillies and Buck
Martinez of the Toronto Blue Jays.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line in this position is winning," Scioscia said
before the Angels extended their win streak to five games. "We all
know that. We accept that responsibility. It's not an issue here,
because it has absolutely no impact on what our staff will do."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Before Jerry West became president of the Memphis Grizzlies, Skip
Bayless of the San Jose Mercury News was lobbying for West to assume
a similar position with the Golden State Warriors.</LD>
<LD>   But Bayless doubted that Warrior owner Chris Cohan would hire West
because it would be an admission of "weakness and failure," writing:
"For Warriors' fans, Cohan is a triple-double of a worst nightmare.
He consistently reaches double figures for being stubborn, cheap and
NBA dumb."</LD>
<LD>   Don't hold back, Skip. What do you really think?</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the NBA playoff record for most steals in a
game?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Free and easy: Sam Smith of the Chicago Tribune, commenting on the
Dallas Mavericks: "[Dallas] has been unusually efficient despite its
wide-open style. The Mavericks led the league in scoring--and are
doing it again in the playoffs--while setting an NBA regular-season
record for fewest turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   "Explained Nick Van Exel: 'We don't pass the ball. Whoever gets
the ball shoots it.'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Was it a yacht? Cincinnati Red pitcher Jose Rijo, after receiving
a congratulatory telegram from Dr. James Andrews, who performed five
elbow surgeries on him: "He made enough money off me to buy a boat;
he better be happy for me."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No delay: TNT broadcaster Ernie Johnson, on colleague Charles
Barkley: "If a thought makes its way into Chuck's head, it's gonna
make its way out of his mouth."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sugar-coating: Maverick Coach Don Nelson commenting on the recent
series with the Minnesota Timberwolves: "Just because it was a 3-0
series sweep, people will look at it and think it was easy. I don't
look at it that way. It was a heck of a series. I love their team ...
the way they play ... how hard they play. And this series could have
very easily gone the other way."</TE>
<TE>   Bob Sansevere of the St. Paul Pioneer Press didn't buy Nelson's
appraisal, saying, "He was either being way too kind or lying through
his molars."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A toss-up: Jerry Greene in the Orlando Sentinel: "Pat Forde of the
Louisville Courier-Journal notes that famously devout jockey Pat Day
will be riding a horse named Buddha in the Kentucky Derby. Pat
wonders if they win, will Pat 'thank God, then thank Buddha?'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1997, Seattle (33) and Phoenix (30)
set an NBA playoff record for most three-point field-goal attempts by
both teams (63) in a game. It went to overtime.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Allen Iverson of Philadelphia, 10, against Orlando
on May 13, 1999.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Tom FitzGerald in the San Francisco Chronicle:
"Arizona outfielder Luis Gonzalez goes through 30 pieces of bubble
gum a game, according to the Palm Beach [Fla.] Post, but is careful
not to leave any on the field after his discarded wad sparked a weird
collectibles controversy last month.</TE>
<TE>   "If you think 30 pieces is a lot, you should know that Florida
Marlin pitcher John Beckett once crammed that many pieces of bubble
gum into his mouth at one time, only to have teammate Ryan Dempster
obliterate his record last year with 48."</TE>
<TE>   Oh well, better bubble gum than chewing tobacco.</TE>

<LD>   What: "The Rookie"</LD>
<LD>   Authors: Jim Morris and Joel Engel.</LD>
<TE>   Publisher: Warner Books.</TE>
<TE>   Price: $13.95.</TE>
<TE>   The movie "The Rookie," starring Dennis Quaid as former Tampa Bay
Devil Ray pitcher Jim Morris, tells some of how Morris became a major
league rookie at 35. But there are holes and inaccuracies, which is
usually the case when Hollywood tries to tell a true story.</TE>
<TE>   The book originally was published as "The Oldest Rookie," which
technically wasn't accurate. The title of the book, now in paperback,
is now the same as the movie's. The book fills in many of the holes
left by the movie and clears up some inaccuracies.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, the book tells of Morris' high school days in
Brownwood, Texas, and explains how he ended up coaching high school
baseball in Big Lake, Texas. All that is left out of the movie.</TE>
<TE>   The movie opens with St. Rita, "the patron saint of impossible
dreams" having smiled on Big Lake. There's nothing like that in the
book. Brownwood is a big part of the book. It gets no mention in the
movie.</TE>
<TE>   The movie plays up Morris' strained relationship with his father,
then gets syrupy and sappy at the end. In the book, Morris'
relationship with his father is not a major subplot.</TE>
<TE>   Morris has said that Quaid captured his personality perfectly.
It's just too bad that Walt Disney Pictures, which produced the
movie, wasn't as perfect in telling the story. That's left up to the
written word.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Stewart</TE>

<TE>   Because the NHL playoff series between the New York Islanders and
Toronto Maple Leafs was extended to a seventh game, the
"SportsCentury" profile on Oscar De La Hoya, scheduled to be shown
Tuesday at 4:30 p.m. on ESPN, was preempted. It will be shown at a
date to be determined.</TE>

<DH>Horse racing: Owner and trainer of Harlan's Holiday go to
great lengths to change luck.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LOUISVILLE, Ky.</DL>
<LD>Harlan's Holiday runs with a 15-year-old four-leaf clover in his
saddlecloth. His trainer, who otherwise seems like a rational man,
once ended a losing streak by digging a hole and burying some chicken
bones.</LD>
<LD>   So is it any wonder that the least of Harlan's Holiday's curses,
going into Saturday's 128th Kentucky Derby, is that he was bred in
Ohio?</LD>
<LD>   Only one Ohio-bred--Wintergreen in 1909--has ever won the Derby,
and perhaps there's been no encore from Buckeye state horses because
their trainers didn't have a lucky clover like Jack Wolf's, or a
hex-chaser like Ken McPeek's.</LD>
<TE>   Wolf, the Louisville-born owner of a money-management firm in
Atlanta, races Harlan's Holiday, a $97,000 yearling purchase, with
his wife Laurie. Wolf, turning 53 on Derby day, was given the
four-leaf clover by his son Bryan 15 years ago. Wolf carried it in
his wallet, but then this winter, after Harlan's Holiday had lost two
consecutive races for the first time, a couple of things happened:
McPeek replaced Tony D'Amico with Edgar Prado, a more experienced
big-race jockey, and Harlan's Holiday began running with the well
preserved clover. He hasn't lost since.</TE>
<TE>   Booklet, who had beaten Wolf's horse twice, was up the track both
times as Harlan's Holiday won the Florida Derby at Gulfstream Park
and the Blue Grass Stakes at Keeneland. Only three horses have won
those two prep races and the Kentucky Derby, none since Spectacular
Bid in 1979.</TE>
<TE>   McPeek, 39, was running a modest stable until his breakout horse,
Tejano Run, finished second to Thunder Gulch in the 1995 Derby. Asked
about the pressures of training Harlan's Holiday, this year's Derby
favorite, McPeek says, "That's not pressure. This is pressure: Having
15 bad horses in the dead of winter at Turfway Park, having some
owners who haven't paid their bills, and having some stablehands
waiting on payday for their money. Compared to that, this is gravy."</TE>
<TE>   In New Orleans in the early 1990s, McPeek's clients might not have
been deadbeats, but he was still having trouble paying bills, because
every horse in the barn had a severe case of the slows. McPeek ended
the meet by losing 20 straight races, and back home at Turfway, in
Florence, Ky., the streak went past 30.</TE>
<TE>   Bernie Flint, another trainer, told McPeek that he might be
cursed. After all, they had visited Louisiana's famous St. Louis
cemetery during the Fair Grounds meet, and neglected to perform the
hoary ritual at Marie Laveau's tomb.</TE>
<TE>   In the 19th century, Laveau was known as the "voodoo queen" of New
Orleans, and claimed that she would go on forever. Casual historians
might have actually believed her, until they realized that her
daughter and a granddaughter both were named Marie Laveau too.</TE>
<TE>   At the above-ground site of what is believed to be the original
Marie Laveau's grave, there are instructions to take your right foot
and make three Xs in the dirt nearby. According to the legend, the
spirit of Madame Marie considers anything less a snub. Violators are
subject to an evil spell.</TE>
<TE>   "Bernie said Marie had put a gris-gris on me," McPeek said. "He
said that was the reason I was losing all those races."</TE>
<TE>   They weren't in New Orleans so they couldn't go back to the tomb
and make the triple Xs. Flint suggested that McPeek dig a hole and
bury the picked-over chicken bones.</TE>
<TE>   "I did," McPeek said, "and I won a race the next day to end the
streak. Then I won something like eight out of the next 12 races."</TE>
<TE>   With a wry smile, McPeek told this bizarre tale outside his barn
at Churchill Downs on Tuesday morning, shortly after Harlan's
Holiday, with Prado aboard, had worked half a mile in 493/5 seconds.
Monday's wintry conditions had changed to bright sunshine, and the
temperature was up about 20 degrees. Louisville can sometimes go
through all four seasons during Derby week, but the weather gods are
usually on the side of Churchill Downs on the big day. Saturday is
expected to be pleasant and dry, with a fast track.</TE>
<TE>   Those who know McPeek will vouch for his veracity. Maybe in
another life, he could launch a career writing short stories. The
relevant thing here is that early this year he converted Harlan's
Holiday from a speed-crazy, run-off colt into a horse who relaxes by
running just off the pace. Ideally for McPeek--and in a 20-horse
field like Saturday's, the whole race scenario is an educated guess
not likely to happen--Harlan's Holiday will be third or fourth at the
quarter pole, within two lengths of the front and ready to pounce on
the leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Almost 20 years ago, McPeek took a degree in business
administration from the University of Kentucky and, after considering
a career as a stockbroker, went to work as a hotwalker--the
racetrack's bottom-rung job--for trainer Shug McGaughey at Keeneland.
McPeek's father had bred horses and McPeek spent almost as much time
in college studying thoroughbred pedigrees as he did his regular
courses.</TE>
<TE>   McPeek wanted to apply for the same lowly job at trainer Wayne
Lukas' barn, but Lukas hadn't yet shipped in his horses from
California. The work with McGaughey--who's running Saarland in this
Derby--put McPeek at the poverty level. He was behind on his rent,
and had trouble making a $121 monthly car payment.</TE>
<TE>   Although McGaughey suggested that he find another job, McPeek
persevered. He took out his trainer's license in 1985, caring for a
few horses owned by his father, and a few years later Roy Monroe,
whose son had played high-school football with McPeek, asked the
trainer to attend auctions and buy some horses. All that pedigree
research was finally going to pay off. Monroe owned Tejano Run.</TE>
<TE>   McPeek plays playground basketball now, to his recent chagrin.</TE>
<TE>   On a wet court, he broke a bone in his left foot the week after
the Blue Grass and has been running the operation on crutches, moving
back and forth to the track in a golf cart.</TE>
<TE>   But he still considers all this gravy. After all, the Kentucky
Derby is only three days away.</TE>
<TE>   McPeek will run Take Charge Lady, the 2-1 favorite, in Friday's
$564,600 Kentucky Oaks for 3-year-old fillies at Churchill Downs. The
10-horse field, in post-position order: Farda Amiga, Habibti, Take
The Cake, You, Ms. Brookski, Bella Bellucci, Imperial Gesture, Art
Fair, Take Charge Lady and Ile de France.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday Break, the third-place finisher in the Wood Memorial, will
be hard-pressed to squeeze into the Derby, because he is not among
the first 20 horses in graded stakes earnings.</TE>

<HD>Westrope Joins Stars in the Hall</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LOUISVILLE, Ky.</DL>
<LD>The elections of Cigar and Serena's Song were givens, and the tapping
of trainer Bud Delp, instead of Sonny Hine, caused only a small
ripple.</LD>
<LD>   But when the name of the late jockey, Jack Westrope, was called
out Tuesday at the annual announcement by the Racing Hall of Fame,
the day brought one real surprise. Dead for 44 years, Westrope had
been on the ballot several times, never generating enough support.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday at Churchill Downs, however, the fiery Westrope
posthumously achieved what his family, fellow riders and supporters
had sought. Few of the 140 voters had ever seen Westrope ride, yet
his record enabled him to outpoint Eddie Maple and Kent Desormeaux,
who were on the ballot for the first time.</LD>
<TE>   Besides Cigar and Serena's Song, the other winner, in the horse of
yesteryear category, was Noor, who beat Citation, a shell of himself,
four times at California tracks in 1950.</TE>
<TE>   For years, Westrope's record had been misinterpreted by Hall of
Fame voters. He won 2,467 races, an unimpressive total these days,
but he competed in an era before year-round racing and nine-race
cards.</TE>

<HD>Brown's Return Is Spoiled</HD>
<DH>Dodgers: He pitches five innings but loses when offense
provides little support in 3-1 victory by Reds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This was not vintage Kevin Brown on the Dodger Stadium mound Tuesday
night. Four batters into his return from the disabled list, the
Dodger ace left a two-strike fastball over the plate to Adam Dunn,
who belted it for a two-run home run to catapult the Cincinnati Reds
toward a 3-1 victory before a crowd of 25,178.</LD>
<LD>   Brown nearly fell off the mound when the spikes on his landing
foot got caught in the dirt on a second-inning pitch. He threw wild
past first base on a fourth-inning pick-off attempt for a two-base
error.</LD>
<LD>   Brown escaped first-and-third jams in the third and fourth
innings, but he struggled with his command throughout much of his
five-inning, 84-pitch stint, giving up two runs on five hits,
striking out five and walking one.</LD>
<TE>   There was no discomfort in Brown's surgically repaired right
elbow, no lingering effects from the tearing of scar tissue that
knocked him out of his last start in the second inning of an April 13
game at San Diego, and for that the Dodgers and Brown were thankful.</TE>
<TE>   But it will likely take a few more starts before the power pitcher
returns to the dominant form that Brown and the Dodgers expect.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't put a timetable on when I'll have my good rhythm," Brown
said. "You do everything you can to shorten that period, but you have
no idea when it will happen. It might be my next pitch. That might be
the pitch that puts it all together."</TE>
<TE>   It certainly wasn't that 0-2 pitch to Dunn in the first inning
Tuesday night, a ball that landed in the left-field pavilion and gave
Dunn home runs in three consecutive at-bats, the first Reds' player
to accomplish that feat since Bret Boone's three-homer game against
the Chicago Cubs in Wrigley Field on Sept. 28, 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "I left a fastball over the plate--that's not a good pitch with an
0-2 count," Brown said. "If I made a better pitch in that situation,
it would have made a difference."</TE>
<TE>   That's because Red starter Chris Reitsma left Brown virtually no
room for error. The right-hander used a devastating changeup to
thwart several potential rallies and allowed only one run on eight
hits in six innings to an offense that had produced 35 runs in six
games on a trip to Pittsburgh and Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   That enabled the surprising Reds, who are atop the National League
Central division, to win for the seventh time in their last nine
games in Dodger Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "His big pitch is a changeup, and he continued to go to it when he
was behind in the count," Manager Jim Tracy said of Reitsma. "It was
very apparent when he's in trouble that the changeup is the pitch he
was going to, and we couldn't do anything with it. We swung as if we
were still anticipating a fastball."</TE>
<TE>   Reitsma, in his second big league season, struck out Brian Jordan
on a changeup to end the first inning with runners on second and
third. Right fielder Austin Kearns bailed Reitsma out of trouble in
the second when he raced into the gap and made a spectacular diving
catch of Dave Roberts' drive to end the inning with runners on first
and third.</TE>
<TE>   Reitsma struck out Shawn Green with a nice changeup in the third,
and he minimized damage in the fifth when he gave up only one run
after the Dodgers loaded the bases with no outs on Alex Cora's
pinch-hit double and singles by Dave Roberts and Cesar Izturis.</TE>
<TE>   But Paul Lo Duca bounced into a 4-6-3 double play, Cora scoring to
pull the Dodgers within 2-1, and Green flied to left. The Dodgers
also had two on with two out in the sixth, but Reitsma struck out
pinch-hitter Hiram Bocachica on a changeup.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a finesse pitcher, he doesn't want to come at you much, but
he throws that pitch well, he throws it for strikes, and he throws it
out of the zone when he wants to," Dodger second baseman Mark
Grudzielanek said. "When you have something like that, you stick with
it."</TE>
<TE>   The Reds added an insurance run in the ninth when Todd Walker
walked and reliever Giovanni Carrara drilled Kearns in the helmet
with a fastball. Kearns, who was pulled for a pinch-runner, suffered
a cut on his forehead and had a severe headache, and he will undergo
tests today.</TE>
<TE>   Catcher Corky Miller was then hit by a pitch to load the bases,
the 118th time the Reds' catcher has been hit by a pitch in 380
professional games, and Wilton Guerrero hit a bloop RBI single to
right for a 3-1 lead. Red closer Danny Graves pitched a scoreless
ninth.</TE>

<HD>Nomo's Walks Lead to Runs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Japanese right-hander Hideo Nomo has a superb 2.35 earned-run
average, he has given up only eight earned runs on 21 hits in 302/3
innings, and if the Dodgers had scored more than 10 runs in his five
starts, his record could be 4-1 instead of 2-3 entering tonight's
game against the Reds.</LD>
<LD>   But the Dodgers think he can be even better. Nomo has walked 15
and hit a batter in his three losses, including five walks and a hit
batter in Thursday's 3-2 loss to Pittsburgh. Pitching Coach Jim
Colborn would like Nomo to challenge batters more.</LD>
<LD>   "I'd like to see him change, even if it means sacrificing three
solo home runs," Colborn said. "Last Thursday, two of the three guys
who scored off him walked, and another guy who scored was hit by a
pitch.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm a little hesitant to tinker with a guy who's had success, but
we'd like him to consider challenging guys more and see what happens,
because there's a history of real successful pitchers--Jim "Catfish"
Hunter, Ferguson Jenkins, Bert Blyleven, Curt Schilling--who have
given up a lot of home runs."</TE>
<TE>   Walks and high pitch counts are common for Nomo, who has averaged
87 walks a season the past three years. Nomo has focused on throwing
first-pitch strikes this season--with mixed results--but in a meeting
with Colborn last weekend in Chicago, the coach told Nomo to be more
aggressive throughout the count.</TE>
<TE>   "He seemed to be receptive to it," Colborn said. "I don't know if
he can change his style, and we may just have what we have. He's a
plus pitcher, a guy you can envision on a championship-caliber team,
but if there's a way to make him better, we're going to explore it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   To make room for Kevin Brown on the roster Tuesday night, the
Dodgers optioned reliever Guillermo Mota to triple-A Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Colborn overhauled Mota's delivery after the Dodgers acquired the
right-hander from Montreal in the Matt Herges trade in spring
training, and there were immediate results: Mota threw scoreless
innings against San Diego on April 21 and Pittsburgh on April 24, and
his fastball was clocked at 98 mph.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers project Mota as a potential closer, and Mota has the
fastball to do it, but he needs better movement on the pitch and more
command of his off-speed pitches before he will be considered for a
full-time big league bullpen spot.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dodger players and coaches will take part in the 44th annual Los
Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce "Opening Pitch" luncheon from 11
a.m.-1:30 p.m. on Thursday at the Westin Bonaventure. Reservations
for individuals ($80) and tables of 10 ($800) can be made by calling
(213) 580-7585.</TE>

<TE>   Update--Hamilton appears to have regained his form after
struggling because of shoulder problems that required surgery in
September, 1999. The right-hander, who has an 8-2 record and 2.48 ERA
in 15 career appearances against the Dodgers, could be 3-1 this
season if not for the Reds bullpen blowing saves in his first two
starts. The Dodgers are the only team in the National League ranking
in the top five in batting (third), pitching (second) and fielding
percentage (second).</TE>

<LD>Some bettors skipped the pick six on Sunday, even with the $1-million
guaranteed pool, thinking it was too difficult to isolate the winners
of races 5-10 on the California Gold Rush program.</LD>
<LD>   Thanks primarily to shockers by Ladylore ($65.40) in the Melair
and Affairintheforest ($50.40) in the Big Jag, those same players are
smiling now. Those upsets, plus another by Bear Fan ($23.60) in the
Gourmet Girl, meant there were no perfect tickets in the pick six, so
there is a carry-over of $683,636 for this afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   There will be a massive pool--probably more than $3 million--and a
lot of attention will be paid to the final six races on the first day
of Hollywood Park's second week.</LD>
<TE>   There definitely is variety in the sequence.</TE>
<TE>   The third is a $10,000 claimer for veteran sprinters; the fourth
is a claimer for 2-year-olds; the fifth is a starter allowance at
11/2 miles on the turf; the sixth is a $50,000 maiden claimer; the
seventh is an optional claimer at 71/2 furlongs, and the eighth is a
$32,000 maiden claimer.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Sumati could be a legitimate single in the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Craig Dollase. The trainer won with three of his four
starters during the opening week.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Kevin Mangold. The apprentice jockey went 0 for 3 last
week and is 0 for 49 this year.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: On a day like this, a pick six is the only
possible exotic play, so let's play a $36 ticket using Mr. Reed,
Scoop Of Ice and Jack's Ole' in the third; Maui Wish and Appealing
Wayz in the fourth, single Sumati in the fifth, single Seven Charms
in the sixth, use Futural, Radiata and Lethal Instrument in the
seventh, and single Further in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 2/10. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $10.40/$45.40. Total money bet: $86.</TE>

<HD>Poor Start Led to an Early Playoff Stop</HD>
<DH>Analysis: Kings' slump at season's beginning cost them
home-ice advantage in first round.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There was nothing wrong with the Kings this season that a calendar
couldn't have helped fix. The season started in October, not
December.</LD>
<LD>   Two months into the season the Kings had dug themselves so deep
that they weren't able to nail down a playoff berth until less than
48 hours remained in the regular season, even though their 32-13-7-2
record over the final four months was the league's best.</LD>
<LD>   It should not have been necessary for the Kings to unseat the
defending Stanley Cup champion in order to advance beyond the first
round of the playoffs.</LD>
<TE>   They were better than that.</TE>
<TE>   If they'd won only two more games in the season's first two
months--over, say, the Tampa Bay Lightning, Florida Panthers,
Washington Capitals, Dallas Stars or Minnesota Wild, all of whom
missed the playoffs but were a combined 6-0 against the Kings in
October--they would have won the Pacific Division and earned home-ice
advantage in the opening round.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, they had to play the Colorado Avalanche, which enjoyed
enough of an edge over the Kings (Patrick Roy, the return of Peter
Forsberg, etc.) without the added benefit of playing Game 7 in
Denver, where it won Monday night, 4-0.</TE>
<TE>   Another King season ended in disappointment as much because of the
way it started as the way it finished.</TE>
<TE>   It was asking an awful lot of the Kings to defeat the Avalanche on
the road in Game 7, especially with Adam Deadmarsh and Philippe
Boucher sidelined because of injuries and Jason Allison severely
limited because of a charley horse. But was even one goal in two
October games against the Lightning too much to ask?</TE>
<TE>   All in all, though, it was an encouraging season for the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   Their special teams were brilliant, leading the league in
power-play efficiency and ranking third in penalty killing, and their
defensive corps solid. Their 2.29 goals-against average was the best
in club history. Goaltender Felix Potvin set a club record by playing
in 71 games, matched a career high with six shutouts and posted a
2.31 goals-against average, the lowest of his career.</TE>
<TE>   It undoubtedly hurt worse to get bumped from the playoffs after
one round than to have reached the Western Conference semifinals last
season, but the Kings probably have a more talented nucleus in place
than they did a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Allison, acquired in an October trade with the Boston Bruins, was
billed as a franchise player, and the rugged center more than
delivered.</TE>
<TE>   The only problem, in the short term anyway, was that the Kings had
to give up two top-six forwards, Glen Murray and Jozef Stumpel, to
obtain Allison, and they never really filled the void.</TE>
<TE>   With Bryan Smolinski and Steve Heinze slumping through the second
half of the season and trading-deadline acquisition Cliff Ronning
never heating up, the Kings' only consistent threats were Allison,
Deadmarsh and Ziggy Palffy.</TE>
<TE>   Still, "I'd say the big picture overall for our organization is
better," General Manager Dave Taylor said Tuesday, citing the Kings'
improved defensive play and the tremendous upside of the 26-year-old
Allison. "I think we've got a solid core of guys that will be
returning next year and we have a number of what we think are quality
prospects in an area where we need help--offensive-minded forwards."</TE>
<TE>   Several unrestricted free-agent forwards are expected to be on the
market July 1, among them Bill Guerin of the Boston Bruins and Teemu
Selanne of the San Jose Sharks, but the Kings seem more interested in
building from within.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we'll look at every option," Taylor said, "but we'll have
to work within our budget. People shouldn't expect that our payroll
is going to jump to $60 million [from about $42 million], but I don't
anticipate it will go backwards."</TE>
<TE>   Four Kings--Boucher, Potvin, Ronning and Kelly Buchberger--are
potential unrestricted free agents, with the club holding options on
Potvin and Ronning that must be picked up by June 30.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, of course, will pick up the $3.3-million option on
Potvin, unless they can reach agreement on a longer-term deal. But
Taylor said they have not yet determined whether they will pick up
the $1.85-million option on Ronning, who will turn 37 Oct. 1, or try
to re-sign Buchberger, who will be 36 Dec. 2.</TE>
<TE>   Boucher, 29, will be eligible for unrestricted free agency because
he has played in the NHL for 10 seasons and, at $582,038 this season,
is paid less than the league average, which this season was about
$1.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't talked with his agent yet, but we would like to bring
Bouch back," Taylor said. "He had a very good year for us, but he's
really in the driver's seat. If he says that he wants to wait until
July 1 to see what the market will bear, that's his option. But if
there's a deal that makes sense, we'd like to bring him back."</TE>
<TE>   Said Boucher: "I've still got to sit down with my agent and look
at all the possibilities. I've loved L.A., had a good time playing
here....</TE>
<TE>   "But obviously you might want to see what's out there."</TE>
<TE>   Among the Kings' potential Group II, or restricted, free agents
are backup goaltender Jamie Storr and forwards Brad Chartrand, Mikko
Eloranta, Eric Belanger, Jaroslav Bednar, Adam Mair and Steve Kelly.
The Kings would have the right to match any offer made to a
restricted free agent or accept draft picks as compensation.</TE>

<LD>Robert Horry and the Lakers were back at work at their practice
facility Tuesday, their swagger a little stronger, their gait a
little more gamely as the Trail Blazers receded further into the
past.</LD>
<LD>   But not without more discussion about Horry's series-clinching
shot, and its genesis a few feet from the maelstrom being generated
by the Portland bench.</LD>
<LD>   Comfortable as he is in the corner, Horry might have found the
other side of the Rose Garden much more desirable as he squared up
and released the winning three-pointer on Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   The Trail Blazers were standing. They were screaming. They all but
spilled onto the court when it became apparent that Scottie Pippen
couldn't get back to cover Horry in time.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, there was the distraction created by guard Damon
Stoudamire, who stood a couple feet from Horry and whipped a white
towel in his general direction.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw that in the video, how he was yelling and stomping," Horry
said. "I didn't hear anybody behind me. I was just playing
basketball. A lot of times, you don't hear any of the crowd while
you're playing. I didn't hear them or feel them."</TE>
<TE>   Horry didn't exactly stay awake all night Sunday, visions of the
winning shot swirling in his head, mindful that the Lakers needed
eight points in the final 33 seconds to escape with victory.</TE>
<TE>   "That's not anything to get happy about," Horry said. "That's just
the first round. That's what we were supposed to do. We had the
[higher] seed and we were supposed to win."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers brushed aside the Trail Blazers last year as if they
were a minor disturbance, sweeping the first-round series by an
average of 14.7 points a game.</TE>
<TE>   This year was different: The Lakers' three victories came by an
average of 3.3 points, and if Horry had missed, they'd be playing a
fourth game tonight.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we're as good a team right now as we were last
year, but that doesn't matter," Coach Phil Jackson said. "I think we
can grow into that within a week's time if we start putting some
things together."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said the week off until the start of the second round on
Sunday should allow forward Samaki Walker time to heal. Walker has a
bone bruise on the outside of his left knee.</TE>
<TE>   "That's one of the reasons why this is a good break for us,"
Jackson said. "With a bone bruise, it takes a while, maybe three or
four days. Maybe Friday he can get back on the court, maybe Thursday
if everything works out. It's a good opportunity for him to recover,
maybe play some shorter minutes to start with and then as the series
goes on, pick it up."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said he was displeased that Trail Blazer center Dale Davis
twice kicked Rick Fox in the head while Fox was on his back under the
basket late in Sunday's game.</TE>
<TE>   Neither kick was full force, the second with Davis' heel, but
Jackson was irked nonetheless.</TE>
<TE>   "Today when we ran back the tape, there should have been a call
there," Jackson said. "The league should do something about it,
there's absolutely no doubt about it."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he had voiced his grievances with the league office,
Jackson said, "I'm not a tattle-taler. If they can't pick up that
stuff, then they're not doing their job."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Seattle or San Antonio? To Jackson, it doesn't seem to matter who
plays the Lakers in the second round.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a record of 3-1 against both of them during this year so
we feel relatively confident that we can win this series," Jackson
said.</TE>

<KH>JERRY WEST LEAVES THE LAKERS</KH>
<HD>Memphis' Clutch Move</HD>
<DH>With Kupchak Firmly in Command, Team Ready to Absorb Loss</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jerry West is gone for good--that's twice now, in two years--and the
fact is, Mitch Kupchak's professional life won't change at all.</LD>
<LD>   Kupchak has managed the Lakers' basketball operations since the
day West could no longer stand it, since the day he walked exhausted
and tortured from the job he held and tried to love for 17 years.</LD>
<LD>   After slipping into and out of basketball arenas for the better
part of half-a-year, West emerged Tuesday afternoon at a podium in
Memphis, Tenn., where he was named president of Michael Heisley's
Grizzlies, a job that promises to be thankless well into West's
multiyear contract.</LD>
<TE>   That means West may no longer serve the Lakers' organization as a
consultant, a part-time job that brought him an annual salary of $1
million. And that means Kupchak may no longer sit beside West in a
gym in Portsmouth, Va., and openly discuss which player would earn
the right to come to Los Angeles and sit at the end of Phil Jackson's
bench for three years.</TE>
<TE>   That seems a minor adjustment to a relationship built over more
than two decades.</TE>
<TE>   "Two years ago, our relationship changed, because I didn't get to
work with a person I worked with on a daily basis for 14 years,"
Kupchak said. "Today, once again, our relationship changes to a
degree. As far as being a confidante, I'm not sure how much I can
share with him regarding Laker basketball anymore. It was something I
felt comfortable doing for many, many years. On a personal level, the
last two years, as you know he didn't have an office. He came in once
a month [or so] to pick up his mail. There were times when we spoke
twice a week and times we didn't speak for three or four weeks. In
fact, a lot of the deals we've done he didn't know about, or was out
of the country when we did them. So, we functioned for two years
really without Jerry being intimately involved.</TE>
<TE>   "He was never put in a position of, 'What would you do if...?' It
was clearly, 'What do you think of this player? What do you think of
that player?' The feeling was, personally, that decisions were not
something he wanted to get involved with. That's kind of what drove
him to the point where he felt he had to retire. That's the toughest
part of this job, making decisions. And, it's a public decision.
That's really what drove him to the point where he thought he had to
get out."</TE>
<TE>   Kupchak reveres West as a basketball man, as an evaluator and seer
and projector of talent, both young and mature. But, while West was
highly valued and, as one executive said this week, thought of as
"royalty" in an organization whose color is gold, no one's knees
buckled on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "Mitch can absolutely handle the business that's going on with
this ballclub," said Kurt Rambis, Kupchak's assistant until joining
Jackson's staff this season. "It doesn't cripple the organization.
It's a loss. [West] was a sounding board. [But] he's left the
organization in a pretty good situation. There's some good
ballplayers here right now. The crippling aspect will come when Shaq
decides to retire.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever the perception was about Jerry, Mitch has been running
things."</TE>
<TE>   Said Jackson: "Jerry wasn't a presence around us. He hasn't been
around for two years, literally [since] when he retired two summers
ago. He rode on the team plane one time last year. He's never been at
a practice situation, and he's never come down to the locker room. We
know that he's at games occasionally ... [but] his direct influence
has really not been there since he retired."</TE>
<TE>   When West decided it was time he returned to the game, the Lakers
did not attempt to create a position for him, and he did not ask.
West spoke at length recently with team owner Dr. Jerry Buss, at the
end of which Buss let him out of his contract. That was all.</TE>
<TE>   "Actually," Buss said, "he hasn't done a great deal in the last
couple of years for the Lakers."</TE>
<TE>   Besides, whatever it was that West left Bel Air for, the Lakers
probably could not provide it. For as long as Shaquille O'Neal and
Kobe Bryant are healthy and interested, the Lakers' summers will be
tune-up jobs and exercises in salary-cap management.</TE>
<TE>   "If you know Jerry, he's probably happiest when things aren't
going well," Kupchak said. "I don't think I'm saying anything people
here don't know. When the team here in Los Angeles was at his peak,
he probably was most unhappy. The happiest I've seen him is when he
was rebuilding this team in the '90s, with Eddie Jones, Nick Van
Exel, Anthony Peeler, Elden Campbell, [Vlade] Divac, the whole thing
of rebuilding."</TE>
<TE>   West wanted more, an overhaul, a place where there are big
decisions to be made and challenges to be had. Running the Lakers
again might have meant running himself into the same plot of ground,
and that made no sense to anyone.</TE>
<TE>   "Jerry Buss made it possible for me to be able to leave," West
said. "I never broached that subject with him, because it wasn't
important. The most important thing was for me to be involved and be
busy. I would also tell you that I would never put Jerry Buss or
Mitch Kupchak in a position where I would go there and say, 'Look, I
want to go to work again.' That would be the worst thing in the world
to have happen. I'm extremely proud of my association with the
Lakers. I'm grateful for what they've done for me and my family, but
I would never put anyone in that position."</TE>
<TE>   Also, Kupchak, who studied for 14 years under West, has done a
sound job.</TE>
<TE>   He is conservative by nature, but acted quickly in acquiring
Lindsey Hunter in the hours after Derek Fisher was found to have
refractured his foot last summer. He convinced Samaki Walker to
accept less money with the Lakers than he might have received with
another team, thereby covering the loss of Horace Grant.</TE>
<TE>   Small items, for sure, but nothing major was required.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like to think I contributed anything to Mitch," West
said. "He and I are great friends and he's going to stand on his own.
He's really, really good. I'm surprised that people haven't beat the
doors down for him, and I have been for years. He's done a great job.
Jerry Buss is the best owner you could have, as far as I'm concerned,
because he's a real partner. He wanted you to be fiscally
responsible. That's what the Lakers have done. Mitch has had some
tough areas to get through to get to that point in time."</TE>
<TE>   Now they'll stand side by side, but foes for the first time. After
an emotional farewell Tuesday morning at LAX, West and Kupchak both
will attend an NBA pre-draft workout for Yao Ming, the 7-foot-6
center from China, today in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing really changes," Kupchak said. "I'll probably talk to
Jerry more now."</TE>

<HD>Davis' Shooting Leads Hornets Past Magic</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Whether the Hornets play in Charlotte, N.C., or New Orleans next
season, fans in either city will have someone special to watch.</LD>
<LD>   Baron Davis had 28 points en route to his second consecutive
triple-double, and Charlotte beat the Magic, 102-85, Tuesday in
Orlando, Fla., to win the first-round playoff series in four games.
He finished with 11 rebounds and 10 assists.</LD>
<LD>   The Hornets, awaiting league approval to relocate to New Orleans
next season, will play the winner of the New Jersey-Indiana series in
the Eastern Conference semifinals.</LD>
<TE>   In the series against the Magic, Davis averaged 27.5 points, 9.3
assists and nine rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte Coach Paul Silas said it was a testament to the players
that the Hornets reached the playoffs and advanced in the face of an
impending move.</TE>
<TE>   "We have gone through a lot of turmoil this season, but they have
kept focus," Silas said. "When I needed them to step up, they all
have. It was a total team effort."</TE>
<TE>   Davis' performance was his way of answering Orlando guard Tracy
McGrady, who had guaranteed a Game 4 victory.</TE>
<TE>   "When people trash talk, it can motivate both teams," Davis said
of McGrady's guarantee. "We took it as motivation to say, 'Let's come
out here and end this thing before we go back to Charlotte.'"</TE>
<TE>   And as for McGrady's claim that he was the series' best player,
Davis wasn't going to touch that.</TE>
<TE>   "What I wanted to do was to lead my team and not get into who was
the best player in the series," Davis said. "We all know Tracy
McGrady is one of the top five players in the league. I'm just an
up-and-coming young guy trying to get a little pub."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps Davis' most devastating play came late in the third
quarter, when the Magic was slowly rallying from a 12-point deficit.</TE>
<TE>   With the shot clock winding down and facing a double-team, Davis
coolly sank a straightaway three-point basket to put the Hornets
ahead, 66-57, with 3:36 left in the quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Two free throws by Jamaal Magloire and another by Davis followed
in the next 1:11 to restore the 12-point lead, and the Magic never
came closer than five points again.</TE>
<TE>   McGrady led the Magic with 35 points and six assists.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana 97, New Jersey 74--Instead of riding the bench, Austin
Croshere has the Pacers headed to a Game 5.</TE>
<TE>   Croshere and Ron Artest each scored 18 points at Indianapolis to
lead the Pacers in Game 4 of the first-round best-of-five series. The
decisive game is Thursday at New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   Croshere fell out of Coach Isiah Thomas' favor early this season
and never really worked his way back into the regular rotation.</TE>
<TE>   He had spurts of success--four consecutive games of double-digit
scoring in mid-March--but Thomas didn't play him in half of the final
eight games.</TE>
<TE>   He played a combined 12 minutes in the first two playoff games and
scored five points, but didn't play in Game 3.</TE>
<TE>   The fans never forgot Croshere, though, giving him perhaps the
loudest ovation of any Pacer when he came off the bench in the first
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   They cheered each basket and erupted when Croshere made a 20-foot
basket from the left wing late in the third quarter to give the
Pacers a 15-point lead.</TE>
<TE>   He pumped his fist as the sold-out crowd waved their souvenir
towels and New Jersey called a timeout.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacers shot 67% in the third quarter, committing only three
turnovers in turning around a lackluster first half.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Kidd and Kenyon Martin ran into foul trouble and never ran
New Jersey's offense with any consistency. Kidd scored 10 points and
Martin had 13.</TE>
<TE>   Both teams struggled to find their rhythm in a ragged first half
where there were nearly as many turnovers (24) as field goals (26).</TE>

<HD>Father's Death to Keep Duncan Out of Game 4</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tim Duncan will miss tonight's Game 4 of the San Antonio Spurs'
playoff series against the Seattle SuperSonics because of the death
of his father, leaving the team without both of its seven-footers.</LD>
<LD>   David Robinson will not play for the third consecutive playoff
game after straining his lower back late in the regular season.</LD>
<LD>   Duncan left Monday's practice early after hearing that his father,
William, had been hospitalized after a long illness. He died later
that day in North Carolina.</LD>
<TE>   San Antonio Coach Gregg Popovich said that Duncan "will rejoin the
team as soon as he can."</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs have a 2-1 lead in the best-of-five series. Game 5, if
necessary, would be Friday at San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs may also be without reserve forward Danny Ferry, listed
as doubtful because of a sprained right wrist.</TE>
<TE>   Forwards Malik Rose and Mark Bryant have filled in for Robinson.
The only other big man available is 6-foot-11 Cherokee Parks, who has
had injury problems of his own and has played sparingly this season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Seattle guard Gary Payton was chosen to the NBA All-Defensive
first team for a record-tying ninth time.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers' Kobe Bryant made the second team.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Jordan is the only other player to match Payton's feat.</TE>
<TE>   Payton is joined on the first team by New Jersey guard Jason Kidd,
forward-center Ben Wallace of Detroit, and forwards Duncan and Kevin
Garnett of Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   The team was selected by the NBA's 29 coaches, who weren't allowed
to vote for their own players.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace, the NBA's defensive player of the year, led the
voting--receiving 51 of a possible 56 points. Payton received 47,
Duncan 40, Kidd 37 and Garnett 27.</TE>
<TE>   Others on the second team were Sacramento guard Doug Christie,
Philadelphia center Dikembe Mutombo, San Antonio forward Bruce Bowen
and Detroit forward-center Clifford Robinson.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Russ Granik, deputy NBA commissioner, said the Hornets' move from
Charlotte to New Orleans looks "pretty positive."</TE>
<TE>   "Our relocation committee should have its report out by the end of
this week," Granik said. "And we'll announce what the outcome is.
Based on what we've seen in New Orleans, unless there are some real
surprises, it looks like there is a great deal of support there."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Though they usually meet in late August, Utah Jazz owner Larry
Miller said he plans to meet with John Stockton, 40, in the next two
or three weeks to learn whether the future Hall of Fame point guard
will return for a 19th season.</TE>
<TE>   Miller said the team needs a quicker decision because of its seven
free agents.</TE>

<TE>   Former NBA coach P.J. Carlesimo will run a workout today for NBA
team officials in Chicago for potential top draft pick Yao Ming, a
7-5 Chinese center.</TE>

<HD>Woodson Joins Raiders</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After 15 NFL seasons, 10 Pro Bowl selections and a Super Bowl
victory, safety Rod Woodson doesn't have many lifelong ambitions
left. He did get one more Tuesday, joining the Oakland Raiders.</LD>
<LD>   Woodson, 37, was released by the Baltimore Ravens in a
cost-cutting move after recording 74 tackles and three of his 61
career interceptions--tops among active players and eighth in NFL
history--in 2001.</LD>
<LD>   "I've been a Raiders' fan forever," Woodson said. "If you could
look at the walls of my old bedroom, I had [posters of] Kenny "The
Snake" Stabler, [Lester] Hayes, [Jack] Tatum--I had it all. If it was
the Raiders, it was mine."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tom Coughlin signed a one-year contract extension that will keep
him as Jacksonville's coach through 2004.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Joe Buck, Cris Collinsworth and Troy Aikman will replace Pat
Summerall and John Madden as the No. 1 NFL announcing team at Fox,
which plans to make an announcement Thursday, a source said.</TE>
<TE>   Summerall resigned after the Super Bowl and Madden later left to
work on ABC's "Monday Night Football" with Al Michaels.</TE>
<TE>   Jurisprudence</TE>
<TE>   Colorado football players Marques Harris, Corey Alexander, Ron
Monteihl II and Joseph Allen Mackey Jr., all 20, surrendered to
police at Boulder, Colo., to face arrest warrants on felony charges
of contributing to the delinquency of a minor for allegedly providing
drugs and alcohol to high school players visiting the school.</TE>
<TE>   The incident took place at an off-campus party Dec. 7 in which a
woman alleged she was gang raped. Boulder County District Attorney
Mary Keenan said last week she wouldn't pursue rape charges because
of problems with acquaintance-rape cases.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia basketball players Steve Thomas and Tony Cole, and
football player Brandon Williams pleaded not guilty to charges of
aggravated assault with intent to rape a female student Jan. 14 in a
campus dormitory. Thomas also was charged with rape, and Williams
faces additional charges of rape and aggravated sexual battery.</TE>
<TE>   Auto Racing</TE>
<TE>   NASCAR officials handed out fines to eight crew chiefs for rules
violations the last two weekends at Talladega Superspeedway and
California Speedway.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest of the fines was $1,500 to Steve Lane, crew chief of
Kyle Petty's Dodge. Lane was fined $1,000 for having a rear spoiler
not conforming to NASCAR rules and $500 for an illegal fuel cell
container at Talladega.</TE>
<TE>   Indy Racing League driver Jaques Lazier was released from
Methodist Hospital at Indianapolis, six days after surgery to repair
a broken back suffered in a two-car accident during the Firestone
Indy 225 at Nazareth, Pa., April 21.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   Ryan Smyth and Jamie Wright each scored, and Canada beat the
United States, 2-1, in the World Hockey Championships at Karlstad,
Sweden.</TE>
<TE>   Top-seeded Gustavo Kuerten, playing his first tennis singles match
since hip surgery two months ago, defeated Nikolay Davydenko, 6-2,
6-3, in the first round of Spain's Mallorca Open.</TE>
<TE>   The Sparks suspended reserve center Rhonda Mapp after she failed
to agree with league officials on terms of a contract. Under WNBA
rules, players sign with the league and must be under contract before
they can practice. The Sparks opened practice Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan Sims, a 6-foot-9 junior forward at Cal State Northridge, will
not return to the team. Sims had been suspended by Coach Bobby
Braswell on Feb. 20 for conduct detrimental to the team.</TE>
<TE>   Passings</TE>
<TE>   Services will be held today at 1 at Spangler's Mortuary in Los
Altos for Bob Dorricott, who founded Dorricott Racing and became a
dominant player in North American formula-style open-wheel racing.
Dorricott died Friday of cancer. He was 65.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Montreal Expos were doing well without a victory from ace Javier
Vazquez. Now, they've got him going too.</LD>
<LD>   Vazquez pitched a five-hitter and Peter Bergeron drove in two
runs, and the Expos beat the Astros, 5-1, Tuesday night at Houston.</LD>
<LD>   Vazquez (1-1), who pitched nine innings in a 15-inning victory
over Milwaukee in his last start, struck out nine and walked none. It
was his 11th career complete game.</LD>
<TE>   "He pitched what I call a clean game," Expo Manager Frank Robinson
said. "There were no walks, he kept the runners on the base and he
kept the pitch count in his favor. He was sharp and able to get all
of his pitches in the strike zone."</TE>
<TE>   New York 10, Arizona 1--Mike Piazza homered twice and drove in six
runs at Phoenix, helping the Mets win their fifth consecutive game.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 8, San Francisco 2--Vicente Padilla (3-2) retired the
first 15 batters at San Francisco and the Phillies ended a six-game
skid.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 10, Pittsburgh 0--Mike Hampton won for the first time,
pitching seven scoreless innings at Denver, and Todd Helton hit a
solo home run and a two-run single.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 4, Atlanta 3--Nelson Figueroa (1-1) settled down after a
rocky first inning and hit a two-run single against Greg Maddux (2-2)
to lift the Brewers at Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 7, St. Louis 2--A.J. Burnett (4-2) gave up three hits in
eight innings and Cliff Floyd hit two solo homers for the Marlins at
St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego 2, Chicago 1--Sean Burroughs' run-scoring triple in the
eighth inning lifted the Padres at San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Trevor Hoffman earned his eighth save, giving him 320 with the

<LD>Atlanta Brave outfielder-first baseman B.J. Surhoff will have surgery
on his right knee and sit out the remainder of the season.</LD>
<LD>   "We're going to miss him," Manager Bobby Cox said. "He's so
professional at what he does, always works hard and is a great
example. I hope he comes back and just sits on the bench for us. He
can help us in that respect."</LD>
<LD>   The Braves said Tuesday that tests confirmed that Surhoff had a
torn ligament. Surhoff injured the knee when he ran into the
right-field wall Saturday in the ninth inning of Atlanta's 6-3 loss
to Houston.</LD>

<HD>His Image Was Key to the City</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Mike Penner</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Now that the NBA logo has picked up and moved to Memphis--what next,
Chick Hearn to the Toronto Raptors?--it's time to finally say
something about that logo that should have been said long ago.</LD>
<LD>   It's all wrong.</LD>
<LD>   The famous silhouette of Jerry West, yo-yoing right to left to
right across your dial, driving effortlessly toward a silken 20-foot
pull-up jumper, is quite literally only a shadow of the real thing.
Essential details are missing.</LD>
<TE>   Where is the ragged-ridge nose that was busted more times than the
Celtics broke his heart?</TE>
<TE>   What about the heavily wrapped hamstring he used to drag down the
court on the way to another 40?</TE>
<TE>   Or the perpetual look of torment crossed with determination, as if
West deep down realized that no matter what he did or how mightily he
tried, the outcome was out of his hands--and, chances were, it wasn't
going to be a happy one.</TE>
<TE>   That indelible image of West--hobbled by injury and his supporting
cast and Bill Russell in the other uniform, yet refusing to relent
until the final buzzer temporarily suspended the misery--embodied the
Los Angeles sports fan experience of the late '60s and early '70s.
Long before winnin' time, there was wincing time. You could set your
calendars to it: West would carry the Lakers to another NBA Finals,
West's body would try to systematically shut down on him, he would
grimace through the pain and average 31 points and eight assists, and
the Lakers would lose in seven.</TE>
<TE>   West was Sisyphus in sweat bands, forever pushing the basketball
up an unconquerable mountain.</TE>
<TE>   Deep down, we too had a pretty good feeling of how it was all
going to end, but like West, we flinched along for the ride every
spring. And there was nobody we'd rather have pushing that ball.</TE>
<TE>   West tilted many of his windmills at a time when the Rams raised
and crushed expectations every December, the Dodgers tumbled into
post-Koufax malaise and the Angels were a good way to buy field box
tickets 10 minutes before the first pitch. These were not easy days
to grow up in Los Angeles rooting for the home team.</TE>
<TE>   It would have been much simpler, and smarter, and healthier, to
tear the pennants off the wall and throw away the sports section and
swear to come out of hibernation only for UCLA basketball season.</TE>
<TE>   Why did we keep coming back, half-knowing that nothing good was
ever going to come of it? Because of West.</TE>
<TE>   Every last-second jumper West nailed--and there were scads of
them, more than Michael Jordan could ever imagine--created another
sliver of hope. If the doctors said West could go, taped up and and
stitched up and propped up, the Lakers had a chance, Los Angeles had
a shot.</TE>
<TE>   The most famous basket of West's career, the 63-footer at the end
of Game 3 of the 1970 Finals, said really all that needed to be said.
Lakers losing again, down by two with a couple of seconds to go. They
inbounded the ball and the dejection in Hearn's voice echoed the
disappointment of thousands of Laker fans slumped over their radios.</TE>
<TE>   "West throws up an 80-footer," Hearn said, primarily for the
record, and if he was a few feet off on the guesstimate, who cared,
everyone knew the Lakers were done for.</TE>
<TE>   Hearn paused, long enough to allow the stomach-churning dread to
begin to dissolve into resignation.</TE>
<TE>   "GOOOOOODDD!!!!"</TE>
<TE>   What?!?</TE>
<TE>   Incredibly, West had tied it at the buzzer. In typical West-era
Laker fashion, the shot occurred nine years before the NBA adopted
the three-point rule--although Laker center Wilt Chamberlain, ever a
progressive thinker, jogged into the locker room, thinking the game
was over.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in typical West-era Laker fashion, the teams returned to the
court and the Lakers lost in overtime, on their way to another
seven-game defeat, this time to the New York Knicks.</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, the Lakers finally broke through and West won his
first and only NBA title as a player. Occasionally, ESPN Classic will
show footage of the final seconds of the clincher and the immediate
aftermath. While pandemonium erupts around him, West looks totally
spent, as if the long previous decade of near-misses had drained away
the will and the energy to even muster a smile.</TE>
<TE>   Later on, during his years as Laker coach and general manager, we
discovered this was merely the everyday Jerry West work mode. He
never relaxed, he was never satisfied, even as he assembled the
Showtime Lakers of the 1980s and reloaded in 1996 with quite possibly
the greatest summer an NBA executive ever manufactured--signing free
agent Shaquille O'Neal, trading for the rights to Kobe Bryant and
drafting Derek Fisher.</TE>
<TE>   Younger fans, weaned on Magic Johnson's ever-ready grin amid
confetti showers, couldn't relate. Why won't the guy ever loosen up?
Why can't he just enjoy the windfall?</TE>
<TE>   Here's why: When everyone else saw Shaq dunking over David
Robinson, West saw Russell pointing to the Forum rafters and waving
another No. 1 finger in the face of the Lakers. When everyone else
watched Kobe blowing by Allen Iverson, West couldn't escape the image
of Don Nelson sinking the Lakers in yet another Game 7.</TE>
<TE>   Even with the Grizzlies, where history and expectation are
currently deadlocked at zero, those are the ghosts that will continue
to eat at West, to drive him, even with his legacy still glittering
on the walls and the hardwood inside Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Now that the Lakers have decided to acknowledge their Minneapolis
heritage, fans can easily count the banners and do the math: 13
league championships, with No. 14 potentially looming in June.</TE>
<TE>   From there, the climb gets very interesting. Two more titles by
the team West built and left behind and the Lakers would equal
Boston's all-time record of 16.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe then, but only then, West would have a legacy he could live
with.</TE>
<TE>   As good as the Celtics. At last.</TE>

<LD>Fullerton Troy baseball Coach Dane Ilertsen said he expects the
school's baseball field to be ready for play by Friday after a
single-engine plane crashed through the outfield fence last week and
landed upside down in center field.</LD>
<LD>   Neither the pilot nor his two passengers were seriously injured in
the accident, which occurred just before 6 a.m. last Friday after the
plane's engine failed. The plane leaked fuel and oil, and a convoy of
vehicles damaged the turf during the cleanup process.</LD>
<LD>   Troy (12-9, 8-3) moved its home game scheduled for today against
Freeway League rival La Habra (9-11, 3-8) to La Habra's field. The
teams meet again Friday at Troy if the Warriors' field is ready.</LD>

<LD>Frankly, I needed a day off after making a hitter out of Eric Karros,
a goal scorer out of Jason Allison before he got hurt, and
entertaining Miss March, January, October and February at the Playboy
Mansion. It's a wonder I'm still on my feet.</LD>
<LD>   Of course I haven't had any time for the wife lately, so I decided
to go golfing Monday and give that some thought.</LD>
<LD>   I suppose I could have stayed home--permanently--had I declined
sports editor Bill Dwyre's invitation to participate in the 20th
annual Padua Village Golf Classic at Red Hills Country Club. I just
get tired of caddying for the guy.</LD>
<TE>   But I was told The Times' publisher, some guitar-playing desk
jockey named John Puerner, was going to be in the tournament, too.
That was a relief. I knew Dwyre would be preoccupied fetching drinks
for the big guy, and while I have no idea what a publisher does, one
swing and you could tell he doesn't spend much time playing golf.
That didn't stop Dwyre, however, from gushing after every shot like
he was watching Ernie Els hit the ball.</TE>
<TE>   At the banquet later that night, Tom Lasorda spoke and I was able
to catch a nap, so I felt good coming back Tuesday to work on my next
project: Getting Shawn Green to have more hits than strikeouts.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "OH BOY," Green said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WHEN I arrived at Dodger Stadium I immediately noticed his
problem: He was on the field holding a golf club.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not that good," he said like he had to tell me.</TE>
<TE>   "I know, you've got 23 strikeouts and 22 hits so far," I said.</TE>
<TE>   "No, I'm not a very good golfer," he said. "I've whiffed a few
times trying to hit the golf ball."</TE>
<TE>   I told him I wasn't surprised, because I've seen him try to hit a
baseball.</TE>
<TE>   "It's safe to say I'll be over 100 strikeouts by the end of the
year," he said.</TE>
<TE>   I was thinking July, but I didn't say it. I was here to upgrade
his play because Tim Salmon and the Angels are out of town and that
might require weeks and weeks of my time and a trip to Lourdes to
make a hitter out of him.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   PUTTING A golf club in Green's hands was right on target because
it speaks to his problem.</TE>
<TE>   "You'd make a great PGA Tour player," I said after Green did a
photo shoot for some golf magazine. "You know one of those
nameless-faceless-boring players who make golf unwatchable if Tiger
isn't playing."</TE>
<TE>   "I guess I picked the wrong sport--because I like having no
personality," he said, and you have to have a playful personality to
say something like that.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to smile for you tonight. In fact, I'm going to go down
to the cage right now and work on my smile."</TE>
<TE>   I might go the entire season at Dodger Stadium and get no better
quote than that, and all this time I thought the guy was a walking
dead man.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always been unemotional like that," he said. "I'm more into
repetition."</TE>
<TE>   So what we have here is a mechanized drone in right field that
seems to be malfunctioning at the plate, a lifetime .285 hitter
batting .237 before Tuesday night.</TE>
<TE>   "You might be like a messenger," Green said. "What should I do?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I MAY have to start charging our local teams for making them
better.</TE>
<TE>   "Baby steps," I said. "First, we need you to have more hits than
strikeouts."</TE>
<TE>   Green nodded.</TE>
<TE>   "So I need two hits tonight and no strikeouts," he said, and you
can see how quickly baseball players pick things up.</TE>
<TE>   "Next, we need to inject a little personality into your game," I
said, "You know, something the fans can see."</TE>
<TE>   "Should I get a tattoo?" Green said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TWO YEARS ago I nicknamed him the "puddle," because I felt he
melted under pressure. He disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   "Two years ago I thought I had to start hitting home runs to live
up to expectations and it ruined my swing."</TE>
<TE>   Now some people think the loss of Gary Sheffield is hurting Green.
He disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm getting the same pitches to hit, but just missing them now."</TE>
<TE>   I said, "Don't do that," and I could tell it made an impression on
him.</TE>
<TE>   "I better do good tonight or you're going to pound me, aren't
you?"</TE>
<TE>   Green doubled in his first at-bat.</TE>
<TE>   I wonder what I could do with Anna Kournikova--you know, could I
get her to win a tournament?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE STIFF, however, struck out in the third. The slug flew to left
in the fifth and the bum struck out in the eighth. This may take more
work than I thought.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE TRUTH is, if this guy flashed the charisma, and even the grin
he put on display in the Dodger dugout before Tuesday's game, more
often he'd own the L.A. sports market along with Shaq and Kobe.</TE>
<TE>   He already has the Dodger all-time record for home runs with 49, a
heart of gold as evidenced by the amount of money he has given
quietly to charity, and model-good looks because they weren't taking
those pictures of him with a golf club in his hands because he knows
what to do with it.</TE>
<TE>   Now if he would just get two hits for every strikeout--instead of
the other way around--and smile at his good fortune, I could move on
to Salmon.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in an e-mail from Mark Quentin:</TE>
<TE>   "Helene Elliott, Jerry Crowe and J.A. Adande are all much better
than you. You are old, fat and could never get a Playboy model. Keep
dreaming."</TE>
<TE>   You're dreaming if you think Elliott, Crowe or Adande have any
better chance of getting a Playboy model than I do.</TE>

<HD>French Judge Draws Suspension</HD>
<DH>Figure skating: Le Gougne and federation chief are banned
for three years and 2006 Olympics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Suspended for three years and banned from the 2006 Winter Olympics
for unethical conduct related to the Salt Lake City Olympics pairs
figure skating competition, French judge Marie-Reine Le Gougne and
French federation chief Didier Gailhaguet ridiculed the International
Skating Union's actions Tuesday and vowed to prove their innocence.</LD>
<LD>   The ISU announced sanctions against the pair after two days of
council meetings at its headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland. It
said Le Gougne acted improperly in voting for a Russian pair on
Gailhaguet's orders and in not reporting Gailhaguet's coercion to the
ISU. Le Gougne initially said she had been pressured to vote for the
Russians but later recanted and said she voted her conscience.</LD>
<LD>   Gailhaguet was punished for telling Le Gougne to vote for Russians
Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze over Canadians Jamie Sale and
David Pelletier.</LD>
<TE>   "We went through the papers, we went through the evidence and then
we decided," ISU President Ottavio Cinquanta said. "We are more than
confident we took the right decision.</TE>
<TE>   "It was not an easy case. It's a sad moment."</TE>
<TE>   Figure skating had endured previous judging controversies, but the
flap at Salt Lake City mushroomed into an international incident that
overshadowed the Games. The ISU recommended giving the Canadians
duplicate medals, and the International Olympic Committee, angry that
its showcase event was being tainted by scandal, authorized the
unprecedented award.</TE>
<TE>   Le Gougne said the suspensions were levied so the ISU could
justify awarding the second set of medals.</TE>
<TE>   "I hoped that [Tuesday night] would be the end of a nightmare that
has lasted 21/2 months. Unfortunately, that's not the case," she
said. "But I am more determined than ever. So it's no longer a
nightmare. Now it's a real battle. I want my dignity and honor
restored."</TE>
<TE>   She also said she will air the ISU's dirty linen. "I will explain
how things work," she said. "It's a system that is extremely biased,
dictatorial and even corrupt."</TE>
<TE>   The 40-year-old Frenchwoman called the ISU hearing a farce and a
masquerade, in part because the ISU didn't allow her attorneys to
call witnesses favorable to her stance. The ISU council heard from 13
witnesses; among them were two judges and Gailhaguet's Salt Lake City
chauffeur, Bruce Edwards of Anaheim, who testified about a suspicious
conversation he overheard between Gailhaguet and an unidentified
Russian woman.</TE>
<TE>   "There is not a shadow of proof," Gailhaguet said. "It is an
attempt at political assassination. This affair is far from over."</TE>
<TE>   Gailhaguet and Le Gougne said they will initiate an appeal and
follow that by appealing to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, if
necessary.</TE>
<TE>   The ISU did not say whether Gailhaguet will be forced to surrender
his seat on the ISU council, saying only he and Le Gougne cannot
attend ISU-sanctioned events for three years. Gailhaguet, who in
recent weeks has been accused by several former and current French
judges of pressuring them into voting for certain skaters in exchange
for favorable votes for French skaters, did not participate in the
council's 11-0 decision Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Whether Gailhaguet keeps his council seat is significant, because
it is a power base in decisions that affect the sport."That's really
the whole issue, though, isn't it?" said veteran figure skating coach
John Nicks, who works with Olympic fourth-place finisher Sasha Cohen
in Aliso Viejo.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the decision regarding [Le Gougne] was pretty obvious and
appropriate.... But the larger issue is Didier and what happens with
him and the French association. I think that needs to be clarified."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Figure Skating Assn., which last week recommended
lifetime bans for judges and officials guilty of improper actions,
said it was encouraged by the ISU's move but also urged judging
reform.</TE>
<TE>   However, Skate Canada, the governing body for figure skating in
Canada, hailed the ISU's action. "This is a great day for
international figure skating and for skaters," it said in a
statement. The sanctions send "a strong message to all international
judges that they must be free of influence from their home
federations."</TE>

<LD>Jamie Sale and David Pelletier, the Canadian pair skaters who were at
the center of the judging firestorm at the Salt Lake City Winter
Games, announced Tuesday that they had left Olympic-eligible
competition to skate in shows and professional competitions.</LD>
<LD>   They said, however, that their move was not related to the
International Skating Union's decision earlier in the day to suspend
French judge Marie-Reine Le Gougne and French skating federation
President Didier Gailhaguet and ban the two officials from the 2006
Turin Games.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm very content with what I achieved in amateur skating," Sale
said during a conference call with reporters. "And I'm ready to move
on."</LD>
<TE>   Both declined to comment on the sanctions against Le Gougne and
Gailhaguet.</TE>
<TE>   Sale, 25, and Pelletier, 27, won the 2001 world pairs championship
and were favored at Salt Lake City. Despite a smooth finale performed
to "Love Story," they were declared the silver medalists, behind
Russians Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze, who won a 5-4
judges' split despite several missteps.</TE>
<TE>   Sale and Pelletier were awarded duplicate gold medals by the
International Olympic Committee after the ISU determined that Le
Gougne had acted improperly in not reporting alleged pressure from
Gailhaguet. They skipped the subsequent World Championships, as did
Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze.</TE>

<LD>Argentina's Juan Sebastian Veron, England's David Beckham and
Ireland's Roy Keane will have more time to recover from their
assorted injuries and be ready for the World Cup now that Manchester
United has been eliminated from the European Champions League.</LD>
<LD>   Bayer Leverkusen of Germany held United to a 1-1 tie Tuesday and
advanced to the May 15 final in Glasgow, Scotland, on the strength of
the away goals it scored in Manchester in a 2-2 tie last week in the
first match of the two-game semifinal series.</LD>
<LD>   A goal by Keane in the 28th minute gave United the lead, but
Germany national team striker Oliver Neuville tied it before halftime
and Leverkusen, which includes American defender Frankie Hejduk in
its ranks, was able to hold for the tie.</LD>
<TE>   Bayer Leverkusen will meet either Real Madrid or Barcelona in the
final. The Spanish clubs play their second semifinal game today in
Madrid. Real won the first, 2-0, in Barcelona last week.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bayer Leverkusen's success came at a high cost. Defender Jens
Nowotny suffered suspected ligament damage in his knee in a clash
with United's Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy and could be lost to
Germany's World Cup team.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Spain lost midfielder Pep Guardiola for the World Cup after tests
Tuesday revealed the extent of an injury he suffered while playing
for Brescia against Juventus in the Italian league Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "He has suffered damage to his collateral ligament and will be out
until the end of July," a Brescia spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. team gathers today in Cary, N.C., for a 10-day camp and
Coach Bruce Arena was asked Tuesday whether Kasey Keller or Brad
Friedel will be his starting goalkeeper. "To tell you the truth, I'm
not spending a second thinking about it," Arena said.</TE>
<TE>   Latin America</TE>
<TE>   Oscar Ruggeri resigned as coach of Guadalajara in the Mexican
league after an indifferent season. Ruggeri, the captain of
Argentina's 1986 World Cup-winning team, compiled a 15-12-18 record
while in charge of Chivas.</TE>
<TE>   Former Guadalajara players Fernando Quirarte and Jose Manuel de la
Torre are among the favorites to take charge of the club.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Paraguay midfielder Guido Alvarenga, who plays for Leon in the
Mexican league, has fully recovered after an appendicitis operation
and is ready to rejoin the national team. Paraguay will train for a
week in Montecatini, Italy, starting next week, and will play Sweden
in Stockholm on May 17 before leaving for the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Asia</TE>
<TE>   South Korea Coach Guus Hiddink named a squad of 23 players--his
probable World Cup team--for a May 16 game against Scotland in Pusan.</TE>

<HD>Maple Leafs Finally Finish Off Islanders</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>The Toronto Maple Leafs limped into the second round of the playoffs.
At least they'll have the extra home game against Ottawa.</LD>
<LD>   Judging by their seven-game series with the New York Islanders,
the Maple Leafs may need it.</LD>
<LD>   Alexander Mogilny scored twice and the Maple Leafs beat the
Islanders, 4-2, Tuesday night to win their Eastern Conference
quarterfinal playoff series, 4-3.</LD>
<TE>   Toronto won all four home games despite not having captain Mats
Sundin (broken left wrist) for most of the series. They also were
without Shayne Corson, suspended for Game 7.</TE>
<TE>   "I can honestly say I've never been prouder," Toronto's Tie Domi
said. "We've been through a lot of adversity and we didn't make any
excuses. Everybody wrote us off when we lost our leader."</TE>
<TE>   The Maple Leafs will face provincial rival Ottawa, which
eliminated Philadelphia in five games. The series begins Thursday
night at Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   Mogilny gave Toronto a 2-1 lead in the second period and scored
his fourth goal of the playoffs on an empty-netter with 40 seconds
left.</TE>
<TE>   "We never quit," Mogilny said. "Everybody stepped up in different
games and in different times. Cujo was huge for us throughout the
series."</TE>
<TE>   Toronto's Curtis Joseph made 31 saves, with several outstanding
stops in the waning moments.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't play very well on the road," Joseph said. "They played
exceptionally well at home. It was a battle. Thank goodness we had
home-ice advantage."</TE>
<TE>   Alexei Yashin and Kip Miller scored for the Islanders, who lost
captain Michael Peca (torn knee ligaments) and defenseman Kenny
Jonsson (concussion) in Game 5 on controversial body checks.</TE>
<TE>   New York's Dave Scatchard said it was the dirtiest series in which
he has played.</TE>
<TE>   "Intensity brings that out, I guess. It's unfortunate, but it was
pretty intense hockey, that's for sure," Scatchard said.</TE>
<TE>   New York, making its first playoff appearance in eight years, lost
the first two games at Toronto before winning consecutive games at
Long Island. The Maple Leafs won Game 5 at Toronto, during which Gary
Roberts checked Jonsson from behind into the glass and Darcy Tucker
injured Peca with a hip check.</TE>
<TE>   Emotionally charged by those incidents, the Islanders won a
fight-filled Game 6.</TE>
<TE>   There was no fighting and far less violence in Game 7 as players
didn't want to cost their team the series with a dumb penalty.</TE>
<TE>   "Both teams were trying to be smart," Roberts said. "It was a
tough game for the enforcers to play."</TE>

<HD>Garland Leads Waves' Charge</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>ERIC STEPHENS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In his native Belgium, Al Garland doesn't draw the fanfare Kim
Clijsters and Justine Henin do in the tennis world.</LD>
<LD>   Garland can make a name for himself known back home by the end of
the month. In college tennis, the Pepperdine senior is a contender
for the NCAA men's singles title.</LD>
<LD>   "I think he's got a really good shot," Wave Coach Peter Smith
said. "He's got a great college game. He presses, he makes guys miss.
He can play any kind of game necessary to win at this level."</LD>
<TE>   Garland and his team could be hoisting trophies in the next couple
of weeks at Texas A&amp;M, where the round of 16 team competition begins
May 18 and the individual tournament starts four days later. Garland
was ranked No. 1 earlier this year by the Intercollegiate Tennis
Assn. and is currently fourth. Pepperdine is ranked fifth and will
find out Thursday if it will play host to first- and second-round
regional matches.</TE>
<TE>   As the Waves' top player, Garland has flourished since reaching
the NCAA semifinals last spring. Earlier this year, he beat
third-ranked Harsh Mankad of Minnesota when he was ranked No. 1.</TE>
<TE>   "At the start of last year, if you had said I would have got to
the semifinals, I would have just laughed at you," Garland said. "For
me, that was a surprise and it's something that helped me this year.
It was a great experience and it's something that I'll have for the
rest of my life."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC men's tennis Coach Dick Leach decided 23 years was enough in
announcing his retirement last week. The 11th-ranked Trojans hope to
send him out with a long run in the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they would want to send me out on a good note but I tell
them I've got my rings," said Leach, who won three national titles in
the early 1990s. "This is for [the players]. I think they all want to
win, especially my seniors, and they want to go out the best way they
can."</TE>
<TE>   One of the reasons Leach, 62, is stepping down is to preserve his
health. He has diabetes and must regularly take insulin shots.</TE>
<TE>   "My daughter told me, 'Dad, you've got to get out of this,'" he
said after a dramatic 4-3 victory April 20 at Stanford, the Trojans'
first victory there in eight years.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach State captured its first NCAA women's tennis tournament
berth by defeating UC Irvine, 4-2, to win the Big West Conference
championship Sunday at Ojai.</TE>
<TE>   The 49ers (21-2) avenged a 5-2 loss in the regular season finale
two weeks ago. Cheryl Kindred, Long Beach's No. 5 singles player,
earned most valuable player honors for winning all three of her
matches in the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After defeating Stanford, 11-7, on Sunday for the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation women's water polo championship, UCLA was seeded
second and will play Loyola Marymount in the NCAA semifinals May 11
at USC.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford, which received the at-large berth, was seeded first and
will play Michigan in the other semifinal. UCLA (21-3) defeated
Stanford, 5-4, in last year's inaugural NCAA title match.</TE>
<TE>   Loyola (20-7) won its second consecutive Western Water Polo Assn.
title with an 8-4 victory Sunday over UC San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC won its second consecutive Pacific 10 Conference men's golf
title and 17th in the 43-year history of the program by finishing 15
strokes ahead of Stanford on Saturday at Corvallis, Ore.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Hayes shot a 69 on a final day in which the Trojans carded a
four-under-par 356 as a team. Kevin Stadler shot a 72 Saturday and
finished with a three-under 285 to tie for second individually with
Stanford's Philip Rowe, one stroke behind medalist Jim Seki of
Stanford. It is the sixth top-five finish this season for Stadler.
Hayes and Scott Oxandaboure tied for fourth at two-under 286.</TE>

<LD>   1960--Selected by Minneapolis Lakers in first round (second pick
overall). West never plays in Minneapolis because Lakers move to L.A.
before his first game.</LD>
<LD>   1961-62--Averages 30.8 points and is named to All-NBA first team
for first of 10 times in his 14-season career. Also selected to play
in first of 13 consecutive All-Star games.</LD>
<TE>   1965 playoffs--In a six-game series against Baltimore, West
averages a still-NBA record 46.3 points.</TE>
<TE>   April 29, 1970--Makes a 60-foot shot as time expires to send Game
3 of the NBA Finals against New York into overtime.</TE>
<TE>   1971-72--Leads Lakers to a 69-13 record, including an NBA-record
33-game win streak. Leads Lakers to their first NBA title in Los
Angeles. Leads the NBA in assists (9.7)</TE>
<TE>   1973-74--Retires as a player after an injury-plagued season.</TE>
<TE>   1976-77--After taking two years off from the NBA, West returns to
coach the Lakers, who finish with an NBA-best record of 53-29 before
losing in the Western Conference finals to Portland.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A look at the NBA titles won when Jerry West was an executive with
the team, with key moves made during that season:</LD>
<LD>   1979-80</LD>
<LD>   Record: 60-22</LD>
<TE>   Finals: defeated 76ers in NBA Finals, 4-2</TE>
<TE>   Key moves: Drafts Magic Johnson with first overall pick of NBA
draft. Promotes Paul Westhead to head coach after Jack McKinney is
seriously injured in a biking accident 13 games into the season.</TE>
<TE>   1981-82</TE>
<TE>   Record: 57-25</TE>
<TE>   Finals: defeated 76ers, 4-2</TE>
<TE>   Key moves: Fires Westhead and hires Pat Riley as coach. Signs
free-agent forward Kurt Rambis. After Mitch Kupchak suffers a
season-ending knee injury, sends a second-round draft choice to New
Jersey for Bob McAdoo, who replaces Kupchak.</TE>
<TE>   1984-85</TE>
<TE>   Record: 62-20</TE>
<TE>   Finals: defeated Celtics, 4-2</TE>
<TE>   Key moves: The key moves came in the 1983-84 season, when West
traded Norm Nixon and Eddie Jordan to San Diego for Byron Scott and
Swen Nater. During the 1984-85 season, Scott becomes the only Laker
to lead the NBA in three-point field-goal percentage.</TE>
<TE>   1986-87</TE>
<TE>   Record: 65-17</TE>
<TE>   Finals: defeated Celtics, 4-2</TE>
<TE>   Key moves: Realizing midway through the season that the Lakers
need another presence and scoring threat in the frontcourt, West
trades Frank Brickowski, Petur Gudmundsson and two draft picks to San
Antonio for Mychal Thompson, who contributes greatly to title run.</TE>
<TE>   1987-88</TE>
<TE>   Record: 62-20</TE>
<TE>   Finals: defeated Pistons, 4-3</TE>
<TE>   Key moves: None, but the Thompson trade still pays dividends as
the Lakers win the second consecutive title, but last until....</TE>
<TE>   1999-00</TE>
<TE>   Record: 67-15</TE>
<TE>   Finals: defeated Pacers, 4-2</TE>
<TE>   Key moves: Hires Phil Jackson as coach. Signs free agents Ron
Harper and Brian Shaw. Resigns at end of the season to become a
consultant for the team.</TE>
<TE>   2000-01</TE>
<TE>   Record: 56-26</TE>
<TE>   Finals: defeated 76ers, 4-1</TE>
<TE>   Key moves: None, other than to be in the wings in support of
protege Kupchak.</TE>

<HD>Too Many Officials, No Leaders</HD>
<DH>Secession movements are no answer for what ails L.A.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>What Los Angeles needs: a coherent discussion of our shared future.</LD>
<LD>   What Los Angeles has: a laugh track.</LD>
<LD>   Greater Los Angeles--you define its boundaries--is a community,
except in name. Except in organization. Except by how we govern
ourselves. Regionally, we have grown big without thinking big. We
entrust no civic body, no individuals, to see from our mountains to
our coast. Yet vision, above all, is the catalyst for making our
community livable. At the start of the millennium, I opened a file
folder for news clippings: "Ideas Offered for the Future of Los
Angeles." It's the slenderest file on my desk.</LD>
<TE>   Our democracy has gone to seed. The garden of self-governance is a
weed bed. And the secessionists are feeding fertilizer to the nettles
and dandelions of our civic organism when they seek to add a harbor
city, a Hollywood city, a Valley city to the underbrush of cities we
already have.</TE>
<TE>   Whom do we count on, in what office, for leadership to meet our
shared challenges: transportation, education, public safety, cultural
and ethnic harmony, population growth, economic opportunity, housing,
recreation, a better community for better living? If all the mayors
of our region gathered to discuss our civic agenda and each was
allotted just 30 minutes to speak, it would probably take longer than
two weeks just to open the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Who can make the case for us in Sacramento and Washington? Who can
crack heads there when needed?</TE>
<TE>   We have no process for achieving progress.</TE>
<TE>   How can citizens keep abreast of things? Knowledge is the basic
ingredient of intelligent democracy. Yet, all our community's
newspapers, radio stations and television stations combined do not
have the person power, time or space to keep the public informed of
agencies and officials who determine our civic life.</TE>
<TE>   Do you know where your sales tax dollars go? How your motor
vehicle fees are distributed? Do you understand the powers of the
Southern California Assn. of Governments? The independent Vector
Control District controls what exactly? Is your city a charter city
or a general law city or a contract city? Why do mayors run on
platforms to fix things, like schools, over which they have no
authority? Chances are, anyone who actually understands how our
community is governed is too big a bore to listen to.</TE>
<TE>   Greater Los Angeles is a city-state. As envisioned by the Greeks
long ago, this is the ideal structure for self-governance:
Neighborhoods are linked to villages, which are drawn together in
districts, which in turn form the larger whole: a government
organized to reflect the way we live.</TE>
<TE>   If we could improve the quality of life by splintering ourselves
into more cities, we would have paradise already.</TE>
<TE>   We have a tradition here. Our forebears diluted power so that we
would not be oppressed by it. Which is fine until that day when we
find that it's so watered down that we're all powerless.</TE>
<TE>   The Greater Los Angeles of today is the product of intense civic
planning, particularly in the last 55 years. It was planned by
developers, tract by tract. Now, this region is built out. Tracts and
neighborhoods have merged. Old quarrels about dividing up the pie
overlook the fact that we now dine off the same communal plate. The
opportunities and problems of the future occur on a scale that
overwhelms the scattershot governmental organizations created
opportunistically by real estate moguls.</TE>
<TE>   Men and women to match our mountains? Thanks to secessionists, we
will spend the rest of the year, and maybe years to come, plotting
out mole hills. We should be going in the other direction: toward
accountability and rationality. Instead of more horizontal layers and
more tug o' wars and more contentious politicians and more confusion,
we should be striving toward a vertical, streamlined government.</TE>
<TE>   We need people to blame when things go wrong. Real people whose
names we know. We need enough of them to keep things lively, but not
so many that they can pass the buck. We need characters in our civic
life--a few characters as big as the collective "us," leaders who
reflect our own character, people around whom a center of gravity
forms. Instead, we, the most celebrity-minded people in the history
of people, are administered by a busload of clerks.</TE>
<TE>   Democracy and local control? Adding more mayors and councils and
commissions would, in the end, make matters worse. Inevitably, our
problems must be confronted regionally. Unless we do it directly,
regional authority will be imposed on us by Washington and
Sacramento, as has occurred incrementally already. And look around:
Regional boards and associations don't answer to us at the ballot
box.</TE>
<TE>   The difference between a vibrant community and a failing community
turns on a single idea: Do residents believe they can shape their own
future. How in the world can we do that if not together?</TE>

<HD>U.S. Takes Russia for Granted at Its Peril</HD>
<DH>President Bush's mistreatment of a prime ally in the
terrorism fight endangers our national security.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATRINA VANDEN HEUVEL and STEPHEN F. COHEN</AU>
<BD>Katrina vanden Heuvel is editor of the Nation. Stephen
F. Cohen is professor of Russian studies at New York University.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Unless American policy changes significantly before Presidents Bush
and Vladimir V. Putin meet in late May, the possibility of a historic
U.S.-Russia partnership may be lost.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, in the seven months since Putin became the Bush
administration's most valuable ally in the war against terrorism in
Afghanistan, this second chance to establish a truly cooperative
relationship with post-Communist Russia--after the squandered
opportunity of the 1990s--has been gravely endangered by Bush's own
policies.</LD>
<LD>   Russia's contribution to the U.S. counter-terror operation in
Afghanistan in the weeks after Sept. 11 exceeded that of all NATO
allies combined. Moscow not only provided intelligence information,
it allowed the Pentagon to use its airspace and crucial Soviet-built
airfields in Central Asia.</LD>
<TE>   It also stepped up its military assistance to the Afghan Northern
Alliance, which Russia had supported long before Sept. 11 and which
did most of the ground fighting until recently.</TE>
<TE>   But now, even Russia's pro-Western lobbies are asking: "What did
we get in return?"</TE>
<TE>   Revelations in March that the Pentagon's new nuclear doctrines
continue to include Russia as a possible target were the lead story
for days in Russia's media. Most of the headlines and commentary were
angrily anti-American. Such sentiments, which had diminished after
Sept. 11, have been growing rapidly. Symptomatic is the widely
expressed view that a U.S.-led plot had deprived Russian athletes of
gold medals at the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   More serious, however, is the opinion spreading across Moscow's
political spectrum that the Bush administration's war on terrorism
has less to do with helping Russia fight Islamic extremism on its
borders than with establishing military outposts for a new American
empire--"a new Rome," as one political insider called it. The primary
goal of this empire is believed to be control over the region's
enormous oil and gas reserves. Even Russians who consider themselves
pro-American are finding it increasingly difficult to counter this
charge.</TE>
<TE>   As seen from Moscow, the Bush administration since Sept. 11 has
been systematically imposing what Russia has always feared--military
encirclement. That view is not surprising: It appears likely that by
2003 there will be a U.S. or NATO military presence in at least nine
of the 15 former Soviet republics.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Putin is coming under increasing attack in Moscow for
"losing" Central Asia and the Caucasus by succumbing to U.S.
imperialism. Of special importance has been a series of published
open letters signed by retired generals, including a former defense
minister, accusing Putin of betraying the nation's security and other
vital interests. A struggle over the wisdom of Putin's strategic
choice of an alliance with the U.S.--and perhaps over Putin's
leadership itself--is clearly underway in Russia's political class.</TE>
<TE>   If nothing else, the new U.S. strategic thinking, including its
enhanced status for tactical nuclear weapons, strengthens elements in
the Russian military that have lobbied since the 1990s for giving
"surgical" battlefield nukes a larger role in the Kremlin's own
doctrine. As a leading Russian military specialist has contended, the
new U.S. doctrine gives the Russian military additional incentive for
new testing and deployment.</TE>
<TE>   All this suggests that the scheduled summit in Russia between Bush
and Putin may turn out to be little more than a show designed to
promote the two leaders' political fortunes while doing nothing to
achieve today's most urgent security need--sharp reductions in both
sides' nuclear arsenals.</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 11 notwithstanding, the post-Cold War nuclear world is more
dangerous than the Cold War period itself. The main reason is the
instability of Russia's nuclear infrastructures. CIA Director George
Tenet has emphasized, for example, that Russia's nuclear devices,
materials and knowledge might become the primary source of
proliferation.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration's policy of treating Russia not as a real
partner but merely as a helper when it suits U.S. purposes--not to
mention a potential nuclear target--only increases the dangers.</TE>
<TE>   In that fundamental sense, the U.S. today has an administration
whose policies toward Russia are endangering America's national
security.</TE>

<HD>Weapons of Rage Are Fed With the Ammunition of Suffering</HD>
<DH>Both sides in the Mideast must transcend their bitter
histories.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRIDA GHITIS</AU>
<BD> Frida Ghitis is author of "The End of Revolution: a
Changing World in the Age of Live Television" (Algora Publishing,
2001).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>During my visit to a refugee camp in the jungles at the Thai-Burma
border last year, a Burmese refugee leader related to me an important
lesson he learned from the Palestinians: You can't let life become
comfortable for your people, he said, or they'll give up the
struggle. There's little chance that life will become excessively
easy for Palestinians today. Still, the Burmese leader was on to
something. Suffering is the fuel of the fighting in the Middle East,
on both sides of the conflict.</LD>
<LD>   The Palestinians are desperate from life under occupation. What
else can they do, goes the standard explanation, but resort to
terrorism? The Israelis are desperate after the slaughter inflicted
upon them by terrorists. What else can they do, they say, but respond
with an iron fist? The Palestinians have endured life with the
indignities of Israel's occupation for decades. The Israelis have
lived under the threat of destruction by their Arab neighbors for
longer. Who's angrier? Who's more determined? Who has suffered more?</LD>
<TE>   In the poisoned well of the Middle East, suffering is the magic
potion that invigorates. Israel was built on the ashes of the
Holocaust. "Never again" became the mantra of survival. After
European anti-Semitism nearly succeeded in exterminating the Jewish
people, the Jews of Israel pledged they would never again allow
anti-Jewish hatred to develop into a machine of death. Every memory
of the 6 million killed in Nazi death camps became a weapon of
protection against the new threat from Arab countries repeatedly
vowing to wipe Israel off the map.</TE>
<TE>   All the while, most of the Palestinian people lived in misery
under Israeli rule or as refugees in Arab countries, trapped between
Israel's "never again" creed and the bluster of Arab dictators who
exploited the refugees' living condition to divert attention from
their own tyrannical rule. No one, really, worked to improve the
lives of Palestinians, and both sides, Arabs and Israelis,
unwittingly conspired to stoke the embers of their rage.</TE>
<TE>   Israel may have the most powerful military arsenal in the region,
but the weapon of choice in the Middle East is rage--loaded with the
ammunition of suffering. Sadly, every salvo from this weapon provides
the other side with ammunition. Every suicide bombing energizes
Israel's determination. Every military incursion gives the
Palestinians a rallying cry to hit again.</TE>
<TE>   The cycle is made even worse by the strategic thinking, on both
sides, that the unacceptable policies of the enemy should not be
rewarded with compromise.</TE>
<TE>   The manipulation of suffering is nothing new. Yugoslavia's war of
self-destruction was built on reminiscence of horrors past. Slobodan
Milosevic climbed to the top of the Serbian political world by
visiting the site of the Serbs' great defeat at the hands of the
Turkish Ottoman Muslims in 1389. The Serbs recounted in gruesome
detail what the Croats, as Nazi allies, did to them, and the Croats
and Muslims armed themselves with the suffering brought on by the
horrors committed by the new Serbs.</TE>
<TE>   But when it comes to suffering, nobody can top the Middle East.
Any Jew will tell you that no people have suffered like the Jewish
people. But the Palestinians will be quick to point out that they are
the ones suffering more today. Who's keeping count? Everyone is.</TE>
<TE>   It's not easy to win a war fought with suffering and rage. The
price is too high. It's even harder to stop this kind of war. It
requires leaders with almost superhuman qualities. Not the kind who
make sure their people's lives are difficult enough that they won't
give up the struggle. It requires Mandelas, Ghandis, visionaries and
statesmen. It takes men or women who can rise above human emotion to
lead their people away from purely emotional reactions. Individuals
like that are obviously not in charge today anywhere in the region.
Perhaps they are somewhere, quietly pondering what is to be done. In
the meantime, each side will continue to arm itself with rage, and
punish the other with its sorrow.</TE>

<HD>Scientific Speed Is the Key in Fighting Bioterror</HD>
<DH>America should have a special lab and a system of molecular
fingerprinting.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It's human nature: The United States' fear of another biological
attack is fading fast. But it shouldn't.</LD>
<LD>   In Kandahar, U.S. forces have discovered an Al Qaeda laboratory
that was to produce anthrax. And one of the Sept. 11 hijackers may
have been treated in Florida for cutaneous anthrax last June. The
threat of biological terrorism is real.</LD>
<LD>   So far, our efforts have focused on improving the care of
potential biological victims. And whether last year's perpetrator,
still at large, is a lone "bio Kaczynski" or an organized "bio Bin
Laden" is somewhat beside the point. The primary issue is that the
United States must devise a broader plan to prevent, deter and
respond to the long-term threats of biological terrorism.</LD>
<TE>   How could we do this? The complete DNA sequence of anthrax is to
be unveiled next week in a public database. A practical solution to
the biological security problem would take advantage of such
scientific knowledge and the fact that different strains of anthrax
are readily identifiable with molecular fingerprinting technology.</TE>
<TE>   The means exist to create a high-speed laboratory and molecular
forensic database against germs like anthrax. Such a laboratory would
provide for positive identification and source tracing for anthrax
and many other "select germs" identified by Congress, including
hantavirus and plague.</TE>
<TE>   Proposed laws to strengthen homeland security call for more
guards, padlocks, record-keeping and personnel checks at laboratories
that handle select germs. Such measures would be expensive and
time-consuming. Yet forensic security can ease the burdens of
physical security.</TE>
<TE>   Here's how it might work: Researchers would be required to
periodically submit samples of their labs' select germs for
high-speed fingerprinting. This practice would automatically maintain
a list of institutions and investigators who handled select germs
(something that does not exist at present) and an up-to-date forensic
database on them. If germs from a legitimate institution were used in
a biological attack, we would uncover this quickly, perhaps
overnight.</TE>
<TE>   The 1972 Biological Weapons Convention, agreed to by 162 nations,
bans the maintenance of offensive bioweapons programs but offers no
provisions for verification and compliance.</TE>
<TE>   The high-speed laboratory could provide a new technical foundation
for sensitive and effective inspection procedures based on molecular
forensics. For example, if an insecticide plant was inspected and
found to contain traces of anthrax, we would take action. That's
prevention.</TE>
<TE>   There are about 20 rogue countries and organizations with secret
offensive biological weapons programs, and the number is growing. If
we had a high-speed laboratory, it would help in the covert
monitoring of their capabilities and in fingerprinting their germs.
And we could put such states on notice that, if their weapons were
ever used against us, we would pinpoint their origins and act with
guaranteed force. That's deterrence.</TE>
<TE>   In the event of a biological attack, the high-speed laboratory
could test thousands of samples each day. It would help public health
officials to save lives, reduce confusion and speed recovery
operations. That's response.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, more information on bioterror germs would benefit
medical research. It could speed the development of new drugs and
vaccines. Because of this, the forensic database should be made
available to scientists and not completely "walled off" behind
government top security.</TE>
<TE>   A handful of anthrax letters has made it apparent that Americans
are vulnerable to biological attacks. The first time we were
relatively lucky--five deaths, a dozen or so hospitalizations, 30,000
people on prophylactic antibiotics. The next attack could kill
thousands and cause havoc in our collective psyche and national
economy.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has comprehensive plans to prevent, deter and respond to
potential nuclear and conventional attacks. Now we need a plan for
biological attacks. Every dollar spent on a high-speed system would
save much more.</TE>

<LD>There's not much tiger left in the tank of energy legislation that
President Bush sent to Congress last year. The House bill still
contains much of Bush's program, including exploration and drilling
for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. But after bitter
debates, the Senate rejected Arctic drilling and turned down the
Democrats' major alternative--to save oil by boosting automobile,
sport utility vehicle and light-truck mileage standards. Each side
has basically lost its centerpiece energy measures.</LD>
<LD>   What's left of the bills would save only a little energy through
conservation or develop only a few additional energy resources. But
there's enough between them to craft a final proposal worth passing.</LD>
<LD>   The first thing the conference committee should do is put the
Arctic refuge issue to rest. Senate sources say a majority will never
vote for a final bill containing the Arctic provision. There's no
point wasting time discussing it.</LD>
<TE>   Next, the committee should reject the Senate provision tripling
the amount of ethanol that must be added to gasoline--a political
giveaway to Midwestern farmers who grow corn and big processors such
as Archer Daniels Midland that turn it into ethanol. California would
have to use 2.7 million gallons of costly ethanol it did not need,
according to Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.). The ethanol presumably
would replace MTBE, an oxygenating additive that is being banned in
California because it leaks into aquifers. The fact is, modern
reformulated gasolines do not need either MTBE or ethanol to meet
clean-air standards. This is pure pork barrel--or corn
bushel--politics.</TE>
<TE>   The better alternative is House language that would provide a
25-cent-a-gallon federal tax credit for businesses using alternative
fuels. Ethanol already is highly subsidized. If its producers can't
make it succeed as an additive with an additional 25 cents a gallon
in assistance, it just doesn't meet the test of American market
economics. And if Congress loves ethanol so much, the U.S., not the
state, should bear the burden of subsidizing it.</TE>
<TE>   The conference committee also should support House language
requiring the Department of Transportation to reduce U.S. gasoline
use by 5 billion gallons from 2004 to 2010.</TE>
<TE>   A Senate provision dividing $14 billion in energy subsidies
between conservation and new sources of energy and boosting the
amount of electricity that must be generated by renewable fuels
deserves inclusion as well.</TE>
<TE>   If the committee makes the right choices, the final measure could
provide a modest improvement in the nation's energy picture. Make the
wrong choices and the nation might be better off with no bill at all.</TE>

<LD>It's rare for a president to give a speech on mental health. But it's
wise. On Monday, President Bush decried how the mental health system
lets "too many Americans fall through the cracks," leaving people
whose brains have somehow betrayed them stuck on the street or in
prison before help is given, if it's given at all.</LD>
<LD>   That nails the problem. But Bush so far is missing his chance to
contribute to the solution. He should embrace, if only in its basic
outline, legislation that could help fix the mess he described. The
so-called mental health parity bill--by Sens. Pete V. Domenici
(R-N.M.) and Paul Wellstone (D-Minn.)--would compel health plans to
offer equal payment for the treatment of certain mental illnesses and
other physical ailments.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, a trade group representing HMOs denounced the
Domenici-Wellstone bill as impractical, saying it would "add billions
of dollars to health-care costs at a time when 40 million Americans
lack access to health insurance and many more are struggling to
afford the coverage they have."</LD>
<TE>   The bill is not nearly as fast and loose with cash as the trade
group suggests. Last year, lawmakers modified it to exempt firms with
50 or fewer employers, and this year its authors are offering to
exempt employers that can show that complying would increase their
annual premiums by more than 2.5%.</TE>
<TE>   Still, soaring health-care costs are a major problem. Employers'
average premiums rose 13% last year. Given this economic reality,
some truly sick people simply are not going to get all the help they
need, which is why the bill must be worded with surgical precision to
provide care for those most in need of help.</TE>
<TE>   The Congressional Research Service recently concluded that the
Domenici-Wellstone bill would require coverage for "all medically
necessary treatment of psychiatric conditions listed in the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders." That manual,
however, is a Pandora's box of ailments and afflictions, not all of
which pass muster as serious in realms where common sense prevails.</TE>
<TE>   Should health plans, for example, cover nightmare disorder ("the
repeated occurrence of frightening dreams that lead to awakenings
from sleep") jet lag, caffeine-induced sleep disorder,
substance-induced sexual dysfunction, and partner relational problem
("a pattern of interaction between spouses or partners characterized
by negative communications")?</TE>
<TE>   Common sense--and medical science--recognizes, however, that many
mental illnesses are as serious as a heart attack. Yet health plans
routinely discriminate against people whose brains are diseased, as
evidenced by the fact that many plans levy $5 co-payments for
cholesterol drugs but $50 co-payments for drugs that can silence the
voices that destroy psychotic patients' lives.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush has shown that he grasps the sad reality of mental
illness and its impact on families and society. Now he and Congress
need to correct the disparity in how health plans treat the mentally
ill.</TE>

<LD>Thanks to a fascinating new finding by the Hubble Space Telescope, we
now know that the universe we inhabit is not only large enough to
make Earth a sandy speck on the beaches of one lonely galaxy but is
older than even South Carolina's Sen. Strom Thurmond. Our universe,
it turns out, is about 14 billion years old, give or take 6 million
months. If that doesn't make you feel younger today, nothing will.</LD>
<LD>   Astronomers, who've been debating the universe's age for what once
seemed like a long time, figured this out by photographing and
measuring the fading light of distant star cinders, which the space
telescope can do from above our murky atmosphere. At a constant rate,
these cinders have cooled to only 2,500 degrees Celsius. So faint was
this arriving starlight that each photo's exposure needed eight days,
which seems a long time to hold a pose until you realize that the
light being captured departed the distant star 7,000 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   That star could have become inhabited and gone through our
recorded history twice since that gaseous glimmer flew out into
space. For all we know, in those 70 centuries that star has cooled to
2,497 degrees and been bought by Vivendi Universal for an outer space
theme park.</LD>
<TE>   We do love to count things. But these astronomical numbers put a
whole new perspective on the concept of time for hurried earthlings,
who feel the need for e-mails, microwaves, FedExes, 22-minute sitcoms
and politicians with two-term limits.</TE>
<TE>   True, astronomers announced the universe's precise age with a
certainty that comes only from the confidence that no one else is
counting. But 14 billion years can still be helpful to recall during,
for instance, a daylong wait for the cable TV guy. Or during all
those other musical acts at the spring concert before your kid
performs.</TE>
<TE>   Fourteen billion years is a galactically golden excuse for tardy
bus drivers ("Hey, we're only a few minutes late") and forgetful
husbands ("Honey, what's one forgotten anniversary in a universe
that's 14 billion years old?"). Fourteen billion years would produce
plenty of junk mail, but such a span certainly makes a morning
commute on the 101 seem less unreasonable.</TE>
<TE>   Just imagine how many times women's skirt lengths went up and down
in 14 billion years. Or the convoluted exercise equipment that could
be invented for infomercials. Picture the number of photo ops for
Gov. Gray Davis in 14 billion years of ostentatiously opening new
power plants. Or the times people have said, "Bottom line ... " or
"I'll call you" or "At the end of the day...." Fourteen billion years
have 5,110,000,000,000 mornings, a daunting amount of shaves. If
light took 7,000 years to arrive, how long do you figure for a
property tax bill to get here from there--and the accrued penalties
and interest? But then, just imagine the number of frequent-flier
miles in 7,000 light-years.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Now Unsure of Iraqi Tie to Sept. 11</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Investigators retreat from assertion that lead
hijacker met with a Baghdad agent.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>U.S. investigators say they no longer believe that suicide hijacker
Mohamed Atta met with an Iraqi intelligence agent in Europe last
year, eliminating the only known link between Saddam Hussein's
government and the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   American and Czech officials had believed that the meetings
between Atta, the alleged ringleader of the 19 hijackers, and Ahmad
Khalil Ibrahim Samir Ani, an Iraqi diplomat believed to be an
intelligence agent, took place in Prague, the Czech capital, in April
2001.</LD>
<LD>   Some observers said the meetings suggested Iraq's complicity in
the Sept. 11 attacks--providing the United States with a reason to
attack Hussein. The Iraqi government denied that the meetings ever
occurred and charged that the reports were fabricated to justify
making Iraq a target in the U.S.-led war on terror.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. officials said the content of the alleged meetings was never
definitively laid out. Some Czech officials said Atta had contacted
Ani, who was later expelled from the Czech Republic, to discuss an
attack on the Prague building that serves as the headquarters for
U.S.-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.</TE>
<TE>   But Czech authorities have since retracted their statements to the
U.S. government, saying that no such meetings took place. Atta is now
believed to have been in the United States when he was supposed to
have been meeting with Ani, said a U.S. official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials have established numerous ties between the
hijackers and Al Qaeda, but none to Iraq's government. Similar
efforts to link terrorist leader Osama bin Laden to Hussein have
yielded few results.</TE>

<LD>   North Korea denied that it had invited former President Bill
Clinton to visit and help cool off U.S. rhetoric toward the communist
state.</LD>
<LD>   A North Korean official told Reuters on Monday that the North's
leader, Kim Jong Il, hoped that Clinton could play a mediating role.</LD>
<TE>   In a statement Tuesday, the North Korean Foreign Ministry denied
issuing such an invitation. ''Reuters of Britain reported that [the
North] has invited former U.S. President Clinton to Pyongyang. In
this regard, we make it clear that no such invitation has been
made,'' said the statement, issued by the state-run Korea Central
News Agency.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Leaders Get to Know Who's Hu</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: The Chinese vice president, in line to succeed
Jiang Zemin at the helm, makes the rounds in Washington.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN and ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Chinese Vice President Hu Jintao began a series of meetings Tuesday
to get acquainted with top U.S. officials in anticipation of his
selection as China's leader.</LD>
<LD>   Hu, 59, met with congressional leaders of both parties on Capitol
Hill shortly after arriving in Washington. He also met one-on-one
with Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Don
Evans before holding a working dinner with Secretary of State Colin
L. Powell.</LD>
<LD>   Today, Hu is scheduled to meet with President Bush at the White
House. The men first met in February, when they shared a stage at
Qinghua University in Beijing, where Bush delivered a speech.</LD>
<TE>   Hu also will meet with Vice President Dick Cheney and will become
the highest-ranking Chinese official to visit the Pentagon when he
calls on Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld.</TE>
<TE>   Largely unknown outside China, Hu is a relatively youthful figure
among China's aging leaders. He became a prominent player in 1992,
during the rule of the late Deng Xiaoping.</TE>
<TE>   Hu's most notable job before becoming vice president was as head
of the Communist Party in Tibet when martial law was declared in 1989
to put down unrest there.</TE>
<TE>   American officials have been eager to size Hu up, and his visit to
the United States amounts to something of a diplomatic coming-out
party.</TE>
<TE>   The status of Taiwan is a key issue in Sino-U.S. relations. China
regards the island as a renegade province; the United States long has
called for a peaceful resolution of the matter but has pledged to
defend Taiwan, if necessary.</TE>
<TE>   There is a growing sense in China that the United States has
tilted too far in favor of Taiwan, said Minxin Pei, senior associate
at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.</TE>
<TE>   Relations between Washington and Beijing deteriorated in 1999
because of the accidental bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade,
Yugoslavia, by U.S. warplanes during the Kosovo conflict. They
worsened a year ago when a Chinese fighter jet collided with a U.S.
reconnaissance plane off the Chinese coast, forcing the American
plane and its crew to make an emergency landing on China's Hainan
island. After a tense standoff, China released the U.S. crew.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has visited China twice since then and seemed to get along
reasonably well with Chinese President Jiang Zemin. Jiang is
scheduled to visit the United States in October.</TE>
<TE>   On Capitol Hill, Hu received a cordial welcome Tuesday from the
congressional leaders, who expressed a desire for better relations.</TE>
<TE>   "Our message was: Let's keep ... developing the relationship that
we both want, both economically as well as diplomatically," Senate
Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) told reporters. "There's a lot
more we have in common than we have . . . in disagreement."</TE>
<TE>   Hu met with 16 senators for about an hour. One source present at
the meeting said Hu also stressed that the two nations' common
interests outweigh their differences.</TE>
<TE>   Congress passed a law in 2000 making normal trade relations
between the United States and China permanent. But many lawmakers
also strongly support Taiwan--as does Bush--and are harsh critics of
China's human rights record.</TE>
<TE>   Some on Capitol Hill also have called for sanctions against China
if it does not take steps to halt the proliferation of weapons of
mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   On the House side, Minority Whip Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), a
frequent critic of China's human rights record, said of Hu: "We have
to give him a chance to see what he's going to do. There's nothing in
his record that would give me reason to celebrate right now"--a
reference to Hu's service in Tibet.</TE>
<TE>   Hu arrived in the United States on Saturday. In Honolulu, he
toured Pearl Harbor and laid a wreath at the Arizona Memorial.</TE>
<TE>   After stopping in San Francisco, he went on to New York, where he
met with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and former Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger.</TE>
<TE>   Hu is scheduled to take over leadership of the Chinese Communist
Party in the fall and to become president next spring.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Nick Anderson contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Colombia Rebels Indicted in Deaths of 3 Americans</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: The FARC and six of its members are accused of
abducting and killing human rights workers in 1999.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>U.S. authorities, vowing to expand their hunt for terrorists to a
global stage, indicted a notorious Colombian rebel group and six of
its members Tuesday in the kidnapping and murder of three American
human rights workers in 1999.</LD>
<LD>   The indictment charges that leaders of the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, known by the Spanish acronym FARC, murdered the
three Americans as part of a campaign of violence and mayhem directed
against Americans who were suspected of aiding the U.S. military.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, the three victims--including a young man from
Oakland--were visiting a remote violence-torn region in northeastern
Colombia to lend environmental and educational assistance to the U'wa
Indian tribe. The murders of the workers outraged the United States
and prompted it to cut off tentative peace talks with the FARC,
Colombia's largest rebel faction.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. officials said none of the six FARC members implicated in the
murders, including German Briceno, a rebel commander and the brother
of FARC's chief military strategist, are in custody. Nor is it clear
whether Colombia would agree to extradite the rebels to the United
States if any of them are ever captured.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts suggested that the U.S. indictment would have little
more than symbolic impact, but Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft said the
charges send a strong signal about U.S. determination to capture
terrorists around the world.</TE>
<TE>   "Today's indictment reminds us in no uncertain terms of where the
path of terrorism ultimately leads--to lost lives and families
decimated," Ashcroft told reporters. "Today the United States strikes
back at FARC's reign of terror against the United States and its
citizens. Just as we fight terrorism in the mountains of South Asia,
we will fight terrorism in our own hemisphere."</TE>
<TE>   The indictment charges that the FARC and its leaders, branding
U.S. citizens in Colombia as "military advisors" and "legitimate
military targets," abducted Ingrid Washinawatok, Laheenae Gay and
Terence Freitas, who was from Oakland, as they left the U'wa
territory on Feb. 25, 1999.</TE>
<TE>   FARC leaders maintained radio communications with the abductors,
instructing that the three Americans be kept in custody and that
"those that don't pay get their heads chopped off," according to the
indictment.</TE>
<TE>   Days later, each activist was shot in the head multiple times, and
the bodies were dumped across the river in Venezuela.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Shifter, a Colombian expert who is vice president for
policy at the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington think tank, said
that, as a practical matter, the chances were remote that the
indicted rebels would be taken into custody from within the FARC's
strongholds.</TE>
<TE>   More troubling, he said, is the impact that the indictment could
have on efforts to achieve peace in war-torn Colombia by further
inflaming the country's fragile political discourse.</TE>
<TE>   "Does it really move along any political solution in Colombia? Or
does it just make the United States feel good to show its toughness
against terrorists?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Thomas Umberg, a senior drug-policy aide in the Clinton White
House who worked extensively on Colombian issues, said the indictment
"properly classifies these rebels as criminals. It's important that
the FARC and other terrorist organizations understand that when you
target and kill American citizens, the U.S. is not going to sweep it
under the rug."</TE>
<TE>   Colombia has already convicted Briceno, the FARC commander, in
absentia and sentenced him to 40 years in prison in connection with
the three murders.</TE>
<TE>   Luiz Alberto Moreno Mejia, Colombian ambassador to the United
States, acknowledged in an interview that "Colombia wants him for
other charges. It would be hard for me to say" if officials in Bogota
would agree to extradite him to the United States.</TE>

<DH>Russia: Network of farms pays mostly in coupons to ensure
that workers don't drink up their paychecks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN DIXON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MUNDYR, Russia</DL>
<LD>The milkmaids were drunk, and not for the first time. Lyubov, a
widow, was crying, and Svetlana had passed the rowdy stage, her eyes
alight with anger, her tongue sharp and abusive.</LD>
<LD>   Solemn, round-eyed children circled them gently, intervening when
the women got out of hand, covering their mouths with small hands,
restraining flailing fists, or pushing them back into their chairs.</LD>
<LD>   With an hour to go till milking time, the last bottle of vodka was
gone and the grimy table before them was bare except for a can piled
high with the remnants of cheap Russian cigarettes.</LD>
<TE>   Lyubov Ryzhakova, 32, and Svetlana Kulakova, 28, did not turn up
for the milking that afternoon late in February, but their children
would not go hungry.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the milkmaids in this central Russian village wanted to
spend all their pay on vodka, they could not. Workers for the local
collective farm in Mundyr, about 480 miles east of Moscow, and in
nine nearby settlements linked to the farm are not paid in cash.
Instead, they receive coupons they can redeem at farm-run stores that
sell basic goods--but not alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   "I've lived in the past without bread at all because I have a low
salary," said Ryzhakova, who favors the system. "Now I have bread to
feed my children."</TE>
<TE>   "Everything will grind to a halt if the milkmaids all start
drinking," said the collective's director, 54-year-old Ivan
Matantsev. "It will all go downhill."</TE>
<TE>   Mundyr is only one of many rural communities where Russians have
introduced tough, at times desperate, anti-alcohol measures.</TE>
<TE>   In Surinda, a remote settlement in Siberia, the residents took a
vow of sobriety. In Verkhny Zhirim, also in Siberia, and in Durakovo,
12 miles south of Moscow, villagers can get free treatment for
alcoholism. Authorities in Sofiyevka, in central Russia, even flogged
a man for alcohol abuse, according to a report in August in the
national daily Obshchaya Gazeta.</TE>
<TE>   When Matantsev ordered the Mundyr collective's three stores to
halt alcohol sales in 1996, productivity went up. The farm survived
an economic crisis afflicting rural Russia and even expanded--though
it still does not generate enough cash to pay all its workers.</TE>
<TE>   But with 600 cows and 105 workers, it is still on its feet, unlike
most others in the region. People may have little, but they are
consoled by the fact that they are much better off than other
villages nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Matantsev did conduct an "experiment" in July by paying the
workers in Mundyr in cash.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone immediately went out and got drunk," he said. "They used
up their month's salaries in a week. A couple of wives went to the
superintendent and said their husbands were drunk and their children
were hungry.</TE>
<TE>   "The superintendent said: 'Don't bring any more money here. Let's
go back to the old system.' "</TE>
<TE>   So the coupons returned. People still drink, but Matantsev says
their lack of cash restrains alcohol abuse.</TE>
<TE>   To some families, the change hasn't made a lot of difference. On
top of the cupboard in Tatiana Manin's front room in Mundyr lay a
dusty accordion, usually a symbol of joy and good company in Russia.
Here, it seemed to cast a curse.</TE>
<TE>   Its owner was out. Manin, 39, sat chin in hand, conveying as much
pain with her hesitations as she did with her halting words.</TE>
<TE>   A fellow with an accordion is the life of the party at any Russian
gathering. But Manin's husband, Nikolai, 41, turned into a drunkard.
He may get alcohol by trading his pay coupon to an illegal vodka
seller.</TE>
<TE>   A tractor driver by trade, he shrugged off his relatively
high-paying and responsible job to be a farm laborer for 780 rubles
($25) a month. His wife makes 600 rubles ($19).</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know where he gets the money for alcohol. It causes
arguments in the family. He gets angry," she sighed.</TE>
<TE>   Her 17-year-old son, Alexei, sat slumped, mesmerized by cartoons
dancing soundlessly on the TV. He dreams of being drafted at 18 so he
can leave home and fight in Russia's bloody Chechen conflict.</TE>
<TE>   In the dark, squat barn in the neighboring village of Gorlovo,
with 90 cows lowing to be fed and the pungent smell of manure in the
air, it is difficult to put oneself in the cheap rubber shoes of the
women scurrying about, hauling buckets of feed. They begin milking at
4 a.m. and milk again at 5 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   It was in the early 1990s, as cash dried up amid a national
economic decline and Russian enterprises were forced to barter goods,
that the collective introduced its coupon system in Gorlovo. It
exchanged milk and meat for processed foodstuffs to stock its stores,
and it also avoided cash outlays for salaries, so it could afford to
set up its own bakery and milk-processing facilities. Now, as then,
workers can get cash for special purchases or emergencies.</TE>
<TE>   The relative discipline and order that resulted reflect the
yearning Russians often express for a "strong hand" to guide and
control them. Besides standing behind the coupon system, Matantsev
has sent a dozen local men to be "coded" against alcohol by having
their bodies implanted with "torpedoes"--capsules of teturam that
cause nausea and fear if the men drink. More severe reactions can
include heart failure and death.</TE>
<TE>   Mornings, the store at Gorlovo is crammed as people line up for
herring, flour, bread, sausage, macaroni, wheat, soap in a brown
block, raspy gray toilet paper and cookies with the texture of
compressed sawdust. There is only one brand of cigarettes, the cheap,
high-tar Russian Prima.</TE>
<TE>   The store eschews non-Russian products, saleswoman Svetlana
Beloborodova told some foreign visitors in a tart tone as she added
up customers' bills on an abacus and copied the totals by hand into a
fat accounts book.</TE>
<TE>   She sawed a log of pink sausage. Reaching for shampoo for a
customer, she inquired: "Which do you want? Pink or green?"</TE>
<TE>   Outside, Alexander Pavlov, 37, outlined how the coupon system
makes it easier to stretch his family's money over a month.</TE>
<TE>   "Only a telegraph pole doesn't drink around here. I'm hung over
now," he confided.</TE>
<TE>   Pavlov had boasted of making 4,000 rubles ($129) a month as part
of a timber team, but that was either a lie or a delusion. He gave up
drink for six months in order to join the team, Matantsev said, but
fell off the wagon in January and was fired.</TE>
<TE>   Out at the farm's logging site, low clouds scurried across a
pearly sky and the wind hurled snow in playful handfuls. A tree
trembled for a second in midair after a hefty chain saw had cut
through its base. Then it fell to the forest floor with a majestic
bow.</TE>
<TE>   "Accidents happen even to sober people," said Matantsev,
explaining Pavlov's dismissal. "A person has to be in control or a
tree might fall on him."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Pavlov spent the day with a bottle of vodka--his fourth
day of bingeing. He was spotted that evening, another bottle under
his arm, on his way home from the cottage of illegal vodka seller
Galina Belikova.</TE>
<TE>   "It took me all day to drink that bottle," he said. "I felt sick
at heart. I felt ugly in my soul, and I needed to go get a drink."</TE>
<TE>   Rambling on sheepishly, full of plans to approach Matantsev about
getting back to work, he blamed himself for another wasted day.
Everyone knows the houses hereabouts where cheap vodka is illegally
sold. They have a collective nickname, "The Pit." Knock on the gate
at Belikova's and a little square window pops open. For 30 rubles
($1), there's your bottle and escape for the night.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not the only ones," giggled Belikova's adopted daughter,
Yevgenia Smirnova, 18. "It's how we survive. It pays well. My mother
doesn't work."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, the girl acknowledged, village wives or even the farm
director have arrived on the doorstep, angry about drunken husbands
or farm workers.</TE>
<TE>   There is something patronizing about a pay system that treats
workers as children. But most concede that it helps them manage their
scarce resources.</TE>
<TE>   Alexei Smirnov, a 24-year-old timber cutter who is missing a
tooth, stood in the bitter wind with no gloves, ragged trousers and a
hole in one boot. He said he was sure his wife would squander his pay
on earrings if she could spend as she pleased.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all about psychology. If you have cash, women, more than
men, are tempted to spend it all on things they don't need," said
Smirnov, who never does the daily food shopping.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say that with workers having to rely on the farm shops, no
matter how grim the selection, the collective keeps money in its own
coffers.</TE>
<TE>   "If the card system goes and there's cash on hand, it means the
money goes somewhere else and not back to the collective farm," said
Anatoly Shishko of Mundyr. "There's a feeling they keep us on a
hook."</TE>
<TE>   The single competing shop in Gorlovo, partly privatized and not
owned by the farm, operates at a loss. As saleswoman at the only
legal outlet for vodka, Valentina Bolshakova, 43, knows the village
drunks all too well.</TE>
<TE>   "If a man's sober and has money in his hands, of course I'll sell
[vodka] to him," she said. "It's his choice. With the coupon system,
at least the kids will have something to eat."</TE>
<TE>   Farm director Matantsev, who has an old-fashioned collective
mentality and strongly disapproves of privatization, speaks darkly of
the "dubious freedoms" of the post-Communist era.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, we have democracy today, and any alcoholic and any
loafer and any lazybones has the same rights as a farm director. I
can't stop them from going and getting drunk. That's the law," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not just fighting against alcohol. I'm fighting for life, for
survival."</TE>
<TE>   Alexei V. Kuznetsov of The Times' Moscow Bureau contributed to
this report.</TE>

<HD>Anti-Terror Effort to Begin in Georgia</HD>
<DH>Caucasus: The first of 150 U.S. troops arrive in the former
Soviet republic for operations to start this month.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TBILISI, Georgia</DL>
<LD>U.S. troops launched operations Tuesday in the former Soviet republic
of Georgia to train local forces in anti-terrorism tactics--the
latest step in the worldwide campaign against terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   Eighteen Americans arrived overnight in Tbilisi, the Georgian
capital, the first of 150 special operations troops involved in the
deployment. The rest are to arrive in the coming weeks, with training
operations to get underway this month.</LD>
<LD>   "We are initial representatives for the initial setup operation,"
said one of the soldiers, Lt. Col. Doug Baker.</LD>
<TE>   The $64-million training program is part of Washington's worldwide
campaign against terrorism and is similar to U.S. anti-terrorist
training for forces in the Philippines.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials fear that Muslim fighters holed up in Georgia's
Pankisi Gorge--which borders the breakaway Russian region of
Chechnya--could be linked to Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist
network. The remote gorge is home to many people who have fled
fighting in Chechnya, and Russian and Georgian officials say
militants have mixed in among the refugees.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia had requested help from the United States in battling the
insurgents, angering many Russian officials, who feared another U.S.
deployment into a former Soviet republic. U.S. troops are already
stationed in former Soviet Central Asian nations near Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not terrible for Russia or for our other neighbors," said
Georgian President Eduard A. Shevardnadze, well known in Russia as
foreign minister under ex-Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.</TE>
<TE>   Some Russian military officials were also insulted that Georgia
turned to the United States after rejecting offers of help from
Russian forces.</TE>
<TE>   But Russian President Vladimir V. Putin has reacted calmly to the
U.S. project. On Tuesday, Valery Lastovsky, Russia's military attache
in Georgia, told the Interfax news agency that Moscow "feels neither
apprehension nor jealousy" about the U.S. deployment.</TE>
<TE>   The American troops will meet with Georgian Defense Ministry
officials over the next week to set up the training program, the
embassy said.</TE>

<HD>Iraq Ready for Talks on Arms Inspections</HD>
<DH>U.N.: Baghdad sets conditions for allowing teams back in:
It won't bow to threats and wants sanctions ended.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL SLACKMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BAGHDAD</DL>
<LD>Iraqi Foreign Minister Naji Sabri is scheduled to begin talks today
at the United Nations aimed at reaching an agreement to allow weapons
inspectors back into his country--and, from the Iraqis' perspective,
make it a bit harder for the United States to attack their land.</LD>
<LD>   But Iraqis insist that they will not bow to threats and will allow
inspectors to return only as part of a comprehensive deal to end more
than 11 years of economic sanctions and restore their nation's
territorial integrity. The United States and Britain still enforce
"no-fly" zones over northern and southern Iraq and regularly report
airstrikes against Iraqi military targets. "Iraq is saying the issue
is not inspections teams," said A.K. Hashimi, an advisor to the
government of President Saddam Hussein. "It is the issue of sanctions
and everything all together. If they say, 'Inspectors come back, then
we will discuss the other issues,' we say no."</LD>
<TE>   Teams Evacuated in 1998</TE>
<TE>   Before U.S. Airstrikes</TE>
<TE>   The issue of weapons inspectors returning to Iraq has been in
limbo since December 1998, when teams were evacuated ahead of U.S.
airstrikes designed to force greater Iraqi compliance. Iraq has since
refused to let them return. But with Washington talking about using
its military might to oust Hussein from power as part of the U.S. war
on global terrorism, the issue has become increasingly important to
both sides.</TE>
<TE>   If Iraq refuses to let the inspectors in, the U.S. could use the
move as a pretext for military strikes. If Iraq lets them in, the
U.S. has one less issue to settle.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they [the Iraqis] might very well accept the return of
inspection teams--but they will demand some kind of time limit," said
Wamidh Nadhmi, 60, a political science lecturer at the University of
Baghdad. "I don't think they can refuse."</TE>
<TE>   Iraq was saddled with international economic sanctions after it
invaded Kuwait in 1990. After its defeat by a U.S.-led coalition
during the 1991 Persian Gulf War, Iraq was forced to allow in teams
of inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   Their goal was to determine whether Hussein's regime had destroyed
all of its weapons of mass destruction and its ability to produce
more. Sanctions would be removed when inspectors certified that their
job was completed.</TE>
<TE>   The United States and Britain insist that Iraq obstructed the
inspectors, and Iraq insists that the West used the issue as an
excuse to keep the sanctions in place, year after year. "You know
what the issue is," Hashimi said. "They want to change the system of
government in Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   This week, Iraq is celebrating Hussein's 65th birthday with
parades, demonstrations and exhibitions. New statues of the president
are going up all over Baghdad, the capital. The celebration goes
beyond paying homage to what is being called here the president's
"auspicious birthday." It's part of the brave face Iraq is trying to
present to the world.</TE>
<TE>   The United States talks about invading, and this impoverished
country--which can't even supply all of its people with clean
drinking water--talks about military victory. Its people say they are
resigned to a military strike no matter what they do.</TE>
<TE>   "I think you know very well that Iraq with its civilization, Iraq
with its leadership, brave and wise, Iraq with its own inherent
capabilities, it will know how to defend itself and defeat the
aggressor for sure as it has done before," Iraqi Oil Minister Amir
Rashid Mohammed Ubaydi said at a recent news briefing.</TE>
<TE>   But officials here also know that Iraq is just getting by. Life is
better than it has been in years, but that is still pretty tough. A
U.N.-approved "oil for food" program--which allows Iraq to sell oil
despite the sanctions, with the proceeds used to feed its people--is
designed to help meet basic nutritional needs, not to redevelop the
country.</TE>
<TE>   The sanctions have begun to break down, and in Baghdad a sort of
middle class has reemerged that has benefited from smuggling
operations. But teachers still earn about $5 a month. Government
engineers get paid maybe $15 a month. Yet it costs $2 to buy a
chicken in the market.</TE>
<TE>   Most Iraqis survive on free food distributed by nongovernmental
organizations, with the Middle Eastern nation's 24 million people
getting monthly food baskets with $24.50 worth of staples.</TE>
<TE>   A Western attack could easily send Iraq back into a tailspin.</TE>
<TE>   "If suddenly, for one reason or another, the country, or a pocket
of the country, doesn't have access to this food basket for some
time, we can have a big problem," said Carel de Rooy, the UNICEF
representative in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq Seeks Allies, but Knows It Is Alone</TE>
<TE>   The regime knows this, and though it has put forth a stiff upper
lip, it also has been trying to insulate itself from a military
attack by seeking allies in the region. But in the end, Iraq knows
that it is alone, that the streets of the Arab world might ignite if
it is attacked, but that Arab governments are not about to come to
its rescue, at least not with troops.</TE>
<TE>   Even Russia, which has been a close ally and is a permanent member
of the U.N. Security Council, has said weapons inspectors must be
allowed back.</TE>
<TE>   "The world community should be absolutely sure
that mass-destruction weapons cannot be produced on the territory of
Iraq," Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Saltanov was quoted
by the Itar-Tass news agency as saying Monday. "Monitoring should be
resumed on the Iraqi territory."</TE>
<TE>   With this as the backdrop, a defiant yet nervous Iraq looks to
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to help craft a compromise during
meetings with Foreign Minister Sabri, amid worries about the American
stance.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't like my president, that's their problem," Hashimi
said. "And when they don't like him, I love him more."</TE>

<HD>N. Korea to Resume Contacts With U.S.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>North Korea has accepted a U.S. invitation to hold talks on curbing
its missile program and military exports, the White House said
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "We anticipate these talks will begin," Press Secretary Ari
Fleischer told reporters in California. "The United States will work
to determine the timing and other details in the coming days."</LD>
<LD>   President Bush had proposed talks "without preconditions" between
the two governments in June, but until now North Korean leader Kim
Jong Il had ignored the invitation.</LD>
<TE>   The possibility of such talks seemed remote after Bush, in his
State of the Union address in January, labeled North Korea part of an
"axis of evil" whose aspirations to develop and possibly spread
weapons of mass destruction loomed as a global menace.</TE>
<TE>   But in recent months, the reclusive Asian nation has noticeably
opened up to the outside, hosting several prominent visitors,
including Indonesian President Megawati Sukarnoputri and Donald P.
Gregg, a former U.S. ambassador to South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea's agreement to resume direct contacts with Washington
was not unexpected; the Communist regime had indicated during a
recent meeting with a South Korean envoy that it was interested in
doing so. But the Bush administration withheld comment until it heard
directly from the North.</TE>
<TE>   The likely U.S. representative to the talks will be Jack
Pritchard, a State Department expert on the Korean peninsula,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear where the meetings will take place. The North
Korean offer, conveyed to the State Department by the regime's
mission at the United Nations, suggested Pyongyang, the North's
capital. Fleischer made no reference to the site.</TE>
<TE>   A resumption of direct dialogue between the U.S. and the North may
bode well for South Korean President Kim Dae Jung's nearly moribund
"sunshine policy" of engagement.</TE>
<TE>   Hopes of a rapprochement had soared after Kim's historic trip to
Pyongyang in June 2000, but the two sides have made little progress
since.</TE>
<TE>   Plagued by years of famine and increasingly desperate for hard
currency, North Korea could reap economic benefits from the U.S. in
exchange for curbing its development and export of weapons of mass
destruction.</TE>
<TE>   The last official and high-ranking U.S.-North Korean contact was
in October 2000, when then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
visited Pyongyang. Those talks focused on North Korea curbing its
weapons proliferation program in exchange for two light-water nuclear
reactors.</TE>

<HD>Poison Hidden in a Letter May Have Killed Rebel in Chechnya</HD>
<DH>Russia: Reports suggest that the Arab guerrilla, one of
Moscow's chief enemies in the separatist republic, succumbed to a
toxin hidden in a letter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>It is a time-tested way to dispose of enemies. Now a prominent
Chechen Web site and some newspapers here are suggesting that a
fast-acting poison hidden in a letter was the instrument used in
March to kill one of Russia's chief enemies: an Arab guerrilla named
Khattab.</LD>
<LD>   If so, it would resurrect a method of assassination often used in
czarist times and by the former Soviet Union.</LD>
<LD>   The Russian Federal Security Service, or FSB, announced Thursday
that Khattab--one of the country's most wanted foes and a prominent
rebel in the separatist republic of Chechnya--had been killed in late
March in the Chechen mountains through an unspecified "special
operation."</LD>
<TE>   The next night, FSB officials released a videotape of what
appeared to be the corpse of Khattab, a bushy-bearded warrior accused
by the Russians of being the Chechens' conduit to the terror
organization of Osama bin Laden. He was shown laid out on the ground,
surrounded by comrades, dressed in T-shirt and camouflage pants, with
no evident wounds on his body.</TE>
<TE>   A Web site used to distribute news from Chechen guerrillas, who
are seeking independence from Russia, acknowledged Monday that
Khattab--generally known by that one name--had indeed been
assassinated.</TE>
<TE>   "According to information from the headquarters of the Chechen
moujahedeen, Amir Khattab was poisoned on March 19 by a letter that
was brought to him by a messenger," said the Kavkaz Center site,
www.kavkaz.org.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been established precisely that Khattab was poisoned by
that letter," the statement continued. "Khattab knew the messenger
who brought the letter," and the assailant is now believed to be with
the Russians, it added.</TE>
<TE>   Russian newspapers were quick to take up the theme Tuesday that
Khattab had been poisoned, suggesting that the FSB had played a role
in stoking rivalries within the rebel camp until Khattab was betrayed
by one of his own comrades.</TE>
<TE>   Another report said that Khattab, who was believed to have been
born in Jordan or Saudi Arabia, was done in by Jordanian intelligence
agents and Chechens, with hardly any connivance on the Russian side.</TE>
<TE>   "In the opinion of extremists, Khattab died having opened a
poisoned letter delivered to him by someone from his closest
entourage," the newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta reported Tuesday.
"Khattab was betrayed by his own people, which ... does not rule out
a secret operation carefully planned by the FSB, cleverly making use
of the incredible discord among bandit formations."</TE>
<TE>   Russian officials were noncommittal when asked about the possible
poisoning. "To what extent is the poisoning version credible? I
personally am accustomed to disbelieving everything I hear on
Chechnya and about Chechnya until I hold fully reliable proof of
something right in my hands," said Alexander V. Machevsky, a
spokesman for President Vladimir V. Putin's administration.</TE>
<TE>   "As for the killing of Khattab, it was such a complex operation
that it is impossible to find out exactly," he said, adding that the
FSB is giving no details.</TE>
<TE>   But the reports of poisoning are certainly believable, said Igor
N. Prelin, a retired KGB colonel who worked for nearly 40 years in
Soviet foreign intelligence.</TE>
<TE>   "A poison is a rather convenient means of destroying someone--it
allows the executor to remain at a distance from the target and not
risk his own safety," he observed. "With this in mind, [poisoning]
appears to be a quite acceptable way of liquidating him."</TE>
<TE>   Russian history is rife with episodes of poisoning. Ivan the
Terrible is thought to have poisoned two of his wives. Czar Boris
Godunov is believed to have poisoned Ivan's son. Rasputin was
poisoned, but the mad monk who advised the imperial family of
Nicholas II finally had to be shot and drowned too before he died.</TE>
<TE>   In the Stalin era, the KGB had a special laboratory to produce
poisons for the purpose of assassination, tested on unwitting
convicts to determine which were the most effective.</TE>
<TE>   There have been claims that the writer Maxim Gorky, later lionized
in Soviet propaganda, was in fact poisoned on Stalin's orders.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most famous case in recent times was the 1978
assassination of Georgy I. Markov, Bulgaria's best-known dissident,
who was pricked with a poison-tipped umbrella.</TE>
<TE>   Alexei V. Kuznetsov of The Times' Moscow Bureau contributed to
this report.</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>MOGADISHU, Somalia</DL>
<LD>Seven people were killed and at least 30 were wounded in gun battles
between guards and looters when a fire swept through the main market
in Mogadishu, the Somali capital, residents said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Market guards traded fire with hundreds of militiamen seeking to
steal goods after the fire started late Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "The ... noise of the bullets could be heard around the capital;
the flames and fumes were visible from all parts of the city," one
resident said.</LD>
<TE>   Chaos reigned in the market area as residents lacking even basic
firefighting equipment tried in vain to beat back the flames.</TE>
<TE>   Units of militiamen loyal to Somalia's transitional government,
whose influence extends over only parts of the capital, tried to ward
off looters by using pickup trucks mounted with machine guns.</TE>
<TE>   The fire started in a fuel store and spread to sections selling
paint, clothes and honey, as well as stalls trading in fake passports
and land ownership documents.</TE>
<TE>   Somalia has been in the grip of chaos since the ouster of military
ruler Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991. Rival warlords compete for
resources and influence. A transitional assembly was set up after a
meeting of clan elders in 2000 to try to reconcile the country's
warring factions, but it controls only sections of the capital and
other pieces of territory.</TE>

<LD>Re "4 Jewish Settlers Killed in Attack," April 28: Too bad you chose
to place the pictures of Danielle Shefi and her Pooh bear on Page
A14, where the story continued. They should have been on the front
page. That surely would have shown the world what terrorism is about.
This little girl was not killed in a military action. She was killed
by an Arab who looked at her tiny being and shot her dead.</LD>
<LD>   In "Violence in Mideast Galvanizes U.S. Jews" someone suggests
that Ariel Sharon and Yasser Arafat sit down and share pictures of
their grandchildren. I don't think that would help, because Arafat
would believe that his grandchild was better off dead and in a
special place in heaven. I do believe that the Palestinians love
their children. What they don't respect is life. The conflicts will
end when the Arabs value life more than they hate Jews. Today I cried
for Danielle and her family. I only hope that somehow her death may
help bring peace.</LD>

<TE>   I find President Bush's statement that "we will not allow Israel
to be crushed" (April 27) a tragically ironic choice of words; in
fact it is some dozen Palestinian villages that have been crushed to
rubble by Israeli tanks, shells and bulldozers, along with innocent,
noncombatant Palestinians actually crushed to death inside their own
homes.</TE>

<TE>   It is unremarkable that Yaffa Yarkoni, Israel's revered singer,
should make hypercritical statements about the Israel Defense Forces'
responses to Palestinian homicidal bombers (April 29). It is equally
unremarkable that Israeli citizens, politicians and armed forces
personnel publicly condemn or support these statements. What is
remarkable is that this publicly debated controversy exists in the
Middle East openly without fear of the assassination, incarceration,
public execution or disappearance of the protagonists as is practiced
in every other country surrounding the only free-speech-loving
democracy in that part of the world.</TE>

<TE>   As an anguished American Jew, trying to muster the strength to
speak out, I was heartened by the courage of entertainer Yarkoni.
Sadly, in the rush to defile her, the very people who revel in the
old adage "two Jews, three opinions" have been reduced to just one
very narrow one.</TE>

<LD>"U.S. Economy Surges 5.8% in First Quarter" (April 27) asks, "Is
business finally taking the load off consumers, whose spending has
kept the economy afloat in the last year, and resuming the kind of
fast-paced investment that fueled much of the late-1990s boom?</LD>
<LD>   "We still don't know whether the baton has been passed from
consumers to business," one influential economist said. Reading that,
one might believe that there have been periods when our economy has
shifted from being "demand-sided" to "supply-sided."</LD>
<LD>   Balderdash! I defy anyone to produce statistics from a single year
in the history of the U.S. during which business expenditures have
exceeded consumer spending. No company--let alone the entire
economy--can afford to stay in business if it is selling its goods or
services for less than they cost. Approximately two-thirds of the
gross domestic product has always been--and a majority must always
be--personal consumption expenditures by households; the remaining
one-third of economic activity has historically been divided almost
equally between business and government spending.</LD>

<LD>Re "Bush to Campaign for Simon in State," April 28: President Bush is
in California for the next couple of days to help raise $3 million
for Republican coffers. Last week he was in Crawford, Texas, and the
week before that he was all over the Midwest helping Republican
candidates who want to run for Congress.</LD>

basis when the president decides to go mobile?</LD>

<TE>   So, Dubya comes to California because he wants us to support his
party and possibly his own campaign by electing Bill Simon Jr., who
was not his choice for governor. Not so long ago we really needed
Dubya to visit us. We needed help with our severe energy crisis,
partly brought on by his friends, cronies and contributors. Bush,
however, refused. I'm no big fan of Gov. Gray Davis, but I plan on
sending Bush a message by not voting for Simon. Note to Mr. Bush:
Stay home!</TE>

yadda yadda yadda. Now could we have an article that mentions women
like me, who would rather bite their fingers off than vote for Davis?
Women who support equal rights for unborn women as well, and who
don't want to see 1.3 million children die each year?</TE>

<TE>   Go, Davis, go! Expose Simon for what he is--an audacious candidate
with a moral concern about a woman's right to choose (and let's
finish the sentence) the extermination of her innocent, unwanted
child. Your desperate campaign has finally found a little leg to
stand on, courtesy of the lives of countless unborn babies.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Best Friends, Like It or Not" (editorial, April 27) asserts that
"Americans are, shall we say, not famous for their sensitivities
toward foreign cultures." The Times is, shall we say, famous for its
elitist nonsense, like the statement above. The United States is a
nation of immigrants and children of immigrants. Americans are
supremely sensitive to foreign cultures, while foreigners, to their
detriment, are ignorant of ours.</LD>
<LD>   In the U.S., schoolchildren are taught as a matter of policy about
foreign societies, cultures and customs. Most Americans are
intermarried in a kaleidoscope of ethnicities, races, religions and
cultures. Even the bulk of the most honorable Americans--those who
put their Americanism above their personal ethnic roots--strive to
maintain a relationship to their ancestry. It is editorial writers
spouting myths and jealous foreigners whose homogeneous populations
cannot match American tolerance and prosperity who spread the fiction
that Americans are not sensitive to foreign cultures.</LD>

<LD>Regarding the new, drafted rule that would permit coal and hard-rock
mining companies to continue piling leftover rock and dirt into
nearby streams and valleys (April 26), Environmental Protection
Agency Administrator Christie Whitman remarked, "It's not a giveaway
to the mining industry. It doesn't allow activity that isn't already
underway."</LD>
<LD>   Well! How many other practices should we allow because that's the
way they're being done, regardless of damage? When something is
wrong, saying it's the usual practice doesn't make it right. Wake up,
Ms. Whitman! Who wants their nearby streams and valleys choked with
dirt and debris?</LD>

<LD>Re "Vote for Secession Won't Split Up L.A. Unified," April 29: In
your article many San Fernando Valley residents were disappointed, as
I was, to learn that the break of the San Fernando Valley from L.A.
would not include a break from the LAUSD. But isn't it really first
necessary to get our Valley out of downtown L.A. so we can then work
on getting our schools out of the district? First a separate city for
the Valley with local control--then a break from the LAUSD would
likely be obtainable. I don't want to have to listen to the LAUSD's
same sorry excuses for more generations.</LD>

<HD>Father's $100 Fine for Burning Son's Hand</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Burning Son's Hand: $100 Fine," April 23: An Orange County judge
ruled that holding a 5-year-old's hand over an open flame with intent
to burn was OK due to the fact that a) the father's intent was
"discipline," and b) it is Guatemalan custom. Surely the judge knows
that children die each year due to extreme "discipline," and their
parents are held accountable.</LD>
<LD>   But saying that such tactics are "customary" for Guatemalans is
tantamount to saying, "They don't know better." He might as well have
said, "Hey, they only hurt one of their own." Let me ask the judge,
if that father "didn't know it was wrong" to burn his child's hand,
why did he caution the boy not to tell anyone?</LD>

<TE>   Superior Court Judge James O. Perez is not fit for the bench.
Hesaid, "Maybe it will keep Junior from being one of our customers
downstream," and added that many juvenile criminals start out with
petty thefts. Has he also noticed that many juvenile criminals come
from a background of child abuse?</TE>
<TE>   Judge Perez said, "Hopefully, the child has learned a lesson." Is
that lesson that holding someone's hand over an open flame is
preferable to stealing a stick of gum? The prosecutors said the
father told the boy not to tell anyone about what happened. If this
is the case, then clearly the father knew what he did was wrong. What
human being would feel anything but resentment and rage at being
deliberately burned? The child pays now and society pays later.</TE>

<LD>Re "$459 Million in Cuts Are Considered for Fiscally Strapped L.A.
Schools," April 26: If the board decides to cut the library aide
positions to three hours a day, it will not only close the elementary
school libraries for half the day but also, over time, destroy them.
It is not possible in three hours a day to 1) meet with the library
committee to discuss expenditure of funds; 2) complete book orders,
process new books, check them into the computer and shelve them; 3)
maintain five computers, three software programs, the card catalog
and keep patron files current; 4) check in and out an average of 280
books a day and shelve same; 5) have each classroom visit the library
once a week; 6) read to the kindergartners; 7) remain open at recess
and lunch for research, quiet study and checkout; and 8) repair
books, clean tables, dust shelves and read reviews to keep up to date
with new publications.</LD>
<LD>   I know because I am very busy doing all this in six hours a day. I
challenge LAUSD Supt. Roy Romer and school board members to come to
our library and observe for a day--and then tell me that cutting the
library aide position to three hours will not be detrimental.</LD>

<LD>So state Sen. Jim Brulte (R-Rancho Cucamonga) and Assemblyman Dave
Cox (R-Fair Oaks) see nothing wrong with soliciting funds from Enron
while California is investigating the company for holding its people
hostage ("State GOP Sought Donations From Enron," April 29).
Presumably the state legislators are sent to Sacramento to represent
the people, and presumably they are there to protect the people's
legitimate needs--such as reliable and reasonably priced electric
power. As a price-fixing/power-withholding investigation got down and
dirty, just how vigorous would Brulte and Cox be at digging up
unpleasant information about their benefactor?</LD>

<HD>24-Hour Captivity of 3 Is No Crime, Judge Decides</HD>
<DH>Court: Jurist says the actions of two bail bondsmen who
held the wife of a fugitive and two others were 'outlandish' but not
illegal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARIOT LOUIMA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Superior Court judge ruled Tuesday that two bail agents committed
no crime when they held a woman, her daughter and another man for 24
hours while searching for the woman's husband, who had jumped bail.</LD>
<LD>   Although the actions of Donald Webber and Brian Walsh were
"outlandish, they were not illegal" as the prosecutor suggested, said
Judge Frederick K. Rotenburg at the Alhambra Courthouse. Rotenburg
also dismissed charges that Webber raped the woman.</LD>
<LD>   Webber and Walsh left the courtroom in tears immediately after the
judge's ruling.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm just glad this is over," said Walsh, 25, of Chino Hills.</TE>
<TE>   "This whole thing has been ridiculous from the very beginning,"
said attorney Alvin Michaelson, who represented Walsh.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Philip C. Wojdak said he was disappointed with
the ruling. "It concerns me that people like Mr. Webber are given
carte blanche to go around forcing people to do their bidding," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Jose Cabrera, also known as Rogelio Cruz, and his wife were
arrested in November 2000 in San Bernardino County on suspicion of
transportation and possession of cocaine and heroin. Cabrera was
released on $100,000 bail, the woman on bail of $25,000. She pleaded
guilty and was freed to await sentencing.</TE>
<TE>   Cabrera, however, failed to show up for a court appearance. A
judge issued an arrest warrant and submitted a forfeiture notice to
the bail bond agent.</TE>
<TE>   Webber and Walsh, bail agents employed by an insurance company
retained by bail bondsmen, went to a house in Alhambra on Feb. 15,
2001, in search of Cabrera, and found his wife, her daughter and her
brother, Jorge Leal, who identified himself as Jose Ramirez.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys and prosecutors agreed that Walsh and Webber had
the right to detain the woman and revoke her parole, because she was
out on bail and the men caught her flushing plastic bags of rock
cocaine down the toilet. Some cocaine was discovered elsewhere and
turned over to police.</TE>
<TE>   Wojdak argued, though, that the men overstepped their authority
and the limits of the law by keeping the woman in custody until
Cabrera was captured a day later, instead of turning her over to
police immediately.</TE>
<TE>   The pair also broke the law when they forced the woman to help
them find Cabrera, Wojdak said.</TE>
<TE>   The men acted like "outlaws," Wojdak said. "They are licensed bail
bondsmen and they should know better."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors had charged the men with kidnapping for ransom.
Webber, 32, faced the additional rape charge.</TE>
<TE>   Wojdak acknowledged that DNA evidence taken from the scene did not
match a sample obtained from Webber's blood, but he said Tuesday that
additional tests were pending.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel strongly that I think we should [appeal]," Wojdak said.
"The D.A.'s office and I have to look at the totality of the evidence
to make that determination."</TE>

<HD>Parents Plead for Return of Son</HD>
<DH>Crime: Police have no leads in disappearance of boy, 2, at
San Diego park.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>The mother and stepfather of a 2-year-old boy missing since last week
issued a plaintive plea Tuesday for the boy's kidnapper to let him
go.</LD>
<LD>   Police say they believe the boy was abducted. They said they have
no suspects or leads in the case. On Tuesday, however, they were
searching the Miramar landfill where city garbage is taken.</LD>
<LD>   "Whoever may have taken Jahi, we don't care who you are," said
Tameka Jones, 18, standing beside her husband, Tieray, 23.</LD>
<TE>   "We just want you to return him to his family. Drop him off in a
safe place so that someone can find him and bring him to us."</TE>
<TE>   After making their first appearance before the media, the couple
abruptly turned and left as reporters shouted questions about whether
the stepfather feels responsible for the boy's disappearance because
he left him alone in a public park while he went for a soda.</TE>
<TE>   Tieray Jones has told police that he took Jahi to a public park
Thursday, but left him alone for 15 minutes while he walked 150 yards
to a vending machine. When he returned, Jones said, the boy was gone.</TE>
<TE>   The boy's parents were accompanied by Brenda van Dam, whose
7-year-old daughter, Danielle, was kidnapped from the family home in
February and later found dead. A neighbor has been charged with
kidnapping and murder.</TE>
<TE>   The park, next to a golf course, is an annex of Balboa Park. It
has become a makeshift memorial with stuffed animals, flowers and
messages of condolence. "We've got to keep focused on bringing that
baby home," said Dorothy Williams, who visited the park Tuesday.
"We've just got to stay involved, searching and praying for Jahi."</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of volunteers have come to the Moose Lodge in the adjacent
neighborhood of Golden Hill to be part of the search effort. On
Tuesday, police on horseback searched Florida Canyon, about half a
mile from the park. Among the searchers have been sailors from the
amphibious transport ship Rushmore, based in San Diego. Tameka Jones
is a Navy sailor assigned to the Rushmore and was at sea when her
husband reported Jahi missing.</TE>
<TE>   "We were all in tears when we heard that Jahi was missing," said
Rushmore sailor Vanessa Brooks.</TE>
<TE>   Brenda van Dam announced a Web site dedicated to the case:
www.jahimissing.com.</TE>

<HD>Pressure Builds for Burbank School Board</HD>
<DH>Education: Budget woes and the dismissal of a popular
superintendent have some parents pushing for a recall of five
trustees.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PIERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Someone forgot to budget $1.3 million for special education, a
superintendent dismissed for unknown reasons may sue, a
multimillion-dollar budget deficit threatens jobs, and some parents
are attempting to recall school board members.</LD>
<LD>   No, this is not Los Angeles Unified, but Burbank Unified School
District.</LD>
<LD>   A number of community members, teachers and Burbank city officials
say they are losing confidence in the district's Board of Education,
which may be facing its biggest challenges in a decade.</LD>
<TE>   The controversy comes at a time when Burbank schools are
undergoing more than $100 million in modernization construction and
have experienced three years of rising standardized test scores. All
of its eligible campuses--11 elementary, three middle and two
comprehensive high schools--have been honored as California
Distinguished Schools for their high academic achievement and
community support.</TE>
<TE>   But the district also is facing a $3-million deficit, its largest
in 10 years. With decreasing tax revenues, school districts
nationwide have experienced severe budget shortfalls, most notably
L.A. Unified, which must slash $428 million.</TE>
<TE>   Although Burbank's deficit amounts to only 3% of its $100-million
budget, only $20 million can be restructured to find a solution. The
remaining $80 million is allotted for teacher salaries, which are
specified by contract, and instructional programs, which are
state-mandated, district officials said. The board must finalize its
budget by June 30.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to weather this storm," interim Supt. Greg Bowman said.
"We have an obligation to provide education. It's going to be very
difficult, and it won't come without pain." Possible solutions
include reducing the support staff--secretaries, custodians and
maintenance workers--or cutting school supplies.</TE>
<TE>   The district's board rejected a $700,000 allocation from the city,
viewing it as just a short-term solution, said Burbank City Manager
Robert R. "Bud" Ovrom.</TE>
<TE>   District officials say the financial shortfall resulted from
rising costs for workers' compensation and employee medical
insurance, compounded, according to an annual audit, by mismanagement
in several areas.</TE>
<TE>   A fiscal management team, now disbanded, left the district's
$15-million special education budget short when it neglected to
budget $1.3 million for the 2001-02 year. District officials blame
the oversight on human error.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, David Aponik was dismissed as superintendent, a post
he held for eight years, and offered a job as a school psychologist.</TE>
<TE>   The firing of Aponik, a popular superintendent credited with many
of the district's recent improvements, and the lack of explanation
for his dismissal angered many residents and teachers. The board said
policy prohibited the public discussion of personnel matters.</TE>
<TE>   "No one said we didn't like Dr. Aponik," said school board
President Elena Hubbell. "It became an issue of performance and what
had to be done was best for the district. It can't be a popularity
contest."</TE>
<TE>   The board and Aponik, who have exchanged letters in the local
newspaper, the Burbank Leader, dispute almost every detail
surrounding the dismissal.</TE>
<TE>   Aponik said he was treated maliciously and given no warning, an
allegation that Hubbell denies. Aponik said he was forced to take a
leave of absence. Hubbell said his time off is voluntary.</TE>
<TE>   "If you want to destroy somebody's career, you do what they did to
me," said Aponik, who added he is upset that he won't be able to
confer his 18-year-old daughter's diploma as superintendent at
graduation this year.</TE>
<TE>   Aponik filed a claim April 3 against the board, alleging wrongful
termination, denial of civil rights and public humiliation. If a
settlement is not reached by May 18, the 45-day deadline set by law,
Aponik said he probably will sue.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney for the school district, Richard Currier, said the
claim has "no merit whatsoever."</TE>
<TE>   The dispute has galvanized residents, who now fill board meetings
that used to be held in a near-empty auditorium. Some residents,
upset with school district turmoil, are attempting to recall the
five-member school board.</TE>
<TE>   "Those California Distinguished Schools didn't come about because
of our school board," said PTA member Britta Hamrick, one of 10 who
signed a petition to begin the recall effort. "It's because we had a
great leader in Dr. Aponik. The board [members] are almost farcical
figureheads."</TE>
<TE>   A recall effort could take as long as a year and would require
thousands of signatures. With three board members up for election in
a year, the effort may go for naught.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to parents, the Burbank Teachers Assn. voted no
confidence in the board and also is seeking answers in Aponik's
dismissal.</TE>
<TE>   "You think in a smaller school district there would be more
accountability," said the union's co-president, Diana Abasta.</TE>
<TE>   Ovrom said that while Burbank historically has been supportive of
the school district, the board's handling of the superintendent's
dismissal has caused concern among city officials.</TE>
<TE>   "We've done a lot over the years" for the schools, Ovrom said.
"Whether there's the political desire to do that now, I'm not sure."</TE>
<TE>   Mayor David Laurell said the city is willing to provide help as
long as it's viewed as a supplement, not a bailout.</TE>
<TE>   Burbank is looking into offering the school district cheaper
energy rates, Laurell said.</TE>
<TE>   On campuses, it was business as usual this week as the nearly
20,000 district students were taking Stanford 9 standardized tests.</TE>
<TE>   "We're lucky out here at the school site that we're somewhat
removed from the turmoil," said Gail Copeland, principal of Miller
Elementary School and a 41-year veteran of the district.</TE>
<TE>   She said she's confident the district will soon overcome its
current problems.</TE>

<HD>Making Cell Towers Do a Vanishing Act</HD>
<DH>Telecom: A proposal in Aliso Viejo would force antennas to
blend in.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA BORGATTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When it comes to cellular-telephone antennas, officials in the
year-old town of Aliso Viejo have something more fashionable than
faux palm trees, phony water towers and slightly deformed light poles
in mind.</LD>
<LD>   Make the cell towers part of a building.</LD>
<LD>   Cities across the state have struggled for years to regulate the
tall, spindly poles that dot the landscape. Some towns have enacted
ordinances restricting their location or requiring cell-phone
providers to camouflage them. Berkeley and San Marcos were dragged
into court to defend their cell rules--the complaint being that
zoning restrictions have made it impossible for the providers to do
business.</LD>
<TE>   But in Aliso Viejo--an upscale, master-planned community where
appearance seemingly comes first--officials have drawn up a law that
will make cell towers little more than another architectural element
on a building. The City Council is expected to approve the ordinance
tonight. The law would take effect June 1.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the benefits of being in Aliso Viejo is that things look
nice," said Carmen Vali, mayor of the town of 41,000 residents. "If
you start seeing antennas hanging off of buildings or on every other
light pole, or if you see these fake palm trees popping up, it begins
to destroy the look of the community."</TE>
<TE>   The proposal falls short of banning cell-phone sites from any
area--that would be difficult to defend in court because
telecommunications providers are protected by state and federal laws.
But it does recommend enacting strict design guidelines and requiring
providers to share locations--in other words, put their antennas on
buildings and structures where others already exist. More important,
the law would require the companies to figure out a way to make the
equipment look like part of the architecture.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's properly done, you wouldn't even know it's there," said
John Whitman, Aliso Viejo's public-works director.</TE>
<TE>   If that's not possible, the provider would have to locate the
equipment on a roof, hidden from public view.</TE>
<TE>   The law doesn't ban the traditional cell tower. But all other
options would have to be exhausted before the city would give the OK
to build one. "We want the best possible installation for these
sites, and we think the best possible and least intrusive
installations are on existing structures," Whitman said. "We have
fewer monopoles than most cities do, and we hope to keep it that
way."</TE>
<TE>   Sue Ryan, a staff attorney for El Cajon, which passed its
cell-phone ordinance last year, said Aliso Viejo's effort to turn
cell towers into architectural elements appears to be unique.</TE>
<TE>   Aliso Viejo City Atty. Scott Smith said he believes the proposal
is legally bulletproof. In drafting the law, he said, the city tried
to learn from other communities' mistakes.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Area Chamber Opposes Secession as Bad for Business</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARON BERNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce is opposed to secession by
the San Fernando Valley, harbor area and Hollywood because breaking
up the city would be bad for business, the group's president said
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "Secession will do nothing to help our region's ability to deal
with the many complex issues that are facing us," said chamber
President Rusty Hammer.</LD>
<LD>   "By creating new layers of government, new bureaucracies [and]
more elected officials, [secession] will make it much more difficult
to come together on solutions to the problems facing Los Angeles."</LD>
<TE>   Hammer also said that creating smaller cities would make it more
difficult to tackle regional problems, such as transportation and
housing.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn welcomed the chamber's decision.
"Business needs to count on predictability, and what is in the offing
right now is very unpredictable," Hahn said. "Now that we're in the
midst of this [economic] recovery, this is exactly the wrong time to
break up Los Angeles. It could throw us back into a recession."</TE>
<TE>   But Richard Katz, co-chairman of the Valley secession campaign,
said that businesses in the breakaway regions support secession and
believe it would be best for them.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing epitomizes the downtown power structure more than the
L.A. Chamber does," Katz said.</TE>
<TE>   The organization's opposition to secession comes out of a desire
by the powerful to hold onto their influence, more than a concern for
business, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The chamber board plans to announce its decision at a news
conference today.</TE>

<HD>Feinstein Tells Navy to Clean Up El Toro</HD>
<DH>Land use: Extent of tainted soil at the former Marine base
hasn't been determined, says senator in a letter to secretary.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Money raised from the sale of property at the closed El Toro Marine
base should be used to cover the cost of environmental cleanup there,
Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said this week in a letter to
Secretary of the Navy Gordon R. England.</LD>
<LD>   The Navy announced last month it would sell El Toro in accordance
with voter passage in March of new zoning for the base, which calls
for parkland, sports fields, a university campus, wholesale nurseries
and two golf courses. The vote ended Orange County's plans to build a
commercial airport at the site. In its announcement, the Navy said
its cleanup plan was sufficient for a park and other planned uses.
But the Navy hasn't determined the extent of soil contamination and
Feinstein's letter said it shouldn't sell land at El Toro--designated
in 1990 as one of the country's most contaminated sites--until it
does."I find it disturbing that while the Navy first began its
cleanup efforts at MCAS El Toro in the mid-1980s, it still has not
tested" potentially contaminated sites, she wrote. Feinstein was
referring to a study by Orange County environmental consultants that
identified areas with "high probability for significant
contamination" next to the base's four runways and rail lines.</LD>
<TE>   Although Feinstein has no authority to tell the Navy what to do,
she sits on the Senate Appropriations Committee, where requests for
government funding--including the Navy--are evaluated.</TE>
<TE>   A Navy policy encourages proceeds from the sale of closed military
land be used to bolster the defense budget. Environmental cleanup is
the responsibility of the federal government and comes from money
earmarked for that purpose. Federal law requires the Navy to clean up
contamination but doesn't impose a deadline. The Navy also could
decide that some areas at El Toro cannot be cleaned and restrict
their use.</TE>
<TE>   Navy officials in Washington didn't return calls Tuesday seeking
comment. A Navy spokesman in California referred questions to the
Washington office.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine Mayor Larry Agran said Feinstein's letter confirms the
city's expectations that the land will be cleaned--or that a cleanup
plan will be in place--before it is sold. Last month, Orange County
supervisors voted to allow Irvine to annex the property.</TE>
<TE>   "We expect that the cleanup mandated under federal law will be
undertaken in an expeditious manner," Agran said.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental attorney Greg Hurley, who chaired El Toro's citizen
cleanup panel for seven years, called Feinstein's letter courageous.
There are no other bases in the same situation, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "That's one of the best things I've heard in the 10 years I've
been working on El Toro," said Hurley, who drew the ire of airport
opponents in December when he told county supervisors that developing
a park at the Marine base would be risky because it would expose
people to cancer-causing chemicals in the soil.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy has authorized about $300 million for cleanup. The big
problem could come when redevelopment starts at the base and
unexpected contamination is uncovered, Hurley said.</TE>
<TE>   "The Navy really has no grounds to object to using the money [from
the sale] this way," he said. "What you're going to find is that the
Navy has no confidence that what's being transferred is clean."</TE>
<TE>   In December, Orange County officials asked the Navy to examine 56
areas of potential contamination at the former base, including
testing soil. The spots, added to 929 existing "locations of
concern," included the base's runways, which weren't on the Navy's
list for examination.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy's cleanup plan addresses 880 of the 929 sites; the
remainder were determined to be cleaned. Of the total number of
sites, 643 required no further action, according to the county
report. More analysis is needed for the rest, the report said,
including 115 sites needing "soil management."</TE>
<TE>   El Toro is one of 30 California military bases closed since 1988.
It ended operations in July 1999 with its sister base in Tustin.</TE>
<TE>   The air station was used for aviation for almost 50 years.
According to Navy documents, military activities at El Toro generated
waste oil, paint residue, hydraulic fluid, used batteries and other
wastes. Before the 1970s, environmental rules and regulations were
few and material was simply discarded on the ground or in base
landfills.</TE>
<TE>   Soil and ground-water contamination identified at El Toro centered
around aviation. For example, toxic solvents were used for degreasing
aircraft. From 1943 to 1955, solid waste from several thousand houses
at the base was buried there. Other early disposal activities
included incineration.</TE>
<TE>   Four base landfills received solid waste, paint residues, oily
wastes, industrial solvents and incinerator ash from the burning of
fuel. Two of the landfills were covered with several feet of dirt and
will remain off limits.</TE>
<TE>   Other wastes have been found since the base was closed, including
previously undetected areas of radioactivity.</TE>
<TE>   Board of Supervisors Chairwoman Cynthia P. Coad, who cast the
swing vote last month in favor of allowing Irvine to take over
planning for the base, said the Navy should use its sale money for
military salaries and munitions. She supports cleaning the base
before the land is turned over for other uses.</TE>
<TE>   "My initial feeling is that they should clean up the base through
their [regular] budget," she said.</TE>

does."I find it disturbing that while the Navy first began its
cleanup efforts at MCAS El Toro in the mid-1980s, it still has not
tested" potentially contaminated sites, she wrote. Feinstein was
referring to a study by Orange County environmental consultants that
identified areas with "high probability for significant
contamination" next to the base's four runways and rail lines.</LD>
<TE>   Although Feinstein has no authority to tell the Navy what to do,
she sits on the Senate Appropriations Committee, which evaluates
requests for government funding--including the Navy.</TE>
<TE>   Navy Would Use Sale Proceeds for Defense</TE>
<TE>   A Navy policy encourages proceeds from the sale of closed military
land be used to bolster the defense budget. Environmental cleanup is
the responsibility of the federal government and comes from money
earmarked for that purpose. Federal law requires the Navy to clean up
contamination but doesn't impose a deadline. The Navy also could
decide that some areas at El Toro cannot be cleaned and restrict
their use.</TE>
<TE>   Navy officials in Washington didn't return calls Tuesday seeking
comment. A Navy spokesman in California referred questions to the
Washington office.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine Mayor Larry Agran said Feinstein's letter confirms the
city's expectations that the land will be cleaned--or that a cleanup
plan will be in place--before it is sold. Last month, Orange County
supervisors voted to allow Irvine to annex the property.</TE>
<TE>   "We expect that the cleanup mandated under federal law will be
undertaken in an expeditious manner," Agran said.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental attorney Greg Hurley, who chaired El Toro's citizen
cleanup panel for seven years, called Feinstein's letter courageous.
There are no other bases in the same situation, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "That's one of the best things I've heard in the 10 years I've
been working on El Toro," said Hurley, who angered airport opponents
in December when he told county supervisors that developing a park at
the base would be risky because it would expose people to
cancer-causing chemicals in the soil.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy has authorized about $300 million for cleanup. The big
problem could come when redevelopment starts at the base and
unexpected contamination is uncovered, Hurley said.</TE>
<TE>   "The Navy really has no grounds to object to using the money [from
the sale] this way," he said. "What you're going to find is that the
Navy has no confidence that what's being transferred is clean."</TE>
<TE>   In December, Orange County officials asked the Navy to examine 56
areas of potential contamination at the former base, including
testing soil. The spots, added to 929 existing "locations of
concern," included the base's runways, which weren't on the Navy's
list for examination.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy's cleanup plan addresses 880 of the 929 sites; the
remainder were determined to be cleaned. Of the total number of
sites, 643 required no further action, according to the county
report. More analysis is needed for the rest, the report said,
including 115 sites needing "soil management."</TE>
<TE>   El Toro is one of 30 California military bases closed since 1988.
It ended operations in July 1999 with its sister base in Tustin.</TE>
<TE>   The air station was used for aviation for almost 50 years.
According to Navy documents, military activities at El Toro generated
waste oil, paint residue, hydraulic fluid, used batteries and other
wastes. Before the 1970s, environmental rules and regulations were
few and material was simply discarded on the ground or in base
landfills.</TE>
<TE>   Soil and groundwater contamination identified at El Toro centered
around aviation. For example, toxic solvents were used for degreasing
aircraft. From 1943 to 1955, solid waste from several thousand houses
at the base was buried there. Other early disposal activities
included incineration.</TE>
<TE>   Two Landfills Will Remain Off Limits</TE>
<TE>   Four base landfills received solid waste, paint residues, oily
wastes, industrial solvents and incinerator ash from the burning of
fuel. Two of the landfills were covered with several feet of dirt and
will remain off limits. .</TE>
<TE>   Other wastes have been found since the base was closed, including
previously undetected areas of radioactivity.</TE>
<TE>   Board of Supervisors Chairwoman Cynthia P. Coad, who cast the
swing vote last month in favor of allowing Irvine to take over
planning for the base, said the Navy should use its sale money for
military salaries and munitions. She supports cleaning the base
before the land is turned over for other uses.</TE>
<TE>   "My initial feeling is that they should clean up the base through
their [regular] budget," she said.</TE>

<HD>Conejo Valley Days Carnival Begins Its 5-Day Run</HD>
<DH>Thousand Oaks: The annual fund-raiser for charities will
feature rides, food and return of the Clydesdales.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUZIE ST. JOHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For Jerry Oberle and Scott Wolfe, today's opening of the Conejo
Valley Days carnival in Thousand Oaks means more than just rides,
cotton candy and Clydesdales.</LD>
<LD>   It is the culmination of eight months of careful planning for the
five-day event that is the highlight of the community's 45-year-old
Western-themed celebration.</LD>
<LD>   Oberle is the event's general chairman and Wolfe oversees on-site
activities. Together they are responsible for ensuring that the
event, which is run by volunteers and benefits local charities, goes
off without a hitch.</LD>
<TE>   "It seems to be going a lot smoother than it has in the past and
I'm not going to question it," Oberle said Tuesday afternoon as he
made last-minute preparations for tonight's opening. The Optimist
Club member, in his second year as chairman, has been involved with
the event for 17 years. "Opening night is what we call our 'shakedown
night' when we find out what the problems are and take care of them."</TE>
<TE>   Wolfe, a volunteer since 1996, said his job is to make sure
everything at Conejo Creek Park runs smoothly through Sunday night.
"If there's a conflict I try to make it go away. But most of the
people have been doing this a long time so they know what to do."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the flurry of last-minute activity, Andy Maroti of
Shamrock Shows, which provides the event's rides and carnival games,
said things were under control. He said the last of the nearly two
dozen rides were expected to be erected by late Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Maroti, who calls himself "JJ Gator" after a miniature Gator
roller coaster he operates, said he has traveled the country for 23
years operating carnival rides, the last nine with Shamrock. A crew
of 98 Shamrock workers packed up Sunday night at the close of the
Santa Barbara County Fair and was setting up in Thousand Oak the
following afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   "You couldn't pay me a million dollars to do anything else," said
the Boston native. "This type of job chooses you as much as you
choose it. If you don't enjoy kids you wouldn't last a month."</TE>
<TE>   A perk of working the same fairs each year is that you get to know
some of the regular visitors.</TE>
<TE>   "On Monday night, I was in the grocery store and this little kid
came running up and hugged me because he remembered me from last
year," Maroti said. "The kids is what this is all about. I just try
hard to put a good show on for them."</TE>
<TE>   Along with the carnival rides, food stations and games of chance,
fair-goers can browse through a tent featuring 115 booths of
specialty items for sale, such as arts and crafts, clothing, jewelry
and leather products.</TE>
<TE>   After more than a decade's absence, the Budweiser Clydesdales are
returning to Conejo Valley Days. In addition to being on display in a
tent near the main stage where various musical and dance acts will
perform, the draft horses will participate in the Conejo Valley Days
parade that starts at 9 a.m. Saturday at Thousand Oaks Boulevard and
Hampshire Road.</TE>
<TE>   Lon Parnell, assistant supervisor of the Clydesdale team, said
eight of the 10 horses that travel with the tour will pull the
original wooden Studebaker wagon in the parade with Gus, the
signature Dalmatian, riding on top.</TE>
<TE>   "The horses are very popular, part of Americana really. We just
hope to generate some interest and have an impact on the event," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Attendance at this year's event is expected to top last year's
mark of 50,000. "Characteristically every year has been better than
the last," Oberle said. "I think most people come out because it's a
worthwhile event and it's fun."</TE>
<TE>   The Conejo Valley Days carnival runs tonight and Thursday from 5
to 10 p.m.; Friday 5 p.m. to midnight; Saturday noon to midnight; and
Sunday noon to 8 p.m. General admission is $6 for adults; $5 for
students and seniors; $3 children ages 6 to 12; those 5 and younger
admitted free. For more information, call the Conejo Valley Days

<HD>Suspect in Killing Held in Illinois</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A man wanted in Torrance for allegedly killing his live-in girlfriend
and then dumping her body in the desert has been arrested in
Illinois, authorities said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Richard DeLyle, 56, of Torrance was arrested Sunday in front of a
Ramada hotel in Rosemont, a Chicago suburb, said Rosemont Police
Department spokesman David Bahr.</LD>
<LD>   He said Rosemont police had received a tip from a man identifying
himself as "Mr. Duffy," who said DeLyle was suspected of murder in
California and was a guest at the hotel.</LD>
<TE>   Bahr said the source told police about a 1999 Ford Ranger pickup
truck that DeLyle had been driving and which Torrance police were
trying to locate.</TE>
<TE>   After a brief surveillance, DeLyle was arrested without incident,
Bahr said. An extradition hearing is pending, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Torrance Police Lt. Ed LaLonde said officers will travel to
Illinois this week to get DeLyle. Torrance police believe DeLyle
killed his girlfriend Sarah Hart, 60, then dumped and burned her body
in the desert. Her relatives reported her missing April 2, saying
they had last seen Hart in January, LaLonde said.</TE>
<TE>   San Bernardino County Sheriff's deputies notified Torrance police
of an unidentified burned body found in a remote area north of Big
Bear in February, he said. Dental records revealed April 10 that the
body was Hart's.</TE>
<TE>   LaLonde said money is thought to be DeLyle's motive for killing
Hart, a wealthy former schoolteacher. An investigation indicated that
DeLyle had tried to access Hart's accounts, which had more than $1
million in them.</TE>

<HD>Teachers Protest Dress Code</HD>
<DH>Schools: L.A. Unified urges troubled campuses to follow
guidelines.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIKA HAYASAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly 100 teachers at Mount Vernon Middle School met with Los
Angeles Unified School District officials to protest what they call a
"loyalty oath," a dress code and other changes mandated at certain
troubled campuses.</LD>
<LD>   The measures, which vary by campus, are intended to help reform 10
of the district's lowest-performing schools.</LD>
<LD>   Under a "staff commitment form" created by the district for Mount
Vernon, male teachers will be required to wear ties and slacks; women
who wear dresses must wear pantyhose. No jeans or athletic shoes will
be allowed.</LD>
<TE>   If teachers refuse to abide by these and other requirements on the
form, they must apply for transfer to another campus. They will not
be terminated.</TE>
<TE>   "I like it here, I love the kids. But I am not going to sign that
form," said Doug Brouillard, 34, a teacher who prefers to wear tennis
shoes, jeans and an Oxford shirt to work. "They're going to make me
follow some pre-prescribed form that worked at some other school?
What I do works."</TE>
<TE>   But Supt. Roy Romer said the new rules on attire are meant to
bring a sense of professionalism to the campuses.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are a teacher and you don't want to do it, you are welcome
to go elsewhere," Romer said in an interview at district
headquarters. "We're trying to salvage schools that are failing.
We're trying to do something for the children."</TE>
<TE>   At Mount Vernon, the district is also requiring staff members to
be open to experimenting with or changing teaching methods, to
communicate with students' parents, to maintain high energy and to
attend all mandated staff development sessions.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to stay the course," Theodore Alexander, an associate
superintendent for the district, told teachers Tuesday after the
tense meeting at Mount Vernon. "For those of you who do not wish to
stay, I am sorry."</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, nearly 50 teachers wearing United Teachers-Los Angeles
T-shirts marched around the schoolyard to protest the ultimatum.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers also took issue with reforms that would change Mount
Vernon's schedule. They complained that the school district did not
prepare students and their families for a switch from a year-round
schedule to a more traditional calendar. The teachers said there are
not enough options available for summer school.</TE>
<TE>   Mount Vernon is one of 10 Los Angeles Unified schools that state
auditors found had failed to improve test scores despite four years
of warnings. The audit prompted the district to step in with an
aggressive reform plan.</TE>
<TE>   At some campuses, staff members have been removed or transferred.
Mount Vernon's principal was replaced two months ago.</TE>
<TE>   Other targeted schools include Avalon Gardens Elementary School;
Gompers, Horace Mann and Sun Valley middle schools; and Jefferson,
Locke, Roosevelt and Wilson high schools.</TE>
<TE>   At each school, staff have been required to sign commitment
letters spelling out guidelines they must follow.</TE>
<TE>   John Perez, president-elect of the teachers union, said many
teachers have taken issue with signing such commitment letters. At
Roosevelt High, for example, all 250 teachers have refused to sign,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Why are they hung up on this loyalty oath?" Perez asked. "They're
wasting energy and time doing it."</TE>
<TE>   "Where does it stop?" asked Wil Adams, a teacher at Roosevelt who
attended the Mount Vernon protest.</TE>
<TE>   Lissa Washington, a teacher at Mount Vernon, wore brown open-toe
sandals and a woven silk Egyptian dress Tuesday, with no pantyhose.
She does not think a dress code is fair.</TE>
<TE>   "Wearing pantyhose, or any kind of hose, has nothing to do with
academic achievement," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "How are we supposed to be on our feet all day long, interacting
with children, if we can't wear tennis shoes?" another teacher asked.</TE>
<TE>   Alexander agreed that different attire does not make teachers more
effective, but he emphasized that they are supposed to be role
models. He added that teachers will have until June to make up their
minds about whether they will sign the forms.</TE>

<HD>24% of Schools' English-Learners Test Fluent</HD>
<DH>Education: Advocates credit immersion classes, but
educators say exam's first year means little.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI and JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly a quarter of California public school students who are
learning English scored high enough on a new test to be deemed
fluent.</LD>
<LD>   However, in releasing the test results Tuesday, education
officials cautioned against reclassifying students as fluent too
quickly, lest they struggle academically.</LD>
<LD>   Of about 1.6 million students who took the California English
Language Development Test last year, 24% scored in the advanced or
early advanced categories--high enough to be considered fluent. The
districts, however, make the final determination of whether a student
should be reclassified as English-proficient.</LD>
<TE>   The test was designed to measure whether post-bilingual education
efforts are helping students learn English better. The lack of
English skills is a major factor in low standardized test scores for
many California schoolchildren.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the results show that students who have remained in
bilingual education programs--which require parental
waivers--performed worse than those in English immersion programs.</TE>
<TE>   Students in immersion programs were nearly three times as likely
to score in the advanced or early advanced categories as students in
bilingual programs. But education officials said it is too early to
compare the programs because the scores do not show how long students
had been in each program before taking the test.</TE>
<TE>   Because this was the first year of the test, it provided limited
information about how fast students are acquiring English skills. The
scores will serve as a baseline for future years.</TE>
<TE>   "It will allow us to see if our programs are improving or getting
worse, and it will allow us to learn from each other," said Robert
Fraisse, superintendent of the Hueneme Elementary School District in
Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Unz, author of Proposition 227, which curtailed bilingual
education in the state, said the numbers show that schools are
penalizing students by holding them back in English-learner programs
or bilingual classes when they should be promoted into regular
classes.</TE>
<TE>   Only 9% of English learners graduate to mainstream settings each
year--far lower than the 24% who scored high enough to do so.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a very high margin of error," said Unz, who now heads
English for the Children, a Palo Alto-based group that promotes
English immersion education. "It raises very serious doubts about the
entire methodology of classifying students."</TE>
<TE>   State and local education officials said that the test measures
English proficiency but should not be construed as the sole indicator
of how those learning English will perform in regular classrooms.
Districts also consider grades and scores from other standardized
tests.</TE>
<TE>   "Just getting scores in early advanced or advanced doesn't mean
they are prepared for mainstream education," said Howard Bryan,
director of English language development and bilingual programs at
the Santa Ana Unified School District.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Bryan said, most students learning English already
attend mainstream classes with extra help.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 42,000 Santa Ana students tested last year, 17% scored
advanced or early advanced. About 7% are reclassified every year as
English-fluent, Bryan said.</TE>
<TE>   Most district officials said they expected some discrepancy
between the new test results and the rate they reclassify students,
but some acknowledged that they will reevaluate their programs.</TE>
<TE>   At Simi Valley Unified School District in Ventura County, 38% of
students are eligible to move out of English development programs,
according to the new test results. But the district reclassifies far
fewer students, said Bob Rizzardi, the district's testing
coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we're holding kids back unnecessarily," he said.
"But that's an awfully high number."</TE>
<TE>   The exam tests abilities in listening, speaking, reading and
writing English. Districts administered the test last year for the
first time amid complaints that the test was too time-consuming and
cumbersome.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, the state Board of Education eased some of the
burden by not requiring the listening and speaking portions of the
test every year from students who pass them the first time.</TE>
<TE>   The test eventually will count as an accountability measure for
the districts, said state Supt. of Education Delaine Eastin, but
because many students move from district to district, the state must
first create a student tracking system. Otherwise, districts with a
high influx of students who are not fluent in English might be
unfairly penalized because most of their students would perennially
score lower in the test.</TE>

<HD>Garden Grove Gives Theater Center 3 Months to Improve</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: Council members are unhappy with
management's ignoring community groups.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BOEHM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Garden Grove City Council voted Tuesday night to give the Grove
Theater Center three months to change some of its policies or risk
losing control of the two city-owned venues it operates.</LD>
<LD>   Voting 4 to 1, council members said they want the Grove to be more
receptive to renting to community groups. The theaters have been used
mainly for the company's own professional productions.</LD>
<LD>   The council also expects the Grove to move quickly toward full
nonprofit status so it can raise money on its own to offset costs.</LD>
<TE>   Kevin Cochran, the Grove's artistic director, said, "We agree that
we have been remiss" in not fully embracing community groups. He said
the center will work to meet the council's demand. After the
three-month period, the council could vote to give the Grove eight
months' notice that the city is terminating its contract.</TE>
<TE>   Some speakers at Tuesday's meeting said it would be difficult for
the Grove to serve two masters--professional theater and community
events. Councilman Mark Leyes, who cast the dissenting vote, warned
that the city risks losing professional theater entirely if it
presses the Grove too hard. But the council majority, while praising
the quality of productions, stressed that more community events are
needed.</TE>
<TE>   The center's management of the 172-seat, indoor Gem Theater and
the Festival Amphitheater, an outdoor facility that seats as many as
550, became an issue last summer when Garden Grove officials sensed
they weren't attracting people to downtown.</TE>
<TE>   In September, city officials put the center on notice that it was
not meeting its contractual obligation to generate a busy and varied
schedule of downtown events by producing its own plays and hiring out
the two theaters to community groups.</TE>
<TE>   A 'Gut Feeling' Called for More Results</TE>
<TE>   "There was a gut feeling that there wasn't a lot going on there,
and we expected more," City Manager George Tindall said.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Johanson, the Grove's executive director, concedes there
may have been flaws in the strategy that he and Cochran have followed
the last seven years. When they began in 1994, Johanson said, they
had to dig out from under a cloud of public skepticism about the
theater because previous operators had struggled for years on the
edge of financial collapse. They took over after one of their
predecessors had fallen into bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   "We made a conscious choice to focus solely on the artistic
product" and earn back the theater-going public's goodwill with
quality productions, Johanson said in an interview. They decided they
would focus on marketing, fund-raising and building a bigger audience
after they had built a reputation for putting on good shows.</TE>
<TE>   "In hindsight, that may have not been the best decision," Johanson
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Grove Center has struggled along as the smallest kid on the
block in Orange County professional theater circles. Its budget for
2002 is $225,000, of which the city contributes $40,000 a year,
compared to more than $8 million and $4.6 million, respectively, at
the much older and better-established South Coast Repertory in Costa
Mesa and the Laguna Playhouse in Laguna Beach.</TE>
<TE>   To jump-start growth, the Grove in April proposed a marketing
campaign to be funded by a city contribution of $113,600; the council
Tuesday night denied that request. While building its audience base,
the theater company would, for the first time, concentrate on
attracting large private grants and donations--a crucial step for any
nonprofit arts organization.</TE>
<TE>   The Grove Center's last play of 2001, Neil Simon's "The Last of
the Red Hot Lovers," ran for 10 performances in October and November
and drew only 501 attendees--132 of them paid. Johanson attributed
the dismal returns to post-Sept. 11 shock. This season's first play,
"Sylvia," by A.R. Gurney, has drawn 749 theater-goers, half of them
paid, to eight performances; the show has been extended an additional
six performances because of solid demand.</TE>

<HD>Gun Found at School; 2 Arrested</HD>

<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two teenage boys were arrested Tuesday after police said one of them
took a handgun and about 14 rounds of ammunition to the Rancho Santa
Margarita high school they attend.</LD>
<LD>   One of the boys, 15, said he concealed the pistol in his backpack
and brought it to Tesoro High School because he feared that other
students meant to harm him, authorities said. "He brought it for
self-protection," said Lt. John Brimmage, a spokesman for the Orange
County Sheriff's Department.</LD>
<LD>   When word of the concealed weapon--a .380 semiautomatic--spread on
campus and other students notified the principal, the boy passed the
weapon to a friend, 16, who hid it in his own backpack, Brimmage
said. Eventually, school authorities conducted a search, discovered
the gun and called police.</LD>
<TE>   The boys, whose names were not released because of their ages,
were taken to Juvenile Hall in Orange and booked on suspicion of
possessing a firearm on campus, a felony. "I would think there's a
strong likelihood that they'll also be expelled," Brimmage said.</TE>
<TE>   School officials could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The 15-year-old's fear apparently stemmed from a conversation he'd
had with other teenagers several days earlier in which he'd made
disparaging remarks about a popular student who had been injured in a
car crash. "He made a derisive comment about the student ... and some
of the kids took exception to it," Brimmage said. "Apparently he'd
been hassled."</TE>

<HD>Holden to Pay $6,500 for Ethics Violations</HD>
<DH>Ethics: The councilman and an aide are found guilty by city
panel of 31 campaign infractions. Two of five panelists favored a
stiffer fine.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>City Councilman Nate Holden was found guilty by the Los Angeles
Ethics Commission Tuesday of 31 campaign violations involving his
1999 reelection drive, but escaped a heavy fine.</LD>
<LD>   On a vote of 3 to 2, with Chairwoman Miriam Krinsky holding out
for a $30,000 fine, the commission voted to fine Holden and his
campaign treasurer, Anne Froelich, $6,500.</LD>
<LD>   Commissioners Dale Bonner, David W. Fleming and Pam Emerson said
they believed that despite past violations by Holden, the latest
infractions were technical and unintentional.</LD>
<TE>   Holden, who had complained during months of contentious
proceedings and the more than 20-hour hearing that he had been
targeted for discriminatory action, called the outcome a victory and
said the Ethics Commission should change its policies and not so
aggressively pursue "bookkeeping errors."</TE>
<TE>   But commission Executive Director Lee Ann Pelham expressed deep
disappointment.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, the low fine the majority chose to impose in this
case suggests that violating the law comes with little real
consequence for those found guilty," Pelham said in a written
statement handed out after the hearing.</TE>
<TE>   The other commissioner who favored heavier fines was Richard
Walsh, head of the Los Angeles County Bar Assn.</TE>
<TE>   He and Krinsky were outspoken in their belief that the commission
was doing a disservice.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a sad message we are sending tonight," Krinsky said just
before the vote. "Candidates will have no incentive to observe the
law. It's a bad message for the citizens as well.... It may well
undermine our laws."</TE>
<TE>   Walsh, who said he wanted a fine of $25,000 to $30,000, said he
"vigorously" dissented from the $6,500 fine, because he thought
Holden's light punishment would create a bad precedent.</TE>
<TE>   The staff member who prosecuted the case, Deena Ghaly, repeatedly
told the panel that Holden has a record of campaign violations
stretching over four elections. She said he was fined $27,000 for 41
violations in his 1995 reelection campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout his career, she said, Holden has compiled a record of
taking money beyond permissible campaign limits 334 times, a total of
$164,789.</TE>
<TE>   The commission majority, while joining in the unanimous verdict
that Holden was guilty of 31 violations this time, including 11
excessive donations and 20 duplications of applications for city
matching funds, maintained that the violations were unintentional.</TE>
<TE>   "If there had been proof of bad intent, I would have joined in
wanting higher fines," Fleming said. "But this was mistakes, not
intent."</TE>
<TE>   Bonner said, "We have an obligation to look at specific facts of
the case. This is not a case to send a message."</TE>
<TE>   Emerson said she agreed that "a very large fine is not
appropriate."</TE>
<TE>   She proposed the successful motion that Holden reimburse the city
$4,500 and pay a $2,000 fine.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's hearing began at 8:45 a.m. and continued until 8:15 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Holden was there throughout the proceedings, along with Froelich.</TE>
<TE>   Holden did most of the talking for the defense, spiritedly
contending that as soon as he learned there may have been violations
of campaign laws, after his reelection campaign was over, he had
ordered a "re-audit" and had returned most of the money he was not
entitled to.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, he said, "I was not the captain of the ship," because he
was campaigning and didn't know what his staff was doing.</TE>
<TE>   Ghaly scoffed at that. Holden, she said, "is a tough, charismatic
figure" who runs everything in his office and must take
responsibility for any violations.</TE>

<HD>Grand Jury Indicts 2 in Scam</HD>
<DH>Court: Inland Empire businessmen are accused of paying
kickbacks to a defense contractor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A growing probe of kickbacks involving an Inland Empire defense
contractor now reaches from a construction project at March Air Force
Base to a paint job at Pearl Harbor and could send two San Bernardino
County men to prison for more than 30 years, officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Jeffrey Bygum, 38, and Marion Francis "Skip" Ely III, 42, have
surrendered on a federal indictment that accuses them of paying
kickbacks to a former Defense Department contractor.</LD>
<LD>   In connection with the payments, the two owners of Federal
Contract Services of San Bernardino received two defense contracts in
August 1997--one to revitalize an aircraft hangar at March Air Force
Base in Riverside County and the second to paint a fuel tank at Pearl
Harbor Naval Air Base in Hawaii, federal authorities said.</LD>
<TE>   The indictment, returned by a federal grand jury in Los Angeles
last week, charges Bygum and Ely with conspiracy to pay kickbacks,
payment of kickbacks, conspiracy to tamper with a witness and witness
tampering. Ely is also charged with filing a false income tax return
for Federal Contract Services.</TE>
<TE>   The men allegedly routed construction services to a former Defense
Department contractor, Carl Douglas Fenstermacher of Dames &amp; Moore
Inc.</TE>
<TE>   The men in late 1998 and early 1999 paid for $26,000 worth of
construction work on Fenstermacher's home in Fallbrook, said
Assistant U.S. Atty. Monica Bachner. The indictment says that Bygum
and Ely, both of Apple Valley, were trying to secure "favorable
treatment" for their company.</TE>
<TE>   Subsequently, Fenstermacher hired Federal Contract Services as a
subcontractor to Dames &amp; Moore on the two defense contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Fenstermacher, 54, pleaded guilty in February to mail fraud and
money laundering for allowing another subcontractor to submit
$420,000 in fraudulent invoices to Dames &amp; Moore. Fenstermacher is
scheduled to be sentenced in late August.</TE>
<TE>   Ely's attorney, Kevin McDermott of Tustin, said the transaction
involving Bygum, Ely and Fenstermacher may have been convoluted but
was perfectly legal. He said Fenstermacher merely gave pieces of
construction equipment to the men in exchange for work done on his
home.</TE>
<TE>   McDermott said that, even if the allegations are proved, the
government's "loss" would barely top $30,000. "This is an incredible
amount of time and effort placed on 30 grand," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys representing Fenstermacher and Bygum did not return
phone calls seeking comment.</TE>

<LD>A 9-year-old boy died after he was shot in the head by another child
as they and a third boy played with a handgun Tuesday near Inglewood,
police said.</LD>
<LD>   There were no adults in the house in the 9800 block of South
Hobart Boulevard in Los Angeles when the accidental shooting occurred
at about 6:30 p.m., Sgt. Mike Flanagan said.</LD>
<LD>   The handgun was owned by the man who lived in the house, whose son
was not injured. Two other guns also were in the house, Det. Rudy
Lemos said.</LD>
<TE>   The children, all 9, were playing in the bedroom and were supposed
to be doing their homework, Lemos said.</TE>
<TE>   The victim, Levante Evans, was shot in the eye and taken to
King-Drew Medical Center, Flanagan said.</TE>
<TE>   It was the same hospital, Levante's grandmother said, where her
daughter--the boy's mother--had been taken when she was fatally shot
in a drive-by attack in November 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Flora Burns, 52, said that her grandson had even been taken to the
same hospital room Tuesday night where his mother had died, and that
the same police officer had been present both times.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the same as his mother," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Burns said the child who shot her grandson had run home and told
his mother what had happened. His mother called police and then went
to Burns' home.</TE>
<TE>   Levante was a fourth-grader at Manhattan Elementary School, his
grandmother said, and loved computers and basketball. He played on a
community team at Jessie Owens Park.</TE>
<TE>   The child who lives at the home "was in shock," neighbor Juanita
McKnight said.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives had not yet determined whether to press charges against
the adults.</TE>

<DH>San Diego: Outdoor murals depicting the history of Chicanos
are defaced in a city park.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Police are investigating as a possible hate crime the defacing of
five outdoor murals painted on steel and concrete pillars at Chicano
Park in the Barrio Logan neighborhood here, officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The brightly colored murals of heroic, larger-than-life figures
depict the history of Chicanos in the southwestern United States, as
well as important people in Mexican, Chicano and Latin American
history.</LD>
<LD>   Although vandalism and graffiti are common in public places here,
the spray-paint attack on the five murals, which was discovered
Monday, marks the first time that the artwork of Chicano Park has
been marred in its 30-year history.</LD>
<TE>   "Chicano Park has always been a kind of sacred ground: no gang
graffiti, no tagging graffiti," said police Sgt. Joe Woods, who is
leading the investigation. "This is definitely a first."</TE>
<TE>   One mural was spray-painted with the words "Down With Mexico" in
Spanish. On the others the phrase "Viva la Miga" was painted,
probably a misspelling of the word "migra," a slang term for the
Border Patrol. One mural had a four-letter expletive in English.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an outrageous act and has offended my community greatly,"
said artist Salvador Torres, who painted some of the murals and is
known as the "grandfather of Chicano Park."</TE>
<TE>   The park--beneath an elevated portion of Interstate 5 leading to
the Coronado Bay Bridge--was born of the Chicano political activism
that arose in the late 1960s and early '70s.</TE>
<TE>   The site had been scheduled to be a California Highway Patrol
facility but protesters, angry at the prospect of losing control of
the land, blocked bulldozers in April 1970. That protest is often
celebrated in Chicano history as a landmark event in a movement that
emphasized radical politics and cultural pride.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with the protest, the CHP and San Diego City Council backed
down and allowed the area--wedged between homes and an industrial
zone--to become an urban park, with murals and a lawn.</TE>
<TE>   There are now more than 55 murals on the concrete and steel
pillars of the overhead freeway done by more than two dozen artists,
including several schoolchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, thousands of people flocked to the park for an
all-day party to commemorate the 32nd anniversary of the 1970 protest
and its slogan "Reclaiming What's Ours."</TE>
<TE>   Richard Griswold del Castillo, chairman of the Department of
Chicana and Chicano Studies at San Diego State, said that Chicano
Park has the largest outdoor collection of Latino/Chicano murals in
the United States and that the murals are central to the park's
historic and cultural significance.</TE>
<TE>   "Chicano Park is a place of celebration, of cultural renewal,
spiritual rededication and political protest," he said. "I am in
shock and disbelief that someone would do this. I'm ashamed for San
Diego."</TE>
<TE>   Students in literature, anthropology and Chicano studies classes
regularly visit Chicano Park to study the murals and ponder their
importance.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, for example, a literature class from San Diego City
College was at the park studying the murals. "This is ruthless,
absolutely terrible," said English professor Elva Salinas. "It's the
kind of hurtful thing that white supremacists might do."</TE>
<TE>   Salinas' students shared her outrage. "Everybody should be able to
show their culture without other people messing it up," said Jeanna
Balestrieri, 20, a sophomore. "This is just wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Ruben Moreno, the city Park and Recreation Department supervisor
for Chicano Park, said he was surprised that anyone would dare deface
the murals, given the protective feeling in the surrounding
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   "If anyone had seen them do it, you can bet they would have
stopped them," he said. "It's not a smart idea to hurt the murals
when anybody is around."</TE>
<TE>   Raymond Uzeta, president of the Chicano Federation of San Diego
County, said he is pleased the Police Department is treating the
vandalism as a possible hate crime, which could lead to tougher
penalties for the culprits.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope they're caught and prosecuted," he said. "We cannot
tolerate people coming into a neighborhood and destroying public art
that has brought so much pride."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Balboa Bay Club has been fined $60,000 by state water regulators
for 20 violations of discharging sulfide into bay waters from
February 2001 to January 2002. Sulfide--a naturally occurring,
odiferous ground water compound--was released during construction
work for a new resort at the club.</LD>
<LD>   "It isn't unsafe to humans, [but] it's smelly and it's an
aesthetic concern," said Jerry Thibeault, executive officer of the
Santa Ana Regional Water Quality Control Board, who said there are
safe methods for eliminating it.</LD>
<LD>   He said the fines were mandatory under a relatively new state law.</LD>
<TE>   Club president Henry Schielein said he had noticed the smell but
had no idea that it meant something was wrong.</TE>
<TE>   He said if any laws were violated, it was the responsibility of
the general contractor overseeing construction, Snyder Langston.</TE>
<TE>   The contractor did not return a call for comment.</TE>
<TE>   If an appeal is filed, a hearing will be held May 31.</TE>

<BD>From Times Staff reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A lawsuit challenging the legality of the March 5 vote to replace
airport zoning at the former El Toro Marine base has been assigned to
a judge in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The case was assigned Tuesday to Judge Dzintra Janavs, who ruled
two years ago that an earlier anti-airport initiative--Measure
F--which at that point was headed for the March 2000 ballot, appeared
to be unconstitutional. She nonetheless allowed the measure to go
forward and it was passed by voters. Another judge and ultimately an
appellate court tossed out the initiative as unconstitutional.</LD>
<LD>   Attorneys for airport supporters, who filed the challenge, argue
that local voters cannot interfere with the authority of the Board of
Supervisors to determine the fate of the former Marine base.</LD>

<LD>Traffic reporters may have to start dividing their broadcasts into
vehicle and duck advisories. A mom and her little quackers held up
travelers on the San Diego Freeway recently, and another family of
jay-waddlers did the same thing on Pacific Coast Highway in Laguna
Beach.</LD>
<LD>   Now the Dana Point News tells the story of still another duck (at
least I'm assuming it's a different female in each case) whose
squawking and jumping about was a distraction to commuters.</LD>
<LD>   A passerby stopped and discovered that the creature's 10 young
'uns had fallen into a storm drain. Authorities armed with a bucket

<DL></DL>
<LD>Del Sharbutt, 90, one of the most familiar announcers on the air
during the heyday of radio and the early years of television, died
Friday in New York of unspecified causes. He retired in 1976 and had
lived for many years in Palm Desert, Calif.</LD>
<LD>   Educated at Texas Christian University, he began his broadcasting
career at WBAP radio in Fort Worth, Texas, worked briefly in Chicago,
and then joined CBS radio network in New York. He later worked for
NBC and freelanced, announcing such hit radio serials as "The Amos
and Andy Show," "Meet Corliss Archer," "The Robert Benchley Show" and
"Your Hit Parade," which featured singers such as Frank Sinatra,
Doris Day and Dinah Shore.</LD>
<LD>   Sharbutt also worked for the Mutual Radio network and became
universally known as a spokesman for Campbell's soups. He voiced the
commercials, touting the soups as "Mmm-mm-good."</LD>
<TE>   A musician as well, Sharbutt played sax, clarinet, piano and
organ, and was a songwriter. Among his credits are the theme for the
Bob Cummings television show and the early 1950s ditty "A Romantic
Guy, I."</TE>

<HD>John Morris, 76; Led Philadelphia Teamsters for 44 Years
Till Ouster</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John P. Morris, 76, the feisty former Pennsylvania Teamsters leader
who was ousted in 1999 for purportedly assaulting members, misusing
funds and stockpiling weapons for "war," died Sunday in Philadelphia
of heart disease.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Mahanoy City, Pa., in the anthracite coal region, Morris
grew up one of 12 children in an Irish Catholic household that
stressed hard work and just compensation for that work.</LD>
<LD>   At 19, Morris moved to Philadelphia and became a shipping clerk
and union member, and began organizing his co-workers.</LD>
<TE>   In 1955, he founded Teamsters Local 115 with seven members. By the
time he was forced out 44 years later, his organization had 2,700
members, ranging from store clerks to truck drivers.</TE>
<TE>   Adept at leading strikes, he wrote a strike manual for the local
that remains the top reference of its kind of the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually elected president of the statewide Teamsters and a vice
president of the national union, Morris was removed as
secretary-treasurer of Local 115 in 1999. National Teamsters leaders
accused him of creating a climate of fear and intimidation among
members, including assaults, and of using union dues to pay premiums
on his $1-million insurance policy and to buy uniforms and weapons
for what he described as "war." His suit to overturn the ouster was
pending at his death.</TE>

<LD>Ten years is an arbitrary yardstick, a biological happenstance. If we
had 12 fingers instead of 10, we wouldn't be soul-searching for the
Meaning of the Riots until the year 2004.</LD>
<LD>   But here we are, one neat, round decade beyond the riots of 1992,
trying to be suitably reflective. I say "riots" and not the tippy-toe
euphemism "civil unrest" because riots they were, in the country's
muscular tradition of Shays' Rebellion, draft riots and bread riots.</LD>
<LD>   Recalling this riot is like recalling a death in the
family--fragmented, vivid and smoke-smudged, all contradictions and
tragicomedies:</LD>
<TE>   The stupefying mayhem, then the horrifying sight of National
Guardsmen ... black strangers saving white strangers' lives, and the
recorded rants of the "hate hotline," referring callers to a
Fullerton post office box for a $3 copy of "Racial Loyalties" ...
watching Goldilocks looters, Papa Bear with the big screen, Mama Bear
with the 17-inch, Baby Bear with the CD player ... driving on
deserted Sunset Boulevard after curfew alongside policemen who hadn't
seen the inside of a patrol car in years, drafted for the duration
and squeezed like sullen clowns into a black and white Crown
Victoria.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first riot I ever heard of that inspired ordinary
people to write poetry.</TE>
<TE>   How do I frame that now, especially for you who watched from Idaho
or Missouri or Vermont like our misery was a National Geographic
special--distant, exotic, horrible.</TE>
<TE>   I chose the liquor store, the market whose profit margin is in
drink--not Merlot or single-malt scotch but the drunkard's booze,
strong and quick and cheap. The corner crime-wave, where the sofa out
front invites the loungers and scroungers, the crackheads and
troublemakers.</TE>
<TE>   The liquor store, where a black teenager named Latasha Harlins was
shot by a Korean shop-owner she had slugged in a tug-of-war over
orange juice, lighting a fuse to racial tensions more than a year
before the riots.</TE>
<TE>   The liquor store, where hilarity and misery come in a 40-ounce
bottle--the first target of looters who danced and drank for the
cameras, the blight and the livelihood of a lifetime, gone in an
hour.</TE>
<TE>   Other parts of town were torched and looted, but South-Central was
the epicenter of the man-made earthquake, so there is where I spent
anniversary day, April 29.</TE>
<TE>   About 220 liquor stores were destroyed in the riots, leaving maybe
500; the people of South-Central still have twice as many liquor
stores as all of Rhode Island.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors fought their return after the Watts riots and failed.
They fought again in 1992, and kept 150 from rebuilding, which is why
I call the ride that Karen Bass and Solomon Rivera took me on "the
South-Central Victory Tour."</TE>
<TE>   Bass and Rivera are director and associate director of the
Community Coalition, which has spent the years since 1992 in a
paperwork battle of hearings and protests and code complaints, to
break up the ghastly zoning trinity of church/liquor store/hot-sheet
motel on South-Central's main streets. Stores and services taken for
granted in thriving ZIP Codes are a marvel here: Wow, a Home Depot.
Look, a Starbucks.</TE>
<TE>   Bass began this liquor store battle hoping for a thousand
signatures on her petitions. She got 35,000. People were sick of it.
You could buy a drink at every corner but coin laundries seemed as
distant as Disneyland.</TE>
<TE>   That many were run by Korean Americans made it vital that Bass say
over and over that the problem was the business practices, not the
business people, and "we just don't think you should rebuild a
problem."</TE>
<TE>   In the car, she consults her list: 38 liquor stores turned to shoe
stores or coin laundries or hardware places. At Van Ness and Slauson,
Alamo's Liquor is now Alamo's Market, with a soul-food restaurant
next door. At Century and Western, the Arco AM/PM is now the Puente
Learning Center, on ground donated by Arco after it gave up the fight
to rebuild. At Manchester and Van Ness, the El Nido Family Center
stands on the site of Mr. Woodley's Liquors.</TE>
<TE>   It is South-Central's civic version of the medieval philosopher's
stone, the miraculous something that turns lead into gold.</TE>
<TE>   As we roamed in Rivera's VW, we kept encountering barricades and
people in orange mesh vests telling us, "You can't go there,
President Bush is coming."</TE>
<TE>   Decade deja vu: 10 years ago, I trailed the first President Bush
on a press bus from church to gutted shopping center. The East Coast
reporters struggled for an image, and settled on the jacaranda trees,
blooming Easter-purple against the veils of smoke, a metaphor for
ruin and renewal, maybe. It's the same image I would have used had I
been writing about some city other than my own, but its glibness
hurt.</TE>
<TE>   Now it's May. The jacarandas again blossom. And block by sad,
screwed-up block, perhaps the city will one day too.</TE>

<LD>Two boys were arrested Tuesday after police said one of them took a
pistol and about 15 cartridges to their Rancho Santa Margarita high
school.</LD>
<LD>   One boy, 15, said he hid the pistol in his backpack and brought it
to Tesoro High because he feared that other students meant to harm
him, authorities said. When word of the gun spread and other students
told the principal, the boy passed the weapon to a friend, 16, who
hid it in his own backpack, authorities said. School officials found
the gun and called police.</LD>
<LD>   The boys were taken to Juvenile Hall in Orange.</LD>

<LD>Before a crowd that included police dog handlers from as far as Las
Vegas, Oxnard officers on Tuesday said farewell to Rudy, the
department's first dog to die in the line of duty.</LD>
<LD>   Rudy died of stab wounds April 19 after bringing down a suspect
who allegedly had brandished a knife at officers.</LD>
<LD>   Tuesday's memorial observance at the Oxnard Performing Arts Center
drew several hundred uniformed officers, city officials and residents
who were touched by accounts of the dog's death.</LD>
<TE>   Dressed in black, Susan Komar of Oxnard kept her daughter Faith
home from first-grade classes in order to attend.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to show her how much a dog can give to the community,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the hall, at least a dozen police dogs from far-flung
departments sat in patrol cars, waiting for their handlers.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, a table was stacked with tributes from children to Rudy
and his handler, Officer J.R. Perez. On the auditorium's stage, a
local artist's painting of Rudy stared down at the somber crowd. On
either side stood two officers in full-dress regalia.</TE>
<TE>   One by one, officers associated with Oxnard's K-9 unit reminisced
about Rudy, offering reflections on the 4-year-old dog's willingness
to put himself in harm's way to track down suspects and protect his
partner.</TE>
<TE>   They told of Rudy and Perez dashing across busy Oxnard Boulevard
and scaling fences to corner a fleeing robber. Rudy made it through
training in record time, and, in his two years with the department,
backed up Perez in more than 3,000 incidents, participated in 91
building searches, and on 32 occasions helped out SWAT teams,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "He loved to search," said Rodney Spicer, the department's dog
trainer, as he stifled his sobs. "He loved to send people to jail."</TE>
<TE>   Chief Art Lopez lauded Rudy as one of our "guardian angels of the
night."</TE>
<TE>   "I can stand here and tell you of loss and pain, but I won't," he
said. "Rudy wouldn't be thinking like that."</TE>
<TE>   When Perez made his way to the podium, the audience gave him a
resounding ovation. He said he plans to continue his duties with a
dog yet to be chosen, despite mourning for Rudy. Like other K-9 unit
members, he kept his dog at home; Rudy became a favorite of
neighborhood kids, who would yell their greetings whenever they saw
him cruise by with Perez.</TE>
<TE>   "I lost my friend, my partner, a member of my family," Perez said.
"He was a big, happy, 80-pound bundle of energy who loved to work,
play, and, above all, get scratched behind the ear."</TE>
<TE>   The gathering was not just a remembrance of Rudy but a tribute to
the city's 22-year-old canine program. Funded largely by citizen
contributions, it makes use of a breed called the Belgian Malinois.
The department's dogs are trained initially in Europe and respond to
commands given in Dutch and Flemish.</TE>
<TE>   After Rudy's death, suspect Timothy Paul Knight, 20, of Oxnard,
was charged with exhibiting a weapon while resisting arrest, battery
on a police animal with an enhancement for killing the dog, and
violating probation on a conviction for receiving stolen property. He
remains in jail on $510,000 bail.</TE>

<HD>Salgado's Words Placed Him at Zara's Slaying, Jurors Told</HD>
<DH>Court: Prosecutor argues the defendant told police he was
part of the group that beat a man to death. Defense attorney says his
client wasn't present and was tricked by officers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KELLY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The case against Ramiro Salgado, the fifth and final defendant in the
1999 bludgeoning death of a Ventura teen, went to the jury Tuesday
after the prosecution made a final plea for his conviction of
second-degree murder.</LD>
<LD>   Salgado, 22, is accused of punching, kicking and, according to one
witness, beating 18-year-old William Zara with a shovel after hearing
that Zara had called police about a noisy party.</LD>
<LD>   In her rebuttal arguments, Deputy Dist. Atty. Maeve Fox denied
assertions by Salgado's attorney that a witness who put Salgado at
the scene was lying and that the suspect's confession was improper.</LD>
<TE>   Fox called Salgado's statement to police a "beautiful thing."
While talking to police, Salgado said he had dreamed about Zara, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Why is he talking about Zara?" Fox asked.</TE>
<TE>   Then, pointing to her heart, she said, "Because it's in here; he's
thinking about it."</TE>
<TE>   In the interview, Salgado told police that he, with 10 other gang
members, stomped and kicked Zara the night of Sept. 25, 1999. The
group had been attending a party at a home on East Warner Avenue in
Ventura when someone called police to complain about the noise.</TE>
<TE>   The party-goers began attacking neighbors they believed made the
complaint before confronting Zara, who swung a baseball bat at them
as they converged on him. One man hit Zara in the head with a shovel,
knocking him off the porch. Another grabbed Zara's bat and beat him.
Someone else stabbed him repeatedly. Zara suffered massive skull
fractures and died the next day.</TE>
<TE>   Four other defendants have been sentenced to lengthy prison terms.
Benny Lopez Jr., 18, was sentenced to 32 years to life last year.
Frank Olvera, 34; his wife, Rosana Olvera, 37; and Terry Schell, 23,
were each sentenced to 15 years to life on charges of second-degree
murder.</TE>
<TE>   Fox said Salgado's membership in a gang and his own words
convicted him as a participant in the slaying. Defense attorney
Richard Loftus had argued that Salgado's confession was obtained
after officers led him to believe he would go free if he admitted
hitting Zara. But Fox said the confession was excellent police work
and urged the jury to listen to it again during deliberations.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very low-key," she said. "They didn't try to break the guy
down. He felt safe, he felt he was going home. It's so revealing
about what the defendant is feeling and thinking, it's incredible."</TE>
<TE>   Fox also dismissed defense arguments that accused gang member
Chris Gonzales, granted immunity for his testimony in the case, had
fingered Salgado because Salgado wasn't a key player in the gang and
therefore couldn't retaliate.</TE>
<TE>   "He fingered the Olveras, Benny Lopez and Salgado," she said. "If
he has no fear, why is he running around in the witness protection
program? Because if they find him, he's dead."</TE>
<TE>   She scoffed at defense statements that Ventura police gang Officer
Rick Payne, who testified during the trial, lacked the advanced
education needed to truly grasp the sociology of gang life.</TE>
<TE>   "Rick Payne is a street cop who has more experience talking to
gang members than the defense's [expert witnesses]," Fox said.</TE>

<LD>Residents concerned about aboveground storage of used radioactive
fuel rods asked county officials to analyze all options before
approving Pacific Gas &amp; Electric's plan.</LD>
<LD>   More than 75 people attended Monday's county meeting on the
utility's storage plans at the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant.
They want a full analysis by the county before consideration of a
license to build an aboveground dry-cask storage facility.</LD>
<LD>   PG&amp;E wants to build a series of concrete pads behind the power
plant that will house as many as 138 casks containing spent nuclear
rods from Diablo's two reactors.</LD>

<LD>Oroville High School officials have agreed to pay a former
valedictorian and his attorney $59,000 to settle the student's
allegation that the Butte County school refused to let him speak at
his graduation for religious reasons.</LD>
<LD>   In paying $29,000 to Jason Niemeyer and $30,000 to attorney Steven
Burlingham, school officials did not admit fault or wrongdoing,
according to documents filed in Sacramento federal court.</LD>
<LD>   In early 1999, Niemeyer, now 20, proposed two speeches to school
officials. One extolled the benefits of a relationship with Jesus
Christ. The other was religious but nonsectarian, said U.S. District
Judge Lawrence Karlton.</LD>

<LD>Attorneys for landlord Genshiro Kawamoto have signed a settlement
ending a lawsuit filed after he evicted dozens of people from homes
he owns in Sonoma County.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement ends a 2-month-old suit that accuses Kawamoto of
keeping 149 rental homes in Santa Rosa in disrepair. It calls for him
to pay the county $80,000 in legal fees, make thousands of dollars in
repairs, and offer current and some former tenants up to two months'
free rent.</LD>
<LD>   Kawamoto drew statewide attention in February when he suddenly
announced plans to sell the Santa Rosa homes and another 420 homes in
Sacramento. He gave most tenants 30 days to get out.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>California's "spite fence" ordinance bars residents from building
fences taller than 10 feet specifically to annoy their neighbors.
Now, a state appellate court has ruled that tall trees planted for
that purpose can be banned.</LD>
<LD>   Tuesday's ruling arose when a Yreka couple planted evergreens
along their property line when a neighbor began building a two-story
log home. Afraid the trees would block her view of Mt. Shasta, the
neighbor took the couple to court.</LD>
<LD>   A three-judge panel ruled that trees planted "along or near the
property line between adjoining parcels to separate or mark the
boundary between the parcels" may indeed be a spite fence, and
returned the case to a lower court to determine whether the trees
should come down.</LD>

<LD>   Secession proponents, whose numbers include some Valley and
Hollywood business leaders, say they will depend heavily on
precinct-level volunteers, but will also try to raise up to $4
million for the campaign.</LD>
<LD>   "We will appeal to people on two levels," said Richard Katz, a
former assemblyman who is co-chairman of the Valley secession
campaign. "One will be a grass-roots level of people who really want
to see change. And the other will be people who have businesses in
the Valley [and elsewhere] who feel this is an issue worth
supporting."</LD>
<TE>   Katz said fund-raising has been difficult for secessionists so
far, and opponents have access to more deep-pocket donors. He
declined to say how much the secession effort has raised.</TE>
<TE>   The state Local Agency Formation Commission is expected to decide
late this month whether to place the secession proposals on the
November ballot. For a secession measure to win, it must gain a
majority of voters both within the breakaway region and the city as a
whole. Ben Goddard, a political consultant who has been retained by
the Valley and Hollywood secession movements to run the campaign
citywide, said grass-roots organizing would be augmented with
television commercials and other mass media efforts aimed at voters
throughout the city.</TE>
<TE>   "The overarching message is that this is going to be good for
everyone," Goddard said. "A smaller city of L.A. is going to be much
closer to the local residents. It's going to be more responsive.
Council districts are going to be smaller."</TE>
<TE>   Goddard said the campaign will enlist volunteers to walk door to
door in the Westside and South-Central Los Angeles. It will try to
change the language of the debate, encouraging people to use the
terms "independence" and "cityhood" instead of secession, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor James K. Hahn, who is leading the opposition, dismissed the
idea that secession could have citywide benefits.</TE>
<TE>   "Breaking up the city would be bad for everyone," Hahn said. "I'm
going to be talking about the fact that the economy is beginning to
rebound, our real estate market is strong, and city government is
working to develop relationships with neighborhoods. It would slow
all that momentum down and throw the city into chaos if people are
persuaded to vote to break up Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   The secession group Valley VOTE held an organizing meeting Monday
night. About 100 people attended.</TE>

<HD>Killer of College Student Ordered to Prison for Life</HD>
<DH>Court: Compton woman apologizes, calls slaying of the
Occidental student 'an accident.' Victim's mother, father describe
depth of family's loss.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>After apologizing for killing an Occidental College senior during a
botched robbery 18 months ago, a 20-year-old Compton woman was
sentenced Tuesday to life in prison without the possibility of
parole.</LD>
<LD>   "I am sorry," Araceli Pena said in Los Angeles County Superior
Court. "It was an accident. And I know how it feels to lose a loved
one."</LD>
<LD>   Pena was convicted in March of first-degree murder after a jury
determined that she had murdered 22-year-old Wendy Soltero during an
attempted robbery on Oct. 28, 2000. Pena was also convicted of two
counts of robbery and three counts of attempted robbery.</LD>
<TE>   Soltero was shot dead in her car in Hollywood while doing a good
deed by picking up two friends who were stranded without a ride. She
was parked in a residential neighborhood when a car pulled up behind
them, and Pena walked up to the car, demanded money and shot Soltero
in the head.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Mark Mooney sentenced Pena after emotional statements from
the victim's family.</TE>
<TE>   Soltero's mother, Elizabeth, called Pena a murderer and a coward.</TE>
<TE>   "The thought of the terror she [Wendy] experienced that night will
haunt me forever," Soltero said. "Not a day goes by that I don't feel
the loss."</TE>
<TE>   After reading letters from his daughter, Gene Soltero told Pena:
"This is who you took from us. I hope you think about it every day of
your life."</TE>
<TE>   Pena then stood and apologized to the Soltero family.</TE>
<TE>   Administrators at the small, private school awarded Soltero an
honorary bachelor's degree in studio art after her death, and
displayed her photography and paintings in a gallery on campus.</TE>
<TE>   Pena's co-defendant, Demetrio Cabrera, 33, is scheduled to be
tried in June in Los Angeles.</TE>

<HD>Church Sued for Abuser's Transfer</HD>
<DH>Scandal: Bishops sent to Orange County a priest convicted
of molestation, suit alleges. Man says he became a victim.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Orange man filed suit Tuesday against the Roman Catholic Church,
alleging that two former bishops conspired to move a Milwaukee priest
who had molested boys there to Orange County, where he is accused of
sexually abusing more minors. In his lawsuit filed in Orange County
Superior Court, Eric Nathan Paino, 25, alleges that Father Sigfried
F. Widera molested him and his older brother in 1985 under the guise
of tucking the boys, then 8 and 7, into bed as a favor to their
single mother.</LD>
<LD>   Widera, who lives in Arizona, could not be reached for comment
Tuesday. He was stripped of his ability to function as a priest in
1986, shortly after Paino's mother complained to the diocese. He has
not been defrocked.</LD>
<LD>   Paino is one of the youngest victims to sue during the church's
4-month-old priest sex scandal.</LD>
<TE>   "The only reason I'm doing this is because this needs to be
stopped," said Paino, a truck driver.</TE>
<TE>   "Not just with Widera, but all other priests."</TE>
<TE>   Last month Paino filed a criminal report with Brea police, who
have jurisdiction over neighboring Yorba Linda, where the incidents
allegedly took place. A police spokesman said a preliminary
investigation determined the that statute of limitations has run out
on the 17-year-old case.</TE>
<TE>   Orange Bishop William Johnson accepted Widera into the diocese in
1976, despite a warning letter from Milwaukee Archbishop William
Cousins that the priest had a "moral problem having to do with a boy
in school." Both Johnson and Cousins are deceased.</TE>
<TE>   Since Widera's first Orange County accuser, an Anaheim man,
stepped forward last month, diocesan officials said four others have
contacted the church.</TE>
<TE>   In Milwaukee, Widera was convicted of sexual misconduct with an
adolescent boy in 1973 and sentenced to three years' probation. He
also was ordered by his archbishop to undergo counseling.</TE>
<TE>   Now police in a Milwaukee suburb are investigating allegations of
another sexual assault by Widera during the 1970s. The case will be
reviewed this week by the local district attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Orange officials said there was nothing in Widera's personnel file
about his criminal conviction, a statement corroborated by a priest
within the diocese at the time.</TE>
<TE>   The archbishop of Milwaukee "had told us [Widera] had gone through
counseling and was declared to be OK and safe," said Bishop of Boise
Michael Patrick Driscoll, who was an advisor to the bishop of Orange
in 1976. "That would never happen today. We were told that it would
not be a problem. I'm really sorry. ... It's a shame we put children
in Orange County at risk."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Milwaukee Archdiocese said they hadn't seen
the suit and couldn't comment.</TE>
<TE>   Katherine K. Freberg, Paino's attorney, called Paino "the poster
boy to show why zero-tolerance [for molesting priests] is needed."</TE>
<TE>   Paino said Widera befriended his family, coming over for dinner,
swimming in the backyard pool, giving rides on his motorcycle and
handing out bags of candy that he kept in the trunk of his car.Paino
said the molestations took place in the summer of 1985. He said his
mother remembered a dinner when her young son said, "I don't want
Father Widera tucking me in bed anymore."</TE>
<TE>   She asked why, and he replied, "I don't like the way he's touching
me." Paino's mother went to church officials, and soon afterward,
Widera was sent to New Mexico for more counseling.</TE>
<TE>   Paino's brother still is considering his legal options, said
Freberg.</TE>
<TE>   In his nine years with the Orange diocese, Widera was at five
parishes: St. Pius V Church in Buena Park, St. Justin Martyr Church
in Anaheim, St. Edward Church in Dana Point, Immaculate Heart of Mary
in Santa Ana, and St. Martin de Porres Church in Yorba Linda. The
Paino family attended services in Yorba Linda.</TE>

<HD>Parents Complain of School Underwear Inspection</HD>
<DH>Privacy: They say vice principal made girls lift their
dresses to prove they weren't wearing thongs to a dance.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>School officials in the Poway Unified School District are
investigating complaints by parents that a female vice principal
required some girls to prove they were not wearing thong underwear to
a school dance.</LD>
<LD>   The incident allegedly occurred at a costume-party dance at Rancho
Bernardo High School in northern San Diego County attended by 725
students.</LD>
<LD>   "We are taking this seriously and want to ensure that any actions
to be taken are based upon the facts," said Supt. Don Phillips.</LD>
<TE>   Parents assert that the vice principal made dozens of girls lift
their dresses to prove that they were not wearing the skimpy
underwear. A male teacher made boys wearing togas show that they were
wearing underwear, the parents maintain.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone is just appalled and devastated," said Kim Teal, whose
daughter, Rebecca, attended the dance Friday. "They definitely
crossed any line of decency."</TE>
<TE>   Eight parents met with Rancho Bernardo High Principal Paul Gentle
on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, the district said it is investigating "steps that
were taken by staff members to ensure appropriate student dress
before entering a high school dance."</TE>
<TE>   Parents say the girls had to display their panties in front of
male students and teachers, who "got to enjoy the peep show," Teal
said.</TE>
<TE>   Phillips said students, staff and others who attended the dance
are being interviewed.</TE>
<TE>   Parents said they believe the inspection was in reaction to
incidents at a dance last year, when one girl bared her breasts and
another took off her underwear.</TE>

<HD>A Dozen Options for Easing Gridlock</HD>
<DH>Traffic: Suggestions for Long Beach Freeway include
building new lanes or a rail line, or doing nothing. Five finalists
will be chosen.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Facing increased truck traffic on an already congested corridor, a
coalition of government agencies Tuesday offered a dozen options for
the Long Beach Freeway, including adding elevated truck lanes,
carpool lanes and a high-speed rail line.</LD>
<LD>   Cost estimates were not included with the 12 alternatives, which
were developed for a group of state transportation officials and
local policymakers along Interstate 710. A committee of local
officials is expected to narrow the options to five finalists by June
before choosing the final plan next spring. Officials expect to
release cost estimates when the five finalists are announced.</LD>
<LD>   Some of the alternatives--such as the option to add a rail line
along the freeway median--would be expensive. But local officials say
a fix is vital to improve traffic flow in the region.</LD>
<TE>   "Although improvements to the Long Beach Freeway are badly needed
and long overdue, some of the proposed alternatives will not be easy
to implement and funding is still an open question," said South Gate
City Councilman Hector De La Torre, chairman of the committee that is
studying the options.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, the alternative selected by the committee would
probably need funding approval by a state or regional transit agency
such as the Metropolitan Transportation Authority or the California
Transportation Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Transportation experts say some of the alternatives could be
financed with tolls for truckers or commuters.</TE>
<TE>   The 710 was designed in the 1950s, assuming trucks would represent
only 5% of the traffic. But today, the freeway is a major route for
trucks hauling cargo between the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach
and distribution centers near East Los Angeles. Big rigs represent
about 13% of the freeway's traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Even more trucks are expected in the future. The ports now
generate about 34,000 daily truck trips. But according to one
estimate, that number will nearly triple by 2020 because of increased
trade with Pacific Rim countries.</TE>
<TE>   The mixture of rush-hour traffic and cargo-hauling trucks can be a
deadly combination. In 2001, the freeway had 616 collisions involving
trucks, including an 11-vehicle pileup in January that killed a judge
and injured nine others when a big-rig driver lost control near the
city of Bell.</TE>
<TE>   "There is room for improvements, definitely," said Margaret
Peterson, a truck driver for 24 years and a safety specialist who
regularly hauls cargo along the Long Beach Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   The 12 alternatives, designed by the engineering firm of Parsons
Brinckerhoff, Quade &amp; Douglas Inc. with suggestions from local
officials and residents, focus on the stretch of freeway between the
ports and the Pomona Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   The alternatives are:</TE>
<TE>   * Do nothing beyond the pavement and median improvements already
underway.</TE>
<TE>   * Encourage the ports and truck drivers to shift their schedules
to keep trucks off the freeway during heavy commute hours.</TE>
<TE>   * Improve freeway ramps and widen adjacent roads by eliminating
some on-street parking. Many cloverleaf-shaped ramps bring traffic to
a crawl because truckers cannot easily navigate the narrow, sharp
curves.</TE>
<TE>   * Improve freeway interchanges and add truck-only connector ramps
in some locations.</TE>
<TE>   * Build one carpool lane along the median in each direction.</TE>
<TE>   * Add a fifth traffic lane in each direction between the ports and
the San Diego Freeway and between Imperial Highway and Atlantic
Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   * Build special "truck bypass lanes" that allow truckers to avoid
congestion at the interchanges with the San Diego, Artesia and
Century freeways.</TE>
<TE>   * Add two traffic lanes in each direction between the ports and
the San Diego Freeway and between Imperial Highway and Atlantic
Boulevard. The rest of the freeway would get one additional lane in
each direction.</TE>
<TE>   * Add two elevated truck lanes in each direction along the median
of the freeway.</TE>
<TE>   * Build two special-purpose lanes--possibly toll lanes--in each
direction along the median.</TE>
<TE>   * Add two elevated carpool lanes in each direction along the
median.</TE>
<TE>   * Add a high-speed rail line along the median. The rail line would
divert from the freeway in South Gate and run along an existing rail
line to Union Station in downtown Los Angeles.</TE>

<HD>2 Deputies Shoot, Kill Ax-Wielding Man in Carson</HD>
<DH>Violence: The 42-year-old was told to put down the weapon,
authorities say, but advanced on an officer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER SINCO KELLEHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies shot and killed an
ax-wielding man Monday night in a Carson garage, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Deputies shot Brian Keith Miller, 42, after he was ordered to put
down the ax, said Sgt. Paul Patterson.</LD>
<LD>   "He refused, saying he wanted them to shoot him," Patterson said
Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   About 7:30 p.m. Monday, the deputies, whose names are being
withheld pending an investigation, responded to a call in the 22700
block of Nicolle Avenue that two brothers were involved in a knife
fight.</TE>
<TE>   Deputies heard moaning in a partially open garage, Patterson said.
One deputy crawled under the door, which was blocked by a car.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, Miller was holding an ax.</TE>
<TE>   The other deputy entered the garage from a back door. Both
deputies repeatedly ordered him to release the ax, Patterson said.
"Then [Miller] raised the ax and began to advance toward the deputy
standing near the door," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Fearing for their safety, both deputies shot at Miller, Patterson
said.</TE>
<TE>   Miller was taken to Harbor-UCLA Medical Center where he died, said
county coroner's spokesman Craig Harvey. An autopsy will be conducted
this week, he said.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Miller's family members gathered outside the
single-story home he shared with his mother. His sister said the
family did not want to comment on Miller's death, saying only that
her brother was unemployed and that the family doesn't hold the
deputies responsible for his death. She declined to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's officials would not discuss the methods deputies used in
dealing with him before using their guns.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no written protocol and we won't talk about procedure
because it's under investigation," Patterson said.</TE>
<TE>   A neighbor across the street said she heard shots coming from
Miller's house Monday night. "I was here playing cards and I thought
it was fireworks," said Erlinda Banania, 57.</TE>
<TE>   Banania said Miller often worked on cars in his driveway and was a
helpful neighbor. "He watches the house for us when my daughter works
late," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Banania said that on Sunday Miller helped her open a kitchen
window when she was locked out of her house. "He wasn't a
troublemaker," she said.</TE>

<HD>Gordon Willey, 89; Archeologist Wrote Books on the Americas</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It wasn't always awards and accolades for the Harvard professor
considered the dean of North, Central and South American archeology.</LD>
<LD>   "In what was no less than five minutes after we had driven into
the morass we were seeing the last vestiges of daylight as the
gray-yellow murk of the swamp was blotting out the horizon....
Besides, a water moccasin had entangled himself in the steering wheel
and was threatening to give us hell if we disturbed him again," he
wrote in his 1940 field notes at the end of a particularly trying
day.</LD>
<LD>   Gordon Randolph Willey, who not only got out of that swamp, but
also went on to write everything from limericks to archeological
novels to the scholarly "Archaeology of the Florida Gulf Coast,"
which established him as an expert and has remained a classic for
more than 50 years, has died. He was 89.</LD>
<TE>   Willey, who taught at Harvard from 1950 until 1987 and was curator
of anthropology at its Peabody Museum, died Sunday of heart failure
in Cambridge, Mass., Harvard officials said.</TE>
<TE>   When the landmark 1949 book about Florida's maize- and
pumpkin-planting Indians was reissued in 1998, an editor's note
praised its enduring usefulness to archeologists and added: "Gordon
Willey himself is a classic."</TE>
<TE>   Willey, in all his research of Native Americans, Mayas and others,
utilized his expertise on pottery to trace cultures chronologically.
The Florida book is considered a concise overview of early archeology
in the area ranging from 1800 to the federally funded research
programs of the Depression in the 1930s. It has provided a baseline
for subsequent research.</TE>
<TE>   Also classic in archeological literature is Willey's two-volume
"Introduction to American Archaeology," published in 1966 and 1971,
and his 1974 "History of American Archaeology," written with his
former student Jeremy Sabloff and now in its third edition.</TE>
<TE>   Revered among scholars of the Maya of Central America, Willey
conducted several excavations in Belize, Guatemala and Honduras.</TE>
<TE>   He co-wrote such books as "The Origins of Maya Civilization" in
1977 and "Lowland Maya Settlement Patterns" in 1981. He also
co-edited "A Consideration of the Early Classic Period in the Maya
Lowlands" in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   Willey is recognized as having created the field of "settlement
pattern studies," in which ruins and detritus are examined to
determine the political, economic and social interaction of ancient
peoples. He pioneered the methodology in Peru's Viru Valley in the
1940s.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Chariton, Iowa, on March 7, 1913, Willey earned his
bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Arizona and
his doctorate from Columbia University. He worked as a Smithsonian
Institution anthropologist until he joined the Harvard faculty.</TE>
<TE>   The awards and accolades did appear regularly to acknowledge his
life-long research. Among the honors were Guatemala's Order of
Quetzal; a fellowship to Cambridge University in England; medals from
the American Anthropological Assn., the Royal Anthropology Institute
of London and the Society of Antiquaries of London; and the Walker
Prize from Boston's Museum of Science.</TE>
<TE>   In his off-duty hours, Willey turned his entertaining field-note
writing style to creating rollicking limericks for students and
friends, plays for Boston's Tavern Club, and archeological mystery
novels such as "Selena."</TE>
<TE>   Willey is survived by two daughters, Alexandra Guralnick and
Winston Adler, and five grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service is scheduled for 10 a.m. May 8 at Christ Church
in Cambridge.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Authorities Tuesday executed a one-legged murderer after denying him
a request to be fitted with a prosthetic device so he could walk to
his death "like a man."</LD>
<LD>   Rodolfo Hernandez, 52, who received a last-minute temporary
reprieve from execution last month so he could give police
information about unsolved murders, was pushed into the death row
prison Huntsville in a wheelchair.</LD>
<LD>   Hernandez, whose diabetes led to the amputation of his left leg
below the knee last summer, accused the state of refusing to fit him
with an artificial leg because of the $8,000 expense.</LD>
<TE>   Prison officials said the reason was a recurring infection.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez was executed for the 1985 murder of a Mexican immigrant.</TE>

<LD>   Driven by the wind, fire exploded across thousands of acres of dry
grass and oak brush near Sonoita, forcing residents to evacuate rural
homes and ranches.</LD>
<LD>   A 3,000-square-foot home and two barns had burned, said Forest
Service spokesman Steve Plevel.</LD>
<TE>   No injuries had been reported.</TE>
<TE>   He said firefighters saved 50 to 100 buildings as the uncontained
fire spread across more than 9,000 acres southeast of Tucson.</TE>
<TE>   Plevel said the focus was on protecting lives and property.</TE>
<TE>   The fire began Monday in the Canelo Hills of the Huachuca
Mountains and grew quickly, driven by winds gusting to 30 mph. The
cause was unknown.</TE>

<HD>Bush Says He Seeks Middle Road</HD>
<DH>Policy: President claims his agenda calls for limited
federal activism. Some compare his moderate philosophy to Clinton's
'New Democrat' approach.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG and RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>In an ambitious speech reflecting on his 15 months in office,
President Bush defined his agenda Tuesday as a results-oriented
alternative to "big government or indifferent government."</LD>
<LD>   Reprising the call for "compassionate conservatism" central to his
2000 presidential campaign, Bush argued for an energetic but limited
federal activism built on policies that enable "people and
communities to help themselves and to help one another."</LD>
<LD>   "We need a government that is focused, effective and close to the
people; a government that does a few things and does them well," he
added, echoing one of his familiar campaign lines.</LD>
<TE>   The speech, delivered to an audience of civic leaders, marked
Bush's most systematic effort in months to define his broad view of
government's proper role--and to make the case that his course
represents a kind of "third way" between traditional liberal and
conservative approaches.</TE>
<TE>   Aides said Bush believes he has given voters a clear sense of his
underlying philosophy in foreign policy, but felt the need to do so
on domestic affairs--before Democrats increase their efforts to
define it for him.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't tell people what you are trying to do, others will
do so for you," said one White House aide.</TE>
<TE>   During his stop in Northern California, which followed appearances
Tuesday in Los Angeles, Bush also spoke at a fund-raising luncheon
for Republican gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon Jr. before
returning to Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Bush used the speech to define a vision of government that he said
linked the disparate elements of his domestic agenda on issues
ranging from education to welfare and health care. Bush framed his
agenda as an alternative to overreliance on government or the free
market to solve social problems.</TE>
<TE>   Bush reiterated traditional conservative themes of limited
government: "America doesn't need more big government, and we've
learned that more money is not always the answer."</TE>
<TE>   But he also emphasized his support for activist government in some
areas and his belief that society cannot rely on the market to solve
problems as much as many conservatives believe.</TE>
<TE>   Bush offered two broad principles for federal action. He argued
that Washington could play a critical role in setting standards and
demanding results, even while giving authority for operating social
programs to local officials, neighborhood charities and individuals.</TE>
<TE>   The clearest example of this is the education reform legislation
he steered through Congress last year. The law gives states more
control over federal education dollars, but requires them to test
students more often in reading and math and intervene in schools that
persistently fail to improve.</TE>
<TE>   Second, Bush argued that federal programs should act as catalysts,
spurring local actions from individuals and communities.</TE>
<TE>   "Government cannot solve every problem, but it can encourage
people and communities to help themselves and to help one another,"
he said, adding: "Often, the truest kind of compassion is to help
citizens build lives of their own."</TE>
<TE>   Bush's call to organize federal action around these principles
marks the closest convergence between his "compassionate
conservatism" and the "New Democrat" agenda forged by former
President Clinton and other centrist Democrats, who presented their
philosophy as a path between conventional liberalism and
conservatism.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Bush's effort to place his agenda between "big government"
and "indifferent government" closely echoed Clinton's 1996
declaration that "the era of big government is over. But we cannot
return to the time when our citizens were left to fend for
themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Reed, Clinton's top domestic policy advisor and now
president of the Democratic Leadership Council, said that Bush's
vision shared common principles with the centrist Democrats. But he
said the two sides are divided by two fundamental differences.</TE>
<TE>   One is that Bush believes Washington should be involved in a
narrower range of issues than most centrist Democrats. Second, and
more important, Reed argued, the $1.3-trillion tax cut Bush pushed
through Congress last year has denied government the funds to invest
in programs that are successful.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's speech returned to the themes he used during his
presidential campaign to court centrist voters as a self-proclaimed
"different kind of Republican."</TE>
<TE>   Even before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, those themes had been
largely muted in Bush's presidency. Apart from education, his months
in office were dominated by polarizing fights over taxes, energy and
the environment that emphasized the more conventionally conservative
aspects of Bush's agenda--and led to a sharp division, along party
lines, in public assessments of his job performance in his first
months.</TE>
<TE>   White House aides say the speech wasn't inspired by immediate
political concerns, but spotlighting moderate themes could have
benefits for Bush. One is that his approval rating is again dropping
among Democratic voters, who, like other Americans, rallied around
him after Sept. 11. One recent GOP poll found that while Bush's
approval rating among Republicans remains at 95%, virtually unchanged
since last fall, among Democrats it has dropped 23 percentage points
to 56%.</TE>
<TE>   The speech may also have been a preemptive strike in the brewing
battle over the federal budget. Like Reed, congressional Democrats
are poised to argue that the cost of Bush's $1.35-trillion tax cut
has denied government the funds to invest in such popular programs as
education or a prescription drug plan for seniors.</TE>
<TE>   Anticipating those arguments, Bush said it was more important to
look at a program's achievements, not its budget. "If a program is
failing to serve people, it makes little difference if we spend twice
as much or half as much. The measure of true compassion is results,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Applying his approach to international policy, Bush said he had
proposed a 50% increase in the government's main foreign aid programs
over the next three years--but recipients are expected to end
corruption, open markets and respect human rights and the rule of
law.</TE>
<TE>   "It is compassionate to increase our international aid. It is
conservative to require the hard reforms that lead to prosperity and
independence," he said.</TE>
<TE>   After his San Jose speech, Bush headlined a fund-raiser for Simon
in nearby Santa Clara. It was the president's second appearance on
Simon's behalf in two days.</TE>
<TE>   The gubernatorial hopeful spoke briefly to the crowd of about
1,000 Republican faithful. Bush was also sparing in his political
remarks, devoting most of his half-hour speech to an update on the
war on terrorism at home and abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's aides estimated that Tuesday's $1,000-a-plate luncheon and
a Monday night bash in Century City would yield more than $4.5
million--funds much needed by the slow-starting campaign.</TE>

<HD>Charity Funded Terror, U.S. Says</HD>
<DH>Courts: Head of Islamic group is arrested after allegations
that foundation funded extremist activities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER and ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>U.S. authorities arrested the Syrian-born head of an international
Islamic charity Tuesday, alleging that his group has funded terrorist
activities for years and has ties to militants who have tried to
acquire nuclear and chemical weapons for Osama bin Laden.</LD>
<LD>   Enaam Arnaout, 39, executive director of the Benevolence
International Foundation, was taken into custody at his home in the
Chicago suburbs and charged with lying under oath in documents his
group had filed in federal court.</LD>
<LD>   Arnaout, now a U.S. citizen, appeared in court in Chicago on
Tuesday afternoon and was being held without bond. He is to be
arraigned next week, and the government indicated that it intends to
fight any effort for his release on bail.</LD>
<TE>   The arrest prompted angry denials from representatives of the
Palos Hills, Ill.-based group, which is one of the largest and most
prominent Muslim charities in the United States, with offices in
Bosnia, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Yemen, Turkey, Georgia and China.</TE>
<TE>   It also infuriated Islamic leaders in the United States, who said
Arnaout's arrest fits a pattern of Justice Department harassment
against Muslims since the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center
and the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   "If you've got evidence of him having breakfast with Osama bin
Laden, then charge him with terrorism, not perjury," said Ibrahim
Hooper, a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations.
"Bring the evidence into court and let him rebut it."</TE>
<TE>   Matt Piers, an attorney for Benevolence International, said the
charges against his client are an unjustified effort by the U.S.
government to make the public believe it is successfully cracking
down on terrorists. He scoffed at the notion that Arnaout is an
associate of Bin Laden, and said Arnaout's efforts to cooperate with
the FBI were rebuffed.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. authorities, however, said Arnaout has been a personal friend
of Bin Laden's for more than a dozen years, and that Al Qaeda has
long used Benevolence International for logistical support, including
the movement of money to fund its terrorist operations.</TE>
<TE>   "Various persons involved in terrorist activities--specifically
including persons trying to obtain chemical and nuclear weapons on
behalf of Al Qaeda--have had contacts with [Benevolence] offices and
personnel," according to an affidavit filed in support of Arnaout's
arrest by a Chicago-based FBI counter-terrorism agent, Michael
Walker.</TE>
<TE>   The group has also "made efforts" to provide Chechen rebels and a
related military group with money, an X-ray machine and "anti-mine
boots, among other things," the affidavit said.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Fitzgerald, U.S. attorney for the Northern District of
Illinois, announced Arnaout's arrest at a news conference in Chicago.
At Justice Department headquarters in Washington, Atty. Gen. John
Ashcroft denounced the group, saying it aided and abetted terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Arnaout's arrest, Fitzgerald said, was an attempt to "vindicate"
legions of unwitting supporters who gave money to Benevolence
International for what they thought were humanitarian causes, but who
were allegedly funding terrorism instead.</TE>
<TE>   "The donors were the victims," Fitzgerald said. "We are seeking to
make sure that people do not raise money for violence."</TE>
<TE>   Fitzgerald said agents recently recovered evidence in Benevolence
International's Bosnia office, including photos and correspondence
"that obviously indicates a relationship between [Arnaout and Bin
Laden] dating back to the 1980s." Authorities also said Arnaout
traveled with Bin Laden and associated with key Al Qaeda leaders.</TE>
<TE>   In 1989, Arnaout traveled to a Pakistan airport to pick up one of
Bin Laden's wives and hosted her at his nearby residence for a week
until Bin Laden and his bodyguards could come get her, the affidavit
added.</TE>
<TE>   A cooperating government witness "explained that if Arnaout had
not been a trusted associate of . . . Bin Laden, Arnaout would not
have been trusted with the care of one of Bin Laden's wives," it
said.</TE>
<TE>   Even Benevolence's origins are suspect, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   The company records, seized about a month ago, indicate that
Benevolence International was founded in the 1980s by a wealthy Saudi
Arabian associate of Bin Laden. That sheik, Adil Abdul Galil Batargy,
later transferred control to Arnaout, authorities said. The group
established its headquarters in the United States in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   The records also implicate Mamdouh Salim, a known Al Qaeda
operative now awaiting trial in New York on terrorism-related
charges, as an associate of the charity. The affidavit said Salim
approved the purchase of uranium by an associate so that Al Qaeda
could attempt to develop nuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft and Fitzgerald said the investigation is continuing.</TE>
<TE>   The documents that prompted Arnaout's arrest were written in
support of a lawsuit Benevolence International filed against the U.S.
government three months ago, after it froze the group's assets as
part of a financial crackdown on alleged terrorist organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Since the asset freeze, Benevolence International has said in two
sworn declarations filed in federal court that it is a "faith-based
humanitarian organization that engages in charitable work around the
world," and that it never engaged in or funded terrorist or military
activity.</TE>
<TE>   Funds for the charity have been used "only to assist the poor and
the needy. BIF abides strictly by those requirements," the group
said. "BIF abhors terrorism and all forms of violence against human
beings."</TE>
<TE>   However, the criminal complaint alleges that Arnaout was
purposefully lying in making those remarks, and when he wrote: "I
have no idea or understanding as to why the government has taken
these [asset-blocking] actions against BIF."</TE>
<TE>   Arnaout acknowledges that he had "casual" contact with Bin Laden
in the late 1980s when both were living in Peshawar, Pakistan, and
Bin Laden was funding road construction there. Arnaout was a student
at the time.</TE>
<TE>   "That doesn't make him a terrorist," Piers said. "Peshawar wasn't
that big a town. Bin Laden was a prominent guy."</TE>
<TE>   Charging Arnaout with perjury for defending his group's reputation
in court "is a back-door legal technicality," said Hooper, of the
Council on American-Islamic Relations. "It creates the impression
there's nothing" of substance to the government's charges.</TE>
<TE>   "This certainly won't help" the Bush administration's effort to
mend fences with the Muslim community over the detention and
interrogation of thousands of Muslim Americans after Sept. 11, Hooper
said.</TE>

<HD>Hatch Supports Measure on Cloning</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AARON ZITNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In the well-worn trenches of the abortion battle, Republican Sen.
Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) has been a reliable fighter for the unborn.
By supporting a ban on federal funding for abortion and a
constitutional amendment to overturn Roe vs. Wade, Hatch has argued
for protecting the embryo as it grows in the womb.</LD>
<LD>   But on Tuesday, the Utah lawmaker broke with his antiabortion
allies and threw his support to a bill that would allow scientists to
create human embryos through cloning, then destroy them in the course
of medical research. With the Senate vote on cloning too close to
call, the support of a conservative, antiabortion lawmaker gave a
significant boost to those who want to preserve cloning as a legal
technique in research.</LD>
<LD>   It also showed how science has forced lawmakers to think in new
ways about whether a human embryo is a human life. In essence, Hatch
said, an embryo in the womb is a human being, deserving of
protection. But an embryo created through cloning is not, he said,
and may be destroyed to help find cures for disease.</LD>
<TE>   Cloning for research "is pro-life and pro-family," Hatch told a
news conference. "It enhances--it does not diminish--human life." He
said that "a critical part of being pro-life is to support measures
that help the living."</TE>
<TE>   The stance is sure to earn the senator animosity from the
antiabortion movement. But analysts in Utah said that Hatch is so
popular, the political risks are low. He belongs to the Mormon
Church, which has no specific teaching on cloning.</TE>
<TE>   The fight over cloning is one of the most emotional issues before
Congress this year. There is broad support for banning cloning to
produce children, but division over whether to bar scientists from
trying to make cloned embryos for their stem cells, which in turn
might be fashioned into cures for disease.</TE>
<TE>   The House already has voted to bar all human cloning, and
antiabortion groups have made a total cloning ban their top
legislative issue this year. Last month, President Bush called for a
total ban, saying that cloning would lead "toward a society in which
human beings are grown for spare body parts, and children are
engineered to custom specifications."</TE>
<TE>   But senators are thought to be evenly split on whether to bar
cloning in research laboratories. Each side claims support from about
45 senators, leaving about 10 undecided.</TE>
<TE>   "Sen. Hatch has stature as a conservative Republican, and his
support certainly makes it easier for others to come to our side,"
said Sean Tipton, spokesman for the American Society for Reproductive
Medicine, which supports cloning for medical research. Among the
undecided are antiabortion Sens. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.), John McCain
(R-Ariz.) and John B. Breaux (D-La.).</TE>
<TE>   Hatch, who also supports federally funded stem cell research,
announced his position Tuesday in an article he wrote for a home
state paper, the Salt Lake Tribune, and at a news conference where he
and three other senators introduced a bill to allow cloning in
research. The bill sets fines and jail time for anyone who transfers
a cloned embryo to a womb to produce a child.</TE>
<TE>   The bill will compete with one sponsored by Sens. Sam Brownback
(R-Kan.) and Mary Landrieu (D-La.) that would bar cloning for any
purpose, mirroring the measure that passed the House last summer.</TE>
<TE>   "My decision came after countless hours of study, reflection and,
yes, prayer," Hatch said. He added: "Once I identified and weighed
what I believe to be the relevant factors, the decision itself was
not--and I repeat not--a close call."</TE>
<TE>   Hatch did not mention Bush by name, but his speech offered a
response to the dark vision of research cloning laid out by the
president. The technique, he said, could "help over 100 million
Americans who are struggling with the day-to-day challenges,
currently, of incurable disease." Banning it, he said would be "a
tragic mistake."</TE>
<TE>   Hatch said his Mormon beliefs led him to oppose cloning as a
reproductive technique. "This would directly intervene with God's
sacred plan for human reproduction by a man and a woman within the
bonds of marriage," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hatch also said he believes that human life begins "in a mother's
nurturing womb," not in a laboratory dish. But cloning produces
something different: embryos that are not intended to be placed in a
womb, and that are created by merging an egg and an adult cell,
without fertilization by sperm.</TE>
<TE>   He said this type of cloning produced "living cells," but not
human beings. Hatch called the product of cloning an "unfertilized,
electronically activated embryo," language that antiabortion groups
said was intended to play down the humanity of the embryo. Hatch also
said he preferred the term "regenerative medicine" to "cloning," a
word that some people believe carries unpleasant connotations.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Hatch took a similar stance in the debate over federal
funding for stem cell research using embryos created and frozen at
fertility clinics. Those embryos, he said then, were not equivalent
to human beings because they had not been placed in a womb.</TE>
<TE>   Hatch's support for stem cell research was a boost for research
advocates. After announcing his stance, he appeared often on
television to advocate stem cell research.</TE>
<TE>   Douglas Johnson, legislative director of the National Right to
Life Committee, questioned Hatch's view of the embryo. Cloning, he
said, produces "a self-directed organism that is a member of the
species Homo sapiens.... If a child was born from it, would Sen.
Hatch say that child was not a human being?"</TE>
<TE>   Michael Otterson, a spokesman for the Mormon Church, said that the
church had no comment on Hatch's announcement and that it had issued
no policy on cloning. In 1995, church leaders issued a statement on
the family that said: "The sacred powers of procreation are to be
employed only between man and woman, lawfully wedded as husband and
wife."</TE>
<TE>   Church spokesmen declined to say whether creating a cloned embryo
was considered a form of procreation.</TE>
<TE>   The church did not criticize Hatch after he supported stem cell
research last year, issuing instead a statement that said the
research merited "cautious scrutiny."</TE>
<TE>   Ted Wilson, a former mayor of Salt Lake City who teaches political
science at the University of Utah, said Hatch's stance would cost him
little at home. "Orrin is beyond worrying about costs," said Wilson,
who ran against Hatch in 1982 as a Democrat. "He's so well
established as a conservative Republican. He leans liberal on several
occasions, and so he even engages a certain amount of Democratic
support."</TE>
<TE>   Randy Simmons, chairman of the political science department at
Utah State University in Logan, said Hatch "likes to show he's
unpredictable and not a right-wing crazy, which is what people
sometimes try to do when they run against him. I don't see how this
hurts him."</TE>

<HD>Corps to Suspend Work on 150 Projects Across U.S.</HD>
<DH>Government: Agency has been facing criticism over spending
billions on public works construction.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Army Corps of Engineers is suspending work on about 150
congressionally approved water projects to review the economics used
to justify them, an unprecedented response to criticism of Corps
analyses inside and outside the Bush administration.</LD>
<LD>   Maj. Gen. Robert Griffin, director of the Corps' civil works
program, said the Corps will immediately stop work on billions of
dollars' worth of active public works projects that are not yet under
construction.</LD>
<LD>   Griffin said any project with a pre-1999 economic analysis will
need a new analysis before it can proceed. The Corps will also review
newer projects where questions about economics, engineering or the
environment "may have resulted in significant changes in project
justification or support."</LD>
<TE>   The Corps will not provide a list of affected projects until the
end of the week, but sources said they will include scores of the
agency's most controversial efforts to build levees and pumps for
flood control, dredge rivers and ports for navigation, and pump sand
onto beaches for recreation.</TE>
<TE>   Corps spokesman Homer Perkins said he assumed the list would
include such projects as a $165-million flood control pump in the
Mississippi Delta to a $690-million widening of a New Orleans barge
canal.</TE>
<TE>   An analysis by Taxpayers for Common Sense found $8.1 billion worth
of projects with economic analyses from before 1992.</TE>
<TE>   "This action is part of a more comprehensive initiative to ensure
that Corps projects are a sound investment for our nation and are
proposed in an environmentally sustainable way," Griffin said. "It is
essential that Corps projects keep up with the pace of change."</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists and fiscal conservatives hailed the
announcement, saying the Corps finally seems to be acknowledging the
problems they have complained about for years.</TE>
<TE>   In December 2000, even an internal Pentagon investigation
concluded that Corps studies were tainted by a deep institutional
bias toward approving large-scale construction projects the agency
would then get to build itself.</TE>
<TE>   "The pressure has been building, and it looks like the dam is
starting to break," said David Conrad of the National Wildlife
Federation. The critics did warn that the Corps might be trying to
create an illusion of action to prevent a growing cadre of would-be
reformers from taking real action. President Bush's budget called for
deep cuts and major changes at the Corps, and a congressional Corps
Reform Caucus formed in 2000 has built momentum for legislation to
overhaul the agency. In March, Bush budget director Mitchell Daniels
Jr. helped engineer the ouster of Corps civilian chief Michael
Parker, who had complained publicly about the proposed budget cuts.</TE>
<TE>   Parker's ouster provoked a firestorm of outrage on Capitol Hill;
one House Democrat recommended that he should get a tickertape parade
for pushing for more money for the Corps.</TE>
<TE>   Howard Marlowe, a lobbyist for communities with beach projects,
said Congress will not be happy if the reviews cause delays and cost
overruns to projects it has already approved.</TE>
<TE>   "It all depends how much review is required," Marlowe said. "It's
a good idea for the Corps to be diligent about its economics. It's
good damage control, and it's good quality control as well. The
question is: What's the next step?"</TE>
<TE>   In his statement, Griffin described the action as a "limited
review," saying that some projects will proceed quickly, while others
may require more serious review.</TE>
<TE>   He said that "Corps projects across the nation protect lives and
property, improve our quality of life and ensure and enhance the
nation's environment, economic prosperity and national defense."</TE>

<HD>With Funds Low, Alabama Courts Suspend Jury Trials</HD>
<DH>Justice: Hundreds of cases, including the 1963 Birmingham
church bombing, are put on hold to plug shortfall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC SLATER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BIRMINGHAM, Ala.</DL>
<LD>Jury selection in the infamous 1963 Birmingham church bombing was set
to begin this week. A woman was finally going to get her day in court
over a costly fender-bender. A health care company was set to contest
its tax bill.</LD>
<LD>   Those cases, and hundreds like them across the state, are now on
hold because Alabama's top judge--faced with a court system that is
running out of money--has called a five-month moratorium on most jury
trials.</LD>
<LD>   Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy S. Moore hopes to make up the
$2.7-million shortfall by saving the $10 (plus 5 cents per driving
mile) that jurors are paid each day they serve.</LD>
<TE>   With jury boxes empty since Monday, however, the ramifications of
his decision are becoming obvious--even as officials seek another
solution.</TE>
<TE>   Inmates are beginning to file motions seeking speedy trials.
Attorneys are talking about even more lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   And after 39 years, the world will have to continue waiting to
find out if former Ku Klux Klansman Bobby Frank Cherry planted the
bomb at the 16th Street Baptist Church that killed four young black
girls dressed in their Sunday best.</TE>
<TE>   Cherry, 72, would be the third man to be tried in the case--one of
the seminal and most brutal events of the civil rights era.</TE>
<TE>   "That old saying that justice delayed is justice denied--well,
it's overused, but it's true," said Jefferson County Deputy Circuit
Court Clerk Earl Carter. "We'll have jails backing up. We'll have
lawsuits. This is going to cause a lot of problems."</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, the courts asked the state Legislature for $124.7
million to cover annual operating costs. Lawmakers budgeted $122
million. Many jurists figured the difference would come through,
eventually.</TE>
<TE>   But with five months to go until the end of the fiscal year Sept.
30--and the extra $2.7 million nowhere in sight--Moore ordered the
austerity measures.</TE>
<TE>   He implemented a hiring freeze. He laid off 170 part-time
employees. And he halted jury trials, criminal and civil.</TE>
<TE>   Moore, a Republican known nationally for his efforts to have the
Ten Commandments posted in public buildings, has feuded over court
funding before with Democratic Gov. Donald Siegelman. Some have
accused both of playing politics with justice--Moore trying to
demonstrate what might happen without budget increases and Siegelman
showing what might happen to those who openly goad the governor.</TE>
<TE>   But the shortfall is real, residents have learned, and no one had
come up with a better idea to solve the problem. Both men seemed to
be enjoying the benefit of the doubt--until Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   That's when Moore rejected the governor's proposal to loan the
courts a half-million dollars, to be repaid with uncollected fines.
It wasn't enough, Moore said. And besides, how could the loan be
repaid with funds that the court had been unable to collect?</TE>
<TE>   Moore said the governor instead should give the court system $1.2
million from an emergency fund to get things going. No dice,
Siegelman said, noting that virtually every state agency was dealing
with budget constraints.</TE>
<TE>   Alabama's top judges rank among the highest paid in the country,
its mid-level judges in the middle--this in a state that came in 44th
in average annual income in 2001, at $23,471.</TE>
<TE>   This isn't the first time Alabama trials have been endangered. In
1977, using the same Alabama law, and in a similar cost-cutting
measure, then-Chief Justice C.C. "Bo" Torbert was on the verge of
halting trials when the governor and Legislature came through with
more money.</TE>
<TE>   This is the first time in recent history, at least, that such
drastic measures have actually been implemented, anywhere in the
country, officials here said.</TE>
<TE>   Some local authorities, realizing the problems a court lock-down
would cause in this state of 4 million people, have decided to take
action on their own.</TE>
<TE>   The commissioners of Jefferson County--which includes Birmingham
and is the state's largest--voted last week to spend $272,000 to
restart criminal jury trials May 6, even though those are state, not
county, proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   While the highest-ranking jurist in this state does battle with
Alabama's governor, the system stands to become the political pawn,
many here say.</TE>
<TE>   "The victims and the defendants are awaiting their day in court,"
said Jerry Fielding, president of the Alabama Circuit Judge's Assn.
"You have to remember, that speedy trial issue is mentioned in the
Constitution."</TE>
<TE>   At an annex to the Jefferson County Courthouse, attorneys on
Tuesday filed motions and nonjury trials went on without a hitch. But
jury boxes were empty throughout the gray, chilly building.</TE>
<TE>   "It's bizarre, really bizarre," said a court clerk who spoke on
condition of anonymity. "You're going to have lawsuit after lawsuit.
If this continues, it's going to cause havoc."</TE>

<HD>Universe Ready for Its Close-Up</HD>
<DH>Space: The first photos from newly installed camera in
Hubble Space Telescope show some of the deepest views of far-away
galaxies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ F. KAY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new camera installed in the Hubble Space Telescope in March is
capturing images of some of the most distant features of the
universe, said scientists who released the camera's first snapshots
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The camera "is a wider window, it's a clearer window," said
Holland Ford, an astronomy professor at Johns Hopkins University who
led the team that built the camera. "With this camera, we will get
the deepest view of the universe that humanity has ever had."</LD>
<LD>   These pictures of colliding galaxies and swirling nebulas taken by
the new Advanced Camera for Surveys each took about one day to shoot.
In contrast, the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2, built at JPL and
installed in 1993, took 10 days to make images of distant galaxies.</LD>
<TE>   The Advanced Camera doubles the resolution and field of view of
the Wide Field, which offered researchers a tiny, postage-stamp view
of the sky, said deputy investigator Garth Illingworth, an astronomy
professor at UC Santa Cruz. The new camera is also five times as
sensitive.</TE>
<TE>   The improved resolution allows scientists to see dim objects that
have traveled farther away from Earth as the universe expanded, and
are therefore older.</TE>
<TE>   This is like getting information from what Ford calls the
"twilight zone"--the time period just after the Big Bang that has
gone unseen by current telescopes because the objects are too far
away.</TE>
<TE>   Ford estimates that scientists, using the new camera, will see as
many stars and galaxies within the next year as were discovered in
the entire 12 years of the Hubble's existence.</TE>
<TE>   Among the photos released Tuesday that particularly excited the
researchers was a shot of the "Tadpole Galaxy," located 420 million
light-years away from our solar system in the constellation Draco.</TE>
<TE>   But it is what lies behind the brilliant streak of stars streaming
away from the spiral galaxy that really excited them.</TE>
<TE>   About 3,000 dim, distant galaxies could be identified in the
background of that image, some from within a billion years of the
birth of the universe. Deep Field images of the same area showed only
1,500 galaxies.</TE>
<TE>   Because it takes so long for light to travel such long distances,
"we're seeing [galaxies] when they were infants," Ford said.</TE>
<TE>   It would take a lot of squinting to find the celestial bodies in a
newspaper photograph, however. Those images are too small. At a news
conference in Washington, Ford and Illingworth used an
8-foot-by-8-foot enlargement to demonstrate their claims.</TE>
<TE>   The Advanced Camera takes 16-million megapixels per shot, which
means each image contains an enormous amount of information. The best
digital cameras on the market today shoot about three to four
megapixels.</TE>
<TE>   Another image of two colliding galaxies called "The Mice" shows
what could eventually happen to the Milky Way we call home.</TE>
<TE>   As galaxies expand, they combine with those nearby. The two spiral
galaxies exerted forces on each other and developed long mouse-like
tails as a result.</TE>
<TE>   Ford said the Milky Way, which contains our solar system, will
interact with a galaxy in the constellation Andromeda in several
billion years. Each will probably develop similar tails.</TE>

<HD>Judge Rejects 9/11 Perjury Indictment</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Decrying the U.S. government's handling of the case, a federal judge
Tuesday dismissed the perjury indictment of a Jordanian-born college
student from San Diego who had initially denied, then admitted,
knowing one of the Sept. 11 hijackers.</LD>
<LD>   In ruling that authorities had misbehaved in the case of Osama
Awadallah, U.S. District Judge Shira A. Scheindlin declared
unconstitutional the Bush administration's policy of holding material
witnesses in prison before they appeared in front of a grand jury
investigating the attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Awadallah has been free on bail since December.</LD>
<TE>   "Since 1789, no Congress has granted the government the authority
to imprison an innocent person in order to guarantee that he will
testify before a grand jury conducting a criminal investigation," she
wrote.</TE>
<TE>   If upheld, the ruling could have a significant impact on the
government's handling of grand jury witnesses in its terrorism
crackdown.</TE>
<TE>   Criticizing Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft by name, Scheindlin attacked
his philosophy of aggressively detaining material witnesses as "an
illegitimate use" of the law.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft called the decision "an anomaly" by a single trial judge,
and defended the use of material witness warrants to aid the terror
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "The department's use of material witness warrants is fully
consistent with the law and long-standing practice," Ashcroft said,
adding that "numerous other judges" have authorized such warrants in
similar circumstances. Manhattan U.S. Atty. James B. Comey said the
government is considering an appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Jesse Berman, one of Awadallah's lawyers, said he hoped the
decision would have some influence on Ashcroft and the government's
handling of its search for terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe they should be a bit more contrite before trying to play
macho with the public. Certainly hundreds of people have been treated
not just in a shabby way, but in a brutal way," Berman said. Shortly
after Sept. 11, agents found a scrap of paper with the words "Osama
589-5316" in the glove compartment of a car abandoned by Nawaf
al-Hazmi, a hijacker of American Airlines Flight 77 at Washington's
Dulles International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI traced the number to a home where Awadallah, a 21-year-old
student at Grossmont College in El Cajon, lived briefly two years
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   He was arrested Sept. 20 in San Diego and brought to New York. In
grand jury appearances, he admitted meeting Al-Hazmi at work and at a
mosque, but denied knowing Khalid al-Mihdhar, another hijacker.</TE>
<TE>   When shown a college examination book in which he had written the
name Khalid, he admitted knowing the second man and was charged with
perjury.</TE>
<TE>   Scheindlin found that Awadallah's arrest warrant contained
intentional misrepresentations and omissions.</TE>
<TE>   She said that an FBI affidavit accompanying the warrant failed to
disclose that Awadallah had substantial ties to San Diego, he had
been extremely cooperative, and the phone number found in the
hijacker's car had not been used by Awadallah for 18 months.</TE>

<HD>'Disease Knows No Politics,' Health Institute Nominee Says</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Elias Zerhouni, President Bush's nominee to head the National
Institutes of Health, sped through a largely amiable confirmation
hearing Tuesday, pledging to abide by the president's restrictions on
stem cell research policy but affirming the role of NIH director as a
dispassionate scientific advisor.</LD>
<LD>   "Disease knows no politics," Zerhouni told the Senate Health,
Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. "I believe the NIH and its
director should not be or made to be factional but must always remain
factual."</LD>
<LD>   Zerhouni, head of Johns Hopkins University Hospital's radiology
department, appeared likely to receive overwhelming support when the
committee votes today to send his nomination to the Senate floor.
Committee Chairman Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) predicted the full
Senate would confirm Zerhouni as early as this week.</LD>
<TE>   If confirmed, Zerhouni, 51, would fill a job that has been vacant
since Dr. Harold Varmus stepped down more than two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   His expected confirmation comes at the end of a period of
unprecedented growth at the agency, the director of which helps set
the national medical research agenda and manages a nearly $30-billion
budget that embraces more than two dozen institutes. The NIH's budget
has nearly doubled over the last five years.</TE>
<TE>   An immigrant who came to this country from Algiers with a few
hundred dollars and little command of English, Zerhouni was held up
by several senators as an example of the American dream. He was
accompanied to the hearing by his wife and three children, his mother
and a childhood friend from Algeria.</TE>
<TE>   Zerhouni faced mild questioning on some of the biggest issues
facing scientists, including the ethics of cutting-edge research, the
need to protect people participating in scientific trials and the
lack of diversity in many science-based fields.</TE>
<TE>   At Johns Hopkins, Zerhouni played a crucial role in creating the
university's Institute for Cell Technology. That led to speculation
that his view of stem cell research was probably more expansive than
President Bush's.</TE>
<TE>   "I was instrumental in creating an institute for stem cell
engineering primarily because I was concerned about the lack of any
federal funding to advance fundamental research still needed in this
new and fledgling field," he said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   But, he added, he believed that "in the current state of science,"
Bush's decision last August to use federal funds for research limited
to existing embryonic stem cell lines was "an important advance."
Zerhouni said that before that, he had spoken to many scientists
reluctant to pursue stem cell research because of the great burden of
trying to raise money solely from private sources.</TE>
<TE>   "Without federal funds," he said, "it is hard for me to see how
you develop a field of science in this country."</TE>
<TE>   Zerhouni said he believed the existing stem cell lines would be
sufficient to conduct basic research, and he ducked questions about
what he would do if they were not.</TE>
<TE>   Pressed by Sen. Paul Wellstone (D-Minn.) about whether he would
advocate expanding available lines if research showed promise in
treating debilitating diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's,
Zerhouni said: "Once those pathways become clear, I will be the first
one to assess that information" and provide it to others.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure if that was a yes or a no," Wellstone said. "I don't
think it was quite what I was hoping to hear, but I'll follow up with
you later."</TE>
<TE>   In the only contentious moment of the 90-minute hearing, Sen.
Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) bristled when Zerhouni seemed to dodge a
question she asked about how he would recruit and retain scientists,
as well as attract more minorities and women to the field.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no easy answers," Zerhouni said.</TE>

<HD>Wider Security Effort Urged</HD>
<DH>Security: U.S. is too focused on 9/11-style attack,
ignoring new types of threats, a think tank says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FAYE FIORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration's homeland security strategy is too narrowly
focused on preventing a recurrence of the Sept. 11 attacks while
paying little attention to new forms of terrorism, a prominent
research group concluded Tuesday in one of the most sweeping
assessments of the new policy to date.</LD>
<LD>   The Brookings Institution warned that security measures have been
geared toward airline hijackings and anthrax, while failing to
address methods of destruction yet unseen in the United States, from
lethal bioterrorism in the air ducts of major buildings to hazardous
materials slipped in on uninspected cargo ships.</LD>
<LD>   "It thus concentrates on the 'last war' rather than the possible
next one," a team of seven Brookings scholars concluded, referring to
the administration's $38-billion budget plan for homeland security.
"The danger is that the nation will pursue a somewhat scattershot
approach to countering terrorism without a broader strategic
framework."</LD>
<TE>   Overall, the Washington-based think tank warned that the plan put
forth by Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge does more to guard such
prime targets as subways and sports arenas than to protect the nation
at large. Vulnerable sites are plentiful, and focusing on a few
leaves others susceptible. That could result in billions spent on a
plan that does not significantly reduce the risk of mass casualties
or economic damage.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if significant resources are dedicated to protect some
sites, terrorists can shift their efforts toward less-protected
ones," the report said, adding: "Nonetheless, an effective homeland
security strategy can substantially complicate the efforts of any
terrorist group....Good homeland security is far from hopeless."</TE>
<TE>   The report called for expanded security measures, including:</TE>
<TE>   * Better protection of the nation's borders. While air security
and immigration controls have increased since the attacks on New York
and Virginia, tons of cargo stream into the nation's ports daily
without inspection.</TE>
<TE>   * Upgraded databases to warn of known or suspected terrorists.
Although intelligence and law enforcement agencies are working to
share information, government technology has failed to move far
enough or fast enough. Data should be available to universities,
airlines and immigration services, and all branches of government.</TE>
<TE>   * Broader domestic protection to stop terrorists who might already
be in the country. The study advocated a substantial increase in FBI
counter-terrorism staffing with better surveillance, including
national identity cards or face-recognition technology.</TE>
<TE>   * Greater efforts to prevent bio-terrorism using the ventilation
systems of buildings, subways and stadiums.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the report overlaps measures already under review by the
Bush administration. At a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing
Tuesday, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell defended a request for
more money this year to pay for better border security and public
address systems.</TE>
<TE>   The Brookings report faulted Bush's $38-billion budget request as
too low, concluding that it would take as much as $45 billion a year
for the job--about 15% of defense aspending. To offset the cost, it
suggested scaling back the proposed increase in defense spending or
freezing some planned tax cuts.</TE>

<HD>Risk of Head Injuries in Soccer Told</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ F. KAY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Adolescent soccer players need better education about the symptoms of
concussion and dangers of playing with head injuries, medical experts
said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   In a new report, the Institute of Medicine, part of the National
Academy of Sciences, said that studies of the effects of
"heading"--hitting the ball with the head--have been inconclusive and
that additional research is needed.</LD>
<LD>   But the risk of concussion in contact sports, including soccer is
real, according to the report.</LD>
<TE>   Studies on animals show that a subject who receives a concussion
while the brain is still recovering from an earlier blow can suffer a
loss of memory and cognitive function, said Dr. Albert Hergenroeder,
chief of adolescent medicine and sports medicine at Baylor College
Medical School.</TE>
<TE>   If a child who has been injured returns to play too early,
"they're injuring a brain that's already vulnerable," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Many players, coaches, referees and parents do not know all the
possible symptoms of concussion, the report noted. Amnesia or loss of
consciousness are the most dramatic But players who experience
symptoms such as headaches, inattention and dizziness for more than
15 minutes should not return to play until they are symptom-free for
a week, the report recommended.</TE>
<TE>   "You can have a significant concussion and not lose
consciousness," Hergenroeder said.</TE>
<TE>   All support staff around soccer players need to be educated about
the warning signs--including primary care physicians, said Dr. Jill
Brooks, director of the neuropsychology program at the Robert Wood
Johnson University Medical Group in New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   The report does not advocate the use of helmets, which can lead to
even more aggressive play, Hergenroeder said.</TE>
<TE>   "When you put a hard shell on somebody, they feel invincible," he
said.</TE>

<HD>Shopping With Big Brother</HD>
<DH>The latest trend in market research is using surveillance
devices such as hidden microphones to spy on shoppers. Such tracking
is legal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>As a savvy advertising executive, Tina Wilcox knows what sells. And
she has a hunch that $70 air freshener will not.</LD>
<LD>   But there's a manufacturer convinced that folks will pay perfume
prices for a decorative spritzer wrapped in fabric and filled with
scents reminiscent of fresh-baked cookies, or mossy summer-camp
hikes, or grandma's floral soap. He wants Wilcox to test his product
in the market.</LD>
<LD>   So she opens up her laboratory: a retail store wired to spy on
shoppers.</LD>
<TE>   The Once Famous boutique is invitingly eclectic, jammed with artsy
accessories and upscale home furnishings, from velvet beaded pillows
to ornately carved chairs to china imprinted with the Eiffel Tower.
But hidden amid the jumble, surveillance microphones and video
cameras record shoppers' every move.</TE>
<TE>   The boutique is an elaborate attempt to learn what all
manufacturers and retailers want to know: why shoppers buy what they
buy and ultimately, how they think.</TE>
<TE>   Which displays snag their attention? Where do they linger? What do
they ignore? How do they react to a bargain? What do they mutter to
justify a splurge?</TE>
<TE>   The traditional way to answer these questions has been simply to
ask them. Researchers would intercept random shoppers as they
browsed, for on-the-spot interviews. Or they would gather a dozen
customers into a "focus group."</TE>
<TE>   Many marketing experts, however, now find such forums too
contrived, and too easily manipulated: Participants tend to give the
answer they think the researcher wants, not their honest opinion.</TE>
<TE>   So the latest trend in the science of psyching out the shopper--a
trend propelled by the development of new technology--is
"observational research," otherwise known as "retail ethnography."</TE>
<TE>   Market analysts monitor how shoppers move through a store, what
they pick up and how they handle it, how much time they spend
comparing prices or reading labels. "You get a purer reaction,"
Wilcox explains.</TE>
<TE>   Once Famous takes this new tactic to an extreme because the store
was set up for the purpose of conducting research. Marketing experts
say it's the only retail lab in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Where surveillance technology is in use elsewhere, it's integrated
into existing stores. From convenience marts to department stores to
national chains with thousands of outlets, just about any retail
environment can be wired as a clandestine lab.</TE>
<TE>   Networks of hidden cameras can size up each person who enters a
store and follow him as he moves from aisle to aisle, recording how
long he stops at each point. Such information, multiplied by tens of
thousands of consumers, can help retailers identify which marketing
and display techniques woo the most shoppers. That's data no focus
group could give.</TE>
<TE>   "If you stop shoppers coming out of a store, I don't think they
can tell you, 'There was this [display] near the front door that felt
awkward so I looked away, and because of that, I missed all the new
merchandise laid out to the left,' " said Kirthi Kalyanam, associate
director of the Retail Management Institute at Santa Clara
University.</TE>
<TE>   Surveillance also can be used to gauge how shoppers react to
specific products.</TE>
<TE>   If a woman dallies at a cosmetics counter, for instance, a camera
might zoom in to capture her expression. Studying the video later,
analysts can see whether she's intrigued by a new shade of lipstick,
struggling with a hard-to-open package or intently comparing prices.
Cosmetics companies can then use these observations to refine their
products or tailor their advertising.</TE>
<TE>   "We can learn things about consumer behavior by observing real
consumers that we cannot learn any other way," said Leonard L. Berry,
who founded the Center for Retailing Studies at Texas A&amp;M University.</TE>
<TE>   That's why Wilcox set up Once Famous.</TE>
<TE>   Wilcox, 46, is the chief creative officer of Fame, a subsidiary of
advertising giant Omnicom Group Inc. Fame markets itself as a "retail
brand agency" that helps chain stores define a distinctive image. The
agency also works with manufacturers to design and launch new
products. Among its clients: Target Stores, General Mills, Tupperware
and Energizer Batteries.</TE>
<TE>   When Fame moved into cavernous new downtown headquarters last
year--its 63 employees get around on scooters--Wilcox hit upon the
notion of using the front 1,800 square feet of space for a "retail
laboratory." She would open a real store that would attract real
shoppers, and use it to run experiments for clients. Her aim was not
to make money, but to observe how money is made.</TE>
<TE>   From her stuffy control room, Wilcox watched the other day as
store clerks subtly steered shoppers toward the table with the $70
air fresheners. Many appeared to like the scents. Then they checked
the price.</TE>
<TE>   Eyebrows shot up. Eyes widened. Lips pursed.</TE>
<TE>   "Whew," one woman whistled.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd maybe use a Glade PlugIn," a man said, hastily putting down
the spray and backing off.</TE>
<TE>   Listening on her headset, Wilcox grimaced. It was just as she had
thought: The price would have to come down, way down. Maybe she'd
test it again at $40, or $38.</TE>
<TE>   Even then, the manufacturer would have to better promote the
product as a decorative accessory, not just a fragrance, Wilcox
mused. The spray needed a classier look--a gold spritzer perhaps,
with some sort of crest. The new packaging had to shout luxury. And
it had to make a bold statement on the bathroom shelf. Or else a
$4.95 Glade PlugIn would win every time.</TE>
<TE>   She would show the manufacturer her candid video. One look at
those raised eyebrows and he would have to agree his product needed
serious rethinking.</TE>
<TE>   Such experiments cost Fame's clients $15,000 for two days of
recording and $100,000 or more for longer tests.</TE>
<TE>   Since opening last November, Once Famous has focused on home
accessories, with a lush, boudoir-like atmosphere that Wilcox
describes as "romantic bohemian." To her surprise, the
merchandise--most of it there to entice shoppers, not as part of a
product test--has proved so popular that the store has turned a small
profit, quite apart from the lab work.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Wilcox is willing to strip the boutique to its crimson
walls, stashing the inventory in her ad agency until it's needed
again, to create a lab with a very different look.</TE>
<TE>   One client, Wilsons Leather, is considering taking the whole space
over for a few months to test its new leather accessories.</TE>
<TE>   "When you take your products to a focus group, they really know
they're on camera," explained Joel Waller, the company's chairman.
"This is a much more valid customer experience. They're not looking
to impress anyone by picking out the 'good' styles. You're seeing
their real reaction."</TE>
<TE>   Another client, General Mills, may turn the lab into a clothing
store to see whether it could sell specialty groceries in such an
unexpected environment. Would shoppers snag a soy drink from a cooler
as a break from trying on shoes? Might they pick up a holiday cake
mix or a festive box of cookies while browsing Christmas sweaters?</TE>
<TE>   "We're always looking for opportunities [to sell food] outside the
normal grocery store," said Mark Addicks, vice president of marketing
for General Mills. With Once Famous, he added, "we can try different
things within minutes."</TE>
<TE>   There's rarely a shortage of research subjects. Once Famous opens
to a food court that connects two office towers. Thousands of people
walk past each day at lunch. Many stop in, drawn by the funky
chandeliers and the handmade greeting cards, the Japanese bath salts
and the Oriental rugs.</TE>
<TE>   A subtle sign at the entrance warns shoppers when the lab is in
"test mode," and adds: "If you prefer not to be recorded, kindly
visit when this sign has been removed." Wilcox is developing a more
eye-catching sign, with a blinking light.</TE>
<TE>   For now, however, many breeze past without reading the
warning--and never know that their every move, their every wistful
stare and disdainful sniff, is being taped. Even those who do know
say they soon get so involved in browsing--the merchandise changes
almost daily--that they forget they're on camera.</TE>
<TE>   "They're really unaware," said Coco Sullivan, the store's
full-time sales associate.</TE>
<TE>   Such surveillance is perfectly legal. Experts in privacy law say
retailers are free to record, videotape or otherwise monitor their
shoppers, except in areas considered private, such as fitting rooms.
They are also free to do as they like with the data they
gather--including sell it.</TE>
<TE>   "There's broad recognition that we give up virtually all our
expectations of privacy when we go into a public area like a mall,"
said attorney Sheldon Krantz, who recently chaired a task force on
surveillance for the American Bar Assn. "There is virtually no
regulation of this area at all."</TE>
<TE>   That makes some privacy advocates edgy, but few shoppers at Once
Famous seem to mind.</TE>
<TE>   "Now that I know [someone's listening], maybe I should walk around
and make more comments," said Jamila Petite, a sales representative
who had drifted in on her lunch break without noticing the sign.</TE>
<TE>   Marketers, of course, have always cared about consumer opinion.
Until recently, however, gathering such information was laborious.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to convening focus groups and interviewing shoppers,
researchers would lurk in grocery aisles, stopwatches in hand, to
time how long customers looked at each product. They would trail
alongside shoppers as they browsed, quizzing them on their purchases.
Or they would pay select consumers to keep a diary of their shopping
experiences.</TE>
<TE>   One famed retail ethnographer, Paco Underhill, developed a
technique for secretly videotaping shoppers as he trailed them
through stores. Underhill's research firm, Envirosell, now employs
100 such "trackers" worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   The new surveillance equipment can track the behavior of many more
shoppers for much less work.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the basic hardware is familiar: hidden cameras and
sometimes microphones concealed in ceilings. The difference is in the
software that links all the cameras in a store so they can follow a
shopper's route instead of just videotaping whoever moves in front of
each lens.</TE>
<TE>   The individual shopper, identified by body mass or body
temperature, is "passed" from camera to camera so his movements can
be fluidly mapped. There are also programs that automatically direct
wall-mounted cameras to zoom in on a shopper's face if he lingers
more than a few seconds in one spot. And there is software that turns
hours upon hours of video into digital maps of shopper behavior.</TE>
<TE>   "We can tell if someone picks up a Coke, sees a sale sign, puts it
back and buys a Pepsi. We can tell how many people pass by a certain
cardboard display," said Stan Beck, a vice president of Brickstream
Corp., a leader in the emerging field. "This technology can provide
much greater insight into consumer behavior than our old way of doing
things."</TE>
<TE>   Brickstream, for instance, is working with a soft drink firm that
sells its sodas at 10 locations within a typical SuperTarget. The
company wants to find out which sites draw the most traffic so it can
focus its promotion efforts there.</TE>
<TE>   Another client, a brewery, wants to know whether it's worth it to
pay a premium for space in refrigerated cases. Inventory controls
don't answer this question: A six-pack scans as a six-pack whether
it's warm or cold. But hidden cameras can track whether shoppers head
for the chilled beer or buy it off the shelf.</TE>
<TE>   "Our clients can understand exactly what their clients are
doing--and why," Beck said.</TE>
<TE>   Such insight can be pricey. Monitoring an average-size convenience
store with Brickstream costs a minimum of $300 a month for a
long-term contract. (Unlike Once Famous, Brickstream does not provide
video footage of shoppers or transcribe their comments.)</TE>
<TE>   The cost is not the only hitch. Truth is, most retailers and
manufacturers are swamped with data. They track sales figures and
coupon use. They monitor inventory. They survey customers. Hidden
cameras can give them more information still. But then they have to
figure out how to use it.</TE>
<TE>   "The question is, how do you crunch all that data to achieve
results?" Underhill, the ethnographer, said. "Moving from data to
information to intelligence to wisdom is part of the challenge."</TE>
<TE>   That was evident one recent afternoon at Once Famous, as Wilcox
watched from the control room while a young woman browsed through a
collection of writing supplies.</TE>
<TE>   The woman picked up a spiral notebook in deep purple and gazed at
it intently. She put it down, stared into space, picked it back up.
She gave it a little caress. She put it down. She picked it up. She
rubbed her chin.</TE>
<TE>   Wilcox figured the woman was hung up on the $15 price.</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, the shopper had decided to buy a notebook the
moment she saw the display. She had been standing there wishing they
came in green.</TE>
<TE>   "They're watching me," Pauline Neumann said as she paid for the
purple notebook. "But they don't know what I'm thinking."</TE>

<HD>Laker Legend West Leaves to Take Over in Memphis</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jerry West stood beside an idling jet early Tuesday morning, about to
leave Los Angeles and the Lakers for a new town and a new team, and
for the kind of fight that for the moment does not exist here, where
championship banners fly.</LD>
<LD>   Only hours before, his decision to become President of the NBA's
Memphis Grizzlies brought his first uninterrupted sleep in weeks.
But, before he would board, a final chance to turn back rolled over
the LAX tarmac.</LD>
<LD>   The black Mercedes pulled close, the passenger side door opened,
and his friend, protege and successor as Laker general manager smiled
from behind the wheel and leaned across the console.</LD>
<TE>   "Get in," West was told.</TE>
<TE>   He grinned and refused.</TE>
<TE>   Soon they stood together in the morning chill, West, the man who
maintained a championship era in the 1980's and built another in the
1990's, alongside Mitch Kupchak, the man charged with maintaining a
West creation that has won the last two NBA titles and is favored to
win again this year.</TE>
<TE>   They spoke for a while, and they hugged, and they cried some. And
then the unimaginable happened. Jerry West, an icon of Los Angeles
sports, whose dashing image soothed Laker fans long before it became
the NBA logo, left.</TE>
<TE>   Forty two years after first joining the team, he was a Laker no
more. The man who personified Laker pride in an era of Boston Celtic
dominance, the man who choreographed Showtime and engineered the
deals that brought in team cornerstones Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe
Bryant in the glorious Summer of '96, was off to a new place, a new
challenge.</TE>
<TE>   "He wouldn't get in," Kupchak reported with a shrug. "He got on
the plane."</TE>
<TE>   By early afternoon, West, tanned and hale and ready to go to work
again, steadied himself before a microphone in Memphis, Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   "After this one year, it has been very challenging for me to find
enough things to do in my life," West said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to think I'm still capable of working hard and doing
something that will really whet my appetite. More importantly, there
are a lot of things that need to be done here."</TE>
<TE>   Months of negotiations had led him from semi-retirement to the
controls of a franchise that won only 23 games this season. At 63,
West's new career means reshaping an organization that in seven years
has failed to produce a winner. More, perhaps, it means leaving
behind four decades of basketball, of friendships, of a home in Bel
Air and a regular game in the card room at Bel Air Country Club.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll never break my tie with the Lakers," West said, who said he
will buy a home in Memphis but not sell in L.A. "It's probably the
most important thing of my professional life ... I talked with [Laker
owner] Dr. Jerry Buss at length one day, and I gave [former UCLA
Coach] John Wooden a call, two people I admire greatly. They were
really helpful, I think, in getting me to the point to consider maybe
I should be doing something else with my life. It was a difficult
decision.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a huge step in my life. But, when I looked at it, the
opportunity available here, and working with an owner who will be
very similar to Jerry Buss in terms of wanting the best, I thought it
was a great opportunity to help someone build a franchise.</TE>
<TE>   "For competitive people," he added, "that's what drives them. You
need reasons to get up every day and go to work."</TE>
<TE>   He arrived in Los Angeles in 1960, a shooting guard from West
Virginia chosen in the NBA draft by a franchise only recently
relocated from Minneapolis. He averaged 27 points in 13 seasons,
finally winning an NBA title in his 12th. Along the way, he became
known as "Mr. Clutch" for his late-game and playoff scoring.</TE>
<TE>   As a Hall-of-Fame player and then as a consultant and team
executive, West helped the Lakers win eight NBA titles. He retired as
a player in 1974, then coached the Lakers for three seasons, starting
in 1976. He was a special consultant to General Manager Bill Sharman
for the next three seasons, and then replaced Sharman.</TE>
<TE>   West ran the Lakers' basketball operations until August 2000. Four
summers before, West had signed O'Neal as a free agent, traded for
Bryant and drafted an unheralded guard named Derek Fisher. The Lakers
picked up Robert Horry in a trade the next season, and signed Rick
Fox as a free agent the following summer, completing the core of the
reigning champions.</TE>
<TE>   But finally, when the reward came, West, ravaged by the stress of
his position, could barely watch the team in the playoffs. During the
game that clinched the NBA title against the Indiana Pacers, West was
driving the freeways of Los Angeles, getting updates from the radio.
Unable to enjoy the club's first championship in 12 years, he retired
two months later.</TE>
<TE>   After a year almost completely removed from the game, West
gradually returned, primarily as a consultant to Kupchak. By the
second half of this season, he was a regular at home games again, and
acquaintances began to suggest he was preparing himself for a second
career.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a long talk not too long ago," Wooden said. "He was
restless and said he missed it. One of his big problems was that he
didn't want to seem disloyal to the Lakers."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, by all accounts West is in the mood for basketball
again."Three or four years ago, when the rebuilding was completed, he
began to lose a little bit of interest," Kupchak said. "Maybe that's
a part of the challenge of rebuilding. When Shaquille was done and
Kobe was brought on board, the coaching changes, Rick Fox being
signed to a long-term deal, I got a sense that this was what he had
been wanting to do for the last 10 years, to take a team that had
kind of bottomed out and rebuild."</TE>
<TE>   West said in his first year off he didn't realize how badly he
need the time away.</TE>
<TE>   "I think you work yourself into a position in this league where
it's not about what you do for the team, it's almost like your family
becomes second place," West said. "That's not very good. I think that
the enormous pressure and stress that's there in Los Angeles to win
games, and more importantly win championships, that's been created
... over 42 years."</TE>
<TE>   That's Kupchak's duty now, and Buss'. In the meantime, West
healed, and came to dote on Kupchak and the Lakers as part of his $1
million a year consulting job. When word spread that he would
consider manning another team, several owners called, including the
Grizzlies' Michael Heisley. When West determined the job was
attractive and the project was viable, he eagerly returned.</TE>
<TE>   He was reportedly given a stake in the Grizzlies' franchise along
with a multi-year contract that will reportedly pay him $5 million
annually, but his acceptance had little to do with the money.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody has their own rhythm and cadence in life," said Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar, the Laker center from 1975-89. "If he wants to do this,
he must be really motivated."</TE>
<TE>   Chick Hearn, the Laker broadcaster who called nearly every game
West played and for 25 years after West retired, spoke to West on
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "It got pretty emotional," he said. "We both cried. There are just
so many memories ... Jerry feels he's making the right move, and I
think he'll do well."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Mayor James Hahn, a fan of West's for four decades,
said he will always consider West a Laker, regardless of the uniform
he represents.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't believe he's leaving," Hahn said, "but I guess life moves
on."</TE>
<TE>   Four hours after West's chartered jet left Los Angeles, a
thunderstorm heaved over Memphis, and there was concern that West's
chartered plane would not be allowed to land. The storm broke long
enough, however, and the West party arrived in time.</TE>
<TE>   At a downtown hotel, Shane Battier, a swingman who will be one of
West's better players, waited on the steps, and stuck out his hand to
welcome the new man. West's 13-year-old son, Jonnie, happened to have
worn a Battier jersey to the affair.</TE>
<TE>   By then, the very difficult parts had passed. West was back in the
South, closer to his boyhood home in West Virginia, and he had an
organization that not only needed him, but he needed as well.</TE>
<TE>   An observer of the day's press conferences and numerous other
affairs said, "You would have thought the president was being
inaugurated."</TE>
<TE>   West said hello a thousand times and shook at least that many
hands, while a city watched and said good-bye.</TE>

<LD>Ventura police are searching for two men who conned a woman into
withdrawing $6,000 from her bank in exchange for half interest in a
bag of diamonds.</LD>
<LD>   The woman, 56, was approached about 2:20 p.m. Monday as she stood
near the corner of Main and Palm streets in downtown Ventura, said
Police Sgt. Sean Conroy.</LD>
<LD>   One of the men, who spoke to the woman in Spanish, said his son
had just been hit by a car and needed money for treatment, Conroy
said.</LD>
<TE>   She agreed to give him cash in exchange for a bag of "diamonds"
that he said fell from the car as it fled the scene. The suspect gave
her a bag of what she told police appeared to be diamonds.</TE>
<TE>   A second man approached and told the woman she could double her
money if she gave him the diamonds to sell to a jeweler.</TE>
<TE>   She withdrew the money from a nearby bank and gave it to the first
man, who then left, Conroy said. She then gave the bag to the second
man, who also left. Neither man returned.</TE>

<DH>Archeology: Pierce class does excavation at an Angeles
National Forest site believed to have been a home of the Tataviam
Indians.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>About every 15 minutes, a plume of dust rises into the vast Angeles
Forest sky as student archeologists work to unravel the mysteries
about the Indians who occupied the area hundreds of years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Dirt dumped by the bucketful onto a metal sieve exposes pebbles,
bits of charcoal and occasionally a tiny bead carved from a shell.
Patiently and carefully, the debris is examined piece by piece.</LD>
<LD>   "Everything we find is new information," Pierce College
anthropology student Joanne Gilby said. "You have to train your eye
to see what's different, what rocks have sharp edges, which ones have
colors that don't fit in. It looks like there's nothing here, but
there is. It's like a big puzzle and these are the clues."</LD>
<TE>   Gilby is one of 13 Pierce students who travel once a week from the
Woodland Hills campus to dig on federal property near Acton.</TE>
<TE>   In March, the U.S. Forest Service signed an 18-month agreement
with the Los Angeles Community College district giving the college
permission to excavate sites believed to have once been home to the
Indian tribe known as Tataviam, which roughly translates to "people
of the southern slopes."</TE>
<TE>   No burial sites have been found, but students have uncovered many
historical items, including a circle of rocks that outlined an Indian
house, several rock-lined pits, beads, a shark's tooth, burnt animal
bones and arrow-heads.</TE>
<TE>   "We're getting a lot of data we weren't even aware of. The
potential is tremendous," said Doug Milburn, an archeologist for the
693,667-acre Angeles National Forest.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement is mutually beneficial to the government and the
college. The financially strapped Forest Service gets free
archeological help and the students get a firsthand opportunity to
learn the art and science of excavation.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankly, community college students often don't get to do
fieldwork," said David S. Whitley, who was chief archeologist at the
UCLA Institute of Archeology in the early 1980s and is now a private
consultant. "Being able to do this is important. It's good for their
training."</TE>
<TE>   The excavation also may benefit members of the Tataviam tribe
hoping to learn more about their ancestors whose territory ranged
from the Santa Clara River valley area, near the communities of Piru
and Newhall, eastward.</TE>
<TE>   What little is known about this hunter-gatherer tribe -- which
numbered 500 to 1,000 when they encountered Spanish explorer Father
Francisco Garces in 1776 -- has been gleaned from larger tribes who
lived nearby and from records kept at the San Fernando Mission. Once
at the mission, Tataviam intermarried, commingling their distinct
heritage with that of other tribes, including the Chumash and
Kitanemuks.</TE>
<TE>   It will be largely through archeology that scientists learn about
the inhabitants of the region, said John Johnson, curator of
anthropology at Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, who is
helping a group of Indians of Tataviam ancestry make their case to
become a federally recognized tribe. "Because of a lack of direct
observation and information, there has to be a lot of piecing
together of the puzzle," Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   While welcoming the chance to learn more about the past, one
Tataviam tribal leader said he is ambivalent about the excavation,
even though the tribe is notified about significant finds.</TE>
<TE>   "I have mixed feelings. It's our ancestry, our culture, but there
are some areas that are not supposed to be touched," such as tools
used by medicine people or spiritual leaders, said Rudy Ortega Jr.,
director of the Fernandeno-Tataviam Tribe.</TE>
<TE>   "When they determined those tools had served their purpose, they
were blessed and buried in a certain way," Ortega said. But overall,
he said, he believes it's best to have the artifacts discovered.</TE>
<TE>   "You need to do archeology so people can put together pieces of
the past," he said. "Without it, you'll never know. It's good for the
tribe to have [the items] preserved and documented."</TE>
<TE>   A chance meeting in December 1999 led to the eventual agreement
between the Forest Service and the college district. While on a
private tour of a rock art site in the Santa Susana Mountains, Noble
Eisenlauer, assistant instructor of anthropology at Pierce, struck up
a conversation with a Forest Service official, telling him how the
college wanted to revive its archeological field class but needed a
place to dig.</TE>
<TE>   Eisenlauer said Michael Mcntyre, forest archeologist for the
Angeles National Forest, told him that the Forest Service needed
volunteers to document the many recorded historic and prehistoric
sites in the area. By January 2001 arrangements were completed and
the students began to dig under Eisenlauer's supervision.</TE>
<TE>   Affectionately known as "Dr. E," Eisenlauer shows students hot to
use trowels and brushes to search for history, 10 centimeters at a
time.</TE>
<TE>   "When the course starts, they are showing me everything they
find," Eisenlauer said. "By the end, they aren't showing me that
much. They are seeing things they didn't used to see."</TE>
<TE>   Even Eisenlauer occasionally spots artifacts previously
overlooked, like a man-made groove in a rock next to a trail he has
walked a hundred times.</TE>
<TE>   "Things are subtle. You have to walk around and become sensitized
to it; then it jumps out at you," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Based on the discovery of burnt juniper berries, which are not
available year-round, Eisenlauer said he believes the area could have
been a seasonal campground used in the spring and that a larger
village may be close by. While the site has been disturbed over the
years--Eisenlauer said they have found shotgun shells and candy
wrappers, among other debris--an analysis of what they have
excavated, including beads made of shell, glass and stone, indicates
they were from the Mission Period (1771 to 1821).</TE>
<TE>   If funding can be found, he said he hopes that organic material
discovered in the dig--plant roots, animal bones and pieces of
charcoal--can be radiocarbon-dated to figure out when people lived in
the area, known by some researchers as the "Bermuda Triangle of
California,: because of its lack of documentation.</TE>
<TE>   At a rate of about 1,000 working hours per year, Eisenlauer
believes he and the students will be in the area for a long time
searching for lost villages.</TE>
<TE>   "Working at this pace, we have decades of work out there," he
said. "Every few weeks we find something new."</TE>
