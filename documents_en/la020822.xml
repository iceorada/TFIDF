<LD>IN THE WALLED GARDENS</LD>
<LD>   A Novel</LD>
<LD>   By Anahita Firouz</LD>
<TE>   Little, Brown</TE>
<TE>   256 pages, $24.95</TE>
<TE>   A meditation on revolution, Anahita Firouz's debut novel, "In the
Walled Gardens," holds the reader steadily while retaining the
sadness of its period--the years just before the Iranian revolution
of the late 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   The author's admirable skills include an observant ear toward the
niceties of people, an eye for cultural details and an almost
photographic sense of place.</TE>
<TE>   She evokes the Iranian countryside with abundant and colorful
affection. Firouz's descriptions of urban locales and bucolic
retreats, everyday plants and exotic flowers, people's clothes and
personal idiosyncrasies--all come to life in a kaleidoscope of
memory. She has sensitively recorded her times and those days.</TE>
<TE>   Firouz is a native of Tehran who earned degrees at Boston
University before returning to Iran. She witnessed the years of
revolution, married during that period and went to Europe, then the
United States, in 1981. She says she wanted to show in this novel,
"the complexity of an entire society, trying to find its sense of
identity and balance, unaware that it was in fact on the verge of
destruction."</TE>
<TE>   At one point, the author describes the sense of loss in the old
society:</TE>
<TE>   "The gardener helped bring the bags into the main house. We went
out to survey the garden. He said, 'This place isn't what it used to
be! What orchards? The cherry trees are diseased, but the grapevines
are still solid. What stables? Only a donkey there.' We walked. The
pool was cracked and overridden with green moss. The flower beds
overgrown with weeds, no new flowers were planted anymore. Only the
rose vines bloomed regardless of who came and went."</TE>
<TE>   Told alternately through the two voices of her principals,
Mahastee, a woman of affluence and power married to a successful
businessman, and her childhood male friend, Reza, a civil servant and
committed leftist, the novel views the coming revolution through the
many contacts both have with a despotic government bureaucracy and
through the portrayals of several layers of a society torn by
competing and struggling factions. Mahastee and Reza love each other,
yet their destinies are in conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Without showiness or self-consciousness, Firouz tells the tale in
colorful detail. Her descriptions of several leftist factions and
their activities ring true, as does her close observation of family
functions and social gatherings. She does not miss the subtleties of
everyday conversation, and she describes perfectly the interactions
of long-standing friends and acquaintances.</TE>
<TE>   The protagonists become obsessed with attempting to rescue a
friend taken as a political prisoner. They both pursue truth while
living a day-to-day existence, whether working in an office,
maintaining family connections and rituals, tending a disintegrating
marriage or caring for children and aging parents.</TE>
<TE>   Mahastee's endless social obligations parallel her continuing and
conflicting efforts to help her political prisoner friend; Reza
finds, meanwhile, that his work on behalf of the friend brings
harrowing consequences.</TE>
<TE>   Firouz's writing style suits her story. Her admirable and smooth
prose is pointed, elegant, aphoristic and wise. This is an auspicious
debut.</TE>

<HD>New Class of Tools for School</HD>
<DH>Improved calculators, edgy lunch boxes and adaptable
binders ease the plight of students</DH>

<AU>JANET EASTMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What do students want besides easy A's and online classes they can
access from their bedroom? Depending on their age, it could be a
calculator that acts like a word processor, a lunch box that passes
as a fashion statement, a back-saving day pack or a blank binder
cover ready to be personalized.</LD>
<LD>   Here's some of what's new in back-to-school tools.</LD>
<LD>   Calculated Moves</LD>
<TE>   The first Texas Instruments electronic hand-held calculator is
older than some students' parents. Released in 1967, the original TI
has since advanced into the world of microprocessors with
electronically upgradeable operating systems and customized software
applications.</TE>
<TE>   Texas Instruments adds a new twist to technology this season with
a partner for its popular TI-83 Plus, TI-89, TI-92 Plus and Voyage
2000: a keyboard that transforms the calculators into word
processors, expanding their use from math, science and statistics
classes to every course short of physical ed.</TE>
<TE>   Students can type notes, copy, cut and paste text, then create
files and download them to a PC for storage, printing or e-mailing.
The system can also serve as a personal organizer, with software that
enables users to keep a calendar, store addresses and create to-do
lists. It has memory to hold 94 hand-held software applications,
including a language translator.</TE>
<TE>   The keyboard ($40) is powered by three AAA batteries and has
nonskid feet. It has a cradle to prop up the hand-held for easy
viewing and, at one-third the size of a traditional keyboard (with
full-size keys), it fits into a day pack.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the Dallas-based company introduced the TI-83 Plus
Silver Edition that dropped the dull exterior of its predecessors for
a glittery translucent plastic that encases multicolored buttons.
This year, there are screen covers in purple, red, green, blue,
yellow and gray ($5 each).</TE>
<TE>   For more information, call (800) 336-5236; educa tion.ti.com.</TE>
<TE>   What's for Lunch?</TE>
<TE>   Once it was only cool for the under-6 set to tote lunch boxes, but
thanks in part to edgier, less cartoony designs by leading
manufacturers, older students are also bringing food and beverages in
insulated kits to school and after-school programs.</TE>
<TE>   A leader in offering the more mature look is Outer Circle Products
Ltd., which makes the Arctic Zone brand of soft-sided lunch kits. The
Chicago-based company sells almost 70% of the $96-million lunch-box
market that uses original designs instead of licensed images like
Spider-Man or SpongeBob SquarePants, says Tiffany Moore of Outer
Circle.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the company's lunch kits have compression-molded plastic
exteriors and insulated nylon interiors with storage compartments.
New this year is the round, collapsible Twisted bag ($7) that twists
open in the middle.</TE>
<TE>   Nontraditional lunch-box shapes are also seen in the Messenger,
which mimics a satchel with its zippered front flap and adjustable
shoulder strap. It's made of washable woven polyester, dyed in
camouflage, lavender and a black-and-green combination ($10). The
H20, a vertical, polyester kit in navy, red and purple, has a
dishwasher-safe plastic sports bottle stored in an insulated exterior
pocket ($10).</TE>
<TE>   Arctic Zone lunch kits are at mass-merchandiser, drug and grocery
stores. For more information, call (312) 266-4000.</TE>
<TE>   Easing the Load</TE>
<TE>   Unlike recreational backpacks that are structured for hauling
camping equipment, lightweight day packs are designed to carry a
jacket, lunch and a few supplies. Students, by choice and necessity,
however, cram textbooks, binders and other school supplies into
daypacks.</TE>
<TE>   Experts warn that because children's spines are still growing,
heavy packs could cause back problems. To avoid injury,
packs--regardless of their ergonomic design--should not be more than
15% of the user's weight, 10% if under 12 years old. (Some schools
have banned the less-physically demanding rolling backpacks because
they block aisles, and students trip over them in hallways.)</TE>
<TE>   Makers of day packs have put a lot of effort into engineering
products that are safer for students. Split-yoke harnesses allow for
a better fit and balance, and supportive metal stays and waist belts
take pressure off shoulders and put it on hips, the body's center of
gravity.</TE>
<TE>   JanSport has a new, lighter-weight day pack called the Pulse that
makes it easier for students to plod through their school day. The
pack ($140) has pressure-reducing scapula and lumbar pads filled with
Gelastic gellycomb, a honeycombed rubber that was first used in
hospital mattresses. A suspension system distributes the pressure to
hips, and a mesh liner sends air along the shoulder straps to avoid
chaffing.</TE>
<TE>   For fun, a pocket on the top of the pack protects calculators, CDs
or MP3 players, and has an exit port for headphones or cords.</TE>
<TE>   For more information, call (800) 346-8239; www.jan sport.com.</TE>
<TE>   Binders Unbound</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't take long before that pristine binder is covered in
doodlings and notes. Russell + Hazel, a new mail-order company that
consults with a nationwide teen panel to determine the design of its
school supplies, has introduced a three-ring binder wrapped in
unfinished, warp-resistant Davey board that can be embellished with
markers, glitter, used concert tickets or anything else that appeals
to its owner.</TE>
<TE>   The spine is covered in tough book linen and comes in nine colors.</TE>
<TE>   An overstuffed binder can be secured with a giant rubber band,
which is included in the $19 price, or by add-ons such as straps,
bands or belts ($6) made of underwear elastic. A riveted rubber loop
keeps belts from straying.</TE>
<TE>   The inside cover has a dry-erase surface to jot notes and then
wipe off. Durable accordion files, reinforced divider tabs and
adhesive strips for unpunched pages help students organize their
work.</TE>
<TE>   The company is the brainchild of Minneapolis mom and architect
Christine Plantan, who was inspired by the school supplies her
grandparents made for her as a child. They used household items such
as rubber bands and garter belts to secure her ever-expanding binders
and notebooks.</TE>

<LD>Bearded irises need dividing every three years or so. The end of this
month is the traditional time in Southern California. Dig up the
rhizomes, separate, save the healthy ones, trim the leaves and roots
so they are about 6 inches long and replant. Space rhizomes about 4
to 6 inches apart.</LD>
<LD>   Naked lady (Amaryllis belladonna) gets its common name from its
habit of blooming in August with big pink trumpets, after the foliage
has withered. It is best planted or divided right after bloom.</LD>

<LD>Tapestries</LD>
<LD>   A tapestry is a large piece of fabric woven with pictures. It
often tells a story. Tapestries were very popular hundreds of years
ago with kings and noblemen who lived in castles and grand homes.
They were expensive to make, so usually only the very wealthy could
afford them.</LD>
<LD>   Tapestries hung on walls as paintings do, but they served other
purposes as well. They kept out cold, drafty air in castles. They
were also used to divide large rooms into smaller spaces, hung
outside windows for parades and special days and displayed in
churches. A king might roll up his favorite tapestries and take them
along on trips.</LD>
<TE>   Many skilled craftsmen were needed to create a tapestry. First, an
artist would draw ideas and images until a design was agreed upon.
Then the real work began. Wool from sheep and lambs was spun into
thread. Silk was ordered from Asia. Dyes were made, and then the wool
and silk were colored in huge vats.</TE>
<TE>   Tapestries are woven on a loom--a special machine for weaving yarn
into a textile. Men typically wove tapestries. Boys began learning
the art at 11 or 12 years of age. Tapestry-making was a respected and
well-paid profession. As many as six to 10 people might work on a
single tapestry. Each worker could only weave about one square yard
per year. That's about the size of a big pillow!</TE>
<TE>   There are five tapestries hanging in the Arabella Huntington
Memorial Gallery that were created around 1755 from the designs of
Francois Boucher. They show young ladies and gentlemen frolicking and
playing outdoors. Together they make a series called "Italian Village
Scenes."</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even though a swimming pool sounds pretty good at this time of the
year, Diana Leher clearly remembers the day when she decided that
hers had to go. She was sitting in the house, looking out at the
aging structure, when she thought, we are going to fill in that pool.
She called Pamela Berstler who, with designer husband Alex Stevens,
was in the middle of fashioning a new garden to go around the old
pool. "Ahhh ... O-O-OK," Berstler recalled, saying she was a little
stunned. "We can do that."</LD>
<LD>   The reason for the mid-course change was that Leher had become
pregnant after the design and landscaping work had begun. The sloping
frontyard had already been planted in the first phase of
construction. The narrow backyard, extremely so in some spots, was
next. Since the Westside house perches on a steep hillside, like a
rock climber on a thin granite ledge, there was very little level
ground.</LD>
<LD>   The only spot big enough for anything wider than a path, was
filled with a pool. There was no place to ride a bike, no place for a
play structure. In short, no place for kids. At this point in their
lives, a lawn made a lot more sense than a pool.</LD>
<TE>   But in the last few years, quite a few people have taken out
lawns, or pieces of them, to make room for flowers, vegetables or
fruit trees. Lawns use lots of water, and, in a dry state, there are
more responsible, drought-resistant choices. But there is one thing
lawns excel at--being a play surface for kids. In the landscape,
nothing is safer, softer, or tougher.</TE>
<TE>   "Where we had a nearly useless pool with no shallow end and no
fence, that was dangerous, needed lots of repairs and was expensive
to maintain," said Leher, "I now have a yard." Her 2-year-old son has
a lawn to romp on and her husband, Richard, has "a place to shoot
hoops."</TE>
<TE>   The Lehers were the first clients to ask Berstler and Stevens, who
run the design firm Flower to the People in West Los Angeles, to fill
in a pool. It's not all that complicated to do, though it isn't
cheap, said Berstler. It cost about $18,000 to fill in the Leher
pool, which was about 18 feet by 20 feet, and plant lawn on top,
probably more than it cost to put in the pool in 1976.</TE>
<TE>   A Place to Shoot Hoops</TE>
<TE>   Where the sun deck for the pool had been is now a partial
basketball court with a three-point line and a height-adjustable
Goalrilla backboard system. The court is paved with a special
easy-on-the-knees material called Mateflex. There's a bright-green
fescue lawn for son Marcus to run around on, at least until he's old
enough to join his dad on the court. Queen palms, giant birds of
paradise, gingers and other lush, tropical-appearing plants grow next
to the lawn, which is surrounded by colorful, whimsical paving so
Marcus can race round and round on his tricycle.</TE>
<TE>   Flower to the People has since filled in three more
pools--including one in Santa Monica--though they say they don't want
to make this a career specialty. The firm has recently done several
projects for HGTV's "Landscapers' Challenge," and their work has been
seen in several publications.</TE>
<TE>   Holes for Drainage</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles the cheapest way to convert a pool into a lawn or
garden is to fill it in, leaving the old shell in place, though in
certain circumstances the city may require homeowners to remove it.
If the shell stays, the city requires the pool walls to be partially
broken down. In the Lehers' case, they removed about a third of the
pool walls and the concrete was carted away. In addition, they
drilled many foot-wide holes in the bottom of the pool for drainage,
another city requirement.</TE>
<TE>   The next step was to fill most of the pool with mechanically
compacted gravel or other material, and finally a 3-foot layer of
topsoil for the lawn. "It's basically a huge, compacted gravel pit,"
said Berstler. Even with all this compacting the lawn still settled
after a winter's worth of rain.</TE>
<TE>   A filled-in pool may be landscaped but no building is allowed on
top of it. Berstler said that in Los Angeles, the Department of
Building and Safety first must grant a grading permit, then one must
record the location of the filled-in pool with the County Recorder's
office so future owners will know where it is.</TE>
<TE>   Fish Pond Made Safer</TE>
<TE>   There was one other smaller body of water on the Lehers' property,
an ugly little fish pond that was also quite easy to fall into.
Berstler and Stevens made this pool much smaller and raised the edge
to bench height, which provided a barrier and a place to sit while
watching the fish or looking at the water lilies. Just to make sure
small boys don't fall in, and to keep hungry raccoons out, a
removable decorative grill is resting on brackets just above the
water.</TE>
<TE>   When they first started work on this pond, the designers
discovered that what appeared to be a small two-tiered fountain was
actually four tiers high but obscured by jungle-like vegetation. The
designers and homeowners would have preferred to simply remove this
imposing structure, but it was integrally connected to the retaining
walls that hold back the hill, so they simply resurfaced it with
green and blue tiles.</TE>
<TE>   The fountain had been completely covered with brick like the
retaining walls and driveway in front, and the paving around the
swimming pool. Berstler and Stevens kept the brick in front but
otherwise took out as much of it as they could and used other
materials, including organic swirls of colored concrete and smooth
tiled surfaces.</TE>
<TE>   "Enough brick, already," as Diana Leher put it.</TE>

<HD>The Shag: A '70s Icon Spreads Out Again</HD>
<DH>Shudder not. This plush rug's newest incarnation is more
luxe--even hip.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CINDY CHANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The '70s are happening a second time around, in more ways than one.
From flared jeans and platform shoes to geometric prints and
oversized sunglasses, the exaggerated silhouettes of the decade have
become staples of 21st century closets. Psychically, it's something
of a flashback as well: We're adjusting our collective self-image in
the wake of Sept. 11 and a steady diet of moral malfeasance, much as
we did 30 years ago with the Vietnam War and Watergate.</LD>
<LD>   It should come as no great surprise, then, that even shag carpets,
those icons of '70s suburban bad taste, are back in style. The 21st
century shag is more likely to be beige or cream than avocado green.
It's likely to be an accent for a hardwood floor and modern
furnishings rather than a wall-to-wall monstrosity in a split-level.
But it's still got the unmistakably shaggy quality that, after all,
makes a shag a shag.</LD>
<LD>   Shags are popping up not only in hip design stores on Beverly
Boulevard but also in mainstream outlets such as Pottery Barn. They
are part of the same trend that brought back lava lamps, butterfly
chairs and bright primary colors on everything from bedspreads to
computer hardware.</LD>
<TE>   Is it just a coincidence that shags have cycled back at this
particular point in time? Or are people seeking out soft, fluffy rugs
to soothe psyches damaged by the events of the last year?</TE>
<TE>   "People are spending more time at home, less time out. It's the
nesting syndrome.... Obviously some of it is Sept. 11, but it was
going on even two years before that. Some of it has to do with the
economy and reprioritizing, all of the headlines, these things in the
news that are about the wrong values," says Monty Lawton of In House,
a design store on Beverly Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, a search for larger significance starts to seem a
little overblown when the topic is a rug, particularly a rug whose
defining quality is a certain disheveled hairiness.</TE>
<TE>   For many, the appeal of a shag comes down to one simple fact: it
feels good on their feet. "People are coming back to a fluffy, lush
feeling. People love to sit on it, love to walk on it," says Brad
Boucher, owner of Westwood Carpets on Beverly Boulevard, where shags
made of New Zealand wool run about $750 for a 5-by-8 rug and $1,500
for an 8-by-10.</TE>
<TE>   For those who can't afford the high-end product, Pottery Barn wool
shags are $399 for a 5-by-8 and $699 for an 8-by-10. At Urban
Outfitters, a 6-by-9 chenille shag retails for $140.</TE>
<TE>   Generation Xers who weren't around for the first Age of Shag don't
have bad shag memories to get in the way of appreciating the new
shag. "The generation born after the first trend is picking up on it.
They just think it's a really cool texture. It's a texture they
haven't seen before," says Bill Fleetwood, manager of Aga John
Broadloom in the Pacific Design Center. Half of Aga John's shag sales
are to the 20-to-30-year-old demographic.</TE>
<TE>   For older generations, the mere mention of the word "shag" can be
enough to elicit a shudder. But the new shags are so different from
the old that shag haters often find themselves transformed into shag
lovers.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles interior designer David Plante says his clients are
often taken aback when he suggests using shag. One client scoffed
that the rugs reminded him of furry toilet seat covers. "But once he
touched it, put his feet on it, he realized he really liked it,"
Plante says.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Plante is installing an egg-shaped off-white shag in front of
that client's bedroom fireplace, along with some richly colored
chenille pillows--a scene that would no doubt elicit an appreciative
"Shagadelic!" from Austin Powers.</TE>
<TE>   Sarah Chavez of Diva, a design store on Beverly Boulevard, put a
red shag with orange and green highlights on a cherrywood floor to
complement an avocado green settee and coffee table in a brand-new
7,000-square-foot Beverly Hills contemporary home. The color scheme
hearkens back to the '70s, but the pared-down lines of the
furnishings signal a contemporary aesthetic. In the living room, a
cream-colored shag lightens the stark lines of a cream leather sofa
and low-lying coffee table. "The rug warms up the whole ambience,
invites you to enjoy the space," says Alan Becker, commercial
director of the Mexico City firm Moises Becker Architects, which
built the house on spec.</TE>
<TE>   The shag resurgence began several years ago, along with the
general resurgence of '70s style in fashion and design. Shag's close
cousin, the flokati--a rug made of fur-like fibers, often cut in the
shape of an animal skin--has also sold well in recent years. Most of
the new shags are made of wool rather than the cheap nylon of years
past and come in varieties unheard of 30 years ago--fibers as thick
as pinkie fingers and so long they flop over like rabbits' ears;
fibers of different colors and thicknesses mixed in together; fibers
that are wound around an inner core so that they resemble sea anemone
tentacles.</TE>
<TE>   There's no need for the oft-derided shag rake, used in the old
days to spruce up a tired-looking shag, since wool fibers don't get
matted like synthetic ones do. But shag owners will probably need to
invest in an extra-strength vacuum cleaner that won't get tripped up
by long fibers.</TE>
<TE>   The shag revival is not limited to the hippest of the hip. Shags
appeal to the family-oriented because, as those who grew up romping
on the family room shag can attest, children love shag. "Before, it
was more the edgier people. Now it's really family-friendly. We get
young couples with 5-or 6-year-olds. They like the idea of having
them for the kids. The kids love playing on them," says Chavez of
Diva. But those with pets, especially cats, might want to think twice
about investing in a shag. A cat confronted with the luxuriant
expanse of a high-quality wool shag will probably rejoice that its
giant yarn ball fantasies have come true. And pet hairs shed onto a
shag will probably prove impossible for even that shiny new
mega-horsepower vacuum cleaner to suck up.</TE>
<TE>   At ABC Carpet &amp; Home in New York, shags and flokatis are selling
briskly, says sales designer Richard Picher. Though neutrals are
popular in Los Angeles, he says, New Yorkers are attracted to bright
primary colors reminiscent of the '70s palette. "On the West Coast,
architecture integrates with the outdoors. In New York, people don't
want anything to do with the outdoors, so they create obvious color
schemes for their interiors," Picher says.</TE>
<TE>   The new shags--which designers say inject a room with a warm, soft
vibe--are often used as a contrasting element against other objects
in a room, whether it's the clean lines of modern furniture or the
somber wood of antique furnishings.</TE>
<TE>   Maya Thesman, an interior designer who just moved into a 1923
Spanish-style house in Glendale, used wall-to-wall off-white shag in
her master bedroom and walk-in closet to contrast with the dark wood
of an antique bed and dresser. "It's a wonderful juxtaposition. I
wanted carpet but something retro, cool," Thesman says.</TE>
<TE>   The only problem Thesman has with her new shag is that she hasn't
yet figured out how to vacuum it. The $300 Hoover she bought recently
doesn't work on the shag, and she's still trying to find a vacuum
cleaner that will do the job. Among those recommended by some rug
sellers is an Electrolux--the company's vacuums sell for $1,000 and
more, which might just out-price the rug.</TE>
<TE>   Like it or not, shag is back. It still has the homey, comforting
quality of the original but in an incarnation at once more luxurious
and more understated. Austin Powers would feel right at home in the
21st century--in fact, he might just kick off his shoes and burrow
in.</TE>

<LD>"Do you children know that we can cook with the sun?" Uncle Ruben
asked Maria and Alfonso.</LD>
<LD>   "Huh," said Maria. Maria and her younger brother were spending the
week at a camp in the San Bernardino Mountains where their Uncle
Ruben was a nature guide.</LD>
<LD>   "Can we do that?" asked Alfonso.</LD>
<TE>   Uncle Ruben directed the children to collect everything they
needed--two boxes (one that fits into another), a lid for the larger
box, duct tape, aluminum foil, four empty cat food cans and some old
newspaper. He added some scissors and a pane of glass.</TE>
<TE>   Once they had everything, Uncle Ruben first placed the four
cat-food cans in the bottom of the first box. He had the children
crumple newspapers and put them in the box. Uncle Ruben then lined
the smaller box with aluminum foil and placed that box into the
larger box.</TE>
<TE>   "The newspapers are for insulation," explained Uncle Ruben, "and
the cans are to keep some space between the two boxes."</TE>
<TE>   The children packed the rest of the newspaper between the two
boxes, and Uncle Ruben taped up the top space between the two boxes.
He then cut a hole in the lid of the larger box with the scissors.
The piece of glass was securely taped in place over the hole of the
lid. "Be sure to have an adult do the scissors and glass part until
you get older," said Uncle Ruben. He carefully placed the lid on, and
yelled, "Hurrah, it's done!"</TE>
<TE>   "Hurrah!" chimed in Maria.</TE>
<TE>   "OK, let's test it," said Alfonso.</TE>
<TE>   They put some of last night's pizza into the inner box, closed the
lid, and placed the box on the picnic table where the sun could shine
on it. After 40 minutes, their pizza was hot!</TE>
<TE>   "This is great," said Alfonso.</TE>
<TE>   "And it was heated with the sun," said Uncle Ruben, grabbing a
piece of pizza.</TE>
<TE>   "Very cool," said Maria, who thought about what she'd just said,
and everyone laughed.</TE>

<LD>Fool fans eight times, shame on baseball; fool fans nine times, shame
on fans. Eight times baseball has threatened to leave, and eight
times it has. Now, with a ninth issue at the plate (this one named
"Luxury Tax") and players threatening to walk Aug. 30, it seems
almost certain baseball will still be batting a thousand.</LD>
<LD>   In the last three decades, baseball has given fans thrilling
pennant races, exciting home-run chases and severe abandonment
issues.</LD>
<LD>   The fans are taking their usual firm stand as separation anxiety
takes off like a Barry Bonds homer. They are writing angry e-mails
and letters. They are threatening to boycott televised and even live
games. But what red-faced fans are really doing about the young
millionaires and aging billionaires is dusting off their best doormat
outfit and preparing to splay themselves in front of the nation's
ballparks.</LD>
<TE>   Since some people apparently need to be hit over the head with a
bat, let's put it another way: Fans are in an abusive relationship
with the national pastime.</TE>
<TE>   "The fans give the game their hearts, their loyalty and their
love, and what do they get in return but the realization that
everyone is in it for themselves," said Stanley Teitelbaum, a New
York City psychotherapist who specializes in intimacy issues.
"They're basically being abandoned."</TE>
<TE>   Judging from the way most fans are behaving, though, you'd think
this was their first time getting their heart stepped on by big feet
in big cleats. Usually, victims of abandonment develop protective
mechanisms--not always healthy--to shield themselves from the hurt
and pain, according to psychotherapists.</TE>
<TE>   One response can be to distract yourself from the pain. Like say,
with food and drink. The grief over a striking team can be
temporarily relieved by jamming a pack of Dodger Dogs down your
throat and chasing it with a few cold ones. Actually, that's what
happy fans do all the time, so that's a bad example.</TE>
<TE>   Another common method of self-protection is to identify with the
abusers, in this case, baseball's drama queens who could only be
matched by Cher playing Vegas with RuPaul.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of focusing on filling out unemployment forms or dwindling
life's savings caused not just by a crash in the market but also by
rising ticket prices at the ballparks, the abused defends the
abuser's right to continue the abuse. For example: Players and owners
have the right to all the money in the world for "working" half the
year (playing a game) or administering their favorite game while fans
endure lives of not very quiet desperation.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, most baseball fans are in denial. The owners know it,
and the players know it.</TE>
<TE>   "Usually the abuser apologizes and begs forgiveness, and that in
part keeps the abused hanging on," said Stuart Fischoff, a professor
of media psychology at Cal State Los Angeles. "But baseball isn't
even offering that."</TE>
<TE>   If you ask baseball, there's nothing to apologize for. That's why
when reporters ask Barry Bonds whether fans would return to the
stands after another strike, the future Hall of Famer answers,
paraphrasing the Terminator: "They'll be back."</TE>
<TE>   World Wrestling Entertainment has more respect for its fans than
baseball. Wrestlers don't go on strike. They wear funny costumes,
scream at each other and wrestle--and, by gum, we love them for it.</TE>
<TE>   If baseball were really smart and wanted to boost profits, it
would cancel so-called Fan Appreciation Day, when it gives out
souvenir bats or Frisbees. Instead, it would charge double on Fan
Abuse Day, when the first 500 fans get a spanking (maybe from the San
Diego Chicken!) and the next 2,000 fans get bad seats with direct sun
in their eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Why do fans put up with the abuse? A lot of reasons, say
psychologists (that's what psychologists always say) but tradition is
among them. It keeps fans in the batter's box even when baseball is
throwing them curveballs, even when it is charging them more than
ever for the opportunity to be duped.</TE>
<TE>   There's something more powerful than history and economics at work
here, Teitelbaum says. It's that fans crave someone to admire.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, the fans are angry and resentful now," he said. "But they
will be back even if there's a strike. They will always come back
because the fans have to have heroes."</TE>
<TE>   This could be true, though it fails to explain attendance at
Chicago Cubs games.</TE>
<TE>   But don't worry, there's still something fans can do to heal
themselves and help the game they claim to love. And like all
doormats, fans know what is the right thing to do but have been
afraid to do it. Or afraid they can't do it, or that they will be the
only ones doing it, so it won't matter. But it does matter.</TE>
<TE>   Here's today's fan-empowerment tip, taken directly from baseball's
playbook: Abandon the game while you still can. It's the only way to
stop the abuse.</TE>
<TE>   "In an empowered state, you walk away as opposed to crying and
wailing about the problem and begging them to please play nice,"
Fischoff said. "The fans have seen who these guys are, and it would
be a sign of mental health to say, 'See you later.' That's a powerful
statement."</TE>

<LD>8:30pm Dance</LD>
<LD>   Summer reruns gain a new edge with a return engagement at Highways
by provocative, parodistic Jack Kirven and Michael Mizerany on a
split bill. Kirven sexualizes the tale of the nonaggressive Ferdinand
in "Bull," and Mizerany offers equally daring depictions of male
sexuality in "Bump in the Road," an offbeat look at
self-gratification, and "The Box," a user's guide to the
paraphernalia of passion. Will testosterone seem as passe as laudanum
or smelling salts when they've finished? Will every alpha male be on
the ropes? Maybe so: Kirven and Mizerany delight in skewering
societal assumptions about masculinity, whether it's Kirven as a
snorting, stripping Minotaur or Mizerany satirizing erotic excess
with what a Times reviewer called "a fluidity and core of
authenticity that quickens the senses."</LD>
<LD>   Jack Kirven and Michael Mizerany, Highways Performance Space, 1651
18th St., Santa Monica. 8:30 p.m. $15 ($13 for students with valid
school ID). Also Saturday, 8:30 p.m. (310) 315-1459.</LD>
<TE>   8pm Pop Music</TE>
<TE>   Never heard of Keigo Oyamada? Maybe you know him better as
Cornelius. No? Well, it's true that the Japanese musician operates
well out of the pop mainstream, but word is spreading. Cornelius
recently released "Point," a more atmospheric follow-up to his U.S.
debut album "Fantasma," and on his current North American tour he's
coupling music and video, giving a taste of the multimedia mind-set
that has endeared him to the scouts on pop's cutting edge.</TE>
<TE>   Cornelius, with South, El Rey Theatre, 5515 Wilshire Blvd., L.A.,
8 p.m. $16.50. (323) 936-4790.</TE>
<TE>   all day Movies</TE>
<TE>   After villainous turns in "Death to Smoochy" and "Insomnia," Robin
Williams takes on another atypical role in "One Hour Photo," a
thriller written and directed by Mark Romanek, perhaps best known for
his music video work with such artists as Madonna and R.E.M. Williams
plays a photo developer who deludes himself that's he's part of the
family of one of his customers and becomes obsessed with their
well-being. Connie Nielsen, Michael Vartan, Gary Cole and Eriq
LaSalle co-star.</TE>
<TE>   "One Hour Photo," rated R for sexual content and language, opens
Friday in general release.</TE>
<TE>   8pm Theater</TE>
<TE>   "Fedunn," a new drama by Padua Playwrights Workshop/Festival
founder Murray Mednick, is set in 1948 at a Catskill resort run by a
Jewish family that has thrived but been profoundly changed by World
War II. The play is also a valentine to the Catskills, the
destination of choice for decades for vacationing New York Jewish
families and singles. Mednick, who grew up there, worked at the
resort as a hotel busboy and waiter.</TE>
<TE>   "Fedunn," Odyssey Theatre, 2055 S. Sepulveda Blvd., West L.A., 8
p.m. Regular schedule: Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 3 p.m.
Ends Oct. 13. $25. (310) 477-2055.</TE>
<TE>   8pm Music</TE>
<TE>   Steve Moshier's Liquid Skin Ensemble, which describes itself as a
seven-member postmodern acoustic-electric chamber ensemble and often
appears in collaboration with dance troupes, plays by itself in
concert in Chinatown for two nights. The program will feature an
excerpted concert performance of "Shadows of the Spirit."</TE>
<TE>   Steve Moshier's Liquid Skin Ensemble, Acuna Hansen Gallery, 427
Bernard St., Chinatown, 8 p.m. Also Saturday at 8 p.m. Admission is
free, but reservations are recommended because of extremely limited
seating. (323) 441-1624.</TE>
<TE>   all day Movies</TE>
<TE>   We've all heard about how "plastic" Hollywood is, or witnessed
"wooden" performances, but "Simone" is the world's first literally
synthetic actress. Created by a director (Al Pacino) desperate to
revive his flagging career, the digital performer becomes a media
sensation that threatens to bury the frustrated filmmaker in lies and
deception. Andrew Niccol--who penned "The Truman Show" and directed
"Gattaca"--wrote and directed this satire of fame and fakery in
Tinseltown. Catherine Keener co-stars.</TE>
<TE>   "Simone," rated PG-13 for some sensuality, opens Friday in general
release.</TE>
<TE>   8:30pm Music</TE>
<TE>   British pianist Peter Donohoe, who last played at the Hollywood
Bowl four years ago, returns for the annual (since 1969) Tchaikovsky
Spectacular, with fireworks, this weekend. Donohoe will play the
B-flat-minor Piano Concerto. John Mauceri conducts the Hollywood Bowl
Orchestra; the program also includes "Romeo and Juliet," music from
"Swan Lake" and, with the fireworks display, the "1812" Overture.</TE>
<TE>   Tchaikovsky Spectacular, Hollywood Bowl, 2301 N. Highland Ave.,
Hollywood, 8:30 p.m. $3 to $90. Also Saturday, 8:30 p.m. (323)

<LD>noon Block Party</LD>
<LD>   The Sunset Junction Street Fair, which annually turns a stretch of
Sunset Boulevard in Silver Lake into an eclectic block party, marks a
quantum leap in musical ambition in its 22nd year. Building on its
established foundation of L.A.-based talent, the two-day event also
features such nationally prominent rock acts as Sonic Youth and
Mudhoney (Saturday) and Sleater-Kinney and Pansy Division (Sunday).
Beyond the rock, there's the usual array of soul, ethnic and
electronic music.</LD>
<LD>   Sunset Junction Street Fair, 3600-4200 Sunset Blvd., L.A.,
Saturday and Sunday, noon. $6. 661-7771.</LD>
<TE>   3&amp;8pm Theater</TE>
<TE>   Crime is on the rise in a small urban neighborhood, and the United
"Free of Sin" Fellowship Church congregation is fed up and ready to
move in "Let the Church Roll On," a musical comedy about love,
loyalty--and patience--by Donald Welch, starring stage and TV
veterans Marla Gibbs and Dawnn Lewis, with Ernest Harden Jr. as the

<TE>   7:30pm Pop Music</TE>
<TE>   In their first tour since their 1999 reunion, Bruce Springsteen &amp;
the E Street Band put the emphasis on the present rather than the
past, focusing on the music of the new album "The Rising" and its
reflections on determination and sorrow in the wake of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Springsteen &amp; the E Street Band, the Forum, 3900 W.
Manchester Blvd., Inglewood, 7:30 p.m. $75. (310) 419-3100.</TE>
<TE>   8pm Dance</TE>
<TE>   Is performer-choreographer-producer Deborah Brockus the single
most important person in Southland dance? Certainly nobody else is
presenting more locally based artists more times during the year:
student dancers in one of her series, multimedia specialists in
another and just about anyone and everyone in "Spectrum," now in its
12th edition and still an amazing grab bag of short pieces. Besides
Brockus, the new version is notable for including choreographer Jamie
Nichols, who danced off with three Lester Horton Awards recently.
Other participating dance makers include Gustavo Gonzalez, Lisa Lock,
Ken Morris, Anna Djanbazian, Denise Leitner, Cati Jean, Sarita, Loren
Denker-Slutsky and Brian Frette, Kevin Farnsworth, Elizabeth Hoefner,
Mark "Swany" Swanhart, John Castagna, Eric Henderson, Shelly Puente,
Dani Lunn and Erin Hirsh.</TE>

<TE>   8pm World Music</TE>
<TE>   Benin-born, Paris-based singer Angelique Kidjo--perhaps Africa's
most popular female recording artist and one of world music's
brightest stars--will appear in concert at the Cerritos Center for
the Performing Arts. Kidjo, who is fluent in French, English and
Yoruba, will collaborate with her husband, bassist-producer Jean
Hebral, to meld her vocals to African pop, Caribbean and Congolese
rumbas and cumbias, jazz, zouk and funk rhythms. Be prepared to move
to the beat--to tap your feet, clap your hands and celebrate this
irresistible music.</TE>
<TE>   Angelique Kidjo, Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts, 12700
Center Court Drive, Cerritos, 8 p.m. $30 to $40. (800) 300-4345,

<HD>It Runs East- West</HD>
<DH>Sawtelle may be a north-south street on the map, but for
many homesick young Asians, it goes straight to the heart</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SORINA DIACONESCU</AU>
<BD>Sorina Diaconescu is a Times staff writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The pack of young women stationed outside FuRaiBo, a Japanese-style
pub or izaka-ya on West Los Angeles' Sawtelle Boulevard, is a subtle
but sure sign that there's more going on in this short block of
Japanese mini-malls than just an exotic lunch at Sawtelle Kitchen or
Hurry Curry.</LD>
<LD>   Surrounded by unremarkable office buildings, nurseries and neon
storefronts, the young scenesters casually dressed in jeans and
belted knit sweater-jackets shudder in the Friday evening chill and
steel themselves for what they've been told will be a one-hour wait
to get in the new pan-Asian youth hotspot.</LD>
<LD>   Inside, the crowd is a blend of Japanese hipsters, college
students of many Asian ethnicities and even the odd couple with a
baby mobbing the tables under the dramatic glow of Japanese lamps.
The latest J-pop hits (the sugary-sweet Japanese equivalent of Top 40
songs) thump from the speakers, underlying the clatter of dishes and
rowdy laughter as pitchers of beer pass overhead.</LD>
<TE>   An orderly array of shoes lined up outside a private room with
walls of tatami, rice straw matting, where customers sit on fabric
floor cushions around four tiny tables, is a reminder that this is,
after all, a Japanese club. But the youthful presence, along with the
area's scattering of authentic Japanese pop culture shops, makes it
clear that this isn't anything like downtown L.A.'s Little Tokyo or
Gardena's Japanese neighborhoods. Sawtelle Boulevard, from Olympic to
Santa Monica boulevards, is for the young.</TE>
<TE>   Think of it as a dollhouse version of Japan Town, U.S.A., where a
cluster of restaurants and stores nudge one another along a street
that looks sedate during the day but where boba tea houses and
karaoke studios with private rooms buzz well into the wee hours. It's
also a hub for alternative pop media, with shops trading in used
manga--novel-length Japanese comics--and the locally famous Video
Addict rental store, which specializes in Asian films.</TE>
<TE>   Little Tokyo, the oldest and largest of Japanese communities in
Los Angeles, is museum-like by comparison, swathed in multiple layers
of Japanese American history. To young, homesick natives of Japan,
it's just not happening. Clusters of Japanese businesses are also
found in Gardena and Torrance, where eateries have sprung up to feed
hungry salarymen from nearby Japanese corporations.</TE>
<TE>   Sawtelle, however, thrives on Japanese food and pop culture, a
lure for explorers from East and West.</TE>
<TE>   FuRaiBo customer Mansan Luc has just finished a dish of asparagus
and eggplant with miso. A vegetarian, she likes the place, she says,
"for its really good vegetarian selection." Her tablemates--and
almost everyone else in the joint, it turned out--are there for
tebasaki: chicken wings fried in peanut oil. But delectations are
only one part of the area's allure.</TE>
<TE>   As dusk crawls along the short but historic strip referred to
simply as Sawtelle, Carmina Ocampo, 20, and Bill Poon, 41, man the
front counter at Giant Robot, a retail store created by Japanese
American Eric Nakamura, owner and editor of a magazine with the same
name. Giant Robot magazine, which is available internationally at art
and music stores, celebrates Japanese pop culture from a distinctly
American perspective, tracking such trends as surf culture and
hip-hop music as they move into Japan and take on bizarre, often
hilarious, forms. Ocampo and Poon, who identify themselves as minions
of the Giant Robot, greet a stream of customers strolling in, bellies
full of dinner from one of the many nearby restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   "The after-meal crowd," Poon notes.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time I come here, I want to buy everything in the store,"
says Elaine Chin, 28, pawing longingly at framed art prints ranging
from computer anime stills to new Japanese graphic design. It's
indeed tough to decide on any one thing: that "Lost and Found Pet
Posters From Around the World" tome? Pocket-sized zines cobbled
together by local artists? Stuffed pillows shaped like scooters and
turntables? Sock monkeys?</TE>
<TE>   Poon walks a visitor around the store, patiently describing curios
from the culturally significant to the just plain weird, from DVDs of
films by Hong Kong director Wong Kar-wai and books of Japanese
graffiti to a collection identified in English as "Ugly Dolls."
Japanese dolls, in general, go beyond the cute or action varieties. A
kogepan doll, a popular toy in Japan, seems particularly mysterious.
"It's a piece of burnt toast with strawberries on its head," he
explains. "There is a story about how it got those strawberries
there," he adds enigmatically, but he won't elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   With his nerdy glasses and funky tie, Poon looks like a young
Elvis--Costello, that is--and seems an appropriate emcee for a street
that hides some quirky surprises.</TE>
<TE>   Close to UCLA and Santa Monica College, both institutions
assiduously frequented by Japanese students, Sawtelle provides a sort
of urban comfort zone.</TE>
<TE>   "Most young Japanese people coming to Los Angeles grew up in a
city and can't identify with the feel of Little Tokyo," says Izumi
Hasegawa, 35, a journalist who lives near Sawtelle Boulevard and
writes for the U.S.-based Japanese publication U.S. FrontLine News.
"The South Bay is closer to what they experienced at home, but not
very hip."</TE>
<TE>   On the street, the telltale signs of a spicy youth culture are
few: a faux torii gate here, a glowing neon sign with Japanese
characters there. The area may be the stomping ground of the young,
but it is hardly rowdy or rebellious. Exotic in appearance maybe, but
also subdued and well-behaved.</TE>
<TE>   Young women like Izumi Hasegawa are about par for the area. Her
business card identifies her as a reporter, DJ, MC, photographer,
cinema navigator and Shinto priestess. You'll see them shopping for
toasted nori and Kewpie mayonnaise--a made-in-Japan brand to die for,
Japanese natives swear--at the local supermarket. This season, the
shoppers are mostly shibuya-gyaru: young women in a pricey uniform of
Frankie B. jean skirts, architectural heels and Christian Dior
aviator lenses. Still roaming in small packs are last season's
ganguro--literally "black faces"--ultra-tanned style mavens with
bleached tresses, pale lips and white raccoon circles penciled around
their eyes, and the ko-gyaru, precocious juveniles known to dart
about in towering platform boots and hankie-sized minis.</TE>
<TE>   You will most certainly note the street's young pan-Asian
demographic, which includes people of Korean and Chinese descent.</TE>
<TE>   Giant Robot's Poon sums up the cachet of the neighborhood:
"Mostly, it's food and boba." With four boba shops within two blocks,
it seems that the drink--blue marbles of tapioca served soaked in
sugary tea or strawberry-flavored milk--is among Sawtelle Boulevard's
chief attractions. Every other person hanging about seems to carry a
clear cup filled with "black pearls," with a cannon-size straw
jutting out of it.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone looking for more traditional food or bars might try
somewhere else. "If you're not into Asian things," says Poon with
typical understatement, "this is just a regular street."</TE>
<TE>   The Sawtelle Boulevard of Asian fusion cafes and eclectic stores
has been grafted onto an area with a Japanese American tradition that
goes back to the early 1900s.</TE>
<TE>   Plant nurseries owned by issei and nisei--Japanese immigrants to
the U.S. and their offspring--used to line the street. Most of them
are gone, replaced by office buildings sheathed in red brick or drab
granite.</TE>
<TE>   Kikuyo Yamaguchi, 81, and her late husband weathered the
internment camps during World War II and came to Sawtelle
Boulevard--then known as a nursery row--to make a fresh start in the
late 1940s. They leased a plot of land at the corner of Sawtelle and
Olympic boulevards and opened Yamaguchi Bonsai Nursery, which in 1964
moved a few blocks north to its current location.</TE>
<TE>   Daughter Marianne Yamaguchi, 48, grew up in the area and has seen
the street's nurseries dry up: "Everybody gets older, and the kids
don't want to carry on," she says, standing in front of pots filled
with miniature pines, geraniums and tea roses at the back of the
store, still owned and operated by her family.</TE>
<TE>   Few other establishments from the old days survive--two tiny
markets, a handful of mom-and-pop gift emporiums. Don Sakai's Satsuma
Imports, where you can buy everything from Japanese sake sets to geta
wooden sandals, has been at its current location since 1946. The Safe
and Save market, where locals get tuna and salmon cuts for sushi
parties, still occupies its decades-old spot. But for the most part,
mini-malls and trendy restaurants have elbowed out the shops of
yesteryear.</TE>
<TE>   As early as the mid-'80s, the Sawtelle corridor began shedding its
low-key appeal to accommodate a rash of development projects. "There
was a big push 12 to 15 years ago to knock everything down and
develop the area," Marianne Yamaguchi recalls. Real estate developers
"flashed tremendous amounts of money to issei owners," she says,
trying to buy their land. Some resisted, but a cluster of
mini-malls--Sawtelle Centre, Sawtelle Place and Olympic
Collection--mushroomed at the south end of the Sawtelle corridor,
across the street from one another.</TE>
<TE>   Poon worked at a video store on Sawtelle a decade ago. He was
surprised at how quickly the area morphed. "I came back a few years
ago and thought, 'Whoa, there's a lot of stuff that wasn't there
before,' " he says. And this patch of West L.A., once dormant in the
shadow of the 405 Freeway, has grown the livelier for it.</TE>
<TE>   Restaurateur Kenji Minamida opened Sawtelle Kitchen in 1990. Back
then, he says, "there were no parking meters on the street." Now they
line the main drag, and good luck finding a free one on weekend
nights.</TE>
<TE>   "This year the city planted a bunch of cherry trees up and down
the street, trying to give it some identity," Yamaguchi says.
Unnecessary: The Sawtelle corridor is already wearing its new
personality on its sleeve.</TE>
<TE>   "Sawtelle used to be a very boring street. You just passed by; you
didn't stop," says Minamida, who landed there by chance when he took
over a failing restaurant run by a friend. He had no intention, he
says, of launching his first venture there: "I personally wanted to
open my restaurant in a funkier area, like Venice, or Melrose."</TE>
<TE>   These days Sawtelle has its own kind of funky vibe--mellower than
Venice's, not as aggressively hip as Melrose Avenue's. It is a place
of small interior charms, easy to miss at a first glance. Exploring
Sawtelle is like hanging out with a new friend who is a little
reserved at first but eventually turns out to be lots of fun.</TE>
<TE>   There is a word in the Osaka dialect, kuidaore, that means "eat
till you drop." And Sawtelle is full of establishments at which to
perfect this rather fine art. The area appears to exist primarily to
satisfy the cravings of young Japanese living in Los Angeles who miss
the dishes they grew up with: deep-fried breaded pork cutlets, curry
rice a la Japonaise, Jell-O coffee desserts. These are staples of an
amalgam cuisine called yooshoku in Japan: basically, Japanese dishes
that substitute Western ingredients for traditional ones and borrow
liberally from continental recipes.</TE>
<TE>   Under its exotic flourishes, yooshoku is recognizably comfort
food, which may help explain its multiethnic appeal. There are
spaghetti dishes, meatballs, endless upscale variations on fast-food
favorites. The meatloaf with the demi-glace sauce served at Sawtelle
Kitchen is a tricked-up hamburger without the bun and with tastier
fixings. The wedges of deep-fried yam served with plum mayonnaise dip
are an exotic take on French fries.</TE>
<TE>   Even someone who never dared a sushi counter can dig this kind of
cuisine. "I call it Japanese American," says Minamida, who sports
white chef regalia and a bowl haircut as he steps out of the smoky
kitchen to talk about his restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   Sawtelle Kitchen was one of the first establishments to herald the
changes in the area and remains a nexus of sorts. It is always
packed, mostly by non-Asian Angelenos eager to experience the thrill
of something different--but not that different.</TE>
<TE>   Minamida, who cooked at Chinois and Rebecca's before opening
Sawtelle Kitchen, says he designed his menu with American tastes in
mind. "I know the Japanese already like this kind of food," he says.</TE>
<TE>   His customers are 70% American and 30% Japanese, he says. Most
customers are regulars, and they show up en masse on Friday and
Saturday nights, when the line spills to two little wooden benches
outside the entrance.</TE>
<TE>   Even the decor, reminiscent of a Provencal bistro--antique cabi-
nets filled with china, porcelain bibelots, tiny tables with precious
little elbow room--seems intended to appeal to cross-over crowds. The
walls used to be all white; now they are smoky and look as if they
have been that way since Prohibition. Customers sip Coke out of
vintage-style glass bottles on an outdoor patio fenced by pink
bougainvillea bushes.</TE>
<TE>   If you try to make your way to the bathroom (outside, in the back
of the building), you might stumble by mistake into Get Wicked, the
clothing store stocking skateboarder and hip-hop threads next door,
and give its two ancient video game machines a spin.</TE>
<TE>   Trendy food served fast in a bustling ambience just fit for
college student types is what keeps the eateries in the area packed.</TE>
<TE>   Among the most popular are Japan Bistro Blue Marlin and Hurry
Curry of Tokyo, where there was hardly room to breathe on a recent
Friday evening, despite a C rating posted in the window. A new
outpost of Curry House, a Japanese-style curry and spaghetti
franchise, opened this month on the second floor of the Sawtelle
Place mini-mall and already has customers queuing up patiently on
weekend nights.</TE>
<TE>   There are, of course, traditional restaurants as well: At Manpuku
Tokyo BBQ, a yakiniku restaurant, customers toss plump, bite-sized
bits of chicken and beef over tabletop grills and wash them down with
wakame seaweed soup. At Asahi Ramen, a perpetually jammed noodle
house, just about every dish consists of large ceramic bowls full
with miso soup in which various kinds of wheat noodles, or ramen,
float alongside pork medallions, crispy chopped green onion, sprouts,
bamboo shoots and half a boiled egg.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1970s, the restaurants on Sawtelle Boulevard were mostly
traditional teriyaki and tempura houses owned by Japanese Americans.
The newer establishments are owned by recent emigres from Japan armed
with a flair for experimentation and a willingness to absorb
pan-Asian influences.</TE>
<TE>   Restaurateur Daibutsu Ikemizu, who operates Sawtelle Centre's Blue
Marlin Bistro, is getting ready to open another restaurant up the
street next month. The cuisine at the new place, Buddha's Dream, will
be "Asian fusion: Japanese, Vietnamese, Korean, Chinese," says the
Japanese-born and -raised Ikemizu.Ikemizu talks about the perfect
customers he envisioned for his new enterprise: a young couple who
sit at a table covered with five or six dishes, each representative
of a different Asian cuisine, and sample them all.</TE>
<TE>   Where throngs of young pedestrians are found, hip shopping is
surely not far away. Besides the Giant Robot store, Far East
Connections and the vintage clothing mecca Black Market are recent
additions that point toward a trend.</TE>
<TE>   The 9-month-old Far East Connections stocks between 10,000 and
15,000 used manga comics, read voraciously in Japan, and fresh issues
of Japan's hottest fashion bibles--CanCam, ViVi and JJ. For those in
the know about music, art and graphic design, the shop also boasts a
handful of used design magazines with cult-like appeal, including
collectible copies of Cut, Brutus, Studio Voice and Relax that sell
for as little as $5 here but are seen for $30 or more elsewhere. On
display is even a vintage copy of Bar-F-Out, a defunct but legendary
magazine printed in a mix of English and Japanese that used to cover
the Tokyo underground culture.</TE>
<TE>   Owner Kotaro Mori lives in nearby Venice and estimates that 40% of
his clientele are young American adults, a lot of whom can speak and
read Japanese. "I was surprised by that," Mori says.</TE>
<TE>   The collision of Japan's youth culture and L.A.'s home-grown
subcultures has sparked exciting possibilities on Sawtelle. "This
area is becoming fashionable," Mori says and pauses, looking for the
right word--"and creative."</TE>
<TE>   Giant Robot's Nakamura agrees; he opened his shop because of the
vibe of the place. "We just felt we could survive on this street; I'm
still trying to figure out where the neighborhood will go from here,"
he says.</TE>
<TE>   Mori dreams of organizing a street festival. "I don't want to be
like Little Tokyo or Torrance," both of which have Japanese
festivals, he says. Except in one respect: Those neighborhoods have a
tradition of community events that Mori would like to see infiltrate
Sawtelle. "Personally," he says, "I want to make this area really
cool."</TE>
<TE>   At Black Market, a store co-owned by Korean entrepreneur Jisook
Lee, the counter is fashioned out of the front of an old silver
Pontiac. On sale are pricey, well-worn gypsy skirts and a selection
of vintage Levi cords and jackets. Steve Mok, who works there, points
to a series of drawings artfully choreographed into a window display.
Since it opened last December, Black Market has hosted monthly
mini-shindigs, during which local artists work on new window displays
in store, while customers watch and groove to a DJ set.</TE>
<TE>   Video Addict owner Eiren Chong sits at a tiny sidewalk table and
chats with customers as they duck inside for armfuls of video tapes.
Video Addict is a serious resource that draws customers from
throughout L.A. Besides Japanese, Chinese, Korean and Hong Kong
films, its racks are filled with just about every TV drama, soap,
documentary and variety show broadcast on Japanese television going
back to 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Plastered on the wall next to the cash register are relationship
charts that help the faithful keep up with their TV soaps--"He likes
her, she likes this other guy." Real insider stuff. Two shy Japanese
students from Santa Monica College, who give only their first
names--Kyoko and Kayo--slide behind a fluttering yellow curtain to
get their dose of the latest episodes of a Japanese variety program
called "Hey! Hey! Hey!"</TE>
<TE>   "We did have a lot of the film industry people come in before the
[American] launch of the 'Iron Chef' TV show to look up things for
research purposes," Chong says.</TE>
<TE>   His customers are mostly Japanese speakers, because the TV shows
have no subtitles--although the Hong Kong films do. Among the
non-Japanese, says Chong, "we do get some maniacs who come in to get
a movie even though it's not subtitled."</TE>
<TE>   On a recent weekend night, Lina Washington, a former veterinary
assistant who grew up in Japan but has lived in the U.S. for 16
years, walks out of Video Addict with a plastic shopping bag filled
with tapes. "That's the only place they have the Japanese TV shows I
want," she says in Queen's English, which, she adds, she learned in
Japan. She particularly likes to get the Japanese analogues of
American TV shows: "The Japanese ones are funnier."</TE>
<TE>   And so it is with Sawtelle--a West L.A. neighborhood where you can
peruse Japanese teen fashion mags with names like Cutie, Muffin and
Potato; get acquainted with Asian pop culture icons; and hang out
with stylish Japanese youth--all analogues to their U.S.
counterparts, only sometimes funkier and funnier.</TE>

<LD>After topping the nation's album sales charts for two weeks, Bruce
Springsteen's "The Rising" falls to No. 3 this week behind two
hip-hop collections that earlier held the No. 1 spot and are
continuing to build massive sales totals, according to Nielsen
SoundScan figures released Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Springsteen's series of reflections on the emotional toll of Sept.
11 sold 167,000 copies last week to bring its three-week total to an
impressive 931,000 copies.</LD>
<LD>   Nelly's "Nellyville," which was No. 1 for three weeks earlier this
summer, returns there after selling 183,000 copies last week, nipping
Eminem's "The Eminem Show," which sold 179,000 copies.</LD>
<TE>   The Nelly album has now sold 2.7 million in two months, while
Eminem's album, which was No. 1 for five weeks earlier in the year,
has sold 5 million copies in a little more than three months.</TE>
<TE>   James Taylor's "October Road" is the highest-ranking newcomer on
the chart this week, finishing No. 4 with sales of 154,000 copies.</TE>
<TE>   In reviewing the album for The Times, writer Randy Lewis suggested
that "October Road" would have been a "respectable if not especially
scintillating addition to the veteran singer-songwriter's folk-rock
canon" if it had been released a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Coming in this post-Sept. 11 age of global uncertainty, his music
offers a particularly reassuring emotional salve, much as it did
three decades back when he arrived at the height of the Vietnam War,"
Lewis noted</TE>
<TE>   The remaining positions in the Top 10 are held, in order, by Avril
Lavigne, volume 10 of "Now That's What I Call Music," Toby Keith,
Linkin Park, the "XXX" soundtrack and Scarface.</TE>
<TE>   Three other releases entered the chart in the Top 20. They are
Nickel Creek's "This Side" at No. 18, Snoop Dogg's "Snoop Dog
Presents ... " at No. 19 and Slum Village's "Trinity (Past, Present &amp;
Future)" at No. 20.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's best-selling single remains the Dixie Chicks' "Long
Time Gone." The country trio's third album, "Home," will be released
Tuesday and is given a strong chance by retailers to enter the chart
at No. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Like the hit single, the album finds the Chicks sticking to their
traditional country roots rather than playing the pop crossover game
that has taken the heart out of so much recent country music.</TE>

<DH>Bain's gripping performance paces a downbeat 'Failure of
Nerve'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHILIP BRANDES</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If it's not one thing, it's your mother, the saying goes. And if
there's a key to unraveling Canadian playwright Larry Fineberg's
intellectually probing but emotionally bewildering new downbeat
drama, "Failure of Nerve," it lies in the icy matriarchal presence
supplied by Barbara Bain's gripping performance for Playwrights'
Arena at the Los Angeles Theatre Center.</LD>
<LD>   "Don't give in to a failure of nerve," Bain's imperious,
67-year-old Irma urges her daughter, Susan (Elizabeth Cava), a
psychiatrist in the throes of a life crisis. "Have the courage to see
it through."</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, Irma's notion of courage amounts only to stoic
endurance--"getting through" life within the strict confines of
propriety.</LD>
<TE>   Irma is so good at not seeing unpleasant realities that the death
of her other daughter years earlier has driven her blind, a
disability that Bain skillfully leverages into a mechanism of
controlling others.</TE>
<TE>   Susan's psychiatric training provides little defense against
Irma's ability to push her buttons of insecurity. After the troubled
Susan breaks up with her kind but frustrated boyfriend, Mark (Jeff
LeBeau, over an infidelity, Irma's first reaction is to ask if Susan
was at fault.</TE>
<TE>   A lifetime of undermined self-confidence like this explains, at
least partially, Susan's decision to violate her profession's
sacrosanct taboo and become emotionally involved with her patient,
Kate (Bain's real-life daughter Juliet Landau), a sociopathic waif
who brings nothing but trouble to those around her.</TE>
<TE>   A convincing emotional predator, Landau's Kate unerringly homes in
on Susan's vulnerabilities. Reversing their therapist-patient
relationship, Kate points out that Susan worries "so much about
crossing lines that you're all boxed in." Kate lures Susan out of her
box, not with a siren call to the dark side she inhabits, but rather
with a promise of loyal friendship. Susan takes the bait, with
disastrous consequences.</TE>
<TE>   Bad decisions are plentiful in Fineberg's universe. Mark's sister,
Jane (Gigi Bermingham), an icon of level-headed, well-adjusted
domesticity and motherhood, commits the most unfathomable blunder of
all with her new infant.</TE>
<TE>   There's a hopeless tone to the predictable unfolding tragedy that
runs counter to the American sensibility Hemingway articulated in his
line "Man can be destroyed but not defeated." Here the defeat is a
given, the narrative only a confirmation.</TE>
<TE>   While Kate ultimately emerges as much a victim as her prey, her
amoral nature begs for more ambiguity than Jon Lawrence Rivera's
staging permits. Though Susan is quick to excuse Kate's
transgressions as circumstantial, there's no reason we need to--or
believe that Kate is truly repentant in the end, for that matter.</TE>
<TE>   Playing for sympathy is the wrong strategy here--ultimately, it's
hard to feel sorry for characters whose misfortunes are not the
result of circumstances they can't control, but rather of their own
idiotic choices.</TE>

<HD>A New Reality for Reporter Lisa Joyner</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG BRAXTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>KTTV-TV entertainment reporter Lisa Joyner has left the station to
devote more time to producing and developing a new reality-based
series.</LD>
<LD>   "The station made me a very generous offer, but I feel that it's
time to move on," Joyner said Wednesday. "It was a tough decision.
But I'm really motivated to do other things."</LD>
<LD>   Joyner, whose last official day was last Friday, has been at KTTV
for more than five years. In addition to reporting show business news
on KTTV's 10 p.m. newscast,   she hosted a regular segment, "Lisa's
L.A."  on which she spotlighted local trends and establishments.</LD>
<TE>   She also filled in often on "Good Day L.A.," the station's morning
news show.</TE>
<TE>   "I really wanted to get into producing," Joyner said. "I'm the
only entertainment reporter in L.A. that produced her own reports. I
love to get my hands dirty, and I love to write."</TE>
<TE>   She said the parting with KTTV was amicable: "I had a good
relationship there. They had plans for me to do other things. But my
immediate boss [news director Jose Rios] understood that I wanted to
move on."</TE>
<TE>   Said Rios in a statement: "Lisa Joyner has decided to pursue
interests outside the station. She did a good job in the years she
was here. We wish her well."</TE>
<TE>   Station executives added that there are no immediate plans to
replace her.</TE>
<TE>   Joyner's immediate plans include the development of a "personal
project" that she would host and produce.</TE>
<TE>   While declining to give specific details about the project, Joyner
said it was "an idea involving some things I've gone through in my
life."</TE>
<TE>   A network has already shown interest in the project, Joyner said:
"We should know something in the next few days."</TE>

<HD>Balletic Leaps for Russian Orchestra</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL CARIAGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ballet music is a natural and inevitable showcase for symphonic
display, but listeners don't necessarily perceive its value.</LD>
<LD>   Enter, or, rather, reenter the Russian National Orchestra, coming
back to the Hollywood Bowl after a three-year break this week for two
concerts, plus a gig with jazzman Dave Brubeck at the Cerritos Center
for the Performing Arts that was on Monday night.</LD>
<LD>   The first of the Bowl concerts, under the ensemble's associate
conductor, Dmitri Liss, was devoted to three familiar Russian ballet
scores: a suite from Tchaikovsky's "Swan Lake," the Divertimento from
Stravinsky's "Fairy's Kiss" and the 1945 version of the same
composer's suite from "The Firebird." And the orchestra won over the
modest audience Tuesday night with a special gift of a performance.</LD>
<TE>   Presided over with the large, high gestures of Liss, the music was
compelling. The orchestra, founded in 1990, and the first Russian
symphonic organization since 1917 to be free of government control,
is a virtuosic band that balances strong ensemble values with
accomplished solo playing.</TE>
<TE>   On this evening, the woodwind and brass soloists, in particular
trumpet player Vladislav Lavrik in the "Swan Lake" excerpts, shone.</TE>
<TE>   All the playing boasted transparency, an ingrained sense of style
and a line of continuity that propelled the music forward. Some of
the tempos pushed themselves beyond those that dancers might choose,
yet nothing hectic or frenzied colored these readings. Liss'
leadership is excitable but not precipitous.</TE>
<TE>   With an unforced authenticity, everything fell into place: the
showiness and bravura of the character dances in "Swan Lake," the
quirkiness, wit and flights of fancy in "Fairy's Kiss," the familiar
and beloved landscape of "Firebird."</TE>
<TE>   The Russian National Orchestra, conducted by Alexander Vedernikov
and with soloists soprano Galina Gorchakova and baritone Sergei
Leiferkus, plays an operatic program in Hollywood Bowl, 2301 N.
Highland Ave., Hollywood, tonight at 8. $1-$76. (323) 850-2000.</TE>

<HD>Parents Cautioned to Monitor TV's 9/11 Replays</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Most children 4 and younger don't realize that it's a taped replay
from Sept. 11 when television screens show the World Trade Center
collapsing in a cloud of dust. They think it's happening all over
again.</LD>
<LD>   Some NBC News executives were taken aback when told that by Harold
Koplewicz, a psychiatrist and founder of the New York University
Child Study Center.</LD>
<LD>   The network has taken the unusual step of hiring Koplewicz as an
advisor, realizing the hours of coverage planned for the one-year
anniversary of the terrorist attacks could reverberate in unexpected
ways.</LD>
<TE>   "If we're going to show images of the buildings falling down
again, parents should be very concerned about the effect it will have
on children," Koplewicz said. "Children under age 5 should not be
watching this."</TE>
<TE>   Koplewicz understands why the networks will cover the anniversary
extensively. He's hoping for a little sensitivity; maybe broadcasters
can warn parents in advance when some of the more disturbing images
will be shown again.</TE>
<TE>   Film of people screaming and running away from the World Trade
Center debris cloud is particularly upsetting to young people, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I frankly don't see any value in kids seeing this," he said.
"What upsets kids is seeing adults out of control."</TE>

<HD>A Music Fan Stranded Outside the Velvet Rope</HD>
<DH>What's a young person to do when club policies and liquor
laws keep him from seeing a favorite band?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BLAKE HENNON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Astronomy." "Don't Fear the Reaper." "The Siege and Investiture of
Baron von Frankenstein's Castle at Weisseria." I was pumped. I was
finally going to see Blue Oyster Cult, a band that, along with the
Rolling Stones and a selection of Gerber products, nourished me as a
child.</LD>
<LD>   When I learned BOC was playing a gig in the area, I immediately
bought a ticket online, overcame my distaste for the geriatric idea
of a rock concert served up with a sit-down dinner, and braved the
101 to the Canyon Dinner Theatre in Agoura Hills.</LD>
<LD>   As I waited in line, I noticed the cartoon-like bouncer checking
IDs. No problem there--I figured there was a wristband system to keep
the under-21s like me away from the bar. Not so, Johnny Bravo
informed me. This was strictly 21-plus and I would have to head back
to my lonely dorm room.</LD>
<TE>   Wait a minute, I protested. At no time in the ticket purchasing
process was an age restriction mentioned--not on Ticketmaster's sale
page, not on the Canyon's Ticketmaster venue information page and not
on the physical ticket.</TE>
<TE>   That was a problem with Ticketmaster, he said after conferring
with his boss. The Canyon would not refund my ticket. Ticketmaster
did not refund my ticket. I was out $40 and a Friday night, and still
hadn't seen Blue Oyster Cult play "Godzilla."</TE>
<TE>   I wasn't the only loser. What about BOC? The band probably badgers
its manager every week about not having any young fans--but we are
here, just outside the velvet rope. BOC and I had both fallen afoul
of what seemed a cynical scam to sell more alcohol. If that was the
case, there was a simple solution--drink tickets. Two-drink minimum,
paid at the door in exchange for tickets that can be swapped for
soda. The Galaxy in Santa Ana does it. I wanted to see Jerry
Cantrell, so I coughed up $6 and sucked down two flat Cokes.</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe the clubs had made a decision to preserve an "adult"
atmosphere, which is silly. The most childish people at concerts are
the sloppy drunk guys without dates to shame them into line.</TE>
<TE>   I had to fight for my right to party, even alcohol-free. It was
unfair that I would miss 21-and-older shows for Mother Hips and the
B-52s. Was I being punished for liking music out of my demographic?
My quest soon pulled me deeper and deeper into the byzantine
mysteries of one of the state's most secret societies: California's
Department of Alcohol Beverage Control, known as ABC.</TE>
<TE>   Two Kinds of Licenses</TE>
<TE>   ABC, it turns out, holds at least one end of the velvet rope. It
issues two alcohol licenses that apply to clubs with live music: Type
47 and Type 48.</TE>
<TE>   Type 47 licenses are for "bona fide eating places," basically a
place with a full-service kitchen that regularly serves meals. All
ages are allowed. The Roxy is a Type 47 establishment.</TE>
<TE>   Type 48 licenses are for bars and nightclubs that may or may not
serve some food, but are not "bona fide eating places." These must be
exclusively 21-plus. Minors are not allowed to enter and remain.
Unless, of course, they're performing. Minor musicians are allowed in
but must be kept in a restricted area.</TE>
<TE>   Spaceland has a Type 48 license.</TE>
<TE>   "It has nothing to do with us," Spaceland promoter Mitchell Frank
says. "When I started a club there 8 1/2 years ago, I wanted to have
a neighborhood place to hang out. I never envisioned it becoming what
it is now. The age restriction is nothing personal."</TE>
<TE>   While Spaceland must be 21-plus by law, Frank does promote
all-ages shows at the Knitting Factory Hollywood, El Rey, the Wiltern
and other rooms.</TE>
<TE>   OK, the liquor license answer made sense. It was state law. I
could live with that.</TE>
<TE>   Then three words wormed into my mind: House of Blues. The House of
Blues in West Hollywood has a restaurant, but it's completely
separated from the concert space. Also, the age restriction varies
from show to show. Buckcherry was all ages. Duran Duran was not. Once
again, I was being shut out because the band was hot, say, 15 years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no rhyme or reason to it," said Anjali Raval, House of
Blues' publicist. "It's the band and what their agent agrees with our
talent buyer is the audience."</TE>
<TE>   This process is too subjective, and I don't understand the
reasoning behind it. I doubt bands tell venues they don't want to
play to people under 21. Teenagers are major music buyers. Even if
the teenagers who originally bought a band's album are in their 30s
or 40s now, younger fans are discovering that music and buying CDs.</TE>
<TE>   The arbitrary exclusions don't work in reverse. The Knitting
Factory, for example, is always all ages. Acts there also
consistently play more to a college audience than the House of Blues,
but the Knitting Factory doesn't ban patrons older than 45.</TE>
<TE>   This information left a lingering resentment. The Canyon is a
full-service restaurant, so it should be a Type 47. Did BOC ask to
have me excluded? I called the club to ask why they served food and
still were 21-plus, but I wasn't able to get an answer. The owner was
out of town and then prepping the place for Styx.</TE>
<TE>   Question of Age Comfort</TE>
<TE>   I suspect the real root of the problem is age comfort. The Canyon
and House of Blues as well as bands' managements want to make older
fans happy so they'll return. An older crowd might not like
17-year-olds pushing their way up front.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, some 17-year-olds don't want 40-year-olds rubbing up
against them. The older guys at a show by the Donnas, a young
all-female punk band, were frightening. Not that I'm advocating
30-and-under-only shows. I have nothing against the audience's Flash
Gordons.</TE>
<TE>   My solution? Overcome age restrictions in the time-honored manner
of kids since the dawn of jazz: Get a fake ID. I had two, in fact.
One looked believable but said I was 6 feet tall and had brown eyes.
It was useless. No discerning check could miss my handsome blues. Or
the fact that I look like I'm 12. The other card looked like a fake.
It got me in to see Cheap Trick (although I think the security guy
rolled his eyes when inspecting it), but I was turned away from a
Black Crowes show I'd traveled four hours to see. Funny, in their
early years, the Crowes had to hide Rich Robinson at bar gigs until
show time because he was underage.</TE>
<TE>   But why would ABC want to make me a criminal? Fakes should be
unnecessary when it comes to concerts. ABC's Type 48 license is
designed to keep kids from drinking. Face it: Kids will always find a
way to drink. Keep us out of bars and we'll drink at home. You're
just saving us money that can be put toward a more sophisticated
fake.</TE>
<TE>   Hopefully, ABC will make an exception for Type 48 licensees with
concerts. Until then, however, I can go to Ozzfest but I can't see
the Monkees.</TE>

M.F.K. Fisher, a good cup of espresso and cream currant scones.</LD>
<LD>   Back then, I regularly cycled down from Pasadena to breakfast at
this cute little cafe and market and often came back for lunch as
well. The uphill ride home was long and hard but, on balance, worth
the trouble. It was wonderful to snack in the shade of Julienne's
huge oak tree, especially before so many restaurants opened in Old
Town Pasadena.</LD>
<LD>   I still come to breakfast on bread pudding French toast with fresh
peach sauce, crisp salmon hash topped with a pair of perfectly
poached eggs and the hazelnut-rich granola with yogurt and fresh
fruit--a cyclist's dream.</LD>
<TE>   Lunch is still good too. Currently the menu runs to summery items
such as a classic gazpacho and a salad of garden greens with
Gorgonzola and toasted pecans.</TE>
<TE>   For all these years, Julienne has been a neighborhood hangout, a
de facto daytime social club and cafe. So I was surprised when
Julienne decided to open for dinner (only during the summer months,
through the end of September). But I was not surprised to find that
dinner at Julienne is a lovely affair. Practically everyone sits on
the quiet, leafy patio facing Mission Street, shielded from the sky
by giant boughs. The tables are set in crisp white linen. The staff
is young and enthusiastic, though it could use a little more
confidence when talking about the food.</TE>
<TE>   Happily, many of the dishes speak for themselves. It's hard not to
fill up on the free warm rosemary rolls. (I'd pass, though, on the
oily, overly filling Parmesan-and garlic-crusted sourdough, for which
you pay $3.50 extra.)</TE>
<TE>   Appetizers are a particular strength here. The warm spinach and
frisee salad is good enough to stand on its own, but the addition of
pepper bacon and almond-crusted chevre is delicious, and the
combination is a real meal. An heirloom tomato salad with arugula,
fennel, French beans and ricotta combines intense flavors with a
remarkable lightness. Grilled garlic shrimp come with a lively,
appealingly crunchy avocado-corn salsa.</TE>
<TE>   As at many a fledgling dinner house, the main dishes sometimes
slip. The Provencal shrimp and scallop bourride tastes more of
Altadena than of Arles--the broth is watery and has only the faintest
flavor of saffron. (The aioli-topped slice of nicely toasted baguette
at the bottom of the soup dish deserves better.) And linguine with
herbed wild mushrooms, garlic cream sauce and roasted asparagus isn't
really a dish, just a bowl of ingredients.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there are success stories, including Tuscan meatloaf, one
of the lunch menu dishes. Made with good quality meat, it's glazed
with a spicy tomato chutney that makes you wonder why anyone would
ever eat ketchup. It comes with a pile of great mashed potatoes. The
seared rosemary lamb chops, nicely juicy and gamy, are served with a
fine summer ratatouille. The classic French bistro dish steak with
pommes frites is done with flair. The grilled rib eye comes with
correctly crisp potatoes and, as a bonus, an interesting, complex
Cognac-mustard Bearnaise.</TE>
<TE>   Pastry chef Marsha Hong does a few complicated desserts at
dinnertime, but nothing you'd call fussy. Frozen citrus souffle with
lemon curd and blackberry compote is my favorite. Second would be a
plate of roasted peaches, honey-sweetened mascarpone and Port/cherry
sauce laced with star anise. I'd also come back for creme brulee
profiteroles with espresso chocolate fudge sauce or for anything
baked and served in the morning, such as croissants, pecan sticky
buns or flaky scones. Dinner, unless you hurry, will have to wait for
next summer.</TE>

<HD>Spotting the Trends in Japanese Fashion in L.A.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sorina Diaconescu</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Japanese youth are among the most devout students of "cool" on the
planet and make it a point of pride to literally wear their trendy
interpretations of pop culture on their sleeves. The distinctions
between fashion sub-tribes are so subtle as to be practically
indistinguishable to Western observers, but to Japanese teens they
are a symbol of belonging. Forget punks versus preps; what about
boudaa-kei versus shibuya-kei?</LD>
<LD>   These tribes also change with dizzying speed--small items like
socks may change styles in the space of a few weeks. High school
girls in particular are known to throw themselves into a new "kei,"
or style, as soon as it bubbles forth from the pages of fashion
magazines, or from the trend-setting racks and window displays of a
mall called 109, located in Tokyo's Shibuya district.</LD>
<LD>   The slightly older and wiser--say, twentysomethings--are less
likely to succumb to such trends but are still committed to knowing
all the details so as not to be outdone by their younger
counterparts. Many young Japanese who come to live and study in Los
Angeles find the casual West Coast uniform of T-shirts and jeans "too
simple, too rough," says Kotaro Mori, owner of the Far East
Connections used-comics store on Sawtelle, who also acts as an agent
for a Japanese company that imports rare and vintage T-shirts from
the United States.</LD>
<TE>   "Some young people change their look when they come to L.A.," Mori
says. "They try to blend in, adopt a more casual style. But when they
hang out with their Japanese peers--which they do all the time--they
have to show that they are fashionable." So they buy the magazines
that allow them to keep up with the latest trends, just in case the
occasion demands that they save face.</TE>
<TE>   With the softening influence of L.A., it is unlikely you will
encounter extreme fashionistas on Sawtelle like the EGLs (Elegant
Gothic Lolitas)--young women who used to haunt Tokyo a few seasons
back in outfits best described as Barbie-meets-Morticia Addams. The
youth haunting Sawtelle are considerably more mellow and mature, but
they're still quite precise. Being outside the raging trend mill of
Tokyo doesn't mean they've dropped their obsessions. It's just
settled into a few more common types that seem to fit L.A.:</TE>
<TE>   1. Boudaa-kei, or boarder style: a look popular among guys, but
increasingly adopted by young women. It consists of casual/sporty
duds favored by skateboarders, which one ideally customizes with a
personal twist. On a recent afternoon on Sawtelle, Miki Sakoma, 22,
broke down her look: low-waisted cargo pants, baggy T-shirt from the
legendary skate brand Shorty's, and Circa sneakers with a zippered
pocket where a boudaa-kei gyaru (boarder gal) stashes keys or cash.
Sakoma's personal touch: purple nylon hair extensions and baby-blue
contacts.</TE>
<TE>   2. Shibuya-kei, or the look that originated in Tokyo's Shibuya
district. Feminine and casual, this style of dress is heavily reliant
on high-end designer brands, so a credit card is an essential
accessory. Miwa Harada, 25, recently found slurping an iced latte
drink around Sawtelle's Olympic Collection mall, explained what a
shibuya-kei gyaru needs to look fly: micro-mini jean skirts,
preferably from labels Frankie B., Seven or Paper Denim; sandals with
sculpted wooden heels by Sky ("I have a collection of 20," Harada
says), and Christian Dior pink aviator sunglasses. Harada's personal
touch: topping her moneyed look with a "cheap" camouflage-print bag.</TE>
<TE>   3. Vintage T-shirts: Perpetually enamored with things that are
hard to find--the rarer, the better--the young and fashionable
Japanese are currently mad for old T-shirts. Most prized are old
employee shirts from Starbucks stores in exotic locations (Beijing,
Europe); ancient T-shirts sporting the M&amp;M's or McDonald's logos; and
dead-stock Adidas and Nike T-shirts from the '80s.</TE>
<TE>   4. Customized cell phones: According to Look-Look, a Web site
dedicated to the research of global youth culture, one of the hottest
street fashion trends in Japan is teens "treating phones like pets or
extensions of themselves." Expect to see them covered in glitter and
cute stickers, worn around the neck on a string like a pendant, or
strung on a chain together with cartoon character dolls and good-luck
charms.</TE>
<TE>   For a full-on immersion in the alternate universe of Japanese
youth fashion, check out a new book called "Fruits" (Phaidon Press,
2001), a greatest-hits collection of snapshots that document the
weirdest and the most creative in Tokyo street fashion, by
photographer Shoichi Aoki.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Quench any attack of the munchies and expand your culinary horizons
by sampling these fanciful snacks in the Sawtelle area:</LD>
<LD>   Fermented Beverages</LD>
<LD>   Neither yogurt nor soft drink but something in between, this
concoction is a popular vending-machine staple in the land of the
rising sun. Japanese and Korean kids get it delivered at home every
day and are practically weaned on it. Made with sugar, skim milk and
live lactobacillus strains, the drinks often come in a rainbow of
flavors, from coffee to melon. Available at the Nijiya Market are the
flavor-free brand Yakult ($2.99 for a pack of five teensy bottles)
and fruity rival Calpico Water (69 cents for a 200-milliliter
carton), not to be confused with Calpis Water (79 cents for a
250-milliliter carton).</LD>
<TE>   Candy</TE>
<TE>   Storm the candy rack at Nijiya Market and you will find that half
the fun is deciphering the oddly named brands and English-language
slogans printed on packages. Try the Meiji Horn Chocolate and maybe
you too will discover that "a delicate crispy cookie wrapping softly
melting whipped chocolate makes an elegant and fashionable chocolate
snack" ($1.99 for one pack). Meiji Chelsea Yogurt Scotch is, despite
the name that indicates otherwise, merely butterscotch-flavored hard
candy ($1.29 for one pack).</TE>
<TE>   Be forewarned: Pocky--pretzel sticks dipped in a mind-boggling
array of glazes, from strawberry mousse "aero-chocolate" to green
tea--are addictive. And of course, "for the type of person who enjoys
the finer points in life," there is even Men's Pocky, coated in
appropriately masculine dark chocolate. ($1.99 or more for one pack,
depending on size and flavor.)</TE>
<TE>   Wagashi</TE>
<TE>   These are traditional Japanese desserts, usually soft cakes made
from mochi (dough-like glutinous rice), variously flavored and filled
with red bean or lima bean paste. They are mildly sweet, have a
delicately chewy texture and go well with a hot cup of sen-cha (green
tea). Fancy varieties are individually wrapped in cobweb-thin gift
paper and provide an elegant alternative to a box of chocolates.</TE>
<TE>   Start by sampling the mixed wagashi plate, featuring a quartet of
bite-sized cakes shaped and flavored like fruits--persimmon, plum,
green apple--complete with tiny leaves fashioned out of mochi.
(Available at Nijiya Market, $3.60 for an assortment of four.) Kubota
kuri daifuku are dark mochi balls with a soft center of chestnut and
red bean paste, dusted with potato starch. ($3.99 for a pack of
eight.) Komochi are the plainest of them all, just tiny blobs of
sticky rice ($2 for a pack of 28 at Nijiya Market), which puff up if
you stick them for a few seconds in a microwave available at the
front of the store.</TE>
<TE>   Takoyaki</TE>
<TE>   This tasty fried octopus snack originated in the Osaka area,
famous for its gourmand population. Similar in shape and size to golf
balls, takoyaki are rolled from a mixture of batter and chopped bits
of octopus, green onion and ginger, then fried in a contraption that
looks like a waffle-maker. They taste best dipped in mayonnaise or
tonkatsu sauce. Swing by the in-store stand preparing takoyaki at the
Nijiya Market on Saturdays and Sundays from 1 to 8 p.m. Enjoy a pack
of these chewy treats at the sidewalk tables in front of the store.
($2.50 for seven takoyaki made to order, including dipping sauce.)</TE>
<TE>   Doughnuts and Cakes--With a Twist</TE>
<TE>   Ever want to temper the guilty pleasure of a Krispy Kreme doughnut
with some nutritious content? Duck into the Ginza-Ya pastry store and
sample the selection of deep-fried doughnuts. One bite into the plump
dough balls reveals surprise fillings, like curry and potato salad
($1.35 and $1.25 each, respectively). Or try the incongruous Wiener
Danish ($1); it tastes better than it sounds. For fluffy desserts,
head to Mousse Fantasy, a Japanese-style kissaten (coffee shop) that
serves cheap set meals for breakfast and lunch and--hurray!--sells
Hello Kitty paraphernalia too. Try the specialty white peach mousse
with melon glazing, topped with a peppermint leaf ($4 each).</TE>

<LD>All cold and no play would make Chris a dull boy indeed, but that
wasn't a problem at the El Rey Theatre on Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Translation: The English band Coldplay and its frontman, Chris
Martin, confronted this year's career crossroads and came out all
dripping sweat, flashing lights and rocking hard.</LD>
<LD>   With their winsome hit "Yellow," they arrived last year as a
down-to-earth alternative to the pop world's din--a rainy-day,
piano-grounded counterpart to similarly earnest bands such as Travis,
an heir to the articulate, tasteful, organic craftsmanship of such
broad-based artists as Sting.</LD>
<TE>   On its first tour of this country, Coldplay's shows were energized
by a freshness that came with being an out-of-nowhere success, and
the band benefited greatly from the breezy enthusiasm in Martin's
manner.</TE>
<TE>   With its second album about to come out, Coldplay is now an
established presence--in fact, in this time of rapid turnover in pop
music it almost seems like a comfortable old veteran. With the
initial buzz gone, the band needed to find a different framework for
its concerts.</TE>
<TE>   Why not just play the songs?</TE>
<TE>   Well, that would make for a pretty downbeat evening. Like its 2000
debut album, "Parachutes," the new "A Rush of Blood to the Head" (due
in stores Tuesday) is slow, somber and introspective, channeling
stately keyboards, chiming guitar and Martin's plangent voice into
dark pools of troubled reflections on relationships and, it appears,
politics (the title phrase refers to the physical impetus for some
violent actions that may or may not be metaphorical).</TE>
<TE>   With its imaginative arrangements and rich melodies, "Rush" is
challenging and deliberate. But Coldplay is an ambitious group, one
that's not content to conduct a low-key ceremony for the most patient
fraction of its audience.</TE>
<TE>   The solution offered at the El Rey show (which ended a series of
eight small-venue concerts preceding Coldplay's formal tour) was to
go grand.</TE>
<TE>   Martin, while retaining his easy rapport with a crowd, has become
a much more physical performer, executing Townshend-like jumps and
snapping his lanky frame in arresting punctuation with the music.</TE>
<TE>   And Martin (alternating between piano and guitar), guitarist Jon
Buckland, bassist Guy Berryman and drummer Will Champion repeatedly
found the most aggressive ways to attack these ballads, while still
keeping them ballads.</TE>
<TE>   The approach didn't always emphasize the songs' essential
emotional contours, but it never violated their nature with false
jollity, and the band managed to build a credible bridge between its
signature sound and a lean, rocking, Jesus and Mary Chain-like take
on Echo &amp; the Bunnymen's "Lips Like Sugar."</TE>
<TE>   And you're looking for a band with a little class and dignity?
Give Coldplay (which plays the sold-out Greek Theatre Sept. 10) extra
points for not once mentioning that they have a new album coming out
next week.</TE>

<DH>Dolls exchanged between American and Japanese children
become potent symbols of both friendship and life.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALERIE J. NELSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A regal reunion of aging cultural ambassadors gathered at the
Japanese American National Museum turns poignant as their stories are
revealed. One Japanese immigrant was rescued from a basement.
Another, clad in an elegant jade kimono, was put on public display in
her adopted country and forced to face the wall.</LD>
<LD>   The 75-year-old emissaries standing at attention in the chilly
exhibition hall are remnants of an earlier era, when the children of
the United States and Japan reached across an ocean by exchanging
potent symbols of childhood.</LD>
<LD>   These littlest diplomats are dolls.</LD>
<TE>   In 1927, American schoolchildren sent more than 12,700 dolls to
Japan as part of a grass-roots friendship gesture set in motion by
Sidney L. Gulick, a U.S. missionary who lived in Japan for 25 years.
In return, Japanese schoolchildren donated the equivalent of about a
half-penny apiece to pay for the oversized Japanese dolls that were
shipped to this country. A total of 58 were sent--one for each of
Japan's prefectures, major cities and pre-World War II colonies. The
dolls toured America before landing in museums in 46 states.</TE>
<TE>   This gathering of seven of the "blue-eyed dolls" and the five
stately torei ningya, or "return dolls," is the first time the dolls
have been brought together "in a large way on the West Coast," says
Lisa Itagaki, co-curator of the exhibition called "Passports to
Friendship."</TE>
<TE>   "This exchange is about legacy, what one man instigated and how
his educational objectives can apply now," she says. "It's very
post-9/11. People are very suspicious of people of other cultures.
Instead of being suspicious, let's initiate an exchange, let's get to
know someone else."</TE>
<TE>   The first step toward understanding comes just inside the door.
Children can pick up a four-page museum "passport" that they fill out
with personal information, including country of citizenship, before
stamping it at point of entry.</TE>
<TE>   "Coming here may be the first time children look outside of their
neighborhoods and think of themselves as American citizens or
Japanese citizens," Itagaki says. "It may expand their thinking and
help them become global members."</TE>
<TE>   The first of two exhibition rooms is spartan yet palatial, with
the nearly 3-foot-high Japanese dolls standing sentry, resplendent in
their finest threads. The dolls possess beauty pageant names like
Miss Toyama or Miss Kagawa (who was made to face the wall during
wartime with Japan), and look like potential winners. As they should.
At up to $50,000 a doll, the cost of their restoration could rival a
plastic surgeon's bill.</TE>
<TE>   The American "blue-eyed dolls" are far from showpieces. They have
less refined names, such as Helen and Erica, and have sensible, worn
clothing. Almost every elementary school in Japan received one of the
"friendship dolls" from America, says Nancy Araki, the museum's
director of community affairs.</TE>
<TE>   "During wartime, the dolls were put into storage or destroyed. A
wonderful discovery has been the 300 dolls or so that have emerged in
Japan and the stories that go with it. Teachers, principals, or
whoever, defied the Japanese military orders to destroy them," she
says.</TE>
<TE>   My 11-year-old son, who informs me on the trip downtown that "a
doll museum is not exactly my cup of tea," and I find ourselves
captivated by the same thing, sets of miniature royal dolls in
historically correct costumes that are displayed every March 3 in
honor of Girl's Day in Japan.</TE>
<TE>   One especially moving set of miniature dolls was dressed in
clothes knitted by a Japanese American mother incarcerated during the
war. She was not allowed to bring doll clothes with her yet wanted to
share the cultural tradition with her daughter.</TE>
<TE>   The interactive activities skew young--there are doll suitcases
that can be packed for a trip, postcards with the outline of a doll
to be colored in, and a tidy area where children can cull through
boxes and documents as they pretend to be museum researchers.</TE>
<TE>   My 14-year-old daughter eyes Maria, a doll that will be sent to
Japan as a thank-you and that looks suspiciously like one of her
dolls that has been packed off to our garage. "When I was 7 and
really into American Girl dolls," she says, "this would have been so
cool."</TE>

Museum, 369 E. 1st St., Los Angeles. Tuesdays-Sundays, 10 a.m.-5
p.m., till 8 p.m. on Thursdays. $6; $3, ages 6-17; 5 and younger,

<DL></DL>
<LD>* Director of the comedies "House Party" and "Boomerang." His new
film, "Serving Sara," opens Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Starting Point: I train at Billy Blanks several times a week,
including some Saturdays. The great thing about that workout is that
everything else you do that day seems easy in comparison.</LD>
<LD>   Most Important Meal: On the weekend my fiancee and I either hit Il
Fornaio or Mel's for breakfast. Sometimes it's heart attack be
damned, and we make a Roscoe's run. I know they say that chicken and
waffles is supposed to be a Southern dish, but I'm from East St.
Louis, Ill., which is "up South," but I never heard of it till I
moved to the big city. Anyway, it is so good they ought to have cots
so you can pass out right after your meal.</LD>
<TE>   Costco Fixation: I don't like to go grocery shopping, but I have a
fascination with Costco. I can't help going down every aisle. How can
you not love a place where you can buy raw meat, DVDs and car covers
in the same place?</TE>
<TE>   The Next New Thing: I keep up with the cutting edge of Asian pop
culture through Giant Robot magazine, so I was really happy when they
opened a retail shop on Sawtelle. Great T-shirts, videos,
coffee-table books and knickknacks beyond description. I usually hit
Golden Apple on Wednesday, when the new comic books arrive, but if
I'm too busy I'll cruise by on the weekend. They've got a friendly
and knowledgeable staff.</TE>
<TE>   Mo' Better Viewing: My girl doesn't eat chicken or beef, so I
usually don't get to go to Mo' Betta Meaty Meat Burgers unless my
brother Warrington is in town. They have a turkey burger that is
better than any hamburger anywhere. While I'm this far east, I'll hit
the movies at either of my favorite theaters. The ArcLight shows
Hollywood blockbusters and art films, so I can see either in a
beautiful facility with great seats. As a filmmaker the audience's
reaction is as important as the movie to me, so I also like to go to
the Magic Johnson Theatre and see how non-industry types respond.</TE>
<TE>   What to Hear Here: I love live music, and my broad taste leads me
to all kinds of venues: the Hollywood Bowl to see Kathleen Battle,
the Conga Room to see Hugh Masakela, House of Blues for Bootsy
Collins, the Greek Theatre for Jill Scott, Catalina's for Marcus
Miller, the Kodak Theatre for Prince, the California Plaza downtown
to see the Dakah Hip Hop Orchestra.</TE>

<HD>A Little Tweaking of the Blues</HD>
<DH>Rick Holmstrom put some electronic tricks into his new
blues album and, so far, he and most fans are happy with the results.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Blues musician Rick Holmstrom was clearly ready for negative
reactions to his new album, "Hydraulic Groove." For the last couple
of months fans have been invited to listen to a few songs on the Web
site of Tone Cool Records and weigh in with their opinions.</LD>
<LD>   The title of the comments section: "Holmstrom Controversy
Postings."</LD>
<LD>   That's because Holmstrom, who for the last 15 years has carved out
a career as a fairly traditional electric blues and R&amp;B player, has
strolled into the world of sampling and electronics.</LD>
<TE>   "I figured making this record that there would be a lot of people
not into it," Holmstrom says. "All the time we were making it, we
were saying, 'Get your rhino skin on. Be tough.' "</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, a couple of the fans have been brutal ("Samples and
such--that is not the blues"), but that's been about it for the
controversy. The rest of the several dozen comments posted since June
are almost entirely positive.</TE>
<TE>   "So far, most people can still see the heart and soul of the blues
in there," says Holmstrom, who plays Saturday at the Blues on the Bay
Festival in Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   He says that musicians often go astray when they go into new
territory, because "they try to change the whole thing to where it
becomes nothing. This is, 'Let's keep the lo-fi element of old blues
recordings and emphasize the beats and the wackiness of samples.' "</TE>
<TE>   Holmstrom, 37, admits that this is not an untested concept. In
fact, he played on blues veteran R.L. Burnside's 2000 album "I Wish I
Was in Heaven Sitting Down," in which Burnside's rough-edged Delta
sound was given electronic treatment.</TE>
<TE>   "Some friends of mine were working on that and called me in to
play," Holmstrom says. "The way we recorded was how we'd always done,
everyone in the same room, funky little amps and going for a sound
like the old Chess or Excello [labels]. Then they took the tracks and
put them in a computer and tweaked them around and when I heard them
I was blown away."</TE>
<TE>   Around the same time, Holmstrom was exposed to such experiments as
Moby's "Play" album, which used samples from vintage blues and
gospel, and started to conceive a comparable approach in an entirely
blues context, with samples, urban beats and even DJ scratching as
fully integrated elements of his blues combo.</TE>
<TE>   Holmstrom began the project a bit tentatively, working with
producer Genome. Engineer-mixer Rob Schnapf worked on several
Burnside sessions.</TE>
<TE>   "What I originally intended was to just do two or three tracks
that were tricked out like this," Holmstrom says. "And as we got into
it, it became more, 'Let's see where we're going.' "</TE>
<TE>   The results range from "These Roads" and "Shake It, Pt. 2," which
are built on samples from R&amp;B guitarist Robert Ward and singer Rufus
Thomas, respectively, to the Delta-fied funk of "Gravy" to the fairly
straight-ahead groove blues of "Last to Know" and "Back It Up." There
are also bonus tracks, including one remix each by Genome and top
dance music figure DJ Logic, plus two solid instrumental jams
featuring guest organist John Medeski of the progressive jazz-jam
trio Medeski, Martin &amp; Wood.</TE>
<TE>   Holmstrom grew up in Fairbanks, Alaska, where he was given a
strong grounding in rock by his radio DJ father, developing eclectic
tastes and an appreciation for the music's roots and history.</TE>
<TE>   He also messed around playing guitar, but sports was his primary
pursuit. He moved to Southern California and played basketball at the
University of Redlands, where he also sat in on guitar with some
teammates' casual band. As his college time wound down, his musical
motivation grew.</TE>
<TE>   "In '86, '87 I got into it," he says. "It gave me that same
feeling I got playing basketball. Saturday night, gym full of
people--that was ending. I knew I wasn't going to the NBA. I was the
shortest guy on the team and the slowest. But I got the same kick out
of playing music."</TE>
<TE>   After graduation, Holmstrom moved to L.A., started hanging out at
blues clubs and "practiced night and day." He got regular gigs with
Smokey Wilson, harmonica player William Clarke and then in 1996 with
Rod Piazza &amp; the Mighty Flyers, one of the most popular bands on the
L.A. blues circuit.</TE>
<TE>   But through most of that time, any inclination toward
experimentation wasn't evident.</TE>
<TE>   "I became a traditionalist with blinders on. I didn't want to even
listen to anything later than when Magic Sam died, which was '69," he
says of the blues guitarist. "Absolutely drove my wife crazy. All I
wanted to hear was old scratchy records."</TE>
<TE>   But now he's changed his tune, so to speak.</TE>
<TE>   "If we pretend the last 50 years didn't happen, we're going to be
like Dixieland music," he says. "I'd walk into stores in Santa Monica
and see kids bopping their heads to the R.L. record, and they
wouldn't have been into my records. It was cool--like kids getting
into the blues from the Rolling Stones.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't say, 'Oh, Muddy Waters didn't do it like that.' If Bo
Diddley and those guys were around now, they'd be DJs, using
turntables and [samplers] instead of harmonicas and guitars. My
friends look at me like I've lost my mind, but I believe that."</TE>

<LD>   Marcel Marceau--At 79, French pantomime paragon Marcel Marceau
still has the power to redefine theater in his own image. In an age
of relentless amplification, he gives us the wonder of silence. In an
age of numbing literalism, he conjures up the magic of metaphor. In
an age when every facet of meaning is desperately heightened and
oversold, he dares to make demands on an audience. Watch him closely
at the Geffen Playhouse or you might miss something sublime. You
might enjoy only the easy, funny stuff--the endearing lion-tamer
routine, for instance, in which he can't get his big cat to jump
through a hoop. Slip into the way you normally gaze at movies or TV
and you'll be lost when Marceau takes on subjects and feelings that
so much entertainment is designed to keep at bay--the way, for
example, that he physicalizes the duality of human nature by making
his left hand humane and even spiritual, but the right hand carnal
and violent. Who else can make a simple walk convey the sense of life
lived too quickly and death ticking inside us with every step?</LD>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>At lunch this week, the book publisher to whom tycoon Rupert Murdoch
gave free rein and full control--Judith Regan--told me she is ready
to embark on a new phase of her career: She'll dip her toe into the
Hollywood stream that is moviemaking.</LD>
<LD>   A lot of people have predicted this would happen in due time.
Regan has made a great success out of Regan Books with her flair for
publicity and promotion (much of which features Regan as the
Sicilian-Irish star that she is), her creative new looks for books
and her ability to take the work of unknown authors nobody else wants
to publish and make them into bestsellers.</LD>
<LD>   Regan will turn her friend Bernard Kerik's work, "The Lost Son,"
into a film for Fox Searchlight, which is hoping to make itself into
"the new HBO." The former police commissioner's story is a touching
tale featuring illicit elements from his own life.</LD>
<TE>   I admire Regan's chutzpah and style. She has brought a new dash to
publishing, and now we'll see if La-La Land is ready for her. In my
eyes, she has all the attributes for a successful killer producer....</TE>
<TE>   Sophia Loren is a star of stars for the ages, and she blew
everybody away in the Napa Valley last weekend when she made a
first-ever visit there. She was on hand for son Carlo Ponti Jr.'s
conducting stint for the Russian National Orchestra at Villa Montalvo
in Saratoga.</TE>
<TE>   Sophia and son then went to John Traina's Napa Valley ranch and
visited his vineyards. In her honor, Traina had a Neapolitan lunch
served by chef Don Giovanni of the Bistro, a local hot spot.</TE>
<TE>   Sophia wandered into the kitchen, sniffed and said, "It smells
just like home!"</TE>

<LD>Video</LD>
<LD>   Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century. DIC Home Entertainment and
Lions Gate Home Entertainment. VHS (60 minutes): $10. DVD (78
minutes): $15. Ages 6 and older. www.lionsgatecorp.com</LD>
<LD>   The place: New London. The year: 2103. Inspector Beth Lestrade has
traced the source of a mysterious crime wave to none other than
Sherlock Holmes' nemesis, James Moriarty, who died 200 years before.
What to do? Use scientific advances to bring back to life the great
19th century detective himself.</LD>
<TE>   With a robotic Dr. Watson and the re-creation of his rooms at 22
Baker St., the resurrected Holmes soon adapts his methods of
deduction and observation to 22nd century mysteries.</TE>
<TE>   This video release, featuring the interconnected first episodes of
the stylish syndicated TV series, is a cut above most action
cartoons. The show's gothic look and mix of traditional cel and
computer-generated imagery are a visual kick, and the storytelling is
smart and imaginative, with episodes inspired directly by the stories
of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, from "The Final Problem" to "The Hound of
the Baskervilles."</TE>
<TE>   Maggie and the Ferocious Beast: Adventures in Nowhere Land.
Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment. VHS (38 minutes): $12.95. DVD
(46 minutes): $19.95.</TE>
<TE>   "Great googly-moogly!" That's the very unferocious reaction that
the giant, horned, polka-dotted "Ferocious Beast" has to gentle
surprises in magical Nowhere Land, where he's best pals with a little
girl named Maggie and a pig named Hamilton. This new DVD release
contains six episodes (five on the VHS version) from the Nick Jr. TV
show based on books by writer Betty Paraskevas and artist Michael
Paraskevas, a mother-and-son creative team. The winning formula is a
mix of bright colors, simple animation, stories about friends helping
friends and serene flights of fancy.</TE>
<TE>   DVD</TE>
<TE>   DVD Read-Along: Toy Story 2 and Tarzan. Walt Disney Records. 90
minutes. $14.98 each.</TE>
<TE>   Disney's modestly entertaining first DVD "Read-Along" movie
spinoffs allow viewers to follow the story--if they can read the
narrative and pieces of dialogue that appear below stills from the
films fast enough. Beginning readers will have more immediate success
with the "Vocabulary" feature: 20 movie-related nouns.</TE>
<TE>   "Toy Story 2" includes a music video performance by Riders in the
Sky; two Phil Collins music videos appear on "Tarzan." Each also
offers a simple game, song lyrics and the ability to switch back and
forth between English, German, French, Italian and Spanish. Also
included is a DVD-ROM Internet connection to Disney Web sites.</TE>
<TE>   Audio</TE>
<TE>   Reggie Rapasaurus. Ages 5 to 9. CD: $15. www.ReggieRapasaurus.com</TE>
<TE>   Several years ago, San Diego-based literacy promoter and
actor-singer Stacey Roberts began using original songs and a stuffed,
dread- lock-bedecked dinosaur named Reggie to encourage children to
read and inspire them to pursue learning. This smooth and mellow CD
by Roberts and composer-producer Bill Harris was created to share
that message with a wider audience, mixing sophisticated traditional
jazz, Latin jazz and pop melodies with simple lyrics in songs about
reading, heroes ("The Little Flea"), the ABCs, counting, the first
day of school ("Marvin the Platypus") and more.</TE>
<TE>   An anthem to the Head Start early-education program, which has
adopted the songs, while sincere and tuneful, is a bit out of place
for a general audience. "Toothache Blues," however, is a fun
departure: It's the real thing--a raspy blues song about a
candy-loving kid who has to learn something about dental hygiene.</TE>

<LD>* These rolls, wrapped in a sort of translucent rice tortilla, are
crisp, chewy, tasty--and wholesome.</LD>
<LD>   Chan Dara: Inside the Saigon rolls are cellophane noodles, shrimp,
tofu, alfalfa sprouts, shredded carrots and red leaf lettuce. A
tamarind sauce sprinkled with chopped peanuts and minced onion comes
on the side. (Saigon spring roll, $7.95.) Chan Dara, 310 N. Larchmont

Hollywood, (323) 464-8585; 11940 W. Pico Blvd., West L.A., (310)
479-4461.</LD>
<LD>   Red Pearl Kitchen: Chef Tim Goodell serves a roll filled with
sauteed crab and lobster, carrots, onions and cilantro. You pile mint
and basil on a lettuce leaf, wrap the roll up in it and dip in spicy
fish sauce. (Cold spring roll, $9.50.) Red Pearl Kitchen, 412 Walnut
St., Huntington Beach, (714) 969-0224.</LD>
<TE>   Zen Grill: The vegetarian spring rolls are stuffed with an unusual
combination of vegetables that includes cabbage, carrots, enoki
mushrooms, celery and corn. A few strands of cellophane noodles are
added to balance the crunch, and the rolls are served with a sweet
and sour dipping sauce. (Vegetarian spring rolls, $3.75.) Zen Grill,
9111 W. Olympic Blvd., Beverly Hills, (310) 278-7773.</TE>
<TE>   Crustacean: There are two varieties at this elegant Vietnamese
restaurant. The vegetarian roll is filled with shiitake mushrooms,
shredded cabbage, fried tofu, water chestnuts and carrots. The other
roll ("Asian tapas") has sauteed prawns, shredded green mango,
vermicelli and rau ram (an herb sometimes called Vietnamese basil).
Both come with a sweet bean dipping sauce. (Vegetarian spring roll,
$9.45; Asian tapas, $8.50.) Crustacean, 9646 Santa Monica Blvd.,
Beverly Hills, (310) 205-8990.</TE>
<TE>   Golden Deli: This Vietnamese place has a variety of cold spring
rolls. Some you assemble yourself, such as phan chao tom (shrimp
paste broiled on sugar cane) or phan nem nuong (broiled pork
meatballs), which come with carrots, lettuce Vietnamese herbs and
bean sprouts for rolling up in rice papers. Two others come to the
table already assembled: bi cuon, filled with lettuce and shredded
pork, and goi cuon, with lettuce, pork and shrimp. All rolls come
with a dipping sauce of rice vinegar and slivered ginger. (Phan chao
tom, $6.95; phan nem nuong, $5.25; bi cuon, $2.75; goi cuon, $2.75.)

<TE>   In a new twist on the problem of runaway production, Canadian drug
addicts, hookers and panhandlers are demanding compensation for the
business lost when Hollywood filmmakers take over their streets.</TE>
<TE>   According to Variety, the Vancouver Area Network of Drug Users,
representing about 1,000 inhabitants of a seedy downtown neighborhood
of the city, has sent a letter with their demands to about 30
production companies, including Club Six Productions, which is there
now filming MGM's "Agent Cody Banks," with Frankie Muniz and Angie
Harmon.</TE>
<TE>   "Sex trade workers must be compensated for displacement they
experience at your hands in the same manner you would compensate a
business if you were to use their locale during operating hours," it
read. "The same must hold true for homeless people you push from
beneath a bridge or doorway, and drug users you move from a park."</TE>
<TE>   The Vancouver Sun published an editorial backing the campaign,
which seeks alternative accommodations for displaced people and
compensation for disrupted work.</TE>
<TE>   MGM had no comment.</TE>

<TE>   Petition Criticizes Giving Award to Ashanti</TE>
<TE>   More than 20,000 signatures have been gathered on an Internet
petition criticizing a decision by "Soul Train" to give 21-year-old
R&amp;B newcomer Ashanti its coveted Aretha Franklin Award as entertainer
of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Ashanti, who sold more than 2.3 million copies of her self-titled
debut album, will receive the honor at the eighth annual Soul Train
Lady of Soul Awards at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium on Saturday.
Previous winners include Toni Braxton and Mariah Carey.</TE>
<TE>   "It is an insult to other entertainers who are more deserving of
this award," read the petition, posted on PetitionOnline.com on July
31. "Ashanti simply lacks singing ability and stage presence."</TE>
<TE>   The author? Rommel Zamora, a California high school student who
launched the statement out of boredom, Eonline reports. But when
media outlets got wind of the campaign, the petition took on a life
of its own.</TE>
<TE>   "Soul Train" officials didn't take kindly to the criticism, firing
back with disparaging remarks about Zamora and his supporters on its
Web site.</TE>
<TE>   "This is patriarchal nonsense that offends me more than you can
imagine," Don Cornelius, creator and executive producer of the "Soul
Train" franchise, said in an interview Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "After 30 years in the business, I should be told by a 15-year-old
white kid who should get an award on my show? Anyone who instigated
those ugly and disparaging remarks against Ashanti is fostering
black-on-black hatred. It just happened that a number of people with
modems and computers took the opportunity to jump on."</TE>
<TE>   Ashanti's camp had no comment.</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   'N Sync's Justin Timberlake will give his first solo live
performance at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards on Aug. 29.... Fox's
"American Idol" delivered its largest audience yet on Tuesday, up
roughly 20% from the previous week to just over 15 million
viewers.... "60 Minutes" correspondent Lesley Stahl will also anchor
CBS' "48 Hours Investigates," a revamped version of "48 Hours,"
premiering at 8 p.m. on Sept. 27. Dan Rather, who previously hosted
the news series, will devote more time to the evening news and "60
Minutes II."</TE>

<HD>Just Who Are Those Masked Men?</HD>
<DH>Legions of fans know them as los luchadores, noble Mexican
wrestlers celebrated in film and comics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY ROMMELMANN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the 1973 film "Santo y Blue Demon Contra Dr. Frankenstein," two
masked Mexican wrestlers (Santo and Blue Demon) grapple in the ring,
using a fast, acrobatic and theatrical style of wrestling known as
lucha libre. Afterward, they don sports jackets, and, still in their
masks, dine out with their girlfriends. After a little smooching with
the ladies (still in the masks, always in the masks), they race
muscle cars through the streets, fell some female zombies, free some
kids from a burning orphanage and prevent Dr. Frankenstein from
swapping Santo's brain with the dead Mrs. Frankenstein's. Then they
wrestle some more and go have a cocktail. Or maybe the orphans were
in "Santo Contra Los Zombies."</LD>
<LD>   It doesn't really matter, as the 150-plus films known collectively
as Cine Luchador, made between the 1940s and 1980s and starring the
masked Mexican wrestlers known as los luchadores, hinge on fantasy
and camp, not deep story-lines.</LD>
<TE>   "Cine Luchador is part of a genre called 'churros.' The films are
meant to be sweet, tasty and quickly consumed," says Rita Gonzalez,
Director of Program Development for Latin-American Cinemateca of Los
Angeles (LACLA), which will host a Cine Luchador festival today and
Friday at the Palace Theater. While LACLA's previous events have
tended toward classic Mexican films, Gonzalez says they wanted to
"broaden things a bit" and tap into an appetite for lucha libre
("free fighting") she's seen growing in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   "I started noticing two or three years ago the popularity of
Mexican wrestling with a non-Mexican audience, things like masked
wrestling at clubs in Hollywood," she says. "Cine Luchador taps into
the interests of young subcultures in L.A.; they're really drawn to
the iconic image of the anonymous Mexican superhero." As for the
films themselves, Gonzalez says they have no American equivalent.</TE>
<TE>   "In the '40s, Cine Luchador started out sort of serious and
melodramatic, styled after the downtrodden boxer-solitary sports
figure fighting a personal battle," she says. "But over the years, it
began to cannibalize different genres--horror, sci-fi, whatever was
popular. And the later ones from the '70s get really hallucinatory,
with the luchadores fighting Martians and Nazis and lesbian vampires.
The element of kitsch seems to be international and is appreciated by
everyone."</TE>
<TE>   "Lucha libre has inspired millions of comic books, over a hundred
movies and made national heroes of the wrestlers. And yet when I got
involved in lucha, I couldn't find anything in English," says Keith
Rainville, who since 1996 has published the 'zine From Parts Unknown,
devoted to all things lucha. "Seriously, it only takes one viewing of
eight guys in masks beating the crap out of each other to become
totally hooked."</TE>
<TE>   Live lucha libre matches are always between goods guys (tecnicos)
and bad guys (rudos), and there's never any mistaking who's who. "The
fights are completely partisan; it's always a morality play," says
Rainville. "The good guys come out gleaming, kissing babies, shaking
hands. The bad guys are obvious villains, snarling and riling up the
crowd. The two get in the ring and the good guy always wins. Or if he
doesn't, he wins the next week."</TE>
<TE>   Like Gonzalez, Rainville has noticed a distinct desire for lucha
libre within the local arts community and the subsequent spawning of
new lucha-influenced works, from the sublime--the fourth of Rafael
Navarro's graphic novels about the Chandleresque lucha detective
Sonambulo, "Sleep of the Just," has just been published--to the
silly: This past Saturday, Kids' WB launched the new animated series
"Mucha Lucha!"</TE>
<TE>   The biggest addition to the local lucha scene is Lucha VaVoom, a
live event that takes place Wednesday at the Mayan Theater. Billed as
a "Sexo and Violenca Extravaganza!" the show will feature lucha
legend Mil Mascaras wrestling El Hijo del Santo (son of Santo,
lucha's biggest star who, when he passed away in 1984, was buried in
his mask); burlesque and wrestling by the girls of Velvet Hammer; a
"Mighty Masked Midget Match;" a DJ spinning lucha-centric music;
comic Blaine Capatch, host of Comedy Central's "Beat the Geeks."</TE>
<TE>   "And we arranged with the car club the Misfits to drive the
luchadores to the theater in these fully tricked-out, hydraulic,
flame-throwing lowriders," says Liz Fairbairn, who organized Lucha
VaVoom. A costume designer and former manager for the band GWAR,
Fairbairn has been a lucha fan since two luchadoras (female masked
wrestlers) landed in her lap during a match in Ensenada.</TE>
<TE>   "They're beating on each other, and the entire arena is screaming
at me to hit them back," says Fairbairn. She's sitting in the stands
at Lucha Libre Mexicana, live lucha libre matches that take place on
Sundays in a ring set up behind the Anaheim Marketplace. "Lucha's
been around forever, but underground--with gringos at least," says
Fairbairn, as "Bad to the Bone" blares from a makeshift sound-system,
and eight buff men in varicolored masks and velvet capes and
neon-pink wigs enter the ring and start preening and trash-talking.
"Really, it's the coolest thing I've come across since punk rock."</TE>
<TE>   The crowd of about 100, mostly Latino kids, heckle a white
wrestler with shouts of "bo-li-llo!" ("white bread!"), a skinny one
with "super-flaco!" ("super-skinny!"). The fighters grapple and
grunt, pratfall and catcall, and acrobatically bounce off the ropes.
The crowd cheers its favorites, and when the fights end, mills around
the luchadores for autographs--and to touch the superheroes in the
flesh.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no reason why lucha can't make it in the States," says
Rainville, who believes lucha libre, with its carnival element and
family appeal, is about to give the bad-boy WWE a run for its money.
"When a six-foot muscle man in a gold-and-black costume steps into
the ring and fights an evil green ghost, if that can't turn you back
into a kid, I don't know what can."</TE>

<LD>Lucha libre is solidly about honor, family and tradition, as
evidenced by this article, excepted from the magazine From Parts
Unknown, No. 6.</LD>
<LD>   "Second-and even third-generation stars are commonplace in
tradition-heavy lucha libre.... Two years ago, a weary old man in a
gold-and-red mask labored into a ring in Mexico City absolutely
packed with press and network TV cameras. This was Fray Tormenta, the
wrestling priest. The patron of an orphanage, Brother Storm had fed,
housed and clothed his wards with the money gained from decades in
the ring. He even kept his [mask] on during Mass, something the world
press (including CNN and National Geographic) just could not get
enough of, elevating the priest to folk icon.</LD>
<LD>   When it came time to pass the mantle, he did so on national
television--entering a Mexico City ring, giving an emotional farewell
speech, then letting a close companion unlace his hood. The mask was
then given to a buff young man who was announced to be one of the
many orphans adopted by Fray Tormenta over the years, and he would
now continue the tradition as Fray Tormenta Jr.</LD>
<TE>   Not a dry eye in the place.... "</TE>

<TE>   * New this week: Tsai Ming-Liang has contributed to making
Taiwanese cinema among the most venturesome and challenging in the
world today. In his most recent release, "What Time Is It There?,"
Tsai once again explores urban loneliness and isolation in an austere
and demanding manner, but tempered more than ever before by dark,
absurdist humor and a ray of hope at the finish. A young street
vendor (Lee Kang-Sheng) falls in love with a pretty girl (Chen
Shiang-Chyi) who's off to a lonely Paris sojourn, and the vendor's
mother (Lu Yi-Ching) obsesses over her husband's recent death.
Features a homage to Francois Truffaut that includes an appearance by
"The 400 Blows" star Jean-Pierre Leaud.</TE>

<HD>A 'Godot' That Hears Beckett's Silent Scream</HD>

<LD>Samuel Beckett devotees should relish "Waiting for Godot" at the
Raven Playhouse. Director J. Wienckowski and a youthful cast invest
this silent-movie approach to Beckett's absurdist benchmark with
notable devotion.</LD>
<LD>   An archon of the avant-garde since its 1953 Paris premiere at the
Theatre de Babylone, "Godot" is perhaps the 20th century's most
influential play, seminally affecting Edward Albee and Harold Pinter,
among countless others.</LD>
<LD>   The action concerns vagrants Estragon (Eric Carter, costumed as
Stan Laurel) and Vladimir (Brian Johnson, his Oliver Hardy), who
inhabit a stark allegorical landscape displaying a single symbolist
tree.</LD>
<TE>   Proactive Vladimir struggles to maintain equilibrium, while
Estragon constantly threatens departure, even though the pair's
interdependence is self-evident. They await the title figure, whose
metaphoric implications, like everything else at hand, present vast
analytic fodder for the thesis-minded.</TE>
<TE>   Similar bleak comic obliqueness attends interloping Pozzo (the
Chaplin-garbed Jay P. Africa) and his menial Lucky (Ari Radousky,
morphing Buster Keaton and Harry Langdon). Neither their Act 1
intrusion nor Act 2 return--the domineering Pozzo now blind and Lucky
a catatonic mute--provide explanations, only catalytic conversion.</TE>
<TE>   Synoptically sealing the ideology is Godot's alleged messenger
(Sarah Tarlow, clad as a Dead End Kid), whose hollow assurances lead
to the realization that Godot is never coming, if indeed he even
exists.</TE>
<TE>   Wienckowski reverently observes Beckett's specifics like a
conductor reading a classic score. However, the concept is more
decorative than illuminating, the zaniness and pathos operating
separately and the overly measured wordless passages approaching
somnolence.</TE>
<TE>   Carter devours the asides and slapstick, generally suggesting John
Cusack's manic puppeteer in "Being John Malkovich," especially his
decibel levels.</TE>
<TE>   This upends Johnson's calculated subtlety, with results more
technically impressive than profound or moving.</TE>
<TE>   Africa possesses striking technique and insufficient mileage; the
physically eloquent Radousky's outpouring of sophistry is undercut by
iffy enunciation; and Tarlow is wanly laconic. While the ambitious
effort is admirable, it ultimately seems moored in American College
Theatre Festival territory.</TE>
<TE>   "Waiting for Godot," Raven Playhouse, 5233 N. Lankershim Blvd.,
North Hollywood. Fridays-Sundays, 8 p.m. Ends Sept. 1. $15. (818)
906-8446. Running time: 2 hours, 40 minutes.</TE>

<HD>Strings Attached to the Deal</HD>
<DH>Gerry Anderson was 'bitterly disappointed' when an early
commission required use of puppets. But his innovations in that
medium led to such hits as 'Thunderbirds.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK OLSEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With exotic hide-outs, evil villains, high-tech gadgets and teams of
crime fighters traversing sea, sky and space, the work of Gerry
Anderson has captured the imaginations of audiences around the globe
for nearly 40 years.</LD>
<LD>   In an era of computer-generated imagery, when the line between
reality and gimmickry has become all but indistinguishable, there is
something decidedly homespun and reassuring about the medium for
which Anderson is best known: puppets.</LD>
<LD>   To finish its third Festival of Fantasy, Horror, and Science
Fiction, American Cinematheque will present a tribute to Anderson on
Friday and Sunday. The 72-year-old Englishman will make a rare Los
Angeles appearance, and episodes of his most popular TV programs will
be screened.</LD>
<TE>   Throughout the 1960s and '70s, with shows such as "Captain Scarlet
and the Mysterons," "Supercar," "Fireball XL5" and, most famously,
"Thunderbirds," Anderson combined puppetry, special effects, science
fiction and action-adventure in an intoxicating mixture.</TE>
<TE>   The shows continue to be phenomenally popular in Britain,
Australia and Japan, with a dedicated if somewhat smaller following
in the U.S. and a worldwide community of fans known as "Fandersons."</TE>
<TE>   Eventually creating more than 600 episodes of 17 television
series, Anderson began his career as a sound editor for feature
films. Starting his own production company, he was on the brink of
shutting down when he was saved by a commission to produce a series
of children's shows for British television. There was a catch,
however: The shows had to use puppets.</TE>
<TE>   "I was bitterly disappointed to be working with puppets," Anderson
recalled, speaking recently from his home in London. "But I needed
the money. So I tried to improve the puppet film because I wanted to
say to the industry, 'If I can make puppet films like this, surely I
can do live action very well.' But of course I dug my own grave, as
it were, because the better the puppet film, the more they wanted."</TE>
<TE>   Starting with the show "Supercar" he began to work on a process he
christened "Supermarionation"--a combination of "super," "marionette"
and "animation" meant to invoke the spirit of CinemaScope, something
bigger and better.</TE>
<TE>   Though he also made such live-action shows as "UFO" and "Space:
1999," it is the Supermarionation shows for which he is best known.
Though he may downplay them, they are inevitably more exciting and
oddly more real than his live-action work. At times, the
"performances" of the one-third-scale puppets seem to outpace those
on the shows that feature flesh-and-blood actors.</TE>
<TE>   Likening his role to that of a conductor of a symphony orchestra,
Anderson, often working with his then-wife Sylvia, would create the
concept for a show and write at least its first script, sometimes
also directing the debut episode. He would oversee the design and
creation of the all aspects of a show, including puppets, sets and
special effects.</TE>
<TE>   "The puppet films were extremely difficult to make," he says. "We
would have a crew of upwards of 175 people, and each episode could
cost a million pounds in today's money. When I finally made a live
action show, I thought, 'This is terrific. Working on a full-size
set, with actors who can walk--wow!' "</TE>
<TE>   After twice having to stop shooting because of an actor's
confusion over the use of a prop telephone, Anderson says, "I came to
see it's going to be one set of challenges exchanged for another. So
the short answer is they both had problems."</TE>
<TE>   His shows may have been ostensibly for children, but then as now
they also had a grip on adult audiences. Some of his shows, in
particular "Captain Scarlet," have surprisingly dark themes for
kiddie adventures.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson wrote with both sets of viewers in mind. "The theory I
always had is that some, if not all, children find it most exciting
to stay up and watch an adult show. Children like adult shows. At the
same time, I knew parents watch shows with their children, and if the
stories were terribly twee, it became boring for the adults. So I
started to think, why just make films specifically for children,
let's aim for the entire family.</TE>
<TE>   "I always follow the advice I received while working once with
Lewis Milestone, director of 'All Quiet on the Western Front,' which
was, 'Never try to second-guess your audience. You do what you want
to do, and if the audience likes what you're doing, then you'll be a
success.' And that's what I've done all along the line."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson seems especially proud of the miniature special-effects
work that went into all of his shows, creating surprisingly realistic
explosions, airplanes and spacecraft. He recalls how the team behind
the early James Bond films would scour his programs for ideas and the
time director Stanley Kubrick extended a lunch invitation only to
rescind it once Anderson made it clear he was not interested in
sharing any of his technical secrets.</TE>
<TE>   Though he has not had a show on the air for several years,
Anderson is still quite busy. He is in production on one show for
Japanese television and developing another. He is not involved in the
live-action feature-film version of "Thunderbirds" in development,
but he is working on his own feature version of "Captain Scarlet." He
has done extensive tests for the all-computer-generated imagery
project, which he hopes to get off the ground soon.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to an active Internet fan community and ongoing home video
releases, Anderson's work lives on. There was a time, though, when
the creator of so many beloved shows would rather they all had been
forgotten.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was making these puppet films, I had very little respect
for them," he notes dryly.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to do live action, and I was ashamed of what I was doing
most of the time. But now that they've been so successful, I can't be
that churlish anymore as to run them down. They are something I will
be remembered for, and I'm building a respect for them day by day."</TE>

<TE>   The $1,500 Reservation: At the new Viceroy Hotel in Santa Monica,
Whist restaurant is packed with the young and beautiful sipping their
cocktails. But it's outside that you'll find the real action, in the
six glamorous cabanas that surround the pool. When the striped Roman
shades are folded up, the cabanas are airy and festive, and when
they're down, they're exceedingly private and sexy. The cabanas come
in two sizes, seating 10 or 15, complete with a telephone, heaters,
private waiters ... and an extraordinary price tag: a $1,000/$1,500
minimum for a reservation on a Friday or Saturday night. On Thursday
the minimum drops to $750/$1,200, and it disappears on other nights
(though the restaurant expects parties of at least six). For
reservations, check your credit card limit and call (310) 451-8711.
Special Sugar Plum: On Beverly Boulevard, barely half a block east of
La Brea Boulevard, stands a delicate Art Nouveau facade. No sign
accompanies it yet, but Sugar Plum Bakery will open there later this
month. It's the creation of pastry chef Anna Delorefice (eight years
at Pasticceria Rulli in Marin County, stints down here at Spago
Beverly Hills and Spago Hollywood) and former restaurant manager and
consultant Jenna Turner. (The evolution of their bakery is going to
be featured on NBC's "Life Moments.") Sugar Plum Bakery will be a
European-style place with high-end handmade chocolates as well as
cakes and unusual tarts. "No fondants or butter creams," says
Delorefice, "but lots of fresh meringues, custards and fresh
chocolate. Our cakes are perishable; they're meant to be eaten right
away, not stored in the fridge." With its delicate glass chandeliers,
faded paisley upholstered booths and beautiful woodwork (all done by
Delorefice's father), the place has a very continental feel. This is
the first restaurant designed by production designer Bill Brzeski,
who has worked on a long list of films including "As Good As It Gets"
and "Stuart Little."</TE>
<TE>   A Chef's Tour: Evan Kleiman is a cookbook writer, the host of
KCRW's "The Good Food Show" and the chef-owner of Angeli Caffe. She's
also been an olive oil importer, and recently she's started
collecting seeds of unusual vegetables in Italy and giving them to
California farmers. Every fall, she takes a group of Angelenos to
Italy to teach them rustic Italian cooking morning, noon and night.
On top of everything else, every Thursday throughout the year Angeli
Caffe has an international dinner (one seating only, 7 p.m.,
reservations necessary). "I like to discover cultures through their
cuisine," says Kleiman, "so I take nine recipes from books I love,
that I've discussed on the show, and they become the foundation for
the ethnic meal. I pick all the food at the farmers market, and then
I spend the day cooking. It's invigorating for the restaurant and for
me. People sit together who have never met one another, people of all
ages, it has become a real meeting place." On any given Thursday you
might dine on food of the Balkans, Iran, Spain, Greece, the republic
of Georgia or south India.</TE>

<TE>   A Day at the Races: The chef at Arterra, Bradley Ogden's
8-month-old restaurant at the Marriott Del Mar, is Carl Schroeder,
who spent three years as sous chef at the Lark Creek Inn, Ogden's
celebrated Bay Area American restaurant. "I was fresh out of culinary
school," says Schroeder, "having apprenticed at Aqua in San
Francisco. I was just beginning to develop my own style and obviously
was heavily influenced by Bradley, though I have a very different way
of plating and my quantities are a little smaller. I'd say he's a bit
more rustic, or maybe I'm a little more refined." Sample appetizer:
Chino Farm fig salad with a blue cheese souffle, brandied cherries
and honey-glazed walnuts. (Conveniently for Schroeder, the famous
Chino Farms is just a mile away.) Sample entree: grilled trolled king
salmon with baby artichokes, andouille sausage, crispy calamari and
shellfish essence. Arterra also offers a four-course prix-fixe "Win,
Place, Show" dinner during the racing season (now in full swing) for
$80 including wines. There's a shuttle between the Marriott and Del
Mar racetrack every half hour from the first to the last race. This
way you can fit in the races, a magnificent view of the surf and a
memorable dining experience all in one day. For more information call
(858) 369-6032.</TE>
<TE>   Small Bites: Chadwick, now celebrating its second anniversary, is
opening its garden patio for merenda from 4 to 7 p.m. Wednesday
through Friday. It's a time for summer cocktails (blackberry
cosmopolitan, cantaloupe martini), organic teas and elixirs. There'll
also be a sampling of tapas such as marinated olives, roasted
piquillo peppers or chickpeas and roasted eggplant on toast
....Crustacean will be serving low-fat specials through Sept. 20. Two
examples: shaved dry scallop over fried rice with egg white and
ginger essence, Hue summer roll filled with grilled lemongrass beef
and served with sesame bean sauce.</TE>

<LD>The American Cinematheque's Alternative Screen showcase at the
Egyptian presents tonight at 7:30 George Ratliff's "Hell House,"
which documents how the Trinity Assembly of God Pentecostal Church in
Dallas has turned Halloween into an opportunity to terrify teens onto
the path of righteousness. This is an authentic slice of Americana, a
sometimes unintentionally amusing but overall disturbing conflation
of primitive hellfire-and-damnation religious convictions and
up-to-the minute technology.</LD>
<TE>   Trinity Assembly, which also has its own school, devotes
considerable time and resources into building a large, substantial
compound that is a grim parody of the old boardwalk fun house. Teens
and some older types sit in bleachers to watch a series of Grand
Guignol tableaux illustrating the horrors of bleeding to death from a
botched abortion; dying from AIDS; taking drugs at a rave and ending
up raped and suicidal; and being mowed down by a drunk driver. (The
year before, Hell House re-staged the Columbine massacre.) The
vignettes are staged like Victorian melodramas, but the settings,
props and special effects are worthy of Hollywood and have a lurid,
virtual reality aura. (It's impossible not to speculate about what's
really going on inside those performers who play baddies and their
victims with such fervor.) In its first decade, Hell House, which was
started in 1990, has attracted a reported 75,000 attendees and 15,000
converts or recommitments to Christianity.</TE>
<TE>   There's something to be said for a church making a bold, all-out
attack on issues that endanger teens and many others everywhere. It's
the extremely narrow and simplistic approach to the problems, steeped
as it is in anti-abortion and homophobic attitudes for starters,
that's scary. Indeed, the entire undertaking operates on fear: It's
either take Jesus Christ as your personal savior or burn in hell. At
the end of the Hell House performance, a church member assures those
exiting through a foyer that what they've just witnessed isn't meant
as a scare tactic--and then gives them six seconds to decide whether
to proceed through a certain door. Those who go through it have made
the leap of faith toward salvation; those who hesitate remain among
what the church regards as the "walking dead."</TE>
<TE>   Ratliff has been shrewd enough to win the church's trust,
honorable enough not to betray it, and smart enough to trust in the
power of his material without editorializing. The Egyptian is at 6712
Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood. (323) 466-FILM.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   While the horrors of Hell House are fake, the challenges facing
the sheltered young people of Lucy Walker's eye-opening "Devil's
Playground" (Sunset 5 in West Hollywood, Saturday and Sunday at 10
a.m.) are all too real. It is surely not widely known that when Amish
children turn 16, they enter a six-year period of life called
"Rumspringa," or "Running Around." Until they reach that age, they
remain in a strict, religious world virtually devoid of modern
conveniences--no electricity, no cars, no movies, not even
buttons--and they wear the severe uniform clothing of their
300-year-old community.</TE>
<TE>   At 16, they are free to enter the outside world until they decide
whether they want to return and join the church and community for
life, committing themselves to the austere existence in which they
have been raised. Is it any wonder that some go wild like the
proverbial preacher's kid, especially in today's dangerously
temptation-laden world?</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the most striking of the several young people Walker
tracks for two years with such unobtrusiveness, depth and perception
is a preacher's son, Faron Yoder, whose real-life teen odyssey is the
stuff of fictional movies. He has at 18 moved from his home in an
Indiana Amish community to a nearby trailer with another Amish youth,
Gerald Yutzy, and they work in a trailer factory. Gerald is content
with the novelty of having "500 channels of DirecTV, a stereo,
Nintendo and a fridge full of beer." Faron, however, is using and
dealing crack, and faces the choice of ratting on his suppliers or
receiving a possible 25-year prison sentence.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Velda Bontrager, now 23, had returned home and was
making her wedding dress when she came to realize that the freedom
and choice she had enjoyed during her Rumspringa had put her off the
Amish way. Even though her fiance was unable to follow her to the
outside world, she went ahead and faced the traditional shunning by
family and friends so that she could try to live a fuller life--and
even dream of the impossible: going to college (schooling stops for
Amish kids at the eighth grade in the belief that further education
breeds pride). Both Faron and Velda are clearly more intelligent and
capable of independent thought than their friends. Indeed, Faron is
notably articulate and well-spoken, while most of his contemporaries
routinely use double negatives and have limited vocabularies.</TE>

<TE>   The second offering in the Laemmle Theaters' Documentary Days
series, "Devil's Playground," screens at 11 a.m. Aug. 31 through
Sept. 2 at the Monica 4-Plex, Santa Monica, (310) 394-9741; Sept. 7-8

<TE>   Among the films screening at the Egyptian in the final week of the
American Cinematheque's third annual Festival of Fantasy, Horror &amp;
Science Fiction is the fairly obscure 1969 picture "The Mind of Mr.
Soames" (Sunday at 4 p.m.). It is of primary interest for the
excellent performance in the title role by Terence Stamp, whose
career has enjoyed a steady resurgence since "The Adventures of
Priscilla, Queen of the Desert" (1994), in which he played a fearless
transsexual. This Columbia production is a good, offbeat,
well-directed (by Alan Cooke) British science-fiction film that might
have been even better had its basic premise been carried through with
more imagination. Stamp's Soames is a man who is "born" at the age of
30. Fed intravenously and massaged regularly to keep his muscles from
atrophying, he is at last released from his lifelong coma by the
wizardry of American brain surgeon Robert Vaughn. With his boyish,
even angelic face, Stamp is perfectly cast and altogether convincing.</TE>
<TE>   So effective is Stamp at portraying all that pertains to Soames'
discovery of self and others at such an advanced age that it's
unfortunate the filmmakers settled for drawing its dramatic conflict
from a contrived-seeming clash between Vaughn and Nigel Davenport,
who plays the hard-nosed head of the institute where Soames is kept.
"The Mind of Mr. Soames" will be presented with a new 35-millimeter
print. Its producer, Max Rosenberg, will discuss the film after the
screening.</TE>

<TE>   The Los Angeles County Museum of Art is presenting this weekend
two of the greatest films of Kenji Mizoguchi, a giant of classic
Japanese cinema. Screening Friday at 7:30 p.m. is his exquisite, 16th
century ghost story, "Ugetsu" (1953), in which a humble potter
(Masayuki Mori) is captivated by the beautiful but spectral Machiko
Kyo. The potter's wife is played by Kinuyo Tanaka, who stars in the
title role of "The Life of Oharu" (1952). (323) 857-6010.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   To mark the 76th anniversary of the death of Rudolph Valentino,
the Silent Movie Theatre is presenting one of his best movies, "Blood
and Sand" (1922), directed by "Ben-Hur's" Fred Niblo. "Blood and
Sand" screens Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 1 and 4
p.m. at the theater, 611 N. Fairfax Ave., L.A. (323) 655-2520.</TE>

<LD>In Afghanistan today, the Taliban has been vanquished, with scattered
bands of defeated Al Qaeda soldiers either retreating into the
mountainous north or escaping across the border into neighboring
countries.</LD>
<LD>   But in the vacuum of power that has resulted, another enemy has
literally risen from the rocky soil to seek its own grip on the
region: poppies planted to feed the always-ravenous opium industry.</LD>
<LD>   United Nations and Afghan officials estimate that since the Sept.
11 attacks on the U.S., such planting in the country has doubled.
They say that up to half the civilians living in the fertile areas
near Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan are involved in some aspect of the
drug trade.</LD>
<TE>   At 8 tonight on KCET, the PBS series "Wide Angle" takes viewers
into those fields while exploring how the crushing poverty of a
country devastated by a quarter-century of war created the ideal
conditions for the opium industry to take root.</TE>
<TE>   The episode, "Bitter Harvest," has an air of futility as it lays
out the difficulties in fighting the drug lords: terrain too rugged
for fences; roadside guards with hand-held X-ray machines but no
electricity to run them; poor neighboring countries still struggling
with post-Soviet independence.</TE>
<TE>   And yet the war goes on.</TE>

<HD>Extras Galore on Tarantino Triple Bill</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Quentin Tarantino has this annoying habit on the collector's edition
DVDs of his films "Pulp Fiction" and "Jackie Brown" (Miramax, $30
each) not to look into the camera when he is addressing the audience.
The filmmaker tends to glance over to screen right as he introduces
various features on the discs. It really gets on one's nerves. You
feel like telling him, "Quentin, please look at me when you talk to
me."</LD>
<LD>   Despite his problems with eye contact, the discs of the
Oscar-winning 1994 film noir "Pulp Fiction" and "Jackie Brown," his
1997 adaptation of Elmore Leonard's crime novel "Rum Punch," are
enjoyable. However, both digital editions suffer from the fact that
there is no commentary track from Tarantino.</LD>
<LD>   The "Pulp Fiction" disc includes five deleted scenes with
Tarantino's introductions--this feature was produced for the
laserdisc--including a rather lengthy extension of the "Jack Rabbit
Slim" scene between John Travolta and Uma Thurman.</LD>
<TE>   Also on the DVD: featurettes on the film's sets, production
designs and props; filmmaker interviews; an episode of Siskel &amp;
Ebert's "At the Movies" titled "The Tarantino Generation"; Michael
Moore interviewing Tarantino, producer Lawrence Bender and star
Samuel L. Jackson at the Independent Spirit Awards in 1995; the Palme
d'Or Award ceremony at the Cannes Film Festival; an original
documentary titled "Tarantino Fiction"; and an installment of PBS'
"Charlie Rose" show with Tarantino.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD-ROM features are fun. They include an expansive trivia
game, reviews and articles, a nifty enhanced trivia track and the
option to read the screenplay as you watch the film.</TE>
<TE>   The two-disc set of "Jackie Brown," which stars Pam Grier,
Oscar-nominated Robert Forster, Robert De Niro, Bridget Fonda,
Michael Keaton and Samuel L. Jackson, features the same DVD-ROM
features. There's a compelling documentary that looks at how
Tarantino went from a video store clerk to a moviemaker; an interview
with Tarantino about the origins of the "Jackie Brown" project; the
full-length version of the "Chicks With Guns" video that Jackson's
gun-runner character shows to clients in the film; a review of the
film by Siskel &amp; Ebert; and clips from the "Jackie Brown" promotional
contest from MTV.</TE>
<TE>   Rounding out the collector's edition are six deleted and alternate
scenes, all introduced by Tarantino, including a sequence in which
Jackson discusses the Cockatoo Lounge with De Niro.</TE>
<TE>   But the Tarantino fun doesn't stop. On Tuesday, Artisan releases
the delicious two-disc 10th anniversary DVD set of the director's
first film, the audacious "Reservoir Dogs" ($27). Though the set
isn't as slickly produced as the Miramax collection, it's scrappy,
clever and has a good sense of humor about itself.</TE>
<TE>   The set features the wide-screen and full-screen versions of the
violent film noir about a group of seasoned criminals who come
together to pull a diamond heist and know each other only by
color-coded aliases--Mr. Orange, Mr. Pink, Mr. Brown. In fact, the
collector's edition is offered in five limited collectible covers
based on each color-coded character.</TE>
<TE>   The disc features all-new and rather wacky interviews with
Tarantino (who again doesn't look at the camera but at least focuses
on the person interviewing him), producer Lawrence Bender and actors
Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Eddie Bunker and Eric Baltz; a "Film Noir
Web," which examines the writers and directors of the genre with an
introduction by Tarantino; a look at nine filmmakers who influenced
Tarantino (he admits that he doesn't admire some of them now);
"Reservoir Dolls," a spoof of the infamous ear slashing scene enacted
by the action figures; a hysterically funny tribute to the late actor
Lawrence Tierney, who plays the mastermind in the movie; and terrific
audio commentary with Tarantino, several members of the cast, crew
and even critics.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Mel Gibson Vietnam War drama "We Were Soldiers" (Paramount,
$30) isn't for the faint of heart or weak of stomach. There is plenty
of searing, graphic war violence in the story of the first engagement
of American soldiers with the North Vietnamese in November 1965. U.S.
troops, which numbered about 400, spent three days in a horrific
encounter with more than 4,000 Viet Cong. Written and directed by
Randall Wallace, the film is based on the book by retired Lt. Col.
Harold Moore and journalist Joseph Galloway.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD features 10 deleted scenes, with commentary from Wallace;
a better-than-average documentary (which features interviews with the
real Moore, Gibson and Wallace); and heartfelt commentary from
Wallace.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After a long absence from the big screen, director Peter
Bogdanovich returned to feature films this year with "The Cat's Meow"
(Lions Gate, $25), an uneven but generally entertaining whodunit that
offers one theory behind the death of famed silent-film pioneer
Thomas Ince during a weekend excursion in 1924 aboard William
Randolph Hearst's private yacht. Kirsten Dunst steals the movie as
Hearst's mistress, Marion Davies; Eddie Izzard is a bit too roly-poly
as Charlie Chaplin; Edward Herrmann plays Hearst as a lovesick puppy;
and Cary Elwes is slimy perfection as Ince .</TE>
<TE>   The DVD has a nice batch of extra goodies including interviews
with the cast, Bogdanovich and screenwriter Steven Peros; a Chaplin
short; a newsreel from the 1920s; and commentary from the director.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Joe Somebody" is a limp noodle of a comedy-drama that wastes Tim
Allen as a nebbish divorced father who decides to become a "somebody"
after a brutish co-worker beats him up in the office parking lot. The
DVD (Fox, $27) has far more extras than it needs: a commentary track
with director John Pasquin and producer Brian Reilly; a gag reel; a
"making of" featurette; the trailer; a look at the martial arts
choreography used in the film; and five deleted scenes with director
commentary.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Return to Neverland" (Disney, $24 for VHS; $30 for DVD) is a
disappointing sequel to "Peter Pan." In this charmless adventure,
Peter brings out the inner child in Wendy's daughter Jane, a young
girl who doesn't believe in "faith, trust and pixie dust." The DVD
features a music video, a game for the kids, two deleted scenes and a
storybook read-along.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The great screenwriter Ben Hecht ("The Front Page") wrote and
directed "Angels Over Broadway" (Columbia TriStar, $30), an offbeat
but charming 1940 comedy-drama about three losers who redeem
themselves while preventing a man from committing suicide. Douglas
Fairbanks Jr. gives one of his best performances as a
bellboy-turned-hustler; Rita Hayworth is sweet as a dancer desperate
for her big break; and Thomas Mitchell is wonderful as a boozy
playwright on the skids. Beautifully photographed by Lee Garmes, who
is also listed as a co-director.</TE>

<HD>Focus on the Masters Finally Has a Place It Can Call Home</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEF WOODARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For several years now, Focus on the Masters has put energy and
resources into the care and feeding of Ventura County's artistic
community.</LD>
<LD>   Photographer Donna Granata, who started the project to create
portraits of artists in the area, launched a series of artist
lectures at the Laurel Theater and otherwise built a framework for
focusing on the region's art scene. Documenting and archiving the
cultural legacy of a community is the goal.</LD>
<LD>   As of this month, Focus on the Masters has an actual address that
serves as a public exhibition showcase and headquarters on East Main
Street in Ventura. On a recent afternoon, the place was buzzing with
activity as volunteers helped bolster databases.</LD>
<TE>   Granata took a visitor on a tour of the facility, which includes a
library, a vault for archives, offices, and a space to be used for
classes this fall. After running the expanding artistic resource
project from her house for eight years, Granata seems thrilled to
have an office-gallery to support the effort.</TE>
<TE>   The center of attention, though, is an inaugural exhibition of art
scattered throughout, seizing available wall space. Granata's
crystalline color portraits of artists are placed with the artist's
own work, drawing a short, straight line between art and artist.</TE>
<TE>   The art-artist dynamic is often strongest in the case of sculptors
and their works, as with a recent photograph of Joanne Duby, seen
through the apertures in one of her sinuously folding stone
sculptures. Famed ceramist Otto Heino's portrait hangs in front of a
table full of his wares, and a photo of mythically minded metal
sculptor Ted Gall, taken in 2000, is flanked by one of his rough,
welded creations.</TE>
<TE>   Of keen interest in this exhibition is the art of Carol Rosenak, a
veteran of the local art community who died recently. Her delicate
watercolors, such as "Hummingbird Series," are included in this show,
as is one of her last works, "Hummingbird, Heart and Two Chairs."
Poignancy underscores the rougher imagery and blocks of colors in
this piece, created through sheer will after a series of strokes had
left her nearly blind.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the better-known of Granata's subjects have passed on,
including photojournalist Horace Bristol (whose work raises a classic
question: At what point does photography shift from reportage to
art?). Next to Granata's 1996 portrait of Bristol, who lived in Ojai
for many years before his death, are two images from his
Depression-era documentary work, rugged images of Ma and Tom Joad
that went on to inspire John Steinbeck's--and Hollywood's--"The
Grapes of Wrath."</TE>

<HD>Tough Stance Toward Airlines</HD>
<DH>Transportation: The U.S. panel created to help carriers in
rough times is forcing companies to revamp or risk collapse.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Congress created an agency to facilitate loans to the
shellshocked airlines after the terrorist attacks, critics decried
the move as letting Uncle Sam not only select which carriers would
survive but also re-engineer the structure of the U.S. air travel
system.</LD>
<LD>   At worst, opponents said the Air Transportation Stabilization
Board could perpetuate the status quo in the industry, keeping the
loss-plagued business on life support by doling out loan guarantees
to industry giants that have high labor-cost agreements and
inefficient operating systems.</LD>
<LD>   But the Air Transportation Stabilization Board has surprised
critics by mostly forcing the airlines themselves to dramatically
reshape how they do business. The panel is being extremely cautious
in providing government-backed aid to those airlines that have
requested it, leaving the carriers to fly right on their own or risk
collapse.</LD>
<TE>   The ATSB, "whether they like it or not, is certainly shaping the
way the industry evolves," said Tom Hansson, who heads the U.S.
airline practice for consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton.</TE>
<TE>   The changes might eventually strengthen the airlines, although at
the cost of making air travel more expensive and less convenient for
passengers. There could be fewer flights, longer waits at airports,
modestly higher fares, fewer first-class seats and more restrictions
on frequent-flier miles, some analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "In the short run it's going to be painful for U.S. travelers,"
said Meg VanDeWeghe, a former managing director at J.P. Morgan Chase
and now an executive-in-residence at the University of Maryland's
business school. "But in the long run we'll see a stronger industry.
They're going to be forced to focus on profitability and efficiency."</TE>
<TE>   The biggest issue now before the ATSB is UAL Corp.'s United
Airlines, one of only three major airlines that sought a loan
guarantee before the deadline June 28. But the board refused to rush
a requested $1.8-billion guarantee to United because the airline
hasn't made the kind of deep cost cuts that the board demands.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, United last week announced that it was teetering
toward Bankruptcy Court unless it gets the employee wage cuts and
other concessions it needs within 30 days.</TE>
<TE>   United's announcement last week was just one event in the most
tumultuous week for the airlines since the terrorist attacks, with US
Airways filing for bankruptcy protection and industry leader American
Airlines, a unit of AMR Corp., unveiling a massive cutback in flight
schedules and employees.</TE>
<TE>   Continental Airlines joined the parade Tuesday, saying it would
ground jets, sharply reduce its available seats and charge low-fare
customers for certain services to slash $350 million a year from its
operating costs. The Houston-based carrier said it hoped to avoid
layoffs through a hiring freeze and attrition.</TE>
<TE>   Continental's brash chairman, Gordon Bethune, noted the problems
at United, American and US Airways and said in a statement that his
airline needs "some aggressive belt-tightening so we don't end up
like them."</TE>
<TE>   The airlines are grappling with a travel slump that has persisted
much longer than industry executives expected, which is keeping a lid
on fares--and the airlines' incomes--while airline operating costs
remain stubbornly high. The result has been massive financial losses
among the major carriers--$7 billion last year and $3 billion to $5
billion this year.</TE>
<TE>   But as it has from the outset, the ATSB is taking a hard line
toward those carriers asking for loan guarantees, demanding they
first provide a business model that assures repayment of the loans
without putting U.S. taxpayers at risk.</TE>
<TE>   The loan-guarantee program was part of a hastily approved
$15-billion airline-bailout package approved by Congress after Sept.
11. The first $5 billion was sent directly to individual airlines as
cash grants to help them recover from the two-day shutdown of
civilian air travel after the attacks and the severe drop in
passenger traffic.</TE>
<TE>   The rest is in loan guarantees, so that the airlines can tap the
capital markets for financing, with lenders and investors knowing the
U.S. government stands behind the loans in case of default. The ATSB
was created to judge applications for guarantees and was given wide
discretion for setting the criteria.</TE>
<TE>   The ATSB granted only one guarantee, to America West, a unit of
America West Holdings Corp., and only after the Phoenix-based airline
made steep concessions that included giving Uncle Sam the right to
buy a 33% stake in the airline. Several other requests from smaller
carriers--including Vanguard Airlines, National Airlines and Spirit
Airlines--were denied.</TE>
<TE>   The ATSB's rigid stance comes despite strong political clout
behind the airlines seeking help. More than 100 members of Congress
signed a petition supporting United's initial application. But the
three voting members of the ATSB board include two appointees of the
Bush administration, which objected to the loan-guarantee idea in the
first place on grounds it would mean too much government interference
in the airline business.</TE>
<TE>   The three members are:</TE>
<TE>   * Peter R. Fisher, Treasury undersecretary for domestic finance.</TE>
<TE>   * Edward M. Gramlich, 63, one of the seven governors of the
Federal Reserve Board.</TE>
<TE>   * Kirk Van Tine, 53, general counsel of the Transportation
Department.</TE>
<TE>   Fisher and Gramlich are the designees of Treasury Secretary Paul
H. O'Neill and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, respectively,
both of whom voiced reservations about the loan program when it was
being debated nearly a year ago. The Bush administration pointedly
left out the guarantees from its initial proposal to help the
airlines, but Congress prevailed and had them included.</TE>
<TE>   The board is "putting pressure on these airlines to clean up their
act, by dangling this carrot out there in the form of loan
guarantees," said Howard Seife, head of the bankruptcy practice at
law firm Chadbourne &amp; Parke in New York. "But they're using that
carrot very judiciously. They have enormous power and influence,
there's no doubt about it."</TE>
<TE>   Which is just what some industry observers want. With nearly
everyone agreeing that the airline business needs to be restructured,
some are calling on the ATSB to stay out of it, and let the industry
and the Bankruptcy Court sort out the mess. "I don't see a problem
with" the ATSB rejecting United's bid, said VanDeWeghe of the
University of Maryland. "If they deny the help, they're allowing
market forces to cause United to do what it should be doing," which
is restructuring on its own, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Many of United's competitors, such as Continental, also oppose the
ATSB's involvement because they worry that the government's help will
give United an unfair advantage.</TE>
<TE>   The ATSB would say only that it "looks forward to reviewing United
Airlines' revised application, which it will carefully evaluate based
on the statute and the governing regulations" under the bailout
program.</TE>
<TE>   US Airways filed for bankruptcy reorganization last week while its
own request for a $900-million loan guarantee is pending. But US
Airways already has concessions from most of its employee groups, and
the ATSB has indicated it will grant the carrier's loan guarantee.</TE>
<TE>   Treasury Secretary O'Neill said United is one of several airlines
with unsustainably high labor costs, a problem the carriers would
have to work out for themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of the airlines have compensation levels that they can't
support with the revenues they're generating. Only they can deal with
that issue," O'Neill said last week. "That's a problem at United,
which they know."</TE>
<TE>   And he reiterated that the ATSB was not created to make hand-outs.</TE>
<TE>   "The law gave us parameters for how to decide about who should get
a loan guarantee," O'Neill said. "It didn't say, 'Give everybody who
comes down the chute a guarantee.' "</TE>

<LD>   AOL Time Warner will pay $3.6 billion in cash and stock to AT&amp;T
and get 100% ownership of  HBO and Warner Bros. film studios, plus a
controlling stake in the new cable company, to be called Time Warner
Cable Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Time Warner Cable, the nation's second-biggest cable operator with
10.8 million subscribers, plans to go public with an initial stock
offering, perhaps as early as next year.</LD>
<TE>   The deal, expected to close in early 2003, simplifies AOL Time
Warner's bewildering financial structure, positions it to buy more
cable TV properties while prices are down and gives its troubled
America Online unit a long-sought means of offering high-speed
Internet connections to millions more customers on AT&amp;T's cable TV
network.</TE>
<TE>   AT&amp;T will get $2.1 billion in cash, $1.5 billion worth of AOL Time
Warner stock and a 21% stake in Time Warner Cable, all of which will
be inherited by Comcast Corp. when its purchase of AT&amp;T's cable
business closes this year.</TE>
<TE>   The deal provides Comcast with quick cash to help pay down the
heavy debt it will incur in the purchase of AT&amp;T's cable operation, a
key concern for investors.</TE>
<TE>   AT&amp;T Comcast is expected to sell its stake in Time Warner Cable
after the public offering. With more than 20 million customers, AT&amp;T
Comcast by far will be the nation's largest cable-TV operator and
probably would attract antitrust scrutiny if it held onto the Time
Warner Cable shares.</TE>
<TE>   Because of Comcast's interest, its president, Brian L. Roberts,
was involved in the negotiations, along with AOL Time Warner Chief
Executive Richard D. Parsons and AT&amp;T Chairman C. Michael Armstrong.</TE>
<TE>   Parsons said in a conference call Wednesday that the agreement
makes AOL Time Warner a "far more transparent, easy-to-understand
company," while protecting its balance sheet from excessive debt.</TE>
<TE>   Credit-rating firm Standard &amp; Poor's on Wednesday placed AOL Time
Warner's bonds under review for a possible downgrade, but Standard &amp;
Poor's analyst Heather M. Goodchild said the AT&amp;T agreement actually
was more favorable to AOL Time Warner than she expected.</TE>
<TE>   There was speculation in recent weeks that AT&amp;T and Comcast would
hold out for much more cash, which likely would have pushed AOL Time
Warner's credit rating into the "junk-bond" range. As it is, the
$2.1-billion cash component will have to be borrowed, but Parsons
said it would be repaid immediately when the new cable company goes
public.</TE>
<TE>   Investors were cheered by the long-awaited agreement.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner rose 97 cents Wednesday to $14.33 on the New York
Stock Exchange, its sixth straight daily gain. The stock, however, is
down 55% year to date. AT&amp;T shares gained $1 to $12.18 on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   Time Warner Cable will debut as a relatively low-debt player in a
heavily leveraged cable industry, which should give it lots of clout
as a potential buyer, said analyst Jessica Reif Cohen of Merrill
Lynch.</TE>
<TE>   Cable TV stocks, downtrodden all year, jumped Wednesday. Comcast
leaped $3.32 to $25.08 on the Nasdaq Stock Market; Cox Communications
Inc. gained $2.26 to $25.65 on the NYSE, and Cablevision Systems
Corp. rose $1.83 to $9.65 on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   For AOL Time Warner, the most important part of the deal may be a
three-year carriage agreement granting America Online access to
AT&amp;T's cable system, which has the nation's biggest network of
high-speed Internet customers.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, high-speed Internet service has been available to AOL
customers only through AOL Time Warner's own cable TV properties.</TE>
<TE>   Within four months of the deal's closing, AOL will get access to
up to 5 million customers of AT&amp;T Comcast--as the post-merger company
will be known--in the Boston, Seattle, Indianapolis and Nashville
areas. In the second year, AOL will be offered to another 5 million
AT&amp;T Comcast homes.</TE>
<TE>   In the third year, at the option of both parties, AOL would get
access to another 9 million homes.</TE>
<TE>   Parsons, citing competitive concerns, declined to provide the
terms of the carriage deal, but the Wall Street Journal said AOL
would pay AT&amp;T Comcast a stiff monthly fee of $35 to $40 per
customer. AOL would charge its customers $54.95 a month for the
service, Parsons said.</TE>
<TE>   A high access fee would, of course, limit the profitability of
broadband service, but analysts said it was even more crucial for AOL
to make progress on rolling out the high-speed service. Subscriber
growth for AOL's current dial-up Internet service has slowed sharply
in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   The deal with AT&amp;T Comcast should lead to other AOL Internet
service deals with other cable companies, Parsons said, adding that
"the industry has always followed a strong leader."</TE>
<TE>   "It followed John Malone when he was the fat kid in the boat, and
now it's Brian Roberts."</TE>
<TE>   Malone, a cable pioneer, is chairman of Liberty Media Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Time Warner created Time Warner Entertainment in 1992 in
partnership with two Japanese companies, and AT&amp;T acquired its 27%
stake two years ago through its acquisition of the cable TV firm
Mediaone Group.</TE>
<TE>   Both AOL Time Warner and AT&amp;T had long hoped to end the awkward
arrangement, but negotiations never reached fruition under former AOL
Time Warner Chief Executive Gerald M. Levin.</TE>
<TE>   "It probably needed a change of personalities to get things
moving," said Morris Mark, president of Mark Asset Management in New
York, which held about 1.5 million AOL Time Warner shares and 1
million Comcast shares as of June 30.</TE>
<TE>   Mark praised Parsons for following through on one goal he set when
he took over the helm at AOL Time Warner in May. "In a tough
environment, he is delivering on what he said he'd do," Mark said.</TE>

<HD>Feinstein Asks MWD to Kill Mojave Project</HD>
<DH>Water: Request by senator, citing costs and environmental
concerns, comes as U.S. appears set to issue final permits for Cadiz
storage program.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL A. HILTZIK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In what could be the most damaging blow yet to the controversial
Cadiz water storage program, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) on
Wednesday called on the Metropolitan Water District of Southern
California to vote down the $150-million proposal as unnecessary and
a potential environmental threat to the Mojave Desert.</LD>
<LD>   "I have come to the conclusion that the project may adversely
affect the future of the California desert and should not be allowed
to proceed at this time," Feinstein wrote to MWD Chairman Philip J.
Pace and the rest of the MWD board. "To allow it to move ahead would
be a terrible mistake."</LD>
<LD>   The Cadiz program, proposed in 1997, has become the signature
project of Keith Brackpool, an entrepreneur who has been a generous
financial backer of Gov. Gray Davis and one of Davis' trusted
advisors on water policy. Brackpool's company, Cadiz Inc., which
would be MWD's partner in the project, has borrowed heavily on the
expectation that the project would have been approved earlier this
year.</LD>
<TE>   Feinstein's letter came amid indications that the Interior
Department is poised to issue, over her objections, the final federal
environmental permits needed for the project to go forward.</TE>
<TE>   But MWD sources say the board may be nearing a decision to place
the project on hold anyway, in part over doubts that sufficient
surplus water will be available from the Colorado River to fill the
storage site. District officials said Wednesday, however, that Pace
and several other board members were out of town and that most had
not yet seen Feinstein's letter.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement from its Santa Monica offices, Cadiz said it was
gratified to learn that issuance of the long-awaited permits was
imminent. Once that happens, Cadiz said, "the project will have
received sign-off from all federal agencies."</TE>
<TE>   Because the state faces strong pressure to curtail its dependence
on Colorado River surplus, the statement continued, "California can
not afford to lose projects that have been through five years of
environmental review, public hearings, and have received support from
all federal agencies."</TE>
<TE>   The project is designed to store as much as 1.5 million acre-feet
of surplus Colorado River water in the sand under a Mojave Desert
parcel owned by Cadiz.</TE>
<TE>   Under tentative terms negotiated in 2001, Cadiz and the MWD would
split the project's capital costs, which include the expense of
building a 35-mile desert pipeline connecting the MWD's Colorado
River Aqueduct and the Cadiz tract. The MWD estimates that Cadiz
could earn more than $500 million in revenue from the project.</TE>
<TE>   In the last few months, Feinstein has emerged as one of the
project's most vociferous opponents, largely because of concerns that
exploiting the aquifer could damage the ecosystem of the Mojave
National Preserve, which lies nearby. In her letter Wednesday, she
also raised several other objections to the program. These include
"serious financial concerns" and the availability of alternative
storage programs, some of which "are more cost-effective for MWD."</TE>
<TE>   "In my view, this raises the question: 'Why proceed with Cadiz
when it isn't necessary and when it may very well result in serious
adverse impacts to California's pristine desert?' " she wrote. "It
does not make sense to siphon off water from this critical area of
the California desert to send to the MWD when the region has other
options for water and when the aquifer is vital to the health of the
desert and its animal and plant life."</TE>
<TE>   Feinstein's opposition is the latest in a series of recent
potholes for the project. MWD board members have questioned the
financial arrangements that would tie the water district to Cadiz, a
publicly traded firm that has never turned a profit and is deeply in
debt.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, an effort by Cadiz to pay off some of its debt
by merging its agricultural operations with those of a wealthy Saudi
prince has fallen through. No alternative recapitalization plan has
been announced. This month, the company said Brackpool, its chairman
and chief executive, and Dwight Makins, its former chairman, were net
sellers of Cadiz shares during July, when the stock lost about half
its value.</TE>
<TE>   Before news of Feinstein's letter was widely spread, Cadiz shares
fell 6 cents to $4.45 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>OK Still Expected on Golden State Deal</HD>
<DH>Mergers: Revelation of May offer by Sallie Mae for Cal Fed
parent might irk shareholders but not stop Citigroup takeover.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORA VRANA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The last-minute disclosure that there was another potential suitor
for Golden State Bancorp isn't likely to derail the company's
takeover by Citigroup Inc., but it has raised questions about whether
Golden State's investors were properly informed of their options.</LD>
<LD>   Shareholders of Golden State, the San Francisco parent of savings
and loan California Federal Bank, are expected today to approve an
acquisition by Citigroup, despite news reports Wednesday that student
loan firm Sallie Mae had tentatively offered to buy the firm in May.</LD>
<LD>   Sallie Mae's informal bid for Cal Fed now would be worth more than
the cash and stock offer made by the world's largest financial
services firm, given the 20% decline in Citigroup's stock since the
deal was forged three months ago, according to the Wall Street
Journal, which first reported the informal bid.</LD>
<TE>   In its merger proxy statement for shareholders, Golden State
mentioned a "preliminary acquisition proposal from a non-bank
financial institution." But the company didn't identify the amount of
the bid or the potential acquirer.</TE>
<TE>   Those omissions may not sit well with all Golden State
shareholders, some securities experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "Shareholders would have the right to be upset with the level of
disclosure in the proxy," said Robert Heim, a former SEC enforcement
attorney who is now with Meyers &amp; Heim in New York. "It doesn't give
the shareholders enough information to weigh the offers."</TE>
<TE>   But others said that type of disclosure is common in merger deals,
given confidentiality agreements involved in such bids.</TE>
<TE>   "They would never disclose the identity of a possible acquirer,"
said Scott Keller, president of New York-based DealAnalytics, which
provides research on mergers. "This will have no impact on the vote."</TE>
<TE>   Golden State spokeswoman Janis Tarter declined to comment
Wednesday, as did a Citigroup spokeswoman and representatives at the
Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Sallie Mae spokesman Jim Boyle said SLM Corp., which owns Sallie
Mae, the government-sponsored enterprise that issues student loans,
now has no interest in buying Golden State. SLM had retained
investment bank J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. to look into possible
acquisitions, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Golden State's large institutional shareholders such as TIAA-CREF
and mutual fund giant Vanguard Group said Wednesday that they could
not comment on the proxy vote or the disclosure issues.</TE>
<TE>   The deal is expected to be approved because corporate raider Ron
Perelman and Golden State Chairman Gerald J. Ford together own or
control about 47% of the company's stock and have already agreed to
the Citigroup merger, analysts said. The men began investing in banks
in the early 1990s and bought Cal Fed in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   "At 47%, this deal is done. Citigroup [stock] is one of the more
liquid securities on the planet and Ron Perelman needs cash," said
Charlotte Chamberlain, an analyst who follows Golden State for
investment firm Jefferies &amp; Co. in Los Angeles. "Anyone with more
than a room temperature, if you asked, 'Who do you want between
Citigroup and Sallie Mae?,' " would say Citigroup, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Sallie Mae offered to pay $5.7 billion for Golden State before
Citigroup, in May, agreed to pay $5.8 billion in cash and stock, the
Journal reported, citing unidentified sources. At today's prices,
Sallie Mae's bid would be worth about $5.5 billion and New York-based
Citigroup's would be about $4.8 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup's takeover of Cal Fed would give it an additional 350
branches, mostly in California. Citigroup has just 82 branches in
California and Nevada. If completed, the takeover would give
Citigroup about $54 billion in assets.</TE>
<TE>   The merger, which has drawn the attention of some community
activists, must be approved by the Federal Reserve and the Office of
Thrift Supervision, which regulates savings and loans such as Cal
Fed.</TE>
<TE>   Golden State shares rose 68 cents to $35.27 Wednesday, while
Citigroup's stock climbed 97 cents to $34.35. SLM shares fell $3.57
to $93.99. All three trade on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Banks Branching Out With Purchase of Hope Centers</HD>
<DH>Financial services: The move would offer more choices to
residents of two Los Angeles neighborhoods.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN ROBINSON-JACOBS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California National Bank and Hawthorne Savings Bank will buy two
nonprofit inner-city financial counseling centers and convert them to
full-service bank branches operating in some of the most underserved
areas of Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The deals represent a graduation of sorts for Operation Hope's
"empowerment" centers, which were opened beginning in 1996 to offer
counseling, check-cashing, utility bill payment and limited access to
traditional banking services for inner-city residents.</LD>
<LD>   A third Operation Hope center is not part of the deal.</LD>
<TE>   With their purchase by federally insured institutions, the two
centers will be able to offer a standard menu of bank
services--including checking accounts, loans and certificates of
deposit--in areas where many residents' choices have been limited to
costly check-cashing businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Operation Hope will continue to offer counseling, mortgage down
payment assistance and other non-banking services at all three
locations.</TE>
<TE>   Experts in community banking said the moves reflect a trend seen
elsewhere in the country in which major banks partner with community
groups, or expand non-full-service centers to attract inner-city
customers who were largely abandoned by the financial community as
bank consolidations reduced the number of branches in urban centers.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is a really effective way to reach underserved
markets," said Marva Williams, senior vice president of the Woodstock
Institute, a Chicago-based nonprofit that works to increase access to
capital in low-income and minority communities.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the problems banks have in some communities is that some
people really don't trust banks," Williams said. "By partnering, the
banks will be able to attract more un-banked consumers because those
people will already have a relationship with the nonprofit."</TE>
<TE>   Expanding Services</TE>
<TE>   If federal regulators approve, the banks would pay more than $1
million in cash and long-term payments for the two centers, sources
said. They would assume operating costs and gain an established
client base, goodwill and infrastructure including automated teller
machines.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Operation Hope, a nonprofit formed after the 1992 Los
Angeles riots, estimate that the largest of the three centers--on La
Brea Avenue near Rodeo Road--draws about 9,000 customers a month,
mainly to cash checks and use the ATM.</TE>
<TE>   Another center, at Slauson and Atlantic avenues, attracts about
3,000 customers.</TE>
<TE>   Hawthorne, which this week will complete the acquisition of First
Fidelity Bancorp Inc., has signed a letter of intent to purchase the
La Brea center. Hawthorne spent about $1 million to help that center
open in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   California National, a subsidiary of Illinois-based First Bank of
Oak Park, last month signed a definitive agreement for the Slauson
Avenue site, said John Bryant, founder and chairman of Operation
Hope.</TE>
<TE>   The bank, which has sought to expand into central city communities
in Los Angeles, would add a branch in Southeast Los Angeles' heavily
Latino community by acquiring the 4-year-old Slauson center.</TE>
<TE>   Discussions are underway with at least two other banks to acquire
the third Hope center in Watts, Bryant said.</TE>
<TE>   In another example of a service center evolving into a bank
branch, Bank One plans to open a full-service branch in Bronzeville,
a largely African American neighborhood in Chicago, based on the
success of a loan production/ATM center in that area, said Williams
of the Woodstock Institute.</TE>
<TE>   Return to Urban Areas</TE>
<TE>   Strengthening of the Community Reinvestment Act by the Clinton
administration encouraged more banks to return to urban districts,
Williams said, and she has seen "marginal improvement" in the
services offered to inner-city residents. But, she said, "there are
still some low-income communities that are significantly
underserved."</TE>
<TE>   Among those is the Maywood community in Southeast Los Angeles,
home to the Slauson Avenue center. The Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. lists no FDIC-insured institutions in the area.</TE>
<TE>   "This will give us the opportunity to move people from a cash
culture to a banking culture," said Greg Mitchell, president and
chief executive of California National Bank, which has $3.4 billion
in assets and 34 branches in Los Angeles, Orange and Ventura
counties.</TE>
<TE>   "We're convinced that there are a number of families and
businesses that have never been approached by a bank," he said.</TE>
<TE>   With the acquisition of the La Brea center, officials at El
Segundo-based Hawthorne Financial Corp., the parent of Hawthorne
Savings, said the bank gets not only "pretty strong demographics" but
also a branch with a record of attracting customers.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that it had the trust built up already was very
important for what we're looking for, as far as taking the center to
the next level," said Simone Lagomarsino, president and chief
executive of Hawthorne Savings, who also sits on the board of
Operation Hope. "We don't normally get that when we open a new
branch."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant estimates that Operation Hope spent more than $3 million on
the three centers, in addition to the nearly $4 million contributed
by Hawthorne, Wells Fargo Bank and Home Savings of America (now
Washington Mutual).</TE>
<TE>   Bryant said he does not expect to earn a profit from the sales.
"This deal is the best deal for the community, and [California
National] and Hawthorne we believe are the best partners for us long
term," he said. "That trumps getting back every dollar we put in.</TE>
<TE>   "We proved that this is a viable concept," he said. "Now we can
let the private sector come in and we can get out of the way."</TE>

<HD>Nissan Ad Campaign Will Tout Its Revival</HD>
<DH>Autos: The effort, part of a global image make-over, comes
in the midst of the Japanese car maker's comeback.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nissan North America will introduce today a major advertising
campaign aimed at persuading motorists that its much-vaunted revival
is a success.</LD>
<LD>   The campaign is part of an estimated $1.5-billion-plus global
image make-over ordered by Nissan Motor Co. Chief Executive Carlos
Ghosn. It comes in the midst of the most widely watched auto industry
resuscitation since Chrysler's 1970s comeback.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike Chrysler, which depended on a government bailout,
Tokyo-based Nissan has turned around on the strength of a massive
cost-cutting program and a huge product revival ordered by Ghosn.</LD>
<TE>   Nissan was facing insolvency in 1998, but posted a record profit
last year. Ghosn, a Renault executive known for charismatic yet
tight-fisted leadership, took the reins at Nissan after the French
auto maker acquired controlling interest in the then-distressed
company in late 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The ad campaign drops Nissan's longtime "Driven" theme for a new
one-word message: "Shift."</TE>
<TE>   In U.S. and Canadian TV, print and outdoor ads to be launched
Sept. 4, Gardena-based Nissan North America will urge consumers to
"shift" their attitudes and even their lives. Cost of the campaign by
Nissan's longtime agency TBWA/Chiat/Day is expected to eclipse the
almost $700 million Advertising Age estimates Nissan spent last year
on U.S. ads.</TE>
<TE>   The ads feature images of active people, including youthful snow
boarders, elderly marathon runners and a female rock climber with
prosthetic legs, followed by a montage of Nissan vehicles. The ad
text and commentary urge people to shift their expectations, fears,
passions, their entire world--or at least the way they move through
it. The unspoken suggestion is that they also should shift their
automotive allegiance to Nissan.</TE>
<TE>   The same theme also will be used in all Nissan advertising in
Europe and Asia.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign coincides with the U.S. launch of the Nissan Z sports
car, a long-awaited revival of the company's iconic two-seater. It is
one of six new or redesigned cars and trucks that Nissan North
America will launch over the next 16 months.</TE>
<TE>   The public will get a sneak peak in one of the commercials of one
product, the mid-size Murano sport utility vehicle to be introduced
in December.</TE>
<TE>   Other new Nissan products coming next year are a redesigned Maxima
sedan, a Z convertible, a redesigned Quest minivan and the company's
first full-size pickup and full-size sport utility vehicle.</TE>

<HD>Hidden Enron Deal to Aid in Prosecution</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A secret Enron partnership that engineered the bogus sale of wind
farms in California--and escaped detection for five years--now looks
to be a critical piece of evidence in the expected prosecution of
former Enron executives.</LD>
<LD>   The partnership, called RADR, was the handiwork of former Enron
finance executive Michael J. Kopper and his mentor, fired Enron Chief
Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow, according to court documents
filed Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Kopper pleaded guilty Wednesday to two felony counts related to
his investments in and management of RADR and two other partnerships,
Chewco and Southampton. Fastow has not been charged.</LD>
<TE>   Enron Corp., the highflying energy trader that collapsed into
bankruptcy in December, used a murky web of off-balance-sheet
partnerships to hide debt and other liabilities so that its financial
performance would continue to please Wall Street. Prosecutors said
Kopper, Fastow and others enriched themselves from these partnerships
at the expense of Enron, its employees and shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   RADR's task was simple. In May 1997, Enron needed to sell some
wind farms in California because it was buying a utility, Portland
General Electric. Under California utility regulations, an
alternative energy provider cannot be owned by a utility if it wants
to qualify for special, higher energy payments.</TE>
<TE>   But Enron did not want to lose control of the wind farms with the
purchase of Portland General, the court documents show, so a
putatively independent partnership was formed to buy them. Enron
retained secret control through Fastow and Kopper, who were the
primary investors in the partnership, according to the documents
filed by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange
Commission.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, RADR, which stands for Risk Adjusted Discount Rate,
was funded with a $16.4-million loan from an Enron subsidiary, not an
outside lender as required by law to qualify as an independent
partnership.</TE>
<TE>   Fastow and Kopper also parceled out pieces of the RADR partnership
to their relatives and friends. In the end, after Enron repurchased
the wind assets in July 2000, RADR generated about $4.5 million in
profit for the investors. Of that, $2.2 million went to Kopper and
his domestic partner, William Dodson, the SEC said in its civil
complaint against Kopper.</TE>
<TE>   RADR also highlights the role of a group known in Houston as "The
Friends of Enron." These were wealthy Houstonians tapped again and
again by Fastow and Kopper to invest in these partnerships. RADR was
an early venture.</TE>
<TE>   Some members of the group invested in RADR, but they used money
that was lent to them by Fastow through Kopper, the SEC complaint
said. The money was repaid with later distributions from RADR.</TE>
<TE>   "RADR never showed up in the financials or the subsidiary list or
the bankruptcy filing. We're talking a step more stealthy than
anything else," said Robert McCullough, a Portland, Ore., energy
consultant who has closely followed the Enron saga.</TE>
<TE>   McCullough said he suspects that many more schemes will come to
light as the probe continues. For example, the complaints by the
Justice Department and the SEC detail fraudulent gains for Kopper,
Fastow and others from a partnership known as Southampton totaling
$12.3 million, but no mention is made of 3.7 million Enron shares
that the partnership held but were never recovered, he said.</TE>

<HD>Vanguard to Turn More Activist in Proxy Voting</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vanguard Group may be best known for its "passive," index-style
investing, but the mutual fund giant said it would begin taking a
more activist role in corporate governance: The firm has revamped the
standards it will follow in proxy voting, putting companies on notice
about key governance issues.</LD>
<LD>   Longtime activist investors representing pension funds hailed the
move Wednesday by the second-largest mutual fund company, though some
governance experts called Vanguard's new policies limited in scope.</LD>
<LD>   Valley Forge, Pa.-based Vanguard, whose funds hold about $300
billion in stocks, posted a letter on its Web site Tuesday night that
was recently sent by Chairman John J. Brennan to leaders of companies
in which Vanguard holds a major stake. The letter addresses
Vanguard's new standards in such areas as director independence and
stock option programs.</LD>
<TE>   "We've always been active in corporate governance, but we're
imposing stricter guidelines in light of recent events," Vanguard
spokesman John Demming said Wednesday, referring to the spate of
financial scandals that have brought down such corporate titans as
Enron Corp. and WorldCom Inc., shaking investor confidence.</TE>
<TE>   The mutual fund industry, which controls about $3 trillion in
stock, has drawn criticism this year for failing to join the efforts
of pension funds and other historically activist investors in
pressing companies to change their conduct. Most fund companies have
long been reluctant to get involved in such campaigns, preferring
instead to jettison shares of firms that are performing poorly or
whose policies stoke shareholder ire.</TE>
<TE>   Among the governance issues Vanguard addressed in its letter:</TE>
<TE>   * Director independence. Vanguard said that it would withhold
votes for nonindependent directors who serve on audit, compensation
or nominating committees of a board, and that it would not vote for
any directors whose election would make the majority of a company's
board made up of insiders.</TE>
<TE>   These changes dovetail with director-independence rules recently
issued by the New York Stock Exchange, though the NYSE is giving
companies 24 months to comply.</TE>
<TE>   * Auditor independence. Vanguard will vote against a company's
auditors if non-audit fees make up more than half the total fees paid
by the company to the auditing firm.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, Vanguard's policy was to support a board's
recommendation regarding directors and auditors, barring special
circumstances, the firm said.</TE>
<TE>   * Stock option plans. Vanguard said that it supports option plans
in principle, but that it generally would vote against plans if
potential dilution from options exceeds 15% of shares outstanding or
if annual option grants have exceeded 2% of shares outstanding.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been asking mutual fund companies for years to come forth
and do their part for corporate governance," said Peg O'Hara,
managing director of the Council of Institutional Investors, a
Washington-based group that represents 120 pension funds. "I can only
hope this is the beginning of a row of dominoes in the fund
industry."</TE>
<TE>   David Nygren, San Francisco-based partner at Mercer Delta, a
consulting firm that works with boards and senior executives, said
Vanguard "should be applauded for stepping up," but he said the
guidelines "put a limited perspective on the whole picture."</TE>
<TE>   "They focus on the material relationship, the financial issue, but
not the matter of competence" of directors, he said. "This will
result in more independence, but not necessarily improved
performance."</TE>
<TE>   Nygren called Vanguard's auditor policy "a little soft." He argues
that an auditing firm should not be allowed to take in any fees from
consulting or other non-auditing work from a company once the firm
has been hired to review the company's books.</TE>
<TE>   "The best practice would be to eliminate any perceived conflict of
interest. This almost sounds like something written by an auditing
firm," Nygren said.</TE>
<TE>   Vanguard's founder and retired chairman, Jack Bogle, this year
helped organize a meeting of fund managers, including Legg Mason's
William Miller, to discuss corporate reform.</TE>
<TE>   But the group hasn't issued formal proposals on governance.</TE>

<HD>CBS in Negotiations for Clinton Talk Show</HD>
<DH>Media: Associates of the former president and TV executives
say several obstacles remain to reaching an agreement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEG JAMES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>CBS executives are negotiating to bring former President Clinton to
television as an afternoon talk show host as early as next year,
sources involved in the talks said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   CBS executives consider the negotiations with associates of the
former president to be preliminary and say several obstacles remain,
including the financing and format of a Clinton program as well as
whether Clinton is truly committed to hosting a daily talk show.</LD>
<LD>   Clinton has not attended any meetings with CBS.</LD>
<TE>   The concept of a Clinton talk show sprouted back in May, when he
met with seven NBC executives at the Los Angeles offices of Clinton's
prominent producer friends, Harry Thomason and Linda Bloodworth
Thomason. But the NBC talks stalled primarily because the two sides
were far apart on the deal's financial terms.</TE>
<TE>   "The numbers didn't work," one NBC executive said.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, Clinton associates began negotiating with CBS.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, people close to the former president downplayed the
interest in a Clinton talk show--without slamming the door on an
eventual TV deal.</TE>
<TE>   One of Clinton's attorneys, Robert Barnett, said in a statement:
"The president has received an enormous number of offers from
broadcast television, cable television, the Internet, print and
radio. We have no immediate plans to make any media deals."</TE>
<TE>   Clinton representatives declined to comment further. CBS
executives declined to discuss the matter.</TE>
<TE>   A syndicated Clinton talk show would cost about $50 million a
year, according to sources involved in the negotiations. Of that,
about $36 million would be spent on production costs, $4 million for
start-up costs and about $4 million to $5 million for advertising,
leaving a fee of about $5 million for Clinton. Another source with
knowledge of the proposed financial structure, however, said Clinton
was seeking a fee of $10 million.</TE>
<TE>   A former advisor questioned the former president's commitment to a
daily talk show, saying Clinton is focused on writing a book and
planning his presidential library.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, he's not comfortable with the idea of being a TV talk
show guy," said the advisor, who has had recent conversations with
Clinton. Creating a TV program for a former president is uncharted
territory, and Clinton wants to make sure that it strikes the proper
tone.</TE>
<TE>   "Bill Clinton meets with everybody, he's that kind of guy, and if
the idea for a television program is good enough, then he would
consider it," the former advisor said. "But it would have to be
something that works on all levels."</TE>
<TE>   James Potter, a professor of communications at UC Santa Barbara,
agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's clear why the networks want to do it," Potter said. "The
fascination value is going to be very high. The ratings would be very
high, initially. There's nobody like Clinton."</TE>
<TE>   However, the professor said that Clinton might become frustrated
with the limitations of a daily talk show. A talk show, he said,
would not allow Clinton to delve into complicated issues in a
detailed or meaningful way.</TE>
<TE>   "He's interested in solutions and not just discussion," Potter
said. "The problems that he's interested in do not have simple,
sound-bite solutions. Talk by itself doesn't change much."</TE>

<HD>Deutsche Telekom Posts Loss of $3.82 Billion</HD>
<DH>Earnings: First-half tally is worse than expected. Interim
CEO continues turnaround effort.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHEN GRAHAM</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>Deutsche Telekom, Europe's biggest telecommunications company, said
Wednesday that it lost $3.82 billion in the first half of the year
because of the rising costs of an expansion drive by its ousted chief
executive.</LD>
<LD>   The loss was worse than analysts had expected and more than 10
times wider than the company's net loss in the same period last year,
despite a 15% gain in sales. The company's financial statement did
not break out second-quarter results.</LD>
<LD>   Interim Chief Executive Helmut Sihler, appointed six weeks ago,
has pledged to intensify a turnaround drive begun by his predecessor,
Ron Sommer. That plan includes cutting jobs and investment and
selling assets to reduce the debt weighing on the company.</LD>
<TE>   Sihler left open the possibility of finding a partner for
VoiceStream, Deutsche Telekom's U.S. mobile phone unit, feeding
speculation that the company could lose control of the centerpiece of
Sommer's drive to transform the former German telephone monopoly into
a global telecom giant.</TE>
<TE>   "We know what we have to achieve and we can see clearly the path
we must take," Sihler said, promising "there will be no sacred cows"
in the restructuring drive.</TE>
<TE>   Under Sommer, Telekom spent billions to extend its wireless
business into Europe and North America and acquire licenses for the
next generation of mobile phone services. The prospects for that
business have faded, and the cost of writing down the value of the
assets is eating into earnings at Telekom as well as its rivals.</TE>
<TE>   Telekom said charges for depreciation and amortization on assets
including VoiceStream rose by $2.1 billion compared with the
year-earlier period. It also wrote down the value of a stake in
France Telecom by $247 million.</TE>

<LD>Stepping up its investigation into links between a key Wall Street
analyst and telecommunications companies, a congressional panel on
Wednesday asked Global Crossing Ltd. and Citigroup Inc. to provide a
long list of records and correspondence.</LD>
<LD>   Rep. Michael G. Oxley (R-Ohio), chairman of the House Financial
Services committee, made the request in letters to Citigroup Chairman
and Chief Executive Sanford Weil and Global Crossing Chief Executive
John Legere and Chairman Gary Winnick.</LD>
<LD>   He asked the companies to deliver by Sept. 4 documents including
minutes of board meetings, information about company stock
transactions, executive loans and compensation, and correspondence
between the companies.</LD>
<TE>   Arda Nazerian, a spokeswoman for Citigroup, said the company "will
continue to cooperate with the committee's inquiry." Spokeswoman
Becky Yeamans said Global Crossing executives "just received the
letter from Chairman Oxley and are reviewing it."</TE>
<TE>   Telecom analyst Jack Grubman, who recently resigned from
Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney unit, had a close relationship with
several telecom executives, including Winnick.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. is probing allegations that Grubman's research was skewed
to help Salomon win banking business from phone companies, and that
Salomon and Grubman gave valuable shares in new public offerings to
favored executives, including Winnick.</TE>

<HD>Choppy Trading Ends in Upswing</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Dow gains 85 and Nasdaq rises 32, helped by
Fed officials' upbeat remarks about the economic recovery.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks rose Wednesday as a day of choppy trading concluded on an
upswing, with investors betting that the market's recovery from a
midsummer plunge will gain traction.</LD>
<LD>   "The market realizes that an awful lot of negative news has been
embedded in prices," said John Davidson, chief executive of PartnerRe
Asset Management. "The extreme negativism in the market is
dissipating, and that's allowing the market to move higher."</LD>
<LD>   Wall Street also welcomed upbeat comments by Federal Reserve
officials about the U.S. economy, which buoyed stocks and nudged up
yields on Treasury securities.</LD>
<TE>   The Nasdaq composite index rose 32.66 points, or 2.4%, to
1,409.25. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 85.16 points, or
1%, to 8,957.23, after moving in and out of positive territory
throughout the day. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index added 11.93
points, or 1.3%, to 949.36.</TE>
<TE>   Winners led losers by more than 2 to 1 on Nasdaq and the New York
Stock Exchange. Volume continued to be modest.</TE>
<TE>   With no key economic reports to help drive trading, investors
listened closely to comments from three regional Federal Reserve bank
presidents, whose remarks were seen as hinting that the economic
recovery is on track and the U.S. central bank may not need to cut
interest rates.</TE>
<TE>   In separate speeches, Anthony Santomero, president of the
Philadelphia Fed; Michael Moskow, president of the Chicago Fed; and
Robert Parry, head of the San Francisco Fed, said interest rates are
low enough to keep consumers spending and fuel the economic rebound.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm confident the tools we have available will be effective in
continuing this recovery and leading us to potential growth,"
Santomero said.</TE>
<TE>   The comments dampened investors' enthusiasm for bonds as hopes for
further Fed rate cuts dimmed. The yield on the benchmark 10-year
Treasury note rose to 4.20% from 4.15% on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Many investors are convinced that a bottom has been reached in the
market and are picking up stocks at relatively cheap prices, said
Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView. "But there
are still some stories that have made it a mixed bag."</TE>
<TE>   Other analysts noted that the big rally in bonds as stocks fell in
the spring and early summer has meant that some institutional funds
now are forced to make asset allocation moves out of bonds and into
stocks. That has fueled the summer rally on Wall Street, said Tony
Dwyer, chief market strategist at Kirlin Holdings.</TE>
<TE>   "So the rally is not based on economic fundamentals," he said.
"For the time being, it may grind its way higher 5% or 10% over a few
months, but I am looking for a pullback" after that.</TE>
<TE>   Investors have been breathing easier about issues related to
questionable accounting in recent days, although their worries have
not completely evaporated. The guilty plea Wednesday of Michael
Kopper, the first former Enron executive to admit wrongdoing in the
collapse of the Houston energy trader, appeared to have little effect
on stocks.</TE>
<TE>   In other highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Oil prices rose again, led higher by speculators, as fears of a
U.S.-Iraq military confrontation outweighed news that U.S. oil
stockpiles rose last week. At the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude
oil for October delivery closed up 47 cents at $29.24 a barrel. The
September crude contract, which expired Tuesday, had risen as high as
$30.32, the highest price since February 2001, before closing Tuesday
at $30.11.</TE>
<TE>   * Investment banks and brokerages were under pressure after
Salomon Smith Barney cut its ratings on several stocks in the sector,
including Goldman Sachs, down 63 cents to $79.88, and Lehman Bros.,
which fell $2.20 to $58.98.</TE>
<TE>   * Home Depot rose $2.43 to $32.68, a day after the home
improvement retailer posted a sharper-than-expected gain in quarterly
earnings.</TE>
<TE>   * The retailing sector also got a boost from solid results from
other companies in the sector and Goldman Sachs' initiation of
research coverage on 10 specialty stores. Gymboree, among those
started by Goldman, jumped $1.45, or 9.7%, to $16.35. Late Tuesday,
Gymboree upped its profit forecast for its fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   But RadioShack sank more than 16% after the consumer electronics
retailer lowered its quarterly earnings outlook, saying sales have
weakened dramatically in August. It fell $4.74 to $24.21. Among rival
chains, Best Buy fell 76 cents to $23.10, and Circuit City Stores
lost $1.15 to $14.25.</TE>

<HD>Deadline Passes With No New Bidders for Napster</HD>
<DH>Internet: Despite creditors' last-minute efforts, media
giant Bertelsmann is in line to take over the remaining assets of the
music-swapping service.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No new bidders emerged for the remains of Napster Inc. by Wednesday's
Bankruptcy Court deadline, moving the dormant music-swapping service
a step closer to ownership by Bertelsmann, people close to Napster
said.</LD>
<LD>   A committee of unsecured creditors tried a last-ditch campaign to
attract interest from record labels, media companies and others,
asking for a minimum bid of $25 million.</LD>
<LD>   That might not have been enough to guarantee control, because
Bertelsmann believes it has bid more than $100 million, including
early loans of more than $85 million.</LD>
<TE>   But the creditors hoped that with a new entry, they could argue
that much of the old loans didn't count.</TE>
<TE>   The creditors, including the law firm of former Napster litigator
David Boies, hired Trenwith Securities in Costa Mesa to drum up
potential rescuers starting less than two weeks ago. Trenwith
Managing Director Rick Chance declined to comment on whether any had
emerged.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the time frame, I think we did everything humanly
possible," Chance said.</TE>
<TE>   Unless legal objections in Napster's Delaware bankruptcy
proceedings stop the sale, Bertelsmann could take ownership after a
final hearing Aug. 29.</TE>
<TE>   One creditor, PlayMedia Systems Inc., filed an objection
Wednesday, arguing that its software code unwittingly may be
transferred in the sale. More problematic would be an objection by
the record labels, which has yet to surface.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Bertelsmann again declined to say what its
intentions are for the revamped system. Since the ouster of
Bertelsmann Chief Executive Thomas Middelhoff, Napster's prospects
for success within the German media company have grown bleaker.</TE>
<TE>   After losing a series of court rulings in a copyright infringement
lawsuit by the record labels, Napster was forced to shut its system
and cut off as many as 60 million subscribers. It developed a new
version with copyright protections, but has been unable to strike
deals for content from the labels.</TE>
<TE>   Napster filed for bankruptcy protection earlier this year, and
Middelhoff agreed that Bertelsmann would buy it after the proceedings
washed away the company's legal liabilities from its past actions.</TE>

<HD>FDA Reviewing Rules on Drug Manufacturing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Food and Drug Administration is looking at revamping rules for
safe drug manufacturing for the first time in 25 years.</LD>
<LD>   The move comes as major medical factories have failed to meet
current standards of quality manufacturing, including factories
belonging to Johnson &amp; Johnson, Eli Lilly &amp; Co. and Schering-Plough
Corp.</LD>
<LD>   The FDA said its changes would modernize the way it inspects
medical factories and allow pharmaceutical companies to make better
use of new technology that could improve quality control.</LD>
<TE>   FDA drug chief Janet Woodcock cited fully automated manufacturing
systems that some U.S. drug makers use in factories in Europe and
other countries--but not here--that contain sensors embedded in
different steps. Those sensors could tell if a batch of pills or
powders has an ingredient wrong, for example.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA likes the promise of that technology, but drug makers say
the government's decades-old manufacturing rules made it too hard for
them to adopt it in their U.S. factories.</TE>

<HD>Martha Stewart Sued by Her Firm's Shareholders</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News and Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Martha Stewart was sued by shareholders of her media and housewares
company who say she and eight current or former officials withheld
information about federal probes of Stewart's trading in another
company's stock when they sold $79 million in Martha Stewart Living
Omnimedia Inc. shares.</LD>
<LD>   In another development, her attorneys agreed to show additional
information to congressional investigators probing her sale of
ImClone Systems Inc. stock after complaints that portions of the
1,000 pages she turned over on Tuesday were blacked out.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit alleges that Stewart, who is chairwoman and chief
executive of the company that bears her name, sold 3 million Martha
Stewart Living shares for $45 million on Jan. 8. That came 12 days
after she sold 3,928 shares of ImClone stock.</LD>
<TE>   The Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and
Congress are investigating Stewart for possible insider trading in
her sale of the shares.</TE>
<TE>   Martha Stewart Living shareholder Howard Rosen contends that
Stewart and other company insiders violated civil securities laws by
failing to disclose what they knew about the ImClone sale and the
government investigations that ensued.</TE>
<TE>   The suit seeks class-action status for shareholders who bought the
stock from Jan. 8 to July 24, when shares dropped 42% to $9.05.</TE>
<TE>   Martha Stewart Living shares fell 14 cents to $8.91 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles' Coffee Bean &amp; Tea Leaf has accused rival Starbucks Corp.
of stealing the phrase "ice blended" to market a cold coffee drink.</LD>
<LD>   In a lawsuit against the nation's largest coffee-shop chain,
Coffee Bean claims it registered "ice blended" with the U.S. Patent
and Trademark Office in 1995 and has been using the name since 1986.</LD>
<LD>   The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, seeks
unspecified damages and an order to stop Starbucks from using the
phrase "Frappuccino Ice Blended Beverage" in its advertising.</LD>
<TE>   "Starbucks' acts of trademark infringement have been willful,
fraudulent and intended to cause confusion," the suit says.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle-based Starbucks didn't immediately return a call for
comment. Coffee Bean describes itself as the oldest and largest
closely held chain of coffee stores in the world.</TE>

<HD>Duke Halts Construction of Western Power Plants</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Duke Energy Corp., the second-largest U.S. utility owner, stopped
work on two Western power plants worth $550 million because they
wouldn't be profitable enough amid an expected decline in electricity
prices.</LD>
<LD>   The plants in Deming, N.M., and Satsop, Wash., were being built by
Duke/Fluor Daniel, a construction venture with Fluor Corp., Duke
Chief Financial Officer Robert Brace said. He added that a decision
on the projects will be made within weeks.</LD>
<LD>   The $300-million western Washington project and the $250-million
southwest New Mexico plant each would produce 600 megawatts, enough
to light 960,000 homes. The projects were set to open in the second
half of 2003 and were about 40% complete.</LD>
<TE>   Fluor, which is based in Aliso Viejo, said the decision to suspend
construction of the plants would not have a material effect on its
2002 financial results.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Charlotte, N.C.-based Duke rose 81 cents to $28.36 on
the NYSE. They have fallen 28% in the last year. Fluor fell $3.27 to
$27.66 on the NYSE. The stock has fallen 32% in the last year.</TE>

antibiotic Augmentin, saying Novartis subsidiaries are using a stolen
production process.</LD>
<LD>   *  Hot Topic Inc., a mall-based retailer of clothing for teens,
said second-quarter profit rose 1.5% to $4.34 million, or 13 cents a

at least a year gained just 0.6%. Earnings matched the company's
forecast, which was reduced last month from 15 cents a share.</LD>
<LD>   * Longs Drug Stores Corp. reported a 3% decline in second-quarter
net income to $10.9 million, or 29 cents a share, as higher expenses
and promotions offset higher sales from stores open at least a year.
The results met analysts' average estimate. Sales at the Walnut

same-store sales were up 3.3%.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Tyco International Ltd.'s board, under pressure from shareholders, is
considering the resignation of nine directors who served under former
Chief Executive L. Dennis Kozlowski, a person familiar with the
matter said.</LD>
<LD>   At least four of those nine reportedly support a proposal made by
board member Michael Ashcroft last week for the directors to step
down because of criticism about oversight of Tyco's accounting and
executive pay and benefits.</LD>
<LD>   Investors have said Tyco hid slowing growth at its units, which
include makers of fiber-optic cable, medical supplies and alarms. The
Securities and Exchange Commission is looking at Tyco's books, as
well as investigating the possible misuse of funds by executives.</LD>
<TE>   CEO Edward D. Breen Jr. has been meeting with shareholders, who
have seen their investments fall 72% this year.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco shares rose $1.37 to $16.72 in NYSE trading. They have more
than doubled since Breen was named chairman on July 25.</TE>

<LD>Expanding on a pilot program begun more than a year ago, Starbucks
Corp. introduced a $50 monthly plan that will allow high-speed
wireless access to the Internet from 1,200 coffeehouses.</LD>
<LD>   By year's end, 2,000 restaurants, or about a third of the Seattle
chain's total, will offer access using the Wi-Fi protocol and shared
space on powerful T1 lines from the VoiceStream Wireless subsidiary
of Deutsche Telekom.</LD>
<LD>   Some newer notebook and hand-held computers already are equipped
for Wi-Fi connections, also known as 802.11b connections.
Hewlett-Packard Co. will sell $79 cards to modify older machines.</LD>
<TE>   The three companies didn't give financial terms for the project,
but observers said it would be hard to generate much profit.</TE>
<TE>   A VoiceStream employee said each T1 connection would cost about
$400 a month to maintain, so Starbucks must sign up more than 10,000
subscribers.</TE>

<HD>US Airways to Cut Capacity by 13%</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>ARLINGTON, Va.</DL>
<LD>US Airways Group Inc., operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection, said Wednesday that it will eliminate about 200 flights,
or 13% of its daily schedule, as part of a restructuring plan
designed to allow the airline to emerge from reorganization as a
profitable carrier.</LD>
<LD>   The Arlington-based carrier's cutback announcement was the latest
in a string from major U.S. airlines. It helped boost airline stocks,
which have been flagging as the industry tries to stem losses.</LD>
<LD>   AMR Corp., parent of American Airlines, gained $1.88, or 20%, to
$11.20 on the New York Stock Exchange, the stock's biggest one-day
percentage rise since October 1989. Delta Air Lines Inc., Continental
Airlines Inc., Northwest Airlines Corp. and Southwest Airlines Inc.
each rose at least 10%.</LD>
<TE>   "The hope is that if the entire industry follows through and has a
decent-sized capacity cut, it may restore some pricing normalcy to
the industry," said Standard &amp; Poor's equity analyst James Corridore.
"The only way they are going to be able to get pricing power back is
if demand improves and capacity shrinks."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. airlines are trying to reduce costs and boost revenue to
curtail losses that totaled $7.3 billion last year and more than $3.8
billion in this year's first half.</TE>
<TE>   Underscoring the reason airlines are still in dire straits nearly
a year after the terrorist attacks, the Air Transport Assn., the main
U.S. airline trade group, said this week that the amount of money
that airlines took in for each mile flown nationwide in July was down
8.7% from a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   US Airways Chief Executive David Siegel said the airline will
ground 19 planes and cut 30 flights next month. US Airways' fleet
will decline by 10% to 280 aircraft by the end of this year.</TE>
<TE>   He also said there will be employee layoffs, which will be
determined in the coming weeks.</TE>
<TE>   US Airways will continue to serve all but one of the 204 cities it
now flies to, instead of eliminating certain routes, said spokesman
David Castelveter. The airline operates 10 daily departures from Los
Angeles International Airport.</TE>

<HD>Bears Boost Bets With 'Short' Sales</HD>
<DH>Securities: If stocks continue to climb, more sellers may
pull plug on bets, which could help drive share prices higher.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM PETRUNO and JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bearish investors made a wave of fresh bets on lower share prices
beginning in mid-July, and as of Aug. 12 many of those investors
still were unconvinced that the market had seen its worst levels, new
data show.</LD>
<LD>   If stocks continue to resurge, proving the bears wrong, those
investors could add fuel to the rally by purchasing shares to
terminate their bets.</LD>
<LD>   The New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday said that "short
interest"--the number of NYSE-listed shares borrowed and sold,
usually in a bet on falling prices--soared from 7.55 billion shares
in mid-July to a record 8.08 billion as of Aug. 12.</LD>
<TE>   Short sales of NYSE shares have jumped 21% since mid-May, when the
market began a steep new decline that left key indexes at five-year
lows by July 23.</TE>
<TE>   Short sellers can profit in bear markets by borrowing stock
(usually from a brokerage's inventory) and selling it immediately,
with the idea of buying it back at lower prices later. The profit,
when the strategy works, is the difference between the sale price and
the repurchase price.</TE>
<TE>   But shorting is a high-risk strategy because of the chance that a
shorted stock will rise rather than fall. In that case, a short
seller's losses are potentially unlimited: They mount until the stock
is repurchased and the loaned shares are returned.</TE>
<TE>   The record level of shorted shares outstanding as of Aug. 12 shows
that many short sellers did not rush to close out their bets between
July 23 and Aug. 12, even as the market rebounded sharply in that
period.</TE>
<TE>   The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index jumped 13.3% between July 23 and
Aug. 12, and has since risen further, closing Wednesday at 949.36.
That is a 19% gain since July 23.</TE>
<TE>   If stocks continue to rise, more short sellers may pull the plug
on their bets. That buying pressure could help drive share prices
higher, analysts note.</TE>
<TE>   "This certainly lays kindling on any rally that should ensue,"
said Elliot Blumberg, manager of Vigilant Investors' Fund, a Santa
Monica-based hedge fund.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate report Wednesday, the tiny American Stock Exchange
said short interest in its shares surged 12% between mid-July and
mid-August. The Nasdaq market will report its short interest later.</TE>

<HD>Merrill Analyst Says Firing Unethical</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. analyst Peter Caruso, fired Tuesday for allegedly
disclosing to some investors that he planned to lower his profit
estimates on Home Depot Inc., said he did nothing wrong and is being
used as a "scapegoat" by the brokerage giant.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of Home Depot fell 7.4% on July 12, when Caruso's report
was published. Caruso said he told clients at a July 11 lunch meeting
that he expected the retailer to report sluggish sales. But the
20-year Merrill veteran said he never indicated he would lower his
rating or profit estimates the next day.</LD>
<LD>   "It was unethical of Merrill Lynch to terminate me," said Caruso,
44.</LD>
<TE>   He said a Merrill salesperson at the lunch interpreted his
comments as a sign he would cut his forecasts and alerted
institutional investors. He declined to identify the salesperson.</TE>
<TE>   "They're using me as a scapegoat to cover up what's going on
here," Caruso said.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Cobb, a spokesman for Merrill in New York, said Caruso broke
the firm's rules. "We completed a thorough investigation and stand
behind our conclusions," Cobb said.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill's decision to fire Caruso, ranked No. 1 among retail
industry analysts in Institutional Investor magazine's annual polls
for the last five years, is an effort to avoid another potential
legal mess, some experts say.</TE>
<TE>   In May, Merrill agreed to pay $100 million and change its research
practices to settle charges brought by New York Atty. Gen. Eliot
Spitzer. He alleged that the firm's Internet analysts misled
investors by touting stocks primarily to help garner investment
banking business from the companies.</TE>

<HD>Oakland's Lidle Pitches Second One-Hitter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cory Lidle has become an official one-hit wonder.</LD>
<LD>   Lidle pitched his second one-hitter in just more than a month,
giving up only a first-inning single Wednesday night as the Oakland
Athletics defeated the Indians, 6-0, at Cleveland for their eighth
consecutive victory.</LD>
<LD>   Lidle (7-9), who has a streak of 31 scoreless innings, gave up
only a two-out single in the first to Ellis Burks. After walking Jim
Thome, the right-hander didn't allow another runner.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't know if words can describe how well he pitched," Oakland
Manager Art Howe said. "He changed speeds, he threw everything for
strikes. Just a clinic on how to pitch."</TE>
<TE>   Lidle wasn't quite as impressed.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess without the two guys getting on in the first, it was a
pretty good game," he said, jokingly.</TE>
<TE>   Lidle matched a career high with eight strikeouts and got his
second career one-hitter and shutout.</TE>
<TE>   After walking Thome, Lidle retired 25 in a row, 14 on grounders.
He has not given up a run in four August starts.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't expect a guy to put zeroes on the board all year," Howe
said. "But that's what he's done."</TE>
<TE>   Oakland remained in a virtual three-way tie for first place in the
American League West, two percentage points behind the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 8, Detroit 2--Ismael Valdes was impressive in his Seattle
debut, and the Mariners pulled away with five runs in the top of the
ninth inning at Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle is in a virtual three-way tie for first place in the AL
West, two percentage points behind the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   Valdes (7-9), acquired in a trade with Texas on Sunday for two
minor leaguers, gave up two runs and five hits in 6 2/3 innings, and
struck out three.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 5, Texas 3--Nomar Garciaparra had four hits, including a
tiebreaking two-run single in the eighth inning at Boston.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Sox, who have won only twice in their last six games,
remained 3 1/2 games behind in the AL wild-card race.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 10, Minnesota 1--Jose Valentin homered in his first two
at-bats and drove in five runs at Chicago to help the White Sox end a
six-game skid.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Buehrle (16-9) gave up seven hits in seven innings to improve
to 4-0 against the Twins this year.</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Willie Harris and Magglio Ordonez each had three hits,
including one home run apiece.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 2, Tampa Bay 1--Rodrigo Lopez (14-5) gave up five hits
in eight innings, and Jerry Hairston drew a bases-loaded walk to end
a tie in the seventh inning at Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   The Devil Rays are winless in a club-record 15 consecutive series.
Tampa Bay has lost two of three in the four-game series.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City 7, Toronto 4--Carlos Beltran hit a three-run homer at
Toronto, and the Royals completed their first winning trip this
season.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City, 20-46 on the road, went 4-2 on the trip to Tampa Bay
and Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   Beltran's 20th homer highlighted a five-run fourth.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Fans Want Their Bobblehead Dolls</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>With players set to strike Aug. 30, the Angels have gotten fewer
questions from fans about potential ticket refunds for games not
played than from fans concerned about whether they still could get
the Brian Downing bobblehead doll scheduled to be given away Aug. 31,
Angel Vice President Tim Mead said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   In the event a strike forces a game to be rescheduled, the Angels
plan to offer ticket-holders the choice of a refund or admission to
the rescheduled game. Tickets would be refunded for any games not
rescheduled. If the Aug. 31 game is rescheduled, the bobblehead dolls
will be given away then. The Angels have not made plans for
distribution of the dolls should the game not be played.</LD>
<LD>   It is strictly coincidence, Mead said, that Aug. 30 also is the
deadline for season-ticket holders to pay in full for tickets to
potential playoff games. Those deposits would be refunded if no
playoff games are held in Anaheim, whether because a strike wipes out
the playoffs or because the Angels do not qualify.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   First baseman Scott Spiezio, who hit the game-winning home run
Wednesday, has driven in nine runs in his last eight games. He is
hitting .287 overall and a team-high .330 with men in scoring
position, more than adequate for a No. 7 hitter.</TE>
<TE>   And, said closer Troy Percival: "If he doesn't win the Gold Glove,
there's something wrong. I know [Seattle's John] Olerud does a great
job, but Spiezio has saved our bacon so many times on defense that
whatever he does on offense is a bonus."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Four baseball writers were walking the streets of Manhattan about
1 a.m. Wednesday when a New York police van cruised by. The guy in
the back seat was pounding on the window, gesturing to and attracting
the attention of the writers.</TE>
<TE>   Turns out the guy was Spiezio, who had not been arrested. After
Tuesday night's game, he attended a concert to benefit the NYPD, and
he couldn't pass up the offer of a ride back to the team hotel in a
police van. Spiezio, whose band, Sandfrog, plays heavy metal, said he
did not jam with the police band that performed at the concert.</TE>
<TE>   "They were playing all classic rock," Spiezio said. "I didn't know
any of their songs."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels promoted left-handed reliever Mark Lukasiewicz, who
posted a 3.48 earned-run average in 14 games with the Angels earlier
this season but a 4.24 ERA in 33 games at triple-A Salt Lake. They
have been ambivalent about Lukasiewicz's work this season, but they
would like to add another left-handed reliever.</TE>
<TE>   After passing on available relievers--they discussed a minor
league contract with Mike Magnante, released by Oakland and later
signed by the Dodgers--they'll try Lukasiewicz, at least for a few
days. He is the only left-handed reliever on the Salt Lake roster.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Howie Gershberg, the Angels' beloved and respected minor league
pitching coach, attended Wednesday's game and was happy to report
that a recent CT scan indicated the cancer diagnosed two years ago
continues to remain in control, if not in remission.</TE>
<TE>   With minor league seasons coming to a close, Gershberg said he has
been assigned to scout the Yankees in preparation for a possible
Angel-Yankee playoff series.</TE>

<LD>Tiger Woods first broke into national prominence when he won three
consecutive U.S. Junior Amateur titles and followed that by winning
three consecutive U.S. Amateur championships--a string of 36 straight
USGA matches.</LD>
<LD>   More remarkable, says Woods, is that at one point or another he
was behind in every match.</LD>
<LD>   "Every final match I was in went to the last hole or beyond," he
said, "and I was somehow able to win. That is something that
collectively has certainly helped me get to where I am now."</LD>
<TE>   The biggest comeback came in the 1994 U.S. Amateur at Sawgrass in
Florida where he was six down with 11 to play against Trip Kuehne.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who was the youngest of the four major leaguers who
have hit 600 home runs when he hit No. 600?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Easy to spot: When Shaquille O'Neal is home in Orlando, Fla., he
drives a 45-foot motor home with a giant Superman logo and his
trademark TWISM (The World Is Mine) painted on both sides.</TE>
<TE>   "Summertime in Orlando is my time to relax," he said while
attending Tracy McGrady's charity event with his four children.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What's he worth?: Comedian Bill Murray, an avid golfer, caddied
for Kailin Downs in the U.S. Women's Amateur in Scarborough, N.Y.,
after her assigned caddie failed to show up. Downs lost in a
15-player playoff for the final two spots in match play.</TE>
<TE>   Would he consider becoming her regular caddie?</TE>
<TE>   "That all depends," Murray said. "We'll see what kind of tip I
get. I went through her bag and only found $20, so it doesn't look
good for me."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Moving on: Pooh Richardson, after a career as a high school phenom
in Philadelphia, a star guard at UCLA and with three NBA teams,
including the Clippers in 1999, has joined the Harlem Globetrotters'
front office.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No bleeps: Football coaches are notorious for banning things for
their players--fast foods, cell phones, late nights, long hair, etc.</TE>
<TE>   Vanderbilt Coach Bobby Johnson has banned cursing. When defensive
end Chuck Losey said, "Football is synonymous with cussing," Johnson
said, "Not this one."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Who's at home? The last time Wisconsin played football in Las
Vegas, the Badger fans turned Sam Boyd Stadium into a sea of red.
That was 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Wisconsin will play Nevada Las Vegas again Aug. 31 and UNLV
authorities are withholding about 5,000 of the 40,000 seats for the
hometown fans.</TE>
<TE>   "We did not want to see every seat go to a Wisconsin fan like in
'96," said Terry Cottle, associate athletic director. "In reality, we
could have sold out a year ago. The demand in Wisconsin is there.
They'll pay whatever."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Babe Ruth, 36 years, 6 months, 15 days. Hank Aaron
was 37, Willie Mays and Barry Bonds both 38.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Billy Joe, football coach at predominately black
Florida A&amp;M in Tallahassee, is looking to recruit white players.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't wait for the time to come for white kids to be more
receptive to [historically black colleges and universities]," Joe
said. "I'm trying to recruit them. Some just tell me, 'No thank you,
coach,' and I understand.</TE>
<TE>   "I want more Charlie Allens." Allen is the team's leading pass
receiver--and white.</TE>

<LD>Dodger right fielder Shawn Green will observe Yom Kippur, the holiest
day of the Jewish year, next month, but he said he isn't planning on
giving up any playing time.</LD>
<LD>   "The schedule works out well this time," he said.</LD>
<LD>   Jews are forbidden from eating, drinking or working on the Day of
Atonement, which is determined by the Jewish calendar.</LD>
<TE>   Last year, Green sat out a game to observe the holiday, which
begins at sundown and ends around 40 minutes after sundown the
following day, or when three stars can be seen in the sky.</TE>
<TE>   This year, Yom Kippur begins at sundown Sunday, Sept. 15. Assuming
there is no strike, the Dodgers are in Colorado that day to face the
Rockies in a game that begins at noon PDT. They are at home Monday
night for the 7 p.m. opener of a four-game series against the San
Francisco Giants</TE>
<TE>   Look for Manager Jim Tracy to be peeking out of the dugout around
game time, scanning the skies for those three stars.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Although right-hander Kevin Brown, recovering from elbow and back
surgery, gave up three runs and seven hits in three innings Tuesday
night against the Florida Marlins in his second relief appearance,
Tracy was quick to defend him Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people hear the name Kevin Brown and they think he is
invincible," Tracy said. "He's not.... He's going to have some ups
and downs. I saw some great pitches [Tuesday night] and I saw some
flat ones. There is no sense of urgency. We are not pushing any panic
button. We've got to be patient."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy, however, was anything but patient when questions about
Brown persisted.</TE>
<TE>   "How many different questions about this can I answer?" he said.
"It takes time. That's the answer to all the questions about this,
time."</TE>

<HD>Timing Looks Perfect to Ruiz, Lalas, Galaxy</HD>
<DH>MLS: Forward scores 17th goal and defender adds game-winner
in 82nd minute to help L.A. defeat Kansas City, 2-1.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The way things are going for the Galaxy, Carlos Ruiz is going to owe
Alexi Lalas a watch before the season ends.</LD>
<LD>   Ruiz, who was promised a new timepiece by Lalas if he had 15 goals
on the season, scored his league-leading 17th Wednesday night, and
Lalas had the game-winning goal in the Galaxy's 2-1 victory over the
Kansas City Wizards in front of 8,943 at the Rose Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   "Better than just the two of us getting watches," Ruiz said,
"would be for all of us to get rings, championship rings."</LD>
<TE>   With the win, the Galaxy (12-8-3, 39 points) moved into second
place in Major League Soccer's Western Conference and kept pace with
the front-running San Jose Earthquakes (13-8-3, 42 points), 3-1
winners over the Dallas Fire.</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz, a forward coming off a one-game suspension for accumulation
of caution points, put the Galaxy on top in the 31st minute.</TE>
<TE>   With Simon Elliott bringing the ball up along the right sideline,
the Galaxy midfielder had his path cut off by the Wizard defense. So
Elliott found Ezra Hendrickson in stride with a nifty back-heel pass.</TE>
<TE>   Hendrickson fired from just inside the penalty box, but Kansas
City goalkeeper Tony Meola was able to deflect the shot.
Unfortunately for the Wizards, the ball caromed back into the field
of play and Ruiz was there to shoot from 12 yards out and into an
unguarded net for the 1-0 Galaxy lead.</TE>
<TE>   The goal also gave Ruiz 35 points (17 goals, one assist) and he
overtook New England's Taylor Twellman (34 points) for the league
scoring lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Wizards tied it in the 60th minute when an unmarked Preki
scored his sixth goal of the season on a 30-yard shot.</TE>
<TE>   Lalas' heroics were set up by an Elliott corner kick from the left
side.</TE>
<TE>   With Elliott's curling kick coming in from the left, Lalas, who is
6 feet 3, out-jumped the gathering and got just enough head on the
ball to send it into the ground in front of Meola. The diving Meola
got a hand on it but the ball squirted past him and into the right
side of the net for Lalas' fourth goal of the season, which ranks
second on the Galaxy behind Ruiz.</TE>
<TE>   Lalas, a defender who is two seasons removed from a one-year
retirement, equaled his career high for goals scored in a season, and
he has set a new mark for points in a season with 12.</TE>
<TE>   "I think if you're a professional athlete and you want to be a
good one, you better understand that you're an entertainer and you've
got to keep people coming back," Lalas said of his penchant for the
dramatic.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm good at certain things and I'm horrible at others. I like to
think that I'm adequate at getting my head on the ball, so when those
opportunities arrive, I have to at least create some problems, make a
nuisance of myself and see what happens."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   While Hong Myung-Bo's South Korean club team claimed Wednesday
that Major League Soccer's request to acquire the defender and assign
him to the Galaxy was denied, Galaxy General Manager Doug Hamilton
was noncommittal.</TE>
<TE>   "We are optimistic about where our discussions are with a Korean
player," Hamilton said. "I won't be specific about any particular
player, but we feel that the discussions are going in a positive
direction and to discuss any particular discussions that are going on
would jeopardize the talks."</TE>
<TE>   When told that his comments were neither a confirmation nor a
denial that the Galaxy had attempted to acquire Hong from the Pohang
Steelers of the K League, Hamilton smiled.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm saying we don't talk about negotiations while they're in
progress," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hong, the South Korea captain who led the host nation to a fourth
place finish in the World Cup, was awarded the Bronze Boot as the
tournament's outstanding defender.</TE>
<TE>   "Hong's contract with our team expires at the end of 2003," Pohang
spokesman Chung Kyo-Jin told Reuters. "We rejected his request
because we want him to play here for Korean fans."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   World Cup star Landon Donovan, Ariel Graziani and Ramiro Corrales
scored goals as the defending MLS champion San Jose Earthquakes
clinched a playoff spot with a 3-1 victory over Dallas in front of
9,089 at San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   Against his former team, Graziani scored his 13th goal of the
season in the seventh minute and set up Donovan's goal in the 33rd
minute. In the 43rd minute, the Burn's Jorge Rodriguez converted a
penalty kick to make it 2-1.</TE>
<TE>   Corrales capped the scoring with a long shot in the 63rd minute.
The Earthquakes, the first team to clinch a playoff spot, broke a
three-game winless streak.</TE>

<HD>Spar for the Course</HD>
<DH>Sandy Tatum is putting up a fight for classics such as
Cypress Point and Merion</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL ARKUSH</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>PEBBLE BEACH</DL>
<LD>Another drive safely in the fairway, Frank D. "Sandy" Tatum puts his
club down and returns to his point.</LD>
<LD>   "Golf courses are losing their relevance," says Tatum, 82. "This
course is a classic example."</LD>
<LD>   This course? Cypress Point? Surely, Tatum, a former president of
the U.S. Golf Assn., must be exaggerating. With its giant sand dunes,
undulating fairways and dramatic views of the Pacific Ocean, Cypress
Point Club couldn't be more relevant.</LD>
<TE>   But Tatum is not exaggerating. That is not how he communicates. He
communicates with anecdotes, as well-placed as his tee shots, such as
the one he tells at the formidable 12th, a dogleg right that Ben
Hogan, according to Tatum, called his favorite par four in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Three years earlier, he was playing Cypress with three members of
the U.S. Walker Cup team. During the round, they required only wedges
or short irons for their approaches to the green. It confirmed to
Tatum that Cypress, as conceived by its designer, Alister MacKenzie,
in the late 1920s, was no longer the challenge it was meant to be. It
could be tamed. Worse, conquered. Today's players, thanks to more
sophisticated equipment and better conditioning, simply hit it too
far.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very depressed," Tatum recalls.</TE>
<TE>   Tatum arrives at his drive, and conclusion.</TE>
<TE>   "I finally told them what I thought," he says, "and I asked them
if they understood what was going on in the game. One of them said
that he couldn't agree with me more."</TE>
<TE>   Agreement is one thing, change another, and that's what depresses
Tatum the most. He doesn't see it happening. Not soon enough, at
least. Not with the millions of dollars that manufacturers have at
stake.</TE>
<TE>   He has a right to make his case. Very few have given more to the
game. As a boy in the late 1920s, he was smitten while accompanying
his father down the fairways of Bel-Air Country Club. His first hero
was Bobby Jones.</TE>
<TE>   Tatum went on to star at Stanford, winning the NCAA individual
title in 1942, but that was before there was any real money in
professional golf.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he joined the Navy, landed a Rhodes scholarship and a
career in law, which he still practices part-time in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   But he never abandoned his other love, serving, most prominently,
as the USGA head in the late 1970s. Encountering criticism over the
way the Winged Foot Golf Club in Mamaroneck, N.Y., had been set up
for the 1974 U.S. Open, won by Hale Irwin at seven-over 287, Tatum,
chairman of the championship committee at the time, responded with an
unforgettable defense. "We're not trying to humiliate the best
players in the world," he said. "We are simply trying to identify who
they are."</TE>
<TE>   Tatum, who can still play--he would shoot a respectable 86 on this
typically foggy day on the Monterey Peninsula--has also identified a
solution to the length problem.</TE>
<TE>   It has to do with the golf ball, not the clubs, as many have
contended in recent years. He is convinced there is a way for
technology to limit how far the top professionals can hit the ball,
perhaps to about 290 yards, while, at the same time, not reduce the
maximum driving distance for the average player. If such a ceiling is
not imposed, he claims, brilliant designs such as Cypress Point and
Merion, outside Philadelphia, where Jones completed the Grand Slam in
1930, will become more irrelevant. "Something has got to be done," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of Slams, the topic of Tiger Woods comes up as Tatum
reaches the 15th tee. Even if Woods had been able to pull off the
Slam this year, Tatum does not believe the accomplishment would have
surpassed what Jones did. "Jones had to win in a match-play format,"
he points out, "and, in those days, the amateurs were at least as
good as the professionals."</TE>
<TE>   Tatum expects a lot from Woods. He once wrote him a letter, hoping
that, as an example to youngsters, he would finish his education
before going on to the PGA Tour. He doesn't know if Woods ever read
it. He still believes that Woods, who left Stanford after his
sophomore year, could do a tremendous service if he were to go back
and get his degree in the fall during the tour's unofficial season.
Too many youngsters, especially underprivileged ones, according to
Tatum, sacrifice their education, believing in the "delusion" that
they will be successful in life if they only develop their athletic
skills.</TE>
<TE>   He is also direct when the discussion turns to Riviera Country
Club in Pacific Palisades, which, after undergoing renovations, is
hoping to play host to a U.S. Open for the first time since 1948.
Word on the site for the 2008 tournament is likely to come from the
USGA in October.</TE>
<TE>   Tatum seems more fond of the other Southern California candidate,
Torrey Pines in La Jolla, which he played recently. Besides providing
a better infrastructure, an Open at a public facility, on the heels
of the visit to Bethpage Black, would be another symbolic tribute to
public golf. "Los Angeles is a very blase town," he adds. "San Diego
would go bonkers over an Open."</TE>
<TE>   At various points during the round, Tatum's game falters a bit.
"Isn't that pathetic?" he says after coming up short on a chip shot.
"I can still hit it pretty well at times. I just can't sustain it."</TE>
<TE>   But there is one thing he can sustain. His enthusiasm. For someone
who, by his estimate, has played Cypress "thousands of times," he
never fails to appreciate its beauty and serenity.</TE>
<TE>   "The adrenaline was flowing when I was in my car on the way here,"
says Tatum, who owns a house in nearby Capitola. "Coming here affects
me so much. I always feel like I'm playing it for the first time."</TE>
<TE>   Cypress certainly seems part of another era.</TE>
<TE>   No beverage cart. No real estate development.</TE>
<TE>   Only the game of golf, with all its possibilities and pitfalls.</TE>
<TE>   About six months ago, Tatum was approached by the leadership of
the club for his views on lengthening the course to keep up with
today's longer hitters. That's what Augusta National and Riviera did,
and what many others will surely do in the years ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Forget about keeping up with today's longer hitters, he said. They
are the problem, not Cypress.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's more useful to keep Cypress the way it is, to show
it as an example of what has happened to the classic courses," he
says, preparing to line up another tee shot.</TE>
<TE>   He swings away. The ball heads straight toward its target.
Everything, for the moment, is perfect.</TE>

<HD>A Year's Delay Puts Ryder Cup in Perspective</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER YOON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Now that the four major championships are complete, it's time to
shift attention to the Ryder Cup.</LD>
<LD>   That's right, this is a Ryder Cup year, no matter how little it
feels like one.</LD>
<LD>   The biennial buzz and media frenzy surrounding the Ryder Cup have
been absent this year, making it easy to forget, but the matches will
be played Sept. 27-29 at the Belfry in England.</LD>
<TE>   The Ryder Cup, usually contested every two years, was canceled
last year in the wake of the Sept. 11 tragedies. The teams had been
announced before the cancellation and the PGA of America and the
European Ryder Cup Board agreed to leave them intact for this year.</TE>
<TE>   Without players jockeying for position in the points standings,
and no opinions to be conveyed over who should be captain's picks,
there hasn't been much to talk about leading up to this year's event.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything is different because of the delay," U.S. Captain
Curtis Strange said. "I think the first thing that came to mind was
that there would not be the buzz for the players trying to make the
team and for the two picks.... It's great writing. It's great
bar-room talk for all of us. But it's not this year, and that's fair
enough."</TE>
<TE>   The past few Ryder Cups have been marred by unruly crowds,
animosity between teams and unbecoming conduct by the players. That
win-at-all-costs mentality has lost its edge during the last year,
resulting in a lower profile for the matches.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, I think we all understand that the Ryder Cup might have
been going a little too far--over the edge," Tiger Woods said. "It's
not a blood bath. I think we as players, the media and the fans, we
all lost sight of that. It's terrible to say, but 9/11 reminded us
all of that. It's sad to say that it takes something like that to
remind us that it is just a sport."</TE>
<TE>   Woods expects this to be a much more genteel version of the
matches, one that he hopes will rekindle the original spirit of the
competition.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the matches will be conducted in the fashion it was
designed, and that is a competitive atmosphere, but it is a
gentlemanly sport," Woods said. "We are going to enjoy it, but it's
not going to be the same. It's not going over the top. We all
understand it's not life or death."</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Update</TE>
<TE>   Woods heads to suburban Seattle for the NEC Invitational beginning
today at Sahalee Country Club looking to win the tournament for the
fourth consecutive time--a feat that hasn't been done in 72 years.</TE>
<TE>   Should Woods win, he will join Walter Hagen and Gene Sarazen as
the only players to win an event four consecutive times. Hagen won
the PGA Championship in 1924-27; Sarazen won the Miami Open in 1926
and '28-'30. The Miami Open was not played in 1927.</TE>
<TE>   It is the second opportunity this year for Woods to match Hagen
and Sarazen. He finished 22nd in his bid to win a fourth consecutive
Memorial in May. Should Woods falter this week, he can match the
record next season. Woods won his third consecutive Bay Hill
Invitational in March.</TE>
<TE>   Major Stats</TE>
<TE>   Sergio Garcia was the only player to finish in the top 10 in all
four majors this year. David Duval did not break 70 in any of the
four majors.</TE>
<TE>   Future Is Now</TE>
<TE>   Lorena Ochoa, Christina Kim and Miriam Nagl earned automatic
exemptions for the 2003 LPGA Tour by finishing in the top three on
the Futures Tour money list.</TE>
<TE>   Ochoa, 20, turned professional in May after her sophomore year at
Arizona. She won three times, had eight top-10 finishes and topped
the money list despite playing only 10 events.</TE>
<TE>   Locally</TE>
<TE>   The Accenture Match Play Championship will return to La Costa
Resort and Spa in Carlsbad for four years beginning in February, PGA
Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem announced Wednesday.... Ray Carrasco,
55, of Irvine, won the European Senior Tour Travis Perkins Senior
Masters Sunday at Wentworth in England.... Paul Dietsche, the head
pro at Arrowhead Country Club, won the Southern California PGA
Section championship Wednesday. He receives automatic exemptions for
the 2002 Buy.com Inland Empire Open and the 2003 PGA Tour Bob Hope
Chrysler Classic, Buick Invitational and Nissan Open.... Craig
Steinberg of Oak Park defends his title in the Southern California
Mid-Amateur championship Aug. 26-27 at Big Canyon Country Club in
Newport Beach.</TE>

<DL>DEL MAR</DL>
<LD>On the first day of the meet, picturesque Del Mar drew more than
37,000 last month, a record crowd for an opener. Last Saturday, there
was a crowd of 30,723, the most Del Mar has drawn for any day except
an opener or the Pacific Classic, and this Sunday, with Kentucky
Derby winner War Emblem expected to run, the turnout might approach
the opening-day attendance.</LD>
<LD>   This is the kind of track and those are the kind of invigorating
crowds that Frank Stronach, one of the last of the live-racing
boosters, envisions for his racing empire, a string of 14 plants that
stretch from Florida to California. But here Sunday, the closest
Stronach can come to basking in Del Mar's success will be if his
Milwaukee Brew wins the $1-million Classic.</LD>
<LD>   Otherwise, the Austrian-born industrialist must make do with his
two jewels--Santa Anita and Gulfstream Park--and their 12 dwarfs.
Santa Anita, since it became Stronach's first track purchase at the
end of 1998, is a work slowly in progress, and last winter Gulfstream
muddled through what has been described as the worst season in the
South Florida track's history.</LD>
<TE>   "He's got second-rate tracks," said the New York Racing Assn.'s
chairman, Barry Schwartz, who might possibly be Stronach's No. 1
nemesis among his track counterparts. "He's got Santa Anita and
Gulfstream, but he practically ruined Gulfstream this year."</TE>
<TE>   Long on properties, short on prestige, Stronach recently reached
into his seemingly bottomless coffers and, in a $117-million deal,
bought controlling interests in Pimlico and Laurel Park in Maryland.
Unfortunately, Laurel is more known for what it used to
be--pre-Arlington Million and pre-Breeders' Cup, a pioneer of
international grass racing in the U.S.--and Pimlico, despite hosting
the Preakness, the middle leg of the Triple Crown, is a rundown
eyesore in a low-rent district of Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   Schwartz, whose Belmont Park stages the final Triple Crown race,
said the day the deal was announced that Stronach and his Magna
Entertainment overpaid for what he got in Maryland. Now he's still
saying it: "Maryland was a major circuit at one time, but it's a
bush-league track now. One of these days, Stronach is going to
implode."</TE>
<TE>   Stronach and his first lieutenant, Jim McAlpine, could not be
reached Wednesday, and Joe De Francis, who with his sister, Karin,
became a minority partner in Maryland after the sale to Stronach,
also was away from his office. The guess is that some or all of them
are at Saratoga, like Del Mar not a bad place to be if glimmer glass
summertime racing is your bag.</TE>
<TE>   Shooting from the hip, which is frequently ill-advised, Stronach
said for openers in Baltimore that he would like to raze Pimlico and
rebuild the joint. Overnight, he may have tried to find some wiggle
room for that plan, but local racegoers are salivating about a
possible renovation. Just think, they say to themselves, the chance
to visit their hometown track without worrying about the master fuse
box blowing, the elevators stopping and loose glass panes falling.</TE>
<TE>   Stronach, whose total racetrack investments now approach the
$700-million mark, foresees the 2004 Preakness being moved to Laurel,
with the work at the new Pimlico being finished in time for the
Triple Crown race to be back in Baltimore by 2005. Already he is
hearing quibbles from traditionalists who decry a non-Pimlico
Preakness. They should be alerted that this is the least of the flaws
in the scheme. After all, the Belmont Stakes, while Belmont Park was
being redone, was run five times at Aqueduct in the 1960s. Don't
protest too much, Baltimore; better Laurel than Santa Anita for an
interim Preakness.</TE>
<TE>   For Pimlico, though, it may be too late. Many lapsed horseplayers
have been lost forever, and cosmetics won't be enough to coax them
back.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Medaglia d'Oro, drawing the No. 5 post in a nine-horse field, is
the 2-5 morning-line favor in Saturday's $1-million Travers at
Saratoga. Others entered are Shah Jehan, Quest, Like A Hero, Repent,
Gold Dollar, Saint Marden, Nothing Flat and Puzzlement.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trainer Bob Baffert said that he would decide just before entry
time today whether War Emblem will run in the Pacific Classic. "We'll
have to see how he's doing," Baffert said. "If he wasn't doing good,
I wouldn't run him, but as of [Wednesday], we're considering
running." War Emblem, who would be the favorite, worked five furlongs
in a fast :57 3/5 Tuesday, causing Baffert to wonder whether the work
could have taken too much out of his colt.</TE>
<TE>   Baffert's horses finished 1-2 in the $150,000 Best Pal Stakes,
Kafwain beating Chief Planner by one length. Baffert's third horse,
Icecoldbeeratreds, broke awkwardly and finished fifth as the 9-10
favorite.</TE>
<TE>   Jockey Gary Stevens, whose riding career is on hold after surgery
on his right knee, said that he has landed the role of jockey George
Woolf in the movie based on Laura Hillenbrand's best-selling book
about Seabiscuit. Stevens and Woolf are in the Racing Hall of Fame.
Another Hall of Famer playing a Hall of Famer in the film will be
Chris McCarron, who has the role of Charley Kurtsinger. Tobey Maguire
will play Red Pollard, Seabiscuit's regular rider. "My part is more
speaking than riding, quite a lot of speaking actually," Stevens
said. "I've never done anything like this before, but I auditioned
and was hired." Filming will begin in Kentucky and Ohio in October.</TE>

<LD>   What: "Beyond the Glory"</LD>
<LD>   Where: Fox Sports Net, Sunday, 8 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   When Doug Flutie became a Chicago Bear, teammate Jim McMahon
called him "America's midget." A more accurate description of the
5-foot-9 quarterback is that he is "America's favorite underdog."</TE>
<TE>   "I think people relate to me because of my size," says Flutie in
the latest installment of "Beyond the Glory."</TE>
<TE>   This profile of Flutie is excellent. The one-hour documentary
opens with his Hail Mary pass against Miami during his Heisman
Trophy-winning season at Boston College.</TE>
<TE>   It then details his life, taking viewers through his childhood in
Manchester, Md., his high school days in Natick, Mass., his college
days at Boston College, his initial struggles in the NFL, his stardom
in Canada and his successful return to the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   The show also touches on Flutie's son, Doug Jr., who is autistic.
He was diagnosed in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   In typical "Beyond the Glory" form, Flutie and those closest to
him tell his story. There are in-depth interviews with Flutie, his
parents, his two brothers, his wife, his high school coach, and
various other coaches, teammates and friends. They include Gerard
Phelan, Flutie's teammate and roommate at Boston College who was on
the receiving end of his Hail Mary at the Orange Bowl in Miami, and
former Bear coach Mike Ditka.</TE>
<TE>   "Doug Flutie was a football player--played with his heart, played
with his head," Ditka says.</TE>

<LD>It would be a complete shock if trainer Bob Baffert did not win
today's second race at Del Mar.</LD>
<LD>   The question is whether he will win with Vindication, the 4-5
favorite, or 6-5 second choice Bull Market.</LD>
<LD>   Both colts were impressive breaking their maidens in their career
debuts earlier in the meet and appear headed for bigger and better
things.</LD>
<TE>   Owned by Padua Stable, Vindication, a son of the late, great
Seattle Slew, was purchased for $2.15 million last year.</TE>
<TE>   He showed much promise in his July 27 debut, winning at today's
distance (six furlongs) after breaking from the rail. At the wire, he
had 5 1/2 lengths on the rest of the field and was never asked for
his best by jockey Mike Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Three days earlier, Bull Market, a son of Holy Bull owned by James
McIngvale, dominated his five rivals going five furlongs, winning by
a little more than three lengths. The knock against him is that the
field he beat wasn't particularly strong. Macho Image, another
Baffert horse, has since been beaten in a claimer, and Dirty Tricks,
who was fourth, lost in his next appearance for trainer Bob Hess Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Those fighting for the minor awards in the $56,000 optional
claimer are Hair Jordan, making his first start for sharp trainer
Jeff Mullins after racing in Idaho, Luzern, Jimmy O and Pine For
Java.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: J.T.'s Song will try for his second win of the
meet in Del Mar's third against Dixie Thrill, a re-claim by trainer
Doug O'Neill, and four others.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Francisco Duran. The apprentice jockey edged Russell
Baze, 16-15, to win the jockey title at the recently concluded Bay
Meadows Fair meet.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Macario Rodriguez and Barrington Harvey. At the same
Bay Meadows Fair meet, the two riders combined to go 0 for 44.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three using J.T.'s Song and Dixie
Thrill in the third, singling Vigor in the fourth and using Soup'n
Crackers, Chalifoux, Luxury Jewels, Shescominundone and Entrancing in
the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 1/52. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $6.40/$318.20. Total money bet: $426.</TE>

<HD>Owners Offer Cut in Shared Money</HD>
<DH>Baseball: They propose to reduce revenue sharing by $14
million. Union is studying proposal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID and ROSS NEWHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Major League Baseball's lead labor lawyer on Wednesday said owners
have presented a revenue-sharing proposal to players that he
considered a "substantial move toward the union both in structure and
in transfer amount."</LD>
<LD>   Rob Manfred declined to reveal the offer management had made
Tuesday in an attempt to spur lagging talks and avert the sport's
ninth work stoppage in 30 years, but a lawyer close to the talks said
owners reduced their proposal from $282 million to $268 million. The
union's current offer is $235 million, meaning the sides are $33
million apart on the amount of money that would be transferred from
high-revenue to low-revenue clubs. Union officials are expected to
respond as early as today to the offer.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, the commissioner's office began preparing for another
potentially lengthy strike, informing clubs to reduce expenses if
play stops. The sides have not made progress since the union set an
Aug. 30 walkout date, but they're still at the table and finally
getting back to key economic issues.</LD>
<TE>   "We spent the day on non-core issues in order to give the [union]
some time to prepare a response to the proposal," Manfred said.
"Hopefully, we'll get it [today]."</TE>
<TE>   Although acknowledging the owners' effort, union officials did not
seem encouraged by the revised revenue-sharing plan.</TE>
<TE>   "Boy, Rob sure is interested in PR," union head Don Fehr said. "We
got something from them [Tuesday] and there have been a lot of things
going back and forth on a lot of issues right now. We're going to
study everything and get back to them soon. That's really all there
is to it."</TE>
<TE>   Owners, seeking improved salary-restraint tools in the next
agreement, have demanded increased revenue sharing and a tax on high
payrolls, prompting opposition from players who view the two-tiered
system as a salary cap. Management is still awaiting a response to a
payroll-tax proposal it made last week.</TE>
<TE>   The ball is in the union's court, Manfred said.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankly, we made a tax proposal last Wednesday and we haven't
gotten a response on that yet, other than a little speech from their
committee," he said. "I am frustrated a little bit. I'd like that
there'd be more active dialogue on the tax and the revenue sharing,
but it takes two parties to have a dialogue."</TE>
<TE>   Manfred said management's new revenue-sharing proposal
"substantially reduced the gap" between the sides, but the union said
that's a matter of perspective.</TE>
<TE>   "Substantial means different things to different people," said
Gene Orza, associate general council for the players' association.
"It was a productive move worthy of recognition. It was far more
discernable than their tax proposal."</TE>
<TE>   Under that management proposal, a team would be taxed at 37.5% the
first time it exceeded the tax threshold, 42.5% the second time,
47.5% the third time and 50% the fourth time. Management, also
seeking to have payroll based on 40-man instead of 25-man rosters,
adopted the union tax-rate formula, but increased the threshold only
$4 million--to $102 million--from its starting figure.</TE>
<TE>   Under the union offer, the minimum payroll subject to being taxed
would be $130 million in 2003, $140 million in 2004 and $150 million
in 2005, at which point the tax would end. The tax would be assessed
at a rate of 15% for clubs above the threshold once, 25% twice and
30% three times.</TE>
<TE>   Manfred acknowledged time is running out to get a deal done. "I'm
concerned that the players have made a threat to not continue to play
the games," he said. "I'd like to do everything possible in order to
get an agreement, an acceptable agreement from the perspective of the
clubs, of course, that would prevent them from carrying out that
threat."</TE>

<HD>Virus Is a Shaq Setback</HD>
<DH>Lakers: After a summer of mixed medical opinions, center is
expected to have toe surgery within two weeks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shaquille O'Neal has returned to Los Angeles, fighting the residue of
a virus that is believed to be the final obstacle to the toe surgery
that has been debated for more than two months.</LD>
<LD>   The Laker center will undergo a cheilectomy, a procedure doctors
believe will ease the pain and increase the mobility in the first
joint of his big right toe, as soon as the virus, which caused his
temperature to spike Wednesday and also has caused some swelling in
his liver, has subsided. More tests are expected today, and the
surgery could be done in two weeks, or sooner.</LD>
<LD>   The recovery period will be approximately eight weeks, and so
could leak into the regular season. After the surgery, which will be
performed by Dr. Robert Mohr, O'Neal will be able to walk immediately
and should be able to run in about six weeks.</LD>
<TE>   The process of reaching the verge of surgery from the moment
O'Neal limped away from the Lakers' third consecutive NBA
championship was spearheaded by agent Perry Rogers, and was arduous,
he said. Rogers, unhappy with the growing criticism of a plan that
has lingered well into summer, said Wednesday night that he would not
have risked O'Neal's career for the sake of a speedy resolution.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to go through the process," he said. "I think we've made
the best decision for Shaquille, the Lakers and Shaquille's playing
career."</TE>
<TE>   It began in the first week of July, less than two weeks after
O'Neal had completed his domination of the New Jersey Nets. Mohr,
retained by O'Neal in mid-season when medication, orthotics and other
common treatments neither killed the pain nor improved his play, told
O'Neal he believed the toe had carried O'Neal as far as it could in
its current state. He recommended a cheilectomy.</TE>
<TE>   On July 13, O'Neal and Rogers sought and received a second opinion
from a specialist Rogers declined to name. Five days later, that
specialist, Rogers said, insisted O'Neal would require a cheilectomy
and a Moberg osteotomy, the latter procedure being a more invasive
surgery requiring a screw inserted into the toe.</TE>
<TE>   Eight days after that, O'Neal, Rogers and Mike Parris, O'Neal's
business manager, sat in Mohr's office at UCLA Medical Center and
presented Mohr with the second opinion. Mohr, Rogers said, told them
the Moberg osteotomy not only would put O'Neal's foot at risk, it
might threaten his career.</TE>
<TE>   "Now," Rogers recalled thinking, "we have a problem."</TE>
<TE>   That afternoon, Rogers telephoned Laker trainer Gary Vitti, who
recommended Dr. Robert Anderson, a well-regarded podiatric specialist
in Charlotte, N.C., who has consulted with many athletes, including
Deion Sanders and Carolina Panther center Jeff Mitchell.</TE>
<TE>   Mohr forwarded X-rays and other records. Vitti, whom Rogers
described as an "awesome" contributor to the process, compiled films
of O'Neal gradually losing his ability to run the floor. On Aug. 12,
after studying the films and considering O'Neal's arthritis, Anderson
told Rogers he believed surgery was unnecessary, that O'Neal was
performing too well--even through the pain--to risk any surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Three specialists had arrived at three different conclusions.</TE>
<TE>   "The difficulty was the conflict," Rogers said. "I have three
similar opinions, that's easy. It became a debate with three prongs
to it."</TE>
<TE>   It was O'Neal, Rogers said, who settled it. After a lengthy
telephone conversation with Mitchell, the NFL player who had endured
two cheilectomies, O'Neal said he could not play another season with
the same uncertainty, and the same experimentation with orthotics and
Indocin.</TE>
<TE>   And so, with the Lakers having given their blessing, with Mohr
prepared to schedule the cheilectomy and O'Neal having made the
decision to push ahead, O'Neal checked himself into a hospital in
Sand Lake, Fla., on Thursday, his fever at 103 degrees. He was
released from the hospital Friday and traveled to Los Angeles from
Orlando, but some of the symptoms have remained, delaying again the
surgery O'Neal and at least one of three specialists believe will
allow him to resume his career, as pain-free as possible.</TE>

<DL>SOUTH WILLIAMSPORT, Pa.</DL>
<LD>The hits were few, the strikeouts plenty.</LD>
<LD>   Zachary Osborne and Aaron Alvey hit consecutive home runs in the
11th inning to give Louisville, Ky., a 2-1 victory over Fort Worth in
the first U.S. semifinal at the Little League World Series.</LD>
<LD>   It was the first game in the history of the Little League World
Series in which both pitchers threw no-hitters through six innings.</LD>
<TE>   Alvey struck out 19, while Fort Worth starter Walker Kelly struck
out 21. Both had to be replaced in the 10th because of a Little
League rule that bars pitchers from throwing more than nine innings.</TE>
<TE>   Five pitchers combined for 49 strikeouts, the most ever in a
series game.</TE>
<TE>   The previous record, set during the 1971 championship game between
Gary, Ind., and Tainan City, Taiwan, saw Lloyd McClendon, now the
manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates, and Mu-Hsu Chin combine for 34.
Tainan City won, 12-3, in nine innings.</TE>
<TE>   The game took 3 hours, 10 minutes, one minute short of the series
record set in 1998 between Toms River, N.J. and Jennison, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   Worcester, Mass. plays Harlem, N.Y. in the other U.S. semifinal
today, and that winner plays Louisville on Saturday in the U.S.
championship game.</TE>
<TE>   Osborne hit the first pitch of the 11th inning from Michael Valdez
(1-1) over the wall in center field. Alvey then homered to left to
make it 2-0.</TE>
<TE>   "When I hit it, I was like, 'Yeah it's gone,' " said Osborne
(2-0), who pitched the 10th and earned the victory.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Japan beat Guam, 10-0, in the first international semifinal. Japan
(4-0) will face the winner of today's semifinal between Willemstad,
Curacao, Netherlands Antilles and Valencia, Venezuela for the
international championship on Saturday.</TE>

plotted to fix the ice dancing and pairs figure skating competition
at the Salt Lake City Olympics.</LD>
<LD>   Alimzhan Tokhtakhunov was arrested July 31 in Venice, Italy, to
face conspiracy charges contained in a criminal complaint filed in
U.S. District Court in Manhattan after an investigation of one of the
largest judging scandals in Olympic history.</LD>
<LD>   He was accused of plotting to persuade a French judge to vote for
the Russian pairs team, and a Russian judge to vote for the French
ice dancing team. Both teams won gold medals.</LD>

the Russian and French skating federations to fix the outcome of the
pairs figure skating and ice dancing competitions at the 2002 Winter
Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   The French ice dancing team included a woman of Russian descent.</TE>
<TE>   The charges were brought after wiretaps placed as part of a mob
investigation picked up telephone conversations between Tokhtakhunov
in Italy and unidentified conspirators during the Games.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said Tokhtakhunov, who had lived in France but was
forced to leave that country, had hoped to gain favor with French
authorities through the scheme to have his French visa extended.</TE>

<HD>Stram Chosen Hall Finalist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hank Stram, a former coach of the Kansas City Chiefs and New Orleans
Saints, has been selected by the Pro Football Hall of Fame's seniors
committee as a finalist for election in the class of 2003.</LD>
<LD>   As the seniors committee nominee, Stram will join 14 modern-era
candidates who will be announced Jan. 25, 2003, the day before the
Super Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   To be elected, Stram must receive the same 80% voting support that
is required of all finalists. The hall's 39-member board of selectors
will elect between four and seven new members during the meeting in
San Diego.</LD>
<TE>   Stram was an assistant at the University of Miami in 1959 when
Lamar Hunt hired him as the first coach of the Dallas Texans of the
American Football League. The Texans moved to Kansas City in 1963 and
became the Chiefs.</TE>
<TE>   Stram was an immediate winner in Dallas and won the 1962 AFL
championship. He led Kansas City to two Super Bowl appearances,
losing to Green Bay, 35-10, in the first Super Bowl in 1967.</TE>
<TE>   He led the Chiefs over Minnesota, 23-7, in the 1970 Super Bowl.
The victory gave credibility to the AFL.</TE>
<TE>   During the 10-year history of the AFL, Stram's Texans/Chiefs won
more games than any other AFL team and he won more championships than
any other coach (1962, 1966, 1969).</TE>
<TE>   An innovative coach, Stram developed such formations as the
"moving pocket," which used the talents of quarterback Len Dawson. He
devised a two-tight end offense that provided an extra blocker to
help protect his passer.</TE>
<TE>   On defense, he made famous his "stack defense," with linebackers
stacked behind down linemen.</TE>
<TE>   During his 17 seasons as coach of the Texans/Chiefs (1960-1974)
and the Saints (1976-1977), Stram compiled a 131-97-10 regular-season
record and was 5-3 in the postseason.</TE>
<TE>   He was selected AFL coach of the year in 1968.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Steve McNair, still bothered by tightness in his back,
didn't practice for the second consecutive day and Tennessee Titan
officials put him through some tests as a precaution.</TE>
<TE>   An MRI and X-rays showed no problems, Coach Jeff Fisher said as
the team ended training camp with two workouts. He said McNair was
given an injection in his lower back to ease some swelling.</TE>
<TE>   McNair ruptured a disk in his lower back in 1999 and sat out five
games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Houston claimed defensive end Erik Flowers, Buffalo's No. 1 pick
in 2000, off waivers. Flowers played in 15 games last season....
Detroit released former Michigan quarterback Scott Dreisbach....
Dallas long snapper and tight end Jeff Robinson is expected to sit
out the season because of a torn knee ligament.... Defensive back
Clevan Thomas, the Arena League defensive player of the year with
ArenaBowl champion San Jose, signed with San Francisco.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Curt Schilling won his major league-best 21st game, striking out nine
in seven innings, and the Arizona Diamondbacks kept up their mastery
of the Cincinnati Reds with an 11-3 victory Wednesday night at
Phoenix.</LD>
<LD>   The Diamondbacks have won 10 of 11, five against Cincinnati. They
can complete a sweep of their six-game season series against the Reds
with a victory tonight.</LD>
<LD>   Steve Finley doubled, tripled and singled in his first three
at-bats and drove in three runs. He had two chances to complete the
cycle with a home run but struck out in the sixth and flied out to
right field in the eighth.</LD>
<TE>   Quinton McCracken was three for five with three runs batted in,
including a two-run homer, his third this season but second against
the Reds in the last week. Junior Spivey doubled twice and drove in
three runs.</TE>
<TE>   Schilling (21-4) gave up two runs and five hits, and walked one,
giving him 259 strikeouts and 20 walks this season. He threw only 75
pitches, 58 for strikes.</TE>
<TE>   Schilling began the game with 13 consecutive strikes. His first
ball was to Jason LaRue, the second batter in the third inning.
Through three innings, Schilling threw 18 pitches, 17 for strikes.</TE>
<TE>   He was perfect through four innings, with 23 strikes in 26
pitches.</TE>
<TE>   Schilling walked to lead off the fourth and scored from second on
Spivey's double. When he returned to the mound to start the fifth
with an 8-0 lead, he gave up a leadoff triple to Austin Kearns down
the right-field line, then walked Sean Casey on four pitches.</TE>
<TE>   It was only the second walk Schilling had allowed in his last six
starts.</TE>
<TE>   Kearns, three for four Wednesday and six for seven in his last two
games, homered in the ninth. He also scored on Reggie Taylor's
groundout in the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Todd Walker tripled in the sixth and scored on Aaron Boone's
single.</TE>
<TE>   The Reds, who are 63-62, have lost seven of nine to fall seven
games behind first-place St. Louis and two games behind Houston in
the National League Central.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Moehler (2-3) lasted two innings in his shortest outing this
season. He gave up six runs and seven hits.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco 3, New York 1--Kirk Rueter gave up five hits in
eight shutout innings at San Francisco to help send the Mets to their
10th consecutive loss.</TE>
<TE>   On the heels of consecutive shutouts by teammates Livan Hernandez
and Jason Schmidt, Rueter (11-7) faced the minimum 15 batters through
five innings, retiring 11 in a row at one point. He won for the
fourth time in six starts with the help of four double plays.</TE>
<TE>   Although Rueter bunted in the eighth and still looked strong,
Manager Dusty Baker decided to abandon the chance for the Giants'
first string of three consecutive complete-game shutouts since 1960.</TE>
<TE>   Robb Nen pitched the ninth but gave up two quick hits. Timo Perez
scored on a wild pitch to end San Francisco's string of 28 scoreless
innings--the team's longest since July 5-9, 1988. Nen finished for
his 30th save in 37 chances.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 6, San Diego 3--Gary Sheffield drove in five runs with two
homers and a double at San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Sheffield went three for three and walked twice. He has 24 homers,
second on the team behind Andruw Jones' 26.</TE>
<TE>   Right-hander Kevin Millwood (13-6) held the Padres to three runs
and six hits in eight innings to win his fourth consecutive decision
and improve to 11-1 in his last 18 starts. The Braves have won 16 of
his last 18 starts.</TE>
<TE>   Millwood struck out seven and walked three. John Smoltz needed
only eight pitches to get through a perfect ninth for his major
league-leading 44th save in 48 chances.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 4, Pittsburgh 1--Chuck Finley (4-3) struck out 10 in
eight innings and Scott Rolen hit a two-run triple at St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Finley reached double figures in strikeouts for the 33rd time in
his career, and for the first time since he struck out 11 Detroit
Tigers on May 28, while playing for Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Isringhausen worked the ninth for his 28th save in 32
chances. He is nine for nine since the All-Star break and hasn't
given up a hit or a walk in seven games in August.</TE>
<TE>   The victory was the 1,887th in 24 seasons for Manager Tony La
Russa, moving him into the top 10 ahead of Hall of Famer Bill
McKechnie.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 4, Chicago 0--Carlos Hernandez (6-4) gave up four hits in
six innings at Houston to beat Mark Prior in a matchup of rookies.</TE>
<TE>   Prior (6-4) pitched 4 2/3 innings, giving up four runs and 12
hits.</TE>
<TE>   In his second start since returning from the disabled list Sunday,
Hernandez tied a career high with eight strikeouts and walked three.
It was his first victory since beating the Cubs on May 31.</TE>
<TE>   He had been on the disabled list because of a sore left shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 13, Milwaukee 3--With rain pouring through the roof
at Milwaukee's Miller Park, Bobby Abreu homered and drove in four
runs to help the Phillies tie a season high with 17 hits.</TE>
<TE>   A severe thunderstorm hit the area in the fifth inning.</TE>
<TE>   The stadium's fan-shaped roof has five retractable panels, which
have had problems handling rain.</TE>
<TE>   Water poured through during the Home Run Derby at last month's
All-Star game.</TE>
<TE>   Winds of 65 to 70 mph blew the protective flashings out of place
Wednesday, allowing rain to pour in.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 13, Colorado 5--Brad Wilkerson hit two home runs for
Montreal at Denver, where the Expos had a season-high six homers.</TE>
<TE>   Vladimir Guerrero, Jose Vidro, Wil Cordero and pinch-hitter Matt
Cepicky homered for the Expos.</TE>
<TE>   Wilkerson has 17 homers, two short of the franchise rookie record
held by Andre Dawson (1977) and Larry Walker (1990).</TE>

<HD>It Seems Arum's Luck Has Been All Used Up</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T.J. Simers</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>DEL MAR</DL>
<LD>I go where the story is, of course, and so if boxing promoter Bob
Arum wants to get together where the turf meets the surf, I make the
sacrifice.</LD>
<LD>   But as I sat there Wednesday afternoon in the Turf Club trying to
appear rich, Jenny Craig sitting at the next table betting all the
money the wife spent on her diet cuisine over the years while still
gaining 10 pounds, I began to wonder about this incredible story of
Arum surviving a fiery plane crash.</LD>
<LD>   Now I would think a guy, who has walked through a wall of fire
without so much as an eyebrow being singed, would be pretty darn
lucky.</LD>
<TE>   But here I was sitting next to a big loser. And when I offered to
take him to the windows following the eighth race to show him what it
was like to collect on a winning bet, I detected some bad blood there
as he stalked off.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NOW I really got to thinking. Was the whole thing a scam? I mean,
was there really a plane crash just hours before a news conference
designed to get attention for the Fernando Vargas-Oscar De La Hoya
fight in Las Vegas next month? Or was it some kind of publicity
stunt? I know, hard to believe anyone in the world of boxing would
resort to a publicity stunt, but then I read columnist  Jon Saraceno
in USA Today quoting Don King saying of Arum, he's "the devil of
deception," and now what was I supposed to think?</TE>
<TE>   I asked Arum, who had promoted Evel Knievel's jump over the Snake
River Canyon, if I could believe what he tells me, and he said,
"sometimes."</TE>
<TE>   So I ask you--what's more outlandish to believe: A boxing promoter
surviving a plane crash on his way to a news conference, or someone
losing every bet on a day so easy to pick winners that even Times'
handicapper Bob Mieszerski guessed correctly once in the paper?</TE>
<TE>   The whole thing smelled like some kind of set up: He had to know I
would laugh at him like I would laugh at Brian Jordan striking out
four times in a row, which would certainly result in "bad blood,"
coincidentally the same handle that Arum has been using to promote
the Vargas-De La Hoya bout?</TE>
<TE>   Con man just out to get attention for his fight, or just a
horrible gambler?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WE WERE sitting at the same table with Judy Carmel, Arum's
sister-in-law and an owner of horses, who was giving me winning tip
after winning tip, and I was thinking I might be able to buy the
Dodgers from Fox if this kept up--and I'd keep Jim Tracy as
manager--and Arum still hadn't cashed a ticket, and he was getting
madder and madder because I was.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you know how two people can really get to the point where they
just hate each other?" he said. I took it for granted he was talking
about himself and his sister-in-law until he mentioned Vargas' name,
and I realized he was working me in order to promote the fight.
"We're going to have a plastic shield separating the fighters at the
press conference in Las Vegas. Lots of bad blood there, maybe as much
as there was for the Hearns-Hagler fight."</TE>
<TE>   He said he likes De La Hoya to win the fight; he also picked Jake
The Gamer to win the fifth, and I've asked track officials to let me
know when the horse finally makes it to the finish line.</TE>
<TE>   So I'm convinced he's just a horrible gambler, who was probably in
a plane crash, and darn lucky that everyone else was betting on him
to survive and make this fight in Las Vegas something special.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ESPN IS going to put an authentic anchor desk from "SportsCenter"
up for bid to benefit The Jimmy V Foundation for Cancer Research. I
would think it'd be a tremendous credibility boost for Fox's Southern
California Sports Report if their anchors were seen working behind a
"SportsCenter" anchor desk.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SHAQUILLE O'NEAL is scheduled to appear Friday at 1 p.m. at the
Challenger Boys and Girls Club in Los Angeles to help unveil "The
Biggest Children's Book in the World." Local bookmakers say it's 5-1
Shaq is a no-show.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE DODGERS took possession of a life-like wax figure of Tom
Lasorda that had been on display at Movieland, and now have the big
dummy standing near the gift shop on Level 5. I had a 10-minute
conversation the other night with Lasorda, and I have to tell you
it's the most fun I've ever had talking with the dummy--not a single
interruption.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE CHARGERS broke training camp Wednesday, and when they begin
training again next July it will be at Cal State Dominguez Hills. San
Diego Union-Tribune columnist Nick Canepa is upset about this and
took his wife and son on a tour of Carson recently. When his wife got
out of the car, he quoted her as saying, "It smells here." I believe
that's conclusive proof the Chargers belong in Carson.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WITH E-MAIL help from Vick in Arcadia, I learned the Dodgers have
nominated the following players for the Sporting News' "Good Guy"
award this year: Shawn Green, Eric Karros, Brian Jordan and Kevin
Brown. The Dodgers said this is the fourth nomination for Brown, who
for some unexplained reason, has yet to win.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   HERE'S YOUR chance to tell me where to go: The Choking Dogs play
the Braves Saturday at 1--the same time as the Sparks' playoff game
with Utah.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from a Playboy publicist:</TE>
<TE>   "Would you be interested in coming to the Playboy Mansion for the
launch of the first ever Playboy slot machine, which should include
some visual and fun sights--at 6 p.m. on Monday, Sept. 16?"</TE>
<TE>   That's our 30th wedding anniversary; I hope I can still get home
in time to celebrate.</TE>

<HD>Paraguay Spoils Scolari's Farewell Game in Brazil</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Luiz Felipe Scolari's farewell game in charge of the Brazil team that
he coached to its World Cup triumph in June ended in disappointment
Wednesday when the world champions were upset, 1-0, by Paraguay in
Fortaleza, Brazil.</LD>
<LD>   A goal by Nelson Cuevas in the 28th minute was all the visitors
needed to spoil the Brazilians' celebration and hand them their first
loss in 15 matches and their first in four years at home.</LD>
<LD>   An out-of-shape Ronaldo lasted only 33 minutes before being taken
out of the game as Scolari used all 21 available players.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, teammate Rivaldo said he might quit the Brazil team
unless Scolari's yet-to-be-named successor assures him a role in the
2006 World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Italy Also Beaten</TE>
<TE>   Italian soccer, already beset by a World Cup ouster at the hands
of South Korea, financial problems that are crippling many teams, and
a television dispute that has caused the season's start to be delayed
by two weeks, suffered another blow Wednesday when Italy was upset,
1-0, by Slovenia.</TE>
<TE>   In a game in Trieste that was interrupted three times--twice by
smoke bombs thrown onto the field by Slovenia fans and once by a
Slovenia fan running across the field--Coach Giovanni Trapattoni's
team looked no more organized than it had in South Korea and Japan.</TE>
<TE>   A goal by Sebastian Cimirotic in the 32nd minute was enough to
give Bojan Prasnikar an unexpected victory in his debut as Slovenia's
coach.</TE>
<TE>   Germany Held to a Tie</TE>
<TE>   Bulgaria wasn't impressed by the fact that Germany finished second
in the World Cup, and it took the lead twice before settling for a
2-2 tie in Sofia.</TE>
<TE>   Dimitar Berbatov put Bulgaria ahead, but a penalty kick by Michael
Ballack leveled the score.</TE>
<TE>   Bulgaria again went in front on a penalty by veteran Krassimir
Balakov, but Arne Friedrich, making his debut for Germany, scored on
a 25-yard shot to spare Coach Rudi Voeller any embarrassment.</TE>
<TE>   "In the first half, we had certain problems in defense," Voeller
said. "The younger players showed impatience and nervousness [but] I
am satisfied with their diligence and they showed they have a
future."</TE>
<TE>   France Struggles On</TE>
<TE>   France's hopes of putting a dismal World Cup behind it evaporated
in Tunis, where the 1998 world champions were held to a 1-1 tie by
Tunisia, spoiling the debut of new Coach Jacques Santini.</TE>
<TE>   The French, despite fielding a lineup that included such players
as Zinedine Zidane and Thierry Henry, were again lethargic and have
now failed to win in their last four games.</TE>
<TE>   Mickael Silvestre gave France the lead by heading in Zidane's
cross in the 18th minute, but Ali Zitouni scored the tying goal 20
minutes later and France had to work hard to fend off a possible
defeat.</TE>
<TE>   "We will obviously need some more time to work as there were huge
discrepancies in the form of the players tonight," Santini said.</TE>
<TE>   Spain Tied Up</TE>
<TE>   Spain, under new Coach Inaki Saez, dominated Hungary in Budapest
but managed only a 1-1 tie at Ferenc Puskas Stadium after Hungarian
midfielder Vasile Miriuta scored in the 72nd minute, canceling out
Raul Tamudo's headed goal in the 55th minute.</TE>
<TE>   Saez was pleased with his team's performance but not with giving
up the tying goal. "After we scored, we were all trying to get in on
the act and we got caught," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Scotland Sets Record</TE>
<TE>   Slumping Scotland lost its record fifth consecutive game when it
was beaten, 1-0, by Denmark at Hampden Park in Glasgow on a
ninth-minute headed goal by Danish striker Ebbe Sand.</TE>
<TE>   "The result is very disappointing for me and also the
performance," said Scotland's German coach, Berti Vogts, whose future
in the position is beginning to look uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   In their 130-year international soccer history, the Scots have
never before lost five in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Irish Death Threat</TE>
<TE>   Northern Ireland and Cyprus played to a 0-0 tie in front of a
small crowd in Belfast, in a game that had no importance other than
to highlight the sectarian strife that still divides the country.</TE>
<TE>   Neil Lennon, the Glasgow Celtic midfielder who was to have
captained Northern Ireland, withdrew from the match after a Belfast
newspaper received a death threat against him from a paramilitary
group.</TE>
<TE>   Lennon, 31, is Catholic and has been the target of similar threats
before from Protestant sympathizers.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Boyce, the President of Northern Ireland's soccer federation,
blasted "the moron or morons who made this threat" and said
politicians were to blame.</TE>
<TE>   "I blame the politicians for everything that is going on," he
said. "This is a consequence of all that has been going on on the
streets of Belfast every night. These politicians play the blame game
and never take any responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   "Players of both religions did the country proud on the pitch
tonight, but once again Northern Ireland is hitting the headlines for
all the wrong reasons."</TE>
<TE>   Argentina Keeps Bielsa</TE>
<TE>   Argentina's soccer federation announced that Marcelo Bielsa will
return as coach despite the national team's worst World Cup
performance in more than three decades.</TE>
<TE>   Bielsa, 47, agreed to a new contract--at a lower salary--that will
last through the South American qualifying matches for the 2006 World
Cup in Germany and will be automatically extended if Argentina
qualifies.</TE>
<TE>   A Foreign Concept</TE>
<TE>   For the first time in the 114-year history of the English league,
foreign players outnumber British players at the highest level of the
game.</TE>
<TE>   According to figures released Wednesday, of the 220 players who
started for the 20 teams that kicked off the English Premier League
season on Saturday, 103 were British and 117 were from 38 other
countries.</TE>
<TE>   Baresi Quits Fulham</TE>
<TE>   Franco Baresi, whose string of honors included a World Cup victory
with Italy in 1982 and six Italian league championships with AC
Milan, resigned as director of football at Fulham.</TE>
<TE>   Baresi, 42, said the position was not what had been advertised in
June, when he agreed to work alongside French Coach Jean Tigana at
the English Premier League team.</TE>
<TE>   Wolff Under the Knife</TE>
<TE>   Chicago Fire and United States World Cup team forward Josh Wolff
underwent reconstructive surgery on his right knee at St. Joseph
Hospital in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Wolff tore his anterior cruciate ligament in a game against the
Kansas City Wizards Aug. 14. Wolff, 25, will be sidelined for up to
six months, the Fire said.</TE>

<HD>Sparks Ready Their Defense</HD>
<DH>WNBA: Defending champs gear up to face upset-minded Utah in
West finals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>If the Sparks are surprised to be in Utah instead of Houston to start
the WNBA Western Conference finals, they are doing their best to hide
it.</LD>
<LD>   The Sparks understand that every team is after what they have--the
WNBA title. And if Utah was good enough to upset the Comets, winning
the decisive game in Houston on Tuesday, the Starzz are good enough
to dethrone them, starting with Game 1 here tonight.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not looking back at the [regular season]," Lisa Leslie said.
"We beat Seattle when it counted. We've beaten Utah, but at the same
time they are very strong. But if we stay focused we can beat them
too.... These are the biggest games of our lives, starting with this
one on the road."</LD>
<TE>   Utah, making its first appearance in the conference finals, has a
6-15 record against the Sparks. But five of those victories have come
in the Delta Center, including last year when the Starzz ended the
Sparks' league-record 18-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   The Starzz have not had much luck against Houston or Los Angeles,
but upsetting the Comets gives Utah a surge of confidence it hasn't
had before.</TE>
<TE>   Veteran forward Natalie Williams, second-year guard Marie
Ferdinand and veteran guard Adrienne Goodson are pacing Utah's
playoff surge. Goodson and Williams each averaged 16.3 points against
Houston. Ferdinand led the Starzz in the series with a 17.3 average
and made the important free throws in the final two minutes that
secured Tuesday's victory.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest challenge facing us would be to control Marie
Ferdinand and Adrienne Goodson," Spark forward DeLisha Milton said.
"They're also a better team when [center] Margo Dydek comes to play.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't play individual defense on them; we have to play good
team defense to beat them."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Michael Cooper, knowing any loss in a short series is a big
loss, is concerned with how sharp the Sparks will be tonight.</TE>
<TE>   "In the past, going from experience, when we have a layoff you
don't have that 'game' conditioning," Cooper said. "Our practices
have been good, and mentally I don't worry about us. But we haven't
played in three days.</TE>
<TE>   "Against Utah we have been able to put points on the board, so
it's gonna have to be our defense against them. We have to come after
them with good, sound defense."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mwadi Mabika practiced with the Sparks for the first time since
spraining her left ankle during Saturday's victory over Seattle. She
pronounced herself fit to play tonight.</TE>
<TE>   "The time off [after the Seattle series] really helped her,"
Cooper said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WNBA referee Bill Stokes, who collapsed during Tuesday night's
playoff game between Utah and Houston and was hospitalized in
Houston, was upgraded from critical to serious Wednesday, according
to WNBA officials.</TE>
<TE>   Officials from the Memorial Hermann Southwest Hospital in Houston
would not comment on Stokes' illness.</TE>
<TE>   Just after halftime, Stokes, 56, fell to the floor near the
scorer's table. The game resumed after a 25-minute delay and Utah
won, 75-72, to win the series.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, WNBA officials stood behind their decision to resume
the game.</TE>
<TE>   WNBA president Val Ackerman "had a very difficult decision. She
consulted with the proper people--officials, the teams--and made a
decision she thought was best for the situation," league spokesman
Tim Frank said.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As much as Pete Sampras has struggled over the last two years, he has
managed to play terrific tennis during the U.S. Open.</LD>
<LD>   That won't be as easy this time, thanks to Wednesday's draw at New
York.</LD>
<LD>   The four-time Open champion, seeded 17th, could face 15th-seeded
Guillermo Canas in the third round, No. 3 Tommy Haas in the fourth,
followed by either No. 5 Tim Henman or No. 11 Andy Roddick. And
that's just to reach the semifinals.</LD>
<TE>   The year's final Grand Slam tournament starts Monday, and Serena
and Venus Williams will be expected to meet in a Grand Slam final for
the third consecutive time.</TE>
<TE>   Top-seeded Serena got a more favorable draw than Venus, the
two-time defending Open champion. No. 2-seeded Venus has Jennifer
Capriati, Monica Seles and Martina Hingis on her side of the field.</TE>
<TE>   The earliest Serena could face a top-20 player is in the fourth
round, against 15th-seeded Anastasia Myskina. Serena opens against
Corina Morariu, who recently returned to action after fighting
leukemia.</TE>
<TE>   The women's round-of-eight matchups could be: Serena Williams vs.
No. 8 Justine Henin; Venus Williams vs. Seles; No. 3 Capriati vs. No.
7 Kim Clijsters; and No. 4 Lindsay Davenport vs. No. 5 Jelena Dokic.</TE>
<TE>   Andre Agassi, seeded sixth, doesn't figure to be tested until a
possible fourth-round match against No. 9 Carlos Moya of Spain.</TE>
<TE>   Top-seed Lleyton Hewitt, who beat Sampras in last year's Open
final, might have some early tests.</TE>
<TE>   Hewitt, the Wimbledon champion, could meet hard-serving Greg
Rusedski in the second round. Rusedski beat Hewitt in Indianapolis
this month.</TE>
<TE>   Hewitt also could face No. 25 James Blake in the third round, the
same point at which they met during the 2001 Open when Blake pushed
Hewitt to five sets in a match marred by Hewitt's outburst at a
linesman that some interpreted as racially tinged.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Australian Open champion Thomas Johansson, seeded 12th,
said in Sweden that he will pull out because of a shoulder injury.</TE>
<TE>   The potential men's quarterfinals: Hewitt vs. No. 8 Albert Costa,
this year's French Open champion; No. 2 Marat Safin vs. No. 7 Juan
Carlos Ferrero; Haas vs. Henman; and No. 4 Yevgeny Kafelnikov vs.
Agassi.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hingis outlasted hard-hitting Alexandra Stevenson, 7-5, 6-4, to
advance to the quarterfinals of the Pilot Pen at New Haven, Conn.</TE>
<TE>   The fifth-seeded Hingis will next face Myskina, an unseeded
Russian who upset fourth-seeded Henin of Belgium, 7-6 (2), 6-2.</TE>
<TE>   Dokic, the third-seeded player, pulled out because of a sore
hamstring.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jan-Michael Gambill outlasted Stefan Koubek of Austria, 6-4, 3-6,
6-2, in the second round of the TD Waterhouse Cup at Commack, N.Y.
Second-seeded Roger Federer of Switzerland was upset by Nicolas Massu
of Chile, 6-7 (5), 6-1, 6-3.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>UCLA is taking baby steps, methodically preparing for its opener
against Colorado State on Sept. 7.</LD>
<LD>   Colorado State, meanwhile, opens tonight.</LD>
<LD>   The Rams visit Virginia in the Jim Thorpe Classic, the earliest
game in Division I history. Colorado State began practicing Aug. 1
and completed two-a-days a week ago.</LD>
<TE>   UCLA has practiced only since Saturday and began full-contact
workouts Wednesday. By the time the Bruins take the field at the Rose
Bowl, their opponent will have played twice--Colorado State faces
Colorado on Aug. 31.</TE>
<TE>   Although preparing his team is foremost on the mind of UCLA Coach
Bob Toledo, opening against an opponent with two games under its belt
concerns him.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll have game-speed experience and that's important," he
said. "They say you improve the most from the first game to the
second game. You hear that a lot."</TE>
<TE>   There are advantages for UCLA as well. Coaches will be able to
assemble a comprehensive scouting report on the Rams, who presumably
won't hold anything back in their intrastate rivalry against
Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Spencer Havner, a redshirt freshman from Nevada City, expected to
compete with senior Audie Attar at weakside linebacker.</TE>
<TE>   But Attar was dismissed from the team during the summer for
punching the younger brother of former UCLA quarterback Scott McEwan
in a bar, creating a void that Havner is prepared to fill.</TE>
<TE>   "My dad said that sometimes the door opens and you just have to
walk through it," Havner said. "I was real nervous after the first
practice, but I'm keeping my head straight and trying to have a good
fall camp."</TE>
<TE>   Havner's strength is his quickness on pass coverage. He gained 20
pounds over the summer--bulking to 235--under the guidance of new
strength coach Kim Sword to fend off blockers more effectively.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm much more able to pop linemen and get off them," Havner said.</TE>
<TE>   Havner must replace Ryan Nece, a four-year starter. The prospect
of filling the position for the next four years brings a smile.</TE>
<TE>   "I sat with Ryan a few times last year and just listened to
everything he had to say, about football and about other stuff," he
said. "Thinking that I could establish myself like that keeps me
motivated."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The clatter of pads and grunts and groans of tackling drills
permeated practice, but the most telling moment might have come on a
feathery pass delivered from freshman Drew Olson that hit receiver
Tab Perry in stride more than 40 yards downfield.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo turned to the sideline with a grin.</TE>
<TE>   The coach said he won't name a backup to Cory Paus until the
entire depth chart is released after a scrimmage at the Rose Bowl
next Wednesday, but Olson clearly is making a stronger impression
than redshirt freshman John Sciarra and freshman Matt Moore.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm more relaxed every day," Olson said. "Learning the playbook
is the biggest challenge and I'm getting more familiar with the
offense minute by minute."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Freshman receiver Marcedes Lewis was the first casualty in
full-contact drills, suffering a mild concussion. Tight end Mike
Seidman returned after sitting out one day because of a concussion.</TE>

<HD>Carroll Cuts Workload</HD>

<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>USC Coach Pete Carroll changed his team's two-a-day practice schedule
Wednesday to avoid further injuries.</LD>
<LD>   The Trojans, slowed by a number of hamstring and foot problems,
attended position meetings in the morning, then ran lightly during a
one-hour walk-through in helmets and shoulder pads. They broke for
lunch and returned for a two-hour afternoon practice in helmets and
shoulder pads before more meetings.</LD>
<LD>   Carroll said the Trojans would follow the same routine until next
week, when they begin final preparations for their Sept. 2 opener
against Auburn at the Coliseum.</LD>
<TE>   "We're much further ahead than we were last year at this time,"
said Carroll, who guided the Trojans to a 6-6 record in his first
season. "This will suit us well and help us a little bit with the
guys that have been nicked."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the cutback in contact, two starting defensive linemen,
end Kenechi Udeze and tackle Shaun Cody, spent the majority of
afternoon practice on the sideline trainer's table.</TE>
<TE>   Udeze hurt his left knee during a drill against the first-team
offense.</TE>
<TE>   "I planted real hard and my leg just came out from under me," said
Udeze, who added that he felt pain in the knee for the last week and
was already scheduled for an MRI exam Wednesday night.</TE>
<TE>   Cody hurt his right shin.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been kind of tight for a couple days," he said. "I felt the
tweak and I was like, 'Uh-oh. Hold on.' I'm going to see the doctor
and have some treatment. I'll be ready to go [today]."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans have practiced in full pads only three times since
beginning workouts Aug 12.</TE>
<TE>   They were in full pads Aug. 15 and during scrimmages Saturday and
Monday. With tailbacks Justin Fargas, Sultan McCullough and Darryl
Poston nursing hamstring injuries, the Trojans will continue to tread
lightly.</TE>
<TE>   "Until we get everybody back, I don't want to bang on the couple
guys that can run," Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A few offensive linemen are working at several spots and will
continue to shuffle when senior Zach Wilson returns from a foot
injury next week.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson will work at right guard, where he started last season, and
also at right tackle, Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Derek Graf appears to be making a push at center, freeing
junior Norm Katnik to work at right guard, where freshman Fred Matua
stepped in after Wilson's injury on the first day of training camp.
Junior Eric Torres, who started at right tackle last season, also is
getting work at right guard.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Senior cornerback Kevin Arbet, out for the season because of a
broken bone in his right foot, said he probably will undergo surgery
rather than let the injury heal with other treatment. Arbet was
scheduled to start at left cornerback and was first-team All-Pacific
Conference last season on special teams.... Darrell Rideaux, Jason
Mitchell, Malaefou MacKenzie, Keary Colbert, Justin Wyatt and Greig
Carlson handled kickoff returns.</TE>
<TE>   McCullough, Poston, fullback Chad Pierson and wide receiver Kareem
Kelly--all slowed because of hamstring injuries--ran lightly through
plays during the morning but did not participate in drills in the
afternoon.... Ricky Ervins, the last Trojan to rush for more than
1,200 yards (he gained 1,395 in 1989) attended the afternoon
practice.</TE>

EASTERN CONFERENCE</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   Update--The veteran Liberty team was pushed to the first-round
limit by Indiana, and gets to face another young, run-and-gun team as
its reward. Nonetheless, New York is expecting to reach the WNBA
finals for a fourth time. Washington, off since Saturday after
sweeping Charlotte, has to eliminate from its mind how New York
caught and passed it for the regular-season conference title and beat
the Mystics twice. Forward Chamique Holdsclaw averaged 20.5 points
and 12 rebounds in the Charlotte series. She will draw the same kind
of defensive attention the Liberty applied to Indiana's Tamika
Catchings. It will be up to role players Stacey Dales-Schuman, Coco
Miller and Vicky Bullett to break through the collection of zones
that frustrated Catchings and Indiana the final two games. Washington
has to find a way to contain forward Tamika Whitmore, who averaged
19.6 points in the Indiana series and looked unstoppable in the low
post.</TE>

<TE>   Sparks vs. Utah</TE>
<TE>   Season series--Sparks, 3-0.</TE>
<TE>   First game--Tonight at Utah, 7 PDT, ESPN2.</TE>
<TE>   Update--Utah legitimized its 20-win regular season by taking out
Houston in the first round, winning its first playoff series. The
Starzz now go after another longtime Western Conference tormentor in
the Sparks. But the Sparks present different problems than the
Comets; Houston was the lowest-scoring team in the playoffs while the
Sparks are the highest-scoring team. In addition, the Starzz's
strength--a wide-open game--is the Sparks' strength. Utah guard Marie
Ferdinand and center Margo Dydek sparkled in the Houston series, and
Natalie Williams was dominant in the final two games. Lisa Leslie was
the focal point for the Sparks in their first-round series win over
Seattle, and she will be again. Game 1 should be a test of how much
energy the Starzz can muster after Tuesday's dramatic victory over
Houston, and how out of rhythm the Sparks are on offense after being
off since Saturday.</TE>

<HD>White House Must Reject Navy's Assault on the Oceans</HD>
<DH>Environmental act should not be weakened.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN-MICHEL COUSTEAU and JOEL R. REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>Jean-Michel Cousteau is founder and president of Ocean
Futures Society in Santa Barbara. Joel R. Reynolds is a senior
attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council in Los Angeles.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oil drilling in coastal waters from California to Florida. Underwater
explosives testing near the Channel Islands National Marine
Sanctuary. Ocean dumping off the Eastern Seaboard. And trawlers
scouring increasingly depleted fishing grounds from Alaska to Maine.
For more than 30 years, these activities and countless others like
them have been illegal unless there was full public disclosure and a
thorough review of their environmental impacts.</LD>
<LD>   Now that could change. Under a proposal being considered by the
Bush administration, the federal law that has been the cornerstone of
the protection of our environment--including our oceans--is under
attack.</LD>
<LD>   Considered the "Magna Carta of environmental regulation" in the
United States since it was signed into law by President Nixon in
1969, the National Environmental Policy Act imposes this common-sense
requirement: If a federal agency is thinking of taking an action or
starting a program that could significantly affect the environment,
it must consider those effects first. Under the act, a federal agency
is required to identify the environmental impacts of a proposed
action, consider reasonable alternatives and identify ways to reduce
the harm. This information must then be made available for public
comment.</LD>
<TE>   Earlier this month, under pressure from the Navy and the
Department of Justice, five federal agencies convened behind closed
doors to consider a Navy proposal that the National Environmental
Policy Act no longer be applied to any activity or program--no matter
its environmental risks--in waters beyond three nautical miles from
our shores. Activities within this part of the  so-called "exclusive
economic zone," or EEZ, of the United States, not to mention
activities on the high seas--would no longer receive public
environmental review.</TE>
<TE>   The EEZ, which extends 200 nautical miles from our shores, covers
more than 3 million square miles of rich ocean habitat and is home to
a wealth of fish, whales, dolphins, sea turtles and other marine
life. Under the Navy's proposal, these resources would no longer be
subject to the "inconvenience" of public disclosure and environmental
review.</TE>
<TE>   According to a Navy "point paper" leaked to the media, both the
Council on Environmental Quality, the federal agency charged with
issuing regulations under the act, and the Justice Department during
the Clinton administration "pressed to apply [the act] worldwide." As
recently as this summer, that was still the position of the council
and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the agency
responsible for protecting our oceans. And that is how the act has
been applied for years by the federal courts.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, according to sources at the meeting, the five
federal agencies agreed with the Navy that it was time to loosen
protections afforded under the environmental policy act. Most
important to the Navy--and the immediate reason for its demand that
the federal government's policy be so drastically restricted--this
would mean that an environmental review might not be required before
testing or deployment of powerful new active sonar devices around the
world, devices that could expose hundreds of thousands of square
miles to potentially harmful sound levels.</TE>
<TE>   One of these sonars has been identified by the Navy as the cause
of mass strandings involving four species of whales in the Bahamas.
Yet in federal court in Los Angeles, in a case brought by the Natural
Resources Defense Council and others, the Navy is now arguing that
its program for testing and developing this sonar, and many others
like it, is not subject to environmental scrutiny under the
environmental policy act.</TE>
<TE>   If the law is weakened, however, this change would affect far more
than the Navy. It would affect coastal communities, commercial and
recreational fishing, beachgoers, scuba divers and anyone else who
depends on the health of our ocean resources for their livelihood,
recreation or quality of life.</TE>
<TE>   All of us depend on clean ocean waters full of species diversity
and free from oil spills, dangerous chemicals, harmful sounds and
other pollution. That has been an essential part of what Congress
sought to accomplish when it enacted the 1969 law.</TE>
<TE>   Never has protection of the oceans been more critical. With
depleted fish populations, endangered whales and sea turtles, growing
ocean "dead zones," toxic algal blooms and high-intensity sonar
systems that can bombard ocean basins with sound, we cannot afford to
dispense with the protections of the National Environmental Policy
Act and the public accountability that it guarantees.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush must reject the Navy's ill-conceived and unlawful
invitation to weaken the protection of our oceans.</TE>

<HD>Raining Zeros in a Season of Scandal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ARIANNA HUFFINGTON</AU>
<BD>Arianna Huffington writes a syndicated column.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I'm tracking a new phenomenon called "scandal fatigue.'' It sets in
when the corporate crime rate gets too high and the numbers being
bandied about become too boggling to get your mind around. For
instance, I was plenty angry when WorldCom announced that it had
misstated its earnings by $3.7 billion. Then it looked through the
books again and realized the amount was actually $7 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Was I supposed to be twice as ticked off? Or were there just too
many zeros to grasp? The reason our eyes start to glaze over at a
certain point is that we lack what T.S. Eliot called "an objective
correlative"--a way of relating to something as abstract and
conceptual as a 7 followed by nine zeros.</LD>
<LD>   How can we get our outrage meters set to the proper scale? Here's
one way: The total amount of sweetheart insider loans doled out to
John Rigas (Adelphia), Bernie Ebbers (WorldCom), Stephen Hilbert
(Conseco), Dennis Kozlowski (Tyco) and Kenneth Lay (Enron), $3.9
billion.</LD>
<TE>   With $3.9 billion, you could help Habitat for Humanity build
83,691 homes for America's homeless; send 35,583 poor but deserving
students to Harvard Business School; buy 390 million tickets to see
"Austin Powers in Goldmember''; loan United Airlines the $1.8 billion
it says it needs to avoid bankruptcy, twice (or you could just flush
the money down the toilet--the results would be the same); fund the
greatly increased annual budget of the Securities and Exchange
Commission for five years.</TE>
<TE>   Or consider this: According to Fortune magazine, the total amount
of money raked in by corporate executives selling company stock even
while their companies crashed and burned was roughly $66 billion.
With that, you could fund the annual budget of the FBI for 16 years;
give 74 times what the United States currently gives in foreign aid
to all of sub-Saharan Africa; cover the entire $25 billion that the
U.S. has spent fighting the war against terrorism in Afghanistan,
with enough left over to give Afghans more than two times their
average yearly income; pay President Bush's $400,000 salary for
165,000 years (although, if he's anything like his dad, you'll only
be on the hook until 2004); pay the New York sales tax on former Tyco
CEO Kozlowski's artwork--plus buy a wing in the Metropolitan Museum
of Art.</TE>
<TE>   Or try this on for size: The total loss in market value of
WorldCom, Tyco, Qwest, Enron and Global Crossing: $427 billion. With
$427 billion, you could fund the United Nations for the next 263
years and still have $164 billion left over for famine relief and
peacekeeping missions; get Argentina back on its feet by paying off
it external debt three times over; pay the combined salaries of every
player in baseball for 237 years. Although I don't know why you
would. They'd still disappoint you and go on strike.</TE>

<HD>'XXX' Marks the Patriotic Spot</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES P. PINKERTON</AU>
<BD>James P. Pinkerton writes a column for Newsday in New
York. E-mail: pinkerto@ix.netcom.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What does the success of the movie "XXX" tell us about the nation? Or
at least about those youngish Americans who admire Vin Diesel, the
muscled, tattooed, head-shaved star of the film?</LD>
<LD>   The film's popularity, most notably, suggests that the Sept. 11-
inspired reconciliation of punk and patriot continues.</LD>
<LD>   The British philosopher Alfred North Whitehead said that to
understand a culture, one must study its second-rate literature.
First-rate stuff, he said, is too good. It offers transcendent truths
applicable to all times, to all places; that's why Shakespeare still
holds up, centuries and oceans away from Olde England. By contrast,
second-rate literature is rooted in the moment, so it's a cultural
snapshot. And if second-rate books are a window, then third-rate
movies provide a broad vista.</LD>
<TE>   Despite its suggestive title, "XXX" is not about pornography; the
story line is more "The Dirty Dozen" meets James Bond meets
Generation X. Indeed, the action protagonist, XXX--"Triple X" to his
crew--is far more abstemious than 007. In night clubs, he orders
plain cranberry juice; he lectures others about the evils of smoking.</TE>
<TE>   Seemingly, he's against anything that would get in the way of
physical fitness; he enjoys a slacker lifestyle--no evident job--and
yet nothing else is slack about him. In fact, his iron-pumped body
speaks to a more self-disciplined regimen, plus maybe a steroid or
two, than that of most he-men in the past.</TE>
<TE>   And while XXX is boastfully uneducated--he defends his age group's
affection for videogames by saying "it's the only education we
got"--he is still techno-savvy; he steals a car as a stunt so he can
show the theft on his Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, he starts out anti-heroically; forcibly recruited into
espionage, he tells his spy boss that "if you're going to send
someone to save the world, make sure they like it the way it is." But
just as most Americans were jolted away from thoughts of
multicultural moral equivalence after 9/11, so XXX comes to the
realization that the United States must be defended against
terrorists wielding weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   He declares: "I've risked my life for stupid reasons. This is the
first one that ever made sense." Indeed, a giant American flag--the
kind that John Wayne would've been proud to salute--figures in the
film's heroic climax.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, underneath the tattoos and the rad 'tude, XXX is
yet another eager enemy of evil-doers. Like Superman before him, he's
ready to dedicate his life to the fight for truth, justice and the
American Way.</TE>
<TE>   As movie industry veteran Steve Greenwald, who once made films
with Dino De Laurentiis, observed, "Hollywood always responds to the
zeitgeist, and especially after 9/11 that translates into
feel-good-about-the-USA pictures." Also, he added, "heroes bringing
down evil empires are once again in vogue--and so in demand."</TE>
<TE>   Few Americans over 25 will see "XXX." But if they do, they will
come away confident that the next generation--born after the fiasco
of Vietnam--is ready to do its patriotic part in, say, the war on
terror.</TE>

<HD>Smoky View of Libertarianism</HD>
<DH>They've abused health--now they abuse philosophy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NORAH VINCENT</AU>
<BD>Norah Vincent is a New York writer. Her Web site is
www. norahvincent.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Smoking crusaders like to think of themselves as big libertarians.
"It's my right to puff where I like," they rave. "What I do with and
to my body is none of the government's business."</LD>
<LD>   That is the same tired, specious bit of civics they flung at
then-New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in January 1995 when he
signed into law the Smoke-Free Air Act, which prohibited smokers from
lighting up in the dining areas of all restaurants seating more than
35 and confined smoking to bar areas.</LD>
<LD>   Now smoking fiends are trotting out their wounded liberties again
and flinging them at the feet of Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who wants
to go one step further than his predecessor and ban smoking at all
the city's restaurants and bars. This comes after a hefty and much
decried hike in the city's cigarette tax. The jump from 8 cents to
$1.50 per pack has driven the price of some brands to more than $7
per pack.</LD>
<TE>   Smokers are not in the mood for more grief. And they're not the
only ones. Despite evidence to the contrary, restaurateurs and bar
owners maintain that the proposed law would decimate their
clienteles.</TE>
<TE>   In California, where a similar law has been in effect since 1998,
the state's Board of Equalization reported in 2001 that sales had
risen 7.4% at restaurants and bars since the smoking ban took effect.
And in a Los Angeles County Health Department survey in 2001, 55% of
bar customers said they enjoyed smoke-free bars more than
smoke-filled ones.</TE>
<TE>   Still the chorus of boos goes on in New York. Enter the populist
rhetoricians of the tobacco lobby, whose only hope of squashing
Bloomberg's sensible policy lies in distorting libertarianism. How?</TE>
<TE>   First, by ignoring one of the central tenets of libertarian
philosophy; that is, the oft-cited adage that my right to throw my
fist ends at the tip of my neighbor's nose. An oldie but goodie. I
can do what I like with my own body, true, so long as--and here's the
part sophists omit--what I do doesn't harm anyone else.</TE>
<TE>   Secondhand smoke is toxic to bystanders. The nonsmoker's right to
patronize his favorite bar while breathing freely trumps the smoker's
need to slowly asphyxiate herself and her fellow patrons. Sure,
nonsmoking patrons could go elsewhere, but they shouldn't have to.
Besides, we all have our favorite bars, places that are convenient
geographically or demographically. The latter is especially true of
gay people. Often, going elsewhere just isn't an option.</TE>
<TE>   Second, another keystone of libertarianism is the notion that
freedoms come with responsibilities attached. Being free doesn't mean
you get to do whatever you want; that's license. It also doesn't mean
that you don't have to pay up when whatever you've insisted is your
right to do turns sour in the doing.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg's proposed tax on cigarettes was meant to shore up New
York City's galloping debt, but it's also arguably a way of forcing
smokers to take some fiscal responsibility for contributing more than
their fair share to a national health problem.</TE>
<TE>   While it is true that smokers, when they smoke alone, harm only
themselves, it is also true that the many diseases to which they
often succumb because they smoke cost the public millions (in both
insurance premiums and health-care services).</TE>
<TE>   Smokers, like so many of us, are mavericks when they're healthy
but parasites when they're not. They trash their bodies and then
expect the rest of us to pick up the pieces, as well as most of the
tab for the damage they've so defiantly done to themselves.</TE>
<TE>   If Bloomberg's proposal were truly fair, it would put most of the
city's cigarette tax directly into the coffers of the American Cancer
Society or, better yet, the many organizations that fund research and
support facilities that treat the self-inflicted sick. But that'll
never happen.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, smokers should shut up and, like true libertarians,
confine their poisonous vices to their own bodies.</TE>

<LD>Thirteen million people are facing a famine in southern Africa, a
condition stoked by decades of bad government and by a drought more
severe than any other afflicting the region since 1992. No matter the
cause, these millions need food.</LD>
<LD>   Seventy-five thousand tons of corn, beans and a soy blend for
malnourished children are on the high seas now, heading from U.S.
grain reserves to Africa's eastern coast. An additional 190,000 tons
are ready to go, according to Andrew Natsios, who directs the Bush
administration's international humanitarian assistance programs. By
December, U.S. aid to the region is expected to amount to about half
of what the World Food Program estimates is required.</LD>
<LD>   Whether a mouthful will actually reach the hungriest is an open
question. Leaders in three countries--Zambia, Zimbabwe and
Mozambique--say they may not accept U.S. aid because it contains
genetically modified corn. The leaders fear that if their citizens
plant the biotech grain, it could cross-contaminate other crops,
making them unacceptable to the European Union.</LD>
<TE>   This year, the EU voted in favor of an outright ban on the
importation of all food that the importing country could not prove to
be free of genetically modified ingredients. However, the ban, widely
denounced as costly and impractical, won't become law unless it
passes a further vote.</TE>
<TE>   The African leaders are not in a position to refuse donations from
the United States, which provides about 70% of food aid to southern
Africa. They should see that the clear, short-term health needs of
their peoples outweigh fuzzier, long-term economic concerns.</TE>
<TE>   European leaders are also exacerbating the problem by promoting
vague fears of so-called Frankenfoods. The European leaders, as well
as officials of the World Health Organization, should distinguish
between the legitimate concern that biotech foods might alter the
ecosystem (last week, for example, Ohio State University researchers
released a study showing that such foods encouraged the growth of
pesticide-resistant weeds) and the bogus, unproved assertion that
biotech foods somehow harm humans.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the Bush administration's Natsios, who plans to leave
Friday for a tour of famine-ravaged southern Africa, should consider
the obvious: shipping nonbiotech grains to the three nations most
worried about them.</TE>
<TE>   This is possible because some U.S. grain suppliers already have
procedures in place to segregate biotech crops from nonbiotech crops.
All sides can then settle the Frankenfood issues later.</TE>
<TE>   There's no reason why the famine in southern Africa has to turn
into a humanitarian disaster. There's food to feed the hungry if
self-righteous politics would just get out of the way.</TE>

<LD>Few will mourn the Georgia congressional primary defeats Tuesday of
bombastic liberal Rep. Cynthia A. McKinney or conservative firebrand
Rep. Bob Barr. The two were united only in their often quirky
extremism, what with McKinney's conspiracy theories about the Bush
administration and Barr hoping to abolish the Internal Revenue
Service. But the fact that the primary campaign between Democrat
McKinney and Denise Majette became a proxy for the Middle East
conflict is cause for concern.</LD>
<LD>   McKinney's pro-Palestinian stands have made her popular with Arab
Americans, who have contributed heavily to her congressional war
chest over the last five years. But pro- Israel supporters this time
funneled campaign contributions to successful challenger Majette, a
former judge.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, the funding pattern leaves the impression that the
conflict in the Middle East is intruding on local congressional races
and competing with the local issues that deserve to be debated in an
urban district near Atlanta.</LD>
<TE>   McKinney did herself no favors by stating that President Bush may
have had prior knowledge of Sept. 11 and that White House associates
stood to profit from the tragedy. She has never retreated from this
statement. Nor did she win many points when, in 1991, as a member of
the Georgia House, she denounced the first President Bush for
attacking Iraq after that nation invaded Kuwait. Most of her
colleagues exited the chamber.</TE>
<TE>   In June, another Middle East proxy race came out similarly.</TE>
<TE>   Alabama Democratic Rep. Earl F. Hilliard, who was sympathetic to
the Palestinian cause, was defeated in a slugfest campaign by Artur
Davis. Davis raised sizable funds from Jewish donors living outside
Alabama. In both contests, both candidates were African American, but
the campaigns carried an undercurrent of Muslim-Jewish tension.</TE>
<TE>   Litmus tests imposed by the National Rifle Assn. or
abortion-rights and anti-abortion groups are nothing new. They are
harmful in that they erase the middle ground, but they are familiar,
long-debated issues with a local component. The prospect of Middle
East politics distorting congressional races in a much larger way is
more worrisome.</TE>

<HD>August's Inflated News</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This week's videotapes showing Al Qaeda poisoning dogs and training
for terrorism were trumpeted by Cable News Network as exclusives,
over and over--at least until another network started airing one of
them. CNN also said it did not pay for the tapes. Later it said it
did.</LD>
<LD>   But aside from exclusivity and money, the tapes must be incredibly
important because they're broadcast endlessly, right? Not
necessarily.</LD>
<LD>   August often is slow for the media, with newsmakers being out of
town. Sometimes there are stories in August that would not be
featured as prominently in November.</LD>
<TE>   Remember last August, with the frenzy over Rep. Gary A. Condit
(D-Ceres) and the then-missing former intern from his district,
Chandra Levy? How about nine Augusts ago, when Heidi Fleiss was all
over the newspapers and television screens after she was accused of
procuring prostitutes for celebrities? The Al Qaeda tapes at least
compare favorably in news value with either of these.</TE>
<TE>   This week, CNN is showing excerpts from the 64 tapes it bought,
selected from more than 100 offered by a seller it did not identify.
Monday's video featured, again and again, short and long versions of
the moment-by-moment poisoning of a dog, apparently the subject of
testing of chemical agents to see whether they could be made into
weapons. It was a sight that no doubt had parents everywhere lunging
for the off button. On Tuesday, we saw Osama bin Laden conducting a
press conference with Pakistani journalists several years ago.
Wednesday's installment showed techniques for kidnapping or
assassination. Today is billed as explosives-manufacturing day.</TE>
<TE>   Experts in terrorism say the tapes do not contain startling new
information, though they are a reminder of the danger of the
organization that declared war on the United States and caused havoc
Sept. 11. The videos did represent a coup for CNN, which had seen its
ratings decline thanks to stiff competition from other cable
networks.</TE>
<TE>   After CNN acknowledged it paid for the tapes, reportedly about
$30,000, it insisted that none of the money went to Al Qaeda or
anyone connected with Bin Laden. It did not say how it could know
that. CBS News, which also showed a version of the tape of the
poisoned dog, said it too paid a fee.</TE>
<TE>   Some tapes were made several years ago, and at least one was made
on or just after Sept. 11. They are good television, or, as the CNN
anchors keep saying, "fascinating bits of tape." They also may help
to identify Al Qaeda members. However, CNN says it registered only a
modest increase in ratings, so folks at the beach apparently
concluded they did not have to rush inside and turn on the set.</TE>

<HD>Reparations: Start With a Public Apology</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As an American who has for years strongly supported reparations for
slavery, I must admit that Earl Ofari Hutchinson has shed new light
on some aspects of this issue ("It's Not Time Yet for Slavery
Reparations," Commentary, Aug. 20). Hutchinson is right to point out
that our country is not yet mature enough to support the reparations
program as beautifully outlined in "The Debt" by Randall Robinson.</LD>
<LD>   Some assert that my opinion does not matter because I am white.
However, I believe that a public apology from the U.S.
government--for allowing slavery and its toxic legacy to flourish for
250-plus years--would be an excellent start on the road toward
reparations. If nothing else, it might help begin the emotional
healing of many American blacks who want to feel included in the
American dream.</LD>
<LD>   I am ashamed and disgusted that the greatest nation in the world
has yet to apologize or show genuine remorse for one of the darkest
chapters in human history. If we can't even say we're sorry, how can
we ever hope to civilly discuss the right thing to do?</LD>

<TE>   I sincerely hope Hutchinson is playing devil's advocate. This
movement is not a matter of a "guilt-trip" for anyone who is not
guilty. It is a movement aimed at inducing a government to settle its
accounts. Whether the public is willing to buy in or not, fair is
fair, just is just. Public opinion is often at variance with justice.
This is not a frivolous proposal about money. This is about a system
that has denied life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness to a race
of people based solely on the fact that they are Africans and
descendants of Africans.</TE>
<TE>   Bondage durante vitae in North America was not an
equal-opportunity proposition. It was for blacks only. The black
codes of the North and South were for blacks only. To name only a few
examples, loss of life and property in the New York draft riots
should be compensated; loss of life and property in Rosewood, Fla.,
should be compensated; back pay for millions of hours of
uncompensated labor by millions of sons and daughters of Africa
should be compensated. This litany goes on. So if not now, when is it
time to rectify at least some of this melange of issues?</TE>

still fly the flag. They should be easy to find.</TE>

<HD>Pedestrian Deaths and the Race Card</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Times has once again displayed an ability to play the race card
like Heifetz played the violin--often and to perfection. I refer to
your report on pedestrian deaths in Los Angeles County ("Inequities
in Pedestrian Deaths," Aug. 19), where a bar graph of the victims'
race is prominently displayed along with a map pinpointing the
accident locations. As a casual observer, I would suspect that a
victim's age might be a more important determining characteristic in
the study of pedestrian fatalities, to say nothing of factors such as
time of day, month or season of the year, traffic counts at the
accident location, type of motor vehicles involved, etc.</LD>
<LD>   As a longtime reader, I have come to the conclusion that Times
staffers and editors are firmly convinced that race is the
determining characteristic of every single element of the human
condition. Please, for once, give us all a pass on the race card. I
think we've all been dealt one too many hands from the bottom of that
deck.</LD>

<TE>   When I learned how to drive in New York, I was taught that the
motorist is always at fault in a vehicle-pedestrian accident. It is
shocking to me that a careless commuter can kill a 77-year-old Army
veteran in a crosswalk and not get cited, much less keep his license.</TE>
<TE>   Do our laws really imply that a man's life is less important than
getting to work on time? Instead of handing out jaywalking tickets,
perhaps Los Angeles County should begin to cite the motorists who
endanger others on city streets.</TE>

<HD>Stock Market Insurance Is a Losing Proposition</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Frederick Lynch obviously learned nothing from the savings and loan
crisis and the moral hazard of unfunded, unlimited liability ("A
Stock Panic Shut-Off Valve," Commentary, Aug. 19). This kind of
insurance would only further encourage irresponsible speculation and
function as a form of corporate welfare, and insiders and big-money
banks would benefit the most. No, thanks. As a taxpayer I already
bailed out J.P. Morgan and Citigroup recently with the IMF loan to
Brazil. And no one asked for permission or sent me a thank-you card.</LD>
<LD>   The commentary reflects typical boomer narcissism: capitalist when
winning, socialist when losing. If boomers want 401(k) insurance, it
is already available in the form of covered calls, index puts, gold
or bear-market funds. If boomers find this too expensive or
complicated, I would suggest cash or CDs. No one has the right to
gamble at the public's expense, and a generation that professes so
much love for their children should think twice about leaving them
with an impossible-to-pay national debt.</LD>

<LD>By now even a few Republicans may think Bill Simon may not have been
the best choice for a candidate to run against Gov. Gray Davis. Not
because of his lack of experience; he could do as good or better a
job than what we have seen since Davis took office. It's more a sense
that in California no one could compete against the money machine
Davis has assembled.</LD>
<LD>   But in Simon's favor, there is one thing for sure: He would spend
the next term trying to run the state of California, not raising
money to run for president of the United States.</LD>

<HD>'Employee Owners' Flying in Turbulence</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Times states that United Airlines employees "must start thinking
like owners and recognize the need for painful concessions"
(editorial, Aug. 13). As one of those so-called "employee owners," I
am sure I do not speak only for myself in calling this a load of
bunk. Now, Jack Creighton, chairman of United and its parent, UAL
Corp., threatens to blackmail us with bankruptcy protection for the
airline if we don't cough up billions, and pronto (Business, Aug.
15.) Under the hoax of "employee ownership" in 1994, UAL pilots and
workers forked over $4.5 billion in concessions to the carrier for
stock, roughly at a purchase price of $40 a share. This included
going eight subsequent years without a raise as the carrier garnered
record profit. Then the bubble burst. Now the stock hovers above a
buck, after peaking at more than $100 a share five years ago. Of
course, we couldn't sell it and watched it plummet, like Enron, to
where it is now. Meanwhile, the real owners and top officers of the
airline raked in the lucre.</LD>
<TE>   Real owners get bonuses when they slash wages, downsize work
forces and increase productivity--at the expense of labor. Why should
we cut our own wages, gut benefits, work harder and longer? UAL
employees should stop trying to think like the owners we never were
or will be and start acting like the workers we are. The U.S.
economic crisis, including in the airline sector, shows a great
divide between labor and the real owners. Understanding this fact is
the beginning of wisdom for workers who want to defend our rights
against the current and coming pillage.</TE>

<LD>"An Energy Shock Absorber" (editorial, Aug. 19) implied that what
holds back alternative energy is a conspiracy of corporate interests.
Nothing could be further from the truth. The problem with
photoelectric cells and wind power is that neither will "scale up."
To replace a 1,000-megawatt gas-fired power plant would require 200
square miles of photoelectric cells. Their power output at night is
zero.</LD>
<LD>   Although more promising than photoelectric cells, wind power also
does not scale up; and on windless days, power output is zero.
Because electricity is used as it is generated, times of zero output
are disastrous for the electric grid. In a future of diminishing oil
and gas there will be only one power source to turn to--a Faustian
bargain--nuclear power.</LD>

<LD>Re "End of the Road for the Olds," Aug. 19: Growing up in an insecure
and frightening world (the Depression, World War II, the Cold War), I
looked around for symbols of security, safety and reassurance. Being
a car-crazy kid, I filled my world with the makes and models of
American style and ingenuity. I watched "my friends" grow in
sophistication and styling, marveling at the ingenuity of the agile
minds that made the changes possible. In 1947 I was thrilled by the
"coming or going" Studebaker, in '49 with the "step-down design" of
the Hudson and the "tear-drop" Nash. Packard was always tops; just
"ask the man who owns one."</LD>
<LD>   Kaiser and Frazer evaporated quickly. One by one all these old
friends disappeared and I felt a hole in my life. But there remained
the steadfast nameplates and hood ornaments to carry on. Then DeSoto
disappeared, followed by Rambler, Talon and, so regrettably, one of
the core group of American cars, Plymouth. Now, after 105 years, our
original innovation, Oldsmobile, is slated for the ax. I grieve, and
I imagine there are many my age who feel the same. I recall the old
adage, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." Well, General Motors sure
fixed the Olds. Amen.</LD>

<TE>   Re the demise of the Oldsmobile: I remember not being sure whether
to laugh or cry at the ad slogan, "This is not your father's
Oldsmobile." My father had a 1961 Dynamic 88 convertible. It was
white with a black top and a red-and-white interior. That car was
sleek, powerful and a pleasure to drive. I have long wished I could
have my father's Oldsmobile back. The newer ones never inspired me.</TE>

<LD>I am dumbfounded at the endless horror expressed by television news
reporters and other talking heads in response to the heart-rending
scenes of small dogs being cruelly subjected to poison gases and
dying quite horribly in the Middle East before our eyes (Aug. 19).
Where are all these horrified newspersons when it is common knowledge
that all our major universities, medical research facilities and
teaching hospitals routinely commit even more despicable and terrible
tests on every sort of animal, including our nearest mammal relative,
apes and monkeys, each day?</LD>
<LD>   Thousands and thousands of helpless animals have been tortured and
killed in the name of "helping humans" in the last 70 years here in
the U.S. What a hypocritical bit of reportage. With all the publicity
engendered by animal activists, these reporters can't be that stupid.
Maybe these tapes will shine a light on the heartlessness going on in
our own country.</LD>

<HD>2 Plead Guilty to Torture</HD>
<DH>Courts: Burbank couple admit beating their 12-year-old
daughter. Husband gets 17 years, four months in prison. Wife expected
to receive a 23-year sentence.</DH>

<LD>A Burbank couple have pleaded guilty to charges of torturing their
12-year-old daughter for at least two years, beating her and feeding
her table scraps.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Janice Croft sentenced
Marcus Allan, 44, to 17 years and four months in state prison.</LD>
<LD>   His wife, Erlinda Reyes Allan, 39, is expected to be sentenced to
23 years at a hearing Oct. 30.</LD>
<TE>   During jury selection Monday afternoon, the two agreed to plead
guilty in exchange for a reduced sentence. The couple, charged with
one count each of torture, child abuse and corporal injury to a
child, could have faced life sentences on the torture count alone.</TE>
<TE>   The couple's decision to plead guilty was a victory for the girl,
prosecutors said, because it spared her from having to testify
against her parents.</TE>
<TE>   "She testified at a preliminary hearing, and it was very traumatic
and painful," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Cynthia Nakao.</TE>
<TE>   In December 2000, the parents told police officers responding to a
report of child abuse that the girl was living in her mother's native
Philippines.</TE>
<TE>   Police were suspicious and began to question residents of the
working-class neighborhood near Burbank Airport. An ice cream truck
driver told police that she had seen a girl with a split lip earlier
in the day.</TE>
<TE>   Officers found the girl--who appeared to be 7 or 8 years
old--bruised and malnourished, hiding near her home.</TE>
<TE>   The parents were arrested and the child was taken into custody by
the county Department of Children and Family Services.</TE>

<LD>Detectives searched for three men Wednesday suspected of shooting a
woman to death at a La Puente bookkeeping business in a robbery that
netted a money collection box for abandoned Nicaraguan children.</LD>
<LD>   The body of Carmen M. Castro, 51, was found about 3:30 p.m.
Tuesday after neighbors reported hearing gunfire and an eyewitness
saw three men running from the office in the 15500 block of Amar
Road, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department investigators said.</LD>
<LD>   "There is no indication she put up any kind of struggle. It was a
ruthless murder," said Sheriff's Lt. Daniel Rosenberg.</LD>
<TE>   "It was a robbery. They stole a big container of nickels and dimes
for Nicaraguan Children's Relief Foundation on the counter.</TE>
<TE>   "It was clearly marked for the children. It's incredible."</TE>
<TE>   Castro, of Fontana, suffered shots to the upper body. She was
alone in the office at the time. "It wasn't the typical establishment
for a robbery," Rosenberg said.</TE>
<TE>   The charitable donations were kept in a Plexiglas container with a
lock, brimming with coins and bills, and plainly visible to visitors
to C. Castro &amp; Associates and passersby.</TE>
<TE>   Rosenberg said he does not know how much money may have been
taken. Apparently nothing else was taken, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The three men were last seen heading south on Ballista Avenue on
foot, Rosenberg said.</TE>
<TE>   There was no indication of a getaway vehicle, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are in shock. We aren't ready to talk," said a co-worker at
the Castro family business. Family members reached in Fontana
declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Eyewitnesses described two of the men leaving the business as 18
to 20 years old, with medium builds, said Deputy Scott Butler.</TE>
<TE>   The third was described as 20 to 22 years old and weighing more
than 200 pounds, Butler said.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone with information is asked to call Rosenberg or Dets. Brian
Steinwand or Linda Muse at (323) 890-5500.</TE>

<HD>Some Fear Bumpy Ride During Street's Makeover</HD>
<DH>Traffic: The overhaul of Santa Monica Boulevard will
disrupt business, some say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Separately, "little" and "big" Santa Monica boulevards in West Los
Angeles create an unsightly traffic morass.</LD>
<LD>   The parallel roads are often gridlocked, and the intersections can
be dangerous and confusing. An abandoned railroad right of way, lined
with massive billboards, runs down the median, giving the corridor a
cluttered, shabby look.</LD>
<LD>   But a $68-million face lift is designed to combine the two roads
into a tree-lined boulevard with a bike path and a landscaped median
that designers promise will resemble the great boulevards of Europe.</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles is expected to award a construction contract for the
2.5-mile project between the San Diego Freeway and Beverly Hills next
month, and construction is slated to begin in January. The project,
when completed in 2005, is expected to beautify one of the city's
most congested corridors while improving traffic capacity by 20%.</TE>
<TE>   But some business owners along the commercial corridor are worried
that construction noise, dust and parking headaches may drive away
customers. Nearby homeowners fear that motorists who normally take
Santa Monica Boulevard to work will be tempted to cut through
adjacent neighborhoods to avoid construction tie-ups.</TE>
<TE>   "We are concerned because our area is laid out in a grid pattern,
and it would be very attractive for people to cut through to avoid
the congestion," said Bob Cimiluca, president of the Westwood South
of Santa Monica Boulevard Homeowners Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles city officials say they are planning efforts to ease
such worries. "Our goal is to make sure the impacts will be minimal,"
said Cora Jackson-Fossett, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of
Public Works.</TE>
<TE>   Plans to remake Santa Monica Boulevard and its smaller twin have
been debated for years.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1970s, the California Department of Transportation
suggested building a Beverly Hills freeway along the route. The idea
was killed because of strong public protest. In 1992, the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority purchased the abandoned
railroad line.</TE>
<TE>   An MTA plan in 1994 to replace the two streets with a 10-lane road
with two exclusive bus lanes was also killed because neighbors said
the project looked too much like a freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the thoroughfare carries 40,000 to 60,000 vehicles per day.
Traffic experts predict 80,000 a day by 2020.</TE>
<TE>   Motorists crossing the road must traverse "double"
intersections--one each for "little" and "big" Santa Monica
boulevards. Transportation experts say these intersections are
dangerous and confusing, causing daily gridlock. The makeover would
eliminate the double intersections, reducing traffic delays by as
much as 48%, according to MTA studies.</TE>
<TE>   The reconfigured Santa Monica Boulevard will include exclusive bus
lanes for a short stretch and a bicycle lane running most of the way.
Other planned amenities are wider sidewalks, new lighting, additional
landscaping, trees, and ramps for the handicapped at intersection
curbs. Funding comes from federal, state and local transportation
budgets.</TE>
<TE>   The project will be undertaken in phases so that most of the
boulevard will remain open during construction.</TE>
<TE>   Though nearby business and neighborhood groups say the boulevard
needs an upgrade, several representatives have expressed mixed
feelings about the project.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, we are concerned about the dust and the noise and
inconveniences," said Mormon Elder Tad Callister, whose Los Angeles
California Temple is on the boulevard. "But, truthfully, this will be
a wonderful project to beautify Santa Monica Boulevard."</TE>
<TE>   Callister said the city has promised a traffic light at Manning
Avenue to improve access to the 13-acre Mormon temple site.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Lynch, president of the Century City Chamber of Commerce, said
some small-business owners along the boulevard worry that on-street
parking will be temporarily eliminated and that access could be
blocked during construction, driving away customers.</TE>
<TE>   "These things are not very easy," Lynch said. "There will be some
discomfort for a while."</TE>
<TE>   City Councilman Jack Weiss, who represents the West Los Angeles
area, called the project "extraordinary" but said he sympathizes with
worried business owners and residents. "We have to make sure that we
have substantial mitigation, not only for the businesses, but for the
residents," he said.</TE>
<TE>   One key component of the project--the removal of a dozen
billboards--is still in dispute. A billboard company that has rented
the right-of-way space on a monthly basis recently demanded $15.6
million in compensation from the city for removing the signs. The
city has rejected that request.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiations are continuing, but Weiss said he doesn't expect the
billboard dispute to delay the project.</TE>

<HD>Hollywood Bowl Gets Court OK to Replace Sound Shell</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BOEHM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Hollywood Bowl can tear down its 73-year-old orchestra shell and
build a new one to improve concert sound, the state Court of Appeal
ruled Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The three-judge panel denied the appeal of preservationists who
contended that the bowl's trademark white shell is a historically
essential part of its design.</LD>
<LD>   The preservationists argued that Los Angeles County and the Bowl's
main tenant, the Los Angeles Philharmonic Assn., should find a way to
renovate the shell.</LD>
<TE>   "We think this is the end of the line, and the project will go
forward," said James Arnone, the Philharmonic's attorney.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute began two years ago after the county Board of
Supervisors approved plans for a new shell, citing the old shell's
deterioration, small size and poor acoustics, which don't allow
orchestra members to hear one another as they play.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Nudelman, a leader of Hollywood Heritage, and another
preservationist group, Friends of the Santa Monica Parks and
Seashore, sued to stop the plan.</TE>
<TE>   But a Los Angeles Superior Court judge ruled in April 2001 that
the project could go forward.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the appeal, which also raised procedural issues.</TE>
<TE>   Those included arguments that people who wanted to object to the
shell's replacement were not given enough notice, and that legal
descriptions of the plan were misleading.</TE>
<TE>   The appellate court disagreed, ruling that procedural requirements
had been fulfilled.</TE>
<TE>   Nudelman vowed Wednesday to fight on with a further appeal to the
state Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a dangerous set of precedents this would set. We [would]
have to fight this fight as other historic buildings get threatened.
The door has just been left open for the bulldozers."</TE>
<TE>   Arnone said he is confident that the issue is settled.</TE>
<TE>   With the Board of Supervisors, a trial judge, and now the
unanimous appellate panel finding in favor of the shell's
replacement, Arnone said he doubts the Supreme Court will review the
case.</TE>

<LD>Police set up a temporary center for emergency calls Wednesday after
electrical problems caused the city's 911 system to fail for seven
hours, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   For much of the day, 911 calls to Pomona were routed to a dispatch
center at the Chino Police Department. The California Highway Patrol
still took cellular calls.</LD>
<LD>   The system was down from 10:10 a.m. to about 5 p.m. "We deployed
various units to survey and patrol areas for injuries, fire
accidents, to gather intelligence," said county fire spokesman Roland
Sprewell.</LD>

<HD>Canyon People Fight On to Protect Their Quiet Land</HD>
<DH>Development: In latest skirmish, residents dig in against
plans to put some 5,000 homes in their area. One proposal would add
12 estates in Silverado.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Holtz Ranch sits off one of Orange County's last meandering
country roads, a collection of weathered, century-old buildings and
rusting farm equipment decaying serenely on fallow fields.</LD>
<LD>   For decades, developers hungry to subdivide those fields have been
pushed out again and again by a few hundred residents who live in the
nearby Santa Ana Mountains.</LD>
<LD>   They are known as "the canyon people." And in Orange County, where
development has long been king, they are the proverbial peasants who
can rise up and revolt like no one else.</LD>
<TE>   "The people out there are crazy--they're the type who will chain
themselves to bulldozers," said Craig Atkins of O'Donnell Atkins,
California's largest land broker.</TE>
<TE>   Residents of narrow Silverado, Modjeska and Trabuco canyons, like
other fiercely protective residents of threatened rural areas across
California, don't wield pitchforks; they simply wear down or try to
outfox would-be builders.</TE>
<TE>   Those who attend development meetings in these communities lacing
the edges of Cleveland National Forest can include pet geese,
wandering dogs, heavily bearded or ponytailed men and their
well-heeled neighbors, many of whom are darkly suspicious of
outsiders.</TE>
<TE>   The Irvine Co., the county's largest landowner, will try to woo
canyon residents at a community meeting tonight, in a bid to build
2,500 homes along scenic Santiago Canyon Road and Irvine Lake.</TE>
<TE>   It won't be easy.</TE>
<TE>   Developers have fought costly, often fruitless battles in the
rough-and-tumble mountainous eastern edge of Orange County for
decades. A surging real estate market and a dearth of undeveloped
land elsewhere now has them lining up to try their luck again.</TE>
<TE>   About 5,000 new homes, a gas station and strip mall, and an
enlarged jail facility have all been proposed in the sparsely settled
canyon areas. Local activists admit that this time around, some
projects could move forward. But not without a fight.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, scores of canyon folk, some armed with farm animals,
sharply questioned plans for a dozen multimillion-dollar estates
proposed on 69 of Holtz Ranch's 320 acres in Silverado Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   A few months ago, Trabuco Canyon residents outfitted a model
airplane with a camera and took aerial photos of a county contractor
illegally grading to expand a juvenile detention center.</TE>
<TE>   Atkins said such opposition can reduce property values and drive
up development costs. But if a developer or builder does win needed
approvals, values skyrocket, he said, because there is little risk
that other development will crowd in.</TE>
<TE>   Similar pockets of opposition to development exist in rural
communities throughout California, land-use experts say. From the El
Dorado farming area between San Francisco and Lake Tahoe to parts of
the Santa Monica Mountains northwest of Los Angeles, longtime
residents and recreational users have fought for years to stave off
any change.</TE>
<TE>   "They consider these places sacred ground," Atkins said. "They've
lived there for 35 years, or they've taken their bikes or their dogs
out there since they were children. They think it's their land.... Of
course, it's not."</TE>
<TE>   Atkins' firm approached more than 100 potential buyers of the old
Holtz Ranch turkey farm before it was bought in 1999 by a subsidiary
of Marnell Correo Associates, a Las Vegas casino builder, for $5
million--half the price that a national home builder almost paid a
year earlier before running into a buzz saw of local opposition. By
proposing just 12 homes on lots of four to seven acres, Marnell is
betting it could hit the jackpot.</TE>
<TE>   They will be huge--proposed design rules call for mandatory house
sizes of 4,000 to 10,000 square feet. Lawns must be planted within a
year, and inexpensive construction materials such as aluminum
siding--not uncommon on existing canyon homes--will be banned.</TE>
<TE>   Three years after buying the ranch, with costs rising, Marnell
bosses are learning how big a gamble it is to try to build. A
community meeting last week was packed with residents, including a
smattering of well-heeled professionals among the rugged
individualists asking pointed questions of the company's
representatives.</TE>
<TE>   "I brought my little friend here with me tonight because I want to
know if this property is going to remain zoned agricultural," said
Lora Meadows, 43, hoisting a large honking goose named Huey. "These
hoity-toity people you plan on moving here ... need to understand
that the animals were here first.... What are they going to do when
the mountain lion that regularly wanders across that land eats their
kitty?"</TE>
<TE>   "All you're doing is putting a rich person's ghetto out in the
middle of an economically diverse community," said Silverado Canyon
resident Lou Tornatzsky, 62.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives for the developer tried to soothe feathers, noting
they were requesting a fraction of the legally allowed number of
homes on the property.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant project manager Rick Fitch of Hunsaker &amp; Associates has
never seen such extensive questioning of a small project.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been at meetings for 800 new homes in Irvine, and three
people showed up," Fitch said. "But this isn't Irvine."</TE>
<TE>   He said he thought the county planning staff had demanded numerous
redesigns and costly environmental studies on the Holtz Ranch project
because of the county's run-ins in nearby Trabuco Canyon. On Friday,
a state judge threw out the county probation department's plans for
expanding the juvenile center after reviewing the model plane photos.</TE>
<TE>   Such creativity is a hallmark of canyon resistance, some said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think people who come up here underestimate the intelligence of
the community," said Lucille Cruz, 47, librarian of the one-room
Silverado Canyon public library for a quarter-century. "It's been a
long-held belief that there are a bunch of hillbillies up here,
backwoods people.... But you know, it's a group of fighters, very
knowledgeable people."</TE>
<TE>   Marnell's Web site indicates the hope to complete the Silverado
Canyon project in 2004 at a cost of $14 million.</TE>
<TE>   Meddick, a longtime opponent of canyon development, conceded that
the scaled-back project stands a chance of winning approvals. But
she's not giving up. "They will make all the traditional mistakes,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Sherry Meddick, 49, said the 5,000 new homes proposed in various
projects would destroy the canyon way of life with air pollution,
night glare, increased traffic and other urban woes.</TE>
<TE>   The Irvine Co. already has approvals for 1,700 homes along
Santiago Canyon Road, in addition to the 2,500 more being proposed
between Silverado Canyon and Irvine Lake.</TE>

<TE>   The strategy is similar to that used for the Irvine Co.'s Shady
Canyon project in Irvine. There, 30,000-square-foot home lots are
selling for $3 million and more.</TE>
<TE>   Some neighbors say such manicured estates aren't appropriate in
the rustic canyons.</TE>
<TE>   "Show me how many of us have 4,000-square-foot houses with huge
lawns up here," said activist Sherry Meddick, 49, who has lived in
Silverado Canyon for years.</TE>
<TE>   Three years after buying the ranch, with costs rising, Marnell
bosses are learning how big a gamble it is to try to build. A
community meeting last week was packed with residents, including a
smattering of well-heeled professionals among the rugged

<TE>   "All you're doing is putting a rich person's ghetto out in the

resident Lou Tornatzsky, 62.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives for the developer tried to soothe feathers, noting
they were requesting a fraction of the legally allowed number of
homes on the property.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if the project would be gated, consultant Carol Hoffman of
Government Solutions said that was being debated. When she said rules
would be set by a homeowners association, Tornatzsky grumbled,
"Homeowners association! God. That's it, I've had enough," and
stomped out.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant project manager Rick Fitch of Hunsaker &amp; Associates has
never seen such extensive questioning of a small project.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been at meetings for 800 new homes in Irvine, and three
people showed up," Fitch said. "But this isn't Irvine."</TE>

<TE>   Meddick, a longtime opponent of canyon development, conceded that
the scaled-back project stands a chance of winning approvals. But
she's not giving up. "They will make all the traditional mistakes,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   It's no idle boast. Meddick and other activists have stalled the
contentious Saddleback Meadows project at the southern end of the
canyons for nearly 30 years through legal challenges. The county
Planning Commission might vote Wednesday on that project. It would
then go to the Board of Supervisors for a final vote this fall.</TE>
<TE>   "The communities here are real protective," she said. Residents
"chose to live in areas defrocked of street lights, of grass lawns,
tract homes--and conventional thinking."</TE>
<TE>   Sherry Meddick, 49, said the 5,000 new homes proposed in various
projects would destroy the canyon way of life with air pollution,
night glare, increased traffic and other urban woes.</TE>
<TE>   The Irvine Co. already has approvals for 1,700 homes along
Santiago Canyon Road, in addition to the 2,500 more being proposed
between Silverado Canyon and Irvine Lake.In Modjeska Canyon,
residents at a public meeting this summer denounced the company's
plans as "greedy" and a "sin." Several promised a fight.</TE>
<TE>   South of Modjeska Canyon, a second developer in as many years
wants to build 187 homes in the Saddlecrest and Saddlecreek projects.
And 250 homes are envisioned at Saddleback Meadows. A gas station and
strip mall proposal opposite Cook's Corner motorcycle bar also is
moving ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Some think canyon-area projects stand a better chance than ever.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a great deal of admiration for the people out there ...
and yet that's where the development has to flow, because that's
where the land is," said Brian Murphy, spokesman for the county
planning and development services department. "Property rights are
property rights, and if they can do it according to law, then they
can do it." Not without a battle, canyon folk say.</TE>
<TE>   "Those projects will be fought down to the last bulldozer,"
Tornatzsky vowed in the parking lot outside the Holtz Ranch session.</TE>

<HD>Simon May Be Making History, but for All the Wrong Reasons</HD>

<LD>SACRAMENTO</LD>
<LD>   The question political junkies are asking is: Has there ever been
a worse campaign for governor of California than Bill Simon's?</LD>
<LD>   Has there ever been a worse candidate?</LD>
<TE>   That is, a sorrier gubernatorial nominee of either the Republican
or Democratic party?</TE>
<TE>   Can't think of any, is the consensus of political pros I've talked
to in both parties. Not at this point anyway--this close to Labor
Day, the traditional kickoff of the November race.</TE>
<TE>   Election day is still more than 10 weeks off and nobody's yet
declaring Gov. Gray Davis the winner. His unpopularity assures Simon
a shot.</TE>
<TE>   The GOP candidate will pick up $3 million and, presumably, some
rare favorable publicity Friday and Saturday when President Bush
raises money for him in Stockton, Los Angeles and Dana Point.</TE>
<TE>   Anything's possible, the pols profess. But ....</TE>
<TE>   "It seems to me," says independent pollster Mervin Field, "that
the degree of antipathy held by voters toward Gray Davis is matched
by the voter preference he enjoys over Bill Simon."</TE>
<TE>   That's a pollster's cautious way of saying: Can you believe it?
How poorly this guy is running against a governor who's so
vulnerable?</TE>
<TE>   Private polls show Davis leading by from eight to 18 points.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' own tracking poll shows him ahead by 16. Toss in the Green
candidate, and the Democratic governor still leads by 13.</TE>
<TE>   Myself, I've covered 10 gubernatorial races and never seen a
campaign this dismal just before Labor Day.</TE>
<TE>   Let's quickly review some past losers:</TE>
<TE>   * Republican Dan Lungren in 1998 could be bellicose, but--</TE>
<TE>   unlike Simon--he was never boring. Never bland. He was too
right-wing, but voters got the sense Lungren was speaking from
heartfelt conviction. Simon hasn't conveyed a sense of conviction or
passion about anything.</TE>
<TE>   * Democrat Kathleen Brown in 1994 seemed unsure of herself and was
easily pushed around by another unpopular governor, Pete Wilson. But,
like Lungren, she had been elected statewide and locally before
running for governor. She'd proved herself to be a capable public
servant. Simon has never run for any office and, in fact, only
sporadically voted.</TE>
<TE>   * You can go back a half century--Republicans Evelle Younger and
Houston Flournoy, Democrats Richard Graves and James Roosevelt. All
these losers offered more than Simon. And they were up against
popular opponents.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what this guy [Simon] was thinking," says Democratic
consultant Darry Sragow. "He must have clicked his heels twice,
closed his eyes and wished he'd get to Oz."</TE>
<TE>   Simon won the primary largely because Davis pumped $9 million into
TV ads attacking Republican moderate Richard Riordan. Davis thus
assured himself the weakest opponent in November.</TE>
<TE>   Simon ran as a "proud conservative" who's "pro-life."</TE>
<TE>   "If you come out of the primary in California as the right-wing
candidate, you're dead," observes Tony Quinn, a Republican who
co-edits the nonpartisan Target Book, which charts political races.
"The Republican Party can no more run 'anti-choice' right-</TE>
<TE>   wingers than the Democratic Party can run anti-death penalty
left-wingers."</TE>
<TE>   Nearly six months after the primary, voters still know little
about Simon--except maybe that he's very conservative and has had
some legal troubles.</TE>
<TE>   Simon hasn't just been adrift, he has been smashing up against the
rocks.</TE>
<TE>   What else do you call it when a businessman-candidate's family
investment firm is ordered by a jury of 12 registered voters to pay a
convicted drug trafficker $78 million in fraud damages? They'd teamed
up in the pay-phone business while people were buying cell phones.</TE>
<TE>   Asks a Davis TV ad: "If we can't trust [Simon] in business, how
can we trust him in the governor's office?"</TE>
<TE>   "The White House was plenty upset about the fact that a jury case
was hidden [from presidential aides]," says a Bush insider.</TE>
<TE>   Hardly anyone outside the Simon family knew the trial was
proceeding except campaign strategist Sal Russo, who didn't share the
info--or even prepare a political strategy. "We were advised by
Simon's attorneys the family likely would prevail," Russo explains.</TE>
<TE>   Simon also has other big problems, including an IRS investigation
of an offshore tax shelter, and the fact he's trailing Davis in
fund-raising by 6 to 1.</TE>
<TE>   It's that Davis money-</TE>
<TE>   grubbing--the alleged policy peddling for political donations--</TE>
<TE>   plus his record on energy and spending that Russo believes will
propel Simon into the governor's office.</TE>
<TE>   But he can't just rely on Davis to lose. Simon needs to show
voters he is an acceptable alternative. Or he' s likely only to win
the title All-Time Worst.</TE>

<HD>Defense in Simi Beating Case Says Women Were Framed</HD>
<DH>Court: Attorneys for mother and daughter charged with
attempted murder accuse the alleged victim. Jurors begin
negotiations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Defense attorneys for a Simi Valley mother and daughter on trial on
suspicion of attempted murder and arson argued in court Wednesday
that the alleged victim attempted to frame them by setting fire to
his own bed.</LD>
<LD>   With the case going to jurors Wednesday, Eileen Childs, 37, and
her daughter, Jennifer Childs, 19, face charges of trying to kill
Larry Childs, Eileen's husband and Jennifer's stepfather, by setting
his bed ablaze and then beating him with a baseball bat.</LD>
<LD>   "This was a frame-up, beyond a shadow of a doubt," said Jean
Farley, attorney for Jennifer Childs, an aspiring pop singer.</LD>
<TE>   Larry Childs was stressed out from work, frustrated with his
failing marriage, and wanted some way out, said Jenny Scovis,
attorney for Eileen Childs.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys previously said they believed the fire had been
sparked accidentally by a candle in the bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   "That fire was not accidental. I believe Larry Childs started that
fire," Scovis told jurors. "Although I have no idea how he had
intended for things to play out."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors countered by saying there would be no reasonable way
for such a plan to work, and urged jurors to reject the theory.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm pretty stressed out right now, but I'm not going to go set a
fire and try to kill somebody," Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Lisa Lee
said. "It's ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   Jurors began their deliberations Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Both the mother and daughter are charged with arson and attempted
murder stemming from their early morning altercation with Larry
Childs on March 25.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say the women conspired to kill Childs by setting fire
to his bed while he slept. When that didn't work, prosecutors said,
the defendants tried to finish the job by beating Childs with a
baseball bat and glass mug.</TE>
<TE>   Their motive was a $1.4-million life insurance policy, say
prosecutors, contending the women wanted to use the money to further
Jennifer Childs' career as a singer and possibly open a Jiffy Lube
franchise.</TE>
<TE>   Eileen and Jennifer Childs, however, testified they did not start
the fire and had hit Larry Childs in self-defense after they said he
dragged them down a hallway by their hair and tried to hurt them.</TE>
<TE>   The six-week case culminated Wednesday with closing arguments,
which Judge Herbert Curtis III limited to two hours for each of the
three attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   Lee summed up her case by urging jurors to ask themselves which
version of the incident made the most sense.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Childs testified he awoke to find his bed in flames, and
when he went to find his family was ambushed by his wife and
step-daughter swinging baseball bats.</TE>
<TE>   With his head bleeding profusely, he grabbed two drinking glasses
and rushed back to the mattress to douse the flames, he testified.
The story is consistent with blood evidence found at the scene, Lee
argued.</TE>
<TE>   If Eileen and Jennifer Childs were the victims of a rage-filled
attack by Larry Childs, Lee asked, then why were they not injured?</TE>
<TE>   Lee also asked why no one heard the women screaming for help, and
asked why both women reentered the house after they had escaped to
safety?</TE>
<TE>   "He was saying, 'Oh, my God,' 'Help me,' and 'I'm on fire,' " Lee
said. "These are words of somebody being the victim of an attack. He
was the only one screaming."</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys attempted a common-sense argument to urge jurors
to reject the prosecution's theory.</TE>
<TE>   These are smart women, said Farley, adding that if they wanted to
kill Larry Childs why would they choose to do so using a mattress
fire, a bat and mug? Scovis said the bottom line is that prosecutors
have not proved their case. "Where is the proof that these women did
anything at all?" she asked.</TE>
<TE>   "The evidence was torqued like a pretzel to fit the prosecution's
case. I hope we don't convict people in this country with such a lack
of evidence."</TE>

<HD>Chromium 6 Removal May Cost $315 Million</HD>
<DH>Health: Supervisors asked for estimates on cleaning up
wells in northern L.A. County after high levels of pollutants were
detected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW BLANKSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Removal of chromium 6, arsenic and other pollutants from county-owned
drinking-water wells in northern Los Angeles County would cost $315
million if aggressively implemented, according to a report released
Wednesday by the county Department of Public Works.</LD>
<LD>   The review was ordered by county supervisors at the request of
Supervisor Mike Antonovich after more than two dozen wells in the
Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys tested positive for
higher-than-normal concentrations of chromium 6.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to the capital costs of developing new storage
capacity, expanding distribution, and implementing new technology and
water treatment systems, the report by McGuire Environmental
Consultants Inc. estimates that the annual cost of maintaining the
infrastructure could reach $28.6 million.</LD>
<TE>   The cost of a less aggressive approach to removing chemical
pollutants would range from $27 million to $63.2 million, the report
said.</TE>
<TE>   Maintaining the system under the more modest plan would cost
$360,000 to $1.2 million annually.</TE>
<TE>   Chromium 6, used in paint, chrome plating and other manufacturing
processes, has been detected in water systems throughout the state,
including industrial areas of Los Angeles. The chemical is considered
carcinogenic when inhaled, but its danger to people when ingested is
unclear.</TE>
<TE>   If approved, the water treatment plans would affect wells operated
by the Public Works Department, which supplies drinking water to
Palmdale, Lancaster, Littlerock and other nearby communities,
spokesman Ken Pellman said.</TE>
<TE>   State and federal governments limit chromium in water as a means
of regulating chromium 6.</TE>
<TE>   Federal guidelines hold total chromium to 100 parts per billion,
while the state limit is 50 parts per billion.</TE>
<TE>   The state Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment
recommended in 1999 that the amount of chromium allowed in drinking
water be lowered to 2.5 parts per billion. The same agency later
withdrew that recommendation, acknowledging that its initial risk
assessment was flawed.</TE>
<TE>   The current state standard for arsenic in drinking water is 50
parts per billion. Arsenic can cause cancer.</TE>

<LD>An East Los Angeles sheriff's deputy was arrested Wednesday on
suspicion of possessing assault weapons and child pornography.</LD>
<LD>   Richard Dario Comoe, 44, of Canyon Country is being held in lieu
of $1-million bail pending arraignment today in Los Angeles Superior
Court.</LD>
<LD>   Comoe faces five felony counts of possessing illegal weapons,
among them a machine gun, assault weapons and a short-barreled
shotgun. He also is charged with misdemeanor counts of child annoying
and possession of child pornography.</LD>
<TE>   District attorney's spokeswoman Jane Robison said an investigation
of Comoe was opened after he allegedly sent sexually suggestive
e-mail to a 15-year-old female member of the Sheriff's Department
Explorers post. The girl confided to another Explorer that she was
disturbed by the e-mail and authorities were notified.</TE>
<TE>   Deputies serving a search warrant at Comoe's home this month found
a safe containing the weapons and a computer disk containing child
pornography, Robison said.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's officials declined to comment on Comoe's arrest. They
said the 21-year department veteran is on administrative leave, but
did not say if he is being paid.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted, Comoe could be sentenced to five years and eight
months in prison, officials said.</TE>

<HD>Faith Kept Stranded Man Alive</HD>
<DH>Rescue: Luis Cruz survived 12 days in an L.A. County forest
and says he never doubted that he would live.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEORGE RAMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He ate dry leaves and grass, drank his own urine and was confronted
by a bear.</LD>
<LD>   But Luis Cruz, the 26-year-old who was stranded for 12 days with a
fractured back in the Angeles National Forest, said Wednesday that he
never lost his faith that he would survive the ordeal.</LD>
<LD>   "I was never afraid to die," the born-again Christian said from
his hospital bed in Pasadena. "I was in real pain, real tired ... but
God never left my side. I was never alone."</LD>
<TE>   He wore a string of rosary beads around his neck, reciting
"prayers whenever it was necessary," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Cruz, a native of El Salvador who lives in the San Fernando Valley
community of Arleta, said he was comforted by his father's
words--that perseverance in difficult times turns boys into men.</TE>
<TE>   Unable to walk, he had crawled for miles during his harrowing
adventure, but could joke Wednesday about coming face-to-face with an
unexpected companion only 15 feet away.</TE>
<TE>   "I suddenly woke up and there was a bear," Cruz said with a
chuckle. "He was scared and I was scared. He ran away, but I
couldn't...."</TE>
<TE>   Cruz was rescued Tuesday afternoon after he was discovered by a
hiker, about seven miles from the campground where he had abandoned
his disabled truck Aug. 9. He had intended to walk home.</TE>
<TE>   He was flown to Huntington Hospital in Pasadena, where he was
reported in "fair to good" condition late Wednesday. Doctors said
Cruz suffered a fractured vertebra, a dislocated left shoulder and
numerous cuts and bruises. Andrea Stradling, a hospital spokeswoman,
could not say how long Cruz would remain at Huntington.</TE>
<TE>   The Valley College student, who is studying biology, was well
enough to talk about the ordeal for a half hour with a small group of
reporters in his fourth-floor hospital room. He offered no
explanation for his decision to walk home after his sports utility
vehicle was disabled.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Cruz talked about how he survived in the woods. Angeles
National Forest is the nation's second most heavily used federal
wilderness, with 32 million visitors annually, but for Cruz it was as
remote as a place could be.</TE>
<TE>   Equipped with a backpack with water and books, Cruz said all was
well until he fell 15 to 20 feet off a cliff into a wooded canyon
that contained a small stream.</TE>
<TE>   "I landed on my feet," he said, explaining that's how he broke his
back in the fall. He also dislocated his left shoulder, but that
didn't seem to deter him. "I popped it back into place," he said
nonchalantly.</TE>
<TE>   Unable to walk, he said he ate grass, dry leaves and about four or
five berries that were quite tasty.</TE>
<TE>   He drank the water in the backpack, but soon drank some water from
the stream and soiled water from the ground.</TE>
<TE>   "God was looking out for me when I fell," Cruz said, adding that
the presence of water was the Lord's work.</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally, he cried out for help.</TE>
<TE>   "I screamed 'help' and 'ayuda,' " the bilingual Cruz said, "but no
one heard me. I knew my family was looking for me. I knew I wasn't
alone."</TE>
<TE>   As the ordeal stretched into a second week, Cruz said his greatest
fear was the nighttime temperatures, which authorities said reached
estimated lows of 45 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   "My back hurt bad and I couldn't move," he said. "I got a little
bit of heat [but not enough]."</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, when there was no more water, Cruz said he drank his
own urine.</TE>
<TE>   "I splashed it on my face," he said, explaining he hoped it would
keep him warm.</TE>
<TE>   Hospital officials could not estimate how much weight Cruz had
lost in the forest, but he told rescuers he couldn't eat solid food.
"Mark [the hiker who found him] gave me water and a sandwich, but I
couldn't eat it. My stomach shrunk too much," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Cruz had tried to keep track of time and was sure he had been
stranded 11 days. "But the rescuers told me it was 12," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Family members said Cruz liked to go to the national forest for
some solitude.</TE>
<TE>   When asked if he would visit Angeles again, he was vague about it,

<HD>Martin Deutsch, 85; Influential Physicist at MIT</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Martin Deutsch, a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology who worked on the Manhattan Project and later discovered
an elemental form of matter, has died. He was 85.</LD>
<LD>   Deutsch died Friday at his home in Cambridge, Mass. His family
said the cause of death has not been determined.</LD>
<LD>   "There was nothing in life that he didn't want to understand. That
was the hallmark of his life," said Suzanne Z. Deutsch, his wife of
63 years.</LD>
<TE>   Perhaps the leading scientific achievement in Deutsch's career
came in 1951 when he was 34. Deutsch confirmed the existence of
positronium, a hydrogen-like atom without a nucleus that exists for
as little as 1/10 of a billionth of a second. The discovery
corroborated the quantum theory of electrodynamics for a two-particle
system.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a spectacular production on Martin's part," said Francis
Low, MIT physics professor emeritus, who worked with Deutsch on
positronium experiments in the school's Laboratory for Nuclear
Science.</TE>
<TE>   Deutsch headed the laboratory from 1973 to 1979 and was succeeded
by Low, who described Deutsch as "a remarkably knowledgeable man, a
fire hose of information."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Vienna, Deutsch was the child of doctors. His mother, a
psychiatry professor at the University of Vienna, became Sigmund
Freud's last pupil, and Freud appointed her director of his Training
Institute of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society in 1923.</TE>
<TE>   A fervent anti-fascist, Deutsch said in a 1998 interview with the
Boston Globe that he was "a product of my culture, which is the
culture of Vienna Jews."</TE>
<TE>   At age 17, he moved to Zurich, Switzerland, after participating in
the Austrian resistance to the fascists.</TE>
<TE>   In 1935, he came to the United States with his mother. Though they
intended to return to Europe within weeks, they stayed and settled in
Cambridge.</TE>
<TE>   Deutsch enrolled at MIT and earned a bachelor's degree in 1937,
then a PhD in 1941, completing in six years a course of study that
typically takes 11.</TE>
<TE>   He worked on the atomic bomb, concentrating on problems of fission
as part of the Manhattan Project in Los Alamos, N.M.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, Deutsch returned to MIT. "The next five or six
years were harvest years for me. Ideas that had germinated during the
war years led to others, and somehow, it seems everything I touched
turned to gold," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Deutsch was a teacher and mentor of Henry Kendall, another MIT
professor who won the Nobel Prize in 1990 for his co-discovery of the
quark.</TE>
<TE>   Deutsch retired from MIT in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his wife, Deutsch is survived by two sons, L. Peter
Deutsch of Menlo Park, Calif., and Nicholas Deutsch of New York City.</TE>

<HD>Feinstein Again Asks About El Toro Cleanup</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If the Navy was trying to send a hint to Sen. Dianne Feinstein
(D-Calif.) by not answering a letter she sent four months ago citing
her concerns about the El Toro Marine base cleanup plan, Feinstein
isn't taking it.</LD>
<LD>   After waiting in vain for a response, she again wrote this week to
Secretary of the Navy Gordon R. England--reminding him that she still
sees serious shortcomings in the Navy's cleanup plan, and that
England has yet to explain why the Navy is not more aggressive about
removing toxins.</LD>
<LD>   Feinstein's letter follows a recent unanimous Orange County Board
of Supervisors decision to put the El Toro cleanup issue before
voters in November. That ballot measure will demand that the Navy
reconcile its plan for the 4,700-acre base with environmental studies
by Irvine and the county suggesting that the Navy's plan is
inadequate.</LD>
<TE>   Public attention has shifted to the toxins under the base since
voters in March rejected a plan for a commercial airport at the
closed military base after a decade-long debate and opted for an
urban park instead.</TE>
<TE>   "I share the concerns raised by the Board of Supervisors over
contamination at ... El Toro," Feinstein wrote, pointing out specific
locations where the Navy has conducted "limited or no testing."</TE>
<TE>   Those areas include under the runways where jet fuel may have
seeped; two landfills that are full of oil, paint residue, hydraulic
fluid and industrial solvents; and the base sewer system, where one
study suggests 700,000 pounds of toxic solvents may have leaked.</TE>
<TE>   Navy officials declined to answer Feinstein's letter directly, but
defended their cleanup actions, assuring that the Navy is taking
responsibility for removing all hazardous waste--even if it is
discovered after the property is transferred to public or private
hands.</TE>

<HD>Tensions Ease in Anaheim With Gigante Ruling</HD>
<DH>Development: The City Council's approval of the Mexican
supermarket chain's liquor license helps overcome allegations of bias
and a potential trade dispute.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO and JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A day after accusing Anaheim of snubbing its substantial Latino
population, community leaders commended the City Council on Wednesday
for defusing ethnic tensions by approving a permit for a Mexican
grocery store chain.</LD>
<LD>   The liquor license granted Tuesday by council members will allow
Gigante, a billion-dollar company with 270 stores in Mexico, to open
its first Orange County supermarket--but many of Gigante's supporters
said the another issue was far more important.</LD>
<LD>   At stake, Gigante attorney Richard Denhalter said Wednesday, were
U.S.-Mexico business relations. Before the meeting, Gigante officials
alleged that a license denial would violate the North American Free
Trade Agreement.</LD>
<TE>   "It was high time," Amin David, president of Los Amigos of Orange
County, said Wednesday, adding that city officials shouldn't have
taken so long to reach the decision.</TE>
<TE>   After three hours of contentious debate and public testimony,
council members agreed that Gigante's appeal to Latino customers, and
the company's strong Mexican roots, should not be a factor when
considering its liquor license application.</TE>
<TE>   The council voted 3 to 1 in favor of Gigante.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Tom Tait said he was disturbed when he discovered no
other supermarket in Anaheim has been denied a liquor license. "Race
or ethnicity should obviously not play any part in governmental
decisions for land use," Tait said Wednesday. "I think the right
thing happened. It just took a little while longer than it should
have."</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Lucille Kring agreed, saying she feared voting
against Gigante could set a dangerous precedent--particularly if a
store such as Pavilions or Trader Joe's sought a similar license.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Frank Feldhaus cast the only dissenting vote, saying
the city already has too many stores selling alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   Gigante USA has three stores in Southern California. But in its
attempts to expand into Orange County, the business met resistance
from Anaheim's Redevelopment Agency, which found Gigante to be too
Latino for Anaheim Plaza, an outdoor mall north of Disneyland. The
chain had also been waved away from another location by Mayor Tom
Daly, who wanted a store with a greater tax base.</TE>
<TE>   Another stumbling block came in June when the Planning Commission
unanimously rejected a liquor license application.</TE>
<TE>   Gigante filed an appeal and mounted a public relations campaign
that attracted national media attention. Activists considered the
city's actions "market racial profiling" and a throwback to days when
landlords turned down tenants based on ethnicity.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't take much to fan the racial flames in Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, Latino and anti-immigration activists have both
rallied in front of City Hall over a policy that allows Immigration
and Naturalization Service agents to be stationed at the jail.</TE>
<TE>   And many Latino leaders complained to the City Council last year
after discovering that the Anaheim police chief had compiled a
36-page report documenting activities of community members, and
creating a "family tree" that detailed interconnected relationships
among the activists.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim's Latino population has grown dramatically. The city is
nearly half Latino--up about 15 percentage points from the 1990
census figures. In the census tract where Gigante will open early
next year, Latinos make up 60% of the population.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a city in transition," said Ron Stockdale, a former Anaheim
resident and the leasing agent for the vacant store Gigante plans to
occupy. "This will continue to be an opportunity for the city to
embrace the inevitable change in the ethnic balance of the
population. You can either embrace it or you can choose to oppose
it."</TE>
<TE>   To Mexican immigrants who live near Anaheim Plaza, Gigante is as
common a concept as Wal-Mart. Those who followed the controversy on
Spanish-language television said they were not surprised by the
city's opposition.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course the city didn't want it because they don't want to
admit just how many immigrants really live here," said Mariselas
Campos, 33, who lives nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Others are hoping to find jobs at Gigante, which plans to employ
150.</TE>

the company's strong Mexican roots, should not be a factor when
considering its liquor license application.</TE>
<TE>   The council voted 3 to 1 in favor of Gigante.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Tom Tait said he was disturbed when he discovered no
other supermarket in Anaheim has been denied a liquor license. "Race
or ethnicity should obviously not play any part in governmental
decisions for land use," Tait said Wednesday. "I think the right
thing happened. It just took a little while longer than it should
have."</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Lucille Kring agreed, saying she feared voting
against Gigante could set a dangerous precedent--particularly if a
store such as Pavilions or Trader Joe's sought a similar license.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Frank Feldhaus cast the only dissenting vote, saying
the city already has too many stores selling alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   Gigante USA has three stores in Southern California. But in its
attempts to expand into Orange County, the business met resistance
from Anaheim's Redevelopment Agency, which found Gigante to be too
Latino for Anaheim Plaza, an outdoor mall north of Disneyland. The
chain had also been waved away from another location by Mayor Tom
Daly, who wanted a store with a greater tax base.</TE>
<TE>   Another stumbling block came in June when the Planning Commission
unanimously rejected a liquor license application.</TE>
<TE>   Gigante filed an appeal and mounted a public relations campaign
that attracted national media attention. Community activists
considered the city's actions "market racial profiling" and a
throwback to days when landlords turned down tenants based on
ethnicity.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't take much to fan the racial flames in Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, Latino and anti-immigration activists have both
rallied in front of City Hall over a policy that allows Immigration
and Naturalization Service agents to be stationed at the jail.</TE>
<TE>   And many Latino leaders complained to the City Council last year
after discovering that the Anaheim police chief had compiled a
36-page report documenting activities of community members, and
creating a "family tree" that detailed interconnected relationships
among the activists.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim's Latino population has grown dramatically. The city is
nearly half Latino--up about 15 percentage points from the 1990
census figures. In the census tract where Gigante will open early
next year, Latinos make up 60% of the population.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a city in transition," said Ron Stockdale, a former Anaheim
resident and the leasing agent for the vacant store Gigante plans to
occupy.</TE>
<TE>   "This will continue to be an opportunity for the city to embrace
the inevitable change in the ethnic balance of the population. You
can either embrace it or you can choose to oppose it."</TE>
<TE>   To Mexican immigrants who live near Anaheim Plaza, Gigante is as
common a concept as Wal-Mart. Those who followed the controversy on
Spanish-language television said they were not surprised by the
city's opposition.</TE>
<TE>   "Gigante is a great store. We shopped there all the time in Mexico
and we can't wait to get in the doors when it opens here. Of course
the city didn't want it because they don't want to admit just how
many immigrants really live here," said Mariselas Campos, 33, a
mother of two who lives in nearby apartments.</TE>
<TE>   Others are hoping to find jobs at Gigante, which plans to invest
$5 million in the Anaheim store and employ 150.</TE>
<TE>   "In Mexico, all of my friends' mothers love Gigante. They'll spend
all day there," said Juan Garcia Alaniz, 53, a native of Monterrey,
Mexico, who was recently laid off as a store sales manager.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be a great place to work."</TE>
<TE>   But not everybody is looking forward to Gigante's arrival.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see why we have to have in our city stores that are
really not open to people like me," said Beatrice Wells, 67.</TE>
<TE>   "I really wonder if it will spoil the whole shopping area."</TE>

<HD>Signs of War on the Home Front</HD>
<DH>Military: National Guard troops prepare to ship out from
Los Alamitos on an overseas mission. Their destination is secret;
danger is likely.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>H.G. REZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Their destination is a secret. But as a company of Special Forces
troops from the California National Guard prepared Wednesday night to
leave for their overseas mission, there were telltale signs about
where they might be headed.</LD>
<LD>   Officers removed rank insignia from their camouflage fatigues,
something normally done in a combat zone or other inhospitable place.
Away from prying eyes, soldiers packed their gear at the Armed Forces
Reserve Center in Los Alamitos in a stark, gray building similar to
other spartan buildings from which U.S. soldiers have marched off to
war in the past.</LD>
<LD>   There was none of the bantering that GIs are known for, only
serious, almost mechanical movements from men who worked without
speaking.</LD>
<TE>   Then there was Master Sgt. Dan's comment as he looked at his
4-week-old daughter, Callie: "I've never been under fire before."</TE>
<TE>   Also on his mind was the safety of the rest of his A
Team--normally 12 soldiers--where he is the senior noncommissioned
officer. "I'm thinking over and over again: Have I learned everything
and trained hard enough to keep everybody safe and accomplish the
mission?" Dan said. Guard officials would allow only his first name
to be used for security reasons.</TE>
<TE>   According to Guard officials, 80 men from Alpha Company, 19th
Special Forces Group will "depart in a few days." Capt. Denise
Varner, a California National Guard spokeswoman in Sacramento, would
only say that the U.S. Army activated the men in support of Operation
Enduring Freedom, the U.S. military effort in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Two soldiers from the 19th Special Forces Group, made up of
soldiers from National Guard units across the country, were killed in
action in Afghanistan in April: Sgt. Gene Arden Vance Jr. of the West
Virginia National Guard and Sgt. First Class Daniel A. Romero of the
Colorado Guard.</TE>
<TE>   Dan's wife, Audrey, said their baby's birth a month ago has had an
unintended effect. "I'm grateful to have Callie. She represents a
part of Dan," she said. "But Dan's leaving has overshadowed
everything. I've got my baby, but my husband won't be around in a few
days."</TE>
<TE>   Dan, 38, a San Diego firefighter and paramedic, is also one of his
team's medics. Working out of a fire station in San Diego's tough
Logan Heights community, he has seen his share of gunshot and
stabbing victims.</TE>
<TE>   "I have absolute confidence in my medical skills. Working as a
paramedic has prepared me for whatever comes along," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Audrey said Dan "pretty much dropped this on me a few
days ago," the couple said they had known since the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks that he would probably be activated for what the
military calls a real-world mission.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, they prepared to spend possibly their last night
together before Dan deploys. Audrey, 33, a banker on maternity leave,
drove up from San Diego and is returning home today.</TE>
<TE>   While her husband is away, she will depend on a family support
network from the California Guard for backup, emotional and
financial, if needed. The couple has been married for 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   When Guard soldiers go on active duty, almost all of them take
huge pay cuts from their civilian jobs. Dan is no exception, but he
is luckier than most: The San Diego Fire Department has agreed to
make up the difference between his Army pay and his base salary. But
he will still take a financial hit, because the department will not
cover the overtime he would normally work.</TE>
<TE>   Guard officials say soldiers on active duty see their families'
household income cut by as much as 65%. It's a fact that causes many
officials to worry whether a soldier can accomplish his mission
overseas if he's concerned about his wife being able to make the
mortgage payment.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going back to work when Dan leaves," Audrey said, citing the
reduction in their income. "I don't have much choice."</TE>
<TE>   In an ironic twist, Dan, a 21-year veteran, received notification
less than two weeks ago advising him that he was eligible for
retirement. The letter arrived after his company had been activated.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't retire as long as I've got orders [for overseas]," he
said. "Besides, this is what I've trained for for 20 years. I'm
finally getting a chance to do the job.</TE>
<TE>   "The Special Forces motto is de oppresso liber, free the
oppressed. When I get over there I will do my best to help those
folks understand what freedom means."</TE>
<TE>   Guard officials refused to say how long the soldiers will be
overseas, but their time on active duty could run as long as two
years. But the troopers know the date when they can expect to return
home.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be back soon. I hope [the Army] will honor their promise to
bring us back by a certain date," Dan said. "But I guess that also
depends on what happens while we're over there."</TE>

<HD>Health Cutbacks to Curtail Immunizations for Children</HD>
<DH>Services: County plan also trims screenings for disease.
Critics say the reductions are unsafe.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN and DAREN BRISCOE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As part of its recently approved plan to cut health-care costs, Los
Angeles County will significantly reduce immunizations for children,
screenings for sexually transmitted diseases and treatment for
communicable diseases.</LD>
<LD>   The reductions in public health services have received little of
the attention or opposition sparked by proposals to close clinics and
hospitals. But some health-care advocates worry that the effects
could be damaging and far-reaching.</LD>
<LD>   The Board of Supervisors on Tuesday approved a health-care plan
that cuts up to 84,000 of 97,000 annual childhood immunization
visits, along with up to 38,000 of 88,000 visits for treatment of
communicable diseases.</LD>
<TE>   Service reductions were also approved for patients with
tuberculosis and sexually transmitted diseases.</TE>
<TE>   These and other cuts to disease control efforts total $8.9
million, about 10% of the county's spending on public health
(excluding funding from state and federal governments). They come on
top of the board's decision Tuesday to close 11 primary-care centers
and four school-based health centers by Oct. 1.</TE>
<TE>   The county is making the cuts because the Department of Health
Services faces an $800-million deficit within three years.</TE>
<TE>   The immunization clinic at Curtis Tucker Health Center in
Inglewood saw 265 patients in the first two days of this week, and
the clinic was flooded with patients again Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "School's starting," said nurse manager Elvie Tuttle as she
scanned the full waiting room. "The idea that they're going to cut
these services, well, I just don't know what to say."</TE>
<TE>   The public health cuts will take several weeks to phase in. The
health department will detail the cutbacks--reduced hours or fewer
available appointments at each public health clinic--next week. But
officials acknowledge that some patients may go without medical
services.</TE>
<TE>   "None of these cuts are cuts that we want to make," said Dr.
Jonathan Fielding, the county's director of public health. "They're
done because we have a fiscal obligation.... We don't want to cut any
of this."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the children who seek immunizations at public health
clinics have private medical insurance but don't want to wait for an
appointment with their physicians, Fielding said. As a result, the
county has picked up the tab.</TE>
<TE>   Others, he acknowledged, don't have insurance.</TE>
<TE>   In a cramped examination room at the Tucker Health Center, Kenrick
Haylock tried to gird his 5-year-old son, Kenrick, for a series of
five immunization shots.</TE>
<TE>   Haylock, 32, has medical coverage but said his son isn't covered.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't enroll him in school without an immunization record,"
Haylock said.</TE>
<TE>   As the nurse detailed the necessary follow-up visits, Haylock said
of the coming cuts, "I don't think they should do them. It's not just
poor and lazy people who use these services."</TE>
<TE>   Those seeking care for communicable diseases, such as sore
throats, lice or respiratory infections, will be sent to their
primary care physicians for an exam. "Instead of evaluating them,
we're going to refer them," said John Schunhoff, the county's chief
of operations for public health.</TE>
<TE>   Fielding said some of the cutbacks approved by the supervisors
look worse on paper than they actually are. For instance, the
supervisors allowed the health department to cut 20,000 of 70,000
treatment visits by people with tuberculosis.</TE>
<TE>   In reality, though, Fielding said, all TB patients will continue
to be seen. Clinics will be asked to schedule appointments closer
together and reduce idle time.</TE>
<TE>   "In some cases, [the clinics] are not seeing as many patients as
we feel is optimal," Fielding said. "This is really an issue of
efficiency."</TE>
<TE>   Among the other cuts:</TE>
<TE>   * $335,000 to help county offices and nonprofit groups design
exercise programs for work breaks.</TE>
<TE>   * $400,000 for chlamydia testing outreach.</TE>
<TE>   * $700,000 to help patients find care options.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say the cuts are dangerous, particularly those related to
immunization. They worry that the cuts will undermine the recent push
to immunize youngsters against a host of communicable diseases, such
as measles and chicken pox.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know where they think people will go," said Lynn Kersey,
executive director of Maternal and Child Health Access. "There's no
capacity."</TE>
<TE>   Sharon Swonger, a nurse who works for the Los Angeles Unified
School District, said many students have nowhere else to turn--they
don't have health insurance or a private doctor. "Children need their
immunization to get into school, so there's going to be a huge
backlog," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Fielding said many children will be able to get immunizations at
free clinics or through nonprofit groups that receive money from the
state and federal governments specifically for vaccinations. Still,
he said, the county plans to keep a close eye on immunization figures
to see if their changes roll back progress.</TE>

<HD>Trial in Taped Beating Moved Again</HD>
<DH>Venue: The latest switch comes after a Torrance judge
disqualifies himself, saying he might not be impartial. The new site
will be the Airport Courthouse.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In yet another reshuffling of the judicial cards, the trial of two
Inglewood police officers charged in the videotaped beating of
16-year-old Donovan Jackson was transferred Wednesday from Torrance
to a courthouse near Los Angeles International Airport.</LD>
<LD>   And in Auburn, Mitchell Crooks, the amateur videographer who
caught the beating on tape, agreed Wednesday to serve 325 days in
jail in an old case in Northern California's Placer County. He had
been a fugitive from a misdemeanor hit-and-run conviction until his
arrest by Los Angeles prosecutors last month.</LD>
<LD>   The trial move, which was not requested by defense attorneys or
prosecutors, was made after Francis J. Hourigan, the Torrance judge
assigned to hear the case, disqualified himself. Hourigan wrote in
court papers that he had "a substantial doubt" that he could "act
impartially in this matter."</LD>
<TE>   Court spokesman Allan Parachini said the Airport Courthouse "was
the appropriate place for this case to go." Judges may consider
geography, safety and courtroom space when placing cases, but the
primary concern is ensuring a fair trial, Parachini said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are, however, not insensitive to community concerns and
concerns about jury pool issues that are raised," he said. "But it
was not the deciding factor in this case."</TE>
<TE>   Black civil rights activists protested last week after the case
was moved from Inglewood to Torrance, which attorneys said had a
whiter, more conservative jury pool than Inglewood.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, civil rights attorney Leo Terrell said the court is
"playing a game of politics" and should have sent the case back to
Inglewood.</TE>
<TE>   The police officers were indicted by the Los Angeles County Grand
Jury last month for the July 6 incident at an Inglewood gas station.
Jeremy J. Morse, 24, is charged with assault under color of authority
and Bijan Darvish, 25, is charged with filing a false police report.
Both have pleaded not guilty and are scheduled to return Sept. 5 for
a pretrial hearing.</TE>
<TE>   The Airport Courthouse, which opened in 1999, is less than two
miles from where Jackson was slammed against a patrol car and punched
in the face. It draws from a jury pool "virtually identical" to that
of the Inglewood courthouse, Parachini said.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers said Wednesday that the transfer came as a
surprise, and that they were still considering whether to ask that
the case be moved out of the county.</TE>
<TE>   "This was an assignment that was just thrust upon us," said
Darvish's lawyer, Ronald Brower. "We have no control."</TE>
<TE>   The case had been moved to Torrance after Morse's attorney, John
Barnett, challenged Judge John Meigs, the only jurist who hears
felony trials in Inglewood. Then it was transferred to Hourigan after
prosecutors challenged Judge Andrew C. Kauffman.</TE>
<TE>   The next judge assigned to the case was William Hollingsworth, a
retired jurist who works part time. But the Torrance courtroom that
Hollingsworth shares with another judge will be occupied in October,
when the trial is set to begin. So Kauffman, who supervises the
Southwest District, found space in the Airport Courthouse and moved
the case there.</TE>
<TE>   District attorney spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons said prosecutors' main
concern is that the case be heard in a courthouse where a substantial
number of prospective jurors come from the Inglewood area. The office
filed a memorandum in downtown Los Angeles in July asking the court
to consider assigning the case to the district where the crime
occurred.</TE>
<TE>   Loyola Law School professor Laurie Levenson said the court is
sending a message to Inglewood residents that it is not ignoring
their concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they know what can happen when they are not responsive to
community concerns," she said, recalling the riots that occurred
after a Simi Valley jury acquitted Los Angeles police officers in the
Rodney G. King beating case. "They don't want to be blamed."</TE>
<TE>   But the defense could question whether the court is bowing to
public pressure, Levenson said.</TE>
<TE>   George Bird, a criminal defense attorney in the South Bay, said
courts should be independent and not worry about public criticism.
"In theory, the court should not be concerned about what the
perception is, because people have different perceptions," he said.
"Justice is blind."</TE>
<TE>   Crooks was identified as a fugitive after he gained instant
notoriety from the videotape. When prosecutors sought him for
violating probation in his Placer County case, he was publicly
supported by several Los Angeles County supervisors and Rep. Maxine
Waters (D-Los Angeles).</TE>
<TE>   Crooks failed to surrender as he had promised in 1999 to serve a
jail sentence for hit and run, petty theft and drunk driving.</TE>
<TE>   Crooks' lawyer, Dean Masserman, said his client "was at the mercy
of the court" and therefore agreed to an extra 115 days on top of the
original sentence of 210 days. Because of credits he can receive in
jail, Crooks is expected to be released by the end of the year.
Authorities in Placer County originally wanted him to serve an
additional 17 months for the probation violation, Masserman said.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke said Crooks
should serve his original time, but should not have been punished for
coming forward.</TE>
<TE>   "What he did I think is admirable," she said Wednesday. "We know
[this brutality] happens every day, but unless you have someone who
photographs it and puts it right in people's faces so they see it,
you're never going to get any changes."</TE>

<LD>Art Kevin, disc jockey turned radio newsman who broadcast live to RKO
network stations the fatal shooting of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy at the
Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles in June 1968 as he celebrated victory
in the California Democratic primary, has died. He was 67.</LD>
<LD>   Kevin, a leading news figure at Los Angeles stations, primarily
KHJ-AM and KMPC-AM, in the 1960s and '70s, died Thursday of lung
cancer at his home in suburban Las Vegas, his family said. Like many
newsmen of his generation, he had been a heavy smoker.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to reporting Kennedy's assassination by Sirhan Sirhan,
Kevin covered the campaigns of Ronald Reagan, Richard M. Nixon,
Eugene McCarthy, Nelson Rockefeller and Hubert H. Humphrey.</LD>
<TE>   He covered Cesar Chavez and his campaign for farm workers' rights,
civil rights marches in the South as well as the Vietnam War debates
and demonstrations.</TE>
<TE>   Born Art Ferraro in New York's Bronx, he started out as a disc
jockey on the night shift at WAVZ-AM in New Haven, Conn.</TE>
<TE>   With no newsmen on duty, Kevin "ripped and read" news stories
coming out of wire service ticker machines at hourly intervals in
addition to his record spinning. And when the ocean liner Andrea
Doria sank in New York Harbor on his watch, he was sent to cover it.</TE>
<TE>   "I got so turned on by that story ... that the bell rang and ... I
decided to become a newsman," Kevin told Drama-Logue.</TE>
<TE>   He moved to Los Angeles in 1959 to help develop the radio division
of United Press International, serving as its first West Coast bureau
chief. He became the first news director at radio station KEZY-FM,
then moved to KFAC-AM and KFI-AM.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin worked for KHJ from 1963 to 1972, first covering major news
stories and then serving as news director, public affairs director
and national news correspondent for RKO General Broadcasting. He
moved to KMPC in 1972 where he remained through 1978.</TE>
<TE>   In 1982, he moved to Nevada and started his own radio station,
which he ran until 1995. That was KRRI-FM in Boulder City, south of
Las Vegas, a station he designed with an oldies format.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin spent his final years operating a consulting business and
radio and television Web site with his wife, Jodi Lawrence, an author
and broadcaster he met when he interviewed her for KHJ.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin is survived by his wife, two sons and a daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Condolences can be sent to the e-mail address artkevintribute
@aol.com, and memorial donations can be made to the American Cancer
Society. No public service is planned.</TE>

<HD>Tom Key, 81; Berlin Airlift Pilot, Pacific Symphony Pioneer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BOEHM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tom Key, who was the first president of the Pacific Symphony and
served on its board for 19 years while watching it grow into
California's third-largest orchestra, has died. He was 81.</LD>
<LD>   Key, who was also a successful real estate broker and a Navy pilot
who flew 200 missions in the Berlin Airlift of 1948-49, died Tuesday
at his home in Fullerton from corticobasal degeneration, a rare brain
disorder.</LD>
<LD>   "He was an enthusiastic guy who would say, 'No obstacle is going
to get in our way--we're just going to go forward,' " said Jerry
Samuelson, dean of Cal State Fullerton's College of the Arts.</LD>
<TE>   Samuelson remembered joining with the late Marcelina "Marcy"
Mulville, the symphony's prime mover, to recruit Key in 1978 to help
launch Orange County's first orchestra. Key, who had settled in the
county in 1958, already was a supporter of Cal State Fullerton's arts
programs.</TE>
<TE>   When recession hit in the early 1980s, there was talk of canceling
concerts. Key took out personal loans to make sure the shows would go
on, said Lorraine Lippold, another early board member.</TE>
<TE>   She remembered Key as a man of small, thoughtful gestures--"little
things that most people wouldn't think about"--such as sending his
personal gardener to make sure the lawn and flowers in front of the
symphony's headquarters in Santa Ana were well-tended.</TE>
<TE>   When the Pacific Symphony reached perhaps its biggest
crossroads--the turbulent, closely contested board decision in 1989
to oust founding Music Director Keith Clark, who was respected more
for his drive than his musicianship--Key was a steadying influence.
"He was a major player in steering the orchestra through that
troubled time," said symphony Vice President Jim Medvitz.</TE>
<TE>   The symphony now operates on an annual budget of $11.5 million;
its venues during the early days included a theater at Knott's Berry
Farm and the auditorium at Santa Ana High School. It moved into its
current home, the 3,000-seat Orange County Performing Arts Center, in
1986.</TE>
<TE>   Other pioneering board members of the Pacific Symphony recalled
the 6-foot, 4-inch Key as a strikingly handsome and gregarious man
who was well-suited to the task of building support for a fledgling
arts organization.</TE>
<TE>   Key and his wife, Anne, were known for hosting post-concert
parties at their large, ranch-style home. There, prospective donors
and board members could be wined, dined and wooed.</TE>
<TE>   Often, musicians from the symphony would play at those parties,
and Key did not need much encouragement to pick up his trumpet--which
rested atop the family's grand piano--and blow along on a pop melody
or a big band jazz tune.</TE>
<TE>   Key, a graduate of the University of Washington, grew up in
Huntingdon, Tenn. He joined the Navy near the end of World War II.</TE>
<TE>   During the Berlin Airlift, he flew 560-mile round trips in Douglas
C-54 transports, dropping 10-ton loads of supplies over West Berlin
to help foil the Soviet blockade. Eighteen planes from that air
armada would crash during the 15-month operation, killing 79 people.
In 1998, the 50th anniversary of the airlift, Key told The Times that
his transport's hydraulic system failed once and he had to land it
with some of its controls inoperable.</TE>
<TE>   "The weather was the worst problem--freezing rain, wind,
lightning, poor visibility," Key recalled. "On top of that, the
Russians sent up planes to buzz us and tried to blind us with arc
lights. They were mean bastards, but we never deviated from our
course, not one degree."</TE>
<TE>   Key remained a small-plane aviator well into his 70s.</TE>
<TE>   Anne Key recalled Wednesday that her husband grew to love
classical music while listening to it to pass the time during his
military days. "On our second date he asked me to go to the Seattle
Symphony, and I was very impressed," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Eve Steinberg, who served on the Pacific Symphony's board during
its formative days recalled Key as "tireless."</TE>
<TE>   "What motivated him was just the desire to see this become great,"
Steinberg said. "I hope he knew this wouldn't have been without him.
I hope he knew how important he was."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his wife, Key is survived by three daughters,
Alexandra Key, Stephanie Key and Lizabeth Key Crosson; and three
grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service will be held at 11 a.m. Monday at the Episcopal
Church of St. Andrew in Fullerton, with a reception to follow at
Coyote Hills Country Club.</TE>
<TE>   In lieu of flowers, the family asks that donations be made to the
Neurological Degenerative Diseases Department at UC Irvine's College
of Medicine, 252 Irvine Hall, Irvine, CA 92697-3950.</TE>

<HD>Assembly Passes Bill to Raise Smoking Age</HD>
<DH>Health: The measure would bar those under 21 from buying
tobacco products. It now goes to the state Senate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON ORTIZ and MIGUEL BUSTILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The Assembly passed a measure Wednesday that would raise the legal
age for purchasing tobacco products in California to 21, siding with
health advocates despite concerns that the measure could hurt state
tax revenue.</LD>
<LD>   With the end of the legislative year looming, an Assembly
committee passed sweeping legislation that would bolster the privacy
protections enjoyed by California consumers, but only after watering
the bill down by adding a loophole sought by insurance companies.
However, another committee is expected to restore the bill to its
original form today, setting up a showdown when it hits the Assembly
floor.</LD>
<LD>   The tobacco legislation reached the Assembly after a bipartisan
group of lawmakers hollowed out the language of a Senate bill, SB
1680 by Sen. Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles), and injected the
provisions of a bill by Assemblyman Paul Koretz (D-West Hollywood).</LD>
<TE>   The measure would prevent anyone younger than 21 from legally
buying tobacco in the state. Assemblyman Rod Pacheco (R-Riverside)
carried the amended bill.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents have quietly criticized the timing of the measure
because it would dry up about $26 million in state tax revenues from
tobacco taxes.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people have actually come to me with a straight face and
said they're opposing this measure because the state would lose
money," Pacheco said during the Assembly floor debate. "Can you
believe it?"</TE>
<TE>   But others said the state did not need to protect 18-to
21-year-olds from the right to buy cigarettes, arguing that people
that age should have the chance to decide for themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Dennis Mountjoy (R-Monrovia) called the measure
"government nannyism."</TE>
<TE>   "Are you going to tell members of the armed forces that they can't
smoke in this state?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   Koretz defended the measure, citing studies that indicate people
are less likely to develop a smoking habit after age 21.</TE>
<TE>   "This bill will save lives of young people who will never take up
smoking during those crucial last years between 18 and 21," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The measure passed on a bipartisan 42-10 vote. It now goes back to
the Senate and, if passed there, to Gov. Gray Davis</TE>
<TE>   The privacy bill, SB 773 by Sen. Jackie Speier (D-Hillsborough),
would prevent banks and other financial firms from selling or trading
a customer's personal information without their consent to prevent
"financial profiling" and other abuses criticized by consumer groups.</TE>
<TE>   It narrowly cleared the Assembly Banking and Finance Committee,
which has been a graveyard for consumer protection legislation in
recent years--but only after lawmakers led by Republican Phil Wyman
of Tehachapi added a hostile amendment to the measure sought by
insurance companies.</TE>
<TE>   "No one should disregard or misrepresent the actions of this
committee," said committee Chairman Lou Papan (D-Millbrae) at the
start of the proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   "No one was bought out by any specific industry or special
interest. Such allegations are totally degrading to the process."</TE>
<TE>   The change, which outraged consumer groups, would allow the
companies to share a customer's information with affiliates without
notifying the person that they were going to do so--a loophole that
would allow widespread sharing, since many insurers are part of large
financial conglomerates.</TE>
<TE>   Speier's bill originally would have required almost all firms to
send customers simple, clearly written notices before sharing or
selling their information--even if they were planning to share it
within their "family of companies."</TE>
<TE>   Though the bill was amended Wednesday, it is expected to be
restored to its original form today when it goes before the more
sympathetic Assembly Judiciary Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers said Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City)
dressed down Papan for not allowing Assemblyman Joe Nation (D-San
Rafael), who is a coauthor of the privacy bill with Speier, to return
it to its original form in his committee after Nation gathered the
votes to beat back the GOP amendments.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Sen. Don Perata (D-Oakland) confirmed that he will
introduce legislation to prevent cities from passing so-called
predatory-lending laws stronger than the one the state implemented
this year.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Gov. Davis signed legislation by Assemblywoman Carole
Migden (D-San Francisco) that imposed penalties on financial firms
that target the poor with mortgages at rates they cannot
realistically pay. Critics refer to that practice as predatory
lending.</TE>
<TE>   ''It's time to step backward and see how [the current law]
works,'' Perata said.</TE>
<TE>   He fears that low-income people in his district will be unable to
get credit for home ownership from mortgage banks, Perata said. He
accused consumer activists of breaking an agreement he said was
adopted last year in which the activists promised not to seek
stricter predatory lending ordinances at the local level</TE>
<TE>   The measure by Migden was the result of a compromise between the
assemblywoman and lenders, and was not as strong as some consumer
groups had hoped. So some have taken their fight to the local level.
Oakland passed a stronger predatory lending law earlier this year,
and the Los Angeles City Council is weighing one as well.</TE>
<TE>   Norma Garcia of Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports
magazine, said the legislation being sought by lenders would enact a
moratorium on local predatory-lending laws for as long as five
years--and would be retroactive, eradicating any possible Los Angeles
law passed this year.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a hijacking at the end of the session, and it's injurious
to the public," Garcia said. "What this is about is trying to shut
down the city of L.A."</TE>

<HD>Math Scores Equal Success</HD>
<DH>Education: Uniform programs and improved teacher training
are cited in L.A. elementary schools' improvement in standardized
test scores.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SOLOMON MOORE and ERIKA HAYASAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Do the math: The Los Angeles Unified School District's math test
scores are rising fast in elementary grades. For example, as many as
52% of Los Angeles third-graders placed at or above the national
average in newly released Stanford 9 scores, up from 28% in 1998.</LD>
<LD>   Standardized elementary math programs and better teacher training
led to those rises, district officials and education experts said.
Efforts to improve reading also contributed to the higher math
scores, with students better able to follow instructions and
understand concepts.</LD>
<LD>   District elementary schools have moved away from a hodgepodge of
more than a dozen math programs, some of which emphasized classroom
interaction instead of following formal lesson plans in textbooks.
Now only two state-approved math textbooks, stressing fundamental
skills, are used for each of the lower grades across the district.</LD>
<TE>   Some elementary schools used to offer math two or three days a
week, but now all are required to offer daily lessons of at least an
hour.</TE>
<TE>   "Teachers are being trained to do the same thing with the same
books," said Sue Shannon, assistant superintendent for instruction.
The district is trying to synchronize its math programs so that every
elementary school and every class is on the same lesson at the same
time.</TE>
<TE>   Shannon said that such systematization makes teacher training more
effective and tracks schools' progress more closely.</TE>
<TE>   In the last year, the district has trained 360 math coaches to
spearhead math reforms at all elementary schools, said Dianna
Masters, the district's director of math instruction. And 40% of all
elementary school math teachers have participated in a 120-hour
training course conducted by UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Starting this year, elementary students will take quarterly
diagnostic tests so that teachers will know which math skills need
more emphasis and which students need extra help. Schools also are
required to report, on a quarterly basis, how many teachers have
volunteered for training workshops.</TE>
<TE>   However, high school math programs have yet to show the kind of
gains achieved in lower grades. Most Los Angeles high school and
middle school students still scored below the 35th percentile. (The
national average is the 50th percentile.) But district math experts
said upper grades will improve as students benefiting from the
elementary school programs move up and the district focuses on high
school math reform.</TE>
<TE>   Statewide standards adopted two years ago for math instruction are
driving the training programs, the selection of textbooks and lesson
plans in elementary math classes, said math education experts.</TE>
<TE>   "When California adopted world-class standards, it made a huge
difference at the classroom level," said David Klein, a math
education professor at Cal State Northridge. "And when you have good
standards, success has very little to do with whether teachers are
credentialed or uncredentialed."</TE>
<TE>   Half of L.A. Unified's teachers lack full credentials, district
figures show.</TE>
<TE>   Klein also said good math instruction can overcome traditional
learning barriers such as poverty and language. Stanford 9 test
results show that African American and Latino elementary school
students made greater gains in math scores--8% and 9.5%
respectively--than in any other subject.</TE>
<TE>   "Math is a worldwide monoculture and has nothing to do with skin
color or poverty," Klein said.</TE>
<TE>   In the last four years, the percentage of Los Angeles Unified
students who placed at or above the national average on the Stanford
9 math test increased from 31% to 53% in second grade, 25% to 46% in
fourth grade and 26% to 42% in fifth grade. Statewide scores will be
released next week.</TE>
<TE>   "Just that they've sustained this rise over a four-year period is
really impressive," said Gerald Hayward, co-director of the
Berkeley-based Policy Analysis for California Education. Even
accounting for the emphasis on exam preparation, Hayward said, the
Los Angeles increases were significant. "Very few people would have
predicted that by 2002 over half the [elementary] kids would be
exceeding the national norm" on the Stanford 9 test.</TE>
<TE>   Reading and language arts test scores have improved dramatically
in elementary schools as well, and teachers said that helps to
improve math performance.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford 9 test results show that the average second-and
third-grader--who is most likely to have had two years in the highly
structured Open Court reading program--scored above the national
average in math.</TE>
<TE>   Karen Robertson, principal at Dena Elementary on the Eastside,
said teachers now spend time making sure "children really understand
words that the math series are using and understand what it means."</TE>
<TE>   Fourth-graders at the year-round Dena campus scored on average in
the 39th percentile in the recent Stanford 9 tests. In 1998, they
scored in the 18th percentile nationally in math.</TE>
<TE>   Among the worst-performing schools in math in 1998 was South Park
Elementary in South-Central Los Angeles, which scored in the 15th
percentile nationally for math. This year, fourth-grade students at
South Park scored in the 48th math percentile.</TE>
<TE>   Of the school's 1,263 students, 700 learned English as their
second language.</TE>
<TE>   Karen Rose, principal at South Park for 10 years, said the Math
Land program used there in the past was one of the causes of
students' difficulties with math.</TE>
<TE>   Math Land "was terrible. It was terrible," she said. "It was
disconnected; it wasn't standards-based. It was a mishmash."</TE>
<TE>   Education experts said Math Land was analogous to the now
abandoned Whole Language approach in language arts in its emphasis on
individual discovery and student interaction. Masters said Math Land
relied on exercises using objects such as pickup sticks and marbles
instead of formal drills.</TE>
<TE>   She recalled one lesson that had students invent their own
mathematical formulas and discuss them in class.</TE>
<TE>   The new math programs and their texts consistently build on a few
basic skills such as problem solving, estimates and measurements.</TE>
<TE>   High school math scores in L.A. Unified still lag behind the rest
of the nation partly because programs are uncoordinated and use
various texts, Masters said.</TE>
<TE>   There are fewer qualified teachers in upper-level math than in
elementary grades, and the district hasn't been able to attract
enough people to fill its high school math positions, she said. Next
year, new professional development seminars will be offered at UCLA
for math teachers in the higher grades.</TE>
<TE>   Teacher training workshops can help, said Cal State Northridge's
Klein, but middle and high school math demands such specific
knowledge that in-service programs alone will not be enough.</TE>
<TE>   The real solution will be to hire more teachers fully credentialed
to teach high school math.</TE>
<TE>   "The nature of mathematics is that it's the most hierarchical of
all human endeavors," Klein said. "You can't go to the top until you
master the lower levels, and many teachers haven't even mastered the
basics.''</TE>

<CX>   Math scores--A story in Thursday's California section about improved
Stanford 9 math test scores in the Los Angeles Unified School
District incorrectly quoted David Klein, a Cal State Northridge
professor, as saying that some high school math teachers had not
mastered basic subject matter. In fact, his quote should have read:
"You can't go to the top until you master the lower levels, and many
students haven't even mastered the basics." The story also stated
that half of the district's teachers lack full credentials. Actually,
25% are employed with emergency credentials, according to the
district.</CX>

<HD>Bus Driver Accused of Running Over, Killing Homeless Man
Freed on Bail</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KURT STREETER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles County bus driver charged with manslaughter after he
ran his bus over a homeless man during a weekend altercation on
Wilshire Boulevard was released from custody on Wednesday after
posting bail.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors this week charged Cruz Vaca with a single count of
felony vehicular manslaughter. Vaca, 39, a driver for the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority, pleaded not guilty at a brief
hearing in Los Angeles Superior Court on Tuesday. Until posting a
$50,000 bail, he was being held in County Jail.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, police presented what they said were new details
regarding the fatal Saturday evening altercation between Vaca and the
homeless man, who has not been identified by the coroner's office.</LD>
<TE>   About 6 p.m. Saturday, Vaca was driving his MTA bus east on
Wilshire in the Koreatown district. At a stop, the homeless man
attempted to get on Vaca's bus but was not allowed to board. Police
said that the homeless man two weeks ago had been kicked off Vaca's
bus and that he had spit on the driver.</TE>
<TE>   According to police and witnesses, when he was not allowed to get
on the bus Saturday, the man stood outside the bus banging on the
front doors. Vaca told him: "You are not going to get on my bus,"
David Thompson, a passenger seated directly behind the driver, told
The Times.</TE>
<TE>   Frustrated, the homeless man then stood directly in front of the
bus, trying to prevent it from leaving, police and Thompson said.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with police, Vaca allegedly said he wanted to
drive away to end the argument with the homeless man. As he prepared
to pull away, Vaca told police, he looked out his side-view mirror to
check traffic and did not realize that the man had slipped and was
lying on the street. Vaca told investigators that he began to drive
his bus forward, then realized that he had run over the man.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson, who said he also spoke at length to police, described
the face-off between the homeless man and the bus driver as a "test
of wills."</TE>
<TE>   "He was not going to let the bus go forward without getting on,"
Thompson said.</TE>
<TE>   Passengers could hear and feel several thumps as the bus began
moving, Thompson said. After yelling at the driver to stop, Thompson
ran out to see what happened. He found the man lying under the bus
near the rear wheels, his pants nearly torn off. Thompson said the
man was unresponsive and appeared to be dead.</TE>
<TE>   Vaca never got off the bus, said Thompson. A woman at the scene
called police, using her cell phone, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Vaca was originally booked on a murder charge and jailed on
$1-million bail. But police later said it would be very difficult to
prosecute Vaca on a murder charge because it would be hard to prove
that he intended to kill the man.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like somebody heard the driver kick the guy off the bus
and say, 'I'm going to kill him,' " said Det. Tom Murrell, of the Los
Angeles Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   Vaca faces up to six years in state prison if convicted.</TE>

<HD>2 Ex-Officers Sent to Prison for Drug Theft</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two former police officers were sentenced to prison Wednesday for
their roles in a ring that stole 650 pounds of cocaine from an
evidence locker.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Wilcox, 42, a former California Highway Patrol officer,
received a 63-month sentence after pleading guilty in Los Angeles
federal court to conspiring to distribute cocaine and to structuring
a bank deposit to avoid federal reporting requirements.</LD>
<LD>   The Fresno resident testified earlier this year against
co-defendant Michael Ruelas, 42, also a former CHP officer, who was
convicted of stealing the drug from an evidence locker at the state
Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement office over the July 4 holiday in
1997.</LD>
<TE>   Previously convicted in the theft--the largest ever from a law
enforcement agency in California--was the mastermind, Richard Wayne
Parker, 47, a veteran state narcotics agent assigned to the Riverside
office.</TE>
<TE>   Parker is serving a life term. Ruelas, his half-brother, has not
yet been sentenced. Also sentenced Wednesday was former Pima County
(Ariz.) sheriff's deputy James Tracy Strickler, who received a
two-year prison term for knowing about the Riverside theft and
failing to report the crime.</TE>
<TE>   Though Strickler did not participate in the theft, federal
prosecutors said that as a member of Parker's ring, he stole small
amounts of drugs and cash from the homes of suspected narcotics
dealers.</TE>

<HD>Paramount's Cows Might Find It Hard to Escape Because They

<LD>Years ago, the city of Paramount styled itself the Hay Capital of the
United States. Perhaps it was with that agrarian period in mind that
a resident phoned the city to warn that one of its fences was broken.</LD>
<LD>   She "suggested we fix it 'before the cows got away,' " said the
city's newsletter.</LD>
<LD>   It wasn't clear whether she understood that the cows behind the
fence were only metal cut-outs of the decorative variety.</LD>
<TE>   Chewing some more on that one: Still, the caller's advice wasn't
bad. The newsletter said several of the make-believe mooers have been
purloined in recent weeks. One rustler even used a dolly. The city
knew this because dolly and cow were "abandoned about half a mile
from the site. Apparently, the 350-pound dogie just didn't want to
git along."</TE>
<TE>   From cows to pigs: An ad for trousers that might pair well with
scrambled eggs was spotted by Don Maddox of Tarzana (see
accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   New Cabinet post? Don Cook of Cathedral City came upon a White
House department I wasn't aware of (see photo). Wonder if it's a
successor to the Nixon administration's plumbers unit?</TE>
<TE>   Clear on the concept: Jolene Collins of Tujunga found a shoe offer
that targeted a relevant market (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Does his HMO know about this: A healer's ad came to the attention
of Elizabeth Kiel of San Diego (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Harrumph for Hollywood! "Hookers Nix Canuck Pix" read the headline
in Daily Variety, referring to a protest by prostitutes, panhandlers
and drug users over Hollywood's use of downtown Vancouver as a
frequent filming site.</TE>
<TE>   A letter sent to 30 production firms by the Vancouver Area Network
of Drug Users said, "Sex trade workers must be compensated for
displacement they experience at your hands in the same manner you
would compensate a business.... The same must hold true for homeless
people you push from beneath a bridge or doorway, and drug users you
move from a park."</TE>
<TE>   The Vancouver Sun endorsed the campaign, editorializing that "we
see no reason why any unorthodox entrepreneur should be treated
differently from other businesses .... "</TE>
<TE>   Gee, I hope this doesn't give any film people the idea that
purchasing drugs on the street there would be a public service.</TE>
<TE>   Annals of strange crimes: The police log of the Los Alamitos
News-Enterprise reported that "a woman said a man helped her bring
groceries into her apartment, looked around the residence while she
put them away, tried to adjust her thermostat, then left [her] a
message about the air-conditioning unit before leaving at her
request."</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: At last, a rejoinder to that civic insult of a license
plate that so many readers have seen: YMINLA. Kevin Iga of Calabasas
spotted the reply on an SUV in Santa Monica: OK2BNLA.</TE>
<TE>   OK, it's not an overwhelming endorsement, but it's a start.</TE>

<HD>Residents OK Tax to Help Buy Parkland in the Santa Monicas</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WENDY THERMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a victory for parkland supporters, Los Angeles residents of the
Santa Monica Mountains have voted overwhelmingly to tax themselves so
that undeveloped land near their homes can be bought and preserved as
wilderness.</LD>
<LD>   "This is the last opportunity to turn open space that would be
developed into open space for people and wildlife," Sherman Oaks
resident Arnold Newman said after the results of a mail-in ballot
were announced Wednesday. "And it will be done for the smallest
ticket price imaginable: $40."</LD>
<LD>   Opponents of the tax said they plan to file a lawsuit against the
Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority, a regional park
agency, that will challenge the formation of two adjacent tax
districts stretching from Griffith Park to Topanga State Park.</LD>
<TE>   Among those casting ballots, 77% of property owners east of the
San Diego Freeway and 68% west of the freeway voted for the tax.</TE>
<TE>   Park agency officials said the tax zone was divided in two so that
the money collected in each district would be spent near the homes
benefiting from newly purchased open space. About one-fifth of the
60,000 eligible property owners voted.</TE>
<TE>   "You're taxing a lot of people for a benefit that's going to go to
a few people," said Jack Allen, a former city attorney for Beverly
Hills and chief critic of the parkland assessment. "If a property has
a view protected by the open space, only the people adjacent will
benefit."</TE>
<TE>   Each owner of a single-family home will pay $40 annually for 30
years. Businesses will pay about $120 per acre, and apartment owners
will pay on a sliding scale. Votes were weighted, based on the amount
of assessment to be paid, but that affected the outcome in both
districts by less than 0.5% when compared to a ballot-by-ballot
count. A simple majority vote was needed to approve the new tax
districts.</TE>
<TE>   The four-member park agency board met Wednesday to announce the
ballot results, tabulated by a Bay Area firm, and voted unanimously
to form the two districts.</TE>
<TE>   Board Chairman Jerry Daniel said he was ecstatic about the vote's
wide margin in favor of the tax. "We want to keep our open spaces
preserved for our children and grandchildren," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Allen criticized the park agency's campaign for the tax districts,
bounded largely by Ventura Boulevard on the north and Sunset
Boulevard on the south.</TE>
<TE>   "We got outspent by a long shot," he said, adding that opponents
barely had time to organize after they learned about the proposed tax
districts in May.</TE>
<TE>   The tax will funnel about $2 million annually to the park agency,
which already owns at least 35,000 acres of open space in the Santa
Monica Mountains. A list of dozens of possible acquisitions, many a
few acres or less, has been drawn up, but the park agency board has
not decided which ones will be purchased. About $5 of every $40
collected will go toward brush clearance.</TE>
<TE>   Rosemary Woodlock of Woodland Hills complained to the board
Wednesday that voters were shortchanged because they had no way of
knowing if purchases would benefit their neighborhoods. "This looks
like one of the most foolish rushes to judgment I've seen in a long
time," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But Wendy-Sue Rosen of Mandeville Canyon said the board vote was
"a great victory for the quality of life and for preserving what
little open space we have left."</TE>
<TE>   Daniel said the tax zone is a new approach by his agency to raise
funds. It is primarily intended to benefit people living nearby, but
anyone will be able to hike or picnic on new land that the agency
acquires, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Marin and Santa Clara counties also have used tax districts to
preserve open space, park officials said.</TE>

<HD>Residents OK Levy to Buy, Preserve Land in Santa Monica
Mountains</HD>
<DH>Nature: Opponents plan to file a lawsuit against regional
park agency, saying too few owners in the two tax districts will
benefit from the $40 annual assessment.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In a victory for parkland supporters, Los Angeles residents of the
Santa Monica Mountains have voted overwhelmingly to tax themselves so
that undeveloped land near their homes can be bought and preserved as
wilderness.</LD>
<LD>   "This is the last opportunity to turn open space that would be
developed into open space for people and wildlife," Sherman Oaks
resident Arnold Newman said after the results of a mail-in ballot
were announced Wednesday. "And it will be done for the smallest
ticket price imaginable--$40."</LD>
<LD>   Opponents of the tax said they plan to file a lawsuit against the
Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority, a regional park
agency, that will challenge the formation of two adjacent tax
districts stretching from Griffith Park to Topanga State Park.</LD>
<TE>   Seventy-seven percent of property owners east of the San Diego
Freeway and 68% west of the freeway voted in favor of the tax.</TE>
<TE>   Park agency officials said the tax zone was divided in two so that
the money collected in each district would be spent near the homes
benefiting from newly purchased open space. About one-fifth of the
60,000 eligible property owners voted.</TE>
<TE>   "You're taxing a lot of people for a benefit that's going to go to
a few people," said Jack Allen, a former city attorney for Beverly
Hills and chief critic of the parkland assessment.</TE>
<TE>   "If a property has a view protected by the open space, only the
people adjacent will benefit."</TE>
<TE>   Each single-family homeowner will pay $40 annually for 30 years.
Businesses will pay about $120 per acre, and apartment owners will
pay on a sliding scale. Votes were weighted, based on the amount of
assessment to be paid, but that affected the outcome in both
districts by less than one half of 1% when compared to a
ballot-by-ballot count. A simple majority vote was needed to approve
the new tax districts.</TE>
<TE>   The four-member park agency board met Wednesday to announce the
ballot results, tabulated by a Bay Area firm, and voted unanimously
to form the two districts.</TE>
<TE>   Board Chairman Jerry Daniel said he was "thrilled and ecstatic"
about the vote's wide margin in favor of the tax. "We want to keep
our open spaces preserved for our children and grandchildren," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Allen criticized the park agency's campaign for the tax districts,
bounded by Ventura Boulevard on the north and Sunset Boulevard on the
south.</TE>
<TE>   "We got outspent by a long shot," he said, adding that opponents
barely had time to organize after they learned about the proposed tax
districts in May.</TE>
<TE>   The tax will funnel about $2 million annually to the park agency,
which already owns at least 35,000 acres of wilderness in the Santa
Monica Mountains. A list of dozens of possible acquisitions, many a
few acres or less, has been drawn up, but the park agency board has
not decided which ones will be purchased. About $5 of every $40
collected will go toward brush clearance on parcels owned by the park
agency.</TE>
<TE>   Rosemary Woodlock of Woodland Hills complained to the board
Wednesday that voters were shortchanged because they have no way of
knowing whether future purchases will benefit their neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   "This looks like one of the most foolish rushes to judgment I've
seen in a long time," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But Wendy-Sue Rosen, a Mandeville Canyon resident, said the
board's vote was "a great victory for the quality of life and for
preserving what little open space we have left."</TE>
<TE>   Daniel said the tax zone is a new approach by his agency to raise
funds. It is primarily intended to benefit people living nearby, but
anyone will be able to hike or picnic on new land that the agency
acquires, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Marin and Santa Clara counties also have used tax districts to
preserve open space, park officials said.</TE>

<LD>Dick O'Connell, 87, a baseball executive who was a leading figure in
the revival of the Boston Red Sox in the 1960s, died Sunday at a
nursing home in Lexington, Mass.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Winthrop, Mass., O'Connell graduated from Boston College
and served in Navy intelligence on the staff of Adm. Chester Nimitz
during World War II. O'Connell joined the Red Sox organization after
the war, serving in a variety of minor league positions.</LD>
<LD>   He was named the club's executive vice president of baseball and
business operations in 1961.</LD>
<TE>   In 1965, O'Connell took over as the general manager of a club that
had a dismal record and was on its way to losing 100 games.</TE>
<TE>   The team lost 90 games the next year. But before the 1967 season,
O'Connell hired Dick Williams as manager. The Red Sox won the pennant
that year in what was to be the first of a number of winning seasons.
They also won the pennant in 1975, but in both instances lost in the
World Series.</TE>
<TE>   O'Connell remained with the Red Sox until 1977, when he was fired
by Jean Yawkey, the widow of the club's longtime owner, Tom Yawkey.</TE>

<HD>Santa Paula Boundary Initiative Heads to Court</HD>
<DH>Measure F: Backers want to delete voter guide statements by
foes that they say are false.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Supporters of Santa Paula's Measure F are asking a judge to delete
what they call "false and misleading" statements filed by opponents
about how the initiative would affect city growth.</LD>
<LD>   Measure F, set to appear on the Nov. 5 ballot, asks voters whether
5,400-acre Adams Canyon should be included in the city's growth
boundary.</LD>
<LD>   Arguments against the measure submitted for an information guide
falsely tell voters that a yes vote would allow a massive 2,200-home
development to be built there, supporters of the measure said.</LD>
<TE>   The initiative's backers are taking their fight to court next
week, when they will ask a judge to delete statements that they said
are false or misleading.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Garfield, who favors the initiative, said the measure asks
only for approval to change the city's growth boundary. If it is
approved, any development proposal that follows would still have to
go through several public reviews, including approval by the City
Council, before construction could occur.</TE>
<TE>   "They are not saying that at some point a development will come
forward," said Garfield, a Realtor and former city councilman. "They
are saying that this vote will allow the development. They are
offering conjecture. Who knows what form that proposal will take?"</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of the initiative could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   A hearing is set for Wednesday before Superior Court Judge Melinda
Johnson. The petitioners want Johnson to order Santa Paula City Clerk
Steven J. Salas to delete the material that they say is untrue.</TE>
<TE>   County Clerk Richard Dean, who supervises elections in Ventura
County, would be asked to do the same. Although ballots will begin to
be printed this week, Dean said it should not be a problem to delete
material if ordered to do so.</TE>
<TE>   Initiatives come near the end of the ballot and are usually the
last part of the package to be printed, Dean said. But the clerk's
office cannot wait beyond next week to finish printing, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Paula's growth debate has intensified in recent years. When
most other cities in the county passed growth limits in 1998, Santa
Paula rejected the effort.</TE>
<TE>   But in 2000, voters approved Measure I, which drew a growth
boundary around the city. The initiative now before voters seeks to
redraw that line to include Adams Canyon.</TE>

<HD>On the Trails of Serial Rapists</HD>
<DH>Crime: Two suspects have been arrested, leaving several at
large in the Southland. All have different hallmarks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARLA HALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In Torrance, he's brazen. He hasn't physically struck his victims,
according to police, but he's audacious enough to attack in daylight.
In Long Beach, he's methodical. He seems to have researched his
victims, knowing they are alone and preying on them only then. And in
Hancock Park, he was so obvious, or careless, he got
caught--allegedly.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps the strongest commonality among the three serial rapists
is that they are terrorizing the Los Angeles area this summer. Most
law enforcement officials say the number of serial rapists has not
increased, but there's been more media attention.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, Long Beach police added more people to their rape task
force because it was inundated with calls a day after Cmdr. Linda
Beardslee, who heads the task force, held a news conference
describing the assailant's method and exhorting the public to be
observant. The Long Beach rapist's attacks go back to 1996; the most
recent attempt was last Thursday, according to Long Beach police.</LD>
<TE>   Sean Tanabe, the lead detective on the case of the Torrance rapist
who is suspected of attacking three women from July 4 to July 29,
said this is the first serial rapist he's encountered in the three
years he's worked on sex crimes in the city.</TE>
<TE>   "That's not to say these acts haven't been committed," he said.
(It's unclear whether the same criminal is responsible for an
attempted rape July 22 in the area.)</TE>
<TE>   Rape is notoriously underreported, said Gail Abarbanel, director
of the Rape Treatment Center at Santa Monica-UCLA Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   "All rapists are serial rapists, and they're very big recidivist
offenders," said Abarbanel, who was trained and worked as a social
worker before becoming involved in the treatment of rape victims.
"They usually commit far more rapes than they get arrested for or
convicted for."</TE>
<TE>   Although the rapes that have been getting public attention the
last few months appear to be cases in which the rapist is a stranger,
most rapes, Abarbanel said, are committed by people the victim
knows--a friend, neighbor, colleague, fellow student, someone met at
a party or club.</TE>
<TE>   "You're more likely to report a stranger rape than an acquaintance
rape to authorities," Abarbanel said, adding that victims of a rapist
they know often fear retaliation from the person or blame from the
community.</TE>
<TE>   "Acquaintance rape is just as criminal, just as devastating to the
victim as stranger rape. The penal code doesn't distinguish between
stranger rape and acquaintance rape."</TE>
<TE>   Abarbanel doesn't subscribe to the theory that there are more
rapes in the summer because people leave doors and windows open. Los
Angeles is temperate year round, she notes.</TE>
<TE>   Moses Castillo, a Los Angeles police detective in the special rape
section of the Robbery-Homicide Division, said people should always
be on alert, not just this summer. Many criminals progress from
thieves to rapists, Castillo said.</TE>
<TE>   "Every three seconds, someone's house is being burglarized, so the
chances of someone being sexually assaulted are high," Castillo said.</TE>
<TE>   But rapes occur in a wide variety of places, Abarbanel said. "If I
told you where every rape happened, you wouldn't go anywhere," she
said. "It happens everywhere."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department on Wednesday
announced that DNA evidence now has linked attacks on five girls in
southeast Los Angeles County to one man.</TE>
<TE>   That spree began a year ago, and the last two attacks were in
February, Deputy Brian Lendman said. The attacker has struck once in
North Long Beach and four times in Paramount. He's described as pudgy
and has been spotted in a white compact sedan and on a BMX bicycle.</TE>
<TE>   And on Tuesday, sheriff's investigators arrested a Thousand Oaks
tile setter they suspect is a serial rapist on suspicion of three
sexual assaults in the city during the past four years.</TE>
<TE>   Narcisso Solis, 40, was about to be released after spending the
weekend behind bars on a drunk driving arrest when DNA tests
allegedly linked him to the assaults. Authorities suspect he also is
responsible for at least two other unsolved rape cases in Thousand
Oaks, and they've notified other law enforcement agencies in Ventura
and Los Angeles counties about his arrest and possible link to more
cases.</TE>
<TE>   According to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Program, there were
90,186 forcible rapes reported in 2000 (the most recent year for
final statistics).</TE>
<TE>   "I see about 1,000 cases myself" each year, said Abarbanel, who
contends that the FBI figure is substantially lower than the reality
because so many victims do not tell the authorities.</TE>
<TE>   The Types of Rapists</TE>
<TE>   Whether rapists are strangers or acquaintances of their victims,
most fall roughly into four profiles: the power-reassurance rapist,
the power-assertive rapist, the anger-retaliation rapist and the
anger-excitation rapist, or sadist. Two other categories account for
a very small number of rapists: opportunistic rapists and gang
rapists.</TE>
<TE>   The typology, developed by the FBI and often used by law
enforcement, is based on the seminal 1970s research of psychologist
A. Nicholas Groth, author of "Men Who Rape: The Psychology of the
Offender."</TE>
<TE>   Criminal profilers warn against using the typology rigidly. "These
are simply starting points," said Roy Hazelwood, a former supervisory
special agent in the behavioral science unit at the FBI Academy who
researched rapists and was instrumental in developing the typology.</TE>
<TE>   The power-reassurance rapist attacks "to reassure himself of his
own masculinity," said Hazelwood, who has written about sexually
violent criminals and still does behavioral research. "He is the
least violent of all rapists, but he's also the most cautious. He
selects his victims through window peeping and/or surveillance."</TE>
<TE>   Castillo said of these types of rapists, "They like a surprise
approach. They like victims to be alone or with small children. They
use minimum force to get control. If they get any resistance, they
will generally negotiate--'Just take it easy, if you do what I say,
you won't be harmed'--or threaten--'Look, I have a gun.' "</TE>
<TE>   The FBI's profiles also reveal that they are often single or
experiencing difficulty in a relationship, possibly living alone or
with their parents. Often their mothers have been domineering.</TE>
<TE>   The power-assertive rapist, on the other hand, is using rape to
express his virility, dominance and superiority. If resisted, the
power-assertive rapist will slap or curse. He usually tears off his
victim's clothes. "He might have a preconceived idea that there are
wrongs in his life and this is his time to get even," Castillo said.</TE>
<TE>   They generally attack away from their own neighborhoods, in the
evenings from around 7 p.m. to 1 a.m., sometimes prowling bars for
victims.</TE>
<TE>   "They could convince someone to come home with them," Castillo
said. "It might be on a second or third date. These cases are
difficult to prosecute because a lot of times the victim won't report
it, thinking, 'Well, I asked for it.' "</TE>
<TE>   The anger-retaliation rapist "is getting even with women for real
or imagined wrongs," Hazelwood said. "He just doesn't like women and
he makes no attempt to conceal that fact."</TE>
<TE>   Violent and impulsive, he can end up killing a victim or injuring
her so badly she needs hospitalization. "There's no pattern to his
assaults, which makes it difficult to catch him."</TE>
<TE>   Enjoys Causing Pain</TE>
<TE>   The sadistic rapist wants to inflict emotional and physical pain
and is aroused by his victim's suffering. "He's the predator of all
predators when it comes to rapists," Hazelwood said. "He's the most
meticulous." He may carry supplies--gloves, tape, rope--and have a
location for his crime selected. According to Castillo, the FBI
classification guide categorizes the sadist as usually in his 30s,
middle-class and often college-educated.</TE>
<TE>   The least frequently encountered types are the opportunistic
rapist--for example, a burglar in a home who finds a woman there and
suddenly decides to rape her--and the gang rapists, a group of three
or more males who assault for each other's approval, according to
Hazelwood.</TE>
<TE>   A rapist is often caught after he makes mistakes, gets spotted or
brags about his crimes. Sometimes, his downfall comes when a victim
doesn't react as he expected. "I have one guy where the victim was 90
years old," Castillo said. "She had a Medic-Alert around her neck,
she activated that, the paramedics came and chased him and caught
him."</TE>
<TE>   Hazelwood said it would be "close to impossible" to boil down into
a few tips how to confront a rapist based on type. The victim might
have only seconds to assess not only the rapist's type but also the
location and her own strengths and weaknesses.</TE>
<TE>   He does offer basic safety precautions: "If it doesn't look right
or feel right, don't do it. Don't go home with strangers. Lock your
windows and doors." Hazelwood notes that securing your home may
discourage a power-reassurance rapist. "He's got a fantasy of a
sexual relationship," Hazelwood said. "If he has to break a window or
use a crowbar, that increases the possibility she's alerted and will
resist, and that breaks his fantasy."</TE>
<TE>   The rapist lurking in Hancock Park and Hollywood often knocked on
doors and struck up conversation to gain admittance to houses. Or he
sneaked into homes.</TE>
<TE>   The suspect in those assaults, Gary David Johnson, was arrested
last Thursday after a sharp-eyed volunteer for a nonprofit Jewish
medical emergency group noticed a suspicious man talking on an
intercom outside a residence in the Fairfax district. The volunteer,
in his car, trailed the man and phoned two other volunteers who
picked up the surveillance, watching the man walk around, order ice
cream at a mini-mall and ring another doorbell. After consulting the
police flier describing the Hancock Park rapist, the volunteers
called the police on a cell phone.</TE>
<TE>   The Long Beach rapist has frustrated police there for half a
decade. Police can trace his crimes back to 1996 in Seattle. His
first reported attack in Long Beach was in January 1997. Police know
that over the last six years, he has raped 11 times, choosing victims
ranging in age from 32 to 80. Most of those crimes were committed in
the Long Beach area but others were in Los Alamitos and Huntington
Beach. Two of those rapes occurred this year, in May and August.</TE>
<TE>   Police contend he has also tried unsuccessfully to rape three
women this year. Two of his attempts came barely more than 24 hours
apart--late on Aug. 13 and early in the morning Aug. 15.</TE>
<TE>   "Assuming this is the same guy that we're connecting to the 11,
it's very unique that the same person might strike twice in 24
hours," said Long Beach Police Sgt. Paul LeBaron. "Due to the fact
that that hasn't happened in the past [with this criminal], that
concerns us."</TE>
<TE>   Since the rapist usually strikes during darkness and either covers
his own face or that of his victims, no one knows his ethnic
background, much less the details of what he looks like.</TE>
<TE>   "You seem to have a person who's doing his research," LeBaron
said. "And it makes it difficult to find him." Two years ago, amid
much publicity, Long Beach police arrested a man on suspicion of the
rapes attributed to the Long Beach rapist but eventually cleared him
of those assaults through DNA evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Last Thursday morning, when the serial rapist is believed to have
attacked again in Long Beach, his face was covered but he was nude
and his would-be victim scratched his chest and possibly his face and
arms.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives on the task force searching for the rapist declined to
comment for this story, but last Thursday, Beardslee, the head of the
task force, held a news conference urging people to scrutinize every
man they know for fresh scratches.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone has been in contact with him," LeBaron said. "If anybody
sees a person who has scratch marks, who has changed his normal
routine, they should consider that suspicious and notify the police."</TE>
<TE>   Attacking in Daylight</TE>
<TE>   The rapist operating in Torrance is a black man whose age has been
described as anywhere from early 20s to late 30s. He has attacked in
broad daylight, forcing his victims, with a gun, into a
silver-colored car. He has yet to strike any of his victims.</TE>
<TE>   "All the assaults have occurred within the vehicle," said Sean
Tanabe, the lead detective on the case.</TE>
<TE>   Torrance police are still awaiting final results of the rape
examinations done on the victims.</TE>
<TE>   "We're hoping to find some DNA. But nothing has been completed,"
Tanabe said. "And without a vehicle license plate, that makes it
harder to solve cases like this.</TE>
<TE>   "But they can be solved. It takes a lot of help from the
public--and they've been doing a tremendous job. We've received 600,
700 calls from people who think they saw the car or the guy."</TE>
<TE>   People with information about the Torrance rapist can call police
at (310) 328-3456 or (310) 618-5586. To report information regarding
the Long Beach rapist, the hotline number is (866) 600-1110.</TE>

<LD>This small city outside Bakersfield will adopt "In God We Trust" as
its motto. City Councilman Julio Perez, a pastor, asked his
colleagues to adopt the motto "as a reminder to cool down and think
about the best for our community."</LD>
<LD>   The city has been in turmoil amid allegations that its leaders
embezzled funds.</LD>
<LD>   Former Arvin Police Chief Rande Eighmy was sentenced to three
years' probation this month for allegedly stealing $6,000 and using
some of the money to buy a truck for his son.</LD>
<TE>   A councilman was indicted in January for allegedly misusing tax
money.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Mayor Juan Olivares faced a recall election last week, but

<LD>Alternative energy producers may get less money for their power,
after a state appeals court Wednesday voided the California Public
Utilities Commission's method for determining rates for renewable
energy purchases.</LD>
<LD>   The court acted after Southern California Edison protested that
the state was forcing it to spend too much for geothermal, wind and
solar power. Edison buys a third of its power from alternative energy
producers at a cost of more than $2 billion a year.</LD>

cards that some believe can predict the future.</LD>
<LD>   But first, she decided to check city regulations and discovered a

<HD>Thousands Apply for Bag-Screening Jobs at Airports</HD>
<DH>Aviation: Employment fairs draw applicants for new federal
agency, which will need to fill more than 30,000 security positions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANTHONY McCARTNEY and MARJORIE HERNANDEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thousands of people attended two job fairs in the Southland on
Wednesday aimed at hiring the first wave of baggage screeners that
the new Transportation Safety Administration will need in airports by
Nov. 18.</LD>
<LD>   An estimated 2,400 people applied at the Hilton Hotel in Glendale
and about 500 showed up at the Sutton Place Hotel in Newport Beach.
Another 500 applicants are expected today when the fair continues in
Newport Beach.</LD>
<LD>   The job fairs were part of a series that will help fill thousands
of positions at local airports. About 30,000 screeners are needed to
meet the government's requirement for having all passenger
checkpoints monitored by federal screeners. At least 2,000 will be
needed at Los Angeles International Airport alone.</LD>
<TE>   The new system takes control from local contractors, who have been
accused of entrusting plane and passenger safety to poorly trained,
poorly paid screeners.</TE>
<TE>   Some applicants Wednesday said they were drawn by the prospect of
job security.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel that confidence in the private sector is kind of low right
now as far as job security is concerned," said Leonard Lauvao, 34, of
Santa Ana, who left his job a year ago to care for his ailing mother.
Also, he said, "Since Sept. 11, I feel that it's important to be a
part of homeland security. I just hope I get hired."</TE>
<TE>   Bill Schiffbauer said he submitted his application partly out of
curiosity, but mainly because he was tired of climbing poles to
install cable television lines.</TE>
<TE>   Schiffbauer, wearing a hat embroidered with "America, Love It or
Leave It," said current screening procedures are a "joke."</TE>
<TE>   "This is different," he said. "Traveling through the airports can
be improved."</TE>
<TE>   Applicants must be U.S. citizens; have a high school diploma or a
GED certificate; pass drug, physical, vision and hearing tests; and
have reading and math skills comparable to a high school freshman.
They may apply online at www.tsa.dot.gov.</TE>
<TE>   Local unions representing current airport screeners have decried
the process, saying that experienced screeners should be given jobs
in the new agency.</TE>
<TE>   Linda Sturges, a retired kindergarten teacher from Canoga Park,
was enthusiastic about the job prospects until she heard that the
assessment process, including the physical screening, could last up

<HD>DNA Leads to Arrest in Rape Cases</HD>
<DH>Thousand Oaks: Repeat offender Narcisso Solis is charged in
connection with three assaults and is suspected in two others,
investigators say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Using DNA evidence, sheriff's investigators have arrested a Thousand
Oaks tile setter they suspect is a serial rapist responsible for at
least three sexual assaults in the city during the past four years.</LD>
<LD>   Narcisso Solis, 40, was arrested in Ventura County Jail on Tuesday
just as he was about to be released after spending the weekend behind
bars on suspicion of drunk driving.</LD>
<LD>   Solis was arrested Aug. 15 on suspicion of driving under the
influence just hours after he was placed under surveillance as a
prime suspect in the sexual assaults, which began in August 1998 and
include the July 16 rape this year of a 27-year-old woman in her
Hillcrest Drive apartment.</LD>
<TE>   He was booked Tuesday on 30 felony counts of sexual assault,
burglary, false imprisonment and assault with a deadly weapon. If
convicted he faces life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Solis appeared in court briefly Wednesday, but his arraignment was
postponed until Aug. 28 at the request of defense attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities suspect the Texas native--who has a criminal record
dating back more than a decade--is also responsible for at least two
other unsolved Thousand Oaks rape cases. They have notified other law
enforcement agencies in Ventura and Los Angeles counties about Solis'
arrest and his possible link to additional cases.</TE>
<TE>   "This case is not closed and we are continuing to investigate
other rapes," Ventura County Sheriff Bob Brooks said during a news
conference Wednesday announcing Solis' arrest. "We want the public to
be alerted that there may be other victims. We wish we could have
spared them the trauma of Mr. Solis."</TE>
<TE>   Solis was arrested earlier in connection with a 1990 Thousand Oaks
sexual assault but was released because of a lack of evidence. He is
also suspected in a 1993 Thousand Oaks case. The sheriff's crime lab
is studying DNA samples from both incidents, Brooks said.</TE>
<TE>   The Solis arrest was the culmination of a monthlong investigation
that had detectives contacting FBI and state parole agents for clues
and retracing their paths in the investigation of Simi Valley serial
rapist Vincent Sanchez, who is charged with first-degree murder in
the July 2001 shooting death of Megan Barroso, a Moorpark College
student.</TE>
<TE>   Brooks said there were numerous similarities between the criminal
habits of the men, most notably that the sexual assaults that Sanchez
has admitted to and that Solis is suspected of became progressively
more violent. Also, asin the Sanchez case, investigators conducting
search warrants this week at an apartment and house where Solis
recently lived discovered items linking Solis to the three rapes.</TE>
<TE>   Both Sanchez, a 31-year-old unemployed handyman, and Solis had
bounced from job to job in the months before their arrests, giving
both men large amounts of time that was unaccounted for.</TE>
<TE>   With these similarities as a guide, sheriff's investigators grew
concerned that the next rape victim would suffer the same fate as
Barroso.</TE>
<TE>   "We treated this like it was the Sanchez case," Brooks said of
investigators who traded information with their Simi Valley
counterparts. "We pulled out all the stops because we wanted to get
all over this case quickly."</TE>
<TE>   As Solis was being processed for release from jail Tuesday,
detectives were anxiously awaiting DNA test results from the county
sheriff's crime lab. After an order by Brooks to put all other cases
aside until the Solis analysis was complete, the DNA match was
returned. Detectives and prosecutors then agreed that the evidence
against the ex-convict was enough to keep him locked up.</TE>
<TE>   "Hard work often translates into good luck," Undersheriff Craig
Husband said. "We were racing the clock. And we had to make a
decision. We did not want him back on the street and put the
community at risk."</TE>
<TE>   Detectives learned on July 31 that DNA recovered from assaults in
January 2002 and August 1998 matched each other, but they did not
link Solis to those samples until Tuesday when his test results came
back.</TE>
<TE>   Results are expected today from DNA tests on samples recovered in
the July 16 assault, and officials expect they too will match Solis.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators first considered Solis as a suspect in the three
assaults after they received a tip from a state parole officer in
Oxnard who supervised Solis after his release from state prison on a
drug conviction in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Solis completed his parole requirements in May, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Brooks said investigators chose not to inform the public of the
DNA match in the two earlier rapes until the link to Solis was
established. Until the DNA match, Brooks said, investigators did not
have a good enough description of the suspect to warrant public
notification.</TE>
<TE>   Credit for the arrest of Solis should go to "the victims who had
the courage to come forward and cooperate with us," said Capt. Frank
O'Hanlon, who heads the sheriff's East County Major Crimes Unit.</TE>
<TE>   O'Hanlon, who directed the task force seeking a connection between
the July 16 rape and the earlier assaults, said the information
gleaned from interviews with the victims allowed investigators to
build an accurate profile of the suspect. That information was given
to the parole agent, Kevin Kelly, who recommended they check out
Solis.</TE>
<TE>   "The victims gave us descriptions for drawings so we could put
together a profile," O'Hanlon said. "If they had not come forward, we
would not be where we are today."</TE>

<HD>Strikes Planned at UC Berkeley by Clerical Workers,
Lecturers</HD>
<DH>Labor: Stalled contract talks are blamed. Next week's
walkouts, which officials call illegal, would occur on the first day
of the fall semester.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART SILVERSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>UC Berkeley is girding for labor walkouts beginning Monday, the first
day of the fall semester, but university officials say that classes
will begin as scheduled.</LD>
<LD>   The biggest job action is planned for Monday through Wednesday by
the Coalition of University Employees, which represents 2,300
clerical workers at UC Berkeley and at the nearby UC administrative
office in Oakland.</LD>
<LD>   The union is calling the walkout to protest a breakdown in
negotiations on a new labor contract.</LD>
<TE>   Another union also is protesting its bogged-down negotiations with
the UC system.</TE>
<TE>   The UC Council of the American Federation of Teachers, which
represents more than 450 nontenured lecturers at UC Berkeley, plans a
one-day walkout for Wednesday and will urge students to join in the
strike.</TE>
<TE>   The clerical union is seeking a 15% pay raise over two years, and
the lecturers union is seeking greater job security.</TE>
<TE>   The UC system said it doesn't have the money to cover pay
increases, and it accused the unions of preparing to strike
illegally, because they had not exhausted the state bargaining
process.</TE>
<TE>   The California Nurses Assn. said it plans to hold a "sympathy
strike" in support of the clerical workers and lecturers unions.</TE>
<TE>   Its 50 to 60 campus health center employees plan a three-day
walkout beginning Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, UC officials said they expect minimal disruption on
the 32,500-student campus.</TE>
<TE>   "We really expect pretty close to normal operations on campus,"
said Marie Felde, a UC Berkeley spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   She dismissed the possibility that the clerical workers' walkout
would lead to problems for students seeking to switch courses.</TE>
<TE>   She said the university's online registration system can handle
the changes.</TE>
<TE>   Felde said that other faculty are considering covering classes
taught by the nontenured lecturers.</TE>
<TE>   She added that enough medical personnel will be available to
handle urgent care and drop-in visits at the health center.</TE>
<TE>   The snarled contract negotiations with both the clerical and
lecturers unions involve employees throughout the nine-campus
University of California system.</TE>
<TE>   But UC Berkeley was chosen for the walkouts because it is the
first to start fall classes. The other UC campuses, including UCLA,
begin classes in mid-to late September.</TE>

<HD>Built in 1930s, Bottling Plant Still Shipshape</HD>
<DH>While many downtown landmarks languish, the ocean
liner-inspired factory continues to make soda.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER Y. HONG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The stretch of Central Avenue that crosses Pico and Olympic
boulevards is a hotbed of the city's thriving low-tech economy.</LD>
<LD>   On side streets, small garment factories operate in boxy
single-story buildings with barred windows. Massive wholesale produce
and fish markets keep Central Avenue packed with rumbling container
trucks.</LD>
<LD>   In the middle of this gritty industrial scene is the ocean
liner-inspired Coca-Cola bottling plant, an elegant blend of art and
commerce that has graced the avenue since the 1930s. While many
landmark buildings downtown languish vacant or with low-rent
manufacturing tenants, the Coca-Cola plant still produces soda for
Los Angeles consumers, as it has since the days when bottled
carbonated soft drinks and shipboard travel were symbols of technical
innovation.</LD>
<TE>   The Coca-Cola building is recognized by architects as a grand
example of Streamline Moderne, a design style invoking speed and
motion with long, flowing lines. The style flourished in 1930s
Southern California. As historians David Gebhard and Harriette Von
Breton noted in their book, "Los Angeles in the Thirties":
"Streamlining and the Moderne were perfect expressions of an
automobile-oriented society. In an affirmation of faith in the
future, the aesthetics of speed, freedom and mobility were applied to
buildings, ocean liners, aircraft, refrigerators, radios--anything."</TE>
<TE>   Coca-Cola had been at the Central Avenue location for just over 20
years when the steamship structure was built in 1936 and 1937. The
company moved to Los Angeles in 1902, opening a two-man bottling
operation at Third and Los Angeles streets, then moving several times
before landing on Central Avenue in 1915.</TE>
<TE>   The neighborhood was a busy industrial zone, as well as a
residential neighborhood of new arrivals from across the country.
Ralph J. Bunche, the late diplomat and Nobel Peace Prize winner, grew
up nearby. Long before he became mayor of Los Angeles, Tom Bradley
visited the plant as a boy, exchanging empty bottles for toys or
money.</TE>
<TE>   The plant grew to a complex of four buildings, including
warehouses, production lines and offices. By 1936, Stanley Barbee,
president of the Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Southern California,
decided to consolidate the four buildings into one.</TE>
<TE>   Barbee hired architect Robert V. Derrah. A few years earlier,
Derrah designed another landmark, the Crossroads of the World
shopping center in Hollywood, which features a Streamline Moderne
ship-shaped building.</TE>
<TE>   Derrah and Barbee, an avid yachtsman, decided a ship motif would
project the attributes Coca-Cola sought to promote: modernity,
cleanliness and progress.</TE>
<TE>   Fronting Central Avenue, Derrah's ocean liner features two rows of
porthole windows, a ship's catwalk with metal railings and simulated
rivets fashioned from wood. The Coca-Cola sign atop the building was
built in the shape of a ship's bridge.</TE>
<TE>   The plant's interior also held to the nautical theme. The
mezzanine features mahogany decks and handrails. Ladders and brass
fittings add to the look, as do ship doors enclosing the offices.
Megaphone-like ventilators dot the upper floors--they were once used
as chutes for bottle caps, which were dropped to crowning machines
below.</TE>
<TE>   Human-sized terra cotta Coke bottles were later added to the
exterior doorways.</TE>
<TE>   The ship-themed parts of the building now house offices, with
bottling taking place in larger facilities in another part of the
lot.</TE>
<TE>   Lauded by architects since its completion, the building has been
the subject of at least two master's degree theses.</TE>
<TE>   The building was declared a city cultural monument in 1976. Robert
Winter, an architectural historian who served on the city's cultural
heritage advisory board at the time, said Coca-Cola officials
actually opposed the designation initially, until they were assured
it would not preclude them from adding to the facility.</TE>
<TE>   There are no public tours of the building. Tour buses nevertheless
stop outside so architecture buffs can snap photos. "It's too bad the
people of Long Beach felt they had to bring the Queen Mary from
England; it was already sailing down Central Avenue," joked Winter.</TE>
<TE>   Larger bottling facilities in Downey and San Diego now handle more
production than the Los Angeles plant. Today, the Central Avenue
facility produces soft drinks in two-liter and 20-ounce plastic
bottles.</TE>
<TE>   After 100 years of bottling in Los Angeles, 87 of them at Central
Avenue, company spokesman Robert W. Phillips said the company has no
plans to move production. The plant is running short of warehouse
space, Phillips said, but that problem could be solved in the future
if nearby or adjacent lots become available. "We're committed to
being in this location. We've been here so long, we're committed to
it and to remaining in the city," Phillips said.</TE>

<HD>Study Questions Teachers' Training</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than a quarter of core classes taught at California's public
middle and high schools are led by teachers with little academic
training in those subjects, according to a new study released
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The report by the Education Trust, a Washington, D.C., advocacy
group, found that 27% of math, English, science and social studies
classes in California's secondary schools are taught by people who
had neither a college major nor a minor in the fields they are
teaching.</LD>
<LD>   Nationwide, the number is 24%. California ranks 19th worst in the
country; Louisiana, with 40%, tops the chart. Minnesota had the best
record--7% of secondary classes are taught by teachers without a
major or a minor in the fields.</LD>
<TE>   "If you don't know the subject, it is really hard to teach the
subject," said Kati Haycock, Education Trust's director. "The numbers
are scary, worrisome to say the least."</TE>
<TE>   The report was released at a time when California is in a quarrel
with the federal government over what constitutes a "highly
qualified" teacher.</TE>
<TE>   At stake are millions of dollars in federal aid, contingent on
states' meeting standards set by the "No Child Left Behind Act,"
passed last year by Congress and a key component of President Bush's
education agenda.</TE>
<TE>   The new federal law defines a "highly qualified" middle or high
school teacher as having a college degree in the subject being
taught, among other qualifications.</TE>
<TE>   California education officials contended that the Education Trust
report presents a misleading picture of teacher qualifications. They
argue that some teachers without such college degrees in those
subjects have gained expertise through credentialing and other
training. Teachers are required to take additional college courses in
the subjects they teach to receive their credentials.</TE>
<TE>   "It is better to have someone at least trying to teach science
than to have absolutely no science," said Kerry Mazzoni, California's
education secretary. "We have some misassignments, but we are
addressing the problem."</TE>
<TE>   The Education Trust report is based on a recently released survey
by the U.S. Department of Education of about 56,000 public school
teachers nationwide in the 1999-2000 school year. The trust examined
responses from 16,000 secondary school teachers.</TE>
<TE>   The group also found the problem is more pronounced in schools
with high percentages of minorities and poor students in the country
as a whole, but not in California.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, compared to low poverty schools, classes in high
poverty schools were 77% more likely to be assigned to out-of-field
teachers. Classes in nonwhite majority schools were 40% more likely
to have such teachers compared to mostly white schools.</TE>
<TE>   There were no significant race or income gaps among California
schools, the study found. Mazzoni said that shows that the state is
on the right track.</TE>
<TE>   She also pointed to the steady rise of test scores around the
state as evidence of teachers' abilities.</TE>

<HD>Kidnap Victim Returns Home</HD>
<DH>Crime: The man accused of abducting her waives extradition
from Nevada.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DIRMANN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RIVERSIDE</DL>
<LD>The 68-year-old man accused of snatching 10-year-old Nichole Taylor
Timmons from her bedroom Monday night waived extradition from Nevada
on Wednesday and is expected to return here by week's end to face a
battery of state charges.</LD>
<LD>   Riverside Deputy Dist. Atty. Mike Soccio said suspect Glenn
MacArthur Park was "answering questions well and cooperating with the
investigation" being conducted by authorities in Reno.</LD>
<LD>   Soccio said he expects to charge Park with first-degree burglary,
kidnapping and making terrorist threats based on comments the suspect
allegedly made during the ordeal.</LD>
<TE>   The child was reunited with her mother, Sharon Timmons, in Reno
late Tuesday, just hours after authorities on the Walker River Indian
reservation near Hawthorne, Nev., spotted Park's blue and white 1982
Dodge pickup. Park, who had done gardening for the family and had
been a part-time baby-sitter of Nichole, was apprehended and the
child was found unharmed.</TE>
<TE>   Mother and daughter returned home to Riverside County with
authorities Wednesday evening, where Sharon Timmons thanked
authorities at a news conference at the Ontario International
Airport. Nichole stood silently by, clutching a pair of stuffed
animals.</TE>
<TE>   Timmons said she "did a little happy dance inside" when she
learned that Nichole was safe. She also praised the state's Amber
Alert system, which quickly passed information on the abduction to
authorities throughout the West: "It changed my life, I got my
Nichole back."</TE>
<TE>   Timmons had discovered Nichole missing Tuesday about 7 a.m., when
she pulled back her daughter's bedcovers and found an empty bed. A
back door leading into the girl's bedroom was open and a chain
twisted around a backyard gate had been cut, Riverside Police Chief
Russ Leach said.</TE>
<TE>   By 11 a.m., authorities had concluded that Timmons had been
kidnapped and they issued the Amber Alert.</TE>
<TE>   Police suspicions focused on Park, who didn't turn up that morning
for various gardening jobs. Radio and television alerts regularly
beeped out a description of the girl, and of Park's truck and its
license number.</TE>
<TE>   Walker River Indian Reservation Policeman Ray East, who heard the
alert in Nevada, spotted Park's truck about 3 p.m. and arrested him.
Nichole Timmons, found in the cab of the truck, told authorities she
simply wanted to go home. The girl, still in her Powerpuff Girls
pajamas, appeared unharmed, police said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was heartening to see Nichole step off the plane a little
while ago along with her mom, back where she belongs," said Chief
Leach, who also thanked the FBI and the police agencies that assisted
in the arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Talbott, an assistant chief of the California Highway Patrol,
which coordinates the Amber Alert system, called Nichole's recovery
"a textbook case" of how things should work.</TE>
<TE>   Police said that Sharon Timmons, a single mother, had apparently
grown uncomfortable with Park and terminated all contact with him
several weeks ago. Leach speculated that Park was distraught over the
termination.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors said Park seemed unusually close to the girl. He was
often seen walking the neighborhood or driving his pickup with
Nichole pulled close to him, his arm draped around her shoulders. Her
classmates said Park, who some thought was Nichole's father, often
brought treats to her school for class parties.</TE>

<HD>Paul Tuttle, 84; Designer's Furniture Exhibited as Art</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEANNINE STEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Paul Tuttle, an internationally recognized designer best known for
his modern, elegant furniture, died in his Santa Barbara home on Aug.
2 after a long illness. He was 84.</LD>
<LD>   Tuttle's body of work included custom and manufactured furniture,
as well as architectural and interior projects in Santa Barbara, his
home since 1956.</LD>
<LD>   One of his signature pieces was the 1964 "Z" chair, which combined
wood and metal in a streamlined Z form, and illustrated his affinity
for combining materials such as wood, metal and glass into sleek,
sculpted designs.</LD>
<TE>   His custom work resulted in about 200 furniture pieces. Tuttle was
the subject of a 1978 exhibition titled "Paul Tuttle, Designer" at
the Santa Barbara Museum of Art, and was featured in a retrospective,
"Paul Tuttle Designs," at the University Art Museum at UC Santa
Barbara in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "I think his work is unique because it doesn't show a lot of
jumping all over the place in terms of changing styles or being
trendy," said Marla C. Berns, former director of the University Art
Museum, who curated the show. His consistency was exemplified in how
"the early pieces related to the later pieces," Berns said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to producing furniture, Berns said, Tuttle focused on
"certain design problems that he worked on over and over again,
taking them to what he called the essence of his design. He worked on
a three-legged chair over a number of years, exposing more or less of
the steel supports, working on details of how the steel penetrated
the wood, until he came up with the final chair years later. When he
came up with something that people liked, he'd still continue to play
with it, to get it to what he thought was the perfect resolution that
resulted from his own internal motivations."</TE>
<TE>   Those motivations, said Berns, who is now director of the UCLA
Fowler Museum of Cultural History and is working on the designer's
monograph, weren't propelled by self-doubt, but "by the fact that he
always thought he could do more. He kept pushing until he reached a
certain level of perfection. It was his own rigorous standards. His
big goal was not to see something go into mass production and make
him a whole lot of money, but he struggled as a lot of artists
struggle, to keep working until he made something that was pleasing
to him."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps no one was more familiar with Tuttle's perfectionist
streak than Bud Tullis, the Solvang-based master craftsman woodworker
with whom Tuttle had collaborated on custom pieces since 1982.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes we'd move a leg of a chair a quarter of an inch, or an
arm a half an inch, and I'd pull my hair out," said Tullis with a
laugh. "But I learned from him that you never stop looking at design.
The more I worked with him on the custom pieces the more excited he
got because he was in total control. With his design work with
manufacturers there were always compromises, and they don't like to
... experiment, and that's what we did."</TE>
<TE>   Tuttle was born in Springfield, Mo., and lived in St. Louis until
World War II. As an Air Force cartographer, he was stationed in
India, where the architecture and landscape influenced his pursuit of
a design career.</TE>
<TE>   He studied briefly at the Art Center School in Los Angeles (now
Art Center College of Design in Pasadena) and apprenticed with
architects Welton Becket and Thornton Ladd. In 1949 he participated
in Frank Lloyd Wright's Taliesen West Fellowship in Scottsdale, Ariz.</TE>
<TE>   His work soon gained recognition. In 1951 Tuttle's first wood
table, which he made by hand, was part of the Good Design exhibition
at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and an exhibition of his
work was held at the Pasadena Art Museum in 1966.</TE>
<TE>   In 1958 Tuttle began building a design career in Switzerland,
where he spent part of the year, and he became a corporate design
consultant for a Basel-based pharmaceutical company.</TE>
<TE>   From 1968 to 1983, he was a contract designer for Straessle
International, a furniture manufacturer in Kirchberg, which
encouraged him to experiment with new materials and technologies.</TE>
<TE>   Although the designer, whom Tullis described as impish,
experienced lean times, "He was never influenced by the dollar. He
lived how he liked to live, but if anything, he sold his things way
too cheaply. He was the artist's artist and the designer's designer,
but he never considered himself an artist or a sculptor."</TE>
<TE>   The two were working on a chair until Tuttle's death. Tullis said
he brought it to Tuttle a week before the designer died: "We talked
about it, and he was very excited, he loved it. Whenever he came to
see a new piece, if he giggled I knew it was OK.</TE>
<TE>   "If not, we'd have to make changes," Tuttle said. "On a few pieces
he'd say, 'We're quitting on this,' or he'd tear up the drawing and
we'd do something else. Nothing big. A lot of us have to learn that."</TE>
<TE>   Tuttle's archives, including some drawings, manuscripts and
selected pieces of furniture, will be kept at the Architecture and
Design Collection of UC Santa Barbara's University Art Museum.</TE>
<TE>   Tuttle is survived by two sisters, Lois Hoegerman of Sierra City,
Calif., and Harriet Weber of Lake St. Louis, Mo. A memorial will be
held Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Contributions in Tuttle's memory can be made to Visiting Nurse and
Hospice Care, Santa Barbara, or to Friends of Paul Tuttle Fund,
University Art Museum, UC Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara CA 93106.</TE>

<HD>Bush to Visit O.C. to Help Simon, Meet Merchants</HD>
<DH>Politics: President will arrive Friday to talk to Latino
entrepreneurs, attend GOP fund-raiser.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>--From Times staff reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush will visit Orange County on Friday, including a stop
in Dana Point to help raise funds for Republican gubernatorial
candidate Bill Simon Jr.</LD>
<LD>   Bush will visit the Bowers Museum of Cultural Art in Santa Ana at
3 p.m. A hand-picked group of Latino small-business owners have been
invited to join the president in a round-table discussion at the
museum.</LD>
<LD>   Afterward he will attend a $1,000-a-plate fund-raiser for Simon at

<LD>The city's Housing Authority is accepting applications from
low-income residents interested in receiving Section 8 financial
assistance with their rent.</LD>
<LD>   The federal program provides landlords about 70% of the rent, up
to $1,592 for a four-bedroom unit, for tenants who are selected. The
city oversees more than 1,600 renters under the program.</LD>
<LD>   Oxnard also owns and operates 780 public housing units--in two
high-rise apartments for senior citizens and six other buildings,
mostly in La Colonia--that provide a similar subsidy. Public housing
tenants pay 30% of their eligible gross income for rent.</LD>
<TE>   To qualify for both programs, the head of household must be at
least 18 or legally emancipated and prepared to provide information
about the family's total gross income and Social Security numbers of
all family members.</TE>
<TE>   Applications will be accepted starting Sept. 3 and on the first
Tuesday of the month thereafter at the Housing Authority office, 1470
Colonia Road, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Veterans, anyone permanently
disabled on Supplementary Security Income, and seniors 62 and older
may apply any time.</TE>

<HD>District Hopefuls Weigh In on Westin</HD>
<DH>Education: Most candidates for open college board seats say
trustees should decide the chancellor's fate as soon as possible.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMANDA COVARRUBIAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Denouncing Chancellor Philip Westin's resignation demands as
"preposterous," several candidates for trustee of the Ventura County
Community College District said Wednesday the board should act
quickly to decide the fate of the embattled administrator.</LD>
<LD>   "I think his expenses are enough to justify termination," said
Deshay Ford, one of 13 candidates running for three seats on the
college board in the Nov. 5 election. "It's an abuse of public
funds."</LD>
<LD>   Westin, 57, is the subject of an ongoing investigation for
charging the district more than $119,000 in expenses between 1998 and
2001. He has been placed on administrative leave and is named in a
lawsuit brought against the district on behalf of county taxpayers
that is aimed at nullifying his contract.</LD>
<TE>   "There needs to be a quick resolution on this," said Mary Anne
Rooney, one of three challengers vying to unseat trustee John
Tallman. "The taxpayers are demanding an answer. They're coming
through with lawsuits, they're upset about it and rightly so."</TE>
<TE>   Candidate Dan Peate agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "The audit needs to be wrapped up as soon as possible," said
Peate, one of five candidates seeking to replace board President
Norman Nagel, who has bowed out of the race. "There has to be full
public disclosure and appropriate action taken once the facts are
laid out."</TE>
<TE>   Westin, who says he has done nothing wrong, continues to collect
his $203,000-a-year salary amid investigation. Two reviews of his
expenditures found that he did not violate any laws or policies.</TE>
<TE>   To try to force the board to act, Westin sent a letter last week
to the five trustees and acting Chancellor Jim Walker, outlining his
resignation demands: that he retain the title of chancellor for 18
months; receive 18 months' severance pay, or $305,000; and be allowed
to look for a new job during that period. He also asked that the
board state publicly that he has done a superlative job.</TE>
<TE>   Westin's demands are "absolutely preposterous," said Ford, seeking
the seat held by trustee Art Hernandez. "Under no circumstances
should they give in to his demands. The board should continue its
investigation and begin the process of termination."</TE>
<TE>   Sylvia Munoz Schnopp, also seeking Hernandez's seat, said Westin's
demands show "he is not living in reality."</TE>
<TE>   "I think first and foremost they should get rid of him," she said.
"He's done enough damage to the credibility of the district and the
position of chancellor."</TE>
<TE>   Critics have blasted the trustees for renewing Westin's contract
and giving him a $30,000-a-year raise in May, two months after
learning about his expenses. At the time, they said Westin had done
an excellent job and promised to monitor his spending more carefully.</TE>
<TE>   But the public and the teachers union were not mollified. As their
outrage grew, trustees placed Westin on administrative leave and
launched the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "I have not talked to one person who thinks he should remain as
chancellor," said Cheryl Heitmann, a candidate for Nagel's seat. "He
has eroded the public trust in such a way that there's no way he
could go on."</TE>
<TE>   She said Westin's demands reflect an attitude he has displayed
throughout his tenure as community college chief.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no contrition, no sense of taking any responsibility for
his behavior," Heitmann said. "He makes himself off to be a victim.
He has held this board in such a grip that he is continuing to
operate that way."</TE>
<TE>   Ron Segovia Dyste, a Hernandez challenger, said he believes
Westin's demands are merely an opening bid to negotiate the best
buyout of his lucrative contract.</TE>
<TE>   "They're showing some prudence. They have to take their time and
be absolutely fair to Westin," said Dyste, a former executive vice
president of Ventura College. "He has pretty much eliminated any
public support that he had. In 31 years, I've never seen anything
like this in a community college system."</TE>

<HD>Mood Swing for Angels</HD>
<DH>Baseball: They learn Sele will be sidelined, but then
Spiezio's home run helps them beat Yankees in 11 innings, 5-1, and
stay in first place in AL West.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>This is the time of year something bad usually happens to the Angels,
if it hasn't already. Over the last decade, by curse or bad luck or
whatever, some sort of doom befalls an Angel team in contention in
August.</LD>
<LD>   In 1995, for instance, the Angels lost shortstop Gary DiSarcina to
injury as they coughed up an 11-game lead. In 1997, the Angels lost
pitcher Chuck Finley and catcher Todd Greene to injury, and a playoff
berth rapidly slipped away.</LD>
<LD>   This might be the year the Angels overcome bad karma. On the day
they received their annual dose of bad news at a bad time--pitcher
Aaron Sele has a partially torn rotator cuff--they shrugged and beat
the mighty New York Yankees. The Angel pitchers held off the Yankees
for more than four hours Wednesday, until Scott Spiezio hit a
game-winning home run in the 11th inning of a 5-1 victory that kept
the Angels atop the American League West for at least another day.</LD>
<TE>   "They've got plenty of wins," Spiezio said. "We needed it more
than them."</TE>
<TE>   Sele will not require surgery, and the Angels believe he can
return in two to three weeks. In the meantime, and in a pennant race,
they are likely to ask Mickey Callaway to make his first major league
start in three years Saturday against the Boston Red Sox.</TE>
<TE>   Logically, the Angels would be better off with an established
major league starter such as Jeff Weaver, but you never know with
this year's resilient bunch. The Angels beat up on Weaver, who
started the season as the Detroit Tigers' ace before the Yankees
decided they needed a surplus arm, traded for him and stashed him in
the bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   Weaver was roundly booed Wednesday after giving up four runs in
the 11th inning. After the Angels got six hits through the first 10
innings, they got five off Weaver in the 11th, including the two-run
homer from Spiezio that broke a 1-1 tie.</TE>
<TE>   Ramon Ortiz pitched his best game in a month, holding the Yankees
to one run over seven innings. Ortiz and relievers Brendan Donnelly,
Scott Schoeneweis, Ben Weber and Troy Percival shut out the Yankees
over the final 10 innings.</TE>
<TE>   At 75-50, the Angels matched last season's victory total, success
due in no small measure to the good health of the starting rotation.
Sele becomes the first Angel starter put onto the disabled list this
season.</TE>
<TE>   "We've known for two starts he needed this," Percival said. "If we
can get him healthy in two to three weeks, that makes us a better
team than we are with him pitching at 50%."</TE>
<TE>   Sele said he did not regret trying to pitch through some
discomfort. He complained about it after walking seven in Tuesday's
7-5 loss.</TE>
<TE>   Said Sele: "I wouldn't have taken the mound if I didn't feel I
could pitch.... I didn't have pain in the front shoulder like I did
after the game until [Tuesday], but I haven't felt 100% for a while.
That's part of pitching."</TE>
<TE>   Sele received a cortisone shot to reduce inflammation in the
shoulder, and he will begin a strengthening program. "We're confident
he'll have an opportunity to pitch again this season," Angel Manager
Mike Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   For immediate help, the Angels recalled left-hander Mark
Lukasiewicz from triple-A Salt Lake. They can adjust their roster
again before Sunday, when Sele's turn in the rotation comes up.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Callaway, who is 9-2 with a 1.68 earned-run average
at Salt Lake, the Angels can recall Lou Pote or try relievers
Schoeneweis, Al Levine or Scot Shields as starters. Scioscia also
said the Angels could skip the fifth starter's spot when off days
allow.</TE>
<TE>   No player acquired after Aug. 31 is eligible for postseason play,
but the Angels won't know by then whether Sele can return on
schedule, or at all. Nonetheless, General Manager Bill Stoneman said
he has not pursued a trade for a starter.</TE>
<TE>   Said Stoneman: "I would think the solution, right now, would come
from within."</TE>

<HD>Green Enjoys the Gift of Gap</HD>
<DH>Dodgers: Two-out double in the 10th inning drives in Beltre
and beats Marlins, 4-3, after L.A. rallies in ninth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The news on one scoreboard at Dodger Stadium late Wednesday night was
bad. Both the NL West-leading Arizona Diamondbacks and the San
Francisco Giants, battling for the wild-card spot, had already won.</LD>
<LD>   The news on the other scoreboard was frustrating.</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers and Florida Marlins were tied, 3-3, in the 10th
inning.</LD>
<TE>   But with two out, the frustration quickly turned to elation when
Shawn Green followed an Adrian Beltre walk by lining a 2-2 pitch from
reliever Braden Looper into right-center field for the game-winning
double. Beltre, tender hamstring and all, raced home with the winning
run in a 4-3 victory in front of a crowd of 31,281.</TE>
<TE>   "I held my breath all the way from first," Dodger Manager Jim
Tracy said of Beltre's burst, "but I said, 'Run like crazy.' "</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers had to rally for a ninth-inning run to prevent the
Marlins, who had come to Dodger Stadium with a 60-64 record, from
winning their second consecutive game in the three-game series.</TE>
<TE>   The key figure in the series for Florida has been outfielder Juan
Encarnacion, who had three hits and three RBIs Tuesday, and three
more hits and the RBI that gave the Marlins a 3-2 lead in the eighth
inning Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   But ultimately, Green had the deciding RBI, giving the victory to
reliever Paul Shuey (2-2) and handing the loss to Looper (0-5).</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't looking for the ball in any particular spot," said
Green, who has 94 RBIs. "I just went up there to take my shots. I
wouldn't say I am hot or cold right now with the bat. Sometimes you
just go out there with what you have."</TE>
<TE>   Said Dodger outfielder Dave Roberts, "I'll take Greenie any time
in that situation."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers had taken the early lead. With Brian Jordan sitting
out his fourth consecutive game because of back stiffness and Marquis
Grissom in center, Tracy gave Mike Kinkade his first start of the
season in left and his third start overall.</TE>
<TE>   Kinkade quickly took advantage of the opportunity, hitting the
third pitch he saw from Florida starter Michael Tejera into the seats
in left-center in the third inning to open the scoring.</TE>
<TE>   It was Kinkade's first home run as a Dodger and he celebrated by
doing away with the traditional trot and racing most of the way
around the bases.</TE>
<TE>   Kinkade's homer was followed by a Cesar Izturis single. When Omar
Daal laid down a sacrifice bunt, Tejera tried to get the lead runner
at second, but Izturis beat the throw. And even if he hadn't,
shortstop Mike Mordecai was unable to hold onto the ball.</TE>
<TE>   Up came Mark Grudzielanek, leading off for only the second time
this season. He smacked a single to left to give the Dodgers a 2-0
lead.</TE>
<TE>   It held up until the fifth, when Charles Johnson and Mordecai
knocked in runs.</TE>
<TE>   Daal, who had been 3-0 with a 1.89 earned-run average over his
previous five starts, settled down after that, holding the Marlins to
the two runs through seven innings despite giving up nine hits.</TE>
<TE>   But the Dodgers weren't having any greater success against Tejera,
who was making his first start in Dodger Stadium. He held them to two
runs through eight innings.</TE>
<TE>   To pitch to the Marlins in the eighth, Tracy brought in Paul
Quantrill, who has been almost as reliable as closer Eric Gagne. In
his previous seven innings over a span of nine appearances, Quantrill
had not given up an earned run while collecting a win and a save. A
key to his effectiveness was his ability to retire the first man he
faced. He had done so in 48 of his 68 appearances. But not Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Quantrill gave up a single to Kevin Millar, but that didn't seem
to matter when the next batter, Preston Wilson, grounded into a
double play.</TE>
<TE>   But Quantrill then walked Derrek Lee, bringing up Encarnacion.
After Lee had stolen second, Encarnacion hit a broken-bat single on a
3-2 fastball. The top half of the bat made it all the way to the
infield dirt. More importantly, the ball made it into left field, Lee
scoring.</TE>
<TE>   With reliever Vladimir Nunez on the mound in the ninth, Green
opened with a walk, went to second on Paul Lo Duca's sacrifice bunt
and to third on a passed ball.</TE>
<TE>   Up came Eric Karros, who had sat out the last game, was ejected in
the third inning of the game before that, was 0 for 3 Wednesday and
looked overmatched when he swung late on a 92-mph fastball from
Nunez.</TE>
<TE>   But all that was forgotten a moment later when Karros lined a ball
past second baseman Homer Bush to drive in Green.</TE>

<HD>Skating Is Not Alone in Lacking Credibility</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>We've been made fools of. Those of us who are proud to be fans of
gymnastics and figure skating and diving, the sports of judges and
politics as much as back flips and triple lutzes, must come to grips
with this truth.</LD>
<LD>   We are enablers.</LD>
<LD>   We accept that cheating happens, that the better tumbler, twirler,
jumper doesn't always win. We debate the horror of the 9.95 score
from the Ukraine judge off that perfect vault. We'll nod and say,
"Yes, of course, we believe that happened," when the story of the
Russian Mafia and the figure skating judges comes trickling out.</LD>
<TE>   And then, just as the baseball fans who file back after the
millionaire players strike or billionaire owners lock the players
out, we buy more tickets, we turn on the TV, we watch the next
contest even if we are sure the results will somehow be manipulated.</TE>
<TE>   Former Olympic coach Bela Karolyi sits in an Anaheim hotel suite
and says with conviction that judging in his sport is as shady and
manipulated as that of figure skating.</TE>
<TE>   "Is just as bad," he says, "and maybe worse."</TE>
<TE>   Karolyi gulps coffee and talks passionately--with his voice, his
mustache, his eyes and his hands--about gymnastics, the sport he
loves and still dominates. He tells stories of how Nadia Comaneci was
hoodwinked out of her rightful all-around gold medal at the 1980
Moscow Games. Of the North Korean gymnast at the 1991 World
Championships who had empty spaces in her gums because her baby teeth
had recently fallen out even though no competitor was supposed to be
younger than 15. "I ask the officials, 'Who is changing her diapers?'
" Karolyi says.</TE>
<TE>   What are we, the fans of these sports, doing when we stand up and
cheer perfection from Michelle Kwan or Mary Lou Retton if we don't
finally quit giving our support to the men and women who rule the
results?</TE>
<TE>   Are we being chumps?</TE>
<TE>   Karolyi rolls his eyes and throws up his hands as he explains how
the judges come to practice sessions and within minutes are passing
notes and whispering behind their hands. "It makes my stomach turn
over," Karolyi says. "Who knows what is plotting?"</TE>
<TE>   We must be idiots, those of us who are left in awe when Svetlana
Khorkina whirls around the uneven bars, flying to the roof and back
down. What is the point if the Italian judge has decided to support
the Ukrainian competitor on the uneven bars so the Italian vaulter
can get the Ukrainian support?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it's that bad," Bart Connor says.</TE>
<TE>   Connor, a former U.S. Olympian, is married to Comaneci. Yes,
Connor says, it is a problem that many judges are financed by their
national federations and feel as much a part of the national team as
the athlete. Trainer tapes the gymnasts' ankles. Check. Gymnast
performs the prescribed vault. Check. Russian judge gives Russian
gymnast top score. Check.</TE>
<TE>   "But gymnastics is trying," Connor says. Connor says there are
some experts who think gymnastics is trying too hard. The sport now
has a code of points. Every move and trick has an established scoring
value. Every bobble has an established deduction.</TE>
<TE>   "It is almost stifling the creativity," Connor says. "The gymnast
becomes afraid to try a new trick or invent a new move because you
don't know how it will be scored, so it's better to be safe. Now so
many of the routines look alike."</TE>
<TE>   A year from now the world gymnastics championships will come to
the Arrowhead Pond.</TE>
<TE>   Young women with tiny bodies and big hearts, who have given their
teen-aged years to training themselves to tumble without a stumble,
will captivate and awe their fans.</TE>
<TE>   Then judges will hold up score cards. There might be a 9.75
instead of a 9.85 or maybe a 9.95 when nearly everyone else saw a
perfect 10. There will be booing. There might very well be a coach
running to the table, pounding his fist, demanding a recount.</TE>
<TE>   "It could happen," Karolyi says. "It will happen. That cat is out
of the bag."</TE>
<TE>   The awarding of dual gold pairs figure skating medals in Salt Lake
City was not the sensible conclusion to a terrible conundrum but a
gutless inability to accept a result, right or wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "Now every coach can think of a reason to complain," Karolyi says,
seeming, in his mind, to already be plotting strategy. "And why not?"</TE>
<TE>   We sports fans want to trust. We want to trust the judges, the
coaches, the athletes. We want to trust the times, the scores, the
integrity of it all. We want to believe that what we see is true and
honest.</TE>
<TE>   And if, too often, it is not, then that is our fault too. For
going along.</TE>

<DH>Bruin defensive backs Manning and Ware have a tough time in
minor league baseball</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ricky Manning Jr. thought he knew cool. Matt Ware thought he knew
heat.</LD>
<LD>   Manning, a three-year UCLA starter and two-time all-Pacific 10
Conference cornerback, boasts the fattest wallet of any Bruin thanks
to a Minnesota Twin contract that pays him $70,000 every summer to
spend a month with a minor league team.</LD>
<LD>   Then in June he reported for his first season in Class A after
three in rookie league. Pitchers had greater command, teammates had
better swings and it was more than he could handle.</LD>
<TE>   Cool? He batted a frigid .180.</TE>
<TE>   Ware, a freshman All-American as a Bruin cornerback last season,
covered the best receivers in the Pac-10 one-on-one every week and
was rarely burned.</TE>
<TE>   Then in June he reported to the Arizona Rookie League for his
first season as a Seattle Mariner minor leaguer. It was 112 degrees.
Swinging a wood bat for the first time, Ware faced live, erratic arms
throwing 95 mph and eked out a .171 average.</TE>
<TE>   Heat? More like a meltdown.</TE>
<TE>   So it happened that perhaps the two best athletes on the UCLA team
discovered that baseball frustrates and humbles anyone who supposes
the game can be mastered by athleticism alone.</TE>
<TE>   Manning and Ware readily admit they did not prepare sufficiently
during the off-season, rarely taking batting practice or even playing
catch.</TE>
<TE>   "If I want to make the move, I can see that I have to put more
time in," Manning said. "The guys playing full-time, it's hard enough
for them. Seeing guys pass me up makes me jealous. I know why it's
happening, but it doesn't make it any easier. I haven't had the time
to play the game."</TE>
<TE>   Not that either player is idle. Baseball was secondary only
because of their prowess in the secondary. Football requires a
tremendous year-round commitment, on the field and in the weight
room, especially for players projected as NFL draft picks.</TE>
<TE>   But they did sign the baseball contracts. The Twins and Mariners
want a return on their investment, eventually anyway.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, this is a game of consistency and repetition,"
said Jim Rantz, the Twins' minor league director. "In order to
improve and climb through the system, you have to have playing time.
It's tough to evaluate a guy on [Manning's] 24 games and 61 at-bats."</TE>
<TE>   Scouts signed them because of their tremendous tools, because they
are proven competitors, because they hold the promise, however
remote, of becoming the next Deion Sanders or Brian Jordan, the
supremely rare two-sport pro athlete.</TE>
<TE>   Ware was drafted in the 21st round last year and signed by the
Mariners for $200,000 despite not having played since his sophomore
year at Loyola High. Manning, a 22nd-round pick in 1999, had better
credentials, setting CIF Central Section records for hits and stolen
bases at Fresno Edison High.</TE>
<TE>   Little did the players realize that upon cashing the checks, they
were consigned to repeated humiliation in small towns all over
America. Not to mention the rickety bus rides and greasy burgers.</TE>
<TE>   "Getting used to the day-to-day failure inherent in baseball is
difficult for anyone, and especially for someone who has known a lot
of success in another sport," said Benny Looper, the Mariners' player
development director.</TE>
<TE>   Neither the Twins nor Mariners express disappointment in their
Bruin ballplayers. Patience is a cornerstone of player development.</TE>
<TE>   Manning batted .275 in 2000 and .253 in 2001 in rookie ball,
although he had no extra-base hits either year. He has had only 256
at-bats in four seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "Signing Ricky was an opportunity to get a heck of an athlete in
the system," Rantz said. "At the time, we weren't sure if he was
going to stay with football. We'd do it over again."</TE>
<TE>   Ware drove in a run with a sharp single in one of his first
at-bats at Peoria, Ariz., legged out a double when he caught a right
fielder napping and showed home-run power in batting practice.</TE>
<TE>   Not exactly accomplishments on par with his team-high five
interceptions last fall, but it's a start.</TE>
<TE>   "Matt showed no signs of discouragement; he has an extremely
positive makeup," Looper said. "Yes, he was crude in every aspect.
But he showed the same thing that encouraged us to sign him in the
first place--great athleticism."</TE>
<TE>   Both players enjoyed the summer despite their struggles. As in
football, the outgoing Manning became a popular clubhouse leader.
Ware also made friends easily, bonding so well that Dominican
teammates who called him their brother cried when he left to report
to UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Ballplayers accustomed to playing in front of a few hundred fans
in sleepy towns wanted to know how it felt to take the football field
in packed, thunderous stadiums.</TE>
<TE>   "I told them it's fun," Ware said.</TE>
<TE>   During a bus ride, Manning's teammates at Quad Cities, Iowa,
played a video of his Bruin highlights despite the good-natured
protests of shortstop and USC product Seth Davidson.</TE>
<TE>   Peoria outfielder Mike Wilson second-guessed his own decision to
turn down a football scholarship to Oklahoma to focus on baseball
after listening to Ware describe UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Limiting himself to one sport, though, made for a smooth debut.
Wilson batted .264 with nine extra-base hits in 114 at-bats. Ware,
meanwhile, was six for 35 with 14 strikeouts and developed a sore arm
during the first week.</TE>
<TE>   "It is really hard to hit a ball," Ware said.</TE>
<TE>   Even on the toughest days he remained upbeat during long phone
calls to his parents and girlfriend. He didn't mention his arm
problems and didn't breathe a word about getting hit in the head with
a fastball from a 6-foot-6 Milwaukee Brewer prospect.</TE>
<TE>   Manning and Ware commiserated upon returning to UCLA, hinting at
their struggles without admitting much.</TE>
<TE>   "We both told our little stories," Ware said. "Ricky said
everything he hit was right at somebody."</TE>
<TE>   Most of their UCLA teammates see only the nice cars and new
clothes Manning and Ware can afford. But when freshman Jarrad Page
was leaning toward signing with the Brewers and becoming the third
Bruin defensive back to juggle both sports, a call from Manning
changed his mind.</TE>
<TE>   "Friends and people at home were telling me to sign, some of them
even wanted me to give up football," Page said. "Ricky said you're in
the middle of nowhere, riding on like a school bus, the heat's
unbearable and you're eating fast food. He said it's nothing like
college football, playing in front of 90,000 people and living on a
college campus."</TE>
<TE>   Although the specter of spending at least two more years in rookie
league is daunting to Ware, he promises to return.</TE>
<TE>   "Baseball is real difficult and I have a lot to learn," he said.
"Yes, I'll be back. And I will definitely be hitting after football
is over. I know what I have to do to be successful. I want to move up
to [Class A]."</TE>
<TE>   Manning, a senior, is under contract for one more season, but he
might forfeit his last payday and retire if he is a high NFL pick.
Yet the desire to master the game that has posed such a challenge
continues to tug at him.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had to say which is more rewarding, making a big hit in
football or getting a big hit in baseball, I'd say baseball because
it doesn't happen as often," he said. "It's so difficult that when I
really drive a ball, nothing in the world feels better than that."</TE>

<HD>Philippine Guerrillas Behead 2 Hostages</HD>
<DH>Violence: The victims are among six abducted this week by
Muslim Abu Sayyaf rebels.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PATIKUL, Philippines</DL>
<LD>Muslim Abu Sayyaf rebels beheaded at least two of the six people they
kidnapped this week in the southern Philippines, authorities said
today. The heads of the two male hostages were found in an open-air
market in Jolo town along with notes calling for a holy war, said
Brig. Gen. Romeo Tolentino, commander of the army on the island of
Jolo.</LD>
<LD>   The men were abducted Tuesday with four women as the group visited
homes around the town of Patikul. The group was reportedly selling
Avon cosmetics, but officials also said the six were Jehovah's
Witnesses.</LD>
<LD>   Officials initially reported that eight people were abducted, but
two missing people--both Muslims--returned home Wednesday, saying
they had spent the night with relatives. Police were investigating.</LD>
<TE>   The abductions demonstrated that the Abu Sayyaf rebels remain
dangerous despite a U.S.-backed military offensive aimed at wiping
out the group. They came as a blow to the Philippine government,
which had said just weeks ago that it was shifting some resources
away from the war on Abu Sayyaf because the group had been decimated
and was on the run.</TE>
<TE>   Officials would not speculate as to why the hostages were
targeted.</TE>
<TE>   A police report said the six captives were Jehovah's Witnesses,
but said officers found no evidence they were trying to promote their
religion in the predominantly Muslim area. The notes found with the
remains, however, referred to "infidels," police said.</TE>

<TE>   Police blamed the National Liberation Army, or ELN, Colombia's

<LD>   The Afghan government said the reported deaths of hundreds of
Taliban prisoners following their surrender last year appeared to be
an "atrocity" and pledged to cooperate in an investigation. But
officials stopped short of pledging to organize an inquiry
themselves.</LD>
<TE>   The United Nations said Tuesday that it had investigated a mass
grave at Dasht-i-Leili but suspended the probe as Afghanistan could
not protect witnesses. Newsweek magazine said more than 1,000
prisoners may have died in shipping containers.</TE>
<TE>   Although the state vowed to cooperate with any human rights
investigation, Defense Minister Mohammed Qassim Fahim said he doubted
that mass graves exist.</TE>

<TE>   Gil Bernardi, mayor of Le Lavandou on the Mediterranean 15 miles

his plans to build a cemetery in a tranquil setting by the sea.</TE>
<TE>   Bernardi said most locals had obeyed the edict so far, but he was
desperately trying to find a resting place for a homeless man who had
recently passed away in the town.</TE>

an anonymous donor had stepped in and paid.</LD>
<TE>   The 16 had declined to pay, saying it would mean "we admit we did

<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>Officials declared a flood emergency Wednesday in southern China's
Hunan province, where a lake about the size of Rhode Island is
threatening to burst its banks and engulf millions of people.</LD>
<LD>   Heavy rains continued to drench parts of Asia, bringing the death
toll since July to nearly 2,000, including at least 60 people who
were killed Wednesday when a landslide swept away a village in Nepal.
In India, at least 10 people were washed away after a dam burst.</LD>
<LD>   In China, rivers swollen by a tropical storm poured into Dongting
Lake. More than 7,000 soldiers had been mobilized to reinforce
embankments around the lake that shield more than 10 million people
and 1.6 million acres of farmland, state radio said.</LD>
<TE>   Dongting--China's second-largest freshwater lake, covering about
1,400 square miles--is more than 6 feet over the flood-warning mark,
its highest level in almost three years.</TE>
<TE>   But it is still short of its record, reached in 1998 when the
worst floods in decades killed more than 4,000 people in China, state
television said.</TE>

<HD>Canada's Chretien Won't Seek Fourth Term</HD>
<DH>Politics: The prime minister will step down early to end a
power struggle between loyalists and supporters of his party rival.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAGGIE FARLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Bowing to calls from within his own party to move aside, Canadian
Prime Minister Jean Chretien announced Wednesday that he won't seek a
fourth term in office and will step down in February 2004.</LD>
<LD>   Chretien, 68, made his announcement at an abruptly assembled news
conference to quell a near revolt within the Liberal Party. A
simmering power struggle between Chretien loyalists and supporters of
his party rival, Paul Martin, has distracted from governing, Chretien
said, so when pushed, he made a decision.</LD>
<LD>   "I will not run again," he told a crowd of reporters and a few
tearful Liberal Party supporters. "For 40 years, the Liberal Party
has been like a family to me." Stepping down, he said, is "the best
way to bring back unity, to end the fighting, to resume interrupted
friendships."</LD>
<TE>   Chretien's departure after four decades on the national scene
would mark the end of one of the most successful political careers in
Canadian history. The 18th of 19 children from a small Quebec paper
mill town, Chretien won his first Parliament seat when he was 29.
Known as a scrappy "street fighter" who loves a political clash, by
33 he had become Canada's youngest Cabinet member. Chretien worked to
keep his province from seceding from Canada in the 1970s and helped
reform federal policies toward indigenous peoples.</TE>
<TE>   He became prime minister in 1993 and, in leading three consecutive
majority governments, became the longest-serving leader among the
industrial powers. He is credited with reversing Canada's heavy
deficits to achieve a healthy economic surplus and with staving off
Quebec's nearly successful quest for independence in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Deaf in one ear, and with his face partially paralyzed by Bell's
palsy, he has never been a polished politician, and portrays himself
as a man of the people, "the little guy from Shawinigan," who spoke
of "the rich and the rest of us," despite being a millionaire
himself.</TE>
<TE>   Since beginning his third term in November 2000, however,
Chretien's reign has been tarnished by accusations of corruption,
patronage and lack of vision. The patronage scandal, involving
government advertising and investment contracts, forced Chretien to
strengthen ethics regulations. Internal political fighting all but
paralyzed the party.</TE>
<TE>   As his popularity waned, support for his rival, Martin, grew, and
Chretien fired him as finance minister in June to head off a
leadership challenge.</TE>
<TE>   "The move backfired," said John Duffy, a political analyst for
Strategy Corp., a liberal think tank based in Toronto. "The party and
public said, 'It's you who should go, not the heir apparent.' "</TE>
<TE>   At a summer Liberal Party caucus, the feud escalated into a
showdown. This week, Chretien tried to draw up a "loyalty list" of
supporters, but only 88 of 170 party members were willing to pledge
allegiance to their longtime leader. Faced with that shortfall,
Chretien announced his impending retirement.</TE>
<TE>   In his speech, Chretien said he will need 18 months to finish his
governing agenda, and will then step down before the end of his term.
He confided that he had decided when he started his third term not to
seek a fourth and that he had already taken an option to buy a house
to retire to in 2004. "And then, at the age of 70, I will look back
with great satisfaction as I take my rest secure in the knowledge
that the future of Canada is unlimited," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Martin, now the clear front-runner for Liberal Party leadership,
praised Chretien on Wednesday as "an outstanding prime minister" and
a courageous man and made clear that it's better to have the street
fighter from Shawinigan for you than against you.</TE>
<TE>   "I can assure you that nobody in the government could have enjoyed
the success they did without the support and leadership" of Chretien,
he said.</TE>

<HD>Israel Raids Refugee Camp in Gaza; Palestinian Man Is

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>KHAN YUNIS, Gaza Strip</DL>
<LD>Israeli tanks and helicopters raided this southern Gaza Strip refugee
camp Wednesday, destroying buildings in an incursion that shook a
fragile Israeli-Palestinian security plan seen as a test for a truce.</LD>
<LD>   A Palestinian man was killed when a house collapsed on him during
the raid as the tanks, backed by the helicopters, rolled into the
camp before dawn.</LD>
<LD>   Under the security plan sealed Sunday, Israel agreed to ease
military restrictions on civilian movement in Gaza and the West Bank
city of Bethlehem if Palestinian police reduced "terror and violence"
by militants. Troops pulled out of Bethlehem on Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   Wednesday's incursion came a day after an Israeli soldier guarding
a nearby Jewish settlement was shot and killed by the Islamic group
Hamas.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian residents said Israeli soldiers in tanks entered the
camp and shouted with megaphones for residents to leave. Helicopters
circled overhead and the tanks fired machine guns, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "There were two helicopters in the sky. They started firing their
machine guns on houses, in the streets, and sliced through the
electricity wires. The whole refugee camp was thrown into darkness,"
resident Salim abu Amouna said.</TE>
<TE>   An army statement said troops destroyed two empty buildings that
served as shooting posts and shelter to terrorists.</TE>

When the weather turns nasty, they snap into action, blasting
artillery into the sky and pulverizing the enemy before it strikes.</LD>

war with the elements for as long as they can remember. Each summer,
walnut-sized hailstones threaten to tumble from the heavens and wipe
out entire harvests of corn, cabbage, tobacco and wheat, ruining
their meager sources of food and livelihood.</LD>
<LD>   There was no taming Mother Nature until intrepid villagers formed
an all-girl army of hail-busters three decades ago, a gutsy outgrowth
of the Chinese women's movement.</LD>
<TE>   Working wonders with out-of-date antiaircraft artillery from
China's wars in Korea and against Vietnam, these weather guerrillas
have become cult heroes to many local folks, who give thanks to them
for surveying the skies and saving the crops.</TE>
<TE>   "My grandfather tells me that hailstorms are afraid of young
girls," said He Liefang, 17, one of about 55 young women on duty this
year here in Longxian County in Shaanxi province.</TE>
<TE>   Granted, shooting artillery shells at storm clouds is an unusual
way of controlling hail. A sprinkling of American farmers has
experimented with similar methods, among them firing sonic waves into
the sky to disperse hailstorms before they hit.</TE>
<TE>   But most scientists consider such attempts wishful thinking,
saying there is no way to prove what nature would have done without
the effort. So any claim of success, they say, is dubious.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to be cruel and call it scientific illiteracy," said
Fred Carr, director of the school of meteorology at the University of
Oklahoma. "But people don't really understand the cause and effect.
It's like saying, 'I slammed the door and the hail didn't fall on my
house.' "</TE>
<TE>   But many Chinese swear by their artillery power.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course it works. Otherwise, we wouldn't have used it for so
long," said Wang Shuaixiong, a Communist Party cadre at the weather
bureau here, explaining that the artillery is laced with chemicals
that speed up condensation and produce rainfall instead of hail.</TE>
<TE>   Weather manipulation plays a critical role in China's national
image. The central government prides itself on delivering clear skies
on demand. The Chinese believe that by using planes and rockets to
induce early rainfall before major public events such as the Oct. 1
National Day, Mother Nature doesn't rain on Chinese parades.</TE>
<TE>   It is with the same confidence that Beijing has promised the world
good weather for the 2008 Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   In rural Shaanxi province, however, the significance of human
intervention is much more profound. According to local reports,
hundreds of young women have fired more than 75,000 shells at about
700 hailstorms over the last three decades.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the scientists may claim, local officials believe that
these precipitation platoons have spared the region millions of
dollars in potential losses.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't mean there are no failures. Just as not every prayer
is answered, the true believers of hail-busting say you must keep at
it to see results.</TE>
<TE>   A few other hail-prone Chinese provinces have also resorted to
this unconventional method of battling nature.</TE>
<TE>   But the Longxian County brigade is believed to be the only one
staffed entirely by women.</TE>
<TE>   It's a legacy of the Cultural Revolution of 30 years ago. Chairman
Mao preached the slogan "Women hold up half the sky." The second sex
proved its loyalty by carrying guns, drilling for oil and driving
trucks.</TE>
<TE>   Eager to stay on the cutting edge, a group of Longxian women
volunteered in the early 1970s to staff the new anti-hail storm
stations funded by the provincial government so men wouldn't have to
abandon the fields during the busy harvest season.</TE>
<TE>   Job Doesn't Pay Well</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, the tradition stuck. Some women proudly passed
their jobs to their daughters. Others do it simply for the money.</TE>
<TE>   Which isn't much. The government pays less than $20 a month--too
little for the men, who could earn a lot more as migrants in the
cities. But for the young women, most of whom can't afford to go on
to middle school, it's a decent first job.</TE>
<TE>   Almost all of the recruits are teens. The oldest is in her early
20s and the youngest barely 16. Married women aren't eligible.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to stay here. I can always find a boyfriend later," said
He, the 17-year-old dressed in a rose-petal-print blouse with white
collar.</TE>
<TE>   The men in the village have come to see hail-busting as a woman's
job.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't raise a family on an artilleryman's salary, so it's
normal for the girls to do it instead," said Wang Lin, a villager who
spends six months out of the year in the city as a construction
worker.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, the girls are much better at it.</TE>
<TE>   "The boys don't want to do it, because most of the time it's too
boring and the money is no good," said Yan Tienlin, another villager.
"The girls are better at it because they are more patient and they
won't make mischief with the explosives."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, these young women seem to get very little supervision.
After two weeks of training, they're virtually on their own, spread
out in groups of four or five across 13 mountaintops.</TE>
<TE>   They live in simple brick barracks for six months of the year.
They take turns going home for short breaks and never leave their
posts unattended.</TE>
<TE>   Twice a day, they contact the local weather bureau on ancient
two-way radios that look like they were ripped out of a junkyard
pickup truck.</TE>
<TE>   A scratchy voice on the other end will order them, just like
Charlie does with his angels, to stay put or gear up for war.</TE>
<TE>   They work together as a team of loader, targeter, shooter and
commander. They serve as each other's eyes and ears, arms and legs in
the wrestling match against the storm.</TE>
<TE>   Their invisible bosses count on absolute obedience. No one can
fire when aircraft are in the skies above. Every "attack" follows a
direct order from the radio, down to the exact minute and number of
shells to be fired.</TE>
<TE>   "Fighting hail is a very complicated matter," said Wang from the
weather station. "We must coordinate with the air force and the
airlines to determine the exact timing of the attack."</TE>
<TE>   It may sound complicated, but the hail watchers don't even own a
telephone. In fact, most of the 13 squads scattered across this
mountainous region have only recently acquired electricity and small
donated television sets. But the TVs sit mostly idle because none of
the young women can afford to buy antennas.</TE>
<TE>   So they do without, even if it means missing the all-important
daily weather report that trails the evening news.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not worth it," He said. "We've been here three months, but
we've only been paid for one. We know they have no money."</TE>
<TE>   Yet there must be something irresistible about a job that can pull
teenagers from their homes and plop them onto deserted hilltops to
pass long, boring days waiting for a few short minutes of action.</TE>
<TE>   The hail season here drags on roughly from May to October. For
those months, they eat plain, homemade noodles and carry water up the
hills in metal barrels balanced on a stick. They sleep two to a room
in dorms just steps away from their artillery gun.</TE>
<TE>   They fill the emptiness between the storms staring into the
distance of terraced fields, playing a simple video game on the TV
screen, picking fresh green walnuts from the trees, pulling
wildflowers from the side of the road and scrubbing down their
well-worn weapon.</TE>
<TE>   "I was terrified in the beginning," said Liu Ying, a shy
18-year-old with a thick ponytail and pink, strappy heels. "All I
wanted to do was run back to my house."</TE>
<TE>   She stayed and became hooked on the deafening sound of artillery
fire.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was in the fourth grade, a big hailstorm hit our village
and destroyed our family's cornfield," Liu recalled. "My mother was
so sad, she cried. That's when I knew I wanted to do this."</TE>
<TE>   Today she is a skilled artillery woman. Her weapon is a 1955
Soviet-made antiaircraft gun, a museum piece that still bears the
insignia of a bygone era.</TE>
<TE>   "Without the people, there is no people's army," reads one of two
fading Chairman Mao slogans on the rusted panels. "Without the
people's army, the people have nothing."</TE>
<TE>   Preparing to Fight</TE>
<TE>   Liu's job during an attack is to load the ammunition into the gun.
Stacks of hefty steel shells pop in and out of her hands.</TE>
<TE>   Her comrade, He, hops into the driver's seat and spins the
steering wheel, panning the body of the weapon in a fan-shaped swing
as she chases storm clouds from side to side.</TE>
<TE>   The longest-serving cadet is 19-year-old Wang Qingjuan. Her job is
to aim the long barrel of the gun up into the center of the storm.</TE>
<TE>   One of the girls not operating the weapon waits by the radio for
the command to shoot. Another runs out to yell "Fire!" The trigger--a
pedal under Wang's pink-slippered feet--is pushed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely nerve-racking to do this when the rain is
pounding," said Wang, the oldest of three siblings, who joined the
hail-busters when she was 15. She stands barely 5 feet tall and loves
to wear fuchsia lipstick and blue earrings. "The raincoats they
issued us are too big. We don't wear them, so we get soaked. Some of
us get sick afterward."</TE>
<TE>   The girls' only chaperon is a white-haired grandfather figure
assigned to watch over them and the box of explosives stocked in the
room where he sleeps.</TE>
<TE>   "Without these girls, the damage to the village would be
unthinkable," said their guardian, Wang Changqian, 67, a sturdy
farmer with two bottom teeth.</TE>
<TE>   In nearby Henan province last month, a hailstorm killed 18 people.
Wang from the weather station said he suspects a lack of hail-busters
there.</TE>
<TE>   "Not every attack works, of course," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "But most of the time, we attack and there's no hail. We don't
attack and there is hail."</TE>
<TE>   Hail-Blasting History</TE>
<TE>   Wang the guardian is a veteran of the Korean War.</TE>
<TE>   He still remembers the days before modern artillery. Villagers
tried in vain to blast hailstorms with primitive rocket grenades that
basically worked like giant firecrackers.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't reach very far," Wang said. "Only men dared to light
them."</TE>
<TE>   Today, the young women know they've done more for the village than
their forefathers ever could. It's written in their logbooks, in
childish but proud characters that prove the girls do much more than
hold up half the sky. Sometimes, they control it.</TE>
<TE>   "Time: 14:03 to 14:04. Before attack: rolling thunder, howling
winds, flash lightning. After attack: no damage to the fields."</TE>

<HD>Terror Cell Broken Up, Israel Says</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Hamas members allegedly had Israeli IDs that let
them carry out bombings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Israeli security officials said Wednesday that they have cracked a
Hamas cell based in East Jerusalem whose members exploited Israeli
identity cards to carry out some of the most frightening bombing
attacks in recent months, including one at Hebrew University that
killed five Americans and four Israelis.</LD>
<LD>   A total of 15 people were arrested last weekend in Jerusalem and
in the West Bank, security officials said. Among them, the officials
said, is a Palestinian painter who worked at Hebrew University and is
suspected of planting an explosives-packed bag in the Frank Sinatra
Student Center's cafeteria during lunchtime on July 31.</LD>
<LD>   The officials said the cell was also responsible for a deadly
bombing at a crowded, trendy cafe across the street from the prime
minister's residence here in March and, perhaps most significant, a
string of attacks on strategic targets, including railways and
Israel's main fuel depot.</LD>
<TE>   "This was an especially creative group," one security agent said.
The cell plotted operations that not only could cause deaths but also
had the potential to cause severe damage to the Israeli economy, as
well as the transportation and communications infrastructure, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Hamas, a radical Islamic movement that advocates the destruction
of Israel, has been active in East Jerusalem but rarely on this
scale, the officials said.</TE>
<TE>   All told, the cell was responsible for eight attacks, 35 deaths
and scores of injuries, the officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The arrests were announced at a rare briefing for foreign
journalists by Israel's domestic General Security Service, known as
the Shin Bet. The agents spoke on the condition that they not be
identified by name.</TE>
<TE>   The agents emphasized the use by the cell members of Israeli
identity cards that facilitated their movement in Jerusalem and
throughout Israel. Thousands of Arab residents of the city, in
contrast to Palestinians who live in the West Bank, hold Israeli
identity cards that entitle them to some benefits, such as social
security and freer movement.</TE>
<TE>   "They misused their ... status to gather information and to move
and carry out terror attacks," said a senior official with the Shin
Bet. "They put deep thought behind this plan. They didn't pick
targets by chance."</TE>
<TE>   Politicians responded to the news with calls to revoke the
citizenship of Israeli Arabs involved in terrorist acts and to
demolish their homes, a measure already employed by the army against
West Bank Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Shin Bet agents were careful to say the existence of
the cell did not implicate all Arabs of East Jerusalem, Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon's office made less of a distinction.</TE>
<TE>   "The implications directly damage the trust given to residents of
eastern Jerusalem who could pay a dear social and economic price as a
result of being alienated from the Jewish population, and as a result
of being considered as suspicious in all areas," said a statement
from the office.</TE>
<TE>   The security officials said they had pieced together the
identities of the cell members through intelligence, including Arab
informants and surveillance. They learned that the group was planning
another large-scale attack last Saturday and staked out their
designated meeting place. Shin Bet, police and army units intercepted
one suspect, Wissam Abassi, 25, at a roadblock near the site on
Jerusalem's northern edge, then gave chase after two others, Wael
Kassem, 31, and Alah Abassi, 30, who allegedly fled with a bomb.</TE>
<TE>   The pair were caught in central Jerusalem after ditching the bomb,
officials said. Within hours, two additional suspects, Mohammed Odeh,
29, and Mahmed Arman, 27, were arrested at their homes. The security
officials named Arman as the ringleader. Odeh is the painter who
worked at Hebrew University.</TE>
<TE>   All but Arman live in East Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   Three days after the arrests, police found a concealed bomb
alongside the main Jerusalem-Tel Aviv highway and defused it in an
operation that tied up traffic for hours.</TE>
<TE>   Details were not available on the capture of the other 10
suspects, who were from the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Through their interrogations of Odeh, the security officials said
they learned new details of how the Hebrew University attack was
carried out. Odeh had easy access to the campus by virtue of his job.
He smuggled the bomb in a bag onto the campus one night and hid it in
the bushes, the officials said. The next day, they say, he picked up
the bomb and left it on a table in the cafeteria, covered with an
Israeli newspaper. From the outskirts of the campus he allegedly
detonated the explosive with a cellular phone call.</TE>
<TE>   Odeh chose a cafeteria where he believed few Arabs would be eating
or working, the officials said. He was aware that foreigners would be
present, they said.</TE>
<TE>   The day after the cafeteria blast, Odeh was among the workers
brought in to repair and paint the damage, the officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Samir Odeh denied Wednesday evening that his brother was guilty of
anything.</TE>
<TE>   "He goes to work and then he goes home, and he's not involved in
any [radical] movements," Samir Odeh told Israeli television.</TE>
<TE>   The orders behind the attacks, the planning and the explosives
originated in the West Bank city of Ramallah and reached the cell in
East Jerusalem, the officials said. Two of the attacks attributed to
the cell involved suicide bombings--the cafe in March and a pool hall
in May--but the rest involved explosives activated by remote control.</TE>
<TE>   In part, the agents said, the shift in tactics reflected a desire
to preserve assets as valuable as the men with Israeli identity cards
had proved to be.</TE>

<HD>Pakistani President Expands His Powers</HD>
<DH>Asia: Leader says that by unilaterally altering the
constitution, he is advancing democracy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>Despite widespread criticism, President Pervez Musharraf unilaterally
amended the Pakistani Constitution on Wednesday, granting himself
sweeping powers--including the right to dissolve parliament--and
extending his term in office.</LD>
<LD>   "Pakistan is passing through a very crucial transitional period,"
Musharraf told reporters in announcing his decision to impose the
amendments, which were unveiled in June. "We are taking Pakistan from
democratic dictatorship to elected democracy. I want to introduce a
sustainable democratic order."</LD>
<LD>   Critics, however, argued that the 29 amendments were a blow to the
very democracy that Musharraf promised to restore by holding
elections Oct. 10 for parliament and provincial legislatures.</LD>
<TE>   "We don't believe that an individual or group has the right to
amend the constitution," said Raza Rabbai of the opposition Pakistan
People's Party, led by former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. "This is
the sole prerogative of the parliament."</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf said he would remain president and army chief for the
next five years and as president he would have the right to name the
heads of the three military branches and the chairman of the joint
chiefs of staff.</TE>
<TE>   The moves should help Musharraf wield power even after October's
elections.</TE>

<HD>Abu Nidal Had Been Due in Court</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Authorities found weapons and false documents in
terrorist's home, Iraqi official says.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BAGHDAD</DL>
<LD>Terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal ended his life with a gunshot wound
when security agents went to his apartment to arrest him, Iraq's
intelligence chief said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Tahir Jalil Haboush said that weapons and false passports were
found in Abu Nidal's apartment in Baghdad, the Iraqi capital. Haboush
also said that the radical Palestinian was suspected of
"communicating" with a foreign country, but he refused to specify
which one.</LD>
<LD>   He did not specify when Abu Nidal had died.</LD>
<TE>   In Beirut, the Lebanese capital, Abu Nidal's organization, the
radical Fatah Revolutionary Council, said its leader was killed by
one of Baghdad's intelligence agencies and urged Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein to investigate.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian officials in the West Bank said Abu Nidal, 65, was
found dead of multiple gunshot wounds Friday. But Haboush said a
single shot killed him.</TE>
<TE>   According to Haboush, when security officers arrived to take Abu
Nidal to court, he said he needed to go to his bedroom to change
clothes. Officers then heard a gun fired and found that Abu Nidal had
shot himself in the mouth, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Abu Nidal later died in a hospital, Haboush said.</TE>
<TE>   Haboush showed photos of what he said was Abu Nidal's body. One
set showed a gray-haired man lying in a bed, his face streaked with
blood that had soaked his pillow. Another set of photos showed the
man in a hospital bed, hooked up to an oxygen mask and intravenous
bags.</TE>
<TE>   The intelligence chief said an Arab state, which he would not
identify, informed Baghdad in 1999 that Abu Nidal had entered Iraq
from Iran using a false Yemeni passport. Iraq had never admitted that
Abu Nidal was in the country until reports of his death surfaced.</TE>
<TE>   But in Beirut, Abu Nidal's group claimed that he had entered Iraq
"with the full knowledge and preparations" of the authorities.</TE>

<HD>Schroeder Holds to His Refusal to Support a U.S. Strike
Against Iraq</HD>
<DH>Europe: The German leader insists that his stance hasn't
set back ties with the White House.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>Droll and self-assured despite a spate of ecological and diplomatic
crises, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder stood by his holstered
guns Wednesday in reiterating his refusal to back a U.S. military
strike against Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   Though Schroeder has been chastised by Washington for calling the
emerging plans for such an assault a military "adventure," the German
leader insisted that his relationship with the White House remains
intact.</LD>
<LD>   "We have a solid foundation in our relations on which we can
discuss what should or shouldn't happen in Iraq," Schroeder told the
Foreign Press Assn. "Friendship doesn't mean that you agree all the
time on every single issue."</LD>
<TE>   As evidence of the transatlantic partnership's endurance through
disagreement, Schroeder noted that Europeans have had to live with
the Bush administration's decision last year to abandon the 1997
Kyoto Protocol, which is aimed at reducing emissions of so-called
greenhouse gases. That dispute was particularly troubling in recent
days because torrential rains and flooding ravaging Germany have been
blamed by some scientists on global warming.</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder reiterated that Germany was unprepared to take part in
any military action against Iraq without United Nations Security
Council authorization and broader discussion within the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization. Other European members of the alliance
also have expressed reservations about U.S. intentions.</TE>
<TE>   The chancellor added that even in U.S. political circles there is
mounting skepticism about a go-it-alone attack to punish Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein for allegedly producing weapons of mass
destruction.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, opponents seeking Hussein's overthrow took four people
hostage at the Iraqi Embassy here, in a short-lived attempt to
spotlight the U.S.-led push for a change of regime in Iraq. Before
they were overpowered by police and taken into custody, the five
members of the little-known Democratic Iraqi Opposition of Germany
also said they were trying to heighten German awareness of the crisis
in their homeland.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Ambassador Daniel R. Coats called on Schroeder's office last
week to express Washington's "disappointment" over the chancellor's
recent statements about Iraq, which the White House as well as the
chancellor's political opponents have characterized as
electioneering. Schroeder is facing an uphill battle for reelection
next month.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Tuesday with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung
newspaper, Coats disputed the German government's characterization of
his meeting with Schroeder advisors as a courtesy call to clarify
both sides' positions. Coats said he wasn't seeking clarifications
from the Chancellery but confirmation of its support for President
Bush's declared war against terrorism, the conservative newspaper
reported.</TE>
<TE>   Asked at the meeting with foreign journalists if he felt pressured
by the White House to fall in line with its Iraq policy, Schroeder
joked that there was no occasion for either side to apply thumbscrews
to force its position on the other.</TE>
<TE>   "See, my thumbs are completely uninjured!" the 58-year-old
chancellor insisted, holding up both digits for inspection.</TE>
<TE>   In his wide-ranging exchange, Schroeder focused on the daunting
challenge facing his country to rebuild after billions of dollars in
damage inflicted by record flooding along the Elbe River. From the
baroque architectural treasures of Dresden to agriculture and
modernized industries, much of the investment in reconstructing
eastern Germany since the nation's 1990 reunification has been wiped
out by the natural disaster.</TE>
<TE>   Flood waters have receded in Dresden, leaving germ-ridden muck
throughout the historic Old Town, but downriver sites such as the
city of Magdeburg and the farming communities of Brandenburg state
were still battling the swollen Elbe on Wednesday. In the town of
Wittenberge, 20,000 people were being evacuated as the river washed
away levees. Even in regions where the waters have crested, few of
the 80,000 Germans already forced from their homes earlier in the
two-week disaster have been able to return because of fears of damage
to their homes' foundations.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been the federal government's biggest deployment in
postwar history," Schroeder said of the 50,000 troops, emergency
service workers and border guards engaged in a rolling effort to
shore up dikes and protect bridges. An additional 100,000 civilian
volunteers also are struggling against the swells coursing northward.</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder vowed to rebuild and predicted that the massive effort
would stimulate the economy as well as revive Germans'
self-confidence and industriousness.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the ecological damage--and some say because of
it--Schroeder's political standing has been rising as Germans have
positively assessed his crisis-management skills. His Social
Democratic Party remains 6 to 8 percentage points behind the
conservative Christian Democratic Union, but Schroeder has maintained
or widened his lead over challenger Edmund Stoiber in polls measuring
the candidates' approval ratings.</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder was confident that his governing coalition with the
environmentalist Greens will be returned to office after the Sept. 22
vote, insisting that Germans don't hold the government responsible
for poor economic performance resulting from a global downturn.</TE>
<TE>   Asked why his party lags behind the opposition while he still
handily beats out Stoiber, Schroeder replied with as much confidence
as humor: "I ask myself that all the time."</TE>

<HD>Serbs and Muslims Settle a Score: Yugoslavia 2, Bosnia 0</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALISSA J. RUBIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina</DL>
<LD>The vicious war between Serbs and Muslims in this country ended seven
years ago, but the scars are so deep that it has been all but
impossible for people on the two sides to see each other as human.</LD>
<LD>   But on Wednesday, in an encouraging sign of normalization, the
national soccer team of predominantly Serbian Yugoslavia and the
Muslim-dominated Bosnian national team played their first match, here
in this war-damaged capital.</LD>
<LD>   In a region where soccer is, in the words of both Serbs and
Muslims, "the most important unimportant thing," it was far more than
a sporting event.</LD>
<TE>   The game was a marker of a slow but real evolution in the way
people from the two countries see each other--and a reminder of how
far they have to go.</TE>
<TE>   Though the match--won by Yugoslavia, 2-0--was relatively peaceful,
the experience of the war permeated the event.</TE>
<TE>   Fans shouted the names of wartime leaders, waved the wartime flags
and shouted religious slogans. Still, the deadly potency of such
language seemed truly diminished.</TE>
<TE>   "This is finally just football now; the war is over," said Vahidin
Hodzic, 29, a Bosnian Muslim veteran of the war. He was one of many
people who seemed to want to put the past behind him, as he bounced a
friend's 7-year-old son on his knee.</TE>
<TE>   For some Serbian fans too, it was important that the fight was on
the soccer field and not in the streets. "I'm very glad this game can
happen; it's the first time a [Yugoslav] national team has come here.
Nobody can benefit from war," said Natko Sudzuka, 22, a Bosnian Serb
waiter from Sarajevo who attended the game.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly there is a special charge to this game. But the past is
the past; now it's a game," said Admir Tukic, 22, a Bosnian Muslim
student of mechanical engineering. "The war will always haunt us. My
uncle was killed, I lost many friends, but the same thing happened to
many Serbs too.</TE>
<TE>   "Still," Tukic added, "there will always be individuals who make
trouble."</TE>
<TE>   And that was the case at Wednesday's game. A small group of
Bosnian Muslims lingered afterward, throwing rocks at police who were
protecting the Yugoslav team's fans. The Muslims smashed the
windshield of one car and trashed another car bearing Yugoslav
license plates.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, the violence would have been more damaging had there
not been about 200 uniformed police and undercover officers,
assiduously keeping the two groups of fans apart. That is the case at
many European soccer games.</TE>
<TE>   Violence, however, is an undercurrent here in Bosnia, which
remains a country more in name than in soul. The 3 1/2-year war began
in 1992 after Bosnia, a republic in the former Yugoslav federation,
declared independence. The new country was made up of Muslims and
ethnic Croats and Serbs.</TE>
<TE>   Many Bosnian Serbs violently opposed independence. Backed by the
Yugoslav army and paramilitary groups, they fought to block the move.
They expelled almost all non-Serbs from the territories they
controlled and massacred Muslim men and boys. The fighting claimed an
estimated 200,000 lives, most of them Muslim, making it the most
deadly conflict in Europe since World War II.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S.-brokered deal that ended the war--known as the Dayton,
Ohio, accords--divided Bosnia into two parts: the Muslim-Croat
Federation and a Serbian entity known as Republika Srpska. Although
in theory all people are entitled to reclaim the homes and land they
had before the war, many areas on both sides remain segregated.
Indeed, to this day most Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina do not see the
country as their homeland.</TE>
<TE>   For Muslim soccer fans, the greatest insult at Wednesday's game
was not the Yugoslav team's victory or even its presence. It was that
the Bosnian Serbs who attended cheered for Yugoslavia rather than for
the national squad, made up almost entirely of Muslims and Croats.</TE>
<TE>   "It wouldn't be so bad if fans from the Republika Srpska weren't
fans of Yugoslavia instead of being fans of Bosnia," said Kenan Seta,
22, a Muslim. "Our police will try to make sure nothing bad happens
to them, but I'm sure if we went to Belgrade [the Yugoslav capital],
I don't think one of us would come back alive."</TE>
<TE>   For Bosnian Serbs, the greatest insult was the roar of catcalls
and boos from Muslims when the Yugoslav national anthem was played at
the game's outset. "We were all born under that anthem," said Mladen
Gardovic, a Serbian native of Sarajevo. "The anthem, the country
[Yugoslavia] gave them everything."</TE>
<TE>   Soon after Muslims booed the Yugoslav anthem, Bosnian Serbs
responded by chanting the names of some of the figures who had been
most brutal toward Muslims: Ratko Mladic, the Serbian general accused
by the United Nations' International Criminal Tribunal for the Former
Yugoslavia of ordering the 1995 slaughter of more than 7,000 Muslim
men and boys in the town of Srebrenica; Zeljko "Arkan" Raznatovic, a
late paramilitary leader known for his cruelty; and Radovan Karadzic,
the Bosnian Serbs' wartime president.</TE>
<TE>   The Bosnian Muslims responded by shouting, "Allahu akbar!" an
Arabic phrase meaning "God is great!" that is often said during
Muslim prayers. They unfurled the flags of Saudi Arabia and Turkey,
as well as the wartime flag of Bosnia.</TE>
<TE>   But it was a verbal battery, not a physical one.</TE>
<TE>   And in a country where scores have been settled with murder, the
shelling of houses and the rape of women, soccer seemed a far better
forum.</TE>
<TE>   In Sarajevo, the ground itself is sown with memories of the
soul-sapping siege by Bosnian Serb forces that the city endured from
1992 to 1995. Practice fields that once surrounded the stadium became
cemeteries during the war after graveyards ran out of space. A nearby
hospital treated many victims of the fighting.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, there seemed a real desire to let that unforgettable
past recede enough for people to go on.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a sign of normalization; like other countries, we can
play football with our neighbors," said Jakob Finci, the head of
Bosnia's Civil Service Agency and a longtime leader of Sarajevo's
Jewish community.</TE>
<TE>   "If we can do this," he added, "the country can overcome even the
worst of the war."</TE>
<TE>   Esad Filipovic, a sports reporter covering the game for
Oslobodenje, the largest Bosnian daily, agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "From an overall political perspective, the game is good," he
said. "The time is passing; we have to keep on living."</TE>

<HD>Lawmaker Found Shot to Death in a Moscow Park</HD>
<DH>Russia: Slaying appears to be a professional hit, police
say. Months earlier, the victim had thwarted what may have been a bid
on his life.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>Unidentified attackers gunned down a Russian lawmaker while he was
walking his dog in a park Wednesday, the eighth member of parliament
to be killed since 1994.</LD>
<LD>   The killing of Vladimir Golovlyov, 54, as he was walking his
Asian-Turkmen wolfhound had the earmarks of a professional hit and
followed what may have been a thwarted assassination attempt against
him only a few months ago, police and associates said.</LD>
<LD>   But fellow politicians were unsure whether Golovlyov was more
likely killed because of an allegedly corrupt past or because of his
role leading the small Liberal Russia faction in the lower house of
parliament. The group is loyal to self-exiled tycoon Boris A.
Berezovsky, one of President Vladimir V. Putin's chief political
enemies.</LD>
<TE>   Golovlyov's body was found near his home in woods where he often
took walks. He had been shot once in the body and once in the head, a
wound that police said looked like an "insurance" shot.</TE>
<TE>   His 75-year-old mother, Moza, who lived with her son, said he had
left their apartment at 7:50 a.m. Within 15 minutes, a neighbor was
at her door telling her that something terrible had happened.</TE>
<TE>   "I dropped everything and hurried to the park where he usually
walked the dog. Volodya was lying on the grass, already dead," she
said, weeping softly. "The police had already arrived, but they let
me approach Volodya's body."</TE>
<TE>   Bodyguards Nearby</TE>
<TE>   Moscow Prosecutor Mikhail Avdyukov told the Interfax news agency
that unknown attackers had carried out the killing in the city's
Mitino district. Golovlyov had two bodyguards nearby "who said that
they didn't see anything," Avdyukov was quoted as saying. An
automatic pistol cartridge case, but no weapon, was found at the
scene.</TE>
<TE>   Within hours, investigators for the state prosecutor's office went
through the office of Golovlyov's faction looking for documents that
might shed light on the case, according to Yelena Sokolova, a
spokeswoman for the political group.</TE>
<TE>   "The murder of a lawmaker is, in any case and circumstance, a
political matter," said Boris Y. Nemtsov, leader of the Union of
Right Forces, who urged prosecutors to conduct a full investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Golovlyov was elected to the lower house, or State Duma, in 1993
and served for a time as its budget committee chairman. He quit
Nemtsov's party this year to co-found Liberal Russia, which is highly
critical of Putin, accusing the president of autocratic government.</TE>
<TE>   The slaying "is without a doubt politically motivated," said
Sergei Yushenkov, a co-chairman of Liberal Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Yushenkov said that Golovlyov had spoken recently of being
followed and that two or three months ago he turned his dog on two
men who he believed were about to attack him.</TE>
<TE>   "The death is a huge loss for all liberal political forces in
Russia and ultimately the Russian people," Yushenkov said. "We have
lost a person who understood very well what was happening in the
country and who had the guts and determination to fight for what he
thought was right."</TE>
<TE>   Under a Legal Cloud</TE>
<TE>   But Golovlyov had been under a legal cloud because of allegations
that he had misappropriated $10 million in the early 1990s from
social service and regional investment funds of Chelyabinsk, an
industrial center in the Ural Mountains. The slain lawmaker had said
the charges, issued last year by the Chelyabinsk regional prosecutor,
were false and a political reprisal for his support of Berezovsky.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the State Duma voted in November to lift his
parliamentary immunity, a move that allowed the investigation to
continue while still blocking his arrest. Meanwhile, Golovlyov was
barred from leaving Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Some State Duma colleagues speculated that the killing may have
been to keep Golovlyov from implicating at any trial individuals who
may have enriched themselves illegally in the Chelyabinsk industrial
privatization of the 1990s. In any case, the slaying seemed likely to
reinforce the image of rampant gangland violence in Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1994, seven other members of the State Duma have died
violently, among them liberal St. Petersburg politician Galina V.
Starovoitova, whose 1998 shooting death remains unsolved. Aside from
State Duma members, municipal officials and business executives
frequently have been targeted.</TE>
<TE>   Moza Golovlyov, in a telephone interview Wednesday night,
described her son as a "truly great person." She said she had no idea
who or what was behind the killing, but she doubted that the
Chelyabinsk matters dating back almost a decade would have been the
cause.</TE>
<TE>   "What is there to be said about a country where even the people's
deputies are not safe? ... What kind of a country is it where a Duma
deputy steps out of his apartment to walk his dog and in 10 minutes
he is already dead?" she asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Assassinations of politicians give the country a very bad name,
proving that lawlessness and criminal outrage are not just empty
words in Russia," she went on. "Regrettably, they have become the
reality in our daily life."</TE>

<HD>Enron Insider Accuses Boss</HD>
<DH>Energy: Plea agreement implicates former CFO Andrew Fastow
in a series of schemes. 'We will chase the money,' a Justice Dept.
official says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON and ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Enron Corp.'s former chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, was
implicated by an associate Wednesday in a series of criminal schemes
to profit from Enron's off-the-books partnerships.</LD>
<LD>   Although Fastow has not been charged with any crimes, his role was
outlined in a plea agreement with former subordinate Michael J.
Kopper, 37, who admitted to wire fraud and money laundering. Kopper
agreed to forfeit $12 million in profits and cooperate with
prosecutors.</LD>
<LD>   Fastow, Kopper and others pocketed millions of dollars through
three partnerships that did business with the energy giant, including
a previously undisclosed deal that cloaked Enron's ownership of
lucrative wind farms in California, according to papers filed in U.S.
District Court in Houston.</LD>
<TE>   Federal authorities said they will seek to seize $23.6 million
that they say Kopper passed on to Fastow's family and others, as well
as a nearly 12,000-square-foot mansion Fastow was building in a
Houston suburb, through civil forfeiture proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   "We will chase the money and seek to get it back," vowed a senior
Justice Department official who asked not to be identified. "This
money is treated as tainted."</TE>
<TE>   Court documents also show that Fastow's wife, Lea, was paid
$54,000 as an administrative assistant in one of the questionable
partnerships. One legal expert said federal authorities may be
applying pressure on Fastow by threatening prosecution of his wife.</TE>
<TE>   But the Justice Department official said there is not believed to
have been any discussion at this point of bringing criminal charges
against Lea Fastow. A spokesman for Fastow declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Experts said the plea bargain with Kopper is a significant advance
for the government because he can help prosecutors build a case
against Fastow, who is believed to have orchestrated the
off-the-books partnerships that lay behind Enron's disintegration.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a substantial break for our investigation," said Leslie
Caldwell, head of the Justice Department's Enron task force. "...
When someone agrees to cooperate, essentially all of the knowledge
they have becomes our knowledge."</TE>
<TE>   The case may go a long way toward cementing Enron critics'
allegations that the firm's partnerships were fraudulent entities all
along. Key former executives have insisted that the partnerships
served legitimate purposes.</TE>
<TE>   In court papers, prosecutors alleged that Fastow, 40, and Kopper
deceived investors in the formation and operation of three
partnerships from 1997 through July 2001. The details of two of them,
known as Chewco and Southampton, had previously been made public. But
the third, RADR, contained new details about how the two men went to
great lengths to disguise wrongdoing from government regulators and
investors.</TE>
<TE>   The partnership was formed to mask Enron's control of
electricity-generating windmill farms in California. The scheme
involved outside investors buying stakes in the farms, according to
court papers. Unknown to investors, Fastow lent money to Kopper, who
in turn lent money to personal friends to acquire their stakes.</TE>
<TE>   In a three-year period, the investors earned about $2.7 million,
and when the deal was later unwound and Enron bought back the farms,
they made an additional $1.8 million, according to the filing.</TE>
<TE>   In a maneuver that occurred in other transactions, the outside
investors transferred some of their profits back to Fastow, Kopper
and members of their families, according to the document.</TE>
<TE>   The court papers also offered hints as to the government's
strategy for pursuing Fastow.</TE>
<TE>   One former prosecutor, for example, said the mention of Lea Fastow
in court papers may be designed to send a message to Fastow that his
wife will be charged if he does not cooperate.</TE>
<TE>   When junk bond king Michael Milken struck a plea bargain with
investigators in the early 1990s over insider-trading allegations, he
agreed to plead guilty to securities-law violations in part to shield
his brother, Lowell, from prosecution</TE>
<TE>   Fastow "now has to make a Michael Milken-type decision," said
Jacob Frenkel, a former prosecutor now in private practice in
Washington. "It's possible the message to Andy Fastow is, 'tick,
tock, time is running out' " to make a deal.</TE>
<TE>   The government may also have wanted to send a signal that it has
extensive evidence against Fastow and would agree to a plea
arrangement only if it carried strong penalties, some experts said.</TE>
<TE>   The court papers filed Wednesday left open the question of the
government's strategy for pursuing Jeffrey K. Skilling, Enron's
former chief executive, and Kenneth L. Lay, its onetime chairman, who
were not mentioned. That was due in part, experts said, to
prosecutors not wanting to tip their hand about the evidence they
have gathered.</TE>
<TE>   Of the $12 million Kopper has agreed to pay, $4 million will go to
the Justice Department and $8 million to the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The money will be placed in a court registry and
eventually go toward reimbursing investors, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the money being sought from Fastow and his family, the
government revealed that it is seeking to seize assets of other
former Enron employees, including Ben Glisan Jr., Kristina Mordaunt,
Kathy Lynn and Anne Yeager. It also seeks $500,000 from Fastow's
brother, Peter.</TE>
<TE>   Glisan is the former treasurer of Enron who reportedly helped set
up partnership deals with Fastow. Mordaunt is a lawyer who worked for
Fastow and then as general counsel of Enron Broadband. Enron said
Mordaunt was fired last year because she invested in partnerships
without the knowledge of top Enron executives.</TE>
<TE>   Glisan and Mordaunt reportedly reaped huge windfalls from
Southampton investments.</TE>
<TE>   Lynn was an Enron vice president who left Enron last year. And
Yeager was identified by Enron as a former "non-officer employee" who
left the company but had invested in partnerships while working for
Enron.</TE>
<TE>   In U.S. District Court in Houston on Wednesday, Kopper told U.S.
District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr. that he understood the charges
against him. He also disclosed that he has seen a psychologist in the
last year for stress-related anxiety.</TE>
<TE>   After the hourlong hearing, Kopper's lawyer, David Howard, said
his client hopes his admission of guilt and repayment of funds
"demonstrate his deep regret for his own conduct. He apologizes to
all those whose lives have been affected by what he did."</TE>
<TE>   The plea agreement exposes Kopper to a maximum of 15 years in
prison. Prosecutors will recommend a more lenient sentence if he
cooperates as promised, but they said the final determination on
sentencing will be up to the judge.</TE>
<TE>   Also Wednesday, Kopper settled securities-fraud charges brought by
the SEC. He neither admitted nor denied the charges but agreed to be
permanently banned from working as an officer or director of a public
company.</TE>
<TE>   With the plea agreements from David B. Duncan, lead Enron auditor
for accounting firm Arthur Andersen, and now Kopper, authorities
appear to be following a carefully calculated plan to strike in short
bursts, moving closer and closer to the center of Enron's operation
and earning the cooperation of key figures as they go.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department has been criticized for what some contend
is the slow pace of the Enron investigation, but prosecutors
contended the case is moving relatively quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "When we get to a point at which we have a case to bring that's a
significant case, we bring the case, but we do so in a manner that is
professional, and we make sure that we have a case that we can
sustain in court," said Michael Chertoff, head of the Justice
Department's criminal division.</TE>
<TE>   Though authorities would not comment on their next target in the
probe, the senior Justice Department official said: "If and when we
are willing to charge other people, we will do it....I see ourselves
moving ahead aggressively and energetically in this case."</TE>
<TE>   Enron was the nation's seventh-largest company before collapsing
in bankruptcy last Dec. 2.</TE>

<HD>Closures Put Big Hospital Chains Under Microscope</HD>
<DH>Health: An uproar in Marina del Rey reflects growing
government and consumer pressure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON LEE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Tenet Healthcare Corp. sought to close Daniel Freeman Marina
Hospital shortly after buying it from a Catholic order of nuns, the
giant hospital company never imagined the firestorm that would ensue
over such a small, underused facility.</LD>
<LD>   Protests flared from Marina del Rey residents, labor unions,
consumer groups and politicians in Sacramento and Washington. The
California attorney general accused Tenet of breaking promises it
made in December when buying Daniel Freeman. And a Superior Court
judge not only thwarted Tenet's plan to shutter the 166-bed hospital
this month but also ordered the company to resume admitting elective
patients.</LD>
<LD>   Tenet says the two-story hospital, jammed against a car dealership
along a busy thoroughfare, is too small to compete and would require
too much money to fix up. "The problem is that smaller community
hospitals are losing out in markets where you have major competitors
that are larger, have more doctors, better equipment and more
services," Tenet spokesman Harry Anderson said.</LD>
<TE>   But some say that what is happening in Marina del Rey is a
reflection of the pressures from consumers and regulators that are
building against big hospital chains. As Tenet, HCA Inc., Sutter
Health and others have bought more struggling hospitals in recent
years, they have amassed market power and raised their rates.</TE>
<TE>   Health-care costs are projected to jump more than 12% this year,
half of that from spending at hospitals, and employers and consumers
are paying significantly more for medical coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Although hospitals have been changing hands and closing for some
years, federal regulators are stepping up their examination of past
hospital mergers and acquisitions for their effect on prices and
consumers. Michael Cowie, assistant director in charge of enforcement
for the Federal Trade Commission, said there is a growing body of
academic research that suggests big hospital mergers have not been
good for patients. He said that when hospital companies buy
facilities and later close them, it also can create antitrust
problems.</TE>
<TE>   "When they eliminate competitors, that could lead to higher
prices," Cowie said, although he declined to comment about specific
companies.</TE>
<TE>   FTC attempts to block hospital mergers often have been overturned
in courts, which is why the agency is studying the competitive
effects of completed mergers to see whether a case can be made that
consumers have been harmed.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet, chastened by the surprising turn of events in Marina del
Rey, said it will comply with the judge's order and take other steps,
including getting the community involved in the closing process,
which the company had promised to do.</TE>
<TE>   Most likely, the Santa Barbara-based company still will be able to
shut down the hospital fairly soon. But its strained effort at Marina
del Rey has proved costly for the nation's No. 2 hospital chain.
Besides hefty legal fees and expenses to restaff the hospital, the
damage to Tenet's public image and its relations with the state
attorney general's office probably will make future acquisitions
tougher.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to get a lot more scrutiny than it would otherwise
because I don't trust them to keep their promise," said Atty. Gen.
Bill Lockyer, referring to Tenet's negotiations to buy the Kenneth
Norris Jr. Cancer Hospital in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet is eyeing other hospitals in California and elsewhere, but
its missteps at the Marina del Rey facility have made it more
vulnerable to critics of the company's strategy of buying distressed
hospitals and sometimes disposing of them.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1995, the company's holdings have grown from about 50
hospitals to 115, including 40 in California, the most of any
hospital operator in the state. Tenet's revenue, profit and stock
have surged.</TE>
<TE>   But along the way, Tenet also has closed hospitals, including
facilities in Philadelphia, St. Louis and New Orleans. In California,
the company shuttered at least five hospitals and was involved in the
closure of three others from 1995 to 2000, according to a study by UC
Berkeley's School of Public Health. In the spring, Tenet closed St.
Luke Medical Center, a 165-bed hospital in Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   Complaints Rising</TE>
<TE>   Tenet representatives make no apologies for the company's record,
saying it has invested in and revived many facilities while giving up
on some that do not fit in its network or have potential for
succeeding. "We're not ashamed of the closures," Anderson said.</TE>
<TE>   In most cases, the company hasn't met with such vociferous
opposition. But more recently, Tenet has felt more heat from
community groups.</TE>
<TE>   This summer Tenet and a partner lost a bid to acquire five
hospitals operated by Baptist Health System of San Antonio. Although
executives of Baptist Health said only that they had a better offer
elsewhere, a Latino advocacy group had lobbied against the Tenet
deal, as did a local doctors group that expressed worries about a cut
in services.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet is making a pitch to take over Slidell Memorial, a
struggling 180-bed hospital about 25 miles north of New Orleans.
Tenet already owns a hospital nearby, NorthShore Regional Medical
Center.</TE>
<TE>   Al Hamauei, chairman of Slidell Memorial's board, said his
hospital would consider Tenet's bid, along with those from HCA and
others. But he expressed concern that a purchase by Tenet would give
the company a monopoly in the area. "I am not going to do anything
that will cause health-care problems for the community, whether it is
increased cost or less service," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Even some health-care analysts on Wall Street are becoming wary of
the shifting sentiment on large hospital companies. This month
Kenneth Weakley of UBS Warburg lowered his outlook for hospital
stocks, including Tenet's, predicting an industry backlash as
consumers and policymakers react to burgeoning health costs and the
profits of hospital companies. Tenet's latest quarterly profit more
than doubled from a year before to $261 million on revenue of $3.7
billion.</TE>
<TE>   "There's increased noise over rising health-care costs," said Adam
Feinstein of Lehman Bros., although he hasn't changed his bright
forecast for the hospital industry. If there is antagonism toward big
hospital companies, Feinstein said, it is because many people still
have trouble accepting the notion of for-profit health care, of which
Tenet is among the most successful providers.</TE>
<TE>   "They try to buy hospitals that are beaten up and hospitals that
are mismanaged and try to turn them around," Feinstein said. "It's
not the crux of their strategy to close down hospitals."</TE>
<TE>   But with Daniel Freeman Marina, many people would argue that was
the plan all along.</TE>
<TE>   Attractive Real Estate</TE>
<TE>   Tenet bought the hospital in December along with the bigger,
365-bed Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital in nearby Inglewood. For
both hospitals, Tenet paid $55 million to the Sisters of St. Joseph
of Carondelet, who were desperate to find a buyer.</TE>
<TE>   Sister Regina Clare Salazar said she and others tried to keep the
pair of Freeman hospitals going, especially Marina. Except for
emergencies, residents in the affluent community went mostly to
bigger, full-service hospitals such as UCLA Medical Center. So the
sisters added psychiatric and chemical dependency units, which
Salazar said helped the Marina hospital survive for a number of
years.</TE>
<TE>   But in the late 1990s, the federal government reduced Medicare
reimbursements and the sisters had little clout to negotiate better
payments from powerful managed-care companies. Losses at the two
Freeman hospitals mounted, from $5 million in 1998 to more than $38
million in fiscal 2001. "We had no alternative," Salazar said.</TE>
<TE>   For Tenet, the Freeman hospitals were attractive. The seven-acre
parcel that the Marina del Rey hospital sits on was appraised last
year at $22 million. The company also already owned two larger
hospitals not far away--Brotman Medical Center in Culver City and
Centinela Hospital Medical Center in Inglewood. The Freeman hospitals
meant more control of the market in the Los Angeles International
Airport area and the ability to shift patients and resources within
its network.</TE>
<TE>   Despite some objections, Atty. Gen. Lockyer, who by law must
approve a takeover of a nonprofit hospital by an investor-owned
company, approved the transaction with certain conditions. Tenet
agreed to maintain charitable work and to keep Daniel Freeman
Memorial open for at least five years.</TE>
<TE>   Though it made no such commitment regarding Marina, the company
pledged to develop a "comprehensive planning process" and consult
with the hospital's governing board and community leaders and get
input from the public before deciding to close Marina, according to
Tenet's purchase agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet's arrival had an immediate effect on Marina's bottom line.
The hospital's first-quarter filing with the state showed
significantly higher Medicare patient revenue and a narrowing of
operating losses, to $387,000 in the January-to-March period.</TE>
<TE>   But in January, Tenet already was giving hints that it would close
Marina. And it did not wait long. On May 29, more than a month before
its consultant completed a report assessing the Marina del Rey
hospital's market, hospital officials passed out a memo to the
medical staff: The hospital would stop taking new elective admissions
the next day, the memo said, and begin the process of closing
immediately, with only the emergency room remaining open through
August.</TE>
<TE>   By mid-June, Tenet had closed Marina's rehabilitation ward and put
the hospital buildings and land up for sale. Its broker began
marketing the property as an excellent investment or development
opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   Critics complained that Tenet did not want a competitor to buy it.
The company denies that.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet also insists that it did get community input, listing in a
letter to Lockyer more than 50 instances of discussions about the
possible hospital closure with mostly unidentified doctors.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet also says hospital officials consulted with the governing
board about the closure. Dr. Mukesh Bhatia, an internist who is on
that board, said that never happened. "Tenet just expected to waltz
in and announce to the board and everyone that we're closing and that
we'll say, 'Too bad,' and go on with our lives." Bhatia said.</TE>
<TE>   Many didn't. Julie Inouye, a singer and actress whose husband gave
up his Beverly Hills practice years ago to work as an ER physician at
Marina, was so upset by Tenet's actions that she launched a community
revolt. She elicited the help of neighborhood associations, the
medical staff at Marina and groups such as Consumers Union, the
Community Health Councils and the Service Employees International
Union. The coalition set up a Web site, lobbied politicians and
collected petitions from residents, who came out of the woodwork by
the hundreds.</TE>
<TE>   Earthquake Issues</TE>
<TE>   Camden Group, the El Segundo health industry consultant that
prepared the market assessment for Tenet, concluded that though
thousands used Marina's emergency room each year, the hospital was
not financially tenable, given its limited services, population
projections and the surrounding competition.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet also was looking at major seismic retrofitting expenses for
the 33-year-old wood-frame building, estimated by a state seismic
engineer at $2 million to $6 million.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a situation that's going to face the whole state of
California," said Steven Valentine, president of Camden Group, noting
that more communities in California will be wrestling with the
possibility of losing their local hospital. In Marina del Rey's case,
Valentine said, there are enough other hospitals to serve the
community's emergency room needs.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County Emergency Medical Services Agency has not
yet issued a report on the effect of the Marina hospital closure.</TE>
<TE>   But many doctors and residents of the Marina del Rey area say it
will be huge, with emergency rooms at many larger medical centers
already straining from too many patients and the dwindling number of
hospital beds. They contend that Tenet can afford to upgrade Marina
and make the hospital successful.</TE>
<TE>   "Tenet may not make enough money on it to justify their rate of
growth," said Bhatia, who has been at the Marina hospital for 20
years. "They may not become filthy rich, but I doubt they will lose
money."</TE>

<HD>Westerfield Convicted of All Charges</HD>
<DH>Courts: Jury finds neighbor of Danielle van Dam, 7, guilty
of kidnapping, murder.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>After nine days of deliberations, a jury Wednesday convicted David
Westerfield of the kidnapping and murder of 7-year-old Danielle van
Dam in a case that gained nationwide notoriety when the defense
blamed the girl's murder on the "sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll"
lifestyle of her grieving parents.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge William Mudd set next Wednesday to begin the
penalty phase of the trial. The jury of six men and six women will be
asked to recommend to the judge either the death penalty or life in
prison without parole for the 50-year-old, self-employed design
engineer, who lived two doors from the Van Dams and had once bought
Girl Scout cookies from Danielle.</LD>
<LD>   Under state law, kidnapping is a special circumstance that makes a
murderer eligible for execution. But the judge could reject a jury
recommendation of death and instead impose a life sentence.</LD>
<TE>   "Oh, my God!" Brenda van Dam, Danielle's mother, said softly as
the first guilty verdict was read aloud by a court clerk. She and her
husband, Damon, wept and embraced as jurors were polled on the
charges against their former neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   Westerfield trembled slightly and stared directly at jurors. The
jurors--two of whom were in tears--refused to look at Westerfield,
his attorneys or the prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   Westerfield's sister, brother-in-law and former brother-in-law
left the court badly shaken.</TE>
<TE>   "I am in shock. I am just in shock," said David Neal,
Westerfield's ex-brother-in-law. "He thought he was going to get
off."</TE>
<TE>   Until the jury decides what punishment to recommend, Mudd
continued a gag order keeping jurors, lawyers and witnesses from
discussing the case.</TE>
<TE>   During the penalty phase, prosecutors are expected to present
testimony from Danielle's parents and family friends to explain the
devastating impact her murder has had on them, their family and their
suburban neighborhood. They also can present evidence that was not
admissible during the first phase of the trial, which could show that
Westerfield had a propensity to violence.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Steven Feldman told Mudd he has 10 out-of-state
witnesses who are expected to beg the jury for mercy for Westerfield,
who had no prior criminal history except for a drunk-driving
conviction in 1995. Westerfield, who did not testify during the
trial, could testify during the penalty phase.</TE>
<TE>   The Feb. 2 kidnapping of Danielle, a light-haired girl with a
quick laugh and a gap between her front teeth, proved to be the first
in a series of crimes against children that has gripped the nation
this year.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, President Bush mentioned the Van Dam case and that
of Samantha Runnion, 7, who was kidnapped from outside her Orange
County home and murdered last month, in announcing a Sept. 24
conference to find ways to stem what he called "a wave of horrible
violence" against children.</TE>
<TE>   In San Diego, dozens of downtown workers assembled outside the
courthouse and cheered when the verdict was announced. The San Diego
Union-Tribune rushed an extra onto newsstands with a front-page
headline reading: "GUILTY."</TE>
<TE>   Although San Diego has had other grisly murder cases, including
cases involving children, the public was riveted on the Van Dam
trial, which was broadcast on local television and the national Court
TV channel.</TE>
<TE>   "This case is different," said Justin Brooks, a professor at
California Western School of Law in San Diego. "It had sex, drugs,
rock 'n' roll, mummification, entomology, everything that makes for a
great media story."</TE>
<TE>   San Diego Police Chief David Bejarano told reporters that "we're
satisfied and relieved with the verdict."</TE>
<TE>   "This is a step for the city, the Police Department and the Van
Dam family toward closure as we heal," he said. "But we'll always
remember Danielle."</TE>
<TE>   While not required to prove a motive, prosecutors asserted that
Westerfield kidnapped and murdered Danielle because he harbored
sexual fantasies about young girls. The jury also convicted him of
misdemeanor possession of child pornography for material found on his
computers.</TE>
<TE>   During the trial, prosecutors presented evidence that Danielle's
blood, fingerprints and hair were found in Westerfield's home and
recreational vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Feldman countered that there was no evidence that Westerfield was
ever in the Van Dam home, two doors away from his home in the upscale
Sabre Springs neighborhood. He also asserted that the Van Dams'
lifestyle left Danielle vulnerable to strangers having access to the
family home.</TE>
<TE>   Brenda van Dam, 39, who sold books to school libraries, and Damon,
37, a software engineer, testified that they had swapped sex partners
with other couples and occasionally smoked marijuana--admissions that
have led to a daily drumbeat of critical comment by callers to local
radio talk-show programs.</TE>
<TE>   Feldman, who described the couple's lifestyle as "sex, drugs and
rock 'n' roll," told jurors in his closing arguments that "we don't
think they realized the dangers of the lifestyle they engaged in."</TE>
<TE>   "If you engage in a drug and risque sexual lifestyle, your
children are endangered," said Feldman, who, in addition to being one
of the city's top defense attorneys, also belongs to groups that
support the legalization of marijuana.</TE>
<TE>   On the night Danielle disappeared, Brenda van Dam and two female
friends were at Dad's Cafe &amp; Steakhouse in nearby Poway for a "girls'
night out" of dancing, drinking, shooting pool and smoking marijuana.
Westerfield, twice divorced and the father of two grown children, was
also at Dad's. He bought drinks for Van Dam and her friends, but left
before them.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors alleged that Westerfield, angry at not being able to
strike up a relationship with Brenda van Dam's friends, broke into
the Van Dam home through a side door to the garage that Brenda had
left open earlier that evening when she and her friends were smoking
marijuana.</TE>
<TE>   Damon van Dam, who also had smoked marijuana that night, had
tucked Danielle into bed around 10 p.m. and gone to bed himself.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving home with her friends after Dad's closed around 2 a.m.,
Brenda van Dam did not check on Danielle. Prosecutors said
Westerfield may have been hiding in Danielle's bedroom when Brenda
returned home and that he waited for her friends to leave and for her
to go to bed before carrying Danielle out of the house.</TE>
<TE>   Although they never pinpointed when they believed Westerfield
killed the girl, prosecutors indicated they thought she was still
alive when Westerfield took her from the home. The next morning, he
took his recreational vehicle on a circuitous trip to the beach and
desert, while other neighbors frantically searched for Danielle.</TE>
<TE>   The Van Dams testified they initially had not told police about
their drug use or sexual activities because they did not feel it was
relevant to Danielle's disappearance.</TE>
<TE>   But Feldman asserted that by "lying" to police, the couple had
kept police from looking for suspects among people who might have
come to the Van Dam home.</TE>
<TE>   Victims' advocate Marc Klaas, who has befriended the Van Dams,
called the defense strategy "slimy" and criticized radio talk-show
hosts as "bottom-feeding disc jockeys."</TE>
<TE>   "They slammed these parents from Day One," said Klaas, whose
daughter, Polly, was kidnapped and killed by an intruder in 1993. "It
just didn't seem to stop."</TE>
<TE>   The case against Westerfield relied heavily on Danielle's hair and
fingerprints being found in his home and recreational vehicle and
fibers on the girl's body, found nude and decomposing on Feb. 27
along a rural road near a golf course 40 miles from the Van Dam home.</TE>
<TE>   Feldman presented two insect experts who testified that, based on
the bugs found on Danielle's body, she must have been killed after
Westerfield was being watched by police. The prosecution presented
two insect experts to refute that theory.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors heard a tape recording of an interview that police
conducted with Westerfield on Feb. 5. In that interview, Westerfield
said he was "pretty drunk" the night Danielle disappeared and did not
remember how he got home after being at Dad's.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff Dusek told jurors they needed to remember
only two facts: that Danielle disappeared the morning of Feb. 2, and
on the morning of Feb. 4, Westerfield went to a dry cleaner with
several items, including a jacket of his that contained traces of
Danielle's blood.</TE>
<TE>   "The blood was a smoking gun," said veteran defense attorney Gary
Gibson. "The defense has no answer for that."</TE>

<HD>Judge Rejects Plea Deal in N.Y. Doctor's Slaying</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BUFFALO, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>A federal judge rejected a plea deal Wednesday for a couple accused
of aiding a fugitive charged with the 1998 slaying of a doctor who
provided abortions.</LD>
<LD>   "The role of the court is not just ceremonial," said Judge Richard
Arcara. He said the deal appeared to be an attempt to manipulate
federal sentencing guidelines.</LD>
<LD>   Dennis Malvasi and Loretta Marra of New York City had agreed to
plead guilty to assisting James Kopp in exchange for reduced
sentences of 27 months to 33 months in prison.</LD>
<TE>   If convicted at trial, now set to start Sept. 10, each could be
sentenced to up to 10 years and fined $250,000 on more serious
obstruction of justice and other charges.</TE>
<TE>   Kopp, 47, is accused of killing Dr. Barnett Slepian, 52, an
obstetrician who performed abortions.</TE>
<TE>   Kopp quickly became one of the FBI's most wanted fugitives and was
captured in France in March 2001. Investigators contend Malvasi and
Marra, arrested hours later, had provided Kopp with money in France
and Ireland and were plotting to help him sneak back into the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   Kopp has pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree murder and
violating a federal law against using deadly force to interfere with
the right to abortion.</TE>
<TE>   Malvasi, 52, was convicted in 1987 of firebombing a New York
abortion clinic and trying to bomb a second one. He served five years
in prison. His wife, Marra, 37, was twice arrested with Kopp during
antiabortion demonstrations in Vermont and New York in 1990 and 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Their lawyers and a federal prosecutor defended the plea
agreement. But the judge said if he were to accept it "the public
interest would not be served."</TE>

<HD>Hurricane Andrew Is Given a Bigger Punch</HD>
<DH>Weather: Scientists now say the deadly 1992 storm was a
catastrophic 'Category 5.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>U.S. scientists said Hurricane Andrew, which devastated parts of
South Florida in 1992, was stronger than they previously thought and
reclassified it Wednesday as a catastrophic "Category 5" storm on the
scale that measures hurricane intensity.</LD>
<LD>   Only two other Category 5 hurricanes are known to have struck the
United States--an unnamed one that hit the Florida Keys in 1935 and
Hurricane Camille, which hit Mississippi and Louisiana in 1969.</LD>
<LD>   "It makes Andrew a very, very rare event," National Hurricane
Center Director Max Mayfield said. "That's in a way good news because
it is such a rare event."</LD>
<TE>   Hurricane Andrew slammed into the record books as the most costly
natural disaster in U.S. history when it cut across the Florida
Peninsula south of Miami on Aug. 24, 1992, killing 28 people in
Florida and Louisiana and causing more than $25 billion in damage.</TE>
<TE>   No one will ever know for sure how strong Andrew was because it
blew away all the wind-measuring devices in its path, Mayfield said.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers initially estimated it had top sustained winds of 145
mph when it crossed the coastline, making it a Category 4 hurricane
on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale that rates hurricane intensity.</TE>
<TE>   Hurricane experts now estimate that those winds were 165 mph with
gusts stronger than 200 mph, putting Andrew solidly over the 155 mph
threshold for Category 5 status.</TE>
<TE>   The upgrade was based on new analysis of data collected in 1992,
and on a better understanding of a hurricane's internal workings.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers in so-called hurricane-hunter planes measured Andrew's
upper winds as they flew over it at 10,000 feet. Using what was then
the standard formula, they calculated that the winds at the
surface--the ones that cause the damage on the ground--were about 75%
or 80% as strong as those at flight level.</TE>
<TE>   They now know the surface winds are usually more like 90% as
strong as those at flight level, and that new formula pegged Andrew's
sustained winds at 165 mph.</TE>
<TE>   The reclassification resulted from an ongoing review of U.S.
hurricanes dating to 1851 by researchers with the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration.</TE>
<TE>   Mayfield said the reclassification would have made no difference
on the watches and warnings issued as Andrew loomed. But the
information, Mayfield said, was valuable because "society needs an
accurate accounting of the intensity of past catastrophic events to
best plan for the future."</TE>
<TE>   The new formulas come largely from data gathered by dropsondes,
which are tubes of instruments dropped out of planes into the intense
wall of winds around a hurricane's eye.</TE>
<TE>   The dropsondes record wind speed, atmospheric pressure, water
vapor levels and temperatures inside the storm. They relay a new data
to the plane for every 15 feet they fall and mark their location via
global positioning satellites.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers began using them in 1997 and have since dropped 400 of
them into hurricanes, collecting enough measurements to tweak the
formulas used to calculate intensity.</TE>
<TE>   "We're beginning to understand what makes storms strong," said
researcher James Franklin, who presented data to the NOAA/National
Hurricane Center committee that made the upgrade decision.</TE>

<HD>Study Finds Enzyme Can Kill Anthrax</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A bacteria-killing enzyme can detect and destroy anthrax, and it
should work even if terrorists create antibiotic-resistant strains,
researchers say.</LD>
<LD>   The enzyme was isolated from a virus that attacks bacterial cells.</LD>
<LD>   "Essentially, it cracks them open and releases all the cell
contents, so the bacterial cell explodes," said Raymond Schuch of the
Rockefeller University in New York, co-author of a study published
today in the journal Nature.</LD>
<TE>   Ordinary anthrax responds to antibiotics, but there is concern
that terrorists might develop resistant strains. The researchers
suggested it would be difficult to create strains that resist the
enzyme because it acts on a vital part of the bacterial wall, one
that can't easily be modified.</TE>
<TE>   Schuch and colleagues reported that the enzyme, called PlyG lysin,
kills anthrax bacteria in the laboratory. When they infected 19 mice
with a related kind of bacteria that could kill them in five hours,
prompt treatment with PlyG saved 13 of the animals.</TE>
<TE>   They also found that spores of this anthrax-related bacteria could
be quickly detected using PlyG and a hand-held device.</TE>
<TE>   The PlyG enzyme possibly could be made into a drug that would hunt
down anthrax bacteria as they begin to infect a person or an animal,
said Stephen Morse, a Columbia University molecular biologist and
former program manager of the advanced diagnostics program at the
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.</TE>
<TE>   "As always, it will take some time to fully develop and validate
this approach to make sure it has therapeutic value, but it's very
promising," Morse said.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Hanna, a University of Michigan microbiologist who
specializes in anthrax, said the next step will be further animal
tests to see whether the enzyme can halt an anthrax infection.</TE>

<LD>   A woman who was jailed for allegedly letting her three children
get severely sunburned was released after the felony charges against
her were dropped.</LD>
<TE>   In Steubenville, prosecutor Brian Felmet said the children were
not as severely injured as officials had believed, prompting him to
dismiss the three felony child-endangerment charges against Eve
Hibbits, 31.</TE>
<TE>   However, Hibbits was charged with one count of misdemeanor child
endangerment, which carries a maximum penalty of six months in jail
and a $1,000 fine. She pleaded not guilty and was released on her own
recognizance. Her attorney did not return calls to his office seeking
comment.</TE>

<HD>Bush Strikes a Cautious Note on Iraq</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: President, aides criticize media 'frenzy' over
the idea of hitting Saddam Hussein.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CRAWFORD, Texas</DL>
<LD>With allies uneasy about joining a U.S.-led military operation
against Iraq, President Bush said Wednesday that he would consult
with other nations and Congress before acting and complained about
the "intense speculation" that a potential attack has provoked.</LD>
<LD>   "It's kind of a churning," Bush said, as Defense Secretary Donald
H. Rumsfeld, at his side, moved toward the microphone and
interjected: "Frenzy."</LD>
<LD>   The two spoke on Bush's ranch near here at the end of a
morning-long meeting that brought most of the administration's top
national security officials, including Vice President Dick Cheney, to
Central Texas to focus on long-term military issues. The president
said Iraq was not discussed during the meeting.</LD>
<TE>   Almost scoffing at the media attention devoted to Iraq, the
president responded to a reporter's question by calling Iraq "the
particular country that you seem to be riveted on."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the administration has kept the public eye trained on
Iraq and whether it is seeking to build an arsenal of weapons of mass
destruction. An Iraqi arsenal and President Saddam Hussein's behavior
are central elements as Bush seeks to gain support for whatever
course he chooses--including a military invasion--to overthrow
Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Top officials--beginning with the president and including Cheney,
Rumsfeld and Condoleezza Rice, the president's national security
advisor--have spoken frequently about the administration's goal of
removing Hussein from power. They have made it clear that they are
considering a military operation to do so, even as critics say an
expanded war would threaten the anti-terrorism coalition and risk
conflagration throughout the Persian Gulf and Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 15, Brent Scowcroft, who was national security advisor
during the first President Bush's administration, wrote critically
about the risks of such an operation in a Wall Street Journal column.</TE>
<TE>   Bush also is facing questions about attacking Hussein from
important nations in the anti-terrorism coalition his administration
has assembled, including Britain, Germany, France and the Persian
Gulf nation of Bahrain.</TE>
<TE>   "We will continue to talk with ... the people concerned about
peace, and how to secure the peace. And those are needed
consultations. Not only will we consult with friends and allies,
we'll consult with members of Congress," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to a reporter's comment that some nations that
supported the U.S. in the military action in Afghanistan were
reluctant to carry the campaign into Iraq, Rumsfeld answered: "The
president has ... not asked them to."</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether war planning had reached a critical point, with a
decision imminent, Bush observed that Gen. Tommy Franks, whose
Central Command is responsible for military operations in that part
of the world, had not attended Wednesday's meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, under political pressure to present a rationale for trying
to unseat Hussein, said: "The American people know my position, and
that is ... that regime change is in the interests of the world. How
we achieve that is a matter of consultation and ... deliberation.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a deliberative person.</TE>
<TE>   "We will look at all options," Bush said, "and we will consider
all technologies available to us, and diplomacy, and intelligence.
But one thing is for certain: Saddam Hussein is a threat.... Nothing
he has done has convinced me ... that he is the kind of fellow that
is willing to forgo weapons of mass destruction, is willing to be a
peaceful neighbor."</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld seemed to suggest that the nations that supported the
campaign against terrorism might indeed be counted upon in a campaign
against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   He said that "80 or 90 countries" supported the war on terrorism
and "37 or 38" had representatives at U.S. Central Command's Tampa,
Fla., headquarters and that as many as "a couple of dozen countries"
have troops in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "The coalition that is working on the global war on terrorism ...
is broad, it's deep, it's impressive," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld and Rice were joined at the 1,600-acre
ranch by White House Chief of Staff Andrew H. Card Jr., Air Force
Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Lt.
Gen. Ronald Kadish, director of the Pentagon's Missile Defense
Agency, among others, the White House said.</TE>
<TE>   As Bush conferred with the national security team, his Republican
allies in Congress stepped up pressure for action against Iraq. In a
strongly worded speech in Houston, House Majority Whip Tom DeLay
(R-Texas) declared that the Iraqi people must be liberated.</TE>
<TE>   DeLay, attacking skeptics of U.S. intervention in Iraq as
"apologists for idleness," said the House would support Bush if he
asks Congress to back a war resolution.</TE>
<TE>   "The House will be there for the president because he's right,"
DeLay said. "America can't wait. We can't afford the risk. Saddam
must go."</TE>
<TE>   In his news briefing, Bush said the discussion at the meeting of
the military's future was "illuminating," and focused on "contingency
plans" for future crises and how to build the military to deal with
new threats.</TE>
<TE>   He said the group also talked about coordinating weapon systems to
allow the Army and Navy, for example, to work more closely.</TE>
<TE>   "The cold, hard fact," Rumsfeld added, "is that the United States
lives in a very different security environment today in this 21st
century than we did prior to Sept. 11."</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon, he said, needs to "have the kinds of capabilities
that fit the challenges and the threats that exist in the 21st
century."</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's meeting swelled the dwindling press corps covering
Bush's nearly monthlong stay near Crawford. The grassy parking area
across a lane from the former elementary school where reporters work
here was filled with rental cars and trucks.</TE>
<TE>   As they stood before reporters, Bush kidded Rumsfeld about his
attire: The president wore cowboy boots, khakis and a long-sleeve
blue sport shirt. The Defense secretary wore a gray business suit.</TE>
<TE>   "Would you like to explain why you're wearing a suit?" Bush asked
the secretary.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have any sport clothes," Rumsfeld said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush set the record straight: Rumsfeld was about to speak to
troops at nearby Ft. Hood.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld has developed a popular following for his televised
Pentagon briefings for reporters, and he spent almost as much time at
the microphone as the president.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to learn how you answer questions," Bush said to the man
who has served twice as secretary of Defense. "They tell me you're
quite good at it."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers John Hendren and Nick Anderson in Washington
contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Alienated Voters Go for a House Cleaning</HD>
<DH>Politics: In Georgia, defeats of Reps. Barr, McKinney
signal a shift in tone. Insurgency is on the wane as citizens turn to
party loyalists.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Georgia voters accomplished this week what the president and
congressional leaders have often failed to do: In a small but
meaningful way, they changed the tone of Washington.</LD>
<LD>   The twin primary defeats of two members of Congress--Republican
Bob Barr and Democrat Cynthia A. McKinney--removed, in a stroke, two
of the capital's most colorful verbal bomb throwers and elevated in
their place blander, although not necessarily more moderate,
partisans.</LD>
<LD>   At work in Georgia and elsewhere is a longer-term trend that is
changing the nature of the two parties in the House. They are
becoming more disciplined. Insurgency is on the wane.</LD>
<TE>   More and more, candidates on the campaign trail espouse the
messages crafted for them by national party leaders, and when the
victors arrive in Congress, they tend to be party loyalists. These
developments have strengthened leadership within the parties,
although bipartisan deal making remains as difficult as ever.</TE>
<TE>   Barr and McKinney are on their way out because alienated Georgia
voters refused to renominate them in party primaries. Another
unpredictable and outspoken lawmaker did himself in before the
elections; Rep. James A. Traficant Jr., a Democratic iconoclast from
Ohio, was expelled from the House in July after being convicted of
bribery.</TE>
<TE>   That trio alone accounted for a large number of barbed,
unpredictable and occasionally outlandish quotes emanating from
Capitol Hill on a regular basis: Barr on the Clintons; McKinney on
President Bush; Traficant on the world.</TE>
<TE>   "My holy trinity," Thomas Mann, a congressional scholar at the
Brookings Institution, called them. "Now they're all gone. It's
amazing."</TE>
<TE>   Another controversial and sometimes rebellious lawmaker--Rep. Gary
A. Condit of Ceres--also will leave Congress at year's end after
self-destructing in the Chandra Levy scandal. Democratic voters in
his district spurned him in a March primary.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the candidates who either beat or are seeking to
replace these newsmakers have offered themselves as dependable
partisans without the baggage.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. John Linder, a quiet GOP veteran who thumped Barr by a
breathtaking 64% to 36% in the 7th Congressional District north of
Atlanta, said in a phone interview Wednesday that voters viewed both
Barr and McKinney as "out of touch, out of the mainstream." Linder,
who had run a television ad during the campaign that linked the two
firebrands, continued: "After Sept. 11, [voters] didn't want anger.
They want people to sit down and talk to each other and work things
out. Antagonism was not going to do well in this election."</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, Denise Majette, the former state judge who defeated
McKinney by a surprisingly wide margin (58% to 42%) in eastern
Atlanta's 4th District, said in a statement on her campaign Web site:
"In today's political climate, just shaking one's fist at the system
and taking credit for political initiatives does not produce
results."</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, every congressional race has its own story line.
McKinney, a staunch supporter of Arab causes, was defeated by a
candidate who had greater financial support, including many
out-of-state donations from Jewish and pro-Israel groups. Barr and
Linder were thrown into the same contest after Democrats in the
state's Legislature redrew congressional district boundaries for
partisan advantage.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Georgia's open primary system allowed Democrats to
vote against Barr and Republicans to punish McKinney. Many apparently
did.</TE>
<TE>   In the next Congress, the departure of such lawmakers as Barr and
McKinney will mean more than the absence of quotable figures. It will
accelerate generational shifts within the two parties.</TE>
<TE>   For Republicans, Barr is the latest prosecutor from President
Clinton's 1999 impeachment trial to leave Congress. Of the 13 House
impeachment managers, only six are expected to return to the chamber
in January. In addition, Barr is the latest member of the famous GOP
class of 1994 to leave.</TE>
<TE>   Many Republican lawmakers from that 73-member class, which helped
bring the GOP to power in the House, formed a rebellious, aggressive
force within the party. They lifted Newt Gingrich to the speakership
and later helped dump him. They agitated for the shutdown of the
government in a memorable confrontation with Clinton in 1995-'96.</TE>
<TE>   Now their ranks are thinning, and the class members who are left
are becoming more pragmatic. With Barr's loss, that trend will
continue; only 32 are expected back in January. But the House
Republican leadership as a whole is expected to continue to champion
a strongly conservative agenda.</TE>
<TE>   For Democrats, the primary defeats of McKinney--and, earlier this
year, Rep. Earl F. Hilliard of Alabama--will prompt soul-searching
within the influential Congressional Black Caucus. Hilliard, like
McKinney, had pro-Arab support but was defeated by a challenger,
Artur Davis, funded by backers of Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the black Democratic lawmakers who will return to the next
Congress are among the party's elders. They will face the questions
of whether and how to adjust the caucus' positions on the Mideast and
other matters.</TE>
<TE>   Mann predicted that Majette and Davis, who are both African
American, would work toward a new kind of black politics--less
focused on civil rights and more on a broader party agenda.</TE>
<TE>   "Both are clearly liberal Democrats, but their styles are
different" from McKinney's and Hilliard's, Mann said. "Each of them
will try to build biracial coalitions."</TE>

<LD>Age has caught up with one of the military's most storied
helicopters.</LD>
<LD>   A crack found in a rotor component of the Vietnam-era CH-46 Sea
Knight has led the Navy and Marine Corps to ground the entire fleet,
including 45 on duty overseas, officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Ward Carroll, a spokesman for Naval Air Systems Command, said the
temporary grounding was a precautionary move after the discovery
during a routine inspection of a crack in the rotor assembly on a
craft at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point in North Carolina.</LD>
<TE>   As of Wednesday, about half the 291 Sea Knights in the fleet had
been inspected for the same defect and only one more was found,
Carroll said. Those cleared by inspection are immediately returned to
service.</TE>
<TE>   By itself, the problem is not a major setback for Navy and Marine
Corps aviation. But it is the latest in a series of mechanical
troubles for the Sea Knight, and is symptomatic of the problems
affecting many aging military aircraft. The problems also make it
more expensive to keep the aircraft in service.</TE>
<TE>   The Sea Knight, which has been flying 38 years, has to be
inspected more frequently for mechanical flaws, and the Marine Corps'
version is limited to carrying 12 troops instead of the 25 as
originally designed. The Marines say the cost per flight hour has
risen 75% in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Similar problems face the Air Force's C-5 transport, the Navy's
F-14 Tomcat fighter and EA-6B electronic warfare plane, and the
Army's AH-64 Apache copter.</TE>
<TE>   The Marine Corps relies on the Sea Knight as its primary combat
assault helicopter. The Navy uses it to ferry equipment. Built by
Boeing Co., the Sea Knight entered service in June 1964, making it
older than most of the personnel who now fly it.</TE>

<LD>An airline passenger who tried to recharge a battery with a lighter,
forcing the plane to be diverted, was charged Wednesday with
interfering with a flight crew.</LD>
<LD>   An attorney for Maxim Segalov said it didn't appear that his
client meant any harm to the San Francisco-bound flight.</LD>
<LD>   "I think he's scared to death and doesn't understand anything at
this juncture," lawyer Steven Killpack said.</LD>
<TE>   Segalov allegedly put a flame to an AA-size battery used in his CD
player while on the American Airlines flight Tuesday from Chicago.
After the plane landed in Salt Lake City, Segalov and a companion
were removed from the jet.</TE>
<TE>   Killpack said Segalov, a native of Belarus, has no criminal record
and is a U.S. citizen and a student at San Jose State University.</TE>

<HD>Bush to Seek Wider Power on Forest-Thinning Plan</HD>
<DH>Nature: The president is to provide details on his
fire-prevention proposal today. Critics say it puts the timber
industry 'back in the driver's seat.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In an effort to expedite the thinning of forests to prevent fires,
President Bush plans to ask Congress today for broader authority to
allow timber harvesters to use the trees and other wood products they
remove for commercial gain.</LD>
<LD>   The so-called stewardship contracts are part of a plan to hasten
selective cutting of national forests. While visiting Oregon today,
Bush is expected to make an official announcement of the proposal,
which was first reported in The Times on Wednesday and later outlined
in documents released by the White House.</LD>
<LD>   "It's clear that we need private-sector assistance; we can't do
all of the thinning that has to be done just at taxpayer expense,"
said a senior administration official who spoke on condition of
anonymity.</LD>
<TE>   The plan is aimed at alleviating the catastrophic forest fires
that have plagued the West in recent years. Already, more than 5.9
million acres of public and private land have burned this year, more
than twice the annual average.</TE>
<TE>   However, conservationists criticized the plan as an effort to
increase access to public forests by timber companies and reduce the
ability of citizens, environmental groups and Forest Service
employees to stop timber harvests that threaten endangered species
and other environmental values.</TE>
<TE>   "It is designed to put the timber industry back in the driver's
seat, and that is not what is needed if we're going to reduce the
risk of fire," said Jay Watson, California representative of the
Wilderness Society, a national environmental organization.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists said that if the administration was sincerely
interested in reducing fires, it would ask Congress for more money to
thin underbrush and small trees, which fuel the fires, rather than
make it easier for timber companies to remove the larger,
fire-resistant trees.</TE>
<TE>   The outline of the plan was released late Wednesday. Officials
said they wanted to leave the details of the proposal for the
president to announce, so some parts remained murky.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, it calls for abolishing a so-called rider that
"imposed extraordinary procedural requirements on Forest Service
appeals."</TE>
<TE>   Nathaniel Lawrence, director of the Natural Resources Defense
Council's forestry program, said this was clearly an oblique
reference to Congress' effort to save the appeals process after
President George Bush's administration canceled it in 1992. The
congressional measure protecting the appeals process was attached to
the Interior Department appropriation bill for fiscal 1993.</TE>
<TE>   The appeals process authorizes citizens, environmental groups and
Forest Service employees to challenge timber sales administratively
and in court if they believe that the sales mismanage the public's
forests by threatening an endangered species or otherwise abusing
natural resources.</TE>
<TE>   It was "impossible" to tell from the documents released whether
the Bush administration intends to try to eliminate the appeals
process or reduce its scope, Lawrence said.</TE>
<TE>   The administration official, whom the White House provided to
explain the proposal, said the changes would be consistent with a
measure passed last month concerning the Black Hills National Forest
in South Dakota, which excluded fuel treatment projects from public
comment and judicial review and appeals. That measure reflected a
consensus agreement approved by environmental groups as well as
timber companies.</TE>
<TE>   "They're essentially proposing a rollback of environmental laws,"
said Simeon Herskovits, senior staff attorney with the Western
Environmental Law Center.</TE>
<TE>   The senior administration official also said that the stewardship
contracts, which have already been tried in some areas, could become
"very widespread."</TE>
<TE>   "We have a huge area that needs to be thinned," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   These contracts would allow timber firms or other organizations to
keep any profits they earn from the trees and other wood products
they remove from forests to diminish the threat of fire.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials refused to say how the plan would change
the Sierra Nevada framework, a plan to manage the vast mountain
chain. However, the proposal does call for removing "needless
administrative obstacles" to timber projects on the Northwest Forest
Plan, which guides forest management in western Washington, western
Oregon and northern California.</TE>
<TE>   Both conservationists and the Bush administration attribute the
catastrophic fires of recent years to a variety of Forest Service
policies, including the practice of extinguishing low-intensity
fires. The policy, pursued since the 1920s, resulted in much denser
forests and a buildup of smaller trees and brush. In the meantime,
timber companies harvested the largest, most fire-resistant trees.</TE>
<TE>   These were perfect conditions for high-intensity fires that can
destroy ecosystems.</TE>
<TE>   The conservationists say they do not trust the Forest Service to
save enough of the big trees when they grant logging permits.</TE>
<TE>   "No one believes that is what is really going to happen," said
Keith Hammond, spokesman for the California Wilderness Coalition. "We
will see contracts written to remove as many big trees as possible,
and as little of the small junk brush as possible. Timber companies
are not in it for fuel reduction and public-safety goals. It's an
inherently perverse incentive."</TE>
<TE>   Conservationists want the Forest Service to cut only small trees
and brush, particularly from areas of forests closest to communities.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>A Miami International Airport concourse was evacuated for three hours
Wednesday after a pepper spray can discharged, causing 43 people to
suffer respiratory distress.</LD>
<LD>   The can disguised as a cigarette lighter was found near the
second-floor security checkpoint in Concourse B, which serves
international flights, fire department spokesman Jeff Hackman said.</LD>
<LD>   Officials were certain pepper spray was the irritant, airport
spokeswoman Alicia Diaz said.</LD>
<TE>   Security regulations allow airline passengers to carry pepper
spray only if the canister has a way of preventing accidental
discharge.</TE>
<TE>   Paramedics treated 43 people for breathing problems and other
symptoms, including scratchy throat, watery eyes, coughing and
sneezing, Hackman said.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw my co-workers were crying, they couldn't breathe, they were
scratching themselves," said Mayelin Rodriguez, a screener with
Global Aviation Services in Concourse B.</TE>
<TE>   At least five American Airlines flights scheduled to depart from
Concourse B were moved to other gates, Diaz said.</TE>
<TE>   The incident caused alarm in South Florida, where the first cases
of anthrax contamination were reported last autumn after the Sept. 11
attacks on New York and the Pentagon.</TE>

<HD>Judge Stays Order in Taliban Case</HD>
<DH>Terror: U.S. is told it can appeal request for more
evidence on a prisoner born in America.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A U.S. judge ruled Wednesday that the government can appeal his order
requesting more evidence about whether a U.S.-born Taliban prisoner
can be held as an enemy combatant.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Robert Doumar in Norfolk, Va., said the
question on Yaser Esam Hamdi can go to a federal appeals court. He
also issued a stay to postpone a deadline for compliance with his
Aug. 16 order demanding more evidence in the case. Doumar said the
government had provided insufficient evidence to support Hamdi's
detention and ordered it to provide documents about his capture,
classification and detention.</LD>
<LD>   Hamdi, 21, has been held in a U.S. military jail in Norfolk since
early April, without access to a lawyer and without any charges
brought against him. The Saudi national was among Taliban and Al
Qaeda detainees held at a U.S. naval base in Cuba when officials
discovered he had been born in Louisiana and moved him to Norfolk.</LD>
<TE>   On Monday, the Justice Department asked Doumar for permission to
appeal the Aug. 16 order, saying it had provided more than sufficient
evidence to support its determination that Hamdi could be detained as
an enemy combatant. In addition, it said the information Doumar
wanted could have national security implications.</TE>
<TE>   The case, which has become a test of the government's power to
hold enemy combatants in the war against terrorism, has already been
taken to the appeals court twice.</TE>
<TE>   In an affidavit filed by the Defense Department, the government
said Hamdi told U.S. military interrogators that he went to
Afghanistan last summer to train with and, if necessary, fight for
the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   But Doumar ruled the declaration was insufficient, and he said he
would be acting as "little more than a rubber stamp" if he accepted
the sparse facts of the affidavit to permit Hamdi's detention as an
enemy combatant.</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The governors of New York and New Jersey on Wednesday proposed
changing the name of Newark International Airport to Liberty
International Airport at Newark in honor of those who died in the
Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<LD>   "The events of Sept. 11 shattered our domestic tranquillity and
threatened us all," New Jersey Gov. James E. McGreevey said,
appearing with New York Gov. George Pataki at a news conference at
the site of the fallen World Trade Center.</LD>
<LD>   "It would be appropriate to commemorate the memory of the heroes
of that day by this proposed name change for Newark International
Airport."</LD>
<TE>   Officials of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which
oversees airports in the New York metropolitan region that includes
Newark, N.J., said they welcomed the proposed name change.</TE>
<TE>   "The name Liberty International Airport at Newark would be a
powerful and permanent way to honor the countless Americans who have
given their lives defending liberty at home and abroad," Port
Authority Chairman Jack Sinagra and Vice Chairman Charles Gargano
said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   "The port authority will work with Govs. McGreevey and Pataki, our
board of commissioners and the city of Newark to see that this
fitting tribute becomes a reality."</TE>
<TE>   The governors made their suggestion while announcing plans to
erect a viewing wall at the trade center site that will bear the
names of the nearly 3,000 people killed when two hijacked planes
slammed into the twin towers Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   A third plane struck the Pentagon, while a fourth hijacked jet,
which took off from Newark, crashed in Pennsylvania.</TE>

<HD>University Seeks to Fire Palestinian Professor</HD>
<DH>Security: Florida school tells court Sami A. Arian has long
had terrorism links. But many of his colleagues see academic freedom
threatened.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>A Palestinian professor whose fate is considered a litmus test of
academic liberty by many of his peers was accused Wednesday of
long-standing ties to terrorism by the University of South Florida,
which asked a judge for the green light to fire him.</LD>
<LD>   Since September, Sami A. Arian has been on paid leave from his
tenured post and barred from the Tampa campus while administrators
and trustees pondered what to do with him. The professor of computer
science has never been charged with a crime, though the FBI
investigated him in the mid-1990s on suspicions that a think tank he
founded might have been a front for Muslim extremism. In February,
federal prosecutors said Arian still was being investigated but gave
no details.</LD>
<LD>   On Dec. 19, trustees of the state-run school recommended firing
Arian, saying his outside activities had caused immense disruption at
the university. But after university President Judy Genshaft
announced plans to terminate Arian's employment, saying he posed a
safety risk, the faculty senate voted against that decision. In June,
a committee of the American Assn. of University Professors sided with
Arian, warning that it could censure the university if he was fired
on Genshaft's grounds.</LD>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Genshaft said she had spent months in discussions
with law enforcement officials, faculty members, students, lawyers
and representatives of the professors' group. She said she believes
"Arian has abused his position at the university and is using
academic freedom as a shield to cover improper activities."</TE>
<TE>   In court papers filed Wednesday, the university alleges that
beginning in 1988, Arian had engaged in "activities which were
directed to inciting or producing lawless action," including
sponsoring Islamic terrorists' entry into the United States under the
guise of attending academic conferences, and raising money to help
finance suicide bombings against Israel.</TE>
<TE>   In June, the Tampa Tribune quoted former and current Israeli
security and intelligence officials as describing Arian as a founding
member of the governing council of Palestinian Islamic Jihad.</TE>
<TE>   Arian has long maintained he has never advocated the use of
violence and has no links to Islamic Jihad or any other terrorist
group. He downplays his anti-Israeli statements, including "death to
Israel," as slogans against the Israeli occupation of Palestinian
lands.</TE>
<TE>   In its court papers, the university asks a state judge in Tampa to
agree that Arian can be fired without infringing on his
constitutional rights. The decision reached by the courts would be
accepted as final, said R. B. Friedlander, a counsel for the school.</TE>
<TE>   Arian predicted Wednesday that the university's legal bid would
fail. "It's still a case of academic freedom," he said. "That hasn't
changed. It's just an indication of how politicized the university
has become."</TE>
<TE>   Friedlander disagreed. "We pretty strongly feel it's not an issue
of academic freedom, because that deals with what you teach in the
classroom, and your work in your discipline," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Klisch, vice president of the university's faculty union,
said that despite the allegations aired Wednesday, the administration
still hasn't made its case for getting rid of the controversial
professor.</TE>
<TE>   "Punishing a man and threatening to fire a man based on rumors,
that's just not the American way," Klisch said. "All the faculty
union has wanted all along is to give this man the due process he
deserves." He said he believed the university took the case to the
courts, a process that could take months, to stall to see whether the
Justice Department would act against Arian.</TE>
<TE>   The professor's brother-in-law, Mazen Najjar, who is also
Palestinian, is expected to be deported this week from a
maximum-security federal lockdown. Najjar, who holds a doctorate in
engineering and taught at the University of South Florida, spent more
than 3 1/2 years in jail on secret evidence that the U.S. government
said linked him to terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   "If they had enough evidence, don't you think they would have gone
after Arian, arrested him and deported him, the way they are doing
against his brother-in-law?" asked Klisch. "Now if such evidence
shows up, that's a different story."</TE>
<TE>   Friedlander said she wasn't privy to the government's reasoning
about Arian. "I do know they have taken [the] extraordinary step of
announcing publicly that he is under active criminal investigation,"
she said.</TE>

<HD>Man Pleads to Lesser Charge in Riot Killing</HD>
<DH>Courts: He admits to conspiracy for being a white gang's
lookout in 1969 when a black woman was shot to death in York, Pa.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>YORK, Pa.</DL>
<LD>A man pleaded guilty to conspiracy Wednesday for being a white gang's
lookout during 1969 race riots in which a black woman was shot as her
car entered a white neighborhood.</LD>
<LD>   Chauncey Gladfelter, 50, is the fifth defendant to plead guilty to
conspiracy in the death of Lillie Belle Allen, 27, of Aiken, S.C.
Murder charges were withdrawn in exchange for the pleas.</LD>
<LD>   "Back then I was young and stupid and I regret being there,"
Gladfelter said. "I'd like to apologize to the Allen family. I'm very
sorry for the tragedy."</LD>
<TE>   He said in court that he had access to a rifle and was stationed
on a rear balcony to watch for blacks entering the neighborhood. He
said he wasn't facing the street and did not see other gang members
shoot Allen on July 21, 1969.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, three men pleaded guilty to shooting at the car
carrying Allen and her sister, parents and brother-in-law. A fourth
man pleaded guilty to being a lookout and being armed.</TE>
<TE>   If the judge accepts the plea agreements, the men would each face
up to two years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   A trial for four of the five defendants still charged with murder
is scheduled to begin Sept. 23.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Allen's family, lawyer Michael McGuckin, said:
"We're very happy another defendant has come forward and admitted his
responsibility."</TE>
<TE>   More than 60 people were injured during the 10-day riots and 100
people were arrested before the National Guard entered the town with
tanks.</TE>
<TE>   On July 18, the second day of the riots, a white police officer,
Henry Schaad, was fatally shot while patrolling a black neighborhood.
Two black men charged with his death are awaiting trial.</TE>

<HD>New Generation Rocket Hits Skies</HD>
<DH>Aerospace: Atlas 5 offers shorter launching window, and is
built to carry heavier payloads.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Lockheed Martin Corp. successfully launched its newest rocket
Wednesday on a mission heralding a new era of heavy-lifting launching
vehicles for the next generation of satellites.</LD>
<LD>   Lockheed Martin has more than $1 billion invested in the Atlas 5,
which roared off into mostly clear skies with a European
communication satellite.</LD>
<LD>   Liftoff was on schedule at 6:05 p.m. EDT, Lockheed Martin
spokeswoman Julie Andrews said.</LD>
<TE>   "We've got a perfect, fantastically successful launch," Andrews
said after the separation of the rocket from the Eutelsat Hot Bird 6
spacecraft, 31 minutes after the 191-foot-tall Atlas 5 took off.</TE>
<TE>   The Atlas 5 was rolled onto the launching pad Tuesday. Normally an
unmanned rocket would spend weeks, if not months, on the pad in
preparation for liftoff. But quick turnaround is just one new feature
of this rocket, which Lockheed Martin promises its customers can be
brought to the pad from its vehicle integration building 12 hours
before the scheduled liftoff.</TE>
<TE>   Lockheed Martin is betting it can reduce launch pad logjams, where
a problem with one payload or rocket on the pad means delays for
clients downstream.</TE>
<TE>   The Atlas 5 is designed to withstand hurricane-threshold winds and
to launch from a "clean" pad, one without the steel-girder launching
towers seen since the dawn of the Space Age.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a much more reliable product. It's very robust," John
Karas, Lockheed Martin's vice president for Atlas 5 development, said
before the launching.</TE>
<TE>   The Atlas 5's first-stage engines are built near Moscow by
Energia, the same Russian company that builds Soyuz spacecraft and
modules for the international space station.</TE>
<TE>   The Atlas 5 class of rockets use a common booster stage, fueled by
kerosene and liquid oxygen, and a Centaur upper stage powered by
liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen.</TE>
<TE>   The stripped-down version, like the one that debuted Wednesday,
can carry a 28,000-pound payload into orbit.</TE>
<TE>   Beefed up with five strap-on solid-fuel boosters and a second
Centaur engine, the new Atlas 5 can lift 45,000 pounds, nearly twice
the capacity of the last generation of Atlas rockets.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The owners of Radio City Music Hall on Wednesday agreed on a
three-year contract with the union that represents its signature
dancers, the high-kicking Rockettes.</LD>
<LD>   Negotiations broke down eight days ago over Radio City
Entertainment's attempt to use open auditions rather than
guaranteeing positions to veteran dancers.</LD>
<LD>   The contract gives 41 veteran Rockettes buyouts ranging from
$27,000 to $120,000. Eleven of those dancers were offered retirement
packages, though the 30 others can audition for future shows.</LD>
<TE>   "They were not pleased," said union negotiator John Hall.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>A man accused of dragging an 11-year-old girl from her bedroom and
pummeling her with a hammer was charged Wednesday with kidnapping,
attempted rape and attempted murder.</LD>
<LD>   The girl remained hospitalized in critical condition. Doctors said
every bone in the middle of her face had been broken.</LD>
<LD>   "This is probably one of the most egregious, violent felonies
against a child," Salt Lake County Dist. Atty. David Yocom said.</LD>
<TE>   "It's pretty amazing she has survived."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said Javier Sickler, 28, dragged the girl from her
bedroom Monday and attempted to rape her in the yard. He then
allegedly beat her with a hammer.</TE>
<TE>   Sickler and the girl's father were high school classmates and had
renewed their friendship in the last few weeks, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Sickler was in jail on $1.5-million bail and was to be arraigned
today. It wasn't immediately clear if he had an attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Sickler told investigators he suffers from blackouts
and doesn't remember attacking the girl, though he does remember
knocking on the door of her home that night.</TE>

<HD>FDA Approves Testing of West Nile Virus Drug</HD>
<DH>Health: The trial will see whether interferon can fight the
disease that has killed 13 people this year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN GARVEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Food and Drug Administration gave the go-ahead this week for the
first national trial of a drug to treat the West Nile virus, a
mosquito-transmitted disease that has killed 13 people this year.</LD>
<LD>   The trial, announced by Dr. James Rahal at a news conference
Wednesday in New York, will study whether the drug alpha- interferon
lessens the symptoms and duration of the illness.</LD>
<LD>   The West Nile virus has spread rapidly since 1999, when the first
cases in the United States were confirmed in New York. It has been
diagnosed as far west as Texas in humans and Wyoming in animals, and
experts warn that it is only a matter of time before it appears on
the West Coast. This year, 269 cases have been reported to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</LD>
<TE>   Individuals infected with West Nile may suffer problems ranging
from mild flu-like symptoms to paralysis, brain swelling and death.</TE>
<TE>   The study will examine whether interferon, which has shown promise
in treating the similar St. Louis virus, can stop the progression of
West Nile. There currently are no approved treatments for either
virus. The drug is sold by Schering-Plough Corp. under the trade name
Intron A.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, patients are treated with supportive care--intravenous
fluids maintaining vital organ function. If a patient is unable to
breathe, they intubate them," Rahal said. "We're hoping that the drug
would prevent people from progressing to that state."</TE>
<TE>   Rahal, director of infectious diseases at New York Hospital Queens
and a professor of medicine at Cornell University, used the drug
during the initial outbreak of West Nile in the United States. It was
used again last year in Monroe, La., during an outbreak of the St.
Louis virus, which is also spread by mosquitoes.</TE>
<TE>   In Louisiana, 15 people were treated with Intron A, and their
responses compared with those of earlier patients who had not
received the drug. Rahal said the results, which he plans to publish,
were "very promising" but conceded that the study did not follow
standard scientific protocols.</TE>
<TE>   The new study, which Rahal hopes to begin as soon as possible,
will enroll 40 patients over age 50 who are hospitalized with West
Nile virus.</TE>
<TE>   Those who enroll will be required to sign an informed consent form
because the drug is currently approved only for the treatment of
hepatitis C and genital warts.</TE>
<TE>   Rahal said the study is looking for patients who are in the early
stages of illness and who have been hospitalized for no more than
four days. Outpatients do not qualify. Younger patients may be
enrolled if they are diagnosed with encephalitis, a potentially fatal
brain swelling that can be caused by the virus.</TE>
<TE>   Interferon is a compound produced by the body as a first-line
defense against viral infection. It has also been shown to stimulate
the immune system. Reported side effects, which include fever, chills
and fatigue, are usually mild.</TE>
<TE>   The age requirement was set because older people are considered at
greatest risk of developing encephalitis, the most serious form of
the disease. If enrolled in the study, a patient would be randomly
assigned to receive either a placebo or the drug.</TE>
<TE>   In previous outbreaks, from 10% to 30% of patients over age 50
have died. The informed consent form, however, points out that about
80% of patients infected with West Nile or St. Louis virus recover
after receiving only general support such as intravenous fluids.</TE>
<TE>   While concern has run high in 13 states and the District of
Columbia, where human cases have been diagnosed, health officials
have cautioned that higher numbers of Americans will die of more
common diseases, such as influenza, this year.</TE>
<TE>   Still, people have been warned to take precautions to avoid
mosquito bites and to alert local health officials to dead birds.
Birds carry the virus and can transfer it to mosquitoes.</TE>
